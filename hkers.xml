While this may enhance its ability to raise geopolitical tensions or conduct territorial expansion, complications remain around the execution of such a strategy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has developed significant global influence through the use of development financing, spending $1 trillion since 2013, including $160 billion in Africa. This article is based on research conducted into Chinese influence in sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on Angola, Zambia and Kenya. The study involved interviews with key figures such as senior business officials, Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE) and state-owned bank managers, investigative journalists and personal contacts within the former intelligence sphere, all of whom had first-hand or extensive experience of Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research uncovered how Beijing’s overarching strategy on the African continent seeks to court foreign policy influence in order to sanction-proof supply chains and develop dual-use ports, despite the doubtful resilience of such a strategy outside of peacetime conditions. A former senior manager in a Chinese SOE stated, “the large SOEs in the region have very limited freedom. It is guided by the Central Government from the way they are staffed at the high level and the overarching direction they pursue”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sanction-proofing-supply-chains&quot;&gt;Sanction-Proofing Supply Chains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core component of this strategy is China’s use of financing for “resource-led diplomacy” to facilitate access to raw materials and minerals for electronics, renewable energy and hi-tech industries. According to a Brookings report, by 2019, minerals and fossil fuels accounted for 35% of exports to China from 60% of African countries. Trade between China and Africa saw a 1,900% increase from 2000, the year of the first Forum on China–Africa Cooperation summit. Yet access to raw materials masks half the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, China is tailoring funding to build bespoke infrastructure (roads/railways/ports) for the transport of raw materials in a sanction-resilient supply chain. Securing raw materials in Zambia led China to enhance strategic supply routes to port sites in Lobito, Luanda and Mombasa. Indeed, based on Observer Research Foundation statistics, the use of financing to secure access to raw materials in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia accounted for 60% of all trade between China and Africa. A head of a leading private intelligence group suggested that securing access to copper is “the be all and end all” for China–Zambia financing, which is part of a wider global strategy to “control the copper market and deny Western companies access by removing Western powers from supply chains”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing views Zambia as “land-linked” rather than “land-locked”. Interviewees described the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation’s operations in Zambia as intricately tied to the Central Government, having previously been part of the Chinese Ministry of Railways and currently being overseen by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. Its activities in Zambia expose Beijing’s clear strategy of securing raw material supply routes in order to enhance China’s energy security in case of future sanctions. Indeed, China focuses financing on specific strategic roads and railways which “creates a corridor so most of the lithium, copper, cobalt etc. can access the coast and go back to China” via the Tazara Railway and roads connecting Zambia, the DRC, South Africa and Angola. A former Nigerian presidential advisor who had worked on several Chinese BRI deals suggested that “through helping with infrastructure projects China is securing the ability to move things directly from Zambia and the surrounding region out to Mombasa and the African coast to China”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kenya, China secures strategic supply routes by using it as the maritime gateway for raw materials from the hinterland. A former senior official within an Investment Banking department at the China Construction Bank (CCB) suggested that Chinese SOEs in Kenya were working in concert. The state-owned China State Railway Group which was responsible for the Mombasa–Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and the Nairobi-Thika Highway Project purportedly worked in collaboration with mining SOEs in neighbouring countries to improve China’s raw material supply routes. Moreover, following interviews with senior government officials, a senior source suggested that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) issued directives to ensure a strategic foothold in the country, meaning the SGR and associated Chinese-funded infrastructure projects became “too big to fail”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corroborating this, the CEO of a prominent Chinese advisory financing firm, reporting on conversations with Chinese officials, conveyed that “China saw Kenya as a key logistics hub”. Mombasa’s deepwater port made it “the best strategic location and a hub of the large region of East and Central Africa”. A former UK intelligence official stated, “China wants to be a rival to India in the Indian Ocean. They want to be able to get access to those resources and minerals and they view Kenya as the artery to the continent”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The ultimate goal is to ensure that if the US and other countries cease or begin to strongly limit cooperation, China’s supply chain resilience is already in place&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar motivation was found in Angola, a country with vast oil reserves. AidData investment figures and the CEO of an Africa–China investment advisory firm who worked on Chinese-Angolan oil deals revealed that several Chinese-financed projects were tailored to suit Chinese supply chain interests, including the $362 million Benguela Railway, the $923 million construction work to Caio port in Cabina, and efforts to bolster raw material strategic supply routes via the port of Lobito, Luanda and the Tazara Railway. Indeed, China financed the $1.5 billion refurbishment of the Lobito-Benguela railway corridor from the cobalt belt in the southern DRC to the port of Lobito, freeing up capacity to carry 20 million tonnes of export cargo annually. Having spoken to senior Beijing officials, an interviewee suggested that the MFA and Peking University developed a “resources for infrastructure financing” framework and used Angola as the pioneering example over 15 years ago. Further reports suggest current plans exist to connect the railway with Zambia’s 1860 km Chinese-financed Tazara Railway, giving China export routes from the west coast through the raw material-rich heartland to Tanzania’s east-coast Dar es Salaam port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such examples of Chinese financing in sub-Saharan Africa aimed at sanction-proofing supply routes are generalisable to countries including the DRC, Ghana, Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt and several East African countries. A former UK intelligence official declared, “they wish to keep plenty of strings to their energy and mineral supply chain bow and this explains a lot of their development financing. They are looking now to fortify their trading networks against a possible US and European sanctions movement that would come with an invasion of Taiwan or increased geopolitical tension”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lawyer previously working on Chinese BRI deals stated, “it is clear that China is working together with the development banks to get the money in, buy the asset, build the infrastructure around it, get it onto a railway and get it to the port”. A former senior manager in a large SOE supported this view, stating that “those harbours and railways are not put in place by us just for fun or development help or a small return on a loan. If we need a railway to reach the next country for this supply chain, we will put it in place to reach those materials”. Indeed, a former senior official within an Investment Banking department at the CCB insisted that China does not trust international markets and wants to be self-sufficient to prevent the threat of Western sanctions. The ultimate goal is to ensure that if the US and other countries cease or begin to strongly limit cooperation, China’s supply chain resilience is already in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dual-port-use&quot;&gt;Dual Port Use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having bolstered supply chain resilience, China is also ensuring that a significant amount of its port construction is being completed to a “dual port use specification” so as to avoid Western suspicion of PLA Navy (PLAN) build-up. Chinese-funded ports are built to accommodate commercial trade, but can – with significant risks and complications (see below) – be flipped to military use as the depth and landing/docking zones are built to PLAN specifications. A regional director at a private intelligence firm and former UK intelligence official with experience of BRI port deals pointed to secure, dual-use facilities in several countries including Angola, Equatorial Guinea, South Africa and Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s own 2019 defence white paper stated that the PLA was developing “overseas logistical facilities” to “address deficiencies in overseas operations”, calling for a shift from “near coast active defence” to “far seas manoeuvring operations”. It claimed that China must establish its “perceived status as a Great Power” by advancing “China’s escalating global interests, particularly those associated with the BRI, including infrastructure, assets, personnel and control over sea lanes”. Moreover, China’s capstone doctrinal text, the Science of Military Strategy (2020 edition), highlights the “two Oceans” approach in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and the PLAN’s desire to “establish ourselves” in both by constructing “maritime strategic support points”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned senior official within the Investment Banking department at the CCB confirmed this, suggesting China is securing influence in Kenya as part of its effort to become a significant “ocean-faring nation”, constructing the port of Mombasa to be compatible with PLAN specifications. Indeed, the PLA Military Transport Academy suggests the dual use of Mombasa port could help solve the Malacca Dilemma by “reducing transport pressure and avoiding waterways that could be closed by adversaries”. Satellite imagery reveals the 245 m military-grade dock could berth two Type 056 corvettes and any surface combatant up to the Type 055D guided-missile destroyer. Additionally, it reveals the 164 m dock could accommodate one surface combatant up to the Type 052D destroyer, with the port also having the capacity to refuel most PLAN ships and act as a logistics hub for tankers directly facilitating the replenishment of PLAN ships in open waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The previously cautious consensus around Chinese financing motivations may no longer apply to the strengthening China of today&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLAN’s future ambitions for dual use of Angola’s deepwater Luanda Atlantic port reveal a similar story. In addition to the port of Lobito, Angola’s 1,600 km coastline has four other operational seaports, significant portions of which China has financed. A private military investigation found that Luanda port can accommodate Type 052D and 055 destroyers and most PLAN vessels for replenishment. In 2016, the Export-Import Bank of the Republic of China (CHEXIM) financed the China Energy Engineering Corporation to build Caio port in Cabinda, Angola’s first deepwater port. China-Sonangol is currently involved in constructing another deepwater Angolan facility, the Barra do Dande port 50 km north of Luanda, which will include 29 storage tanks, a container and multi-use terminal and a petroleum support zone. According to China Dialogue, China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) acquired a 30% stake in the Portuguese construction company Mota-Engil, which secured a 30-year concession on the port of Lobito. Moreover, a CLBrief report indicated that China International Trust Investment Corporation and Shandong Port Group secured a 20-year concession to manage and operate Angola’s port of Lobito multipurpose container and general cargo terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence provided by a regional director of a private intelligence firm showed that, via financing, China is seeking access and control over deepwater maritime ports on Africa’s Atlantic coast for commercial and military purposes. Secret PLAN documents revealed plans to link Chinese port financing to strategic military motivations in Angola, Kenya and 11 other countries. Indeed, China’s Djibouti military base disguises a more subtle Chinese military strategy of dual-use ports across the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ports on the Atlantic coast should perhaps raise the most concern in Washington. A traditional Chinese inter-continental ballistic missile has a range of about 6,000 km, meaning that it can be launched from eastern China to hit the west coast of the US. Chinese nuclear submarines can currently remain at sea for long periods, but they do not have the ability to obtain food and resupplies when operating in the Atlantic. Therefore, a resupply base on the African Atlantic coast would put Chinese submarines in range of New York, Washington DC and Atlanta. With Africa remaining an uncontested space for Chinese development financing, the US’s internal security is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, CHEXIM financed, and CCCC First Harbour Engineering Co built, Equatorial Guinea’s Bata deepwater port in 2006, with the China Road and Bridge Corp making significant updates in 2016. The CEO of a leading China-focused intelligence firm stated, “don’t be fooled by the lack of hard arms sales. China now owns 93 ports in 53 countries” including Nigeria, Tanzania and Namibia, with China’s Ambassador to Namibia calling Walvis Bay port the “most brilliant pearl” on Africa’s Atlantic coast. Of African BRI countries, 70% are located on the north, east, west or south coast with key investments made in ports near the Gulf of Aden and the Suez Canal, including Djibouti port, Port Sudan, Port Said–Port Tewfik, Ain Sokhna port, Zarzis port, El Hamdania port and the newly financed and commissioned Lekki deep seaport in Lagos, West Africa’s largest. Ultimately, the dual-use model allows China to downplay the military significance of its port investments, while providing access to several military facilities. The Economic Times reported that a total of 46 African ports have been built or financed – or are currently operated – by Chinese state-owned shipping corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite such developments, existential alarmism when analysing these findings would be premature. An important caveat is that the above analysis assumes peacetime conditions. In conflict, China will find protecting port infrastructure and negotiating access to be crucial stumbling blocks to its dual-use port model. Protecting the aforementioned ports from incoming enemy fire – especially without adequate missile defence systems, bunkers and existent fortified supply depots for fuel and munitions, would involve increasingly complex military planning of a scale and capability that the Chinese military complex does not yet possess. Moreover, any Chinese troop movement (such as reinforcements) would require significant negotiations with the host country. As such, troublesome coercion tactics against countries that China relies on for supply routes (such as Angola or Kenya) would be risky and unproven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Africa provides an important and long-standing model for China’s global financing efforts. The previously cautious consensus around Chinese financing motivations may no longer apply to the strengthening China of today. Over a 20-year period, Chinese financing within sub-Saharan Africa has significantly bolstered Beijing’s “sanction-proof” supply chain resilience and dual port maritime strength, perhaps enhancing its ability to raise geopolitical tensions or conduct territorial expansion (such as against Taiwan). Yet, serious complications around the execution of such a strategy outside of peacetime conditions remain pertinent. As the US–China relationship moves into stormier waters, China will continue to expand its naval reach and supply chain resilience, particularly as its declining economic surplus will see it concentrate financing on geostrategically important locations off the Atlantic coast and in the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines several scenarios in which democratic governments might consider using deepfakes to advance their foreign policy objectives. It argues that officials should consider the following factors: (1) the likely efficacy of the deepfake, (2) its audience, (3) the potential harms, (4) the legal implications, (5) the nature of the target, (6) the goal of the deepfake, and (7) the traceability of the deepfake back to the originating democratic government. In general, the authors argue that deepfakes should not be used as they are likely to reduce the credibility of democratic governments if their use is discovered, though there may be rare circumstances when their use deserves serious consideration. This paper also proposes a process for approving or rejecting deepfakes that ensures that a wide variety of perspectives are brought to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2022, a fake video of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky telling his soldiers to lay down their arms was posted on a Ukrainian website. The video also appeared on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and a host of Russian channels. A similar video shared on the social platform Telegram surfaced in November 2023 in which the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, General Valery Zaluzhny, is heard making a similar speech. Other fake videos of Zelensky show him sporting a swastika and appearing in a Pride parade. Widely believed to have been created and disseminated by Russia, these fakes reflect the use of advanced information technology methods to covertly influence warfare and shape the broader information environment in Russia’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This state of affairs is only likely to worsen with the rapid proliferation of deepfakes, or artificial images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), as well as manipulable digital media in general. As AI has improved, deepfakes have gone from primitive to highly realistic, and they will only get harder to distinguish. (A representative list of some popular tools for generating synthetic artifacts is provided in the appendix.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proliferation of AI provides an unparalleled opportunity for state actors to use deepfakes for national security purposes. In addition to the Zelensky and Zaluzhny videos, there have been numerous uses of deepfake technology in the context of politics and international conflict. In May 2023, deepfake videos claimed to show the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) terror group endorsing Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the main opposition candidate for the Turkish presidency. Another deepfake against an opposition candidate, this time allegedly pornographic, led him to step down from the presidential race. In January 2024, a robocall that faked President Joe Biden’s voice advised New Hampshire residents not to vote in the presidential primary. There are reports that the Venezuelan government used deepfake technology (specifically the Synthesia tool shown in the appendix) to generate deepfakes of news anchors portraying the Venezuelan economy in glowing terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Synthesia product was also reportedly used to generate videos supportive of the 2022 coup in Burkina Faso. Initial versions allowed users to use their own visual likeness or an avatar to generate a video in the voice of the individual portrayed. Recent updates can convert “text-based sources [inputs] into full-fledged synthetic videos in a matter of minutes.” However, unscrupulous individuals may use similar technology to generate highly realistic videos of nonconsenting individuals. It is therefore only a matter of time before politicians, military leaders, and others are falsely accused, through weaponized audio and video, of participating in acts they never carried out. These deepfakes may include made-up speeches, fake murders, and other provocative acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, deepfakes have been used for various legitimate purposes, labeled here as “beneficial deepfakes.” One example is the set of deepfakes of soccer superstar David Beckham, who was portrayed supporting an antimalaria message in which he speaks in a host of foreign languages; the visual content is real, but the audio is not. These messages, created by Synthesia, were presumably generated with his consent. An Indian politician had previously used a similar idea to create deepfake videos of his own political speeches in 20 languages using his own voice, enabling him to share his political message more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will the lure of deepfakes, whether beneficial or malign, prove irresistible to democratic governments? If the past is a guide, the answer seems to be a resounding yes. Photoshop and similar tools have long allowed the easy editing of images, and deepfakes bring this phenomenon to a new level. September 2022 saw reports of the U.S. military using fake Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts to promote a pro-Western message in Central Asia and the Middle East. In February 2023, leaked documents revealed the U.S. military may be actively seeking to run covert overseas influence campaigns that use deepfakes to “generate messages and influence operations via non-traditional channels.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Will the lure of deepfakes, whether beneficial or malign, prove irresistible to democratic governments? If the past is a guide, the answer seems to be a resounding yes.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will not be long before major democracies, including the United States, start or at least consider using deepfakes to achieve their ends, if they have not already done so. This paper examines hypothetical cases in which deepfakes might be used and argues that deepfakes should not be used without a clearly articulated set of guardrails that consider both the benefits and the risks of a proposed government-run deepfake-enabled operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is need for an unbiased evaluation of the trade-off between the short-term benefits and long-term risks of a hypothetical deepfake campaign by a democratic nation. Moreover, a transparent and publicly articulated process is required for performing such evaluations, even if the details of a specific deepfake or deepfake campaign are classified. To these ends, this paper focuses on answering two fundamental questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; are the right questions to ask when a government agency contemplates using deepfakes to further its mission?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who&lt;/strong&gt; should be responsible for asking these questions and who should approve or reject a request to use a deepfake or perform a deepfake campaign? What processes and governance mechanisms should these people use when contemplating deepfake use in military and intelligence settings?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, this paper presents five hypothetical security-related scenarios a democratic government might confront. The authors conducted interviews with six leaders who have expert knowledge in both AI technology and national defense. These include a retired U.S. general, a retired U.S. intelligence agency chief, a leading EU think tank employee working in disinformation and technology, a senior tech company executive, a retired general from Asia, and a former senior lawyer at the White House and National Security Council (NSC). The authors engaged in a discussion with each of these experts on the what and who questions listed above. This report summarizes the authors’ methods and findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper argues democratic governments should consider several issues before they deploy deepfakes. First, how effective is the deepfake likely to be, especially if other methods are available? Second, will the deepfake be visible to a narrow audience (e.g., just the inner circle of a foreign terrorist organization) or a broad one (such as an entire country or the citizens in the government’s own country)? Third, could the deepfake harm innocent civilians, distorting their views on important issues? Fourth, does the proposed deepfake use comply with applicable international law? Fifth, is the deepfake portraying a truly prominent and influential person, such as a president or religious or social leader, or is it portraying a less important person? Sixth, is the deepfake part of a tit-for-tat process or to protect a country’s people from immediate harm, or is there a lesser goal? Finally, how likely is it that a deepfake will be traced back to the home country, with potentially profound repercussions for a government’s relationship with its own people? To answer these questions, the authors recommend a deepfake equities process that brings together a range of stakeholders to determine whether the deepfake should be used, with the initial presumption being that, in general, deepfakes should not be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-risks-for-democratic-governments&quot;&gt;Potential Risks for Democratic Governments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A previous report by two of the authors on this topic details the potential uses of deepfakes in conflict settings as well as the costs and risks. Several risks are worth noting for democratic governments in particular. The loss of trust that the population of a democratic nation has in both offline and online media and news sources will be the first casualty, making it easier for adversaries to sow disinformation that divides a target population and for antigovernment domestic actors to use the deepfake to degrade public trust in the government. This loss of trust, in turn, may allow such adversaries to influence elections, reduce support for the target nation’s military and diplomatic activities, encourage riots and internal conflict, sway stock markets, and more. As democracies depend on open communication and informed voters, anything that interferes with these concepts — such as deepfakes — should be viewed with concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As democracies depend on open communication and informed voters, anything that interferes with these concepts — such as deepfakes — should be viewed with concern.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second major long-term risk of the use of deepfakes is the loss of credibility of the government that uses them. Once a government can be credibly accused of using lies as an instrument of state policy, the value of any statements they make could be diminished for years, if not decades, at home as well as abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, adversaries may benefit from the “liar’s dividend,” wherein they can explain away real evidence of corruption or abuse by claiming the information is fake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors created five scenarios in which a democratic government may be tempted to intervene. These five scenarios were shared with six leaders in the national security sector from three regions: the United States, the European Union, and Asia. The leaders represented four types of stakeholders: intelligence, military, industry, and nongovernmental organizations with an interest in the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;election-scenario&quot;&gt;Election Scenario&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Country X is rich in oil, minerals, and other natural resources and has a government that is not friendly to Western countries. The leader of Country X is an unsavory character responsible for human rights abuses and linked to international terrorist groups. In the aftermath of recent elections, Country X is experiencing political instability, with many protests and moderate and pro-Western leaders credibly contending the election was stolen from them. In the midst of ongoing instability, intelligence agencies propose to use deepfakes showing the leader of Country X thanking a Western diplomat for sending him money, receiving a payoff from a wealthy national of Country X, laughing at the deaths of citizens of Country X in protests, and ordering ballot boxes to be stuffed with fraudulent ballots. The intelligence agencies hope this will discredit him and contribute to his downfall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is intended to address a common foreign policy challenge: an adversarial government that is also repressive to its own people. Such governments often threaten U.S. and allied interests and harm their own people, though rarely do they pose a grave threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;genocide-scenario&quot;&gt;Genocide Scenario&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Country Z is run by a small cabal whose leader (L1) is planning a genocide of a minority group that constitutes about 15 percent of the population. Unbeknownst to L1, his intelligence chief (L2) has had discussions with Western governments about the future of the country, including turning against his boss, possibly to save himself or to gain power. He wants your government’s help overthrowing the leader, preventing a genocide, and becoming the leader of a government that will be better and more closely aligned with Western principles. The time has come to overthrow L1. To do so, your country’s intelligence agency has generated deepfake videos of L1 boasting about the amount of money he has stolen from the treasury and stating that most members of the majority group are stupid and will have to follow him even though the minority group poses no threat. Western intelligence agencies hope that this deepfake will reduce L1’s support among the population of Country Z and enable L2 to gain enough momentum to take over and avert genocide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is designed to test responses in one of the worst situations imaginable: the deliberate mass killing of civilians. Historically, the United States and other Western governments have not intervened effectively in such situations. Deepfakes offer one means of intervention that leaders might turn to in such a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;invasion-scenario&quot;&gt;Invasion Scenario&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Country R is mobilizing its military forces and preparing to invade a small neighbor. Western intelligence learns Country R is preparing deepfake videos that show that its neighbor’s troops fired first at Country R’s forces and that the small state’s leaders were planning to oppress ethnic citizens living in Country R. Your government considers releasing a fake video of Country R’s leader boasting about creating fake videos and how easily he can fool his own people into believing what he wants. The hope is that the fake video will preemptively discredit Country R’s fake videos and decrease the popularity of Country R’s leader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this situation, the deepfake is being used in response to other fake videos — an attempt to fight fire with fire — in a situation involving potential war and human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stock-market-scenario&quot;&gt;Stock Market Scenario&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A criminal hacker group has released a deepfake video of a corporate billionaire saying his company’s latest research has not panned out and that such efforts are not likely to come to fruition for the next 5–10 years. The company stock crashes, along with related stocks, and the hackers reap huge rewards. The billionaire is politically connected, and he reaches out to his government (Western Country X), demanding it help prevent this foreign attack from destabilizing the market and ensure other companies (especially his) are safe. Desperate to stabilize the market and prevent contagion, Country X decides to release a deepfake video of a known critic of the company saying the report is false and the technology is sound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine if government use of deepfakes is appropriate outside a traditional security context, this scenario explores a different situation: a private citizen and a company seeking assistance. In addition, the information in this deepfake is at least partially true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intellectual-property-theft-scenario&quot;&gt;Intellectual Property Theft Scenario&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Company C is a world leader in the pharmaceutical industry. It invests massive amounts of money in the design of new drugs for a variety of diseases. Company C has been previously hacked and is fearful the designs for a new blockbuster drug will be stolen by adverse nation-states. It designs deepfake materials (text documents, images, videos, PowerPoints) that are close enough to the real design to appear highly credible, even to experts, but are flawed enough that the designs do not work. The idea is that an adversary who steals a fake design will execute the design and waste an immense amount of time and money developing a product that does not work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last scenario explores another commercial use of deepfakes. In this case, the deepfake is defensive and may never be seen by anyone other than its creators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;questions-to-ask-if-and-when-governments-contemplate-using-deepfakes&quot;&gt;Questions to Ask If and When Governments Contemplate Using Deepfakes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the experts interviewed expressed deep concerns about governments using deepfakes. They were united in their view that deepfakes should be used only in limited settings and under authorization from appropriate authorities. However, there were differences in their opinions about when deepfakes should be used, which scenarios were appropriate, how they should be used, and who should authorize their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the interviews, Figure 1 summarizes the key questions that should be asked when a government contemplates the use of a deepfake. These questions address (1) the likely efficacy of the deepfake, (2) its audience, (3) the potential harms, (4) the legal implications, (5) the nature of the target, (6) the goal of the deepfake, and (7) the traceability of the deepfake back to the originating democratic government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-efficacy&quot;&gt;1. Efficacy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the intended purpose of the deepfake? Will using the deepfake achieve the desired purpose? Are there other ways to achieve the intended goal that do not involve deception?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deepfakes may fail to achieve their goals or may make only a marginal difference. As an example, consider the election scenario. A senior intelligence official might believe that generating a deepfake of the unsavory leader will lead to his downfall. However, the reality might not be so simple. The leader may (correctly) argue the video is a deepfake created to tarnish his image. He might additionally invoke the specter of a U.S. or other foreign takeover of the country and argue that the deepfake is an attempt to grab control of the country’s mineral wealth, creating a nationalistic backlash against the United States in favor of the dictator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WVlVrQK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Deepfake Use by Governments: The Questions to Consider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or consider the genocide scenario, where the leader of Country Z is planning to kill many members of the country’s ethnic minority. In the long run, it may be wiser to disclose true evidence of the leader’s plans, as well as evidence pointing to prior acts of ethnic cleansing he might have carried out at a smaller scale. An influence campaign that puts out honest information, such as via the country’s cell phone network, might be less easily refutable by the leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there may be reasons to use a deepfake to make accurate but inaccessible acts more apparent. In the context of this scenario, a retired non-U.S. military leader argued,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If the deepfake is replicating something where it is difficult to get videos of actual facts and you make a video that is based on the truth to avoid something worse from happening, in those cases I would say it is justified as long as it is based on the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewee added,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anything based on falsity is not likely to be effective. If you base your narratives on the truth and use deepfakes to protect the truth, it will be effective. Otherwise, it will eventually be exposed and be ineffective and lead to loss of credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, at least during times of extreme danger, interviewees expressed some support for the use of deepfakes when they are merely representations of the truth, even if the video is itself fake. But also consider that how to represent “the truth” may not be so straightforward, particularly in contentious situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the intellectual property (IP) theft scenario, the deepfake is intended to have an effect only after a criminal act is performed (i.e., the theft of the IP). Only after the criminal act happens does the deepfake impose costs on the IP thief. Such costs include inducing delays in the IP thieves’ projects, inducing additional uncertainty in the thieves’ minds about whether the stolen material is real or fake, and frustrating adversaries. Also, there is less risk of the deepfake reaching a broader audience that then accepts it as true. All but one interviewee was enthusiastic about the use of deepfakes in this scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the stock market scenario, a former senior White House official stated the critic portrayed in the deepfake would “immediately jump up and deny” they ever made the statement. Such a quick and emphatic denial might blunt any desired outcome of the deepfake and could cause volatility that makes the situation worse, further undermining the credibility of those who endorse the deepfake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-audience&quot;&gt;2. Audience&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who is the target audience for the deepfake? Is it a domestic audience? A highly focused audience? Or is the deepfake expected to reach a large number of people?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key question when contemplating the use of a deepfake is whether it can be disseminated so that only a small, focused group of people end up seeing it. Multiple experts pointed out that once a deepfake is in the public domain, it may spread rapidly and uncontrollably. One retired U.S. military officer said, “The idea that you will produce some deepfake material and then it will only play in the specific context for the specific audience is really difficult. You can’t control it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for example, if an intelligence agency were to generate a deepfake of two senior Russian security officials, such as Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) chief Sergey Naryshkin and General Valery Gerasimov, discussing something potentially treasonous and then strategically leak it to Russian president Vladimir Putin, the audience for such a deepfake would be very small. The deepfake would not deceive the entire Russian population or other large audiences. In this regard, a former senior White House attorney said, “Deepfakes should not leak into the bloodstream of the internet. . . . [If there are going to be] lots of eyeballs on a deepfake, don’t go there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A key question when contemplating the use of a deepfake is whether it can be disseminated so that only a small, focused group of people end up seeing it.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is difficult to anticipate the size of the audience affected by a deepfake. In the above example, only a few people might initially view the deepfake, but if they act on this “intelligence,” believing it to be true, they might take actions that affect millions of people. One interviewee expressed concern that even if such use of a deepfake were successful, the truth might leak months or years into the future. For example, a prominent news outlet such as the New York Times might write a piece titled “How the Biden Administration Fooled Putin” six or twelve months after the deepfake was used. Such a story might severely compromise real evidence the United States offers in future national security situations. Given that clandestine U.S. operations and collection methods regularly leak, it is plausible, even likely, that reports of deepfake use would leak too. In addition, as deepfake detection technology improves, a deepfake used today might be uncovered in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All interviewees agreed that governments should not try to use deepfakes to influence their own population. As a retired non-U.S. official at the level of general stated, “If we are using cognitive means against anybody, you should not misinfluence your own population.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there was some support for using deepfakes generated in a foreign language, making it unlikely the majority of the U.S. population would understand the content of the deepfake, though the use of subtitles or automated translation tools could easily change this. Further, the images themselves might be easily understood even without audio translation. One corporate leader with deep expertise in AI said, “Is there a risk to the domestic population if a deepfake used in a foreign country uses a foreign language? Yes, and [it] still needs guardrails if it gets to the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a government deploys a deepfake overseas, even in a foreign language, is there still a risk it will affect the domestic population? If a deepfake directed at an overseas population emphasizes rising crime in that country or other social problems, it might influence travel blogs, social media commentary, or other information that would affect whether Americans travel to a part of the world. It might even influence U.S. immigration policy and attitudes toward the country in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important question to consider is, Who are the possible beneficiaries of the deepfake’s use? The country’s citizens as a whole? A specific individual, company, or industrial sector? In the case of the stock market scenario, the direct beneficiaries are limited. All interview subjects were united in the view that the government should not be in the business of helping individuals or private corporations foster lies to the population, even if the request for help comes due to an attack by a foreign state. In the stock market scenario, the billionaire could, as a citizen, ask the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) (or the equivalent for other democratic governments) for help in investigating the origins and perpetrators of the deepfake that targeted him rather than ask the government to run deepfakes to correct the market, which would deceive the American people and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;3-harms&quot;&gt;3. Harms&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who might be harmed by the deepfake? What is the probability the deepfake will harm innocent civilians?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All subjects interviewed were deeply concerned a deepfake might harm innocent civilians. According to one interview subject, “There should be no unintended harm to civilians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the election, genocide, and invasion scenarios, the goal of the deepfake is to destabilize an abhorrent leader. The main people likely to be directly harmed are the despicable leader and the leader’s close supporters. However, if the deepfake leads to civil unrest (e.g., if people rise up against the leader), then protesters may be injured or killed. Then the leader might simply be replaced by another leader with similar or more extreme goals. The use of the deepfake might lead to the deaths of innocent civilians but not avert the threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shared goal in the election, genocide, and invasion scenarios is to discredit or destabilize the leader. But what if the leader escalates the scenario out of fear, paranoia, perceived self-defense, or something else and cracks down on the population, a neighboring country, or the country perpetrating the deepfake? It is difficult to predict how an adversary would respond to the deepfake, and some responses could foster tremendous harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in the case of the IP theft scenario, harms may occur to innocent people. For instance, suppose a Chinese entity steals the design documents for a hypersonic missile from a U.S. company, and suppose that company had generated 99 fake versions of that design document by using a large language model or a system specifically focused on generating believable fake technical documents to deter IP theft. Further, suppose the entity responsible for the theft has analyzed all 100 versions of the document (1 real, 99 fake) and decided a specific version (v) is the real one. The assessment that v is real is incorrect (i.e., the deception by the victim company was successful). The IP thief executes on the design, but during testing, the missile blows up, killing six employees of the Chinese entity. In this case, the victim of the IP theft might argue it is not responsible as the deadly outcome was a direct consequence of a criminal act perpetrated by the Chinese entity and, hence, the Chinese entity should be held responsible for its misdeeds. All but one of the interviewees accepted this argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;4-legal&quot;&gt;4. Legal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will the contemplated use of a deepfake under the circumstances violate international law?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International law has a role to play when states use deepfakes in their interactions with other states. But how international law regulates cyberspace generally, much less deepfakes specifically, lacks clarity. States, experts, and scholars have debated for more than a decade how international law applies to activities in cyberspace. While areas of agreement have emerged, several published positions reveal the many divisions and uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining how international law applies to deepfakes raises new issues beyond those that scholars focus on when analyzing cyberattacks. Peter B. M. J. Pijpers, when analyzing influence operations, describes cyberspace as consisting of three dimensions: physical, virtual, and cognitive. International law, like most law, focuses on the physical world. For example, if foreign actors enter another state and surreptitiously destroy election ballots before they are counted, this would be a clear violation of the state’s sovereignty and the principle of nonintervention. With the advent of the internet, however, a state can affect activities in another state through a virtual dimension without entering another state’s physical world. These virtual activities can result in direct physical impacts — for example, hacking that causes the destruction of computers and other physical devices. These virtual activities can also cause virtual damage, such as manipulating voting tallies on a machine or in a database, which might be considered analogous to physical effects when analyzed under traditional international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deepfakes, which are deployed in the virtual dimension but are focused on having an impact in the cognitive dimension of cyberspace, present new challenges for international law. Given the recent emergence of deepfakes, it is not surprising that the body of literature on this topic is small. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this paper, the authors can outline at a high level the principles and rules most likely to apply and that states should consider when deepfakes are used in the national security context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Deepfakes, which are deployed in the virtual dimension but are focused on having an impact in the cognitive dimension of cyberspace, present new challenges for international law.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before analyzing the hypotheticals presented, it is important to recognize that a state’s use of deepfakes will involve far more than simply creating the deepfake. For example, states will have specific goals, and consideration of the context will play an important role in the legal analysis. States will also decide how to deploy the deepfake or campaign of deepfakes using specific social media channels or other methods of publishing and disseminating content. States might hack social media accounts, news organizations, or other organizations, including in the targeted state, to disseminate content. Or states might deploy individuals in the targeted state to carry out these or related activities. These examples illustrate some of the context that should be considered when a state uses deepfakes. Considering the context will greatly inform the analysis of whether the activities related to a state’s use of deepfakes complies with applicable international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, it will be useful for states to consider whether the use of deepfakes involves use of force, the threat of force, intervention in the domestic affairs of another state, or violation of the sovereignty of another state. When engaged in armed conflict, states cannot engage in perfidy, which applies to “acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence.” Michael N. Schmitt in the Tallinn Manual 2.0, a compilation of expert views on the application of international law to cyber operations, provides an example of perfidy: “Consider the case of a perfidious email inviting the enemy to a meeting with a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross, but which is actually intended to lead enemy forces into an ambush.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast perfidy with a “ruse” of war, which is not prohibited. According to the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions (Protocol I), ruses are acts that are “intended to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but which infringe no rule of international law applicable in armed conflict and which are not perfidious because they do not invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under that law.” Protocol I provides traditional examples of ruses such as “use of camouflage, decoys, mock operations and misinformation.” The Tallinn Manual 2.0 provides several examples of ruses, including simulating nonexistent forces, transmitting false information showing operations beginning, feigned cyberattacks, bogus orders purportedly issued by the enemy, and transmitting false intelligence information intended for interception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Protocol I, states must also consider that “in the conduct of military operations, constant care shall be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects.” The Tallinn Manual 2.0 states, “The term ‘spare’ refers to the broad general duty to ‘respect’ the civilian population, that is, to consider deleterious effects of military operations on civilians.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the propriety of using deepfakes, a state may have considered the prior activities of the target state, which may have precipitated a response. For example, proportional countermeasures may be appropriate even when not engaged in armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of armed conflict settings, the principle of sovereignty prohibits acts that “interfere with, or usurp, an inherently governmental act or cause such effects on the territory.” Protected governmental acts include elections, crisis management, and national security. The following analysis of the scenarios begins with sovereignty as it “is a foundational principle of international law.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International law scholars generally do not view cyber espionage as a violation of sovereignty, and some contend this even when such activities take place within another state’s territory or cause territorial effects. Eric Talbot Jensen writes that these scholars “for instance . . . are of the view that remote cyber activities that violate domestic law on espionage would not, in themselves, violate international law.” Some states argue that sovereignty is not a rule but a foundational principle on which the use-of-force and nonintervention principles are based, meaning that noncoercive cyber operations and deepfakes would not violate international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While often discussed together, sovereignty and nonintervention must be differentiated, as sovereignty focuses on territorial control and governmental acts and does not require coercion. Nonintervention is seen to emanate from sovereignty. Nonintervention “prohibits States from engaging in coercive interference, directly or indirectly, with the domestic affairs of another State.” Case law illustrates the application of nonintervention as a customary rule. The International Court of Justice has defined the protected affairs of a state, known as the domaine réservé, as “the choice of a political, economic, social, and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy.” According to Pijpers, “The domaine réservé . . . is the area ‘in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonintervention requires coercion, but coercion lacks a universal standard and is not well defined. Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts state, “To constitute intervention, the interference must be forcible or dictatorial, or otherwise coercive; in effect depriving the State intervened against of control over the matter in question.” Schmitt defines coercive action as “intended to cause the State to do something, such as take a decision that it would otherwise not take, or not to engage in an activity in which it would otherwise engage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Schmitt, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 says that states should also consider due diligence, or their obligation “to ensure that their territory is not used as a location from which cyber operations having serious adverse consequences for the target State are launched.” But this would not require a state to monitor or prevent cyber operations, only to stop them when the state has notice. Many states, however, reject the notion that due diligence is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to the hypotheticals, how might international law principles and rules apply to a country’s use of deepfakes? A country using deepfakes would intend to cause a specific outcome and would undertake action to disseminate the deepfakes, providing many additional facts to inform the legal analysis. Even without these additional facts in hand, one could consider the international law principles and rules that might apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the election scenario, targeting an election — an inherently governmental function — implicates the principle of sovereignty. A certain magnitude of state action is required to violate another state’s sovereignty, but neither physical damage nor loss of functionality is required when an inherent government function is involved. Additionally, propaganda aimed to influence an election result, which could possibly describe the activity in the election scenario, is usually allowed. Likewise, for the nonintervention principle to apply, the use of the deepfake would need to be coercive, which seems unlikely based on the facts described. Thus, the country’s use of a deepfake in this scenario might not run afoul of international law, depending on the country’s intent and other facts that would emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the genocide scenario, the clear human rights violations may justify the use of deepfakes, notwithstanding principles of sovereignty and nonintervention, particularly when neither leader seems to enjoy legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the invasion scenario, the contemplated deepfake would not have a direct impact in the target country and is likely to be seen as propaganda that does not implicate the principles of sovereignty or nonintervention. If the deepfake leads to an indirect coercive impact in the target state and the state that used the deepfake intends to cause this coercive impact, a majority of experts in the Tallinn Manual 2.0 take the position this would violate the principle of nonintervention. In the scenario for this paper, the authors have not ascribed any such intent to the state using the deepfake. In the invasion scenario, there may also be a humanitarian justification for intervening. The deepfake could also be justified as a countermeasure, though experts are split on whether a non-injured state can undertake countermeasures on behalf of another state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the stock market scenario, it is unclear whether other states will be affected by the deepfake and thus whether and how international law should apply. To the extent it is relevant, cyberattacks that result in economic damages may give rise to a countermeasure claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the IP theft scenario, if only private actors are affected, international law likely has no role. In this instance, the harm occurred only because a counterparty committed the wrongful act of stealing Company C’s IP. In an extreme case, if the home country is aware of Company C’s actions and there is a high likelihood of harm to another country, under the due diligence doctrine the home country might be obligated to take appropriate action to stop these acts. Even then, many states do not accept the due diligence doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;5-target&quot;&gt;5. Target&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who or what is the intended target of the deepfake? Is it the president of a country or a prominent person such as a political or religious leader? Is it a living person?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the invasion scenario. Suppose an intelligence agency wants to create a deepfake of President Putin saying something false. The bar for approving such a deepfake should be the highest possible. In the United States, it might require approval from the president, while in some EU countries, the approving authority might be a prime minister, especially if the deepfake were to be disseminated widely in Russia and beyond. To quote one interviewee, a retired U.S. military leader at the level of general or higher, “Deepfakes of a national leader would need presidential approval under a finding from the White House.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another U.S. military leader at the level of general or higher stated that U.S. presidents may be deeply reluctant to approve the use of deepfakes to target the leader of a foreign nation because of the precedent it would set: “A POTUS tends to think a lot about precedent — are we creating the right precedents? Subordinates tend to be more focused on objectives.” The same individual went on to say, “The slippery slope argument is very strong, and the costs may be higher than we anticipate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the election and genocide scenarios, one corporate leader said, “If a human rights abuser uses a deepfake, I can see doing a lot of other deepfakes to discredit the first (e.g., 100 variations) to educate people.” Simply put, if the leaders of the two countries involved in these scenarios use deepfakes, then targeting them with deepfakes might be considered an appropriate response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the deepfake portrays a fictional version of a real event occurring on the ground (e.g., a genocide) for which there is compelling evidence, then disseminating a deepfake image or video representing the event may be fair because (1) the event is real and compelling evidence (perhaps nonvisual) exists; (2) there may not be real, compelling imagery or video because anyone capturing such imagery would be killed or placed in harm’s way; and (3) no single world leader is being explicitly portrayed in the deepfake. Thus, some of the interviewees were comfortable with disseminating a deepfake image of a burial pit with bodies to illustrate what is really happening in a country at war. Nevertheless, such use has risks. For instance, how does the government creating the deepfake know its portrayal of the burial pits is consistent with reality? Will the use of a deepfake backfire, convincing people that the real burial pits are nonexistent because a deepfake was used? Considerable effort would be needed to ensure the deepfake accurately represents, and is believed by the public to be, the reported reality. In addition, both civil society and investigative journalist groups such as Bellingcat often offer their own highly credible reports, which is vital in democratic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another alternative is to release the deepfake publicly but clearly label it a deepfake. In essence, the deepfake would be a dramatization of real events, which frequently occurs in documentaries and films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the subject of a deepfake is living or dead also should matter. A dead person cannot lose power or money or otherwise suffer harm. On the other hand, consider that others close to the dead person may be harmed. The deniability of the deepfake is also affected, as the person in question cannot simply say the video is fake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;6-goal&quot;&gt;6. Goal&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the goal of the deepfake? Is it intended to protect the nation’s citizens from immediate harm? Is it a tit-for-tat response to deepfake use by another government? Is it intended to educate a given population about deepfakes and suggest they be wary of any content they see?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviewees largely agreed it was acceptable for governments to use deepfakes under three circumstances: an immediate threat, a tit-for-tat response, or education and discrediting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immediate threat.&lt;/strong&gt; At least one U.S. military leader felt using a deepfake in response to an immediate threat was potentially acceptable as long as no other measures were available to defeat the threat. However, he cautioned,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The deepfake is still not something I would do unless there is an imminent threat because there are all these other tools you can use rather than try to put words in the mouths of these leaders, and the potential for boomerang is still too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, an immediate threat might constitute one set of circumstances where deepfakes could be used. For instance, in the case of the genocide scenario, there may be members of the minority group who are U.S. citizens living in the country where the potential genocide would occur. As in the case of the Rwandan genocide of 1994, a U.S. president may be deeply reluctant to deploy U.S. troops to avert the genocide, and the presence of UN peacekeepers may not be useful. In such cases, it might make sense to use deepfakes to avert the genocide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the deepfake does not necessarily need to be believable in the long term. In the genocide scenario (or in cases of military deception), the deepfake could be circulated among the target state’s leaders to misguide them into leaving a certain area exposed, allowing the at-risk population to be evacuated. However, the use of deepfakes in the invasion scenario may not make sense if the potential for retaliatory deepfakes or a kinetic response by the country in question is high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tit for tat.&lt;/strong&gt; Would it be acceptable for the United States to use deepfakes in retaliation for deepfake use by a foreign government? One non-U.S. military leader saw nothing wrong in doing so: “Tit-for-tat countering may be OK. . . . If an adversary is trying to create strategic effects in the victim nation, then the way international law is framed, in the interim, I would say the same logic should apply.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corporate leader likewise supported tit-for-tat use of deepfakes. He advocated a “no-first-use policy” but said “it is OK to respond in kind to use by a bad guy.” He went on to say that he was “OK with using deepfakes defensively,” and in such a case the actors “must flood the internet when such deepfakes are deployed, as one message doesn’t work well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, according to both these experts, in the case of the Zelensky video referenced earlier, it would have been acceptable for Ukraine to target Putin not just with one retaliatory deepfake but with a large number, presumably as a deterrent for future deepfake use by Russia. Appropriate authorities must answer the question of what constitutes a number that is large but not so large that it is escalatory. Such an effort, however, might poison the internet even further, perhaps to the detriment of billions of ordinary users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best response to a foreign deepfake may be other cyber means. A former senior White House attorney and NSC member stated that if Russia is spreading deepfakes inside the United States, the United States should “get out in front of Russia’s deepfakes and punch down the story.” The interviewee was also supportive of “shut[ting] down Russia’s efforts to create/spread the deepfakes using cyber tools.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education/discrediting.&lt;/strong&gt; Can a deepfake be used to show how convincing deepfakes can be? Can AI-generated deepfakes be used to educate a population and make them understand they should not trust everything they see? One industry expert stated the use of deepfakes to educate the population about deepfakes is perfectly acceptable. This interviewee, who has in-depth knowledge about YouTube’s policies, remarked,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Educational use — don’t believe what you see — is OK. For example, YouTube approved a deepfake of “[the] pope in [a] puff jacket” if it was posted for educational purposes but would block it if it was used as an ad or in a way intended to create harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, when deepfakes are used for educational purposes, they should be clearly marked as deepfakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;7-traceability&quot;&gt;7. Traceability&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the probability of the deepfake being traced back to the creator? What will the blowback be in the event it is attributed to the government that created it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a government uses deepfakes in pursuit of its goals, the interviewees felt several questions must be asked: Will the deepfake be detected by other actors? How severe will the repercussions of the deepfake likely be, if they are publicly attributed to the country that created and distributed it? Will it implicate third parties (e.g., if Israel uses a deepfake, will it implicate the United States)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experts had deep concerns about detectability and blowback. One U.S. military leader at the level of general or higher stated the importance of intelligence tradecraft: “If we do this, can they trace it back to us? Is there something inherently identifying that is traceable back to us?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another U.S. military leader said the amount of blowback “should be linked to the approval process all the way up to the NSC.” Simply put, a deepfake, especially one of a foreign leader, may need very high levels of approval up to the highest levels of the U.S. government. He went on to posit a hypothetical scenario: “Suppose a Silicon Valley firm releases a deepfake of Xi Jinping. What about his reaction? They would blame the USA. This is coming.” This suggests the need for a more compelling set of guardrails against corporate and individual use of deepfakes to target foreign states or their leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a former senior White House and NSC lawyer stated, “If a covert action finding had previously been approved, then the CIA alone would decide if deepfakes should be used.” Speaking on the same topic, a non-U.S. military leader said, “Who created the deepfake doesn’t matter. It is about who is endorsing and authenticating it.” Thus, in the case of a Silicon Valley company releasing a deepfake, the military leader suggested the U.S. government should not endorse the deepfake or distribute it in any way, even if it represents a reality. Perhaps, in this case, the U.S. government’s immediate action should be to disavow the corporate deepfake and immediately take action to hold those responsible to account to the fullest extent of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;who-should-manage-a-deepfake-equities-process&quot;&gt;Who Should Manage a Deepfake Equities Process?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above questions are important to ask — but equally important is who is asking them. Democratic countries should create a deepfake equities commission (DEC) to weigh the answers to these questions. The following is a discussion of how this might work in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DEC should be a White House–run interagency working group chaired by an NSC senior director. It should include one representative from each of the Departments of Defense, Justice, State, and Treasury as well as a representative from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to ensure that different perspectives are brought together. In addition to these national security and legal perspectives, it is necessary to bring in representatives who can weigh the domestic effects — something outside the traditional national security realm — which may require bringing in an appropriately cleared representative from civil society to represent the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the novelty of deepfakes and their potentially broad effects on the American people, any recommendation for deepfake use by the U.S. government should be approved by the president. Should deepfake use become more common, it is plausible there may be established categories for use that are preapproved, but for the initial stages and possibly beyond, their importance and the precedent they might set require the highest level of approval. Similarly, if deepfakes are used as part of an ongoing conflict, authority may be delegated to the secretary of defense or another high-ranking subordinate until clear use categories are established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries will have different institutional arrangements, but the same basic principles should hold. Different parts of the government representing different commercial and security perspectives should be brought together, as should individuals representing the informational health of the polity. Because of the novelty and potential impact of deepfakes, the top elected official, such as the prime minister in countries with a parliamentary system of government, should approve their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a situation arises where use of a deepfake might be considered, the relevant agency should present the use case, with particular detail not only on the immediate effects but also on the potential blowback to the home country’s people, allies, and the credibility of the government should the deepfake use be discovered. For example, if the goal is to discredit a foreign military official, the Department of Defense might propose a deepfake. The scenario would not only outline the content of the deepfake and its anticipated effects on the adversary’s military but also how it might shape public opinion inadvertently in the United States (or the home country contemplating deepfake use) and in allied countries. Officials from other agencies would weigh in on its legality, diplomatic consequences, and other ramifications. The designated official representing U.S. public opinion would also weigh how dangerous the information would be if it infected domestic discussion. Other officials might review its necessity, as there may be more traditional cyber or other operations that have a more established precedent that could achieve the same intended effects. Finally, all involved officials would discuss the implications for other policy goals if the United States were associated with deliberately promulgating false information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deepfakes are a new information tool, and it is important to think about their use and consequences now rather than wait to cobble together a policy following haphazard usage by U.S. government agencies or allied entities. This process is particularly important as deepfakes have profound consequences for the long-term credibility of any government and can shape and potentially worsen domestic political debates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is tempting to simply declare that a government will never use deepfakes, their potential power and reach make them attractive tools. Governments, however, may want to act — at times, for the best reasons — without thinking through the long-term implications of deepfake use. Thus, deepfakes must have a set of rules and criteria to guide their use and ensure governments are considering all relevant factors and long-term as well as short-term perspectives. For these rules to work in practice, governments must draw on a range of perspectives, including those beyond the traditional national security realm, when discussing deepfake use. Although the authors have presented some initial criteria, rich debate and observations on the use of deepfakes in practice by other governments will inform how to weigh these factors and what to add to ensure robust practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appendix&quot;&gt;Appendix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deepfake of a computational artifact (e.g., an image, a piece of text, or an audio or video clip) is a synthetic version of the artifact that is generated using advanced AI techniques. Machine learning classifiers have been trained for well over a decade to distinguish between real and fake artifacts. Since 2017, new generative AI techniques have created increasingly hard-to-detect fakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One popular technique, generative adversarial networks (GANs), considers the generation of fakes in terms of a game: A generator module in the GAN generates fake artifacts, while a discriminator module (a machine learning classifier) in the GAN tries to detect which of a set of artifacts (both real and fake) are fake. The discriminator reports the results, which the generator then uses as feedback to generate better fakes. This iterative process (generate-discriminate-feedback, generate-discriminate-feedback, and so on) continues until an equilibrium is reached and neither the generator nor the discriminator can substantially improve at its task in subsequent iterations. Numerous organizations worldwide have adapted and improved GANs and other AI techniques, such as Stable Diffusion, providing ready access to a huge number of AI tools capable of generating deepfakes for a wide variety of multimodal artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 presents a range of artifacts and generation tools that could be used to generate different kinds of deepfake content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Defence Diplomacy became a Defence Task in 1998, Defence Engagement (DE) only emerged in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). Concerns about warfighting were being displaced by “the realities and uncertainties of the 21st century” and a desire to target the causes of national security risks, rather than managing the consequences. DE would “shap(e) the environment, promoting the rules-based international order and preventing instability”. The 2015 Joint Doctrine Note (JDN) definition of DE – “using assets (short of combat operations) to generate influence” – rapidly expanded to include “capacity building, access, information and conflict prevention”, typically through High Level Engagements, Short Term Training Teams and Subject Matter Expert exchanges. Over time, “Engagement” became an accepted principle of UK security and a byword for the softer influence that Defence sought to exert through its operations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed. Despite there being clear water between DE and combat operations at its inception, the move to “Persistent Engagement” (PE) has seen a rapid growth in more kinetic partnerships focused on areas such as constraining poaching, drug trafficking and violent extremist organisations. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, warfighting is again the issue of the day. The Army has shrunk by 21%, becoming more stretched than ever. There is a frustration that DE hasn’t delivered, and it seems to be being side-lined; when the House of Commons Defence Committee recommended updating the JDN last year, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) response did not even include the term , referring only to Defence Diplomacy. The 2018 DE budget was £80 million, with the potential for more from the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF). By 2022–3, only £3.6 million was explicitly linked to it. Yet the requirement is still being articulated; the first characteristic of the “Engage” function in the Integrated Operating Concept (IOpC) is “assuring influence”. Accordingly, some force elements still appear firmly committed to DE; the Defence Medical Services have a significant DE-specific budget, UKStratCom has a regular 2* DE steering group, and a recent think tank meeting heard that “50% of the Fleet undertook DE activity in 2023”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DE’s problems lay not in the concept of leveraging influence to prevent and resist security threats. It lay in the definition of “influence”. There simply wasn’t one, even in the eponymous JDN. Even the IOpC didn’t define it, despite stating that we would “develop”, “regain”, “project”, “assure” (x2) and “secure” it. This recently led a Global Defence Network (GDN) colleague to say that it was “undefinable”. Lacking a clear “theory of victory” around influence, how could Defence construct strategies to deliver it, or know if it had? Unsurprisingly, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office concluded in 2021 that there was no viable means of measuring it – a real problem given “there are hard choices to be made. Not least where, how and when engagement offers political access and value”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As DE fell out of favour, Strategic Communication (StratCom) made a strong bid for ownership of the elusive influence. In 2019, the UK’s StratCom doctrine reframed all activity – physical or information – as contributing to influence. This led to a meaningful NATO definition of influence in 2023: “effects on the perception, attitudes and behaviours of an audience … achieved deliberately by information and communication activities, or as a second and third order effect of all activities”. It also became the central pillar of the concept of Orchestrated Military Strategic Effects (OMSE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Defence Engagement’s focus should firmly be on actors who do not yet support UK interests effectively – either shaping their intent to support the UK, building their capacity to do so, or both&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a big problem with this approach. All doctrine (including OMSE) has consistently implied that influence modifies behaviour – be it voting a certain way in the UN General Assembly, choosing a trade partner or being deterred from a course of action. Behavioural science (the well-established academic field relating to behavioural change) has a fundamental rule that the desire to change is inadequate by itself. Without capacity – the necessary tools, know-how and permissions (individual, cultural and legal), intent cannot translate to action. Motivation and capacity together result in change. So StratCom’s changes in perceptions and motivation are inadequate for the task on their own. Capacity is measurable and can be built up if insufficient – just not by StratCom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other contender for the now-vacant throne of DE is the related concept of PE. Certainly, PE would seem to be an effective tool for capacity building, at least in terms of the tools and know-how. While PE readily enhances access and counter-adversary activities at the tactical and operational levels, it is not clear that it increases public or international influence (needed to “grant permission” for change). It also tends to be single service-led, and so one wonders how well it can ever truly be coordinated by a centralised StratCom function to meet the demands of OMSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the UK’s current approach may still be a missing a vital element. What needs to change to fill that gap? First, Defence needs to be very clear about what the Engage space is for. If it truly includes shaping the behaviours of potential allies and adversaries alike, then it must implement a whole-system approach to doing so, ensuring all the apposite instruments (Global Defence Network, UK StratCom, Intelligence, Special Forces and the Single Services) are involved at every stage. Next, there needs to be an evidence-based articulation of how military activities can engender relevant changes in behaviour, not just perception. Lastly, a robust assessment, monitoring and evaluation framework must be in place so that Defence understands the cost, benefit and what works – the ESCAPADE database was simply not up to the task. DE struggled with all of these, but there is little sign that newer approaches are addressing them any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The targets of the activities might change too. Why invest in the ability to modify the behaviour of an ally who already routinely supports UK interests? That is not to say that Defence should ignore them, but rather that it should focus on reinforcing interoperability and demonstrating the UK’s commitment to mutual support – a different set of activities entirely. DE’s focus should firmly be on actors who do not yet support UK interests effectively – either shaping their intent to support the UK, building their capacity to do so, or both. This requires Security, Policy and Operations to clearly articulate and prioritise desired behavioural changes, something it has not always managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Defence must be certain that it is happy to lose Defence Engagement’s strategic influence function, and if it is not, it needs to act; the UK’s adversaries are absolutely not prevaricating in this space&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, existing expertise in behavioural change and capacity building must be exploited and developed. Involvement of the reserves should be routine, as should introduction of (and handover to) the civilian institutions that hold much of the UK’s national soft power (and which are often resourced with international engagement in mind). Further professionalising the DE career will serve to act as a recruitment and retention tool, boost the capacity to iterate and develop, and establish the UK as a world leader in the field (which would itself offer DE opportunities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what of DE in 2024? Defence seems uncertain. Has it simply rebranded DE, believing that influence is completely captured between effects-based StratCom and PE? Or has it decided to limit its contribution to UK influence, falling back on the excellent work of the Defence Attaché network and reinvesting the resources into other subthreshold operations? The concern must be that, by just culling DE without the right mechanism to replace it, Defence will simply go back to 2010 – recognising that the UK possesses dwindling hard power and is in need of reliable partners, but uncertain about how to court them. Defence must be certain that it is happy to lose DE’s strategic influence function, and if it is not, it needs to act; the UK’s adversaries are absolutely not prevaricating in this space. Addressing the flaws of DE though a prioritised, coordinated and evidence-based approach to behavioural change (which would include PE and StratCom) should deliver the Engage/Constrain effects that Defence seeks. Ignoring them will simply propagate the problems; OMSE will fail and be replaced at the next SDSR by another concept with the same problems, while the UK continues to fret over the increasing gap between its influence and that of its adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report examines U.S. force posture in Europe — including the military capabilities, personnel, infrastructure, and agreements that support defense operations and plans — and makes recommendations for future U.S. posture. It finds that the United States needs a robust, long-term military force posture in Europe, focused on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) eastern flank, to deter future Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the United States needs a robust, long-term military force posture in Europe, focused on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) eastern flank, to deter future Russian aggression. Russia will likely remain a dangerous threat to the United States and Europe over the next several years. Russian president Vladimir Putin retains the political will and intentions to expand Russian power abroad, and Russia is reconstituting its military capabilities with help from China, Iran, and North Korea. A significant downsizing of U.S. forces in Europe could severely weaken deterrence and embolden a revanchist Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the United States should permanently station a U.S. Army armored brigade combat team (ABCT) in Poland to strengthen deterrence and reassure the United States’ Eastern European allies in response to a long-term Russian threat. Shifting the current rotational ABCT from Operation Atlantic Resolve to a permanent presence in Poland should be part of a 4+2 posture in Europe. This posture would include four U.S. brigade combat teams (BCTs) — three forward-stationed BCTs in Poland, Italy, and Germany, along with one rotational BCT in Romania — and two divisional headquarters, in Germany and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the U.S. Army should remain a bulwark for deterrence in Europe. A war against China in the Indo-Pacific will likely center on air and naval operations. However, some ground forces — from the U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Army, and allies and partners — will be helpful for both deterrence and warfighting, including on the Korean peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In examining U.S. posture in Europe, this study asks three main questions. What are the main security threats in Europe for the United States and its allies? What are U.S. interests in Europe? What is the appropriate U.S. force posture in Europe? In answering these questions, this study comes to several broad conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enduring-us-interests-in-europe&quot;&gt;Enduring U.S. Interests in Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has several enduring interests in Europe. They include protecting the U.S. homeland and the security of the American people from threats based in Europe, including from Russia; promoting and expanding economic prosperity and opportunity; realizing and defending the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life; and defending and supporting the United States’ European allies. While some U.S. politicians and pundits have questioned the value of NATO, U.S. interests in Europe remain significant and enduring. Still, a number of European governments need to increase defense spending in light of the precarious security environment. Numerous NATO countries (especially those on NATO’s eastern flank) spend over 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, such as Poland (3.9 percent), Estonia (2.73 percent), Lithuania (2.54 percent), Finland (2.45 percent), and the United Kingdom (2.07 percent). But some others do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;persistent-russian-threat&quot;&gt;Persistent Russian Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will likely remain a significant and dangerous threat to the United States and NATO. Russia likely does not pose an immediate conventional threat to NATO. Over the next several years, however, there are several factors that could change the military balance in Europe. The United States could become overstretched with a war against China in the Indo-Pacific, North Korea on the Korean Peninsula, or Iran or terrorist groups in the Middle East. In addition, Russia could continue to rebuild its military over the next several years with help from China, Iran, North Korea, and other countries. A Russian military victory in Ukraine — or even significant Russian military advances on the battlefield — would also increase the Russian threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;forward-defense-posture&quot;&gt;Forward Defense Posture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should take several steps to enhance its posture in Europe over the next several years in ways that are sustainable and affordable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should adopt a 4+2 posture beginning in 2025 that consists of four U.S. BCTs — in Poland, Italy, Germany, and Romania — and two headquarters, in Germany and Poland. This force posture would involve eventually shifting from a rotational to a permanent ABCT in Poland to strengthen deterrence against a revanchist Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should maintain all seven forward-deployed fighter squadrons currently based in Europe and add an additional F-16 squadron to Spangdahlem Air Base.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maritime:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should continue its current naval presence in the Baltic Sea region to deter Russian aggression and strengthen interoperability with allies and partners. In addition, the U.S. Navy should supplement existing NATO anti-submarine warfare capabilities by developing and deploying additional systems to the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepositioned Equipment and Munitions Stockpiles:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should bolster its prepositioned equipment and munitions stocks in Europe to enhance the readiness of U.S. forces. While the Army Prepositioned Stock 2 has been somewhat augmented by funding from the European Deterrence Initiative, the U.S. Army should take additional steps to improve the readiness of this equipment and the forces overseeing it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Air and Missile Defense:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should increase air and missile defense capabilities in Poland in coordination with a permanent ABCT. Given the utility of, and demand for, air and missile defense assets across multiple combatant commands, the Army should also prioritize the development and deployment of additional Patriot battalions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuclear Posture:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should increase modernization efforts, exercises, and scheduled deployments of assets to the European theater to bolster its deterrent capabilities and reassure allies. This includes modernizing its gravity bombs with the new B61-12. The U.S. military and NATO should also continue to conduct exercises with nuclear-capable platforms, including Bomber Task Force missions, to enhance readiness and assure allies of U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber and Space:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. forces should continue to enhance the security and resilience of their cyber systems and networks while simultaneously assisting European partners and allies. U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) should deploy additional “hunt forward” teams to Europe to counter threats from Russia and Russian-backed groups to U.S. forces and allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should help strengthen European military capabilities and encourage greater investment in such areas as combat support, including short-range air defense and long-range fires; airlift; heavy maneuver forces; maritime capabilities, including sensors and survivability systems; sufficient quantities of long-range precision strike weapons; and multi-spectrum ranges to train and maintain high-readiness forces. Security cooperation efforts should also involve additional security assistance, arms sales, training, partner capacity missions, industrial base cooperation, and strategic coordination between the United States, NATO, and European states on the development of forces and capabilities. Still, a number of European governments need to increase defense spending in light of the precarious security environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe remains a vital region for the United States. The last two U.S. national security and national defense strategies prioritized China as the main global threat. But Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, continuing aggression, and growing cooperation with China, Iran, and North Korea are stark reminders that the United States has significant and enduring interests in Europe as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ch-01&quot;&gt;CH. 01&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine dramatically shifted the strategic landscape in Europe, triggering the most devastating war in Europe since World War II. More Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine than in all previous Soviet and Russian wars combined since World War II, including Russia’s bloody wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya. The war has caused the most significant refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, driving over 6 million refugees to Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, and other countries. The war also has had substantial humanitarian implications, causing widespread civilian deaths and destruction in Ukraine and disrupting public access to water, electricity, heating, health care, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Russian leaders have threatened to use nuclear weapons, raising concerns about nuclear escalation. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council and a former Russian president, remarked, “Just imagine that the [Ukrainian] offensive . . . in tandem with NATO, succeeded and end up with part of our land being taken away. Then we would have to use nuclear weapons by virtue of the stipulations of the Russian Presidential Decree.” He continued by warning that “our enemies should pray to our fighters that they do not allow the world to go up in nuclear flames.” In response, some Western leaders have worried that Russia might consider using tactical nuclear weapons if Moscow faces sustained military losses in Ukraine. “Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far, militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons,” remarked William J. Burns, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, in April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Russian aggression and an escalation in tensions between NATO and Russia, two consecutive U.S. administrations have committed to shifting military resources to the Indo-Pacific to deal with China. The Biden administration’s Global Posture Review identified the Indo-Pacific as the most important region for U.S. national security to “advance initiatives that contribute to regional stability and deter potential Chinese military aggression and threats from North Korea.” In addition, the administration’s National Defense Strategy reaffirmed that the United States’ is prioritizing the Indo-Pacific region in its efforts to counter China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there is a need to re-evaluate U.S. force posture in Europe based on Russia’s aggressive military actions and the prospect of a protracted war in Ukraine. Future U.S. posture in Europe has significant implications for deterring adversaries in Europe and other regions, including the Indo-Pacific; assuring allies and partners in Europe and other regions; fighting wars effectively if deterrence fails; and preserving security institutions, including NATO. There have been numerous studies on U.S. posture in Europe over the past several years. But the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, expansion of NATO to Finland and Sweden, and Russian threats to Poland, Baltic states, and other countries create an urgent need to re-examine U.S. defense posture in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-design&quot;&gt;RESEARCH DESIGN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these challenges, this report asks several questions. First, what are the main security threats in Europe for the United States and its allies? Second, what are U.S. interests in Europe? Third, what is the appropriate U.S. force posture in Europe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these research questions, the report pursues a mixed methods approach. To answer the first question, it assesses the conventional and nuclear balance in Europe in such areas as land, air, maritime, and nuclear capabilities. It also examines Russia’s attempts to reconstitute its military, the nature of the Russian threat to the West over the next several years, and European capabilities and capability gaps. To answer the second question, the report outlines U.S. interests and objectives in the context of broader U.S. strategic considerations. To answer the third question, the report assesses U.S. posture in several domains: land (including forward-stationed forces, rotational forces, and Army Prepositioned Stocks); air (including sensors, fighter aircraft, integrated air and missile defense, and long-range strike); naval (including all-domain naval operations, theater security cooperation, prepositioning, and the deployment of carrier strike groups, amphibious ready groups and Marine expeditionary units, and the U.S. Sixth and Second Fleets); space (including coordination with U.S. Space Command); cyber (including coordination with Joint Force Headquarters–Cyber and U.S. Cyber Command); and nuclear (including nuclear forces and dual-capable aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project team leveraged primary- and secondary-source documents from relevant organizations (such as NATO, U.S. European Command, the Joint Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the military services, the U.S. Department of State, European countries, and EU officials), open-source materials from policymakers and subject-matter experts, and interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;definitions&quot;&gt;DEFINITIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As used here, force posture refers to the military capabilities, personnel, footprint (including bases, facilities, and support infrastructure), and agreements that support defense operations and plans. U.S. posture in Europe is significantly influenced by agreements with host countries, which provide access to facilities, airspace, and territory. In addition, the number of U.S. military personnel in Europe is based on the deployment of U.S. forces into and out of the region, which increase as assets such as carrier strike groups or Bomber Task Force units flow into Europe and decrease as they depart. While this report focuses on U.S. posture in Europe, the United States’ regional posture is impacted by its global posture. The report adopts a broad definition of Europe in line with the area that is currently in the U.S. European Command area of responsibility, which includes 51 countries in Europe and portions of Asia and the Middle East, with a total population of nearly 1 billion people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseas force posture generally involves trade-offs. On the one hand, overseas posture can help a country prepare for military operations, deter adversaries, assure allies and partners, and build local capacity through security cooperation. On the other hand, it can also incur risks by increasing the vulnerability of forces to attack from hostile states, stressing the readiness of the force, encouraging free riding by allies and partners, and potentially dragging forces into unwanted wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report examines the viability of strategic and operational concepts, including dynamic force employment and agile combat employment. Dynamic force employment involves deploying U.S. forces in ways that are strategically predictable for allies and operationally unpredictable for competitors. Examples might include deploying fifth-generation fighters, Bomber Task Force missions, U.S. Army or Marine forces, or guided-missile destroyers to various locations in Europe for snap exercises with allies and partners. Agile combat employment involves the use of small, dispersed air bases abroad — rather than relying on large overseas bases — to reduce vulnerability to adversary attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;caveats&quot;&gt;CAVEATS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several caveats about what this analysis does — and does not — attempt to do. First, the report does not conduct a systematic cost analysis of U.S. force posture in Europe, though it does broadly discuss the cost implications associated with overseas posture. This report does not build a model that includes the cost of the current condition of overseas and U.S. installations (including a need to modernize installations or restore facilities and capabilities), host-nation support that the U.S. Department of Defense receives when it stations forces in a foreign country, or the incremental costs beyond the United States’ stationing and maintaining overseas bases and forces (including the cost difference in permanent and rotational presence options).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, this report focuses predominantly on strategic and operational U.S. interests, objectives, and force postures in Europe. A detailed cost analysis is important and should be a component of any final U.S. decision on force posture in the Middle East and elsewhere around the globe. But the most important determinants of U.S. force posture in the region are likely to be the relative benefits and risks of U.S. strategic objectives and interests. Additionally, the cost differential in the event of a reduction in U.S. presence in the region would be relatively minor if those forces were deployed elsewhere overseas or returned to the United States. Significant savings would only be generated if the units and force structure elements were deactivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the report does not conduct a systematic analysis of U.S. force posture around the globe. The focus is squarely on Europe. Nevertheless, as highlighted in every chapter of this report, the analysis and conclusions were informed by U.S. global posture considerations. Any decision regarding U.S. force posture in Europe needs to be understood in the context of U.S. national security interests and U.S. posture in other regions — especially the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the report focuses on U.S. military posture in the region. It does not conduct a systematic analysis of all U.S. activity in Europe, including diplomatic activity conducted by the U.S. State Department; intelligence activity conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and other organizations within the U.S. intelligence community; development activity by the U.S. Agency for International Development and non-governmental organizations; and financial, law enforcement, and other activity conducted by such organizations as the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security. These non-military actions are critical, and military force should not be viewed as the principal tool to deal with the region’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the report focuses predominantly on U.S. military posture, it does highlight other U.S. government actions where appropriate and acknowledges the importance of diplomacy, development, information operations, and other activities. The report does not conduct a systematic analysis of all NATO or EU militaries, though it does nest the analysis in a broader understanding of European military capabilities and political will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organization-of-the-report&quot;&gt;ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this report is divided into several parts and chapters. Part I explores the strategic landscape in Europe. Chapter 2 examines the U.S. military presence in Europe from World War II to today. Chapter 3 analyzes the evolving threat landscape in Europe, including the threat from Russia. Chapter 4 assesses European military capabilities, including at the high-end of the military spectrum. Part II turns to force posture. Chapter 5 provides an overview of U.S. interests in Europe in the context of other U.S. interests at home and abroad, as well as U.S. defense objectives. Chapter 6 offers recommendations for future U.S. force posture in Europe. Chapter 7 assesses alternative options and weighs their pros and cons. Finally, Part III provides a conclusion, with Chapter 9 summarizing the main recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ch-02&quot;&gt;CH. 02&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;historical-trends&quot;&gt;HISTORICAL TRENDS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ military posture in Europe has considerably evolved from the end of World War II to the present. Changes to the number and types of capabilities of U.S. forces in Europe have been driven by several factors, such as the perception of threat posed by the Soviet Union and Russia to the United States and its European allies, the relative balance of military capabilities between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the evolution of U.S. strategy and political considerations, and the relationship between the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s “New Look” policy emphasized a reliance on nuclear weapons, though he was committed to keeping U.S. forces in Europe “as long as the need existed.” The Kennedy and Johnson administrations shifted to a policy of “Flexible Response,” which was adopted by NATO in 1967 and gave the U.S. president the ability to select from a suite of military and non-military options when responding to a crisis. The Nixon, Ford, and Carter administrations largely pursued a policy of detente with the Soviet Union before the Carter administration’s Dual-Track strategy and President Ronald Reagan’s defense buildup. The collapse of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War led to a major drawdown of U.S. forces in Europe as the United States prioritized contingencies elsewhere. However, Russian aggression in Ukraine, beginning in 2014 and continuing through the February 2022 invasion, prompted a rethinking of the role and capabilities of U.S. forces in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment of U.S. military posture in Europe in the post-World War II era to the present. It examines trends in capabilities and personnel, and it identifies strategic and operational inflection points in U.S. force posture. The chapter concludes by presenting a baseline of current U.S. posture and discussing NATO force posture development. The baseline serves to inform the posture options presented in subsequent chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trends-in-us-military-personnel-in-europe&quot;&gt;TRENDS IN U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL IN EUROPE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of U.S. military personnel in Europe shifted considerably during the Cold War, as shown in Figure 2.1. End strength in Europe peaked in 1957 at 473,000, a significant increase from the 122,000 stationed there in 1950. That figure fell by 45 percent to 262,000 by 1970 during détente. By 1985, however, the number of U.S. military personnel in Europe grew to 359,000 during the Reagan buildup. Following the end of the Cold War, the number of U.S. personnel declined nearly 42 percent by 1992 from 1985 levels, and U.S. forces continued to decrease to a post-World War II low of 66,000 in 2013. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to yet another shift, with the number of U.S. forces increasing to over 100,000 by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More U.S. personnel have been stationed in Europe than any other region during periods of peace. Figure 2.2 compares the deployment of U.S. active-duty military personnel globally. U.S. forces in Asia exceeded those in Europe during the wars in Korea and Vietnam. Despite the drawdown of personnel following the Cold War, more forces remained in Europe than any other region until the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections detail the policy and strategic developments which shaped these trends in U.S. military and capabilities in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-trends-in-us-force-posture&quot;&gt;HISTORICAL TRENDS IN U.S. FORCE POSTURE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The End of World War II and Early Stages of the Cold War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tensions quickly mounted between the Western allies and the Soviet Union despite collaboration between the United States, United Kingdom, and Soviet Union during World War II to defeat the Axis powers. Winston Churchill, following his 1945 electoral defeat, described this emerging incompatibility between allied and Soviet worldviews and interests the following year as the descent of an “iron curtain” over the continent, dividing East from West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these geopolitical warnings, post-World War II peacetime demobilization and drawdowns of forces by Western powers proceeded at a blistering pace. U.S. end strength fell from over 12 million personnel in 1945 to just 1.4 million by 1948. The United States’ military posture in Europe reduced given its transition from an invasion force to an occupation force in Germany. In the late 1940s, the U.S. presence was roughly 150,000. By 1950, the Army’s European Command only controlled one infantry division in Germany, while four were stationed in Japan. By the time of the creation of NATO in 1949, the United States, United Kingdom, and France could barely account for 12 total divisions, which were dedicated primarily to the occupation of Germany. These forces paled in comparison to the 26 Soviet divisions forward deployed in Eastern Europe and the estimated 75 Soviet divisions based in western Russia. On balance, neither the military dimensions nor the military requirements of the emerging competition with the Soviet Union were fully appreciated by Western powers in the early stages of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The June 1950 invasion of South Korea by North Korea fundamentally altered U.S. and Western strategic calculus regarding the roles, missions, and necessity of military forces in confronting an expansionist and aggressive Soviet Union. Communist China and the Soviet Union backed North Korea, and U.S. leaders viewed the conflict as an attempt to impose communist rule by force on non-communist nations. The Truman administration adopted a policy of containment, as outlined in NSC-68, to limit the spread of communist and Soviet influence globally. This strategy required a buildup of both conventional and nuclear forces to meet the expansive demands of deterring and defending against Soviet aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Korean War had the practical effect of waking the United States and Europe up to the military dimensions of the Cold War. Not only did allies contribute troops and capabilities toward the defense of South Korea, but they also began prioritizing the defense of Western Europe against possible Soviet incursions. Following the outbreak of the war, the United States and NATO took steps to significantly increase their military presence. NATO plans in 1950 called for 18 active and 16 reserve divisions. The United States increased its posture in Europe to four divisions and prepositioned equipment and supplies on the continent. In a February 1952 meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Lisbon, NATO pursued an even more ambitious target of reaching 50 active and 46 reserve divisions by 1954. However, NATO failed to meet the Lisbon Force goals, only fielding 25 active and 25 reserve divisions by 1955. During this period, the U.S. military pushed for the creation of an integrated NATO command structure and took on critical NATO staff roles, including a U.S. general as the supreme allied commander, Europe (SACEUR). The United States also established U.S. European Command (EUCOM) in August 1952.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Look and Flexible Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower, former U.S. Army chief of staff and the first SACEUR, was elected president on a platform of balancing the federal budget. Eisenhower vowed to reduce defense spending, which had spiked under Truman, and to pursue a more sustainable defense strategy. Despite the buildup of U.S. and NATO forces, the West still faced a significant numerical disadvantage against the Soviet Union in Europe. This disparity shaped the development of the Eisenhower administration’s “New Look” strategy of massive retaliation beginning in 1953 and its eventual adoption by NATO in 1957. The policy of massive retaliation emerged out of a strategy review known as Project Solarium, which affirmed the goals of the containment strategy identified by the Truman administration. However, the strategy document which eventually emerged, NSC 162/2, outlined a more economically sustainable deterrent based on a retaliatory nuclear response. This approach reduced the role of conventional Western forces in Europe to a “tripwire” and “delaying force” that would prevent Europe from “being entirely overrun before the effect of the U.S. nuclear attack on the Soviet homeland was fully felt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and NATO shifted their strategy from massive retaliation to “flexible response” during the 1960s and 1970s. This shift was due in part to the belief that massive retaliation was no longer a credible deterrent given expanding Soviet nuclear capabilities and the Kennedy administration’s pursuit of a more “balanced” approach to defense. The United States expanded its ground forces from 11 to 16 active divisions and deployed an additional two to Germany following the 1961 Berlin Wall crisis. Additionally, U.S. army divisions placed greater emphasis on conventional firepower, tactical mobility, and decentralized command and control. While U.S. officials felt a greater sense of optimism regarding the balance of allied conventional military capabilities against the Soviets, particularly given the United States’ qualitative advantage in terms of capabilities, U.S. forces in Europe in the late 1960s declined largely because of the U.S. war in Vietnam. During the 1970s, the U.S. military placed greater emphasis on its ability to provide outside reinforcements to NATO in the event of a crisis, including plans to deploy 10 divisions and 60 tactical fighter squadrons to Europe in only 10 days. This led to a greater emphasis on the prepositioning of Army and Air Force equipment in Europe and securing allied host-nation support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dual-Track Strategy and Peace through Strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1976, the Soviet Union began deploying its SS-20 intermediate-range missiles, prompting concerns from Western European allies. In response, the Carter administration and NATO announced the dual-track decision in December 1979, which entailed deploying 108 Pershing 2 ballistic missiles and 464 ground-launched cruise missiles in the United Kingdom, West Germany, and Italy. In addition, the dual-track decision involved simultaneously pursuing arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce each side’s missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Reagan administration, U.S. forces in Europe increased as part of a broader defense buildup. The administration’s decision to confront the Soviet Union through its “peace through strength” plan led to a buildup of U.S. military forces in Europe — in addition to the planned deployment of Pershing 2 nuclear missiles to West Germany in 1983 and NATO’s Able Archer 83 exercises in the same year. At the same time, Reagan officials also conducted a series of arms control negotiations, such as the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT), and Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the Cold War, a sophisticated network of political-military arrangements designed to communicate the capability and credibility of allied forces to deter a Soviet attack underpinned U.S. and NATO posture. Division-level exercises, such as REFORGER, allowed the United States to test its ability to deploy its troops from the continental United States to Europe and reseize NATO territory. NATO’s International Military Staff worked to build common war plans and interoperability standards among allies in order to minimize tactical frictions commonly associated with fighting in military coalitions. The SACEUR possessed pre-delegated authorities to retaliate against a Soviet incursion with nuclear weapons in the event that London, for example, could not be contacted during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Cold War&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fall of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War led successive governments on both sides of the Atlantic to realize the gains of a “peace dividend” and reduce military spending, military forces, and the U.S. military presence in Europe. Building on planning that was initially conducted during the Reagan administration, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell developed the “Base Force” plan in 1991 to determine the future force structure requirements for the United States in the post-Cold War era. The central premise of the Base Force was that global conflict was increasingly unlikely, while regional conflicts were becoming more likely. U.S. policymakers designed the initial assumptions for the Base Force before the collapse of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact, but the Bush administration argued that military design and end-strength determinations were still relevant. As one observer wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like its predecessors, JSCP FY 1989-90 [which informed the Base Force], written in the spring of 1988, considered the possibility of a U.S.-Soviet confrontation that could erupt into global war as the most serious threat to U.S. interests. But, with the Soviet Union reducing its military presence in Eastern Europe, reducing and consolidating its military forces, and undertaking domestic reform, the JSCP argued that calculated Soviet aggression in Central Europe was unlikely. The more likely threats were indigenously caused conventional regional conflicts with little likelihood of direct Soviet intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, senior U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) officials argued at the time that the collapse of the Warsaw Pact meant that further reductions in nuclear forces might be warranted and that U.S. posture in Europe should also decrease. Yet they did so with a caveat: U.S. presence in Europe should not be reduced any further than the planned end strength of 150,000 personnel. The United States also returned a number of installations to host countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decrease in U.S. force posture accelerated under the Clinton administration, which planned for a final end strength of 100,000 by 1996 (down from 185,000 in 1993). Yet U.S. posture in Europe only reached a low of 113,000 in 1997 because of U.S. involvement in the Balkan wars. Between December 1995 and January 1996, the United States deployed 20,000 military personnel to Bosnia under a NATO-led force to implement a peace agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the George W. Bush administration announced that it would withdraw 40,000 U.S. military personnel from Europe as part of a broader effort to redeploy and return troops to the United States. This removal included the heavy armored brigades of the 1st Armored Division and 1st Infantry Division, which returned to the United States. The reassignment of U.S. forces continued until late 2007 when Secretary of Defense Robert Gates temporarily halted the withdrawal of the last two heavy brigades. He was concerned that there was insufficient basing for the troops in the United States. U.S. military commanders in Europe also argued that armored capabilities were necessary to meet theater security requirements. Still, the number of U.S. military personnel fell by over 40 percent, from 115,000 personnel in 2004 to 66,000 in 2008. By 2011, only four brigade combat teams (BCTs) remained in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, however, the Obama administration announced that it would withdraw the two remaining armored brigades, in line with its Defense Strategic Guidance, leaving only two light BCTs. The number of U.S. personnel in Europe reached a post-World War II low of 63,000 in 2013. A rotational battalion-sized task force known as the European Rotational Force replaced the armored brigades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As U.S. troop strength in Europe decreased and U.S. strategic priorities shifted to other regions, there were two major arguments for retaining a presence in Europe. First, some argued that the United States needed a military presence in Italy and Germany to launch and support counterterrorism operations in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. Second, some argued that the United States needed to maintain a robust suite of security cooperation activities to ensure that former Warsaw Pact countries continued reforming their militaries to be compatible with their recently established democratic institutions. In addition, the United States continued to deploy forces to the Balkans as part of the Kosovo Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia’s 2014 Military Action in Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the Obama administration responded by bolstering the United States’ defense posture in Europe. In April, EUCOM launched Operation Atlantic Resolve to increase U.S. presence in the region. The operation was funded by the European Reassurance Initiative, later renamed the European Deterrence Initiative, a special account requested by the administration to fund rotational deployments, exercises, training, and security cooperation efforts with partners and allies. Much of the initial years of this funding went toward recapitalizing basing and infrastructure that had been underinvested in over prior decades. While the initial rotational deployments of the European Rotational Force in 2014 sent only a battalion-sized force to the region, those deployments expanded to meet the new mission requirements of Atlantic Resolve beginning in 2015. In January 2017, the DOD announced the beginning of a continuous armored brigade combat team (ABCT) rotational presence in Europe and back-to-back rotations of U.S. troops and equipment to Europe. By 2023, the 7,000-person rotational force included four elements: a division headquarters located in Poznan, Poland; a combat aviation brigade; an ABCT; and a sustainment task force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2020, the Trump administration announced that it planned to withdraw almost 12,000 U.S. personnel from Germany. As part of that redeployment, approximately 6,400 troops would return to the United States, while the remainder would be moved to Belgium and Italy. The Biden administration announced that the withdrawal plans were on hold shortly after taking office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-response-to-russias-2022-invasion-and-us-posture-today&quot;&gt;THE U.S. RESPONSE TO RUSSIA’S 2022 INVASION AND U.S. POSTURE TODAY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russian forces massed on its border with Ukraine in late 2021 and early 2022, the Biden administration announced several deployments as part of its deterrence and reassurance efforts. In early February 2022, the United States deployed approximately 4,700 personnel of the 82nd Airborne Division and additional troops from the XVIIIth Airborne Corps to Germany and Poland and repositioned a Stryker squadron from Germany to Romania. Later that month, the DOD deployed the main V Corps Headquarters to Germany and the main 1st Infantry Division Headquarters and the 1st Infantry Division Artillery Headquarters to Poland, which totaled approximately 1,300 soldiers. The United States also deployed additional forces — including an infantry battalion task force, F-35 strike fighters, and attack aviation — to countries along NATO’s eastern flank. By the beginning of Russia’s invasion on February 24, 2022, the U.S. presence in Europe had increased to 90,000 personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the invasion, the DOD announced that it had deployed or extended over 20,000 additional forces to Europe, bringing the total number of U.S. personnel in Europe to over 100,000. These forces included the deployment of an ABCT, a High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) battalion, and KC-135 refueling aircraft, among other forces. At the Madrid NATO Summit in July 2022, President Biden announced several “long-term commitments to bolster European security,” including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Poland, the permanent forward-stationing of the V Corps Headquarters Forward Command Post, an Army garrison headquarters, and a field support battalion;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Romania, the deployment of an additional rotational BCT;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Baltics, enhanced rotational deployments;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Spain, an increase in the number of destroyers stationed at Rota from four to six;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, the forward-stationing of two F-35 squadrons;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Germany, the forward-stationing of an air defense artillery brigade headquarters, a short-range air defense battalion, a combat sustainment support battalion headquarters, and an engineer brigade headquarters; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Italy, the forward-stationing of a short-range air defense battery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. force posture in Europe rose by almost 60 percent from its historic low point in 2013. This increase coincided with an expanded footprint on the continent, with forward operating and training sites in addition to traditional bases and garris Europe. U.S. Army Europe and Africa has eight main operating bases across Germany, Belgium, and Italy, supported by seven Army garrison. It additionally maintains forward operating sites and training locations in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA) is headquartered at Ramstein Air Base in Germany and oversees approximately 35,000 personnel (including active-duty, guard, reserve, and civilian) and 217 aircraft. USAFE-AFAFRICA’s capabilities include fighter, attack, rotary-wing, tanker, and transport aircraft which perform close air support, air interdiction, air defense, in-flight refueling, long-range transport, and support of maritime operations. The command operates from seven main bases, including Royal Air Force (RAF) Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom; Ramstein and Spangdahlem Air Bases in Germany; Aviano Air Base in Italy; Lajes Field in the Azores; and Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. While U.S. F-35 squadrons are primarily stationed at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom and Sangadahlem Air Base in Germany, the fifth-generation aircraft deployed to the Baltic and Black Sea regions for air policing missions to deter against Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Navy’s Sixth Fleet, U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa, oversees an area of responsibility that covers approximately half of the Atlantic Ocean, from the Arctic Ocean to the coast of Antarctica, as well as the Adriatic, Baltic, Barents, Black, Caspian, Mediterranean, and North Seas. The fleet is headquartered at Naval Support Activity (NSA) Naples, Italy. Notably, the Sixth Fleet maintains Task Force 65/Destroyer Squadron 60 in Rota, Spain, which includes the forward stationing of six destroyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nato-posture-and-the-2022-strategic-concept&quot;&gt;NATO POSTURE AND THE 2022 STRATEGIC CONCEPT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO responded to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 by establishing a high-readiness response force and enhancing its forward presence with four battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. These four battlegroups, led by the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and the United States, respectively, totaled 4,530 personnel by May 2017. NATO’s presence on its eastern flank has expanded considerably since Russia’s second invasion of Ukraine, with four new battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, for a total presence of 10,232 personnel as of November 2022. NATO has also adopted an increased air and missile defense posture on the eastern flank, which it refers to as “air shielding.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its Madrid summit in June 2022, NATO announced a new strategic concept in response to Russia’s aggression. The new concept calls for a “fundamental shift to [NATO’s] deterrence and defence” by expanding NATO forces and capabilities. This shift includes the expansion of the forward-deployed battlegroups to brigade-sized units “where and when required.” NATO leaders also agreed to a new NATO Force Model for the high-readiness response force, with the goal of growing from 40,00 to over 300,000 troops. The NATO Force Model envisions two tiers of high-readiness forces, including 100,000 personnel ready to deploy within 10 days and an additional 200,000 ready within 30 days. The 2022 NATO Strategic Concept also stresses the importance of enhancing prepositioned equipment to maintain readiness. This development marks a shift in NATO posture away from a “forward-presence tripwire” of limited forces on the eastern flank to a more credible force capable of deterrence by denial. In addition to releasing its new strategic concept at the Madrid summit, NATO also invited Finland and Sweden to join the alliance following the submission of their official letters of application in May. Finland officially joined NATO on April 4, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, NATO took further steps to enhance its posture by establishing new regional plans to defend NATO across all of its flanks with new command and control arrangements and by establishing a new Allied Reaction Force. Allies also agreed through a new Defense Investment Pledge to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense in an update to the 2014 agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of World War II, the United States’ military posture in Europe has been impacted by a range of factors, especially the threat posed by the Soviet Union and then Russia. While the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union contributed to a major decline in U.S. forces in Europe, Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine has raised numerous questions about the future. The next chapter examines the threat landscape in Europe through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ch-03&quot;&gt;CH. 03&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;europes-evolving-threat-landscape&quot;&gt;EUROPE’S EVOLVING THREAT LANDSCAPE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines the evolving threat landscape in Europe. It focuses on the military balance with Russia, which is the most significant threat to Europe in the foreseeable future. It also briefly examines terrorism, Iran, China, illegal migration, and other threats, such as pandemics and climate change. Applying a planning horizon through 2030 is far enough away to be helpful to policymakers considering force posture decisions, which can take years to develop. It is also near enough to make plausible assumptions about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter argues that Russia will remain the most significant threat to Europe for the foreseeable future. Today, NATO enjoys a strong conventional and nuclear deterrent. In the event of a potential near-term Russian attack against NATO’s eastern flank, however unlikely, there are several factors in NATO’s favor: the inherent advantage of the defense, the force-to-space ratio problem for Russia, limited avenues of approach from Russia into Eastern Europe, and the qualitative superiority of NATO forces. In addition, NATO retains a robust nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Russia has the will and intentions to threaten one or more NATO countries, and it is re-building its capabilities. Russian military thinking is dominated by a view that the United States is — and will remain — Moscow’s main enemy (главный враг) for the foreseeable future. This view of the United States as the main enemy has increased since the 2022 invasion. Russian political and military leaders assess that Russia’s struggles in Ukraine have been largely due to U.S. and broader NATO aid, which Russian leaders interpret as direct participation in the war. In addition, Russian leaders believe that the United States is attempting to expand its power, further encircle Russia, and weaken Russia militarily, politically, and economically. These sentiments make Russia a dangerous enemy over the next several years and will likely drive Moscow’s desire to reconstitute its military as rapidly as possible, prepare to fight the West if deterrence fails, and engage in irregular and hybrid activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, several factors could change the military balance in Europe over the next decade. First, the United States could become overstretched due to a major theater war in another region, such as against China in the Indo-Pacific. European conventional and logistical capabilities are limited — particularly for high-end war — creating potential vulnerabilities if the United States were to withdraw significant air, naval, and ground forces from the region. Second, Russia could rebuild its military capabilities over the next several years with help from China, Iran, North Korea, and other countries. China, in particular, is developing significant military capabilities, such as fifth- and sixth-generation fighters, hypersonic weapons, and emerging technologies, which could change the European balance of power if there were a notable increase in defense cooperation with Russia. Third, U.S. or European political will could erode to build sufficient military capabilities to deter Russia, based on differences in strategic culture, domestic financial and popular constraints, distinct threat perceptions, or other factors. Fourth, there are several other potential wildcards that could impact the threat environment, such as a Russian leadership change or use of a nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several caveats in conducting any analysis of the future security environment, including the military balance. One is that this analysis is based on open-source reporting, not classified intelligence, which creates some gaps. For example, there is imperfect information about the size, composition, equipment, and capabilities of Russian forces, what is known as “order of battle.” Russia has utilized maskirovka — or denial and deception — to mask its activities, strengths, and vulnerabilities. It is also difficult to foresee how the future threat environment will evolve. For example, it was unclear in February 2021 that Russia would invade Ukraine a year later — and then suffer a series of battlefield losses. These uncertainties suggest that any analysis of the future security environment in Europe should have sufficient modesty and humility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter is divided into four sections. The first examines the military balance in Europe with Russia. The second section assesses other threats to Europe, such as terrorism, Iran, China, and illegal immigration. The third outlines possible wildcards that could change the military balance in Europe and impact the threat environment. The fourth section provides a brief summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-balance-in-europe&quot;&gt;MILITARY BALANCE IN EUROPE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section begins by examining Russia and the conventional balance in Europe and then turns to the nuclear balance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Conventional Balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any analysis assessing the military balance should begin by positing the goals and strategies of the two sides, and it should then proceed to explore the ability of each side to execute its strategy. In Eastern Europe, NATO’s primary goal is to deter an attack and defend its eastern flank, if necessary. To achieve this goal, NATO has adopted a conventional strategy that aims, in the words of NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept, to “defend forward with robust in-place, multi-domain, combat-ready forces, enhanced command and control arrangements, prepositioned ammunition and equipment and improved capacity and infrastructure to rapidly reinforce any Ally, including at short or no notice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s strategy has generally focused on “active defense” (активная оборона), which involves taking measures to deny victory in the initial period of a foreign invasion. But Russia’s strategy envisions occasionally shifting to the offense, as it did in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin seeks a growing sphere of influence in Europe, the Middle East, and other regions, and he has expressed admiration for the historical Russian Empire and Russian conquerors such as Peter the Great and Catherine the Great. In his essay “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,” Putin argued that Belarusians, Russians, and Ukrainians are descendants of the Rus and that Ukraine has never been a sovereign country. Putin has also expressed interest in a new Slavic union composed of Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and perhaps the northern part of Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this revisionist worldview, NATO countries need to deter future Russian activity — including irregular or gray zone activities — in Eastern Europe, especially such countries as the Baltic states, Finland, and Poland. Russian military thinking is dominated by a view that the United States — and NATO more broadly — is Moscow’s main enemy (главный враг). Russian political and military leaders assess that the country’s struggles in Ukraine have been largely due to U.S. and broader NATO assistance. As one senior Russian diplomat remarked, “The United States became a direct participant of this conflict long ago, and they have long been waging a hybrid war against my country. Ukraine is only an instrument in their hands, a tip of the spear held by the U.S.-led collective West. Their goal is to destroy a sovereign, independent Russia as a factor in international politics.” Russian leaders also believe that the United States is expanding its influence, attempting to further encircle Russia, and trying to weaken Russia militarily, politically, and economically. The result is that Russia’s insecurity and animosity toward the West — and the United States in particular — will likely deepen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a Russian conventional attack against NATO countries, such as the Baltic states, is unlikely today, NATO needs to deter a Russian attack in the future. There are several factors that are important to assess deterrence: (1) the relative strength of the available forces possessed by Russia and NATO; (2) the force-to-space ratio; (3) the relative rate at which each side can marshal and deploy forces; (4) the individual initiative and flexibility of Russian commanders; and (5) the character of the terrain in the theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative Capabilities of Opposing Forces:&lt;/strong&gt; The first factor is the relative strength of the opposing forces. The best measures of relative conventional strength are those that capture the full range of combat capabilities of a force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russian soldiers have struggled in Ukraine, the Russian military is attempting to modernize its forces, including main battle tanks (such as the T-14 Armata), infantry fight vehicles (such as the BMP-2M and T-15), armored personnel carriers (such as the BTR‐82A and BTR‐82AM), and artillery (such as the 300-mm 9K515 Tornado-S [Smerch] and 122-mm 9K51M Tornado-G [Grad] multiple rocket launcher system). Russia is also modernizing its legacy aircraft, surface-to-air missile systems, and radars. Over the next year or two, Russia plans to deploy two regiments equipped with RS-26 Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles. Russia’s navy is modernizing elements of its fleet, including with the Borey-class (Project 955/955A) ballistic missile submarine, guided missile submarines such as the Project 949A Oscar II-class), and missiles (such as the 3M14 Kalibr land-attack cruise missile). Russia is also focused on improving other components of its anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) capabilities through 2030, including air defense, coastal missiles, and layered defenses. Russia’s defense industry, which has been handicapped by sanctions, will likely be under stress to match its leaders’ ambitions, though it is producing new equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is in the midst of a shift in force design. The Russian army will likely continue to move away from battalion formations to infantry, marine, and airborne divisions. This would mark a significant shift away from the changes implemented under former minister of defence Anatoly Serdyukov, who scrapped the Soviet-era structure of the armed forces that included large divisions as part of the “New Look” reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of its restructuring plan, the military re-established the Moscow and Leningrad Military Districts as joint force strategic territorial units within the armed forces. This was another blow to the Serdyukov “New Look” reforms, since he had condensed six military districts into four, as well as changed their command and control relationships. The Western Military District’s failure during the invasion of Ukraine may have contributed to its downfall. The Russian military will also likely increase the number of contract service members, or kontraktniki (контрактники), and raise the age ceiling for conscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the Russian military faces several challenges. First, Russia’s deepening economic crisis will somewhat constrain its efforts to expand the quantity and quality of its ground, air, and naval forces. The war in Ukraine has fueled Russia’s worst labor crunch in decades; hundreds of thousands of workers have fled the country or have been sent to fight in Ukraine, weakening an economy weighed down by economic sanctions and international isolation. Second, corruption remains rampant in the Russian military, which could undermine Moscow’s overall plan to structure, staff, train, and equip its forces. Third, Russia’s defense industrial base faces several challenges. One is replacement of losses from the war in Ukraine. A protracted war in Ukraine will likely compound these challenges. In addition, economic sanctions have created shortages of higher-end foreign components and forced Moscow to substitute them with lower-quality alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the conventional balance in Europe favors the United States and Europe today. This advantage includes forces currently deployed to NATO’s eastern flank, as well as forces that Russia and NATO could deploy as part of a war that are stationed elsewhere. As Figure 3.1 highlights, for example, the United States and other NATO forces have a significant advantage in the number of active and reserve army personnel, main battle tanks, other armored fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers, artillery, and air and missile defenses already deployed on the collective territory. This importantly does not include the potential reinforcements and rotational positioning that U.S. and allied forces can produce. Russia’s war in Ukraine significantly deteriorated Russian capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the United States and other NATO forces have some advantages in naval capabilities, including submarines, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and other surface ships, as highlighted in Figure 3.2. The same is true in air forces, as highlighted in Figure 3.3, where the United States and NATO have an advantage in bombers, fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft, command and control aircraft, electronic warfare, and other aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two other themes of note based on the data. First, the United States’ armed forces constitute a majority of NATO’s overall military capabilities. As discussed later in this chapter, U.S. involvement in a war in the Indo-Pacific, Middle East, or another region would likely impact the type and number of forces available in Europe, potentially changing this balance. Second, while the conventional balance in Europe heavily favors NATO, Russia’s weakness is particularly apparent compared to Chinese capabilities. As highlighted later in this chapter, China could provide weapons systems and technology to Russia that would change the balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force-to-Space Ratio:&lt;/strong&gt; A second factor includes force-to-space ratio constraints. The size of the forces that both sides can place on the front lines is limited by the nature of the local geography and the transportation infrastructure. Beyond a certain number, more forces will not fit on the front. Many of the attacker’s vehicles must travel on roads, require significant logistics tails, and need to be spaced out to decrease the possibility of strikes from aircraft, artillery, and ambushes. If the attacker crams too many forces at or near the point of attack, a traffic jam could develop that makes it difficult to maneuver the offender’s armored forces. The defender can place more forces in prepared positions off the roads, but there are limits to the size of the defender’s forward forces as well. This limit, known as the maximum force-to-space ratio, is roughly one brigade per seven kilometers of front, although these are approximate estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these challenges were evident in the first days and weeks following the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Russian army faced significant logistical and maintenance challenges operating in contested areas deep inside of Ukraine. Without access to rail transport infrastructure that is typically used to move Russian heavy equipment and with the few roads available clogged with traffic, it became increasingly difficult for Russian forces operating on the Kyiv axis to move food, fuel, ammunition, and other supplies to forward-deployed forces. These problems were compounded by the Russian army’s failure to provide convoy security to logistics vehicles, such as trucks carrying food, water, fuel, medical equipment, mobile kitchen equipment, and spare parts. Forward-deployed Russian vehicles broke down, but many had to be abandoned because of a lack of spare parts, mechanics, and recovery vehicles. The Russian military also lacked modern shipping containers, mechanized loaders, forklifts, or pallets to efficiently move supplies into Ukraine. Instead of a mechanized logistics system, Russia’s military relied on conscript labor to move gear, often in unwieldy wooden crates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cgZeYMJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Force-to-space ratio constraints generally help the defender — in this case NATO — by preventing the attacker from exploiting whatever local materiel superiority might be enjoyed at breakthrough points. The attacker strives to achieve overwhelming superiority at the breakthrough points by suddenly concentrating forces there. An attacker likely requires a local force advantage of at least 3:1 to open a breach in the defender’s front. If both sides have large forces at their disposal, however, the attacker may be unable to place enough units forward to gain a 3:1 advantage, even if it has local materiel superiority, simply because there is insufficient room at the front. Instead, the attacker must stack forces up behind the front, where they cannot contribute to the breakthrough battle. But stacking forces up puts them in danger of being targeted by long-range strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia faces considerable force-to-space ratio constraints in Eastern Europe today. A Russian buildup along NATO’s eastern flank, including in Belarus, would likely lead to a rapid NATO deterrent buildup in response — and deny Russia from gaining a force-to-space ratio advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative Rates of Reinforcement into Breakthrough Area:&lt;/strong&gt; A third factor affecting the balance is the relative rate of reinforcement into the breakthrough battle area. The defender must match the attacker’s concentration at the main point of attack. To do this, the defender — in this case NATO forces — must be able to move forces already in the theater. The defender must also be able to compete with the attacker in bringing outside forces into the theater. The defender’s basic aim is to ensure that the attacker does not win the breakthrough battle by wearing down the defender to the point where the defender has virtually no forces remaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most wargames over the past decade involving a Russian invasion in Eastern Europe — especially the Baltics — forward-deployed NATO ground forces were badly outgunned by Russia both by forces massing from mainland Russia but also from the heavily militarized enclave of Kaliningrad, located on the Baltic Sea between Lithuania and Poland. NATO airpower was able to impose significant attrition on attacking Russian forces, destroying the equivalent of two to three battalion equivalents per day in some games. But without a heavy NATO ground force to slow down Russian forces, NATO forces failed to halt the invasion. More recently, however, NATO has strengthened its eastern flank, improving its relative rate of reinforcement. For example, the Baltic region has been a focal point for NATO, which agreed on the Readiness Action Plan at the 2014 Wales summit and established the Enhanced Forward Presence at the 2016 Warsaw summit. This forward presence was first deployed in 2017, with the creation of four multinational battalion-size battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, led by the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and the United States, respectively. In the southeast, a tailored presence on land, at sea, and in the air contributed to increased allied activity in the region as well as enhanced situational awareness, interoperability, and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NjSrDYh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.3: Military Balance in Selected Air Forces, 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: IISS, The Military Balance 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, NATO reinforced the existing battlegroups and established four more multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. Known as the Eastern Flank Initiative, this brought the total number of multinational battlegroups to eight, effectively doubling the number of troops on the ground when fully established and extending NATO’s forward presence along the alliance’s eastern flank — from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four northeastern battlegroups (in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland) are under NATO’s Multinational Corps Northeast Headquarters in Szczecin, Poland. Two division-level headquarters coordinate the training and preparation activities of their respective battlegroups. Multinational Division Northeast Headquarters, located in Elblag, Poland, has been fully operational since December 2018. This headquarters works closely with the battlegroups in Poland and Lithuania. A complementary Multinational Division North Headquarters was activated by NATO in October 2020 and is moving toward full operational capability. Its forward elements are located in Adazi, Latvia, while the rest of the headquarters is located in Karup, Denmark. This headquarters cooperates closely with the battlegroups in Estonia and Latvia. At the 2022 NATO summit in Madrid, NATO allies agreed to enhance the multinational battlegroups from battalions up to brigade size, where and when required. These steps have changed the relative rates of reinforcement, making it more difficult for Russia to conduct a successful breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, an attacker’s penetrating armies will be vulnerable to counterattack since they will be moving forward rapidly on unfamiliar terrain at the head of long logistical columns. The defender therefore may be able to seal off the penetration if it rapidly brings reserves to bear. The size and quality of the defender’s reserves become important for this reason. Again, NATO has made adjustments over the past several years. NATO’s rapid reinforcement strategy ensures that forward-presence forces will be reinforced by NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), the broader NATO Response Force, additional high-readiness forces, and NATO’s heavier follow-on forces. At the 2022 Madrid summit, NATO agreed on a new NATO Force Model, which represented a broader expansion of high-readiness forces potentially available to NATO, where and when required. NATO allies have also agreed to boost NATO’s ability to reinforce its forces in the east by developing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More prepositioned equipment and weapons stockpiles;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More forward-deployed capabilities, including integrated air and missile defense systems;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthened command and control; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Upgraded defense plans, with specific forces preassigned to the defense of specific allies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility and Initiative of Attacking Forces:&lt;/strong&gt; The fourth factor is the ability of attacking forces to maximize flexibility and initiative. To forestall a successful counterattack, the attacker must take immediate advantage of the breakthrough opening and then maintain a rapid rate of advance to keep the defender constantly off balance. This is a demanding task because the commanders of the attacker’s forces, operating in a fog of war, will have to make rapid-fire decisions based on incomplete information while facing a constantly changing situation. A deep strategic penetration is best served by a flexible command and control structure and a joint force commanded at all levels by individuals capable of intelligently exercising initiative. Delegating responsibility to officers and non-commissioned officers who can make bold decisions in difficult circumstances maximizes the prospects that the attacking forces will not get bogged down, undermining the blitzkrieg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces currently lack flexibility and initiative. During the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, for example, a failure of small-unit cohesion and initiative likely contributed to the defeat of some Russian forces. Russian units included a mix of troops with variable levels of training, experience, and equipment — and with little time spent working together. The lack of a professional non-commissioned officer corps in the Russian army likely inhibited the cohesion of these units. Additional deficiencies included small-unit tactics and morale, which are usually the purview of junior and non-commissioned officers. Small-unit leaders failed to break with the Soviet tradition of passively waiting for orders, which discourages initiative and punishes mistakes. It did not help that many Russian soldiers were not informed that they were being sent to war, but were instead told they were headed to a training mission. Furthermore, the massive casualties among Russia’s contract soldiers — disproportionately concentrated among the airborne and special forces — in the first month of the war left many surviving soldiers deeply reluctant to embark on offensive operations. The most experienced troops who should have been critical to leading newly mobilized personnel were, in many cases, the most reluctant to conduct attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the Russian military — especially Russian ground forces — lacks sufficient initiative to be able to effectively execute a conventionally focused blitzkrieg operation against NATO countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geography:&lt;/strong&gt; Geography is a fifth factor impacting the outcome of a successful breakthrough battle. The defender generally prefers a front covered with obstacles — rivers, mountains, forests, swamps, jungles, and prepared defensive positions — so that there are few locations where the attacker can place a main axis of attack. The defender then has a good chance of predicting where the attacker will strike, minimizing the attacker’s prospects of outmaneuvering the defender. Also, a defender faced with few possible breakthrough points along the front can concentrate forces in front of them, since the defender does not have to worry much about the obstacle-ridden portion of the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geography poses a challenge for NATO in Eastern Europe, though it does not outweigh other factors, such as both sides’ relative capabilities and the attacker’s initiative. The Baltic states, for example, are largely flat, though the terrain is dotted with lakes, bogs, and marshes. In some places, off-road mobility could be difficult, especially during the rasputitsa — or thaw — when travel on unpaved roads becomes difficult because of muddy conditions caused by rain or melting snow. Still, there is a fairly robust network of roads and highways in the Baltics, and the distances are short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only 213 kilometers from Ivangorod, Russia, which is situated along the Russian-Estonian border, to Talinn along the E20 highway in flat terrain. Lithuania is in an even more precarious situation. There are multiple direct routes from Belarus to Vilnius, Lithuania’s capital, in relatively flat terrain. It is a short 35-kilometer drive from the border crossing at Kamenny Log to Vilnius along the E28 highway, and a 34-kilometer drive from the border crossing at Kotlovka to Vilnius along the 103 highway. Russia’s enclave in Kaliningrad could interfere with the movement of NATO forces into the Baltics. To move from Poland into Lithuania by land, for example, NATO forces would have to transit the “Kaliningrad corridor,” a 110- to 150-kilometer gap in Poland between the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and Belarus that could be attacked from both sides and could require substantial air, sea, and ground forces to secure. Instead of moving over land from Poland, NATO forces could arrive by air or by sea, but they would have to contend with Russian interdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland, which shares a 1,300-kilometer border with Russia, also presents a challenge for NATO. Finland’s geography is characterized by intermingled boreal forests and lakes, with archipelagoes and coastal lowlands in the south, a slightly higher central lake plateau, and uplands in the north and northeast. Northern and eastern Finland are sparsely populated and contain vast wilderness areas, with taiga forest as the dominant vegetation type. But the terrain in Finland is mostly flat, and it is only 191 kilometers from the Torfyanovka border crossing to Helsinki along the E18 highway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true of Poland, whose plains have made it susceptible to invasion throughout history, from the Mongols in the thirteenth century to the Nazi and Soviet invasions in the twentieth century. Poland’s geographic location is, in part, why Norman Davies titled his history of Poland God’s Playground. Poland’s relatively flat central terrain is partly why wargames of a Russian invasion of Poland, including Winter-20, have been bleak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these geographic features present challenges, they do not outweigh the other factors, such as the relative capabilities of the forces possessed by the sides, the force-to-space ratio, the relative rate at which each side can marshal and deploy reinforcements, and the individual initiative and flexibility of the attacker’s commanders. The conventional balance heavily favors NATO, which has a very good chance of defeating any conventional Russian attack in Eastern Europe. This reality is very different from the military balance in Central Europe for part of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nuclear Balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has improved its nuclear capabilities and still maintains the largest inventory of strategic weapons in the world, providing it with a strong deterrent capability against conventional and nuclear threats. Moscow has been — and will likely continue to be — committed to retaining a full range of sea-, land-, and air-based systems. Russia’s land‐based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are under the control of the Strategic Missile Forces, while sea‐ and air‐based strategic systems are operationally managed by the Russian navy and air force. Russia’s Aerospace Forces (VKS) brings together Russia’s aviation, air defense, and missile defense systems, as well as the country’s missile early-warning and space control and monitoring systems, under a unified and integrated command and control structure. Moscow may also be developing a nuclear space-based weapon capable of targeting satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, examples of Russian modernization priorities include: the RS-26 Avangard ICBM, equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle; the RS-28 Sarmat ICBM; the Poseidon nuclear-capable, long-range unmanned underwater vehicle; the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal (Dagger) air-launched high-speed ballistic missile; the Tu-160M strategic bomber; and the PAK-DA next-generation strategic bomber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Figure 3.4 highlights, however, the United States and NATO possess a strong nuclear deterrent. The United States has roughly 400 Minuteman III ICBMs. In addition, the U.S. arsenal includes roughly 280 Trident II D-5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), the United Kingdom has another 48 Trident I/II D5 SLBMs, and France has 64 M51 SLBMs. In addition, the United States currently possesses roughly 66 aircraft (B-2s and B-52s) capable of carrying nuclear weapons, while France has 40 Rafales. The certification of the F-35 as a dual-capable aircraft (DCA) will increase the number of tactical air delivery systems available in Europe. The result is near parity in the number of warheads: approximately 4,495 for Russia and roughly 4,300 for the United States, United Kingdom, and France. NATO’s strategic air-, land-, and maritime-based capabilities give it a viable second-strike capability and a strong deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l0j70Pb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.4: The Nuclear Balance in Selected Strategic Offensive Weapons, 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: IISS, The Military Balance 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is also modernizing its nuclear arsenal. For example, existing strategic delivery systems are undergoing modernization, including complete rebuilds of the Minuteman III ICBM and Trident II SLBM. The service lives of the Navy’s 14 Trident Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines are being extended. Additionally, Columbia-class submarines will replace Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines. The U.S. Air Force is also building a new strategic bomber, the B-21 Raider, and a new nuclear-capable cruise missile, the Long Range Stand Off Weapon, to replace the existing air-launched cruise missile. These modernization efforts will likely ensure that NATO retains a strong nuclear deterrent in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While NATO enjoys a robust nuclear deterrent, it is less clear whether Russia will be deterred from using nuclear weapons against a country outside of NATO, such as Ukraine. Any Russian use of nuclear weapons against any non-NATO country would cause significant political concern across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Threats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Russia, there are other threats to Europe. This section focuses on several threats: Iran, China, terrorism, illegal immigration, and illegal drug trafficking. These represent the most acute threats to Europe over the next decade. There are other threats — involving climate change, pandemics, energy, and cyber — that also present long-term threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran:&lt;/strong&gt; European states will likely face a lingering threat from Iran, including from long-range missiles. Under the oversight of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Forces, Iran will likely continue to field more accurate and longer-range missiles over the next decade, as Figure 3.6 highlights. A ballistic missile based on Iran’s Zoljanah space launch vehicle could carry a one-ton warhead as far as 5,000 kilometers, allowing Iran to strike every European capital. These developments will supplement other Iranian missiles, such as the Shahab-3 and Khorramshahr medium-range ballistic missiles, which have an operational range of up to 2,000 kilometers. Iran also has layered area denial and anti-surface warfare capabilities, including naval mining (such as moored contact, drifting contact, and limpet mines), small boat swarming tactics, and coastal defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are serious challenges with Europe’s integrated air and missile defense capabilities, particularly in ground-based air defense, command and control, and defense against emerging advanced threats. The European Sky Shield Initiative, which is led by Germany, could theoretically address some of these problems. But it is under significant political pressure, and several countries, such as France, Poland, and Italy, have opted out of the initiative. The result is that European missile defense capabilities are a poorly integrated jumble of capabilities. For example, France and Italy possess SAMP/T ground-based air defense missile systems; Germany and the Netherlands have the Patriot surface-to-air missile system; and Greece and Romania have Patriot, SA-20, and I-HAWK systems. There are numerous future plans in the works. For instance, NATO’s ballistic missile defense program is unlikely to be fully operational until roughly 2030. Most of the European countries developing sea-based, lower-layer ballistic missile defense are forecasting delays — including to the development of a suitable interceptor missile — through the end of the decade. The U.S. contribution to NATO’s ballistic missile defense architecture will remain critical, including the Aegis Ashore and periodic rotation of the Terminal High Altitude Aerial Defense (THAAD) missile defense system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China:&lt;/strong&gt; Security competition between the United States and China has increased — and will likely continue to increase over the next decade. But there are different views of the Chinese threat in European capitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom, for example, has been critical of China’s crackdowns in Hong Kong, has been willing to speak out about China’s human rights abuses, and is increasingly vocal about the threat from China. The head of MI5, the United Kingdom’s domestic intelligence agency, bluntly remarked in 2022 that the “most game-changing challenge we face comes from the Chinese Communist Party. It’s covertly applying pressure across the globe.” France, which has overseas departments, territories, and communities in the Indo-Pacific, has established a harder line against China than many European countries. In addition, Denmark’s economic relationship with China is limited, and its leaders have been wary of Chinese intentions in Greenland and the Arctic. Denmark joined the U.S.-led Export Controls and Human Rights Initiative, alongside Australia, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom, which is designed to stem the flow of sensitive technologies to authoritarian governments such as China. Lithuania has faced economic coercion from China for its moves to recognize a Taiwanese office in Vilnius as well as for withdrawing from an economic initiative focusing on China and Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But other European countries have been less concerned about China. Germany’s relationship with China is complicated due to Germany’s dependence on Chinese manufacturing and markets. For example, a study from a German industry association found that “approximately 5,200 German companies comprising over one million employees” were operating in China and that many more had “large sums of investments tied up in China.” This situation has created some German dependencies on Chinese supply chains and value creation networks, and the Chinese shipping giant COSCO bought a 35 percent stake in a container terminal at the port of Hamburg. In Greece, China’s COSCO now owns more than 51 percent of the commercial port of Piraeus, which is often used by NATO for port visits, exercise staging, and transport. This dependency raises questions about whether Greece might hesitate to act (or be constrained from acting) in a conflict with China. Italy has also established close relations with China. For example, Italy signed a memorandum of understanding with China, which is valid until 2024, in support of the Belt and Road Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A majority of Europeans are opposed to engaging in conflict with China, according to some survey data. Similarly, a majority believe that they are not in any type of a Cold War with China, though a growing percentage also say their views of China have worsened over time and expressed concern about Chinese ownership of key infrastructure. The populations of Sweden and the Netherlands have the most unfavorable views of China, while those of Greece, Hungary, Italy, and several other countries have more favorable views. A substantial percentage of Europeans (36 percent) consider China to be a necessary partner. Only 12 percent of all respondents in one survey saw China as an adversary. Some polling also suggests that a large majority of European populations would prefer to remain neutral in a conflict between the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These realities suggest that there are differences among European governments and populations about the perceived threat posed by China. This is an important consideration for U.S. military planners and political leaders: it is not clear nor inevitable that NATO and Europe writ large can be counted on to join military actions in the Indo-Pacific through 2030. And this may be an acceptable outcome in order to maintain some strategic balance against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terrorism:&lt;/strong&gt; Terrorism in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia will likely present a continuing threat to Europe. Salafi-jihadist groups linked to the Islamic State and al Qaeda are active across these regions. There are several groups linked to al Qaeda, including Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahidin (or al Shabaab) in Somalia; Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin in West Africa; Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham in Syria; Hurras al-Din in Syria; al Qaeda core and al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent in Afghanistan; and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen. There are also several groups linked to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Islamic State), including the leadership in Iraq and Syria; the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara in West Africa; Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis in Egypt; the Islamic State-Libya; the Islamic State-Khorasan; the Islamic State-Yemen, Islamic State networks in Somalia, which host the al-Karrar office. In addition, Shia groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah, continue to operate in Europe, though primarily to fundraise and recruit individuals rather than plot attacks. The most significant external terrorist threat to Europe is likely attacks by individuals inspired by the Islamic State or al Qaeda — especially with connections to the Middle East and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illegal Immigration:&lt;/strong&gt; Europe faces a continuing threat from illegal immigration, including human trafficking for all forms of exploitation, such as labor and sexual exploitation. Migrant-smuggling networks transport individuals illegally through the Western, Central, and Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans into Europe, requiring extensive monitoring. In 2021, Belarus organized immigrants from the Middle East, including Iraqi Kurdistan, to cross into Poland. It was part of a political coercion campaign by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, who threatened to “flood” the European Union with illegal immigrants and drug traffickers. In response, European countries have been involved in efforts to detect, monitor, and counter the movement of illegal immigrants, including European Union Naval Force Mediterranean, Operation Triton, Operation Themis, and Operation Mare Nostrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illegal Drug Trafficking:&lt;/strong&gt; European states will likely face persistent threats from illegal drugs and drug trafficking, including from cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, methamphetamines, MDMA, and other drugs. In response, European states are likely to remain focused on detecting, monitoring, and countering the production and trafficking of illegal drugs coming from West and South Asia, South America, North Africa, and other regions. Recent European counter-drug campaigns have included the European Union Military Operation in the Central African Republic and Operation Atalanta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Threats:&lt;/strong&gt; European states will also face several other threats. One is from pandemics, such as new strains of influenza or a novel coronavirus. Another is from climate change. Concerns about global climate change are likely to remain high in many European countries, as such events as wildfires, floods, and extreme heat cause significant disruption across the continent. Worries about climate change are not shared by all Europeans and are generally lower among those who support far-right populist parties. In Germany, for instance, only 55 percent of supporters of the Alternative for Germany party view climate change as a major threat, compared with 77 percent of those who do not support the party. Similar divisions also appear in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Europe will also continue to face a threat from cyberattacks from a range of state and non-state actors, including China, Russia, and Iran. Finally, Europe will likely face a persistent energy crisis because of a decline in Russian gas deliveries, supply chain disruptions, and volatility in the oil and gas markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible Wildcards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these threats, Russia will likely remain the most significant threat to Europe in the foreseeable future, and there are several wildcards that could change the conventional military balance in Europe. This section focuses on several possibilities: U.S. involvement in a major war outside of Europe, a Russian military buildup with assistance from China and other countries, and erosion of U.S. or European political will. These are by no means the only possibilities, though they are plausible wildcards that could significantly impact the threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major War Outside of Europe:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States could become overstretched with a major theater war in another region, such as against China in the Indo-Pacific. European conventional and logistical capabilities are limited — particularly for high-end war — and U.S. involvement in a major war in another region could potentially alter the balance in Europe. One example is a war between the United States and China over Taiwan. There are at least two major implications for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the United States would likely require significant resources in a Taiwan conflict, including air defense systems, such as Patriots; long-range bombers, such as the B-21; long-range precision strike capabilities, such as the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER); and submarines, such as Virginia-class and Columbia-class vessels. Overall, the requirements and political attention necessary for a U.S. war with China in the Indo-Pacific would likely require deploying U.S. Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and possibly Army personnel and capabilities to the Indo-Pacific for an extended period. It is likely that a war could be protracted, dragging out for months or longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the United States would likely lose a significant portion of its military forces, especially in a protracted war. In the more pessimistic scenario from a recent CSIS wargame, for example, the United States loses nearly 500 aircraft and 14 surface combatant ships. Roughly 90 percent of U.S. aircraft losses occur while they sit on airfields, not in the air. Across scenarios, the United States typically loses more than 500 U.S. aircraft in all, as well as at least two aircraft carriers and between 10 and 20 large surface combatants. These high losses occur because U.S. aircraft and surface ships deploy forward to strike at the Chinese fleet, particularly the amphibious forces, before establishing air and maritime dominance. Chinese losses are also high, with over 300 aircraft losses and over 100 surface combatant ships destroyed. Overall, Chinese air losses varied across the wargame scenarios from several dozen to over 700.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Taiwan conflict, the United States would likely have to shift considerable military resources and political focus to the Indo-Pacific and away from Europe. U.S. military power would also be eroded through attrition. This could have at least two consequences. It could change the conventional balance in Europe by requiring the United States to pull some military forces out of Europe and deploy them to the Indo-Pacific. In addition, Russia could be emboldened to conduct offensive actions against the Baltic states, Poland, Finland, or another country. A U.S. withdrawal of forces to another theater, such as the Indo-Pacific, could create a window of opportunity for offensive actions by Russian leaders, who may conclude that the advantages of defense in Europe have weakened. Historically, leaders have developed offensive military strategies when they possess revisionist war aims and believe the balance of power is shifting in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also conceivable that the United States could become involved in a major war elsewhere — such as against North Korea, Iran, or terrorist groups in the Middle East or South Asia — which Russian leaders could attempt to exploit. Following Hamas’ brutal attack against Israel on October 7, 2023, conflict in the Middle East expanded to include Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian Military Modernization:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia could significantly rebuild its conventional capabilities — as well as further invest in asymmetric ones — with help from China and other countries, such as North Korea and Iran. Russia is attempting to reconstitute its land forces to prepare for deterrence and warfighting against NATO. The Russian army will likely continue to move away from battalion formations to infantry, marine, and airborne divisions. This would mark a significant shift away from the changes implemented under former minister of defence Anatoly Serdyukov, who scrapped the Soviet-era structure of the armed forces that included large divisions as part of the “New Look” reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Russian military leaders have indicated an intention to create at least nine new divisions: five artillery divisions, including super-heavy artillery brigades for building artillery reserves; two air assault divisions in the Russian Airborne Forces, bringing its force structure to roughly equal with Soviet times; and two motorized infantry divisions integrated into combined arms forces. The Ministry of Defence will likely transform seven motorized infantry brigades into motorized infantry divisions in the Western, Central, and Eastern Districts, as well as in the Northern Fleet. It will also likely expand an army corps in Karelia, across the border from Finland. In addition, each combined arms (tank) army may have a composite aviation division within it and an army aviation brigade with 80 to 100 combat helicopters under the control of ground force units — not the Russian Aerospace Forces. This decision was likely a result of the poor joint operations in Ukraine, especially air-land battle, though it does not fix poor coordination between Russian land and air forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian leaders have expressed an interest in strengthening Russian naval forces — including submarines — in response to growing tensions with the United States and NATO. The Ministry of Defence has announced a desire to create five naval infantry brigades for the navy’s coastal troops based on existing naval infantry brigades. This expansion followed Russia’s adoption of a new maritime doctrine in July 2022, which identified the United States and NATO as major threats. In addition, the doctrine expressed an interest in building modern aircraft carriers, though it also highlighted the challenges of Russia’s lack of overseas naval bases and the constraints on Russia’s shipbuilding industry because of the West’s economic sanctions. Senior Russian officials have identified nuclear-powered submarines as critical in future force design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing could accelerate Russian military modernization. China possesses significant fifth-generation military capabilities, technology, and money that could impact the European balance of power if Beijing calculated that it was in its interest to help Russia modernize its military. The Chinese Communist Party’s 14th Five Year Plan, which goes through 2025, calls for accelerated development of military mechanization, informatization, and “intelligentization.” China is focusing on military applications for such areas as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, biotechnology, information technology, quantum computing, robotics, advanced materials and manufacturing, and deep-sea technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is developing the J-20A and J-20B fifth-generation stealth fighter, armed stealth unmanned aircraft systems, and the J-31 medium-weight stealth fighter by 2025. China is also developing kinetic kill vehicle technology to field an upper-tier ballistic missile interceptor by 2030; longer-range, more accurate, and increasingly lethal ballistic and cruise missiles; air defenses; and other platforms and systems. The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLANAF) is fielding new carrier-based aircraft, as well as anti-submarine warfare, helicopters, unmanned aircraft, land-based maritime strike, and air defense forces. China may have as many as five aircraft carriers by 2030, aided by helicopter carriers and a fleet of destroyers. The development of China’s space, counterspace, and electronics sectors has enabled it to increase the pace of satellite launches and deploy a wider range of sophisticated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) satellites. Some modeling suggests that the effectiveness of the Chinese submarine fleet (as measured by the number of attack opportunities it might achieve against carriers) has risen significantly over the past 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these developments, China could potentially provide significant air, land, and maritime weapon systems and technology to Russia through exports, joint development projects, funding, or other arrangements that facilitate a Russian defense revitalization. After all, Russia and China have pledged to deepen defense cooperation through arms sales, military exercises, and other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eroding Political Will:&lt;/strong&gt; An erosion of European — or U.S. — political will could weaken NATO’s cohesion and threaten its ability to project and conduct credible deterrence. Political will refers to the proclivity and decision of political leaders to conduct activities, including military activities. Politics and war are deeply intertwined. As the Prussian general and theorist Carl von Clausewitz argued, “war is not merely a political act, but also a real political instrument, a continuation of political commerce, a carrying out of the same by other means.” For Clausewitz, will is an essential component of military operations: “If we desire to defeat the enemy, we must proportion our efforts to his powers of resistance. This is expressed by the product of two factors which cannot be separate, namely, the sum of available means and the strength of the Will.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, economists and political scientists who study the logic of collective action have identified burden sharing as a persistent problem in multinational organizations. Larger, richer allies step up to provide a public good, which leads to free-riding behavior by smaller, less wealthy allies. For NATO, deterrence and collective defense became that public good during the Cold War. During this period, there was a close correlation between allies’ GDPs and their respective levels of defense spending. Larger allies were willing to tolerate a degree of free riding in light of the existential, overarching threat posed by the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors — such as strategic culture, domestic constraints, voluntary force recruitment challenges, technology usage concerns, differences in threat perception, or even an economic depression — could undermine the political will of European countries or the United States to sufficiently deter Russia. For example, domestic constraints can undermine political will. They can be political, such as the degree of fragmentation within a government or friction between different elements in the bureaucracy. The former is particularly problematic in Europe, where coalition or minority governments are becoming the norm rather than the exception. Some countries attempt to reduce fragmentation and limit “ministerial drift” by locking in their priorities and policies through formal coalition agreements (e.g., Germany) or cross-party defense agreements (e.g., Denmark).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic constraints on political will can also be structural. These include legal limitations on deployment of forces, requirements for parliamentary approval to deploy forces, and operational caveats on deployments. In Afghanistan, only a few countries (such as Denmark, Georgia, Poland, the United States, and the United Kingdom) operated caveat-free, with most imposing restrictions on everything from the rules of engagement to the geographic areas in which their forces were able to operate. Legal limitations on the deployment of forces, requirements for parliamentary approval to deploy forces, domestic politics and logrolling, and imposition of operational caveats on deployments and the use of certain technologies will remain a challenge for some European countries and could impact their willingness to build sufficient capabilities to deter Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2024 U.S. elections also raise major questions about U.S. political will in Europe. It is possible, for example, that Donald Trump could withdraw from NATO in a second term, raising serious questions about credible deterrence against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Wildcards:&lt;/strong&gt; There are several other wildcards that could change the balance in Europe or otherwise impact the threat landscape. First, Russia could successfully use an irregular or a limited aims strategy in Eastern Europe. The goal of an irregular strategy would be to destabilize one or more European countries through subversion rather than a conventional military campaign. This could include, for example, aiding non-state actors in the Baltic states or other countries — including pro-Russian populations — to cause instability. Moscow adopted this type of a strategy in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russia could also adopt a limited-aims strategy and seize only a portion of territory in Europe or Central Asia. Second, a leadership change in Russia could create a more dangerous — or friendlier — neighbor, impacting the threat from Russia. Third, Russia could use nuclear weapons, including battlefield nuclear weapons against Ukraine, breaking the nuclear taboo that has existed since 1945. This would cause significant concerns in European capitals about the threat from Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the evidence presented in this chapter suggests, NATO likely possesses a strong conventional and nuclear deterrent against a possible Russian threat in the short term. Other potential threats to Europe — such as Iran, China, terrorism, illegal migration, illegal drug trafficking, pandemics, and climate change — do not pose an existential crisis in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the long term, however, Russia will likely constitute a serious threat to the United States and Europe. Russian president Vladimir Putin retains the political will and intentions to expand Russian power abroad, and Russia is reconstituting its military capabilities with help from China, Iran, and North Korea. The military balance could shift, and deterrence could weaken — perhaps significantly — if the United States were to become involved in a major war in the Indo-Pacific or another region, if Russia were able to rearm and rebuild with Chinese and other assistance, or if U.S. or European political will eroded. The key takeaway is that neither today’s military balance nor deterrence is guaranteed ad infinitum. To help understand the future military balance in Europe, the next chapter examines European military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ch-04&quot;&gt;CH. 04&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;european-military-capabilities&quot;&gt;EUROPEAN MILITARY CAPABILITIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines European military capabilities. Any analysis of U.S. force posture in Europe needs to assess European military capabilities at present and in the future, which is reflected in NATO’s own 2030 plan from the Brussels summit and the subsequent 2022 Strategic Concept from the Madrid summit. This chapter asks one central question: What types of missions will European allies and partners of the United States be able and unable to effectively perform by 2030?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, this chapter uses a combination of methods. It builds an analytical framework that includes a range of military missions, from small-scale humanitarian assistance missions to large-scale combat. The chapter then uses this framework to evaluate the ability of European countries to accomplish these missions. It also builds a data set of specific European operations over the past three decades, including operations conducted through NATO and the European Union. The data provide a useful context for the types and frequency of missions in which European states may engage. Finally, it uses the results and analyses from wargames, scenarios, exercises, after-action reviews, and other analyses to assess the ability of European states to perform military missions through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the analysis, this chapter makes two main arguments. First, if member states meet their “NATO 2030” goals, most NATO militaries will likely be able to conduct the majority of military missions by 2030 at the lower end of the conflict continuum with little or no U.S. assistance. But European militaries will likely have difficulty conducting operations at the higher end of the conflict continuum without significant assistance from the United States. European states still lack sufficient capabilities in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Combat support, such as short-range air defense and long-range indirect fires;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Airlift and other logistical means of transporting troops and material;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quantity, quality, and capabilities of ground forces, especially heavy maneuver forces;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maritime capabilities, including sensors (such as sub-surface sensors) and survivability systems;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sufficient quantities of long-range precision strike, such as the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-spectrum ranges to train and maintain high-readiness forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help make up for some of these shortfalls, Chapter 6 outlines several security cooperation steps to improve European military capabilities. Nevertheless, the most significant obstacle to fixing these capability gaps is a lack of political will in European capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, most European militaries will likely continue to face serious challenges projecting power into regions such as the Indo-Pacific. They lack significantly deployable capabilities in such areas as anti-submarine warfare; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); ballistic missile defense; air precision strike; suppression of enemy air defense; and expeditionary logistics. What capabilities European allies do have in these categories should likely be prioritized for a Europe-based fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter is divided into three sections. The first develops a framework for understanding and analyzing military missions. The second section assesses European participation in military missions through 2030. The third section provides a summary of the main conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;framework-for-understanding-military-missions&quot;&gt;FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING MILITARY MISSIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter focuses on the ability of European militaries to perform a mission, a military task to complete an action with a specific purpose. An important metric of military power is the ability of military forces to successfully prosecute a variety of missions. Military missions are often categorized by their focus. Examples include noncombatant evacuation, foreign humanitarian assistance, security force assistance, freedom of navigation, counternarcotics, counterterrorism, and large-scale combat missions. Military missions are distinct from civilian missions in that they are conducted by military personnel, even if the activities lack a uniquely martial component. In addition, this chapter also discusses military operations, which include specific military actions to carry out strategic, operational, tactical, or other objectives. As used here, missions refer to the general tasks that militaries are asked to perform, while operations refer to specific, named efforts. Named operations include such examples as Operation Allied Force in Kosovo, Operation Unified Protector in Libya, Operation Concordia in the former Yugoslavia, and Operation Sea Guardian in the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the policy focus on European capabilities has been on tracking quantitative metrics. For example, NATO has collected and analyzed such metrics as the percent of GDP that a country spends on defense and procurement of major new equipment (including research and development), the percent of allied forces that are deployable, the percent of allied forces that are sustainable, and contributions to NATO Command Structure positions. While valuable, these metrics do not provide a good indication of whether countries will be able to perform specific military missions. Most do not translate defense spending or military capabilities into whether and how countries will be able to perform on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing military performance is a complex undertaking. How a state — or states — perform in conducting military missions can include a wide range of factors, such as strategy, tactics, morale, numerical preponderance, technology, combat motivation, force employment, leadership, and materiel. Other factors are also important, such as readiness, sustainability, modernization, and force structure. In fact, NATO countries spend an average of 40 percent of their defense budgets on personnel costs, with an emphasis on recruiting and retaining an all-volunteer force. Some countries, such as Spain and Italy, spend roughly 60 percent on personnel. These estimates do not include equipping and fielding the fighting force, which leads to inaccurate or incomplete metrics on how well an individual NATO member state may perform on any given military mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters, military forces frequently perform a wide range of missions, such as countering terrorists, deterring aggressors, conducting peace-keeping efforts, enforcing sanctions, performing freedom of navigation missions, and training foreign police and soldiers. Proficiency in one or several missions does not indicate proficiency in all or even most missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand military missions, this chapter divides missions into three categories: small-scale missions; medium-scale missions; and large-scale combat. These categories can be differentiated by their scale and scope. Small-scale missions, for example, are at one end of the conflict continuum and generally include limited or no combat. Large-scale combat sits at the other end of the conflict continuum and can involve joint, multi-domain operations involving the air, ground, maritime, cyber, and space domains. Figure 4.1 provides an overview of the types of military missions and examples of current and historical operations involving European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, small-scale missions sit at one end of the conflict continuum. They include such activities as noncombatant evacuation operations (NEOs), peace-keeping, and foreign humanitarian assistance efforts. NEOs involve situations in which military forces attempt to evacuate noncombatants from foreign countries when their lives are endangered by war, civil unrest, or natural disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peacekeeping consists of military support to diplomatic, economic, or other efforts to establish or maintain peace in areas of potential or actual conflict — often to support such regional or international institutions as the United Nations or African Union. As highlighted in Figure 4.1, historical examples involving European countries include Operation Concordia and Operation Allied Harmony in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and numerous operations in support of UN peacekeeping efforts across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, humanitarian assistance involves the use of military forces to reduce human suffering, pandemics, disease, or hunger. Examples of foreign humanitarian assistance include the European Union Force Chad and Central African Republic and NATO’s humanitarian relief efforts in Pakistan following the October 2005 earthquake, which killed an estimated 53,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, medium-scale missions include a wide range of activities to establish, shape, and maintain relations with other nations. The general objective is to protect national interests by building or maintaining support to partner nations, enhancing their capability to provide security and maintain stability, and establishing operational access. Security cooperation involves military interactions with foreign security agencies to build or maintain defense relationships, develop their capabilities, and provide access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crisis management missions include efforts to conduct expeditionary air, land, and maritime deployments. Many of these specific operations — such as Operation Allied Force, Operation Deliberate Force, and Operation Unified Protector — involve multiservice military deployments that require several thousand personnel. NATO’s Operation Unified Protector, for instance, had three components: the enforcement of an arms embargo in the Mediterranean, the enforcement of a no-fly zone to prevent aircraft from bombing civilian targets, and air and naval strikes against those military forces involved in attacks or threats to attack Libyan civilians and civilian-populated areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of activities can also involve deterrence (which includes actions to persuade an adversary not to initiate a war or other military activity because the expected costs and risks outweigh the anticipated benefits) and assurance (which includes actions to support an ally or partner’s government and population and communicate a credible message of confidence in the dependability of its security commitment). Assurance measures might involve flying airborne warning and control systems (AWACS), deploying Patriot air defense systems, conducting enhanced air policing, deploying a ship or a maritme strike group off a threatened country’s coast, rotating high-readiness forces into a particular country or region, and utilizing surface-to-air, medium-range platform terrain (SAMP/T) systems. NATO created the tailored Forward Presence in 2016 to help reassure Bulgaria and Romania and establish a Black Sea presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, large-scale combat sits at the other end of the conflict spectrum from crisis response. Large-scale combat involves a series of tactical actions — such as battles — conducted by combat forces to achieve strategic or operational objectives. It can include a range of activities, from wars in specific countries or regions involving a combination of multidomain air, ground, maritime, and other capabilities, to world wars among great powers. These types of missions generally require substantial power-projection capabilities, including the ability to deploy and employ military forces rapidly over long distances and for sustained periods. Historical examples involving European countries include Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, as highlighted in Figure 4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessment-of-european-capabilities&quot;&gt;ASSESSMENT OF EUROPEAN CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section applies the framework outlined in Figure 4.1 to analyze European capabilities to perform specific missions. It provides a qualitative judgment of European capabilities through 2030 — especially from major powers such as France, the United Kingdom, and Germany — based on the results and analyses from wargames, scenarios, exercises, after-action reviews, and other analyses. The goal is to provide reasonable estimates of whether European states may be able to conduct future missions across the continuum of conflict in four regions: Europe (including the Mediterranean), the Middle East, Africa (especially North, West, and East Africa), and the Indo-Pacific. These are the regions where European forces are most likely to deploy in the future, based on future planning considerations and past actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment is based on whether the evidence from wargames and other analyses suggests that European states can successfully conduct the designated mission with no, limited, or significant U.S. support. In Figure 4.2, “High” (or green) means that the major European states — such as the United Kingdom, France, and Germany — generally have the capability to successfully conduct the designated type of mission in the identified region without U.S. aid. A “high” judgment is not a fact or a certainty, however, and such judgments still carry a risk of being wrong. “Medium” (or yellow) means that major European states have the capability to successfully conduct the designated type of mission in the identified region with moderate U.S. aid, such as transport, aerial refueling, or ISR capabilities. “Low” (or red) means that major European states have the capability to successfully conduct the designated mission in the identified region only with significant U.S. aid. Figure 4.2 provides a summary of the main findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small-Scale Missions:&lt;/strong&gt; Major European states have a high likelihood of performing most small-scale missions through at least 2030 with limited U.S. aid or, in some cases, with none at all. NATO 2030 provides a set of targets that individual allies and the broader NATO alliance are expected to meet. Europe’s ability to perform critical missions is especially high in Europe, the Middle East, and parts of East, West, and North Africa, though there may still be challenges in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, European states may face difficulties conducting some missions in Asia and parts of Africa because of limited posture (especially bases), few enablers (such as airlift, aerial refueling, maritime logistics, command and control, and ISR), and a large geographic area. These factors could also impact the speed that European militaries could respond to contingency missions because of the small number of European personnel in the region and a vast geographic area. Germany, for instance, already faces airlift, combat search and rescue, and other limitations that will complicate noncombatant evacuation and other missions in Asia or parts of Africa. Although German chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a €100 billion ($106 billion) special fund for Bundeswehr development — including a heavy focus on air capabilities — shortly after Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the allocation will primarily finance existing military plans that had been unfunded or underfunded rather than support new developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the deployment of Russian and Chinese assets — including intelligence, electronic warfare, and anti-aircraft weapons systems — could complicate missions in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Russia has expanded its military presence in the Middle East and Africa, particularly in countries such as Syria and Libya. China continues to build military and civilian infrastructure in countries such as Djibouti, where France has a significant military presence, and Chinese private security companies such as China Security Technology Group (中国安保技术集团), Hua Xin Zhong An (Beijing) Security Service (HXZA) (华信中安集团), and Zhongjun Junhong (中军军弘安保集团) conduct armed maritime escort and other security services in strategic waterways in Africa and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, growing competition could lead Moscow and Beijing to pressure some host-nation countries in these regions to limit or reject U.S. and European militaries from using their air bases or ports or to deny overflight access. During the Cold War, for example, the Soviet Union routinely pressured foreign countries to refuse U.S. basing rights and overflight permission for operations that Moscow opposed. Already, Russia has helped to dislodge French, EU, and UN missions in countries such as Mali, including through the use of private military companies and other quasi-independent proxies. Russia is unlikely to replicate this approach widely outside of states with weak governance and autocratic leadership, but China may prove more capable in this regard. By 2030, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) probably will be able to deploy and sustain military forces across Asia and much of Africa, and will likely maintain a lower level of power-projection capabilities in areas with key Chinese economic interests, such as Latin America and the Middle East. Chinese competence may include military airlift and sealift capabilities, and its efforts to expand overseas basing and logistics infrastructure may enable the intelligence, logistics, and communications support needed to deal with threats to China or to disrupt its adversaries’ global operations. China may also have the ability and posture to deploy aircraft carrier strike groups to the Indian and Pacific Oceans by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ESXIrEl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.2: Overview of European Capabilities to Perform Missions.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium-Scale Missions:&lt;/strong&gt; Europe’s largest militaries will likely be able to perform numerous medium-scale missions through 2030 with limited U.S. assistance — especially in Europe and the Middle East — and potentially beyond 2030 with enhanced capabilities as a result of NATO’s 2030 plan. For example, European militaries will be able to conduct numerous deterrence missions in Europe. Similarly, European militaries likely will be able to conduct most assurance missions to support governments and their populations, such as flying AWACS, conducting enhanced air policing, and deploying SAMP/T systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France is likely to retain sufficient capabilities to conduct many of these missions in Europe, the Middle East, and possibly West Africa. France has undertaken medium-footprint expeditionary interventions, such as the 4,000-troop mission to defeat Islamist militants in Mali in 2013 to 2014. In recent years, however, France has experienced diplomatic setbacks in West Africa that may limit its ability to operate in the region, including the termination of Operation Barkhane in Mali and deteriorating relationships with other West African states. Nonetheless, through 2030, France will likely retain a sustained capability to conduct unilateral and joint expeditionary operations, especially as it resolves its shortfalls in aerial refueling, strategic and tactical airlift, unmanned aircraft systems, and precision-guided munitions. In addition, the French navy will likely remain capable of performing freedom of navigation, counterpiracy, counter smuggling, counternarcotics, and presence patrols — especially in such areas as the Mediterranean Sea, North Atlantic, Red Sea, and Arctic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the United Kingdom will likely be able to perform many of these medium-scale missions through 2030 in Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. But the United Kingdom will likely have significant limitations operating in the Indo-Pacific, where there are at least 1.7 million UK citizens. The United Kingdom is attempting to expand its presence and activity and conduct such missions as freedom of navigation and maritime patrol. The United Kingdom has conducted some exercises in the Indo-Pacific — including with Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, and New Zealand — to enable it to play at least a limited role. In addition, the United Kingdom is developing a fifth-generation carrier strike group and investing in some next-generation capabilities, such as directed energy weapons and swarming drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, European states will likely retain sufficient capabilities to perform several of these missions. France, the United Kingdom, and several other European countries — such as Germany — maintain competent special operations forces, allowing them to conduct security force assistance, counterterrorism, and other types of missions. In addition, Europe has several competent law enforcement and paramilitary forces — such as France’s Gendarmerie and Italy’s Carabinieri — capable of security force assistance, including training and advising foreign security forces. Several European states — such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom — will also likely retain significant capabilites to conduct offensive and defensive cyber operations, including against higher-end threats such as Russia and China. Despite these capabilities, some European states may be hesitant to integrate offensive cyber capabilities into multilateral operations because of national sensitivities. European countries are also improving their ability to build computer network resilience, cyber institutions, and response strategies, which will likely improve their ability to engage in offensive and defensive cyber missions. Finally, European countries will also likely have sufficient capabilities to conduct deterrence and assurance missions, such as enhanced air policing, maritime patrol aircraft, and forward-deployed troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European states may face several types of challenges, based on a review of wargames and other analyses. First, they will likely face some problems in the Indo-Pacific region and parts of Africa with conducting military engagement, security cooperation, and similar types of missions without help from the United States and other partners. France has some bases in New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Mayotte, Réunion, Djibouti, and the United Arab Emirates. The United Kingdom likewise has overseas bases in Brunei and Diego Garcia. Still, European militaries — even France and the United Kingdom — lack sufficient basing, airlift, logistics, aerial refueling, and power-projection capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, if planned new investments are not realized, air and naval patrol missions could become challenging even within Europe. Personnel shortages, low aircraft-readiness rates, and some allies’ lack of investment in integrated air and missile defense capabilities will likely inhibit future missions. Staff air patrol shortfalls, for example, have impacted missions in some areas such as the Black Sea. Fortunately, several allies are currently investing in ground-based air defense, short-range air defense, new fighter jets, and long-range patrol assets that will be in service by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if current defense plans are not realized, some types of maritime patrol missions could be impacted by shortages in frigates, problems with information sharing, and limited specialized capabilities such as anti-submarine warfare (ASW). Operation Sea Guardian, which occurred in the Mediterranean, was chronically underresourced and faced particularly acute shortfalls in such areas as naval vessels (including surface combatants) and maritime patrol aircraft. The German navy, for example, will likely continue to face personnel shortages, maintenance delays, spare part shortfalls, and procurement challenges. The major allies recognize these deficencies and are investing significantly in frigates and other ASW platforms that will enter service by 2030, if not sooner. Nevertheless, challenges may remain acute in the Indo-Pacific region, with such significant distances to cover in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, shortfalls could impact some types of security force assistance missions, especially in countries that face high levels of terrorism and insurgency and present a non-permissive environment. In the NATO Training Mission Iraq, there were shortfalls in filling Mobile Training Teams as well as force protection concerns. The NATO mission in Kosovo, called Kosovo Force, faced personnel and intelligence shortfalls, including in human and signals intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large-Scale Combat:&lt;/strong&gt; European states are likely to face significant challenges conducting large-scale combat missions, particularly in such areas as heavy maneuver forces, naval combatants, and support capabilities such as logistics and fire support. While much of this section focuses on European challenges in conducting large-scale combat involving Russia, China, or Iran, there are some broader problems that may impact large-scale combat. For example, while NATO 2030 lays out an ambitious agenda for all member states to improve their national capabilties, it is unclear whether European states will realize planned major improvements in the interoperability of their forces regarding the usability of land maneuver formations; suppression of enemy air defense; electronic warfare; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense; and medical support to operations. It is also unlikely that European militaries will be able to operate at scale in high-end scenarios against countries such as Russia and China without significant U.S. assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, challenges in the land and maritime domains will likely impact Europe’s ability to successfully perform high-end missions. While there may be new main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and armored personnel carriers, it is unclear if European militaries will adequately fix problems in combat support and training or address widespread shortfalls in materiel stockpiles by 2030. Significant numbers of infantry battalions are likely to lack their required combat capabilities over the next decade, half of all combat brigades may lack short-range air defense, and roughly one-quarter of infantry divisions may lack long-range indirect fire capabilities. Maritime capabilities also pose a challenge for large-scale combat, including a qualitative shortfall in sensors (including sub-surface sensors), weapons, force protection, and survivability systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, European militaries are improving their capabilities in some areas. For example, European combat air capabilities will likely improve, with the shift to fifth-generation combat aircraft and improvement in air-to-air refueling, transport, and cargo capabilities because of the multinational Multi Role Tanker Transport aircraft fleet. Members of the F-35 consortium — such as Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom — are transitioning their fourth-generation F-16 fighters to fifth-generation F-35s. Several aspects of the F-35s, such as stealth and data-sharing capabilities, will be particularly helpful in conducting large-scale combat missions. Several other European countries, such as Belgium, Finland, Germany, Poland, and Switzerland, are also procuring and operating F-35s. The United Kingdom, along with Italy and Sweden, is developing a sixth-generation future combat aircraft, the Tempest, which is expected to enter service in the mid-2030s. Furthermore, the reevaluation of defense priorities after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and efforts to supply materiel to Ukraine have accelerated the modernization of equipment and ammunition stocks, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion has also motivated a European Commission review of the EU defense industrial base and a range of new initiatives to increase weapons and munitions stocks, modernize equipment, invest in research and development, and increase cooperation between EU member states. In October 2023, for example, the Council of the European Union approved the European Defence Industry Reinforcement through Common Procurement Act, a €300 million ($318 million) instrument that directly incentivizes collaborative defense procurement. Such efforts aim to reduce fragmentation in EU defense capabilities and planning and to strengthen the European defense industrial base, but their ability to impact large-scale European capabilities through 2030 will require sustained support and significantly increased resourcing. European countries will likely continue to develop substantial space-based capabilities that will facilitate their participation in large-scale combat. For example, France has committed to increasing its military space budget to improve its space and counterspace capabilities, including active defense for space objects. The United Kingdom is also attempting to augment its satellite communications capability, Skynet, and develop opportunies for utilizing or enhancing quantum field sensors; space-based ISR with multi-sensor capabilities; additional payloads for Skynet; and new options to exploit electromagnetic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;high-end-challenges&quot;&gt;HIGH-END CHALLENGES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section highlights several scenarios that help examine Europe’s ability to effectively perform high-end military missions: a war with Russia in the Baltics, a war with Iran in the Persian Gulf, and wars with China in the Taiwan Strait or South China Sea. These cases represent plausible future scenarios involving large-scale combat and have been important as part of U.S. Operation Plans (OPLANS). This section uses the results and analyses from wargames, scenarios, exercises, and other analyses to assess the ability of European states to perform military missions through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War with Russia:&lt;/strong&gt; The results of wargames, scenarios, and other analyses of a war with Russia in the Baltics indicate some challenges with a war in Eastern Europe, even with current Russian weaknesses. As outlined in Chapter 3, these challenges could increase if Russia is able to rebuild its military capabilities over the next decade with help from China and other countries, and if European countries are slow to build their capabilities or fail to learn from the war in Ukraine, including in their efforts to re-strategize, modernize forces, and increase complementarity in research, development, and procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wargames and other analyses show a major disparity in long-range fires between Europe and Russia even with projected European investments in such systems. European forces will likely continue to be susceptible to fire throughout the theater from Russian systems and lack sufficient ground-based air defense capabilities to counter Russian cruise and ballistic missiles. These problems could be compounded by Russian long-range integrated air defense systems (IADS), which can prevent European states from using airpower in a decisive way early in a conflict. Russian rockets and artillery may also outrange their European counterparts and threaten ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also significant challenges with the number, quality, and capabilities of most European ground forces. While Germany’s current defense plan aims to have three combat-capable divisions by the end of the decade, reaching this milestone is unlikely because the German army is shrinking. The United Kingdom has also cut the size of its army and plans to rely more heavily on reserve forces to make up the delta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other European capability gaps that could impact operations include: a longer-range, fast-flying radar-homing missile for suppressing modern surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems; mobile short-range air defense systems; Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASMs); and area munitions for the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS)/Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). These problems would be particularly serious without U.S. involvement, though allies’ investments in some of these systems could help them hold initial ground. These include acquisitions of ATACMS and Patriots by Poland and Hungary, the National/Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System (NASAMS) by Lithuania, and the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) by Poland. German and other European forces might also face significant challenges neutralizing the Bastion-P coastal defense cruise missile systems located in Kaliningrad and could face sigificant command and control problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iranian Missile Threat:&lt;/strong&gt; European states will likely face significant challenges dealing with a missile threat from Iran, based on a review of wargames, scenarios, and other analyses. Under the oversight of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Forces Al Ghadir Missile Command, Iran will likely focus on fielding more accurate and longer-range missiles over the next decade that include counter-measures for defeating U.S. and partner missile defense systems. Iran will likely continue to expand its missile ranges through 2030. A ballistic missile based on Iran’s Zoljanah space launch vehicle could carry a one-ton warhead as far as 5,000 kilometers, allowing Iran to strike every European capital. These developments will supplement other Iranian missiles, such as the Shahab-3 and Khorramshahr medium-range ballistic missiles, which have have an operational range of up to 2,000 kilometers. Iran also has layered area denial and anti-surface warfare capabilities, including naval mining (e.g., moored contact, drifting contact, and limpet mines), small boat swarming tactics, and coastal defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European missile defense capabilities are lagging. Figure 4.3 outlines EU and NATO multinational air and missile defense projects, many of which will not be fully operational until 2030 or later. For example, NATO’s Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) program — which is designed to protect European populations from a ballistic missile attack from a country such as Iran — likely will not achieve full operational capabilities until at least 2030. France possesses one SAMP/T ground-based air defense missile squadron that will be updated by 2025. Spain is expected to have two long-range radars by 2024. Most of the European countries developing sea-based, lower-layer ballistic missile defense are forecasting delays — including to the development of a suitable interceptor missile — through the end of the decade. The U.S. contribution to NATO’s BMD architecture will remain critical, including the Aegis Ashore and periodic rotation of the Terminal High Altitude Aerial Defense (THAAD) missile defense system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8QUQ5oT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most scenarios involving an Iranian missile threat in the Persian Gulf suggest that European countries will be able to play at best a limited role. Forces from several allied nations — particularly air, naval, and long-range fires forces from Israel, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates — might participate alongside the United States. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman could each potentially commit one or more combat squadrons (and Saudi Arabia one or more wings) to a conflict. Some Middle Eastern countries possess the HIMARS with ATACMS and could conduct fires across the Persian Gulf against Iranian targets. European allies, such as the United Kingdom and France, could commit some naval and air forces and possibly forward station assets at their bases in the region. But their missile defense capabilities are limited. Barring extended warning of potential Iranian aggression, and without substantial airlift assets, it is unlikely that European forces would be available during the critical early days of a Persian Gulf conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War with China in the Taiwan Strait or South China Sea:&lt;/strong&gt; European states will likely lack the capability by 2030 to successfully conduct large-scale combat operations against China, including in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait. The challenges in Asia are significant — even for the United States, which has likely lost “overmatch” with China. The Chinese Communist Party’s 14th Five Year Plan, which goes through 2025, calls for accelerated development of military mechanization, informatization, and intelligentization. China is focusing on military applications for such areas as artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, biotechnology, information technology, quantum computing, robotics, advanced materials and manufacturing, and deep-sea technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of China’s activity has focused on the development or acquisition of power-projection capabilities — from fifth-generation aircraft to China’s third aircraft carrier — designed to give China greater ability to influence actions in the Indo-Pacific. The PLA increasingly has the ability to put aircraft carrier strike groups at risk and neutralize ground-based air-power. By 2030, the PLA will likely have the capability to deny operations within the First Island Chain and to complicate operations within the Second Island Chain. By 2030, the PLA may increasingly advance and integrate joint capabilities across multiple domains, which will improve China’s strike capabilities, extend the range and efficacy of force projection, and protect China’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is developing the J-20A and J-20B fifth-generation stealth fighters, armed stealth unmanned aircraft systems, the DF-17 medium-range ballistic missile that carries an advanced hypersonic glide vehicle, and the J-31 medium-weight stealth fighter. China is also developing kinetic kill vehicle technology to field an upper-tier ballistic missile interceptor by 2030; longer-range, more accurate, and increasingly lethal ballistic and cruise missiles, including conventionally armed intercontinental-range missile systems; air defenses; and other platforms and systems. China also continues to expand its development and modernization efforts of unmanned aircraft systems, including next-generation capabilities such as air-to-air and air-to-ground combat and swarming capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is fielding new carrier-based aircraft, as well as ASW, helicopters, unmanned aircraft, land-based maritime strike, and air defense forces. China may have as many as five aircraft carriers by 2030, aided by helicopter carriers and a fleet of destroyers. The overall PLAN battle force will likely comprise 435 ships by 2030. China has developed a credible and increasingly robust over-the-horizon ISR capability. The development of China’s space, counterspace, and electronics sectors has enabled it to increase the pace of satellite launches and deploy a wider range of sophisticated ISR satellites. China’s development of anti-ship ballistic missiles presents a heightened maritime threat. At the same time, the ongoing modernization of Chinese air and submarine capabilities represents a more challenging threat to carrier strike groups. Some modeling suggests that the effectiveness of the Chinese submarine fleet (as measured by the number of attack opportunities it might achieve against carriers) has risen significantly over the past 25 years. Chinese submarines would present a credible threat to surface ships in a conflict over Taiwan or the South China Sea. The PLAN’s total submarine force is expected to number 65 by 2025 and 80 by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these developments, European militaries will not likely have the power-projection architecture and capabilities to play a major role in large-scale combat against China. They lack significantly deployable capabilities in such areas as ASW; ISR; ballistic missile defense; air precision strike; expeditionary logistics; and suppression of enemy air defense — and would likely prioritize the capabilties they do have for a Europe-based fight. Although NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept identified China’s political ambitions and coercive activities as a challenge for the first time, the document emphasized the Chinese threat to Euro-Atlantic security — indicating that the development of capabilities in the Indo-Pacific is not currently an alliance priority. With the exception of France, which has military assets and some 7,000 to 8,000 troops permanently stationed in the region, European countries lack the significant posture and prepositioned forces in the Indo-Pacific region needed to move quickly in the early stages of any conflict. The huge distances in the Indo-Pacific will also stress European allies’ air-to-air refueling and transport capabilities. Nevertheless, European states can provide some capabilities — such as cyber and space — to support the United States or other countries in the region, including Australia, South Korea, Japan, and New Zealand, and contribute to lower-end deterrence and assurance missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this chapter was to focus on military missions and to move beyond assessing whether European countries will be able to increase their defense spending to 2 percent of GDP or fix capability gaps. In examining which types of missions European militaries will be able to effectively perform in Europe, the Middle East, parts of Africa, and the Indo-Pacific, this analysis highlights several findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, European reliance on the United States can be divided into several tiers, as illustrated below. These tiers represent a judgment about whether European states could operate independently of the U.S. military, not whether they should. They include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tier 1 Missions: Low Reliance on the United States:&lt;/strong&gt; Most European states likely will not require aid from the United States for such missions as noncombatant evacuation, peackeeping, foreign humanitarian assistance, counternarcotics, counterterrorism, security force assistance, counter illegal migration, air patrol, and maritime patrol missions — particularly in and around Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tier 2 Missions: Medium Reliance on the United States:&lt;/strong&gt; Most European states likely will require some aid from the United States for military engagement, security cooperation, deterrence, and assurance missions in parts of the Middle East and Africa. In these regions, most European militaries could face some challenges with airlift, aerial refueling, basing, and other issues over extensive geographic areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tier 3 Missions: High Reliance on the United States:&lt;/strong&gt; Most European states likely will require significant aid from the United States for large-scale combat, particularly with Russia and China. In addition, European militaries likely will also require U.S. aid to effectively perform numerous missions (such as deterrence and assurance) in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, some European states — particularly larger powers such as the United Kingdom and France — will likely have the capability to conduct most types of missions at the lower end of the conflict continuum without U.S. military aid. Examples include noncombatant evacuations, peacekeeping, and foreign humanitarian assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major European states will also likely be able to conduct most types of medium-scale missions, such as security force assistance, counternarcotics, counterterrorism, and air and maritime patrol. European militaries may face resource issues, including shortfalls in the number of aircraft, naval vessels, personnel, or spare parts, which could stress their ability to fill several missions concurrently or for an extended duration. Nevertheless, they likely will not have significant capability gaps in accomplishing most of these missions, particularly in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, European militaries — including the United Kingdom and France — will likely struggle to conduct large-scale combat, where European states still lack sufficient heavy maneuver forces, airlift, naval combatants, and support capabilities, such as logistics and fire support. Although European allies and partners of the United States plan to improve these capabilities by 2030 as part of a greater NATO-agreed initiative, it is unclear whether they will be successful. European challenges may be particularly notable with large-scale, high-end conflict at short notice given most European countries’ persistent readiness challenges. Another challenge will likely be missions in the Indo-Pacific, where European maritime and air forces lack sufficient airlift, aerial refueling, and basing to sustain operations. Countries such as France and the United Kingdom could mitigate basing challenges by reaching agreements with some countries in the region. As highlighted later in Chapter 6, these are areas on which the United States can focus as part of security cooperation and industrial base cooperation with European allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier in this chapter, Germany and the United Kingdom may struggle to field some units because of manpower shortages. The shrinking forces of both countries reflect an overall trend affecting not only Europe but also the United States and Canada in trying to recruit and retain an all-volunteer, professional armed force. This is a challenge that needs to be addressed by all Western nations. Without adequate active-duty volunteers, many national leaders will need to consider whether a greater reliance on reservists will be needed to meet force goals and operational requirements. Additionally, consideration may need to be given to reinstitute conscription in some form to have a minimally trained reserve force capable of being called up and deployed if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also a range of factors that could impact the outcome of European missions, such as political will, financial constraints, and variation in threat perception. While all members have pledged to honor NATO’s Article V commitment, many allies in Western and Southern Europe have a significantly different perception of the Russian threat than those nations of Northern and Eastern Europe. Conversely, nations in Northern and Eastern Europe have a different threat perception of illegal migration and terrorist flows than those in Southern and Western Europe. Although the overall strategic focus in Europe has shifted toward the northeast following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, effective development of allied capabilities and strategy will require a balanced threat assessment. Ensuring that all allies share a common risk assessment and understanding that the alliance, as a whole, needs a wide spectrum of deep capabilities to address these threats is what NATO 2030 was designed to achieve and what allied leaders reaffirmed at the Madrid summit in June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruitment, training, operations and maintenance, and purchasing of spare parts will also be key factors in assessing whether NATO allies — including the United States — can meet the 2030 goals and be able to maintain them post-2030. If NATO leaders can find the political will to ensure its 2021 Brussels and 2022 Madrid declarations are not hollow, then many of the missions outlined above can be achieved and many of the present identified gaps can be filled. However, if there is not ample political support — as well as adequate funding — to do what is needed to meet 2030 objectives, many of the challenges noted in this chapter may become even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;forward-defense&quot;&gt;FORWARD DEFENSE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ch-05&quot;&gt;CH. 05&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-interests-and-defense-objectives&quot;&gt;U.S. INTERESTS AND DEFENSE OBJECTIVES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines U.S. interests and objectives in Europe in the context of U.S. military posture. It asks several questions. What are U.S. interests in Europe? In light of these interests, what should be the United States’ major defense objectives and capabilities in Europe? Based on the analysis, this chapter makes three main arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the United States has several enduring interests in Europe: protect the U.S. homeland and the security of the American people; promote and expand economic prosperity and opportunity; realize and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life; and defend and support the United States’ European allies and partners. Second, the United States has several defense objectives that flow from these interests, such as deterring and defeating conventional and nuclear-armed conflict directed against the U.S. homeland and NATO allies. Third, deterrence should be the conceptual lynchpin of U.S. posture in Europe, including a combination of deterrence by punishment (for areas of NATO’s eastern flank) and deterrence by denial (for much of the rest of Europe). Nevertheless, deterrence is likely to be more difficult below the threshold of conventional war for Russian gray zone activities and irregular warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter is divided into five sections. The first outlines U.S. interests in Europe. The second section examines U.S. defense objectives, which flow from U.S. interests. The third explores deterrence. The fourth section examines several operational concepts. The fifth section analyzes risks to U.S. posture in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-interests&quot;&gt;U.S. INTERESTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has several broad security interests in Europe today, which will likely persist over the next decade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protect the U.S. homeland and the security of the American people, including from threats emanating from Europe;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promote and expand U.S. economic prosperity and opportunity;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Realize and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defend and support the United States’ European allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has interests elsewhere in the world. In particular, China will likely be the United States’ main global competitor. China poses a challenge to the United States around the globe because of its expanding conventional and nuclear capabilities, irregular warfare and gray zone activities, technological and economic competitiveness, and “wolf warrior” diplomacy. The United States has other important interests in other regions, including in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is a false dichotomy to argue that the United States needs to choose between these interests — especially between China and Russia. Both are authoritarian regimes cooperating on two major axes. Beijing and Moscow have deepened their military, economic, and diplomatic ties since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The United States should develop a two-front strategy that works with allies and partners to counter China and Russia. U.S. interests in Europe are significant, and U.S. allies and partners in Europe share the United States’ democratic values and account for significant military, economic, and technological power. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracy:&lt;/strong&gt; Europe accounts for the largest number of democratic countries of any continent in the world. Europe’s commitment to freedom and democracy is particularly critical because of 16 straight years of democratic decline worldwide due to the global expansion of authoritarian regimes, including China, Russia, and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military Power:&lt;/strong&gt; European countries have 4 of the 10 largest defense budgets in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Europe includes 3 of the 10 largest economies in the world, as measured by purchasing power parity. Combined, the European Union has the third-largest economy in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population:&lt;/strong&gt; The population of the entire European Union is 447.7 million, which would make it the third-largest country in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public support for NATO in the United States has been over 70 percent for the past two decades. In 2022, at least three-quarters of Republicans, Democrats, and independents believed that the United States should maintain or increase its support to NATO, according to a Chicago Council on Global Affairs poll. In 2023, U.S. support for NATO remained high, though some Republicans and independents were more likely to focus on domestic issues. Still, a significant 91 percent of Americans — including Republicans and Democrats — had unfavorable views of Russia in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its establishment in the 1949 Washington Treaty, NATO has been the lynchpin of U.S. security in Europe. The bedrock of NATO is a collective defense provision — an attack on one is an attack on all — that was codified in Article V of the Washington Treaty. During the Cold War, the alliance served as the primary bulwark against the expansion of the Soviet Union. Following the Soviet Union’s collapse, NATO became the major framework for organizing transatlantic efforts on collective security matters, including military interventions in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Libya. In addition, several former Soviet republics (such as Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) and members of the Soviet-aligned Warsaw Pact (such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia) became NATO members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These treaty relationships have benefited the United States for several reasons. One is supporting U.S. leadership. As a result of the United States’ central role in transatlantic and international relations that NATO has in many ways cemented, Americans have enjoyed unprecedented economic prosperity and freedom. Successive American governments have been afforded both de facto and de jure privileged status related to such issues as trade partnerships and access to bases in large part because of the outsized role that the country plays in the defense of its allies. For example, the United States would not have been able to prosecute expeditionary and counterterrorism operations in the Middle East and Africa were it not for the bases and prepositioned equipment that the United States has been able to maintain on allied soil in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another long-standing reason for U.S. engagement in Europe is to enable U.S. strategic depth. The United States’ geographic location, protected by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, no longer provides the same security as in previous decades because of advances in long-range strike, cyber operations, space, and other technological developments. As a result, it is prudent to station U.S. forces overseas to contend with adversary aggression — if not outright conflict — far from the U.S. homeland. Not only does this make the U.S. homeland less vulnerable to outright war, but forward presence is also relatively cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the NATO alliance today affords the United States strategic flexibility. Most of the United States’ main security challenges — from China and Russia to Iran and terrorism — cannot be tackled by one state alone, not even the United States. Allies are critical. They enable flexible cooperation and consultation on any number of strategic issues as they arise. In short, the United States has significant interests in Europe that will likely persist over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-objectives&quot;&gt;DEFENSE OBJECTIVES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these interests, the United States has several defense objectives in Europe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deter and defeat conventional and nuclear-armed conflict directed against the U.S. homeland and U.S. allies, as well as coerce, persuade, and influence adversary behavior;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counter irregular and gray zone activities, as well as compete effectively below the threshold of conventional conflict using both defensive and offensive means;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counter terrorist and other transnational threats;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deter and prevent state and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintain access to trade routes and global commons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key defense objective should be to deter and defeat conventional and nuclear-armed conflict directed against the U.S. homeland and NATO allies, as well as to coerce, persuade, and influence adversary behavior. This objective includes preventing a country with hegemonic ambitions, such as Russia, from expanding its power through territorial conquest, covert influence, and other means. As Putin explained at length in discussing the historical exploits of Peter I, military expansion was about returning what rightly belonged to Russia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Peter the Great waged the Great Northern War for 21 years. On the face of it, he was at war with Sweden taking something away from it. . . . He was not taking away anything, he was returning. This is how it was. The areas around Lake Ladoga, where St Petersburg was founded. When he founded the new capital, none of the European countries recognized this territory as part of Russia; everyone recognized it as part of Sweden. However, from time immemorial, the Slavs lived there along with the Finno-Ugric peoples, and this territory was under Russia’s control. The same is true of the western direction, Narva and his first campaigns. Why would he go there? He was returning and reinforcing, that is what he was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic is revanchist. Putin went on to highlight the need for expansion today. “Clearly, it fell to our lot to reclaim and strengthen as well. And if we operate on the premise that these basic values constitute the basis of our existence, we will certainly succeed in achieving our goals.” Putin’s desire to expand territorial control is cloaked in the language that the Kremlin is merely acquiring what already belongs to Russia. Putin likely has other countries on his colonial agenda, such as Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, which were Soviet republics. Putin’s revanchist aims makes it important to deter and defeat armed aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has other defense objectives, such as countering gray zone activities, terrorism, and other transnational threats. For instance, Europe has critical infrastructure that could be threatened by state and non-state activity and pose a threat to the United States. As illustrated in Figure 5.1, one example is the underwater fiber-optic cables that connect Europe with North America and European countries with each other. There are currently 16 cables running under the Atlantic that connect the United States with mainland Europe. They are primarily operated by such companies as Google, Microsoft, France’s Alcatel Submarine Networks, and China’s Huawei Marine Networks. Submarine cables are critical for global communication and account for roughly 95 percent of all transatlantic data traffic. Militaries also use them. These cables are vulnerable to subversion and sabotage by special operations forces and intelligence units; maritime vessels, such as submarines and unmanned underwater vehicles; and possibly non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, the Russian navy allegedly mapped out the undersea cables off the coast of Ireland and carried out maneuvers, raising serious concerns in Europe and the United States about Russian sabotage. In addition, a Russian government unit allegedly cut an underwater fiber-optic cable off the coast of Svalbard, Norway, in January 2022 in the Arctic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s intricate network of gas and oil pipelines are also vulnerable to sabotage and subversion. In September 2022, for example, there were explosions in the Baltic Sea on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines. Europe is vulnerable to other threats below the threshold of conventional war — such as cyberattacks, misinformation and disinformation, assassinations, terrorist attacks, illegal drugs, human trafficking, and the weaponization of immigrants — from state and non-state actors that may require U.S. defense assistance. In 2021, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko threatened to “flood” the European Union with “drugs and migrants,” and then his government sent thousands of migrants from Iraq and other countries to the borders of Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland in 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the United States will likely need to help deter and prevent state and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction. On several occasions, Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons in response to U.S. and other Western aid to Ukraine following the Russian invasion. Russian military leaders also discussed the use of battlefield nuclear weapons in Ukraine, according to U.S. intelligence. The United States could also help track and counter the acquisition — or attempted acquisition — of fissile material and chemical or biological agents or precursors as well as the movement of these materials and their possible use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final defense objective is maintaining access to major trade routes and global commons. Europe has some of the most significant trade routes, such as the Dover Strait (between the United Kingdom and France) and the Suez Canal (between the Mediterranean and Red Sea). On March 23, 2021, for example, the cargo ship Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal and created a massive backlog of over 400 vessels, significantly disrupting global supply chains, delaying goods from reaching their destinations, and holding up an estimated $9.6 billion of trade each day. U.S. and European maritime vessels — including from the U.S. Sixth Fleet — and aircraft can help to ensure these shipping lanes remain open. As the Arctic ice melts, the Arctic Ocean also represents a major global common with potential shipping lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deterrence&quot;&gt;DETERRENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence should be the lynchpin of U.S. posture in Europe. Deterrence involves preventing an adversary from taking an action that it might otherwise take. There are two types of deterrence relevant to Europe. Deterrence by denial involves preventing an action, such as Russian aggression, by making it infeasible or unlikely to succeed, thus denying a potential aggressor confidence in attaining its objectives. Deterrence by punishment includes preventing an action, such as Russian aggression, by imposing severe costs if an attack occurs. Some have referred to this as deterrence by cost imposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A potential attacker’s fears about the costs of military action, especially when weighed against the benefits, are central to both concepts of deterrence. Costs are often a function of military and civilian casualties, military equipment destroyed or lost, the losses associated with economic sanctions imposed by opponents, trade disrupted, and the expense of mobilizing, deploying, and maintaining forces. In the case of successful deterrence, the attacker might not conduct an action because it believes the probability of success is low and the costs and risks are high. For example, the attacker might assess that it cannot successfully achieve its objectives quickly and with limited costs using a blitzkrieg strategy and would instead face a protracted and bloody war of attrition. As former U.S. secretary of state Dean Acheson noted: “The only deterrence to the imposition of Russian will in Western Europe is the belief that from the outset of any such attempt American power would be employed in stopping it, and if necessary, would inflict on the Soviet Union injury which the Moscow regime would not wish to suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence by denial may be achievable for much, though not all, of Europe. A denial strategy requires deploying sufficient numbers and types of conventional forces (such as armored brigade combat teams, fifth-generation aircraft, bombers, artillery, and main battle tanks) and nuclear weapons to prevent the advance of an adversary — such as Russia — on the battlefield. Other factors, such as strategy, are also important. Consequently, for deterrence by denial to be effective in Europe, the United States and its NATO allies need to develop a strategy designed to blunt a Russian blitzkrieg, deploy sufficient numbers of armored brigade combat teams and weapons systems to frontline states in Eastern Europe, and ensure that the defense industrial base of the United States and its allies can produce sufficient munitions and weapons systems for a protracted war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries, such as the Baltic states and perhaps Finland, deterrence by denial may be difficult. NATO likely lacks a forward posture — including ground forces and capabilities — in some frontline states to prevent a Russian fait accompli. In these cases, the United States and its NATO allies will likely need to credibly signal to Moscow that the costs of a Russian attack would far outweigh the benefits. Examples might include strengthening the ability of U.S. and NATO forces to quickly surge into targeted countries to repel an advance, using — or threatening to use — nuclear weapons, or developing sufficient host-nation capabilities to mount a costly insurgency. In the case of nuclear weapons, deterrence by punishment can sometimes involve an implicit or explicit threat to destroy large portions of an opponent’s industry and other targets. In the case of a potential insurgency, countries such as Switzerland have deterred invasions in part by developing and training local defense units (supported by regular forces) in irregular warfare, prepositioning stockpiles of weapons and equipment to wage a protracted insurgency, and preparing military and civilian units for decentralized and aggressive resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, deterrence is more difficult below the threshold of conventional war, including for irregular warfare and gray zone activities. Offensive cyberattacks, sabotage, anti-satellite attacks, assassinations, and other types of activities are difficult to deter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to deterrence, assurance will remain important in Europe. Assurance, which includes land, maritime, and air activities designed to give confidence to allies and partners, can be helpful. Examples might include the stationing of permanent or rotational ground forces and equipment, air and maritime patrols, and military exercises. But assurance is not the same as deterrence, and steps to assure allies and partners do not necessarily deter adversaries. For example, air and maritime patrols may provide some confidence and comfort to host-nation countries near where these patrols occur, but there is little evidence that they deter adversary behavior. Consequently, while assurance steps are important, deterrence should be the conceptual lynchpin of U.S. posture in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-concepts&quot;&gt;OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several operational concepts relevant to examining force posture in Europe. One is agile combat employment (ACE), which is designed to increase survivability and generate combat power in the face of an imminent threat or action. The intent is to complicate the adversary’s targeting process, create political and operational dilemmas for the enemy, and create flexibility for U.S. or allied and partner forces. Aircraft are particularly vulnerable if they are postured on bases that are few in number, lack passive defenses (such as shelters and decoys), and lack sufficient active defenses (such as kinetic and non-kinetic interceptors, electronic warfare, and directed-energy weapons) that can help counter air and missile threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACE in Europe involves responding to a rising threat — such as an increase in U.S.-Russian tensions, a Russian military buildup along NATO’s eastern flank, or even a preemptive Russian strike against NATO. ACE might include rapidly moving U.S. and allied aircraft and key personnel, materiel, and logistics from large bases (or main operating bases) to dispersed contingency locations (or forward operating sites) in Europe and perhaps other regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example might involve quickly dispersing aircraft, materiel, and personnel from such main operating bases as Ramstein Air Base in Germany to forward operating sites in Greece, Slovenia, Poland, Romania, or other countries. Rapid dispersal relies on airlift and logistical flows between main operating bases and forward operating sites, ideally covered by air and missile defense. ACE also involves massing and utilizing forces from forward operating sites to potentially strike enemy targets. To be effective, ACE generally requires prepositioning war reserve materiel and building infrastructure at forward operating sites, as well as conducting training and exercises, negotiating access through host-nation agreements, and engaging in other activities with European partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, dynamic force employment (DFE) is an operational concept designed to demonstrate operational unpredictability to adversaries, improve deterrence, and support allies. DFE missions might include posturing a guided-missile destroyer to the High North, conducting Bomber Task Force missions, or deploying an F-35 squadron. The idea is to employ forces in ways that demonstrate the United States’ ability to quickly generate combat power and deter adversary action. As the 2018 National Defense Strategy concluded, DFE provides “options for proactive and scalable employment of the Joint Force” and facilitates “combat-credible, flexible theater postures [that] will enhance our ability to compete and provide freedom of maneuver during conflict, providing national decision-makers with better military options.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Defender-Europe exercise involved the rapid deployment of air and land capabilities (including Abrams main battle tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and M113 armored personnel carriers) from the United States and Germany to Drawsko Pomorskie Training Area in Poland. U.S. Army units then conducted company-level, live-fire exercises with Poland’s 17th Mechanized Brigade and 11th Armor Cavalry Division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are at least three challenges with DFE and deterrence. First, there is little empirical evidence that DFE actually deters adversaries. For example, it is unclear if — and perhaps unlikely that — Russia has been deterred by the occasional deployment of an F-35 squadron, guided-missile destroyer, or Bomber Task Force mission in Europe. To effectively deter, actions need to make an adversary’s activity infeasible or impose severe costs if the activity occurs. DFE likely does neither. Second, DFE may weaken assurance of U.S. allies and partners in cases where permanent or rotational forces are replaced by those engaged in DFE. Third, there is often little or nothing “dynamic” about DFE, since it can sometimes take several months to negotiate with local partners and allow for adversary intelligence collection and warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-risks&quot;&gt;POTENTIAL RISKS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this chapter argues, the United States has enduring interests in Europe. In particular, Russia presents a long-term threat to the United States and its European allies and partners because of its revanchist intentions and efforts to rebuild its military capabilities. Based on these interests, the United States has several defense objectives in Europe, such as deterring and defeating conventional and nuclear-armed conflict, countering irregular and gray zone activities, countering terrorist and other trans-national threats, deterring and preventing state and non-state actors from acquiring or using weapons of mass destruction, and maintaining access to key trade routes and global commons. To achieve these objectives, the United States needs sufficient land, maritime, air, space, cyber, nuclear, and special operations capabilities in or near Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, deterrence should be the lynchpin of U.S. posture in Europe, and it should include a combination of deterrence by punishment (for areas of NATO’s eastern flank) and deterrence by denial (for most of Europe). But deterrence is likely to be weaker below the threshold of conventional war — including for irregular warfare and gray zone activities, such as cyber operations, disinformation campaigns, sabotage, and subversion. This reality suggests that the United States and its European allies should be aggressive in conducting both defensive and offensive action below the threshold of conventional war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, any U.S. force posture has risks that need to be managed. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Military Capabilities:&lt;/em&gt; European capabilities remain limited, including for high-end warfare. Particular concerns are such areas as integrated air and missile defense, long-range fires, hypersonics, and sufficient stockpiles of critical munitions, such as for integrated air defense systems and the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interoperability:&lt;/em&gt; Military interoperability remains a challenge across NATO militaries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Political Will:&lt;/em&gt; Political will may be fragile in some European countries, including to support U.S. basing, access, and overflight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Defense Industrial Base:&lt;/em&gt; The defense industrial bases of most European countries are not adequately prepared for the current security environment. Most have not produced sufficient quantities of the most important munitions and weapons systems — such as long-range fires and integrated air and missile defense systems — for a major war. Most also do not have sufficient surge capacity for a protracted war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escalation:&lt;/em&gt; Some posture actions, such as deploying armored brigade combat teams to Finland, could unnecessarily provoke Moscow and risk escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. Contingencies:&lt;/em&gt; Some U.S. forces could be deployed to other regions — such as the Indo-Pacific or Middle East — for contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domestic U.S. Constraints:&lt;/em&gt; There are several domestic factors that could impact U.S. force posture in Europe, including the size of the U.S. defense budget or an isolationist turn in U.S. politics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these risks, U.S. posture in Europe needs to be flexible enough to allow some U.S. forces to surge to other regions — such as the Indo-Pacific or Middle East — in case of contingencies. The next chapter provides more details about U.S. posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ch-06&quot;&gt;CH. 06&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-forward-defense-posture&quot;&gt;A FORWARD DEFENSE POSTURE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter outlines recommendations for the future of U.S. military posture in Europe based on the interests, objectives, capabilities, and operational concepts identified in the previous chapter, as well as concerns about Russian military reconstitution and political revanchism. The chapter begins with a discussion of the methodology and assumptions underpinning them, including considerations of the time frame for implementing new U.S. policies, the state of the war in Ukraine and the reconstitution of Russia’s military capabilities, the state of competition with China and the likelihood of a Taiwan conflict, and U.S. global posture writ large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter also provides recommendations in line with a posture of “forward defense.” It is organized around the categories of ground forces; air combat forces; naval forces; air and missile defense; logistics and enablers; and intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR). The recommendations seek to bolster U.S. ground forces, particularly in NATO’s eastern flank, as a deterrent against Russian military reconstitution and revanchism. In the air and maritime domains, they aim to adopt a flexible posture and work with allies to fill capability gaps in the event of a contingency in the Indo-Pacific or other regions. Finally, they strive to enhance coordination with NATO allies by building partner capacity missions, security assistance, and arms sales to fill capability gaps, improve interoperability, and enhance allied lethality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-assumptions&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The posture recommendations were developed based on the analysis in preceding chapters as well as an evaluation of the U.S. military’s posture both currently and prior to the war in Ukraine. Those postures served as a baseline from which the study team recommended changes according to the objectives and interests identified in Chapter 5, the state of European military capabilities as assessed in Chapter 6, and the analysis of the threat landscape in Chapter 4. The recommendations were then evaluated against alternative postures discussed in Chapter 7 and assessed against several operational scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, several assumptions inform the recommendations. Regarding the timeline to enact policy and posture changes, these recommendations are designed for U.S. military force posture in Europe through 2030. In the case of some recommendations that may have a more immediate impact (such as increased port visits) or delayed impact (such as new bases), the approximate timeline will be specified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering recommendations on the future of U.S. posture in Europe is also complicated by the current state of the war in Ukraine. This study assumes that the war will likely continue for the foreseeable future, though the intensity of the fighting could wax and wane based on several factors, including political negotiations. The study assumes that the Russian military will attempt to reconstitute its military forces and capabilities, to include the modernization of the army. China will likely provide economic and some military assistance to Russia to aid in its modernization efforts. The study team also assumes that Iran, North Korea, and other countries will provide military assistance to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations offered in this study are not made in a vacuum absent considerations of U.S. posture elsewhere in the world. This report seeks to offer realistic policy options informed by global trade-offs in terms of U.S. forces and capabilities. As outlined above, while the United States has significant interests and objectives, China is the United States’ main geostrategic competitor. Accordingly, this report identifies areas of risk where preferred capabilities may not be available for use in the European theater due to their deployment in the Indo-Pacific theater and offers options to mitigate that risk. The recommendations assume that U.S. tensions with China will continue, including over Taiwan. Finally, this study does not conduct a detailed budget analysis of forward defense, but it does highlight the budgetary implications of certain policies or force posture changes as well as political considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter examines posture and capability recommendations in the following categories: ground forces, air combat forces, naval forces, air and missile defense, logistics and enablers, ISR, and nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ground-forces&quot;&gt;GROUND FORCES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of operations in Ukraine illustrates the continued significance of ground forces in combat in the European theater. Consequently, U.S. ground forces in Europe will play a major role in deterring and responding to acts of Russian aggression and should be strengthened in a “forward defense” posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war in Ukraine highlights, land warfare remains important, including in Europe. There are several types of capabilities important for achieving U.S. defense objectives highlighted in the previous chapter, including deterring and defeating conventional and nuclear-armed conflict directed against the U.S. homeland and NATO allies. Key examples include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Army units, including armored brigade combat teams (ABCTs);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main battle tanks, armored personnel carriers, and infantry fighting vehicles;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrated air and missile defense systems;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long-range fires;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manned and unmanned aircraft;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-domain command and control; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional investments and equipment — including logistics — such as munitions stockpiles, spare parts, hardened facilities, and improved lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and other land-based capabilities fall under U.S. Army Europe. In addition, achieving U.S. defense objectives in Europe requires active defenses, passive defenses, and counterstrike. Active defense refers to assets that directly target and eliminate incoming threats, including integrated air and missile defense capabilities, such as Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and Patriot surface-to-air missile systems (including radars, fire control, battle management, and command and control). Passive defense refers to hardened infrastructure and dispersal of assets through concepts of operation such as agile combat employment (ACE). These passive defense actions minimize damage to installations from kinetic threats by absorbing strikes and forcing U.S. adversaries to expend more munitions on hardened targets. Finally, counterstrike includes the ability to conduct retaliatory actions against enemy forces and to prevent or mitigate damage from additional follow-on attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should prepare for Russia to revitalize its military capabilities and pose a threat to NATO’s eastern flank. It should consequently take steps to strengthen its presence from pre-February 2022 levels by increasing the number of permanent forward-stationed maneuver forces to deter and effectively respond to Russian aggression. That increase entails shifting the rotational ABCT associated with Operation Atlantic Resolve (along with the associated combat aviation brigade) to a permanent, forward-stationed ABCT headquartered in Poland. The United States should also maintain its enduring rotational infantry brigade combat team (IBCT) presence in Romania, as well as rotational deployments to the Baltic states in the near term and incorporate them into Operation Atlantic Resolve under the command of the V Corps headquarters. However, the requirement for these rotational forces may shift depending on changes to the threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes to U.S. ground force posture would shift the U.S. Army to a posture model of four total brigade combat teams (BCTs) in Europe (three permanent, forward-stationed BCTs and one rotational BCT) plus two headquarters in Germany and Poland (four BCTs + two headquarters model) from the previous 3+1 model prior to the war in Ukraine. This model would also include the permanent forward basing of two combat aviation brigades (the existing 12th Combat Aviation Brigade plus another). Prior to the February 2022 invasion, the United States maintained two permanent, forward-stationed BCTs in Europe plus one rotational BCT. The permanent units include the 2nd Cavalry Regiment Stryker brigade combat team (SBCT) headquartered in Vilseck, Germany, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade across Vincenza, Italy, and Grafenwoehr, Germany, as well as the forward-stationed 12th Combat Aviation Brigade. The rotational ABCT, established in the wake of Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine, serves as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, which deploys approximately 7,000 U.S. Army personnel (including the ABCT plus a combat aviation brigade, sustainment task force, and forward division headquarters) to Europe on nine-month rotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, U.S. ground forces in the U.S European Command (EUCOM) area of responsibility increased significantly, shifting to a 5+2 model with the deployment of two additional BCTs (one ABCT and one IBCT), the V Corps division headquarters in Poland, a High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) battalion, and enablers. The second IBCT serves as a rotational unit headquartered in Romania to provide an additional brigade on the eastern flank. Additionally, it was announced that the United States would “enhance its rotational deployments” to the Baltics states — including armored, aviation, air defense, and special operations forces — and “maintain a persistent heel-to-toe presence in the region.” From an operational perspective, EUCOM also deployed its permanently forward-stationed forces to NATO’s eastern flank in response to Russia’s invasion, including the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade, Patriot forces, and the 12th Combat Aviation Brigade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommended changes in this report for a 4+2 model would thus maintain the permanent SBCT in Germany and IBCT in Italy and Germany, create a permanent, forward-stationed ABCT at a new base in Poland, maintain the rotational IBCT in Romania, and maintain two permanent headquarters in Germany and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-stationing an ABCT in Poland offers several benefits to maintaining U.S. interests and achieving objectives in Europe, including (1) providing a credible force to swiftly respond to acts of Russian aggression against NATO partners; (2) reassuring allies of the U.S. commitment while building interoperability with partner forces; and (3) enhancing the general readiness of U.S. forces at large and reducing costs in the long run. Poland would provide the most practical and beneficial location to establish a new military base for an ABCT from an operational and political perspective. As announced at the 2022 NATO summit, Poland already hosts the V Corps Forward Command Post Headquarters, an Army garrison, and sustainment capabilities — the “first permanent stationing of U.S. forces on NATO’s eastern flank.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More critically, forward-stationing U.S. units in Poland would facilitate the speed of assembly and movement for U.S. operations in Europe, in which ABCTs would play a major role. According to a U.S. Army War College study, “The heart of the combat capability of a division configured for Europe is its ABCTs,” which “provide the bulk of ground force combat power and are the fulcrum around which the remainder of the ground campaign acts.” A forward-stationed ABCT in Poland would limit the amount of time required to build a combat-credible force to counter acts of Russian aggression against NATO. This capability would play a particularly major role in deterring or responding to a contingency in the Baltic states. Russian forces could threaten to cut off or slow the access of U.S. and NATO forces to the Baltic states by closing the Suwalki Gap, also known as the Kaliningrad Corridor — the 40-mile gap between Kaliningrad and Belarus where Lithuania borders Poland. Poland also offers greater strategic depth than alternative locations, such as the Baltic states, and interconnected rail lines with the rest of Europe that would ease resupply and reinforcement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-stationing a U.S. ABCT where it swiftly reinforces the Baltic states in the event of a contingency would also mitigate risks posed by shortcomings in NATO’s posture and capabilities. As discussed in Chapter 4, European militaries have insufficient numbers of maneuver forces. Moreover, Germany has struggled to expand its forces in Lithuania. However, U.S. and NATO force planners would also have to consider the Russian response to permanently forward-stationing a U.S. ABCT in Poland. The Russian government would likely consider this act to be a provocation and a further violation of the 1997 NATO Russia Founding Act. Consequently, the selection of a specific location for an ABCT base in the country would also have to balance operational efficiency with the risk posed by Russian escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the permanent U.S. presence would provide greater reassurance to Poland and to allies and partners on NATO’s eastern flank. According to a U.S. Army War College study, ABCTs have an “even greater political salience with Allied policymakers and populations due to their easily understood symbolic value,” and “rotational forces represent less commitment on the part of the United States and so have less reassurance value from the perspective of the ally or partner.” From a political perspective, the Polish government has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to host a permanent forward U.S. presence and share costs with the U.S. military. Poland already provides significant infrastructure and logistical support for the existing U.S. forces there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-stationing additional U.S. forces can also enhance interoperability with allied forces and society. Forward-stationed U.S. units develop valuable relationships interacting with host-country military and civilian personnel on a regular basis and become more culturally attuned by learning about the community and environment. There are also vital benefits to increased interoperability both in times of crisis (easier coordination and problem solving) and stability (fewer violations of laws thanks to familiarity with local statutes and practices). As one assessment concludes, “the benefits of tactical and operational interoperability that come with forward stationing are most useful to those units that require the greatest depth of knowledge of local rules, regulations, customs, terrain, airspace, and counterparts.” In the case of Europe, this suggests that ABCTs are best placed to permanently forward station rather than IBCTs or SBCTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interoperability is likely further enhanced when U.S. personnel are forward stationed with their dependents. Military families, about 60 percent of whom live on base, engage with host-country neighbors and businesses as de facto ambassadors. This strengthens strategic interoperability between the United States and host countries by improving cultural understanding and, in the case of Europe, reinforcing transatlantic ties and the role of NATO. When comparing the readiness between forward-stationed and rotational forces, these factors — increased interoperability and the presence of dependents — play a major role in the superior long-term readiness of permanent units compared to rotational forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permanent stationed forces typically have significantly higher unit-manning rates than rotational forces. Manning levels for rotational forces can be as low as 67 percent. Their superior training readiness is further offset by the interoperability and awareness of forward-stationed forces with the host-country military, society, and regulations as well as heightened morale. Some evidence suggests that rotational deployments, which separate military personnel from their families for nine months at a time, cause lower morale than permanent deployments, which keep personnel with their dependents. Rotational deployments also lead to more discipline issues and increased divorce rates. A comparison of re-enlistment rates between rotational BCTs and all Army BCTs found a lower re-enlistment rate for rotational personnel, which was even lower when compared to the forward-stationed 2nd Cavalry Regiment SBCT based in Vilseck, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a force-planning and budgetary perspective, the costs of permanently stationed forces are also lower. In terms of the force-generation model, an enduring and constant rotational ABCT presence in Europe for a nine-month deployment requires three total ABCTs. As an illustrative example, U.S.-based ABCT-1 must be training and preparing to deploy to replace ABCT-2 currently in Europe. ABCT-3, also U.S.-based, after recently ending its nine-month deployment, must then recover and begin training to deploy following ABCT-1’s tour overseas. This model, rather than having one unit permanently stationed in Europe, eats up more of the Army’s force structure and long-term readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a fiscal cost perspective, establishing a new U.S. military base in Poland would initially have high budgetary costs and take roughly seven years to put in place. However, the financial burden of permanently stationed forces would be lower in the long run. Operation and sustainment costs would be significantly lower than those of rotational force. A forward-stationed ABCT incurs 75 percent of the additional operational tempo (OPTEMPO) costs that a rotationally deployed ABCT would, and it also generates savings over time. Moreover, given the cost of moving their equipment, ABCTs are the most expensive unit to rotationally deploy, suggesting that IBCTs or SBCTs are better suited to that deployment model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Range Fires:&lt;/strong&gt; Long-range fires offer a valuable capability to deter Russian aggression on NATO’s eastern flank, as evidenced by the reactivation of the 56th Artillery Command in Germany and the activation of the Army’s 2nd Multi-Domain Task Force in 2021. Long-range fires units, including those with HIMARS capabilities, have also deployed on a rotational basis to conduct training and improve interoperability with NATO allies. In March 2023, the Army’s V Corps announced its European HIMARS initiative to formalize these efforts, particularly across the eastern flank, with participation from 56th Artillery Command, 41st Field Artillery Brigade, and elements of the 101st Airborne and 4th Infantry Divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the applicability of the capability to operations in Europe as well as the Indo-Pacific, long-range fire units must be balanced across both theaters. European militaries, however, lack a strong long-range indirect fire capability, as discussed earlier. The United States can increase its capabilities in Europe by permitting further sales of HIMARS systems to NATO allies. Between 2022 and 2023, the United States completed sales of HIMARS systems to Estonia, Poland, and the Netherlands. To enhance allied lethality, the Army should also continue rotational deployments of HIMARS units in support of the European HIMARS Initiative. Furthermore, the Army should continue the modernization of the long-range fires, to include the development of hypersonic capabilities and fielding of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) to replace existing HIMARS and multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Operations Forces and Security Force Assistance Brigades (SFABs):&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. special operations forces and U.S. Army SFABs are helpful in such areas as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign internal defense&lt;/em&gt;, which involves efforts to build the capacity of foreign governments. This can include training and equipping partners in Europe that border Russia, such as Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland. Special operations forces are an essential part of foreign internal defense. These activities can also include broader efforts to conduct security force assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unconventional warfare&lt;/em&gt;, which includes operations to advise, assist, and accompany non-state partners resisting a hostile actor by operating with or through an underground, auxiliary, and guerrilla force.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Information operations&lt;/em&gt; — or Military Information Support Operations — which involve activities to influence foreign audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other critical activities, such as special reconnaissance, civil affairs operations, direct action, counterterrorism, counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, counterinsurgency, and hostage rescue and recovery. Special operations forces can counter Moscow economically, militarily, and diplomatically below the threshold of conventional war — including through information operations. For example, U.S. forces can also proactively highlight examples of Russian malign activity, human rights abuses, and corruption. Examples of subjects that could be highlighted include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian direct or indirect involvement in human rights abuses, including in Ukraine;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian involvement in the assassination (or attempted assassination) of defectors, political opponents, and those — such as journalists and lawyers — investigating or prosecuting Russian corruption or human rights abuses;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian proxies involved in abuses, including Russian private military companies such as the Wagner Group;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corruption in Russia, including by senior Russian officials;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian support to terrorist and insurgent groups, such as the Taliban in Afghanistan and Lebanese Hezbollah and Shia militias in Syria;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russian economic problems; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Anti-regime riots, protests, and demonstrations in Russia or in Russian-allied countries, such as Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military should increase efforts to build and enhance allied and partner capabilities, with a focus on eastern flank states. The United States has already undertaken significant and credible missions to train partner forces in the Baltics and Ukraine since Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine by deploying special operations forces, the Army’s 4th SFAB, and Army National Guard units. U.S. special operations forces units have taken the lead in training Baltic militaries to counter Russian hybrid and irregular warfare capabilities. To that end, as well as to establish a forward operating site, U.S. forces established a new special operations site in Riga, Latvia, in 2020. The U.S. security cooperation efforts in the region are simultaneously boosted by the National Guard’s State Partnership Program, which assigns certain National Guard units from specific states with partner countries to train forces there. The 4th SFAB similarly operates between the “Baltics and the Black Sea” and, as of September 2022, had 19 teams of military advisers in 10 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forces from the 4th SFAB have also been involved in the training of Ukrainian personnel. However, that effort has been led by the Joint Multinational Training Group-Ukraine (JMTG-U) under the direction of the Security Assistance Group-Ukraine (SAG-U). National Guard units, including a New York State BCT, have trained Ukrainian forces under the JMTG-U to great effect. Where possible, the United States should increase its training of Ukrainian units and personnel to strengthen their ability to withstand and counter further Russian aggression. This should be complemented by an expansion of training programs with the militaries of the Baltic states and other relevant Eastern flank states to defend against hybrid Russian threats. Special operations forces may also provide civil defense training practices to those populations in the event of a heightened or resurgent Russian threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the United States should also take steps to ensure greater coordination among its various security cooperation efforts in Eastern Europe. The Department of Defense (DOD) should assign one entity to lead and manage security cooperation missions in the region to ensure the efficient allocation of units and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-combat-forces&quot;&gt;AIR COMBAT FORCES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air capabilities are critical to achieve U.S. defense objectives, including deterring and defeating armed conflict, countering terrorist and other transnational threats, and maintaining access to trade routes and global commons. Russia has considerable air and air defense capabilities, such as the S-400, which would undermine the United States’ ability to gain air supremacy in a war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For future U.S. posture, there are several important categories of air assets. First, fixed-wing aircraft, such as F-35, F-16, and F-15 squadrons, are helpful for conducting close air support, suppression of enemy air defense, combat air patrol, defensive counter air, strike, and other missions. So are bombers, such as the B-52H Stratofortress and B-21 Raider, which can be useful to attack ground and naval targets. Second, ISR capabilities are important for intelligence and warning. Examples include unmanned aircraft systems (such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-9A, and MQ-9B); airborne early warning and command and control (such as the E-8 Joint STARS, E-3 Sentry, and E-7); and electronic warfare. Along with space capabilities, persistent aerial ISR is critical to collect intelligence, including communications and electronic intelligence. Third are enablers, including transport (such as the C-17 and C-130), aerial refueling (such as the KC-135 and KC-46), and medical evacuation. Fourth are logistics, such as stockpiling spare parts and munitions, personnel, and petroleum, oil, and lubricants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global posture considerations play a major role in recommendations for the air domain in Europe given the value of air combat capabilities in the Indo-Pacific theater. Consequently, a forward defense posture that enhances deterrence should ensure flexibility in the air domain to surge forces to the Indo-Pacific if necessary. It also means that the United States needs to be prepared to accept some risk that can be mitigated through allied capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of air combat capabilities, a forward defense posture includes maintaining all seven forward-deployed fighter squadrons currently based in Europe and adding an additional F-16 squadron to Spangdahlem Air Base. Four squadrons are based at Royal Air Force (RAF) Lakenheath in the United Kingdom under the 48th Fighter Air Wing, including two squadrons of F-35A aircraft and 2 F-15E squadrons. Two squadrons of F-16 aircraft are stationed at Aviano Air Base in Italy under the 31st Fighter Wing, and one additional F-16 squadron is currently stationed at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany under the 52nd Fighter Wing. While stationed out of their respective bases, these units have often been forward deployed to NATO’s eastern flank to provide additional posture amid the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-stationed forces are supplemented by deployments of U.S.-based fighter aircraft to enhance the United States’ forward posture, increasing in the lead-up to and throughout the Ukraine conflict. These supplemental units have included active-duty, reserve, and Air National Guard F-35 units operating out of Spangdahlem Air Base and forward-deployed to allied air bases on the eastern flank in support of NATO Enhanced Air Policing Missions, as well as U.S.-based F-22 and fourth-generation aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-deployed F-35 squadrons enhance the capabilities of U.S. and allied forces to establish air superiority against robust and experienced Russian integrated air defense systems (IADS). F-35 aircraft can also collect electronic signals from and compile a picture of hostile and friendly forces in an area. However, given requirements for the Indo-Pacific region, adding another F-35 squadron to the two currently stationed at RAF Lakenheath is not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, this analysis recommends forward stationing an additional F-16 squadron at Spangdahlem Air Base to provide greater short-term combat capacity as allied F-35 squadrons come online. Additional permanently based fifth-generation squadrons in Europe may be more likely to come as future replacements for the Air Force’s F-15E squadrons, which the service plans to cut by more than half by 2028. F-16 fighters, such as those currently based at Spangdahlem and Aviano Air Bases, will likely continue to serve into the 2040s. However, U.S. Air Forces in Europe should supplement these aircraft with deployments of U.S.-based fifth-generation squadrons of fighter aircraft — either F-35 or F-22 aircraft — as demanded by the threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously discussed, ACE will continue to play a vital role in maximizing the flexibility and survivability of forward-deployed fighter aircraft. ACE will require U.S. aircraft and pilots to operate and rapidly deploy from forward operating sites on allied and partner airfields as part of a hub-and-spoke system. These sites should be “light, lean, and agile,” as noted by General CQ Brown. However, the Air Force needs to ensure that its dispersed sites are equipped with adequate prepositioned equipment and war reserve materiel, including scalable logistics packages, resilient communications, command and control, munitions, spare parts, and petroleum, oil, and lubricants; are resilient from missile and cyber attacks; have adequate infrastructure for storing munitions, fuel, and other materiel; and have forces trained for quick response to enemy missile attacks, including runway repair and medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further maximize flexibility, U.S. air combat forces based in or deployed to Europe must also be prepared to surge to the Indo-Pacific in the event of a contingency. The Air Force has already leveraged EUCOM assets to fill capability gaps in the Indo-Pacific with the temporary transfer of F-16 aircraft from the 52nd Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base to Kadena Air Base in Japan amid the return of its F-15C/D fighter aircraft to the United States. The Air Force and NATO must prepare plans to fill its own capability gaps in the event of further transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;naval-forces&quot;&gt;NAVAL FORCES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve defense objectives in Europe, the United States will likely need several types of maritime capabilities led by U.S. Naval Forces Europe-U.S. Sixth Fleet. Maritime capabilities will be helpful to deter and defeat conventional armed conflict, counter irregular and gray zone activities, maintain access to trade routes and global commons (including in the Arctic), and other objectives. The Russian navy possesses significant maritime capabilities, such as submarines, and it has added the Project 955A Borey-A nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) and the Project 08851 Yasen-M nuclear-powered guided missile submarine to its fleet. European maritime capabilities, as previously discussed, are likely lacking in large-scale combat, given qualitative shortfalls in sensors, weapons, force protection, and survivability systems as well as due to manning, maintenance, and procurement challenges for some navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully leverage its naval capabilities in Europe and compensate for the shortcomings of allied and partner militaries, the United States should expand operations, port visits, and exercises in partnership with allied and partner forces and consider investments in future capabilities to deploy to Europe. However, the United States also needs to pursue flexibility and mitigate risk in its posture given requirements in the Indo-Pacific theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Sixth Fleet, headquartered at Naval Support Activity (NSA) Naples, Italy, conducts and oversees naval operations in the European theater. The Sixth Fleet maintains six destroyers homeported in Rota, Spain, as part of Task Force 65. These destroyers play a critical role in NATO’s ballistic missile defense mission under Operation Atlantic Sentry. The vessels also conduct regular Forward-Deployed Naval Forces-Europe (FDNF-E) patrols throughout the Sixth Fleet area of operations to conduct port visits and strengthen interoperability with allied and partner forces. In addition to the destroyer presence at Rota, the United States also conducts regular carrier strike group deployments and occasional amphibious ready group/Marine expeditionary unit deployments, the latter of which falls under the Sixth Fleet’s Task Force 61/2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve a posture of forward defense in the European area of operations, the United States should enhance its naval presence in the Baltic Sea region with small surface combatants and unmanned vessels through 2030 to reassure and improve interoperability with allies and partners in the region and to deter potential acts of Russian aggression. Russia still maintains a sizeable presence in the region. In 2022, the Swedish government requested a strengthened U.S. naval posture in the region. U.S. ships should conduct more frequent port visits, including both FDNF-E patrols and deployments of U.S.-based assets, as well as bilateral and multilateral exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States must also act in coordination with its NATO allies to tackle several mission sets. Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) remains a critical mission, both in the Baltic and North Seas, which has been much neglected. NATO has consequently increased its joint ASW exercises among allied forces, including Operation Dynamic Mongoose in the North Atlantic in 2022 and Dynamic Manta off the coast of Italy in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Navy could supplement existing NATO ASW capabilities by developing and deploying additional systems to the region. One option is homeporting the U.S. Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship, which has ASW capabilities, in German ports to provide improved situational awareness in the Baltics. Given the Navy’s apparent commitment to retire the Littoral Combat Ship, it could deploy its Constellation-class frigates, which also have ASW capabilities, to the region once they are operational beginning in 2027. However, operational requirements for the presence of surface ships and submarines in the Indo-Pacific should take priority over Baltic deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Indo-Pacific demands for naval forces, the Navy could also leverage its developing unmanned surface and undersea vessels for ASW and additional missions in the Baltic Sea. Pioneered under the Fifth Fleet’s Task Force 59 in U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), the Navy recently announced its intention to deploy these capabilities to the broader fleet beginning with Fourth Fleet under U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) in the summer of 2023. The United States and partners should also increase their number of sonobuoys and static hydrophone networks to track the subsurface threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Navy and NATO allies should additionally prioritize three maritime missions in the Baltic region: hybrid gray zone operations, offensive and defensive mining, and missile defense and suppression. They must develop a plan to tackle hybrid threats to undersea cables and pipelines and other infrastructure that could disrupt the flow of commerce, energy, and data. This is critical to managing escalation and preventing Russia from destabilizing the region. Furthermore, the United States and NATO should plan to leverage the extensive mining and demining capabilities of new members Finland and Sweden in the event of a possible contingency with Russia that threatens naval deployments and the commercial shipping of partners and allies. Finally, the United States and NATO must anticipate the use of anti-ship cruise missiles in a potential conflict with Russia and seek to neutralize this threat through the coordination of the Baltic Air Policing mission and Allied Maritime Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Navy expands its mission set and presence in the Baltic and North Seas, it should strengthen its forward posture by considering homeporting vessels in the region or establishing logistical points to resupply, given the distance from existing sites in Spain, Italy, and Crete. While this would require significant diplomatic outreach, the Navy could explore the possibility of establishing sites at existing ports or naval bases in Germany, Denmark, or other allied states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Black Sea, the United States must work with its NATO allies and partners in the region to enhance its maritime domain awareness. The United States and the NATO alliance should encourage regional partners to cooperate and modernize their military capabilities, including by strengthening sea power in ways that are consistent with the Montreux Convention. The United States should also increase engagement with allied and partner militaries in the region. This could include seeking a more active partnership with the Turkish military in the Black Sea as part of a broader agreement to improve U.S.-Turkish strategic cooperation on a handful of key issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic represents another vital region for U.S. maritime interests. The United States should expand its capabilities and posture in the Arctic through the U.S. Coast Guard. The 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region outlined security as one of its four strategic pillars for the region. The strategy called for “expanding the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker fleet to support persistent presence in the U.S. Arctic and additional presence as needed in the European Arctic.” The primary goal of U.S. forces in the region is to support the homeland defense mission as well as power-projection and deterrence goals, alongside safeguarding commercial and scientific activities. While the strategy primarily emphasizes the need to deter aggression from Russia in the Arctic, it also notes expanded Chinese activities there. Russia seeks to maintain its economic interests, such as oil and gas megaprojects, in the region while leveraging the Arctic for greater power projection and potentially hybrid activities to threaten European Arctic countries. Russia currently operates more than 40 icebreakers. China has increased its presence and posture in the Arctic, maintaining three research sites in Svalbard, Iceland, and Sweden and operating two icebreakers, with a third under development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should seek to expand its Arctic posture and capabilities as rapidly as possible to counter Russian and Chinese security interests in the region. Currently, the U.S. Coast Guard only operates two icebreakers, the heavy cutter Polar Star and the medium cutter Healy, neither of which can be used for all-year Arctic icebreaking missions. The Coast Guard plans to expand its icebreaking fleet with the procurement of three heavy Polar Security Cutters (PSCs), although delays have pushed the delivery of the first vessel back to 2026 or 2027, and three medium Arctic Security Cutters (ASCs). In 2021, then-commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard Karl Schultz called for a fleet of nine total icebreakers (six PSCs and three ASCs). As the United States awaits delivery of its new vessels, it should seek to enhance cooperation with Arctic allies through joint operations and combined exercises and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;logistics-and-enablers&quot;&gt;LOGISTICS AND ENABLERS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines several types of logistics and enablers, including prepositioned equipment and munitions stockpiles, ISR, integrated air and missile defense, and infrastructure and mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepositioned Equipment and Munitions Stockpiles:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should take steps to bolster its prepositioned equipment and munitions stocks in Europe to enhance the readiness of U.S. forces in the event of a contingency with Russia. The Army maintains its Army Prepositioned Stock-2 (APS-2) across four sites in three different countries (Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands), with a fifth APS-2 site planned for Poland. These sites, operated by the 405th Army Field Support Brigade, contain enough materiel to equip two ABCTs. The Army issued some of this stock in March 2022 to the 1st ABCT, 3rd Infantry Division in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While APS-2 stocks have been bolstered by funding from the European Deterrence Initiative, the Army should take additional steps to improve the readiness of this equipment and the forces overseeing it. A DOD inspector general investigation found that some materiel provided from APS-2 was “non-fully mission capable” and that “maintenance and coordination shortfalls occurred.” In the event of a direct conflict against Russia, U.S. forces arriving in theater must be assured that they will receive capable equipment to rapidly equip and engage the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to enhancing prepositioned equipment, the DOD must ensure that EUCOM is maintaining appropriate inventories of munitions in the region. The war in Ukraine has illustrated the role of long-range artillery, and U.S. and NATO forces must have enough missiles and munitions in theater to contend with and counter Russian forces. That includes munitions for the Air Force, which must develop plans to maintain weapons for aircraft operating under the ACE concept at forward locations, and the Army EUCOM’s munitions starter stocks, which preposition key munitions — including Patriot Missile Segment Enhancement — in Europe for use in the event of a contingency. Additionally, EUCOM should seek to reinforce and build additional facilities to store munitions to distribute across the theater for easier access and enhanced survivability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance:&lt;/strong&gt; The demand for U.S. ISR assets will only increase as the U.S. military expands missions and operations in the Indo-Pacific and the Russian military reconstitutes its capabilities on NATO’s eastern flank. While the United States should prioritize the Indo-Pacific, the DOD should maximize its available ISR assets for use by both EUCOM and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM). The DOD is currently seeking to modernize its ISR capabilities, with plans to retire the RQ-4 by FY 2027 and the MQ-9 by FY 2035. However, the DOD and the services must ensure that any gaps in ISR coverage are limited. This could be managed by timing the retirement of certain platforms to coincide with the activation of new assets. Alternatively, the DOD could leverage commercial capabilities to cover any gaps until requirements are established and new platforms are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Army is currently testing commercial assets in operations in Europe under its High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) to define the requirements for the replacement for the RC-12 Guardrail aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space-based ISR assets will play a major role in both covering gaps and supplementing ISR provided by traditional airborne assets. Commercial satellite imagery has already been used by NATO to fill gaps in coverage and played a major role in identifying Russian military movements in the lead-up to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In the next few years, the United States should further leverage commercial satellite imagery to bolster its ISR capabilities in Europe. Over the long term, however, the DOD must ultimately determine the appropriate balance between leasing commercial services and establishing its own systems to ensure sustainable and reliable coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Air and Missile Defense:&lt;/strong&gt; Some changes to U.S. air and missile defense posture should be made in the event that some of the recommendations here are adopted, including the permanent basing of an ABCT in Poland. If a new base is established, the United States should consider shifting the headquarters of the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command from Rhine Ordnance Barracks in Germany. A new base in Poland would require a significant investment in air and missile defense capabilities given its proximity to Russia. If the Army chooses not to move the entire command to Poland, it should prioritize shifting the battalion headquarters of the 5th Battalion, 7th Air Defense Artillery Regiment, which provides command and control operations of Patriot batteries, and the 5th Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment and its short-range air defense capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a broader force-planning perspective, however, the Army should prioritize the deployment of additional Patriot battalions, which operate at the highest OPTEMPO of Army units and are in high demand from multiple combatant commands. Given their value in potential conflicts with China and Russia, the Army should create additional units to limit the stress and degradation of readiness of existing units, particularly given the lack of European capabilities in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of ballistic missile defense, the United States should also maintain its current posture and force structure in line with Operation Atlantic Sentry. Relevant units include the six Aegis destroyers homeported in Rota, Spain, along with the two Aegis Ashore sites based in Romania and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure, Mobility, and Access:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, in partnership with host nations and other NATO allies, should also take steps to improve military infrastructure and mobility to ensure ease of access, transportation, and reliable communications throughout the European theater. These include enhancements to infrastructure on both U.S. bases and in partner countries, such as the installation of fiber-optic cables and improvements to rail, road networks, and bridges. The DOD and European Defence Agency have identified military mobility as one area of collaboration under an Administrative Arrangement reached in April 2023 (see security cooperation section below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also continue to update its security and defense cooperation agreements with its partners and allies to ensure ease of access. In December 2023, the United States reached new agreements with Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania that provided U.S. forces with access to bases and other infrastructure in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuclear-posture&quot;&gt;NUCLEAR POSTURE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should continue with planned nuclear modernization efforts, exercises, and scheduled deployments of assets to the European theater to bolster its deterrent capabilities and reassure allies. The United States currently deploys 100 tactical bombs — the B61-3 and B61-4 gravity bombs — in air bases in Europe across five countries. Under current U.S. nuclear-sharing policy, control over those bombs is maintained by the U.S. Air Force, but seven countries contribute dual-capable aircraft to the mission (Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Greece, and the United States) and four air forces (from Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy) are assigned an active nuclear strike role with those weapons in the event that a nuclear mission is approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is currently in the process of modernizing its gravity bombs, with the new B61-12 having begun full-scale production in 2022 and deployment originally planned for the spring of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of U.S. and allied dual-capable aircraft will be certified to operate the B61-12, including the F-15E, F-35A, F-16, B-2, and German PA-200 Tornado (currently planned to be retired and replaced by the F-35A by 2030).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO is also modernizing its nuclear weapons storage facilities, including making upgrades to command and control structures and base security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military and NATO should also continue to conduct exercises with nuclear-capable platforms, including Bomber Task Force missions, to enhance readiness and assure allies of U.S. support. These include the annual NATO Steadfast Noon exercise, which practices nuclear sharing. However, such exercises should occur on a regularly scheduled timeline to ensure consistency and limit the potential for escalation with or misinterpretation by Russia. There is no evidence that unscheduled Bomber Task Force deployments conducted under the dynamic force employment model offered additional deterrent value, particularly given the still lengthy amount of time necessary to organize such missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-and-space&quot;&gt;CYBER AND SPACE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cyber and space domains, U.S. forces should take steps to enhance the security and resilience of their own systems and networks while simultaneously assisting European partners and allies in securing their own capabilities. U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) should deploy additional “hunt forward” teams to Europe in line with its “defend forward” strategy to counter threats from Russia and Russian-backed groups to U.S. forces and allies. CYBERCOM deployed its largest hunt forward team to Ukraine between 2021 and 2022. To capably resource further deployments and ensure readiness, CYBERCOM should also seek to expand the number of cyber mission teams across the services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should further define its authorities for and consider expanding its conduct of offensive cyber operations against Russian forces, particularly in the event that the conflict in Ukraine and Russian cyberattacks persist. The United States should also expand deployments of U.S. Space Force units and personnel to Europe and define their role within NATO. The service is currently standing up its own component to operate in EUCOM. Space Force units can play a major role in supporting forward-deployed U.S. forces by preventing enemy interference and maintaining open lines of satellite communication. Additionally, space-based ISR assets will continue to play a major role in the European theater, and the U.S. military should also further leverage commercial capabilities to fill gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, U.S. forces should enhance redundancy, in addition to improving the resilience of U.S. assets and networks in terms of both software and hardware. Establishing clear fallback options for communications and ISR in the event of a contingency is vital to ensuring the survivability of networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-cooperation&quot;&gt;SECURITY COOPERATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to maintaining and bolstering traditional partner capacity-building efforts, the DOD, in tandem with EUCOM and the U.S. Department of State, should adopt a broader approach to security cooperation in the region. This would entail supporting the efforts of NATO allies and other European partners to develop and acquire advanced military capabilities and lessen their reliance on U.S. units and platforms, particularly enabling forces that support operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/b1N9P6o.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this effort, the DOD should consider standing up a new organization within EUCOM to coordinate broader U.S. security cooperation efforts in Europe. This organization should have representation from the services, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and work closely with the Department of State. It would directly interface with NATO headquarters and allied militaries to manage requests for security assistance and arms sales, as well as provide guidance on the development of new capabilities, as needed. The organization’s objective would be to bolster allied and partner capacity by focusing on closing quantitative and qualitative gaps within European militaries that drive their reliance on U.S. forces in some areas. It could also pursue greater coordination and information sharing between the United States and European allies in the development of new technologies and capabilities, thereby ensuring interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD has already taken some steps to bolster cooperation efforts and information sharing with European partners in its April 2023 Administrative Arrangement reached with the European Defence Agency (EDA). The agreement provides a framework for the United States and EDA to “exchange information and explore collaborative activities falling within the scope of EDA’s mission,” with a focus on areas including supply chain issues, military mobility, and the impact of climate change on defense activities. However, the terms of the agreement specifically preclude “research and technology” from the scope of the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-3&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations outlined in this chapter seek to enhance U.S. military posture from its levels before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. While this posture strengthens the ability of the United States and NATO to deter and repel Russian aggression on the continent, it also pursues more sustainable policies by shifting the presence of U.S. ground forces largely to permanent, forward-stationed forces and articulates trade-offs and limitations with other strategic pri orities, such as competition with China in the Indo-Pacific region. Moreover, it seeks to accommodate both the benefits and shortcomings of allied capabilities in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ch-07&quot;&gt;CH. 07&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;alternative-options&quot;&gt;ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations for the future of U.S. military posture in Europe, as outlined in the preceding chapter, provide the necessary forces and capabilities to realize the United States’ interests and strategic objectives outlined in Chapter 5. There are, however, alternative military postures to this “forward defense” approach that the United States could adopt based on different interests and objectives. This chapter briefly assesses the components of alternative U.S. posture options for Europe through 2030, along with their associated advantages and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter focuses chiefly on three broad approaches: an extension of the U.S. military’s current posture in Europe in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; a strategy of restraint; and a China-first strategy that strictly prioritizes competition with China above all other objectives. It should be noted that the latter two strategies do not represent a singular, cohesive approach that is uniformly agreed upon by their advocates. Similarly, there is overlap in the views and advocates of these two approaches. While these strategies may offer some benefits to U.S. foreign policy, such as prioritizing resources for competition in the Indo-Pacific, their significant cuts to U.S. posture in Europe would severely undermine the ability of the United States and NATO to deter and respond to threats from a revanchist Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maintain-current-us-posture&quot;&gt;MAINTAIN CURRENT U.S. POSTURE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One alternative is to extend the U.S. military’s existing posture in Europe, as currently oriented in response to Russia’s invasion, through 2030. This posture is based on an operational concept of deterrence by denial, and it relies on an enhanced military presence, as illustrated by the United States’ current end strength of approximately 100,000 personnel in Europe. The U.S. military would maintain that posture throughout the time frame or until European allies bolster their capabilities and capacity to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a posture would be based on the current 5+2 model that maintains five total brigade combat teams (BCTs), including the two additional BCTs deployed after Russia’s invasion (one rotational armored brigade combat team [ABCT] and one rotational infantry brigade combat team [IBCT] in Romania) in addition to the pre-war units (a forward-stationed IBCT and Stryker brigade combat team [SBCT] based in Italy and Germany, respectively, and one rotational ABCT as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve). The model would keep headquarters in Germany and Poland as well. In terms of air combat forces, this posture would maintain the seven fighter squadrons currently forward deployed and add a persistent rotational deployment of fifth-generation aircraft to NATO’s eastern flank. Other force structure elements would remain largely unchanged from the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current U.S. military posture provides greater combat capability for U.S. and allied forces in Europe with the deployment of an additional ABCT, which could consequently provide increased deterrent value against Russia. This strengthened posture also serves to reassure European allies, particularly those on the eastern flank, of the United States’ commitment. However, there are drawbacks to maintaining this enhanced posture over the long term. While a second ABCT provides greater combat capability and potential deterrent value, it does not ensure that NATO would be able to defeat a determined Russian invasion on the eastern flank, particularly an attack against the Baltic states, where there is limited strategic depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining the current enhanced military posture in Europe would also force the United States to incur greater costs in terms of operating expenses and readiness. As discussed in the preceding chapter, rotationally deployed units are more expensive from both a cost and readiness standpoint than forward-deployed units. Two rotational ABCTs would put greater stress on the Army’s force-generation model, given the time and additional units required to replace following the end of their deployment. While constructing a permanent military base in Poland would entail costs in the short-term, it would prove more sustainable over the long term and allow units to integrate into the local community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, maintaining the current 5+2 posture model in Europe risks encouraging free riding from U.S. allies and delaying their efforts to strengthen their own military capabilities in terms of both force size and modernization. The recommended 4+2 model, with a permanent forward-stationed ABCT in Poland, highlights U.S. long-term resolve and commitment while also stressing that NATO militaries must swiftly enhance their forces and posture on the eastern flank in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-restraint&quot;&gt;STRATEGIC RESTRAINT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic restraint, sometimes called offshore balancing, argues that the United States is fundamentally secure based on its relative geographic isolation, nuclear arsenal, and military power. According to this view, the United States has over-extended itself with costly overseas commitments and misguided interventions in countries and missions that are not critical to U.S. interests. Consequently, advocates for strategic restraint call for the United States to draw down its global military presence and missions to focus on more limited objectives, to include homeland defense or preventing rivals from disrupting the global or regional balances of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advocates for strategic restraint largely argue for a drawdown or the complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from Europe. Some have even called for reconsidering the United States’ membership in NATO, although that is by no means a universally shared view within the restraint community. While restraint is a broad and ideologically diverse approach, most advocates agree that the United States should end or significantly reduce its military presence in Europe on geopolitical and budgetary grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While advocates call for a reduction of U.S. forces in Europe, they have yet to offer detailed analysis of the future U.S. posture they envision and the force elements that would remain on the continent. However, the main component of a restraint force posture would entail a reduction in U.S. presence from Europe over 5 to 10 years to the eventual withdrawal of most U.S. forces. The United States would end access agreements with European partners and either close or repurpose most of its bases, predominantly Army bases. For example, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Barry Posen calls for remaining bases to be converted to forward operating sites or cooperative security locations for use in the event of a contingency. Forces along the eastern flank, including the rotational ABCT presence in Poland and the IBCT in Romania, would be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, some U.S. forces would likely remain in theater. In terms of ground forces, the United States could retain its forward-stationed IBCT to serve as a contingency response force, and special operations forces could also retain a small footprint to realize limited U.S. objectives on the ground. While the United States would withdraw its F-35 squadrons from the United Kingdom, it could retain its F-15E presence at Royal Air Force (RAF) Lakenheath and consider maintaining its F-16 presence at either Spangdahlem or Aviano Air Bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the maritime domain, the United States could retain naval bases, including in Rota and Naples, and forces to ensure freedom of navigation at sea and U.S. command over the maritime commons. Finally, the United States may seek to maintain some nuclear weapons in Europe and the nuclear-sharing mission to counter major aggression from Russia. To compensate for the lack of forces in the area, it may opt to increase stocks of prepositioned equipment for use in the event of a contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporters argue that the primary benefit of adopting a posture of restraint in Europe would be to free up forces and resources that could be allocated elsewhere, since many believe that the United States is “not capable of conducting full-scale operations against China and Russia simultaneously.” The strategy of restraint would reduce the U.S. position in Europe to a supporting role, which advocates justify by arguing that its NATO allies and the European Union possess enough military and economic power to counter Russian forces and other security crises. The United States could then prioritize allocation of resources toward other priorities, such as strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, advocates of restraint argue that withdrawing forces from Europe would significantly reduce the challenge of free riding by NATO allies and encourage greater European investment toward defense capabilities. While other NATO allies have lagged behind the United States in terms of security investment, supporters of strategic restraint argue that the strong U.S. presence in Europe has “long suppressed” the development of indigenous defense capabilities on the continent and hindered cooperation between European states. Withdrawing U.S. forces would require Europe to invest much more significantly in its own defense and would result in budgetary savings for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these arguments, the drawbacks of a restraint-based posture in Europe outweigh its advantages. First, a significantly reduced U.S. presence would incur significant risk and potentially embolden a revanchist Russia to pursue acts of aggression against states on the eastern flank. As argued in Chapter 3, Russia is actively modernizing and rebuilding its military with some help from China, Iran, and other countries. In the event of a contingency, U.S. forces would take longer to deploy from the United States and respond to threats against NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, while allies and partners may invest more in their own defense, they would likely not be able to develop the forces and capabilities necessary to compensate for withdrawn U.S. forces even in the event of a phased drawdown over several years. As outlined in Chapter 4, while European nations are largely able to perform small-scale military missions and some medium-scale missions without U.S. assistance, they typically require U.S. collaboration to successfully execute large-scale operations. European forces rely heavily on the U.S. military for assistance in areas such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), logistics support, long-range precision support, heavy maneuver forces, and maritime operations. Most lack capacity in their defense industrial base to indigenously develop the required systems in a short time frame, and many face ongoing personnel and equipment shortages, interoperability challenges, and uncertain future funding for efforts such as air and naval patrol missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, advocates of restraint overstate the budgetary savings associated with reducing the overseas presence of U.S. forces. To generate significant savings, the Department of Defense would have to wholly eliminate units and divest equipment rather than simply return U.S. units and personnel to the contiguous United States. In addition to being politically and logistically difficult, such eliminations would leave the U.S. military unable to redeploy forces to other theaters such as the Indo-Pacific — thus negating the first and most important benefit that restraint advocates hope to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, the detrimental effects of a force posture based on restraint would outweigh its alleged benefits. Such a posture would create significant security risks and operational gaps across the European continent without producing meaningful savings for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-first&quot;&gt;CHINA FIRST&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A China-first strategy shares similar underpinnings to the “offshore balancing” strain of restraint. Advocates of this approach argue that U.S. forces and resources dedicated to European security and, more specifically, to Ukraine in its conflict with Russia undermine the United States’ ability to compete with China in the Indo-Pacific and to defend Taiwan. Advocates of a China-first strategy argue that if Taiwan is taken by China, the United States’ military position in the region and the confidence of Asian partners states in the ability of the United States to confront China would weaken. Members of the restraint community note that the alignment of China-first “hawks” with foreign policy realists has “reshaped” the debate over U.S. security commitments to Europe. However, restraint advocates generally do not view the China threat as urgent as China-first supporters do, while some view U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific more narrowly. Consequently, restraint advocates argue for reductions in U.S. forces in Europe on geopolitical and budgetary grounds, as noted above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China-first advocates have similarly not built out detailed posture recommendations for U.S. forces in Europe. However, they have articulated the types of capabilities and trade-offs they would seek to bolster U.S. presence in the Indo-Pacific at the expense of U.S. posture in Europe. These trade-offs would result in major cuts to U.S. forces and capabilities in Europe that could significantly hinder NATO’s ability to deter Russian aggression. As one China-first advocate writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So long as China is our priority, the United States will be forced to withhold forces from Europe to deter or defeat Chinese aggression, even if Russia attacks NATO first. This will significantly limit our ability to help deter, deny, or repel a Russian assault because many of the capabilities required for a Taiwan contingency are also vital for Europe, including air and naval strike platforms; long-range missiles; air and missile defenses; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets; and logistics forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this approach, force structure elements that would be removed or reduced from the United States’ current military posture in Europe for redeployment to the Indo-Pacific would include the two F-35 squadrons from RAF Lakenheath and at least some number of the six destroyers currently forward-stationed at Rota. In terms of ground forces, a China-first posture would similarly reduce long-range fires and theater air and missile defense assets to be prioritized for competition in the Indo-Pacific. Critical enablers — including airlift and aerial refueling, prepositioned stocks, and munitions stockpiles — would similarly be de-prioritized in the European theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A China-first approach to posture in Europe is thus willing to incur major risk and even potential military setbacks to field the needed capabilities and systems in the Indo-Pacific region. Accordingly, advocates call on NATO allies and partners in the European Union to take on a significantly greater burden in providing for their own defense. While a China-first posture in Europe may retain more U.S. forces relative to a restraint posture, such as ABCTs, China-first supporters are willing to divest those forces and units in a resource-constrained fiscal environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to shifting current forces from Europe to the Indo-Pacific, China-first advocates also call for shifting force planning and security assistance efforts toward competition with China and the defense of Taiwan. They argue that procurement policy and the development of new capabilities should prioritize systems and capabilities for Indo-Pacific missions and the Taiwan contingency, such as surface ships, submarines, and precision-guided munitions. They also call for greater investments in improving the resilience of Indo-Pacific basing and infrastructure at the expense of similar investments in Europe. Advocates more forcefully argue against the security assistance currently provided to Ukraine in its war against Russia. They contend that this assistance, particularly of munitions, has at least two problems: it is contributing to dwindling U.S. stockpiles that could be used in a contingency with China, and munitions should instead be allocated to the defense of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advocates of a China-first approach to strategy and posture generally recognize the high level of risk they are willing to incur in order to prioritize the Indo-Pacific and ensure that Taiwan does not fall to China. However, a Europe posture based on this strategy poses many of the same drawbacks as restraint. But the immediate shift in forces and capabilities from Europe to the Indo-Pacific associated with a China-first strategy poses much greater short-term risk in Europe, particularly if assistance to Ukraine is drastically reduced at the same time. The reduction in military aid vital to the Ukrainian war effort could allow the Russian military to gain the upper hand in the conflict, conquer all (or at least more) territory in Ukraine, encourage Russia to take military action elsewhere in Europe and other regions, and embolden China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-4&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, any benefits of the three alternatives — extending the U.S. military’s current posture in Europe, restraint, or China-first — are outweighed by the costs and risks. As noted in Chapter 8, a significant withdrawal of U.S. forces along the lines of restraint or a China-first approach would jeopardize U.S. national security interests and significantly embolden authoritarian regimes in China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-iii-conclusion&quot;&gt;PART III CONCLUSION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ch-08&quot;&gt;CH. 08&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;FINAL THOUGHTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military presence in Europe will likely remain contentious for several reasons. First, a substantial number of U.S. policymakers and analysts assess that China is the most significant threat to the United States for the foreseeable future and that the United States should focus the bulk of its military posture and attention — including its military air, naval, and maritime forces — in the Indo-Pacific. Second, some policymakers and analysts support decreasing the U.S. presence in Europe because European governments have generally failed to increase their defense budgets or focus on high-end military capabilities. Third, some contend that the United States should focus on problems at home, such as combatting immigration, improving health care, and stemming the production, trafficking, and use of such drugs as fentanyl. Fourth, still others assess that Russia poses little conventional or nuclear threat to the United States and its NATO allies in the short- or long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is validity in some of these points. China is a major threat, European governments need to spend more (and spend more effectively) on defense, and the United States needs to better address a wide range of challenges at home. As this report maintains, however, the United States has significant and enduring interests in Europe that will require a force posture of “forward defense.” A notable decline in the United States’ force posture in Europe would likely be significant and dangerous for U.S. national security in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it would embolden a revanchist Moscow and undermine deterrence in Europe. President Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders would likely see a declining U.S. force posture in Europe as a sign of weakening U.S. resolve and potentially declining power. The United States’ limited response following Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and military action in eastern Ukraine later that year likely encouraged Russia to take future action. Second, a deteriorating U.S. posture would likely embolden other U.S. adversaries, such as China, and heighten concerns among U.S. allies and partners in Asia about U.S. resolve. The views in Taipei, the most likely flashpoint with China, are striking. Some of Taiwan’s national security leaders have warned that a reduced U.S. commitment to Europe — including aid to Ukraine — would heighten Taiwanese concerns about U.S. resolve. Only 34 percent of those in Taiwan in 2023 believed that the United States is a trustworthy country, a decline of more than 11 percentage points from 2021. Researchers assessed that the drop was partly caused by a perception that U.S. resolve is weakening in Europe, including in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;persistent-us-interests-in-europe&quot;&gt;PERSISTENT U.S. INTERESTS IN EUROPE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has several enduring interests in Europe: protect the U.S. homeland and the security of the American people from threats based in Europe; promote and expand economic prosperity and opportunity; realize and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life; and defend and support the United States’ European allies. As noted in more detail below, Russia will remain the most significant threat to Europe for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. interests in Europe are likely to endure even with a U.S. focus on the Indo-Pacific and other regions. Based on these interests, the United States has several defense objectives in Europe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deter and defeat conventional and nuclear-armed conflict directed against the U.S. homeland and U.S. allies, as well as coerce, persuade, and influence adversary behavior;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counter irregular and gray zone activities and compete effectively below the threshold of conventional conflict using both defensive and offensive means;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counter terrorist and other transnational threats;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deter and prevent state and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintain access to trade routes and global commons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. interests and defense objectives in Europe are based, to a great extent, on deterring a revanchist Russia. In the short term, NATO should be able to effectively deter a Russian conventional or nuclear attack against NATO territory, though Russia possesses significant irregular and gray zone capabilities. Over the next three to five years, however, the threat from Russia will likely increase. Moscow has the intentions and is developing the capabilities to threaten the United States, Europe, and their allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the long run, there are several factors that could change the military balance in Europe. For example, the United States could become overstretched due to a major theater war against China in the Indo-Pacific. European conventional and logistical capabilities are limited — particularly for high-end war — which creates vulnerabilities if the United States were to withdraw significant air, naval, and even ground forces from the region. U.S. or European political will to develop robust military capabilities or strengthen NATO could also weaken, undermining deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia could rebuild its military capabilities over the next several years with help from China, Iran, North Korea, and other countries. Indeed, the speed of Russian military reconstitution will likely be impacted by help from China’s industrial base, as well as assistance from Iran, North Korea, and other countries. China has already provided several types of assistance to Russian defense firms, such as navigation equipment for M-17 military transport helicopters; jamming technology, such as telescoping antennas for military vehicles; parts for fighter jets; parts for radar units, which are used to detect enemy aircraft, missiles, and unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) as part of Russia’s S-400 anti-aircraft missile system; semiconductor chips for weapons systems; more than $12 million in UASs and UAS parts; and substantial aid to offset Western sanctions. As a 2023 U.S. intelligence report concluded, China “has also become an increasingly important buttress for Russia in its war effort” by “supplying Moscow with key technology and dual-use equipment used in Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Iran has provided several types of assistance to Russia, such as UASs, particularly the Shahed-136 precision-attack suicide drone; over 300,000 artillery shells and over 1 million rounds of ammunition; infrastructure, including helping to build a UAS factory in the Russian town of Yelabuga; and potentially ballistic missiles. Finally, North Korea has provided some military assistance, including artillery shells and other munitions, to Russia. Growing foreign assistance to Russia from China, Iran, and North Korea will help facilitate the reconstitution of its military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;developing-a-posture-of-forward-defense&quot;&gt;DEVELOPING A POSTURE OF FORWARD DEFENSE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. posture in Europe should be flexible enough to maintain deterrence but also allow some U.S. air and naval forces to surge to other regions — such as the Indo-Pacific — in case of contingencies. While this study does not conduct a global posture study, it assesses that the United States will likely need to deter two major adversaries, Russia and China. The United States should take several steps to enhance its posture in Europe over the next several years to strengthen deterrence and reassure its NATO allies in response to a Russia whose leaders are rebuilding their military and possess revanchist ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should adopt a 4+2 posture beginning in 2025 that consists of four U.S. brigade combat teams (BCTs) and two headquarters, in Germany and Poland. This force posture would involve shifting from a rotational to a permanent armored brigade combat team (ABCT) in Poland to strengthen deterrence against a revanchist Russia. Overall, the United States should retain three permanent forward-stationed BCTs — one ABCT in Poland, one infantry brigade combat team (IBCT) in Italy, and one Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) in Germany — and one rotational IBCT headquartered in Romania. This model should include the permanent forward-basing of two combat aviation brigades. In addition, the United States should increase its long-range fires capabilities in Europe by facilitating further sales of systems, such as the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), to NATO allies. Finally, the U.S. military should increase efforts to build and enhance allied and partner special operations capabilities, with a focus on Eastern flank states, as part of forward defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air:&lt;/strong&gt; In terms of air combat capabilities, a forward defense posture recommends maintaining all seven forward-deployed fighter squadrons currently based in Europe and adding an additional F-16 squadron to Spangdahlem Air Base. Forward-deployed F-35 squadrons enhance the capabilities of U.S. and allied forces, given the aircraft’s ability to collect and transfer electronic data from adversary systems to provide greater situational awareness. In addition, this analysis recommends forward-stationing an additional F-16 squadron at Spangdahlem to provide greater short-term combat capacity as allied F-35 squadrons come online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maritime:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should continue its naval presence in the Baltic Sea region to deter Russian aggression and strengthen interoperability with allies and partners. In addition, the U.S. Navy should supplement existing NATO anti-submarine warfare capabilities by developing and deploying additional systems to the region. The United States should also expand its Arctic posture and capabilities to counter Russian and Chinese security interests. The U.S. Coast Guard could expand its icebreaking fleet with the procurement of three heavy Polar Security Cutters and three medium Arctic Security Cutters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepositioned Equipment and Munitions Stockpiles:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should bolster its prepositioned equipment and munitions stocks in Europe to enhance the readiness of U.S. forces. While the Army Prepositioned Stock-2 has been somewhat augmented by funding from the European Deterrence Initiative, the Army should take additional steps to improve the readiness of this equipment and the forces overseeing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance:&lt;/strong&gt; The demand for U.S. ISR assets will only increase as the military expands missions and operations in the Indo-Pacific and the Russian military reconstitutes its capabilities on NATO’s eastern flank. While priority may be given to the Indo-Pacific, the Department of Defense (DOD) should maximize its available ISR assets for use by both U.S. European Command and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. The DOD is currently seeking to modernize its ISR capabilities, with plans to retire the RQ-4 by FY 2027 and the MQ-9 by FY 2035. However, the DOD and the services must ensure that any gaps in ISR coverage are limited. This could be managed by timing the retirement of certain platforms to coincide with the activation of new assets. Alternatively, the DOD could leverage commercial capabilities to cover any gaps until requirements are established and new platforms come online. The Army is currently testing commercial assets in operations in Europe under its High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) to define the requirements for the replacement for the RC-12 Guardrail aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Air and Missile Defense:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should increase air and missile defense capabilities in Poland in coordination with a permanent ABCT in Poland. The Army should also prioritize the development and deployment of additional Patriot battalions. In terms of ballistic missile defense, the United States should maintain its current posture and force structure in line with Operation Atlantic Sentry. Relevant units include the six Aegis destroyers homeported in Rota, Spain, along with the two Aegis Ashore sites based in Romania and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuclear Posture:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should increase modernization efforts, exercises, and scheduled deployments of assets to the European theater to bolster its deterrent capabilities and reassure allies. This includes modernizing its gravity bombs with the new B61-12. The U.S. military and NATO should also continue to conduct exercises with nuclear-capable platforms, including Bomber Task Force missions, to enhance readiness and assure allies of U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber and Space:&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. forces should continue to enhance the security and resilience of their cyber systems and networks while simultaneously assisting European partners and allies. U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) should deploy additional “hunt forward” teams to Europe to counter threats to U.S. forces and allies from Russia and Russian-backed groups. To capably resource further deployments and ensure readiness, CYBERCOM should also seek to expand the number of cyber mission teams across the services. The United States should also expand deployments of U.S. Space Force units and personnel to Europe. Space Force units can play a major role in supporting forward-deployed U.S. forces by preventing enemy interference and maintaining open lines of satellite communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should focus on helping strengthen European military capabilities in such areas as combat support, including short-range air defense and long-range fires; airlift; heavy maneuver forces; maritime capabilities, including sensors and survivability systems; sufficient quantities of long-range precision strike weapons, such as long-range anti-ship missiles; and multi-spectrum ranges to train and maintain high-readiness forces. Security cooperation efforts should also involve additional security assistance, arms sales, training, partner capacity missions, and strategic coordination between the United States, NATO, and European states on the development of forces and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe remains a vital region for the United States. The last two U.S. national security and national defense strategies have prioritized China as the main global threat. But Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, continuing aggression, and growing cooperation with China are stark reminders that the United States has significant and enduring interests in Europe as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示楊清奇和盧峯（前主筆馮偉光）之間的訊息，談及資深傳媒人區家麟的英語版個人簡介。楊指，區是以中文寫作的，《蘋果》英文版面世之後，由英文版的同事將其文章翻譯成英文。楊又指，將中文評論文章翻譯成英文及刊登在英文版之前，並不需要徵得相關作者的同意，「所以有一啲作者都會投訴翻譯得唔好嘅。」楊指，若作者的文章在實體報紙刊登，可獲得稿費，但是當他們的文章刊登在英文版，則沒有額外的稿費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;特朗普簽署香港自治法後-楊清奇以中美對抗升級作為星期六論壇版主題&quot;&gt;特朗普簽署《香港自治法》後 楊清奇以「中美對抗升級」作為星期六論壇版主題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指旅美作家「一劍飄塵」的文章〈美國會制裁林鄭月娥嗎〉，在2020年7月18日刊登在評論版，當日論壇版有特定主題「中美對抗升級」。楊確認當日是星期六，而逢星期六論壇版會有主題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何使用「中美對抗升級」作為主題，楊指時任美國總統特朗普在同年7月14日簽署了《香港自治法案》，相信當時應該是想做相關社會反應，所以他決定了用這個主題。不過他當時雖然知道會有制裁名單，但基於時差問題，其時尚未知道誰人會被列入名單。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到與「一劍飄塵」安排在同一版面的另外兩篇文章，分別是〈「玫瑰園廢話」〉和〈南海爭奪戰——中美環球戰略對抗第一步〉，作者分別是美國教授夏明和香港學者許楨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果曾收前政協劉夢熊投稿-楊清奇上司轉發文章多數會刊登&quot;&gt;《蘋果》曾收前政協劉夢熊投稿 楊清奇：上司轉發文章多數會刊登&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示 WhatsApp 訊息紀錄，顯示時任執行總編輯林文宗在2020年1月21日，向楊清奇轉發了一篇由前政協委員劉夢熊撰寫的文章，並指「劉夢熊投稿」。楊表示，對於這篇投稿，「我會視之為上司要我刊出嘅散稿嚟」，當收到上司的投稿，他在多數的情況都會刊登，只有個別有問題的文章，楊才會告知林不會刊登。控方遂展示於報紙論壇版刊出了的文章〈一國兩制：香港在做 台灣在看〉，日期為2020年1月23日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Pc3NTKI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 劉夢熊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊確認在2019至2021年之間，由上司給予的散稿，包括劉夢熊的文章，都需要符合3個主要原則，即「支持政治上的民主」、「支持經濟上的市場化」和「不支持港獨」。他覺得這亦符合黎的觀點，「因為啲高層都好清楚黎先生嘅觀點嘅。」不過劉的文章很少出現在論壇版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指收到李柱銘朋友投稿-後來刊於論壇版&quot;&gt;楊清奇指收到李柱銘朋友投稿 後來刊於論壇版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年4月23日由林文宗傳送給楊清奇的訊息，指「馬丁」的朋友有篇文章想在論壇版刊登，原稿題為〈江菁名言——主席叫我咬誰就咬誰〉，作者署名是「牧民」。楊問林：「作者係乜身份？」林回覆「問吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊指訊息中的「馬丁」就是民主黨創黨主席李柱銘（Martin Lee）。楊指一般情況下，他會問作者是否願意披露真實身份，如果不願意的話，就會介紹該作者為「自由撰稿人」。楊記得林文宗最後並未有回覆「牧民」的身份，所以就視他為不願意披露真實身份。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NKnEZCr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李柱銘&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊另指，原稿標題的「江菁」寫錯，他記得有替他改為「江青」。控方遂展示最後刊登於《蘋果》論壇版的文章，標題改為〈「主席叫我咬誰就咬誰」〉，作者是「牧民 自由撰稿人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指李柱銘文章強調法治堅持一國兩制原本解釋-曾對國安法表示擔心&quot;&gt;楊清奇指李柱銘文章強調法治、堅持一國兩制原本解釋 曾對國安法表示擔心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊清奇指李柱銘本來在《壹週刊》有專欄，但《壹週刊》不再出版實體版之後，陳沛敏便告訴他，李連同另外3個作家的專欄會轉移到《蘋果》論壇版，惟他不知道背後由誰決定。而李的專欄文章每逢星期三刊出，直至《蘋果》停運。控方遂展示刊出於2020年5月20日，由李柱銘撰寫的文章，題為〈法治興亡 匹夫有責〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊指在2019至2021年期間，李柱銘的寫作角度是「比較強調法治」，「而且係比較堅持一國兩制原本嘅解釋，佢曾經係基本法起草委員會成員。」楊又指：「我印象中，佢對《國安法》係表示過擔心嘅」，不過相關文章實在太多，所以記不起細節。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊早前證供指黎智英、陳沛敏和他曾經於2016年討論過《蘋果》論壇版的作者名單，他今在庭上表示醒起李柱銘出現在當時的名單上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指胡志偉寫作角度支持抗爭支持制裁林鄭&quot;&gt;楊清奇指胡志偉寫作角度「支持抗爭，支持制裁林鄭」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示時任民主黨主席胡志偉的文章〈中港走回文革與冷戰之路〉，刊登日期為2020年5月28日。楊指胡是自由撰稿人，有時他會自己投稿，有時則是由他邀請胡撰文，就一些新聞作出回應，而這篇文章是胡投稿的。被問到胡的寫作角度，楊指：「佢係支持抗爭，支持制裁林鄭嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指上述胡志偉文章的網上版有一張美術設計圖，可見國家主席習近平一臉猙獰，雙手正在摧毀地球，上面有香港的地圖。圖上引述文篇內容：「『習近平新獨裁時代』只是錯判形勢，只會將香港與中國拉回文革與冷戰的回頭路，內鬥外戰可達數十年計，人命經濟損失難以估算。」楊指這幅圖片是他當時找美術組同事畫的。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 胡志偉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任總編輯羅偉光與楊清奇之間的訊息紀錄顯示，羅於2020年11月18日轉發胡志偉的文章檔案給楊，並指這是胡的離職感言。楊庭上表示當時胡仍然是立法會議員，有份審理初選案的法官李運騰聞言問，在2020年11月18日的時候，胡志偉是否仍然擔任立法會議員。楊其後表示不肯定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安法生效後宣布擱筆-楊清奇指古德明對獨裁政治侵犯人權比較批判&quot;&gt;國安法生效後宣布擱筆 楊清奇指古德明對獨裁政治、侵犯人權比較批判&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另提及專欄作家古德明，他在2020年7月6日發表文章〈「國安法」下，唯有擱筆〉。楊指古除了替《蘋果》論壇版撰文之外，也有為副刊寫專欄文章，但是他宣布「擱筆」之後，就沒有再替論壇版撰文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方同樣問及古德明的寫作角度，楊形容：「佢嘅文章係比較特別，通常係以古諷今，咁對獨裁政治、對於侵犯人權事件都係比較批判嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示新聞工作者林海於2020年9月1日刊登於《蘋果》論壇版的文章，題為〈兩個8.31〉，是關於2019年8月31日太子站事件及2014年8月31日全國人大常委會通過「8.31決定」，就普選方案「落閘」。楊表示最初邀請林海撰文的人是他自己，林是自由撰稿人，大約每一至兩星期撰文一次。至於林的寫作角度，楊形容：「都係支持抗爭，同埋支持制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示台灣學者林宗弦（Lin Thung Hong）的文章〈攬炒港人，北京輸掉全世界？〉，以黎智英被警察帶走的新聞相片作為配圖，刊登在台灣《蘋果》網站。該文章其後被翻譯成英文，並在香港《蘋果》英文版刊登。楊指林宗弦並沒有替香港《蘋果》的論壇版撰寫過文章。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;楊清奇指黎智英慷慨向員工派股票 但用人「殘忍」頻換高層&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;楊清奇指專欄文「擦邊」避國安法 例如諷刺官說不怕制裁如「夜行吹哨」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tpCpgod.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（7日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第40日審訊，繼續由前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。他解釋遵從黎智英指示是因為對方是個「慷慨又殘忍」的老闆，黎在蘋果股票上市時會向員工派股票，令早前部分高層成為「千萬、億萬富翁」，但若黎認為員工不合心意，「好快就換人」，他任職23年期間，單是社長和總編輯已各換7至8人。他又指示黎智英對新聞要求是「求新求變」，最簡單直接的方法，就是「換人去做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊清奇提及黎智英與其他高層有時會就論壇版專欄作家名單變動提出建議。法官李運騰問及黎在《蘋果》有否職位，楊表示沒有，他解釋仍聽從指示的原因，是印象中「黎先生係個慷慨老闆，又係一個殘忍嘅老闆」，說是「慷慨」是因為蘋果在股票上市和分拆網上版時，黎向員工派股票，「造就咗早期一啲高層管理層，成為千萬富翁，或億萬富翁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;搖大樹換人-想留在蘋果須做好本份&quot;&gt;「搖大樹」換人 想留在蘋果須做好本份&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊表示形容黎智英「殘忍」是「誇張咗啲，但佢用人用到盡嘅」，若遇到員工「唔啱佢心意，好快就換人」，在他任職《蘋果》23年期，他記得總編緝換了7至8個人，社長亦相同。楊又指黎智英對新聞要求是「求新求變」，最簡單直方式是「換人去做」，又指黎智英會用「搖大樹」方法換人，若想在留在《蘋果》工作，必須聽從老闆指示，主動做好手頭工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就論壇版的文章，楊清奇確認分兩類，一類是「專欄作家」定期供稿，另一類是「自由撰稿人」。專欄作家有戴耀廷、李柱銘、Simon Lee、盧峯（馮偉光）、古立、劉細良、古德明、錢志健、安裕、潘小濤、蔡子強等。在2019年後，海外人士朱牧民、羅冠聰和旅美作家「一劍飄塵」等人亦有為《蘋果》供稿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李官不明控方為何不停兜圈旁敲&quot;&gt;李官不明控方為何不停兜圈旁敲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤向楊展示多張他與其他《蘋果》高層的 WhatsApp 對話，內容提及如何安排刊登朱牧民和羅冠聰的文章，又提及他負責的周六「每周熱話」專題版如何選材。張卓勤問楊，黎智英有沒有指示專題版內容需要與暴動、示威或制裁有關。辯方反對問題，法官李運騰同意問題具引導性，指控方若有黎智英指示楊的 WhatsApp 截圖，何不直接出示，不解控方為何不停兜圈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張卓勤稱是希望法官能更「熟悉」論壇版的事件，李官直接向楊問，在2019年至2021年期間，就版面選材事宜，有否曾收到高層指示。楊清奇顯出不耐煩，說：「你個問題，我𢲷到頭都爆」，因為控方不停考他記憶。張卓勤改問一個發生2019年12月24日的 WhatsApp 對話，一個關於「林鄭向落選區議員派公職」的周六專題，是否由高層指示撰寫，楊表示該專題是他和同事決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊不滿問題考記憶-笑謂背唐詩宋詞更易&quot;&gt;楊不滿問題考記憶 笑謂背唐詩宋詞更易&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官插問，在2019至2021年期間的周六專題，其中有否由高層指示題材？楊清奇謂道：「又係考記憶力嘅問題，我背幾百首唐詩宋詞畀你仲易。」他續指，專題選材是「互動」的，有時由他提出建議，有時由同事食飯傾計時提出，不過議題大多包括最熱門的話題，就當時而言，制裁、社會事件和《國安法》都會包括在內。他又補充自己未曾被要求更改主題，認為反映選材符合黎智英的要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後觸及在《國安法》實施後，他負責的論壇版在選材和挑選投稿時有否改變運作方式。楊清奇表示沒有收到黎智英的指示要求改變《蘋果》立場，他認為意思是繼續支持制裁，他個人撰寫的評論保持相同立場。但由於任何人公開呼籲制裁，將會觸犯《國安法》，「作為一個編緝，唔想佢觸犯《國安法》，又要保持原本立場，咁喺寫作時要作出啲變化」，即改成「打擦邊球」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;擦邊球翻譯一度惹來笑聲&quot;&gt;「擦邊球」翻譯一度惹來笑聲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他解釋不論在寫作和挑選文章，他都不再公開呼籲制裁，但會通過評論裁制事件，分析「下一個制裁方法嚴重性」，他認為可以表示繼續表達出支持制裁的立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於挑選「公開投稿」的標準，楊清奇表示要視乎文章能否回應社會事件或政治新聞，亦要判斷文章是否符合《蘋果》讀者的口味，例如支持反修例運動和支持制裁。他認為黎智英撰寫的專欄文章持相同觀點，並視之為他寫稿的「指引」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「擦邊球」的翻釋，庭上發生一段小插曲，出身葡籍法律世家的李素蘭法官不理解「擦邊球」意思，更一度反問：「ball?」楊清奇表示可以簡單概括，《國安法》畫的紅線（red line）「大家當時都係估估下，我打出呢個波，又唔想打出界變成犯法（go beyond the line）」，於是他就打在邊界上（land at the line），舉例網球、羽毛球也有邊界位。李運騰法官其後提議可意譯做「skirt the line（擦邊）」或「playing in grey area（遊走在灰色地帶）」，楊認同意思正確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AEk7y6K.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】蘋果案第40日審訊，下午續審，《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇續以「從犯證人」作供，他提及多名專欄作者的寫作立場，例如戴耀廷在2019年時支持抗爭，其後發動初選；區家麟對國安法持批評態度；李怡的政治取向「激進」，從支持抗爭和反對《國安法》，其觀點都非常鮮明，甚至在《國安法》實施後仍在評論文章支持制裁。法官李運騰質疑，為何他容許刊登支持制裁的文章，楊表示李怡用「擦邊球」方式，例如諷刺被制裁的中港官員，聲稱不怕制裁，卻如「夜行人吹口哨」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表控方的助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤向楊清奇展示他與陳沛敏的 WhatsApp 對話，其中一句提及「聖旨」一詞，張卓勤問是代表黎智英指示論壇版的主題，楊清奇表示不是，主題通常在逢周二的策劃會決定。他又指專欄寫手有如「專家」，有自己的立場，通常他不會定出角度，而是「由佢哋發揮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英讚區家麟評論文章好&quot;&gt;黎智英讚區家麟評論文章好&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張卓勤轉為問資深傳媒人區家麟與《蘋果》的關係，並展示2020年4月19日的一個對話截圖，黎智英稱讚「李平，區家麟文章好，請考慮邀寫評論版，謝謝。黎」。楊清奇表示區家麟本來已是副刊版的其中一名專欄作家，黎智英意思是邀請區再在A疊的論壇版再寫文章。他相信黎智英看中區家麟的文筆流暢，加上對《國安法》持批評態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mlSVSLu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 區家麟&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示區家麟數篇撰寫的評論，包括〈摧毀即貫幑 攬炒即繁榮〉，〈2020香港新詞〉、〈穿官袍戴假髮演一台爛戲〉、〈「煽動」作為一種法律武器〉。張卓勤稱，似乎大部份區的文章都獲得版面上方位置，是否有任何特別含意，楊表示很難一概而論，要視乎文章當日「質量」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷2021年初停供稿&quot;&gt;戴耀廷2021年初停供稿&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於戴耀廷，楊表示在他接手論壇版前，戴已經是《蘋果》的專欄作家，他不知道最初由誰邀請戴寫文章。張卓勤問戴耀廷寫文角度是什麼，楊表示戴在2019年「主要支持抗爭嘅」，後來他「發動咗初選」，撰寫多篇文章都與初選有關。在2021年1月15日，他獲時任執行總編林文宗告之，戴暫時不能為論壇版供稿，他估計是戴當時因為初選案被捕，他透過港聞記者轉達。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IJlQlWK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再問有關李怡的政治立場，楊表示李怡「政治取向係激進啲，從支持抗爭，到反對《國安法》，佢嘅觀點都好鮮明嘅」，他又形容李怡是一名資深評論員，且「黎先生好欣賞佢嘅」。他又指李怡即使在《國安法》實施後，文章的取態仍是支持制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指新冠是中共史上最大挑戰&quot;&gt;黎智英指新冠是中共史上最大挑戰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰質疑，為何楊清奇容許支持制裁的文章刊登在《蘋果》？楊表示李怡寫文章的手法是「打擦邊球」，例如一篇題為「夜行人吹口哨」的文章，李怡諷刺被制裁的中港官員，他們覺得自己不怕制裁，但就如夜行人吹口哨。李官問道，這就是他認為是「擦邊球」原因？楊確認是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RSgyd0I.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李怡（已歿）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示一段黎智英向楊清奇傳送的一段長訊息，黎提及自己對 COVID-19 的看法，他表示「這可能是中共有史以來最大的挑戰」，提及「武漢 coronavirus 事件」引起人們對中共的恐慌，「只相信無論政府說什麼都是假的，沒有說的才是真實，那種無助感使人向最壞處想像，原本可控制的最後都失控，都只因為失信」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方叫楊清奇演譯黎智英想法-法官感驚訝&quot;&gt;控方叫楊清奇演譯黎智英想法 法官感驚訝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張卓勤問楊清奇，黎智英用「武漢 coronavirus」一詞，是否反映黎對事件看法，法官李素蘭驚訝表示控方怎可以這樣提問，張即尷尬示意「可能是因為下午（maybe because of afteroon）」，改為問其後見報版本，有沒有任何修改，楊清奇表示黎智英在其撰寫的評論曾用「武漢冠狀病毒流感」一詞，不過楊認為意思重複，故他刪去「流感」兩字，後來基本上《蘋果日報》都採用「武漢肺炎」一詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is in China’s crosshairs. As the Russia–Ukraine War in Eastern Europe and the Israel–Gaza War in West Asia enter their respective endgames, the inevitable question that arises is: “Where will the next war be?” If Taiwan comes to mind, think again. The second China–India War will most likely be fought in Eastern Ladakh in India’s far northwest region sometime between 2025 and 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastern Ladakh refers to the area of the Indian union territory of Ladakh currently under the administrative control of the Government of India that lies east of the Indus River and west of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that separates it from the Aksai Chin area of Ladakh, held by Beijing since the first China-India War of 1962. Eastern Ladakh is of critical geostrategic importance for China and India from the perspective of each country’s vital national interests. The driver for China is energy security, while for India it is territorial integrity. The 2025–2030 timeframe represents the optimum window of opportunity for China and the maximum period of vulnerability for India, reflecting the significant asymmetric balance of power in favour of China. Absent a modus vivendi between these two nuclear-armed adversaries, conventional war (and the spectre of nuclear war) will be impossible to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;through-chinese-spectacles&quot;&gt;Through Chinese Spectacles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing views Eastern Ladakh through the lens of energy security. China’s political, economic and military power is inextricably intertwined with its energy security, given its heavy dependence on oil and gas imports. Eastern Ladakh is the only pathway from which a hostile power can launch an attack to invade and occupy Kashgar, China’s crucial energy entrepot in the far Western province of Xinjiang. A vital pillar of China’s energy security is the planned land-based pipeline connecting Iran’s oil and gas fields to Kashgar, transiting through Pakistan via the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). As the US Department of Defense (DoD) notes in its 2023 annual report on China, “through … projects associated with pipelines and port construction in Pakistan, it [China] seeks to become less reliant on transporting energy resources through strategic choke points, such as the Strait of Malacca”. The planned route of CPEC runs from the port city of Gwadar near the Pakistan–Iran border through the key city of Gilgit in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (also claimed by India) to the Khunjerab Pass, which is the sole transit point connecting Pakistan with China’s Kashgar terminus. It is likely to take at least a decade to complete the energy pipeline, by which time the DoD’s report suggests that China will no longer be dependent on maritime routes for its energy imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The harsh reality India faces is that for the foreseeable future, there will continue to be an asymmetric balance of power in favour of China&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China’s energy security is to rely on land-based oil and gas pipelines connecting friendly energy producers to China, the pipelines must be outside the effective military reach of hostile powers. According to the DoD’s China report, the critical first phase of Beijing’s three-phase military modernisation programme is expected to be completed by 2027. From a military perspective, the most logical land route to seize Kashgar would be to march an expeditionary force along the road which runs from Kargil, on the Line of Control with Pakistan near the west bank of the Indus River in the Indian union territory of Ladakh, and cross into Pakistan-held Kashmir, proceeding via Skardu to Gilgit and then following the road connecting Gilgit to the Khunjerab Pass. Essentially, the invasion route would run through Pakistan-administered Kashmir, over which India claims sovereignty as the area was part of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir when it acceded to India in October 1947. The only way China can prevent such a possible attack would be to pre-emptively wrest control of a strategically significant portion of Eastern Ladakh from India and to annex the seized territory and incorporate it into Aksai Chin. China’s success in encroaching on Indian-held positions along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh in May–June 2020, which incrementally nudged the LAC westward, is a preview of Beijing’s intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;through-an-indian-veil&quot;&gt;Through an Indian Veil&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s perspective with respect to Eastern Ladakh is difficult to discern because it is shrouded in a veil weaved with strands of rhetorical posturing and cautious action. The official map of the union territory of Ladakh depicts the geographic scope of the claims asserted by India. The map is imaginary because it fails to reflect the actual facts on the ground that limit the area under India’s control. Moreover, the LAC exists purely in the eyes of the beholder, as it is not demarcated. The Indian government has not publicly published its perception of the LAC. India has made no attempt to recover Aksai Chin since the area was lost to China in 1962. Likewise, India has made no attempt to evict Chinese forces from the incremental encroachments in 2020 that were designed to shift the LAC westwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The harsh reality India faces is that for the foreseeable future, there will continue to be an asymmetric balance of power in favour of China. India is dependent on Russia for a majority of its imports of military equipment – a position that has prevailed for over half a century. In a war with China, India will not be able to rely on a military equipment lifeline from Moscow, given Russia’s growing dependence on China for its economic security. Moreover, reflecting the heavy burden of providing a continuous flow of military equipment and supplies to support Ukraine and Israel in their respective wars against Russia and Gaza, the US is unlikely to have the capacity to meet urgent Indian military requirements in the case of a war with China. The embryonic India–US strategic partnership is not expected to develop into a bilateral military security pact within the 2025–2030 timeframe. Crafting a pathway from mutually assured destruction to mutually assured survival is the ultimate challenge confronting New Delhi and Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;楊清奇呻遭顏純鈎投訴、張劍虹要求停盧峯專欄兼「當住同事面鬧我」&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;楊清奇指黎智英冀論壇版多元化 推薦建制派撰文 惟2018年後轉推薦激進作者&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LbgPOEV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（6日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第39日審訊。控方傳召前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。楊指時任社長張劍虹要求暫停盧峯（馮偉光）的論壇版專欄，惟楊稱：「我唔係咁同意嘅。」楊又在庭上大呻，指張劍虹「後來仲叫我去佢辦公室，當住同事面鬧我嘅，嗰時就知道投訴嗰個人就係顏純鈎」。楊提到黎智英很欣賞顏純鈎，因此張劍虹重視顏的文章，因而要中止盧峯的專欄。楊指張後來安排顏所撰寫的《蘋果》社論數目，由每星期一篇增加至兩篇，加上張覺得楊「唔聽話」，所以將顏的專欄文章放在副刊，而不需要經楊管理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇（筆名李平）第三天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤先作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;群組國安法應變委員會截圖顯示-林文宗移除被捕高層&quot;&gt;群組「國安法應變委員會」截圖顯示 林文宗移除被捕高層&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到2021年6月17日，時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹等人被警方拘捕，而楊則於同月23日才被拘捕。控方展示「國安法應變委員會」的 Signal 群組截圖，顯示時任執行總編輯林文宗在6月17日移除了4人，包括時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹、副社長陳沛敏、總編輯羅偉光和動新聞平台總監張志偉，而該截圖是警方從楊的手機中發現。控方問楊為何會截圖，楊表示不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又指，群組本來是在另一通訊軟件 WhatsApp ，成員包括高層和不同部門的主管，至於群組何時、為何移動至 Signal 則不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，楊的手機另外儲存了一張黎的訊息截圖，內容是「李平兄，以律師談過每月從我私人戶口支付一萬天（元）給我作為供 Twitter 報酬小心些是可以的，我將每月安排付款給你。謝謝。」控方問到楊為何會替此訊息截圖，楊則指他曾經刪除與黎之間的訊息，「咁為咗方便睇返之前嘅訊息」，因為「嗰時覺得呢樣嘢有啲用」，所以便截圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指黎智英不只一次將讀者來信轉交給他&quot;&gt;楊清奇指黎智英不只一次將讀者來信轉交給他&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示一封寄給黎智英的來信，信件是一篇手寫文章，題為「簡談習近平執政以來的風格」，欲投稿至「蘋果論壇」，署名是「自由撰稿人趙小華」。信件並附上黎手寫的便利貼，寫有「李平，我沒看過他的文章，請過目看是否有用，謝」。文章形容「中共邪惡政權」所發出的號角是「如此肆無忌憚」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊指黎透過秘書將該信件轉交給他，並確認後來有安排文章刊登在論壇版，但是他並未有通知黎，「因為佢睇報紙睇得好實嘅，如果有登，佢會睇到」，所以不需要通知黎。楊又指黎不只一次將來信轉交給他，不過頻率「好少嘅」，如果他閱畢文章覺得沒有問題，便會安排刊登。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示另一封由讀者撰寫的來信，日期是2020年8月15日，附上黎手寫的便利貼：「李平，此讀者有關評論版意（見）值得參考！」楊指，這封信是黎交給他的，不過他認為「不論黎先生又好，個讀者又好，都係混淆咗一啲嘢嘅」，因信中提及的作者都是副刊專欄的作者，「我覺得佢講緊嘅唔係我嘅論壇版」，惟黎認為該讀者是談論「評論版」，因而轉交給他，所以他不知道該讀者意見是針對副刊還是論壇版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指台蘋支持香港人抗爭及呼籲國際社會關注&quot;&gt;楊清奇指台蘋支持香港人抗爭及呼籲國際社會關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示張劍虹與楊清奇之間的訊息，張在2019年8月1日說：「台蘋論壇也找到一些逆權運動的不錯文章，我們也可以採用。我已經請台蘋社長跟偉光聯絡。請跟進」、「非常時期，有好文章多點版位也有需要。請文宗加人給你便可。謝謝」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊表示，張劍虹當時傳送上述訊息給他之前，其實他與羅偉光經已溝通過。他又呻：「論壇版係《蘋果》最細嘅部門，得我同另外一個同事，每日一個版已經係好辛苦」，因此張劍虹指如果要加版數便要增加人手，「不過好遺憾啦，張劍虹先生未睇過篇文章，就話有好文章就話要出。」楊又指林文宗並未有增加人手，因此論壇版一直都是每日一版，以及只有兩名編輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及台灣《蘋果》的觀點，楊指：「一個係支持香港市民嘅抗爭，一個係呼籲國際社會關注。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇稱會議較少談及論壇版-若黎智英或高層有指示必須聽從&quot;&gt;楊清奇稱會議較少談及論壇版 若黎智英或高層有指示必須聽從&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方談及《蘋果》日常運作的三個會議，包括「初會」、「鋤報會」、「編前會」，惟楊指他不一定每天出席三個會議。他又指理論上「鋤報會」上會談及所有版位，「但大家都知道論壇版係相對獨立嘅個人意見，所以鋤報會好少有人會去『鋤』論壇版嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於每週舉行一次的「Planning會」，楊指是大家討論未來一星期的新聞如何籌劃，即使他未有出席該會議，他也會 WhatsApp 陳沛敏或林文宗以尋求指示。但事實上會議很少討論論壇版，楊指他會報告星期六論壇版有什麼主題，基本上他很少聽過其他部門主管給予意見，有時高層會給他指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/H7oeDTq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊指，如果黎智英有指示的話，社長張劍虹、副社長陳沛敏、總編輯羅偉光或執行總編輯林文宗便會在會議中轉達。控方問黎的指示是什麼，楊則稱「唔記得」，但是「如果佢有指示，我會跟嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又指，對於上級的指示「我係要聽嘅」，有時他提出論壇版專題，高層會提議一些相關作者，但此情況很少見，因為楊通常會自行找作者撰寫文章。他指由於好少有4名高層同時給予指示，或者各人給予不同的指示，所以他不會覺得執行上有困難。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指林本利曾短暫撰寫蘋果社論-後來自行決定不寫&quot;&gt;楊清奇指林本利曾短暫撰寫《蘋果》社論 後來自行決定不寫&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2019至2021年期間的《蘋果》社論，楊供稱共有4名作者，包括馮偉光（筆名盧峯）、楊懷康（筆名古立）、顏純鈎（筆名方圓）和他本人（筆名李平）。社論作者人選方面，「最後決定係黎先生。但如果係推薦寫手嘅話，張劍虹和陳沛敏都有推薦嘅權嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊指，除了上述4人之外，專欄作家林本利亦曾經短時間替《蘋果》寫社論，「佢離開嘅時候係張先生話畀我知嘅。」他指當初是張劍虹聯絡林本利撰寫「蘋論」，後來林本利自己決定不再撰寫。被問到林本利寫哪一種題材居多，楊則指「蘋論」沒有限制界別，會涉及政治、經濟和社會的題材。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇呻被顏純鈎投訴-之後被張劍虹當住同事面鬧我&quot;&gt;楊清奇呻被顏純鈎投訴 之後被張劍虹「當住同事面鬧我」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年4月12日，張劍虹向楊清奇傳送訊息，提及「主筆，有論壇作者指我們有時壓稿。我明白或許有時稿擠，但盧峯每週已經寫兩篇社論，或許就不用寫論壇。謝謝」。楊指盧峯當時離開了《蘋果》，是以自由撰稿人的身份撰文，後來他在2020年6月重返《蘋果》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及誰人決定盧峯不用寫專欄。楊則指：「呢個係張劍虹先生畀我嘅訊息，佢係要求我停咗盧峯嘅論壇，我唔係咁同意嘅，所以我話會同作者多溝通，我記得後來我都冇停咗盧峯嘅專欄。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jM1fcmM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果日報》英文版主筆馮偉光，筆名「盧峯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊繼而大吐苦水，因為張的訊息指有人投訴楊沒有用到作者的稿，「佢（張劍虹）後來仲叫我去佢辦公室，當住同事面鬧我嘅。嗰時就知道投訴嗰個人就係顏純鈎。」楊又指黎智英之所以讓顏撰寫社論，是因為顏自己投稿，惟「我係冇應承畀佢開專欄出嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇黎智英好欣賞顏純鈎-故張劍虹重視其文章&quot;&gt;楊清奇：黎智英好欣賞顏純鈎 故張劍虹重視其文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰此時打斷，指楊的證供十分有趣，但是有需要澄清一些事實，控方的問題是問誰人決定暫停盧峯的專欄，究竟是張劍虹的決定，還是張僅負責轉達相關相定？楊則回答他當時理解是張劍虹的決定，「但後來知道顏純鈎投訴咁緊張，因為黎生好欣賞顏純鈎，所以張劍虹就重視顏純鈎嘅文章，所以要停咗盧峯文章。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到何以得知黎欣賞顏純鈎，楊則指張劍虹後來告訴他，決定將顏所撰寫的「蘋論」，由每星期一篇，增加至每星期兩篇，「佢（張劍虹）覺得我唔聽話啦，所以將顏純鈎嘅文章擺喺副刊，而冇擺喺專欄。」換言之，顏除了每週寫兩篇《蘋果》社論之外，還會在副刊撰寫專欄文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何楊被指「唔聽話」，楊表示：「因為我冇聽佢指示停咗盧峯嘅論壇版專欄。」他其後補充，雖然盧峯的固定專欄後來停了，但他會不定期刊登盧峯的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（6日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第39日審訊。控方傳召前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。楊的職責之一是管理報紙論壇版，他稱選擇文章的主要原則有3點，包括「支持政治上的民主」、「支持經濟上的市場化」和「不支持港獨」。楊提到黎智英要求論壇版「求新求變」，所以在2016年初曾經討論更換作者群。楊當時看過黎推薦的作者名單，「我和同事都好吃驚啦，有幾個係建制派嘅人物嚟嘅」，當中包括兩名行政會議成員，反映黎希望多元化。惟楊認為黎在2018年起轉趨激進，他此後推薦的評論作者「立場都係比較激進」，並舉例指黎推薦過傳媒人區家麟和「一劍飄塵」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇（筆名李平）第三天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤先作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指盧峯立場是支持抗爭-與黎智英觀點一致&quot;&gt;楊清奇指盧峯立場是「支持抗爭」 與黎智英觀點一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊清奇在上午的證供中提及，時任社長張劍虹要求中止盧峯（馮偉光）的論壇版專欄，並將顏純鈎的專欄調至副刊，不經楊的論壇版管轄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午問及盧峯的寫作角度，楊表示「作為（《蘋果》社論）寫手，我哋都明白，要跟從報館嘅基本立場，啫係要留意黎智英先生嘅立場」，因此在2019年反修例期間，《蘋果》社論作者的觀點和立場都是沒有分別，「都係支持抗爭，要求政府收回條例」，而這觀點與黎的專欄所表達鼓勵市民上街抗爭是一致的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇社論稱誓必和勇一家香港國際聯線抗爭到底&quot;&gt;楊清奇社論稱「誓必和勇一家，香港國際聯線，抗爭到底」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向楊清奇展示4篇由他撰寫的《蘋果》社論。首篇題為〈蘋論：林鄭反議會 市民反黑警 誓不兩立〉，刊登日期為2020年5月12日。文中提到：「如今漢賊誓不兩立，港人不會跪低，不會偏安，誓必和勇一家，香港國際聯線，抗爭到底。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊解釋，「漢賊」是傳統中國文化的一個用詞，一般是指兩邊對立的雙方，他理解為「一邊係提出修例嘅政府，另一邊係反對修例嘅市民」，而「誓必和勇一家」是指「和理非」及「勇武」一起合作。至於「香港國際聯線」，楊指意思是「香港都係要爭取國際社會嘅支持」，以使到政府收回修訂條例。楊並確認，黎智英在其個人專欄的觀點與他差不多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方特別提到社論最後一句：「至於中共港共想攬炒，那就放馬過來吧。」控方問楊這句是什麼意思。楊則說：「我覺得文字已經好清楚㗎喇，冇嘢補充。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰關注以上社論刊登日期是2020年5月，其時「撤回修例」是否仍是社會爭議的話題。楊指市民仍在爭取「五大訴求」，當中包括「撤回修例」。控方問到當時的社會環境是如何，楊指示威「減少咗好多」，主要原因是疫情，而且2019年區議會選舉之後，市民的焦點轉移至2020年立法會選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇社論倡對中共採取強有力的制裁-免繼續禍港禍全球&quot;&gt;楊清奇社論倡對中共採取「強有力的制裁」 免「繼續禍港禍全球」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月26日的《蘋果》社論，題為〈蘋論：播毒殺港 中共邪惡 世界埋單〉。楊指文章主要內容是新冠病毒在全球造成很多傷亡，《國安法》即將立法，可能摧毀香港民主自由，「全世界都要為此埋單，付出代價。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到文中提及：「無畏無懼的香港人已挺身而出，反抗強權，如果民主世界還止步於口頭聲援，不在政治、經濟、軍事上對中共採取強有力的制裁，何異於讓真正的人類公敵、千古罪人繼續禍港禍全球？」楊確認這段反映他對制裁的觀點，也反映了《蘋果》和黎智英的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇社論諷刺中共反制裁無威懾力&quot;&gt;楊清奇社論諷刺中共反制裁無威懾力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月14日的《蘋果》社論，題為〈蘋論：中共的打壓與制裁不足畏〉。楊指文章主要內容是「諷刺中共嘅反制裁係冇力嘅」，因為他認為中共的反制裁「唔會嚇親制裁嘅對象，冇威懾力嘅」，並指可以參考副標題「不以為懼，反以為榮」以下的段落。楊確認文章反映到《蘋果》和黎智英的觀點，因黎的專欄文章曾經提及類似觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;楊清奇指中國官媒刪除李克強指示-令人質疑隱瞞疫情&quot;&gt;楊清奇指中國官媒刪除李克強指示 令人質疑隱瞞疫情&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2021年1月15日的《蘋果》社論，題為〈蘋論：政府目標是武肺清零還是自由清零？〉，楊指文章主要內容是質疑政府的監督，「係為咗防疫，還是限制市民自由？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又指副標題「官媒剋扣李克強指示」以下的段落亦有提及，「因為中國官方嘅媒體都刪除咗李克強嘅指示，咁令人懷疑中國係咪真係有隱瞞疫情嘅」，所以他在文章中質疑，「類似武漢式嘅封城係冇用嘅，咁香港繼續用封城式嘅方法，咁有用定係冇用呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊早前證供提及黎希望找一些作者寫中共高層權鬥內幕，他表示雖然文章並未講到中共權鬥，但是以中國而言，有權刪除時任總理李克強講話的人，就只有中共總書記習近平。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇稱不記得撰文時有否想起黎智英指示-有時乃有感而發&quot;&gt;楊清奇稱不記得撰文時有否想起黎智英指示 有時乃「有感而發」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指楊撰寫文章的時候，黎已經正在還柙，問他為何會把黎的觀點寫出來。楊重申：「其實作為一個評論嘅寫手，寫稿嘅時候一定要考慮報館同埋老闆嘅立場，唔係次次去諗老闆有咩指示我去寫啲乜，有時係有感而發，因為始終都係有署名喺度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問楊當時是否仍然視黎為老闆，楊表示：「係，黎先生仲係老闆嘅，但係我嗰時唔記得我係咪諗起老闆嘅指示先會咁寫嘅。」控方再問，黎提及中共權鬥內幕的指示，距離楊撰寫社論的時候有數個月，為何仍然會在社論中提及權鬥？楊僅表示：「我已經講咗喇，我寫嘅時候唔記得有冇諗起黎先生嘅指示」，他補充，他可能看到中國媒體刪除李克強的指示，有感而發而寫出來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問楊會否閱讀其他人撰寫的社論，楊回答：「有時會嘅」，之後補充：「因為有啲文章睇咗標題，就唔想睇嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指黎智英要求論壇版求新求變-曾討論更換作者群&quot;&gt;楊清奇指黎智英要求論壇版「求新求變」 曾討論更換作者群&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊早前供稱，他的職責除了撰寫《蘋果》社論外，還有管理論壇版。控方問楊揀選文章的準則是什麼。楊指他在大約2014年5月開始接手負責《蘋果》論壇版，至2015年年底晉升為《蘋果》主筆。他指同事與他交接論壇版工作時，選擇文章的主要原則只有3點，包括「支持政治上的民主」、「支持經濟上的市場化」和「不支持港獨」，因此論壇版是比較開放。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊續指，他接手論壇版之後，黎智英當時要求論壇版「求新求變」，要不時更換作者群，故此黎和當時的總編輯陳沛敏曾經跟他一起討論作者名單。楊指該名單列舉出一些作者，包括一些他們希望去邀請的作者，也有一些是陳沛敏提議的作者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指黎智英推薦作者名單包括建制派人物-同事感吃驚&quot;&gt;楊清奇指黎智英推薦作者名單包括建制派人物 同事感吃驚&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊憶述他在2016年初開始熟悉論壇版運作後，便按照黎的指示更換作者人選，他提到當時看過黎推薦的作者名單，「我和同事都好吃驚啦，有幾個係建制派嘅人物嚟嘅。我記得好清楚，有兩個應該係行政會議成員嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊表示，從黎的推薦作者名單來看，「我覺得佢仍然希望論壇版係多元化嘅。反而我和同事就覺得，會唔會天真咗啲？」，「因為呢啲建制派領袖人物呢，冇可能同我哋寫稿。」楊和同事當時曾嘗試邀請這些建制派，但是都不成功，黎則表示只有其中一個人跟他「傾到計」，黎亦有親自邀請該人士，但最終不成功。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到2016年的時候，論壇版作者的寫作角度是怎樣，楊指「簡單講就係符合我之前講嘅原則」。他提到，大約2016至2017年時，仍然有建制派領袖人物替《蘋果》撰寫評論文章，雖然這些撰文的建制派領袖人物「係好少嘅」，「但都唔會好似2019年之後咁完全冇立法會議員。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊引述自己早前的證供，他認為黎智英在2018年起轉變立場，變得激進和尖銳，所以此後黎推薦的評論作者「立場都係比較激進」。楊舉例指黎曾推薦過傳媒人區家麟和「一劍飄塵」。&lt;/p&gt;

Absent urgent changes, the United States risks weakening deterrence and undermining its warfighting capabilities against China and other competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. defense industrial base — including the executive branch, Congress, and defense companies — lacks the capacity, responsiveness, flexibility, and surge capability to meet the U.S. military’s production needs as China ramps up defense industrial production. Unless there are urgent changes, the United States risks weakening deterrence and undermining its warfighting capabilities against China and other competitors. A significant part of the problem is that the U.S. defense ecosystem remains on a peacetime footing, despite a protracted war in Ukraine, an active war in the Middle East, and growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific in such areas as the Taiwan Strait and Korean Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States faces several acute challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Chinese defense industrial base is increasingly on a wartime footing and, in some areas, outpacing the U.S. defense industrial base. Most open-source research and analysis on the U.S. defense industrial base has been conducted in a vacuum and has not systematically assessed China’s defense industrial base. Chinese defense companies, such as China North Industries Group Corporation Limited and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, are producing a growing quantity and quality of land, maritime, air, space, and other capabilities. China increased its defense budget by 7.2 percent in 2024 and is heavily investing in munitions and acquiring high-end weapons systems and equipment five to six times faster than the United States, according to some U.S. government estimates. China is now the world’s largest shipbuilder and has a shipbuilding capacity that is roughly 230 times larger than the United States. One of China’s large shipyards, such as Jiangnan Shipyard, has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards combined, according to U.S. Navy estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the U.S. defense industrial base continues to face a range of production challenges, including a lack of urgency in revitalizing the defense industrial ecosystem. The U.S. Department of Defense has taken some helpful steps to strengthen the industrial base, such as developing a National Defense Industrial Strategy, increasing production for some weapons systems, and pushing for multiyear procurement. But there is still a shortfall of munitions and other weapons systems for a protracted war in such areas as the Indo-Pacific. Supply chain challenges also remain serious, and today’s workforce is inadequate to meet the demands of the defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the United States has not sufficiently leveraged its relationships with allies and partners, though it has taken some steps through such arrangements as the Australia–United Kingdom–United States (AUKUS) partnership. Nevertheless, there are too many bureaucratic hurdles and inefficiencies in the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), and other policies and procedures. Co-development, co-production, co-sustainment, and other forms of cooperation between the United States and its closest allies and partners have been stifled. While the current National Defense Strategy notes that U.S. defense strategy needs to be “anchored” in allies and partners, the United States has fallen short in defense industrial base cooperation with its friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple reasons for these challenges. One is that the U.S. defense industrial base is much bigger than any one agency or department. The Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Commerce, Department of the Treasury, Congress, the private sector, and other organizations play important roles in the industrial base. But they often have different interests and priorities. In addition, there is significant political and bureaucratic resistance to reforming the defense industrial base and broader defense ecosystem. Some areas of the executive and legislative branches remain too risk averse in sharing sensitive technology with allies and partners. Others mistakenly see a revitalization of the defense industrial base as giving money to greedy executives engaged in waste, fraud, and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the United States needs to take several steps to revitalize the defense industrial base and broader ecosystem in an increasingly dangerous world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White House–Led Initiative:&lt;/strong&gt; There is an urgent need for the U.S. president to create a body that provides strategic guidance and helps oversee a revitalization of the defense industrial base. Revitalization will not occur without White House leadership, as the history of the U.S. defense industrial base demonstrates. During major crises in U.S. history, such as World War II and the Cold War, presidential leadership was essential. Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, and others were pivotal in providing the leadership, strategic vision, organization, and funding to revitalize the defense industry. One option is a variant of the production boards that existed during the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. Such a body could be established by the U.S. president and exercise general direction over U.S. defense procurement and production; help determine the policies, plans, and procedures of federal departments regarding defense procurement, production, arms sales, and technology transfers; establish priorities in the distribution of materials and services; fix bureaucratic problems; incentivize industry; improve communication with industry; and, perhaps most importantly, provide a sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Spending:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States likely cannot revamp its defense industrial base without additional spending on the development and production of weapons systems necessary for deterrence and warfighting. During the Cold War, the U.S. defense budget was between 9 and 11 percent of GDP during the Eisenhower administration, between 8 and 9 percent during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and over 6 percent during the Reagan administration. Today’s defense budget of roughly 3 percent of GDP is not consistent with a security environment in which authoritarian states, such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, are threatening the United States and its allies and partners across the globe. Without an increase in funding for the development and production of weapons systems, it will be virtually impossible to revitalize the defense industrial base to compete with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiyear Contracting:&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense and Congress need to expand the use of multiyear procurement to create sustained demand signals that will promote investment in the defense industrial base. Congressional appropriators need to fund — and the military services need to spend — a wider range of munitions important for warfighting and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East. Multiyear procurement is important to build a consistent and predictable demand signal that creates more transparency and less risk for prime contractors and more fragile sub-tier suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Stockpiles:&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense and Congress should allocate additional funding for contracts and other incentives (such as tax incentives, regulatory relief, and long-term contracts) to build and maintain surge production capacity. This funding can be used to modernize and expand facilities and develop flexible production. The Department of Defense maintains stockpiles of key munitions, minerals, chemicals, technology, and medical supplies, but it needs to better manage inventory and stockpile planning to decrease near-term risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workforce and Supply Chains:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States needs to create the conditions that diversify the supplier base for the defense industry and invest in new production methods. The Department of Defense should look for opportunities to assist companies with upskilling and reskilling workers by offering incentives, such as expanding investments in the Manufacturing Innovation Institutes and in programs designed to support the talent necessary for defense-related manufacturing and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allies and Partners:&lt;/strong&gt; The White House — or a White House–appointed body — needs to focus increased attention on streamlining FMS and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) review policies and procedures, as well as support co-development, co-production, and other types of arrangements with allies and partners. The Department of Defense should develop a more efficient review process for releasing technology, accelerate acquisition and contracting assistance, and ensure broad U.S. government support to improve the FMS process. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, working with the services and military departments, should establish a rapid contracting process to reduce the backlog in getting approved FMS cases on contract. The administration should move quickly to put in place regulations that will provide broad exemptions for the United Kingdom and Australia, much like the United States has provided to Canada. In addition, the U.S. government should increase co-production, co-development, and other arrangements with key allies and partners in such areas as munitions, shipbuilding, and ground vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps are important to strengthen the U.S. defense industrial base in a competitive security environment. In his “Victory Speech” in December 1940, one year before Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt implored the nation to revitalize its defense industry. It is a message that is just as relevant today. “We must be the great arsenal of democracy,” Roosevelt said. “For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing international competition between&lt;/strong&gt; the United States and China, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, war in the Middle East, and increasing tensions on the Korean Peninsula have raised questions about the state of the U.S. defense industrial base. Does the United States have sufficient capacity and flexibility in its defense industrial base for deterrence and warfighting? If not, what else needs to be done? These questions are particularly important since the structure of the international system has changed over the past decade from one of unipolarity, where the United States had no major peers, to one centered on Washington and Beijing. In addition, military capabilities are rapidly evolving in such areas as robotics, sensors, artificial intelligence, cyber, space, long-range precision strike, hypersonics, and advanced communications, command, and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, the U.S. defense industrial base is adequate for today and tomorrow. As one U.S. Department of Defense report concludes, “the defense industry is financially healthy, and its financial health has improved over time.” Other analysts and policymakers contend that the United States’ capacity is more than sufficient to deter or win a war against another major power such as China. The United States enjoys significant economic and production advantages over its competitors, this argument goes, and “the overall picture is one of stability and health, not decline” in the defense industry. Others argue that the push to increase defense production is largely due to lobbying by defense companies, not military requirements. As one assessment concludes, increased investment in the defense industry “would require a permanent expansion of U.S. weapons manufacturing capability. And once the new factories exist, there will be pressure to keep them open in perpetuity, at a cost of untold billions of dollars.” Indeed, some see defense revitalization as wasting taxpayer money and increasing the possibility of waste, fraud, and abuse. Five U.S. senators — Bernie Sanders (D-VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Charles Grassley (R-IA), and Mike Braun (R-IN) — wrote in a letter to U.S. secretary of defense Lloyd Austin in May 2023 that some defense companies were “dramatically overcharging the Department and U.S. taxpayers while reaping enormous profits, seeing their stock prices soar, and handing out massive executive compensation packages.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-design&quot;&gt;Research Design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the U.S. defense industrial base, this report asks several questions: What is the state of China’s defense industrial base? In light of growing competition with China and other international contingencies, how prepared is the U.S. defense industrial base for deterrence and warfighting over the next five years? What steps should the United States take to establish a more effective defense industrial base?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, this report adopts a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods. It compiles and analyzes a range of data to better understand the U.S. and Chinese industrial bases, including in such areas as the defense sector and maritime, air, land, and missile capabilities. The report collects and analyzes other types of information, including White House–led defense bodies since World War II (such as the National Defense Advisory Committee and the War Production Board) and U.S defense spending as a percentage of GDP since World War II. The report also utilizes information from interviews with a wide range of individuals from the Department of Defense, Department of State, Congress (both members and staff), defense companies, and other subject-matter experts. Finally, this report incorporates qualitative information from both primary and secondary sources, including on the history of the U.S. defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The defense industrial base is a subset of the broader economy and includes the set of companies involved in the research, development, design, production, delivery, and maintenance of weapons systems.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As used here, the defense industrial base is a subset of the broader economy and includes the set of companies involved in the research, development, design, production, delivery, and maintenance of weapons systems. Defense is not a free market system. It is a monopsony, a market arrangement in which there are several suppliers but only one buyer. Defense is also a government-regulated industry, not a government-managed one. Government auditors monitor the costs, purchases, and profits of defense contractors. In the United States, congressional investigations have led to volumes of binding regulations — which are often cumbersome and inefficient — that contractors must follow if they are to remain eligible to work on defense projects. Table 1.1 highlights several rough differences between the commercial and defense markets. However, a substantial number of companies are hybrid, with an increasing share of their revenue coming from commercial sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organization-of-the-report&quot;&gt;Organization of the Report&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this report is divided into three chapters. Chapter 2 analyzes China’s defense industrial base (including Chinese defense companies) with a focus on the military capabilities produced by the Chinese defense industry and some of China’s defense-related weaknesses and operational challenges. Chapter 3 examines the strengths and weaknesses in the U.S. defense industrial base, including in such areas as presidential-level support, defense production, and cooperation with allies and partners. Chapter 4 offers policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-defense-industrial-base-and-capabilities&quot;&gt;CHINA’S DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE AND CAPABILITIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines China’s defense industrial base and Chinese military capabilities. It concludes that China’s defense industrial base is moving to a wartime footing, which means that China is rapidly developing and producing weapons systems and preparing to fight a war against another major power, particularly the United States. As U.S. secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall III put it, “China is preparing for a war and specifically for a war with the United States.” Great power wars have historically been won by those nations or coalitions that can outbuild, outspend, outmobilize, and outfight their adversaries. Both modern history and the ongoing war in Ukraine demonstrate that the ability to produce more arms and equipment is crucial for a nation at war. There is little reason to believe that a war between China and the United States would be different, and the relative strengths of their defense industrial bases is therefore a key factor in strategic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthening China’s defense industrial base is one part of China’s broader strategy of competition. Chinese leaders have articulated a long-term national strategy to achieve the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts” by 2049, including developing a “world-class” military. Along these lines, China is focused on outperforming the United States and other countries in the research, development, production, and innovation of information technologies and weapons systems, all of which are central to the future of warfare. In addition, China’s research, acquisition, and production processes and capabilities are improving. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has poured vast resources into capitalizing on the growing capabilities of artificial intelligence, big data, advanced computing, 5G, and supporting military and dual-use technologies. The PLA is developing advanced weapons systems, such as stealth and hypersonic capabilities. In addition, the PLA is amassing a formidable and ever-expanding arsenal of medium- and long-range precision missiles capable of striking U.S. and partner land, air, and sea bases. The PLA is also building a dense web of integrated air defense systems to challenge U.S. forces attempting to operate near such areas as the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s defense industrial base is moving to a wartime footing, which means that China is rapidly developing and producing weapons systems and preparing to fight a war against another major power, particularly the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, trends in military production suggest that China is closing the gap with the United States, though China falls short of the United States on several measures of military power discussed at the end of this chapter. As highlighted in Table 2.1 later in this chapter, China has almost 50 percent more military personnel and twice as many active ground and paramilitary forces as the United States, can take advantage of its large fleet of smaller missile-armed watercraft in fighting near its shores, and operates nearly twice as many main battle tanks and 50 percent more artillery systems than the United States. Although the size of its stockpiles and its rate of production are unclear, China may also have a preponderance of cruise missiles, given the emphasis the PLA places on their use in a conflict with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter is divided into seven sections. The first examines China’s defense sector, including a comparison of U.S. and Chinese military capabilities. The next four sections analyze Chinese maritime, air, land, and missile capabilities. The sixth assesses Chinese defense industrial weaknesses. The final section explores operational challenges for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-sector&quot;&gt;Defense Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rise as a global economic power has made it the preeminent Indo-Pacific military power next to the United States, even with China’s recent economic challenges in such areas as the country’s property crisis, rising unemployment (including youth unemployment), and rapidly aging population. Estimated Chinese defense spending has accounted for at least 2 percent of GDP for the past 30 years, but China’s GDP and defense spending have both increased nearly ninefold during that time. In March 2024, China announced a 7.2 percent increase in its defense budget to continue modernizing its armed forces and strengthen its defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of China’s rise on the regional balance of power has been dramatic. China’s neighbors have not come close to matching its level of spending, as seen in Figure 2.1. Although the United States still spends more on defense than China, the gap is narrowing. Twenty years ago, U.S. military spending was nine times that of China. Last year, it was less than three times as much. The gap is narrower than it looks. The United States has global commitments, while China can focus far more on its immediate neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s defense industry has grown along with its military spending. As shown in Figure 2.2, four of the world’s ten largest defense companies are now Chinese enterprises. China’s biggest defense companies have been growing even larger, but the market has been expanding in other ways, with smaller defense contractors growing more numerous. China has taken what one U.S. government assessment calls a set of “unprecedented steps to facilitate the entry of private firms into the defense industrial base.” That assessment identified 183 private Chinese companies that contributed goods or services to defense aviation and aerospace, 108 of which had ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or PLA that could give them access to advantages not typically available to private commercial entities. The CCP has undertaken significant steps to grow its defense industrial base, a key driver of military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YVCcMJ0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s defense industrial potential is probably even higher than its military spending and domestic defense industries suggest. China has adopted a strategy of military-civil fusion (军民融合), promoting coordination between and integration of military and civilian industry, economies, and systems. Many technologies produced by its civilian sectors have clear military applications, and the CCP is likely seeking to exploit these technologies. China has built military requirements into the construction of civilian infrastructure and sought ways to use civilian construction and logistics for military purposes. Commercial Chinese unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) have been used in Ukraine in large numbers. The PLA has experimented with using civilian roll-on/roll-off watercraft (commonly referred to as “ROROs”) in an invasion of Taiwan, conducting several exercises to develop the necessary doctrine and skills. Chinese companies have also dramatically increased their orders of these ROROs for 2024 and 2025, likely heralding a major expansion in construction. The military implications of any one of these developments are unclear, but China’s defense industrial capacity is likely even greater than it appears on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also improved its defense acquisition system. Over the past decade, the PLA has markedly enhanced its research, development, and acquisition (RDA) process. This progress has allowed the PLA to produce advanced platforms in such difficult areas as carrier-based aviation, hypersonics, and propulsion systems. China’s RDA process appears to have five general steps: feasibility study, project design, engineering and development, experiment and design finalization, and batch production (if a system passes all of these stages). According to one U.S. defense official, it takes China less than seven years, on average, to deliver an operational capability, compared to 16 years for the United States. As an analysis of the Chinese defense acquisition system concludes, “Given sufficient time and money, the Chinese RDA system is capable of producing innovative and sophisticated weapons. It is capable of devoting massive resources toward ambitious, priority projects over very long periods, resulting in incremental progress and eventual achievement of its goals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Over the past decade, the PLA has markedly enhanced its research, development, and acquisition (RDA) process.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese system has several advantages over the U.S. system, as well as some disadvantages discussed later in the chapter. The government’s centralized power and decisionmaking process help drive whole-of-government strategies. By linking the defense budget to GDP, China can reliably forecast and plan future defense spending. China’s military-civil fusion allows the state to direct university-based research to prioritized science and technology areas. China also places multiple bets in defense research and development by funding numerous concepts, choosing winners, and producing systems and platforms in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 2.1 provides an overview of U.S. and Chinese capabilities in such areas as the defense sector and maritime, air, land, and missile capabilities. In addition to these categories, China has also focused on building its network-centric warfare capabilities to fight a joint campaign against the United States. For example, the PLA has developed a concept called “multi-domain precision warfare” (多域精确战). The operational concept is designed to leverage a command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) network; rapidly coordinate firepower using artificial intelligence, big data, and other emerging technologies; and identify and exploit U.S. vulnerabilities. China has also made advances in other areas, including space and cyber. Taken together, China’s production of major combat assets like ships and planes — as well as its creation of the concepts and supporting infrastructure necessary to fight a twenty-first-century adversary — suggest a military and industrial base increasingly prepared for conflict with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maritime&quot;&gt;Maritime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main beneficiary of China’s defense industrial growth has been the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), especially through a growth in China’s shipbuilding capabilities. China’s ability to rapidly build large numbers of ships represents a possible advantage in a protracted war in the Indo-Pacific. China is now the world’s largest shipbuilder by a significant margin. It has a shipbuilding capacity that is more than 230 times larger than that of the United States and sufficient to build 23 million tons of vessels compared to less than 100,000 tons in the United States. According to U.S. Navy estimates, a single Chinese shipyard currently has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards combined. The PLAN’s growth has made it the largest navy in the world. But the U.S. Navy likely remains more capable by most measures, including physical indicators like tonnage or Vertical Launch System (VLS) cells and operational competencies such as anti-submarine warfare, joint operations, and long-range targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 2.3, the PLAN has been growing larger since at least 2006, with increases coming in notable categories: the steady increase in corvette construction since 2014, the completion of the Type 002 aircraft carrier Shandong (山东) and the Type 003 carrierFujian (福建舰) in 2017 and 2022 respectively, and the construction of eight Type 055 destroyers (designated by NATO as a cruiser) since 2019. Some of these ships will grow the Chinese fleet, but others will be swapped with older comparable systems, modernizing the PLAN without increasing its size. However, the overall trend is toward greater size and capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLAN still trails the U.S. Navy in other indicators of military might. China may have more ships than the United States, but they are smaller. The aggregate displacement of the PLAN’s surface warships is a little more than a third that of the U.S. Navy. The PLAN is also capable of carrying roughly half as many missiles as the U.S. Navy, indicating a relative disadvantage in firepower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, both gaps are closing, and China would have the advantage of fighting close to its borders in a conflict in the Taiwan Strait or South or East China Seas, where its naval power will be supplemented by planes and missiles launched from the Chinese mainland as well as resupply with munitions, weapons systems, and spare parts from the mainland. In contrast, the United States maintains significant global commitments beyond East Asia, which will limit its ability to bring to bear the full power of the U.S. Navy and other services against China in conflicts around the Taiwan Strait or South or East China Seas. The United States maintains an unchallenged global advantage at sea, but its advantage is eroding near the Chinese mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GVT3IUR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if China’s fleet does not yet threaten U.S. naval supremacy across the globe, PLAN expansion will likely continue. The number of Chinese ballistic missile submarines, nuclear attack submarines, and large surface combatants may double by 2030, according to U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence assessments. Chinese shipbuilding facilities have been expanding for years, with China’s Changxing Island shipbuilding base growing to approximately 11.5 square kilometers by 2022, about 64 percent larger than China’s historic Jiangnan Shipyard. The expansion is slated to continue, with an additional 4.3 square kilometers planned for the future. Nor is Changxing alone. China has dozens of commercial shipyards that are significantly larger than the biggest U.S. shipyards in size and throughput. Many of these shipyards are used for both military and civilian construction, meaning that China would be able to surge its military shipbuilding capacity more readily than the United States. The result is that China can produce far more ships than the United States, which will allow it to increasingly challenge U.S. dominance, threaten U.S. interests outside of Asia, and potentially prevail in a war of attrition at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar trends hold for comparisons of the U.S. and Chinese submarine fleet. The PLAN operates about the same number of submarines as the U.S. Navy, but they are much less powerful and of lower quality. China operates only 12 nuclear submarines (about a quarter of its subsurface fleet), while the United States exclusively operates nuclear submarines. Chinese submarines are growing more numerous and capable, but the United States plans to increase its submarine production in the coming decade and will probably still maintain its advantage if current expectations hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long it will maintain this advantage remains unclear. China’s submarine industrial base is expanding rapidly. The U.S. Department of Defense estimates a high rate of Chinese submarine production, projecting that the PLAN “submarine force will grow to 65 units by 2025 and 80 units [from 59] by 2035 despite the ongoing retirement of older hulls.” This translates to a rate of completion much faster than one new submarine every eight months, although how much faster is unclear. The U.S. Navy currently plans to buy 15 to 17 new submarines over the next 15 years, which means that the United States will produce fewer submarines but greater aggregate tonnage and combat power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2XRSgvB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ production advantage is likely eroding. The anticipated rate of U.S. nuclear submarine production only exceeds Chinese nuclear submarine production over the previous 15 years by three to five units. Because China has almost certainly improved its ability to produce nuclear submarines since 2010, it can probably match or surpass the United States’ rate of production over the next 15 years if it continues to produce submarines at current levels of quality, although improvements in its submarine quality might slow production. This rate of production suggests that U.S. dominance under the sea is not assured in the longer term, although the U.S. subsurface fleet will remain a key strategic advantage in the coming decade despite the PLAN’s expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, China’s economic and defense industrial growth has spurred major expansion and improvement of the PLAN. The CCP’s navy remains beset by major issues, some of which are outlined in a later section of this chapter. But China has transformed in the past few decades into the world’s most productive naval industrial base. Given the role that naval forces would play in any war between the United States and China, China’s ability to produce warships suggests that a prolonged war at sea between China and the United States or a U.S. partner would play to a key Chinese strength, although that is far from a guarantee of victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-china-has-spent-the-last-few-decades&quot;&gt;Air China has spent the last few decades&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dramatically increasing the rate and quality of its military aircraft production. The United States continues to operate the world’s largest and most advanced fleet of fighter aircraft, but its long-term ability to dominate the air is more uncertain than at any time since the end of the Cold War. China has been rapidly modernizing its air forces, and its ability to produce military aircraft continues to increase as the country reduces its dependence on foreign engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China operates the third-largest fleet of military aircraft in the world, after only the United States and Russia. The number of Chinese combat aircraft has not grown dramatically over the past 20 years, but China’s air fleet has grown significantly more capable. The air forces operated by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and PLAN consist of approximately 2,250 combat aircraft, up slightly from 2,120 a decade ago. As shown in Figure 2.4, those planes are increasingly modern. The PLA had approximately 800 fourth- and fifth-generation combat aircraft at the end of 2016. It had almost 1,500 at the end of 2023. China has also produced at least 200 fifth-generation J-20 fighters since the airframe’s debut in 2010, with rates of J-20 completion set to increase in the coming years. These numbers still trail those of the United States, which operates more than 3,300 fourth- and fifth-generation aircraft, but they represent an impressive rate of military aircraft production. The United States still retains a major advantage in the number of fifth-generation aircraft, with active-duty units operating 165 F-22 and 606 F-35 aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z61n6dY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.4 Fixed-Wing, Crewed Combat Aircraft Operated by the PLA.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Retrofitted aircraft are classified as their original generation type due to lack of reliable data on when retrofitting occurred. Source: Data sourced from the 2009–2024 editions of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, The Military Balance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapid Chinese modernization will likely continue, and China is closing the production gap with the United States. Recent estimates of J-20 production suggest that China is producing more than 100 fifth-generation J-20 airframes per year. Although this is lower than the expected annual F-35 production of 156 airframes per year starting in 2023, the production rate is much closer than has previously been the case and actual J-20 production numbers remain secret. China has also nearly tripled the number of its more advanced J-10C, J-16, and J-20 aircraft in use over the past decade, suggesting a high rate of production. A major factor in China’s improving domestic manufacturing capability is the Chinese-made WS-10 and WS-20 engines, which are replacing imported Russian engines in Chinese aircraft. However, China does not dominate global aircraft production the way it does shipbuilding. The United States and Europe maintain a global duopoly on large passenger aircraft. In contrast, China’s first domestic airliner took its initial commercial flight in June 2023 and is dependent on U.S. and European suppliers for parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also indications that China is seeking to take advantage of its legacy fleet in new ways. China has been steadily retiring its fleet of second- and third-generation J-6, J-7, and J-8 fighter aircraft, retooling some into UASs, which would boost the size of the Chinese air fleet at low cost. This could allow China to absorb much greater attrition of aircraft in a Taiwan contingency than its industrial base or pilot training systems could otherwise support. However, these UASs remain unproven, and it would be premature to include them in assessments of Chinese airpower. What they demonstrate instead is an apparent commitment to experimentation and an effort to multiply the advantages conferred by China’s rapid military modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;missiles&quot;&gt;Missiles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese missile capabilities are a key element of its “assassin’s mace” (杀手锏) approach to combat. The ability to use a multimillion-dollar missile to neutralize a $13 billion aircraft carrier represents an advantage in a prolonged industrial conflict. Some mathematical modeling and wargames indicate that the ability to fire large numbers of missiles is an important determinant of attrition in a conflict between the United States and China. This makes the expansion of China’s missile industry an important advantage in such a conflict. The Chinese arsenal is formidable, and it consists of a rapidly growing ballistic missile stockpile and a variety of cruise missiles for which production rates are difficult to determine. China has the most active and diverse ballistic missile program in the world. China also fielded its first missile with a hypersonic glide vehicle in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s missile industry has been producing at a high rate. For at least the last four years, China has launched more ballistic missiles for testing and training than the rest of the world combined. While the number of China’s ballistic missiles is difficult to quantify, the U.S. Department of Defense assesses roughly a 200 percent increase in the number of Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) between 2016 and 2022. Differences in methodology make the exact figure highly uncertain, but the growth of China’s missile forces is unquestionable. China’s growing number of launchers suggests a high rate of production, as highlighted in Figure 2.5. In the last five years alone, China’s active ballistic missile launchers increased by about 15 percent, with the number of active ICBM launchers doubling and the number of intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) launchers increasing almost fivefold. This increase follows years of improvements in the Chinese ballistic missile industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composition of China’s missile forces has also been changing as the Chinese missile industry produces more advanced missiles. The decrease in missile launchers recorded between 2021 and 2022 is the result of the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) losing several DF-16 and DF-21 missile brigades and gaining two DF-31AG brigades and one DF-17 brigade. The DF-16 and DF-21 are short-range (SRBM) and medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM), respectively. While the DF-16 has been employed only since the mid-2010s, the DF-21 has been in service since the 1990s. The DF-31AG is an upgraded ICBM capable of off-road movement and requiring fewer support vehicles, and the DF-17 is a MRBM that carries an advanced HGV. This process is still ongoing, with the PLARF in the process of constructing at least two more DF-17 brigades along with one IRBM brigade and five ICBM brigades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SrBKtxH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.5 Ballistic Missile Launchers Operated by the PLARF.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Data sourced from the 2010–2024 editions of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, The Military Balance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DF-17 in particular presents a greater threat than a traditional ballistic missile because of the ability of its HGV to travel faster than Mach 5 and its greater degree of maneuverability after reentering the atmosphere. One analysis estimates that China will field between 108 and 144 DF-17 launchers by 2028, at least doubling, if not quintupling, the number of active HGV systems in just five years. In contrast, the United States is still struggling to field hypersonic missiles, with none of the prototypes it planned to field in 2023 arriving on schedule. U.S. delays may not stem from defense industrial inferiority but from more ambitious requirements. Nonetheless, China’s modernization remains a threat to U.S. freedom of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese ballistic missile producers have been expanding their facilities and hiring more workers. This includes producers of missiles, engines, and launch vehicles, such as the Capital Aerospace Machinery Company, and research and development bodies, including the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation’s Fourth Academy. This increase comes alongside a 20-year effort to increase efficiency and reduce waste by consolidating China’s missile industry. As with China’s shipbuilding industry, these expansions suggest increasing production capacity and quality. Whether in the context of a prolonged industrial war or long-term strategic competition, China’s ability to produce large numbers of missiles, especially advanced hypersonic missiles, will represent a source of strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;land&quot;&gt;Land&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA ground forces have not benefited from increases in Chinese defense spending as much as the country’s naval, air, and missile forces. Still, China’s ground forces are more numerous and operate more main battle tanks and artillery pieces than their U.S. counterparts, and the People’s Liberation Army Army (PLAA) has been modernizing its ground equipment with domestic platforms over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLAA is the world’s largest ground force. Over the past five years, it has not meaningfully increased in size, but it has grown heavier, adding nine armored brigades while reducing the number of light and mechanized infantry brigades. The equipping of these new units is ongoing, but open-source analysis indicates that 70 percent of the PLAA’s main battle tanks are now modern and that more than 60 percent of its heavy and medium combined arms brigades are equipped with modern vehicles. These vehicles are Chinese products rather than imports — including newly developed tanks, self-propelled howitzers, and assault vehicles. This is part of China’s strategy of moving its military from a “quantity-scale” type to a “quality-efficiency” type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also developed several capabilities in the past 10 years that will probably increase the PLAA’s role in a Taiwan contingency. The first are helicopters in the PLAA’s aviation arm. China has been trying to improve the ability of its helicopter units to operate as part of a joint campaign. China has also been steadily increasing the number of Z-10, Z-19, Z-20, and Z-8 helicopters for the past five years, as shown in Figure 2.6. PLAA helicopters were observed rearming and refueling onboard PLAN vessels for the first time in 2022. These capabilities could play an important role in an invasion of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second important system is the PCH191 multiple rocket launcher, a modular system capable of firing a variety of rocket types. Long-range precision strike plays a key role in China’s military strategy in the Western Pacific. The launcher is capable of firing low-cost rockets, anti-ship cruise missiles, and land attack missiles. The additional range offered by the system and its ability to strike ships will likely increase the role the PLAA can play in a Taiwan invasion, making it a key contributor to fires delivery against the island and naval forces attempting to operate in the Taiwan Strait. The apparent low price of the system’s rockets could also give the PLAA an important role to play in a prolonged conflict involving land forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jqdumNZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.6 Select Helicopters Operated by the PLAA.&lt;/strong&gt; Source Data sourced from the 2011–2024 editions of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, The Military Balance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLAA has benefited far less from China’s military-industrial development than the PLA’s other combat arms, but it remains the world’s largest ground force and its equipment has grown heavier and more modern over the past five years. Although the skill and technology employed by a military are major determinants of its combat power, the war in Ukraine should remind strategists that quantity still has a quality of its own. The sheer size of the PLAA remains an asset in a prolonged interstate war, especially if one of its neighbors is forced by domestic U.S. politics to fight alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, China’s defense industrial base has grown ever more capable of waging war. Given the tendency of interstate war to develop into a contest of industrial production, the rise of Chinese defense industrial capacity shifts the regional, if not yet global, balance of power toward China. But just how much it has shifted depends on more than just the number of ships, planes, and missiles China can make each year. China’s industrial base and the military end users of its products have numerous weaknesses that cannot be solved by the expansion of a shipyard or an increase in jet fighter production. It is to those weaknesses that this report now turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-weaknesses&quot;&gt;Chinese Weaknesses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s defense industry is formidable but has at least four weaknesses: an overreliance on foreign imports, uneven quality of systems, corruption, and a lack of allies and partners. Nevertheless, the size and opacity of China’s defense industry make it hard for external observers to assess with complete fidelity. The result is that there may also be a variety of weaknesses that go unseen by both CCP and foreign analysts, weaknesses that could prove pivotal in a major war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, China has supply chain vulnerabilities in its defense industrial base and relies on foreign inputs, although China has reduced its reliance on some foreign parts. For example, China’s current diesel submarine fleet relies to some extent on German engines. Airplane engines are another important area of weakness, although China has prioritized developing its own high-quality aerospace engines. China also depends on integrated circuits — computer chips with military and civilian uses. While China is a major exporter of some circuits, it is also a net importer. The United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are all major net exporters, particularly for high-end chips. Chinese chips remain lower quality than those produced abroad, and U.S. export control regulations enacted in late 2022 limit or effectively cut off China’s access to the expertise, equipment, and export markets required to rapidly advance its chip industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparable weakness exists in China’s dependence on imported manufacturing equipment. Chinese machine tools perform worse than foreign tools on several metrics, contributing to low rates of domestic machine tools used in high-tech industries such as aerospace. The result is that high-end manufacturing still depends on imported manufacturing equipment, most of which comes from U.S. partners Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The result of this dependence on foreign parts and manufacturing equipment is that the United States will have opportunities to weaken Chinese military production by cutting off imports through diplomatic or military measures if the two countries go to war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which China can continue to decrease its reliance on foreign parts and tools will be a key determinant of China’s actual military capacity, but the CCP is determined to do so. China is seeking to decrease its dependence on foreign parts and equipment. It has steadily reduced its arms imports in recent decades, as shown in Figure 2.7. Especially notable are the decreases in aircraft imports after major investments in weapons development programs in the mid-2000s. Equally notable is the rise in engine imports as China has expanded its air forces without the ability to produce high-quality domestic aerospace engines, especially after 2017. That trend also may be coming to an end due to breakthroughs in development of aircraft engines using novel techniques and the direct acquisition of foreign firms such as Germany’s Thielert Aircraft, Continental Aerospace Technologies, Superior Air Parts, and Diamond Aircraft. The development of indigenous replacements will be a long and uneven process, however. Until it grows less dependent on imports or improves its relationship with major European and Asian producers, China’s ability to replace destroyed systems in a major war will be limited either by military or political constraints on such imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kSLPsAG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.7 Chinese Defense Imports (Select Categories Displayed).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.55163/CQGC9685&quot;&gt;“SIPRI Military Expenditure Database,” Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the quality of some Chinese systems is lower than that of their Western counterparts. For example, China struggles to design specialized sound-absorbing coatings, deal with vibration-suppression issues created by steam turbines, and decrease the sonar signature of its submarine hull designs. Chinese submarines will therefore be easier to find and destroy than U.S. submarines, rendering them relatively ineffective in a conflict with the United States. Depending on how widespread the problems with Chinese systems are, China’s military could be far less impressive in reality than it is on paper. If China’s systems are far less survivable or lethal than U.S. equivalents, then its productive advantages could be negated or their effects significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, corruption within the CCP, PLA, and Chinese defense industrial base is likely another weakness. Corruption has a negative impact on military effectiveness, as the Russian military discovered to its detriment during its invasion of Ukraine. The extent of corruption throughout the Chinese defense sector is unclear. A spate of corruption investigations within the defense sector took place in 2022 and 2023, most notably in connection with the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, but the opacity of the CCP makes it difficult to determine whether the investigations are truly driven by rooting out corruption or by ulterior domestic political motives. Corruption within the PLA itself has historically been more widespread, with reports of corruption surrounding promotions being common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, China’s lack of major allies and partners is detrimental to its defense industrial base. China will likely benefit much less from its network than will the United States. South Korea and Japan have the second- and third-largest shipbuilding industries in the world, and both have among the largest navies in the world by total tonnage. The Australia–United Kingdom–United States (AUKUS) security partnership is already deepening defense cooperation between the participant countries in nuclear-powered submarines, and it could expand to other areas under AUKUS Pillar Two as well. NATO is increasingly focused on China, naming it as a “challenge” in its 2022 Strategic Concept. While China has some partners, they lack the industrial and financial power of the U.S. alliance network. Russia will be a net drain on China’s industrial capacity as long as it remains bogged down in Ukraine. North Korea and Iran’s economies have been crippled by sanctions, and their arms industries are focused on lower-end systems that are unlikely to help China prevail in a high-end conventional fight in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-uncertainties&quot;&gt;Operational Uncertainties&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA likely has a variety of operational weaknesses in translating defense capabilities to effectiveness, though China is attempting to address them. Overall, the PLA suffers from what it calls “peace disease” (和平病), its lack of combat experience since the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War. Its soldiers, equipment, and doctrine are not battle-tested, and both the PLA and external observers have identified several areas in which PLA performance may fall short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem China faces is its ability to achieve “jointness” — tight coordination of the actions of multiple services across multiple domains to maximize combat power. Structural obstacles within China’s command and control systems make joint operations problematic. The PLA has created theater commands for ground, naval, and air forces, leaving the Central Military Commission responsible for command of the PLARF and People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (PLASSF). The result is that China’s ground, air, and maritime forces would be part of a joint command, while its space, cyber, and electronic warfare capabilities would be part of separate command systems. Cultural issues also abound. Chinese analysts point to interservice rivalry as a major impediment to cooperation between the PLA services. CCP and PLA leadership have sought to reduce these obstacles, but it is unclear how successful these reforms have been in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The PLA suffers from what it calls “peace disease” (和平病), its lack of combat experience since the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second challenge is in the individual levels of competence exhibited by China’s military personnel. Chinese media identify the “Five Incapables,” a set of shortfalls in command competence. PLA assessments state that some commanders cannot “(1) judge situations, (2) understand higher authorities’ intentions, (3) make operational decisions, (4) deploy forces, and (5) manage unexpected situations.” China has consistently attempted to improve its training over the past several years, in part to keep up with its rate of industrial production and to reduce operational weaknesses. In late 2022, for example, the PLAAF expanded its training of pilots for fourth-generation aircraft to a second of its three flight academies, which will probably make its training more efficient and increase PLAAF readiness. PLAAF training prioritizes capabilities that would be vital to war with the United States, including joint air defense, electronic warfare, combat sustainment, long-range offensive strike, and maritime strike. It has also sought to improve its corps of noncommissioned officers, the backbone of any modern military. The success of these reforms is likely uneven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third is logistics. The PLA would be dependent on airlift and sealift in any conflict with the United States. According to some wargames, U.S. attrition of Chinese sealift is a crucial variable determining the outcome of hostilities in Taiwan. Logistics is likely a major weakness in the PLAA, and a lesser one in the PLAAF and PLAN. In a Taiwan scenario, a further difficulty could be created by the lack of sufficient ground transportation within Taiwan due to a lack of heavy equipment transporters. Another constraint on PLA logistics would likely be the airfield network, which would reduce both combat sorties and available airlift in a Taiwan scenario. The PLA can also expect the United States or its allies to target at least some components in its logistics network, particularly sealift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fourth challenge is anti-submarine warfare. China is attempting to improve its anti-submarine warfare capabilities, but it is still likely years away from being able to consistently find and destroy submarines in deep water. The highly variable acoustic properties of the ocean environment make it difficult to detect, identify, track, and engage enemy submarines. Anti-submarine warfare requires national and joint intelligence collection platforms because of the complexities of the operating environment, the size of the maritime area that needs to be covered, and the overall mission to find, fix, track, target, and potentially engage enemy submarines. Some assessments suggest that the PLAN has underinvested in anti-submarine warfare capabilities, which have largely been neglected during modernization. Numerous PLAN ships lack organic sensors, such as towed-array and variable-depth sonar systems, and the PLA as a whole lacks sufficient helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft comparable to the U.S. Navy’s P-8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China likely faces other operational challenges. For example, Chinese military thinkers may have underestimated the need for a prolonged ground campaign in Taiwan, focusing on a few examples of urban warfare in which the attackers were unusually successful. As Russia discovered in Ukraine, the lightning successes of the First Gulf War are difficult to replicate. In addition, Taiwan’s defenders could engage in a long and costly insurgency against PLA forces. There are other questions about Chinese capabilities in the maritime, air, and other domains — including in such areas as surface warfare, mine warfare, amphibious operations, close air support, and airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this chapter has argued, China’s defense industrial base is increasingly operating on a wartime footing and is rapidly building capabilities to deter and, if necessary, fight the United States. China is also improving its research, acquisition, and production processes and capabilities in its defense industrial base, though it has some weaknesses and operational challenges. “It’s really impressive,” said Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment William LaPlante in discussing China’s defense industrial base. “They’ve developed . . . really good high-end capability in numbers. So, they’ve done the development, and the development has been pretty continuous and not just one thing. They place multipl bets. We don’t do that. We . . . very rarely will place multiple bets and . . . [have] three different development activities going on. We used to do that. We don’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is operating with a sense of urgency to catch up — and potentially surpass — the United States. As the next chapter argues, however, the U.S. government is not operating with the same sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-with-the-us-defense-industrial-base&quot;&gt;CHALLENGES WITH THE U.S. DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines challenges with the U.S. defense industrial base. Numerous U.S. policymakers recognize the importance of the defense industrial base for deterrence and warfighting in an increasingly contested international landscape. As the Biden administration’s National Defense Strategy notes, “We will prioritize joint efforts with the full range of domestic and international partners in the defense ecosystem to fortify the defense industrial base, our logistical systems, and relevant global supply chains against subversion, compromise, and theft.” In addition, the U.S. Department of Defense’s National Defense Industrial Strategy outlines a way forward to “bolster and expand America’s ability to innovate and produce the warfighting capabilities at a speed and scale that will help guarantee the ability to fight and win in any conflict.” The United States, including the Department of Defense, has made progress in some areas of the industrial base. For example, the United States has ramped up production lines for some weapons systems, such as 155-millimeter rounds, Stinger air defense systems, Javelin anti-tank weapons systems, and Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) air defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these steps are inadequate. The U.S. defense industrial base and broader defense ecosystem still lack the capacity to meet the U.S. military’s production needs for a competitive security environment. The United States lacks the ability to respond at speed and scale — and with sufficient flexibility — to meet the needs for deterrence and warfighting. A more robust and resilient industrial base is just as critical to deter adversary actions as it is for warfighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States lacks the ability to respond at speed and scale — and with sufficient flexibility — to meet the needs for deterrence and warfighting.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s defense industrial base is increasingly on a wartime footing, which means that Beijing is producing weapons systems and preparing, if necessary, to fight and win a war against the United States. Russia is putting significant resources into revitalizing its defense industrial base with help from China, Iran, North Korea, and other countries. Iran remains active in the Middle East, presents a significant irregular and gray zone threat to the United States and its allies, and has increased its capacity to develop and produce medium- and long-range missiles, unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), and loitering munitions. And North Korea continues to expand its arsenal of nuclear and conventional capabilities. There is also growing defense cooperation between these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, U.S. defense spending is historically low as a percentage of GDP, which has hamstrung Department of Defense efforts to revitalize the industrial base. Defense spending is also historically low as a percentage of total federal outlays. The United States currently spends around 3.5 percent of GDP on defense. As Nobel Prize–winning economist Thomas Schelling argued, effective deterrence is a function of both the intentions and capabilities of the deterrer. Countries need to show that they possess the military power and credible willingness to use force. As Figure 3.1 highlights, the U.S. defense budget peaked at 14 percent of GDP during the Korean War. It was between 9 and 11 percent during President Eisenhower’s “New Look” policies in the 1950s, between 8 and 9 percent during President John F. Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson’s “Flexible Response” period in the 1960s, and over 6 percent during President Ronald Reagan’s defense buildup in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, defense budgets dramatically decreased to 3 to 4 percent in the absence of a major conventional threat. In addition, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and Deputy of Secretary of Defense William Perry convened a remarkable dinner of defense industry executives in 1993 at the Pentagon, which infamously became known as the “Last Supper.” Perry told the group that the administration was cutting the defense budget and that they needed to consolidate. In response, the number of defense companies plummeted from 107 large and small companies in 1990 to 5 major primes by the end of the decade. Defense budgets briefly crept above 4 percent during the surges in Afghanistan and Iraq, although the funding went to wartime operations and not to revitalizing the defense industrial base. Nevertheless, defense budgets shortly fell back to the 3 percent range. The post–Cold War decline in the defense budget was understandable and appropriate. But the situation has changed dramatically over the past few years. Today’s defense budget is historically small, particularly in light of such adversaries as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter examines the U.S. defense industrial base in several areas: presidential-level support, defense production (including munitions stockpiles, the contracting process, supply chains, and the workforce), and allies and partners (including foreign military sales and technology transfers). These areas were chosen because they represent critical parts of the defense industrial base. There are numerous other areas, such as research, development, and the acquisitions process, that deserve attention. The chapter concludes with a brief examination of arguments against major changes in the defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bureaucratic-challenges&quot;&gt;Bureaucratic Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little urgency today from the White House to revitalize the United States’ lagging defense ecosystem and insufficient incentives for industry. In addition, there are major coordination challenges at various levels of the defense industrial base: between various U.S. government departments and agencies, between the government and private sector, and between the U.S. government and foreign governments. Within the United States, many entities beyond the Department of Defense play important roles in the defense industrial base, including the Department of State, Department of Commerce, Department of the Treasury, Congress, the private sector, and other stakeholders. In fact, the growing role of commercial technology in modern defense systems has increased the role of non-defense agencies in the industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is little urgency from the White House to revitalize the United States’ lagging defense ecosystem and insufficient incentives for industry.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are several challenges with the current situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is no major body that can serve as an executive agent directly under the president with the power and authority to break bureaucratic logjams and coordinate across departments and agencies. Multiple agencies — such as the Departments of State and Commerce, as well as various organizations within the Department of Defense (including the military services) — have competing interests, priorities, and authorities. In addition, Congress, the defense industry, and other actors have their own interests, priorities, and authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges are not new, but they are part of the reality of bureaucratic politics in the United States. As Morton Halperin and Priscilla Clapp conclude in their influential book Bureaucratic Politics and Foreign Policy, the government “consists of numerous individuals” and agencies with “very different interests and priorities, and they are concerned with very different questions.” One example is the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which oversees the production, export, and import of defense articles, defense services, and other activities. There are bureaucratic differences in how broadly limits on arms transfers should apply. Department of Defense officials have sometimes erred on the side of providing technology to allies and partners, while the Department of State — and some members of Congress and their staff — have been less willing to accept risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there has been insufficient action to fix current problems. The president plays a particularly important role in providing strategic guidance and urgency. As Halperin and Clapp argue, “The president stands at the center of the foreign policy process in the United States. . . . In any foreign policy decision widely believed at the time to be important, the president will almost always be the principal figure determining the general direction of actions.” Without direct and forceful presidential action, major changes in the defense industrial base are significantly more challenging. As noted below, Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, and Reagan played important roles in revitalizing the defense industrial base during their presidencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems are not new. Presidential leadership has been essential during critical periods of U.S. history to strengthen — or consolidate — the defense industrial base. But words have generally not been sufficient. Roosevelt, Truman, Reagan, and others created institutional bodies to advise the president on better strategic guidance and coordination across the U.S. government and with the private sector, issue directives, and even directly plan, coordinate, direct, and control industrial mobilization. Table 3.1 shows several examples of institutional structures designed to jump-start the defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7p8i5Tb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3.1 Example of White House–Led Defense Institutions.&lt;/strong&gt; Source CSIS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 1940, a year and a half before Pearl Harbor and the United States’ entry into World War II, a perceptive President Roosevelt created the National Defense Advisory Committee (NDAC) to help coordinate various segments of the U.S. defense industrial base. It included seven members: William Knudsen, the president of General Motors; Edward Stettinius, Jr., president of U.S. Steel; Chester C. Davis, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Leon Henderson, a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission; Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America; Ralph Budd, chairman of the board of the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad; and Harriet Elliott, dean of women from the University of North Carolina. When Knudsen asked Roosevelt at the first meeting who was head of the group, Roosevelt responded that he was as president of the United States. Roosevelt’s point was that a major revitalization of the defense industrial base required the oversight of the U.S. president. Roosevelt’s strategic guidance and decision to spend money on defense was essential to mobilization well before World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 16, 1942, Roosevelt created the War Production Board to supervise production. He appointed Donald M. Nelson, executive vice president of Sears Roebuck, as the chair. The body exercised general direction over U.S. war procurement and production; determined the policies, plans, and procedures of federal departments regarding procurement and production; directed conversion of companies from peacetime to wartime work; established priorities in the distribution of materials and services; and prohibited nonessential production. Since the country was at war, the War Production Board also rationed such commodities as gasoline, heating oil, metals, rubber, paper, and plastics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Truman abolished the Office of War Mobilization after World War II, but he quickly switched gears as the Cold War began. He established a cabinet-level Office of Defense Mobilization to plan, coordinate, direct, and control all defense industrial production. He established a National Security Resources Board to mobilize natural resources and the scientific community to meet the United States’ growing military demands. Truman also signed the Defense Production Act on September 8, 1950, which authorized the president to force companies to prioritize defense production, set aside price ceilings, and expand private and public production capacity during the Korean War. The National Security Resources Board also helped mobilize the economy for war through regulation of the private market and takeover of industrial production. Under the act, the government could control prices, build defense plants, regulate credit, and streamline resources and products for manufacturing. Congress would go on to reauthorize the Defense Production Act at least 53 times over the next seven decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1981, President Reagan created the Emergency Mobilization Preparedness Board to improve mobilization capabilities and interagency cooperation within the federal government to respond to major peacetime or war-related emergencies. The board consisted of the representatives of 22 key federal agencies at the deputy secretary or under secretary level and was chaired by the assistant to the president for national security affairs. A full-time secretariat was established to support the board and monitor the implementation of its recommendations by federal agencies. It included senior representatives from several departments and agencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Department of Defense&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Department of Commerce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Department of Agriculture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Department of the Treasury&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Department of Labor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These institutional bodies were particularly important during periods of significant strategic competition (such as at various points in the Cold War) and during wars. As President Roosevelt recognized before World War II and President Reagan decided during heightened tension, a presidential-level body can be critical before war — in part to strengthen deterrence and potentially avert war. President Roosevelt perhaps said it best in arguing that “we must be the great arsenal of democracy” and to “build now with all possible speed every machine, every arsenal, every factory that we need to manufacture our defense material.” The absence of an effective institution tied to the president has made it difficult to revitalize the defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-production&quot;&gt;Defense Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States faces substantial challenges in defense production. The war in Ukraine has highlighted some significant production problems, even when the United States is not directly at war and has not committed soldiers, sailors, and air crews to fight in Ukraine. In response to initial production challenges, the Department of Defense and private sector eventually increased production for some weapons systems, such as 155-millimeter rounds, Stingers, Javelins, and PAC-3 systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the U.S. defense industrial ecosystem —  the executive branch, Congress, and industry — lack the speed, agility, and depth to replace weapons stockpiles and systems in a sufficient timeframe for the current security environment. As Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment William LaPlante acknowledged, the U.S. defense industrial base is “dialed down to the minimum amount. . . . [We have] very few development programs, [a] minimal amount, and then very few production programs.” In addition, as the United States and other countries have reduced their stockpiles of weapons systems to send to such countries as Ukraine, they often do not replenish with the exact same systems. In some cases, the infrastructure and tooling does not exist anymore to replace depleted stockpiles of legacy systems, so the U.S. government turns to the latest generation. But new generations aren’t always available, creating a gap and compounding shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congressional dysfunction has been unhelpful to the industrial base, including the failure to pass budgets and the reliance on continuing resolutions (CRs). As Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth explained, “The Army cannot exercise its Multi-Year Procurement to purchase additional Patriot missiles or begin construction on a Guided Missile Maintenance Building under a CR. This will impede our ability to send a consistent demand signal to industry and will limit production and maintenance capacity on critical munitions.” CRs can also delay acquisition efforts and the awarding of contracts for critical weapons systems and infrastructure upgrades for the industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several broad challenges with defense production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Munitions Shortfalls:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. military continues to have a shortfall of munitions and other weapons system for deterrence and warfighting. As Figure 3.3 highlights, examples include the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), PAC-3, Standard Missile-6 (SM-6), MK-48, Tomahawk land-attack missiles (TLAM), Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Naval Strike Missile. Some analysis suggests that protracted regional conflicts will expend significant quantities of munitions, likely exceeding current Department of Defense planning efforts. In nearly two dozen iterations of a CSIS wargame that examined a U.S.-China war in the Taiwan Strait, the United States typically expended more than 5,000 long-range missiles in three weeks of conflict, including 4,000 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSMs), 450 LRASMs, 400 Harpoons, and 400 TLAMs. One of the most important munitions to prevent a Chinese seizure of all of Taiwan were long-range precision missiles, including missiles launched by U.S. submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LRASMs offer a useful case study. In every iteration of the wargame, the United States expended its inventory of LRASMs within the first week of the conflict. These missiles were particularly useful because of their ability to strike Chinese naval forces from outside of the range of Chinese air defenses. As the wargame showed, Chinese defenses are likely to be formidable — especially early on — thus preventing most aircraft from moving close enough to drop short-range munitions. Bombers generally employed these munitions because they could be based outside of the range of Chinese missiles. In addition, it takes nearly two years to produce LRASMs, creating a time lag to fix the shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S. military continues to have a shortfall of munitions and other weapons system for deterrence and warfighting.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge with munitions stockpiles is having sufficient numbers for a protracted conflict. The dilemma for the government, in particular, is to try to match the production rate of weapons systems with the consumption rate in a possible war. This is more of an art than a science, since it requires estimating the possible timelines and munitions usage in a future war. For example, will a possible conflict between the United States and China over Taiwan be short or long? Will it spread to other theaters? What types of munitions and weapons systems will it involve? There are no clear answers to these questions, and numerous variables impact the duration and geographic expanse of wars. But several issues need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, wars between major powers can be long in duration. In general, the mean war duration for interstate wars is roughly 15 months. But wars involving one or more major powers can last for longer, including the Crimean War (28 months), Russo-Japanese War (16 months), World War I (52 months), World War II (over 60 months), Korean War (36 months), Vietnam War (121 months), and Sino-Vietnamese War (60 months). Consequently, it would be prudent to plan for wars of longer, rather than shorter, durations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, wars involving major powers can use significant quantities of munitions. In addition, weapons systems and platforms — such as main battle tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, and fighter aircraft — are destroyed or experience significant wear and tear from constant use. The war in Ukraine highlights that conventional wars involving one or more major powers can require a robust defense industry (or access to the defense industry of allies) to produce sufficient quantities of munitions and weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, stockpiles are important not just for warfighting, but for deterrence. As highlighted by Thomas Schelling’s work, deterrence is more effective if states have sufficient stockpiles (capabilities) and are prepared to use them (intentions). “Production is deterrence,” remarked Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment William LaPlante. And this is not just for typical ground, air, and maritime systems — but also for satellites. Take, for example, the production of satellites for low Earth orbit (LEO). It is beneficial to have hot production lines for satellites for several reasons, including to ensure a proliferated constellation to maximize intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; replace satellites with short life spans; and increase deterrence. If an adversary sees that a state is mass-producing LEO satellites, shooting them down has a limited impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contracting Challenges:&lt;/strong&gt; The contracting process continues to be a challenge for defense production, though there has been progress. The Department of Defense has created a Joint Production Accelerator Cell (JPAC) within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment to improve production capacity, resiliency, and surge capacity for specific weapons systems and supplies. JPAC is the successor to the Munitions Industrial Base Deep Dive. One of JPAC’s successes has been to extend multiyear procurement to some nontraditional items, as well as to use multiyear procurement with large lot procurement methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet some congressional members and staff — including from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees — are risk averse on such issues as multiyear contracts. As discussed at the end of this chapter, some policymakers are concerned that multiyear contracts will unnecessarily commit the United States to fund weapons systems and reduce budget flexibility. Yet multiyear contracts are critical for increasing production capacity, resilience, and supply chain support. Defense companies are unwilling to take financial risks without contracts — particularly multiyear contracts — in place. It is not a sound business decision to produce more munitions or weapons systems without a clear demand signal and financial commitments, especially given the large capital investment and number of personnel required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This risk aversion is compounded if companies have to make additional capital investments to increase defense production — especially investments for facilities, infrastructure, and tooling. As one Department of Defense study concluded, “Producers benefit from steady or predictable orders, so the DoD’s inconsistent procurement and concurrent production ramps (both increases and decreases) exacerbate the challenges suppliers face across the DIB [defense industrial base].” There has been an inconsistent demand signal from the Department of Defense to build up stockpiles, which risks production lines being shut down. Part of the challenge is the difficulty of predicting future demand. For example, what if the war in Ukraine winds down following a negotiated settlement? What if the current or future administration loses interest in supporting another “forever war?” Or what if Congress refuses to obligate funds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Department of Defense signs multiyear contracts for ships and airplanes, it does not sign multiyear contracts for a range of munitions and other weapons systems. After all, the services — such as the Navy and Marine Corps — have historically cut munitions from their budgets to make room for other priorities, or to fix problems that arise during the acquisition of those systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) process is too bureaucratic, time intensive, and inefficient. It tends to stifle innovation, reward compliance rather than results, and discourages many world-class commercial companies from doing business with the U.S. government. As Jacques Gansler, former undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics, acknowledged over a decade ago, “Such excessive regulation also discourages government contracting personnel from applying management flexbility as they interpret the steps that should be taken in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply Chain Issues:&lt;/strong&gt; There continue to be supply chain challenges that hinder production. For example, there is limited production of key components, such as solid rocket motors, processor assemblies, castings, forgings, ball bearings, microelectronics, and seekers for munitions. Dependence on a small number of private firms — or even a single source — leaves the United States highly vulnerable to supply disruption. In addition, the United States is overreliant on single or foreign sources for key components or materials. This dependence has been particularly acute for certain strategic and critical materials, including antimony, lithium, and some rare-earth minerals. China dominates the advanced battery supply chain across the globe, such as lithium hydroxide, electrolyte, lithium carbonate, anodes, and cathodes. As noted in Chapter 2, however, China’s defense industrial base also has supply chain vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sub-tier suppliers are also at risk. Many operate on narrow profit margins, which makes them susceptible to cyclical defense demands and changes in the defense budget. These challenges undermine the ability and willingness of some sub-tier suppliers to remain in the defense market. In a 2023 report, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Supply chain risks are not unique to the Department, but such risks take on greater urgency when considered in light of national security. For example, to keep aging weapon systems operational, we [DOD] depend on a finite number of repair parts suppliers, some of which are precariously close to fiscal collapse. The proliferation of counterfeit items (particularly for microelectronics) increases the risk of mission delay or imperiled safety. Intellectual property vulnerabilities and lowered integrity of sensitive data and secure networks undermine the protections around our weapon system designs. Dependence on foreign entities for critical items and cyber disruptions to the manufacturing and transportation domains likewise jeopardize mission support and success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Today’s workforce is inadequate to meet the challenges of the defense industrial base.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workforce Constraints:&lt;/strong&gt; Today’s workforce is inadequate to meet the challenges of the defense industrial base. The U.S. labor market is unable to provide a sufficient number of workers with the right skills to meet the defense demands of today and tomorrow. Retention is also a significant challenge. Skills in short supply range from software engineers to welders. As Under Secretary of Defense LaPlante argued, “the workforce in many ways is the most stressing element right now, both talented workforce, in terms of writing software, engineering, but also the workforce that does the production and is conversant in advanced production, whether it’s additive or subtractive manufacturing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipyards are particularly problematic. Some skills sets, such as nuclear welding, are particularly difficult to acquire outside of U.S. Navy procurement. But the workforce shortage is widespread. In 2024, the Navy briefed Congress that the first Constellation-class guided-missile frigate (FFG-62) will be at least a year late because of workforce shortfalls at Fincantieri’s Marinette Marine shipyard. The Wisconsin shipyard is short of several hundred blue- and white-collar workers, including welders. In 2022, the Navy ended the fiscal year short 1,200 workers across its four shipyards. As the head of Naval Sea Systems Command remarked, hiring and retaining skilled workers in government repair yards and private sector shipbuilding is the Navy’ top strategic challenge across the enterprise. In addition, construction of the Block V version of the Virginia-class fast-attack submarine is at least two years behind schedule because of workforce constraints and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;allies-and-partners&quot;&gt;Allies and Partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy rightly emphasize the importance of allies and partners in today’s competitive landscape. In the defense industrial base, working with allies and partners involves several examples: co-development, co-production, co-sustainment, second-sourcing, and licensed production. Some foreign companies — particularly from allied and partner countries — have U.S.-based subsidiaries, such as Leonardo DRS, BAE Systems, and Austal, which manufacture products or conduct services for unclassified and classified Department of Defense programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the United States does a poor job of sharing technology and selling weapons systems to its most important friends — the countries with which it needs to cooperate for both deterrence and warfighting. It is virtually inconceivable that the United States would fight a major war on its own. U.S. export controls and technology security and foreign disclosure processes undermine the ability to collaborate with allies and partners. This reality is especially disconcerting because the United States shares some of its most sensitive secrets with allies and partners — including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, which make up the “Five Eyes” intelligence community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section focuses on two areas where the United States faces serious challenges: foreign military sales and technology transfer policies and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Military Sales:&lt;/strong&gt; The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program is a form of security assistance in which the United States sells defense articles and services to foreign countries. The Department of State’s Office of Regional Security and Arms Transfers, located in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, oversees FMS transactions. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) implements specific FMS cases. The Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), which also sits within the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, issues and administers licenses for commercial sales. Congress ultimately reviews foreign military sales that rise to the threshold for congressional notification. Several parts of the Department of State are involved, including the Bureau of Political Military-Affairs, the Office of Regional Security and Arms Transfers, the Office of Security Assistance, and the DDTC. Several parts of the Department of Defense are involved in FMS, including the DSCA, the military services, the Joint Staff, and various offices within the Office of the Secretary of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an eligible foreign government opts to purchase or otherwise acquire a U.S. defense system or service, it initiates the formal process by issuing a letter of request (LOR). The government submits the LOR to a U.S. security organization or the DSCA. Following approval of the transfer, the United States responds with a letter of offer and acceptance (LOA). The time it takes to prepare an LOA can vary based on such factors as the foreign government involved, the weapons system or service requested, and the overall complexity of the sale. It can be fast for routine items, but long and difficult for others. Then there is the production of the system, including non-recurring items such as software updates and modifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been some progress in improving the FMS process. For example, the Department of Defense completed an FMS Tiger Team with several dozen concrete actions to streamline FMS. In addition, Department of State officials report that they approve 95 percent of FMS cases within 48 hours for their portion of FMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the entire FMS process — from initial discussions to LOR, LOA, production, and modifications — is too long. It takes an average of 18 months to get FMS cases on contract. There is also no real accountability in the FMS system. The Department of State statutorily owns it, but execution largely falls to the Department of Defense and is split among the military services and several Department of Defense agencies. No one is held accountable for strategic success or failure. Partner and ally requests for U.S. systems can go unanswered for months or even years. FMS programs are executed under a U.S. government contract negotiated and awarded by a U.S. military service contracting officer on behalf of the FMS partner. The Department of Defense contracting community is understaffed. FMS contracts are sometimes given a low priority by contracting officers, who look first to support U.S. service personnel, then to contracts to support innovation for next-generation capabilities for U.S. service personnel, then to FMS. In addition, staffing constraints, technological limitations, and the increasing complexity of systems could slow the rate at which transactions are approved if there is a major increase in FMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Transfer Policies and Procedures:&lt;/strong&gt; A related issue includes technology transfer review policies and procedures — including ITAR — for FMS and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS). ITAR is the U.S. regulation that controls the manufacture, sale, and distribution of defense and space-related articles and services. ITAR and other regulations are important and are designed to prevent the transfer of sensitive technology to adversaries and, in some instances, to signal disapproval to foreign countries because of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has a long-standing exemption for Canada and can transfer some unclassified defense material and services without an export license. This exemption is limited, and companies sometimes avoid using the exemption because they are worried about the consequences of ITAR violations. Exports to Canada of classified and more sensitive material and services still require a license. In addition, there have been several historical cases in which the United States has made exceptions to technology transfers when there are strategic imperatives, such as countering the Soviet Union’s growing capabilities during the Cold War or aiding Ukraine following Russia’s 2022 invasion. For example, the United States and United Kingdom signed the Polaris Sales Agreement in 1963, which allowed the United States to export Polaris missiles, launch tubes, fire control systems, and relevant technologies to the United Kingdom to build and maintain its submarine-based nuclear weapons systems. U.S. and other NATO officials had become increasingly concerned about the Soviet Union’s nuclear and conventional capabilities and their impact on the military balance in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several failed efforts to gain ITAR exemptions for the United Kingdom and Australia in the early 2000s. In 2010, the United States tried again and signed treaties, ratified by the Senate, that created a “trusted community” of companies in the United States, Australia, and United Kingdom that could share technology and compete for opportunities. But these treaties and other arrangements failed to significantly increase technology cooperation and have almost never been used by industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality today is that the United States has failed to make significant progress in reducing export barriers, particularly with its closest allies and partners. These obstacles undermine co-development, co-production, co-sustainment, and other types of cooperative arrangements that provide benefits by increasing economies of scale, supporting the U.S. defense industrial base (including providing jobs to U.S. workers), and strengthening allies and partners. Incorporating allies and partners into the development, execution, and sustainment of programs is not always a top-level priority for some U.S. defense acquisitions specialists, even with a push by senior Department of Defense officials for greater technology sharing with allies and partners. In the development of acquisition programs, requirements documents are too frequently overclassified and marked “SECRET//NOFORN,” which prohibits sharing with foreign governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for close allies, there are notable delays, confusion, and unpredictability with the U.S. technology transfer process — a sign of a peacetime, not a wartime, process. The U.S. Technology Security and Foreign Disclosure (TSFD) process often causes delays for close allies, which prevent them from doing technical assessments before they even get to the LOR stage. The TSFD process is also far too opaque and unpredictable. These challenges can significantly impact time-sensitive actions, such as refitting ships during fixed docking periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the United Kingdom, for example, U.S. delays held up a routine upgrade on sonar systems for UK Royal Navy submarines for several months, while another UK submarine had to wait months to be serviced by a cleared contractor until the U.S. Department of State authorized an export-controlled component. As one analysis concluded, “months went by waiting for a license that just added cost and risk to an ally’s military capability.” More broadly, the United Kingdom spends a shocking $500 million each year — almost 1 percent of its defense budget — complying with ITAR regulations. As another assessment concluded: “When close U.S. allies — or their defense firms — wish to develop technology or acquire capability from the United States, they have to navigate a byzantine system of regulation. This costs time and money, undermines allies’ sovereignty, stifles innovation, and blunts the United States’ edge in the strategic competition with China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The reality today is that the United States has failed to make significant progress in reducing export barriers, particularly with its closest allies and partners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is far too risk averse and needs to rethink the benefits of sharing technology with its closest allies and partners, as well as the risk of not sharing that information. As Under Secretary of Defense LaPlante argued, “the system is built around a risk of technology exploitation by an adversary. High risk of that. We want to make sure we mitigate against that. Well, you have that risk but now we also have the operational imperative of what we’re facing in the Indo-Pacific, and we have to just get over it with close allies and partners like the UK and Australia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the chief of the United Kingdom’s navy, Admiral Sir Ben Key, remarked that “what we want to be able to do is move quicker” in today’s competitive security environment in the area of technology transfers. The risks of an overly regulated and risk-averse defense culture is highlighted in Andrew Gordon’s book, The Rules of the Game: Jutland and British Naval Command, which examined British failures between the Battle of Trafalgar and the Battle of Jutland. In periods of peace, regulators often predominate. But in periods of war, in which countries must move quickly against cunning adversaries, “rat catchers” need to dominate. As Admiral Key asked, “Are we setting up the ITAR and all the rest of it to allow the regulators or the rat catchers? And what is it we’re trying to achieve?” He continued that “what we really want to do is in a contested environment, when the pressure is really on, we want the information to move between allies and partners and friends as fast as we possibly can with as few hurdles as we can.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some hope that AUKUS — the security pact initiated in 2022 between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to cooperate on sensitive technologies, including nuclear-powered submarines — might usher in a new era of technology cooperation between the three countries. But that has not been the case — at least not yet. As outlined in Table 3.2, the second pillar of AUKUS raises the prospect of expanding the research, development, and fielding of advanced capabilities in six technological areas (undersea capabilities, quantum technologies, artificial intelligence and autonomy, advanced cyber, hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities, and electronic warfare) and two broad functional areas (innovation and information sharing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of a challenge in technology sharing is the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB). It was first codified in U.S. law in 1992 when the United States and Canada were designated as one national technology industrial base. The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) added the United Kingdom and Australia — and the 2023 NDAA added New Zealand. The NTIB consists of the people and organizations engaged in national security and dual-use research and development, production, maintenance, and related activities within the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand. But the NTIB is largely failing. There has been some progress in coordinating foreign investment reviews, but little has been achieved in facilitating export control processes. As one study concludes, the NTIB “has not been utilized to foster industrial collaboration in any meaningful way and many have begun to question NTIB’s utility as a vehicle for such efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7VEqF0L.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;

Nicastro, AUKUS Pillar 2: Background and Issues for Congress, CRS Report NO. R47599 (Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service, June 2023)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, some of the United States’ “Buy America” provisions are generally counterproductive and undermine the ability to work closely with allies and partners who the United States will need in almost any conceivable war or military operation. After all, modern weapons systems are products of a globalized market. Take the F-35 Lightning II combat aircraft program. Production and sustainment relies on 1,900 companies around the globe in 48 states and 10 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge with reforming FMS and technology transfers to allies and partners in today’s international security landscape is that there are so many U.S. government agencies involved. Within the Department of Defense, examples include the DSCA, Defense Technology Security Administration, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, and military services. Within the Department of State, there are several offices within the Under Secretary for Arms Control and International Security and the regional bureaus. There are also other entities with various roles, such as the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Treasury. Within Congress, several committees have roles in FMS and technology transfer policies and procedures, such as the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee, and House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resistance-to-change&quot;&gt;Resistance to Change&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why some policymakers have resisted significant change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, some individuals and offices remain overly cautious about sharing sensitive technology with other countries — even to some of the United States’ closest allies with whom it shares its most sensitive intelligence. While the United States needs to prevent its sensitive technology from falling into the hands of its adversaries, such as China, Russia, and Iran, some of the concerns are anachronistic and counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, some see a revitalization of the defense industrial base as giving money to greedy executives that produce deadly weapons systems. They also want more accountability for an industry they see as already engaging in waste, fraud, and abuse. For example, 60 Minutes, produced by CBS News, alleged that defense contractors had overcharged the Department of Defense for a wide array of defense equipment, potentially costing the U.S. government billions of dollars. In addition, the Department of Defense’s Office of Inspector General found some instances of overcharging, including a pattern of behavior by the contractor TransDigm. The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability summarized TransDigm’s actions as “rampant price gouging on mission-critical aircraft parts.” In May 2023, five senators alleged in a letter to the secretary of defense that some companies had “abused the trust government has placed in them, exploiting their position as sole suppliers for certain items to increase prices far above inflation or any reasonable profit margin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These accusations of fraud, waste, and abuse need to be taken seriously, and any individuals and companies found guilty need to be appropriately punished. The Department of Justice, Department of Defense’s Office of Inspector General, and other organizations are designed to conduct investigations and take necessary actions. But major waste, fraud, and abuse are the exceptions. In addition, closer inspection suggests that several of the charges leveled in the CBS News report, including price gouging, were inaccurate. The outlier cases should not be an excuse for failing to strengthen the defense industrial base and improve technology transfers to key allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, some policymakers oppose multiyear contracts because these types of contracts commit the government to fund the weapons systems or programs, reducing budget flexibility in out years. Government agencies lose liquidity, and it can be more difficult to move money over the course of a fiscal year if a military service or other entity wants to shift priorities. Munitions are sometimes a “bill payer,” a part of the defense budget from which officials can trim to fund other programs. Without multiyear contracts that guarantee funding, however, companies have little incentive to take financial risk and grow capacity. It’s not worth investing if there is unreliable demand. And the costs and risks are high. Multiyear contracts keep supply lines warm, sustain supply chain subcontractors, increase production efficiencies that help industry better respond to surges, and encourage investment in facilities and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing number of qualitative analyses and wargames suggest that the Department of Defense lacks key munitions stockpiles for a protracted conflict — or even a short one — in such theaters as the Indo-Pacific. In today’s security environment, it increasingly makes sense for the government to take on more of the risk of buying weapons systems — perhaps even risking overbuying — because the risks associated with underbuying are so significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the arguments opposed to revitalizing the defense ecosystem are largely unpersuasive, obsolete, and ultimately counterproductive in today’s competitive international landscape. As this chapter argues, the U.S. defense industrial base remains unprepared for the current security environment. The next chapter turns to possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Multiyear contracts keep supply lines warm, sustain supply chain subcontractors, increase production efficiencies that help industry better respond to surges, and encourage investment in facilities and equipment.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-way-ahead&quot;&gt;THE WAY AHEAD&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks of failing to adequately revitalize the U.S. defense industrial base and broader defense ecosystem are significant and growing, especially with China putting significant resources into its defense industrial base and building advanced military capabilities. Without urgent changes, the United States could find itself with substantial supply and matériel shortfalls, which severely impact both deterrence and warfighting. The United States could also face a situation in which surge capacity lags, innovation stagnates, maintenance of critical supply chains is disincentivized, and the defense industrial base is underprepared for future stockpile requirements. The U.S. defense industrial base — led by a robust and strengthened commercial industry — needs to be a key pillar of broader U.S. industrial policy strategy to compete with China economically, technologically, and militarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “peace dividend” that emerged at the end of the Cold War is over. The international security environment has dramatically shifted. In February 2022, Russia invaded democratic Ukraine in a brazen move that has led to a protracted war of attrition. Since then, Russia has doubled down and ramped up defense production and imported weapons systems and components from such countries as China, Iran, and North Korea. In October 2023, Hamas conducted a bloody attack against Israel, and then Iranian-linked groups targeted U.S. and partner forces in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and other countries. Iran and Iranian-linked groups possess a growing arsenal of sophisticated stand-off weapons, from missiles to unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) and loitering munitions, which require improved air defense and counter-UAS capabilities. In the Indo-Pacific, China has become increasingly aggressive against Taiwan, the United States, and numerous countries in the region, such as Japan, Australia, and the Philippines. Finally, North Korea is expanding its arsenal of nuclear and conventional weapons, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, which threaten South Korea, the United States, and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s defense industrial base is also increasingly operating on a wartime footing and is developing and producing weapons systems in all major domains — land, air, maritime, cyber, and space. As Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall remarked, “China has been reoptimizing its forces for great power competition and to prevail against the U.S. and the Western Pacific for over 20 years. . . . China has been building a military capability specifically designed to achieve their national goals and to do so even if opposed by the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is good news, however. The U.S. private sector is innovative, and the United States has a history of rejuvenating its defense sector in the face of authoritarian military action. U.S. revitalization has not just occurred during wartime, such as World War II or the Korean War, but also during times of increased strategic competition, such as during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. In addition, a strengthened U.S. defense industrial base is good for U.S. jobs, since every state in the United States has workers in the defense sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides recommendations to help revitalize the U.S. defense industrial base. It focuses on several areas: a White House–level initiative, defense production, and allies and partners. These recommendations are not intended to be comprehensive, but rather illustrative of the type of urgent changes necessary. There are many others worth considering, such as broad acquisition reform, strengthening economic security agreements, protecting against cyberattacks, improving international interoperability, and reducing the United States’ reliance on China and other competitors for raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s defense industrial base is increasingly operating on a wartime footing and is developing and producing weapons systems in all major domains — land, air, maritime, cyber, and space.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;white-houseled-effort&quot;&gt;White House–Led Effort&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need for a presidential-led body to provide strategic guidance across government and to oversee a major revitalization of the defense industrial base and defense ecosystem. The Department of Defense cannot do it alone. The Department of State, Department of Commerce, Department of the Treasury, Congress, private sector, and other organizations also play important roles in the defense industrial base. Revitalization will likely not occur without White House leadership, as the history of the U.S. defense industrial base suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several options. One is a variant of the production boards that existed during the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. This body could be created by the president and could exercise general direction over U.S. defense procurement and production; help determine the policies, plans, and procedures of federal departments regarding procurement and production; establish priorities in the distribution of materials and services; break through bureaucrat gridlock; and provide a sense of urgency in revitalizing the defense industrial base. A second option is a variant of the Reagan administration’s Emergency Mobilization Preparedness Board, which was designed to improve mobilization capabilities and interagency cooperation within the federal government. The board might consist of representatives from key federal agencies at the deputy secretary or under secretary level, be chaired by the national security advisor, and include a full-time secretariat. A third option is the establishment of a national commission — composed of prominent former government officials, industry executives, and other subject-matter experts — designed to make recommendations to the U.S. president. A critical part of all of these options is to tie the body to the U.S. president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-production-1&quot;&gt;Defense Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramping up defense production should include several steps. An important goal should be for industry to produce high-volume and high-impact systems at affordable costs over time that help the United State strengthen deterrence and warfighting. Doing this will require shifting the incentives governing the defense industrial base on a range of issues, such as multiyear contracting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense Spending:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States likely cannot revamp its defense industrial base without increasing defense spending. The goal should be to increase funding for the development and production of critical weapons systems. An infusion of cash would strengthen the defense industrial base using Title 3 funds in the Defense Production Act, including such components as rocket boosters, energetics, engines, munitions, and new weapons systems. It might also be helpful for the government to increase investments in defense infrastructure, such as factories, which can be difficult and risky for industry to invest in quickly. One option might be to establish more government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities. Amid the Cold War, the last major period of strategic competition, the U.S. defense budget hovered between 9 and 11 percent of GDP during the Eisenhower administration, between 8 and 9 percent during Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and over 6 percent during the Reagan administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has not conducted a comprehensive defense budget analysis. However, today’s current defense budget of approximately 3 percent of GDP is not historically consistent with a security environment in which authoritarian states, such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, are increasingly threatening the United States and its allies and partners. China, in particular, is developing a robust defense industrial base that is focused on warfighting and deterrence against the United States. In this environment, the United States needs to analyze defense budget options at least closer to the levels of the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiyear Contracting:&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense and Congress need to expand the use of multiyear procurement to create sustained demand signals that can promote investment into the capacity of the industrial base. These types of contracts have typically been reserved for only the most expensive acquisition types, such as procurement of large Navy ships. Multiyear procurement is a step in building a consistent and predictable demand signal that creates more transparency and less risk for both prime contractors as well as more fragile sub-tier suppliers. Reliance on cost savings only is too restrictive, and promoting defense industrial base stability and effective deterrence and warfighting is an important justification for multiyear contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act authorized multiyear procurement for some munitions, such as JASSM, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), LRASM, and PAC-3. While helpful, the problem has generally not been the authorization of multiyear contracts, but rather the failure of appropriators or the military services to fund or spend multiyear contracts. Appropriators need to fund — and the services need to spend — critical munitions important for warfighting and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East. There are several munitions that should be considered for future multiyear funding, such as the AGM-179 Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM), Javelin, Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile Extended Range (AARGM-ER), AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), and Harpoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Department of Defense and Congress need to expand the use of multiyear procurement to create sustained demand signals that can promote investment into the capacity of the industrial base.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Stockpiles:&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense maintains stockpiles of some key minerals, munitions, chemicals, technology, and medical supplies. But it needs to better manage inventory and stockpile planning to decrease near-term risk and mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities. It also needs to stockpile (or develop alternative markets for) such critical minerals as antimony, titanium, nickel, and cobalt. For example, the United States imports a significant amount of titanium sponge from Russia and China, which could be cut off or interrupted in a war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense and Congress should allocate additional funding for contracts and other incentives — such as tax incentives, regulatory relief, and long-term contracts — to build and maintain spare production capacity. Such funding should be used to modernize and expand facilities and develop flexible production. The Department of Defense and Congress should also increase funding to expand domestic production of components critical for deterrence and warfighting in such areas as the Indo-Pacific, such as cruise missile motor capacity expansion (which is important for Harpoon, Tomahawk, LRASM, JASSM, and other long-range missiles), solid rocket motor capacity expansion, energetics, and batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with industry partners, the Department of Defense should also identify and establish stockpiles of the critical parts, finished goods, and commodities needed to meet production requirements for conducting sustained military campaigns against adversaries. In addition, the Department of Defense should identify the stockpiling requirements of critical minerals and components necessary to continue production in cases where international conflict or crisis may inhibit normal functioning of supply chains. The essential role of these stockpiles should be to mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities and ensure the military’s operational freedom and effectiveness. One example is the field-programmable gate array chips that are manufactured in Taiwan and extensively used in U.S. weapons systems, such as F-35s, missiles, and command and control equipment. It will take years to set up the production capability in the United States, so the U.S. government needs to stockpile these chips in case of a Taiwan contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvements to the Workforce and Supply Chains:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States needs to diversify the supplier base and invest in new or different production methods. For example, defense companies could increasingly use cast iron processes, rather than forging. Casting is generally less expensive and more versatile than forging, though it has some potential disadvantages such as less resistance to wear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense should look for opportunities to assist companies with upskilling and reskilling workers by offering incentives. Examples of such actions include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand investments in the Department of Defense’s Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, including by supporting public-private partnerships with colleges, universities, high schools, and other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Invest in institutions and programs that support workforce development to address skill gaps in defense-related manufacturing and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand programs such as Project MFG, photonics certifications, IDREAM4D, the Microelectronics Security Training Center, and Scalable Asymmetric Lifecycle Engagement. The Department of Defense helped establish these programs to support the talent needed for defense-related manufacturing and STEM jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase federal funding for vocational schools that train individuals for defense workforce jobs, such as shipyard welders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense should also consider increasing the use of defense industrial base programs, such as Defense Production Act Title III, to incentivize the expansion of existing U.S. sources and the establishment of new ones. The secretary of the Navy’s maritime statecraft initiative outlines an approach to revitalize commercial shipbuilding by using long-dormant subsidies and other steps to invest in commercial shipyards in the United States, modernize and expand shipbuilding industrial capacity, and develop a more capable and competitive workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;allies-and-partners-1&quot;&gt;Allies and Partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White House needs to focus significant attention on improving and streamlining the Foreign Military Sales (FMS), International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), and other processes and procedures across the U.S. government to expand co-development, co-production, co-sustainment, and other types of cooperation with critical allies and partners in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Significant progress will not happen without White House–level intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For FMS, the Department of Defense should develop a more efficient review process for releasing technology, provide allies and partners with relevant priority capabilities, accelerate acquisition and contracting support, and ensure broad U.S. government support to improve the FMS process. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, working with the services and military departments, should establish a rapid contracting process to reduce the backlog in getting approved FMS cases on contract. The Department of State should consider instituting internal deadlines for bureaus and offices to respond to FMS requests. These deadlines should be standard and understood by stakeholders outside of the Department of State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congressional notifications for FMS should include the date on which the United States received an official request from the partner nation for the times and services included in the notification. This would allow members to understand just how long international partners are waiting for replies to requests. The date used should be the date on which the letter of request was first received by a U.S. security cooperation organization, such as the in-country Security Cooperation Office, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, combatant command staff, or service implementing agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On technology cooperation, the administration should also move quickly to put in place regulations that will provide broad exemptions for the United Kingdom and Australia, much like the United States has provided to Canada. In addition, the U.S. government should increase co-production, co-development, and other arrangements with key allies and partners in such areas as munitions, shipbuilding, and ground vehicles. For example, South Korea and Japan have robust shipbuilding capabilities through companies, such as Daewoo, Hyundai Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Imabari Shipbuilding, that could be useful. There have been several recent examples of co-production with allies and partners, such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) with Poland, Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and GMLRS with Australia, Naval Strike Missile with Norway, and SM-6 components and Tomahawks for Japan and Australia. But these examples are the exception rather than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this effectively will require limiting “Buy America” protectionism, especially for allies that the United States may need to operate and fight with in future military contingencies. Expanding reciprocal defense procurement (RDP) agreements with allies could be helpful. The United States has RDP agreements with Australia and Japan, but not with South Korea. Such provisions as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (better known as the Jones Act) have made it difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to effectively collaborate in such areas as shipbuilding with Japanese, South Korean, or other allies that have sufficient capacity. The act is archaic and counterproductive in a world where defense collaboration is increasingly important with U.S. allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States was involved in setting up recurring engagements with the heads of the ministries of defense and national armaments directors to coordinate support efforts. This body jump-started initiatives to expand ammunition production, establish an international support fund, and organize the delivery and sustainment of critical capabilities. The United States should consider convening the leadership of allied and partner nations within the Indo-Pacific, such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea, to deepen multilateral collaboration on regional industrial base and manufacturing production challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations outlined in this chapter would go a long way to revitalize the U.S. defense industrial base in a competitive security environment. Key recommendations include developing a White House–level body to oversee revitalization of the defense industrial base; ramping up defense production in such areas as multiyear contracting, strategic stockpiles, supply chains, and the workforce; and improving defense industrial cooperation with partners and allies. Unless these types of urgent changes occur, the United States risks weakening deterrence and undermining its warfighting capabilities in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and other regions against China and other competitors, including Russia, Iran, and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has the tools to reinvigorate its industrial base, including an innovative and technologically advanced private sector. The United States has also been in similar positions before — and succeeded. It is worth quoting at length President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s December 1940 speech — one year before Pearl Harbor — arguing that that the United States needs to be an arsenal of democracy. Roosevelt’s words are highly relevant today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear that it is the purpose of the nation to build now with all possible speed every machine, every arsenal, every factory that we need to manufacture our defense material. We have the men, the skill, the wealth, and above all, the will. I am confident that if and when production of consumer or luxury goods in certain industries requires the use of machines and raw materials that are essential for defense purposes, then such production must yield, and will gladly yield, to our primary and compelling purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So I appeal to the owners of plants, to the managers, to the workers, to our own government employees to put every ounce of effort into producing these munitions swiftly and without stint. With this appeal I give you the pledge that all of us who are officers of your government will devote ourselves to the same whole-hearted extent to the great task that lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As planes and ships and guns and shells are produced, your government, with its defense experts, can then determine how best to use them to defend this hemisphere. The decision as to how much shall be sent abroad and how much shall remain at home must be made on the basis of our overall military necessities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must be the great arsenal of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;楊清奇：國安法後專欄作者擔心紅線「唔知點樣劃」，部份認為替蘋果撰文風險特別高&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;楊清奇指日本專欄作家文句不通、立場矛盾 嘆「高層指定我用，我都不得不用」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（5日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第38日審訊。控方傳召前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。庭上提到，專欄作家古德明在2020年7月6日發表文章〈「國安法」下，唯有擱筆〉，楊指很多專欄作家和自由撰稿人「都擔心《國安法》嗰條紅線唔知點樣劃嘅」，又指「有啲作者覺得同《蘋果日報》寫，風險特別高嘅」，所以後來黎要求邀請北京的人和知道中共權鬥內情的人撰文，「咁啲作者都話風險好高，唔敢寫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇第二天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤先作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英提出楊清奇替twitter供稿-予每月1萬元報酬&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英提出楊清奇替Twitter供稿 予每月1萬元報酬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月25日，黎向楊傳送訊息：「李平兄，以律師談過每月從我私人戶口支付一萬天（元）給我作為供 Twitter 報酬」、「小心些是可以的，我將每月安排付款給你。謝謝。」楊當時回覆：「謝謝」，之後又說「卑職自當盡力，共擔輿論之責」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊解釋，黎早前向他提及過，若他替黎的 Twitter 供稿，可以每月獲得1萬元報酬，他後來有按照黎的指示供稿，「不過後來一分錢都冇畀過嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「共擔輿論之責」是什麼意思。楊指黎之前提及過，開設 Twitter 是為了加強自己和《蘋果》的影響力，因而影響輿論，「啫係我供稿，就承擔輿論之責嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇黎智英替外媒撰文-不時查問資料&quot;&gt;楊清奇：黎智英替外媒撰文 不時查問資料&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，2020年5月29日黎向楊傳送一則語音訊息，黎向楊稱：「習近平呢佢嘅鴻圖大業呢⋯⋯佢就有一路一帶啦，2025年啦⋯⋯嗰個就叫做科技乜鬼嘢啦吓」、「你睇睇佢有冇佢啲鴻圖大計啲計劃，可唔可以寫一寫畀我呀？因為我寫緊稿。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊指黎會替外媒撰文，不時會找他搜尋資料，他記得黎曾要求提供關於中共權鬥和南韓光州運動的資料，黎撰寫關於《國安法》文章的時候也有詢問過他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇曾提出邀請高瑜撰文-但不符合黎智英要求-故最後未有執行&quot;&gt;楊清奇：曾提出邀請高瑜撰文 但不符合黎智英要求 故最後未有執行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年6月12日的訊息，楊向黎稱：「老闆，已找北京高瑜、南方都市報前主筆長平，為英文版撰寫即時評論，具體安排我再同盧峯傾。」黎其後表示：「李平，盡量多找有份量有內幕消息的人寫，不只是感想而是有寫（內）情的。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊解釋，訊息中提及的高瑜是一名北京學者，他當時找了高瑜撰稿，但是黎並不滿意，因為他想有作者可以寫中共權鬥內情，而不是感想。被問到最後有否聯絡高瑜，楊表示沒有，因為黎要求有撰寫內幕的作者，而不是評論，所以最後沒有聯絡高瑜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問高瑜會用真名還是筆名寫作。楊指高瑜有時用真名，有時用筆名，但他不記得筆名是什麼。評論角度方面，楊指高瑜會評論中國的新聞，「佢係資深嘅傳媒人嚟嘅，所以評論會中立啲。」控方又問長平是誰。楊指從訊息可見他是《南方都市報》前主筆，與高瑜差不多，都是資深的傳媒人。楊又指，以他理解，黎應該認識高瑜，但他不肯定黎是否認識長平。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到最後有否跟盧峯（前英文版主筆馮偉光）商討，楊表示沒有，「因為黎生已經否定咗我請其他寫稿嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示楊清奇提供六四新聞給黎智英於twitter發布&quot;&gt;訊息顯示楊清奇提供六四新聞給黎智英於Twitter發布&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年6月4日的訊息對話，黎說：「李平，看今天6.4是否（有）些大陸新聞給我上 Twitter. 謝謝。」楊其後回覆：「有兩樣，抗命軍長遺憾未留文字及天安門死難者家屬拜祭，畀咗 Simon」，黎回覆：「好。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊解釋，黎要求他提供新聞在 Twitter 發布，他找到相關新聞後，便傳送給負責管理該帳戶的李兆富（Simon Lee）。控方續展示同日兩則黎的 Twitter 帖文，分別關於當年拒絕執行清場任務命令的解放軍軍長徐勤先，以及天安門母親拜祭受難子女。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊確認上述帖文與他提供給黎的資料有關，又提到：「呢個係天安門母親，佢哋每年六四都會拜祭佢哋仔女嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇李怡年紀大減文章數目-黎智英要求邀劉細良增加稿量-角度支持民主派&quot;&gt;楊清奇：李怡年紀大減文章數目 黎智英要求邀劉細良增加稿量 角度支持民主派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示時任總編輯羅偉光與楊清奇之間的訊息對話。2020年5月13日羅問楊是否認識「沈月」，因為黎智英提到「沈月」；楊則指不認識，只認識「呂月」，其真實身份是高瑜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月31日，羅偉光向楊傳送一段關焯照的英文簡介，叫楊詢問關焯照認為是否可以，楊其後轉述關指可以。訊息顯示關焯照是冠域商業及經濟研究中心主任。楊解釋，關焯照在論壇版有專欄，楊相信羅偉光將關的文章翻譯成英文，然後刊登在英文版網站，所以楊將作者簡介的英文版本傳送給關，而關認為可以。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，羅偉光另傳送政治評論人劉細良的英文簡介給楊，同樣叫楊詢問劉意見；楊之後回覆劉表示可以。楊庭上指劉是《蘋果》論壇版的專欄作家之一，「劉細良都係支持民主派嘅」，已故作家李怡當時表示年紀大，不能夠每日寫一篇稿，所以黎智英透過副社長陳沛敏和楊，邀請劉每周寫多兩篇，最後亦有執行到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蓬佩奧會見王丹等六四倖存者-總編要求楊清奇找作者正面評論分析該會面&quot;&gt;蓬佩奧會見王丹等六四倖存者 總編要求楊清奇找作者正面評論分析該會面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月4日，羅偉光向楊提到時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧會見前學運領袖王丹等六四倖存者，以及表揚「天安門母親」，會作為當天評論節目「焦點燃論」的主題，並會持續跟進相關新聞，羅又要求楊幫忙找人撰寫評論和分析，稍後會翻譯及刊登於英文版。楊之後回覆「都係請中國版同樣搵林和立或夫子評。論壇版周五已約稿」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊表示，不記得最後有否找到人撰寫評論和分析，他亦不知道羅的訊息背後是誰人的主意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當控方問到林和立是誰，楊突表示：「我覺得嗰兩個作者同案情無關嘅」，之後又說：「我係覺得呢兩個作者嘅身份，同呢個檢控無關」，因此認為不需要披露二人身份。控方則改口稱問題原意只是想問二人的寫作角度，而不是要求楊披露二人的真實身份或筆名。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊遂指，林和立及夫子都是比較資深的中國問題專家，「佢哋嘅評論都係比較中立」，並且有固定專欄。至於楊的訊息「專欄安裕李怡關焯照都唔啱」，他解釋因為以上3人都不是六四相關範疇的作家。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅偉光其後訊息稱：「請你幫我搵人寫一篇正面評價此會面及分析，可網上論壇，我主要是翻譯做英文」，楊其後稱「潘小濤寫3點半交稿」。楊將潘的文章傳送給羅之後，羅表示「用蓬佩奧相」。楊確認「正面評價此會面」是指篷佩奧和王丹等人的會面，他亦確認後來有找潘小濤撰文，同事翻譯好文章後，會同時在《蘋果》中文版和英文版網站刊出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇稱馮偉光按照黎智英主意營運英文版-包括關心香港人權狀況&quot;&gt;楊清奇稱馮偉光按照黎智英主意營運英文版 包括關心香港人權狀況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2020年6月馮偉光重新入職《蘋果日報》，擔任英文版主筆，而昨日楊作供時提到二人的辦公室房間相鄰，會不時傾談，控方問馮有否談及英文版事宜。楊則指：「佢（馮）係比較專業嘅人，佢唔會干涉我嘅論壇版，我亦唔會干涉佢嘅英文版」，並指二人獨立工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，馮有否按照黎在飯局中提出的主意去營運英文版。楊稱：「我睇到係有」，以他對英文版的觀察，「的確係關心香港嘅人權狀況嘅。」控方追問英文版有否任何關於中國內地的內容，楊則表示「唔係好肯定」，而他只負責將論壇版的文章傳送給馮，至於揀選文章和翻譯工作則由馮負責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指專欄作家擔心國安法嗰條紅線唔知點樣劃嘅&quot;&gt;楊清奇指專欄作家「擔心《國安法》嗰條紅線唔知點樣劃嘅」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;專欄作家古德明在2020年7月6日撰寫文章〈「國安法」下，唯有擱筆〉，並宣布暫停《蘋果》的專欄。同日，羅向楊傳送訊息：「真係唔寫？」、「咁大壓力？」、「我叫同事寫段新聞」；楊確認古德明不再寫專欄文章，又指：「依家都冇乜來稿，正周圍搵人。請幫手介紹啲」、「都係唔好出新聞，費事嚇親其他作者」；羅則回覆：「唔寫大家都睇到喎，你今日在公司？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊表示，因為很多專欄作家和自由撰稿人「都擔心《國安法》嗰條紅線唔知點樣劃嘅」，他當時亦提議不要報導古德明擱筆一事，以免使其他人擔心，惟羅認為：「佢（古德明）都寫咗出嚟，大家都睇到，唔需要迴避啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊其後在同日訊息中稱：「唉，啲人話到明唔敢幫蘋果寫」、「肥佬一直要我搵多啲北京人寫，人哋真係唔敢。稿酬又唔吸引😂」。楊庭上解釋，「有啲作者覺得同《蘋果日報》寫，風險特別高嘅」，所以後來黎要求邀請北京的人和知道中共權鬥內情的人撰文，「咁啲作者都話風險好高，唔敢寫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又指，上述訊息與他昨日提到黎指示多邀約海外作者撰文相關，因為《國安法》生效之後，本地作者擔心風險會很高，但海外作者則有較少顧忌。控方問到，海外作者是否包括北京的作者。楊則指：「通常海外作者唔包括北京嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇以黎文章觀點作為揀選評論文章的方針&quot;&gt;楊清奇：以黎文章觀點作為揀選評論文章的「方針」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示楊清奇與張劍虹之間的訊息，張在2020年8月3日向楊說：「清奇，政府通緝多名海外人士，說他們違反國安法，如果他們來稿，我們也不方便付稿費。內容當然也按按原定方針把關」，楊回覆「收到🙏」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊解釋，張當時指若果《蘋果》向海外被通緝人士給予稿費，就代表《蘋果》支持他們，所以即使日後收到他們的稿，也不會給予稿費。惟楊補充：「不過始終冇收到海外人士嘅稿嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，若然收到海外人士來稿，會交由誰人負責。楊則指，因為沒有收到他們的稿件，所以很難說得出交給哪個部門負責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，張訊息中提到的「原定方針」是關於什麼。楊則指張並未有在訊息中說明，但是《國安法》生效之後，楊留意到黎在個人專欄裡多次提到《國安法》，「從編輯嘅角度嚟睇，我覺得有啲標題係好好嘅」，令他印象深刻，例如「時間就是武器」、「大時代快將來臨」。楊續指，「大家都知道，黎先生嘅文章，係冇人夠膽改佢嘅，咁呢啲文章我覺得好真實咁反映到佢嘅睇法」，其中有提及制裁的問題，不過黎認為美國和西方國家對中國的制裁不會緩和下來，「因為美國對華政策嘅調整呢，短時間內係唔會逆轉嘅，咁美國嘅制裁對中國嘅經濟影響係好深遠嘅」，因此他覺得黎的文章所述觀點，便是他揀選評論文章的方針，他亦認為「原定方針」可以如此理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又指，譬如2019年反修例運動期間，「咁都喺黎先生嘅文章度睇到一啲原則嘅」，因他的專欄文章逢星期日刊登，「當時嗰啲大規模遊行示威都喺星期日，所以黎生嘅文章好多時都好直接呼籲人去上街」，因此楊揀選評論文章和撰寫社評時，都會以鼓勵人上街示威為主題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（5日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第38日審訊。控方傳召前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。庭上談及日本專欄作家高橋，楊直指他的中文不時有問題，例如在訊息中把前美國總統特朗普說成是「已死總統」。楊又指高橋的立場矛盾，一方面聲稱「港臺日民眾要正對大陸，否則咱們不知不覺中被中共吞掉」，但同時認為日本提出制裁「都係做吓 show、冇用嘅」。楊慨嘆儘管作者文句不通，但是「高層指定我用，我都不得不用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇（筆名李平）第二天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤先作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指黎智英要求邀請馬鐵穎撰寫評論文章&quot;&gt;楊清奇指黎智英要求邀請馬鐵穎撰寫評論文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年9月14日的訊息紀錄，黎智英向楊說：「李平，今日看左丁山專欄講到一位評論專家馬鐵穎，說他的中國和日本評論有料到，是否請他為我們寫評論版。謝謝。」楊庭上解釋，左丁山的專欄既不在評論版也不在「蘋論」刊登，而是在副刊。楊指黎的訊息重點是要求他找馬鐵穎撰寫文章供論壇版刊登。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到馬鐵穎的寫作角度，楊指黎在訊息中形容馬的評論「有料到」，可能是指馬的評論比較尖銳，或者是有時「爆料」、揭露內幕消息，而當時黎很重視中共內幕資料，因此估計黎覺得馬是合適人選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊當時回覆黎：「張劍虹已搵咗日本資深記者甘粕代三撰文，返（逢）周三出。」、「馬鐵穎，我再搵下佢，睇點安排。」楊解釋，甘粕代三是一名日本資深記者，時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹將甘粕代三的聯絡資料，透過時任副社長陳沛敏交給他，並要求他讓甘粕代三撰寫專欄，每星期有固定字數。楊確認「甘粕代三」是日本作家高橋的筆名，因為黎想找日本記者寫日本的評論，而「黎生畀我嘅指示一定要執行」，所以他當時回覆黎會作安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指黎要求多邀請海外作者-故游說中央黨校教授蔡霞撰文&quot;&gt;楊清奇指黎要求多邀請海外作者 故游說中央黨校教授蔡霞撰文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊向黎傳送另一段訊息，指：「轉一段中央黨校教授蔡霞講你同蘋果的對話畀你聽下。正繼續遊說她撰文」，並轉發一段來自蔡霞的語音訊息。楊解釋，蔡霞稱讚《蘋果》的文有正義感，亦留意到《蘋果》很有影響力，「我記得佢講過啲市民為咗支持《蘋果》，《蘋果》啲股價可以一日升到好高嘅。」楊又指，之所以遊說蔡霞撰文，是因為黎要求他多邀請海外作者，雖然黎未有特別指明邀請哪些作者，但楊有見蔡當時已在美國定居，所以便透過朋友聯絡到蔡，邀請她寫文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問蔡霞是否符合黎要求的作者，楊確認，並指蔡是中央黨校教授，她到達美國之後，有批評中國的人權狀況，也有關注香港的狀況，「所以想黎生親自出面邀請」，因成功機會較高。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，黎傳送了一段語音訊息，之後楊表示會轉發給蔡霞。庭上展示語音訊息謄本，黎向蔡稱：「謝謝你的美言，我們做香港人一定會鬥爭下去，這是我們的本份。」、「請你有時間為我們寫社評呀」、「我也很崇拜你的，希望你幫我們寫寫你對中國的看法，因為你對中國的了解是沒人跟你比拼的，謝謝你」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指黎智英作為老闆有權決定誰人撰寫社評&quot;&gt;楊清奇指黎智英作為老闆有權決定誰人撰寫社評&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何黎會請蔡霞撰寫「社評」，楊則指黎是想邀請蔡撰寫評論文章，但可能講錯為「社評」，「當然黎生係老闆，佢有權決定邊個寫社評」，又指顏純鈎也是經過黎的「提名」之後，可以撰寫《蘋果》社評，張劍虹亦有通知他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，就顏純鈎撰寫社評一事，為何張劍虹要通知楊？楊指因為他撰寫社評的時間要調整，本來他負責星期二和五的社評，但是顏想寫星期五的社評，所以「我就變成要寫星期六嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎於2020年12月被捕、被起訴及還柙，問楊會如何形容此後張劍虹的角色。楊指黎還柙之後，張是「最高負責人」，不單只在經營方面，也在《蘋果日報》、網上版和英文版上，「所有出版都係喺佢監督之下啦」，至於在黎還柙之前，則是由黎負責這個監督角色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹查問高橋為何稱要停專欄-楊清奇反指高橋中文有問題&quot;&gt;張劍虹查問高橋為何稱要停專欄 楊清奇反指高橋中文有問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年12月13日張劍虹傳送給楊的訊息：「主筆，高橋先生說他在論壇的稿要停？是否寫得太密或什麼原因？」；楊回覆：「他說要停嗎？未同我講」；張說：「他是說你是不是想停他專欄，我說我不知道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊庭上提到，通常由黎和陳沛敏等高層指定的評論文章作者，「我會好小心去處理，好認真去跟進嘅」，否則「一有少少嘅問題，佢哋就直情去搵高層去投訴嘅，咁我就好被動嘅」。他續指，該次他與高橋之間有誤會，「佢嘅中文不時有問題，因為佢係日本人嚟嘅，啫係我哋會話『美國前總統特朗普』，佢就演繹成『美國已故總統』。」他又說：「咁同事都好辛苦，要同佢執清楚。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊提及另一次事件，他曾告訴高橋，「佢講太多歷史，讀者係唔想睇嘅，我希望佢轉主題，佢就同張劍虹先生投訴，話要停咗佢嘅專欄。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指張劍虹重視日本於亞洲地位-要求給予高橋較高稿費&quot;&gt;楊清奇指張劍虹重視日本於亞洲地位 要求給予高橋較高稿費&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊指，黎在「飯盒會」上指示多找外國作者，「張劍虹先生可能覺得我嗰時進展唔好啦，所以親自搵咗一個日本記者為我哋寫稿」，張其後將高橋的聯絡方式給楊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊指，從張的訊息可見，「佢係好重視美國重返亞洲之後，嗰個日本嘅地位係好重要嘅，應該寫多啲日中關係、日本喺亞洲嘅地位。」楊又提到，張要求楊支付高橋較高稿費，正常的稿費是每一篇1,200元，但高橋的稿費調高至1,600元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指高橋文句不通-稱特朗普為已死總統嘆高層指定我用我都不得不用&quot;&gt;楊清奇指高橋文句不通 稱特朗普為「已死總統」嘆「高層指定我用，我都不得不用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年12月10日高橋與楊清奇之間的訊息，高橋稱：「但我深信日府根本不會制裁林鄭等。你地知道日本這個太監國家，安保靠美，經濟靠中。加上打出強烈制裁的美國瘋總統已沒命，日本政府已開始跟拜登溝通，怎會聽已死總統命令。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊庭上直指：「所以個問題就喺呢度，啲作者中文都唔通嘅」，但是「高層指定我用，我都不得不用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指高橋立場矛盾認為日本制裁做吓show冇用嘅&quot;&gt;楊清奇指高橋立場矛盾、認為日本制裁「做吓show、冇用嘅」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示楊當時回覆高橋，稱「你可以考慮評論有關新聞。但你的觀點恐怕難以被蘋果多數讀者認同。制裁不是已死總統的命令，是美國聲援港人」。高橋則回應：「不，特朗普只是說說而已，這松原仁也是。也可以專訪他。我覺得傳媒任務要分為兩種。當然要討好讀者，另一半要啟發。我特意寫港臺讀者逆耳的話題。但港臺日民眾要正對大陸，否則咱們不知不覺中被中共吞掉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊解釋，「因為佢講話『日本制裁只係議員做 show』，咁我就話畀佢知，《蘋果日報》讀者應該比較認同制裁嘅，咁我都話制裁唔係『已死總統嘅命令』，而係聲援香港人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又指：「佢自己好多時矛盾，講唔清楚」，例如高橋在訊息中稱「港臺日民眾要正對大陸，否則咱們不知不覺中被中共吞掉」，「但佢寫稿有時唔係咁嘅態度，啫係『日本都係做吓 show、冇用嘅』」，而且有時不是太認同《蘋果》取態，「啫我有時唔知係佢表達嘅問題，定係佢嘅立場係有矛盾。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及《蘋果》對於制裁的立場，楊指上述他向高橋提及的觀點，乃「同高層和讀者口味，都係一致」。楊指「高層」包括黎智英和張劍虹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;微調方向文件指蘋果受壓-故棄用某些字眼&quot;&gt;「微調方向」文件指《蘋果》受壓 故棄用某些字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，警方在楊的電腦中發現一份題為「《蘋果》受壓 微調方向」的文件，當中提到時任警務處處長鄧炳強不點名批評《蘋果》，表示考慮以煽惑罪檢控傳媒，加上《文匯報》和《大公報》接連發表社論呼籲取締《蘋果》，《東方日報》亦要求調查壹傳媒股價異常波動，終於令《蘋果》受到壓力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文件第一點提到顏純鈎（筆名方圓）查詢可否使用「黑警」一詞，張劍虹則表示：「以目前時勢，黑警等字眼還是不用較好，並要求主筆李平把好關。」第二點提到羅偉光發出指令棄用「武漢肺炎」。第三點提到「員工士氣受挫」，有論壇版編輯提出辭職，因父母擔心其安全，而張劍虹只回應「盡力做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊供稱，這份文件是關於用字的調整，他通常不會修改來稿，所以要及時通知作者公司做法改變，讓他們在撰寫文章時自行修改字眼，而不需楊修改。楊指他只會把第一及第二點傳送給論壇版作者，但如果有人關心編輯政策，便會連同第三點傳送。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇獲告知蘋果社論和報導棄用武漢肺炎&quot;&gt;楊清奇獲告知《蘋果》社論和報導棄用「武漢肺炎」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示副社長陳沛敏於2021年4月18日傳送給楊的訊息：「老總決定，今起報道不用『武肺』，因此社論也不用，論壇則作者自決。編輯會通知社論其他作者。」陳亦轉發時任總編輯羅偉光的訊息，稱：「各位，我打倒昨日的我：武漢肺炎這題 tag，即日起暫時唔用，水印亦唔用。以『最新疫情』、『疫苗接種』、『防疫措施』、『限聚措施』、『變種病毒』、『社區爆發』、『隱形傳播』呢幾個題 tag 代替。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊解釋，因為海外作者未必緊貼香港新聞，如果他們問起用字，便可以向他們解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指結束一黨專政在香港嗌咗幾十年惟大公報文章演繹為要推翻執政黨&quot;&gt;楊清奇指「結束一黨專政」在香港「嗌咗幾十年」惟《大公報》文章演繹為要推翻執政黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹於2021年4月21日向楊清奇傳送一張《大公報》文章截圖，當中指稱《蘋果》鼓吹顛覆國家政權，張問楊：「主筆，你印象中我們社評有寫過這些？」楊表示「國安法出台前可能有」，張覆道「出台前就不算違法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊認為當時張可能擔心社評觸犯《國安法》，不過他補充：「其實（《大公報》）文章入面有啲用詞係扭曲咗，例如『結束一黨專政』呢個口號，喺香港真係嗌咗幾十年，佢就演繹成為要推翻國家執政黨。」他又表示上述與張劍虹的對答反映他當時的理解，因為他理解《國安法》是沒有追溯力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指黎智英獄中信提醒同事要小心啲&quot;&gt;楊清奇指黎智英獄中信提醒同事「要小心啲」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到2021年5月舉行的《蘋果》員工大會，張劍虹在該次場合中發言。楊確認他當日亦在場，但會上討論並沒有直接觸及論壇版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅偉光於2021年5月25日傳送訊息給楊：「黎生有來信，想直接給你看看。」控方問該封信內容是什麼。楊表示：「我記得佢（黎）有喺信中提醒同事要小心啲」，但不記得具體字眼。楊相信該信是寫給羅偉光，「可能羅偉光認為我負責論壇版要小心啲，所以畀我睇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂向楊出示一份載有黎獄中信的文件，惟楊庭上閱讀文件後，表示它並非羅偉光給他看的那一封信，不過信中同樣有提到「要小心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ea26ytC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（4日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第37日審訊。控方傳召前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。楊供稱，黎智英會透過「飯盒會」向《蘋果》各個部門給予指示，會議期間並不會有意見交流或討論。例如他曾提出《國安法》出台後論壇版作者不足夠的問題，後來黎在會上講：「如果香港作者唔夠，咁咪搵海外作者囉。」楊又指，雖然黎的個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」並非刊於楊主理的論壇版，但是楊必須閱讀黎的文章以了解其立場取態，以免論壇版刊登了一些與黎取態不一致的文章，「論壇版一定唔會同佢作對嘅，一定唔會反對佢嘅。」楊提到彭斯於2018年10月發表演講時提及美國對華政策，黎當時認為演講內容意味「美國反枱」，楊表示：「我覺得佢喺嗰個時候開始，黎先生嘅政治立場就變得激進啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇出庭作供-1998年加入蘋果中國版&quot;&gt;楊清奇出庭作供 1998年加入《蘋果》中國版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏上周作供完畢。控方今開始傳召前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他由3名懲教人員的帶領下，循法庭特別通道進入庭內，其後以非宗教形式宣誓。控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤開始作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，楊在中國內地出生，在內地大學接受教育，於1993年來港定居。楊於1998年加入《蘋果日報》，當時任職中國版高級記者。楊確認。他續稱，他後來晉升為中國版助理採訪主任，之後晉升為採訪主任，其後擔任《蘋果》副主筆，最後在2015年升任為主筆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月10日警方首度拘捕黎智英及搜查壹傳媒大樓，但當時楊並未被捕。2021年6月23日，楊於其住所被警方拘捕，之後被起訴及帶上法庭提堂。後來楊承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全罪」，現正還柙等候判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇日常工作負責撰寫社評和管理論壇版&quot;&gt;楊清奇：日常工作負責撰寫社評和管理論壇版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊供稱，他日常工作主要有兩項，一是撰寫《蘋果》社評，刊登於實體報紙的「蘋論」欄目；另一項工作是負責管理論壇版，而每逢星期六論壇版會有主題評論，由不同作者撰寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊稱，刊登於《蘋果》網站的評論文章比刊登於實體報紙的文章為多，因網上版有其他同事負責，除了他本人可批准文章刊登於網上版之外，時任總編輯羅偉光亦可以作出批核，而不需要經過楊的同意。雖然可能會出現分歧，但他表示會「尊重同事意見」，而這種情況亦很少發生。但就實體報紙的論壇版而言，嚴格來說只有他能夠批准哪些文章可以刊登。實體報紙的論壇版文章會被上載至《蘋果》網站的論壇版，若果他發現有的文章沒有被上載，亦會叫負責網站的同事去處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇稱國安法後評論作者不足-黎智英提出找海外作者&quot;&gt;楊清奇稱國安法後評論作者不足 黎智英提出找海外作者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊清奇稱，平日會透過 WhatsApp、電郵和正式會議與黎智英溝通，有時黎亦會叫他到其辦公室的房間內商討。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又表示，對於2020年7月的一次「飯盒會」印象最深刻。在每次舉行「飯盒會」之前，時任副社長陳沛敏都會要求出席者透過訊息給她，表明「我想喺嗰個會上，向黎先生請示一啲問題嘅」。楊記得在該次會議之前，他曾提出《國安法》出台後論壇版作者不足夠的問題，所以後來黎在會上講：「如果香港作者唔夠，咁咪搵海外作者囉。」至於其他同事的意見，楊則不太記得，看到會議紀錄才會記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示2020年7月17日的「飯盒會」會議討論重點，由陳沛敏上載至 Slack 群組。其中一點提到「多約海外作者」，楊確認他談論的正是該次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇飯盒會上無討論-只有黎智英給予回應和指示&quot;&gt;楊清奇：飯盒會上無「討論」 只有黎智英給予回應和指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又表示「會議討論重點」中的「討論」，字眼上「唔係咁合適」，因為開會的時候，基本上是各個部門請示黎，然後黎會給予指示，「因為係黎先生畀回應、畀指示，係冇討論嘅。」楊稱他亦不會干預其他部門的問題，「其他同事提出嘅問題，我基本上都唔會插手嘅」；反之，楊提出的問題，其他同事也不會給予意見，只有黎會給予意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到會上有否任何意見交流，楊稱沒有，所以會議紀錄不是「討論重點」，而是「黎先生嘅回應」，而且「佢（黎）嘅回應，我認為係指示嚟嘅」，並且有需要執行。例如楊提出的作者不足問題，時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹得悉之後，曾經協助尋找新作者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指海外作者對政府批評較尖銳-較少擔心國安法影響&quot;&gt;楊清奇指海外作者對政府批評較尖銳 較少擔心國安法影響&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，海外作者的特別之處在哪裡。楊則指，「海外作者冇咁擔心《國安法》對佢哋嘅影響，佢哋提出嘅問題、對政府嘅批評比較尖銳，冇咁多擔心。」至於黎指示「多約海外作者」，楊確認後來有執行到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過，楊稱他並不是每次「飯盒會」都出席，而是在受到邀請的時候才會出席，他亦不清楚出席頻率，因他只是一個部門主管，而非管理層。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇飯盒會目的是收集各部門問題-然後黎智英給予指示&quot;&gt;楊清奇：飯盒會目的是收集各部門問題 然後黎智英給予指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「飯盒會」舉行的目的是什麼。楊指是為了收集各個部門的問題，然後黎會作出指示。控方又問楊有否執行黎的指示，楊則表示：「一定要執行嘅」，例如黎指示邀請多些海外作者撰文，「社長張劍虹先生覺得我做得唔好，所以佢自己去搵囉。」楊又指黎在「飯盒會」上給予指示後，社長和副社長會作出跟進。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊指，除了邀請海外作者之外，黎作出的指示包括「有指定一啲文章畀我，有指定一啲一作者畀我嘅」，因在反修例的時候，「好明顯有啲係支持抗爭嘅文章。」在《國安法》出台之後，黎亦有向楊指定一些不滿《國安法》的作者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇必須閱讀黎智英專欄-比口頭指示更明確-論壇版一定唔會同佢作對&quot;&gt;楊清奇：必須閱讀黎智英專欄 比口頭指示更明確 論壇版「一定唔會同佢作對」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年2至3月，政府推出引渡條例修訂後，黎並沒有向論壇版直接給予指示，但黎同時有在個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」撰文，而在文章中「佢有好清晰嘅態度嘅」。楊指，雖然黎的專欄刊登於副刊而非論壇版，但他作為論壇版主管，必須閱讀所有黎的文章，「佢喺論壇版嘅文章，當然比佢口頭嘅指示更加明確清晰嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊續指，若他不閱讀黎的文章，「如果論壇版出嚟嘅文章，同黎先生嘅意見唔同，就唔得嘅」，因為「論壇版一定唔會同佢作對嘅，一定唔會反對佢嘅」。若然黎在其專欄文章中表態，「更加要跟隨佢。」楊亦確認他作為《蘋果》主筆，一直有閱讀黎的專欄文章，並跟從黎的立場取態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇黎智英認為2018年彭斯演講代表美國反枱-自此立場變得激進&quot;&gt;楊清奇：黎智英認為2018年彭斯演講代表「美國反枱」 自此立場變得激進&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年7月《蘋果》報導黎智英會見時任美國副總統彭斯，楊稱在事前事後均未有與黎談論此旅程，因與論壇版無關，「有關會面我都係睇報紙先知道。」不過楊提到2018年10月，彭斯在哈德遜研究所發表演講時提及美國對華政策，其後黎透過 WhatsApp 告訴楊，認為彭斯的演講意味「美國反枱」，即美國帶領日本和其他國家改變對華政策，「美國係乘住中國弱勢嘅時候落井下石」，楊表示：「我覺得佢喺嗰個時候開始，黎先生嘅政治立場就變得激進啲。」所以反修例出台後，《蘋果》的報導角度變得激進，「《國安法》生效之後，唔再追求平衡報導喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，《蘋果》在《國安法》生效之前已有報導制裁事宜，論壇版亦有文章提及。楊認為這與彭斯的演說有關，因為彭斯的演講代表著美國整個對華政策的改變，黎傳送給楊的訊息可見，黎見到對華政策的轉變，並且能夠把握這轉變的機遇。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The arrest of @JimmyLaiApple in Hong Kong is deeply offensive &amp;amp; an affront to freedom loving people around the world.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另提到，《蘋果》在2019年10月第二次報導黎智英訪美，並會見了時任美國眾議院議長佩洛西。楊同樣表示事前並不知道此事，在事後看相關新聞才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊稱，對於《蘋果》報導角度的主要印象，是「鼓勵抗爭，希望政府撤回條例」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方庭上透露楊清奇作供完畢後，會傳召另一名「從犯證人」李宇軒出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NYf7zWv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（4日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第37日審訊。控方傳召前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。楊供稱，黎智英於2020年5至6月期間三度邀請他、其他時事評論員和專欄作者，到其住所食飯，期間黎提及想籌備英文版，希望將香港情況告訴美國人，並且「希望美國政府採取更強硬嘅措施」，包括制裁。楊又提到，黎特別強調要找認識中共高層權鬥內幕消息的人撰文，以增加英文版的影響力。在6月的一次飯局中，出席者關注黎會否被捕，楊憶述黎表明「唔驚」，並稱：「如果佢被拉呢，咁更加證明到中國和香港政府對人權嘅打壓，同時都係打壓新聞自由，佢相信美國、英國同歐洲係唔會坐視不理嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早開始傳召前《蘋果日報》主筆楊清奇（筆名李平），以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他由3名懲教人員的帶領下，循法庭特別通道進入庭內，其後以非宗教形式宣誓。控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤先作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指蘋果批評中國政府隱瞞疫情-搞到世界大亂&quot;&gt;楊清奇指《蘋果》批評中國政府隱瞞疫情 「搞到世界大亂」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊供稱，他與時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹、副社長陳沛敏和總編輯羅偉光不時透過文字訊息溝通，惟與時任動新聞平台總監張志偉則比較少溝通，因他負責網上平台的動新聞。楊又指，他與前英文版主筆馮偉光（筆名「盧峯」）比較多溝通，因為二人在辦公室的房間相鄰，會不時傾談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iNvcNz7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果日報》英文版主筆馮偉光，筆名「盧峯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊指，2020年初爆發新冠肺炎疫情，《蘋果》的報導角度「主要係批評中國政府隱瞞疫情，搞到世界大亂嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《蘋果》於2020年5月以頭版發起「一人一信救香港」行動，楊表示他沒有參與籌備，黎事前也沒有與他談論，直至登報後楊才看到。楊續指，後來黎於2020年12月被捕及還柙後，在一次由張劍虹主持的「飯盒會」上，張指「一人一信救香港」是黎的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇黎智英邀請專欄作者等人參與飯局-就英文版及twitter給予意見&quot;&gt;楊清奇：黎智英邀請專欄作者等人參與飯局 就英文版及Twitter給予意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，《蘋果》英文版在2020年5月面世。楊表示此前知悉《蘋果》會推出英文版，因為黎當時邀請他及其他時事評論員和專欄作者，到其住所食飯，期間黎提及想籌備英文版，希望《蘋果》英文版可在美國擴大影響力，而且「將香港人權受到壓迫、《國安法》可能出台，可以話畀美國人知」。黎又指以當時形勢而言，不只美國政府，一般大眾和政治人物都會關注香港，所以希望在座人士能提供意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示楊清奇與黎的秘書之間的訊息紀錄，顯示楊曾分別於2020年5月6日、5月19日和6月23日，獲邀到黎的住所出席飯局。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇黎智英冀國際關注香港人權被打壓-以牽制中國政府&quot;&gt;楊清奇：黎智英冀國際關注香港人權被打壓 以牽制中國政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就5月6日，即第一次的飯局，訊息顯示受邀人士包括林本利、桑普、盧峯（馮偉光）、楊懷康（筆名古立）、程翔及林和立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊憶述黎在席間表示要設立 Twitter 帳戶，籲在座人士提供新聞和評論，供他在 Twitter 發表，「佢希望通過呢個社交媒體，擴大佢嘅影響力，擴大《蘋果日報》嘅影響力。」被問到黎有否表明想要哪類型的新聞，楊指黎在飯局上未有明確提及，但是後來黎有向他提出要求，指「譬如抗爭嘅新聞，六四嘅新聞」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊續指，黎希望國際關注香港的情況，因當時香港人權受到打壓，如果國際社會有更多關注的話，能夠牽制到中國政府。至於牽制的手法，楊指：「當時講得多係制裁嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇當時同意黎觀點-制裁令政府推遲國安法-社會成本較低&quot;&gt;楊清奇：當時同意黎觀點 制裁令政府推遲國安法 社會成本較低&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就5月19日，即第二次飯局，訊息顯示受邀者除了楊清奇之外，還包括桑普、盧峯（馮偉光）、林和立及李兆富（Simon Lee）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊憶述該次飯局中，黎表示美國政府和人民都會關注香港的情況，他希望開設《蘋果》英文版，幫助美國人更加了解香港情況，「希望美國政府採取更強硬嘅措施，咁《蘋果》英文版有多啲呢啲內容，咁美國政府就可以做嘢。」控方追問黎想美國政府採取什麼行動？楊指：「當時講得最多係制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又表示，他個人認為制裁官員從而令政府撤回修例及推遲《國安法》生效，「咁成個社會付出嘅成本係比較低啲嘅」，因此在《國安法》出台前後，當黎談及制裁時，「我喺蘋論版（《蘋果》社論）都係持一種支持嘅態度嘅。」他確認當時同意黎的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇黎智英強調找作者寫中共內部權鬥消息-以增英文版影響力&quot;&gt;楊清奇：黎智英強調找作者寫中共內部權鬥消息 以增英文版影響力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問飯局期間有否討論《蘋果》英文版的報導角度。楊指沒有，不過他提到黎後來以 WhatsApp 傳送訊息，特別強調要找認識中共高層權鬥的人撰文，並非常強調要懂得權鬥內幕和消息，「唔係淨係識得去評論嘅。」楊又指，「佢（黎）認為英文版可以𢭃多啲料呢，影響力就會大啲嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示黎的 WhatsApp 訊息，黎於2020年6月12日向楊說：「李平，盡量多找有份量有內幕消息的人寫，不只是感想而是有寫情（況）的。謝謝。」、「李平，可以找到人分析習李權鬥浮面的內情嗎？謝謝。」楊當時回覆「收到。再努力」。楊庭上確認相關訊息，並指文章可以中文撰寫，之後會有同事翻譯成英文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示另一段訊息，黎於2020年6月30日向楊說：「李平，中共權鬥問題是否有料，及經濟及水災情況如何？謝謝。」楊當時回覆：「Sorry，權鬥未收到料。水災和三峽沒有炒作般嚴重。」黎回覆：「很好。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊庭上解釋，「佢（黎）催得我好緊，但係我做唔到囉」，所以回覆黎稱可以嘗試，但是最終仍然找不到符合黎要求的作者。他形容黎很想發布中共內部權鬥的消息，以增加《蘋果》英文版的影響力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於訊息提及的「水災和三峽」，楊指當時海外媒體炒作內地三峽和水災的新聞，「炒得幾嚴重，話三峽就嚟冧，咁我當時收到消息話冇咁嚴重，咁唔想《蘋果日報》炒作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到出席飯局的盧峯、桑普和李兆富有否提出意見，楊表示不記得，「我連自己講咗咩，我都唔記得嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇轉述黎智英稱不怕被捕-若被捕即證明到中國和港府打壓人權&quot;&gt;楊清奇轉述黎智英稱不怕被捕 若被捕即證明到中國和港府打壓人權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於2020年6月23日進行的第三次飯局，訊息紀錄顯示受邀人士包括楊清奇、盧峯、姜國元、桑普、楊懷康和李兆富。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊記得席上未有談及《蘋果》英文版和黎的 Twitter，不過因為當時是接近《國安法》生效的時候，他們有討論到《國安法》。楊指出席者關注黎會否被捕，「佢（黎）話唔驚嘅，如果佢被拉呢，咁更加證明到中國和香港政府對人權嘅打壓，同時都係打壓新聞自由，佢相信美國、英國同歐洲係唔會坐視不理嘅。」楊轉述黎認為只有實施制裁，才能有助改善香港的人權狀況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，黎曾否提及制裁的對象。楊則指「冇好具體嘅名單」，但在公眾意見的角度而言，制裁對象主要是北京主要負責香港事務的官員，以及香港主要官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指桑普主張港獨-黎被捕後指示邀撰文&quot;&gt;楊清奇指桑普主張港獨 黎被捕後指示邀撰文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及受邀者的身份，楊指林本利是由張劍虹邀請撰寫「蘋論」的作者。楊指桑普則「傾向支持港獨」，所以他有很多文章都沒有辦法刊登出來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又提到，黎被捕之後，曾經透過高層指示他邀請桑普撰寫專欄，其後他向副社長陳沛敏表達，桑普經常撰文主張港獨，不適合刊登，因為《蘋果》通常不會修改專欄文章，「佢寫嘅稿我哋用唔用都麻煩」，陳表示會跟社長張劍虹反映。楊指後來高層未有再提起桑普，估計「佢哋上面接受咗我嘅提議，就冇再講喇」。不過《蘋果》過去曾經刊登桑普的文章，主要立場是批評中國共產黨和香港政府，早期曾提到制裁，但後期便沒有提起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊清奇指黎智英受訪時公開李兆富負責twitter帳戶-李因憂慮風險而辭職&quot;&gt;楊清奇指黎智英受訪時公開李兆富負責Twitter帳戶 李因憂慮風險而辭職&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於李兆富，楊指他的筆名是「利世民」，亦替黎智英管理 Twitter 帳戶。不過楊指，黎在接受外媒採訪時透露李有份管理其 Twitter 帳戶，李之後以 WhatsApp 傳送該受訪片段給楊，「佢覺得 Twitter 會唔會有啲嘢係觸犯咗《國安法》嘅，咁黎生公開咗由佢負責嘅話，佢係有風險」，所以李「覺得唔舒服，就唔做喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

Two years on from Putin’s illegal invasion, what more can be done?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 23, President Joe Biden announced over 500 new sanctions on Russia and parts of its military production apparatus following the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny one week earlier. The U.S. was joined by the European Union, which issued its own set of sanctions against nearly 200 Russian individuals and entities. Although these sanctions — and the many that have come before them — appropriately demonstrate to the international community the West’s disapproval of Russia’s military effort and Moscow’s conduct more broadly, the effectiveness of these sanctions regimes will be severely limited unless the U.S. and its partners adjust their views about sanctions busting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than two decades focusing on Iran’s and North Korea’s sanctions-busting machinery, Western officials have now turned their attention to Russia’s keen ability to evade economic, financial, and trade sanctions — whether busting through the oil price cap or illegally acquiring microelectronics to support its war in Ukraine. Two common questions percolating in foreign policy circles in Washington, Brussels, and London are what lessons can the West learn from Iran’s and North Korea’s years of sanctions evasion, and how can these governments apply those lessons to Russia. What these discussions fail to consider, however, is that it is Iran and North Korea that draw upon Russia’s decades of embargo- and sanctions-busting expertise — not the other way around. Consequently, by focusing too myopically on techniques and tactics, policymakers are missing the big picture when it comes to addressing sanctions circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the earliest years of the Cold War through the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia has shown itself to be extremely capable of procuring embargoed Western technology. The post-Cold War era saw oligarchs exploit loosely regulated aspects of the global financial system to move, hide, and launder wealth, while those engaged in organized crime and illicit arms dealers flourished during the 1990s in an environment tolerant of criminality. The net effect is a long history of evading restrictive measures and a well-oiled machine capable of circumventing Western sanction regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To effectively target Russia’s ability to circumvent Western sanctions, the West must focus on dismantling the infrastructure that permits transnational crime to flourish, better integrate their individual sanctions regimes, and close long-standing gaps in global trade and finance regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-cocom-to-orlan&quot;&gt;From CoCom to Orlan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice in August 2023 indicted a Russian-German national for his role in an expansive illicit procurement network designed to supply Russia’s war machine with export-controlled microelectronics. The indictment is only the latest in a growing series of enforcement actions by Western officials trying to fix a leaky export control and sanctions regime targeting Russia’s military industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Moscow’s ability to acquire needed parts covered by sanctions should not be surprising. From the earliest days of the Soviet Union, Moscow has been dependent on imported technology. In the aftermath of World War II, as East-West tensions unfolded, the U.S. and key Western allies established the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) — an early attempt to prevent Western military technologies from entering the Eastern Bloc, primarily the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The informal nature of the CoCom, its lack of enforcement mechanisms, and diverging interests between the U.S. and its European allies led operatives in Moscow and Western businesses to easily circumvent the West’s restrictions and embargoes. Often, controlled technology flowed into the Soviet Union via reparations from Germany, across the initially porous inner German border and through the Warsaw Pact states, and through other loosely regulated hubs of convenience that were not strictly CoCom members, such as Hong Kong and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Soviet Union’s procurement of restricted technology and machinery was once a highly secretive affair, now-declassified reports shed new light on the methods and tactics the country used to evade Western controls. A CIA report from 1977, among others from that time, describes transhipment through third-party intermediaries, the use of fraudulent shipping documentation, and the use of shell companies to obtain integrated circuits and semiconductors from the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most successful tactics, according to the report, was Moscow’s exploitation of legitimate Western firms and falsified end-user certifications. In essence, Western firms would sell restricted technologies to legitimate and approved buyers in foreign countries, only to have those technologies transhipped to the Soviet Union. This might sound familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A December 2022 joint investigation by the Royal United Services Institute and Reuters detailed how Russia has evaded Western export controls and sanctions during the war in Ukraine to acquire microelectronics for its unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) — including the Orlan-10 — which the country has used with devastating effectiveness. Mirroring its Soviet-era methods, Moscow has relied on overseas, state-backed procurement networks to illegally acquire export-controlled technologies often manufactured and produced by legitimate Western firms. As the Orlan report notes, Russia has used entities based in the United States, Europe, China, South Korea, and Hong Kong to procure Western technologies for the UAV system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of these cases keeps growing and is reflected in U.S. designations. Just recently following Navalny’s death and marking two years since Putin’s invasion, the U.S. Department of Commerce added over 90 companies to its denied entities list for helping Russia obtain restricted microelectronics, continuing to highlight the difficulties of export-control enforcement. The Treasury and State Departments also added over 500 entities to its sanctions lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-moscow-mafiya&quot;&gt;The Moscow “Mafiya”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 2001, William Weschler, former special adviser to the U.S. secretary of the treasury during the Bush administration, described the growing risks of transnational crime and corruption, noting that “[n]owhere was this more evident than in the post-Soviet states. Funds from organized crime, government kickbacks, widespread tax evasion, the rape of natural resources, and old-fashioned legal capital flight all went to banks promising secrecy.” He further notes that in 1998, in the midst of the ruble’s financial crisis, over $74 billion moved from Russian banks to offshore havens, like Nauru and Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the early 2000s, Washington was taking note of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s burgeoning relationship with the country’s oligarchs — the prominent businessmen who accumulated billions of dollars in wealth during Russia’s economic liberalization throughout the 1990s. This prompted concerns over the rise of a perceived “mafia state,” the influence of its capture of strategic industries, and the role that the international financial system played in facilitating corruption, tax evasion, and money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common scheme for some of the country’s largest enterprises was to move profits offshore to jurisdictions like Cyprus, through complex shell companies, only to return the money disguised as foreign investment, which was taxed at lower rates. In fact, a 2019 report by the International Monetary Fund found that nearly 25 percent of Russia’s real foreign direct investment was actually domestically owned — a truly massive share compared to mostly negligible amounts in developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheap sale of state resources in the early 1990s also saw the growth of state-connected smuggling operations, such as the global arms trafficking operation overseen by Viktor Bout. Bout took advantage of cheap cargo planes to run a logistical operation moving cheap arms to warlords, dictators, terrorist groups, and war zones around the world. He too relied on the infrastructure and laxity facilitating the more legitimate side of globalization — registering companies and planes in jurisdictions with weak oversight and exploiting loose regulatory environments and jurisdictions rife with corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall takeaway is that Russia has benefited from decades of honing its smuggling, illicit procurement, and money laundering craft. Asking what Russia can learn from sanctions evaders like North Korea and Iran is the wrong question. Rather, experts and policymakers should be asking why has Russia — and its renewed partners North Korea and Iran — been able to continue to exploit the same trade and financial infrastructure over the past 30 years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is neither convenient nor comfortable for the West. The global infrastructures that allow Russia, Iran, and North Korea to skirt sanctions are the same that allow narcotics trafficking, terrorist financing, and corruption, among other illicit industries, to proliferate and flourish. Leaky export-control regimes, jurisdictions that permit anonymous or pseudo-anonymous corporate structures, and weak legal institutions are all key contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems are not new or unknown to policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, international organizations such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — the international body responsible for setting anti-financial crime standards — have become increasingly influential and vocal in establishing robust anti-money laundering norms and bringing much-needed attention to threats to the global financial system. In April 2022, the FATF published its “Report on the State of Effectiveness and Compliance With the FATF Standards,” which shows that, overall, countries have made significant progress increasing technical compliance with its anti-money laundering recommendations — satisfactory compliance has risen to 76 percent, compared to 36 percent in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is important to recognize that Russia is a criminal state and has little regard for a rules-based system. In February 2023, the FATF suspended Russia’s membership in the organization, noting that Russia’s actions “run counter to the FATF core principles aiming to promote security, safety, and the integrity of the global financial system.” While this can be viewed as a significant political move, it has about as much pragmatic effect as the FATF asking Pablo Escobar’s drug cartel to implement anti-money laundering standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will continue to do what it has shown it is fully capable of doing for decades — finding and exploiting weak points within global trade and financial systems. Unfortunately, there is no quick fix. Time and again, strong legal and democratic institutions prove the best antidote to curing the rot that permits transnational crime — including the circumvention of sanctions — to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can be done in the short term? First, states imposing sanctions against Russia should broaden transnational enforcement cooperation — especially in areas that may not be directly associated with sanctions. Consider, for example, the Global South’s general reluctance to implement Western sanctions against Russia. Rather than coaxing or threatening these countries with extraterritorial sanctions, substantive engagement over counter-transnational crime enforcement may ultimately help achieve the same objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even China recently noted its willingness to enhance bilateral cooperation, share intelligence, provide mutual legal assistance, and hunt down and recover illicit assets related to transnational organized crime. While these are areas not directly related to sanctions implementation, they are inextricably tied to the infrastructures that enable Russia’s sanctions circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the corporate service providers, attorneys, and accountants that Russia and others rely on to circumvent sanctions should be held to account. The Biden administration recently announced its intention to target financial institutions anywhere in the world that facilitate significant transactions that contribute to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. While it remains to be seen whether and to what extent the White House makes good on its threats, the other enablers of Russia’s war machine should be included in the crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, focusing on the “lessons learned” from implementing sanctions against Iran and North Korea to fortify sanctions against Russia may lead to sanctions myopia. Russia’s long history of embargo-busting, exploitation of the global financial system, and criminal state capture show the country is more than capable of circumventing Western-imposed sanctions. However, closing loopholes that facilitate smuggling, money laundering, and transnational crime will help sanctions to bite across the board.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英對示威者非和平手段諒解、認同「和勇不分」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kDpCygS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（1日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第36日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。陳供稱，在2019年之後，黎會以諒解態度看待示威者的非和平手段，例如7月1日示威者衝擊立法會之後，黎想《蘋果》報導多些年青人心聲，從而「令公眾都會諒解，同明白點解佢哋會咁做」。陳又指，基於對運動的支持，黎亦會認同「和勇不分」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第15天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻繼續盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方封面報導指黎智英出賣壹週刊-社長未有因此被處罰&quot;&gt;辯方：封面報導指黎智英「出賣」壹週刊 社長未有因此被處罰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方向陳沛敏展示2017年7月20日的《壹週刊》封面，題為〈出賣壹週刊內幕〉。辯方問陳，是否同意封面上的黎智英黑白大頭照看似不討好（unflattering）。惟法官杜麗冰打斷指這是一個很主觀的形容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則指，該期封面似乎指稱黎智英出賣由他一手創辦的《壹週刊》，當時負責此封面的《壹週刊》社長黃麗裳，並沒有因此而被處罰。惟陳表示她對《壹週刊》的內部事務不太清楚。辯方則指，根據公司年報所述，黃於1998年2月入職，直至2017年10月，之後於2018年重新入職，這是不爭議的紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰一度指，「出賣」的中文意思未必帶有背叛或負面的意思，有可能純粹指「出售」。法官李運騰留意到，封面標題中的「出賣」兩字是黃色，不肯定是否有特別意思。辯方回應指，標題可以有很多字眼選擇，但是他們選擇了使用「出賣」一詞，如此措辭至少是引人注目（eye-catching）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指媒體有特定立場並不是問題-陳沛敏同意&quot;&gt;辯方指媒體有特定立場並不是問題 陳沛敏同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方談及新聞角度，問陳是否同意不同報紙或媒體均可以有不同報導角度。陳同意。辯方舉例指，《紐約時報》立場上比較偏向自由主義（liberal），《華爾街日報》立場則偏向保守（conservative）。法官杜麗冰打斷指，辯方的例子未必恰當，因以上兩間媒體的取態隨著不同時期而改變，只能說他們較支持美國民主黨或共和黨，而不能說他們較傾向自由主義或保守。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂以本地報紙為例，《蘋果》在2020年的時候較傾向自由主義（liberal）和對於政府較批判性。陳確認：「可以咁講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，《明報》和《經濟日報》則稍微偏向保守和支持政府。陳則笑言：「我唔想演繹其他傳媒嘅路線。」辯方指，《文匯報》和《大公報》則是比較極端的例子，兩者都是支持政府。陳回答：「我觀察到都係嘅。」她亦同意辯方所指媒體有特定立場並不是問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏2019年後黎智英對非和平手法諒解&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：2019年後黎智英對非和平手法諒解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方盤問完畢。其後控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作出覆問。陳早前供稱黎智英在2019年之前主張和平示威，控方問陳，在2019年之後，黎的立場又如何呢？陳回答：「我係會覺得，佢對於非和平嗰啲手法，佢係會用一種諒解嘅態度囉」，例如7月1日示威者衝擊立法會，事件在好多人眼中並不是和平，「佢畀我嘅指示係，我會理解為，因為佢唔想個運動消失或者停止啦」，所以黎會想《蘋果》報導多些年青人心聲，「令公眾都會諒解，同明白點解佢哋會咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，當時示威者之間有一句口號「和勇不分」，即和平和勇武示威者要團結，「咁黎生同樣，因為對個運動個支持，都會認同呢個講法囉。」她又確認早前提及按照黎的觀點來行事，當中的觀點包括上述提及的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏指報導要基於事實-確保編採自主乃靠同事意識&quot;&gt;陳沛敏指報導要基於事實 確保編採自主乃靠同事意識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方早前盤問時提及《蘋果日報編輯室約章》，控方指約章於2019年4月1日生效，陳確認。其中第五條指出「新聞報道秉持真實、公正、客觀、獨立原則，這並非等於將所有各方觀點、所有資料全部鋪陳出來，而是不受任何政府、商業、宗教或其他利益左右」。陳沛敏同意不同的報紙可以持有不同的政治立場，可以在社論中討論哪一個政治系統較好，但是第五條所指的「新聞報道」是基於事實真相去做報導，所以新聞報導與評論文章是不同的。假設有人將評論文章投稿，該文章明顯是表達觀點和立場，但新聞報導則是基於事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問陳是否同意，不論報館的立場如何，他們都應該「秉持真實、公正、客觀、獨立原則」。陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，《蘋果》有否設立任何機制去確保「編採自主」。陳一邊思考一邊表示：「其實都係靠同事自己嘅意識囉⋯⋯啫係 awareness。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英支持罷工-員工關注能否行使罷工權&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英支持罷工 員工關注能否行使罷工權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示陳沛敏與時任執行總編輯林文宗之間的訊息紀錄，2019年8月1日陳向林說：「我已跟社長打了招呼，星期一報紙頭版開天窗，並會有段文字交代一下我們支持罷工，但基於社會角色欲罷不能之類。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏補充相關事件背景，公司的人都知道黎支持罷工和有叫張劍虹寫「反送中」和「罷工、罷課、罷市」毛筆字，有部份中層和前線的同事提出「可唔可以行使佢哋嘅罷工權呢？」，「咁我哋管理層呢，就覺得我哋作為傳媒嘅角色，我哋唔可以話我哋參加罷工而唔出報紙。咁我哋拗咗好耐呢件事，我哋最後決定咁樣處理」，即頭版留白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到頭版「開天窗」是誰人的主意。陳回答：「係管理層商討出嚟呢個方法，既解釋到點解我哋唔可以參加罷工，但又表達咗我哋嘅態度囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英訊息稱先要想好策略對付不用魯莽-陳沛敏未細心思考策略所指為何&quot;&gt;黎智英訊息稱「先要想好策略對付，不用魯莽」 陳沛敏：未細心思考「策略」所指為何&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月1日，黎智英向陳傳送訊息稱看到《國安法》條文後「嚇了一跳」，又籲「先要想好策略對付，不用魯莽」。控方問陳，黎所指的「策略」是什麼、「魯莽」是指什麼。陳則指黎當時「就咁好空泛咁講完啦」，而時任社長張劍虹曾經提醒他們報導敏感字眼、敏感題目時要謹慎，因此她理解「不要魯莽」是這個意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎所稱「對付」是要對付什麼？陳表示當時沒有細心思考要「對付」什麼，因為黎之後稱「劍虹已有方案」，所以她理解張劍虹稍後會跟她詳細解釋，因而「冇深入諗黎生講嘅策略係乜嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;報導指陳與黎共事多年不影響新聞判斷-陳關於法庭報導重點應否落在黎身上&quot;&gt;報導指陳與黎共事多年不影響新聞判斷 陳：關於法庭報導重點應否落在黎身上&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方早前問及黎智英的觀點會否影響到陳沛敏的新聞判斷，而辯方引述2021年6月18日刊登的《蘋果》報導〈夫︰她冷靜堅強鎮定 陳沛敏選擇留在災難現場〉，當中提及同年4月1日，黎智英、民主黨創黨主席李柱銘和前公民黨立法會議員吳靄儀等人因為非法集結罪成，並指：「敏姐說，雖然與黎智英共事多年，不影響新聞判斷，當日頭條重點是資深大律師中資歷最深的李柱銘首次被判罪成。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問該次報導的背景。陳解釋是關於一宗非法集結的報導，該案件中黎智英是其中一個被定罪的被告，有編輯詢問報導重點是否應該落在黎身上，但她與其他同事則覺得，另一名被告李柱銘是首次被判罪成，所以報導重點應該放在李身上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，黎智英、李柱銘等人牽涉8.18「流水式集會」而被裁定組織及參與未經批准集結罪成。相關上訴程序仍然進行中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏質疑網上節目參考頭條新聞加入評論環節不符認真報導風格-惟黎堅持&quot;&gt;陳沛敏質疑網上節目參考《頭條新聞》加入評論環節不符認真報導風格 惟黎堅持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向陳沛敏展示通訊軟件 Slack 群組「港蘋報紙對話」的訊息紀錄，其中2019年9月的「飯盒會」會議議程包括討論「最近公眾最關心的8.31」、「福健幫起底」、「勇武升級的考量」和「可供讀者收藏的百日特刊」等。陳確認「百日特刊」是指《自由之夏》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月6日的群組訊息顯示，黎智英要求「飯盒會」改期舉行。控方問為何要改期。陳指因為張劍虹未能準備該次「飯盒會」，她確認後來改期進行的「飯盒會」上有討論到《蘋果》英文版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年10月的群組訊息紀錄曾提及參考已遭停播的港台節目《頭條新聞》。陳沛敏解釋，當時黎提出籌備一個類似電視新聞的節目，在《蘋果》網上平台播放，但黎不想節目太傳統，例如好像晚間電視新聞的風格，而且黎想邀請一些人作評論，例如藝人王喜和時事評論人桑普。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，在「飯盒會」期間，她曾就此表達意見：「如果你想做認真嘅報導，但又加入呢啲環節，咁我又覺得唔係好合適囉」，不過最後黎堅持加入這些環節，「話會『活潑啲』。」法官李運騰追問，即是陳的意見被黎拒絕了？陳確認：「係，同埋反正唔係實體報紙關事嘅嘢」，而黎所提議的新聞報導節目後來有在網上平台實行到。陳亦確認以上是她早前形容黎「比較強勢」的例子之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方下周一傳召另一證人-官關注審訊進度&quot;&gt;控方下周一傳召另一證人 官關注審訊進度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示覆問完畢，法官杜麗冰指示陳沛敏可以先行離開。她遂由3名懲教人員的帶領下，循法庭特別通道離開法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另向法庭申請下一名證人的「提犯令」。法官李運騰指，現時控方只傳召了兩名證人，卻使用了接近一半的審期，問控方還需要多久時間舉證。助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤則指下一名證人的作供時間不會如早前的證人般長，並承諾會盡力有效地運用法庭時間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官則指他們正在認真地考慮6月的工作日程，因他們手上有一些案件仍待安排，而本案的審訊進度將有所影響。張卓勤則稱，保守估計下一名證人的主問需時7日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite backing Moscow politically and diplomatically, Beijing has declared that it will not send weapons to Russia or Ukraine. Nonetheless, this has not dissuaded Chinese companies from reportedly supplying Russia with assault rifles, body armour and drones via clandestine shipments, nor has it impeded China’s collaboration with Russia on 5G and satellite technologies with abundant (and, often, already utilised) battlefield applications, particularly in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extensive deployment of drones and advanced telecommunications equipment have been crucial on all fronts in Ukraine, from intelligence collection to airstrike campaigns. These technologies, though critical, require steady connectivity and geospatial support, making cooperation with China a potential solution to Moscow’s desire for a military breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reaching-out-improving-connectivity-with-5g&quot;&gt;Reaching Out: Improving Connectivity with 5G&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5G has the potential to reshape the battlefield through enhanced tracking of military objects; faster transferring and real-time processing of large sensor datasets (like soldiers’ biometrics or large-resolution drone images); and enhanced communications, including between autonomous vehicles. Given the urgency of Russia’s objectives in Ukraine, it may want to tap into such potential – something which could be aided by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, 5G network development has accrued particular significance in the Russo-Chinese strategic calculus, resulting in a series of agreements between Huawei and major Russian ICT players including MTS and Beeline. In 2021, Huawei and MTS successfully launched commercial 5G networks across 14 locations in Moscow and implemented a pilot 5G network reaching data transfer speeds of 5.6 Gbps – a record for Russia at the time. This new technology allowed for very sophisticated and remote operations: for example, Russia’s GMS Hospital, with support from Beeline and Huawei, performed surgeries using 5G-connected medical equipment that enabled the real-time transfer of high-resolution images to doctors remotely assisting their colleagues in the operating theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beeline and Huawei have also cooperated on 5G-driven machine-to-machine interactions, and in 2020 they launched a pilot 5G zone to operate unmanned and remotely controlled dump trucks at a Russian coal mine. As previously mentioned, increased network throughput, high-speed data transfer and integration of networks into civilian and military autonomous vehicles are precisely the features that could render Russo-Chinese 5G cooperation extremely useful in a wartime context – and therefore create a heightened risk for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are operational and institutional constraints on Russia’s battlefield integration of 5G technology. At the onset of the invasion, Russian troops extensively utilised unencrypted, high-frequency radio for long-range communications, allowing Ukrainians to successfully intercept signals and conversations. The deep-seated tendency within the Russian military to favour risk-prone communication methods may render the integration of 5G into Russian command-and-control quite problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Strategic collaboration between Russia and China in a contested, future-oriented domain like satellite technology could have serious implications for Ukraine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Russia’s Ministry of Defence, Federal Security Service and Federal Space Agency have already prevented mobile operators, including those cooperating with Huawei on 5G networks, from using the frequencies most conducive to 5G deployment – the 3.4–3.8 GHz range – by reserving their use for the Russian security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reaching-up-enhancing-navigation-and-observation-with-satellites&quot;&gt;Reaching Up: Enhancing Navigation and Observation with Satellites&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellite technology, another instrument capable of augmenting Russia’s military performance, is already the focus of intense Russo-Chinese collaboration. These tools collect valuable imagery, weather and terrain data; improve logistics management; track and predict troop movements; and enhance precision in the identification and elimination of ground targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, Russia and China have discussed collaboration between the Russian satellite navigation system GLONASS and its Chinese equivalent, Beidou. Russia has repeatedly tested GLONASS/Beidou compatibility on Russian transport routes along the Belt and Road corridor; tentative results from 2017 and 2018 claimed improved satellite navigation in 100% of monitored cases, allegedly surpassing individual results from GLONASS as well as Western GPS and Galileo systems. In 2018, Russia and China agreed on the joint application of GLONASS/Beidou and, in 2022, they decided to build three Russian monitoring stations in the Chinese cities of Changchun, Ürümqi and Shanghai and three Chinese stations in the Russian cities of Obninsk, Irkutsk and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellites are the ultimate enablers of Russian strategic air capabilities. In Ukraine, GLONASS has already enabled Russian missile and drone strikes via satellite correction and supported communications between Russian troops through its connection to Azart portable digital radios. The Russian Azart manufacturer, Angstrem, has collaborated with Huawei since 2011 and reportedly imported almost fully assembled Azart radios from China, causing a corruption scandal in Russia in 2021. RUSI previously identified Angstrem microchips in Russian weapons used in Ukraine. The resulting Chinese footprint in Azart radios could help Russia expedite GLONASS/Beidou integration to improve satellite-driven tactical operations. Additionally, Russia could exploit Beidou’s ability to facilitate the navigation and tracking of autonomous vehicles for strategic attacks with missiles and drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic collaboration between the two states in a contested, future-oriented domain like satellite technology could have serious implications for Ukraine, despite claims that such cooperation is in pursuit of “peaceful goals”. Russia’s published map of GLONASS and Beidou satellites, updated regularly, periodically shows satellites reaching over Ukraine. Coupled with the anticipated construction of Beidou’s Obninsk monitoring station, the closest of the three Chinese stations to Ukraine, Russia is increasingly capable of leveraging satellite cooperation with China against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the risk of China assisting Moscow on imagery and geospatial intelligence through other satellite-based platforms, potentially leading to worrisome scenarios in which China tests the waters for escalated tensions with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Western geospatial companies exited Russia in 2022, Chinese companies signed agreements with Russian MoD partner Racurs to provide remote sensing data for security management, infrastructure monitoring and other applications. One company, HEAD Aerospace, has already provided more remote sensing data than its leading Russian competitor across a geography of delivery encompassing Donbas and Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Racurs has also considered sharing photogrammetric software with Chinese counterparts to improve drone image processing, and a Chinese company sold two high-resolution observation satellites to the Wagner Group in 2022 to aid its intelligence capabilities in Ukraine and across Africa. Ultimately, such dynamic interactions with Chinese companies may improve Russian military logistics, reconnaissance capabilities, geospatial intelligence and drone deployment in Ukraine. Additionally, lessons learned through such cooperation could feasibly be applied in other theatres, including a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukraine and its Western partners should prepare for the potential expansion of Russo-Chinese technological collaboration on the battlefield&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China has already exhibited potential reticence towards satellite technology transfers to Moscow. Despite a 2017 joint agreement between Moscow and Beijing to develop a GLONASS/Beidou navigation chipset for facilitating the systems’ integration, Beijing allegedly decided in 2020 to limit cooperation on some GLONASS chipsets to prioritise its own national satellite system. Such apprehension has clearly not completely stalled Russo-Chinese satellite technology collaboration, but it does reveal China’s wariness about leaning too fully into a lockstep relationship with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;all-eyes-to-the-east-what-comes-next&quot;&gt;All Eyes to the East: What Comes Next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s capacity for repurposing civilian 5G and satellite cooperation with China for military applications continues to expand, albeit at different paces on each respective front. Battlefield integration of 5G networks may face domestic hurdles, but infrastructure enabling China to assist Russian satellite usage already exists and can facilitate Russian military action in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, Russo-Chinese cooperation is not always smooth sailing, but differences in policy are unlikely to inhibit the strengthening of ties between the two states. Therefore, it is imperative that the international community – especially partners of Ukraine – are aware of Moscow and Beijing’s intentions for 5G and satellite technology sharing and respond through political calculus and risk management strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a response would ideally adopt a two-pronged approach. First, governments should disincentivise military applications of Russo-Chinese 5G and satellite collaboration – for example, through economic restrictions on the flow of Western technology into Russia or China related to joint programmes with likely military applications, or through political pressure to work together in exclusively civilian capacities. Concurrently, Ukraine should prepare for the potential expansion of Russo-Chinese technological collaboration on the battlefield – and so should the West, given that the impacts of such cooperation will extend to its ongoing lines of support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proactive reaction from Ukraine and its partners may not only prove decisive in evading any artificial enhancement of Russia’s battlefield capabilities, but it may very well also prevent a wider rift between Russia and China and the West from looming ever more heavily on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;辯方：黎智英開會談業務、改善報紙 非落編採指示 陳沛敏：黎一錘定音&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nRW0eYN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（29日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第35日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。辯方指，黎智英在2018年有見《蘋果》內部士氣低落，遂設立「飯盒會」以收集員工的意見。辯方又指，黎重視報紙質素，「飯盒會」是為了討論公司業務、經營事宜和如何改善報紙，而不是為了給予編採指示。惟陳沛敏表示：「唔係好同意」，因黎有在會上提及編採指示，「如果你話改善報紙，好難唔觸及點樣做新聞。」而且她形容黎「都係一個好有睇法嘅人」，有些時候會比較強勢，雖然會議上有討論，但最後決定會由黎一錘定音。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第14天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻繼續盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方蘋果士氣低落-飯盒會設立目的是收集員工意見&quot;&gt;辯方：《蘋果》士氣低落 飯盒會設立目的是收集員工意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方昨日提到，黎智英在2014年下半年辭去壹傳媒主席，《蘋果》其後錄得虧蝕，但黎在2018年回來積極參與之後，公司利潤有所增長，但是《蘋果》內部的士氣仍然低落，所以黎想設立渠道與員工溝通。陳僅指：「我記得佢（黎）係改善咗飯堂嘅服務囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，「飯盒會」設立的目的是收集《蘋果》員工的意見。惟陳表示：「佢（黎）搞飯盒會，我會覺得佢係會多啲佢嘅理念」，包括做生意和時政的理念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黎智英更籌備問卷調查，以收集員工意見，並展示2018年5月的訊息紀錄，顯示陳向黎傳送問卷調查的初稿過目。辯方又展示陳沛敏與時任《蘋果》執行總編輯林文宗的訊息紀錄，林向陳傳送「老闆同網主管開會的紀錄」，顯示黎曾經與《蘋果》網站主管開會。辯方問陳，這是否「飯盒會」的前身，陳則不肯定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏形容黎智英好有睇法-若對某議題有興趣會講多些-若缺興趣會輕輕帶過&quot;&gt;陳沛敏形容黎智英「好有睇法」 若對某議題有興趣會講多些 若缺興趣會輕輕帶過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎在該段時候開始與不同部門開「飯盒會」，包括實體報紙、網站、廣告部門等的「飯盒會」。在開會之前兩至三日，黎會先要求員工就一些議題提出問題和意見，而出席會議的人會透過通訊平台 Slack 群組提出觀點，以替會議設立討論框架。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指「飯盒會」上會討論 Slack 群組所設立的框架，「但係我有個感覺係，如果黎生對某個題目冇好大興趣嘅話，就會輕輕帶過」，她又指，「咁黎生都係一個好有睇法嘅人，如果黎生有個題目係好想講，佢會講多啲，同埋發揮多啲佢嘅意見囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，「飯盒會」的總結會被傳閱，以讓員工做跟進工作。陳確認會議紀錄由張劍虹負責，當張沒有出席會議時，她才會負責會議紀錄。若果黎未能出席會議，便沒有需要開「飯盒會」，因管理層之間可以直接開會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方飯盒會為討論業務改善報紙而設-而非供黎落編採指示&quot;&gt;辯方：飯盒會為討論業務、改善報紙而設 而非供黎落編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎智英重視報紙質素，設立「飯盒會」的用意是討論公司業務、經營事宜和如何改善報紙，而不是為了給予編採指示。陳則回答：「唔係好同意。」因為黎會提到辯方所指如何改善報紙生意和經營策略，但是他亦會講一些編採指示，而且出席會議的人都是編採人員，「有時好難分開」，「如果你話改善報紙，好難唔觸及點樣做新聞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，如果會上有提到編採指示的話，會議紀錄理應會顯示出來。惟陳指會議紀錄只會講重點和需要跟進的工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則指「編採指示」的意思是特定指示某些新聞要報導、某些新聞不要報導，而不是指一般的報導角度。法官李運騰問，黎有否在會議中提及哪些新聞要報導、哪些新聞不要報導。惟陳指黎比較少講哪些新聞不要報導，但是當發生重大的新聞，例如2019年的社會運動和2020年爆發疫情，這些事件不常見，而且持續很長時間，黎便會在該段時期的「飯盒會」中提及。陳又指，黎當然不會要求訪問特定的示威者，但是他「可能講到嗰個方向，例如佢想講多啲呢啲人嘅心聲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官續問，黎有否在「飯盒會」上提及一般的新聞角度。陳回答：「我嘅認知係都會有討論到囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏雖有討論-但最後由黎智英一錘定音&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：雖有討論 但最後由黎智英一錘定音&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方向陳展示《蘋果》Slack 群組「港蘋報紙對話」的訊息紀錄，張劍虹會傳出「飯盒會」的會議紀錄重點，黎智英曾吩咐陳根據張傳出來的會議紀錄作出跟進；黎智英亦曾在群組中要求各位同事，就「報紙雜誌化」過程中做了什麼、準備做些什麼，在群組中提出意見，陳歸納意見後傳出群組，黎回覆會稍後一起討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又確認，從訊息紀錄可見，黎會就林文宗提出的建議回應，但同時補充：「咁其實都係會觸及到做新聞的角度。」她又指，黎作為老闆在「飯盒會」上給予的意見，會作為總結及跟進工作；相反，如果黎在會上提出某些事情不需要做，他們便不會作任何跟進。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳同意辯方所指，黎會就一些議題與其他人討論，之後才得出結論，但她同時重申：「黎生係好有睇法，同埋喺某啲時候都係比較強勢」，所以最後會由黎一錘定音。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過辯方指，黎有時會使用「呢個意見幾好，我哋咁樣做啦」之類的言辭，例如黎在群組中說：「OK。就依他們做法吧。謝謝。」陳亦確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏飯盒會會議紀錄只會寫下黎智英同意及需要跟進事項&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：「飯盒會」會議紀錄只會寫下黎智英同意及需要跟進事項&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到庭上展示的 Slack 群組訊息紀錄是否準確地反映黎與員工之間的討論，陳確認。但當法官李運騰問到，以「飯盒會」的討論而言，是否能如實及準確地反映在上載至群組的會議紀錄中。陳則說：「只能夠講呢個（會議紀錄）係一個簡略」，若然「飯盒會」有一小時，他們只會將黎智英同意而且需要跟進的事項寫在會議紀錄中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，「飯盒會」的討論主要是關於公司業務和怎樣改善報紙，問陳是否同意。陳同意會議會談到這些議題，但是亦會討論到時事和新聞報導角度。她又指，黎會要求邀請哪些作者替論壇版撰文，或者要求報導和訪問多些曾經質疑內地隱瞞疫情的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則指，新冠肺炎病毒源頭是有新聞價值，而且是全球關注的議題。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine has caused the greatest military-related disruption to global agricultural markets in at least a century. Ukraine’s agricultural sector has been a major front in Russia’s war since February 2022, and the primary purpose of Russia’s targeting of Ukraine’s agricultural infrastructure is likely to undercut a main source of Ukraine’s income. Ukraine’s GDP contracted by more than 29 percent in 2022 compared to 2021, and the value of agriculture as a proportion of Ukraine’s GDP was 39 percent lower in 2022 than 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global disruptions to the agricultural market due to Ukraine’s diminished production and exports have been stark: world food prices reached all-time nominal highs in March 2022, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization Food Price Index. In 2022, 258 million people suffered from acute food insecurity, an all-time high, according to the Global Report on Food Crises. At the same time, the cost of addressing these challenges also soared due to concurrent shocks in the global energy and fertilizer markets brought on by Russia’s war. For example, the cost of the delivery of humanitarian assistance also peaked due to the increased cost of food and fuel for operations. At the same time, for countries hoping to address domestic food insecurity with domestic agricultural production, the increased cost of fertilizer became a limiting factor. Likewise, countries dealing with the high price of food imports, high prices of agricultural inputs, and high levels of food insecurity also had less fiscal space for social programs following the Covid-19 pandemic, which drained national budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine’s depleted agricultural GDP has been a boon to Russia, the rising global food insecurity that has resulted from Russia’s war has also been beneficial: Ukraine’s diminished exports have created openings for Russia, another major global agricultural exporter, to make up for Ukraine’s losses, with Russia using its agricultural exports as a source of soft power. In early 2022, Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president and current deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, declared food to be Russia’s “silent weapon.” By August 2023, President Vladimir Putin declared Moscow’s intention to “replace Ukrainian grain” with Russian grain, particularly to “needy countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2022, data show increases in Russia’s production and exports and decreases in Ukraine’s production and exports of key agricultural commodities. However, the specific regions to which Russia has exported more, and to which Ukraine has exported less, are unclear. Likewise, trends in Russia’s fertilizer exports have been difficult to discern. Using the best data available, this white paper assesses the change in Ukraine and Russia’s agricultural exports and trading partners for wheat and corn, as well as Russia’s fertilizer exports, since February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-the-war-on-ukraines-crop-production&quot;&gt;The Impact of the War on Ukraine’s Crop Production&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has had direct and indirect impacts on agricultural production in Ukraine. The occupied regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia accounted for about 21 percent of wheat, 17 percent of barley, and 19 percent of sunflower seed produced in Ukraine between 2016 and 2020, while very little corn is grown in the occupied areas. Analysis by NASA Harvest, NASA’s Global Food Security and Agriculture Consortium, estimates that the amount of abandoned cropland in Ukraine in 2023 due to the war is equivalent to about 7.5 percent of total cropland in the country. In addition, the war has increased the costs of transporting grain and other agricultural products to export markets. Most of these costs have been absorbed by Ukrainian producers in the form of lower prices, which has reduced profitability of crops such as wheat and corn. As a result, Ukraine has planted and harvested fewer crops. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that harvested area for wheat, corn (maize), and barley for 2023 is down 32 percent, 27 percent, and 37 percent, respectively, from 2021 levels.[1] Sunflower area is also down 15 percent, while the combined area for soybeans and rapeseed has actually increased 21 percent. However, net area for the six crops is down 19.5 percent over the past two years. For 2024, Ukrainian producers are expected to cut corn-planted areas further but continue to increase areas with oilseeds, especially soybeans, according to survey results from a recent survey from the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impacts-on-ukrainian-exports&quot;&gt;Impacts on Ukrainian Exports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of the war on Ukrainian exports was immediate (see Figure 2). Shipping out of Ukraine’s ports on the Black Sea came to a halt in the week leading up to the invasion as shipping lanes were mined and Russian ships patrolled sea lanes. By the time of the invasion on February 24, Ukraine had shipped most of its wheat and barley harvested in the previous summer, but about 40 to 45 percent of its corn remained to be shipped. With shipping out of the Black Sea halted, exports were transported over land and by river on rail, truck, and barge through Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania to destinations in Europe and to the Romanian port of Constanta. These so-called solidarity lanes exported about one-third of the level that would typically be shipped through the Black Sea ports during that period. As crops planted in the fall began to be harvested in the spring, Ukrainian producers began to face storage constraints which, combined with higher transportation costs, drove down local grain and oilseed prices. Sunflower seed crushers, many located near Black Sea port facilities, found it more profitable to export the oilseed rather than the oil and meal components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) went into effect in late July 2022, and Ukrainian grain and oilseed exports resumed shipping out of three ports around Odesa. Export volumes more than doubled, which eased storage constraints at a critical juncture when the fall harvest began. By February 2022, grain export levels were approaching prewar totals. Russia temporarily suspended the agreement in November 2022 and then repeatedly threatened to pull out in 2023 before finally terminating the agreement in July 2023. Nonetheless, over the 12 months during which the BSGI was in effect, Ukraine shipped nearly 33 million metric tons (mmt) of grains and other agricultural products from its Black Sea ports, which helped contribute to a decline in international prices of staple foods and helped sustain global food supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nlvKvkS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Ukraine Grain Exports, January 2022 – November 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Termination of the BSGI resulted in a sharp decrease in exports in the late summer and early fall of 2023 as exporters sought alternative routes. Ukraine’s military successes in the Black Sea resulted in a retreat of the Russian naval fleet from the western Black Sea, which helped enable the re-establishment of a “humanitarian corridor” that allows shipping of agricultural products from Black Sea ports. Export volumes by the late fall of 2023 had rebounded significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-war-has-affected-trade-flows&quot;&gt;How the War Has Affected Trade Flows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption to shipping in the Black Sea has resulted in more Ukrainian exports going to Europe and less going to regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Between January 2021 and February 2022, less than 2 percent of total Ukrainian wheat exports went to European markets, but since February 2022, European markets have received 50 percent of total wheat exports (see Figure 3). While countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA, including Turkey) remain large markets for Ukraine, the share of exports has dropped from 53 percent to 34 percent over these same periods. The largest impact to wheat exports has been felt by Sub-Saharan Africa, which fell from 10 percent to 3 percent, and South and Southeast Asia, which fell from 30 percent to 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/np9FkYs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Ukraine Corn Wheat Exports by Region, January 2021 – November 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe also saw a large increase in corn imports from Ukraine after February 2022 (see Figure 4). Over 64 percent of total corn exports from Ukraine went to European markets after the start of the war, compared to 36 percent in the 14-month period prior to the invasion. Corn exports to Middle East and North African countries (including Turkey) dropped from almost 25 percent of total exports to 17 percent. Ukraine corn exports to East Asia (primarily China) have also fallen since the war. Corn exports to East Asia accounted for over 34 percent of total corn exports before the invasion, but that share fell to less than 19 percent after February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impacts-of-the-war-on-russian-exports-of-wheat-and-fertilizers&quot;&gt;Impacts of the War on Russian Exports of Wheat and Fertilizers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is the world’s largest exporter of wheat and accounts for a large share of global exports of fertilizer components such as potash, urea, diammonium phosphate (DAP), and anhydrous ammonia. Market prices for these commodities spiked after the invasion in February 2022, in part because of the fear that Russian exports, as well as Ukraine’s, would be adversely affected. The sanctions imposed by the European Union, United States, Canada, and other countries on Russia and Belarus following Russia’s 2022 invasion included restrictions on banking, trade, technology transfers, and specific individuals. (These came on top of earlier sanctions on both countries — on Russia in response to its 2014 annexation of Crimea and on Belarus in response to human rights violations in 2020 and its forced grounding of Ryanair Flight 4798 to seize a dissident journalist in 2021.) But these sanctions exempted the agricultural sector, including inputs such as fertilizers, to avoid side effects on global food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian wheat production over the past two marketing seasons has been at a record high due to record plantings and yields (see Figure 5). The USDA estimates that Russian wheat exports will likely be a record-high 51 mmt for the 2023–2024 marketing year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2YAAZP8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Russian Wheat Production and Exports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the impact of the war on Russian exports is complicated by the fact that Russia discontinued reporting exports (and imports) to the United Nations in early 2022. To estimate the impacts on trade, one must resort to so-called mirror trade methodologies (aggregating data from importing countries who report imports from Russia) or by examining maritime shipment data that is collected by private sources. Neither is ideal, but shipment data for wheat is superior to mirror trade data, as the latter only captures a small share of total exports due to missing key data from regions where import reporting lags, such as Sub-Saharan Africa. (For example, for the July 2020–June 2021 marketing year, Russia reported wheat exports at 38.1 mmt, while mirror trade data over the same period showed only 14.0 mmt.) This paper uses shipment data collected by KPLR and processed by the International Grains Council (IGC) and World Trade Organization (WTO) and published by the WTO’s Global Trade Data Portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cumulative shipment data collected over the period July 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024, allows a comparison of exports during the current 2023/24 marketing year to last year’s exports over the same seven-month period and to a three-year average level taken over the 2020–2021, 2021–2022, and 2022–2023 periods (see Figure 6). Russian wheat exports dipped in the first few months after the invasion began but recovered by mid-summer that year. Total wheat shipments over the period July 1, 2023, to January 31, 2024, totaled 22.1 mmt, compared to 21.9 million tons for the same period last year and an average 20.4 mmt over the three-year average).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 6 shows that more wheat shipments during the 2022–2023 marketing year went to North Africa and Western Asia and proportionately less wheat went to Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern and Southeastern Asian markets than in prior years. But for the first seven months of the 2023/24 marketing years, Russia’s wheat trade has largely reverted to more traditional pattern, with more wheat going to Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Uw3sYHn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Russia Cumulative Wheat Exports through January 31&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of the war on Russia’s fertilizer exports has been mixed (see Table 1). Based on mirror trade data, potash exports were down in 2022 compared to 2020 and 2021 levels but have rebounded strongly in 2023. Urea and DAP exports both were up in 2022 and for the first 11 months of 2023. By contrast, exports of anhydrous ammonia fell by more than 70 percent in 2022 and have declined further in 2023. This largely reflects the impacts of the closure of the Tolyatti-Pivdennyi ammonia pipeline and Russia’s difficulties in moving exports to more remote ports on the Baltic Sea. Unlike for wheat, where key import data is lacking, mirror trade data for fertilizer typically captures 80–90 percent of exports based on data for 2020 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/B9FkiZK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Global Fertilizer Imports from Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data presented here offer insights regarding the impact of Russia’s war on agricultural production, exports, and market shares for both Ukraine and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s wheat and corn exports have fallen relative to prewar exports for every region except Europe. Wheat exports to Europe grew from 2 percent in the period preceding Russia’s invasion to 50 percent post-invasion, and corn exports to Europe grew from 36 percent pre-invasion to 64 percent. These figures mask the ultimate destinations of much of Ukraine’s wheat and corn, as some European countries further export Ukrainian grains to countries outside of the region. Nonetheless, the sudden increase in Ukrainian exports to its European neighbors resulted in market disruptions in many of these countries, particularly the “frontline five” — Poland, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Bulgaria. Trade disputes have erupted between Ukraine and these countries, and disagreements have emerged within the European Union regarding ways to maintain support for Ukraine’s agriculture sector while not overburdening its neighbors’ agricultural markets or diminishing their farmers’ incomes. Agricultural market disruptions have influenced national elections in some countries, and tensions with Ukraine and within the European Union are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ukraine’s exports to Europe spiked and exports to all other regions fell, one country noticeably affected is China. Prior to Russia’s invasion, East Asia (primarily China) accounted for 34 percent of Ukraine’s corn exports, but it has accounted for less than 19 percent since February 2022. While the BSGI was operational, China was the major beneficiary of Ukraine’s exports, importing nearly 8 million of the almost 33 mmt of grains and other agricultural products exported under the BSGI between July 2022 and July 2023. Almost 73 percent of China’s imports (by volume) from Ukraine under the BSGI was corn, with Ukraine providing 27 percent of China’s corn imports during this period. China’s reliance on Ukraine as a relatively inexpensive source of corn, a major form of animal feed, kept these countries close for much of the period since Russia invaded Ukraine, perhaps tempering Russia’s influence on China during this period. Since the cessation of the BSGI, however, China has turned from Ukraine to South America, mainly Brazil, as a source of corn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the prewar period to today, Ukraine’s wheat exports to Sub-Saharan Africa fell from 10 percent of Ukraine’s total to 3 percent, and Ukraine’s wheat exports to North Africa fell from 53 percent to 34 percent. Whether Russia has successfully “replaced” Ukraine as a source of wheat to the African continent is not possible to determine with available data, but certain patterns are clear. Between the 2022–2023 and 2023–2024 marketing year, Russia’s exports of wheat increased to each WTO region of Sub-Saharan Africa (Eastern Africa, Central Africa, Western Africa, and Southern Africa). In this period, Russia has tried to assuage opposition from African countries who disapproved of Russia’s termination of the BSGI on the grounds that it would increase the cost of food imports. Speaking at a Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg on July 27, 2023, President Putin said that Russia was ready to replace Ukrainian grain exports to Africa and offered to provide Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Mali, Somalia, the Central African Republic, and Eritrea with 25,000–50,000 metric tons of free grain each in the next three to four months. Russian state news reported on February 21, 2024 that Russia’s agriculture ministry had completed delivery of grains to these countries, including 25,000 million tons of wheat each to Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Mali, and Zimbabwe, and 50,000 million tons of wheat to Somalia and the Central African Republic. In September 2023, Russia announced an agreement with Turkey and Qatar to move 1 mmt of Russian grains to the “neediest countries” in Africa. Increased exports to Sub-Saharan Africa reflect efforts by Russia to bolster support in the region and deflate criticism over termination of the BSGI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s wheat exports to North Africa for the first seven months of 2023–2024 are down from the same period a year ago, but their market share has remained roughly the same at 47 percent, and North Africa remains the top destination of Russian wheat. Russian wheat exports to Western Asia over the first seven months of 2023–2024 have similarly declined, but Russia’s market share has actually increased from 51 percent to 59 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BSGI had promised to secure Russia’s exports of anhydrous ammonia through the Tolyatti-Pivdennyi pipeline, which terminates near Odesa. Ukraine has obstructed the flow of ammonia through the pipeline since February 2022. In early June 2023, Russia and Ukraine reported damage to the pipeline. As a result, BSGI-facilitated inspections of ships into and out of Pivdennyi ground to a halt in June 2023. Some analysts suggested that repairs to the pipeline, and eventual resumption of exports of Russia’s anhydrous ammonia, would be necessary to renew the BSGI in July 2023. Instead, Russia terminated the deal that month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding fertilizer, Russia’s exports of potash, urea, and diammonium phosphate have rebounded, though exports of anhydrous ammonia have stalled. Sales of all fertilizer types were lower during the first 10 months of 2022 than in November and December of that year. Nonetheless, because Russia’s war disrupted fertilizer markets, causing fertilizer prices to climb, Russia’s revenues from fertilizer sales in the first 10 months of 2022 were 70 percent higher than the same period in 2021. One of Russia’s explanations for terminating the BSGI was that its own agriculture sector has suffered during the war and particularly since the BSGI was implemented. Record-high levels of wheat exports and rebounding sales of fertilizers (except anhydrous ammonia) indicate Russia’s bluff, underscoring the real reasons Russia has been targeting Ukraine’s agriculture sector: to gain wartime economic and political advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agriculture and food security are central to Russia’s war strategy. Ukraine’s agricultural sector has been a major target of Russia’s attacks since February 2022. Ukraine’s agricultural production, exports, and GDP have declined as a direct result. Russia’s war in Ukraine has also led to historic disruptions to global agriculture, energy, and fertilizer markets, with food insecurity increasing among millions as a result. Russia has exploited food insecurity in low- and lower-middle-income countries for its benefit in two ways: (1) by aiming to decrease (or even eliminate) Ukraine as a source of food for these countries, thereby decreasing Ukraine’s potential influence in these places, and (2) by increasing these countries’ reliance on Russia as a source of food, thereby increasing Russia’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2022, it is apparent that Russia’s production and exports of food has increased, and that Ukraine’s has decreased. The data presented here sheds light regarding the specific regions to which Russia’s exports have increased and the regions to which Ukraine has exported less because of Russia’s war. Time and innovations in trade data will further clarify the patterns explained here. Without a significant change in the course of the war, however, one can expect Russia to continue to use food and fertilizer as potent soft power tools, and to continue to capitalize on the destruction of Ukraine’s agriculture sector and the damage done to global food security as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（28日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第34日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。辯方向陳展示數段訊息，以確認黎提出建議時有禮貌，惟陳雖然認同黎的語氣可謂客氣，但是當他親自提出建議的時候，「我好難置之不理咁囉。」辯方另指黎智英從不曾主張港獨，陳確認未曾聽過他有如此主張。惟當辯方指黎更加反對港獨，陳僅說：「我冇深入同佢討論過呢個問題」，也不記得黎有否使用過「我反對港獨」這類字眼來表達意見。陳另指黎建議找時評作者桑普撰文，但是他曾主張港獨，高層討論過相關法律風險之後，最後沒有邀請他撰文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第13天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻繼續盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英提議時語氣客氣-惟我好難置之不理&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英提議時語氣客氣 惟「我好難置之不理」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方昨日提到黎智英提出建議時態度有禮貌，他今向陳沛敏展示數段訊息以作確認。2018年5月6日，黎向陳傳送訊息：「沛敏，例如今日的頭條我們是否可以找退休警官或前 ICAC 官員撰寫些 insight 融合其中？Jist (Just) a thought. Thanks, Jimmy」；2019年4月8日，黎向陳轉發民主黨李永達的訊息：「可否考慮將其中幾個重點/分析，在新聞版逐日詳細寫，等讀者易消化」，並稱：「以上是李永達提議，是否可以像他提議再處理，或甚至找到這人訪問，可以不出面用背影出現？謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，從以上訊息可見，黎是否有禮貌地提議。陳沛敏指：「佢個語氣係客氣啦，可以咁講，但係係佢親自提出（建議）嘅話，我好難置之不理咁囉。」陳續指，時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹有時都會知道黎的建議，張會向她查問進展，「咁我會視之為我要執行嘅事囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英轉發香港監察新聞稿-陳沛敏理解黎作為老闆推薦報導&quot;&gt;黎智英轉發香港監察新聞稿 陳沛敏：理解黎作為老闆推薦報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示黎智英與陳沛敏之間的 WhatsApp 訊息紀錄，黎向陳轉發來自「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）的訊息和新聞稿，黎並稱：「Don’t know what you want to do with it. It’s from Ben Rogers.」，陳則回覆黎「他有傳給我們，thanks」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方稱，黎傳送上述訊息、提出建議之後，便沒有任何跟進，由陳決定做法如何。陳則認為，黎既已將她的聯絡電話交給羅傑斯，讓羅傑斯可以直接向她傳送新聞稿，「點解又要透過黎生，又要再傳多一次畀我呢？」因此她當時的認知是，羅傑斯會覺得若然直接傳送新聞稿給她，「我哋會未夠重視啦」，所以黎在知道羅傑斯會直接傳送給她和《蘋果》編輯的情況下，依然會替羅傑斯傳送多一次給他們，「我會理解係，黎生作為一個老闆，佢會推薦我哋出呢個新聞稿囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指黎的做法可以有另一個詮釋，因黎是羅傑斯的朋友，所以黎認為自己有責任傳送新聞稿給編輯，但具體做法則交給編輯決定。惟陳堅稱她當時的理解是上述提及的理解，又形容黎「似乎好重視 Benedict Rogers 同埋佢個機構嘅事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指正如訊息顯示，她回覆黎：「他有傳給我們，thanks」，用意是想「婉轉地話畀黎生聽，我哋其實已經收到啦」，可是正如早前庭上展示的訊息可見，每當有羅傑斯和香港監察的新聞稿，黎便會轉發給她。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏若黎認為事情不重要-大可以叫對方直接傳送新聞稿給同事&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：若黎認為事情不重要 大可以叫對方直接傳送新聞稿給同事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示另一組訊息，羅傑斯向黎傳送一份給被捕香港示威者的公開信，並說：「I was asked if I would release an open letter to detainees to encourage them, and so attach it here. If you felt able to cover it that would be great.」；黎回覆羅傑斯「I’ll send to my publisher for her to decide. Thanks, Jimmy」。黎之後轉發以上兩則訊息給陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，上述訊息的其中一種解讀可以是黎不想明確答覆羅傑斯可否報導，而是交由陳沛敏決定。法官李運騰修正問法，問陳認為有沒有可能黎並不是在給予指示，而她覺得黎在給予指示，只是她的個人感覺。惟陳表示：「我覺得可能性唔大囉」，因為如果黎認為事情根本不重要，他大可以叫對方直接將新聞稿傳送給同事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏確認有時黎會給予指示&quot;&gt;陳沛敏確認有時黎會給予指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年3月29日訊息紀錄，羅傑斯指與英國保守黨人權委員會成員裴德倫（Luke de Pulford）撰寫了評論文章，希望《蘋果》可以報導；黎回覆羅傑斯，會交予陳沛敏和主理網站的時任總編輯羅偉光處理。其後黎向陳轉發上述訊息，並稱「Please see what you can do to help Ben. Thanks, Jimmy」。陳回覆「收到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎的訊息看起來較像「指示」，多於「提議」。陳表示「字面上可以咁講」。辯方繼而指此類情況是例外情況，問陳是否同意。陳僅表示說不出頻率，但她憑早前的訊息，例如黎就美國大選提出個人見解，或在7.1衝擊立法會事件之後感覺到要求採訪某些人，「我都會覺得係指示囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問陳是否同意黎很少就其建議作出跟進。陳說「可以咁講」，但是黎不只向她落指示，例如張劍虹也會知道這些指示，「咁張劍虹先生都會嚟問我跟進成點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏確認831放頭版-因有新聞價值-同時意識到黎很重視警暴新聞&quot;&gt;陳沛敏確認8.31放頭版 因有新聞價值 同時意識到黎很重視警暴新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示陳沛敏與時任執行總編輯林文宗之間的訊息紀錄，林向陳說：「我已跟社長打了招呼，星期一報紙頭版開天窗，並會有段文字交代一下我們支持罷工，但基於社會角色欲罷不能之類。」陳庭上稱當時將此決定告訴張劍虹，但不知道張有否轉告黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄又顯示，在8.31太子站事件之後，林向陳表示：「我改太子站無差別打人做A1」、「臥底警察做A2」、「有打人，有攬住喊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱當時她已經下班，不在公司，因為8.31事件比較夜發生，林便通知她會把原本的「臥底警」頭版報導調往A2，改以8.31事件作為頭版，「當然我係同意做A1嘅，因為我喺電視睇新聞，同埋睇到社交媒體嘅一啲片段，同埋輿論嘅即時反應，咁我覺得（8.31事件）可以做A1嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問，是否因為8.31太子站是一件有新聞價值的事件，而且陳反對「警暴」，所以決定做頭版。陳確認是，但她同時補充，正如她早前作供提及，她與林文宗都意識到黎很重視警暴新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英提議邀請桑普撰文-後者曾主張港獨-陳沛敏考慮法律風險後最終未有邀稿&quot;&gt;黎智英提議邀請桑普撰文 後者曾主張港獨 陳沛敏：考慮法律風險後最終未有邀稿&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示陳沛敏與楊清奇之間的 WhatsApp 訊息，陳曾經向楊提議邀請前《有線新聞》林妙茵撰文，又轉發社運攝影師「蕭雲」的投稿文章給楊。辯方問陳是否向楊提議，然後交由楊決定是否採用。陳則表示她在訊息中並不是「提議」，只是當有人投稿，她會傳送給楊。辯方則指這與黎智英的做法無異，分別在於黎的身份是一名老闆。陳僅指雖然她有份簽署批准楊請假，但是她不會過問論壇版的事務，新聞部與論壇版之間可謂獨立運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;二人的訊息顯示，陳曾提到黎建議找時評作者桑普撰文，問論壇版是否有位；楊則回覆「他的文章怪怪的，而且公開主張港獨。所以，一直沒敢讓他開專欄。否則，交了稿，出唔出都麻煩」。陳庭上解釋，張劍虹轉述黎智英提議邀請桑普，惟討論過相關法律風險之後，最後沒有邀請他撰文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英反對港獨-陳沛敏未曾與黎深入討論&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英反對港獨 陳沛敏：未曾與黎深入討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，談到港獨這話題，黎智英從不曾主張港獨，問陳是否同意。陳僅回答：「冇聽過佢有咁嘅主張。」辯方指，黎不只沒有提倡港獨，更加反對港獨，問以陳所知這說法是否正確。陳僅說：「我冇深入同佢討論過呢個問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問陳是否知道，黎有否曾經說過他「反對港獨」。陳回答，她不記得黎有否使用過「我反對港獨」這類字眼來表達他的意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方梁振英追擊廣告商-致蘋果收入減少&quot;&gt;辯方：梁振英追擊廣告商 致《蘋果》收入減少&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另提到，壹傳媒集團在2015至2018年之間錄得虧蝕，而黎智英在這段時期並不投入於集團事務。2018年之後，黎變得積極地參與在《蘋果》事務，並於2019年重新擔任壹傳媒集團主席，自此集團錄得的虧損有所減少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，一般報紙的主要收入來源理應是廣告商，而且是銷售報紙所得收入的兩倍，可是自2020年起，《蘋果》的情況「掉返轉」，即銷售報紙和讀者訂閱所得的收入，是多於廣告收入。陳則表示不太記得，只記得《蘋果》的訂閱人數顯著增加。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，自2019年3月起，《蘋果》的廣告收入大大地減少，因為前特首梁振英發動一個針對《蘋果》的「運動（campaign）」，即梁會將在《蘋果》的廣告客戶資料發布於梁的個人臉書，明顯地想廣告客戶不要在《蘋果》落廣告。而這「運動」引起了組織「無國界記者」的關注，曾發表聲明反對該「運動」。陳表示記得上述事件令《蘋果》收入減少，但是她不記得減少幅度和數據。辯方透露稍後會在證人講述相關證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（28日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第34日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。辯方指黎智英在《國安法》生效之後，向陳表示：「看了國安法細節嚇了一跳」，並籲「先要想好策略對付，不容魯莽」，意思是叫她行事不要違反《國安法》。陳亦確認高層之間曾經討論報導時避免使用某些字眼，又在黎還柙之後研究將其文章和直播節目下架。辯方指出，黎從沒有指示陳做任何違反《國安法》的事情，陳同意但同時補充，她當時雖然不肯定黎的文章是否違法，但是的確有在《蘋果》實體報紙和網站發布黎的專欄文章和直播節目。她確認如果當時意識到文章和節目觸犯國安法，是不會發布，「但係黎生嘅文，我哋基本上唔會改動，而 Live Chat 我哋更加係冇得參與。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第13天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻繼續盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英訊息稱不容魯莽-陳沛敏確認其後商討報導字眼研下架黎文章-免違國安法&quot;&gt;黎智英訊息稱「不容魯莽」 陳沛敏確認其後商討報導字眼、研下架黎文章 免違國安法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方談及2020年7月《國安法》生效，黎智英向陳沛敏傳送訊息：「沛敏，看了國安法細節嚇了一跳」，並指：「香港將無法治和自由，政府行政無法無天，泛民寸步難移，動彈不得，先要想好策略對付，不容魯莽。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，以陳的理解，黎以上訊息的意思是否籲她行事不要違反《國安法》。陳表示「係」，但同時補充，正因為如此，所以當她見到黎繼續進行直播對談節目時，「我同同事都有啲驚訝囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，所以陳與其他編輯採取行動避免違反《國安法》，包括討論避免使用某些字眼，又研究將黎智英的文章和直播節目下架。辯方遂展示訊息紀錄，在2020年12月11日，即黎還柙之後，張劍虹向陳沛敏傳送訊息：「老闆在副刊、Twitter live、Twitter post、外媒訪問，不少被列出來做證據」，又表示會徵詢《蘋果》內部法律顧問和外間法律意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎從沒指示做違反國安法事情-陳確認-惟補充有份刊登&quot;&gt;辯方：黎從沒指示做違反國安法事情 陳確認 惟補充有份刊登&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又提到，陳早前作供表示2020年8月警方拘捕黎智英及搜查壹傳媒大樓時，她不認為《蘋果》有做任何違反事情。陳則解釋，當時雖然警方搜查報館，但是他們的講法是並非針對新聞材料，加上牽涉案件的人例如李宇軒，都不是《蘋果》的人，所以她理解警方的行動與《蘋果》所作的報導並沒有關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EVJ2M1v.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，黎從沒有指示陳做任何違反《國安法》的事情。陳說：「可以咁講。」她其後補充，黎的專欄文章和直播節目分別透過《蘋果》實體報紙和網站發布，雖然她與其他同事在內容上不能參與，但他們的確有刊登黎的文章，當然刊登時不肯定文章是否違法，「但喺咁嘅情況下，都係登咗出嚟囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，如果當時意識到文章和節目觸犯《國安法》，陳是否不會發布？陳表示：「可以咁講」，張劍虹亦曾提醒他們小心處理，「但係黎生嘅文，我哋基本上唔會改動，而 Live Chat 我哋更加係冇得參與。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱黎純粹轉發訊息惟陳沛敏誤解為落指示&quot;&gt;辯方稱黎純粹轉發訊息惟陳沛敏誤解為落指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前證供提到2020年7月14日時任美國總統特朗普簽署《香港自治法》之後，黎智英向陳沛敏傳送相關行政命令內文，訊息中包含一句：「I’d say we should work up a shit list on those involved in censorship, which can include intimidation.」，因應黎的訊息，陳曾跟同事商量。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方的說法是，上述連同行政命令和含「shit list」字眼的訊息，均是另一人的訊息，而黎純粹將該訊息轉發給陳，因「shit list」並不是黎慣用的行文字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指陳有機會誤解黎的訊息為一個「指示」，問陳是否同意。陳則說：「但係我會覺得好奇怪，無端端整段咁嘅嘢畀我睇」，黎亦未有交代訊息是由誰人撰寫，「咁我又唔明佢嘅用意係咩囉。」辯方表示會在陳詞中處理此議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎從沒叫其他人撐住-陳沛敏不同意&quot;&gt;辯方：黎從沒叫其他人「撐住」 陳沛敏不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方庭上播放《蘋果》25週年慶典的錄影片段，黎智英在壹傳媒大樓內向員工發表講話，陳確認當時她在場。辯方指，黎說：「無人會迫你哋點樣去做，無人會迫到你哋做烈士」，意思是他不會叫人去違反《國安法》。陳則回應：「我諗佢（黎）呢個係一個好空泛嘅講法，啫係佢話喺呢度返工都係你嘅決定嚟嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎智英在2020年12月還柙之後，曾說自己會「撐住」，但沒有叫其他外面的人「撐住」。陳堅稱：「我記憶中，佢有叫公司嘅人撐住囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bxHYFUz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示張劍虹於2020年12月7日傳送給陳沛敏的訊息：「老闆說，不要把他新聞放太大，我說已經沒有」，又列出黎的說話：「1. 不用擔心我；2. 對我來講，係造化，有機會定落嚟睇吓書；3. 亂世，仍然要往前行」，陳回覆張：「收到他很勇敢，宗教信仰也有幫助」。辯方指以上訊息並沒有提及「撐住」。陳僅說：「佢係冇用到呢個字眼囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，事實上陳探訪黎的時候，黎亦沒有叫外面的人「撐住」，並向陳出示由她本人撰寫的文章，當中提及她第二次到監獄探訪黎：「他說讀報看到有關47人案的文章，很感動。『我會撐住，但我唔會叫出面啲人撐住囉。』他的意思是，香港情況太壞，叫人撐住，撐下去的人承擔的代價可能很大。」陳則回應，根據撰寫文章當時的語境，黎是指初選案，因為他有些朋友來自政界，所以「出面啲人」是指政界和社運界朋友，而黎的意思是叫這些朋友撐住，代價會很大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏確認蘋果報導角度不變-於法律限制之內&quot;&gt;陳沛敏確認《蘋果》報導角度不變 於法律限制之內&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方在庭上播放2021年5月《蘋果》全體員工大會的錄音，張劍虹發言時稱：「我哋唔係犯法，我哋唔係一個犯罪組織，我哋係做新聞㗎嘛」，辯方問陳是否相信張的說法。陳表示：「我當時係相信張先生講嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，張在大會中引述黎智英的獄中信：「新聞自由的工作是危險的，大家保重，盡量要小心。」辯方指張的意思是不但高層要小心，前線同事也要小心。陳確認張有說過上述說話，但她補充張同時有說：「咁樣唔代表我哋褪呔，《蘋果》絕對唔會褪呔。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指《蘋果》的報導角度不會改變，但同時會在法律限制之內。陳回答：「可以咁講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, only a small part of this aid is being directly used to help current businesses and attract new investors. So far, the West has committed around $2 billion through the World Bank’s Economic Resilience Action program, which aims to provide financial and advisory support for Ukraine’s private sector. In comparison, government-to-government commitments to Ukraine between January 24, 2022, and January 15, 2023, totaled $154 billion, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine also needs to attract significant foreign direct investment to transform and modernize its economy. Although it is risky to invest in the country due to the war, not all of Ukraine has seen damage or is in active combat; less than 20 percent of Ukraine’s territory is currently illegally occupied. Regions that do not require demining — primarily in the western part of the country — are ripe for business opportunities. Investors and international partners do not have to wait for every part of Ukraine’s territory to be freed from Russian troops to start operating there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Although it is risky to invest in the country due to the war, not all of Ukraine has seen damage or is in active combat; less than 20 percent of Ukraine’s territory is currently illegally occupied.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting the private sector is an area in which international financial institutions (IFIs) and development finance institutions (DFIs) could do more, even amid the war. Strengthening Ukraine’s private sector in the present will fundamentally shape how recovery efforts proceed during the postwar period. As these institutions approach their operations in Ukraine, they should be more creative, coordinated, and willing to take on risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financing-challenges&quot;&gt;Financing Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses in Ukraine are facing many obstacles. As the war drags on with no immediate prospect for a political settlement, this situation complicates the outlook for the private sector. There are many financing hurdles, including a lack of affordable credit, a dearth of equity investments, and a disrupted insurance market. Additionally, scant health and life insurance coverage in war zones, requirements for new construction to have bomb shelters, and expensive security details compound the costs that firms confront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are finding it particularly difficult to attract capital or get credit at reasonable rates. Most of the multilateral funding goes toward larger companies, ones that had been receiving money even before Russia’s full-scale invasion. This, in turn, affects the client pool for the banking sector. Companies are also unable to access medium- to long-term loans. There are some sources of more affordable capital for SMEs, such as the German-funded 5–7–9 interest-subsidy program through the Business Development Fund, yet these programs are still limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there is a major mismatch between the demand and supply of capital in Ukraine. The destruction of manufacturing facilities, logistical lines, and supply chains has forced some companies to rebuild their business models from scratch. While a few were able to adapt to the war, many businesses need new sources of capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies operating in Ukraine and potential investors also voice unease over political uncertainty and the unavailability of political and war risk insurance mechanisms. Risk-mitigation and risk-sharing instruments are crucial in unleashing the private sector in Ukraine, especially as the war wages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Risk-mitigation and risk-sharing instruments are crucial in unleashing the private sector in Ukraine, especially as the war wages.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;barriers-to-doing-business&quot;&gt;Barriers to Doing Business&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond access to finance, there are other hurdles for the private sector. Even before the war, the conditions for doing business in Ukraine were not optimal. The country attracted little foreign direct investment (FDI) because of its difficult business climate. From 2011 to 2021, the net inflow of FDI in neighboring Poland and Romania averaged $16.9 billion and $5.4 billion per year, respectively. Meanwhile, during the same period, Ukraine saw an average FDI net inflow of $4.3 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank’s Doing Business project ranked Ukraine at 64 out of 190 economies in 2020. Ukraine scored higher on indicators related to starting a business and dealing with construction permits, but electricity access and resolving insolvency weighed down the overall score. Ukraine also has a negative reputation in terms of corruption. For 2023, Ukraine ranked 104 out of 180 countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index with a score of 36 out of 100. Although the score is low, it is Ukraine’s best result since 2012 because of various measures that Kyiv has instituted in the past two years to combat corruption. By gaining three points, Ukraine showed one of the best improvements of any country in 2023 despite the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Volodymyr Zelensky demonstrated his willingness to uproot sources of corruption by removing over a dozen officials in the Ministry of Defense in January 2023. Moreover, the government has ramped up criminal proceedings against suspected perpetrators, introducing much-needed judiciary reforms and a competitive selection process for the heads of the main anti-corruption agencies, along with other steps such as improvements in public procurement. As a result of these efforts, the New Europe Center, along with several civil society and media organizations partners in Ukraine — the National Interests Advocacy Network, Anti-Corruption Action Center, Dejure Foundation, European Pravda, Centre of Policy and Legal Reform, Transparency International Ukraine, Ukrainian Center for Independent Political Research, and Detector Media — gave Ukraine an 8.1 out of 10 in its September 2023 joint assessment of Ukraine’s implementation of recommendations for EU candidates. Ukraine scored the highest in media regulation reforms and weakest in constitutional court reform and fighting against money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mass exodus of working-age talent also presents a challenge for the private sector. According to the United Nations, there were 6.5 million Ukrainian refugees as of January 2024 and 3.7 million internally displaced as of September 2023; approximately 14.6 million people in the country are projected to require humanitarian assistance in 2024. In addition, many internally displaced Ukrainians do not have the infrastructure and housing that would enable them to thrive professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personnel shortages are a significant problem for labor-intensive sectors such as construction and metallurgy. A December 2022 survey by Deloitte and the American Chamber of Commerce found major concerns among business managers regarding how to attract, retain, and ensure the safety of talent during wartime. However, this brain drain is not new, since many Ukrainians were already leaving the country before the war. The difference, however, is that the human capital shortage has significantly intensified and is affecting every sector of Ukraine’s economy, including information technology (IT), which has been a catalyst for economic innovation and growth even during the current conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;support-from-the-international-community&quot;&gt;Support from the International Community&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies in Ukraine are operating in a difficult war environment. The international community plays a crucial role in supporting these firms with tools adapted to wartime realities. DFIs and multilateral development banks (MDBs) need to be creative and further adapt their operations and capital-deployment mechanisms to support a country at war. How can they go about this task?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, these institutions can consolidate their currently scattered efforts. For example, although there are multiple war insurance programs (see the appendix for a list), these are isolated and insufficient. Businesses are struggling to know where to look and whom to trust. A consolidation effort could ameliorate the problem, for example, by setting up a user-friendly and transparent portal. If an investor is willing to co-invest or share the risk of an investment with another party, this could have a powerful effect in catalyzing Ukraine’s private sector. As such, it is essential that Ukraine’s DFI and MDB partners coordinate and pool together resources, which will alleviate the risk burden for any one institution and scale both financing and insurance for Ukrainian companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as mentioned earlier, many of these institutions are refinancing to reduce their risk exposure but not making new investments. To complicate matters, some institutions do not allow their staff to be on the ground in Ukraine to execute due diligence on local projects. There is a need to attract new investments in Ukraine rather than simply continue using grants to support existing projects, refinance clients, or fund only technical assistance and policy work. Multilateral institutions could establish new vehicles such as investment funds or enterprise funds that would provide targeted technical assistance in combination with their debt products and support for private equity. The impact that new capital can produce in this environment is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, there is a need for financial innovation. These institutions can provide capital to help jump-start creative financial initiatives in Ukraine that the private sector can then replicate at a much larger scale. Risk sharing, including with commercial banks, can be highly beneficial. To unleash this money effectively, these institutions should experiment with various approaches before they “triple down” on those that work best. While ambitious multi-million- and billion-dollar projects are welcome, there is need for small-scale community pilot programs that can bolster Ukraine’s resilience. For example, diversifying Ukraine’s water and energy systems to smaller-scale sources would make its infrastructure less of an easy target for missile attacks. Furthermore, multilateral projects should prioritize businesses that have a rebounding effect: those that strengthen Ukraine’s EU accession and internal absorption capacity, as well as reduce trade turnover bottlenecks such as border controls. There is an ongoing discussion regarding whether to allow multilateral institutions to use hybrid capital products to invest in start-ups but with capped returns in case the country’s recovery happens more quickly than predicted. This could encourage a more level playing field within the business environment and help ensure that equity stays within the country and thus encourages faster recovery. The opposite of this happened in 2015 when Ukraine’s government, to avoid a default, agreed with its creditors to a 20 percent write-down and delayed maturities in exchange for linking the securities to Ukraine’s GDP growth without capping the investment returns (more commonly known as GDP-linked warrants).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, targeting projects and companies that can create jobs for Ukrainians — and thus attract Ukrainian externally displaced people back home — is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DFIs and multilateral development banks (MDBs) need to be creative and further adapt their operations and capital-deployment mechanisms to support a country at war.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Ukraine’s partners could also do more to improve governance and support the country’s fight against corruption, including through technical assistance and training programs. This is an area in which the international community can play a critical role, providing both advice and pressure for reforms. Ukrainian civil society and independent journalists are important allies in this fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, for DFIs and IFIs to be effective, they need to be more innovative and collaborative, willing to take more risk and to understand what specifically works in the Ukrainian market. By demonstrating a willingness to experiment and set up collaborative frameworks, they can catalyze the flow of more private capital into Ukraine. Much of this will require more effective coordination and pooling of resources among institutions, allowing them to co-invest in projects without repeating or overlapping efforts. Moreover, these institutions need to create concrete plans for execution and set specific performance indicators for measuring results and holding themselves accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-the-ukrainian-government&quot;&gt;The Role of the Ukrainian Government&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Ukraine needs to make more significant governance and economic reforms to reduce barriers to doing business. Kyiv is working with partners on legislation and initiatives that will improve the business climate. For example, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is assisting the National Bank of Ukraine in aligning its regulations, policies, and practices with those of the European Union regarding bank and capital market supervision. Moreover, Ukraine is working on public-private partnership (PPP) legislation that should provide more flexibility and speed for these types of ventures. Having the appropriate PPP legislation can play a significant part in Ukraine’s recovery, as international investors will be able to contribute a wide range of assets. Whatever the law is on paper, it will have to ensure that in practice there is a robust, transparent, fair, and open PPP framework that encourages privatization in key sectors such as energy and transportation. As part of a reform initiative that started in 2023, Kyiv is in the process of removing and updating hundreds of documents to boost Ukraine’s business climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is also developing an Export Credit Agency (ECA) that will help insure investments into the country. In April 2023, Kyiv announced it will provide state guarantees such as war insurance for domestic exporters via this agency. In addition, the Ukrainian parliament passed draft law No. 9015 at the end of November 2023 to provide war insurance for investments of both international companies and Ukrainian companies. Currently, the Ukrainian government is communicating with the World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the EBRD, and other donors regarding the need for $100 million to reinsure its ECA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has obviously disrupted Ukraine’s financial attractiveness, so Kyiv is offering special investment agreements, according to the Ukraine Investment Promotion Office (UkraineInvest). These include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;up to 30 percent state support of the investment’s capital expenditure;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;state funding for the construction of related infrastructure;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;up to 10 years of corporate income tax (CIT) relief for most companies; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CIT relief for electric vehicle manufacturers through 2036.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-special-role-of-frozen-russian-central-bank-assets&quot;&gt;The Special Role of Frozen Russian Central Bank Assets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these mechanisms, there are untapped resources that could be used to buttress the private sector. There are currently more than $300 billion in Russian central bank assets in Group of Seven (G7) countries that have been frozen since the full-scale invasion. Ukraine has suggested using these assets to back the issuance of reconstruction bonds and as loss-absorbing, risk-curtailing capital. Kyiv has also demonstrated that the seizure of Russian assets is possible, as it relocated at least 28.3 billion hryvnias ($784 million) to its state coffers between February 2022 and November 2023. These assets could also be used to set up new finance vehicles, such as investment funds through which donors could provide a first-loss tranche to attract other investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are legal, economic, and reputational arguments for seizing these assets, and leading experts have analyzed these issues and proposed solutions to move forward. Moreover, some countries have taken initial steps to make use of these assets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June 2022, Canada implemented measures to enable it to seize and sell Russian assets that belong to individuals on the country’s sanctions list. More recently, the World Refugee and Migration Council, a refugee advocacy group chaired by Canada’s former minister of foreign affairs Lloyd Axworthy, advocated for a trust fund that would distribute seized Russian assets to Ukrainians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On November 8, 2023, the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs approved a bill to transfer billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets for Ukraine’s recovery. The bill also prohibits the return of these assets to Russia until the Kremlin fully compensates Ukraine for the damage it has caused. On January 23, 2024, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (REPO) for Ukrainians Act, which paves the way for the United States to confiscate the assets and transfer them to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Belgium holds about two-thirds of the EU-housed Russian assets via its Euroclear Despite Belgium being one of the largest critics of the seizing of Russian assets, Prime Minister Alexander De Croo has said the country is putting together a €1.7 billion fund for Ukraine financed by tax revenue generated from the seized Russian assets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In January 2023, the European Council Legal Service came up with a plan for how to transfer close to $40 billion in frozen assets to fund Ukraine’s recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and its international partners need to find practical solutions to sustain Ukraine’s economy, especially to support the private sector. Creativity will be at the core of finding such a multilayered approach. By working with Ukrainian stakeholders and private actors, development and finance institutions can explore innovative tools and avenues to support current businesses in the short run and attract new investments in the medium run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is huge business potential in Ukraine, where investors can make significant returns. However, some investors are more skeptical and believe the country is currently more of a charity case. Regardless, the opportunity is there — especially within the context of Ukraine’s path toward EU accession, availability of raw materials, large consumer base, and high-quality and relatively inexpensive labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（27日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第33日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。2020年12月黎智英被起訴及還柙，群組訊息紀錄顯示高層之間曾討論報導字眼，包括「閹割選舉」和「武漢肺炎」，其後決定棄用「武漢肺炎」。時任警務處處長鄧炳強曾稱傳媒違國安也要付代價，不過陳指即使黎智英還柙之後，直至2021年5月召開員工大會這段期間，《蘋果》從未被指稱新聞報導有問題，所以沒有印象任何人說要更改報導角度，「大方向冇更改。」陳於2021年6月被拘捕，之後獲警方擔保，她稱數日後正式請辭，並工作至《蘋果》最後一天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第12天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏稱張劍虹曾吩咐下架黎智英文章-惟不記得最終有否下架&quot;&gt;陳沛敏稱張劍虹曾吩咐下架黎智英文章 惟不記得最終有否下架&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方圍繞黎智英在2020年12月還柙之後的時期提問。控方指根據紀錄，陳沛敏先後於2020年12月10日和2021年3月22日到監獄探訪黎。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年12月13日的《蘋果》頭版，題為〈控勾結境外危害國安禁保釋 黎智英國安法前開 Twitter 追蹤蓬佩奧蔡英文成「罪證」〉，版面有一張表格列出控方指證內容，包括黎所撰寫的文章和直播受訪言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問《蘋果》有否因應控方的指控而將黎的文章從網站下架。陳憶述時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹曾吩咐將一些黎的文章下架，但她不記得當時是在哪一個時間點，即不記得是在黎還柙之前還是之後發生。法官李運騰追問，該些文章最後有否下架，陳則稱：「我唔記得咗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;時任警務處長鄧炳強稱違國安要付代價-陳沛敏不記得蘋果有否因而改做法&quot;&gt;時任警務處長鄧炳強稱「違國安要付代價」 陳沛敏不記得《蘋果》有否因而改做法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2021年3月28日的《蘋果》頭版報導〈中大生揭國安審問過程 早被監視開file 鄰房偷聽盤問〉。首段提到：「港區國安法由去年6月30日起生效以來，至今已有數以百計香港人在這幅血紅幌子下被拘捕，他們當中有具備影響力的傳媒大亨，有誓言抗爭到底的民主派初選者，也有不過是熱愛自由的年輕人。」控方問「傳媒大亨」是否指黎智英，陳確認。控方問「血紅幌子」是指什麼，陳指是《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021年4月16日《蘋果》頭版標題為〈鄧炳強恫嚇傳媒：違國安要付代價 《蘋果》總編質疑鋪路嚴厲打壓〉。控方問，時任警務處處長鄧炳強作出報導所指的陳述之後，《蘋果》有否改變任何編採做法？陳則指：「唔記得有做過任何嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BQEe9FI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏高層曾開設群組討論報導字眼-免觸犯法律&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：高層曾開設群組討論報導字眼 免觸犯法律&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，張劍虹於2021年4月17日創立 WhatsApp 群組「應變小組」。陳確認，並稱因應《國安法》和警方指稱煽動的字眼，設立群組是為了討論報導所使用的字眼，加上同事亦就此有疑問，會問某些字眼：「用唔用得？」她指在創立群組之前，因應牽涉「光復香港 時代革命」口號的案件，高層之間當時曾經討論「針對嗰八個字，幾時用得、幾時唔用得」，或者是否刊登某些廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;群組訊息紀錄顯示，有群組成員轉述政治組同事詢問陳沛敏應否將「閹割選舉」改為「完善」，或改用「北京修改香港的選舉制度」。時任《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光之後回覆：「我與同事討論了，認為可繼續用閹割選舉，因為都係陳述事實；也有同事提出『武漢肺炎』，我認為可繼續用。如要引述官方聲明、文件必須提及，加『新冠肺炎』，顯示是官方或有關人士說法。如有其他情況、疑問，會聽同事意見，商量如何處理。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3VJRK6R.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前《蘋果日報》總編輯 羅偉光&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，群組會討論某些字眼在當時的社會氣氛和法律環境之下會否有問題，「加上鄧炳強亦都有嗰個講法啦，總編輯個判斷係，當時我哋唔再謹慎啲用字嘅話，會唔會犯咗鄧炳強講嘅情況呢？」，於是他們便就字眼提出討論，不希望《蘋果》實體報紙和網站版各有各做。她指，張劍虹和羅偉光商討之後，便在群組中表示會統一字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2021年4月18日的訊息紀錄，陳沛敏向當時管理論壇版的主筆楊清奇傳訊息：「老總決定，今起報道不用『武肺』，因此社論也不用，論壇則作者自決。編輯會通知社論其他作者。謝謝」，陳庭上確認「老總」是指時任總編輯羅偉光。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳並向楊轉發另一則訊息：「各位，我打倒昨日的我：武漢肺炎這題 tag，即日起暫時唔用，水印亦唔用。」該訊息指會以「最新疫情」、「疫苗接種」、「防疫措施」取代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英還柙之後-蘋果亦未被指稱新聞報導有問題-故大方向冇更改&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英還柙之後 《蘋果》亦未被指稱新聞報導有問題 故「大方向冇更改」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到高層於2021年5月曾召開《蘋果》員工大會，並展示2021年6月18日的《蘋果》報導〈夫︰她冷靜堅強鎮定 陳沛敏選擇留在災難現場〉，當中指：「早前在《蘋果》員工大會上，陳沛敏說過，即使有消息指《蘋果》會被取締，她都會留至最後一刻，『今時今日做《蘋果》，唔係純粹只想做記者，係 more than 一份工。』」陳確認有講過上述言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，有沒有任何人在該次員工大會上提及更改《蘋果》的報導角度。陳稱沒有。她其後補充道，由黎智英被拘捕、還柙直至5月的員工大會，其間「我哋都冇被直接話我哋嘅新聞報導有問題嘅」，因此她印象中除了更改「武漢肺炎」等一些字眼之外，便沒有印象任何人說要更改報導角度，「大方向冇更改。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏憶述被捕獲釋後辭職&quot;&gt;陳沛敏憶述被捕獲釋後辭職&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，陳沛敏及其他《蘋果》高層在2021年6月17日被警方拘捕，之後從警署獲釋。《蘋果》頭版報導稱：「陳神情略見疲累，向在場記者點頭道謝，表示得知張劍虹及羅偉光仍未獲釋，被當局以國安法起訴，感到難過，希望二人能盡早獲釋，今天將會到法庭支持二人。」報導又稱：「對於《蘋果日報》昨日仍能順利出版，陳沛敏感到『好感動』，勉勵同事『盡量做』，『過去40個鐘，我被拘捕，都知道公司《蘋果》同事都繼續好專業謹守崗位，繼續採訪新聞、報道新聞，我以佢哋自豪，辛苦哂佢哋』。」陳庭上確認以上皆是她當時的言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳確認她在6月18日深夜從警署獲釋，翌日則到法庭旁聽張劍虹和羅偉光提堂，之後並未有返回公司上班，因她請假一天，「因為我嗰時俾人扣咗40幾個鐘，個人都好攰」，於是她接受同事的建議休息。其後6月20日是星期日，所以她在6月21日（星期一）返回公司上班，並憶述她在當天向時任壹傳媒董事會主席葉一堅口頭上表明打算辭職，其後才正式遞交表格或辭職信，辭去副社長一職。不過陳提到「當時公司入面好混亂」，「連咩人可以批我張 form 都冇人知道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，根據公司註冊處紀錄，陳於6月25日正式辭去蘋果日報有限公司和蘋果日報印刷有限公司的董事職位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏同意最後一份蘋果印刷100萬份&quot;&gt;陳沛敏同意最後一份《蘋果》印刷100萬份&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，《蘋果日報》營運至2021年6月24日才停運，陳沛敏亦繼續工作直至當天。對於為何6月24日出版的《蘋果》實體報紙印刷100萬份，陳憶述當時發行部同事指這是最後一份出版的報紙，「應該好多人想買」，之後某位高層同事提議不如印100萬份，發行部同事經研究後認為他們有能力發行這個數量。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YNUFUvz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，所以陳是批准印刷100萬份？陳表示：「可以咁講。」她特別補充：「其實當時我覺得我嘅身位有啲尷尬，已經辭咗職，啫係我返緊去執緊嘢，但同事同我講嘅時候，我話：『OK呀，幾好吖，100萬份啦。』」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後向陳展示一張黎智英會見時任美國副總統彭斯的照片，要求陳辨認出相中哪一人是黎的助手 Mark Simon。陳指出坐在黎智英旁邊的一名男子就是 Mark Simon。控方表示盤問完畢，結束12日的主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（27日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第33日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。辯方開始盤問，並指《蘋果》不是「為批評而批評」，而是透過報導引起關注，希望使政府改變政策或施政，例如遊說撤回修例草案和阻止《國安法》實施。辯方又問陳沛敏是否同意《蘋果》有編採自主，陳則回答：「如果黎生冇出聲嘅時候，都係嘅。」陳舉例，當黎要求聘請某作者替《蘋果》撰寫時評文章，總編輯是不能提出反對。她又指若然黎就一些事很堅持他的意見，其意見會影響她的新聞決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏當黎智英冇出聲的時候-便有編採自主&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：當黎智英「冇出聲」的時候 便有編採自主&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問陳沛敏是否同意《蘋果》有編採自主。陳則回答：「如果黎生冇出聲嘅時候，都係嘅。」辯方指，黎智英並沒有參與編輯每日召開的3個會議，包括「鋤報會」、「初會」和「編前會議」，會議紀錄亦不會傳送給黎，報紙出版之前，樣版也不會先給黎過目。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯提問下，陳確認她是有豐富經驗的新聞工作者，在業界工作超過20年，在前線採訪過不同新聞，而且有一段時間主力負責保安和人權新聞。陳又確認，她曾經因為緬甸大選報導而獲頒「人權新聞獎」，被囚禁的中國異見作家劉曉波於2010年獲頒諾貝爾和平獎，陳亦親赴瑞典採訪頒獎禮。辯方指，陳在業界工作的時間裡，一直做出高水準的報導。陳回應：「我希望我係啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏確認蘋果擁抱人權自由新聞自由等價值&quot;&gt;陳沛敏確認《蘋果》擁抱人權、自由、新聞自由等價值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到是否與黎智英的價值觀一致，包括相信民主，陳沛敏表示她相信香港是適合發展民主的政治制度。此外，陳確認她相信人權、自由、新聞自由和政府透明度，而以上均是《蘋果日報》所擁抱的價值。至於同事是否都擁抱以上價值，她稱不能代其他同事回答，除了一些共事多年的同事之外，「如果要好科學咁答係咪 majority，我唔敢答。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方提問下，陳逐一確認據她所知，時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹、時任《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光、時任執行總編輯林文宗和主筆馮偉光均擁有一致價值觀，即相信人權、自由和新聞自由。陳亦相信他們反對警暴，對修例草案和《國安法》有憂慮。惟她不肯定時任英文版主筆楊清奇和時任動新聞平台總監張志偉是否擁抱上述價值觀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方蘋果非為批評而批評-冀引關注改政策阻警暴&quot;&gt;辯方：《蘋果》非「為批評而批評」 冀引關注、改政策、阻警暴&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，《蘋果》經常發表帶批判性的報導，例如前財政司司長梁錦松在公布財政預算案之前偷步買車，顯示《蘋果》在揭發政府濫權上是走在前端。陳回答：「可以咁講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，《蘋果》並不是「為批評而批評」，而是透過報導引起關注，希望使政府改變政策或施政。陳稱：「可以咁講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，陳早前作證表明不認同警方過份使用武力，而《蘋果》報導「警暴」的目的是希望說服當權者約束自己不要過份用武。陳同樣稱：「可以咁講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方蘋果報導反修例示威國安法-冀游說政府&quot;&gt;辯方：《蘋果》報導反修例示威、國安法 冀游說政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，陳早前表明反對《逃犯條例》修訂草案，《蘋果》亦針對此議題發表很多帶批判性的文章，目的是為了遊說政府撤回修例草案。此外，《蘋果》以大篇幅報導反修例示威，顯示大批市民反對修例，目的是游說當權者修例並不是一個好主意，問陳是否同意。陳表示：「都有咁嘅作用。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在《國安法》實施之前，《蘋果》發布很多關於《國安法》的文章，問陳是否反對《國安法》。陳表示：「會有憂慮」，即是「傳媒界嗰種擔心」。辯方指陳擔心隨著《國安法》實施，新聞自由和其他個人自由會減少。陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問所以陳是否反對《國安法》實施？陳則說：「啫我覺得如果要推行嘅話要有多啲咨詢，同埋收集多啲香港人嘅意見。」她並確認《蘋果》因而會有很多具批判性的文章，「不過有啲係反映黎生嘅立場。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方繼而問陳是否同意，黎擔心《國安法》影響新聞自由，和削弱其他方面的個人自由，因此黎盡其所能地作出游說，冀阻止國安法生效。陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英提出制裁時-未有明文禁止呼籲制裁&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英提出制裁時 未有明文禁止呼籲制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指黎一直以來都主張和平示威，問陳是否同意。惟陳僅指：「喺2019年之前，係嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，在人大通過《國安法》之前，黎智英的確有提出制裁等施壓方式，以游說當權者不要通過《國安法》，然而當時並未有任何法律禁止市民呼籲制裁。陳同意。辯方指，因此《蘋果》和黎智英作出批評是為了游說當權者不要實施國安法。陳稱：「係，但係都係黎先生想透過《蘋果》，想做到呢個效果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏確認蘋果揭發醜聞和濫權-直至結束營運為止&quot;&gt;陳沛敏確認《蘋果》揭發醜聞和濫權 直至結束營運為止&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方談及《蘋果》一貫立場，遂向陳展示2015年6月19日的《蘋果》20週年報慶文章，題為〈爆料新聞背後Juicy：記者揼石仔 追查真相〉。辯方指，版面下方有一篇由陳撰寫的「後記」，題為〈毋忘《蘋果》初衷〉，她當時是《蘋果》總編輯。文章提到：「創刊以來，《蘋果》屢揭權貴醜聞，不單為爆為 juicy，更因為我們相信第四權的角色。」陳確認《蘋果》一直以來有揭發醜聞和濫權，直至它結束營運為止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到陳2021年6月被捕之後，《蘋果》於同月18日刊出的報導引述她說：「今時今日做《蘋果》，唔係純粹只想做記者，係 more than 一份工。」辯方問陳「多於一份工」是否指第四權，陳則回答「包含第四權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏如果黎智英堅持己見-會影響到蘋果新聞決定&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：如果黎智英堅持己見 會影響到《蘋果》新聞決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指根據訊息紀錄，陳沛敏和林文宗曾於2019年1月討論草擬《蘋果日報編輯室約章》，期間特別強調要納入「編採自主」和「編業分離」原則。陳確認，她又補充「編業分離」中的「業」是指廣告，因此意思是編採和廣告分離。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述《約章》草稿第五條指，新聞報道秉持真實、公正、客觀、獨立原則，這並非等於將所有各方觀點、所有資料全部鋪陳出來，而是不受任何政府、商業、宗教或其他利益左右，力求報導全面的事實真相，不要有偏袒或畏懼，要給予受質疑的人發言、充份解釋和交代的機會。陳確認這是她當時所相信的，因此寫入約章中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另引述《約章》草稿第十條指，總編輯為《蘋果》編採事務最高負責人，秉持新聞專業理念和操守，落實報社之編採方針，並遵守此約章，維護《蘋果》公信力。辯方問陳，就《蘋果》而言，這條是否真確。陳則指在實際運作層面而言，例如當黎要求聘請某作者替《蘋果》撰寫時評文章，「總編輯喺呢段時間係羅偉光啦，我理解羅偉光係冇機會反對，或者講唔同意呢個人做寫手囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則回應，黎智英是《蘋果》創辦人，也是最大股東，其意見當然會被給予最高尊重。辯方指出，至少就陳本人而言，她不會讓黎或其意見影響她的新聞決定，問陳是否同意。惟陳指：「如果係佢（黎）好堅持嘅時候，會影響到（新聞決定）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示陳被捕之後，《蘋果》於2021年6月18日刊出的報導，當中稱：「敏姐說，雖然與黎智英共事多年，不影響新聞判斷，當日頭條重點是資深大律師中資歷最深的李柱銘首次被判罪成。」陳確認，可是文章這一句是談論一宗法庭新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏有時認為黎落指示-視乎不同情況&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：有時認為黎落指示 視乎不同情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問陳是否同意，如果說黎並不是仔細地管理（micro-manage）《蘋果》的編採事務，是一個公道的說法。陳則回答：「我覺得要視乎嗰個係咩事，因為有啲事佢（黎）係唔理嘅」，不過若然有的新聞是黎重視的，例如早前提及的佔領立法會事件，黎會給予指示；但「如果佢冇出聲嘅話，我哋當然可以行使編採自主，唔需要行使佢嘅指示」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則指，黎並不是明言「要這樣做、不要這樣做」，而是提出建議，問陳是否同意。陳指：「唔同情況有唔同嘅」，有的時候她會覺得黎的說話是「指示」。辯方續指，黎與她溝通時態度是有禮貌，往往使用「可否這樣做」或「會否適合」等言辭，甚至曾說「請自行決定」。陳僅指黎有時的確會以上述方式說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示欲向陳展示逾十段相關訊息對話，預料需時不短，希望押後至明天繼續盤問。彭耀鴻又明言，他的盤問不會好像控方那麼長。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（26日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第32日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。2020年8月黎智英首次被捕，之後釋釋，陳稱沒有印象黎曾提及要更改《蘋果》的報導角度。她確認按照黎的意思行事，因為「基本上佢係老闆啦，啫係佢都係比較強勢嘅作風。」被問到陳是否認同黎的政見，陳表示與黎一樣認同民主自由等基本價值，但是未必每一次都會認同黎的做法和路線，例如她不認同以《蘋果》名義發起「一人一信救香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第11天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏確認黎被捕獲釋後稱一切繼續蘋果一定撐落去&quot;&gt;陳沛敏確認黎被捕獲釋後稱「一切繼續」、「《蘋果》一定撐落去」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方上周談及黎智英於2020年8月10日首次被捕，以及壹傳媒大樓被警方搜查。控方展示同年8月13日的《蘋果》報紙頭版，題為〈黎智英羈留室感悟 「坐監都揀呢條路」〉。報導提及黎從警署獲釋後，返回壹傳媒大樓，「獲大批員工在地下大堂英雄式歡迎」，又指：「當被問及對《蘋果日報》將來的看法時，即簡單而有力明言：『一切繼續』，又對讀者承諾：『《蘋果》一定撐落去。』」陳沛敏確認黎有說過相關言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZIDkIxW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，報導引述黎稱：「性格決定咗我嘅命運，咁我接受我嘅命運，等如我接受上帝嘅祝福一樣，我以後唔使驚；係咪要重新考慮？我從來冇諗呢樣嘢，使唔使腳軟呀？我從來冇考慮過！」報導又提及：「黎智英之後再接受專訪，坦言性格較為樂觀，認為被政權以國安法拘捕的一天『遲早會嚟，但冇諗到咁快』，被捕的早上當時在家面對國安部門警察上門仍處之泰然面對，『當時諗法係，嚟就嚟啦，煮到嚟就食啦！』又直言沒有擔心自己會直接『被送中』。」陳沛敏亦確認黎說過上述言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指版面下方有一張相片，顯示黎智英、時任壹傳媒集團行政總裁張劍虹和時任營運總監兼財務總裁周達權在大堂會見一眾員工。控方問陳，黎在該次場合中，有否提及要改變《蘋果》日後的報導方向和角度。陳指：「冇任何嘅改變。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏不記得有否再開飯盒會沒印象黎提及更改報導角度&quot;&gt;陳沛敏不記得有否再開飯盒會、沒印象黎提及更改報導角度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎於2020年12月再度被捕及還柙，問陳於同年8月至12月之間，有否見過黎在壹傳媒大樓出現。陳表示有，但是她不記得有否再召開過「飯盒會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問，黎在這段期間有否透過 WhatsApp 和 Signal 提及要改變報導角度，陳則稱沒有印象黎提及過。至於黎有否在 Slack 的員工群組中提及要改變報導角度，陳則稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏按照黎智英意思行事-因他是老闆作風比較強勢&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：按照黎智英意思行事 因他是老闆、作風比較強勢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，她是否按照黎的意思行事？陳回答是。被問到原因，陳起初表示「因為佢⋯⋯點講呢⋯⋯」，其後稱：「基本上佢係老闆啦，啫係佢都係比較強勢嘅作風。」她打算提及有關美國大選期間的事例，惟該事例是時任社長張劍虹告訴她的，因為法官杜麗冰打斷指這是傳聞證供，因此陳未有詳述該事例。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續提問，陳按照黎的意思行事，除了因為黎「作風強勢」之外，還有否其他原因。陳指沒有其他原因，「啫係因為佢都會好堅持佢嘅做法係啱嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏表示與黎一樣認同民主自由-惟未必每次都認同其方法和路線&quot;&gt;陳沛敏表示與黎一樣認同民主自由 惟未必每次都認同其方法和路線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，當其時陳是否同意黎的政見？陳表示：「如果係好宏觀、好基本嘅價值，例如民主、自由嗰啲，咁我會講我係認同，但如果係話方法呀、路線呀嗰啲，我唔會覺得我係每次都會認同囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方舉例指，陳早前作供提及她不認同以《蘋果》名義發起「一人一信救香港」，惟黎最終沒有接受她的意見。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官質疑831太子站報導乃陳述警方過度用武-而非提出質疑&quot;&gt;法官質疑8.31太子站報導乃「陳述」警方過度用武 而非「提出質疑」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年9月1日的《蘋果》頭版，題為〈港鐵大搜捕 釀元朗恐襲2.0 速龍無差別毆市民〉。控方問陳，此報導以什麼角度來撰寫。陳指：「角度係質疑警方嗰晚有冇過份使用武力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pvvElZU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，陳較早前的證供指黎曾經提及「警暴」，而此頭版的報導角度是否與黎的觀點有關？陳表示「可以話有」。法官李運騰追問有何關係？陳稱：「啫係佢（黎）覺得警暴呢樣嘢係違反公義啦」，而「嗰晚好多段影片影到嗰啲市民喺車廂入面被打得好犀利啦，所以我哋就用咗A1嚟報導呢件事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，陳剛才指報導角度是質疑警方有否過度使用武力，但是該報導似乎在「陳述」警方有過度用武，而非「提出質疑」，問陳此報導做的是哪一種。陳僅回答：「陳述」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就標題所指的「元朗恐襲2.0」，控方指稱「元朗恐襲」是形容2019年7月21日發生在元朗站，白衣人與黑衣人之間的衝突。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英透過給予指示或轉發新聞稿-指示報導反映其觀點&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英透過給予指示或轉發新聞稿 指示報導反映其觀點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2020年7月1日的《蘋果日報》頭版〈惡法生效 兩制蓋棺 泛民7.1繼續抗爭〉，陳指選擇此標題是因為黎都覺得國安法破壞一國兩制和損害法治，而他一直以來都會給予指示，指示他們如何在報導中反映他的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OXayYPE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問黎會如何影響《蘋果》的報導。陳回答指，就一些重大新聞，黎會好明確地指示「做到最大」，他有時亦會透過轉發新聞稿給她，或者好像佔領立法會事件之後，黎吩咐他們報導多些示威者的心聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月7日的《蘋果》頭版，標題為〈爆門搜屋 限制離境 充公財產 秘密竊聽 查國安案警察大晒〉。控方指標題上方有一雙眼睛，問陳為何有如此設計。陳相信負責設計的同事想反映國安法賦予警察很大權力去監視和搜查市民的資料。陳指美術組的同事會先獲告知頭條標題，以及會出席會議，也會有人講解設計意念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第11天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;報導提及黎被捕獲釋後如常經營經營國際線&quot;&gt;報導提及黎被捕獲釋後如常經營「經營國際線」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英於2020年8月首度被捕後，《蘋果》在同月刊登報導〈獲釋後 Twitter 直播 黎智英：手銬不能侮辱我〉，當中提及：「壹傳媒創辦人黎智英被指違反港版國安法被捕後保釋，昨早在 Twitter 如常經營『經營國際線』」，問陳為何會使用「經營國際線」字眼。陳則表示，相信同事按照網上即時新聞的字眼，正如她較早前提及，張志偉都會使用這些字眼，「我諗當時係借用呢個講法嚟講呢樣嘢，因為 Twitter 對象係面向國際社會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DVvDEBD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎「經營國際線」的目的是什麼，陳指是為了「爭取支持」，或者向國際社會發表他的一些觀點。控方追問，黎想達到什麼目的？陳指包括爭取外國就中央或港府的政策施壓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，陳沛敏於2020年8月20日獲委任為蘋果日報有限公司和蘋果日報印刷有限公司的董事。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;特朗普指黎是勇者-黎twitter兩度發文標註特朗普&quot;&gt;特朗普指黎是勇者 黎Twitter兩度發文標註特朗普&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2020年8月20日在 Twitter 發文稱：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Thank you Mr @realDonaldTrump, #HK can’t be successful without freedom and it can’t be the international financial center it once was. It is very sad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，《蘋果》於2020年8月21日刊登報導〈特朗普：黎智英是勇敢的人〉。陳指，時任美國總統特朗普在記者會上發表相關言論，外媒都有報導，《蘋果》的網上即時新聞亦有報導，然後在翌日報紙刊登。她又確認報導提及黎的 Twitter 帖文，引述黎感謝特朗普，又稱香港沒有自由的話不會成功。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎於同日在 Twitter 轉發同一新聞的英文版報導，並發文稱：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“President @realDonaldTrump calls me a brave man. I am flattered. But I am not brave enough to stand against the whole world like #Xi. I only #StandWithHongKong #StandwithTaiwan”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎要求翻譯中國糧食問題新聞-其後在twitter轉載英文版連結&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎要求翻譯中國糧食問題新聞 其後在Twitter轉載英文版連結&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英於2020年8月26日向 WhatsApp 群組「English news」發送兩張圖片，分別為報紙報導〈每年進口糧食一億噸 難自給自足〉和〈中共威權炮製惜食鬧劇 專家：政策半年玩完〉的照片，黎並要求負責英文版的主筆楊清奇將兩則新聞翻譯成英文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英於8月27日在 Twitter 轉發相關英文新聞連結，並稱：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Food import problems reflect that China needs imports to compensate its insufficiency. China cannot afford to decouple its trade with the free world especially US. But can China reconcile its many conflicts with universal values of freedom and democracy?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果報導指稱警方竄改721歷史及隱瞞831真相-陳沛敏指屬於陳述&quot;&gt;蘋果報導指稱警方「竄改7.21歷史」及「隱瞞8.31真相」 陳沛敏指屬於陳述&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年8月29日的《蘋果》報導〈林卓廷錄口供 一時證人一時犯人 憂白衣兇徙遭放生 促警交代角色〉，有關林卓廷因牽涉7.21元朗站事件而被拘捕，版面上方顯示「顛倒黑白」四字。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年9月1日的《蘋果》報導〈PK鄧恐嚇講「打死人」違國安法〉，內文首段便提及：「過去一年，警方一邊竄改7.21歷史，一邊隱瞞8.31真相，更利用國安法封殺人民對8.31的質疑。」控方問陳，這句子是屬於「提出問題」還是一項「陳述」。陳回答是「陳述」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;專欄文章列煽動刊物-陳沛敏表明不認同煽動罪&quot;&gt;專欄文章列「煽動刊物」 陳沛敏表明不認同煽動罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示由陳沛敏撰寫的文章〈這星期給香港人的通識題〉，於2020年9月12日刊登在其個人專欄「堆填生活」，被列為本案的「煽動刊物」之一。文章談論《刑事罪行條例》下的煽動罪。被問到文章是支持還是反對政府，陳表示：「我係對嗰條法例唔認同囉，我亦都對於有啲影片影到警察嘅一啲行徑，我都係唔認同嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指文章有一段指：「政權以言入罪，大興文字獄，無所不用其極。國安法下，『光復香港、時代革命』是罪；幾百萬香港人喊了超過一年的『五大訴求，缺一不可』呢？國安法不適用，就用陳年惡法殺無赦吧。『721唔見人』39分鐘也好18分鐘也罷，好歹是事實陳述，但政權殺快必儆香港人，紅線不斷收龍門不斷搬，反正誰大誰惡誰就可以指鹿為馬。」控方問這段是「提問」還是「陳述」，陳指是「陳述」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英批評國際版對拜登醜聞做得唔夠大-同事感受到壓力&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英批評國際版對拜登醜聞「做得唔夠大」 同事感受到壓力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年10月16日的「Englsih news」群組訊息，張劍虹傳出一系列台灣《蘋果》有關當時美國總統候選人拜登的報導，包括：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-【獨家｜拜登兒子曾訪台「神祕牽線人」曝光 密會金融高層吳敦義女兒代父現身】
-【獨家調查2｜與前立委謝國樑私交不錯 拜登兒子訪台牽線人林俊良起底】

&lt;p&gt;張指：「台蘋今天的精彩獨家報導。」、「我們可盡快翻譯。」時任《蘋果》兩岸版主管蔣美紅回覆：「收到。」控方問陳，憑上述文章的標題，可見台蘋報導的立場是支持還是反對拜登？陳指台蘋立場是反對拜登。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問香港《蘋果》對於拜登的立場又如何？陳則指：「黎生曾經批評過我哋國際版報紙，話我哋太跟《紐約時報》、CNN，啫佢哋對特朗普比較批判啲，而對拜登和拜登屋企人嘅醜聞，做得唔夠大。」不過陳指黎上述看法乃張劍虹向她轉述的，所以陳翻看報導和向國際版同事了解後，得知很多美國小報和社交媒體的確有報導關於拜登的醜聞，但《蘋果》國際版的同事認為該些報導「唔係好 conclusive 嘅報導」。雖然她曾向張劍虹解釋，可是「啫國際版同事都會感受到壓力，啫係處理特朗普和拜登新聞嘅時候，可能嗰比重會因應黎生嘅要求調整返，但我都覺得當時整體上係跟返個新聞原則去做囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英還柙後讀者關注會否繼續營運-故刊登聲明我們不會認命&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英還柙後讀者關注會否繼續營運 故刊登聲明「我們不會認命」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英在2020年12月再度被捕及還柙。同月4日，《蘋果》以〈涉違租契 國安官禁保釋 黎智英成政治囚徙〉作為頭版標題。頭版下方有欄目顯示一則聲明，題為〈《蘋果日報》告讀者書：我們不會認命〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vHk3nm8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏解釋，她認為在黎還柙之後，很多人都關注《蘋果》會否營運下去，所以有需要表態。她不記得聲明是由自己還是同事撰寫，「但都係我嘅意思囉」，她確認當時同意刊登聲明內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏到獄中探訪期間黎沒提及要更改蘋果的報導角度&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：到獄中探訪期間黎沒提及要更改《蘋果》的報導角度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年12月5日的《蘋果》頭版〈黎智英：無畏無懼 繼續戰鬥 子送《蘋果》 懲教退回〉，當中引述黎向員工和讀者傳話「No fear, we have to fight on（無畏無懼，我們要繼續戰鬥）」。控方問陳知不知道這些引述黎的言論是來自哪裡。陳則指「應該係探佢嘅人講返佢嘅說話囉」，但是她本人當時不在場，乃依賴其他探望黎的人轉述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，證據顯示陳曾於2020年12月10日到獄中探訪黎，問她是否記得。陳則表示不記得具體探訪日子，只記得曾經探訪兩至三次。控方追問，黎有否在探訪期間提及要更改《蘋果》的報導角度。陳則指沒有，但她補充：「我記得佢有同同事講『撐住』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;報導引述陳沛敏稱今時今日做蘋果唔係純粹只想做記者係more-than一份工&quot;&gt;報導引述陳沛敏稱：今時今日做《蘋果》，唔係純粹只想做記者，係more than一份工&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2021年6月18日的《蘋果》報導〈夫︰她冷靜堅強鎮定 陳沛敏選擇留在災難現場〉，首段提及：「尚餘兩日，便是《蘋果日報》創刊26年。逾百名國安處警員昨晨再度大舉搜查蘋果大樓，並以涉嫌違反國安法第29條『串謀勾結外國或境外勢力危害國家安全罪』拘捕五名高層，包括《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏。陳沛敏丈夫、前網媒《立場新聞》總編輯鍾沛權形容她被捕後的狀況說：『她冷靜、堅強和鎮定』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上指，同事在她被捕之前數星期曾訪問她，原本打算留待《蘋果》報慶時才刊出報導，可是由於她被捕，所以「佢哋（同事）就將呢個訪問，喺呢個時間出咗，咁當然會交代返我被捕呢件事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到報導引述陳說：「今時今日做《蘋果》，唔係純粹只想做記者，係 more than 一份工。」陳確認這是她當時的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏稱黎獄中沒指示改變報導角度和編採政策&quot;&gt;陳沛敏稱黎獄中沒指示改變報導角度和編採政策&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;報導又指：「探訪時間只有15分鐘，敏姐說黎智英曬黑了，也瘦了，幸好仍站得筆直。『佢話佢個肚腩大咗，我哋望落去又唔係。』她擔心老人難捱牢獄之苦：『佢本身有糖尿底，好似有一次唔知邊個話佢血壓好高，有一排又話牙痛，老人家實有好多呢啲嘢，咁佢睇醫生始終唔係好方便。』」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;報導續指：「被探望者卻說自己很好。『佢係好刻意想啲同事放心，成日都講『同出面同事講OK、繼續、冇問題」。』但演技都有穿煲一刻，有次敏姐與《壹週刊》退休社長楊懷康一起探訪，黎智英隔着膠板眼濕濕說：『幾十年前識你，冇諗過好似𠵱家咁傾偈。』兩位老人相對無言。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HJ9b8oB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏確認曾經與楊懷康一同探望黎，又提及「佢（黎）話覺得香港情況變壞咗好多」，她會將黎的說話轉告時任社長張劍虹和時任總編輯羅偉光等同事。控方追問，黎有否向陳表示要改變《蘋果》的報導角度？陳則指沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，黎還柙之後，她還有否繼續按黎的觀點和想法來行事。陳確認有，因為張劍虹是她的上司，惟張並未有指示她轉變編採方向，所以她便按照一向的指示工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，就《蘋果》的編採政策而言，有否在黎還柙之後出現任何改變？陳記得在《國安法》實施之後，高層曾經討論一些報導字眼需否改變，「張生都有提醒關於制裁嗰啲報導，要謹慎啲」，但是黎還柙之後，「我就印象中（黎）冇講其他嘢囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前表示有信心今日之內可以完成主問，惟臨近下午散庭時間，控方表示還需要多15分鐘，法官杜麗冰遂押後至明日續審。代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻表示，已準備好明天控方完成主問之後開始盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

The Zhu Hai Yun (珠海云), which bristles with advanced monitoring and surveillance equipment, charted a course that appears intended to challenge Taiwan and probe the environment around the island.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese sources insist the ship is meant solely for civilian research. However, satellite imagery and other open-source information show that the lines separating the Zhu Hai Yun and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are exceedingly blurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/m0OBhqT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ On October 30, 2023, the Zhu Hai Yun set off from its home port in southern China toward Dalian in the north.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OFimVc7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ In Dalian, the ship docked at a pier operated by the Dalian Institute of Measurement and Control Technology. One of the institute’s primary roles is studying ship vibration and acoustics for the Chinese navy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/J54DTXG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Instead of transiting back through the Taiwan Strait, the Zhu Hai Yun took a highly unusual route home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wWY32PJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ In the waters off Taiwan’s northern coast, it slowed to a crawl, indicating it likely conducted a research operation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HEgHIpn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ It then sailed east of the island, an uncharacteristic path for a Chinese civilian research ship. Passing along Taiwan’s coast, the Zhu Hai Yun closely hugged (and appeared to briefly cross into) the island’s contiguous zone, just 24 nautical miles from the shore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VBQqWg6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Testing the island’s maritime boundaries while staying within the bounds of international law aligns with Beijing’s increasing use of gray zone tactics to diminish Taiwan’s strategic space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zhu Hai Yun is just one of dozens of &lt;a href=&quot;https://features.csis.org/hiddenreach/china-indian-ocean-research-vessels/&quot;&gt;Chinese research vessels&lt;/a&gt; that scour the world’s oceans collecting data on the marine environment. That data is critical to civilian scientific and commercial research but can also support military intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the capabilities of the Zhu Hai Yun stand out even among the most advanced ships in China’s research fleet. It is designed to serve as a “mothership” for over 50 unmanned air, surface, and undersea vehicles that can be deployed from its deck while underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Zhu Hai Yun as the hub, these smaller platforms can simultaneously survey a three-dimensional area spanning 160 kilometers across, 4,000 meters above, and 1,500 meters below the ocean’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Yunzhou Tech, a major unmanned surface vehicle (USV) manufacturer that helped design the Zhu Hai Yun, such autonomous systems can operate together in an “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yunzhou-tech.com/info/14070.html&quot;&gt;unmanned ship swarm&lt;/a&gt;” (无人船艇集群), acting as a force multiplier for survey operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DWoRC2v.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs):&lt;/strong&gt; The Zhu Hai Yun is reported to carry rotary-wing (helicopter-style) UAVs, which can take off directly from two small helipads on the vessel’s deck. The ship may also operate some fixed-wing drones. UAVs can carry out several tasks including offshore inspection and surveillance patrols, as well as supporting resupply and search and rescue missions. They can be equipped with a wide range of advanced sensors, electronic receivers and transmitters, and other instrumentation used to monitor the maritime and air environment. &lt;strong&gt;Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs):&lt;/strong&gt; The Zhu Hai Yun is known to carry small USVs, such as the L25C manufactured by Yunzhou Tech. These can be equipped with advanced underwater sensing technologies such as side-scan sonar, multibeam echo-sounders, and magnetic anomaly detection devices (among others), which can support undersea target detection. They also carry powerful towing equipment that can be used to transport large equipment or damaged vessels. &lt;strong&gt;Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs):&lt;/strong&gt; UUVs can operate below the surface for extended periods, collecting information on undersea conditions in high-risk environments without detection. These assets can include autonomous undersea gliders, which range freely, and stationary “sonobuoys,” which listen for activity around a target area. Some UUVs can operate together to provide real-time situational awareness and detect undersea threats like mines or submarines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these technologies can support civilian scientific research, they also have dual-use applications. The USVs and undersea gliders carried on board the Zhu Hai Yun are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zhuhai-hitech.gov.cn/cycx/kjdt/content/post_3546265.html&quot;&gt;equipped&lt;/a&gt; with advanced instrumentation such as side-scan sonar, which Chinese naval researchers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/11/4/690&quot;&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; as useful for detecting undersea targets like mines and submarines. Other &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sml-zhuhai.cn/list/39.html&quot;&gt;systems&lt;/a&gt;, like aerial drones, can be used to surveil or monitor target areas from the skies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vessel also offers a platform for China to live test networked drone swarm operations, an emerging focus area for military planners in both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/CASI/documents/Research/Other-Topics/2023-10-09%20Survey%20of%20PRC%20Drone%20Swarm%20Inventions.pdf&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.usni.org/2024/01/30/pentagon-puts-out-call-for-swarming-attack-drones-that-could-blunt-a-taiwan-invasion&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;. These tactics, which involve overwhelming enemy defenses with waves of low-cost unmanned vehicles, have already reshaped modern warfare in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/article/how-drone-war-ukraine-transforming-conflict&quot;&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. They are also likely to play a major role in a potential conflict over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HBr1ED7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China boasts the world’s largest fleet of civilian research vessels. While they serve scientific and commercial purposes, they also further Beijing’s strategic goals. Read the full Hidden Reach &lt;a href=&quot;https://features.csis.org/hiddenreach/china-indian-ocean-research-vessels/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting it further apart, the vessel’s navigation and control systems are reportedly supported by advanced artificial intelligence software, enabling it to operate autonomously for extended periods without human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous navigation for large surface vessels remains a nascent technology, and few ships of the Zhu Hai Yun’s size and range can operate without human guidance. Within the U.S. Navy, the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.austal.com/news/austal-usa-delivers-epf-13-us-navys-largest-surface-vessel-autonomous-capability&quot;&gt;Expeditionary Fast Transport&lt;/a&gt; vessel (EPF 13) is the largest vessel to boast autonomous capabilities. At 103 meters, it is only 14 meters longer than the Zhu Hai Yun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satellite imagery and publicly available evidence reveal close ties between the Zhu Hai Yun and the PLA. Construction on the vessel &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-12/20/c_139604819.htm&quot;&gt;began&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 at the Huangpu Shipyard in Guangzhou, one of China’s most prolific naval shipyards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gLCJpa1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Imagery from July 24, 2022, shows the Zhu Hai Yun moored side by side with a Type 056A corvette, a modern PLA Navy warship designed for anti-submarine warfare. At least four other warships, in addition to two Type 056 corvettes likely transferred from the PLA Navy to the China Coast Guard, can also be seen nearby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZBWvxSF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ More recent imagery from January 2023, taken just days before the vessel was delivered to its owner, shows it docked on its own in the same location. Under construction nearby are two Type 054A guided-missile frigates, with another unidentified hull protruding from the adjacent construction hall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These close physical ties are indicative of the blurred lines between civilian and military shipbuilding in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Records &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cssc.net.cn/n5/n21/c28803/content.html&quot;&gt;indicate&lt;/a&gt; that the Zhu Hai Yun was built by the 704th Research Institute, a subsidiary of the massive state-owned defense contractor China State Shipbuilding Corporation. In 2020, the U.S. Commerce Department &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/22/2020-28031/addition-of-entities-to-the-entity-list-revision-of-entry-on-the-entity-list-and-removal-of-entities&quot;&gt;placed&lt;/a&gt; the 704th Research Institute on its Entity List for illegally acquiring U.S.-origin equipment to support the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zhu Hai Yun’s military connections extend beyond the shipyard. Its primary operator is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sml-zhuhai.cn/list/14.html&quot;&gt;Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai)&lt;/a&gt;, a lab owned by the Zhuhai municipal government and run by Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYSU is closely &lt;a href=&quot;https://unitracker.aspi.org.au/universities/sun-yat-sen-university/&quot;&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to the PLA. In 2015, the U.S. government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/02/18/2015-03321/addition-of-certain-persons-to-the-entity-list-and-removal-of-person-from-the-entity-list-based-on-a&quot;&gt;blacklisted&lt;/a&gt; an entity within SYSU over its role in hosting the National University of Defense Technology’s Tianhe-2 supercomputer, which supports China’s nuclear weapons program. The SYSU Southern Marine Lab openly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sml-zhuhai.cn/list/12.html&quot;&gt;promotes&lt;/a&gt; both the Zhu Hai Yun and the Tianhe-2 supercomputer as key platforms for its work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s own government has hinted at the vessel’s ties with the defense sector. The powerful State Administration of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND) lists &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sastind.gov.cn/n10086200/n10086331/c10458480/content.html&quot;&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; about the Zhu Hai Yun under the “military science and technology” (军工科技) section of its website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6sPLevX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evident linkages between the Zhu Hai Yun and China’s military ecosystem raise questions about its November 2023 voyage around Taiwan. The operation’s true purpose remains unknown, but its unique and carefully calculated route suggests it went beyond a standard research mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s scientific research vessels frequently operate close to Taiwan (including within its claimed exclusive economic zone), most focus on the area southwest of the island near the disputed Pratas (Dongsha) Island. Activities along Taiwan’s eastern coast are historically rare but may be increasing as China gradually ramps up pressure on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data accessed from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://windward.ai/solutions/predictive-risk-insights/&quot;&gt;Windward intelligence platform&lt;/a&gt; reveals that, besides the Zhu Hai Yun, only two other Chinese research vessels since 2015 have operated along Taiwan’s east coast in a manner that was not suggestive of either direct transit or surveying the seabed for deposits of natural resources. Just one of those vessels, operating in 2021, circled Taiwan in a route similar to the Zhu Hai Yun’s but did not venture nearly as close to the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zhu Hai Yun’s close approach to Taiwan’s 24-nautical mile (nm) contiguous zone is significant. In recent years, PLA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3225462/pla-jets-sovereignty-mission-test-taiwanese-boundary-analyst&quot;&gt;planes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.163.com/dy/article/I20AGUFU0552SNEX.html&quot;&gt;warships&lt;/a&gt; have increasingly pushed closer to the island’s contiguous zone to erode Taipei’s claims of sovereignty over its surrounding waters and airspace. During large-scale military exercises around Taiwan in April 2023, several PLA vessels intentionally &lt;a href=&quot;https://chinapower.csis.org/analyzing-chinas-response-to-taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen-transit/&quot;&gt;intruded&lt;/a&gt; into Taiwan’s contiguous zone in a rare and provocative maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s military commanders have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4929611&quot;&gt;made clear&lt;/a&gt; that they will “strike back” against any PLA “entities” that enter Taiwan’s 12 nm territorial waters, but the larger contiguous zone is a murkier gray area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigating along the border of Taiwan’s contiguous zone could also have allowed the Zhu Hai Yun to collect information about the location and activities of Taiwan’s military assets. Several of Taiwan’s major military facilities, including key air bases in Hualien and Taitung, are nestled against the island’s mountainous eastern coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Zhu Hai Yun is just the latest of a set of modern capabilities that Beijing is rapidly testing and fielding that could give China new options for pursuing its military, political, and strategic objectives. While the vessel is not designed to fight with the PLA, it can carry out dual-use missions in key strategic regions of the seas without placing Beijing in hot water. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Javelin anti-tank missile costs almost $200,000 and will destroy one Russian tank. The average battlefield drone – with upgraded sensors and other modifications – costs around $2,000 and is equally effective under most circumstances. Hence, $200,000 would enable the Ukrainians to buy and deploy 100 drone systems and cause a commensurate amount of damage to Russian vehicles. While presenting this disjuncture at an irregular warfare conference in Washington about the growing problems of cost, scale and benefits of weapons systems in December 2023, a Ukrainian Colonel approached one author of this article to express agreement that their military needs to shift towards cheaper and more sustainable approaches to defeating the Russians. The Ukrainian Colonel noted that early in the war, more expensive systems such as the $5 million Turkish TB2 drone were highly effective and useful. However, the Russians have adapted to this system, limiting its impact over the past year. Likewise, the Colonel mentioned that the Ukrainians no longer use Javelins as much because Russian armour tactics have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such developments point to a concerning trend. Since August 2021, our US Department of Defense Minerva team has interviewed hundreds of NATO, US and Ukrainian military personnel and policymakers across Europe and in Western capitals. Recent interviews paint a picture of a war that is shifting to a more dangerous phase as frustration grows between Western leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Security assistance efforts are presently at risk for a set of political reasons we review below. Policymakers, planners and operators we speak to also tell us of a growing mismatch between this assistance and Ukrainian needs – often the product of slow bureaucratic processes, risk aversion and organisational resistance to the valuable lessons of two years of intensified combat against rapidly evolving Russian forces. They tell of a reality – which several of us have seen firsthand – of a battlefield increasingly littered with drones and electronic warfare, requiring a major shift in tactics that no Western military is prepared for. At the heart of the problem is a tendency for Western assistance to reflect the war that Western policymakers and planners would prefer to fight, rather than the war Ukraine’s military is fighting. Our project’s key purpose and the reason for this article is to illuminate this reality and point to a better path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Russo-Ukrainian War drags into a third year, Western capitals have become increasingly concerned about providing open-ended assistance to Ukraine, particularly as initially strong public support for this assistance has waned and aid to Ukraine has become wrapped up in various domestic issues such as debates about border controls in the US and agricultural subsidies in Poland. Leaders in Kyiv are frustrated with Western expectations and constraints on how they are supposed to conduct the defence of their country against Russian aggression. Many Ukrainian soldiers we speak to complain about their Ministry of Defense (MoD) not properly equipping and supplying them on the front. This problem has led to the emergence of informal security assistance; most Ukrainian units rely on volunteers, charities and non-governmental organisations for lethal and non-lethal aid and training. Despite such pessimism, one cannot ignore the fact that over $100 billion in military aid from Western backers has translated into Russia losing over 350,000 troops and over 6,000 main battle tanks during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian forces have skilfully compelled the Russians to extend their supply lines and complicated their logistical operations. This situation makes it more difficult for Moscow to win a war of mass, firepower and attrition. Innovative upgrades to weapons, extended ranges of air and sea drones, and novel tactics have enabled the Ukrainians to seriously degrade Russian combat operations in the Black Sea, along the eastern contact line and all the way down to Crimea. In fact, one commentator has come to the conclusion that Ukraine’s military is at least three times more efficient than Russia’s. Adroit Ukrainian strategic communication has helped establish pro-Ukrainian narratives to counter Russian propaganda. This ability to convey successful Ukrainian military operations has been an important tool in hammering home the importance of Western security assistance in achieving a Ukrainian victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we assess the last year of the war and what lies ahead in Ukraine regarding Western security assistance. We highlight the difficulties, shortcomings and impacts of US “strategic dithering”. We soberly assess Ukraine’s situation and forecast what Ukraine needs in 2024 to fend off a painful Russian offensive. Ukraine’s future requirements centre on five issues: Ukrainian overall resilience; a focused and effective security assistance plan; preparing a robust Ukrainian defence in the face of an unrelenting Russian offense; espionage operations against Russian military-related infrastructure; and scaling up the use of cheaper and smarter autonomous weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2023-a-year-of-strategic-dithering&quot;&gt;2023: A Year of Strategic Dithering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Eliot Cohen has noted, “Western diplomats need to stop whining about Ukraine. Allies can be exasperating. But try being invaded by your neighbour and lectured by everyone else”. Similarly, Phillips P Obrien has identified how the US micromanages the war in Ukraine by reluctantly providing needed weapons systems at a much slower pace relative to the Europeans. For example, the US provided Ukraine with 31 Abrams tanks, but it only sent downgraded variants out of fear that the technology would be captured and exploited by the Russians. However, the UK provided 28 Challenger 2 tanks, and various European militaries and the Canadians sent Ukraine over 100 Leopard 2 tanks with their best kit (sensors, software and so on) to maximise their combat effectiveness for the Ukrainians. The US approach to Ukraine is best described as strategic dithering: doing enough so Ukraine doesn’t lose, but not enough to help it win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External pressure on Kyiv to produce results with the tens of billions received in military aid has pushed it into a paradoxical position of using Western equipment and training against under-equipped and under-trained but well dug-in Russian troops. The tension caused by external expectations and pressure to perform against Russian forces likely put Zelensky in the position of having to dismiss the head of Ukraine’s ground forces, General Zaluzhny, just to appease Western capitals. Additionally, Russia has the benefit of airpower, with significantly more helicopters and attack aircraft. Within months of the summer 2023 counteroffensive, the Ukrainians gave up on Western battle tactics because they lacked sufficient airpower to counter Russian air forces and defences. The critical factor, however, has been the persistent inability to mass forces without detection. This reality – a product of technological innovations and organisational adaptation that was not difficult for our team and certainly not for Ukrainian forces to detect early in the full-scale invasion – doomed the offensive from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is a tendency for Western assistance to reflect the war that Western policymakers and planners would prefer to fight, rather than the war Ukraine’s military is fighting&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even with Ukraine slated to receive some F-16s in early 2024 out of the total of 60 pledged, these US-made fighter jets will not be a “silver bullet”, primarily because it will take Ukrainian pilots hundreds of hours of flight time to become proficient in combat. Much like the downgraded Abrams tanks, the Ukrainians will receive older F-16 variants (last upgraded between 2003 and 2005) which lack advanced avionics, software and sensors, and the most advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles will not be supplied until 2026. Thus, even with the addition of more airpower, the Ukrainians will not be able to field enough F-16 sorties to deter or shoot down Russian Tu-95s that attack Ukrainian cities with hypersonic air-launched ballistic missiles from a considerable standoff distance. If Washington wants improved outcomes, the dithering on properly helping, arming and training leaders in Kyiv should be unshackled from crossing Russia’s imaginary “red lines”. Not providing appropriate aircraft squanders the opportunity to achieve strategic ends after the decision to equip Ukrainians with F-16s sent the political signal to Russia’s leadership that Western leaders were at least willing to test that Russian red line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of Western airpower is only one of the failures of security assistance. Much of the equipment sent to Ukraine lacks crucial components. For example, over 40 US Bradley infantry fighting vehicles arrived on the front with bad batteries and poor wiring. Ukrainians near the front relayed to us that many M777 155mm howitzers arrived without the prerequisite aiming equipment. The lack of adequate maintenance and repair parts compounds the difficulties, with some Ukrainian troops telling us about US-made M-4 rifles breaking down after a week of use in the trenches. Many of these issues could have been avoided if there were sergeants doing a common-sense check of equipment before it was sent across the border into Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two years of the war have involved a scattered and uncoordinated, yet rapid, equipping of the Ukrainian army. The Ukrainians put an abundance of faith in Western equipment and training, delaying the summer offensive until its arrival. Not only was the training not specific to the Ukrainian theatre, but it gave time for the Russians to enhance their “Surovikin Line” of defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-winter-of-change--what-we-see-now&quot;&gt;A Winter of Change – What We See Now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A UK artillery officer who had trained Ukrainians on AS-90 self-propelled artillery told us the Ukrainians are fighting a “cyberpunk war”: First World War-style trench warfare and defence in-depth but with a kill chain dependent upon 21st century technology like drones and Starlink communications. The sort of combined arms manoeuvre being conducted in Ukraine is a potpourri of doctrines and tactics borrowed from Wikipedia, YouTube, social media like Telegram, video games like War Thunder, and US/NATO/Soviet training manuals. Recent footage of the smaller Bradley fighting vehicle defeating a much newer Russian T-90M main battle tank showcased Ukrainian ingenuity, as the victorious Ukrainian gunner said: “But as I played video games, I remembered everything. Both how to hit and where. I could stop him at any cost”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a unified theory on the Ukrainian way of warfighting has the benefit of flexibility and quick adaptation. But without specific Ukrainian tactics, techniques and procedures, the effectiveness of each combat unit becomes dependent on personalities and interpretations of how much mission command (that is, flexibility) to empower subordinates with to execute missions according to their own initiative. The lack of properly trained Ukrainian staff officers hinders the planning and conduct of combat missions. Western professional military education programmes could scale up to train staff officers on the US Military Decision-Making Process or the UK’s 7 Questions combat estimate method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innovation and adaptation in the cyberpunk era of warfare makes the battlefield perilous for high-value weapons systems and more dangerous for the concentration of forces that needs to be massed for effective (counter)offensive operations. For instance, one Ukrainian officer mentioned that “bad weather is a bigger problem for assaulting Russians” but the “lack of ammo is the biggest problem” around Robotyne, where the average brigade can only shoot about 80 mortar and artillery shells daily. Because of Russian electronic warfare capabilities, most Western-donated smart artillery rounds are degraded because of highly proficient Russian electronic warfare jamming abilities. Such Russian jamming also prevents communications between Ukrainian units, reducing command and control abilities and undermining their ability to conduct the sort of combined arms manoeuvre that Western military advisors taught them previously at bases across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise and proliferation of First-Person View (FPV) drones (known as “suicide or kamikaze drones”) with improved sensors has caused both the Ukrainians and Russians to emphasise their use to overwhelm localised positions. The threat of FPV drones is so high that the Ukrainians are “trying to spread the practice of hitting UAV operators”. As relayed to us by one Ukrainian FPV hunter, “FPV drone is cheap, FPV pilot is months of training… we call it ‘killing smart Russians’”. This suggests an alternative approach to attrition, as Ukrainian forces are compelled to target Russian mass less, and smarts more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The ultimate course of the war depends on which side masters a new technology at scale, creating enough mass to break the “will to fight” of the opponent’s forces&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years of war have exhausted front-line Ukrainian troops. More experienced troops like the 47th Mechanized Brigade have fought intense battles without respite. In June 2023, the 47th – one of the “Western-equipped” brigades – fought a terrible battle at Mala Takmatchka, notably losing a number of Bradleys and Leopard tanks. When the Russians began their massive offensive in Avdiivka in mid-October, the 47th were sent to defend against this Russian surge. The Ukrainian MoD sent these soldiers, who were supposed to be recuperating and reconstituting from a summer of combat, to defend against what may become the largest Russian offensive since the beginning of the war. Many of the civil society actors volunteering to help these Ukrainian units on the front are also increasingly exhausted, getting hurt and/or running out of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many in the West mistakenly think that Russia has a stunted, top-down, Soviet-style army. Legacies matter, but so does a capacity to adapt and an eye for innovation. The Russians are doubling down on “meat attacks” akin to Soviet General Zhukov’s human wave doctrine during the Second World War, pressing continuously on large swaths of the front and simultaneously attacking in Adviivka, Kupyansk, Lyman and Bakhmut. For example, Russia is using paratroopers to pressure the Ukrainian special forces’ nascent beachhead across the Dnipro near the village of Krynky. It is likely that Russia senses Ukrainian fatigue and is slowly building pressure until something along the front gives. Russia absorbs troop losses, doubling down on its strategy of attrition. To make matters worse, as the Kremlin pursues an aggressive attempt to mobilise force including a partial reserve mobilisation, crypto-mobilisation, prison recruitment and mercenaries from Africa and the Middle East, Ukraine is hurting for troops. Attempts by Kyiv to increase recruitment have been contentious, but are needed, as one interview indicated that the Ukrainians may have lost over 70% of their combat experienced personnel since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-year-new-battles&quot;&gt;New Year, New Battles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A renewed Ukrainian offensive campaign in 2024 is unlikely. Ukraine must first recruit and train enough fighters, and the MoD would need to properly equip and arm them for successful defensive operations, including enough 4x4 vehicles for Ukrainian forces to get around on the front. Many Ukrainians tell us that MoD-supplied 4x4 vehicles never arrive, leading to reliance on vehicle donations from volunteer groups like NAFO. Western armaments would need to increase alongside Western training that accommodates the Ukrainified way of war and rapidly shifting Russian battlefield tactics. Currently, Russia is firing five times more artillery shells per month than Ukraine, and is firing massive missile barrages against Ukrainian factories producing ammo, shells, gunpowder and drones. However, it is not a given that the Kremlin will continue to send thousands of Russians (and mercenaries) to their deaths in meaningless frontal assaults. Even if these “meat attacks” continue, exhausting as they are in this battle of attrition, the more professional elements of the Russian military are not committed to fighting this war with reckless abandon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s success in 2024 and beyond rests on overall resilience, a streamlined Western security assistance plan, and the development of defensive positions capable of withstanding Russian meat attacks and increasingly innovative hourly drone attacks. The following are some practical ways to help reach these goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The infrastructure and institutions that are susceptible to continued kinetic and non-kinetic Russian attacks need to be identified and made more resilient to attacks to ensure that people and processes can weather continued Russian bombings, cyber attacks and information warfare. Without such resilience, Ukrainian citizens and leaders may lose the will to resist, and Western backers may reconsider economic and military assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The outdated Western way of training the Ukrainians in combined arms manoeuvre and the provision of stale Cold War-era weapons systems need to be modified considerably. The 51-member coalition supporting Ukraine should want more bang for its buck – as do the Ukrainians. This means Western trainers and advisors should constantly update and modernise programmes of instruction for the battlefield that Ukrainian soldiers face. The West should provide more professional military education to Ukrainian officers and senior enlisted personnel to help them out-think and out-fight the Russians. Current Western efforts to educate Ukrainian forces are too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s forces need to invest in a resilient defensive posture, and would benefit from Western help to do so. This means barricades, trenches, minefields and counter-drone capabilities to resist Russian assaults while Ukraine regenerates a more capable and rested military.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine should continue espionage operations that punish Russian critical infrastructure such as the Trans-Siberian Railway and energy infrastructure to undermine Russian military-industrial production. Indirect Western support for these operations will involve challenges in escalation management, but they should offer opportunities to disturb the equilibrium of Russia’s frontal approach in a manner that minimises Ukrainian casualties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate course of the war depends on which side masters a new technology at scale, creating enough mass to break the “will to fight” of the opponent’s forces. To break the stalemate in favour of Ukraine would require a cheap and innovative way of clearing hundreds of meters of Russian minefields, and simpler and less risky ways of clearing Russian trenches and layers of defensive positions. Given our numerous discussions with those involved in the fight, doing this effectively requires producing and fielding at least 10,000 autonomous air, land, and sea drones per week with the requisite sensors, AI and firepower to punch through Russian lines and break morale. Such AI would effectively allow drones to be unjammable as they would autonomously decide who and what to target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may find the suggestion of helping the Ukrainians field cheap autonomous drones to be unethical. Critics should be reminded that if Russia masters the employment of thousands of cheap “slaughterbot” drones that use AI for targeting on the battlefield, as it is now attempting to do, the Ukrainians will pay the high price of losing the war and ivory-tower moral hubris in Western capitals and universities will be complicit in this strategic failure. Either way, this war is letting the “cat out of the bag” when it comes to battlefield innovations and the rise of “smart weapons”. The West must stop dithering and commit to helping Ukraine to ensure that Russia doesn’t master cyberpunk warfare first.&lt;/p&gt;

To explore these issues, the CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues recently compiled a database and released a digital report Russian nuclear narratives and their evolution during the first 18 months of the war. This brief builds on that work and finds that Russian officials noticeably calibrated their nuclear signaling at key points in the war. It also concludes that the risks of nuclear use will likely rise if Russia faces significant battlefield setbacks in the future or the conflict expands in new or unexpected ways. Accordingly, Washington should work to maintain international pressure against nuclear use in Ukraine while combatting narratives that downplay or rationalize Russia’s nuclear threats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A nuclear shadow has loomed over the war in Ukraine since Russia invaded on February 24, 2022. Following a large-scale nuclear exercise, Putin announced a “special military operation” as Russian troops crossed the border and threatened, “No matter who tries to stand in our way or all the more so create threats for our country and our people, they must know that Russia will respond immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s nuclear signaling — its deliberate efforts to influence foreign decisionmaking through the implicit or explicit threat of nuclear use — is part of its wider strategy to deter direct Western intervention and support for Ukraine. Moscow has used explicit threats, including mention of crossing a “red line” in September 2022 if the United States supplied longer-range missiles to Ukraine, as well as implicit threats such as frequent reference to Russia’s nuclear doctrine. Russia has also used disinformation campaigns, exercises, and new nuclear force deployments to Belarus to manipulate risks and attempt to weaken Western support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s nuclear rhetoric and posturing have made the risk of nuclear weapons use the highest it has been for decades and revived calls for new risk reduction efforts. Amidst these rising nuclear risks, however, Russia is working to weaken the institutions and norms designed to manage those very risks. Since the February 2022 invasion, Russia has blocked consensus on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, suspended the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START0, and withdrawn its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The success or failure of Russia’s nuclear signaling in Ukraine will have wider strategic implications. In a December 2023 speech, U.S. secretary of defense Austin stated, “If we do not stand up to the Kremlin’s aggression today, if we do not deter other would-be aggressors, we will only invite more aggression, more bloodshed and more chaos.” Indeed, other countries are likely watching and learning from how Russia is brandishing its nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, Russia’s nuclear signaling may have successfully deterred the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) states from directly engaging in the war, particularly in the early stages. On the other hand, NATO may have never been willing to put “boots on the ground” in Ukraine — meaning the United States and NATO were never deterred from doing something they never intended to do. A more nuanced understanding of how Russia’s nuclear signaling has evolved since the February 2022 invasion, along with the impact of messaging from NATO and external actors — particularly China and India — can shed light on Russia’s reliance on nuclear weapons and the role of nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war and beyond. Russia’s nuclear signaling, including rhetoric and actions, has evolved since the beginning of the war and is not static. Instead, officials in Moscow noticeably calibrated their nuclear messaging, ramping up their threats in the face of setbacks on the battlefield while at times showing a receptiveness to external pressures. With the war far from over, Washington, Kyiv, and NATO should expect to see continued calibration in the coming months and years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia’s nuclear rhetoric and posturing have made the risk of nuclear weapons use the highest it has been for decades and revived calls for new risk reduction efforts. Amidst these rising nuclear risks, however, Russia is working to weaken the institutions and norms designed to manage those very risks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief assesses the impact of Russian nuclear signaling on the war in Ukraine, the effectiveness of Western de-escalation efforts, and whether or not Putin would consider using nuclear weapons in the future. It draws on a wider CSIS study of nearly 450 public statements, policy announcements, and military developments in the first 18 months of the war. The brief first provides background of the nuclear shadow leading up to the war in Ukraine, with a summary of Russian nuclear capabilities and doctrine. It then summarizes Russian nuclear activities across three phases of the conflict: February–July 2022, August–October 2022, and November 2022–July 2023, although arguably, Russian nuclear signaling began even before the invasion, such as with the nuclear exercise in February 2022. The brief concludes with findings and recommendations for Western policymakers on how to respond to Russian nuclear bullying and de-escalate crises with the potential for nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief’s overarching finding is that leaders in Moscow escalated their nuclear signaling when facing battlefield setbacks, a trend that will almost certainly continue. Russia has relied on a range of signals and implicit and explicit nuclear threats in an attempt to deter NATO intervention in Ukraine and divide the alliance. As the intelligence community assessed in its 2023 annual threat assessment, “Moscow’s military forces have suffered losses during the Ukraine conflict that will require years of rebuilding.” As a result, U.S. intelligence sources conclude, “Moscow will become even more reliant on nuclear, cyber, and space capabilities as it deals with the extensive damage to Russia’s ground forces.” Navigating these challenges will require policymakers to assess and manage the enduring nuclear shadow looming over the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-nuclear-forces-and-doctrine&quot;&gt;Russian Nuclear Forces and Doctrine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear weapons play a fundamental role in Russia’s deterrence strategy. The declaratory policy governing their use has gone through four iterations since the end of the Cold War. The Kremlin implemented the first changes to its nuclear policy in the 1993 military doctrine, which eliminated mention of the “no first use” policy that Russia inherited from the Soviet Union. This omission suggested that Russia could use nuclear weapons to counter significant conventional aggression, and it likely reflected the Kremlin’s concerns about Russia’s diminished conventional military power and U.S. precision strike capabilities demonstrated during the Gulf War. Russia’s 2000 military doctrine — released less than a year after NATO’s intervention in Kosovo — stated that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to nuclear attacks, attacks using other weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and certain types of conventional attacks on its territory. Building on this policy, the 2010 military doctrine stated that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to an attack against Russia or its allies using WMDs, or in response to a large-scale conventional attack against Russia that threatens “the very existence of the state.” This language went unchanged in Russia’s 2014 military doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Kremlin published its first declassified nuclear doctrine (as opposed to military doctrine), which made explicit two additional factors that could provoke a Russian nuclear response. This document lists four scenarios for nuclear employment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Receipt of reliable data about the launch of ballistic missiles against Russia or its allies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) against Russia or its allies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attacks against Russian nuclear command, control, and communications infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aggression against Russia with conventional weapons that threatens “the very existence” of the Russian state&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous questions remain about the specifics of Russia’s nuclear doctrine. Of particular importance is the question of whether Putin draws a distinction between the Russian state and his own regime. Given the risks that Putin has taken in his efforts to gain political control over Ukraine, it is possible that he believes defeat would pose a threat to the “very existence” of his rule. Independent of its declaratory policy, experts assess that the Kremlin could use nuclear weapons in a regional conflict to control escalation and signal resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of summer 2023, Russia had an estimated stockpile of approximately 4,489 active nuclear warheads for use on strategic and theater-range delivery systems — 1,197 on intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), 896 on submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), 580 on bombers, and 1,816 on a wide range of nonstrategic systems. Only 1,674 warheads, however, are currently deployed. “Deployed” warheads are mated to delivery systems and ready for immediate use. “Reserve” warheads are kept in storage, often partially disassembled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current composition of Russia’s strategic nuclear force reflects an ongoing, decades-long modernization program that has gradually replaced Russia’s Soviet-era arsenal with more modern weapons. This program has impacted each leg of the nuclear triad differently. Since the 2000s, Russia’s Strategic Rocket Forces have slowly replaced the ageing SS-18, SS-19, and SS-25 ICBMs with the more modern SS-27 mod 1 and SS-27 mod 2 (both of which have silo-based and road mobile variants), as well as the SS-29 ICBM and the Avangard boost-glide vehicle. The Russian navy began replacing its Delta IV ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) with new Borei Class boats in 2013, and it introduced the SS-N-32 SLBM in the same year. The Russian air force deployed a new model of nuclear-capable air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) in 2012, and it is in the process of extensively modernizing its fleet of Tu-160 strategic bombers. Several additional delivery systems are currently under development, including a stealth bomber, a nuclear-powered cruise missile, and an intercontinental torpedo. According to Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu, modern weaponry now comprises 95 percent of Russia’s nuclear triad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Given the risks that Putin has taken in his efforts to gain political control over Ukraine, it is possible that he believes defeat would pose a threat to the “very existence” of his rule.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-long-shadow&quot;&gt;The Long Shadow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine followed several unsuccessful efforts to exert political control over the country. The current conflict traces its origins to the winter of 2013–2014. In late 2013, Putin pressured pro-Russia Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych to abandon the path to partnership with the European Union in favor of a deal with the Kremlin for $15 billion in aid and cheaper energy prices. Protests against Yanukovych’s decision forced him to flee the country in February 2014. Putin responded by illegally seizing Crimea (home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet) and providing military support to separatists in Donbas. Between 2015 and 2022, the frontlines in Donbas were largely static, but Ukraine’s ties to the West grew stronger, as did the Ukrainian military. The Kremlin became increasingly strident in its opposition to Ukraine’s ties to NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the leadup to the second invasion in February 2022, Russia made several demands of the United States and NATO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cease NATO expansion&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Seek Russian permission for NATO exercises in Eastern Europe&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Withdraw NATO forces from former Warsaw Pact state&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov warned in December 2021, “We will not allow anyone to drag out our initiatives in endless discussions. If a constructive response does not follow within a reasonable time and the West continues its aggressive course, Russia will be forced to take every necessary action to ensure a strategic balance and to eliminate unacceptable threats to our security.” Western responses emphasized the need for diplomacy, while also emphasizing the enduring principle of sovereignty and Ukraine’s right “to choose their own security arrangements and alliances,” as stressed by U.S. secretary of state Anthony Blinken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-nuclear-calibration-february-2022july-2023&quot;&gt;Russian Nuclear Calibration February 2022–July 2023&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phase-1-the-invasion-and-deterrence-februaryjuly-2022&quot;&gt;Phase 1: The Invasion and Deterrence, February–July 2022&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 24, 2022, following months of military buildup and in the wake of a large out of cycle nuclear exercise, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The invasion was intended to topple the Western-aligned government of Volodymyr Zelensky within 72 hours. As Russian troops crossed the Ukrainian border, Vladimir Putin issued the first of many implicit threats against direct NATO intervention in the conflict: “I would now like to say something very important for those who may be tempted to interfere in these developments from the outside. No matter who tries to stand in our way or all the more so create threats for our country and our people, they must know that Russia will respond immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 27, Belarusian resident Aleksandr Lukashenko held a referendum to approve a new Belarusian constitution that eliminated Belarus’ non-nuclear status, thereby opening the door for Russian nuclear weapons to be stationed in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the same day, Putin placed Russia’s nuclear forces on “high combat alert.” Specifically, Putin stated, “You see that Western countries are not only taking unfriendly economic actions against our country . . . but top officials of the leading NATO countries are indulging in aggressive statements directed at our country. Therefore, I order the Defence Minister and Chief of the General Staff to put the Russian Army’s deterrence forces on high combat alert.” Putin claimed that this decision was a response to the “illegitimate sanctions” and “aggressive statements” from the senior officials of NATO member states. It is unclear exactly which statements Putin was referring to. He may have been referencing a statement by Liz Truss, the United Kingdom’s foreign secretary at the time, on February 27 about the need to defeat Russia in Ukraine, or a statement by French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on February 24 about NATO’s nuclear status. On February 28, 2022, the Russian defence minister Shoigu, stated that in accordance with Putin’s order the Ministry of Defence had increased manning levels at command posts of Russia’s strategic nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s announcement of this special alert status drew immediate condemnation from White House and NATO officials as “provocative,” “dangerous,” and “add[ing] to the risk of miscalculation.” In response to a question posed a day later about whether U.S. citizens should be concerned about a nuclear war breaking out, President Biden responded with a resounding “no.” The military significance of this shift was unclear. U.S. officials stated that they did not fully understand the meaning of the announcement and observed no “muscle movements” in Russia’s nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials also took steps to de-escalate the situation. Days after Putin ordered Russia’s nuclear forces to go on “high combat alert,” on March 2, 2022, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby announced that “in an effort to demonstrate that we have no intention of engaging in any actions that can be misunderstood or misconstrued, the secretary of defense has directed that our Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile test launch scheduled for this week to be postponed.” A month later, the U.S. Air Force canceled the postponed test. While this kind of public posturing may have appealed to some Western audiences and U.S. allies, Russia largely ignored the move and instead continued with its own tests and exercises, including an April 20 test of Russia’s new Sarmat ICBM that Putin himself announced. Ultimately, Washington resumed testing and highlighted the routine nature of such tests in its messaging. In June, the U.S. Navy tested four unarmed Trident II (D5LE) missiles, and the U.S. Air Force later conducted its ICBM test launch in August 2022 and then again in September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the ground, Russian forces quickly became bogged down, withdrew from around Kyiv in late March, and began a grinding offensive in Donbas. Throughout the spring and summer and into the fall of 2022, Russia also generated international concerns about a nuclear incident by occupying, hazardously managing, shelling, and allegedly sabotaging the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first phase of the war, Russia used a combination of threats and signals, including through exercises, tests, and nuclear modernization updates, to warn NATO against intervening directly in Ukraine. This focus likely reflected the Kremlin’s initial expectation that, barring NATO intervention, Russia could swiftly occupy Ukraine. Russian officials made repeated references to Russia’s nuclear doctrine, both to deny that Russia would use nuclear weapons and to create ambiguity about the exact conditions that might prompt nuclear use. For example, Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on March 28, 2022:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have a security concept that very clearly states that only when there is a threat for existence of the state in our country, we can use and we will actually use nuclear weapons . . . But, at the same time, if you remember the statement of the president when he ordered the operation on the 24th of February, there was a part of his statement warning different states not to interfere in the affairs between Ukraine and Russia during this operation . . . I think that everyone understands what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the Kremlin was clear that direct NATO intervention would be likely to prompt a nuclear response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to these signals, Western leaders sought to balance efforts to punish Russia and support Ukraine with the need to avoid escalation during the initial phase of the war. To do so, the West adopted an incremental approach, wherein Western states gradually increased the amount and sophistication of aid for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first phase of the war, Russia used a combination of threats and signals, including through exercises, tests, and nuclear modernization updates, to warn NATO against intervening directly in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phase-2-counter-offensive-and-heightened-risk-of-nuclear-use-augustoctober-2022&quot;&gt;Phase 2: Counter-Offensive and Heightened Risk of Nuclear Use, August–October 2022&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a shift in narrative, Russian officials launched a diplomatic offensive in August to coincide with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference. Russian leaders, including Putin, repeatedly stated, “There can be no winners in a nuclear war and it should never be unleashed.” During the NPT meeting, the Russian diplomat stated, “We would like to firmly reject absolutely ungrounded and unacceptable allegations of Russia allegedly threatening to use nuclear weapons.” And Shoigu said, “From a military point of view, there is no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine to achieve the set goals.” Kremlin officials quickly abandoned this narrative following the failure of the NPT meeting, where Russia alone blocked consensus among 191 states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin resumed its menacing rhetoric in September. Ukrainian forces went on the offensive in Kherson and Kharkiv oblasts in August and September 2022, respectively. Ukraine had success on both fronts, and Russian rhetoric escalated as Ukrainian forces advanced. Foreign ministry officials began to warn of the nuclear risks created by Western aid for Ukraine. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov, for example, cautioned, “The more the United States is involved in supporting the Kiev regime on the battlefield, the more they become a party to a military confrontation with Russia, which means they risk provoking a direct armed clash between the largest nuclear powers, fraught with catastrophic consequences.” Russian officials also signaled that Russia could use nuclear weapons to defend illegally annexed territory in Ukraine. Lavrov, for example, declared in late September that “the entire territory of the Russian Federation, which is enshrined and could be further enshrined in the constitution of the Russian Federation, unquestionably is under the full protection of the state . . . all of the laws, doctrines, concepts, and strategies of the Russian Federation apply to all of its territory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia’s battlefield situation further deteriorated in October, the Russian narrative took a dramatic shift on October 23, 2022, and focused on the alleged threat of a Ukrainian dirty bomb. Shoigu and chief of the Russian general staff Gerasimov called their counterparts in the United States and United Kingdom to discuss the alleged threat of a dirty bomb, while Putin, Lavrov, and Peskov echoed this narrative in addresses and comments. Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations wrote a letter to the UN secretary general to the same effect, and the Russian Ministry of Defence also announced preparations to operate in a radioactive environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were fears that this narrative may have been intended to either provide pretext for nuclear use or to cover for a false flag operation. Western leaders challenged Russia’s narrative and warned publicly of severe consequences for nuclear use while privately threatening to retaliate with conventional weapons. The NATO secretary general attempted to dismiss these claims on October 24, stating, “The allegation that Ukraine is preparing to use dirty bombs in Ukraine is absurd . . . This is part of a pattern we have seen before from Russia — in Syria, but also at the start of the war, or just before the war started in February. And that is that Russia is accusing others [of] doing what they intend to do themselves.” Non-Western leaders also weighed in. During a call with Shoigu on October 26, Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh warned his Russian counterpart against nuclear use and cautioned that nuclear use “goes against the basic tenets of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian warnings about a Ukrainian dirty bomb coincided with large-scale Russian nuclear exercises and followed warnings that attacks on the illegally annexed territories could prompt nuclear use. False Russian claims that Ukraine and its Western partners might stage a “provocation” using a nuclear or radiological device were not new; the dirty bomb or Ukrainian nuclear weapon narrative dates back to the beginning of the invasion. What was different this time were claims that the threat was imminent, along with the seeming coordination in messaging and the sheer number of statements to this effect. Kremlin officials issued these warnings as the Russian army appeared near to collapse, generating concern in the West and internationally that Russia might use tactical nuclear weapons to avert a rout. A November New York Times article reported that Russian military leaders discussed the conditions for nuclear employment in October, although these conversations did not involve President Putin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian warnings of an imminent dirty bomb attack ended shortly after Singh’s call to Shoigu on October 26. In an address on October 26, Putin reiterated claims that Ukraine was preparing to use a dirty bomb while simultaneously asserting that Russia had “no need” to use nuclear weapons. Dmitry Polyansky, Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, reiterated the Kremlin’s claims about a dirty bomb the next day, after which the Kremlin’s warnings abruptly ended. In a seeming effort to reduce tensions, the Russian Foreign Ministry released a statement on November 2 reaffirming that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought, while Russian officials, including Peskov, made similar comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the phases of the war, the risk of nuclear use appears to have been highest during this period of significant Russian battlefield losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;phase-3-digging-in-and-nuclear-calibration-november-2022july-2023&quot;&gt;Phase 3: Digging-In and Nuclear Calibration, November 2022–July 2023&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2022, Russian forces began an offensive across the frontline in Eastern Ukraine. This push, paired with an ongoing strike campaign against Ukrainian energy infrastructure, made limited gains at enormous cost throughout the winter and spring. After a period of de-escalatory signaling in November, Russian officials resumed their nuclear rhetoric (including suspending participation in New START) and actions (such as deploying nuclear weapons to Belarus). Russian officials also threatened against the West’s supply of depleted uranium ammunition and F-16s to Ukraine, Ukrainian strikes against Crimea and the Russian homeland, efforts to retake Crimea, and the possibility of Russian defeat. To the alarm of the West, Putin announced on February 21, 2023, that he would suspend Russia’s participation in New START. Putin framed the decision as a response to U.S. support for Ukraine and other, unspecified, hostile actions: “Now, they are using NATO to give us signals . . . whereby Russia should, no questions asked, implement everything that it agreed to, including the New START Treaty, whereas they will do as they please. As if there is no connection between strategic offensive weapons and, say, the conflict in Ukraine or other hostile Western actions against our country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Of all the phases of the war, the risk of nuclear use appears to have been highest during this period of significant Russian battlefield losses.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear landscape shifted again on March 25, 2023, when Putin announced that Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. In his justification for the move, Putin pointed to NATO’s nuclear mission: “We are not handing over [the weapons]. And the U.S. does not hand [them] over to its allies. We’re basically doing the same thing they’ve been doing for a decade. They have allies in certain countries and they train . . . their crews. We are going to do the same thing.” Moscow and Minsk had already laid the groundwork for the deployment. Lukashenko modified the Belarusian constitution to eliminate its non-nuclear status in February 2022, and Putin agreed in June 2022 to provide Belarus with dual-capable delivery systems. Putin’s March announcement drew a critical but restrained response from the West. In his justification for the deployment of nuclear weapons to Belarus, Putin pointed to NATO’s ongoing nuclear mission as precedent and justification. This increased diplomatic pressure on the United States and NATO allies to justify nuclear sharing agreements, while deflecting international pressure on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By July 2023, Russia’s nuclear rhetoric had proven to be evolutionary, whereby it changed with developments on the ground in the war in Ukraine, along with Western and international pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;findings-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Findings and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, when the Kremlin believed that it could seize Kyiv in a matter of days, Russian officials used the threat of nuclear use in an attempt to deter direct NATO intervention in the war. As it became clear that the war would drag on, the Kremlin attempted to use nuclear signaling to deter a wider range of activities. Although Russian officials maintained a steady drumbeat of menacing nuclear rhetoric from late 2022 through mid-2023, the urgency and intensity of this signaling paled in comparison to that of September and October 2022. Russian officials downplayed the risks of nuclear use in November and offered muted reactions as Ukraine launched strikes deep into Russia, and NATO supplied new types of military aid. Western officials took Russian warnings seriously, but they increasingly cited a decreased risk of nuclear use. In the absence of more aggressive nuclear threats, Russia soon began manipulating risk by other means. The Kremlin suspended participation in the final strategic arms control treaty between Russia and the United States and announced plans to station nuclear weapons in Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Kremlin’s narrative was not static, it also was not inconsistent. Russia’s nuclear messaging has consistently pointed to Russia’s nuclear arsenal as the ultimate security guarantor, and it has used nuclear signals — whether explicit rhetoric and messaging or posturing — as part of a wider strategy. This nuclear calibration is an important trait of Russia’s war in Ukraine and will likely continue to shape its actions going forward. There are a variety of factors that may have contributed to these shifts and calibrations in Russia’s nuclear rhetoric: Western signaling, intervention by India and China, events on the ground and Russia’s failure to deliver a quick, decisive victory, and, of course, the fighting of the Ukrainians themselves. This brief does not attempt to assess which of these, if any, was the decisive driver, but it acknowledges that they likely all contributed to — and will continue to shape — shifts and calibrations in Russia’s nuclear signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study set out to answer three primary questions. First, to what ends has Russia used nuclear signaling, and what impact has it had? Russian nuclear signaling appears to have been intended to deter three developments: 1) direct NATO intervention in Ukraine, 2) Western aid for Ukraine, and 3) attacks on Crimea and Russia. It is possible that Russian nuclear signals deterred NATO intervention and slowed military aid. But these messages have not deterred incremental military aid for Ukraine nor have they enabled Russia to achieve its goals in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Although Russian officials maintained a steady drumbeat of menacing nuclear rhetoric from late 2022 through mid-2023, the urgency and intensity of this signaling paled in comparison to that of September and October 2022.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, have Western efforts to prevent nuclear use been effective? Western deterrence signaling appears to have played a role in the de-escalation of Russian rhetoric. This is particularly true following a period of alarming signaling in October 2022. Western officials repeatedly warned of severe consequences if Russia used nuclear weapons but largely stopped short of specifying publicly what a response might entail. While the United States, United Kingdom, and France reportedly warned the Kremlin that they would respond to nuclear use with conventional weapons, most messaging from President Biden and senior U.S. officials was ambiguous and highlighted the certainty of a response, not the nature of it. For example, in September 2022, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan stated, “We have communicated directly, privately, at very high levels to the Kremlin, that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the United States in our allies will respond decisively.” External actors, namely India and China, also seem to have played a role. An improved understanding of what deterred Russia from nuclear escalation during the war in Ukraine may point to ways for the United States and NATO to continue to strengthen deterrence — including through financial and military aid to Ukraine and through bolstering NATO’s conventional and nuclear force postures — without being overly concerned about escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third and finally, would Putin consider using nuclear weapons if Russia were facing defeat in Ukraine? Based on the connection between Russian nuclear rhetoric and events on the ground, along with open-source reporting, it appears that Putin likely would consider nuclear use in Ukraine. Russia relies on nuclear weapons to manipulate risk over the war in Ukraine. Nuclear rhetoric is tied to developments on the battlefield and appears intended to deter Western intervention and support for Ukraine. The Kremlin’s nuclear signaling was most intense when Russian forces faced collapse in the fall of 2022. There is reason to believe that Russian nuclear signaling would intensify, and the risks of nuclear escalation might rise, if Russia faces a similar battlefield situation in the future, or if the conflict expands in new or unexpected ways, such as sustained Ukrainian strikes on Russian critical infrastructure. These signals could include nuclear exercises or military testing that could risk misperceptions and lead to unintended escalation. Russian nuclear rhetoric, however, is seemingly responsive to international pressure, as it became more conciliatory in November 2022 after clear international warnings against nuclear use in September and October. The Kremlin also cares about its international image: officials deny that Russia has threatened to use nuclear weapons at international fora and strike a comparatively reassuring tone when discussing nuclear risks with non-Western media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia calibrates its nuclear signaling and reliance on nuclear weapons, an important question is what lessons Russia has learned from the first two years of the war. Arguably, Russian signaling has had limited success in achieving its goals in Ukraine, as U.S. and NATO support for Ukraine has incrementally increased since the war began. But Russian nuclear threats should nonetheless be taken seriously, since Russia could consider nuclear use if its forces face collapse or the nature of the conflict changes significantly in the future. The Western response to Russia’s messaging has delicately balanced support for Ukraine with the need to avoid escalation and nuclear use. Patterns and trends in Russian and Western nuclear signaling since the start of the war point to opportunities for the United States and NATO to continue to strike this balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is reason to believe that Russian nuclear signaling would intensify, and the risks of nuclear escalation might rise, if Russia faces a similar battlefield situation in the future, or if the conflict expands in new or unexpected ways, such as sustained Ukrainian strikes on Russian critical infrastructure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies should consider the following recommendations to minimize the risks of nuclear use as the war continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better understand the impacts of international pressure on Russian decisionmaking.&lt;/strong&gt; It is unclear exactly what impact U.S., NATO, Indian, and Chinese messaging had on Putin’s thinking about nuclear use. The U. S. government should prioritize efforts to develop a better understanding of who, if anyone, influenced thinking in the Kremlin about the utility of nuclear weapons. Doing so would help the United States and NATO to better calibrate their own deterrence signals and messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue to signal certainty of retaliation while preserving ambiguity as to the nature of the response.&lt;/strong&gt; Western leaders have consistently emphasized that Russian nuclear use will be met with severe consequences. However, they have not specified the exact nature of the response. Maintaining the credibility of this signal will require continued consultation and coordination among NATO allies on messaging, including the nuclear sharing mission.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinate with India and China to maximize international pressure against nuclear use.&lt;/strong&gt; U.S. leaders should seek to ensure that India and China continue to make clear that nuclear use would be met with severe consequences for Moscow. This could be done through bilateral channels or through a multilateral risk reduction dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combat Russian narratives that downplay or rationalize the Kremlin’s nuclear threats.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States and its allies have used public messaging and intelligence disclosures to counter Russian disinformation since the outset of the invasion. The U.S. government should build on these efforts. It should also ensure that the international community (beyond the West) fully understands the dangers posed by the Kremlin’s irresponsible rhetoric and behavior. Doing so could help to deprive Russia of the tacit political support that it currently enjoys from many developing states and could help to decrease the risks of nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remain prepared for potential use scenarios.&lt;/strong&gt; While fears of Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine have subsided considerably, Russia’s increased reliance on its nuclear weapons could still pose a threat to Ukrainian and Western forces if the nature of the conflict changes. Western leaders need to remain prepared to deal with possible use scenarios, and they must take steps to continue to enhance preparedness. This includes prioritizing efforts to strengthen chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) defenses and making good on the commitments made during the Vilnius summit to “strengthen training and exercises that . . . facilitate greater coherence between conventional and nuclear components of NATO’s deterrence and defence posture across all domains and the entire spectrum of conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these efforts are already underway, but they will face challenges over time. Maintaining NATO unity and staying ahead of Russian disinformation will be two of the greatest hurdles for confronting Russian aggression and controlling the risks of nuclear escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian nuclear weapons have been a constant shadow over the war in Ukraine. Russia has relied on them to deter Western intervention and support for Ukraine. Russia has also attempted to manipulate nuclear risk when it faces battlefield setbacks. These trends are unlikely to change anytime soon. In fact, Russia will likely rely increasingly on nuclear threats to offset its conventional losses and to advance its broader strategic objectives. Navigating these signals and managing escalation will be a continued priority for Western leaders as they continue to confront Russian aggression in the coming months and years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，WhatsApp 群組「國安法應變委員會」於2020年7月1日設立，訊息紀錄顯示陳沛敏曾提出轉移至另一通訊軟件 Signal 討論。陳解釋有兩個原因，在該段時期有人提出質疑 WhatsApp 的功能不足以保障通訊私隱，因此有很多人轉用其他通訊軟件，包括 Signal 或 Telegram；另外，Signal 有一項功能，用戶可以設定訊息在某個時間消失。由於當時「國安法應變委員會」群組主要討論《國安法》，而「傳媒機構當時話唔知紅線係點樣劃」，所以簡單的方法是設定訊息消失功能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示群組截圖，顯示「羅偉光已將訊息銷毀時間設為6小時」，下方則是「盧峯已將訊息銷毀時間設為1小時」。法官李運騰問，是否所有群組成員都可以設定訊息銷毀時間。陳表示，記憶中各個成員都可以設定，「但我有超過兩年半冇用過通訊軟件」，所以這只是她的記憶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示羅偉光於2020年7月4日傳送給黎智英的一幅文章截圖：「惡法臨城，喺《蘋果》寫專欄15年嘅利世民（李兆富）決定封筆，肥佬黎話，睇到 Simon 封筆，唔好意思要 Simon 再處理佢個 Twitter 嘅事，雖然 po 文係肥佬黎畀
Simon 嘅，但都唔想連累 Simon 受無妄之災。國安震懾之下找個人處理 Twitter 都難，肥佬黎都幾大鑊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳對上述內容有否記憶，陳表示「唔記得」。控方又問陳是否記得最後一次見到李兆富是何時，陳亦表示「唔記得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏國安法生效後-張劍虹曾提醒報導提及制裁要小心&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：國安法生效後 張劍虹曾提醒報導提及「制裁」要小心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月4日的《蘋果》報紙，其中一頁上方寫「一周熱話」，陳指逢星期六論壇版可能圍繞某個主題而設，由主理論壇版的楊清奇籌備。當日主題為「國際棋盤上的香港」，控方問為何挑選這主題，陳則指楊當時沒有解釋原因，「佢淨係話呢個禮拜會用制裁呢個 topic。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到《蘋果》有否在其他欄目使用「制裁」這個主題，陳指黎智英曾經在其專欄「成敗樂一笑」提及這主題。至於《蘋果》對於「制裁」的角度，陳指當外國政府或國會就制裁有新進展，《蘋果》便會報導。她又提到，《國安法》生效之後，「張生（張劍虹）有提及過，做呢啲制裁報導要小心呀。」陳指作為新聞報導，他們只是陳述「有件咁嘅事」，但是評論就是另外一回事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏觀察蘋果評論版傾向揀選對制裁有正面取向或討論制裁效用的作者&quot;&gt;陳沛敏觀察《蘋果》評論版傾向揀選「對制裁有正面取向」或討論制裁效用的作者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰追問，那《蘋果》揀選評論文章作者時，會選擇支持制裁還是反對制裁的作者，他們的角度又是怎樣？陳表示她並沒有參與揀選寫手，但是按她自己的觀察而言，「我會覺得佢係傾向多啲係對制裁有正面取向，或者討論吓佢有冇用呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官問誰人負責揀選作者。陳指《蘋果》社論作者顏純鈎就是由黎智英推薦，並透過張劍虹去聯絡，張有時亦會通知她有新的社論寫手。論壇版作者則是由楊清奇挑選，「我就極少建議寫手」，雖然「我都建議過（寫手），但嗰啲都唔係寫制裁嘅寫手囉」，例如她曾向張劍虹推薦過一個前《有線新聞》記者，因該記者熟悉政策和議會。惟「國際棋盤上的香港」中的3篇文章作者，均不是由她推薦的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰留意到，版面下方有一張遊行相片，有人手持標語「林鄭離晒譜，唔要人工，燒$人工島」，問陳這標語是否反映《蘋果》的立場？陳則指這是由設計部設計的，他們將主題相關的相片拼湊，並放在版面上方和下方，行內俗稱「報眉」和「報腳」，並會給楊清奇或負責的編輯過目，「我諗相和版面主題要係相關，未必係一種立場嘅表示，但一定係要有相關性囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏國安法生效後黎智英繼續邀外國嘉賓出席對談節目-抱持國際壓力有效想法&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：《國安法》生效後黎智英繼續邀外國嘉賓出席對談節目 抱持國際壓力有效想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月14日，特朗普正式簽署《香港自治法》（Hong Kong Autonomy Act）生效，法案授權美國政府制裁有份損害香港自治權的中國及香港官員。7月15日，黎智英向陳沛敏傳送時任美國總統特朗普所簽署的行政命令內文，以及相關白宮網站連結。陳確認，但她稱不記得之後二人有再就此討論，因為黎告知她此消息的同時，報館也收到這消息。不過陳補充，黎特意通知她這消息，「我會理解為佢都好重視呢個新聞囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎有否在其他場合談及這項新聞，陳指黎在其個人專欄、替外國媒體撰文，或者在「飯盒會」裡有談及，她理解黎覺得這些措施是美國對中央政府施加壓力，在《國安法》生效之前，是希望阻止《國安法》生效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過在《國安法》生效之後，陳記得黎有繼續舉辦 Live Chat 節目，所有獲邀嘉賓都是外國人，「所以我嘅理解係，佢係希望透過國際壓力、國際關注，即使喺《國安法》生效之後，佢亦都抱持著呢樣嘢係有效，啫係國際壓力。」控方追問「國際壓力」是包括什麼，陳說：「我諗係包括制裁囉。」控方又問黎談論這些事時，會使用什麼字眼，陳表示不記得具體字眼，或許黎覺得「《國安法》比佢原本想像更加大鑊？⋯⋯所以佢都好緊張」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏同事擔心黎對談節目內容觸犯國安法-惟黎繼續&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：同事擔心黎對談節目內容觸犯國安法 惟黎繼續&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏表示，「我哋嗰時都有少少驚訝」，因為黎繼續製作 Live Chat 節目，當時有些同事嘗試徵詢律師意見，惟控方打斷指法庭不需要知道相關法律意見內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續表示，總之同事之間都擔心黎的 Live Chat 節目內容在國安法之下會否有問題，此外亦有其他傳媒質疑黎的節目內容會否違反《國安法》，「咁我都有去問張生（張劍虹），需唔需要向黎生提出呢個問題」，後來她得知張亦曾經向黎反映同事的擔心和憂慮，「但我見黎生都有繼續做呢個節目。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎有否向陳提及制裁的對象，陳表示：「我理解係港府官員，其他我唔記得。」她亦記得對象是多於一個官員，「但佢（黎）冇好具體咁講過邊個名、邊個名、邊個名。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（22日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第31日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。她憶述時任美國總統特朗普簽署《香港自治法》的行政命令之後，黎智英提出準備一份「Shit List」，她理解黎的意思是「制裁名單」，不過她與同事商討之後，認為很難在新聞中建議一些被制裁對象，所以最終未有落實黎的提議，而只是報導行政命令對香港的影響，當中包括制裁官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美國香港自治法生效後-黎智英曾提議製作shit-list&quot;&gt;美國《香港自治法》生效後 黎智英曾提議製作「Shit List」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第十天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上午審訊提及2020年7月14日，特朗普正式簽署《香港自治法》（Hong Kong Autonomy Act），法案授權美國政府制裁有份損害香港自治權的中國及香港官員。黎智英其後以 WhatsApp 向陳沛敏傳送時任美國總統特朗普所簽署的行政命令內文，以及相關白宮網站連結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，根據陳於2022年11月9日錄取的口供，她與黎曾談論相關事件，並向陳出示該口供紀錄。陳庭上閱畢後，澄清二人並非「額外溝通」，而是文字上的溝通。她記得黎當時以英文提出：「你哋不如整個 Shit List 嘅嘢，但我嗰時唔係好理解 Shit List 係點解」，不過根據訊息前文後理，她理解黎的意思是要製作「制裁名單」。控方遂展示訊息紀錄，黎稱：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’d say we should work up a shit list on those involved in censorship, which can include intimidation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏稱，收到黎的訊息之後，她曾跟同事討論能否做到一個制裁名單，可是其後發現「好難喺個新聞度做到呢樣嘢囉。」她續指，黎的提議最終並沒有做到，「只係（報導）講吓呢個行政命令對香港嘅影響，咁當然包括制裁一啲官員。不過由報紙去建議一啲人（制裁對象）出嚟，咁好難喺新聞做到呢樣嘢囉。」她不肯定此後二人還有否談論過「Shit List」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月16日，《蘋果》頭版報導〈「自由被剝奪 跟大陸無異」 特朗普撤港特殊地位〉。控方續展示黎智英在翌日的 Twitter 帖文，與頭版新聞相關：「#HongKong #SafeHarborAct and #PeoplesFreedomandChoiceAct are good wherewithals to our resistance movement. Salute all former CGs and State Dept staff for caring about this place we call home.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;飯盒會紀錄指國安法紅線模糊按自己良知新聞原則去做&quot;&gt;飯盒會紀錄指「國安法紅線模糊，按自己良知、新聞原則去做」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹和陳沛敏之間的訊息紀錄，顯示陳於2020年7月17日向張傳送「今日飯盒會討論重點」。陳表示該次「飯盒會」由她記錄重點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中第二點，指「字眼可作斟酌，國安法紅線模糊，按自己良知、新聞原則去做」。陳確認會議上曾談論這點，因為《國安法》生效之後，她及其他同事對於哪些題材或字眼犯法，以及做法是否在新聞自由和言論自由的範圍之內，「我哋自己都仲係摸索階段，但每日都仲需要出新聞㗎嘛，所以我哋提出討論。」她指寫得在會議紀錄上的重點，「至少黎生都係同意呢個結論囉」，不過該次會議上未有討論到具體做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;會議紀錄第三點指「多約海外作者」，控方問陳會否記得為何有這討論。陳指「因為係黎生建議囉」，因當時有很多海外媒體和評論都關注香港在《國安法》生效之後的情況，「所以黎生覺得多啲呢啲人嘅意見出現喺《蘋果日報》係需要㗎囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑報導只在最後一段提及建制派觀點-惟未提供全文英文翻譯&quot;&gt;控方質疑報導只在最後一段提及建制派觀點 惟未提供全文英文翻譯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月18日《蘋果》頭版報導為〈美制裁名單 韓正林鄭PK鄧上榜〉，當中引述《彭博新聞社》指特朗普團隊已有制裁名單，包括中共中央政治局常委韓正、時任特首林鄭月娥和時任警務處長鄧炳強，不過當時制裁名單尚未公開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Vxafj1x.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，報導最後一段的副標題為「建制派斥 『石頭掟自己腳』」，當中有提及建制派的看法，除此之外，整篇頭版報導便沒有提及建制派。惟控方並未有將整篇報導翻譯成英文，只翻譯了首段和標題。不懂閱讀中文的法官李素蘭投訴指不知道控方在談論什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則指，整篇文章總共有六個段落，然而提及建制派的內容已佔了其中一段，雖然是否屬「平衡報道」是另一回事，但至少報導中有包括建制派的觀點。法官杜麗冰表示，較恰當的做法是先翻譯整篇報導，稍後才就此文章提問。控方表示會安排翻譯，稍後時間會回歸此議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果頭版報導美籲自由世界戰勝新暴政-陳沛敏確認與黎觀點有關&quot;&gt;蘋果頭版報導「美籲自由世界戰勝新暴政」 陳沛敏確認與黎觀點有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月25日的《蘋果》頭版，標題為〈蓬佩奧尼克遜館宣告 50年對華政策失敗 美籲自由世界戰勝新暴政〉，副題為「北京轟冷戰思維 政治謊言」。陳形容，時任美國國務卿使用「自由世界要戰勝新暴政」如此強烈的字眼，在國際外交和中美關係上都是重要的姿態，所以決定以此報導作為頭版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問這頭版與黎智英的觀點是否有關。陳確認，「因為黎生都係比較重視美國嘅睇法，同埋對中共比較批判，所以我哋覺得呢個新聞係緊要囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果頭版報導朱牧民等6人被通緝-陳沛敏朱應是美國公民-對被通緝感荒謬&quot;&gt;蘋果頭版報導朱牧民等6人被通緝 陳沛敏：朱應是美國公民 對被通緝感荒謬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月2日《蘋果日報》頭版標題為〈國安惡法全球橫行 美籍朱牧民：游說自己國家也被通緝〉。英文譯本將標題譯為「American Nationality Samuel Chu, He is wanted for lobbying his own country.」，惟陳則認為譯做「I am wanted for lobbying my own country」會較好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指 Mark Simon 較早前把朱牧民的聯絡電話傳送給陳沛敏，問上述報導是否與 Mark Simon 的訊息有關。陳則指不相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，頭版包含一個列表，顯示六名人士涉嫌干犯《國安法》罪名而被通緝，包括香港民主委員會前總監朱牧民、前本土民主前線召集人黃台仰、英國駐港總領事館前職員鄭文傑、前學生獨立聯盟召集人陳家駒、前香港眾志創黨主席羅冠聰和「香港效益主義黨」主席劉康。陳確認，並指這六人被指違反《國安法》，「同埋似乎都唔喺香港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於文章內容，陳指朱牧民曾提及自小便離關香港，而且應該是美國公民，「所以佢覺得自己被通緝好荒謬」，因他口中的「自己國家」就是美國，「啫係佢覺得，話佢勾結外國勢力危害國家安全，就好荒謬囉呢件事。」控方追問，朱游說美國去做什麼？陳回答是制裁香港和中國政府官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示黎智英同日的 Twitter 帖文，附有上述報導的連結，並稱：「6 activists are wanted mostly for what they did before imposition of #NationalSecurityLaw . It implies the law is retrospective and anyone ever criticized CCP be aware if you come to HK again. Can this be good for business?」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美國宣布制裁11名官員後-黎智英twitter提及選舉主任應為dq負責&quot;&gt;美國宣布制裁11名官員後 黎智英Twitter提及選舉主任應為DQ負責&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年8月8日的《蘋果》頭版，題為〈美斥打壓民主 制裁林鄭鄧炳強11官〉，並問到，為何版面下方會加插特朗普的相片。陳指，因為法案是由特朗普簽署，而制裁是簽署法案之後引申出來的行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示黎智英於8月8日發布的 Twitter 帖文：「How about those election officers (選舉主任) who disqualified #DQ the candidate nominations ? Should they be personally responsible for making the decisions?」，並附有上述報導連結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，記憶中黎沒有跟她談及對此事情的看法，不過她指報導中的選舉最後沒有舉行。她知道當時有人被DQ，因「如果有人被取消提名，一定會做新聞㗎嘛」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英傳送新聞稿-籲自行決定-惟陳沛敏視之為指示&quot;&gt;黎智英傳送新聞稿 籲「自行決定」 惟陳沛敏：視之為指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月10日，黎智英向陳沛敏發送一份英文新聞稿，當中提及「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」執行總監裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）和前立法會議員羅冠聰，正準備在英國以私人檢控形式起訴英籍香港警察「酷刑罪」。黎並向陳稱：「請自行決定。（Please decide yourself.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過陳表示，她理解黎的訊息是「指示」，因為相關人士可以直接傳送新聞稿給她，「咁佢哋又要透過黎生，咁我會視之為一個指示。」她收到黎的訊息後，便叫同事根據新聞稿內容寫成一篇報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示《蘋果》報導，題為〈國際團隊眾籌控英籍港警〉，文章有提及裴倫德和羅冠聰。陳確認這篇報導基本上是按照黎傳來的新聞稿而撰寫，但同事亦有加上一些背景資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑報導加插眾籌網址-是為了便利讀者接觸&quot;&gt;官質疑報導加插眾籌網址 是為了便利讀者接觸&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰留意到文章中加插了眾籌網址，問陳為何記者會加上，以及為何有需要。陳指，因為通常報導發布之後，有讀者會透過電郵或電話來詢問如何找到相關眾籌網站，他們相信讀者對報導中的眾籌有興趣，所以同事會將網址加入報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官質疑，新聞稿提供前《蘋果》專欄作家 Jack Hazlewood 的聯絡方法，為何卻不在報導中提供，而是提供眾籌網址？陳則指：「因為眾籌網站一 click 就可以去到。」李官指，因此在報導中加入眾籌網址的做法，是要便利讀者接觸眾籌網站。陳則回應，因為 Jack Hazlewood 的聯絡方式並不是給記者作報導用途，而是讓記者有需要時可以聯絡他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英被捕翌日報紙頭版蘋果一定撐落去&quot;&gt;黎智英被捕翌日報紙頭版「蘋果一定撐落去」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎智英於2020年8月10日被拘捕，《蘋果》翌日頭版標題為〈200警搜壹傳媒 拘黎智英 「蘋果一定撐落去」〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cx0Fl7q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「蘋果一定撐落去」是否黎的言論，陳則指張劍虹都有講過此說話。控方遂指報導首段提到：「壹傳媒行政總裁、《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹就表示：『蘋果一定可以撐落去！』」陳確認。控方又特別指出報導其中一句：「對於警方翻天覆地搜查，黎指警方絕對是打壓新聞自由，形容：『煮到埋嚟咪食，冇得擔心，擔心唔到咁多。』」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，報導指：「警方搜查行動至傍晚6時許才結束，其間拆走伺服器及取走《蘋果》基金部份文件。本報副社長陳沛敏在 Facebook 表明，『所有同事會繼續編採工作。新聞繼續發佈，報紙明天照常出街。』」控方問陳為何會在 Facebook 發文。陳稱，因為很多新聞界行家都查詢翌日《蘋果》報紙能否出版，大家都不知道案件詳情，所以她發佈帖文，好像是「話畀出面嘅人知，我哋個個人仲喺報館做緊嘢，個網站仲有即時新聞出街，呢單新聞又好，其他新聞又好，其實已經知道公司聽日係會有報紙出到街嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;頭版報導下方有堅守崗位撐到底聲明-陳沛敏稱是其主意-表達公司看法&quot;&gt;頭版報導下方有「堅守崗位，撐到底！」聲明 陳沛敏稱是其主意 表達公司看法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，新聞報導下方有一個類似聲明的欄目，題為：「堅守崗位，撐到底！」陳稱這是她的主意，不過內文並非由她撰寫，而是她叫文筆較好的同事按照她的主意撰寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問這聲明是否反映她真心所相信的事情。陳表示：「當時係，因為覺得搜報館係好大件事，咁同埋張生嗰一句說話『蘋果一定撐落去』」，加上當時很多新聞界同業人士曾問公司對於事件的立場，因此她根據張劍虹該句說話的意思及精神，「啫係要表達一下我哋對呢件事嘅睇法囉。」她確認同意聲明內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前曾稱預料昨日（2月21日）能完成主問，惟直至今日仍未完成。控方在散庭前表示，有信心可在下星期一（2月26日）內完成主問，但餘下部份需時不會短。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押後至下星期一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China policy has changed markedly on both sides of the Atlantic in the past decade, transatlantic cooperation on China remains limited in extent and impact, ad hoc and reactive. Yet enhanced pooling of efforts and more systematic cooperation promises increased policy effectiveness. This paper investigates the reasons for this limited cooperation on China in three separate but related domains: economics; security; and the multilateral system and global norms. It identifies where there is a need for better mutual understanding of divergent positions, and where and through what mechanisms cooperation might be strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transatlantic partners agree that China represents a challenge, even a threat. There is consensus on the need for de-risking, on the desire to maintain the security status quo in the Indo-Pacific, and on the need to counter China’s actions on the world stage. In its specifics, however, the challenge looks different on each side of the Atlantic. The US is concerned about threats to its technological, military and economic leadership, whereas Europe’s focus is on the risks of economic dependency, with some concern about China’s agenda for global governance. There is also significant divergence between European countries, which makes even a common European position challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the economic domain, countries have different interpretations and priorities for de-risking. The US prioritises defending its leadership in certain key technologies, while European countries focus on diversifying their economic relationship with China and maintaining strong commercial connections. There is also a difference of pace and urgency, with the US wanting to move more quickly than most European countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the security domain, there is consensus across the Atlantic on the need to uphold the existing Indo-Pacific order against Beijing’s attempts to overturn it. In contrast with the US’s dominant role on security matters in the Indo-Pacific, European partners are best placed to do more in non-traditional security domains and to strengthen economic deterrence. Continued European reliance on the US security umbrella in Europe suggests the need for an explicit transatlantic discussion on how security efforts in Europe and the Indo-Pacific link together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the multilateral system and global norms, there is agreement on the challenge but divergence on specifics. Recent years have seen a more cohesive G7 and its informal expansion at times to a G7+. However, the transatlantic partners have done much less than China in proposing an updated vision of global governance that is appealing to the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective transatlantic cooperation requires alignment, if not agreement, on the urgency and severity of the challenge posed by China. But joint action demands specifics and granularity and, on this level, there is as much disagreement as agreement. More effective transatlantic cooperation begins with the recognition of this plurality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to strengthen transatlantic cooperation, this paper proposes that partners invest in a process that articulates a realistic shared vision for future China relations; a target “endgame” to guide cooperation. Without a clear view of what future relations with China would look like, it is hard to develop policy and judge if that policy is appropriate or effective. The different positions on each side of the Atlantic mean that there is also benefit in investing in a structured transatlantic process to narrow perception gaps about the risks and benefits that China brings. The security domain offers the greatest potential for increased clarity on roles and activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, China policy in North America and Europe has shifted dramatically from seeing Beijing primarily as an economic partner of choice to framing it as an economic, technological, diplomatic and security challenge. This transformation has been accelerated by changes in China as Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, has centralised power, curbed opposition and adopted a more assertive foreign and security policy. Understanding that such an “epoch-defining challenge”, as the UK government puts it, requires a coordinated and comprehensive response, the US and its key allies have toughened their policies towards China and explored various forms of policy coordination across a wide spectrum of issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordination both enhances policy effectiveness (for example, on technology controls) and allows cost- and burden-sharing (for example, on security provision). However, the transatlantic approach to date remains more reactive and ad hoc than systematic and cooperative. Effective cooperation requires more than a list of abstract principles and disparate grievances about aspects of the current challenge. It requires the governments concerned to have a clearer view of an “endgame”, in other words, to articulate the outlines of a desirable future relationship with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper concludes a Chatham House–RUSI research project (supported by the Carnegie Corporation of New York) focused on transatlantic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The first paper in the project profiled the priorities of the US and Europe in the Indo-Pacific. The second reviewed how key Indo-Pacific partners assessed this engagement. This final paper outlines the limits and possibilities of transatlantic cooperation by examining the current state of China policy in key areas of mutual interest. It explores the extent to which transatlantic partners’ objectives, both explicit and implicit, are truly shared, and considers how to best manage divergent interests within a broader frame of cooperation. The paper seeks to clarify the tensions in discussions about transatlantic China policy, rather than exhaustively examining all China-related questions. Understanding these perspectives, and their underlying rationales, is vital for effective future transatlantic cooperation on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper is situated within the findings of several studies that approached aspects of this subject between 2019 and 2022. The paper is designed to complement these studies by eliciting observations and proposals from policy practitioners (public officials and experts) drawn from across the US and Europe who agreed to discuss possible endgames for their respective China policies. Workshops with these practitioners were held throughout 2023 in London, Berlin and Washington, DC with the aim of promoting a forward-looking debate among key policymakers about the trajectory of transatlantic China policies in the areas of economics, security and global governance. Participants were selected based on their seniority, expertise and breadth of professional backgrounds, spanning foreign ministries, defence ministries, intelligence agencies, think tanks, academia and the private sector. In all, workshop participants joined from all the largest transatlantic countries to provide a diversity of views. The workshops applied the Chatham House Rule to ensure that participants could speak openly about sensitive issues. Clarity on areas of divergence as well as convergence is vital to fostering deeper cooperation on China that fully accounts for the financial and other costs that accompany – but should not outweigh – the benefits of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has three sections, reflecting the three domains at the heart of transatlantic China policies: economics; security; and the contest for the multilateral system and global norms. These domains are interlinked but reflect distinct areas of policy focus. The paper argues that, in the economic domain, the absence of a shared vision for the preferred future relationship with China makes it difficult to reach agreement, both on the scale of sacrifice justified in gaining the strategic payoff and on how to distribute the cost. In the security domain, differences in capacity and role specialisation produce complementarities that can make cooperation more effective, through a division of labour. When it comes to the multilateral system and norms, transatlantic cooperation has been most effective in the context of a revived, more prominent role for the G7 (at the expense of the G20), its informal extension to a G7+, and the formation of new issue-specific minilateral frameworks. The outlook in established multilateral institutions is cloudier. While the G7+ now cooperate more effectively at a tactical level to counter China’s growing influence, they do not offer a common and compelling grand narrative about world order. US engagement is particularly prone to change depending on the administration. In light of this, purchase on the wider global governance agenda is faltering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economics&quot;&gt;ECONOMICS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest shifts in China policy across the US and Europe have come on the economic front. Liberal democracies have substantially reassessed the risks and rewards of doing business with and in China. After some initial calls for a broad “decoupling” from China, the US, Canada, Japan and key European allies settled on the concept of “de-risking” at the G7 leaders’ meeting in Hiroshima, Japan, in May 2023. However, according to a participant in the London workshop, “De-risking is ambiguous. It can mean all things to all people”. For China, “de-risking is just decoupling in disguise”, added another participant, quoting Chinese state media. One objective of the workshops was to identify areas of agreement and substantive divergence among transatlantic partners on de-risking, as well as promoting more open recognition of these tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was broad consensus about the economic risks posed by China. These included: a perceived over-reliance on China for critical imports such as processed rare earth minerals; Beijing’s use of outbound direct investment and research partnerships to acquire sensitive, often dual-use, technologies; and the presence of forced labour in some, especially Xinjiang-linked, supply chains. These come on top of longstanding concerns about intellectual property theft and lack of reciprocal market access. China’s use of economic coercion – for example, against Lithuania and Australia – was also mentioned, although less frequently by US participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across Europe and the US, governments have implemented a range of defensive measures to mitigate these risks. These include enhanced inbound investment screening; intensified scrutiny of Chinese university partnerships and research students; export controls; legislation to ban the use of forced labour in supply chains; and the EU’s Anti-Coercion Instrument. The modest extent of cooperation in this area is made clear by the varied scope and stringency of these measures, both between EU member states and between Europe and the US, especially relating to outbound investment and export controls, where the policy debate has only just started in Europe. This reflects differing views on the scale and urgency of the risks relative to the benefits of continuing economic engagement. Such differences come in part from different starting points: unlike Europe, the US is a global military and technology leader and therefore faces unique risks to its power from China’s growing technological sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fissure on the extent and purpose of de-risking emerged during the workshops. The US is seeking to maintain its technological lead over China, not to simply reduce risks; in the words of National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, the US wants to keep a “small yard and high fence” to protect key US technologies from China. In September 2022 he said: “Given the foundational nature of certain technologies, such as advanced logic and memory chips, we must maintain as large of a lead as possible”. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has since argued that measures would be “transparent, narrowly scoped, and targeted to clear objectives … not used by us to gain economic advantage”. Indeed, US commercial engagement with China remains strong outside the targeted technologies. Workshop participants acknowledged, however, that these targeted technologies are inherently dual use. As such, export controls also affect China’s economic development. For some, this is an inescapable by-product of the national security objective, for others, a welcome brake on China’s growth. Many workshop participants were concerned that the yard would get bigger and the fence higher as US–China relations became locked in an escalating cycle of economic countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European perspective is different. As one participant put it: “De-risking is a question of degree and time: the US wants a rapid de-risking. Italy and many others in the EU agree with de-risking, but don’t want to move so quickly or widely”. For Europe, resilience and diversification in the face of China’s coercive use of trade relations are the priorities, which by and large allow the benefits of bilateral trade and investment to continue. The large business delegations that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron took to Beijing in 2022 and 2023 suggest that the EU’s biggest economies remain hopeful about economic opportunities, despite the continuing challenges facing China’s now slower-growth economy. Other European workshop participants made clear their appetite to partner with China to gain access to electric vehicle technology. Given China’s leadership in renewable technologies, workshop participants questioned whether there could be a “green Europe” without China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US drive to maintain technological and economic supremacy over China is intimately linked to the Biden (and previously the Trump) administration’s efforts to revitalise the US economy through trade protectionism and industrial policy. The Biden administration is quite explicit about its pursuit of a “foreign policy for the middle class”. The adoption of large subsidies and incentives for those investing in the US, under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), represents a direct competitive threat to the industrial development of European nations, which seem less able to offer similar incentives for companies to invest in Europe. Although one participant in the Washington, DC workshop argued that the CHIPS Act and the IRA would present companies from key ally states with substantial opportunities to invest in the US, most officials and experts acknowledged that this is a fundamental tension in transatlantic China policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous joint statements from US and European leaders have called for cooperation on supply chain resilience and coordination in combating China’s use of economic coercion. The 13-member Minerals Security Partnership is a rare example of transatlantic cooperation (and beyond) to secure resilient supply chains. Other initiatives are not transatlantic in nature. For the US, both the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and the Quad plan to address supply chain resilience in broad terms, while numerous European initiatives do not include the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond rare earth minerals, however, participants across the three workshops argued that many countries have yet to work out which are the most critical economic chokepoints and what are the realistic options for diversification. A participant in the Berlin workshop said: “On economic security, there are so many instruments that often the tail is wagging the dog”. Another suggested that: “We need to ask what we want to achieve, and we need to differentiate between trade volume and trade quality. What is ‘safe’ trade with China? There’s a difference between dependence and vulnerability”. Workshop participants from Eastern Europe placed a greater urgency on diversifying away from China than did those from southern Europe. According to one: “We are already decoupling and learning lessons from Russia”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the results of EU risk assessments are more consistent with US policy than might be suggested by these differing views across Europe and the lack of an analytical mechanism supporting transatlantic cooperation; the first proposed set of restricted export technologies from the EU mirrors the US list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also highlighted the need for a more broadly contextualised conversation about the potential costs of de-risking for governments, companies and society. This needs to go hand in hand with an assessment of the costs of inaction. Many multinationals are reducing their reliance on China-based manufacturing, even as overall trade with China remains strong. German Chancellor Scholz has gone as far as to say that “de-risking … is mainly about decisions that need to be taken by companies”. But commercial interests alone are not sufficient to de-risk vulnerabilities in critical national infrastructure. How willing are governments to impose national security decisions that harm commercial interests? Greater transatlantic coordination on areas such as export controls would likely make such measures more effective. But more coordination would require explicit agreement on burden sharing, not only between the transatlantic governments, but also with other allies, including Australia, Japan and South Korea, to ensure that no country’s companies benefit unduly at the expense of others. According to one participant: “There’s still no answer as to who bears the cost of de-risking”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the biggest questions about vulnerabilities and de-risking can only be answered at a sovereign, national level. But participants did call for transatlantic governments to deepen their conversation about the competitive and cooperative elements of de-risking. The EU–US Trade and Technology Council, established in 2021, is intended to take on part of this role. However, several participants argued that it was yet to show much progress, and that time is taken up more with resolving differences between the US and the EU. The development of G7 (and G7+) processes to some extent brings in the UK and other non-EU partners, chiefly Australia, Japan and South Korea. Beyond talking, several participants argued that the best way to ensure more resilience and deeper transatlantic cooperation in the face of China’s manufacturing strength is for the US to embrace trade and economic liberalisation once again, indicated by one participant’s comment: “True diversification will require a level playing field in the US”. Political realities may stand in the way of this for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;SECURITY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While transatlantic governments are seeking to alter the economic status quo with China, in the area of security they see themselves as trying to uphold the existing order against Beijing’s attempts to overturn it. Compared with the economic domain, China’s challenge to the security status quo appears more clearly defined and views on it are broadly shared on both sides of the Atlantic. But there are significant differences in perceptions of the urgency of the China challenge, in estimates of the acceptable costs of deterring potential crises, and in views on how those costs should be fairly distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prime example is Taiwan, where the US and its European allies agree that their interests are best served by the preservation of the current position, ensuring no use of force and no unilateral change to the island’s ambiguous international status. While there has been no change in Beijing’s formal position on Taiwan (commitment to reunification and not renouncing the use of force if necessary), there has been increased Chinese military and grey-zone activity, especially since 2020. Workshop participants broadly shared the view that the risk of Beijing acting on Taiwan has increased significantly as its military capabilities grow and its regional behaviour has become more assertive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the South China Sea, as well as the Indo-Pacific more broadly, workshop participants consistently stressed that the US and Europe wish to maintain freedom of navigation and overflight, and to ensure that any disputes are resolved through negotiation according to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and not by coercion. They reported that they view Beijing’s island-building, the aggressive behaviour of its maritime and air forces, and its claims to almost the entire South China Sea (and rejection of the 2016 UNCLOS Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling on China’s excessive claims to maritime rights in the South China Sea) as unilateral attempts to alter the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many European governments, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine heightened concerns about China’s security ambitions. This is both because of the Russia–China partnership, however substantive, and the stark reminder, very close to home, that expansionary wars under the threat of nuclear weapons are not consigned to the past. Some workshop participants argued that the war in Ukraine might presage an eventual “division of labour” between the US and Europe, with the former taking the lead in deterring China in the Indo-Pacific while Europe focuses on countering Russia in its own backyard (requiring Europe to substantially increase defence spending). However, most participants argued that the war had highlighted the indivisibility of the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific, with some warning of the risks of tackling the two geographies separately. This all highlights the need for broader and deeper security consultation, and perhaps even deeper cooperation, between US allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. As Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said in June 2022: “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the US and its European allies have broadly similar interests, they assign different degrees of importance to these interests, and bring very different capabilities to bear. In terms of military power, participants agreed that within Europe, only the UK and France have the capacity and geographical reach to maintain a continuous – albeit limited – presence in the Indo-Pacific, although Germany too is keen to show that it can do more. Other European nations can contribute in areas not requiring conventional power projection, such as cyber security and countering disinformation. The UK and France, with or without the rest of Europe, clearly have much less effect on the military balance of power in the Indo-Pacific than does the US. Beyond military deployments, workshop participants argued that European nations could contribute the most by helping to reinforce the US alliance system and by doing more in non-traditional security, such as maritime law. Both areas strengthen deterrence, which is the priority in maintaining the status quo. As one participant in the workshop in Washington, DC explained, “the perception of a network of allies and partners is important for deterring China”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely in response to China’s growing assertiveness, the US’s European and Indo-Pacific allies have been deepening their security links. Since 2022, the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea (the “AP4”) have attended NATO summits. However, even after China appeared in the 2019 NATO Strategic Concept, NATO’s role in the Indo-Pacific continues to be debated. France in particular has argued for countries to engage individually in the region rather than as Alliance members, blocking a NATO liaison office in Tokyo. Other workshop participants mentioned NATO’s existing out-of-region liaison offices and the AP4’s appetite for a higher NATO profile in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK stands out among its European allies in being part of two strategically important defence procurement partnerships that could, if successful, affect the region’s military balance of power over the medium to long term. One workshop participant described the Australia–UK–US (AUKUS) partnership announced in 2021, through which the UK and the US are helping Australia to acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines and are cooperating on advanced technologies, as “the jewel in the crown”. AUKUS training arrangements will also see UK attack submarines regularly deployed to the region from 2027, bolstering the persistent presence in the Indo-Pacific that Britain restored in 2021. The Global Combat Air Programme, in which Italy has joined Japan and the UK to develop a next-generation stealth fighter that will come into service in the mid-2030s, is a second instance of a strategic commitment to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was widespread agreement in the workshops on the value of increasing cooperation on non-traditional security across the Indo-Pacific, and with respect to Taiwan specifically. China is especially active in grey-zone tactics that project power beneath the threshold of overt armed conflict. Such tactics make the calibration of responses more challenging. Chinese cyber activity and influence operations are widespread across the region, including in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and the Pacific Islands. The UK and other European countries should support Taiwan on cyber resilience and undersea cable protection. In the case of Taiwan, one participant in London proposed Finland and Switzerland as countries that could share lessons on whole-of-society defence and resilience. European support on disaster relief and countering illegal fishing, smuggling and narcotics activity would also be welcomed in the region. This would be less sensitive than traditional security engagement, and could complement the higher-profile US hard security presence and US Coast Guard activities. Just as with hard security, participants spoke of the need for better coordination of such activities between countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation here is seen in patterns of execution and implementation, within broadly agreed complementary roles for each side of the Atlantic, rather than being a product of formal multilateral arrangements. A deeper divergence was, however, clear and consistent across all three workshops: there were striking differences between the US and many European participants on the urgency of the need to strengthen deterrence of Chinese action on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With smaller militaries, and without collective defence commitments in the region requiring their militaries to deploy forward at scale, Europeans are staking less than the US on maintaining the security status quo in the Indo-Pacific. And they are more risk averse. While the Pentagon talks about China as the “pacing challenge”, participants across all three workshops expressed concern that European governments were too optimistic about the odds of avoiding conflict over Taiwan. One participant said: “Europe is not alarmed enough about the risks to Taiwan”. The US may not have large numbers of troops based in Taiwan, but it does have a commitment under its own domestic legislation to ensure Taiwan has the means to defend itself, putting its credibility on the line. One participant argued that European partners could do more to contribute to deterrence by making “clear to China publicly and privately that war over Taiwan would have disastrous economic consequences”, adding that “any perception of European indifference over a Taiwan conflict makes it more likely”. Closed door discussions seem to be taking place, but deterrence requires more. It requires signalling and demonstrating the preparation of credible sanctions that would follow a Chinese attack. Given China’s grey-zone tactics and potential to, say, impose a blockade on Taiwan, work is needed on a spectrum of responses to different triggers. But without political, let alone legal, commitments to Taiwan, Europe does not face a credibility risk comparable to that of the US. The different stance on de-risking also reflects the fact that sanctions policy is within the competence of the EU and as such requires unanimity, making it a more difficult weapon to unsheathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased sharing by the US of the intelligence underpinning its security threat assessment in the Indo-Pacific may lead to greater, more urgent efforts in Europe. Additionally, any move by the US to link its security support in Europe to a more formal European commitment to Indo-Pacific security would incentivise a more serious discussion. This might result in a commitment to economic sanctions over Taiwan in specific circumstances, or a further shifting of resources from the European theatre to the Indo-Pacific. The case of Taiwan suggests that, while such a serious discussion might be the basis for coordinated security policy on the Indo-Pacific, it does not seem to be taking place. Unsurprisingly, then, beyond the question of Taiwan, there seems to be little agreement on or thinking about the outline of a new security equilibrium in the Indo-Pacific in response to China’s perceptions of what constitute its own legitimate security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While maintaining the status quo remains a shared transatlantic objective, China’s own security ambitions continue to grow alongside its military capabilities. Xi’s Global Security Initiative, launched in 2022, offers an all-encompassing if vague “vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security”. It is again the US leading the pushback in the Indo-Pacific against China’s attempts to sign security partnerships – successful in the case of the Solomon Islands, but unsuccessful with 10 Pacific Island states. The Partners in the Blue Pacific initiative does, however, represent a renewed allied willingness to engage and invest in the Pacific Islands, where China has become more active, with the UK, Canada and Germany as members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remains too the question of where discussion and agreement with China on security matters is desirable and possible, with the Middle East an obvious area of potential cooperation, as well as competition. European workshop participants saw a greater need than those from the US to include China, and find ways where engagement can work. Potential areas include smuggling, piracy and illegal fishing. At a global level there is a need to define agreements in emerging areas such as AI and space, but making progress remains challenging while China sees its own opacity and unpredictability as a source of leverage. China has only just agreed to restore the military-to-military contacts with the US that were broken off for over a year following the visit of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan in August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multilateral-institutions-and-global-norms&quot;&gt;MULTILATERAL INSTITUTIONS AND GLOBAL NORMS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of global governance, most participants maintained that Beijing represented a serious challenge to US and European global interests, although several argued that China’s global ambitions were far more limited than most analysts assume. US and European governments are in broad agreement about the need to support the multilateral system in a way that addresses today’s global challenges, while reinforcing the rules-based international order (RBIO). There is increasingly a tendency in Chinese rhetoric to equate the RBIO with the US-led global order, and therefore to seek a stronger position for China in existing multilateral institutions by various means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has become increasingly active on this front, emphasising the importance of UN institutions, seeking reform, competing more actively for leadership roles and investing in acquiring posts for its citizens. Chinese diplomats repeatedly position China as the champion of the UN system. In areas such as human rights, cyber sovereignty and the setting of some technology standards, China seeks to redefine key elements of the RBIO in ways that differ markedly from what is acceptable to the transatlantic partners. On human rights, China is seeking to shift the narrative away from universal individual political rights, of the sort enshrined by liberal democracies, to communal development and security rights as determined by each nation. This all comes at a time when there is a pressing need to develop rules, norms and standards in areas such as climate, technology, data and AI. Additionally, China has at times not complied with rulings that run counter to its own position, notably the 2016 UNCLOS ruling on the South China Sea. During the Covid-19 pandemic, China’s actions to obfuscate and block World Health Organization (WHO) investigations reinforced these concerns. In parallel to seeking increased influence within the UN system, China has launched a series of expansive, loosely defined initiatives including the Belt and Road (BRI) Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Development Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative. While deriding US-led minilaterals such as the Quad and the G7 as examples of “forming ‘blocs’”, Beijing is driving an expansion of groupings such as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, where it has a leading role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While participants in the Berlin, London and Washington, DC workshops confirmed this shared view of this challenge, they identified clear differences about how best to respond. Policy experts and officials acknowledged several fundamental tensions. Firstly, between a US that is increasingly sceptical about the effectiveness of global institutions and is in many places creating its own new minilateral structures, and its European allies, which are much more committed to a more-inclusive multilateralism, both in principle and as a function of their status as middle powers. Secondly, between the need to reform global institutions to incorporate a bigger voice for developing nations, and the desire to maintain the dominance of the US and its allies. And thirdly, between the ambition to pursue pragmatic cooperation with influential nations in the Global South and to compete more effectively there with China, and practical limitations on financial resources, coupled with a desire to defend human rights and advance democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the workshops there was little agreement on how to reform existing multilateral institutions in ways acceptable on both sides of the Atlantic. One participant said “the US has been on the wrong side of the argument” in opposing quota changes at the World Bank. The US decision not to nominate members to the WTO’s Appellate Body after 2011 undercuts the argument that China must fulfil promises it made about transitioning to a market economy. While the Biden administration has rejoined the Paris climate agreement, the WHO and UNESCO, a future Republican president may change course again and be less interested in reform of the UN system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many participants argued that this reflected the reality that the US and China were increasingly at odds in multilateral forums, and that global institutions had struggled to make meaningful contributions on both Covid-19 and Ukraine. One participant said: “In future, global multilateral institutions will be places of contestation between the US and its allies and partners against China and other illiberal powers”. Reaching agreement in the G20 has also become more difficult, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Increasingly, transatlantic partners have turned to the G7 for policy coordination, extending invitations to a select group of G7+ countries such as India, South Korea and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More positively, several participants argued that Western countries have responded well on a tactical level to China’s increased efforts in the UN system. Coordination and responsiveness between the allies have improved. One participant cited as an example the appointment of Singaporean Daren Tang as head of the World Intellectual Property Organization over China’s candidate. However, another participant described the West as having “walked off the pitch” in pushing back against China’s reinterpretations of UN resolutions. Chinese diplomats are investing substantial time in embedding Chinese initiatives such as the Global Development Initiative into UN processes and statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other participants, however, warned of the dangers of viewing global institutions and the contest for global values and norms in such Manichean terms. Many called for the US and European allies to cooperate more effectively in their engagement with the Global South, offering more tangible development benefits and supporting the agency of these countries even when they do not agree with Western policy. This becomes more critical as the G7 grows in importance relative to the G20 for the US and Europe. According to one participant, “We need to be more comfortable with countries in the Global South saying no to us … We need to embrace regional bodies like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum because they’re binding China to the regional architecture”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the reform of global institutions, US participants spoke of the benefits of “variable geometry” and “coalitions of the willing”, of pragmatically including different countries on different topics. This is consistent with a 2021 speech in which Jake Sullivan referred to a “latticework of alliances and partnerships”. The US has indeed launched a series of minilateral initiatives, such as the Quad, the IPEF, AUKUS, Partners in the Blue Pacific and the Minerals Security Partnership – some only with Indo-Pacific countries and some with its larger transatlantic partners. One European participant questioned whether the US wants Europe as an ally in the Indo-Pacific, or whether it is content to develop separate Indo-Pacific-facing structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narrative was a major point of contention in discussions about the multilateral order, reflecting the importance of what the Chinese Communist Party calls “discourse power”. There was agreement that China has a more appealing narrative to many countries in the Global South, one that prioritises non-intervention and economic development over international law and individual human rights. China’s initiatives and its engagement with the UN appear to offer the Global South more than the West does, even if the initiatives lack detail and are met with healthy scepticism in much of the Global South. China continues to expand its ambitions here, launching in September 2023 its proposals and actions for “A Global Community of Shared Future”. Several participants noted that there was no competing narrative from the US and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration and the UK government have in the past year dialled down any rhetoric about facing China in a battle between autocracies and democracies. Participants broadly agreed that framing competition with Beijing in terms of values would alienate many developing countries, including key partners such as India and Indonesia, with one stating: “The narrative that works for the US and Europe doesn’t work for much of Asia” and “rules resonate more than values in Asia”. However, several participants warned that Europe and Asia could not afford to sit on the sidelines as China promotes its alternative vision of the global order. Japan and India were both proposed as countries that could take a more prominent role in advocating visions that are different from China’s and not suffer from perceptions of Western hegemony. Participants noted too that narrative alone was not enough. Perceptions persist that China offers development support unrivalled by the US and Europe, although China prioritises lending over development assistance and its terms are often opaque and unattractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussions about global institutions and norms yielded the least consensus among participants, largely because there is little consensus within Europe and the US about how much to invest in reforming the multilateral system at a time when confidence within the West about the universal applicability of human rights and democracy seems to be waning. Most participants could agree, at least, on the need for new thinking, with one saying, “The post-war unipolar moment is gone … Rather than trying to prop it up, how do we shape the new emerging order? China has competing visions of the international order across the digital, technology, climate and security domains. How can we generate a collective response?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves unresolved the question of how and where to engage China on global governance. European countries have shown a greater appetite to engage with China through multilateral structures. The Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which has its headquarters in Beijing, continues to have 14 European members, while the US did not join. Several European countries enthusiastically joined the BRI, although Italy has now exited. The EU has resumed its human rights dialogue with China. Within the Indo-Pacific, however, engagement with China is integral to international relations – either through Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade agreement, or the ASEAN+3 discussions, or China’s applications to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement. Perhaps, as one participant suggested, “The Indo-Pacific is the crucible for the rules-based order of the future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions-and-policy-implications&quot;&gt;CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trend towards enhanced transatlantic coordination on China policy has intensified under the Biden administration. Yet, as discussions move beyond broad principles to specific policies, uncertainties arise and threaten to blunt implementation. Are objectives and desired endgames really shared, or even brought into focus at all? Do governments have similar assessments of the China challenge, of the urgency and need to act, and of their respective roles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across economics, security and global governance, policy practitioners at the workshops highlighted agreement on objectives among the transatlantic partners, but only in terms broad enough to allow space for different interpretations. There is consensus on the need for de-risking, the desire to maintain the security status quo in the Indo-Pacific, and the need to counter China’s actions on the world stage and its alternative vision for world order. But joint action demands specifics and granularity, and on that level, there is as much disagreement as agreement. More effective transatlantic cooperation begins with the recognition of this plurality. This would allow the transatlantic partners either to strive for a common understanding or to design complementary – or, at least, non-contradictory – actions that take account of what may prove a chronic divergence of views. European officials know that Beijing tries to play them off against each other and against the US. Indeed, China’s persistent efforts to create such divisions are a strong signal of the benefits of closer cooperation for transatlantic partners where objectives are truly shared. But Europeans also want the US to better understand their own interests. There is no reason to fear that acknowledging differences signals disunity to China if broad overall agreement remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the economic sphere, the US sees de-risking as an urgent imperative to preserve its technological leadership so as to protect its national security while building better capabilities at home, even where this limits its continuing and very large commercial relationship with China. For most of Europe, the China threat feels less urgent. Two years into the war in Ukraine, Xi continues to express his friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but European policy on China remains defined by a logic of economic security, with resilience at the centre, pursued largely through diversification, while maintaining beneficial commercial engagement. Differences in risk assessment and economic interests within Europe make extensive pan-European cooperation difficult. In the case of EU members, the division of policy responsibilities between the European Commission and the member states makes it more difficult still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly powerful transatlantic cooperation requires alignment, if not agreement, on the urgency and severity of the security threat posed by a more technologically capable China. Absent that, the greatest potential for cooperation lies in continuous case-by-case engagement on the specifics of the highest priority cases and why action is justified. Adjusting US industrial policy so that European partners see it as less of a competitive threat to Europe’s own ambitions would also enhance cooperation, accelerating “friendshoring” for resilience. European partners seek reassurance, too, that American companies will not benefit at their expense if they go along with US controls. The political and practical challenges of implementing this in the US remain significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On matters of Indo-Pacific security, agreement on policy objectives goes beyond the broad principles and is more specific. The current limited number of European actors able to project military capabilities in a crisis scenario leaves the US as the dominant security provider in the Indo-Pacific. This makes for a clear division of roles and capabilities between the transatlantic partners, and would seem to lay the ground for complementary, mutually reinforcing actions. The workshops confirmed a US perspective that Europe’s most important role is economic, but also identified areas of soft security where a larger number of European actors are well placed to act. However, this structural stability is at odds with divergent threat perceptions across the Atlantic, and with divergences over the need to build credibility and deterrence now with China with regard to the economic consequences of an attack on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need to put into action a range of continuing non-traditional security measures through which European countries help strengthen Taiwan’s resilience and support regional security. Greater information sharing by the US of its risk assessments may change views in Europe on the urgency of action, especially beyond the UK, France and Germany. Alternatively, the US might choose to make an explicit link between its continued security support in Europe and the actions it sees as required in the Indo-Pacific. Although evidence collected for this paper focused on Taiwan, such an understanding might apply to other aspects of European soft security in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outlook for cooperation is least promising in global governance. There is, again, broad agreement on the need to counter the adulteration of universal principles (for example, human rights) that has resulted from China’s attempts to elevate its influence in the UN and other global institutions. Through the stronger role for the G7+, and a burgeoning number of minilateral “latticework” structures, transatlantic partners and other like-minded countries are creating issue-focused structures. However, larger-scale cooperation, for example a revival of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement or an integration with the similar CPTPP agreement in Asia, appears beyond the realm of the possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also lacking is a credible plan for global governance that goes beyond the primary focus on like-minded countries. As China positions itself as champion of the Global South in the UN system, transatlantic partners do not have practical reform proposals that will help developing nations gain a greater voice in global institutions. The US’s appetite to engage is uncertain. A change of administration may bring clarity, albeit in the form of reduced engagement. For the Global South, China has a narrative and continues to provide, albeit on terms that are sometimes onerous and opaque, convincing quantities of financing. The US and Europe should put more effort into articulating a similar compelling narrative for the Global South – indeed, simply listening to the perspectives of others would be a good start. Initiatives such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships in Indonesia and Vietnam indicate movement in this direction, but finding the money to scale this up will be difficult at times of competing budgetary pressures at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the scale of the challenge from China, cooperation will be vital for an effective China policy in the US and Europe. The research for this paper has highlighted the benefit of taking the time to understand the foundations and mechanics of successful cooperation. These include: shared assessments of the nature, scale and urgency of the challenge; an understanding of where specific objectives are shared and where they are not; and a willingness and ability to take action in pursuit of these objectives. These principles are even more important at a time of heightened political uncertainty in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changes continue in China too. Alongside stronger technological capabilities and increased military spending, China’s economy is struggling to find new sources of growth amid a real-estate crisis, high debt levels and an ageing population. Notable in the workshop discussions was a sense that China’s direction is fixed, known and not amenable to influence from within or without. This marks a sharp shift from the over-optimistic views of the past, that engagement by the West would put China on the path to political liberalisation. Now the pendulum may have swung too far the other way. There was extensive discussion during the workshops on the essentially defensive measures needed to address challenges from China, but few contributions on how the transatlantic partners view relations with China in the round, as China continues to play a major role in the global economy and safeguard its own security concerns. A serious search for a vision of the “endgame” for relations with China as a basis on which to structure long-term transatlantic cooperation would benefit from placing less weight on China’s cohesion and strength, and paying more attention to some of its underlying domestic weaknesses, not to mention its ability to change course, well demonstrated by Communist Party leadership in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopes that the end of the Trump presidency would improve conditions for transatlantic cooperation on China have not been entirely fulfilled. Two points may help explain this. First, while investment in understanding China on the part of the US and Europe has increased, institutional support for transatlantic understanding and dialogue is relatively neglected. Without a determined and resourced effort to develop channels for regular, open and honest dialogue on commonalities and differences, transatlantic cooperation will continue to fall behind. Second, levels of knowledge and political confidence on both sides of the Atlantic seem insufficient to project a positive picture of what relations with China could or should become in the future. The result is a mismatch: on the one hand, grandiose assessments of China, described by the UK as an “epoch-making challenge” and by the US as “the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it”, and on the other, a set of primarily defensive policy actions taken by countries individually and G7 declarations that communicate alignment but deliver limited specific action. How an endgame vision for desired future relations with China can help set transatlantic allies on a path of closer cooperation to make that vision a reality is an urgent question for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

This debate has become toxic partly because many of the measures of what allies are doing remain shielded from public view.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) turns 75 this year, it is hardly surprising that burden sharing — the degree to which allies are financially shouldering the costs of collective security — is once again an issue at the forefront of Washington, D.C. policy discussions. For decades, the issue has hinged on the amount that allies are spending on defense; since 2014, the focus has been on whether allies are spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense and military programs. Now, however, the tune has changed slightly. Congressional frustration is mounting regarding spending on Ukraine and whether U.S. taxpayers should continue to foot their part of the bill — especially when NATO allies have, in the view of many policymakers, failed to meet their own defense-spending commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the stakes in Ukraine for the future of the alliance and global democracy, as well as the enormous utility that NATO has for advancing U.S. interests, Congress is getting perilously close to cutting off its nose to spite its face. Especially since the major metric against which burden sharing is measured — as a percentage of GDP spent on military and defense matters — does not adequately capture all the different ways that allies are spending their resources on capabilities and programs that improve transatlantic security writ large. This discrepancy exists because the 2 percent metric only captures what states are spending on their military capabilities and defense programs. But deterring and defending against a revanchist Russian adversary requires whole-of-government — if not whole-of-society — capabilities and plans that are not presently factored into the way NATO thinks about burden sharing. In other words, an expanded definition of what countries can count as contributions toward transatlantic security is needed since the international security environment is one in which the lines between domestic and foreign policy are being blurred, and defense spending is necessary but not sufficient to meet national security requirements. While the authors do not argue that allied nations should spend less than 2 percent of GDP on their own defense, there should be more flexibility associated with how they spend it and how it is “counted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-burden-sharing-to-responsibility-sharing&quot;&gt;From Burden Sharing to Responsibility Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many take the view that NATO is a military alliance; accounting for broader civilian and whole-of-government activities is, therefore, outside its purview. Yet this perception of the alliance and its responsibilities arguably misreads the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty (Washington Treaty) that founded it in the first place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is often overlooked, but NATO’s collective strength isn’t just in its ability to defend its members from an attack (Article V of the 1949 Washington Treaty) but also in its requirements to ensure members are undertaking necessary domestic activities to prepare for crisis response and, potentially, military action (see Article III of the Washington Treaty). This allows for resilience, something which, in a dynamic world, needs to be more deeply invested in and more comprehensively approached.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article II of the Washington Treaty also establishes that the alliance has a role to play in protecting democracy and promoting economic cooperation. NATO’s adversaries are waging hybrid and political warfare against allies, which ultimately presents a direct Article II challenge. NATO allies should and are investing in whole-of-government responses to such threats; given their criticality of the survival to the alliance overall, such investments ought to be included in calculations of NATO responsibility sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the authors argued for a new “responsibility sharing” framework for NATO spending based upon an expanded view of what counts toward collective security spending:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Allies should spend 4 percent of their GDP on defense and security annually: States should spend a minimum of 2 percent of GDP on defense, though NATO should continue to explore and allow more flexibility in the way those monies are spent nationally, particularly for states that do not have sufficient absorptive capacity to spend 2 percent on their defense capabilities and programs. The balance — between 2 and 4 percent — should be allocated toward activities that are strategically vital to the alliance but are not accounted for in NATO’s methodologies for defense spending, such as peacetime preparedness and resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting such a concept into practice, an analysis of responsibility sharing should include not only direct defense expenditures but also investments in resilience and select adjacent sectors. The question then becomes: what does responsibility sharing look like after applying this broader definition of collective security spending?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;redefining-what-counts&quot;&gt;Redefining What “Counts”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build a more comprehensive picture of responsibility sharing across the NATO alliance, the authors pulled publicly available data on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense spending&lt;/strong&gt; — that is, those monies that were counted toward NATO defense pledges in 2022, including military costs and research and development (R&amp;amp;D).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public order and safety expenditures&lt;/strong&gt; in 2021, including on police, firefighting, judicial systems, and R&amp;amp;D related to public order and safety. These capabilities have traditionally been excluded from burden sharing calculations, as they are thought to “dilute” the focus on needed military spending. Yet they are essential for national resilience in the event of a crisis — and thus critical for the deterrence and defense of the transatlantic community. They, therefore, warrant inclusion in a new responsibility sharing framework.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt; in 2022, including military, financial, and humanitarian aid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The costs of pivoting from Russian energy sources&lt;/strong&gt; such as liquefied natural gas (LNG), oil, and coal — based on bilateral trade data from 2022. Following the invasion of Ukraine, the European Union and NATO members called for and adopted sanctions that significantly reduced trade with Russia. Subsequent sanctions and reduction of trade ensued as allies reoriented away from Russian energy sources. EU and NATO members had to find alternatives from countries such as Norway and have invested in LNG regasification terminals to enable imports from the United States and elsewhere. The European Union also imposed a ban on coal and embargoes on Russian seaborne crude oil and petroleum products, and the Group of Seven (G7) set an oil price cap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are likely other contributions to responsibility sharing that are not captured in this analysis, such as investments in cyber protection of critical national infrastructure, operational risk sharing, rail infrastructure and airport maintenance. These and other data will be incorporated into future CSIS analyses as appropriate and when made available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods-and-data&quot;&gt;Methods and Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a first step to quantify contributions and help policy practitioners move toward responsibility sharing, researchers within the Futures Lab at CSIS collected data to provide a more holistic measurement. The first dataset used was the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid for a market basket of consumer goods and services produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The researchers queried 2021–2023 CPI monthly data, which was then aggregated for yearly averages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the team collected data on defense spending for 2022 from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) military expenditure database hosted by the World Bank; the CPI figures were then used to convert the current U.S. dollar (USD) listed in the dataset to 2022 USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To visualize support to Ukraine, the researchers leveraged the Kiel Institute for the World Economy’s Ukraine Support Tracker. Data pulled included military, financial, and humanitarian aid from 2022, and the 2021 USD figures were converted to 2022 USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To visualize nonmilitary or nondefense expenditures with national security implications, CSIS compiled data from various sources that use the United Nations’ classification of the functions of government (COFOG) standard. This included 2021 general government-spending data from Eurostat, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the UK Office of National Statistics, Statistics Canada, World Bank BOOST platform, and the International Monetary Fund on “public order and safety.” Multiple sources were necessary because no single repository held all NATO members’ expenditure for this COFOG category, which captures “police services; fire-protection services; law courts; prisons; [and] R&amp;amp;D related to public order and safety.” As 2021 was the final year of reporting by most NATO members in Eurostat, all queries from these other sources also looked at just 2021 for consistency. The next step was to convert reported local currencies (the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Albanian lek, Icelandic króna, and Swedish krona) to 2022 USD using exchange rates provided by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and GDP deflators provided by the U.S. Department of Defense to adjust for inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection was then complemented by NATO allies’ energy divestment. To quantify Russian energy divestment by commodity, the team first collected NATO members’ reported imports from Russia between 2021 and 2022 using Harmonized System (HS) codes for traded products. This data, accessed through the UN Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade), reflects the net weight of commodities and trade value in current USD. The HS codes used captured the flow of petroleum and bituminous oils (excluding crude), bituminous coal (not agglomerated), and LNG. The team then converted the current USD reported to 2022 USD, calculated the average price in 2021 by dividing the total value by the net weight imported in 2021, and used the price per unit of weight against the total value in 2022 to control for post-war price shocks. Next, the research team calculated the difference in purchased value between both years to obtain a pre- and post-war comparison illustrating the extent of divestment from Russian energy, aggregating the figures for oil and coal while leaving LNG as a separate category. Finally, the team queried 2022 GDP data from the World Bank, converting current USD to 2022 USD to calculate the expense categories as a share of each country’s GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data pulled on allied spending from these sources presented a reasonably optimistic picture of responsibility sharing across the NATO alliance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least 13 allies are spending over 4 percent of GDP on “responsibility sharing,” (14 including Sweden).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least further 11 countries are spending over 3 percent of GDP on responsibility sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some countries worked to shift away from Russian energy sources. Lithuania, for example, spent roughly 3.21 percent of its GDP as it diversified its energy sector away from Russian imports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of note, 18 NATO allies are reported to be on track to meet the 2 percent defense spending target in 2024, meaning that the defense portion of responsibility sharing is increasing — although not reflected in this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7XhiKZP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 1, at least 13 allies (14 including Sweden) are spending over 4 percent of GDP when counting not only defense spending but also public order and safety expenditures, Ukraine aid, and Russian energy divestment. At least another 11 are spending over 3 percent of GDP on this responsibility sharing. (CSIS was unable to capture public order and safety spending for North Macedonia and Montenegro.) Some countries worked particularly hard to shift away from Russian energy sources, as shown in Figure 2. Lithuania, for example, spent roughly 3.21 percent of its GDP on diversifying its energy sector away from Russian imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lAUVXOk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spotlight-pivoting-from-russian-energy-sources&quot;&gt;Spotlight: Pivoting from Russian Energy Sources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, many European countries chose to move away from Russian energy imports as part of several sanctions packages introduced by the European Union. This choice, while expensive, provided two major strategic advantages. First, such divestment was viewed as a way to impose costs on Moscow for its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Second, Europeans hoped that diversifying national energy sectors and reducing reliance upon Russian sources would remove any strategic leverage Moscow might seek to wield against its neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kBZDIDI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European countries were already looking to find substitutes for Russian pipeline gas following the curtailment of Russian export volumes beginning in 2021 and the closure of several major pipelines. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, these countries have increasingly relied on alternative gas supplies and greater energy efficiency to meet local demand, with LNG from the United States and additional pipeline gas imports from Norway playing a critical role. EU countries have constructed six new regasification terminals since early 2022 to accommodate rising LNG imports, including three in Germany, and more are under construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union also imposed an embargo on Russian seaborne crude oil and petroleum products (exempting some supplies such as those imported via the Druzhba pipeline’s southern arm). These embargoes forced Russia to divert its crude and petroleum products to other markets, giving buyers greater leverage and reducing Russia’s oil revenue. This was shortly followed by an EU ban on coal and, a year later, a G7 oil price cap. As seen in Table 1, Lithuania exemplifies the shift, having slashed Russian oil imports by approximately 80 percent between 2021 and 2022, equating to a substantial 3.05 percent of its 2022 GDP. Finland follows with a 76 percent reduction in oil imports, corresponding to around 0.91 percent of its GDP for the same year. Greece also made significant cuts, with a 76 percent decrease in oil imports, equivalent to around 0.31 percent of its GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, CSIS identified some instances in which European countries increased their energy imports from Russia during this timeframe, suggesting that a more coherent strategic approach to responsibility sharing on collective security is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue increasing defense budgets.&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding the broader national security spending of NATO allies provides a more comprehensive picture of responsibility sharing. But widening the aperture does not mean that states can lessen their spending on defense — quite the opposite. As agreed at the Vilnius NATO summit in 2023, states should spend a minimum of 2 percent of GDP on defense. That said, “NATO should continue to explore and allow more flexibility in the way those monies are spent nationally, particularly for states that do not have sufficient absorptive capacity to spend 2 percent on their defense capabilities and programs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a responsibility sharing data-capture process.&lt;/strong&gt; This CSIS paper uses publicly available data to show what responsibility sharing looks like. It constitutes a rough approximation of what states are doing to share the security burden. Obviously, the responsibility sharing picture would become clearer if and when more granular data is made available. Considerably, more work can be done to flesh out responsibility sharing in such areas as critical infrastructure protection and energy trade flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO should lead the way in building this data picture by establishing a new responsibility sharing reporting process — perhaps during discussions at the upcoming 75th anniversary of the founding of the alliance. Yet there are also risks associated with building such a process. Namely, if done improperly, NATO and its member states might include miscellaneous spending that does not add value or capability to the alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to mitigate this risk, the secretary general and international staff should centrally manage the data collection process and provide a centralized data repository open to the public. To that end, the secretary general should be tasked at the initiation of the tenure with producing a report that articulates nonmilitary risks that have strategic importance to, or impact upon, NATO’s defense capabilities. Annual updates should also be issued by the secretary general’s office. From there, NATO’s international staff should develop a list of the kinds of activities or spending that would count against the target. Much like the defense investment pledge, nations would then report what they are doing to meet the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In designing this process, NATO leaders should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor in temporality.&lt;/strong&gt; NATO must account both for actions taken in the short term to mitigate against immediate threats and for plans and concrete steps taken to prepare for, deter, and mitigate longer-term risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assume strategic shocks.&lt;/strong&gt; Many of the crises that have demanded allied attention rapidly move from more peripheral concerns to the top of the allied agenda. A responsibility sharing framework must, therefore, be routinely updated and have mechanisms for when an issue moves to the top of the strategic agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify nonmilitary investments that have bearing on alliance strategic positioning.&lt;/strong&gt; As noted earlier in regard to NATO’s Article III preparedness requirements, such investments could include those in dual-use logistics and infrastructure to enhance military mobility, societal resistance capabilities (in areas such as hybrid warfare and information operations), and energy independence, to name a few. Some NATO nations pride themselves on having resilient domestic infrastructure to manage shocks, disruptions, and contingencies. These efforts should be applauded but also be shared within NATO as part of the greater capability set needed to enable alliance responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When appropriate, allow states to report spending through other organizations, including the European Union.&lt;/strong&gt; A number of strategically important investments, such as improvements to infrastructure that enhance military mobility, occur through the European Union. But, at the end of the day, member nations and national budgets still form the building blocks for that spending. Such investments, when aligned with NATO strategic priorities, as outlined by the secretary general, should, therefore, be reportable by nations as they show how they are [bolstering responsibility sharing].&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make reports publicly available on security spending.&lt;/strong&gt; Part of the reason the burden sharing debate has become so toxic is many of the measures of what allies are doing and how they are doing it remain shielded from public view. A more holistic assessment of how allies are risk sharing should therefore inform the public discourse on the many ways allies are contributing to the common defense and security of the transatlantic community.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳沛敏：不應以報紙名義發起「一人一信救香港」 惟黎智英堅持進行&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（21日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第30日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。2020年5月，人大公布將在香港實施國安法，陳供稱黎智英擔心會對法治、人權和新聞機構運作有影響。黎在同月開設個人Twitter 帳戶，並要求陳每日提供新聞話題供他發文，陳遂傳送一張人大政協撐國安法立法的照片，並提議：「賣港賊，制裁名單？」另外，黎要求發起「一人一信救香港」行動，惟陳認為以《蘋果》名義去做並不恰當，她曾向黎表達反對意見，但「黎生表現得好堅定要做呢樣嘢」，最終並沒有接受她的意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英吩咐邀請劉慧卿撰文-陳沛敏稱沒有尋找寫手&quot;&gt;黎智英吩咐邀請劉慧卿撰文 陳沛敏稱沒有尋找寫手&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第九天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續圍繞《蘋果日報》英文版的醞釀時期提問。控方展示黎智英於2020年5月13日轉發給陳沛敏的訊息：「偉光，寫英文文章寫得好還有劉慧卿，請邀她寫。謝謝。」控方指這訊息原本是黎傳送給羅，為何後來會轉發給陳？陳表示：「我覺得純粹係畀我知道囉。」被問到有否協助尋找英文版寫手，陳表示印象中她沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;群組訊息曾提及2020年5月在美港人眾籌登廣告，控方展示最終刊登的頭版廣告，可見美國國旗，寫有「在美港人全力撐」、「五大訴求，缺一不可」、「光復香港，時代革命」。陳則指時任動新聞平台總監張志偉負責管理廣告版面，而不是由她負責，張會告訴她不同廣告在實體報紙所需佔的版面，因此新聞排版時會配合。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果新疆再教育營專題曾獲人權新聞&quot;&gt;《蘋果》新疆再教育營專題曾獲人權新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月13日，時任動新聞平台總監張志偉在「English news」群組發送訊息，指《蘋果》靜態組早前做了「囚牢之疆」專題調查活動網站（minisite），獲得「2020年人權新聞獎」之「多媒體（中文）」大獎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「囚牢之疆」是關於什麼，陳表示：「我相信應該係講新疆嗰啲⋯⋯有啲人畀政府拉咗入去，畀政府教化、懲教嗰啲。」控方提醒陳說話時避免以「我相信」作開頭，因為法庭需要知道的是證人對事件是否有認知。陳其後補充：「我理解當地政府拘捕咗一啲少數民族，啫係維吾爾族人士，擺咗去一啲懲教設施度。」不過由於「囚牢之疆」網頁此前已經發布，她閱畢張志偉的訊息後並沒有進入網頁的連結查看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英訊息稱英文版應著重大陸新聞-疫後反中情緒是美國人最需要看&quot;&gt;黎智英訊息稱英文版應著重大陸新聞 疫後反中情緒是「美國人最需要看」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示黎智英於2020年5月13日發送給群組的訊息：「我越想越覺得英文版應該着重大陸新聞，專題和文章花絮等。在疫情肆虐後掀起的反中情緒，這些是美國人最需要看。我們把大陸方面內容質量做到最好尤其重要，訂閱我們的都會是有識之士，對新聞要求比一般人高。我們的目標是提供外國人在南華早報看不到的中國新聞，打破南早在這方面的壟斷。本地新聞專題和評論每天佔十一、二篇，而大陸的十篇八篇，每天總共二十一、二篇加上影片和漫畫花絮便足夠了。」陳沛敏確認《蘋果》英文版後來有執行到黎此項建議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示：「我覺得嗰時黎生係落緊一個指示，英文版要點樣」，所以她其後在群組中回覆黎「收到，謝謝」。被問到陳有否執行黎的指示，陳稱：「其實我冇咩嘢要執行」，因為英文版只限於網站，而她是負責實體報紙，她回覆黎只是想表示知悉相關討論，若果網站之後有適合的中國新聞便會改寫並擺在實體報紙。她形容自己這方面「角色比較被動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英擔心國安法影響法治人權和新聞機構&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英擔心國安法影響法治、人權和新聞機構&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月21日黎智英與陳沛敏之間的 WhatsApp 對話，二人談及國安法將要生效，控方問黎有否向陳提及《蘋果》會如何反應？陳指當時法律條文尚未公布，但黎當然想知道法律內容，擔心會否對法治、人權和新聞機構運作有影響。控方追問，《蘋果》報導國安法新聞時，會採取什麼角度。陳說：「都係擔心會唔會影響法治、人權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，《蘋果》有否在2020年5月至7月期間，即在《國安法》未生效之前舉行過會議。陳稱不肯定有否特地召開會議，還是有在恆常會議處理過相關議題，而她印象中黎智英並沒有出席這些會議。不過她補充，《蘋果》當時「都係重視呢單新聞」，要做好多配套。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英開設個人twitter帳戶後要求陳沛敏每日提供帖文主意&quot;&gt;黎智英開設個人Twitter帳戶後要求陳沛敏每日提供帖文主意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英在2020年5月22日傳送一段語音訊息給陳沛敏：「我依家開咗個 Twitter 呢都幾哄動，都幾哄動吓，你可唔可以每日就住一啲新聞有啲 idea，你每日傳一個 Twitt 我呢，傳一個 sentence 我呢，好唔好啊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，多不多人知道黎開設 Twitter 帳戶？陳表示：「我諗，都幾多人知道。」控方又問黎有否在《蘋果》內部公布開設帳戶，陳則指：「我諗冇正式公布囉」，她亦理解黎僅是以個人名義開設自己的 Twitter 帳戶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏傳送人大政協委員撐國安法合照-提議賣港賊制裁名單&quot;&gt;陳沛敏傳送人大政協委員撐國安法合照 提議「賣港賊，制裁名單？」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2020年5月23日的訊息，陳沛敏向黎智英傳送一張人大政協委員的合照，相中眾人手持「支持國安立法 護航一國兩制」橫額，陳並稱：「Will they be on the list?」，黎問：「What do you mean? Thanks」，陳回覆：「賣港賊，制裁名單？」，黎表示：「I see. Good suggest.」陳續表示：「張相和唐英年的發言 disgusted many Hong Kong people」，黎其後表示：「I’ve already put them on my Twitter: should US government put these people (on) the sanction list?」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，黎應該有將相關字句放在 Twitter，不過「其實我冇乜成日去睇佢嘅 Twitter」。她解釋，黎在語音訊息中要求她找一些新聞熱話，供他在個人 Twitter 發布，「咁我咪應佢要求，將好多網民、好多討論嘅新聞 send 畀佢囉。」控方問「賣港賊」是否陳所形容的熱話，陳確認，並稱：「所以我（在訊息中）話（政協委員相片）令到好多香港人生厭呀咁樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示黎智英同日的 Twitter 帖文，寫有「Should US government put them on the sanction list? #MagnitskyAct」。陳確認黎有採納她的意見，但她補充：「不過我都冇畀過完整句子佢吖」，當時也沒有想過「Magnitsky Act」（馬格尼茨基法）而且她並沒有參與發布相關 Twitter 帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏不同意黎智英以蘋果名義發起一人一信救香港&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：不同意黎智英以《蘋果》名義發起「一人一信救香港」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指《蘋果》於2020年5月24日頭版發起「一人一信救香港」行動，問這是誰的主意。陳指這是黎的主意，因為在登報前一日（5月23日），他突然提出這意念，而陳在接近中午時份才知道同事正著手處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，當天她特地提早回到公司，找黎智英和時任社長張劍虹了解情況，「因為對於呢件事，我覺得⋯⋯我唔係好認同，我認為佢（黎）唔應該以《蘋果日報》嘅名義發起一人一信行動，咁我就覺得唔適當囉。」因此她提早回公司，去「搞清楚係咪真係要咁做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱她曾與黎智英和張劍虹一同討論，「我就表達唔係好適合咁做啦，不過黎生表現得好堅定要做呢樣嘢。我話既然係咁，黎生點解唔用自己嘅名義去做？啫係你可以用你個人名義，喺《蘋果日報》賣頭版廣告，而唔係好似用《蘋果日報》名義去發起一人一信行動。後尾都係冇接受到我意見啦。」陳之後有找張劍虹單獨討論，「我感覺上張生都唔係話好熱衷做呢件事。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎智英如何回應陳的反對意見？陳指：「佢話咁做先有用囉」。控方追問黎想做到什麼？陳表示以她的理解，當時要國安法立法，所以黎想發起「一人一信」，使時任美國總統特朗普關注這件事，從而做一些事去阻止《國安法》，不過黎並沒有詳細交代想特朗普做什麼行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃之鋒網上批評一人一信-黎智英稱縱使身邊有人反對都係要咁做&quot;&gt;黃之鋒網上批評「一人一信」 黎智英稱縱使身邊有人反對「都係要咁做」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又補充，黎決定在5月24日《蘋果》登報之後，「佢就跟住有繼續登，不過唔係A1，而係其他版。」她記得網上有聲音，例如黃之鋒對「一人一信」行動有負評，「啫係唔認同做法，批評黎生嘅做的啦，咁我就 WhatsApp 咗（相關帖文）畀黎生，等佢唔好再做呢件事」，不過「黎生嘅反應係，佢身邊都有人反對呢件事，但佢都係要咁做㗎喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示相關 WhatsApp 對話，陳向黎傳送黃之鋒帖文截圖，並稱「FYI」，黎回覆表示不認同黃的看法，現時已沒有其他方法對付中共，任何事情可以幫助到他們的話都應該去做，他知道李柱銘也不認同行動，但是在危機面前他們不能裝作謹慎和聰明，勇敢是唯一出路：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What he says doesn’t matter. That’s a very different view of looking at US and the matter at hand. I don’t agree with him, whatever we can secure to help us we must use now. I know a lot of people don’t agree with this including Martin, but now is time crisis we can’t pretend to be careful and clever. The only way is to be brave! There’s no other way to deal with CCP now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，她剛才提及黎身邊都有人反對「一人一信」，是否就是指李柱銘。陳確認。控方續問，為何行動仍然登報？陳指：「因為黎生堅持囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英提供外國團體新聞稿-蘋果其後報導-附梁家傑與裴倫德合照&quot;&gt;黎智英提供外國團體新聞稿 《蘋果》其後報導 附梁家傑與裴倫德合照&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，黎智英於2020年6月3日向陳沛敏發送一份「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, IPAC）的新聞稿。《蘋果》於2020年6月5日刊出報導，題為〈斥強權港版國安法踐踏人權 9議會結盟強硬抗中共〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指報導下方有一張前公民黨立法會議員梁家傑與IPAC執行總監裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）的合照。陳表示不記得當時循什麼途徑獲得此照片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英提及天安門母親獲獎新聞-陳沛敏指已見報&quot;&gt;黎智英提及天安門母親獲獎新聞 陳沛敏指已見報&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示2020年6月4日，黎智英向陳沛敏發送4則訊息，關於六四受難者家屬團體「天安門母親」獲頒發「國際婦女勇氣獎」，以及時任國務卿蓬佩奧會見六四倖存者；黎又指蓬佩奧團隊中人希望《蘋果》予以報導，因他們擔心親北京媒體的壟斷導致香港看不到上述新聞。陳則回覆「今日已見報，thanks」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏庭上指，因為當天報紙是在前一天準備的，而黎以為《蘋果》未有報導這幾宗新聞，「但其實我哋有呢幾單新聞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英向陳沛敏傳送共和黨參議員言論-後來在報導被引用&quot;&gt;黎智英向陳沛敏傳送共和黨參議員言論 後來在報導被引用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英曾向陳沛敏傳送共和黨參議員魯比奧（Marco Rubio）的言論：「How we respond to the People’s Republic of China and the Communist Party’s attempt to reshape the globe is the defining foreign policy question of our time. This challenge is much greater than any individual country, administration, or political party, which is why democracies worldwide need to come together as we are doing today.」，並指「看是否需要在文中加上去。謝謝。」陳庭上表示曾把上述訊息轉發給同事處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示2020年6月5日《蘋果》報紙文章〈蓬佩奧與抗爭者「並肩」〉，載有時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧與六四前學運領袖王丹、作家蘇曉康、李蘭菊和李恒青的合照。報導提到：「美國國會及行政部門中國問題委員會昨發表聲明，呼籲中國公佈六四死者及失蹤者人數，允許人民公開討論研究六四事件以及立即無條件釋放政治犯。委員會共同主席麥戈文（James McGovern）聯同另一名共同主席、共和黨籍參議員魯比奧（Marco Rubio）在聲明中指出，他們也與包括香港人、藏人、維族等受壓迫人士站在一起。」陳沛敏確認魯比奧的言論有被引用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏攬炒巴起初因網上討論區言論而成名-2019年起始見報&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：「攬炒巴」起初因網上討論區言論而成名 2019年起始見報&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年6月15日「隔牆有耳」欄目，題為「中共威脅全球民主自由 攬炒巴加入國際聯軍反抗」，並指報導中提及IPAC，問陳這與黎的訊息有否關連。陳指沒有關連。控方又問IPAC是否當時一項熱話，陳指不算是熱話，但是當時IPAC剛剛成立，所以會有較多報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問「攬炒巴」是否一項熱話。陳則指這個人在2019年起才開始見報，因為最初他在網上討論區發言而成名，亦曾發起全球登報計劃，傳媒包括《蘋果》也有報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年6月18日的《蘋果》頭版，題為〈要求放緩清場 免人踩人受傷 社工阻差辦公重囚一年〉，關於社工劉家棟被裁判官蘇文隆裁定阻差辦公罪成，判囚一年。下方配稿題為「蘇官曾指7.21白衣人『勇敢面對』」。陳沛敏指報導角度是「對於判刑有爭議性」，公眾及社工界就認為監禁一年是過重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;高層開國安法應變群組討論記者擔心-惟黎智英非群組成員&quot;&gt;高層開「國安法應變」群組討論記者擔心 惟黎智英非群組成員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，2020年6月22日「國安法應變委員會」WhatsApp 群組成立，而黎智英並不是群組成員之一。陳指群組是由張劍虹提出設立，黎沒有被加入群組，是因為「咁可以自由啲討論」，「因為有咗佢（黎）嘅意見喺度，變咗佢嘅意思會主導晒所有人嘅意見，變咗唔係討論嘅場地。」而且張劍虹有事想與黎商討之前，會先在群組收集大家意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示群組截圖，時任《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光傳送一則訊息：「各位同事，黎生與編採部管理層就記者落 byline 有最終決定」，有4個情況必須寫下記者署名，分別是現場直播、人物專訪、專題報導，以及「自己故」，包括報紙頭版和要聞版面；如有特殊情況，同事需向主管提出。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》總編輯 羅偉光&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏解釋，當時因應《國安法》即將實施，有同事提到記者署名的問題，有些新聞圖片可能含有觸犯《國安法》的內容，如果標註攝影記者的姓名，同事會擔心可能招致法律後果，但另一方面，有部份同事覺得有需要標註他們的姓名。因為同事有這樣的擔心，所以高層有需要處理，「簡單啲嚟講，係令佢哋冇咁擔心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，黎對這方面的討論並不知情，「我當時唔覺得要向黎生報告，同埋就算係要報告，都唔係我去報告囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安法生效當天頭版標題惡法生效-兩制蓋棺-陳沛敏根據黎的意見構思&quot;&gt;國安法生效當天頭版標題〈惡法生效 兩制蓋棺〉 陳沛敏：根據黎的意見構思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月1日國安法生效，《蘋果》當日頭版以〈惡法生效 兩制蓋棺 泛民7.1繼續抗爭〉為標題。控方問這標題是誰的主意。陳則指是時任執行總編輯林文宗和其他構思標題的編輯，「可以話係根據黎生一路對《國安法》的意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問陳何以得知黎對國安法的意見，陳指黎曾經撰寫相關文章，或者在一些公司場合，包括「飯盒會」，黎曾談及《國安法》生效之後，傳媒工作會很困難、一國兩制「玩完」之類的說話。控方問公司場合是否還包括《蘋果》週年慶典，陳表示不肯定，「但嗰時氛氛係比較擔心係咪可以做落去，黎生有就當時士氣去講啲鼓勵說話。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指新聞圖片佔頭版一半-加上標題大字-陳沛敏確認設計為吸引讀者&quot;&gt;官指新聞圖片佔頭版一半 加上標題大字 陳沛敏確認設計為吸引讀者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰留意到，7.1頭版報導並沒有任何記者署名，惟根據「國安法應變委員會」群組發布的指引，頭版必須有記者署名，問陳為何會這樣。陳回答，指引有提及如果同事不願意落記者署名，可以向主管提出，由主管決定。李官問，即是7.1頭版的記者獲主管批准不標註姓名，陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又指，國旗的相片幾乎佔了頭版一半頁面，而文字只佔一半，問陳為何如此做法。陳指「如果係大新聞我哋都會咁設計」，尤其是當新聞圖片「好靚」、有象徵意義，「喺新聞攝影上有啲意象」，便會放大新聞圖片。陳又指，一般人經過報檔看到報紙頭版時，並不會細閱內文，通常都會買完報紙之後才會細閱內文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問，將新聞圖片放大，加上「惡法生效 兩制蓋棺」八個大字，這設計是否吸引讀者注意的方式？陳回答是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, China is intensifying its domestic investments in more advanced chips while also reducing market shares of U.S. firms — and by extension, the revenues U.S. firms need to invest in the next-generation of technology. Over time, this loss of market share could well undermine the competitiveness of U.S. firms in this key industry. The initial volley of restrictions has also revealed limitations of export controls, both because the technology is rapidly changing and because there are gaps in compliance between U.S. companies and those of allies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key conclusion, however, is that there is “no way back” to the global semiconductor ecosystem that existed prior to the pandemic. The U.S. chip supply chain vulnerabilities that the Covid-19 emergency exposed are too alarming to allow a reversion to a business-as-usual supply chain anchored in China. Further, Chinese perceptions of the United States’ reliability as a supplier have understandably changed. It is unlikely that U.S.-China semiconductor-related trade will return to the status quo ante.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States retains a substantial lead in semiconductor design and certain equipment, the most advanced chips are no longer manufactured by U.S.-based firms. This has troubling implications for new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum as well as for the security of supply for key industrial inputs. The Biden administration is to be commended for recognizing the central importance of the industry, its vulnerabilities, and the fact that the industry has been both challenged abroad and neglected at home. As the world enters a period of renewed policy focus on this enabling technology, it is important that the government’s analytic capabilities are improved to inform policy, develop effective mechanisms for allied coordination, and create the government-industry partnerships and long-term investments that will be needed to sustain and grow a more resilient U.S. semiconductor ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-cascade-of-us-export-control-actions&quot;&gt;A Cascade of U.S. Export Control Actions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 7, 2022, the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced dramatic revisions to its export controls on semiconductor technology, intended to foreclose China’s ability to obtain high-end semiconductor chips, technology, manufacturing equipment, and know-how. These restrictions were substantially tightened on October 17, 2023, as the Department of Commerce finalized its proposed U.S. export control rules. The consequences of these restrictions have been far-reaching and their impacts on the semiconductor industry are only now coming into view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restrictions were not, however, an isolated act. They follow in the wake of a 2019 ban by the administration of President Donald Trump on U.S. companies’ delivery of goods and services to Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei without export licenses, effectively cutting off Huawei’s access to key U.S. semiconductors. Reflecting a growing policy consensus, President Joe Biden tightened these restrictions in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Biden administration has further restricted outbound investment. In a major move, on August 9, 2023, President Biden signed an executive order to create a mechanism for restricting outbound investment in the semiconductor, quantum information, and AI sectors in foreign “countries of concern,” a designation that includes China. The Department of Treasury, responding to the executive order on outbound investment, is preparing to establish outbound restrictions on U.S. investments in Chinese AI sectors critical to military, intelligence, surveillance, and cyber-enabled capabilities. Other restrictions are likely to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government cites national security grounds for these restrictions, which are straining relations with the domestic chip industry, U.S. allies, and China. A Department of Commerce official commented in October 2023, “The PRC government is attempting to divert a lot of civilian technologies, particularly in computing, space, AI and communications, into areas of supercomputers in civil-military fusion programs as well as other areas such as surveillance that link with human rights abuses.” The export controls are characterized as a direct response to this unique and far-reaching challenge from what some see as a “near peer” power bent on surpassing the United States by whatever means possible. While facing pushback from U.S. companies and allies, the Biden administration is nonetheless pursuing a policy of limiting China’s access to the most advanced chips and the tools to produce them. The policy is envisioned over a five-year time frame or longer. “It’s a grand vision,” Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo says, “five or six years . . . we will have achieved a lot of that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-central-role-of-us-allies&quot;&gt;The Central Role of U.S. Allies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will U.S. allies follow the United States’ lead in restricting the movement of advanced technologies to China? U.S. allies are in the process of imposing parallel restrictions, perhaps most importantly Dutch and Japanese limits on the export of advanced lithography equipment to China. However, the allied response to date has been characterized as “piecemeal,” and the dissonance between U.S. and allied systems of export control leave substantial holes in the restrictive net envisioned by U.S. policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the success of U.S. controls is likely to depend on the ability to harmonize U.S. restrictions with those of key allies, whose export controls differ substantially from those of the United States, resulting in substantial gaps. In general, U.S. allies have a narrower scope for restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While BIS maintains an “entity list” of foreign companies and other entities barred from procuring designated technologies, Japan does not have a similar list; instead, it has merely designated 23 types of technology that require an export license. Importantly, and in contrast to U.S. controls, Japan does not explicitly designate China as a country of concern.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Netherlands is the source of the most critical production equipment and holds a virtual monopoly. Yet Dutch export controls are limited to a small number of products and do not identify China as a country of concern.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, semiconductor firms in Japan, South Korea, and Europe operate in a different part of the semiconductor ecosystem, have different commercial interests, and do not necessarily share U.S. views of strategic competition. U.S. allies in Europe and Asia have not replicated the extraterritorial application of U.S. controls, which means that if their companies wish to continue trading with China, they may do so by establishing overseas subsidiaries. Moreover, EU decisionmaking is enmeshed in cumbersome procedures. While the European Commission is seeking the authority to impose export controls on key technologies, including semiconductors, progress is likely to be slow, as all 27 member states must approve the grant of such authority. This level of consensus may well prove difficult, especially in a relevant time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-of-controls-on-china&quot;&gt;Impact of Controls on China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the imperfections of U.S. and allied export controls on chips, the current restrictions appear to have a significant impact on China’s semiconductor ecosystem. The Dutch decision to block exports of ASML’s most advanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools should, in principle, foreclose China’s ability to produce advanced chips at the two- and three-nanometer nodes. These advanced chips are needed to sustain China’s AI development. Currently, China simply cannot replicate ASML’s lithography technology: “Producing this kind of complex machinery entirely within China is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future,” industry insiders say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, China’s most advanced maker of semiconductor lithography equipment, the government-run Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment, announced in the summer of 2023 that it would start delivery of lithography equipment capable of manufacturing chips at the 28-nanometer node, “well behind the industry’s cutting-edge of 2 to 3 nanometers.” For the foreseeable future, most Chinese companies will be relegated to the production of higher-node, sometimes called “legacy” chips, though this shift, fueled by very substantial state-backed investments risks posing significant challenges to Western production systems and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, China’s advanced tech development efforts appear to be impaired by the loss of access to high-end U.S. semiconductor devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For example, Nvidia’s leading-edge A100 and H100 chips are among the most critical tools in the AI industry. These devices feature built-in infrastructure for training AI models and algorithms, including computer vision, natural language processing, and conversational AI, and are now banned from export to China. The U.S. government has required Nvidia to stop shipping some of its high-end AI chips to China without licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s highly targeted restrictions on exports of chipmaking tools, in which Japan holds a near or total monopoly, are expected to impede Chinese chipmaking not only in the advanced nodes but in capacity expansions for 14- and legacy 28-nanometer nodes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the overall effect of these restrictions is not yet clear, they appear to be having significant impacts on some Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China’s largest chipmaker, Yangtze Memory Technologies Co (YMTC), was reportedly hit hard by Western restrictions on chipmaking equipment and is laying off 10 percent of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In February 2023 China’s largest semiconductor foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) warned that mass production at its new $7.6 billion plant might be postponed by one to two quarters as a result of “difficulties in securing key equipment” in the wake of Western export controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The restrictions have sparked sharp price increases among mainland consumers of Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card in the wake of Nvidia’s October 19 decision to limit its Chinese distribution of this popular product, which is used by video game and graphics designers. At some Chinese third-party online stores, the 4090 costs between around $5,500 and $6,900, triple the Nvidia price. But one should note that these are essentially consumer, not strategic, impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-chinese-response&quot;&gt;The Chinese Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is responding to U.S. moves to block advanced technology transfers by upping its own game in a number of ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pivot at scale.&lt;/strong&gt; The Chinese government is reportedly “pouring money into advanced chip technology research and development” and supporting a pivot by domestic manufacturers to a focus on higher-node chips with myriad applications across the economy and in new sectors such as electric vehicles (EVs). In 2022 the Chinese government reportedly gave 190 listed chipmakers $1.8 billion in direct subsidies and additional (unknown) loans and equity investments in nonlisted firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massive state support.&lt;/strong&gt; The central government is investing far larger amounts indirectly via state-backed entities such as the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Company, established in September 2014 and known colloquially as the “Big Fund.” Recent investments by state-backed entities in national champion chipmaker YMTC have reportedly totaled $7.1 billion. In January 2023 the Big Fund and an “unnamed ‘Wuxi entity’” announced that they would invest almost $2 billion to fund the construction of a 12-inch wafer fab in Wuxi by Chinese chipmaker Hua Hong to manufacture legacy chips. In October 2023 the Big Fund contributed a $2 billion investment to hold a one-third stake in memory chipmaker Changxin Xinquao.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joint funding by central and regional governments.&lt;/strong&gt; Investments by the central government of China in the semiconductor industry are being augmented by subsidies from provincial and local governments. Thus, in early 2023 the government of Jiangsu Province committed $74 million a year to chip firms to help finance research, equipment purchase, chip design, and packaging. Jiangsu will also provide cash grants to local universities for semiconductor-related programs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circumventing export controls.&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese companies have proved extraordinarily adept at circumventing Western export controls, having “many ways to dodge export controls, such as third-party partners, offshore entities, or other shell companies.” In some cases, “parts are simply snuck across borders,” such as by attaching extra chips to printed circuit boards. A semiconductor supply chain executive observes, “They assume no custom officers will know if there are many more parts on such printed circuit boards [than there should be]. Also, it requires massive efforts to open every box to check.” Another approach is to mark the shipments of precision components as waste parts to get through customs. After these parts enter China, they can be remarked and repackaged. Chinese companies are also creating numerous shell companies faster than the DOC can track them. An executive at one chip equipment maker says, “We found some Chinese companies now quite fancy changing names constantly. Last quarter their name is this one, next quarter it changes to a different name.” These efforts, at least anecdotally, have proven successful. As recent as January 2023, Chinese military and affiliated institutions have purchased Nvidia’s most advanced H100 chips from sources within China in small batches, suggesting an unknown quantity of controlled chips are making their way into China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building stockpiles.&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese chipmakers have been on a shopping spree to acquire Dutch and Japanese semiconductor manufacturing equipment, taking advantage of the long hiatus before those countries’ export controls fully take effect. U.S. exemptions from the controls are also enabling Chinese firms to acquire U.S. chip tools. According to one source, the United States is simply allowing various equipment companies to ship tools with a license. Some observers argue, “The U.S. is granting licenses like they’re candy.” These broad and multivariant exemptions can and will undermine the impact of current and future controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building technological infrastructure.&lt;/strong&gt; China’s Tsinghua University has announced a plan to bypass Western restrictions on lithography machines by building a particle accelerator with a circumference of 100–150 meters. The accelerator’s electron beam is expected to serve as a high-quality light source for on-site chip manufacturing, and the plan is to build a “colossal” factory housing multiple lithography machines arrayed around the particle accelerator. The expectation is that eventually this project will enable China to manufacture two-nanometer chips in high volume.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving new Chinese innovations.&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese entities have announced significant microelectronics innovations since the allied sanctions were imposed. In October 2023 Chinese scientists from Tsinghua University announced the development of the world’s first fully system-integrated memristor chip, with significant applications in AI and autonomous driving. In September 2023 the China Electronics Technology Group (CETG), a major Chinese defense manufacturer, announced it had developed a gallium nitride radar chip with a record power output “using semiconductor technology that is the subject of U.S. sanctions.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making technological progress despite sanctions.&lt;/strong&gt; Huawei has startled industry observers by launching a new smartphone, the Mate 60 Pro, incorporating an allegedly indigenously developed 5G modem, possibly indicating that China enjoys a higher level of technology development capabilities than previously assumed. U.S. commerce secretary Gina Raimondo characterized Huawei’s success as “disturbing.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploiting export control gaps.&lt;/strong&gt; The seven-nanometer chip used in Huawei’s 5G phone was widely reported to have been developed by China’s SMIC, its largest semiconductor foundry, using deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) systems. According to one source, SMIC’s ability to produce the seven-nanometer device was not based on Chinese indigenous innovation but on its ability to acquire the necessary foreign equipment despite U.S. sanctions, reflecting multiple gaps in the Western export control regime: “As long as SMIC has access to advanced deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography technology from ASML and wide access to other critical advanced tools from American vendors, it can produce 7-nm chips at scale.” ASML revealed in its 2022 annual report released in February 2023 that “one of its China-based employees had engaged in ‘unauthorized misappropriation of data relating to proprietary technology’ that may have breached some export controls.” The Dutch newspaper NRC reported that the perpetrator went on to work for Huawei after leaving ASML.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pulling in talent.&lt;/strong&gt; China has quietly revived the Thousand Talents Plan (TTP), a program designed to attract foreign scientific and technology experts, which was terminated in 2018 in the wake of U.S. investigations. The new program operates under a different name, Qiming, and seeks to recruit foreign and overseas Chinese PhD-level experts from “sensitive” and “classified” sectors including semiconductors. The new program features incentives such as subsidized housing and signing bonuses ranging from $420,000 to $700,000, essentially providing in a short time frame the equivalent of an end-of-career salary for middle-aged engineers well versed in the critical tacit knowledge needed for advanced semiconductor production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significantly, China is also taking measures to disrupt the U.S. semiconductor industry and signaling what it could do if pressed further by Western technology restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cutting market share of Western firms.&lt;/strong&gt; In May 2023, China declared that U.S. memory chipmaker Micron Technology had “failed its security review” and barred Chinese operators of key domestic infrastructure from purchasing Micron products.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restricting critical materials.&lt;/strong&gt; In July 2023, China imposed licensing requirements on exports of the rare-earth metals gallium and germanium as well as several compounds made from those metals, which are key materials in semiconductor manufacturing. These requirements could easily become a mechanism to reduce access to these materials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing design-outs.&lt;/strong&gt; China is continuing its long-standing efforts to induce domestic chip consumers to exclude U.S. chips and chip designs in their purchasing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking foreign industry growth.&lt;/strong&gt; China is impeding U.S. semiconductor mergers and acquisitions by withholding regulatory approvals. In August 2023, Intel and Israeli contract chipmaker Tower Semiconductor scrapped a $5.4 billion deal pursuant to which Intel would acquire Tower after failure to gain approval from Chinese regulatory authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limits-of-export-controls&quot;&gt;Limits of Export Controls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of these actions by China, some critics suggest U.S. restrictions could be rolled back. But, as noted, it seems much more probable that there is no way back to the global semiconductor ecosystem that existed prior to the pandemic. The U.S. chip supply chain vulnerabilities revealed by the Covid-19 emergency are too alarming to allow reversion to a business-as-usual supply chain anchored in China. Moreover, Chinese perceptions of the United States’ reliability as a supplier have understandably changed. It is unlikely either side will be willing, or allowed, to return fully to the previous supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realignment of microelectronics supply chains for resilience and security, instead of purely for efficiency, will inevitably modify, and perhaps damage, existing innovation networks and complicate the operations of semiconductor companies. This is already happening: for example, the large chip fabrication plants Western firms have established in China with tens of billions of dollars in investment are already being affected by new export controls and are now hostage to the vagaries of the U.S.-China chip rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of these developments on revenue for some U.S. equipment companies is significant, with the attendant risk of long-term impacts on the research and development (R&amp;amp;D) that underpins their competitive position. Similarly, China is reducing access to its domestic market for some U.S. semiconductor companies, which will negatively impact the ability of these U.S. companies to invest in new facilities and equipment. The hard truth is that U.S. companies are competing under a new set of circumstances with what is, for many, their largest customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the notion that the United States and its allies can significantly slow Chinese capabilities in microelectronics is a hypothesis — nothing more — and the events of 2022 suggest Chinese capacities are far from static. They will need to be continuously reassessed in light of ongoing indigenous developments. China’s use of institutional “technology extractors” (such as local content requirements, joint ventures, and technology-for-market-access deals) to acquire foreign technologies is extremely skillful and these practices have continued to expand since the country’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, notwithstanding its commitments in its protocol of accession and Western export controls. According to one estimate, in the first decade after accession, the number of identifiable technology extractors jumped from 53 to 339, involving over 100 industrial sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this background, China has proved to be skilled at acquiring foreign semiconductor technology, chips, and manufacturing equipment, including proscribed items, export controls notwithstanding. The slow implementation of the most recent round of allied export controls has enabled China to acquire Western equipment subject to controls — perhaps the most dramatic manifestation of which was SMIC’s ability to secure European and U.S. equipment to manufacture chips for Huawei’s new smartphone. Highly regarded former TSMC vice president Burn J. Lin said in October 2023 that SMIC should be able to advance to manufacturing chips at the five-nanometer node using the same equipment. While yields may be lower and costs higher than with advanced Western equipment, firms backed by low-cost capital and with preferential access to national markets, can and likely will remain formidable competitors in global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, China has proved to be unable to develop significant microelectronics innovations on its own, which quite possibly remains the case today. At the same time, the recent developments noted above suggest this dynamic may be changing, aided by leaky controls and systemic theft. In any case, complacency regarding the limits of Chinese capabilities may not be justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-dilemma-autonomy-versus-cooperation&quot;&gt;China’s Dilemma: Autonomy versus Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Chinese policymakers viewed continuous acquisition of foreign chip technology as a sine qua non for the development of its own semiconductor industry. Thus, in 2000, then-minister of information industry Hu Qili noted that South Korea’s three major semiconductor enterprises&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;built up their fortunes on their cooperation with the United States and Japan. . . . If we just engage in development behind closed doors, totally rely on ourselves in the aspects of talented people, funds, and technologies, and produce products only to serve and support ourselves, it is absolutely impossible to establish ourselves in the intense international competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, China has sought to draw in foreign firms with advanced technology to complement its own efforts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acquiring foreign technology.&lt;/strong&gt; China’s massive semiconductor industry promotional effort launched in 2014 focused on acquiring foreign companies, purchasing foreign technology, and recruiting foreign semiconductor talent. A Taiwanese observer commented in 2015,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities . . . aim to create world-leading semiconductor firms in terms of technology. But the country’s semiconductor firms are mostly lagging behind their international competitors technology-wise, and the hard reality is that it would be very difficult for China to catch-up through its own research and development efforts. Buying existing firms with advanced technology instead of developing its own seems a quick fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some progress was made, but the new CFIUS controls and similar measures among like-minded states have virtually closed this option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow progress on filling the equipment gap.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite these sustained national efforts, China’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry is severely underdeveloped, and the country’s abiding dependency on foreign equipment represents a major long-term vulnerability highlighted by the newly tightened Western export controls. The national chip equipment localization rate was not even at 8 percent as of 2021. A former vice president of the National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund commented in 2018, “Chinese equipment and materials companies are so backward that it is even difficult to find proper investment targets.” Despite the urgency of upgrading Chinese chip equipment capabilities, the national semiconductor investment funds have committed only about 4 percent of their total semiconductor investments to the equipment sector, perhaps because policymakers assume China can readily acquire foreign equipment despite Western controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it is prudent to consider the real possibility that the new Western controls will drive Chinese policymakers and businesses to undertake truly indigenous innovation in microelectronics and that such efforts could lead to technological breakthroughs that could transform the global chip industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, China’s government remains determined to catch up with the West in microelectronics. The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party report, released soon after the U.S. announcement of tightened export controls in October 2022, identifies the trade conflict with the United States as the “economic main battlefield” and promises “high-level technology self-strength and self-independence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investments and “design out.”&lt;/strong&gt; In 2023 the Chinese government launched a new 300 billion yuan ($41 billion) fund for investments in the semiconductor industry on the heels of 200 billion yuan ($27 billion) in 2019. Investments by the central government are being augmented by provincial and municipal governments. The city of Guangzhou committed over $21 billion in 2023 to enable Chinese chip consumers to eliminate foreign devices from their systems in favor of domestic chips. Chipmakers who operate at more advanced nodes than 28 nanometers qualify for a 10-year tax exemption pursuant to the State Council’s “Policies to Promote the High-Quality Development of the Integrated Circuit and the Software Industry in the New Period.” Importantly, these sums dwarf the resources of the “chips acts” in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 2025 guidance and growing capabilities.&lt;/strong&gt; The government has established an aggressive road map for the semiconductor industry once again, this time pursuant to its “Made in China 2025” guidance. Reflecting long-term government objectives for greater autonomy in semiconductors, the plan envisions 80 percent localization of Chinese consumption of chips by 2030 (the ratio was about 24 percent in 2020). Many of these targets have not been achieved in the past and may in part be aspirational. Nonetheless, the government may be expected to allocate major resources to at least work toward this target, and that commitment of resources and related trade measures may well negatively affect the market shares of U.S. producers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generating-new-asymmetrical-capabilities&quot;&gt;Generating New Asymmetrical Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western export controls have reportedly resulted in pushback by listed Chinese companies, “prompting them to increase their investment in R&amp;amp;D to enhance their technological innovation capabilities.” The growing innovative capability of Chinese companies has recently been acknowledged by the Boston Consulting Group, whose annual roster of the top 50 innovating companies in the world now includes Chinese firms such as Alibaba, Lenovo, Huawei, Xiaomi, JD.com, and Tencent. China’s leading chip foundry, SMIC, has already demonstrated what is achievable, having narrowed the gap with world-leading semiconductor firms from trailing several generations behind in 2000 to several years behind at present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chiplet innovation.&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese enterprises are also utilizing chiplet technologies originally acquired from the United States to package groups of small semiconductors — sometimes no larger than a grain of sand — into powerful integrated units capable of wide-ranging applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging the legacy gap.&lt;/strong&gt; While it often seems underappreciated in U.S. policy discussions, “Legacy chips are at least as critical as advanced chips both in terms of economic importance and national security.” Chinese firms already excel at the efficient production of these higher-node chips, which account for most of global semiconductor consumption, and Chinese chipmakers may be expected to innovate with respect to these chips to enhance their durability, decrease power consumption, and reduce costs without further access to Western technology. China has dramatically increased its investments in legacy chipmaking since the announcement of U.S. export controls in 2022. According to some estimates, China may build more legacy chip fabrication plants in the next few years than the rest of the world combined.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absorbing efficiency trade-offs.&lt;/strong&gt; A U.S. semiconductor equipment engineer notes,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not entirely impossible to use less-advanced tools to make more advanced chips. It’s very difficult to have a clear cutoff on what machine can do what . . . The differences very often depend on how precise and how uniformly the work they could perform, and what are the throughputs, or efficiency, of those tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But efficiency is essentially a U.S. criterion. A fundamental difference between U.S. and Chinese chip manufactures is that U.S. manufacturers need to — indeed must — generate profits, usually on a quarterly basis. Chinese manufactures, with heavy and ongoing state support, are not constrained in the same manner. Companies that can compete without regard for losses are formidable competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the recent innovative developments and workarounds in China’s chip ecosystem are concerning. The Biden administration has embraced the term “small yard, high fence” to explain its technology controls affecting China — in other words, the universe of restricted technologies will be comparatively small, but the restrictions will be extremely stringent. But realizing this objective presents a formidable challenge. China’s “yard” of advanced chip technologies with national security implications is expanding rapidly in a sprawling fashion — in multiple, often poorly understood directions. Moreover, the Western “fence” is currently full of holes, not least because of the lack of full congruence between U.S. and allied export control regimes. For these reasons, the concept of a “small yard, high fence” must be regarded as aspirational and certainly not a near-term reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us-faces-its-own-challenges&quot;&gt;The U.S. Faces Its Own Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the difficulties of controlling high-tech exports to China, the U.S. innovation system itself is vulnerable. Additional policy measures and investments are needed in many areas, not least in the semiconductor space. Competing with China will require substantial and sustained investments, not always a strong point for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-need-for-sectoral-expertise-in-policymaking&quot;&gt;The Need for Sectoral Expertise in Policymaking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One glaring vulnerability in the chip sector is the paucity of relevant government expertise in U.S. and allied countries with respect to both the commercial and defense-related aspects of particular semiconductor technologies. The result is that “relevant agencies often lack the expertise to assess exporters’ requests for a licence to sell products abroad.” BIS has under 600 employees and an annual budget of about $200 million, resources that are simply inadequate to address the agency’s many responsibilities. Absent an increase in the quality and depth of expertise to inform policy decisions, allied controls risk being ineffective. Recruitment of qualified staff with the necessary remuneration levels is essential. Direct and recent experience is critical for informed decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-need-for-informed-advisory-committees&quot;&gt;The Need for Informed Advisory Committees&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has in the past made episodic efforts to establish advisory bodies to guide semiconductor industry policymaking, and U.S. departments, agencies, and National Laboratories possess substantial internal expertise on specific themes. However, there is no central standing body of relevant expertise and data gathering and analytic capability to advise the Department of Defense or the Department of Commerce in real time with respect to what are often highly technical U.S. policy decisions on export licensing with wide-ranging implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States established and funded the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors in 1988 to advise the government on chip policy, but it lacked a secretariat and gradually faded into irrelevance, ceasing operations in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) releases periodic reports on high-level policies in the semiconductor industry but does not represent a source of ongoing ground-level technical advice with respect to complex and frequently arcane semiconductor technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Federal departments, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Laboratories possess extensive expertise in specific aspects of semiconductor technology, but it is difficult for the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense to access this knowledge in a comprehensive manner to assess export licensing requests in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a positive precedent, however. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Sematech research consortium convened large numbers of scientists and engineers from industry, government laboratories, and academia to develop a technology road map for the semiconductor industry. This ad hoc effort succeeded beyond all expectations and was carried forward in Sematech’s organic technical advisory bodies. While successful, this advisory body eventually became something of a one-off effort after the withdrawal of government support for Sematech and did not result in establishing a permanent advisory body that could provide technical semiconductor expertise to the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the working groups from industry, government, and academia that flourished under Sematech’s auspices remain a possible model or starting point for an effective U.S. chip advisory brain trust. Importantly, the proposed National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC) has a major opportunity to fill this gap on an ongoing basis. The potential value of the NSTC will be its ability to provide long-term guidance based on close consultation with industry on how the needs of the industry can intersect with national security needs. Providing a long-term view with frequent level setting by advisory groups will be essential to its success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;complexity-and-cooperation&quot;&gt;Complexity and Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the United States and its allies are determined to strengthen the durability and security of semiconductor supply chains by separating them from China, it is important to recognize that those chains are an enigma, even to companies embedded within them and to the end users they serve. The complexity is daunting. Chip supply chains often involve tens of thousands of companies in network arrangements that are many layers deep and constantly changing. Understanding them is difficult because most entities in this network want to keep the identity of their suppliers confidential. This means an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that sources directly from several hundred equipment and materials vendors may have no idea who supplies those vendors or in what country these suppliers — and their suppliers in turn — are located. Some analysis suggests many of these vendors are East Asian. This complexity and opacity mean it is very hard to target policies to reward or isolate particular actors within this system. Moreover, policy actions are likely to have unexpected and often counter-intentional outcomes, potentially harming U.S. commercial and national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mapping-supply-chains&quot;&gt;Mapping Supply Chains&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the objective is to facilitate disentanglement of U.S. chip supply chains from China (assuming that is possible and desirable), it would be imperative to develop public-private partnerships between U.S. government and industry to map out supply chains and develop ways to ascertain from where key inputs are coming. Bringing industry together to discuss supply chains will be — to use a modest word — difficult. To paraphrase a Chinese saying, extracting this information from the semiconductor industry will be “like pulling the teeth from the mouth of a tiger.” Even so, a rudimentary mapping may help shed some light. Sematech’s working groups, noted above, are a potential model and starting point, as the oral histories of some participants suggest. This model may well be applicable to the NSTC, not least as a means of staying close to industry concerns and needs as well as a primary source of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-arrangements-for-harmonization&quot;&gt;New Arrangements for Harmonization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to harmonization of U.S. chip export controls with those of allies and strategic partners, current modalities are inadequate. The Wassenaar Arrangement is a voluntary multilateral export control regime with 42 member countries that seeks to ensure international stability by promoting transparency and responsibility with respect to transfers of conventional weapons and dual-use products and technologies. Wassenaar was created in 1996 to succeed the Cold War-era Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), a more stringent control regime. Exports of some chip technologies to China by signatories are already restricted pursuant to Wassenaar commitments. However, any attempt to utilize Wassenaar to coordinate enhanced allied semiconductor export controls will necessarily be complicated, perhaps fatally, by the fact that Russia is a Wassenaar member and will likely oppose any tightening of chip export controls directed at China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reality suggests the need for new arrangements, perhaps informal but nonetheless effective, on the part of like-minded states. U.S. policymakers must understand that consultations and cooperation with allies and industry will be absolutely essential to the success of U.S. policy in this domain. That means close coordination on policy while genuinely taking into account partners’ perspectives and needs. Clearly articulating specific objectives and consulting with industry on the effectiveness of proposed measures is more important than announcements of new “controls.” The semiconductor space is not one for unrestrained unilateral action. Close cooperation, however challenging, is the path to success.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英冀英文版「打國際線」、若政府打壓或遭譴責甚至制裁&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N4TAStB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（20日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第29日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。庭上提及《蘋果》高層於2020年5月開始籌備英文版，陳沛敏憶述黎智英曾提及「如果有美國政治人物訂閱，咁就好喇」，希望英文版能為《蘋果》起到保護作用，當《蘋果》遭受打壓，國際社會都會提供支持，從而向政府施壓，「可能言論上會有譴責，或者採取一啲行動去制裁啦。」群組訊息亦顯示，黎曾表示英文版只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞，做具有深度的報導，「貴精不貴多」；黎又指不需要向外國讀者呈現香港不同政治陣營的觀點，只需要集中在「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」、「黃營的普遍觀點」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方馮睎乾專欄提蘋果要做國際文宣線以增值&quot;&gt;控方：馮睎乾專欄提《蘋果》要做「國際文宣線」以「增值」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第八天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英於2020年5月10日設立群組「English news」，而陳沛敏是群組成員之一。陳確認，並指創立群組之前，黎曾經口頭上講過考慮推行英文新聞，但是沒有詳細說明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/x4QIy4o.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示群組訊息，黎稱：「今日馮睎乾提議出英譯新聞電子版諗得過，反正現在翻譯網站翻譯成本低而快。」控方問陳對馮睎乾文章內容有否印象，陳指大概記得馮在專欄文章中指英文新聞只有《南華早報》，而《蘋果日報》都可以做到英文新聞，以「打破當時得一間英文報紙嘅壟斷」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示馮睎乾於2020年5月10日的專欄文章《不撐蘋果的100萬人》，當中一段提到：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「蘋果救亡似乎只有兩個方向：一是增加訂閱量，吸納那100萬個潛在客戶，二是提供收費較高的訂閱選項，讓某些（不是一刀切加價）現有客戶多付點錢。但無論哪個方向，前提都是蘋果必須『增值』。根據我的網上觀察，以及讀者要求我反映的意見，『增值』主要有兩大方面：一是八卦式公義，二是國際文宣線。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏確認蘋果英文版方向是國際文宣線-黎智英冀美國政治人物訂閱&quot;&gt;陳沛敏確認《蘋果》英文版方向是「國際文宣線」 黎智英冀美國政治人物訂閱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，「國際文宣線」是否就是《蘋果》英文新聞的目標？陳回答：「係呢個方向，啫係為咗吸引國際關注香港發生咩事」，在她記憶中，黎曾提及這樣會為《蘋果》起到保護作用，若果國際社會有《蘋果》英文版的讀者，當《蘋果》遭受打壓，國際社會都會提供支持。被問到《蘋果》英文版有否特定國家對象，陳指「我諗譬如美國啦」，黎亦有提及過：「如果有美國政治人物訂閱，咁就好喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，高層一開始討論英文版做法時，她關心的是會否需要使用數頁實體報紙來刊登英文文章，但後來她理解黎似乎認為不需要印在報紙。以陳的理解，因為實體報紙只限於香港本地發行，平均每日約有6至7萬份，很難運送至外國發行，所以黎認為英文版不需要牽涉實體報紙，只需使用《蘋果》網站，可能是揀選一些中文文章來翻譯成英文，之後刊登在網站。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，黎智英經常跟前社長張劍虹表達想揀選哪一類文章來翻譯，同事便會按照張的指示去揀選文章。被問到何以得知黎和張之間有就這方面溝通，陳指有時在群組看到相關訊息，張有時亦會轉達黎的說話，有時跟同事之間食飯，「吐苦水嘅時候又會講吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英冀英文版能做到打國際線效果&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英冀英文版能做到「打國際線」效果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示時任動新聞平台總監張志偉向群組發送的訊息：「老闆，張生，如是要外國讀者主動訂閱，我們英文版的 newsletter，即我們要做有效的宣傳，reach 到這班讀者，故我們要想好怎宣傳這事。而我們最終目標是打國際線，我建議我們可考慮在美、英主流報章，如 New York Times、Washington Post、英國金融時報等實體報章和網站落廣告，宣傳我們將會做 newsletter 訂閱，令外國讀者知道這事，從而 subscribe 我們 newsletter，就像連登仔在外國報章登廣告打國際線宣傳一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，「打國際線」是否設立英文版的「最終目標」？陳則指：「我理解黎生係想做到呢個效果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示時任《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光的訊息，他向群組提議，可邀請一些香港年輕人撰寫英文評論，例如曾捲入「世衞風波」的前香港電台記者 Yvonne Tong、身處美國的梁繼平，以及一些打「國際線戰線」的學生和「手足」，「讓這些香港年輕面孔面向世界，直接說香港情況。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏mark-simon較熟悉外國媒體-可協助宣傳英文版&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：Mark Simon較熟悉外國媒體 可協助宣傳英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英又在群組中提及：「我會叫 Mark 先搞好美國方面發放這消息的方法和渠道。」陳沛敏解釋，她估計黎的私人助理 Mark Simon 對外國媒體比較熟悉，因此他可以告訴外國媒體《蘋果》會籌辦英文版，以作宣傳。她表示，有時見到 Mark Simon 接受外國媒體採訪，「由佢去代表黎生回應一啲關於黎生或黎生業務嘅嘢」，所以印象中 Mark Simon 較熟悉外國媒體。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏在群組傳送訊息：「除了翻譯，可否請人直接寫關於香港問題的英文評論。」陳在庭上解釋，她當時認為，既然要出錢聘請人翻譯文章，為何不邀請一些作者以英文撰寫文章。再者，她認為她所負責的實體報紙，讀者對象應該是香港本地人士，但如果英文版的對象是外國讀者的話，黎智英和張劍虹可以考慮為外國讀者度身訂造（tailor-made）而去撰寫一些文章，所以她不認為實體報紙要遷就外國的讀者，包括國際社會、美國公眾和政界人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，後來黎在群組內表示要做多一些中國新聞，因此有負責中國新聞的同事加入群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英曾向mark-simon-表示想彭斯訂閱蘋果英文版&quot;&gt;黎智英曾向Mark Simon 表示想彭斯訂閱《蘋果》英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英於2020年5月10日向Mark Simon傳送訊息：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Mark, Imaging if we can get Mike Pence to subscribe to Apple Daily app! The publicity and respect it command would arouse much support for us. I know it’s almost impossible to pull it off. But can try? Thanks Jimmy”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏解釋，黎認為若果時任美國副總統彭斯都是《蘋果》英文版的讀者的話，會令英文版的知名度提高，「咁喺美國社會都會有好多人支持，以我嘅理解。」若果政府打壓《蘋果》的話，國際社會都會支持《蘋果》，從而向政府施壓，「可能言論上會有譴責，或者採取一啲行動去制裁啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英訊息稱英文版只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞&quot;&gt;黎智英訊息稱英文版只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英在群組中稱，他們不需要報導所有新聞，只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞，做具有深度的報導：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t news (need) all news, only those big enough for foreigners to be interested. That may not be an everyday item. Yes, in depth good quality items. Again the motto is 貴精不貴多！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，黎所指外國人感興趣的大新聞是什麼意思。陳則認為是一些關於香港社會運動的新聞，不過當時社會運動已經沉寂，她記得後來黎有講過要多報導中國新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ejFGmHZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英訊息稱尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版即是尋求他們的支持&quot;&gt;黎智英訊息稱尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版即是尋求他們的支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英其後繼續在群組發送訊息，指尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版即是尋求他們的支持：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“By enlisting foreign leaders to subscribe to us is enlisting their support. They of course understand it and that’s why they would do it. Now is a good time to appeal to them when the English version is launched.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳確認，尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版是其中一個目標，除了外國政治人物之外，黎也希望外國的公眾人士也能訂閱《蘋果》英文版。她理解若果外國政治人物訂閱，會是一種表態，以示支持《蘋果》和黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指不需平衡報導不同陣營觀點-只需報導泛黃觀點&quot;&gt;黎智英指不需平衡報導不同陣營觀點 只需報導泛黃觀點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在群組中表示，不需要向外國讀者呈現不同陣營的觀點，只需要集中在「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」、「黃營的普遍觀點」：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When we choose writers we don’t have to think about giving foreigners a balanced view of what happens here of every different colors, we only concentrate in our Apple Daily HK view, a general view of the yellow side. In choosing further writers we need not choose Weijian Shan, who’s a friend of mine and a very popular writer about China in the west. But his view is all China on the positive side we don’t need. We are not trying to strike a balance but the point of view of the people on the side of protecting HK. This is the voice the world wants to know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問何謂「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」，陳回答指，根據黎的演譯，就是「偏黃陣營的觀點」。控方續問，《蘋果》有否實行到黎所說的集中在「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」，陳表示：「我相信有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問《蘋果》是否實行到黎所說不需要平衡報導，陳表示：「似乎係囉。」控方追問，《蘋果》英文版報導中央政府新聞時，會採取什麼角度，陳則指：「會係對中國比較批判啲嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英想英文版報導中美關係中國與國際之間互動&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英想英文版報導中美關係、中國與國際之間互動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，後來前《蘋果》主筆馮偉光被選做英文版的總編輯，應該是由他按照黎智英的準則去揀選文章來翻譯成英文。相關準則包括著重有關中國的新聞，或者「一啲佢（黎）覺得外國讀者會關注，啫唔係咁香港本地嘅嘢囉」，至於文章角度，「我諗都係有批判性。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》主筆 馮偉光，筆名「盧峯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到有什麼「唔係咁香港本地」的新聞例子，陳舉例指當年《蘋果》大篇幅報導沙中線醜聞，雖然獲得獎項，但是這不是黎認為能夠吸引國際關注的新聞。她理解黎想英文版報導中美關係、中國與國際之間互動，以及牽引到國際社會要關心的議題，而且正如黎早前提及要報導「偏黃」觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏蘋果比較支持和諒解示威者的處境-因普選訴求符合黎智英取態&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：《蘋果》比較支持和諒解示威者的處境 因普選訴求符合黎智英取態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示前動新聞平台總監張志偉的訊息：「老闆，張生，我想有一方法去打國際線，出我們的蘋果英文版內容，就是利用現成的 patreon 平台，代替我們自己去 send 出 newsletter」，張又指：「因我們今次打國際線，目的是發揮香港《蘋果日報》在外國的影響力和話語權，訂閱人頭和收入同樣重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，《蘋果》只是一份報紙，為何會涉及「打國際線」？陳則認為張志偉僅使用了社運人士所使用的字眼，但她不能代張解讀原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問《蘋果》有否參與「打國際線」，若有的話，會是以什麼形式參與。陳表示：「我諗我唔會用『參與』」，不過當時《蘋果》的態度「會係比較支持和諒解示威者的處境，立場係比較支持佢哋嘅訴求」，例如有訴求提到普選，而這符合黎一向支持民主的取態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問為何《蘋果》比較支持示威者。陳指，除了上述提及示威者部份訴求符合黎的立場之外，在七一佔領立法會事件之後，黎想《蘋果》報導示威者心聲，「佢嗰時都直接講個動機係運動可以持續落去，我估係以咁嘅方式去支持？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當示威者談及「國際線」時，意思是想國際人士關注香港情況，若果得到外國支持，運動會有較大成功機會，「如果佢哋（示威者）受到鎮壓，國際社會會出聲呀咁。」她理解這種「國際支持」，與黎開頭籌辦英文版時，提及想得到外國的支持和得到保護，「我理解個邏輯係一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英不贊成用patreon-並指美國政治人物訂閱對政治庇護更重要&quot;&gt;黎智英不贊成用Patreon 並指美國政治人物訂閱對政治庇護更重要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月12日的群組訊息，黎智英回應張志偉的 Patreon 提議，稱：「Patreon 的問題是與蘋果日報隔離，我們主要目的是外國人撐蘋果日報，尤其美國政治人物訂閱蘋果對我們的政治庇護更重要，我仍然認為英文版有需要設在我們 app 內。而設 app 內時間不用太久。等回來我處談談。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏確認記憶中《蘋果》最終沒有使用 Patreon 來發布英文版文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英提議翻譯桑普林本利和李兆富文章&quot;&gt;黎智英提議翻譯桑普、林本利和李兆富文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前社長張劍虹曾在群組中表示：「林本利我們可以翻譯他的社評」、「楊社長介紹 Steve Vines、Michael Chugani 和一個叫 Albert Wun 的美籍華人」，其後黎智英表示：「以上可加桑普、林本利和 Simon Lee。Mark Simon and Mark Clifford 也認識一些本地住寫英文的 KOL 給我們寫。每天平均有兩篇英文稿就差不多了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏表示記得 Steve Vines 曾在英文報紙工作過，亦有寫過一些評論文章；Michael Chugani（禇簡寧）亦有在英文報紙工作過，其後在電台擔任主持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及桑普文章的角度，陳指「都係對政府比較有批判性」。林本利則是經濟學家，比較多寫經濟分析。至於 Simon Lee 即是李兆富，陳形容他「好崇尚市場經濟，反對政府干預，覺得要由私人市場去做」，即是崇尚「大市場，小政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏憶述被捕後-同事擔心公司會否倒閉或更多人被捕&quot;&gt;陳沛敏憶述被捕後 同事擔心公司會否倒閉或更多人被捕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎訊息中提及的 Mark Clifford 是壹傳媒集團的非執行董事。陳確認，但她表示當時並未留意 Mark Clifford。她憶述，當年一些董事被警方拘捕之後，會計部很徬徨，如果他們不獲准保釋，便未能簽署支票出稿費，後來公司找黎智英和張劍虹委任她自己和羅偉光，「到時有咩事都可以簽支票」，但陳被委任之後，記憶中董事局便沒有再開過會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，她不是因為獲委任為董事而知道 Mark Clifford 這個人，而是因為在報紙上看到宣傳黎智英 Live Chat 節目的全版廣告，當中顯示 Mark Clifford 會出席節目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳略顯激動地提到，最深印象是她在2021年6月17日被捕之後，獲得警方擔保出來時，因為公司財產被凍結，同事都擔心公司會否倒閉，若果倒閉會否賠償到欠薪和遣散費，或者擔心會否再有其他同事被捕。而她當時已向公司辭職，「我係咪可以代表同事問董事局，《蘋果日報》係咪應該結束呢？」陳表示：「我嘅意見係要結束啦」，因為當有同事問她「我哋繼續做落去，會唔會畀人拉？當同事咁問我，我做唔到呢個擔保」，因要詢問董事局。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官此時打斷，指這是後來發生的事件，希望按目前時序來作供，待稍後談到2021年6月時才詳細交代。陳回應，她交代上述事件，目的是想講「去到2021年嗰個位，我先知道 Mark Clifford。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏馮偉光曾做英語媒體-是主理英文版適合人選&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：馮偉光曾做英語媒體 是主理英文版適合人選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示群組訊息，黎智英表示：「我想 English news 我們需要一個人主理，例如挖大陸任志強等先進人士寫的文章翻譯，或將『方方日記』的精髓每天翻譯一小段作為花絮等，不斷為英文版構思些做法令其姿態生動是必須的。劍虹、沛敏和偉光請你們商量選一個人出來主理。這人可以是外面的人，總之對大陸和本港熟悉和英文好，一般學識水平高便可。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏指，英文版最後由馮偉光主理，因他長期替《蘋果》撰寫社論，知道《蘋果》的風格，又有在英語媒體工作的經驗，所以是適合的人選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏憶述黎智英稱當蘋果英文版與南早不同便能引人訂閱&quot;&gt;陳沛敏憶述黎智英稱當《蘋果》英文版與《南早》不同便能引人訂閱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指訊息紀錄顯示，陳在2020年5月13日收到一條語音訊息，而她其後回覆「收到，已聽」。陳確認該語音訊息是一次會議的錄音，由於她沒有出席該次會議，所以同事事後傳送會議錄音給她。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 6 and 7 February, the UK and France launched the Pall Mall Process (PMP), a dialogue dedicated to tackling the proliferation and irresponsible use of commercial cyber intrusion capabilities. The initiative brought together government representatives and stakeholders from different sectors for the first day of discussions. It also marked the launch of a multi-stakeholder declaration on the topic – the “Pall Mall Declaration” – which, among other things, proposes an initial list of principles that could guide future work on the topic (accountability, precision, oversight and transparency), as well as working definitions that could support a shared vocabulary to address different types of services and technologies. What is more, both governments have already announced that the PMP will formally reconvene in 2025 for its second meeting in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the applaudable initiative, as governments come together on the road to Paris 2025, the key point will be to observe how the PMP unfolds. Will it speak to a broader pool of countries? Are stakeholders going to be involved in and continue to provide inputs to the discussions? Will companies providing some of the intrusive tools be invited for future – even if private – discussions? Ultimately, what does success look like for this nascent process, and for whom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this collaborative piece, we bring together experts who have engaged in the PMP and attended the 6 February meeting. We invited them to reflect on what the PMP needs to consider if it is to be a sustained and action-based dialogue. These reflections are not exhaustive, but highlight some of the pressing concerns facing this agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-does-the-pmp-fit-in-and-who-fits-into-it&quot;&gt;Where Does the PMP Fit In, and Who Fits into It?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PMP is the latest chapter in a series of unfolding initiatives on this topic. In March 2023, during the US-led Summit for Democracy, 11 countries issued a statement recognising the threat posed by the misuse of commercial spyware and the need for domestic and international controls to curb the proliferation of these tools. Individual countries have also been vocal about the use of the technology, such as when the US issued an Executive Order prohibiting the use of commercial spyware that poses a risk to national security. Private-sector groups, such as the Tech Accord, have published a list of industry principles to curb the threat of cyber mercenaries (the developers, sellers and/or resellers of these tools). Civil society organisations have launched campaigns, investigations and joint statements highlighting the disproportionate effects and human rights violations of many of these intrusive tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the PMP fit into all of this? While the US view has purposefully focused on spyware, the initiative by the UK and France broadens the scope. Instead of focusing on the most intrusive and abusive technology, it seeks to cover a range of lawful, responsible, unlawful and irresponsible uses, answering questions such as: “What happens when a malicious actor uses pentesting tools and techniques to illegally enter a system?” In so doing, the PMP is able to speak politically to a broader range of stakeholders, instead of arriving at the negotiation table with a naming and shaming over “infamous” cases such as Pegasus. It is also able to engage with the whole gamut of businesses engaging in the supply chain of tools that range from legitimate to contested uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still unclear whether the political strategy of broadening the scope will result in greater engagement in the long run, or whether the debate will become more complex than purposeful. To address these risks, states will need to focus on concrete cases across the developer, supplier, user and targets spectrum of application – and possibly in different regions. Assessing the regulatory mechanisms, risk management procedures, accountability frameworks and prevention strategies that can be implemented for each segment will be crucial, as will the need for regional diversity and dialogue. If states or stakeholders in different regions do not feel represented, this might lead to withdrawal or disengagement. Building regional and/or thematic co-ownership in intersessional dialogues with states and stakeholders that are more willing to discuss the issue will be paramount for progress. Whether there needs to be a track for state responsibility and proliferation as it relates to the role of the private sector is yet to be seen, as the authors below also highlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legitimate-use-buzzword-or-legitimate-concern&quot;&gt;Legitimate Use: Buzzword or Legitimate Concern?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;katharina-sommer-ncc-group&quot;&gt;Katharina Sommer, NCC Group&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is stark how often participants mentioned that efforts to tackle the proliferation and irresponsible use of cyber capabilities should not impede their legitimate use. Representatives recognised the need for the cyber security industry and sector to exist, as well as states’ right to protect their citizens. But beyond high-level rhetoric, there was little progress towards defining what legitimate use entailed, or the criteria that should be applied to testing whether any development or use (of offensive capabilities) was, indeed, legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dual-use aspect of cyber security tools and practice is a perennial challenge, one that has not thus far found a satisfactory solution. Attempts in cybercrime legislation to distinguish legitimate and illegitimate activities by virtue of “authorisation/permission” are hardly fit for purpose in the 21st century, and looking at intent or motivation as a key differentiator comes with its own set of challenges. What will be important in the dialogue that follows over the coming months is to ensure that efforts to define legitimate use truly involve multiple stakeholders, including those from the private sector and the cyber security industry, whose (legitimate) security research and identification of software vulnerabilities, as well as their use of offensive cyber security tools – from penetration testing frameworks to de-fanged exploits as part of red team engagements – serve the purpose of improving organisations’ cyber resilience, and should not be negatively impacted by the PMP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one of the most meaningful contributions during the discussions described what was needed to tackle the challenges as a mosaic. There is no silver-bullet solution, much as we all would like one. It is crucial to accept that the solution will ultimately be a patchwork of different, smaller solutions undertaken by different actors across the ecosystem, all of which will make an incremental contribution to solving the cyber capabilities conundrum. The challenge for the French and British governments leading this process will be to come up with the umbrella that brings together and coordinates these different solutions into something that makes sense and looks coherent – and not just for the PR purpose of claiming success at the end of the process in Paris next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of states’ ambitions to restrict the development, use and transfer of commercial cyber intrusion capabilities, there are already a number of international obligations that can serve as a basis for tackling the proliferation and irresponsible use of these capabilities. As such, the PMP does not operate in a legal vacuum. And because international law in itself provides a framework for accountability – in particular general international law, international human rights law and even cybercrime law – we can already identify guidelines for the establishment of such an accountability system. These may differ depending on whether the state acts as a client or regulator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is critical that the Pall Mall Process avoids over-simplified, knee-jerk responses to abuses of cyber security tools and calls for prohibiting them&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the state acts as a client, existing international law could provide insight on how to develop procurement or use policies. For example, one could imagine the introduction of procedures to assess the impact of the use of certain capabilities on the target and its environment, as well as on the stability of cyberspace. Where the state acts as a regulator, the implementation of the right to a fair trial seems to be one of the most pressing concerns in order to provide victims with adequate remedies. When companies under the jurisdiction of a state are involved in cases of apparent violation of international law, states should systematically initiate administrative and criminal investigations to identify potential violations by the state as a regulator and the company and its subcontractors. Following the practice of the UK courts, further consideration should also be given to states’ sovereign immunity. If we focus on end-use as the subject of regulation, we quickly realise that the foundations for an accountability framework are already in place. So, it is time to build on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In two places, the Pall Mall Declaration refers to the “framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace”. This is an evolving framework that has been developed through the decisions and outputs of successive UN groups of governmental experts (GGEs), notably the agreement that international law applies to the conduct of states in cyberspace and the complementary articulation of 11 voluntary, peacetime norms. These norms and the GGE’s determination about the applicability of international law have subsequently been repeatedly endorsed by all member states at the UN General Assembly. In 2021, the most recent GGE provided guidance on norms implementation. Both the norms and the applicability of international law are important areas of discussion within the current UN forum for international cyber issues, the Open-ended Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Declaration draws particular attention to three of the norms: norm (e), on respecting human rights and relevant resolutions of the UN Human Rights Council; norm (i), on ensuring the integrity of supply chain security and preventing the proliferation of malicious ICT tools and techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions; and norm (j), on responsibility reporting of vulnerabilities and associated information sharing. It is not hard to see the connection between these norms and the types of commercial cyber intrusion capabilities that the PMP will focus on. The framework is also referenced later in the Declaration, in the paragraph which identifies accountability as one of four pillars of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is significant because the norms, and the framework more broadly, often come under criticism for being too vague or too poorly understood and applied outside of the cyber diplomacy community. By drawing a line between the framework and this emerging process, with its focus on specific cyber threats and its engagement with a broad range of stakeholders, the Declaration underscores the relevance of the norms while also demonstrating how they can be applied in practice. Also significant is the encouragement given to PMP participants to take appropriate action to hold states to account when their activity is inconsistent with international human rights law, and to hold non-state actors accountable in domestic legal systems as appropriate. The PMP has the potential to give a boost to broader cyber governance efforts, especially if it can formulate detailed and specific objectives and actions; however, it will be important to maintain complementarity and synergy with relevant UN processes. Moreover, given the challenges non-governmental stakeholders face with participating in UN processes, the PMP should prioritise active engagement with the private sector, academia and civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montreux Document and the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Service Providers (IcoC) – along with its oversight mechanism, the International Code of Conduct Association (IcoCA) – have been pivotal in translating international humanitarian and human rights law obligations into practical, actionable standards for private security companies. This approach provides a valuable multi-stakeholder template for managing cyber intrusion capabilities. Similar to the way these documents delineate ethical guidelines for private security operations, a parallel framework could be established for cyber intrusion activities, distinguishing between those that respect human rights (such as legitimate law enforcement and anti-terrorism measures by governments) and those that do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion to the Montreux Document and IcoC/IcoCA processes, a multi-stakeholder governance framework for cyber intrusion capabilities would require a clear set of standards and principles specifically tailored to the realm of cyber security. It would articulate the boundaries of ethical cyber intrusions, ensuring that they are in line with international law, especially concerning human rights. Just as the Montreux Document addresses state responsibilities and IcoC provides guidelines for private security companies, this cyber framework would address both state and non-state actors engaged in cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the framework could establish robust mechanisms for accountability and oversight, similar to IcoCA’s role in monitoring compliance with the IcoC. This would not only ensure adherence to the established standards but also foster trust among international actors and the public, enhancing the legitimacy of state actions in cyberspace. By establishing clear standards and oversight mechanisms, a governance framework for the responsible use of cyber intrusion capabilities would clearly define and promote ethical cyber operations that respect human rights, differentiating them from those that do not and thereby promoting a more responsible, rights-respecting and stable cyberspace environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proliferation and abuse of cyber security tools and spyware is not new. As the problem grows in scope, scale and negative impact, so too does the complexity of potential responses. So, I am heartened to see the UK and France taking an approach with the PMP that not only brings more than 30 governments together, but also includes the private sector, civil society and academia. The recent meeting in London represented an important stake in the ground, gathering voices from all these communities together to advance a nuanced understanding of the problem and to start discussions around potential responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, this will be a process, and I doubt that a resolution will be reached quickly or easily given the different dynamics and priorities at play for various stakeholders. Yet, I am encouraged by a few factors in the conversation so far. Firstly, there is an important emphasis on the realities of the harms being perpetrated and the human factors driving this discussion. We must not lose sight of this aspect as we move forward through the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there has been a solid acknowledgement of the importance and value of security research and legitimate cyber security tools. It is critical that the process avoids over-simplified, knee-jerk responses to abuses of these activities and calls for prohibiting them. Such a move would leave society far more exposed to cyber threats and could even strengthen the black market for vulnerabilities and exploits as researchers seek a payday they would otherwise get from more respectable avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The proliferation of intrusive and disruptive commercial cyber tools is arguably a microcosm of a broader “clash of governance” that has come to be a defining feature of the 21st century&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is an appreciation that there are vendors who want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. I worked for one such vendor for many years, and we strove to find ways to create greater accountability, oversight and transparency around our relevant sales, research and product development practices. I believe other vendors will do likewise if provided with a clear set of activities that can be undertaken without crippling the business. I hope this will form part of the work that comes out of the PMP in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of the PMP can be welcomed as a diplomatic success. With 25 states and regional organisations signaling their willingness to work on defining clearer rules for the legitimate use of cyber intrusive capabilities and to tackle their proliferation on the commercial market, the UK and France managed to deliver two important diplomatic outcomes. First, confirming the interest of a diverse group of states, including those beyond the usual group of “like-minded countries” – in focusing on this difficult but important issue in a dedicated process. Second, they extended the topic from commercial spyware – already dealt with in other initiatives such as the US-led joint statement of March 2023 – to the larger market empowering the irresponsible use of cyber intrusive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both achievements are a good start. But the danger would be to keep navigating in comfortable processual waters instead of actually solving the problems the initial declaration has laid out. At a time when the proliferation of international summits, processes and initiatives is in and of itself threatening the efficiency of states’ efforts to secure a free, peaceful and stable cyberspace, it is even more important to identify clear intermediary goals if the PMP is to become a true success. Some baseline suggestions can be made in this regard, building on the experience of other processes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Define a clear roadmap towards the French-hosted Pall Mall meeting in early 2025. This should especially include intermediary meetings throughout 2024 to identify possible consensual outcomes in early 2025, as well as key challenges to be addressed in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on clarifying legitimate uses with concrete use cases in mind. Before discussing any non-proliferation guideline or framework, participating states should focus on clarifying the uses of cyber intrusive capabilities that they consider legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leverage existing multistakeholder platforms and instruments. Building on existing frameworks and platforms such as the Cybersecurity Tech Accord or the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace will ensure widespread and meaningful participation of the stakeholder community, while avoiding reinventing the wheel in Pall Mall meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no single “killswitch” solution to the overarching dilemma of offensive cyber tools. In a world where we cannot “airgap” our societies, solutions must necessarily be international.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of intrusive and disruptive commercial cyber tools is arguably a microcosm of a broader “clash of governance” that has come to be a defining feature of the 21st century. If domestic and international legislatures were computer programmes, one could say that their source code has been written over the course of centuries through the formation of laws and norms. From the late 20th century onwards, however, this system of governance has overlapped – and contended – with a new form of governance: computer code authored predominantly by researchers and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least 80 states are believed to have drawn on the wares of the growing offensive cyber industry to bolster their intrusion and surveillance capabilities. In 2017, rogue entities repurposed a leaked US National Security Agency exploit – EternalBlue – and launched the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks. In the case of WannaCry, the international community – including a potentially disoriented British government – were given a reprieve by Marcus Hutchins’ identification of a killswitch. Will we be so lucky next time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of offensive cyber capabilities is fraught with risk. The PMP is a distinct opportunity for the international community to learn from the past and prepare for the future. The road may be rocky, and we should expect difficult, earnest and forthright discussions. But these should be welcomed, not feared. There are times when agreeing to disagree can be a fruitful endeavour. In the meantime, like-minded states must use their existing domestic levers to apply pressure and create the foundation for new norms – including, for instance, export controls, blacklists and codes of conduct. Additionally, like-minded states must empower civil society organisations, the media and researchers to shed light on malpractice and unchecked proliferation. Recent pushback against international reporting on some malpractice in this sector highlights a trend among some members of the industry to penalise those who help to inform checks and balances. The “whole of society” adage in cyber security can seem cliché, but the endeavour to mitigate the excesses of cyber proliferation must be exactly that. Future generations are watching us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western discourse about Russia’s way of war has oscillated between emphasising the conventional and unconventional threat. Up until Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the emphasis was disproportionately on Russian unconventional warfare – the conduct of sabotage, subversion and destabilisation through undeclared Russian forces – carried out in the so-called “grey zone”. This has since shifted to the conventional threat that Russia poses to NATO. The problem with this is that Russia considers both conventional and unconventional military means to be tools of national power and applies them in combination. It is the conventional threat of escalation that deters retaliation against unconventional activity, thereby expanding the scope of what Russia can get away with. Conversely, it is the unconventional operations of the Russian special services that aim to set the conditions for the successful application of conventional military force. Both tool sets must be understood to appreciate the threat that Russia poses. Its unconventional efforts remain central to its theory of victory against Ukraine – and countering them is equally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, the authors published a study of Russia’s unconventional operations targeting Ukraine directly, prior to and during the first year of the full-scale invasion. This mainly focused on the activities of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) in recruiting and managing agent networks in Ukraine, its planning for the establishment of an occupation administration, and the eventual counter-intelligence regime in the occupied territories that emerged after the failure of the original invasion plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report details Russia’s unconventional military activities outside Ukraine, including efforts to prepare for destabilisation in European countries, expeditionary operations in Africa to seize control of critical resources, and outreach to target audiences in the Middle East. Influence operations supported by information warfare and active measures exploited by agents of influence are core components of Russia’s unconventional warfare concepts. This topic is amply tracked and reported on by others. There is also much extant writing on Russia’s conduct of strategic intelligence collection by recruiting agents and penetrations in Western states. While acknowledging the significance of these wider activities, this report focuses on Russia’s military unconventional activities, with a particular spotlight on changes within the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (the GRU). Recent changes in this organisation suggest an expanding threat that must be prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s primary conclusions are that Russia’s special services actively seek to expand their capacity in several areas that pose strategic threats to NATO members. First, the GRU is restructuring how it manages the recruitment and training of special forces troops and is rebuilding the support apparatus to be able to infiltrate them into European countries. Second, the GRU has taken the Wagner Group’s functions in house and is aggressively pursuing the expansion of its partnerships in Africa with the explicit intent to supplant Western partnerships. Third, the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, is being used to build a broad network of influence among Chechen and Muslim populations in Europe and the Middle East, with the aim of contributing to the subversion of Western interests. These lines of effort should be countered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is divided into three chapters. Chapter I considers the establishment and growth of the GRU’s Special Activities Service, and the lines of effort being pursued to re-establish a support apparatus in Europe. Chapter II concerns the evolution of Russia’s so-called “Wagner Group”, its successor Expeditionary Corps, and the strategy for Russia’s expanding network of relationships in Africa. Chapter III examines Russia’s use of its Muslim minority for diplomacy in the Middle East and Europe and, specifically, the role of the Kadyrovtsy as a vector of Russian influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has a considerable body of material from the Soviet special services, including instruction manuals and operational reports that comprise an invaluable archive on the evolution of Soviet unconventional warfare techniques and structures. Furthermore, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, there remained close liaison between the Ukrainian and Russian special services until the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. This means that Ukraine has a unique set of insights into the working level of these organisations. This report draws on these archives, as well as on the body of scholarship on Russian unconventional operations. These materials clearly do not provide information on current Russian operations. The sources for the subsequent chapters are a combination of documents obtained from the Russian special services and reporting on the activities of Russian unconventional warfare elements, including human reporting observing Russian activities in Moldova, Mali, Sudan and further afield. The report also relies on interviews with the relevant official bodies in Ukraine and some European states, comparing data. Owing to the sensitivity of some of the materials, names of interviewees are not provided and interview times and locations are not specific. Many of the documents drawn upon are also described with a deliberate degree of vagueness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report’s most important conclusion is that Russia is using unconventional methods to expand its influence, evade containment, and destabilise and disrupt its adversaries – and is making progress in several directions. Countering these efforts requires an appreciation of the threat that extends beyond Ukraine and the active collaboration of those states that are being targeted. Russian methods are often unsophisticated and there is a litany of failures. Nevertheless, they persist, and so there is a requirement for sustained vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-violent-subversion-and-destabilisation&quot;&gt;I. Violent Subversion and Destabilisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violent subversion for the purposes of political destabilisation and even regime change has been a core element of Russian unconventional military operations since the Bolshevik coup of 1917. The very premise of Bolshevism as a political ideology was that the successful seizure of power, and later Moscow’s control over states, was unlikely to be achieved through popular revolution, but must instead be instigated by a disciplined and covert revolutionary vanguard. It was via these means that the Bolsheviks achieved their coup against the Russian Provisional Government in October 1917. It was also via these means that the Bolsheviks sought to export their revolution abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet intelligence services orchestrated an uprising in Hamburg in 1923 under the leadership of Hristofor Salnyn. In 1924, an uprising was organised under the leadership of Karl Trakmann in Estonia with the intention of overthrowing the government in Tallinn. That same year, Russian intelligence officers were instrumental in organising the Tatarbunary Uprising, which was intended to bring about a wider revolution across Romania after the establishment of the Bessarabian Soviet Republic. All of these efforts, and more besides, were preceded by sustained attempts at violent destabilisation, intended to create conditions of civic crisis that the revolutionary vanguard could exploit. These included acts of terrorism. For example, on 8 December 1920, an explosion in the Romanian Senate arranged by Soviet intelligence officer M Goldstein caused the deaths of the head of the Senate, General K Coanda, the minister of justice, D Grecanu, and several other senators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these efforts were largely unsuccessful, they spawned a body of theoretical literature in the Soviet Union that remains the foundations of the Russian theory of unconventional warfare. Notable texts from this period include Philip Anulov’s Armed Uprising, Armed Uprising by August Neuberg (the nom de plume of August Gellis), P Karatigin’s Guerilla Warfare: Initial Experience of Tactical Research, and M Drobov’s Small War: Guerilla Warfare and Sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the uprisings of the 1920s failed, largely because there was insufficient public support and a too concerted official response to the attempts. Thus, as the Soviet school of unconventional warfare evolved, greater emphasis was placed on the interrelationship between subversion through propaganda and human intelligence and its exploitation through violent destabilisation. The KGB’s Major General Yuri Drozdov summarised this interdependency in what became known within the Russian special services as the “Drozdov Binomial”. This argued that “the success of a HUMINT [human intelligence]-combat operation in modern conditions depends on a combination of two factors: an illegal intelligence operative plus a combat group (оперативно-боевая группа)”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which the vanguard theory of revolution propounded by the Bolsheviks remains at the core of the identity of Russian unconventional warfare practitioners is perhaps captured in the writings of the Strugatsky brothers, whose Noom universe proposes a cast of “progressors” infiltrating less-developed societies to guide them on the true path. It is no coincidence that the KGB infiltration of opposition movements in Eastern Europe, launched in 1968, was codenamed Operation Progress. The consistent features of the Soviet methodology are: elite capture through the recruitment of agents within a faction of a state’s political elite; the use of information operations and subversion to create political destabilisation; and escalation through violence to create a crisis through which Russian allies can seize power. Probably the best-known example of this process was Operation Storm-333 in Afghanistan in 1979, when GRU and KGB special forces assassinated President Hafizullah Amin to be replaced by the Soviet client Babrak Karmal. The centrality of HUMINT to even tactical special operations remains extant Russian doctrine, codified in the still-classified Manual for the Combat Use of Formations and Units of Special Purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GRU unit responsible for carrying out these operations is the 161 Intelligence Specialists Training Centre (currently Центр подготовки специалистов специального назначения; previously Центр подготовки специалистов разведки), hereafter the 161 Centre or Unit 29155. The 161 Centre was established in 1963 and brought together both human intelligence and special forces personnel. This duality of skills was exemplified by the first head of the centre, Major General Nikolay Patrakhaltsev, who started his career in special reconnaissance units but subsequently worked in both the legal and illegal stations of the GRU in Hungary, Slovenia and Brazil. He was also a member of the Soviet military mission at the General Staff of the People’s Liberation Army of Yugoslavia. The continuity in approach of the Russian special services from the Soviet period can be observed in several recent operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the 161 Centre was responsible for cohering an attempted coup in Montenegro, aimed at preventing the country’s accession to NATO. Part of the operation’s premise was that organised criminal elements working as recruited agents under GRU control would provide the basis for the seizure of Montenegrin government buildings, allowing for a seizure of power by several opposition politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example of the process is Ukraine in February 2022. The idea behind Russia’s invasion was that protests would provide the basis for polarisation and thereafter escalation of fighting inside Ukraine, sparked by provocations. This would justify Russian military intervention, aided by collaborators within the Ukrainian government, clearing the path for Russian agents recruited inside the Ukrainian parliament and state to seize power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third example are two Russian attempts to destabilise Moldova, first during Victory Day on 9 May 2022, and the second in February 2023. Russia’s original plan had been to militarily occupy Moldova after concluding its operations in Ukraine. When the invasion of Ukraine failed, however, Moscow sought a mechanism to destabilise the Moldovan state. The first attempt was orchestrated by the Department of Operational Information within the FSB. The initial concept revolved around the generation of protests against the repression of Soviet military symbols during the Victory Day commemorations in 2022. Provocations during these demonstrations were to be used to drive an escalating cycle of violence in which politicians friendly to Russia could call for a change in leadership to stabilise the situation. This failed, partly because the poor performance of Russian arms in Ukraine at the time left several politicians otherwise friendly to Russia cautious about exacerbating the initial organised demonstrations. Plans were further disrupted when Moldovan authorities arrested former president Igor Dodon. Another attempt was planned for early 2023. This revolved around the protest movement of Ilan Shorr, an Israel-born Moldovan oligarch and politician, with orchestrated protests intended to create the conditions for provocation, justifying a violent response. Part of that violent response was to be organised by GRU officers from Unit 29155 working with recruited Serbian citizens (in particular, supporters of the Belgrade-based Partizan football club). The Moldovan authorities also disrupted this attempt. Ilan Shorr remains in Israel after fleeing there in 2019 with Moldova seeking his extradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These instances are important to highlight for two reasons. First, the consistency of the forms and methods show that this is a policy tool that Russia continues to employ. Second, all these attempts were unsuccessful. The reasons for failure were consistent: poor operational security leading to the exposure of the plan to domestic security services and the disruption of its implementation; and inaccurate assessment by the Russian special services as to the extent of their influence in these countries. A further factor constraining Russian capabilities – despite a continued policy interest in using these techniques in the Kremlin – is that mass expulsions of Russian special services personnel across Europe following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine disrupted the support apparatus through which Russia conducts many of its operations. Between Moscow’s continuing intent to employ these methods and the identified shortcomings of the tools available, the special services have gone about changing their structures and forms and methods for implementing these operations. It is critical that those tasked with countering Russian subversion adapt to continue to counter an evolving threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reforming-moscows-vanguard&quot;&gt;Reforming Moscow’s Vanguard&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage in reforming Russia’s effectiveness following a string of failures was to improve both the honesty in reporting from the special services and the assessment of the likelihood of success. This was achieved in late 2022 by reforming the system for the management of operations. To do this, the Russian Presidential Administration established Committees of Special Influence under the overall direction of Sergei Kirienko, responsible for assigning the special services specific tasks against defined countries and to assess the effects of operations. By shifting the measure of special service operations from activities to effects, the committees began to cohere what had previously been rather disparate lines of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, over the course of 2023, following the failure of the second attempt to destabilise Moldova, Russian disinformation targeting the country became much more consistent and mutually reinforcing. Russia shifted to strengthen the public association between Moldova’s aspiration to join the EU and President Maia Sandu personally, while simultaneously blaming her for the country’s economic woes. At the same time, the Russians began targeting Romanian nationalists within Moldovan society to amplify their voices, and in doing so exacerbated the threat felt by Moldova’s Russian-speaking population in relation to increased alignment with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of interlocking coherence in Russia’s active measures and information operations has been observed more broadly, especially the narratives aimed at undermining support for Ukraine. Although these information operations are not the subject of this report, the committee structure gives the Russian state a much better basis for judging the impact of violence on the social conditions within target countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel to the Committees of Special Influence, active measures such as violent provocations are authorised by a committee of the national security council, under the guidance of its secretary, Nikolai Patrushev. However, such operations can only realistically be considered if there are personnel and an infrastructure able to implement them. This re-forging of the GRU’s capacity for subversive operations is the primary focus of this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GRU has identified three general vulnerabilities that it needs to address in its ability to conduct unconventional operations. The first is the exposure of its personnel and their vulnerability to identification through modern analytical techniques, including the association of mobile phones with specified locations using advertising data and other means of collection. The second problem was the disruption to the GRU’s support apparatus in Europe and further afield owing to the expulsions of rezidentura and exposure of illegals. These two issues compound one another. According to the doctrine for the use of special purpose units, a key task is “legalisation”, the term used by the Russian special services to indicate building a legend or cover identity to enable covert activity to be carried out in a target country. Depending on the duration of the cover activity, the Russians divide legalisation into full and partial categories. Full legalisation provides for the possibility of the operator staying in place for an indefinite period and ensures their safety in the event of an in-depth inspection by the target’s security services. Partial legalisation is adequate for a short-term legend who can withstand basic levels of scrutiny. Although Unit 29155 was able to achieve partial legalisation for operations successfully, its activities had begun to expose enablers who had been through full legalisation and were slower and more difficult to emplace. The third problem is one of agent reliability. As the detection of GRU personnel has constrained their movement, so too has the management of agents become increasingly remote. The GRU has found, however, that the reliability of agents under remote control is unsatisfactory and in Moldova, as in Ukraine, has caused the failure of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The processes to address these problems started in 2020. Naturally, they take time to implement and have accelerated since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. First, Andrei Averyanov, formerly commander of the 161 Centre, was promoted to become deputy head of the GRU, responsible for cohering all unconventional operations other than those targeting Ukrainian territory. GRU operations targeting Ukrainian territory fall under the responsibility of Vladimir Alexeiev, as the GRU’s special representative to the Command of the Special Military Operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To carry on rebuilding its capacity for unconventional warfare, Averyanov established the Service for Special Activities. This now comprises three entities: Unit 29155, now given a Guards designation; the newly established Unit 54654; and a headquarters and planning department for coordinating the Service for Special Activities. The 161 Centre is now organised into one headquarters unit, three training units, an operational planning unit, three operational units, a financial unit also responsible for managing support infrastructure, and a supply unit. In total, the centre appears to employ 147 instructors who also serve as operatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security procedures at the 161 Centre have changed. Personnel no longer carry personal or service mobile phones to the site, relying instead on a controlled group of wired telephones. Although staff operate from the site, training exercises are no longer primarily conducted at the facility but are instead organised in a series of safe houses (“conspiratorial apartments” in GRU parlance). These measures appear to be aimed at reducing the signature and vulnerability to pattern-of-life analysis. The separation of training from a fixed location is also aimed at making it harder to identify new members of the operational units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the old members of Unit 29155 have now moved with Averyanov to the Service headquarters to plan and manage operational activities. New personnel are being recruited to conduct operations, with an altered pattern of recruiting and training focused on assuring a low signature. Whereas the old unit drew around half of its personnel from Spetsnaz formations, new recruits appear to disproportionately have no military experience and are instead given instruction on the full range of military skills necessary for their intended role from within the GRU. In intelligence tradecraft terms, this borrows from the longstanding practice of generating cleanskins (personnel with no prior association with official bodies). However, the expansion of the methodology from niche clandestine functions to general recruiting as a response to a more transparent operating environment is a substantial shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unit 54654 appears to function differently. If Unit 29155 is primarily intended to deploy personnel for active intelligence under partial legalisation, Unit 54654 is intended to have a higher proportion of personnel working under full legalisation to prepare operations. As well as recruiting personnel without prior military contracts, Unit 54654 also recruits contractors through front companies – the most widely used of which appears to be named Directorate – which are owned by the GRU but otherwise unaffiliated with the Russian government. In this way, their names and other information are not entered into government records and their pay is managed separately from records for military salaries. This appears to be a mechanism that has arisen from the growth of the GRU’s so-called “PMCs” (private military companies). However, unlike the Wagner Group, Redut and other structures, Unit 54654 is focused on human intelligence and the establishment of support structures premised on a network of illegals: officers operating without diplomatic cover. To further conceal their identities, personnel are often assigned jobs in non-defence-related ministries or private entities and, in some instances, work from these sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GRU are also reorganising the basis on which they endeavour to build support networks in target countries. During the period when many countries sought business in Russia, the use of dual Russian nationals and business people provided an effective means of legalisation for illegals. However, the growth of Western sanctions has placed greater scrutiny on these individuals so that they are an existing but diminished vector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, a major effort appears to be targeting foreign students studying at Russian universities. The 161 Centre has a budget allocated to pay the stipends of students from the Balkans, Africa and other regions where there remain exchanges with Russian educational institutions. These stipends subsidise study and living costs and are apparently used as a vehicle for recruitment. Since these individuals are often from the elites of the target countries concerned, they are in themselves valuable sources of intelligence. However, they are also useful enablers. Combined with the use of Central Asian legends for members of Unit 54654, it becomes possible, for example, for a Balkan journalist to introduce a Kazakh businessman to an Austrian colleague and in this way gain legalisation into European countries. The vector of student recruitment can also be used abroad. Sending Russian students to countries that are still relatively open for Russian nationals – including under the guise of the Russian dissident diaspora – creates the potential for members of Unit 54654 to recruit personnel who can act as a support apparatus for the inadvertent legalisation of Russian visitors through shared causes, such as anti-colonialism, Palestine, Green protest movements and other popular student movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, organised crime provides another vector for legalisation. Russian organised crime is heavily penetrated by the FSB. Consequently, the Russian special services can use Russian organised crime to create lucrative business opportunities and foster goodwill with international organised crime. In Ukraine, for example, Russia has significant access to the international drug cartel Khimprom and uses it for military purposes, including attempts to distribute synthetic drugs to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Outside Ukraine, the recruitment of organised crime members is an effective means of recruiting agents who can use the inflated proceeds from lucrative business dealings to establish support structures for Russian intelligence, including safe houses, cars and shell companies. The individuals can also be vehicles for recruiting criminals to perpetrate acts of violence. Criminal actors are also able to generate muscle without the need for participants to know that they are working under Russian control. This allows for deniability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important vector in the regeneration of a support apparatus is the Russian exile community. Some of those who fled Russian mobilisation in September 2022 oppose the war in Ukraine. However, many others are loyal to the Russian state, albeit not to the extent that they were willing to be mobilised, and the flow of people provided cover for special service personnel to enter third countries. Participation in Russian opposition media and other activities provides surface-level “ethical washing” and thereafter creates a pathway to legalisation, since these individuals can then claim asylum. At the same time, it becomes possible for them to collect on other elements of the diaspora. More importantly, these individuals can be financed to gain influence within the community and to acquire assets that become useful for supporting unconventional operations. The usual method is for these individuals to receive money for selling a property – fictitious or otherwise – in a third country and then to use the money from the sale to engage in business interactions with other Russian entities where the costs are inflated in order to move money to the individual. Once they have established properties or other assets, this becomes a self-sustaining financial structure to keep the agent in place while drawing only from legally acquired funds, reducing the risk of detection through financial irregularities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GRU’s reach in Europe suffered real setbacks from the widespread expulsion of Russian intelligence officers and the exposure of its personnel in the lead-up to the invasion of Ukraine. There has been some surprise at the limited use of sabotage and other means to disrupt Western supplies to Ukraine; less than after Russia’s original incursion into Donbas in 2014. This is partly because of a desire to manage escalation with NATO, but it is also the result of a lack of capacity. Russia is now actively trying to rebuild the capacity to embark on such operations. As the war in Ukraine protracts, Russia has an interest in creating crises further afield. The Balkans present a particularly serious set of opportunities for such enterprises. Russia also has an active interest in destabilising Ukraine’s partners, and with a slew of elections forthcoming across Europe there is a wide range of opportunities to exacerbate polarisation. Moreover, with its conventional forces – so often used to coerce others – fixed by the fighting in Ukraine, the significance of unconventional operations as a lever of influence increases. This is especially important with the collapse of Russian overt diplomatic access across target countries. In short, because of the measures described in this chapter to rebuild its vanguard, Russia poses a serious and sustained threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information operations are a critical enabler of Russia’s destabilisation and subversion efforts and are therefore rightly scrutinised. What is often ignored, however, is that the public – and the manipulation of public sentiment – is a vehicle to mobilise or paralyse constituencies who service factions of a country’s elite. The Russian theory of change is not premised on convincing a majority, but rather on empowering politicians in the target country who will spearhead the implementation of policy favourable to Russia. The objective is elite capture. The use of violent provocation to exacerbate political crisis is a consistent part of the process. As the Drozdov Binomial indicates, the lynchpin of this process is the human intelligence support apparatus, which handles agents in the elite, facilitates active measures and ultimately sets the conditions for violence. Countering disinformation, although still necessary, is far less consequential than degrading the support apparatus in disrupting this process. European states must remain vigilant in their counterintelligence activities even as the GRU seeks to adapt. The process of elite capture may be contested in Europe, but has proven much easier in Africa, where the GRU has made significant gains since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This line of effort is the subject of the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-roscolonialism-wagner-and-the-grus-expeditionary-corps&quot;&gt;II. “Roscolonialism”: Wagner and the GRU’s Expeditionary Corps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the St Petersburg Economic Forum in June 2022, President Vladimir Putin declared that the West was “still influenced by their own misconceptions about countries outside the so-called ‘golden billion’: they consider everything a backwater, or their backyard. They still treat them like colonies, and the people living there, like second-class people, because they consider themselves exceptional”. For Putin, this reflected what he believes the West did to Russia in the 1990s and his own quest to rebuild Russian greatness. But it was also a pitch to other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when many Western states were trying to economically isolate Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin saw the development of economic ties with Africa and the Middle East as a means to sanction-proof Russia, and he had a pitch for the leaders of these states. It centred on the proposition that the “international rules-based order” advocated for by the West structurally favoured Western interests, whereas Russia’s emphasis on sovereignty would offer a mutually beneficial partnership. The reality – as Russian officials acknowledged internally – was a renewed Russian colonialism. Nevertheless, the Kremlin, through the GRU, has now set about seeking to build an “Entente Roscolonial” – a group of states that actively seek to assist Russia, while also becoming increasingly subordinate to Russian influence – displacing Western interests across Africa and the Middle East. This strategy’s trajectory is now becoming clear, but to appreciate its mechanisms one must understand the groundwork that was laid since 2014. Russia’s early forays into Africa were ad hoc. The foundations laid by that engagement have now developed into a deliberate strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter briefly summarises the work of the Wagner Group before outlining how Russian policy has developed since Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mutiny in June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-wagner-groups-ring-cycle&quot;&gt;The Wagner Group’s Ring Cycle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the development of Russia’s new colonialism is intimately bound up with the evolution of the so-called “Wagner Group”, one of the most widely misrepresented elements of Russia’s unconventional warfare capabilities. Much writing about the Wagner Group describes it as a PMC, used by the Russian state while at the same time pursuing an independent agenda. This fundamentally overlooks the dependency the group had on the Kremlin in all its activities and the extent to which its business activities followed Russian interests, rather than pre-empted them. The Wagner Group was financed by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation both directly and through the provision of profitable government contracts to Prigozhin, mostly related to the provision of food to servicemen and maintenance of military units’ housing stock. From May 2022 to May 2023 alone, Russia spent around $1 billion on wages and compensation payments to Wagner’s fighters. By way of comparison, the Russian national health system was allocated around $1.3 billion in 2022. This level of funding was not a unique consequence of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Between 2014 and 2023, Prigozhin received contracts worth over $10 billion from the government of the Russian Federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These funds do not include the provision of weapons and military equipment to the Wagner Group nor the costs of enablement by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. These were transferred via military units subordinated to the GRU. For example, the documents of Russian mercenaries who fought on the side of General Khalifa Haftar against the UN-recognised Government of National Unity in Libya, which were captured by Libyan intelligence during the fighting for Tripoli, contain an application to receive weapons and military equipment required for a mission. The mercenaries received four tanks, six BMPs, 12 trucks and 44 other vehicles. This equipment is comparable to that required by one mechanised company and supporting motorised companies of the Russian armed forces. In Ukraine, the Wagner Group received hundreds of heavy weapons from the Ministry of Defence, which included, in addition to armoured vehicles and artillery, anti-aircraft and electronic warfare systems, as well as huge amounts of ammunition. Throughout the group’s existence, the infrastructure of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation – particularly the Molkino training centre in Krasnodar – was used to train Wagner Group fighters. The Wagner Group’s headquarters, camp and combat training centre were located at the military base of the 10th Special Forces Brigade. The transport of Wagner Group fighters and goods to Syria, Sudan, Libya and the Central African Republic (CAR) was carried out by the 223rd Aviation Unit of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that most of the finance and enablement for Wagner Group activities comes directly from the Russian state shows that their operations were only viable if they received Russian state approval and that there was willingness to devote considerable resources to them. The Wagner Group, therefore, evolved in response to the GRU’s various requirements. The original unit of recruited fighters, formed around GRU officer Dmitri Utkin – call sign “Wagner” – in Ukraine after the Revolution of Dignity in 2014 to fight in Donbas, was a tool of the GRU’s unconventional war against Kyiv. Subsequently, when Russia decided to intervene in Syria, these groupings of fighters provided a convenient means of putting Russian fighters in harm’s way while reducing any political controversy by limiting the number of Russian soldiers killed. The decision to deploy Wagner to support Haftar in Libya followed Russian wishes to constrain Western access to Libyan oil and gas. Over time, however, all these operations created an ecosystem of troops who worked together on multiple operations and began to form a corporate identity. Moreover, Prigozhin’s administrative efficiency and his closeness to Putin at the time made him a trusted administrator for these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that so many different lines of effort became grouped under one person lent itself to a growing coherence between what had originally been diverse and separate lines of effort. The “Wagner Group” never existed as an official entity. Fighters were employed by various companies. But Wagner became the personnel’s corporate identity anyway. Because many of the Wagner Group’s administrative personnel were from the GRU, they pursued the traditional Russian special service methodology of endeavouring to make operations (operating as compared with capital costs) self-financing. This led to the pursuit of mining concessions and other cash-generating activities once deployed. Again, because the operations were connected through Prigozhin, this began to create a corporate identity for the organisation, although it was not in itself incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian thinking about the opportunities that the emergence of the Wagner Group created began to mature from 2016 to 2018. This coincided with a concerted effort to expand Russian influence and build new partnerships internationally. Within the SVR there was a sudden expansion of activities coordinated through the Coordinating Committee on Economic Cooperation with African Countries South of the Sahara (Afrokom). Although Afrokom had been established in 2009, from 2016 onwards the intensity of its activities increased. One important line of effort was the mapping of Russian influence on the continent. This was carried out through Russian cultural institutions like Rossotrudnichestvo, which began to reach out to African alumni of Russian and Soviet universities, usually under the auspices of printing yearbooks. Receptions for officials who had graduated from these universities began to be held in Russian embassies. The aim was to reconnect with those who might be both locally influential and positively disposed to Russia to begin conversations about expanding cooperation. The SVR also began to organise investment packages through Russian banks to expand the goodwill of key partners. Trips to Moscow for second-tier African politicians started to be expanded. Another line of effort saw the Russian defence ministry seek to expand defence exports across the continent, with a significant increase in the number of Rosoboronexport representatives posted to African countries. Between 2014 and 2018, Russia signed 19 defence cooperation agreements with African states. The overall volume of arms sales remains small and concentrated in Egypt and Algeria, but the influence and reach generated had wider implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GRU also began to expand intelligence collection across Africa. In 2018, Prigozhin established the Back Office Africa, essentially an intelligence and planning cell for Wagner operations in Africa. The cell was small, comprising 28 personnel, and had a modest budget. Several of its members, including Younis Nazarovich Abazid, were GRU officers. The GRU had deployed Abazid to Syria in 2016 to collect intelligence on the Islamic State and Jabhat Al-Nusra, and he had been a part of Russian negotiations trying to cohere the pro-Assad coalition. However, lines of effort were divided by country within the Back Office Africa. A heavy emphasis was placed on economic analysis and political technologists, political scientists and sociologists who were commissioned to produce studies of target countries. The Back Office’s first operations targeting Mozambique in 2019 did not go well. Nevertheless, the organisation learned from setbacks. Mali would arguably prove a turning point in its effective displacement of Western rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malian government signed a peace agreement with Tuareg and Arab rebels in 2015, with UN peacekeepers deployed to prevent clashes between both sides. However, insurgency broke out around Mopti from Fulani herders during that year, and over time Al-Qaeda and other extremist groups managed to co-opt the Fulani insurgency across the tri-border area. Led by France, Western states pursued a strategy of trying to provide human security in isolated communities while conducting counterterrorism raids with the G5 group of Sahelian states. There were many problems with this approach. The counterterrorism operation was fundamentally about protecting Europe through the targeted killing of jihadists. At the same time, the peacekeeping mission shielded rebel groups from being confronted by the state, but the lack of political progress and consequent economic stagnation drove people to banditry. While communities might be safe from physical attack in towns guarded by the UN, they also had no prospects, and the Malian military felt unable to implement a policy that would change the dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian encouragement of the Malian military to reclaim the state’s sovereignty from its Western partners proved persuasive. The first coup, on 18 August 2020, was orchestrated by a group of colonels, two of whom had just returned from receiving training in Russia and were instrumental in seizing Mali’s main military base. After the military failed to push through the changes they wanted with an interim transitional government, they launched a second coup on 24 May 2021, and set about laying the groundwork for Russian mercenaries to enter Mali. The Russians promised to provide soldiers and equipment to the Malian armed forces to aggressively attack rebel communities. The Malian state could therefore expel MINUSMA (the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali) and the French without losing access to the military support necessary to implement a sovereign policy. Russian forces began to arrive in December 2021 and have since succeeded in getting Mali’s international partners for over a decade expelled. Russia is now replicating its offer in Burkina Faso and Niger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Africa strategy – to displace Western interests, gain control over critical resources, and reduce its own vulnerability to sanctions – was disrupted by the failure to achieve a rapid victory in Ukraine. Suddenly, Wagner was repurposed to confront Russia’s latest security challenge, providing troops to bolster Russian ground forces in Donbas. Nevertheless, as Putin made clear in his 2022 speech at the St Petersburg Economic Forum, the Africa strategy remained a key priority for the Kremlin. When Prigozhin launched an attempt to have Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov removed from office in June 2023 over their incompetent prosecution of the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin faced a serious problem. On the one hand, there was a clear need to remove those who had conducted the mutiny. At the same time, for reasons of convenience as much as anything else, a significant part of Russia’s foreign policy had become structurally implemented through the Wagner Group. How, therefore, could Russia continue expanding its African partnerships while breaking up the single power centre that had caused such disruption to operations in Ukraine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;averyanovs-expeditionary-corps-and-the-regime-survival-package&quot;&gt;Averyanov’s Expeditionary Corps and the Regime Survival Package&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prigozhin might have been on a trajectory to establish himself as an independent actor, but at the point he attempted to exert this – either through extending his authority too early, too far or both – that independence proved illusory. His move against Gerasimov and Shoigu did not receive the retrospective official support he seems to have hoped for, and precipitated his downfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the crisis meetings following Prigozhin’s mutiny, the Russian Presidential Administration made several structural decisions. In late June 2023, it was decided that the Prigozhin enterprise would be broken up before the liquidation of the Wagner Group’s leadership. The FSB would take over Prigozhin’s domestic commercial enterprises and his communications businesses would come under SVR supervision. The foreign military components would fall under the GRU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the GRU, it was decided that Wagner’s activities would be divided into two components. First, a Volunteer Corps would be formed covering operations in Ukraine. Companies such as Redut would provide the legal mechanism for Wagner fighters to sign up as individuals. These companies would then sign a contract to provide services to the Russian Ministry of Defence, thus bringing them under the Russian military’s control. The Volunteer Corps would be managed within the GRU by Alexeiev as the GRU’s special representative to the Command of the Special Military Operation. In parallel, the GRU has established an Expeditionary Corps, which also uses a range of companies, including Convoy, as fronts for fighters to sign up. The GRU Expeditionary Corps is commanded by Andrei Averyanov and directed by his Service for Special Activities. The initial aspiration was for 40,000 troops to join the Expeditionary Corps. This was subsequently reduced to a target of 20,000 by the end of 2023 – which the GRU failed to meet – with the aspiration to recruit and train local forces to make up additional mass. Although slower than originally hoped, the number of personnel is steadily rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This division may have sounded straightforward on paper but would prove highly complicated to implement. First, Wagner fighters exercised some agency in where they signed up. Pavel Prigozhin, Yevgeny’s son, attempted to retain some control over the organisation by offering Wagner as a formed body to Victor Zolotov and the Rosgvardia (National Guard). This was consistent with instructions to Rosgvardia to expand its combat capabilities in Ukraine and so was partially approved. The result was a bidding war for commanders between the GRU and Rosgvardia. A similar problem arose between the Volunteer and Expeditionary Corps. The latter was clearly safer and offered long-term opportunities for lucrative financial rackets. The former was much more dangerous. The GRU attempted to manage this tension by adjusting the financial packages between the outfits. Nevertheless, the resulting division of Wagner units has proven disruptive to force cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further challenge that had to be managed was the offer and coherence of deployed Expeditionary Corps units. Under Wagner, the Back Office Africa negotiated the provision of support with parallel concessions or other compensation often granted to a parallel company. For example, in 2018, after the president of the CAR, Faustin-Archange Touadera, appealed to Russia to provide him with assistance in the fight against insurgent groups and to provide his close protection, his former national security advisor Valery Zakharov (a former Russian intelligence officer) returned to his office. Despite his title, Zakharov was responsible for a wide range of issues, including the coordination of economic projects of interest to the Russian Federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar situation is observed in Sudan, where the Wagner Group has been active since 2017. Russian mercenaries appeared in Sudan after President Omar Bashir’s visit to Moscow, where he signed several agreements with the Russian government, including the establishment of a Russian naval base in Port Sudan and a gold-mining concession between the Russian firm M-Invest (at that time close to Prigozhin) and the Sudanese Ministry of Minerals. It is worth noting that Russia is now pursuing its interests in Sudan – including setting its sights on the oil refinery in Khartoum – through the Rapid Support Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial reason for this cost recovery was precisely to create implausible deniability for the Kremlin. This was because many of the operations being conducted were either at the expense of other states or violated UN Security Council resolutions. For example, the use of the Wagner Group in the CAR circumvented the direct prohibition of the UN Security Council on the supply of arms and military equipment to the CAR. There is no doubt that the CAR government perceived the presence of Russian mercenaries and other military and non-military assistance provided by Prigozhin’s staff as coming directly from the government of the Russian Federation. Thus, in 2020, an official CAR government representative publicly announced that Russia would send several hundred military personnel and heavy military equipment to the CAR. According to him, this was done to support the government on the eve of the presidential and parliamentary elections within the framework of official agreements concluded between the CAR and the Russian Federation. A communiqué issued by the CAR Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed his words. Official representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, represented by the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the CAR and Deputy Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, immediately denied this, saying that Russia conscientiously complies with all the requirements set out in UN resolutions. In January 2023, however, the Kremlin directed cost recovery as a means of avoiding the diversion of resources from the Special Military Operation, and also to link target countries with Russia economically, thereby expanding avenues for sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem for the Expeditionary Corps is that it risks the removal of this plausible deniability. Since the contracts signed by fighters are with private companies, it is possible for Moscow to retain implausible deniability as to the personnel. It is harder, however, for this to be the case with the negotiation of business deals and agreements. It appears that Russia has finally decided to explicitly challenge the international system rather than pretend to comply with it. Shortly after Prigozhin’s death, Averyanov began to tour African capitals alongside Russian Deputy Defence Minister Yunus-bek Yevkurov, accompanied by former Wagner commanders. The message they delivered to key partners was consistent: former commitments would be honoured, but they would now deal directly with the Russian Ministry of Defence. This has not stopped the parallel financing of operations. The Malian government, for example, is currently reforming its mining code to allow foreign concessions to be seized and then allocated to Russian companies. Russia’s proposal is that it will use the money that would otherwise have gone to Australian and other companies to pay for its military support to the Malian government, and that the Malian government will continue to gain taxation from the mines and will not be lumbered with the debt finance proffered by the West. Russia has a particular interest in lithium mines and has established a gold refinery within its compound at Bamako International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of August 2023, the Russian government assessed the strengths and vulnerabilities of the Africa strategy. Documents reveal a vision of exploiting access for a more concerted attack on Western interests. For example, it is proposed that Russia’s relations with Niger could be used to threaten French access to uranium mined in the country, further increasing the French energy sector’s dependence on Russian-supplied uranium. But the assessments also make clear that Russia has vulnerabilities. The understanding and business acumen of the GRU represents a particular area of concern, since Prigozhin’s financial structures in Africa were complex. The SVR is likely to play a leading role in trying to cohere this line of effort. Another significant risk that Russian analysts highlighted was of Russia’s explicit involvement causing a growing perception of economic exploitation and colonialism, undermining Moscow’s anti-colonial message. The analysts acknowledge the fundamentally colonial nature of the Russian project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “offer” the GRU is now pushing is being internally described as the “regime survival package”. The logic of this offer is that Russia will provide elites in target countries with military support, economic and political protection from backlash via the UN or other international mechanisms, and the support of political technologists to sell their popularity domestically. A critical component of the package is the isolation of a target country’s leadership. For example, in Mali, the Expeditionary Corps – as occurred in the CAR – now provides presidential protection, since this proximity ensures sustained understanding and influence within Malian decision-making. Wagner has a long history of establishing domestic propaganda structures. One of the first successful examples was the creation of the Lengo Songo radio station, which quickly became one of the mouthpieces of Russian propaganda in the CAR and is consistently among the three most popular radio stations in the country. It is worth noting that the Russian political technologist and media manager Igor Mangushev (formerly a Russian navy officer who organised Russian paramilitary groups in the war against Ukraine in Crimea and Donbas in 2014) was heavily involved in establishing the programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the effect of this offer is to close off the relationships that a country has with the West. Very often, the conduct of massacres and other violations of international law will prevent Western partners from maintaining links with a partner military, the long-term effects of which may not be fully appreciated when cooperation is first agreed. Furthermore, in the medium term, the violent approach used by the Expeditionary Corps may secure a government and fulfil perceived short-term needs, but is unlikely to bring peace to the hinterlands of the recipient country. It is worth noting that the Russian approach is consistent with the tenets of Soviet anti-partisan warfare, involving the use of collective punishment, hostage-taking of local political figures and aggressive raids to kill insurgents. The effect is often the defeat of an insurgent group but an absence of stability or human security. The result is that Russian security partners initially gain a sovereign capability through Russia’s mercenaries and medium-term personal security. However, they also become dependent and begin to lose access to alternative security providers. In the medium to long term, the economic concessions Russia demands risk creating an extremely unequal relationship, in which Moscow extracts much more than it offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution arrived at by Russia to reduce the reputational harm associated with a colonial project is to conduct partnered operations. In August 2023, Avreyanov and Yevkurov visited Syria, where they met President Bashar Al-Assad, and Libya, where they met Haftar. According to the readouts from the meetings, both leaders expressed approval for the suppression of the Wagner Group and were encouraged that the Russian state would continue to provide support. It was also proposed – and apparently favourably received – to establish fighter training camps that would be run by the Expeditionary Corps in Palmyra and Tobruk. In both cases, the offer was to train fighters for the respective Syrian and Libyan forces. However, it is also evident that the Expeditionary Corps will look to recruit some of the trained personnel to work with them in Africa. This has precedent. Wagner, for example, brought Syrian fighters with them to Libya. They are currently preparing to move troops to Burkina Faso, and the contingent may include both Russian and non-Russian troops. Another way the Russians wish to show partnership is by embedding advisors in partner forces rather than simply providing contingents to work alongside partners. These measures are not new. They are highly consistent with the Russian experience in Chechnya, and the resemblance to Russia’s Chechnya policy in the construction of the Entente Roscolonial does not stop at combat unit structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Entente Roscolonial is a serious threat to Western interests. First, with the US increasingly fixated on the Indo-Pacific and European attention saturated by the war in Ukraine, most African operations have become economy-of-force affairs. Moreover, the disparity in resourcing and attention paid to Ukraine or Gaza as compared to Tigray, for instance, has left a strong and bitter sense across Africa as to the hierarchy of Western concerns. Similarly, the apparent contrast in Western language and rhetoric between how it described the destruction of Aleppo or Mariupol, and how it has excused Israeli operations in Gaza, leave many on the continent perceiving a gap between Western rhetoric about values and the values practised by those who have, for so long, imposed constraints on the policies of African states to enforce values-based norms. The language used when rejecting Western security assistance in favour of Russia is almost always that of sovereignty. This is not to suggest that there are not defensible reasons for Western policy, but the perception is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, Russia is exploiting a rich opportunity to build new relationships and, in doing so, set up challenges for the West. Through persistent instability, Russia can push migration into Europe, creating the conditions for Averyanov’s Service for Special Activities to pursue political destabilisation, as is being explored through illegal migration pushed towards Finland. Leverage over natural resources is also expanding. Perhaps most problematic, however, is how the pitch for values is giving Russia access to communities that interface with a range of extremist beliefs. In this, as with the training approach being explored in Syria and Libya, Russia is expanding what its proxy Ramzan Kadyrov offers, which is the subject of the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-kadyrovtsy-and-the-defence-of-traditional-values&quot;&gt;III. The Kadyrovtsy and the Defence of “Traditional” Values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s Expeditionary Corps is intended to be the vanguard of Putin’s multipolar world view, offering those who reject Western legal structures the means to preserve their rule and wreak violence on their enemies. If the Expeditionary Corps is an offer to elites, there are more populist narratives that Russia pushes at a range of constituencies. Russia’s argument is that it is the bastion of “traditional values”, embodied by religiosity, the nuclear family, heterosexuality and loyalty to the state. The Orthodox Church pushes this outreach to religious groups in the US, and through social media to conservative constituencies across Western Europe and North America. This vision of Russia is contrasted with a depiction of the West as, according to some of the increasingly lurid propaganda narratives being promoted, a bastion of decadent homosexual worship of Satan. The Russian narrative of its defence of traditional values finds a particular expression and confluence with Russia’s unconventional warfare capabilities in Chechnya under Kadyrov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kadyrov’s distinctive monologues on social media, the tactically spurious combat theatre pushed by Chechen fighters on TikTok and the arbitrary violence of Chechen politics mean that modern-day Chechnya appears comic as much as it does tragic to Western audiences. Nevertheless, many of the perceptions of Chechnya and its leader are inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kadyrov is largely autonomous in his domestic politics. The Russian state does not seek to impose control, and indeed the Kadyrov clan owe their position to an inability on the part of the Kremlin to do so unilaterally at acceptable cost in the past. Putin and Kadyrov share a mutual dependency. Kadryov is loyal to Putin and thereby keeps Chechnya closely aligned to Russia’s foreign policy. There is a personal loyalty here that means Kadyrov will seek the permission of and take direction from Moscow where it matters to the Kremlin. Furthermore, like Wagner, 85% of Chechnya’s budget comes from the Russian state. Like Prigozhin, Kadyrov is fundamentally dependent on Moscow. Like Wagner, Chechnya’s semi-autonomous character lends itself to deniability for the Kremlin. Where Kadyrov exerts himself in building influence expands Russia’s reach and closely aligns with the interests of Russia’s special services. After all, Kadyrov can reach audiences that Moscow does not across the Muslim world and Chechen diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian official propaganda and networks of hidden influence operating in Muslim countries push a romantic image of Kadyrov as a defender of Islam, opposing Western heretics who are trying to destroy traditional values. A good recent example of this dynamic was how Kadyrov’s son was filmed beating a prisoner accused of burning a Qur’an. This was contrasted with the restraint of Swedish and Danish police in punishing Qur’an burnings that took place in 2023. Qur’an burnings in Sweden not only led to violent clashes with the police, and caused rifts with Ankara at a time when Stockholm was seeking to join NATO, but prompted Iraqi protesters to storm and set light to the Swedish embassy in Baghdad. Chechen and Russian influence channels exacerbated these dynamics by highlighting the contrast in Arabic media, and amplified criticism of Sweden and Denmark. Another good example is how Kadyrov was extremely forceful in denouncing Israel during its war against Hamas in late 2023. Kadyrov’s anti-Israeli statements were actively replicated by Russian- and Chechen-controlled media, as well as by troll factories on social networks targeting Muslim audiences, mainly in Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build-up of influence is also pursued through charity and social work, primarily conducted through the Akhmat Kadyrov Foundation. This organisation funded the reconstruction of mosques in Aleppo, but also promotes Kadyrov’s status by popularising the image of his father Akhmat Kadyrov as a religious figure. This work is also pursued through entities such as the European Islamic Forum. The organisation is especially active in the Balkans, where it has established ties with authoritative Muslim representatives (not only religious, but also political figures) in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Croatia, Greece and Romania. The European Islamic Forum is also active on EU territory. For example, the forum held a conference dedicated to the 70th anniversary of Akhmat Kadyrov in Estonia in 2021, which was attended by Muslim representatives from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Denmark, Finland, Poland, Sweden, Germany and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popularity that Kadyrov has created personally on religious and nationalistic grounds among the Chechen diaspora allows his representatives to reach into and recruit personnel on different sides of a range of conflicts and across a wide geography. In Libya, for example, while the Russian state backs Haftar, Kadyrov maintains diplomatic channels with the internationally recognised Libyan government. In 2016, Kadyrov stated that at the very beginning of the war in Syria, fighters of the Chechen special forces were sent to training camps to join militants who professed Wahhabism. Whether this would have been to penetrate the Islamic State and other groups to counter any potential threat that they posed or to support, influence and partially co-opt them is not entirely clear. Nevertheless, Chechens achieved senior positions in many of Syria’s militias including the Islamic State, and the group did manage a range of negotiations with the Assad government, for which such networks would be exceedingly useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kadyrov’s claim is plausible. Such actions are consistent with historical operations of the Russian special services. There are also proven instances of the Kadyrovtsy using these methods during the war in Ukraine. Husein Jambetov, who fought on the side of Ukraine in 2022 as a platoon commander, appeared in Chechnya in 2023 where he spoke to mercenaries at the Russian Special Forces University with a call to be loyal to Russia and Kadyrov. It is also clear that Kadyrov has no problem encouraging and engaging with Islamist extremists. Abdullah Anzorov, who in 2020 killed French teacher Samuel Pati for showing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in a free speech class, was subsequently praised by Kadyrov, who declared that the teacher was guilty of his own murder. Russian troll farms amplified this pronouncement among Arab audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anzorov is interesting because he sits at the intersection of Kadyrov’s religious and ethnic influence. He was a member of a Chechen mixed martial arts (MMA) club in Paris. Martial arts have been used extensively as vectors of Kadyrov’s influence since 2007, when there was a concerted effort to infiltrate Chechen diaspora organisations. This followed two well-established approaches of the Soviet special services: the seeding of agents into refugee groups; and the use of martial arts as a structured social setting enabling both network recruitment and coordination. The Soviet preference was the use of combat sambo, although the sport is rarely found outside the former Soviet Union. Kadyrov prefers MMA, which as a catch-all for different training disciplines enjoys broad reach. Kadyrov’s representative in Germany is European MMA champion Timur Dugazaev, who went there as a political refugee and now organises Chechens for pro-Russian street protests. The representative in France is Ali Bajayev, a refugee and former lieutenant colonel in the Russian armed forces. Sentiments among the Chechens of France and indeed other European regions are growing increasingly pro-Russian. During riots organised by Chechens in Dijon in 2020, the use of Russian symbols and the painting of pro-Russian graffiti, including the words “Glory to Putin!”, were recorded. Kadyrov then expressed his personal support for the rioters. It is notable that Chechens came from all over Europe to participate in the riots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular MMA fighters are also used to influence both their international fans and other countries’ elites. MMA champion Khamzat Chimaev, who is close to Kadyrov, lived in Sweden from childhood and represented that country, but moved to Dubai in October 2023 and will henceforth represent the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of social status and access to a range of constituencies – both secular and religious – makes Kadyrov a valuable proxy diplomat of the Russian Federation; a unique capability for a regional governor in Russia that occasionally generates comment. In recent years, he has managed to establish effective working relationships with many leaders in the Middle East, including the president of the UAE, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, representatives of the royal family of Bahrain, and leaders of Jordan. It is indicative, for example, that during his visit to Russia in 2017, the king of Saudi Arabia spent more time with Kadyrov than with Putin. The refusal of several states to join the anti-Russian sanctions associated with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine is partly shaped by Kadyrov’s diplomatic efforts. It is not surprising that in July 2023, Putin appointed Kadyrov’s adviser Turko Daudov as a permanent representative to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Daudov was previously a key representative of Chechnya in Arab and Muslim countries. It is arguable that Russia places more importance on Kadyrov as a diplomat than his interlocutors, who are pursuing relationships with Russia for a range of reasons. Nevertheless, personal relationships matter in diplomacy, and Kadyrov has become the intermediary for a range of Russian efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Kadyrov conducts defence diplomacy through the Russian Special Forces University, a private organisation that was created at Kadyrov’s initiative in 2013. It was initially called the International Training Center for Special Purpose Forces, and the direct supervisor of the project was Kadyrov’s adviser, Colonel Daniil Martynov, a former employee of the Special Purpose Centre of the FSB. The organisation has been widely misunderstood. Many have mistakenly believed that it is for training special forces. Like the 161 Training Centre, Chechnya does maintain special operations forces and uses them to conduct assassinations and sabotage. It also performs political demonstrations. In 2016, during Russian Special Forces University training in the Arctic, a group of Chechen special forces brought weapons and military equipment to the territory of Longyear Airport, located on the Norwegian demilitarised Svalbard archipelago, which became the cause of a diplomatic scandal between the two countries. Although the university uses the mystique of special operations in its marketing, the organisation is better understood to be a centre where special forces train irregular troops. It provides this training internationally and for preparing forces for the front in Ukraine. It is, perhaps, a good model for understanding what the GRU may end up establishing in Palmyra and Tobruk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chechen model is useful in understanding the forms, methods and threat posed by Russia’s unconventional warfare capabilities because it shows how multiple lines of effort, cohered under one individual, become mutually reinforcing over time. They are then brought together to achieve the interest of the Russian state. During the failed coup attempt in Montenegro, for example, the operation was coordinated by GRU officer Victor Boyarkin, close to the oligarch Oleg Deripaska, with representatives of Unit 29155. Boyarkin, however, was supported by both Serbian organised criminal elements under Sasha Sajelich, and by Martynov, which – according to the documents relating to the trial – worked with Kadyrov’s networks to try to sway the attitude of the Muslim population to support the coup’s outcome. During Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the intersection between active measures targeting popular sentiment and provocations using proxy networks and sabotage groups remains a serious threat. Kadyrov’s importance to the Kremlin’s unconventional warfare planners is perhaps best demonstrated by the fact that it was Chechen organised criminals who were used to liaise with Ukrainian criminal networks just prior to the full- scale invasion, in an attempt to co-opt them to support the occupation administration. It was also Kadyrov’s special forces, led by Martynov, who were to lead the seizure of the governmental buildings in Kyiv and thereafter the kill or capture of leading Ukrainians. As Russia attempts more unconventional operations in Africa, Kadyrov’s involvement should be anticipated. Understanding how semi-autonomous actors like Kadyrov fit into the kaleidoscopic tools that Russia applies is important if Russia’s targets are to ensure their resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resilience of the approach in the long term is also worth noting. The extent of Kadyrov’s popularity and influence among the Chechen people, both within Chechnya and among the diaspora, is concerning and a potential harbinger of how Russian influence might play out elsewhere. The Kadyrov clan facilitated the occupation of Chechnya by Russia, who were unable to control the region despite exceptionally heavy-handed measures. The results were disastrous for the population; while estimates vary and accurate figures are likely impossible to ascertain, up to 300,000 Chechen civilians may have died during the Chechen wars and insurgency, out of a population of little more than a million. For many years, this betrayal earned the clan a lasting hostility, and to a degree Kadyrov still rules by force, having progressively purged opponents, rivals and even on occasion his own supporters. However, a younger generation has come of age only experiencing Kadyrovite rule. While Ramzan’s rule might previously have been precarious, it appears that generational change and the ability to provide patronage to younger people with few other prospects outside the Chechen state apparatus, other than moving away, has lent his regime a significant degree of stability, even resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While GRU operations abroad are adjacent to those of Kadyrov, the methodologies overlap. Arguments that the scale of obstacles faced by the Wagner Group in the past indicate that Russian expeditionary operations will harm Western interests but ultimately provide little strategic benefit for Russia have some justification – Mozambique provides an example of repeated setbacks and limited progress. However, if they are allowed to solidify their influence or control unchallenged over many years and are able to conduct a high volume of influence operations and propaganda, their presence may be increasingly accepted, even as the downsides become apparent to regional actors entangled in isolation and dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that in the aftermath of Prigozhin’s mutiny, the Russian state sought to bring much of its proxy force more directly under Moscow’s control. Kadyrov, however, remains an outlier. Not only did he swiftly pledge loyalty to Putin, but Putin appears to retain confidence that despite Kadyrov’s significant power base he will not create comparable disruption for the Kremlin in the future. It may be that at a personal level, Putin’s trust is well placed. Beyond Kadyrov, however, Chechnya has a range of disputes with its neighbours inside Russia, especially with Ingushetia and Dagestan. How these disputes will manifest in a post-Kadyrov world is an interesting question. It is certainly evident that the Kremlin’s comfort with Kadyrov’s autonomy is not shared among Russia’s Slav population. The irony is that the very diffusion of effort and entrepreneurialism that makes Russia’s unconventional warfare capabilities dangerous remains a long-term threat to Russian stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report has highlighted the growing and diversifying threat from Russian unconventional warfare targeting states beyond Ukraine. These activities contribute to the wider use of information operations and active measures to destabilise and subvert opposing states. The Russian playbook has been remarkably consistent for decades. The overall approach is to use information operations and active measures to polarise a target population, mobilise factions in support of allied elites, and paralyse support for opposing elements of a country’s leadership. Human intelligence operations are used to attempt elite capture through the offer of assistance to politicians who support Russian interests. Finally, violence can be employed to escalate political tensions to the point of crisis, or in other contexts to isolate a captured elite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report, primarily concerned with the latter part of this cycle, has demonstrated three things. First, although the Russian capacity for covert violence in Europe was disrupted by the exposure of its personnel and the breaking up of elements of its support apparatus, the Russian state is actively working to rebuild this capacity. Second, the intent to achieve this reflects a wider intent to widen the aperture of its geostrategic competition with the West, which could manifest in Europe, but is already being carried out at scale in Africa. Third, as the example of Kadyrov shows, the kaleidoscopic and chaotic lines of effort pursued by Russia’s special services – if left unchecked – will become increasingly mutually supporting and harder to disrupt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian approaches are often crude and this report has detailed a litany of failures. Tradecraft and operational security are often poor, although the current process of restructuring and reform may bolster the capability for operations to remain undetected. There is a systemic problem in the Russian special services with a lack of independent analysis. Those tasked with implementing an operation are primarily responsible for assessing its likely success and are therefore prone to overestimate their capabilities. Nevertheless, the Russians persist and, if left unchecked, failures as experienced in Mozambique turn into successes as seen in Mali. Europe faces a slew of elections this year, and the initial chaotic application of active measures is steadily becoming more coherent under the close attention of Russia’s Presidential Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of this threat, Western states must appreciate that undermining the human intelligence activity that supports unconventional warfare methods is vital to degrading Russia’s capacity to employ the techniques described in this report. In this context, countering disinformation – while important – is far less consequential than breaking Russia’s access to and leverage over elites, and its support apparatus for active measures. This can be achieved through the exposure and arrest of its agents, intelligence officers and activities. Stepping up counterintelligence activity in this regard is an important priority. The risk is that the effort to constrain Russia becomes a McCarthyite paranoia. As a lot of Russia’s unconventional operations are self-defeating, countering Russian unconventional warfare must be premised on careful, selective and intelligence-driven targeting. This is why having a broad understanding of Russian forms and methods is essential; it protects a state from jumping at shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Russia’s progress in Africa is referred to in this report as the formation of an “Entente Roscolonial”. On the one hand, it is – as Russian officials admit internally – a colonial project to gain control over African governments and exploit the continent’s natural resources. On the other hand, an entente – or informal and friendly alliance between factions – reflects the fact that Russia has been invited to take up this mantle and the juntas that are inviting the Russians in often have significant popular support, at least among the majority ethnic groups in their countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s mandate is due to the West’s strategic neglect and its failure to address the problems that its partners face. Russia may also fail to do this, but for now frustration with the West in both Africa and the Middle East is high. The point is that while Western states focus on rebuilding their conventional deterrence in Europe, strategic documents emphasising the nature of a global competition are being vindicated. Yet Western states are failing to compete. This must change. Russia is using unconventional warfare to advance its vision of a multipolar world order. This poses threats far beyond Ukraine. It is critical that Western states rise to meet that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第28日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。WhatsApp 訊息紀錄顯示陳於2020年5月8日，向主理《蘋果》論壇版的楊清奇傳送3個 Patreon 連結，作者分別為蕭若元、劉細良和雲海。陳稱記得黎智英曾點名表示喜歡劉細良的文章，想邀請他替《蘋果》撰文；她亦記得當時《蘋果》正推行付費訂閱計劃，所以想了解在 Patreon 的訂閱模式下，有哪些作者會較受歡迎和吸引到讀者。陳形容劉細良是「比較接近民主派的觀點」，而蕭若元「都係點評吓時政，同埋對政府都係比較有批判性」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英喜歡劉細良文章-立場比較接近民主派觀點&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英喜歡劉細良文章 立場「比較接近民主派觀點」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第七天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示陳沛敏與楊清奇之間的 WhatsApp 對話，可見陳於2020年5月8日傳送3個 Patreon 連結給楊，分別為蕭若元、劉細良和雲海。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何會傳送上述3人的 Patreon 連結，陳稱記得黎曾點名提及喜歡劉細良的文章，想邀請劉撰寫文章，所以可能會透過張劍虹問她有否劉的聯絡方法，然後她會傳送給楊清奇，因楊主理《蘋果》的論壇版。至於蕭若元和雲海，陳稱二人並非由她推薦，但是她不記得當時為何會傳送給楊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又補充，Patreon 是一個供人發表文章的平台，如果讀者想閱讀某作者的文章，需要付費才能看到；她記得當時《蘋果》正在推行付費訂閱計劃，所以想了解在 Patreon 這種付費訂閱的模式下，有哪些作者較受歡迎和吸引到讀者，而黎喜歡劉細良的文章，因此記憶中她在這個情況下提及劉的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及3名作者的文章立場，陳指劉細良是「比較接近民主派的觀點」；蕭若元「都係點評吓時政，同埋對政府都係比較有批判性」；至於雲海，陳則坦言不太認識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英參與自由廣告二次創作&quot;&gt;黎智英參與「自由」廣告二次創作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示《蘋果》2020年5月4日的頭版廣告，顯示「自由」兩個大字，其中「自」字打橫放。頭版下方寫有「當自由變成罪，我們已退無可退」、「一群香港人於一百零一年後的五四」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aBptihI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示翌日欄目「隔牆有耳」，題為〈五四運動101周年 A1集體二創〉，可見多張「自由」廣告的「二次創作」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏指，「隔牆有耳」主要刊載一些軟性或不太認真的新聞，包括政圈或議會裡的一些八卦新聞。她舉例如財政預算案並不屬於軟性新聞，但是假設財政司司長太太的服裝顏色襯托財政預算案的顏色，便可視作軟性新聞來報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指其中一幅「二次創作」的署名為黎智英，畫中可見一顆巨大紅色星星壓倒在一個老人和一個年輕人身上。報導提及：「壹傳媒創辦人黎智英亦創作佢嘅 A1，『毀我法治自由，我一無所有』，八方相信呢個肯定係大多數港人嘅心聲。」控方問黎的創作和言論又是否屬於軟性新聞，陳則指上述不是重大新聞，而這也是黎一直以來的立場，所以同事並沒有以此作正式報導。陳又指參與「二次創作」的還有一些漫畫家和意見領袖（KOL），而黎只是其中一個人物。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指報導署名是「李八方」，問陳「李八方」是誰。陳指「隔牆有耳」欄目通常由政治組同事撰稿，「八方」只是一個筆名，情況就如早前提及的「季陶」，不同的同事均會使用同一個筆名。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何政治組會用筆名來寫報導。陳指，首先「隔牆有耳」行文夾雜口語，與正統新聞報導使用書面語不同；而且政治組同事與政界朋友不時閒談，若果有一些八卦資訊或不能成為正式報導的題材，但是很有趣、「幾 juicy」，同事便會寫在「隔牆有耳」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英向陳沛敏查問彭定康語錄&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英向陳沛敏查問彭定康語錄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示陳沛敏與黎智英之間的 WhatsApp 對話紀錄，陳於2020年5月6日向黎傳送彭定康的語錄：「我感到憂慮的，不是香港的自主權會被北京剝奪，而是這項權利會一點一滴地斷送在香港某些人手裏。」其後陳又傳送「除褲放屁—多餘，多此一舉」，黎回覆：「我用了畫蛇添足。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上解釋，估計黎正在撰寫文章，期間查問彭定康上述言論的原句，以及「多此一舉」的近義詞，於是她在網絡上搜尋，然後傳送給黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示黎智英的專欄文章，刊登於2020年5月10日，題為〈無賴在摧毀香港法治〉。文中提到：「彭定康說，香港主權會一點一滴斷送在某些人手裏，信焉。」文章又提到：「我和楊森、李卓人在2月28號被拘捕，被控非法集會罪，我另加一條刑恐罪，前幾天5月5號在西九龍裁判處過堂安排審訊程序。案件主控官一直對我方說，保釋條件不換。怎知，到開庭前5分鐘主控官卻反口，對我方律師說，她將會要求法官判決禁止我出境和每星期要到警署報到，顯然開庭前主控官收到了最高指示。法官徇主控官要求，有關刑恐罪判我禁止出境和每星期到警署報到。」、「我又不是殺人放火，是輕微控罪，在法庭未審判之前，我何罪有之？我是個無罪的無辜者，法庭是根據甚麼法理禁制我出境呢？況且，這案件之輕微，本人根本不可能僭逃，主控官如此苛刻的保釋條件極不合理。這顯然是常理法理都不合規格的指控。當然是另有原因了。這原因是甚麼？無謂畫蛇添足了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，黎當時有否提到他正在撰寫文章？陳稱黎沒有詳細跟她說，也不肯定有否簡單提及過。至於黎在法庭上被施加禁止離港的保釋條件，陳指黎沒有向她提及過此事，不過有提及過與《東方》記者之間的衝突事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

An especially concerning area of research in this regard has been the possibility that Chinese economic, diplomatic, security, and political activities within the region could be contributing to the democratic backsliding witnessed in recent decades.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the precise mechanisms through which China (the People’s Republic of China, or PRC) may or may not exacerbate LAC’s ongoing democratic regression have been insufficiently studied. Key questions remain as to whether China is merely out for economic gain, exerting an unintentional downward pressure on the quality of democratic institutions, or whether certain characteristics of China’s engagement render it more corrosive to democracy than other countries. Furthermore, given the sheer variety of China’s relations in the hemisphere, there may be specific activities Beijing engages in which produce a more deleterious effect on the quality of democracy than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report seeks to investigate these questions and more fully enumerate the nature of China’s impact on democracy in LAC. It posits two independent but correlated mechanisms through which China contributes to democratic backsliding. First, the PRC propagates its model of authoritarian governance through its soft power engagements in media, education, and people-to-people diplomacy, as well as through its security assistance, which often features tools enabling mass surveillance and the curtailment of civil and political rights. Second, China protects regimes undergoing democratic backsliding by providing economic and diplomatic cover even as these governments become increasingly isolated from the rest of the international system, in effect extending these governments beyond their natural lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report proceeds to test these theories across a set of 13 case studies from the region, identifying common trends across countries that have experienced backsliding and sources of resilience within those that have retained their democratic institutions and traditions. This analysis highlights several areas where China directly contributes to backsliding, notably through its cultivation of economic dependency, which isolates governments from other sources of international support; its provision of security assistance and tools of digital authoritarianism, which allow autocratic regimes to keep their hold on power; and its role in encouraging elite capture and corruption across the hemisphere. It also identifies common trends in backsliding where China’s engagement appeared to have a more minor role, such as the tendency of authoritarian leaders to pursue the abolition of term limits, and the long-standing challenges of LAC’s historical tendency toward “imperial executives.” These findings urge nuance when discussing China’s effect on democracy in the hemisphere. To state the obvious, PRC engagement does not always contribute to backsliding where it occurs, nor will every warning sign that a democracy may be in danger contain a nexus to Beijing. Nevertheless, the findings do point to a clear role for China in encouraging and accelerating at least part of the dramatic democratic decline witnessed throughout the Western Hemisphere in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having recognized the specific risk vectors China’s engagement poses in LAC, the report seeks to articulate the beginnings of a democracy-first grand strategy for the United States to pursue. Such a strategy should proceed along the lines of the “insulate, curtail, compete” framework outlined in a previous CSIS report and pursue the following lines of effort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where Democracy Holds Fast – Insulate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adumbrate a strategy to counter economic coercion in the hemisphere:&lt;/em&gt; Even in countries that have successfully resisted or minimized the most deleterious effects of China’s influence on their democracies, the risk of China’s potential coercive influence continues to loom large. The United States should lead a regionwide effort with partner countries to review vulnerabilities in their economies that may be targeted for coercion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expand democratic partnerships:&lt;/em&gt; Core to any strategy of democracy promotion is ensuring that leaders and their citizens feel as if “democracy delivers.” The United States should leverage instruments like the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity and the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to focus on countries with strong democratic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invest in legislative strengthening and modernization:&lt;/em&gt; The United States should redouble its legislative strengthening efforts in LAC, led by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) alongside party institutions like the National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, with a focus on sharing strategies for identifying disinformation, enhancing cybersecurity, and developing public databases and tools for citizens to better follow the progress of legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where Democracy Has Dissipated – Curtail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Develop early warning indicators:&lt;/em&gt; The United States should develop and articulate a clear set of indicators to identify democratic backsliding while it is in progress and also strive to build support around these indicators with like-minded countries in the hemisphere to leverage more voices speaking out against cases of backsliding. An excellent recent example of early warning and action transpired in Guatemala to counter the undemocratic actions of those who sought to prevent then president-elect Bernardo Arévalo from assuming office.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disrupt authoritarian networks:&lt;/em&gt; The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) should be the designated lead on an investigation into sources of financial flows between hemispheric dictatorships and external authoritarian regimes to map key nodes and the actors responsible for bankrolling these governments. The OFAC can also specifically investigate Chinese firms operating in the Western Hemisphere’s dictatorships and consider imposing new sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for profiting off illicit economic activity or assisting these governments to repress their populations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Develop proactive strategies for countering digital authoritarianism:&lt;/em&gt; A fortified strategy against authoritarian mis- and disinformation campaigns should work to connect civil society and democracy advocates across sectors. The United States should also invest in the development of new technologies to provide internet access in countries where governments seek to cut off web access to hinder mass mobilization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where Democracy Is Unsure – Compete&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bring in the private sector:&lt;/em&gt; The DFC should seek to bolster ties to businesses to learn what these firms need and fine-tune its approach to buying down risk so that private enterprise can better engage in key countries. Congress should also communicate a clear mandate for the DFC to pursue projects of strategic and national security relevance during the BUILD Act reauthorization process in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prioritize citizen security:&lt;/em&gt; The United States should put forward a clear counteroffer to China’s Global Security Initiative, led by U.S. law enforcement agencies and the State Department’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. This strategy has a natural test bed in the form of the recently inaugurated partnership between the United States and Ecuador to help the latter country counter mounting criminal violence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double down on core competencies in education, defense, and disaster response:&lt;/em&gt; While there are many sectors in which the United States will struggle to compete with the PRC for influence, it is important to appreciate the significant advantages Washington already holds and to take steps to extend this lead. Investing in foreign educational exchange, professional military education, and diplomatic initiatives to allow faster U.S. deployment in the wake of natural disasters are all important efforts to extend the United States’ lead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the international context appears increasingly riven by great power competition, conflict, and coercion, it can be tempting to cast democracy as an ancillary concern for the United States. Such an approach fails to recognize the strategic value of democracy for the United States generally and especially in LAC, where shared democratic values can be a powerful source of unity and translate into major dividends in the form of economic security and diplomatic cooperation. The fact that China’s engagement in the hemisphere appears to target these very same democratic values should be regarded as a strategic threat, demanding a comprehensive, resource-backed counterstrategy from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-tool-kit&quot;&gt;China’s Tool Kit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, going from a largely peripheral actor, China has taken center stage in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Today, China is LAC’s second-largest trade partner overall, and it has supplanted the United States in several keystone countries throughout the hemisphere. China is the largest trading partner for nearly every country in South America. Although China’s engagement is principally economic, it stretches far beyond trade alone — especially in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From educational exchanges to military-to-military cooperation, arms sales, policing assistance, and high-level diplomatic mechanisms such as the China-CELAC Forum, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has been advancing rapidly on multiple fronts. This concerted effort has already paid dividends for Beijing. Since the arrival of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the hemisphere in 2017, 22 countries have signed up to the initiative, and five countries have dropped their diplomatic recognition of Taiwan for the PRC in the same timeframe. Regional leaders also increasingly view the United States and China as equal players — and, in many cases, large powers to be played off one another. Brazilian president Luis Inácio “Lula” da Silva, for instance, followed up his first meeting with President Biden with a trip to China, a pattern observed by a number of other regional leaders from Colombia to Argentina. Indeed, the popularity of the “active nonalignment” foreign policy doctrine among LAC countries espouses that countries within the hemisphere should seek to remain distant from Washington and Beijing alike — if not always equidistant — reaping benefits from a competition between the two powers while remaining unencumbered by great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kgVmaAX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to its proponents, active nonalignment promises to deliver gains to the region as both the United States and China compete to woo countries with trade, investment, and diplomacy. LAC, these advocates point out, has little to gain from picking sides. Its geographic and historical closeness to the United States means the region is well-positioned to benefit from the nearshoring of key Western companies looking to de-risk supply chains by locating these in a region that promises to be far from the center of a future global conflagration. Simultaneously, China’s continued demand for resources — especially in the agricultural sector, minerals markets, and power generation sectors, where the United States is often seen more as competitor than collaborator — means shunning Beijing will do little but close off a consumer market of 1.4 billion people. However, by seeking to keep LAC far from the center of geopolitics, active nonalignment risks relegating these countries to the status of afterthought, preventing them from attracting the kinds of external engagement needed to tackle the profound challenges the region faces in terms of climate change, security, and economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a political project of nonalignment or geopolitical (equi)distance from the United States and China relies on two key assumptions that deserve greater interrogation. First, that LAC countries can pick and choose which types of engagement they permit, and second, that there is no significant qualitative difference between U.S. and Chinese engagement. There is reason for healthy skepticism, as the PRC has been linked to a concerning trend of democratic backsliding both within the hemisphere and on a global scale. Accordingly, not only does the region run a risk of being left on the geopolitical periphery, but also, in failing to critically interrogate the strategies and approaches of outside powers, countries may find their fundamental political structures shaped in part by these external forces — the very thing active nonalignment purports to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before assessing the potential for such a phenomenon, however, this report first outlines the myriad economic, diplomatic, and security initiatives that comprise China’s tool kit for its engagement in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-beef-to-the-belt-and-road&quot;&gt;From Beef to the Belt and Road&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s foremost means of engagement, and the approach for which Beijing has most carefully honed its tool kit, is undoubtedly in the trade and economic sphere. Here it is worth noting not only the dramatic expansion of China’s economic ties to the region but also the sheer diversity of this engagement. In such varied sectors as minerals, telecommunications, electricity production and transmission, and agriculture, China has established itself as an essential player in many LAC economies. China’s economic engagement is driven by both demand for resources and strategic pursuit of influence. In the first place, achieving the CCP’s stated goal of having China become a developed and prosperous country by 2049 will hinge upon preserving market access for Chinese businesses, especially its large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that often drive key development projects. In this respect, LAC is an especially critical region: not only does it possess many of the raw materials and resources needed to fuel China’s industrial development, but the relatively developed and prosperous state of LAC economies means these countries are prime destinations for finished, value-added products from the PRC’s manufacturing base. Even more ambitiously, as Chinese businesses have grown and matured, they have increasingly looked to internationalize their operations. Such developments can already be observed with recent Chinese forays into the LAC electric vehicle market, with PRC state-owned company BYD announcing plans to open an battery and car manufacturing center in Brazil. In fact, the announcement carried significant symbolism, as BYD will establish a presence in Salvador, the capital of Bahia state, at a plant that was formerly one of the hubs of Ford’s operations in Brazil. As welcome as these developments may be, they do run the risk of aggravating relations between China and LAC countries. LAC countries see themselves getting the worse end of the bargain: exporting their resources to China at bargain prices and importing finished goods without capturing the remainder of the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the objective of such engagement is to forge durable connections between the interests of the PRC and those of LAC countries. In doing so, Chinese statements tend to highlight collaboration being “win-win” in nature, or mutually beneficial. Yet, while such economic ties have yielded important gains for many countries, there remain important questions regarding the sectors that perhaps ought to be better insulated against PRC influence. One such example is energy generation and distribution, a strategic sector that is vital to for everyday life and industrial development alike, which is often most noticeable when lacking. Chinese state-owned power companies have expanded their presence throughout South America, with Chinese companies owning or partially owning approximately 10 percent of Brazil’s generation capacity and the Chinese firm State Grid now owning a majority of Chile’s power distribution infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closely tied to energy is China’s presence in the mining sector across LAC. Thanks to its predominance in global mineral smelting and refining infrastructure, even countries with ample mineral resources of their own often find it more advantageous to ship unprocessed or partially processed materials to China for reexport. However, Chinese companies have not contented themselves with serving as domestic smelters and refiners. Rather, Chinese mining companies have established a powerful footprint throughout the hemisphere in the extraction process. In some places, this has been seemingly at the expense of democratic institutions and transparency. Most notably in Argentina, where provincial governors constitutionally wield authority over the mineral resources located within their territories, Chinese firms have proven adept at courting the leaders of key lithium-rich provinces in the northwest, pursuing a strategy known as “going local.” China’s aggressive lobbying strategy has paid dividends, allowing companies like Ganfeng Lithium to win majority shares in major mining projects. In response, Argentine provincial elites have sought to restructure local laws to make their regions more attractive to Chinese business — and to the lavish courtship these firms bring. This trend came to a head in June 2023 when Jujuy Province erupted into protests against proposed changes to the province’s constitution that would both make it easier for foreign companies to expand lithium projects and increase penalties for public protest. Such measures are emblematic in turn of China’s strategy to co-opt local elites in order to circumvent potentially time-consuming red tape at the national level, as well as of the unintended effects this can have on local democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telecommunications constitute a third important sector where China has leveraged a competitive advantage vis-à-vis the United States into a strategically relevant connection to the region. Whereas many U.S. allies have pursued de-risking efforts when it comes to firms such as Huawei and ZTE, as their connection to CCP surveillance and espionage efforts abroad have become increasingly apparent, LAC has largely bucked this trend. Today, Huawei operates over a dozen cloud data centers across LAC, and it has made inroads as far as Mexico, where, according to one Huawei executive, “the probability that you make a phone call that goes through a Huawei device is very high, over 80%.” The dubious history of many Chinese telecommunications firms poses an implicit risk to LAC countries’ security, as well as an explicit geopolitical risk: China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law requires that all companies based in China support “state intelligence work,” meaning that a potential treasure trove of data could be at the CCP’s fingertips provided it was deemed pertinent to state security issues. Furthermore, the track record of PRC firms with intellectual property theft bodes ill for LAC companies looking to break into the global market. Even with proper financial incentives provided by the United States, for countries that have built the backbone of their digital networks upon PRC-provided equipment, “rip-and-replace” is often not a feasible policy, ensuring that China will continue to have a large say in these countries’ digital sector development for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to trade and business-to-business ties, China’s status as the world’s largest single source of development finance adds a powerful and complementary instrument to the tool kit of economic influence. In particular, Chinese lending has focused on large-scale infrastructure projects, which the United States and U.S.-influenced multilateral financial institutions often decline to support. This has allowed China to amass an impressive portfolio of ports, dams, bridges, roads, and railways throughout LAC, the kind of strategic infrastructure that engenders dual-use concerns but also speaks to the development ambitions of many countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, promises of large-scale infrastructure projects are instrumental in enticing diplomatic allies of Taiwan to switch their recognition to the PRC. In the most recent case of Honduras, for example, the switch was accompanied swiftly by negotiations for Chinese financing of the Patuca II hydroelectric dam. Although China’s domestic economic slowdown — and the estimated $1 trillion in outstanding debt owed to the PRC from BRI projects — has inculcated a sense of caution among Beijing’s development finance institutions, it would be erroneous to assume that China does not see the value in continuing its strategic lending. Chinese lending to LAC quadrupled from about $200 million in 2021 to over $800 million in 2022 — a far cry from the heady days of Chinese investment in the early 2010s, but nevertheless a sign that Beijing continues to view LAC as a region of strategic import.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the sheer scale of Chinese trade and investment into LAC and its strategic efforts in key sectors have granted Beijing a wide range of levers through which to influence the region. While this influence has not yet produced an incident comparable to the seizure of Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port, there are already concerning signs that China’s economic leverage in certain countries may be capable of eroding their policy autonomy and sovereignty. Ecuador, which still owes some $5 billion in outstanding debt (largely in loans taken out during the presidency of Rafael Correa, from 2007 to 2017), is a particularly illustrative case. Saddled with the burden of an unsustainable debt load to China, which has yielded comparatively minor economic gains, and a series of infrastructure projects implemented under dubious conditions and often behind schedule or amid serious environmental or social contention, three successive administrations in Ecuador have struggled to free themselves from debt service obligations to China. Worldwide, Chinese development assistance efforts have often produced similarly troubling results, with an analysis by AidData finding that every dollar of Chinese spending generates nine dollars in debt. This has forced the Ecuadorean government to continue selling oil to Beijing at sub-market rates, despite attempts to diversify the country’s economy away from hydrocarbons or reinvest the proceeds into Ecuador’s domestic development. This case indicates the durability of economic influence (through leverage) used by China in LAC. The composition of a government matters little; if a country’s economic fortunes can be tied sufficiently to the will of Beijing, it will have little choice but to cooperate with the PRC in important matters, even after the initial honeymoon phase of engagement has subsided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-lac-safe-for-the-ccp&quot;&gt;Making LAC Safe for the CCP&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s success in people-to-people diplomacy has attracted much attention, but an often less prominent instrument of influence in the CCP’s tool kit has been party-to-party engagement. This work is spearheaded by the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China (ILD), which has hosted over 300 exchanges with nearly 75 political parties across LAC from 2002 to 2017. These engagements help to socialize China’s model of governance throughout the hemisphere and further enhance relations with current and future state leaders. The ILD’s status as a party — rather than state — instrument also allows it to engage countries that are officially diplomatic allies of Taiwan rather than the PRC. Indeed, according to one study, the ILD has led party exchanges in Guatemala, Honduras, and Haiti all while these countries remained Taiwanese diplomatic allies on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing sector for PRC engagement in LAC is in the security and defense sphere. Such engagement is driven by the CCP’s vision of internationalizing domestic security issues — in other words, ensuring that Beijing has the tools to curb developments abroad perceived as having the ability to affect China’s internal order. Such a vision is epitomized by the Global Security Initiative (GSI), inaugurated by Xi Jinping in April of 2022. This includes a proliferation of Chinese overseas police outposts — which can now be found across LAC according to watchdog organization Safeguard Defenders — as well as a rise in the number of private security companies (PSCs) often brought in to protect Chinese nationals and economic interests alike. At least eight countries throughout LAC are reported to play host to some presence from Chinese PSCs, from Peru, where China Security Technology Group has lent its services in protecting mining investments, to Mexico, where the “Mexico-Chinese Security Council” emerged comparatively organically in response to threats from gangs against members of the Chinese business community there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the proliferation of PSCs and overseas police outposts throughout the Western Hemisphere has been driven by China’s efforts to protect its own investments, interests, and domestic security, it is also a response to a perception throughout LAC that external assistance is necessary for countries to effectively grapple with the public safety challenges posed by resurgent transnational criminal groups. As long as LAC continues to represent only about 8 percent of global population but nearly one third of global homicides, there will be a strong domestic desire for technologies and strategies that can make streets, parks, and public transport safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has proven adept at using this perception — and the United States’ comparative lack of a substantial presence in citizen security efforts — to bolster its ties with national police forces. China has conducted at least a dozen bilateral exchanges between senior police leadership in LAC and its own internal security services, and it has led at least 10 trainings for police forces throughout the region. Especially concerning is the fact that China has engaged in several capacity-building activities with police forces accused of gross human rights abuses. This includes the Cuban police, responsible for the suppression of mass protests in the summer of 2021, as well as the Nicaraguan National Police, a force which China has delivered arms and equipment to and which is under international sanction for its role in brutally crushing popular demonstrations starting in 2018. Just as China often serves as a lender of last resort to countries isolated from global financial or business markets, so too is it rapidly emerging as a security partner for authoritarian regimes, willing to help augment the capabilities of these governments to maintain control over their populations through surveillance and brute force alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s trade and investment strategy has also paid dividends in the security and defense space, most notably in the form of China’s control of port infrastructure throughout the hemisphere. Maritime ports owned or operated by China often serve dual civilian and military uses. They are instrumental nodes of trade and commerce in peacetime, but in moments of crisis or conflict, they could provide an array of military advantages. Most directly, PRC-built ports around the world have been built to specifications, particularly the berth of docking spaces, allowing warships to dock and conduct resupply. Such capabilities are essential, as the PLA looks to transform itself from a force with limited regional power-projection capabilities to a military capable of global expeditionary operations with a true “blue water” navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of directly supplying ships, however, China’s grip over key LAC ports is a powerful intelligence-gathering tool. Port operators have access to critical data on the origins, destinations, and types of cargo moving through their docks: vital information for the PRC to understand supply chain shifts, demand for certain types of resources, and, in the case of ports along maritime chokepoints like the Panama Canal or Strait of Magellan, the location of military vessels en route from Atlantic to Pacific. Crucially, this form of influence does not require China to have an active military presence in the Western Hemisphere, a development which would surely inflame tensions with the United States and even backfire in terms of China’s relationship with the region. Instead, leveraging this data would simply require invocation of the National Intelligence Law to compel port operators to turn over defense-relevant data to Beijing, thereby granting China a passive capability close to the epicenter of U.S. military activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has made additional forays into forms of engagement traditionally thought of as defense cooperation. Amid Russian defense industrial shortfalls, China has surged to become the world’s fifth-largest arms supplier, with countries in LAC such as Bolivia and Venezuela purchasing substantial quantities of Chinese arms already. The recent row over Argentina’s consideration of the JF-17, a joint Pakistani-Chinese fighter jet, for its air force illustrates the growing efforts by China to internationalize its arms industry. This also includes professional military education, where China has been making strides to displace the United States from its long-held role as primary source of foreign training and assistance to LAC militaries. China has pursued a concerted strategy in this regard to overmatch the United States in quantity (though certainly not quality, for the time being) of training provided. Whereas U.S. service academies may have billets for just a handful of officers from a given LAC country, institutions like the China National Defense University will accept delegations of a dozen officers or more for instruction, often centered around sectors of particular import to the PLA such as cybersecurity. Furthermore, this professional military education is essential for identifying and cultivating talent among junior officers, many of whom will eventually rise to senior positions in their home militaries where they may be in positions to shape opinion and policy toward the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, while China’s security and defense engagement has a long way to go before it achieves the same level of maturity as its economic efforts, expansion in this sector is potentially even more concerning from a U.S. perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;winning-hearts-and-minds&quot;&gt;Winning Hearts and Minds&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China has garnered a reputation for “coercive diplomacy” resulting from its strong-arm economic policies — such as trade restrictions and tariffs on countries that challenge it and the use of vaccine exports as a tool for influence — it has sought to mitigate these perceptions by promoting a number of exchanges, aimed in particular at students, academics, and others, with the power to shape public opinion. China has made forays into humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), a realm where the United States has long served as the region’s primary contact for emergency assistance. Thus far, China’s efforts have remained limited, concentrated around deployments of PLAN hospital ship Peace Ark, which visited the region in 2011 and 2018; however, the soft power dividends from such activities cannot be understated, and as China seeks to cultivate an armed force with global ambitions its transoceanic HADR activities are likely to only grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The China-CELAC Forum has been an instrumental tool in this regard, with the forum’s 2019–2021 action plan committing China to providing some 6,000 scholarships for students from LAC to attend Chinese educational institutions. The subsequent 2022–2024 plan expanded upon this target with 5,000 scholarships pledged, in addition to 3,000 spots in training and trade programs. By contrast, the U.S. Fulbright Scholarship covers about 700 students from LAC pursuing studies in the United States. To be sure, U.S. academic institutions remain more highly regarded in the aggregate, and prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, over 70,000 students from LAC were reported to attend U.S. institutions. However, China’s emphasis on scholarships means that for many middle- and working-class families throughout LAC, the doors of U.S. institutions appear out of reach while those of the PRC are opening ever wider. As with professional military education, individuals who study in a country are liable to view their host country favorably, while the academic contributions of international students, especially in the hard sciences, cannot be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within LAC, China has promoted its Confucius Institutes at a number of regional universities. An estimated 44 institutes and 18 more affiliated Confucius classrooms are scattered across LAC’s academies. As China has increased its presence in LAC countries’ business environments, Confucius Institutes have come to serve as important centers for language learning and instruction in Mandarin, important skills for a student interested in pursuing a career that may have them engaging closely with Chinese firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, with their advance across the hemisphere, many Chinese companies have taken strides to provide technical training and skill-building programs. Huawei has been prolific with such efforts, establishing “Huawei Academies” in partnership with regional universities aiming to help prepare students for careers in business and the information and communications technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huawei also inaugurated a new partnership with the Mexican Agency of International Cooperation for Development, intended to train start-ups in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru on cloud computing technology. While these programs are not explicitly aimed at accreting geopolitical influence, they complement China’s economic engagement and its goals of tethering the fate and interests of LAC countries to Beijing’s own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;over-the-airwaves&quot;&gt;Over the Airwaves&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soft power turns “sharp” when applied to China’s forays into media training and journalism. China has made a concerted effort to recruit and train cohorts of journalists from around the world within its borders. These programs come with a heavy emphasis on exposure to Chinese society and culture, and for many up-and-coming journalists they may represent their first ever international experience. With many smaller news sources in LAC facing staffing shortfalls and a dearth of resources, journalists trained abroad tend to have an edge for plush positions, meaning comparatively small investments by the PRC can yield sustained benefits as these journalists advance in their careers. Furthermore, with the region facing a shortage of China experts, often those individuals trained in China will be the sole voice, or one of a handful of voices, speaking in the media on China-LAC relations. In addition to helping demystify China for these journalists, attendees have reported that training focused on encouraging positive coverage of government policy, under a vision that reporting should be a tool to unify a country rather than divide it and that it should tell the story of the state’s role in a country’s development. Such allegations suggest that China may be seeking to export a vision of journalistic standards that departs markedly from U.S. training programs, which tend to emphasize journalistic ethics, investigative reporting, and the role of the media as a check on government power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC has also tapped members of the Chinese diaspora in LAC to further propagate its preferred narratives and shape opinion among these constituencies. According to Freedom House, China exerts a strong influence in the diaspora media space of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Panama, and Peru, providing a wide variety of state-sponsored news products aimed at these groups. Chinese diaspora media influence potentially reaches hundreds of thousands of viewers throughout these countries, who may in turn be more likely to promulgate CCP narratives within their local communities. Such efforts, in addition to overt propaganda spreading, form part of China’s “United Front” strategy intended to create ideological sympathies between the PRC and key actors throughout LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with this strategy, China has also made efforts to expand the reach of its China Global Television Network (CGTN) to help shape the narrative on issues implicating China, the United States, and the region. China’s main goal with CGTN is to run light propaganda efforts and counter anti-China narratives. Content-sharing agreements in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela allow CGTN to expand its local reach. Finally, China is deploying increasingly sophisticated social media strategies, often masking the state-affiliated nature of its accounts to present content as home-grown, thereby increasing the receptivity and reach for LAC audiences. The case of Russia, which has pursued a similar strategy of media influence in LAC spearheaded by state news agencies and a legion of social media accounts tied to Moscow, offers a concerning portent of the ways in which China could escalate from seeking to shape media narratives to actively fomenting conflict through its platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-question-of-strategy&quot;&gt;A Question of Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to the PRC’s efforts, the United States has failed to take stock of its full tool kit for engaging with LAC, instead pursuing a comparatively disjointed and inconsistent strategy. This has been driven in part by the reality of pressing crises elsewhere that have demanded U.S. attention and resources. Nevertheless, given the central role LAC plays in U.S. national security, Washington remains on the back foot regarding competition with China in the Western Hemisphere. For decades, U.S. strategy was guided by the framework of “strategic denial,” a policy which aimed to, in the words of one author, “prevent major rivals from developing regional footholds from which they can menace, distract, or otherwise undercut the strategic interests of the United States.” Today, with China deeply entrenched across a number of fronts, from minerals to telecommunications, energy, and agriculture, preventing an extra-hemispheric adversary from developing a foothold within LAC appears a far-fetched prospect. Rather, U.S. strategy must recalibrate and identify those areas where Chinese engagement does not have deleterious impact, those where it should be insulated against, those where it should be curtailed, and those where the United States can be a more competent competitor for LAC’s interests. In doing so, the United States should reflect upon its formidable advantages when it comes to engaging with the region. Unlike its competitors, the United States is not separated from LAC by an ocean and enjoys close geographic proximity to much of the region. The bulk of U.S. free trade architecture is with LAC countries, and decades of trade and economic integration have forged important bonds with LAC. However, perhaps one of the key assets for the United States when contemplating a world defined by competition with China is the democratic character of LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/q44Pl8m.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: U.S. vs PRC Investment in LAC, 2000–2019.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dfc.gov/our-impact/reports&quot;&gt;“Reports,” Development Finance Corporation&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedialogue.org/map_list/&quot;&gt;Margaret Myers and Rebecca Ray, “China-Latin America Finance Databases,” The Inter-American Dialogue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the region is unique in that, following the 2001 adoption of the Inter-American Democratic Charter, shared commitment to democracy has been an organizing principle of many LAC countries. This provides an important set of shared values for the United States to relate to its allies in LAC, values that diverge substantially from those held by the PRC. It is telling in this regard that China’s staunchest allies in LAC are not democracies, but the three fully fledged dictatorships of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. For this reason, understanding whether China’s engagement — or a subset of the tool kit described above — is associated with increased democratic backsliding is of vital importance for the United States and its future approach to LAC. Without a robust and well-resourced strategy to counter such forms of deleterious engagement, the United States may find itself rapidly losing its most important tether to a region whose shared commitment to democracy has long been a pillar of U.S. and hemispheric stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-theory-of-antidemocratic-diffusion&quot;&gt;The Theory of Antidemocratic Diffusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the mid-1970s and accelerating through subsequent decades, a wave of democratization washed over the globe. By 1993, for the first time in history a majority of states in the international system were democracies. This phenomenon was deemed the “third wave of democratization,” most notably by political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, whose work traced the origins of this dramatic expansion of democracy to the end of the Cold War and the ascendancy of the democratic United States as the sole global superpower. Yet while democracy’s third wave was perhaps its most impressive in terms of the number of people and countries swept up in its current, it has also proven its most vulnerable. Over the past two decades, the third wave of democratization has struggled, first against a democratic recession and more recently against a sustained and widespread pattern of democratic backsliding, with some questioning the onset of a “third reverse wave.” This has been on full display within LAC, where, at the time of the IADC’s signing, just one country in the region could be counted as a true dictatorship. In the span of 20 years, two new full-blown authoritarian regimes have emerged, Venezuela and Nicaragua, while a number of countries today appear at the precipice of accompanying them down the path to dictatorship. Democratic backsliding need not be so dramatic as a leader seizing power at gunpoint. The decision of several leaders from Mexico to Honduras — and nearly Argentina and Peru — to boycott the 2022 Summit of the Americas over the failure to invite representatives from the three regional dictatorships speaks to an increasingly frayed enthusiasm for democracy across the very region that once served as its standard-bearer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lAVzxO5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: The Democratic Regression in LAC.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/democracy-index-2022/&quot;&gt;“Democracy Index 2022,” Economist Intelligence Unit, 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characteristics of this third reverse wave are manifold. Literature on its causes can range from the proliferation of the internet and algorithmic social media (which increases polarization and makes voters more susceptible to authoritarian rhetoric) to globalization’s effect on national economies, exacerbation of wealth inequality, and the perceived failure of democracies to manage significant societal disruptions. That said, three general trends can be discovered from the spate of backsliding cases over the past two decades. First, the phenomenon of elected autocrats has overtaken coups as the principal mechanism through which once-democratic countries have become dictatorships. Second, modern-day autocrats are increasingly explicit in their borrowing of strategies and tactics for maintaining power from one another, suggesting the growth of a so-called dictator’s playbook shared between like-minded regimes. Finally, as Huntington recognized in documenting democracy’s third wave, geopolitics exert a profound effect on models of domestic governance. Huntington found that major changes in the international order were correlated with shifts in domestic governance systems. Just as the rise of U.S. hegemony presaged a democratic expansion, today’s increasing great power competition between the United States and authoritarian rivals has witnessed a recession in global democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, this form of democratic backsliding creates numerous opportunities for existing dictatorships to bring new members into their club. Rather than backing armed groups in all-or-nothing coups or electoral scams that impose high reputational costs if exposed, autocrats can play the long game, exerting influence throughout a range of areas from news media to economic development and business relations. Accordingly, accurately charting, predicting, and counteracting the various avenues through which democratic backsliding occurs is of the utmost importance for the United States, allies, and civil society actors. The acuteness of the problem has in turn produced a flurry of analyses purporting to explain its ascendancy, either in whole or in part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-state-of-the-art&quot;&gt;The State of the Art&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of democratic backsliding has birthed an impressive variety of theories seeking to explain it. Some of the earliest theories of the “third reverse wave” include a 2015 article by democracy scholar Larry Diamond entitled “Facing Up to the Democratic Recession.” Diamond identifies democratic regression not merely in the binary conversion of democracies into autocracies but also in a global decline in civil liberties and the rule of law, a retrenchment of authoritarianism in already autocratic states, and a weakening of enthusiasm for democracy promotion among Western countries. The following year, Nancy Bermeo’s article “On Democratic Backsliding” noted the decline in revolutionary and otherwise bare-faced coups d’état in the post–Cold War context. In their place, Bermeo noted the rise of “promissory coups,” which pledge a return to democracy following the seizure of power, and the tendency of modern-day autocrats to cloak themselves in the garb of democracy and so-called anti-imperialism. Within LAC, Venezuela perhaps best exemplifies this trend. Despite the Maduro regime’s control over virtually all levers of state power, capture of electoral and judicial institutions, and intimidation and imprisonment of political opponents, formal opposition parties are still allowed to persist and stand for election, providing an occasional patina of democracy. While the recent disqualification of candidates ahead of Venezuela’s 2024 presidential elections clearly signals the regime is unwilling to brook a serious electoral challenge to its power, the posturing from Caracas signals a government that still wishes to reap the benefits to its international reputation of being seen as nominally democratic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent studies continued to explore the characteristics of the modern third reverse wave. These included a growing debate on the role of social media and the internet. Once seen as a tool for liberation and democratization, some scholars have noted that authoritarian and would-be authoritarian regimes have successfully co-opted digital tools to further their control, be it through mass online surveillance, dissemination of false and misleading narratives, or the increasing use of spyware to track and target dissidents. Other scholars turned to the previous waves of democratization for answers, contending that political transitions which failed to effectively consolidate would be at risk of seeing those gains reversed in short order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Lührman and Lindberg identify in their 2019 article, the manner in which this new form of autocratization takes hold has been insufficiently conceptualized and operationalized. In other words, while it is possible to catalogue the distinctive features of modern-day autocratization, there is a pressing need to develop theories of how and why democracies fall into patterns of backsliding. Within this discussion there is, in turn, a gap in understanding how international factors and autocratic powers support backsliding within democratic states — sometimes purposively, sometimes unwittingly. Indeed, studies that have attempted to operationalize a theory of democratic backsliding have by and large focused almost entirely on domestic political forces. And yet, the role of international authoritarian networks is an increasingly vital piece of the puzzle. Modern-day dictatorships often coordinate either formally or informally to help one another remain in power, and even absent material assistance, autocrats often borrow from each other’s scripts when it comes to maintaining social control. Venezuela and Nicaragua provide excellent examples here, as they borrow elements of Putin’s laws against civil society and stiflingly arbitrary views on “cybercrime.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even within LAC, analysts and observers have emphasized domestic forces even when evidence of international authoritarian alliances and authoritarian learning has abounded. Explanations for why democracy appears — in the words of one author — to be “limping instead of sprinting” in LAC emphasize literature on democratic consolidation. Under this reading, several LAC countries have struggled to meaningfully remedy corruption, impunity, and uneven access to justice and representation, leaving them open to populist authoritarian leadership that promises radical change at the expense of civil and political rights. More recently, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the overall abysmal response of regional governments, further reinforced perceptions that democracy failed to deliver for the basic needs of citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors are undoubtedly powerful drivers of LAC’s current democratic recession. But they are not incompatible with a view of backsliding that accounts for external actors and developments on the international stage — and in particular, how global politics interacts with domestic politics. Indeed, shifts in the global balance of power are meaningful, and they exert both overt and covert influences on the political models that leaders around the world perceive as ascendant and worthy of emulation. As LAC countries confront monumental challenges, from corruption to inequality and entrenched criminal networks, they are looking outward as much as they are looking inward for not just material assistance but also frameworks for order and security. Unlike at the end of the Cold War, when liberal democracy appeared ascendant, there are now counteroffers vying for control and influence in the hemisphere. Among these, few other actors have been as successful in manifesting an alternative model to democratic capitalism in such a comparatively brief amount of time as China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;propagation-and-protection&quot;&gt;Propagation and Protection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report hypothesizes that China’s engagement in LAC encourages democratic backsliding along two key directions: propagation of authoritarian principles and protection of backsliding governments from the consequences of their actions. This enables authoritarian or semi-authoritarian regimes to persist in the face of external — usually regional — pressure to reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propagation&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the means by which China seeks to encourage the adoption of authoritarian political systems through its international relations. In this regard, it is perhaps the most misunderstood vector through which China contributes to democratic backsliding. Indeed, China’s engagement across LAC suggests that it does not condition its engagement on whether a country is democratic or autocratic. Yet even if the PRC is agnostic as to the types of regimes it engages with, this does not mean that Beijing does not prefer certain types of governments and would like to these see those types of regimes proliferate throughout the region. Indeed, as a number of scholars of great power politics and democracy alike have argued, states consistently seek to sow their own governance models well beyond their borders. Kevin Narizny, for instance, contends that the spread of democracy throughout the world is conditioned upon Anglo-American primacy within the international system, as both the United Kingdom and later United States sought to promote their political models abroad among their colonies, clients, and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While under Deng Xiaoping, China pursued a strategy known famously as “biding time” and “hiding strength,” this policy has changed drastically under Xi Jinping. Whereas China was once reticent to admit there was a “China model,” it has recently become more vocal about its domestic model as an alternative to Western liberal democracy. This forms the basis for the PRC’s “discursive competition,” which takes explicit aim at concepts such as international civil and political rights while promoting the primacy of collective rights in line with the CCP’s centralized and state-driven model for economic and social development. China has promoted its discursive competition in LAC, most visibly in reports from individuals who have attended trainings hosted by the PRC. Journalists, for instance, have noted that the Chinese trainings encourage favorable coverage of the state, while in the military dimension, SOUTHCOM has reported that at least one of China’s trainings has sought to discourage participants from seeing the United States as an effective security partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GSI perhaps best embodies China’s evolving perception of its role in world affairs. The initiative professes to merge questions of domestic and international security, “coordinating between China’s domestic security and the common security of the world.” As one analyst notes, the GSI seeks “security at home, influence abroad.” Yet while the GSI espouses a universal vision, the flavor of implementation is decidedly in line with the CCP model of social control and, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, “provides a classical Chinese solution” to the problems of global instability. Indeed, China’s contributions to civil security in the hemisphere have stressed mass surveillance and the proliferation of Chinese overseas police stations and PSCs. China’s international policing activities have similarly been used not only to crack down on criminal organizations but to engage in transnational repression by capturing and repatriating dissidents and critics of the CCP abroad. Expanding this public security approach to the world risks exporting a similar model of restricted civil and political rights, as well as the accretion of power in the hands of governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, propagation has its limits. It does not imply that China is actively and constantly seeking to convert the countries it interacts with to autocracy. Indeed, the bulk of China’s engagement with LAC is filtered through the lens of economic interest. But propagation does not require active intent to transpire, and many countries have seen their democratic health and political stability thrown into tumult as an unintended consequence of engaging with China. Political economist Albert Hirschman has argued that trade ties between countries over time can foster alignment among the foreign policy systems of the trading countries. Given China’s impressive role in trade with the region, it is reasonable to see how LAC countries might gradually mold themselves to become amenable to Beijing’s vision of world order, even without the CCP expressing a clear preference for a certain regime type. At the sub-national level, for instance, the presence of PRC companies can fuel corruption among local mayors and governors, who use revenues and funds extracted from foreign firms to remain in power. Chinese firms do not necessarily intend to undermine local democracy; rather, they may merely wish to have productive relations with the political power brokers responsible for regulatory compliance and security near their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unintended consequence of this, however, can be the exacerbation of an acute crisis of democracy at the local level in many countries. Certainly, even if China has no interest in spreading its political model, certain individuals within the region do have an interest in mimicking the PRC. From business leaders who marvel at the rapid growth of China’s economy, to public safety officials searching for answers to crime and violence, to elected officials eager to cement their legacies with China-financed development projects, the notion that China presents a model of governance worthy of replicating has spread in the past two decades. Perhaps the best summation of this sentiment comes from Venezuelan governor and Maduro ally Rafael Lacava, who on a November 2023 visit to Shanghai stated, “We are in a transition and that transition looks toward the Chinese model. That’s why I’m here, that’s why the president sent me here and that’s why the president has come so many times.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the manner by which China helps to “lock in” authoritarian regimes that emerge primarily as a result of endogenous factors. In these cases, rather than China propagating authoritarian ideas abroad, a country has already ventured down the path of democratic backsliding with little to no influence from Beijing. Yet as the country’s leadership increasingly faces mounting domestic and international pressure (from human rights bodies, restricted channels of global commerce, sanctions regimes, etc.), it often turns to China as a powerful extra-hemispheric patron to help navigate the pitfalls of running a dictatorship. One particularly salient example is that of Nicaragua, which until 2021 maintained no official relations with the PRC on account of its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. Thus, the brutal crackdown in 2018 when the Ortega-Murillo regime murdered hundreds of protesters, and subsequent waves of political repression, cannot be directly attributed to PRC propagation. The regime’s decision to drop its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan and negotiate a free trade agreement with China in record time has been viewed by most analysts as a calculated step to insulate the regime from economic pressure by trading an ally with robust liberal democratic institutions for an authoritarian state. Even though China evinces no preference when it comes to regime type, authoritarian-minded leaders throughout LAC have come to bet on the PRC as their partner of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protection may also account for another phenomenon: authoritarian resilience and sharing. Many of these theories look to China itself as an autocratic regime that has successfully weathered the storms of economic liberalization, globalization, and more recently a wave of pandemic-induced social upheaval. This literature also notes that attention should be paid to “deepening autocratization in already authoritarian countries.” Here the role of external allies is especially important to help empower and extend the lifespan of autocratic regimes beyond their natural lifecycle. China has extended its patronage to all three of the Western Hemisphere’s consolidated dictatorships, in forms ranging from economic support and assistance with sanctions evasion to technology transfers, allowing regimes to wield the tools of digital authoritarianism with greater finesse and at scale. In Cuba, China works with Havana to block internet access for dissenters, and, according to recent reports, it offered a multibillion-dollar bailout to help the Cuban regime recover from its economic woes in exchange for greater access to military basing infrastructure on the island. In Nicaragua, China’s engagement appears in its earlier stages for now, but the PRC has already donated equipment to the country’s police forces. In Venezuela, Chinese arms and vehicles have been used to brutally suppress protests, while the PRC’s assistance in developing the Maduro regime’s Carnet de la Patria (“Homeland Card”) ID system stands out as one of the most sophisticated tools of digital authoritarianism in the hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in each of these countries, the quality of democracy as measured by the Economist Intelligence Unit has declined since their inclusion into China’s BRI (Cuba from 3.31 to 2.84, Nicaragua from 3.60 to 2.50, and Venezuela from 3.87 to 2.88). These ties also seem to cut both ways, with the stated objective of one ILD exchange between the CCP and the Communist Party of Cuba being to “learn from Cuba’s experiences in socialist revolution and construction.” This is not to suggest that China bears sole responsibility for authoritarian retrenchment in any of these countries, but rather that growing PRC engagement in already authoritarian contexts helps these regimes continue their hold on power, potentially beyond the point at which they would be able to survive through their own resources alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has elevated democracy promotion — and increasingly protection — as a pillar of its foreign policy, China’s regime-agnostic engagement makes the choice for regional autocrats a simple one. While protection does not require a country to have engaged significantly with the PRC prior to its descent into authoritarianism, China’s pattern of engagement with autocratic and semi-autocratic regimes in LAC provides a powerful example to would-be dictators in the region. For these individuals, the message is clear: should they move away from the path of democracy, they can count on assistance from powerful allies, both within their own hemisphere and across the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that propagation and protection are not mutually exclusive, and in some cases countries play host to both dynamics. In Venezuela, for instance, the government of Hugo Chávez would most likely have walked an authoritarian path on its own but was certainly propagated by China to venture away from democratic values. Later, Chávez and his protégé Nicolás Maduro would benefit from the protection offered by Chinese investment and trade. Together, these trends form a potent cocktail that has proven corrosive to democratic institutions throughout LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for all the powerful gravitational pull China’s engagement may exert, this influence is not irreversible. Ecuador, for instance, veered into semi-autocracy under Correa fueled by PRC-funded development efforts and security infrastructure, only to step back toward democracy and competitive elections under subsequent administrations. While profound challenges remain with respect to Ecuador’s democratic health, and democracies globally confront shortfalls and vulnerabilities, the importance of local agency, institutional resiliency, and civil society should not be discounted in any analysis of China’s impact on authoritarian consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hypotheses-and-methodological-design&quot;&gt;Hypotheses and Methodological Design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To fully explore the impact of China’s engagement with LAC and the region’s quality of democracy, the following hypotheses are posited:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;H1: Greater Chinese investment and trade flows are associated with greater declines in civil and political rights in LAC countries over the observation period.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;H2: Greater Chinese political and institutional engagement is associated with greater declines in civil and political rights in LAC countries over the observation period.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;H3: Greater Chinese military and security engagement is associated with greater declines in civil and political rights in LAC countries over the observation period.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;H4: LAC countries with less consolidated democracies experience higher levels of Chinese commercial, political, institutional, security, and people-to-people engagement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to both develop and test these hypotheses, the subsequent sections of this report focus on China’s foreign policy toward LAC. This is for three key reasons. First, China has on numerous occasions made explicit its desire to engage more closely with LAC and possesses the vast resources needed to make good on this commitment. Second, the scope of China’s engagement in the region is highly varied, unlike other autocracies such as Russia, which often makes more limited overtures primarily in the realm of military assistance. This allows for analysis across a range of factors, affording a degree of granularity that is critical for building and testing a theory premised on a nexus between foreign engagement and democratic backsliding. Finally, in focusing its analysis on LAC, this report acknowledges the central role this region played in the emergence of the third wave of democracy and argues that its future will therefore determine how durable that process of democratization will prove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese engagement has been steadily growing throughout the region, the form and consequences of this engagement are subject to a variety of local factors. In some countries, China has been a key backer throughout a worsening authoritarian spiral. In others, Chinese engagement coincided with a more modest erosion of democratic norms that, while worrying, has not proven catastrophic. Still other countries have pursued closer relations with China without experiencing significant restrictions on civil liberties or a deleterious impact on democracy. The varied nature of country outcomes renders it even more important to avoid painting Chinese engagement with a single brush and reinforces the importance of parsing individual country narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, a case study comparison offers the best methodological approach to disentangle the various interactions, exchanges, and negotiations that make up the universe of Chinese engagement in LAC. This study will select cases across five main outcomes of interest, namely: (1) countries that engaged with China and experienced democratic backsliding, (2) countries that engaged with China and experienced little democratic backsliding, (3) countries that engaged with China whose democratic and institutional outcomes remain uncertain, (4) countries that experienced democratic backsliding and have since stepped back from the precipice of authoritarianism, and (5) countries that have not engaged with China but nevertheless experienced democratic backsliding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first class of cases, where closer engagement with China coincided with severe democratic backsliding, Venezuela serves as an illustrative example. Beginning under Hugo Chávez and continuing through the tenure of Nicolás Maduro, China has provided substantial economic assistance, political support, and even military cooperation. This support enabled the Chávez and Maduro regimes to weather mounting international pressure and maintain their holds on power. Other cases of this type include Bolivia under Evo Morales, El Salvador under Nayib Bukele, and Argentina under the Kirchners, which have experienced democratic backsliding in the form of local elite capture and rising corruption, coinciding with their engagement with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, in the second set of cases, countries such as Panama have maintained a high level of civil and political rights even as they engage more closely with China. In 2017, Panama formally recognized China, and since then it has pursued closer relations — especially in the realm of trade and economic integration, joining the Belt and Road Initiative shortly after establishing formal relations. Nevertheless, Panama continues to hold free and competitive elections and enjoys robust democratic institutions. Other cases of this type include Chile and Uruguay, which continue to maintain strong democratic traditions even as China has emerged as a significant partner of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third category of cases, where future developments remain uncertain, includes countries such as Brazil since Lula’s second term in office. As the largest economy in LAC, and home to a bounty of natural resources and agricultural production, Brazil has received the bulk of Chinese foreign direct investment. At the same time, Brazil’s democratic institutions have been rocked over the past two decades — first by the massive Operation Car Wash corruption scandal and more recently through a fiercely contested election, which saw supporters of the defeated Jair Bolsonaro make an aborted effort to overturn the results and reinstall him in power. While these incidents have left many questions about the future of Brazil’s democracy, the country’s institutions have proven resilient. Another case in this category is Peru since circa 2016, where a rapid succession of political crises has created severe governance challenges and accreted power in the hands of an increasingly unaccountable legislature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth category of cases is a small but analytically meaningful set of countries where backsliding occurred but was ultimately reversed through local autonomy and political will, contributing to societies that show signs of democratic recuperation. In particular, Ecuador under the tenure of Rafael Correa charted a path alongside Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez and saw restrictions on press freedom and civil society progress in lockstep with growing debt loads to China. Yet, under the leadership of Lenín Moreno and subsequently Guillermo Lasso, those restrictions have begun to be rolled back. Such cases provide a critical insight into the staying power of democratic backsliding and the local conditions necessary to course-correct and rescue democracy from the precipice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final category offers alternative explanations to the conventional wisdom regarding Chinese engagement and growing authoritarianism. The case of Nicaragua, for instance, where a full-fledged dictatorship emerged without a significant influx of Chinese economic or political assistance, must be addressed in any analysis of the impacts of Chinese engagement in the hemisphere. The Dominican Republic under the administration of Danilo Medina also showcases that backsliding can occur anywhere corruption and elite capture are allowed to flourish, even absent significant Chinese engagement. That Nicaragua’s recognition of China occurred after the consolidation of its authoritarian regime is also significant. Exploring these histories will furthermore help to differentiate geopolitical from regional, subregional, and local drivers of authoritarianism. It will also help determine how China can help authoritarian regimes consolidate after they have emerged — as in the case of Nicaragua, where China’s presence ensures access to capital, financing, and sweetheart deals for Nicaraguan elites in the face of international economic isolation and sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regional focus of these case studies is also critical in light of the fact that, despite a growing number of investigations into Chinese support for authoritarianism, many of these adopt a global perspective, pulling case studies from East and Central Asia, Europe, and Africa. Such efforts are certainly useful for generating insights into broad trends in Chinese engagement; however, a regional approach allows for more careful exploration of the geographic nature of both democratization and democratic backsliding. Just as democratization was tied by Huntington to geopolitical power shifts, so too have scholars found that democracies tend to be clustered geographically. Thus, changes in the landscape of civil and political rights in one country will likely have spillover effects on its neighbors. Focusing on LAC cases will therefore not only facilitate in-depth investigation into particular country narratives, but it will also put these cases in conversation with one another, creating a more holistic picture of the spread of authoritarian and democratic norms alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cases in which a country did not engage with China and also did not experience democratic backsliding or authoritarian consolidation are not considered in this study. The scale and intensity of China’s engagement with LAC over the past 20 years has left few countries untouched, while those few countries without appreciable ties to the PRC such as Haiti or Honduras before 2023 have by and large suffered democratic backsliding, placing them into the same category as Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic cases. This means that the universe of applicable case studies for such a category is severely limited. Instead, no backsliding and no engagement with China is taken as a baseline when evaluating the 13 case studies, not a category for analysis in and of itself.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The above categorizations are primarily qualitative in nature, based on a holistic assessment of China’s economic, security, media, and diplomatic engagements with each country, and the comparative democratic trajectories followed over the study period. While quantitative sources are leveraged, the case study selection purposefully avoids reliance on any single statistic to group various case studies. In doing so, this approach seeks to reflect the multifaceted nature of democratic backsliding in LAC. Indeed, even in the strongest of democracies, there lie forces seeking to corrode institutional checks and balances, centralize power, and lay the groundwork for autocracy. Similarly, even in firmly entrenched autocracies, popular discontent and resistance periodically threaten the rule of the regime. This approach accordingly allows for making comparisons and identifying trendlines both within and across categories of countries. As a result, the common themes identified in subsequent chapters should not be read as exclusive to the five case study categories, but rather as a dynamic system where certain components play an outsize role depending on where a country falls on the spectrum from democracy to autocracy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-studies---part-i&quot;&gt;The Case Studies - Part I&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter considers the two categories of cases with the greatest variation in terms of the dependent variable of democratic backsliding. On one side of the ledger, it considers Venezuela, Bolivia, Argentina, Ecuador, and El Salvador: countries that have engaged China and subsequently suffered democratic backsliding. On the other, it looks at Chile, Uruguay, and Panama: countries with similarly high levels of Chinese engagement, yet little observable backsliding or autocratization. A review of these case studies points to four common trends in the countries that experienced democratic backsliding and three sources of democratic resilience. Of these common features, Chinese engagement played a direct role in two of the four backsliding trends and an indirect role in another. Meanwhile, all three sources of democratic resilience explicitly helped to limit the extent of China’s influence over the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;common-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Common Vulnerabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POPULAR PRESIDENTS, IMPERIAL EXECUTIVES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common thread across all five cases of democratic backsliding is the remarkable popularity of populist authoritarian leaders, especially when they first arrive in office. This is consistent with literature on modern democratic backsliding, with its finding that autocrats today are far more likely to be voted into office than they are to break down the doors to the presidential palace. The archetypical example of the elected autocrat is Hugo Chávez, who, after first seeking power down the barrel of a gun with his failed 1992 coup, came to power through open elections six years later. From this point, Chávez managed to successfully campaign and win against numerous successive challenges, including a recall referendum in 2004, which he won by nearly 20 percentage points. Evo Morales similarly embodies this phenomenon, having never been officially defeated in a presidential election before being forced from office amid electoral irregularities in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the most recent embodiment of this trend is undoubtedly Nayib Bukele, whose approval ratings routinely reach past 80 and even 90 percent. The popularity of authoritarian leaders, especially at first, directly contributes to democratic backsliding in two ways. First, it lets them wield executive power much more freely than many of their counterparts, allowing them to push through legislative projects that would otherwise have entailed lengthy public battles and considerable political capital. Second, and perhaps more insidiously, it inculcates a view within the leader that their agenda is inherently popular — and therefore that those who oppose it must be enemies of the popular will, not merely political opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When leaders begin to adopt policies that are increasingly unpopular, such as in 2004, when the Venezuelan opposition organized a recall referendum against Hugo Chávez, authoritarian leaders often ascribe blame to shadowy cabals of U.S.-backed conspirators. In Bolivia, the government responded to criticism by independent news outlets by passing Supreme Decree 181 in 2009, allowing state advertising to be withheld from supposedly politicized media, defined by then vice president Alvaro García Linera as “those that insult us and those that lie.” In the worst cases, authoritarian leaders may see the very institutions meant to check executive power as merely troublemakers needing to be controlled and restrained, such as when Bukele ordered the Salvadoran armed forces to occupy the national legislature to ensure passage of his planned budget increase for the security services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s engagement has an indirect effect on this trend. In several of the cases, autocratic leaders came to rely on China for easy access to cash that would fuel popular development projects or allow these governments to sustain otherwise irresponsible social spending programs. Ecuador embodied this trend, as Rafael Correa’s popular poverty reduction, public health, and welfare programs coalesced amid ballooning external debt. Meanwhile, the remarkable economic recovery in Argentina which the Kirchners presided over was partially driven by rising demand from China for agricultural products. Furthermore, Chinese banks played an important role in buoying the Argentine economy, with over half of China’s commercial loans to LAC between 2007 and 2015 going to Argentina (in 2007 and 2010 Argentina was the only LAC country to receive Chinese commercial loans). In this way, China’s economic and development assistance plays into both sides of this trend. It can make popular leaders more popular and swollen with executive power, and it can make the economic crisis these countries face all the more acute when the money begins to dry up and China returns to collect its debts, forcing once-popular leaders to grapple with the deeply unpopular effects of economic mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONSTITUTIONS AND COURTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another universal theme in backsliding cases is an effort by executives to reform the national constitution and undermine or otherwise capture the judicial system. The success or failure of such efforts is often a decisive factor in a country’s democratic trajectory. Often, courts represent some of the last remaining checks on an elected autocrat’s ability to enforce their will. For this reason, constitutional and judicial reforms remain some of the hardest political battles across the case studies. Hugo Chávez lost a 2007 national referendum that proposed a spate of constitutional reforms. Bolivia’s adoption in 2009 of a constitutional overhaul also elicited mass anti-government demonstrations and fierce opposition activity. Notably, constitutional changes were often tied to the extension or circumvention of presidential term limits. In Venezuela and Ecuador, presidential term limits were eliminated, while Bolivia’s constitutional change enabled Evo Morales to serve a total of three terms — his 2006–2009 stretch not being counted against the two-term limit imposed by the new constitution. Morales later maneuvered to run for another term, with control over the Supreme Court ensuring he could run for a fourth term — after losing a referendum on the subject — on the basis that term limits violated his human rights. In Argentina, Néstor Kirchner had already aroused suspicion from civil society when he abolished gubernatorial term limits while serving as governor of Santa Clara province. This backlash proved sufficient enough to dissuade Kirchner from pursuing a similar effort while in federal office, though in practice analysts note that the Kirchners managed to de facto circumvent term limits with the 2007 election of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who benefited from practical incumbent status while remaining an outside candidate on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of El Salvador, Bukele has also disregarded his constitutionally mandated single term in office. However, unlike the previous cases, he has not done so by means of referendum or constitutional reform, but by co-opting El Salvador’s Supreme Court. Following the victory of Bukele and his Nuevas Ideas party in 2019, the country’s National Assembly swiftly dismissed and replaced all five Supreme Court justices and replaced them with party loyalists who predictably handed down a ruling reinterpreting the constitution to permit Bukele’s 2024 reelection bid. A similar story has been playing out for far longer in Venezuela, where the judicial branch has contorted into a mere extension of the Maduro regime over the course of years of political machinations. This came to a head in 2017, when the Supreme Court voted to dissolve the opposition-controlled National Assembly. This incident, in which an unelected body in the service of an autocratic leader overawed popular sentiment, underscores the strength and centrality of the courts, along with their potential to be an asset both in the service of and against autocracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, efforts to exert presidential control over the courts were eminently popular. Six of nine supreme court justices were dismissed and replaced during the Kirchner years, while the National Congress passed laws enhancing the executive’s control over the selection of new justices. This was in fact a reversal of former president Carlos Menem’s efforts to pack the court; however, the manner in which Néstor Kirchner went about cleaning up Argentina’s judiciary was not without a cost. Steven Levitsky and María Victoria Murillo pinpoint this challenge, finding that “Kirchner’s purge produced a better and more publicly legitimate Court, but it came at the cost of another blow to the institution of secure judicial tenure, thereby reinforcing existing patterns of judicial weakness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s role in this facet of democratic vulnerability is far more nebulous. Constitutional referenda as well as attempts to undermine judicial independence were both domestically driven political projects, with minimal external impetus. Protection may have been a factor in emboldening governments to pursue more strident antidemocratic reforms, but this influence was likely only marginal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ISOLATION SPIRAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most troubling dynamics identified across the backsliding cases is the mutually reinforcing relationship between antidemocratic behavior, international isolation, and dependency on China. The essence of this dynamic is that the erosion of democratic checks and balances typically leads to governments distancing themselves from the United States, neighboring countries, and the broader liberal international order. This comes with both political and economic consequences, leaving these countries cut off from traditional financing sources like the IMF and World Bank, while in some cases triggering economic sanctions against particularly egregious behaviors. Facing this external pressure, backsliding countries turn to China as a source of economic succor, giving the PRC leverage that it uses to encourage further dependency, backsliding, and isolation — a vicious cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecuador best exemplifies the isolation spiral, as President Correa leaned heavily on China to achieve his ambitious social and economic goals. The first window appeared in 2008 when Ecuador defaulted on over $3 billion in loans, with Chinese state-owned firms stepping in to provide an emergency line of credit. This episode both left the Ecuadoran economy — especially its oil and gas sectors — open to vastly increased Chinese involvement and damaged Ecuador’s standing in the eyes of alternative potential investors. Correa, however, had little incentive to change his behavior, and almost immediately after the default he passed a controversial mining law making it easier for foreign companies to begin operations within Ecuador — an opening that the state-owned Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group was eager to seize. Not only did Tongling and other firms engaged in extractive industries benefit from this new legal structure, they counted on the government to suppress largely Indigenous-led protests against the expansion of mining on and near their historic lands. Just a year later, Correa signed his first oil-backed deal with the China Export-Import Bank to finance the Coca Codo Sinclair Dam, an infrastructure megaproject that has become legacy-defining for Correa — if for none of the reasons he likely intended. Amid an environment of growing state power, deteriorating rule of law, and periodic mass protests, the investment conditions in Ecuador were hardly promising, save for Chinese firms that could count on the leverage the PRC had already accrued to ensure that their interests were preserved, while boxing out potential competitors. Provided China’s economy remained flush with the cash needed to sustain massive — and often dubious — investments, the spiral would only continue downwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar narrative has played out, albeit over a longer period of time, in Venezuela and Bolivia. With a collapsed economy and a poisoned international reputation, the Maduro regime counts on fellow autocracies such as China, Russia, and Iran for an economic and diplomatic lifeline. Especially after 2019, when the United States imposed sectoral sanctions against the Venezuelan oil industry, China was instrumental in a scheme to disguise heavy crude as Malaysian oil, buying up to $3.5 billion from May 2020 to June 2021 and transshipping it to China for refining by so-called teapot refineries. Bolivia’s five-year National Development Plan, which formed the cornerstone of Evo Morales’ final term economic policy, was made possible with a $10 billion line of credit from the PRC. Just as China was expanding its leverage over Bolivia through foreign debt and in sectors like construction, mining, and energy, Morales’ declared “total independence” from Western-backed financial institutions like the World Bank and IMF. Of particular note is the finding by China scholar R. Evan Ellis that, in both cases, Chinese engagement began cautiously. It was only after considerable centralization of power in both countries — Chávez’s response to the 2003 general strike in the case of Venezuela and the 2009 constitutional reform in Bolivia — that Beijing surged ahead with renewed enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The isolation spiral appears nascent in El Salvador, but it is worsening rapidly as Bukele moves to cement his hold on power. While El Salvador still depends heavily on the United States — which serves as the destination for roughly 40 percent of the country’s exports, and which El Salvador depends on for the vast majority of the remittances that account for nearly a quarter of its GDP — Bukele has courted China since coming to power in the hopes that it could provide a counterbalance to U.S. economic pressure. China has offered to fund port and tourism infrastructure, as well as constructed a new National Library (which has played a starring role in Bukele’s propaganda of late); but surely the most dramatic episode was its offer to buy the entirety of El Salvador’s external debt when the country faced potential default on IMF loans in early 2023. Ultimately, Bukele was able to strike a deal with his creditors, but future economic travails may see him return to Beijing as a foreign backer willing and able to shore up an autocratic project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRIME AND CONTROL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final commonality across the backsliding cases has been their adoption of increasingly aggressive strategies for policing, civil security, and social control. This manifests in part organically, as initially popular leaders begin to reckon with unpopular policies and growing pressure for democratic accountability. It also often involves the pursuit of more sophisticated capabilities to monitor and proactively repress populations before they can organize to put a challenge to the government. China has played a hand in supporting both types of activity, but in the latter case has been especially effective in disseminating its knowledge of surveillance and digital authoritarianism throughout the hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;El Salvador has evinced the most dramatic crackdown on civil liberties in the name of civilian security. Following a harrowing murder spree in March 2022, Bukele launched a state of exception: suspending the right to assemble, authorizing indefinite pretrial detention, and granting the military and police a free hand to arrest individuals with little to no evidence of gang affiliation. What was initially approved as a 30-day special period has become a state of permanency for Salvadorans, with the legislature rubber-stamping extensions month after month. Meanwhile, El Salvador’s prison population has mushroomed to over 100,000 individuals, or about 2 percent of the country’s entire adult population. A pervasive culture of impunity has paved the way for abuses by the security forces who, in some areas, have merely replaced the gangs as sources of fear and criminality. In Venezuela, the Maduro government has a long track record of utilizing the language of citizen security to justify the repression of dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called Operation Liberation of the People in 2015, for instance, was responsible for at least 20 documented extrajudicial killings, while recent “mega-operations” against prison gangs have seen individuals arrested and detained without cause and led to dozens more killings with no accountability on the part of security forces. In fact, the regime stands accused of committing crimes against humanity in the International Criminal Court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to mass protests, backsliding governments have shown few reservations around the use of force to curb dissent. From 2002 to 2019, 273 people were killed by security forces at protests in Venezuela, with Chinese-made VN-4 armored vehicles playing an especially notorious role in crushing demonstrations since the first delivery was made in 2012. As Venezuela descended further into autocracy, many countries shut off exports of weapons and military equipment to the country, leaving Russia and China as the sole external suppliers of arms to the country from 2017 to 2021. However, perhaps more insidious than China’s role as a provider of arms and equipment has been its efforts to proliferate mass surveillance technologies throughout the region. As early as 2008, Venezuelan officials were in contact with representatives from Chinese technology firm ZTE to discuss plans to overhaul the country’s citizen ID system. The resulting “fatherland card,” which rolled out in 2016 after years of close collaboration between Venezuela, Cuba, and the PRC, remains one of the preeminent cases of data-enabled social control in LAC today. According to a 2017 Reuters investigation, the system “stores such details as birthdays, family information, employment and income, property owned, medical history, state benefits received, presence on social media, membership of a political party and whether a person voted.” However, Venezuela was not the only country to see new technological tools repurposed in the interest of keeping tabs on citizens. In 2011, Ecuador signed another oil-backed deal to the tune of approximately $200 million for Huawei and the China National Electronics Import &amp;amp; Export Corporation (CEIEC) to install new security cameras and integrate them with the ECU-911 security response system. In the years that followed, reports surfaced that the multiplicity of cameras were not only doing little to reduce crime on a day-to-day basis but also feeding information to police and emergency responders as well as the National Intelligence Secretariat (Senain) — the secretive agency that spearheaded the surveillance and suppression of opposition parties and dissidents under Correa. In at least one case, Chinese-supplied cameras were installed outside the residence of a prominent anti-government activist, a clear attempt to chill criticism of the Correa government. In 2016, Bolivia and the China Export-Import Bank signed an agreement for the PRC to supply Bolivian police forces with cameras, telecommunications equipment, and a new command center in La Paz for the BOL-110 citizen security system, an initiative which has continued apace well past Morales’s exit from government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the above examples, Argentina did not appear to adopt social control measures on the same scale. This can be attributed in part to the prior strength of Argentine democratic institutions, relatively lower levels of insecurity, and the fact that Néstor Kirchner came to power on the heels of massive protests during which two protesters were killed in clashes with riot police. The memory of this upheaval likely served as a powerful mobilizing force and constraint on the Kirchners’ ability to use force in domestic security affairs, a factor which seems to have helped stay the hand of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner as late as 2012–2013, when another wave of anti-government protests gripped the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case with the isolation spiral, China’s role in democratic backsliding is prominent when it comes to facilitating government repression. Both propagation and protection trends are at play in this regard. For the former, it is telling that both Ecuador and Venezuela embarked on their digital authoritarian projects after officials visited China and saw how successful the PRC has become in managing its citizens’ public lives. Chinese bilateral police diplomacy also stresses the superiority of China’s model compared to the United States, while the GSI more recently signals a clear effort by China to disseminate and socialize its approach to security among other countries. China’s willingness to arm and equip militaries and police forces accused of human rights abuses also speaks to the protection dimension — and to China’s emerging role, alongside Russia, as a go-to security partner for countries that struggle to access the international arms market. As LAC countries continue to grapple with resurgent criminal organizations and a seeming lack of interest on the part of the United States in such issues, China’s offer may appear more and more tempting, especially for countries like El Salvador, which has yet to enlist significant Chinese assistance in the conduct of its state of exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shared-resiliency&quot;&gt;Shared Resiliency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE WISDOM OF CROWDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the cases of backsliding and those where countries managed to retain healthy democratic institutions throughout their engagement with China, civil society and popular protest served as some of the most effective checks on executive aggrandizement. Chile, Uruguay, and Panama alike not only possess vibrant civil societies and cultures of mass mobilization but have time and again proven effective in securing political concessions from their governments. In some cases, this mass mobilization has been explicitly aimed at expansions of Chinese influence deemed harmful to the national interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2019 to 2022, Chile experienced a period of social upheaval driven largely by grassroots organizing and civil society groups. Beginning with a set of student-led protests against a metro fare hike proposed by the conservative government of President Sebastián Piñera, demonstrations boiled over into a mass movement which at its height drew upwards of a million protesters to Santiago. While the demonstrations were largely peaceful, it is important to stress that early reports of looting and vandalism, as well as a violent, heavy-handed government response to the initial unrest, pointed toward a worrying conclusion. Yet rather than pushing government and protesters to opposite extremes, the Piñera government capitulated and rolled back its fare hike in the face of obvious public discontent. Furthermore, the protests jump-started a broader political transformation that would ultimately result in the inauguration of a new government, as well as a constitutional reform process. Constitutional changes being driven in response to pressure from below certainly stands in marked contrast to the referenda preferred by backsliding countries, which were often little more than barefaced attempts to legitimate further centralization of power — although it is notable that both of Chile’s constitutional rewrite attempts have been rejected when put to voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Uruguay, civil society has often acted as a check on outsized foreign influence, and Chinese influence in particular. The cancellation of a proposal by Shandong BaoMa Fisheries Group for a $200 million port project in Montevideo following local outcry is one especially salient example, where local opposition, coupled with fears the port could exacerbate Uruguay’s struggle against illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, directly countermanded a PRC-backed initiative. Meanwhile, Panama has seen two dramatic national upheavals in the past four years: first in 2021 against electoral reforms seen as hindering transparent and accountable democracy, and subsequently in 2023, with national outrage flaring against a potential copper mining concession. The 2021 demonstrations were critical for their role in signaling the Panamanian populace’s commitment to democratic and electoral integrity. The 2023 upheaval carried at its heart questions of Panama’s economic, environmental, and social future, but it was also about China’s role in sensitive extractive industries. The copper mine in question, while owned by Toronto-based company First Quantum, counts as a major shareholder Chinese state-owned Jiangxi Copper Company Limited, and the PRC is the destination for some 60 percent of all copper produced in Panama. Accordingly, while driven by domestic interest, these protests were closely tied to Panama’s relationship with China — and specifically, its role in extractive sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the presence of mass protest against certain policies does not mean the positions being advocated by the demonstrators are necessarily correct or even reflect the opinion expressed by a majority of the citizenry. However, the fact that in all three cases, protests succeeded in directly influencing government behavior signals a level of representation between the state and population that acts as an important democratic safeguard. Nevertheless, this observation should not discredit the courageous and impressive achievements of civil society in Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Argentina. Protest organizers in these countries achieved impressive results, often under a miasma of intimidation and threats. Instead, it is best to understand that an activated civil society is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of safeguarding democracy. Other ingredients are necessary to arrest the descent into authoritarianism in the face of a leader who is set on corroding democratic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAKING ENDS MEET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second important distinction between the backsliding cases and those instances of democratic resiliency is the nature of Chilean, Uruguayan, and Panamanian economic engagement with China. Each of these countries benefited from a comparatively stronger financial and infrastructural starting point when they first engaged the PRC. Indeed, in 2022 these countries accounted for the top three highest GDPs per capita in purchasing power parity throughout LAC. This helped to serve as a buffer against the isolation spiral by leaving fewer opportunities for China to gain leverage, and it let the countries set the terms for their engagement with the PRC on more equal footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning first to the question of infrastructure, LAC on the whole suffers from a profound infrastructure gap. Countries in the region spend on average between 2 and 4 percent of their GDP on infrastructure — less than half of what the Inter-American Development Bank estimates is needed to modernize and expand critical infrastructure. Nevertheless, in the 2018 Global Competitiveness Report, Chile, Uruguay, and Panama all fell in the top five spots for Latin America in terms of infrastructure competitiveness, with Chile leading the pack in terms of overall competitiveness as well as road connectivity and utilities. For this reason, there is comparatively less demand on the part of these countries for flashy (and expensive) infrastructure investments that would be difficult to obtain anywhere other than China. This does not mean these countries have no need for investment in their ports, roads, railways, and power sectors, but it does mean that they can rebuff unsustainable or disadvantageous deals more easily, preventing them from falling victim to a self-propagating cycle of dependence on China for funds. This can be seen in the aforementioned case of the Montevideo port, as well as the decision of Panamanian president Laurentino Cortizo to cancel another Chinese port concession in the Colón Free Trade Zone under U.S. pressure and upon finding numerous breaches of contract on the part of the Shandong-based Landbridge Group in charge of implementing the project. To be sure, Panama continues to move forward with a $1.4 billion Chinese-financed bridge over the Panama Canal, but it is telling in and of itself that this would be the fourth such bridge. Chinese investment is therefore welcome, but it is largely augmenting and expanding upon existing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three cases of resilience also possess some of the most developed and modernized economies throughout all of LAC, further strengthening their hand to engage with China in a less asymmetric way and decline where otherwise unnecessary. As of 2021, Chile and Uruguay both enjoyed trade surpluses with China, a rarity in all of LAC. Meanwhile, Panama, which still has a roughly $7 billion trade deficit, has been rapidly growing since its 2017 opening to the PRC. To these countries, engaging with China is not a matter of economic survival — as it might have been for Ecuador when it faced default or Venezuela when it came under U.S. oil sanctions — but rather one of economic opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEGISLATIVE HEALTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final key thread in democratic resilience across the three countries has been the comparative strength of their legislatures. In a hemisphere where democratic backsliding often comes in the form of executive aggrandizement, the presence of competent, independent, and empowered legislators acts as a critical check and balance, as well as a pressure release valve for overwhelmed judiciaries. This is not to say that legislatures themselves cannot contribute to democratic erosion; indeed, national assemblies throughout LAC have accrued sizeable powers with little oversight in recent years. However, this observation is further evidence in favor of the role that accountable and transparent legislatures with well-institutionalized parties play as a bulwark against backsliding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BwTnHN1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 8: Legislative Constraints on Executives Index over Time.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Coppedge et al., “V-Dem [Country-Year/Country-Date] Dataset v13”; and Pemstein et al., “The V-Dem Measurement Model.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three countries have robust, multiparty systems wherein presidents regularly find themselves governing over divided legislatures, putting a premium on coalition building. Even in Uruguay, where the Frente Amplio governed the country for some 15 years, power changed hands in 2019 to the Partido Nacional. Furthermore, the three countries benefit from a well-established set of parties, which serve as incubators for future leaders within both executive and legislative branches. Weak parties were a challenge which plagued Argentina under the Kirchners, who failed to cultivate strong leadership within the national assembly, causing it to delegate leadership functions to the executive branch. The result was a system in which neither the incumbent nor opposition factions within the legislature possessed the requisite experience to guide Argentina through its tumultuous economic and political crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong legislatures are more than just checks on executive power; they often wield influence over the appointment, remit, and funding of the judicial branch. Judiciaries, as previously noted, are often the last line of democratic defense, but legislative weakness often leaves the door open for authoritarians to push policies severely curtailing judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, legislatures are especially susceptible to Chinese strategies of elite capture, with it being easier for Chinese firms to indirectly influence policymakers through lobby groups or directly secure influence via guarantees of plush investment projects in their home districts. In Argentina, much like in Brazil, China’s demand for agricultural products has cemented a pro-Beijing constituency within the country’s farming sector that has proven durable across changes in administrations and political leanings. Broader Chinese economic influence also came into play during debates over the Neuquén Space Station deal in 2014, which handed over territory for deep space observation to the PLA in an opaque and unaccountable fashion. Urdinez et al. describe how during legislative debates over this agreement, China’s economic benefits and foreign direct investment in Argentina were frequently raised by Kirchnerist legislators to block opposition comments. In Ecuador as well, Chinese mining companies stepped up investments in the country in concert with the debate over the 2008 constitutional reform and lobbied both the Correa administration and National Assembly members to enact reforms that would open the country’s mining sector to foreign investment (in reality almost entirely Chinese investment). When local communities began to protest new mining projects, they swiftly found that the institutions meant to reflect their grievances at the national level had been co-opted by the dramatic influx of investment in to Ecuador’s mining sector. Elite capture of legislators is further propelled by the general lack of transparency associated with Chinese investment and development contracts, which leaves these ripe for corruption and hidden kickbacks, with one study noting: “The opaque nature of BRI projects presents regular opportunities for massive corruption, best described as a ‘feature’ of the BRI rather than a ‘bug.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong party traditions and turnover in control of the legislature is therefore not enough to completely resist potential corrosive effects from China’s engagement; legislatures must have strong transparency and anticorruption safeguards to ensure that their members cannot be co-opted by narrow interest groups. Legislative strength across the three cases of democratic resilience studies is in this respect uneven. Chile’s 2016 reforms to campaign financing and party governance in the wake of a series of scandals over the previous years was hailed as a step in the right direction toward limiting the role of interest groups in government. Uruguay has benefited from its history of well-institutionalized political parties, which lend predictability to governance, avoid wild swings in policy or overly personalist leaders, and serve as incubators for new generations of leadership. Panama, by contrast, continues to suffer from one of the least transparent legislatures in all of LAC, a feature which undermines public trust in Panamanian democracy and compounds the country’s struggles with entrenched corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-role-of-ideology&quot;&gt;The Role of Ideology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In surveying the cases of democratic backsliding, it may be tempting to suggest that left-wing, socialist populism is to blame for the erosion of checks and balances. Several scholars and analysts have made this argument, observing as well that the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist underpinnings of the CCP are likely to resonate more with left-leaning governments. Three of the five backsliding cases were also members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), a multilateral organization founded by Venezuela and Cuba with an explicitly socialist mission, suggesting that ideological preferences certainly exerted some impact on the foreign policies of those countries. Ideology undoubtedly plays a role in the preferences, and potentially the democratic trajectories of countries; however, upon closer inspection the nature of this relationship is far less causal in nature, for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the case of El Salvador provides a clear exception to any rule that China prefers to engage leftist governments. Bukele’s administration has in many ways defied traditional categorization along a left or right spectrum, while his embrace of cryptocurrency and peculiar private investment schemes suggests a libertarian bent. The administration of Gabriel Boric in Chile similarly gives reason for pause when evaluating an ideologically determinative model for China’s role in democratic backsliding. Boric rode a wave of left-wing activism to the presidency, yet has been a staunch supporter of democracy, fiercely criticizing the regime of Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, for instance, which seeks to cloak itself in the language of revolutionary socialism. Accordingly, even if impactful, ideology is not universally predictive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the trendlines identified by the case study analysis already account for the role ideology plays. In the case of the isolation spiral, for instance, ideological opposition to the United States or Western international order can help push countries away from certain groups and toward greater dependency on China. ALBA itself was an ideological project which also had the effect of further distancing its members from established organizations like the Organization of American States (OAS) and reinforcing dependency on China. The beliefs of leaders about the nature of their mandate and popular support may likewise be influenced by ideology, with leaders such as Evo Morales and Hugo Chávez pronouncing themselves to be giving voice to the voiceless and claiming to be embodiments of the popular will. The effect of this is nevertheless that such leaders will be less willing to listen to popular backlash when it occurs. In this way, the trendlines identified offer allow ideology to enter the conversation, but they also make space for alternative influences, thereby allowing for a more granular look into the factors propelling democratic backsliding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the policy prescriptions associated with an ideology-first understanding of backsliding in LAC are at odds with a U.S. strategy that seeks to prioritize democracy promotion. Assuming that left-wing governments are inherently susceptible to authoritarianism and Chinese influence, the response should be for the United States to encourage countries to avoid electing leftist leaders — a recommendation which risks encouraging U.S. intervention in other countries’ democracies and smacks of the dark history of Cold War–era interventionism. A democracy-first approach to U.S. strategy in LAC must therefore take as a given that people are free to elect the leaders they desire, and it should focus instead on ensuring that proper guardrails are in place to prevent the erosion of democracy — whether from within or via malign external influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;absence-of-backsliding-is-not-absence-of-influence&quot;&gt;Absence of Backsliding Is Not Absence of Influence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above analysis is concerned primarily with vulnerabilities and sources of resiliency with respect to democratic backsliding specifically. As such, it does not provide a full accounting of China’s influence in each of the eight case studies. Taking this perspective reveals that even in countries like Chile and Panama, China has accrued an impressive degree of leverage. In March 2021, Chile’s antitrust regulator approved a takeover of the Compania General de Electricidad electrical utility by the State Grid Corporation of China, a move that means Chinese SOEs now control nearly 60 percent of all power distribution in the country. In Panama, despite the Cortizo government’s rejection of the Colón Container Port project, concerns have grown steadily over the two ports along the Panama Canal operated by Hong Kong–based Hutchison Whampoa, with senior U.S. diplomats and security officials highlighting the risk to the canal’s operation in the event of conflict or crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cases of backsliding as well, Chinese influence has persisted and grown long after the time period under consideration. In Argentina, the conservative Macri government continued to lean heavily on the PRC for economic support, cementing Sino-Argentine relations. Under the subsequent administration of Alberto Fernández, Argentina doubled down on cooperation with China, signing on to the BRI in 2022 and opening a $6.5 billion currency swap credit line. Ecuador remains heavily constrained by its massive debt to China in spite of a democratic reopening under Lenín Moreno and Guillermo Lasso, and in June of 2023 Bolivia signed a deal with Chinese battery manufacturer CATL to begin extraction of the country’s vast lithium reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s advance in strategic sectors across the entire hemisphere has provided it with remarkably durable influence, the full implications of which remain unclear. Since Beijing has largely sought to court rather than compel countries in LAC, the region has yet to experience some of the economic and political pressure China has become notorious for in other cases. However, should this change one day, and China seek to put its cards on the table for a coercive approach, the region would find itself with precious few safeguards or contingencies in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-studies---part-ii&quot;&gt;The Case Studies - Part II&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter considers three distinct categories of cases, beginning with Ecuador since 2017, which represents the sole case study country that appeared at the precipice of authoritarian consolidation only to walk back toward democracy. Next, it turns to the cases of Brazil and Peru, two countries that have experienced both significant levels of Chinese engagement and considerable political tumult but have nevertheless not shown a clear trend toward either authoritarianism or democratic consolidation. Finally, it examines two cases in which the process of backsliding occurred independent of Chinese engagement: the Dominican Republic under Danilo Medina and Nicaragua under Daniel Ortega. Both countries began their democratic regression as diplomatic allies of Taiwan, severely constraining the PRC’s ability to influence political dynamics in either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-the-precipice-the-case-of-ecuador&quot;&gt;On the Precipice: The Case of Ecuador&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Rafael Correa left the presidency to his handpicked successor and political protégé Lenín Moreno. The decision was by all accounts not intended to herald a reopening of democracy; rather, Correa expected to continue to wield power over the government while not in office and potentially return to run the country in a few short years. The situation was therefore akin to the Kirchners’ trade-off with one another in 2007 or, as one analyst wrote later, Putin’s sharing of the presidency with Dmitri Medvedev. However, Moreno broke sharply with Correa soon after he was elected, professing openness to dialogue and reconciliation with the opposition and announcing a 2018 referendum which, among other items, reimposed term limits on the presidency. Moreno also pursued a conservative fiscal policy, seeking to dramatically tamp down public spending, which surged during the Correa years, and engaging the IMF and World Bank, rather than China, for financial assistance. Correa was reduced from backroom powerbroker to columnist, writing scathing attacks on the Moreno government but wielding little sway over the administration he helped install. Just a year after he left office, an arrest warrant was issued for Correa after he failed to appear in court (he had moved to Belgium shortly after leaving office). In 2020 Correa was convicted in absentia on bribery charges alongside former vice president Jorge Glas and a number of other former officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreno left office in 2021, handing off the presidency to Guillermo Lasso, a banker who had been Correa’s main political opponent in the 2013 elections. Lasso continued the democratic reconstruction project he had been left: on his first day in office, he repealed the 2013 Ecuadorian Communication Law, which Correa had promoted in an attempt to muzzle the press, which the former president deemed “rabid dogs.” Lasso made early overtures to Ecuador’s Indigenous communities, which had faced continuous repression as the Correa government sought to pave the way for greater investments by Chinese companies in the oil and mining sectors. However, in spite of initial progress, the Lasso administration found itself swiftly embroiled in a set of overlapping crises. During the summer of 2022, protests against rising energy prices, corruption, and the continuation of extractive industries on or near Indigenous land paralyzed the country. Organized crime spiraled, causing the government to declare repeated states of emergency as homicide rates skyrocketed. Finally, Lasso himself became embroiled in a bribery scandal and faced impeachment by the opposition-controlled National Assembly. Staring down impeachment, Lasso invoked a rare constitutional provision of “muerte cruzado” or mutual death, disbanding the assembly and calling for new snap general elections. Ultimately, Lasso served a little over half of his elected term, departing office in a fragmented political environment with monumental challenges facing the new Noboa administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet while political instability remains a pressing concern, Ecuador’s transition from a populist, personalist, and increasingly autocratic system before 2017 to a country marked by active competition between political parties and an increasingly vocal civil society bears careful study. It would be easy to chart a course in which Ecuador remained on course for a consolidated authoritarian regime were it not for a handful of decisive factors. Foremost among these was the unexpected about-face by Lenín Moreno, which appeared to have caught Correa completely off-guard. Moreno’s shift underscores a key observation when it comes to peaceful democratic transitions, namely that such shifts often require the incumbent regime to be taken by surprise. This was the case in Chile’s historic “no” referendum in 1988, as well as in the 1989 Panamanian general election which precipitated Manuel Noriega’s removal from power. In both cases, authoritarian governments miscalculated a democratic opening, trusting that their combination of social control methods and political patronage could secure a win through stage-managed elections. Correa similarly bet on his ability to control a successor, only to find his sway dramatically reduced once he departed office. This suggests that the United States ought to pay careful attention to those rare democratic openings in otherwise authoritarian countries. The nature of the third reverse wave may also be relevant here, as modern autocrats seek to project the veneer of democracy, leaving them open to surprises at the polls or among their successors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important consideration revealed by the Ecuador case is the fragility of democratic transitions. More than five years of efforts to rebuild democratic institutions have yet to fully peel back the legacy of Correa on Ecuadorian institutions and politics. Indeed, the inauguration of a new leader, even one firmly committed to democracy and rule of law, is insufficient to prevent the onset of another wave of popular discontent and perhaps even the return of an authoritarian leader. Ecuador’s latest presidential election underscored this, with Correista loyalist Luisa González coming in as a close second and President Correa’s Revolución Ciudadana movement winning a plurality of seats in the National Assembly. China also contributed to Ecuador’s post-Correa instability: the environmental and economic fallout from China’s infrastructure projects and investments served as a wedge issue between successive governments and impacted communities. Even Moreno and Lasso, who preferred to engage more closely with the United States and Western institutions, were nevertheless forced to treat with the PRC as a consequence of the extreme levels of debt and access Correa had signed over to Beijing. The United States, for its part, should engage closely with countries that appear on the edge of discarding their authoritarian past; it should seek to identify potential pain points — whether in the form of unsustainable debt burdens, security challenges, or institutional shortcomings — and formulate a strategy to assist these governments in addressing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-the-middle&quot;&gt;In the Middle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORRUPTION’S TOLL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent history of democracy in Brazil and Peru alike is in many ways the story of these countries’ attempts at reckoning with entrenched corruption. In the case of Brazil, domestic corruption not only consumed the country’s internal politics but touched virtually every country in the hemisphere in the form of the Odebrecht scandal. The Brazilian construction firm, which had grown to become the largest construction conglomerate in the hemisphere, would be uncovered in 2016 as having distributed an estimated $788 million in bribes throughout LAC, with scandals reaching across the Atlantic to Angola and Mozambique as well. The Odebrecht case followed on the heels of Operation Car Wash, a historic anticorruption investigation in Brazil which uncovered a web of money laundering and corruption valued in the billions and implicating Odebrecht, state-owned oil giant Petrobras, as well as three former presidents and countless serving and former government officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IvoH5ad.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 11: Corruption Scores over Time: Brazil and Peru.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022&quot;&gt;“Corruption Perceptions Index,” Transparency International, 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption, and the attendant controversies it spurred, led to the ousting of presidents in both Brazil and Peru. In 2016 Dilma Rousseff was formally impeached, with detractors accusing her of corruption while others maintained that the prosecution took place precisely because she refused to back down from the Operation Car Wash investigations. Then former president Lula da Silva was also tried and convicted for his involvement in the scandal, only for the case against him to later be annulled. In Peru, President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned ahead of a planned impeachment vote against him for his connections to the Odebrecht scandal. Accusations of corruption later dogged President Pedro Castillo, who prompted a constitutional crisis, attempting to dissolve the Peruvian Congress in a bid to avoid facing impeachment on corruption charges himself. The use of corruption as a cudgel is not new in regional politics, and both Brazil and Peru embody the complex and often tangled dynamics of corruption. On the one hand, corruption in both countries runs deep, giving politicians an easy accusation to level against their opponents and poisoning discourse and public opinion toward government. However, the mere existence of probes like Operation Car Wash, and intermittent but noteworthy progress on corruption investigations in Peru, suggest these countries remain willing and able to pursue high-profile instances of graft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also worthy of note is the fact that both the Odebrecht and Petrobras scandals were driven, in the case of Brazil, by domestic companies. China had little to do with these landmark cases despite its impressive penetration into both Brazilian and Peruvian economies. However, there remain troubling signs that China’s growing economic and business engagement, coupled with a preference for opaque backroom dealings, may present a dangerous combination for a region that already suffers from endemic corruption. This should be especially concerning for Brazil and Peru as the number one and two destinations for Chinese foreign direct investment in the hemisphere, respectively. In recent years, both countries have uncovered cases of illicit lumber trafficking tied to Chinese firms. In 2021, for instance, the governor of Madre de Dios department was accused of accepting bribes in exchange for overlooking an illegal logging operation headed by Chinese businessman Xiadong Ji Wu. How Brazil and Peru respond to these cases and implement effective transparency safeguards will play a major role in determining whether China’s engagement ends up being a bane or a boon for democracy in these two uncertain cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DYNAMISM AND DISCONTENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another feature of both Brazil and Peru’s recent political history has been a high degree of social contention, with mass protests and fierce political polarization accompanying changes in government. Political polarization may in fact be one of the reasons these countries have not undergone the same degree of democratic backsliding observed in Bolivia, El Salvador, or Venezuela, as new leaders rarely reach the levels of popularity needed to push through autocratic policies. Here as well, an underappreciated facet of China’s relationship to both countries has been the often unintentional effects of Chinese private sector engagement on exacerbating social and political strife. In Brazil, this can be seen with the ascension of Jair Bolsonaro to the presidency in 2018. While Bolsonaro initially promised a reset away from close ties to Beijing after previous administrations had drastically expanded China-Brazil trade ties, he swiftly began to revisit this proposition. Top Bolsonaro allies, especially in the agricultural industry, dispatched delegations to China, pursuing strengthened bilateral relations themselves while lobbying the government to make more farmland available for cultivation. Lula’s victory in 2022 subsequently prompted panic among agriculturalists, who worried the new administration’s policies would hamper their ability to produce more soy, beef, and sugar for export to China. Some of these farmers at the furthest political fringes would go on to play a key part in bankrolling the unsuccessful January 8 uprising to oust Lula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Peru, China’s participation in extractive industries, especially mining, has been a sustained political flashpoint. In particular, the Las Bambas copper mine, responsible for roughly 2 percent of global copper supply and majority-owned by the SOE China Minmetals, has repeatedly generated large-scale protests. First, in 2015 several demonstrators opposing development of the mine were killed by police; in 2021, following the election of President Castillo, local communities blocked roads surrounding the mine and disrupted production. For a left-wing populist government like Castillo’s, anti-mining protests were an especially pernicious challenge, striking at the heart of his coalition which saw him as granting a voice to Indigenous and rural communities traditionally victimized by extractive industries. Simultaneously, with an export commodity-driven economy wherein Chinese firms own seven of the largest mines and the PRC accounts for 34 percent of all trade in 2022, neither the Castillo nor the subsequent Boluarte government could afford to make extensive concessions against the mining industry. Accordingly, Las Bambas and other mines have remained sources of contention and protest well through 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trend can be found throughout the hemisphere and beyond. In Sri Lanka, demonstrations brought on by an economic crisis and mounting external debt — much of it to China — transformed into an uprising which briefly occupied the presidential palace and compelled a turnover in government. Returning to Ecuador, the Moreno government’s adoption of fiscal austerity to avoid letting its debts to China run out of control prompted a break in supporters, with many individuals who appreciated Moreno’s promotion of greater civil and political liberties turning against him when the social spending taps also dried up. In this way, China can often exert an unintentional but profound effect on domestic political stability, with concerning implications especially for LAC’s unconsolidated democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;backsliding-without-backers&quot;&gt;Backsliding without Backers?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/W7PeS8U.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXTERNAL ENABLERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cases of Nicaragua under Daniel Ortega and the Dominican Republic under Danilo Medina, backsliding took place absent significant engagement from the PRC. Both cases nonetheless adhere to many of the trends identified in those cases of backsliding that involved substantial engagement from China. In particular, both Ortega and Medina pursued constitutional reforms as a means of executive aggrandizement and removing the strictures of term limits (though in the latter case, Medina faced an upper limit with two consecutive terms). Both came to power within profoundly corrupt contexts and only worsened these conditions throughout their terms, with the Dominican Republic experiencing a net loss of 19 places on the Corruption Perceptions Index from 2012 to 2020 and Nicaragua a whopping net loss of 56 places from 2006 to 2022. Yet while neither could count on the economic might and authoritarian savvy of China to back their political projects initially, they were anything but cut off from sources of outside support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicaragua, in particular, has cultivated an extensive network of enablers as Ortega evinces a nigh-Orwellian level of commitment to stifle civil and political rights. In this regard, Ortega has relied upon his historic ties to Moscow, dating back to his Cold War dealings with the Soviet Union as a leader in the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). Russia in turn has furnished the Nicaraguan military with a range of military equipment, from tanks to armored vehicles and small arms, some of which have been tied directly to massacres of civilians by security forces. In the summer of 2022, Managua and Moscow advanced this relationship further, signing an agreement to allow Russian forces to deploy in Nicaragua to assist in “humanitarian and emergency responses, combatting organised crime and drug trafficking.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ortega has also benefited from a burgeoning intra-hemispheric authoritarian network forged by Cuba and Venezuela. As the three fully fledged LAC dictatorships, these countries have shown a significant degree of coordination and sharing, with Cuba serving as a model of a decades-old authoritarian regime now learned in all manner of tools for suppressing popular discontent and maintaining social control. Indeed, in 2018 when mass protests broke out across Nicaragua against Ortega’s proposed pension reforms, Cuban military intelligence officers were reported to be present in Nicaraguan jails, overseeing the interrogation and brutalization of political prisoners. In the case of Venezuela, Nicaragua forms a key link in a chain of illicit gold smuggling operations, helping launder illegal shipments into the international market and providing a much-needed economic lifeline to Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two backsliding cases also spotlight more nontraditional enabling forces, such as the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI), which under former executive president Dante Mossi allocated a disproportionate amount of its budget to projects in Nicaragua under dubious selection criteria and considerations for transparency. In the Dominican Republic, a Chinese firm was passed up for the contract to develop the Punta Catalina power plant in 2013. However, this was not a statement of geopolitical alignment on the part of the Medina government, but rather an election in favor of another source of “easy money” with links to corruption, as the contract was awarded to Odebrecht instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted however that protection dynamics appear to nevertheless be in play for both Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. For instance, the two countries ultimately switched their recognition from Taiwan to China at moments of regime vulnerability. By 2021 Ortega was facing down mounting international pressure in the wake of a blatantly stolen election; in 2018, Medina was gambling on an economic windfall from promised development projects that would bolster his popularity in the face of a fraying coalition and swirling questions around the possibility of a third term. Additionally, it is worth noting that Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic remain members of the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), and Washington has been reluctant to impose upon either the level of broad-sectoral sanctions it did against Venezuela. The fact that both countries waited for so long before seeking out another authoritarian backer was in turn perhaps influenced by the reluctance of the United States to take decisive action against deteriorating democratic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COALITIONS AND THEIR DOWNFALLS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases of Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic further underscore the importance of political parties and coalitions in enabling — as well as occasionally dismantling — authoritarian rule. Ortega and Medina benefited in their rise to power from a fragmented and ineffectual opposition, which in the former’s case allowed him to win the presidency without ever securing a majority of the votes. In the Dominican Republic, the powerful political machinery of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) saw some analysts categorize the country as an emerging one-party state. Yet ultimately Medina was undone in no small part by the brittleness of his own party and inability to maintain a handle over internal fractures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2006 elections in Nicaragua saw a split form within the Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC), the traditional opposition (and occasional opportunistic collaborator) to Ortega’s FSLN. This resulted in the vote becoming split between PLC candidate José Rizo and newly formed Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance candidate Eduardo Montealegre. Due to a constitutional change Ortega had brokered shortly before the election, he was able to ascend with a plurality of the vote, avoiding a runoff which would have given the anti-Ortega factions a chance to consolidate. Subsequently in 2011 Ortega benefited from a divided opposition unable to unite even in the face of clear signs that the president had been consolidating power at the expense of Nicaragua’s democratic institutions. Ortega’s victory, and the supermajority the FSLN gained in the legislature, helped to cement the pathway to democratic decline for the coming decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Dominican Republic, a weak opposition similarly helped ensure Medina’s victory in 2012 and grant him a commanding legislative position through which to implement his agenda. The PLD under Leonel Fernández had held the presidency for eight years prior to Medina’s rise. Meanwhile, the main opposition, the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), faced a schism resulting from the “blue ties pact” made between PRD party president Miguel Vargas and Fernández, which ensured cooperation between the two parties on a series of constitutional reforms but was seen by many within the opposition as an act of submission to the PLD. Without a strong opposition counterweight, Danilo Medina’s ascension was challenged only by his internal rivalry with Fernández for leadership of the PLD. Nevertheless, after eight years of government, this tension ultimately came to a head in 2020, when Medina sought to position his chosen successor, minister of public works and communications Gonzalo Castillo, as the next president in the face of a renewed bid from Fernández. Castillo cinched the nomination, only for Fernández to turn his back on the PLD entirely, forming a third-party platform which would help divide the vote in 2020 and create a pathway for PRD candidate Luis Abinader, who had been defeated by Medina in 2016, to reach the presidency. The same dynamics which had brought the Dominican Republic to the precipice of one-party rule now appeared to be the undoing of the PLD’s political monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiences form Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic suggest that, as strong legislatures can be bulwarks against democratic backsliding, internal party dynamics are also deserving of close scrutiny and can help enable the rise of autocrats to positions of power. The ability or failure of opposition groups to unite can play a decisive role in opening the path for consolidation of power, while mismanagement of one’s own coalition and party operations can bring an authoritarian project crashing back down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preceding case studies have indicated that China’s engagement in LAC has an identifiable deleterious effect on democracy in a number of ways. China engages in the promotion of authoritarianism by encouraging countries on the path of democratic backsliding to deepen their dependency on the PRC, as well as by promoting its model of citizen security and public order maintenance as a model to be replicated abroad. China helps protect authoritarian regimes and insulate them from the worst consequences of their actions by serving as a lender of last resort and offering diplomatic cover to initiatives like ALBA and CELAC, which seek to chip away at the idea that interstate relations in the Western Hemisphere flow from democratic principles. Furthermore, there are a multitude of unintended consequences to China’s engagement in the hemisphere that magnify political instability and contribute to the erosion of rule of law. The willingness of Chinese firms to engage in corruption or unfair business practices, for instance, feeds a damaging cycle of corruption that is alive and well throughout the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-key-takeaways-characteristics-of-democratic-backsliding-and-resilience&quot;&gt;Case Study Key Takeaways: Characteristics of Democratic Backsliding and Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveying the commonalities and differences between the 13 case studies makes it possible to begin sketching the contours of democratic backsliding and resilience in the Western Hemisphere and parse China’s role in these trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases of Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Venezuela point to two especially notable mechanisms through which China exerted a downward pressure on democracy. First, greater Chinese investment and trade flows appear to have the most detrimental effect when they occur in the context of an “isolation spiral,” wherein a country cuts itself off from sources of economic and development assistance traditionally associated with the United States and the liberal international order in favor of receiving a Chinese substitute. Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador under Correa stand out as especially acute examples of the isolation spiral in action, and even after a democratic second wind in Ecuador, the country has yet to free itself from the tendency to spiral back into reliance on Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, these countries seized on China’s robust domestic surveillance network to establish social control over potentially restive populations. Bolivia and Ecuador both rushed to acquire Chinese-made security cameras and related capabilities following their visits to the PRC. Venezuela has gone the farthest with its “Homeland Card” identification system, though there is little reason to expect the partnership between Caracas and Beijing will stop there. In this regard, China stands out from other extra-hemispheric authoritarians, such as Russia and Iran. While those governments may provide arms and equipment to militaries and police forces in LAC, China appears to be increasing its own vision of law and order, one which autocratic governments in the Western Hemisphere have thus far been disposed to embrace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all these trends depend on China’s involvement. China, for example, certainly does not appear to have played an appreciable role in facilitating the removal of presidential term limits in Venezuela, Bolivia, or Ecuador, nor is it reasonable to assume China has been responsible for the sky-high approval rating boasted by Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, which has allowed him to successfully dismantle checks on executive power. These elements underscore the multicausal nature of democratic backsliding, wherein China can play an important, but not all-encompassing role. Indeed, for the above cases, a confluence of internal and external drivers was necessary to generate sustained erosion of democratic values and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s engagement alone is also far from a death sentence for democracy, as the cases of Chile, Panama, and Uruguay attest. Nevertheless, all three of these cases possessed common features which rendered them resistant not only to major backsliding, but to China’s other forms of influence as well. Most notably, the three countries were all insulated against the siren song of the isolation spiral, as they already boasted impressive preexisting development and infrastructure capacity prior to engaging heavily with China. Furthermore, the presence of active civil societies, as well as capable and well-institutionalized legislatures in the three countries, served as important checks on government power and, in some cases, played a role in directly curtailing China’s influence over the countries. These findings suggest that, where countries are able to effectively discern and subsequently channel certain facets of PRC influence and engagement they choose to permit, China’s presence in the hemisphere can be a powerful force for economic growth and development. Even so, this is not a perfect formula, as China’s growing dominance in the Chilean energy sector and Panamanian mining industry underscores — the absence of backsliding in these three cases does not mean that China lacks the means to influence policymaking in strategic areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the uncertain cases of Brazil and Peru demonstrate how China’s engagement has penetrated deep into the very fabric of political order in both countries. While endemic corruption is a persistent challenge across LAC, in Brazil and Peru it has acquired a particular salience in the political realm, having directly unseated leaders and been wielded as a political weapon of choice. To this end, China’s preference for opaque business dealings risks fueling corruption in these countries and further adding to the governance challenges faced by both. China has also had a more subtle, but nevertheless pronounced effect on political polarization in Brazil and Peru. China’s appetite for raw materials has pushed successive administrations in Peru to weaken environmental and social protections for communities affected by extractive industries, a consistent pain point in that country’s politics. Meanwhile, the tangled connections between China’s demand for foodstuffs, Brazilian agribusiness, and an extremely polarized electoral context saw Brazil face one of the most acute threats to its democracy in decades. Unlike the isolation spiral or China’s citizen security efforts, which constitute more overt means by which the CCP looks to spread its influence, China’s role in corruption and fomenting political polarization appears more unintentional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, which both experienced backsliding without substantial engagement from China, nevertheless assiduously cultivated other backers disposed to work with autocratic and corruption-prone governments. For Nicaragua, this came in the form of Russia, while in the case of the Medina government in the Dominican Republic, Odebrecht filled the role of China in part with its easy access to lending and willingness to grease the wheels of government graft in the pursuit of economic gain. Ultimately, it is telling that both countries did pursue closer relations with the PRC toward the end of the observation period. This points to the importance of the protection mechanism in understanding democratic backsliding, as both Ortega and Medina came to rely on external support to maintain their hold on power, and both ultimately came to view the PRC as a vital component of this scaffold on their autocratic edifice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the case studies of Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, which suffered democratic backsliding, as well as the case of Ecuador, which ultimately retreated from the precipice of authoritarian consolidation, all illustrate the contingent nature of democratic backsliding and resiliency. In each of the case studies, but most notably in these three, key developments hinged upon a set of variables mired in uncertainty, whose emergence took place at unexpected moments. The fracturing of organized opposition in Nicaragua, the split within the PLD in the Dominican Republic, and the willingness of Lenín Moreno to backtrack on his predecessor’s tentpole policies all had ripple effects of immense consequence for the democratic (and antidemocratic) trajectories of all three countries. Highlighting the role of contingency is important, not only to encourage a degree of humility when prognosticating about the future of democracy in LAC, but also to demonstrate that an overabundance of caution is warranted when it comes to factors that could potentially push countries over the edge and into autocracy. It is not always readily apparent what will make the difference in the moment, and accordingly, any factor that appears negatively correlated with democracy, such as China’s engagement, should be cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counteracting the most corrosive elements of China’s engagement in LAC will require a fine-grained and practical strategic posture that accounts for the needs of the region in addition to the unique threat profile the PRC presents. Such a strategy must also be practical and recognize that competing geopolitical priorities will inherently pull resources away from the hemisphere. Wherever possible, the United States will need to work with like-minded allies to shape a strategy that is more than the sum of its parts. Above all, the United States must recognize that its strategy for engaging LAC cannot be a “China-first” approach; it must emphasize meeting partners where they are while sufficiently emphasizing the China-element for its domestic political exigencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contours-of-a-democracy-first-strategy-for-lac&quot;&gt;Contours of a Democracy-First Strategy for LAC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the geopolitical value of constraining China’s influence in LAC has been well-articulated, the importance of maintaining the democratic character of the hemisphere in the face of rising authoritarian influence has received less attention. Some analysts have gone so far as to suggest that the United States seek to partner with regional authoritarians in a bid to peel these governments away from their backers in Beijing and Moscow that smacks of realpolitik. However, the nature of the Western Hemisphere’s dictatorships, riven as they are by corruption, mismanagement, and criminality, means that even if the United States were successful in such a rebalancing, these governments could offer little save further destabilization, while undermining U.S. claims of pursuing a values-based foreign policy. Venezuela, for instance, which seems to have been posited as a potential solution to spiking energy prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, has yet to surpass 1 million barrels per day of production, less than half its 2016 levels. Instead, the Maduro regime has only succeeded in endangering its neighbor and rising energy superpower Guyana through saber-rattling around the disputed Essequibo region. Simply put, it makes little geostrategic sense to engage LAC’s dictatorships for any reason other than to advocate for their return to democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a foreign policy based on engagement with and strengthening of fellow democracies promises to pay dividends in the Western Hemisphere. As previously noted, shared commitment to democracy and human rights has formed the basis for the shared value system that has underpinned hemispheric relations since the signing of the IADC. As the United States confronts an increasingly divided world, preservation of these bonds will be essential, especially within its own neighborhood. Relatedly, unlike Venezuela and Guyana, robust, consolidated democracies nearly never come to blows with one another — helping to preserve the hemisphere as a realm of interstate placidity, which benefits all countries in the form of enhanced trade and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sketching a strategy for preserving democratic systems in countries where these are already healthy, countering entrenched authoritarians, and competing with extra-hemispheric players like the PRC for influence in edge cases requires a modification to the “insulate, curtail, compete” framework outlined in a previous CSIS report. Specific policy prescriptions for all three cases are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where Democracy Holds Fast – Insulate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For countries whose democratic health is not in question at present, the United States should seek to strengthen institutions and insulate governments from the most corrosive forms of China’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Adumbrate a strategy to counter economic coercion in the hemisphere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in countries that have successfully resisted or minimized the most deleterious effects of China’s influence on their democracies, the risk of China’s potential coercive influence continues to loom large. As one CSIS study has noted, “as China has grown economically, so too has its propensity to engage in acts of economic coercion against both its neighbors and more distant countries.” While China has thus far not deployed its coercive tool kit in the region to the extent it has against countries such as Australia or Japan, should a LAC country pursue a policy China deems as inimical to its strategic interests — such as moving to restrict critical mineral exports to the PRC or considering reverting diplomatic recognition to Taiwan — it is not unthinkable to see Beijing pursue a more aggressive geoeconomic policy in the hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAC countries face a number of vulnerabilities that could leave them susceptible to coercive strategies in the future, from overreliance on a small subset of commodities for economic stability to weak cybersecurity infrastructure that leaves them vulnerable to asymmetric forms of pressure. In 2022, for instance, Costa Rica suffered a debilitating cyberattack which brought down vital government services including healthcare databases and social security records. The attack was attributed to the pro-Russian Conti Group, who demanded millions to unlock the systems; the attack may have been brought on as a result of Costa Rica’s alignment with the United States in sanctioning Moscow. A potential Chinese coercive strategy could entail similar cyber operations, combined with the imposition of heightened import duties on agricultural or mineral shipments and even the leveraging of critical infrastructure like power generation, which Chinese SOEs have acquired a domineering stake in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should lead a regionwide effort with partner countries to review vulnerabilities in their economies that may be targeted for coercion and map these onto existing nearshoring priorities. In certain sectors, like the metals trade, this could be relatively straightforward and dovetail with exiting initiatives to fortify U.S. access to critical minerals. In other sectors, such as agriculture, where the United States is more competitor than buyer, the United States should seek to facilitate access for LAC countries into new markets like the European Union. Additional components of such a strategy may include allocating funds for relieving targeted countries or sectors, either through the creation of a new “coercion compensation fund” or an expansion of the Development Finance Corporation’s (DFC) political risk insurance authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Expand democratic partnerships.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Core to any strategy of democracy promotion is ensuring that leaders and their citizens feel as if “democracy delivers.” U.S. efforts in this regard have been seen as sorely lacking, as evidenced by the 2023 Summit of the Americas wherein analysts attributed the boycotts of several LAC heads of state to a pervasive sense that there was little to be lost by not attending in person. The rise of multilateral forums, such as CELAC, which unlike the OAS do not center democracy and civil and political rights in their dealings further points to a drift away from both the United States and democratic diplomacy as a whole in the hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reverse this trend, the United States should work to regalvanize the OAS as the body through which countries engage on the most pressing and high-level issues. One option could be to restructure the councils to create elevated roles for major regional players like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, to grant these countries a greater voice and stake in the actions of the organization. The United States should also look to promising initiatives that have emerged organically from LAC countries such as the Alliance for Development in Democracy. Founded by Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and Panama in 2021, and later joined by Ecuador under the Lasso administration, the alliance seeks to showcase the intertwined relationship between democratic governance and economic opportunity. The United States should uplift this grouping, potentially by offering to host a summit for members and encouraging other robust democracies within the region to seek membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States should leverage APEP to encourage the adoption and strengthening of civil and political rights throughout its hemisphere. At present, the partnership appears as a “menu” of voluntary standards members are invited to select from in return for nebulous benefits. The United States can color in the gaps in APEP by both leaning into the importance of adhering to good governance standards and using APEP as an umbrella under which to house the multitude of additional economic and trade initiatives the Biden administration has created. These include money for semiconductor development made possible through the International Technology Security and Innovation fund established in the CHIPS Act. APEP can also be tied to the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) intended to strengthen collaboration on critical mineral supply chains. Countries that adhere to certain APEP standards should therefore be considered on the “short list” for inclusion in these initiatives. The DFC may also play a role, establishing an expedited process for responding to proposals for APEP members, or possibly creating another exemption to the BUILD Act’s low-income focus for countries in APEP. Bringing these initiatives to bear will not only ensure a partnership, by extension making the U.S.-led democratic “club” feel worthwhile to join, but also help regional democracies better deliver for their own citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Invest in legislative strengthening and modernization.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the fall of dictatorships throughout the region, efforts to improve the quality of governance and help nascent democracies rise to their feet abounded. Legislative strengthening was one of the most significant among these programs; this referred broadly to efforts aimed at allowing national congresses, assemblies, and parliaments — many of which had existed as rubber stamp bodies if they existed at all — to effectively govern. Key initiatives included standing up budget offices and research institutions under the auspices of the legislature which could provide policymakers with information needed to make informed decisions on the pieces of legislation they were asked to debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, legislatures serve as some of the most important bulwarks against executive aggrandizement in LAC. Yet these bodies are facing new pressures that make efforts to strengthen their functions all the more important. First, political polarization has in several cases weakened executives throughout the hemisphere, leaving the fate of governance in the hands of factitious assemblies controlled by a growing number of parties, resulting in what one scholar has deemed “underground parliamentarism.” Second, the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions on gatherings forced many legislatures to rapidly adopt new technologies and virtual or hybrid meeting protocols. These create new opportunities for transparency, but they also expose vulnerabilities to cyberespionage and digital dis- and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the United States should redouble its legislative strengthening efforts in LAC, led by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) alongside party institutions like the National Democratic Institute and International Republican Institute, with a focus on sharing strategies for identifying disinformation, strengthening cybersecurity, and developing public databases and tools for citizens to better follow the progress of legislation. The United States can also increase bilateral exchanges with legislators and staff from LAC traveling to the United States to learn about how Washington has sought to rise to these challenges, as well as dispatching U.S. congressional and staff delegations to the region to learn more about local contexts. Furthermore, such initiatives should include an emphasis on raising awareness about China’s ILD activities and their use to disseminate pro-CCP narratives among LAC political parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States could engage the European Union to join these initiatives. The extensive experience of European democracies in managing coalition dynamics and accounting for a multiplicity of parties within their legislatures could be invaluable in helping LAC navigate its current challenges with political representation and bring shadow parliamentarism into the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where Democracy Has Dissipated – Curtail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For countries that are at an advanced stage of democratic backsliding or else have even transitioned into consolidated autocracies, the United States should seek to curtail China’s ability to prop up and empower authoritarian governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Develop early warning indicators.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is far easier to seek to halt democratic backsliding than to bring a consolidated authoritarian regime back to democracy. Accordingly, the United States should develop and articulate a clear set of indicators to identify democratic backsliding while it is in progress. The findings from the case study analysis can serve as important starting points in this regard. Signs like attempts to remove term limits, use of excessive force in response to protests, and attempts to cultivate economic safety nets with authoritarian governments all stand out as initial red flags. An excellent recent example of early warning and action transpired in Guatemala to counter the undemocratic actions of those who sought to prevent then president-elect Bernardo Arévalo from assuming office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While identifying early signs of backsliding on its own means little absent further steps toward reversing this trend, a robust set of indicators will nevertheless help the United States deploy limited resources more judiciously. For instance, while both Panama and Honduras face challenges around impunity and corruption within their judiciaries, the Castro administration’s efforts to end-run the selection of a new attorney general merits greater concern as a sign of a concerted effort to centralize control over the justice system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also strive to build support around these indicators with like-minded countries in the hemisphere to leverage more voices speaking out against cases of backsliding. Countries like Chile, Uruguay, and members of the Alliance for Development in Democracy could all be worthwhile partners in this regard, as should relevant civil society organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Disrupt authoritarian networks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autocrats can rarely sustain their grip on power without cultivating external backers. In all cases of democratic backsliding studied, the regime in question counted on some form of outside support, whether from intra-hemispheric dictatorships or increasingly from China as the country with the most resources and least scruples when it comes to the types of regimes engaged. Today, a robust network of collaboration exists between Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela within the Western Hemisphere, while each of these countries in turn engage (to varying degrees) with Russia, China, and Iran as external backers. For U.S. pressure against dictatorships in LAC to be more effective, these networks of mutual support ought to be disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) should be designated lead on an investigation into sources of trade flows between hemispheric dictatorships and external authoritarian regimes to map key nodes and the actors responsible for bankrolling these governments. The OFAC can also investigate specifically Chinese firms operating in the Western Hemisphere’s dictatorships, and it could consider imposing new sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for profiting off illicit economic activity or assisting these governments to repress their populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multilateral cooperation will be essential here as well. Fortunately, the international sanctions campaign against Russia provides a useful model for best practices in maintaining a global coalition for economic pressure. The United States could spearhead work within the G7 to harmonize policies on issues like illegal gold trafficking or arms sales to countries with records of human rights abuse by security forces. The United States can also lean on partners like Japan and Taiwan to use their influence within CABEI to increase scrutiny on investments going to Nicaragua specifically. Within the hemisphere, the United States can step up intelligence-sharing initiatives with allies and work to coordinate displays of solidarity such as a joint declaration by multiple countries that their airspace cannot be used by flights carrying Chinese or Russian military personnel to Cuba, Nicaragua, or Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, even the most tight-knit web of sanctions enforcement cannot prevent authoritarian regimes from cooperating with each other to maintain their grip on power. Nevertheless, looking at the support networks that exist between autocracies, rather than the individual regimes in isolation, promises to open new opportunities to pressure these governments and degrade the ability of dictators in the Western Hemisphere to survive in the face of domestic and international pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Develop proactive strategies for countering digital authoritarianism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The co-option of digital tools by autocrats has proven one of the most troubling developments in the fight against authoritarianism in LAC. From mis- and disinformation to internet shutdowns and mass surveillance, the tools of digital authoritarianism are manifold and inimical to a free and open civil society. Digital authoritarianism is also another case in which cooperation among dictatorships has proven most robust, with China leading the way but Cuba also making important contributions to the spread of mis- and disinformation tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, responses to digital authoritarianism have tended to be reactive, responding after the fact. A fortified strategy should carry greater emphasis on proactive responses that aim to bolster civil society in the face of digital repression and unbalance authoritarian regimes in the information space. This should include connecting civil society and democracy advocates across sectors, for instance bringing cybersecurity experts in touch with investigative journalists and polling organizations. Training journalists on open-source intelligence (OSINT) collection is also essential in countries where the official media context has become polluted with disinformation and propaganda. Helping journalists better leverage OSINT tools is also key in cases like Nicaragua where extreme repression has forced many news outlets and journalists into exile. Leveraging geolocation, anonymous source vetting, and data analysis are critical to allow journalists in exile to report accurately on developments within the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also invest in the development of new technologies to provide internet access in countries where governments seek to cut off web access in order to hinder mass mobilization efforts. Satellite internet companies like Starlink and Amazon’s Project Kuiper can help to fill this void in contexts where governments shut off the internet entirely. Meanwhile, at the international level, the United States should engage heavily in forums such as the International Telecommunication Union to oppose Chinese efforts to encourage data localization, a move which could allow other authoritarian regimes to cut off their internets from the world and get their hands on a treasure trove of sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States should strenuously oppose efforts to replicate Venezuela’s Homeland Card model in other authoritarian countries or beyond, and it should step up efforts to highlight the complicity of companies like Huawei and ZTE in repression both within China and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where Democracy Is Unsure – Compete&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For countries whose democratic future is uncertain, the United States should emphasize a strategy to outcompete China for influence over critical sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Bring in the private sector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a contest for economic influence with China, the United States’ greatest asset is its vibrant and dynamic private sector. U.S. companies invest throughout the region in sectors ranging from manufacturing and heavy industry to advanced technologies, software, and biomedical devices, with many also enjoying long-standing ties to LAC, having been in the region for decades. For countries that risk falling into an isolation spiral as a consequence of their dependence on China for economic support, an injection of U.S. and U.S.-aligned capital can grant breathing room to course-correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Commerce, in coordination with local embassies, should also endeavor to bring delegations of U.S. companies through the region to spotlight emerging opportunities for investment, while legislative initiatives such as the Western Hemisphere Nearshoring Act can provide a substantial boon to companies looking to relocate their operations from East Asia closer to home. In some sectors, it may also be necessary to look beyond the U.S. private sector. Competing with Huawei in the telecommunications sector, for instance, will require engaging with Ericsson and Nokia, which are headquartered in Sweden and Japan respectively. Reforming U.S. Export-Import Bank rules will allow these companies to qualify for export credits to serve as trusted vendors for LAC’s telecommunications development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFC has a major role to play in unlocking the potential of the private sector within LAC. The organization should seek to bolster ties to businesses to learn what these firms need and fine tune its approach to buying down risk so that private enterprise can better engage in key countries. Congress should also communicate a clear mandate for the DFC to pursue projects of strategic and national security relevance during the BUILD Act reauthorization process in 2024. This signal will help the entity push back against a culture of risk aversion that has built up within the DFC, and it will encourage the corporation to make more active use of the many exceptions to its mandate to work primarily in low- and lower-middle-income countries — a requirement which has hindered investments in LAC, which features a sizeable number of middle-income economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Prioritize citizen security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public safety or citizen security issues present a perfect storm for China-LAC relations. On the one hand, insecurity and organized crime challenges are mounting throughout the region, exerting pressure on politicians to take decisive action on citizen security issues. At the same time, heavy-handed security policies are closely correlated with democratic backsliding, a phenomenon thrown into stark relief by El Salvador. Finally, security issues are an area where the PRC has made a concerted push to displace the United States and position its own model as the gold standard for social order and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should focus on putting forward a clear counteroffer, led by U.S. law enforcement agencies and the State Department’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. In doing so, the United States must critically examine its history of security engagement in the hemisphere. While past efforts saw success, the United States’ reputation has suffered from a perception that Washington cares solely about countering narcotics trafficking, and not necessarily about improving the lot of ordinary citizens who suffer the most at the hands of transnational criminal organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ecuador will be an especially critical case over the coming years as a country that faces mounting security challenges, sees sizeable Chinese influence, and is navigating a fraught moment in its democratic trajectory. Before departing office, the Lasso administration forged a new security partnership with the United States, an initiative which incoming President Noboa is disposed to continue with. The United States should endeavor to apply best practices from previous security assistance efforts like Plan Colombia and the Mérida Initiative, with a focus on capacity building among the Ecuadoran police forces to conduct community policing, along with the introduction of technological modernization efforts paired with training on data management and protection of privacy rights. Furthermore, the United States should keep careful tabs on the effectiveness of its security assistance to Ecuador to develop a model or set of common forms of assistance it can offer to other countries suffering rising insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final initiative for the United States to consider is opening a new International Law Enforcement Academy in the Caribbean to complement the two existing such institutions in El Salvador and New Mexico, which offer trainings for police forces from LAC countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Double down on core competencies in education, defense, and disaster response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many sectors in which the United States will struggle to compete with the PRC for influence, it is important to appreciate the significant advantages Washington already holds and to take steps to extend this lead. U.S. institutions still exert a powerful pull of gravity upon the region, with tens of thousands of students from LAC traveling to the United States each year to pursue an education in a staggering number of fields. The United States remains the partner of choice for defense cooperation with the vast majority of countries in the hemisphere. Relatedly, U.S. HADR efforts remain a key source of soft power and a vital core competency for SOUTHCOM and USAID to preserve in the face of worsening severe weather events and disasters in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to education, the United States should work to fortify cooperation between domestic universities and LAC institutions and encourage greater reciprocal exchange. The United States can also increase scholarships awarded to students from the region — not just for university and graduate students, but also for those studying trade professions, with a special emphasis on upskilling and reskilling workers to bolster workforces throughout LAC to grow the human capital needed to take advantage of nearshoring opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the defense sector, the United States should also recognize its qualitative edge when it comes to professional military education. To build upon these advantages, the Department of Defense should revisit its Section 312 and 321 restrictions on funding for personnel from upper-middle and upper income countries to receive funding to participate in security cooperation meetings or trainings. The United States should also revisit its approach to foreign military sales to establish an expedited process for delivering regional armed forces the types of practical equipment — such as trucks, uniforms, and personal protective equipment — that are in high demand by LAC militaries and happen to be a sector where China has proven capable of furnishing on much shorter timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the HADR space, hours and even minutes can make a difference between life and death. Currently, U.S. posture requires a disaster assistance declaration to be made by USAID before SOUTHCOM and other response assets can be directed toward a crisis. The United States should seek to reverse this process by signing agreements with key allies to allow U.S. HADR personnel to respond upon request by an affected country, rather than waiting for internal bureaucratic wheels to turn. While the proximity of U.S. forces to the region means that for now the United States is far better positioned to meet the HADR needs of the hemisphere, failure to hone this capability while China bolsters its own expeditionary HADR tool kit risks the United States being caught off-guard and potentially losing a key tool for soft power while also imperiling disaster-affected communities across LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is one of the most digitally advanced and integrated societies anywhere in the world. While its more well-known neighbor in this space, Estonia, began its digitalization in earnest more than 20 years ago, Ukraine’s e-government initiatives have taken place rapidly and largely in crisis conditions. The government launched early innovations primarily to combat corruption, such as the e-procurement platform ProZorro, after the Maidan revolution in 2014, but it escalated its digitalization push after the election of President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019 and onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 gave even greater urgency to move public services online, and the government was well positioned to respond, building on a foundation that had been laid over the previous four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the government of Ukraine and its international partners look to the postwar future and begin planning for reconstruction, this rapid and widespread digitalization presents both innovative opportunities and unprecedented risks. This report outlines four strategies to center human rights values within a future post-conflict digital governance framework in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the government must continue to effectively safeguard e-governance systems and critical private infrastructure from external attacks. The widespread reliance on digital systems means that outages, whether accidental or intentional, will seriously impact the ability of vulnerable Ukrainians to access public services. Similarly, these systems must safeguard personal information from malicious external actors, both state-sponsored and criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, even as digitalization continues to expand, government ministries must take concrete action to ensure the accessibility of services for all Ukrainians. Both the public and private sectors should expand solutions for populations who cannot access online services, whether due to lack of digital infrastructure, affordability of access, limited digital literacy or Ukrainian language ability, or disability. The expansion of online access should go hand in hand with offline options to reach populations whose voices would otherwise be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the government should engage in dialogue with citizens on the appropriate limitations of surveillance technologies in peacetime. The success of digitalization relies on public trust that the government will use data and authorities to benefit citizens and not to undermine their rights. To that end, the surveillance authorities and tools developed during the war should be subject to public discussion and debate, and any continued deployment in a post-conflict environment should be subject to high standards of transparency and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as Ukraine works toward membership in the European Union, it will need to ensure consistency with emerging EU standards on digital technology, including with respect to privacy and surveillance, facial recognition technology, and other emerging human rights issues. Ukraine should carefully consider the European Union’s direction of travel as it continues to develop the legal architecture that governs its digital space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-on-ukraines-digitalization&quot;&gt;Background on Ukraine’s Digitalization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-rapid-rise-of-ukraines-digital-state&quot;&gt;The Rapid Rise of Ukraine’s Digital State&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s move toward e-government has taken place at unprecedented speed. Estonia — the country most known for its extensive e-government systems — began developing its architecture and socializing the idea of online services with its citizens in the early 2000s. By contrast, Ukraine’s development of digital solutions — which now matches, and in some cases exceeds, Estonia’s own offerings — has taken place entirely since the Maidan revolution of 2014 and in large part over the last four years. This effort has revolutionized how the government of Ukraine manages information and how citizens engage with their government. In 2016, none of Ukraine’s government registries, which house everything from birth certificates to drivers’ licenses, were digitalized. By 2020, nearly all of them were. In 2019, only 8 percent of Ukrainians used online public services; today at least 44 percent of Ukrainians — nearly 20 million people — use the e-government app Diia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProZorro — Ukraine’s groundbreaking open-source public procurement platform designed to reduce corruption in government projects — was launched in 2015, and the government estimates it has saved more than $1.6 billion (60 billion Ukrainian hryvnia) by using the platform. Trembita, an interoperability system built on the Estonian model that facilitates the secure exchange of data between users and state databases, began operating in 2019. Working together with the Vulyk automation system that stores digital versions of documents from about 600 administrative service centers across Ukraine, Trembita paved the way for the world’s first fully digital ID, which rolled out in 2020, and which Ukrainians can use as an official form of identification for all government transactions inside the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These systems also paved the way for the cellphone app Diia, which launched in February 2020 and offers users access to government services from one digital location. The app was originally designed to reduce corruption by allowing Ukrainians to directly apply for permits and conduct other basic business with government offices without the opportunity for bribery. It does not store data directly, relying on Trembita and Vulyk to access information. This provides an important security measure. Before the full-scale Russian invasion, Diia allowed citizens to access 50 government services, including applying for benefits, paying taxes, registering businesses, acquiring permits, and — perhaps most crucially in the context of the war — accessing important documents. Since then, it has expanded to include over 120 services, with new applications coming online nearly every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while Ukraine is a highly technological society, there is a large digital literacy gap, with demographic factors like age, income, geographic location, and gender playing a role. A 2023 survey by the Ministry of Digital Transformation found that approximately 40 percent of Ukrainians aged 18 to 70 had “no” or “low” digital literacy skills. Age was a major factor; 74 percent of individuals ages 60 to 70 reported low to no digital skills, compared to just 15.4 percent of those ages 18 to 29. In addition, the ministry found that 60 percent of adults with below average incomes had no or low digital skills, compared to 18 percent of those with above average incomes. In 2019, during the ministry’s most recent assessment of digital accessibility gaps by geographic location, 20 percent of Ukraine’s rural population had no digital skills, with the majority of those individuals above age 60. The International Telecommunication Union has also noted a slight gender gap: 82 percent of Ukrainian men and 77 percent of women were online in 2021, suggesting that women in Ukraine may have somewhat fewer opportunities to utilize digital services. Ukraine will need to continue to address these disparities, alongside other risks, as it ramps up its digitalization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-importance-of-building-trust&quot;&gt;The Importance of Building Trust&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-government solutions are often deployed as a strategy to build public trust in government, as has been the case in Ukraine with the ProZorro procurement platform and the Diia app, both of which were designed to reduce corruption. But the reverse is also true: the successful expansion of e-government services requires high levels of public trust, as governments seek to access and collect sensitive personal information online. Trust is especially crucial as e-government evolves beyond the digitalization of traditional government functions like issuing ID cards or business licenses — where citizens might expect their government to already store their information — to the collection and use of newer or more sensitive information such as biometric data, job status, health metrics, or physical location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government of Ukraine has already moved in this direction. Electronic health records were introduced in 2019, including newborn registration via “e-Baby” and later electronic Covid-19 vaccination records. “Diia.Digital Signature” allows users to digitally sign documents by taking a face scan on their cell phone, which it then compares to biometric data stored in existing government databases to verify identity in real time. In the context of the war, Ukrainians have been able to use the Diia app to report the location of alleged Russian troops or spies (e-Enemy) and report physical damage to their homes in order to receive refugee, repair, and economic recovery payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The successful expansion of e-government services requires high levels of public trust, as governments seek to access and collect sensitive personal information online.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Ukraine’s 2019 election, trust in government among Ukrainians was the lowest in Europe, at a mere 8 percent. This rose in the early days of President Zelensky’s term and amid the Covid-19 pandemic to the low 20s, matching highs experienced by previous Ukrainian administrations. However, the government still faced an enormous trust gap, with more than half the population expressing little or no trust in government. Following the Russian invasion, trust in President Zelensky shot up, hitting 80 percent by May 2023, while 32 percent reported trusting the national government to fight corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This boost in public confidence, along with Ukraine’s high internet penetration rates and above-average internet literacy, has likely facilitated the relatively easy expansion of Ukraine’s e-government solutions. The creation of a digital state was central to President Zelensky’s presidential campaign, and this theme has remained a priority throughout his time in office. Building on citizens’ enthusiasm for digitalization, the Ukrainian government implemented a successful advertising campaign ahead of Diia’s launch. This campaign, which was supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), helped spread awareness of the app and build trust in the government’s broader digitalization goals. Diia was largely welcomed by Ukrainians and did not experience organized opposition during its initial launch or subsequent expansion. Despite the app’s novelty, Diia launched seamlessly with no glitches and has continued to function throughout the pandemic and war, which has allowed trust to deepen over time. This is evidenced by the addition of nearly 6 million Diia users in 2022, reaching 18.5 million Ukrainians on the app and almost 22 million on the web portal by January 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, in a 2022 Gallup poll, 74 percent of Ukrainians believed corruption was widespread in government and 78 percent believed it was widespread in the private sector. Ukraine’s score on the Corruption Perceptions Index has risen only slightly — from 25 out of 100 in 2013 to 36 out of 100 in 2023 (lower than Belarus, 37, and only slightly higher than Russia, 26). However, 2023 saw a decrease in trust following major corruption scandals unveiled by the media. The World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, which assesses countries on corruption and other factors, placed Ukraine 118th out of 142 countries surveyed in 2023. As a result, although the war has increased Ukrainians’ confidence in their government, the historical perception of pervasive corruption and recent scandals remain an obstacle to long-term trust building that the Ukrainian government and private sector will both need to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while the recent boost in confidence is well-earned, driven by the government’s unexpected successes both on and off the battlefield, it is not clear whether it will persist in the long term. In similar circumstances where societies faced a common enemy — the United States after 9/11, France after the 2015 Paris attacks — rapid increases in trust in government quickly fell as the crises passed. To channel this momentum into long-term change, the government of Ukraine must continue to proactively build public trust — not only through the deployment of technology to further its anti-corruption mission but also by maintaining transparency, accountability, and open dialogue about the expansion of its digitalization. Digitalization alone cannot guarantee trust in government; technology can reduce opportunities for corruption, but it can also enable the misuse of data, crackdowns on civil society and free speech, and invasions of privacy. In the end, whether digitalization is a force for good or ill in Ukrainian government will hinge on the transparency and accountability mechanisms that are built into these systems and the enforcement of laws to protect individuals from abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the end, whether digitalization is a force for good or ill in Ukrainian government will hinge on the transparency and accountability mechanisms that are built into these systems and the enforcement of laws to protect individuals from abuse.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four-strategies-to-center-human-rights-in-post-conflict-digital-governance&quot;&gt;Four Strategies to Center Human Rights in Post-conflict Digital Governance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the government of Ukraine and its international partners look to the postwar future and begin planning for reconstruction, this rapid and widespread digitalization presents both unprecedented opportunities and risks. This report outlines four strategies to center human rights values within a future post-conflict digital governance framework in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;safeguarding-e-governance-and-critical-private-systems-from-future-attack&quot;&gt;Safeguarding E-Governance and Critical Private Systems from Future Attack&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, all of Ukraine’s government databases are online and connected by default — including those that handle civil, tax, social security, healthcare, and voter information. This expands the availability of services and creates more efficient and accountable government but also introduces risks of cyberattacks. Breaches could compromise personal data or cut off citizens’ ability to access government websites and applications. Since Ukrainians cannot opt out of the online storage of their personal information, the government’s ability to consistently secure those systems against attack is vital to building institutional trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MITIGATING AND PREVENTING CYBERATTACKS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks can disrupt government activity and threaten critical infrastructure in nearly any country. There are few countries, however, where government services are as dependent on digital infrastructure as Ukraine’s. The e-governance system — and its enormous impact on public trust in government, as described above — is therefore a key target of state and non-state actors seeking to defeat Ukraine militarily or otherwise undermine its sovereignty and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks have been a hallmark of Russia’s efforts to undermine Ukraine’s government, both prior to and throughout the full-scale invasion. In the weeks leading up to and following the invasion, Russian government hackers and private actors launched several cyberattacks against the Ukrainian government and private sector. These included distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that knocked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ukrainian embassy in the United States offline. Russian cyber criminals also reportedly spread misinformation suggesting that Ukrainian ATMs were offline, presumably in an attempt to undermine the public confidence in the banking system. These attacks have continued throughout the war. According to senior Ukrainian officials, Russian hackers were responsible for 1,655 cyberattacks against Ukraine between February and December 2022. Of these attacks, more than 300 targeted the security and defense sector, 500 targeted other government entities, and 400 targeted private organizations with a direct impact on civilians (including energy, telecommunications, financial, and software companies). One recent cyberattack disrupted access to Ukraine’s biggest cellular network, Kyivstar, for 24.3 million people and damaged the air raid alert system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cyberattacks can disrupt government activity and threaten critical infrastructure in nearly any country. There are few countries, however, where government services are as dependent on digital infrastructure as Ukraine’s.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has responded to these threats by implementing state-of-the-art cybersecurity protections that have thus far kept government services online and safeguarded personal data. Diia, for example, does not retain information, which minimizes opportunities for data leaks, and Trembita’s state-of-the-art cryptography ensures that it conveys information securely. Investments from allied governments have also played a key role in shoring up cybersecurity defenses. The United States, United Kingdom, and European Union have worked with Ukraine on its digitalization efforts since 2016, via the Transparency and Accountability in Public Administration and Services (TAPAS) project and the EGOV4UKRAINE project implemented through the Estonian eGovernance Academy. In June 2023, the United States pledged to provide at least $37 million in cybersecurity support for Ukraine, which would increase total assistance to at least $82 million since February 2022 (of a total $120 million since 2016) to “strengthen Ukraine’s capacity to detect, deter, and respond to cyber incidents and threats, and . . . protect critical networks and digital infrastructure.” USAID has also pledged an additional $200 million to fund democracy, governance, and human rights work in Ukraine, which includes funding for the Digital Restoration Ecosystem for Accountable Management (DREAM) project and other digitalization efforts to support Ukraine’s post-conflict recovery. The EU4DigitalUA project also provided significant support toward additional Diia functions in response to emerging needs, and the United Kingdom also provided support for cyber incident response, information sharing, software, and hardware. In December 2023, the United States and nine other countries formalized the Tallinn Mechanism, an initiative to help Ukraine improve its long-term cyber resilience and defend itself in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after the conflict began, U.S. private companies worked with Ukrainian government ministries and NGOs to secure critical public and private systems. Google, for example, expanded its free distribution of Project Shield, a DDoS protection solution, to additional organizations within close proximity to the war, which included over 150 Ukrainian institutions as of November 2023. Cloudflare’s Project Galileo, which offers free DDoS protection to NGOs, saw a 177 percent increase in applications for services from Ukrainian organizations in March 2022. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft helped private and public entities migrate their data securely to remote cloud servers located outside Ukraine, which has prevented the destruction of data stored on physical hardware. As of June 2022, AWS reported having migrated 10 petabytes (10 million gigabytes) of data from government ministries, schools, and industry to the cloud, with more being migrated each day. However, storing and securing that data is expensive, and the government of Ukraine will eventually need to come up with a long-term plan to finance it. When it transitions into the reconstruction process, Ukraine could consider ways to best leverage partnerships with private technology companies to monitor and respond to evolving trends in the cyber threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REBUILDING AND PROTECTING PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also targeted the physical infrastructure that supports Ukraine’s digitalization. According to the Ukrainian government, as of October 2022 the Russian military had destroyed at least 4,000 telecommunications base stations, 60,000 kilometers of fiber-optic lines, and 18 TV/radio signal antennas. One year later, Ukrainian minister of digital transformation Mykhailo Fedorov stated that 25 percent of internet networks in the country had been destroyed. Local technicians have since repaired some of this equipment (often at great personal risk to their safety), and the effort has been a top priority for the government, especially in recaptured territories. By October 2022, Ukrainian telecommunications workers had repaired 1,232 destroyed cell towers, including 71 in liberated areas, and provided temporary Wi-Fi hotspots for residents to use in the interim. However, as of December 2022, the full cost of repairing Ukraine’s telecommunications sector was estimated to be $1.79 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Ukrainians in Russian-occupied territory, access to internet and information has been severely limited and will require substantial work to restore when Ukraine retakes those areas. Ukrainians in those zones have often been cut off from at-home internet access, forcing them to use public Wi-Fi provided by an internet service provider (ISP) that uses Russian-controlled infrastructure, which in turn allows the Russian government to block access to certain content. Ukrainian mobile carriers, internet providers, and television stations are also frequently inaccessible, creating what amounts to an “information blockade” that prevents those in occupied areas from communicating with the outside world, encountering news from sources other than Russian-approved propaganda, or receiving timely alerts of attacks. This formula echoes Russia’s practices in Crimea, where residents are subjected to censorship and surveillance, as well as those exercised inside Russia. In an effort to prevent occupying forces from rerouting ISPs to Russian internet providers located in Crimea, Ukrainian ISPs like Ukrtelecom sabotaged their own equipment as Russian troops advanced, resulting in mass blackouts that further diminished internet access rates in that area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several challenges involved in restoring internet access to previously occupied areas, including the need to secure funding, replace destroyed infrastructure, work around mines, and mitigate continued risks of attack. Still, these activities are among Ukraine’s top priorities, with assistance from the international community. In April 2022, USAID partnered with SpaceX to deliver 5,000 Starlink terminals to the government of Ukraine, which provide satellite-based internet access in areas with destroyed fiber optic infrastructure. In October 2023, Ukraine signed a memorandum of cooperation with Latvia to restore broadband infrastructure that Russia damaged during its invasion, which included commitments to reconnect physical infrastructure, support Ukraine’s access to EU telecommunications funds, and provide guidance on adapting to the European Union’s radio spectrum policies, among other actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ensuring-access-to-digital-services-for-all-ukrainians&quot;&gt;Ensuring Access to Digital Services for All Ukrainians&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s digitalization effort has taken place in the context of a dramatic rise in internet usage across the population, but gaps in accessibility remain. Before the start of the war in 2022, the World Bank reported that 79 percent of Ukrainians were using the internet — a large number, though lower than some of its neighbors (85 percent in Poland and 88 percent in Russia). Like in many countries, Ukraine’s internet users have largely leapfrogged older technology. The International Telecommunication Union reports that in 2021 and 2020, 91 percent of individuals owned a mobile phone, while only 66 percent of households had a computer. Similarly, Ukraine had approximately 80 mobile broadband subscriptions but only 18 fixed broadband subscriptions for every 100 individuals in 2021. High mobile adoption rates facilitate the use of e-government services via apps, such as Diia, while lower rates of computer usage make more intensive online activities, like remote work or online school, more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine boasts an extensive 4G network (92 percent of Ukraine’s population had 4G coverage as of 2021) and has revived plans for 5G development starting in 2024. However, internet accessibility is not consistent across Ukraine. Approximately 65 percent of rural Ukrainian villages are not covered by broadband, while nearly half of elderly Ukrainians say they do not use the internet. In addition, the war has decreased the quality of data transmission by 13 percent for fixed broadband and 26 percent for mobile networks. Disruptions to data transmission can result in slower load times or internet lags or pauses, which make it harder for people to access websites or services that require high bandwidth. As a result, internet users in Ukraine actually decreased by 16.8 percent between 2022 and 2023, and an estimated 7.5 million Ukrainians still did not have reliable internet access at the start of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s attacks against Ukraine’s digital infrastructure disproportionately harm refugees, individuals with disabilities, children, and the elderly, some of whom may require additional support and accommodations to access the internet and online resources. There were 2.7 million persons with disabilities officially registered in Ukraine before the war, a number which has likely increased since then. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has found that many persons with disabilities “face a digital divide that is present due to a lack of accessibility considerations within the digital ecosystem” and that as a result, refugees with disabilities may have trouble accessing information about and communicating their needs, even when services are available. Though research into this field has been limited, UNHCR notes that digitalization efforts should focus on making technology affordable as well as accessible, and that there should be greater investment in programs that train persons with disabilities in digital skills that they need to fully participate. In July 2023, Ukraine took a positive step in this direction, adopting a resolution requiring all state bodies to make their content more accessible to people with visual, hearing, and motor impairments in alignment with the international standards set forth in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1). In the private sector, Ukrainian developers are also increasingly adopting WCAG standards following their translation into Ukrainian in February 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESTORING AND IMPROVING INTERNET AND DIGITAL DEVICE ACCESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, Ukraine faces the twofold challenge of reconstructing the infrastructure that has been destroyed during the war while also building out new 5G networks. Major internet providers like Kyivstar, Vodafone, and Lifecell offered 4G coverage for roughly 90 percent of Ukraine in 2022. While the government announced a plan back in 2019 to deploy 5G networks, it was delayed in 2020 and then halted due to Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. However, Ukraine has announced more recent plans to roll out a pilot test of 5G in 2024 to continue pursuing the most advanced infrastructure for the country’s increasingly digital needs. The Ukraine-Latvia pact in October 2023 also committed to promoting 5G deployment in Ukraine, building upon Ukraine’s continued pursuit of broader broadband reconstruction in rural and urban areas to ensure more uniform connectivity as online services continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Going forward, Ukraine faces the twofold challenge of reconstructing the infrastructure that has been destroyed during the war while also building out new 5G networks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-speed broadband access is crucial for Ukrainians to take advantage of digital opportunities, including remote work, online education, and online government resources. Ukraine’s broadband is slower than most in the European Union and United States, meaning that users may struggle to run multiple devices at once, livestream content, or undertake other high-bandwidth activities. Fixed internet connection speed in Ukraine increased between 2022 and 2023, but mobile internet connection speeds decreased during that same period. UNHCR reports that broadband access rates are lower among the rural Roma community in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with restoring and improving internet access, Ukraine needs to invest in partnerships that expand digital device access for Ukrainians. The relatively high uptake of mobile devices (approximately 91 percent) among the Ukrainian population facilitates the adoption of smartphone apps like Diia, but the lower rate of computer ownership (approximately 66 percent) could reduce the ability of Ukrainians to engage in remote work or educational activities. International government agencies and technology companies have already supported the accessibility of both laptops and smartphones in Ukraine. These initiatives include the European Union’s Laptops for Ukraine program that donated over 25,000 laptops, phones, and other digital devices to Ukraine’s schools, hospitals, and municipalities. UNICEF has also given 5,000 laptops and tablets to Ukrainian teachers and 10,000 to students. In addition, HP and Microsoft partnered with local nonprofits, USAID, and the Ukrainian embassy to the United States to deliver tens of thousands of laptops, tablets, and software to classrooms across 12 regions of Ukraine. European operators have also established Wi-Fi hotspots near refugee camps and public transport locations where refugees arrive and have distributed over 2.5 million free SIM cards. USAID has provided almost $1.2 million in FDI to support Ukraine’s tech sector since the Russian invasion, which has improved the sector’s resilience and helped the country to continue its digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROMOTING DIGITAL LITERACY AND LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the uneven digital skills attainment among the Ukrainian population by age, income, geographic location, and gender, as described in this report introduction, Ukraine will need to continue investing in digital literacy resources. In November 2023, the Ministry of Digital Transformation completed the Development of Digital Education Hubs Libraries’ Capabilities project, in partnership with the Ukrainian Library Association and the UN Development Programme, which trained librarians to teach digital literacy workshops to local residents. The ministry also developed a Diia.Digital Education Platform — online education courses that cover basic digital rights and skills for older people and professionals (such as teachers, civil servants, and medical workers). This platform could help Ukraine close the digital literacy gaps that the Ministry of Digital Transformation noted in its 2023 survey. The ministry is also developing a new app, Mriya (or “Dream” in Ukrainian) to expand access to online education for students across the country, with the goal of including all Ukrainian education institutions on the platform by the end of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to continuing its existing digital literacy initiatives, the ministry should also ensure that Diia and all other government online platforms are available in the languages necessary to ensure access to services for all Ukrainians. An estimated 29 percent of Ukrainians, or 14.3 million people, spoke Russian as a first language according to a 2001 census. That number dropped to 15 percent in 2022 as more people began primarily speaking Ukrainian as an act of resistance after the war started, though it’s unclear if the survey included Russian-occupied areas. In 2019, the government adopted a law making Ukrainian the sole national language and requiring that all public and private enterprises provide all services in Ukrainian. As a result, while Ukrainian versions of digital apps and government services are always available, translations to other languages are not necessarily provided or required. In addition, as Ukraine seeks to attract foreign investment, it could be beneficial to develop English-language services for Ukraine’s growing expatriate community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulating-digitalization-and-surveillance-with-transparency-and-accountability&quot;&gt;Regulating Digitalization and Surveillance with Transparency and Accountability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many governments collect and store personal information to promote national security or offer essential services, they require strong mechanisms to prevent secondary uses or other privacy violations that citizens might not anticipate. Ukraine is not exempt from this dynamic, especially due to its history of previous government administrations targeting surveillance toward journalists, political opponents, and civil society critics. The current Ukrainian government’s attempt to purchase Pegasus spyware — technology designed to hack into phones and encrypted communications apps without requiring any user action — has understandably raised red flags among Ukrainian civil society, even though Israel’s export control agency reportedly blocked the sale. This concern is exacerbated by the fact that many of these surveillance developments have taken place in wartime, with little opportunity for public debate. Diia features such as eVorog (eEnemy), designed to allow citizens to report alleged Russian military activities, have generated valuable intelligence in occupied areas but also resemble tactics used by Soviet forces during the Cold War. By December 2022, Ukrainians had provided more than 450,000 reports of suspicious activity around the country. These new social norms, where citizens feel it is permissible and even expected to report on the activities of their neighbors, are a trend that should be subject to public debate, particularly in a post-conflict peacetime environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s own domestic laws have not kept pace with its rapid digitalization, leaving legal gaps in permissible uses of surveillance tools and accountability for potential misuse. Over the past three years, Ukraine has enacted new laws that have enlarged the government’s authority to conduct surveillance without a court order. In 2020, Ukraine passed the Law on Electronic Communications, which requires online communications services to retain users’ location data and grant government access during legal investigations. The same year, it adopted the Law on Intelligence, which expands government authority to intercept communications before a court order is issued. The Anti-Corruption Research &amp;amp; Education Centre, which is affiliated with the National University of Kyiv, contends that the Law on Intelligence lacked public input during its initial enactment and transparency during its subsequent use. Under martial law, Ukraine amended its Code of Criminal Procedure in April 2022 to allow law enforcement to access telecommunications systems, including surveillance cameras, without a court order. These new laws have sparked civil society concerns that government surveillance without sufficient checks and balances, combined with a general lack of transparency, could lead to misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;New social norms, where citizens feel it is permissible and even expected to report on the activities of their neighbors, are a trend that should be subject to public debate, particularly in a post-conflict peacetime environment.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide more transparency on data usage, the Ministry of Digital Transformation has developed a feature in the Diia app that informs the user when their data is accessed. Building in features that reduce bad actors’ ability to misuse data and publicizing those safeguards is vital to getting Ukrainians to download — and continue using — apps like Diia. However, to avoid the misuse of personal data, Ukraine will need to adopt and enforce comprehensive data protection policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REGULATING THE DEPLOYMENT OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facial recognition technology, which is software used to determine the similarity between two face images, is widely used by many governments and private companies for a range of purposes including law enforcement, fraud prevention, distribution of services, and border management. It is most often used to either identify a person (comparing an image against a database) or to verify a known person’s identity (matching someone 1:1 against an existing record). Facial characterization is a separate but related process used to classify an image according to certain characteristics such as race, gender, or age. Almost 80 percent of countries use facial recognition of some kind; however, the reach of the technology and the legal framework applicable to it differ significantly from country to country. Its use comes with significant human rights risks. These include privacy risks — where personal data can be collected, processed, and shared beyond what is necessary, proportional, or consented to by the user — as well as risks associated with biases and errors built into facial recognition algorithms. The use of facial recognition in public spaces can also have a chilling effect on freedom of movement, assembly, and association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is no stranger to the use of facial recognition. The Diia app uses facial recognition for its “Diia.Digital Signature” function and the “Safe Cities” program uses it for video surveillance in public areas, according to local municipalities. Ukraine began using facial recognition sourced from Clearview AI early in the war — primarily to identify deceased Russian soldiers, as part of an effort to counter false Russian narratives about the cost of the war. Since then, its use has dramatically expanded. Ukrainian government officials and Clearview AI report that as of November 2023, more than 1,500 officials across 18 government agencies have run more than 350,000 searches on the system since the war started. The government of Ukraine has used facial recognition for everything from reuniting abducted children with their families and linking captured Russian soldiers with alleged war crimes to assisting Ukrainians who have lost their IDs and scanning visitors at the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Ukraine’s deployment of facial recognition systems, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a national strategy in 2020 that aims “to embed AI technologies in every aspect of the country’s development.” However, Ukraine generally has not updated its legal framework to address recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and facial recognition, leaving government agencies without specific, modern boundaries on their use. Article 40 of the Law of Ukraine on National Police allows law enforcement officers to use “automatic” or “analytical” systems to process photos and videos, but it does not contain clear limitations on such use. Ukraine’s Draft Law No. 8153 on Personal Data Protection, if enacted, would require data controllers to obtain individuals’ consent to process their biometric information, but it would also explicitly allow law enforcement agencies to install surveillance cameras in public. The draft bill includes a general opt-out for automated processing, but it does not distinguish between various levels of risk of AI use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MANAGING THE DEPLOYMENT OF VIDEO SURVEILLANCE TOOLS IN PUBLIC SPACES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine adopted a country-wide video surveillance system in 2016 as part of a “Safe City” program. Between 2016 and 2019, more than 6,300 cameras were installed in Kyiv, including 4,000 with facial recognition functions (400 cameras capable of detecting body temperature were also deployed during the pandemic). As a result, Kyiv has become one of the top 50 most surveilled cities in the world. More than 12,700 cameras were deployed across Ukraine during this period. Initially, management of these systems fell under the jurisdiction of local municipalities. Since the full-scale invasion began, however, civil-military administrations (temporary local government units established by the president) assumed authority over them. In a postwar environment, Ukrainians will need to develop a more transparent and accountable system for regulating the deployment and use of this technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, most of the cameras installed in Ukraine are Chinese-produced Hikvision and Dahua devices. ProZorro, the Ukrainian open-source procurement platform, references over 3,000 Hikvision and Dahua-related transactions between 2016 and 2023. In 2020, for example, Kyiv purchased around $21 million worth of Hikvision cameras for its “Smart City” project. Hikvision cameras are installed in the biggest cities in Ukraine and now are under the jurisdiction of military units, security services, municipal administrations, and border guards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZTE (a partially state-owned Chinese telecommunications company) has been working with Ukretelecom and other major Ukrainian telecom operators and enterprises since 2003. Huawei was vital to the rollout of Ukraine’s 2G and 3G broadband networks, which increased Ukraine’s broadband penetration rate from 8 percent to 65 percent between 2016 and 2019. In 2019, Kyivstar, Vodafone, and LifeCell awarded Huawei a contract to build a 4G network on the Kyiv subway system. The State Service for Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine signed a memorandum with Huawei to cooperate on issues of cybersecurity and telecommunication, and Huawei has partnered with Diia to open “Diia.Business,” centers that support small and medium-sized businesses, in Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih, Odesa, and Poltava.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has used Chinese technology because it is less expensive to procure than non-Chinese alternatives. However, this partnership comes with inherent risks, as Chinese companies may be required to share data collected by these products with the Chinese government under state security laws. Given the close relationship between Moscow and Beijing, even in a postwar environment Ukraine should be wary of the risk of information sharing between the two. The U.S. Department of Commerce and Federal Communications Commission have restricted Dahua, Hikvision, ZTE, and Huawei from conducting transactions or exporting products to the United States due to national security concerns. The European Parliament has also banned the use of Hikvision cameras within its premises in April 2021, though some individual member states continue to use them. Ten European Union countries have already restricted Huawei from their 5G networks — a decision the European Commission described as “justified and compliant” with the EU Toolbox on 5G Cybersecurity in 2023. As of June 2023, the European Union has reportedly considered mandating a broader ban on high-risk 5G equipment providers, which could include Huawei or ZTE, across member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ensuring-consistency-with-emerging-eu-standards-on-digital-human-rights&quot;&gt;Ensuring Consistency with Emerging EU Standards on Digital Human Rights&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine continues its ongoing bid for EU membership, it will need to align its legal standards at the intersection of technology and human rights with the rest of the bloc. The European Union has already taken sweeping actions to regulate how digital platforms handle sensitive data and create legal rights for individuals to access and exercise control over their personal information. In 2016, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became one of the world’s most comprehensive data protection laws to date. In December 2023, the European Parliament and European Council reached a provisional agreement on the draft Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), which, after receiving unanimous approval from the Permanent Representatives Committee in February 2024, is expected to pass a final vote in the coming months. Since Ukraine’s economy is already highly digitalized, alignment with EU law may require major and difficult changes to its current regulatory structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, EU policy alignment could present practical benefits for Ukraine. In addition to easing its integration into the European Union, the alignment of Ukraine’s digital governance structures could encourage long-term economic and democratic growth in several ways. First, the European Union has taken steps to encourage the free flow of data between its member states, based on shared bloc-wide standards for privacy and security. By aligning privacy frameworks, Ukraine could support the economic benefits of this data-sharing infrastructure, which could lead to multi-sector innovation that the European Commission estimates could generate €270 billion in GDP growth across member states by 2028. Second, harmonization with EU laws could provide a guide for Ukrainian public and private sector entities to address fundamental principles like transparency and fairness in their deployment of novel technologies during the reconstruction phase. Ukraine and EU law could particularly benefit from alignment on the topics of data privacy, facial recognition, and AI — which, in turn, could create long-term consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EU policy alignment could present practical benefits for Ukraine. In addition to easing its integration into the European Union, the alignment of Ukraine’s digital governance structures could encourage long-term economic and democratic growth.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s history of regulatory alignment with the European Union on cybersecurity dates back years, from the start of the country’s digital transformation. Ukraine finalized its Strategy on Cybersecurity in 2016 and its Law on the Basic Principles of Cybersecurity in 2017, both of which contained language of “openness, accessibility, stability and security of cyberspace,” similar to the European Union’s Cybersecurity Strategy. In May 2020, USAID supported the Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure program which, among other goals, aimed to update regulations in Ukraine to promote IT growth and cybersecurity. Shortly thereafter, the European Union and Ukraine agreed to establish an ongoing Cybersecurity Dialogue, which subsequently lent economic and political support to protect Ukraine’s critical infrastructure following Russia’s full-scale invasion. These bilateral Cybersecurity Dialogues coincide with Ukraine’s efforts to further align with EU and international cybersecurity frameworks, including to incorporate Budapest Convention provisions into its federal cybercrime law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s foreign assistance program has also supported Ukraine’s digital integration with Europe. Its Digital Transformation for Ukraine (DT4UA) project has helped add more functions to Diia in response to emerging needs, and it has also supported Ukraine to develop electronic ID infrastructure that is compliant with EU eIDAS regulations. These regulations are a legal framework for the EU interoperability system that facilitates safe electronic interactions for businesses, citizens, and public authorities. Ukrainian electronic signatures and seals on digital documents can be verified in EU member states due to these developments, allowing EU countries to accept electronic signatures and applications signed using the Diia app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROMOTING DATA PRIVACY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this strong foundation for collaboration, there are still substantive gaps between Ukrainian and EU legal frameworks that require reconciliation, particularly with respect to data privacy. While Ukraine’s 2010 Law on Personal Data Protection (PDP) sets basic guardrails on both private and public sector use of personal information, it contains generalized or outdated terms that predate modern data collection and processing. Data protection experts like Member of Parliament Yegor Chernev and Access Now’s Natalia Krapiva have emphasized the need to modernize the PDP to align with both technological advancements and the GDPR. Members of the Ukrainian Parliament submitted Draft Law No. 8153 on Personal Data Protection (PPD) in October 2022, but the bill has not yet been enacted into law. Draft Law No. 8153 mirrors language within the GDPR, including the individual rights to access or delete personal information, requirements for entities to minimize their collection and retention of data, and enhanced protections for sensitive information like biometrics. In other words, this draft bill could grant individuals legal tools to understand and exercise control over the processing of their personal information, while preventing public or private organizations from using or transferring personal data for unnecessary or abusive purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2022, several Ukrainian government ministries partnered with the Council of Europe to launch an ongoing, two-year “Project on Supporting Implementation of Human Rights Standards in Ukraine” to align data protection laws between the European Union and Ukraine. This project has underscored the need for more specific guardrails within Draft Law No. 8153 on government access to private communications and location data. In addition to the 2010 PDP, Access Now has also advocated in favor of revising the Law on Operative Investigative Activity, which grants law enforcement and intelligence agencies broad authority to wiretap without clear restrictions on purpose or duration. In general, there is little public information on the extent of wiretapping, although rumors of such tactics have appeared in past Ukrainian elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine’s trend toward more expansive surveillance continues into the postwar period, the country’s practices may run counter to the Council of Europe’s amended Convention 108+ treaty and the European Union’s Law Enforcement Directive, both of which specify that government agencies should limit data processing to what “constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society.” Because the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights affirms individuals’ rights to data protection, privacy is afforded high value under EU law. At the same time, it is possible that the definition of “necessary” and “proportionate” surveillance may be higher in Ukraine due to its unique security situation, which may persist even after the war ends. On the other hand, it is also possible that Ukraine’s long-term trade-offs between government surveillance and civil liberties may shift in a peacetime environment, especially as global privacy norms increasingly become a prerequisite for digital trade and commerce. While Article 4(2) of the Treaty Establishing the European Union generally leaves national security matters to individual member states, EU law generally applies in the case of any potential conflicts with national law. Either way, legal and cultural inconsistencies in privacy could create uncertainty for businesses and governments, and both Ukraine and the European Union could benefit from shared standards for government access in non-security contexts in their long-term future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALIGNING FACIAL RECOGNITION AND AI POLICIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is moving ahead with more prescriptive human rights protections for AI and facial recognition, potentially widening the gap between the current stage of Ukraine’s laws and its technological deployment. The February 2024 version of the European Union’s AI Act would prohibit law enforcement government agencies from using real-time biometric products like Clearview, Hikvision, and Dahua in public areas, except if “strictly necessary” to advance select purposes like counterterrorism or human trafficking. Although it proposes allowing law enforcement authorities to continue to use “post-remote” biometric surveillance in a broader range of contexts, it would subject them to enhanced requirements for “high-risk” algorithms, such as undergoing risk assessments, documenting training datasets for accuracy, maintaining human oversight, and ensuring transparency. The AI Act further considers any AI system related to law enforcement, public benefits, or immigration — even if it does not process biometric data — to be subject to these same guardrails for “high-risk” use. At least four EU member states have already taken actions to either ban or fine Clearview AI under the GDPR, which assigns special protections to biometric information. The GDPR also guarantees individuals a legal right to opt out of AI-based decisionmaking that would significantly affect them — data rights that do not yet exist in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the European Union is one of the first governments to finalize a major AI law, AI governance frameworks are still emerging around the world and democratic governments have not reached a clear consensus on their ethical norms. When the Council of Europe adopted facial recognition guidelines in January 2021, it recognized the need for further work: “The use of live facial recognition technologies in uncontrolled environments, in light of the intrusiveness it bares upon the right to privacy . . . should be subject to a democratic debate on its use and the possibility of a moratorium pending complete analysis.” Furthermore, when the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released landmark voluntary principles on government surveillance in December 2022, it also acknowledged the need for future multilateral dialogues between its 46 member countries to address government access to commercial or publicly available data like Clearview AI. In October 2023, President Biden signed an executive order that recognized the importance of engagement with international partners on voluntary standards to promote the benefits of AI while mitigating its challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has already begun to participate in global dialogues on how to define and classify risk in algorithms, where to place clear restrictions on the use of AI, and how to hold human actors responsible for biased outcomes within algorithms. In November 2023, Ukraine attended the United Kingdom’s AI Safety Summit alongside 27 other countries and the European Union. These governments signed the Bletchley Declaration, which pledged to build transparent approaches to address AI risks, support multilateral collaboration on AI safety research, and maintain open international dialogue on the opportunities and consequences of AI. The Bletchley Declaration included a commitment to collaborate “as appropriate while recognising our approaches may differ based on national circumstances and applicable legal frameworks.” These governments will reportedly meet again in 2024, demonstrating the importance of multilateral dialogue — and where appropriate, alignment — on the uses of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By shoring up cybersecurity, investing in digital literacy, and rebuilding damaged telecommunications infrastructure, Ukraine has established itself as a leader in the digitalization of its government and society. This technological transformation has already come with numerous benefits, including more convenient access to services, new remote employment and educational opportunities, and security features in the wake of Russia’s military invasion. However, Ukraine will also need to maintain a strong framework to promote the equitable distribution of these benefits while also mitigating novel risks to data privacy, cybersecurity, and civil liberties in the long term. Below are 10 priority areas for Ukraine to continue building upon its robust technological foundation in a manner consistent with long-standing human rights values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a plan to repair damaged 4G infrastructure and build out new 5G networks that prioritizes responsible procurement and technological advancement.&lt;/strong&gt; The reconstruction and maintenance of high-speed internet across both rural and urban areas is a prerequisite for Ukraine’s plans to deploy AI, digitalize government services, and expand its IT sector. However, it must also weigh the risks to national security and human rights that Chinese providers like ZTE and Huawei might pose — especially accounting for ongoing concerns raised by U.S. and EU officials. In the end, Ukraine requires a long-term plan to finance the installation and maintenance of cutting-edge and secure telecommunications equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support partnerships with international technology companies to further expand digital accessibility and grow Ukraine’s information technology sector.&lt;/strong&gt; Building upon support from the international community, Ukraine could consider formalizing public-private partnerships with international technology companies that have provided devices and migrated essential data to cloud servers during wartime. In addition to encouraging public-private partnerships, Ukraine could continue to promote policies that attract foreign direct investment in the country, including creating a friendly environment for remote IT workers, providing language resources for a global workforce, and supporting digital education and reskilling across the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support digital literacy and specialized resources for vulnerable populations.&lt;/strong&gt; Building on current initiatives, the Ministry of Digital Transformation could consider broadening the reach of “Diia.Digital Education” and Mriya to center to enhance access to digital literacy trainings for targeted populations, particularly for individuals over the age of 60 or those with disabilities. The ministry could also partner with local groups in areas with low digital penetration to ensure that resources are reaching those who need them most. To support its citizens as they navigate an increasingly digitalized resource system, Ukraine could provide additional resources and training to digital community managers such as the employees of local libraries that have been helping residents withdraw pensions, apply for government assistance, and register businesses through Diia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue following Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) as essential resources become increasingly available online.&lt;/strong&gt; Both the public and private sectors of Ukraine should continue to follow the WCAG to ensure that any new digital resources they develop are accessible to as many people as possible, including persons with disabilities. In the European Union, the European Accessibility Act sets accessibility rules for many digital products and services from e-commerce websites to smartphones. Ensuring compliance with the EAA could further harmonize Ukrainian and EU standards and enable cross-border commerce of digital goods, increasing market access for Ukrainian individuals and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solicit and incorporate feedback from civil society, academia, and general stakeholders on the appropriate boundaries of surveillance technologies in a postwar environment.&lt;/strong&gt; After the war ends, Ukrainian citizens may have distinct levels of comfort around surveillance technologies that can pose human rights risks — but could also enhance personal safety or national security. As a result, the government should actively encourage input and feedback from citizens around the long-term deployment of these tools, including facial recognition, public cameras, and location trackers. It could open formal channels (which could include town halls, public opinion surveys, hearings, and more) for interested stakeholders to submit verbal or written comments on the contexts and conditions under which data collection might be permissible, as well as the possible impacts of surveillance on local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote user transparency and control over the collection and processing of individuals’ personal information by both public and private sector entities.&lt;/strong&gt; Holistic transparency measures — which could include independent audits and public reporting requirements — could increase internal accountability over the collection and use of sensitive personal information. These could support the public’s trust that private companies and government agencies will only process personal information in a manner consistent with the original purpose of collection, without transferring or storing data for secondary or unnecessary purposes. In addition, mandatory notification of sensitive data breaches to affected individuals could reinforce public trust in the cybersecurity of essential public and private sector systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernize national data protection laws in line with the GDPR.&lt;/strong&gt; Building upon current efforts such as the Council of Europe’s “Project on Supporting Implementation of Human Rights Standards in Ukraine,” Ukraine should consider implementing new safeguards to minimize data collection by public and private entities, especially regarding sensitive data like private communications, geolocation history, and biometrics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish an independent regulatory body to oversee data processing in both the public and private sectors.&lt;/strong&gt; While the Verkhovna Rada’s (Ukrainian Parliament’s) commissioner for human rights monitors compliance with the 2010 Law on Personal Data Protection, the commissioner operates as a parliamentary ombudsperson. An independent agency could provide more impartial oversight of public and private sector data processing activities. An independent regulator could also build specialized expertise to swiftly adapt rules to evolving technologies and offer guidance to organizations that wish to facilitate compliance with any new legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase staffing and financial resources for privacy regulators.&lt;/strong&gt; Historically, the ombudsperson’s data protection department has suffered from persistent under-resourcing. In 2019, it operated with only 13 employees and a budget capped at €150,000, despite overseeing a growing digitalized economy serving 40 million people. Companies that violate Ukraine’s 2010 PDP law are subject to initial administrative fines of approximately €425, which are significantly lower than GDPR penalties. To increase funding for enforcement, Ukraine could increase monetary fines for noncompliance, as well as assess the feasibility of allocating additional government appropriations and levying data protection taxes on technology platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage in global discussions on government surveillance, AI, facial recognition, and human rights.&lt;/strong&gt; Existing multilateral dialogues, including those led by the Council of Europe, OECD, United Kingdom, and United States, provide forums for Ukraine to shape the development of AI standards. Given Ukraine’s unique national security concerns during the postwar reconstruction period, it can contribute valuable insights on the need to balance privacy and civil liberties protections during the deployment of AI and biometric surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent high-profile cases from national and local security forces, as well as critical reviews of internal cultures, indicate that the UK’s security forces are under threat from far-right extremism. This paper addresses this challenge in the UK context, focusing on the police and military services, and offers practical guidance and recommendations. The analysis highlights the following four critical areas for reform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Vetting processes are essential. However, it seems that there remain significant gaps and challenges in effectively identifying potential extremists. This poses a considerable risk, particularly as far-right organisations strategically infiltrate security forces, exploiting organisational similarities and cultural overlaps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training emerges as a critical area for prevention. The need for continuous, well-structured training programmes is emphasised, with a focus on addressing hypermasculinity and racism. Fostering a culture that counters stigma around mental health is also identified as a crucial factor in reducing radicalisation risk, aligning with the broader goal of building resilient and adaptive security forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accountability mechanisms within security forces are equally important, especially in the face of an evolving extremist threat. Transparency, consistency and leadership support in enforcing consequences for misconduct and extremist ideologies are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Separation from the police or military is identified as a critical phase of vulnerability to radicalisation. Comprehensive support programmes, including mental health assistance, exit interviews and tailored interventions, are highlighted as crucial for successful reintegration into civilian life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing these challenges is vital to building the resilience of the UK’s security forces against extremist influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the events of 6 January 2021 in the US, where former and active security service members participated in the attack on the country’s Capitol, and high-profile cases of service members engaging in far-right extremism in Germany, there has been a growing focus on the threat posed by serving and former security force members in these and other countries. This is especially the case in light of the shifting focus over the past few years to far-right extremism and terrorism as a predominant threat in these regions. Research into the phenomenon and prevention efforts addressing the issue of far-right extremism in national security services are underway in the US, Canada, Germany and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the UK, instances of suspected far-right extremism among active and former members of the police and armed forces have led to referrals to the government’s Prevent scheme and investigations into far-right extremism-related concerns, as well as prison sentences both for membership of proscribed far-right organisations and attempts to recruit other members of the security forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cases underline the gravity of the issue, as even a small number of individuals within the security forces engaging in extremist activities poses a significant reputational risk to those forces. Links between service members and extremism present a profound threat to the foundations of democratic societies. When those sworn to protect and defend society are associated with extremism or terrorism, the societal trust they break with their actions has a deep impact, undermining institutions and the missions they are meant to uphold. Public trust is imperative for the effective functioning of the security services and their ability to carry out their mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the threat to public confidence, there is also the internal impact of diminshed trust within security services. Environments where racism, sexism and extremism are prevalent can hinder operational efficiency. If force personnel feel marginalised, harassed or attacked they will not be able to complete their duties to the best of their abilities. In addition, if marginalised or “out-group” communities (those people who do not belong to a specific “in-group”) do not feel the security services are a welcoming environment, future recruitment and retention will be increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper aims to address this issue in the UK context, focusing on the police and the armed forces, to provide practical guidance to mitigate potential threats. It forms part of a broader RUSI project exploring structural, training and cultural dynamics within national security forces that can enhance or reduce resilience against the entrance and spread of far-right extremism. The paper is not intended to be comprehensive, but rather presents initial findings and actionable policy recommendations from this wider project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper first outlines the current situation in the UK, examining recent cases of and institutional responses to far-right extremism in the security forces. Subsequently, the paper discusses four areas of concern – vetting procedures, training and education, internal governance and separation processes – where adaptations of existing measures could enhance resilience to violent extremist influences. For each area, the paper explores current measures, discusses their limitations, and provides recommendations for building resilience, emphasising that the goal is not to stigmatise security service members but to safeguard their wellbeing and build resilience to violent extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology-and-limitations&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY AND LIMITATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper took a qualitative approach, reviewing existing literature on extremism, with a focus on far-right extremism within the security services. This included a targeted review of current cases of violent extremism and terrorism investigations in the UK, encompassing both current and former service members. The paper builds on open source materials, grey and academic literature, and media reports. Additionally, insights are drawn from recent reviews into institutional cultures, such as the Baroness Casey Review of the Metropolitan Police Service (the Casey Review).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that there are significant limitations on access to primary data in this area of research. It is extremely difficult to interview serving members of the UK’s military and police on this subject, as they are bound by their service contracts. Consequently, information about cases of far-right extremism and preventive approaches within the security services is scarce. The lack of clear and published policies and documentation of procedures from these services compounds the challenge. The consequent reliance on media reporting introduces a potentially skewed picture, as cases reported may not have led to charges or legal action, due to insufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these limitations, it is important to highlight that this paper does not claim to offer a comprehensive assessment of existing policies or cases. Rather, its purpose is to initiate a discussion within the UK context on the highlighted concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-and-context&quot;&gt;BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section identifies some of the key concerns for the UK’s military and police in relation to preventing far-right extremism from spreading through the ranks. External threats include infiltration by extremists, while internal threats include cultural dynamics which allow sentiments of misogyny and racism to fester and increase members’ vulnerability to far-right extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referrals to the UK government’s Prevent programme in relation to suspected far-right extremism have been made from across the armed forces, including the RAF air cadets and army cadets. Although up-to-date figures are not available, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has revealed that between 2019 and October 2022, 40 personnel from the Army, Navy and Air Force were investigated for extremism-related concerns. Defence Intelligence has also stated that of the 14 MoD Prevent referrals in 2019, 13 were related to far-right concerns. For January to November 2020, there were a further seven referrals, with the majority (six) linked to far-right activities. This follows the arrest of four serving members of the Army in 2017 for suspected membership of National Action, a proscribed far-right organisation. Lance Corporal Mikko Vehvilainen was subsequently sentenced to eight years in prison for membership of a proscribed organisation and attempts to recruit other soldiers. There have been similar concerns in relation to the police, after Benjamin Hannam became the first serving officer to be convicted of a terrorism offence – also related to membership of National Action – in 2021. The subsequent convictions of serving members of police and prison staff for terrorism offences linked to their far-right beliefs suggests that this threat extends beyond frontline officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee has warned about the “insider threat” of far-right extremists actively seeking to infiltrate and recruit within the military and the police. The government has acknowledged that the security forces present an attractive target for groups to gain training and access to weaponry and equipment, and as a site for recruitment. Well-known far-right extremists such as Jack Renshaw – currently serving life in prison for a plot to kill MP Rosie Cooper in 2017 – have attempted to join the armed forces. National Action has also directly encouraged members to enlist in the military or police and to conceal their views during the recruitment process. The idea of enlisting in the Army was also a frequent point of discussion in a Telegram channel run by “the British Hand” terrorist cell, with some members appearing to have joined the army cadets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Army has stated that far-right ideology is “completely at odds” with its values and standards. However, high-profile incidents in recent years appear to be indicative of a longstanding sympathy for far-right culture within elements of the armed forces. Former military personnel have not only stated that offensive and discriminatory language was commonplace, but that troops could display far-right iconography and brag about their exploits within far-right groups without fear of reprisals. Army veteran and “commanding officer” of the far-right National Support Detachment Alek Yerbury claims that his views were not only widely shared in the military, but also largely shaped during his time there. Other former members of the armed forces have suggested that dehumanising training approaches, often including racist language and stereotypes, can sometimes be used in the services training and can potentially contribute to radicalisation into far-right extremism. Worryingly, some allege that senior officers were not only aware of these behaviours, but that they also attempted to cover them up. An urgent report commissioned by the Secretary of State for Defence in April 2019 also casts doubt on the MoD’s accountability procedures, which were described as “a sub-optimal system” for dealing with inappropriate behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the police, there are similar concerns about cultures potentially conducive to far-right extremism and a lack of measures to effectively address such behaviours. In March 2023, an independent review of standards of behaviour in the Metropolitan Police (the Met) found an internal culture characterised by systemic and deep-seated racism, misogyny, homophobia and other forms of discrimination. The investigation also highlighted that such behaviours are routinely tolerated, ignored or dismissed as “banter” within a culture of defensiveness and denial that encourages officers and staff to look the other way rather than speak up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not only serving members of the military and police who present an extremism risk. Veterans motivated by far-right ideologies have been convicted of terrorism offences, including the stockpiling of explosives and preparation of attacks. Additionally, former service personnel can be targeted specifically by the recruitment strategies of far-right groups. Veterans have useful skills and experience – some have become responsible for training and fitness programmes in far-right organisations. Characteristics associated with military and police service, such as discipline, honour and courage, are viewed as valuable by far-right organisations. Individuals leaving the forces can lack support, including assistance with mental health needs resulting from their service, and may be at risk of being enticed by the sense of belonging and familiar organisational structure that far-right groups claim to offer. Far-right groups have attempted to exploit this vulnerability, directly contacting former service personnel via social media and charities. A “respite” camp for veterans has been accused of being a “major organising centre of the far-right attended by former soldiers who have shared antisemitic propaganda and threatened armed violence”. Recent years have also seen far-right groups in the UK renew their efforts to co-opt veterans into their narratives as part of a wave of anti-migrant protests, in particular contrasting the treatment of former service personnel with the money and luxuries allegedly afforded to asylum seekers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples give a sense of the threat facing the military and police in the UK from far-right extremism. It is important to note that further specificity in defining and mapping the threat was outside the scope of this paper, but it appears likely from the evidence gathered that these concerns have both institutional and specific, or local, dynamics. Therefore, it is also likely that particular police stations or regions might have more or fewer concerns in this area, depending on their leadership’s approach to how training, policies and culture are monitored and enforced. Within the military, it may be that there are differing levels of concern across the services or, more specifically, across particular roles within the services. Evidence shows that the more operationally focused the role within the security services, the more concern there can be about the cultural dynamics and in-/out-group mentality fostered within such units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-vulnerabilities-and-strengthening-resilience&quot;&gt;UNDERSTANDING VULNERABILITIES AND STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are some clear distinctions between the mission and culture of the police and the military in the UK, four areas of concern emerge across both services: vetting of new recruits; the training environments used to ingrain the hierarchal unit structures of the security services; the creation and enforcement of governance procedures for active members; and the services offered to departing members and veteran communities. For each of these areas, there follows a review of current measures in the UK services, an assessment of the limitations of these approaches, and recommendations to help improve the policy and practice of the military and the police to prevent and counter the threat of far-right extremism within their ranks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vetting&quot;&gt;VETTING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vetting processes play a crucial role in preventing far-right extremism within the security forces, primarily for two reasons. First, as discussed in the previous section, far-right organisations actively strategise to infiltrate security forces, viewing them as attractive targets to gain training and access to weaponry. Second, research suggests there are organisational and cultural parallels between far-right groups and security services, which could encourage recruitment to far-right extremism among current and former security force members. Shared features such as organisational hierarchies and gendered role expectations create potential appeal for individuals with far-right leanings. The archetype of a patriotic hero is prevalent in both types of organisation, with a potentially narrow gap between nationalist patriotism and ultra-nationalist viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military has stated that there are “robust measures” in place during their recruitment processes to identify and exclude individuals with extremist sympathies. Similarly, the police claim that all applicants will be subject to “rigorous vetting”. The vetting procedures of both forces rely heavily on recruits self-declaring or disclosing information – including any political or extremist affiliations – via written or online forms. This presents a potential vulnerability, as candidates may choose to withhold or conceal their beliefs. To counter this, the military cross-checks disclosed information against security service records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All branches of the armed forces additionally mandate interviews or assessment centres that candidates must physically attend. By contrast, national police assessment standards lack this requirement, with major forces such as the Met and West Midlands Police opting for online interviews and assessment centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond interviews, most police forces now increasingly scrutinise applicants’ social media profiles. Yet challenges persist in uniformly integrating this into vetting procedures. Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee found some resistance within police forces to incorporating in-depth online screening into standard vetting procedures because of resource and privacy implications. A former head of Counter Terrorism Policing also stated that “people don’t like the idea that their whole internet history is going to be looked at as part of their application for a particular job”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the military and the police have specific tattoo policies in relation to applicants, offering a screening opportunity for extremist affiliations. Applicants with “offensive or intimidating” tattoos are barred from joining the police. Army regulations similarly state that soldiers may not have tattoos that can be viewed as offensive, which the regulations define as having “the purpose or effect of violating another person’s dignity or creating an adverse environment for others … A tattoo should … be considered to have such an effect if … it can be viewed as offensive by an objective standard”. However, the lack of specific guidance on political symbols, iconography, references or proscribed images contrasts with internal Army guidance to soldiers to look out for individuals with “tattoos with overt and covert XRW [extreme right-wing] iconography”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the important role vetting can play in barring individuals with extremist views, recent high-profile cases demonstrate the limitations of existing vetting procedures in both the military and the police. For police recruitment, concerns were raised by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee and His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp;amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS), citing insufficient background checks and the appointment of applicants without adequate verification of the information provided on application forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the absence of standardised vetting questions across recruitment in police forces in England and Wales contributes to the potential for abuse of the process. Some forces ask applicants to declare that they are “not a current, or previous, member of a proscribed terrorist organisation”, while others refer to “domestic extremism groups”, or make reference to specific organisations such as the British National Party, Britain First, Combat 18 and the National Front. The College of Policing has developed a recommended question that asks applicants, “Have you ever been involved in any actions that could be described as politically, religiously, racially, or environmentally disruptive?”. The open wording of this model question retains ambiguity that might be abused, or even misunderstood, by applicants. However, an extremist candidate’s responses and omissions could nevertheless be considered evidence of fraudulent misrepresentation during vetting, which, if proven, could constitute gross misconduct and would be grounds for automatic dismissal under new police procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, ambiguity in questions, while not necessarily succeeding in preventing entry to security services by extremist elements, can provide leverage for potential discharge in disciplinary cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media screening, while potentially contributing to a more comprehensive candidate profile, faces practical challenges such as attribution issues, pseudonym use and unauthorised impersonation, all of which limit its efficacy. Additionally, discriminatory or extremist social media posts are sometimes overlooked or dismissed during the vetting process. After reviewing the applications of 725 serving police officers, HMICFRS found that 68 should never have made it through the vetting process. This includes instances where social media posts that were “potentially discriminatory, inflammatory, or extremist” did not result in the candidate being rejected, with some forces failing to refer to potentially problematic social media content at all in their decision-making. Rather, forces looked to address the issue by advising candidates on their use of social media in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differing “risk appetites” among police forces, influenced by recruitment targets, further compound the problem, with some forces granting “vetting clearance despite knowing disturbing information about applicants”. For example, the Met, even after being criticised in the Casey Review for inadequate vetting, is one of several forces to invite failed applicants to reapply, emphasising a complex balance between maintaining standards and meeting recruitment goals. This dynamic reflects a paradox whereby services that are struggling to recruit, in part as a result of perceptions of racism and sexism in their ranks, may relax vetting practices further to boost recruitment, potentially admitting individuals with undesirable attitudes and influences that perpetuate discriminatory cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Standardise and Enhance Vetting Procedures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish standardised vetting procedures across all branches of the military and police forces, ensuring consistent questions and criteria are used during the screening process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include in-person interviews as part of the national assessment standards for the police, providing opportunities to confirm, contextualise and clarify information provided by candidates on application forms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide comprehensive training and guidance to recruiters and vetting personnel on identifying potential extremist threats, including collaboration with Prevent teams and leveraging of specialist knowledge from experts in the field. There are subtleties and complexities in the symbology of far-right extremism, and non-experts or those without training might easily miss signs of affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Strengthen Online Screening&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement more comprehensive and standardised online screening procedures for both military and police recruitment, incorporating lessons from extremist risk assessment frameworks used by security practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conduct thorough checks of social media profiles to identify any potential extremist affiliations, discriminatory content or inflammatory posts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Address privacy concerns by ensuring that the screening process is conducted in accordance with relevant legal and ethical guidelines and provide clear explanations to candidates about the purpose and scope of the screening.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Expand Reference and Social Circle Checks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognise the importance of gathering insights from individuals who can provide valuable information about the candidate’s background, behaviour and potential extremist affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider conducting interviews with teachers or school staff, as well as reference checks and interviews with friends, family, colleagues, employers and relevant individuals from the candidate’s immediate social circle as part of the vetting process for both the military and the police.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish clear guidelines and protocols for conducting these interviews to ensure consistency, fairness and respect for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Enhance Tattoo Policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Revise tattoo policies to include specific guidance and examples of proscribed symbols, iconography and references associated with far-right extremism, based on information from extremism experts and databases such as those developed by the Anti-Defamation League.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Train recruiting and vetting personnel on far-right culture, signs, symbols and terminology to enhance their ability to identify extremist tattoos and covert references.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Strengthen Oversight and Reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve oversight mechanisms to monitor the effectiveness and compliance of vetting procedures in the security forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure there are ethical barriers in place so that recruitment goals do not override vetting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish clear protocols for reporting concerns identified during vetting, enabling the security forces to make referrals to Prevent for individuals identified as potential extremists or vulnerable to extremism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement ongoing vetting procedures and continue to develop processes to take appropriate action if individuals fail to meet the vetting criteria or if concerns arise post-recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;training&quot;&gt;TRAINING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training processes are essential in preventing far-right extremism in the UK security forces, by ingraining awareness and understanding of the threat, as well as providing environments for preventive interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that the very nature of training processes within the security forces may also contribute to the risk of far-right radicalisation. Basic or initial training serve as the initial point of engagement, embedding values. The bonding effect of a mix of both sanctioned and unsanctioned peer dynamics, isolation, initiation ceremonies, traditions or practices, discipline and even (controlled) violence is sometimes used to create a unit or “in-group”. If this environment or subsequent training environments are infused with discriminatory unit-building practices, this can lower resilience to extremism. Extreme forms of obedience training that instil a willingness to sacrifice one’s life for the collective may foster a toxic hierarchical culture, sense of allegiance to the group, and elitism that can in extreme cases be used to justify extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a common element of military training in relation to addressing the need to fight an enemy in defence of the state is “othering”, a formal or informal method used to dehumanise and vilify the enemy – which is seen by some as a tool to make it easier for troops to engage in combat and take lives. As discussed later in this section, dehumanising training methods, including the use of racist terms, have the potential to contribute to far-right radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Vehvilainen’s conviction, the MoD collaborated with the police and the Home Office to create specific Prevent training for the military. Defence Intelligence’s “Insider Threat” team also participated in joint training, and a policy in March 2019 introduced updates to armed forces training. Recruits in Phase One (basic training) establishments now receive a Prevent briefing, although its content remains unclear. The MoD also aims to raise awareness among key personnel about identifying signs of radicalisation and the Prevent referral process. In 2019, the MoD stated that all personnel would receive some form of Prevent training at least once, either in person or using Home Office-designed e-learning products, with the aspiration of making Prevent training mandatory annually for all personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HMICFRS has found that while most police forces mandate Prevent training using e-learning packages for officers and staff, monitoring and recording of compliance varies among forces, leading to unknown completion rates. While this training likely enhances understanding of radicalisation signs and the Prevent referral process, HMICFRS highlights that the potential vulnerability of staff to extremism was generally excluded from forces’ Prevent training. Officers and staff also felt that e-training was less effective than that delivered in person by facilitators who could make training “directly relevant to the local policing environment”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2022 Ofsted review of welfare during armed forces’ initial training revealed that while trainees receive security briefings and complete Prevent training during induction, the depth and frequency of updates are insufficient for troop protection. The report recommends detailed and regular training for commanders to enhance understanding of potential national and local risks, including from online sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD’s 2019 Report on Inappropriate Behaviours found that mandated training on diversity, inclusion and values sometimes emphasised compliance over long-term behavioural and cultural change. Senior ranks’ under-representation in attendance was noted, and additional training on behaviours, ethics and culture and inclusion, although impactful, was found to not be uniformly deployed across all Defence forces. External stakeholders have suggested that there is a lack of skill and specialist knowledge among the armed forces to deliver training effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is the risk that the training processes within the security forces may even contribute to the risk of far-right radicalisation. A former soldier recruited by the Scottish Defence League claimed that dehumanising training processes, including racist terms, could contribute to radicalisation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the army it’s all “raghead this, raghead that” and those terms are used to make us think they are something different to us. You’re more likely to go kill them if that’s what you’ve been trained to think of them as. You’re brainwashed in the army to be more bigoted than racist and it plants that seed of hate in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A soldier from another regiment spoke of how he and his comrades would “other” everyone outside their battalion as “white P*kis”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military and police education and training environments are often the first line of engagement for new recruits, ingraining the service’s associated values in recruits. This type of education often continues throughout the period of service, with training environments serving to reinforce hyper-masculinised norms and role expectations within the ranks. These environments may contribute to susceptibility to far-right extremism. Humour and banter that may be misogynistic and racist is also part of in-/out-group formation, with gallows humour promoting in-group bonding. Examples of this can be seen in the various offensive WhatsApp groups in which police officers have been implicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Enhance Prevent Training&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide detailed and frequent Prevent training to all service personnel, ensuring they understand the potential national and local risks associated with extremism, including from online sources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tailor training to service personnel’s understanding and experience of far-right extremism within their context.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide Prevent training regularly that specifically addresses emerging challenges and incorporate the most up-to-date intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include discussions on the signs of radicalisation, the Prevent referral process and the importance of vigilance in identifying potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include service personnel in the design and delivery of this type of training. Additionally, ensure that sustainable Training of the Trainers systems are established, so that effective engagement continues as individuals move in and out of training roles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Address Training Gaps and Limitations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve the depth and frequency of security briefings and Prevent duty training provided during induction to adequately protect personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement comprehensive training that explores the potential negative implications of military training, including the risks of radicalisation and the impact of potentially dehumanising processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foster an environment where questions can be asked and addressed by trainers, recognising the limitations of e-training in effectively engaging trainees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that trainers are equipped to deliver training and communicate effectively with the intended audience. Evidence shows that messengers are key to reception of the message.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Strengthen Values-Based Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shift the focus of training from compliance to long-term behavioural and cultural change, emphasising the importance of diversity, inclusion and values such as respect, equality and tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that senior ranks actively participate in the training to set a positive example and promote a culture of inclusivity throughout the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Promote Critical Thinking and Ethical Decision-Making&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include modules on critical thinking skills and ethical decision-making, enabling security force members to navigate complex situations while upholding democratic values, human rights and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide training that encourages questioning of stereotypes, biases and extremist ideologies, promoting a culture of critical thinking and challenging extremist narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Gender-Sensitive, Intersectional Training&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Incorporate gender-sensitive and intersectional training modules to address the unique challenges and vulnerabilities faced by individuals of different genders within the security forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide education on gender dynamics, stereotypes and biases to foster a more inclusive and respectful environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Include discussions on the intersectionality of gender with other identities, such as race, religion and sexual orientation, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of diverse experiences and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Regularly Evaluate and Update Training Programmes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conduct regular evaluations of training programmes to assess their effectiveness in countering far-right extremism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stay informed about best practices, research and global trends in countering violent extremism to ensure training remains up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foster a culture of continuous learning and adaptability to effectively respond to emerging challenges and evolving threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance-and-accountability&quot;&gt;GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governance and accountability processes play a crucial role in preventing far-right extremism within the security forces, and are vital in identifying cases where recruits become disillusioned over time. Disillusionment not evident at the vetting stage may arise as new recruits with idealistic notions of their roles confront the harsh realities of work in the security forces, potentially leading to shifts in views and even extremism. The path from patriotic ideals to disillusionment, combined with nationalism and anti-government sentiment, can be driven in part by negative experiences or a perception of failure. These experiences may lead individuals to believe that political elites are not addressing “real problems”, fuelling grievances that can push them towards far-right violent extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, internal barriers to reporting concerns about extremism can pose a significant challenge. At the division level, it is often up to individuals who happen themselves to belong to an “out-group” to challenge discriminatory and/or extremist sentiments personally, which can result in bullying and suppression of reporting efforts. Military surveys reveal that senior leadership is often less aware than lower-ranked leadership of extremist sentiment within the ranks, potentially due to reduced interaction. Despite the importance of reporting being communicated and encouraged during training, it is often perceived as a betrayal of division unity, marking the individual as a disrupter and pushing them into the out-group. The severity of this sentiment varies across roles, with combat and special operations roles fostering stronger in-/out-group identities due to their reliance on division unity in life-or-death situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are governance and accountability measures in place in the police and military services, with both barring discriminatory attitudes and behaviours. Most UK police forces, mandated by Section 26(1) of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015, are bound by the Prevent duty to identify and support individuals who may be vulnerable to radicalisation or involvement in terrorism. However, this does not apply to the MoD, despite calls for a review (including from service personnel themselves), particularly for military police dealing with internal risks presented by staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military police are responsible for investigating extremism-related concerns within the armed forces, with any suspicions about serving members reported in the first instance to civilian police, who then provide the military police unit with advice about appropriate follow-up actions. Defence Intelligence’s Counter Intelligence unit established its “Insider Threat” team in 2018 to counter far-right extremism threats, collaborating with Prevent teams and the police, “one of the only publicly known collaborations between a western military and a formal counter-radicalisation or de-radicalisation programme outside of the armed forces”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from referring individuals to Prevent, the MoD also retains responsibility for disciplining members who breach standards and values. An internal guide for Army officers emphasises reporting concerns related to possible far-right extremism through the chain of command and the Army Warning, Advisory and Reporting Point. This document appears to be part of a wider effort on the part of the MoD to stress to personnel that far-right extremism will not be tolerated, and to encourage vigilance and reporting of any concerns among personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the police investigate reports of individuals engaged in extremism, there is little evidence of specific policies that refer to potential insider threats. An HMICFRS inspection of the police’s contribution to the government’s Prevent programme in 2020 revealed a lack of consideration regarding colleagues’ vulnerability to or engagement in extremism, with few forces having safeguarding arrangements. Similarly, only two forces could provide examples of where they had used the Prevent referral process for members of staff thought to be vulnerable to extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the military has said that individuals exhibiting extremist views will be neither tolerated nor permitted to serve, enforcing this policy is complicated, due to unclear guidance on permitted political activities. A report from Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee in July 2022 highlights: “The fact that the Armed Forces do not provide clear direction to service personnel regarding membership of any organisation – let alone an extremist one – would appear to be something of an anomaly”, which it also describes as “a somewhat risky approach”. The government’s response states that MoD staff “are permitted to join non-proscribed groups if and when it is compatible with service values and standards”, and that members may “join political parties and attend political meetings in a personal capacity”. Service personnel, however, may not take part in political marches or demonstrations. This policy seemingly does not account for the increasingly post-organisational nature of the far-right extremist landscape (that is, the transition away from clearly structured organisations towards loose networks of individuals) nor the array of online forums that would not be banned under this definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have also been serious complaints about reporting procedures within the military. Two paratroopers who successfully sued the British Army in 2019 claimed that there was governance-level refusal to acknowledge the issue of far-right extremism and racist ideology, prompting their departure from the force. An MoD 2019 report similarly found existing processes to be inadequate, highlighting the need to “resource, develop and implement an anonymous tool for reporting inappropriate behaviours across Defence”. No progress had been made on this by the 2020 Progress Review, which also recommended the clarification of consequences for unacceptable behaviour, which are “currently not sufficiently visible for people to have confidence that action will be taken if they raise an issue”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Army has established a standard for automatic dismissal, stating that any soldier who receives a custodial sentence for offences related to far-right extremism will be discharged, even this threshold has presented challenges. For example, Royal Navy submariner Kenneth McCourt was not only allowed to remain in the Navy, despite the MoD having knowledge of his links to far-right organisations, but he has also since been promoted, including taking on responsibilities for the training of subordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Consider Inclusion of MoD in Prevent Duty and/or Enhance Collaboration Between MoD and Prevent Teams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conduct a comprehensive review to determine whether the responsibilities of relevant units within the MoD, such as military police forces handling internal risks, should be included under Prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthen collaboration between the MoD and Home Office Prevent teams by establishing formal channels for sharing information and concerns related to far-right extremism and potential insider threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facilitate regular communication and coordination to ensure a unified approach in addressing extremism concerns within the military.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Develop Clear Guidelines on Political Activities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide clear guidance to military personnel regarding political activities and the organisations with which they are permitted to engage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Define boundaries of and restrictions on political involvement, ensuring alignment with service values and standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarify consequences for engaging in unacceptable behaviours or having affiliations with extremist organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Strengthen Reporting Procedures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement an anonymous reporting tool for reporting inappropriate behaviours, including extremist ideologies, across the security services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allocate sufficient resources to developing and implementing the reporting tool effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve existing reporting processes to ensure visibility and confidence that appropriate action will be taken in response to reported issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Review Disciplinary Measures and Discharge Policies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assess the effectiveness of current disciplinary measures and discharge policies in addressing far-right extremism and racist ideology within the security services.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider revising discharge policies to ensure automatic dismissal for offences related to far-right extremism, including hate crimes and offences resulting in custodial sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Review and investigate cases where individuals with extremist links or convictions were allowed to continue serving and take appropriate action, including dismissal if warranted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;separation&quot;&gt;SEPARATION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any significant transition point, such as entering or exiting service, creates the potential for radicalisation or deradicalisation resulting from the disruption of social structures and networks, which can lead to the challenge of ideological viewpoints. Additionally, far-right groups actively target veterans in their recruitment strategies for their useful skills in relation to planning and executing violent acts. Therefore, separation processes are an essential part of preventing far-right extremism in UK security forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of “identity fusion”, where personal identity becomes inseparable from the service identity, can pose challenges during separation and reintegration into civilian life. Masculinity expectations, along with stigma around seeking mental health help, may also hinder the transition. Recognising and addressing the practical and psychological impacts of separation is crucial, particularly for those leaving the security forces involuntarily. Grievances and inadequacies post-separation can lead to individuals seeking comfort in far-right militant organisations that might share some similarities in organisational hierarchy and cultural traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypermasculine environmental expectations can contribute to mental health difficulties such as post-traumatic stress disorder, and could be an indicator of susceptibility to extremism. This is especially true when an individual experiences difficulties transitioning out of service life or a feeling of struggle to maintain hypermasculinity, particularly for those who served in combat or special operations roles and/or in conflict zones. Further focus on the process of “unmaking” martialised masculinity is needed for the benefit of all veterans, but it is also important to remember that there are many intersectional identities held by service personnel that could impact their path in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Measures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the military and the police acknowledge the threat to former service personnel from extremist recruitment attempts, with direct targeting by far-right groups via social media and veteran support charities. These groups often draw upon narratives of betrayal of service members by the system, exemplified by stories about homeless veterans. The MoD’s 2019 Prevent policy covers serving personnel, veterans and individuals with links to the military, recognising the ongoing risk of radicalisation and recruitment into far-right extremism beyond active service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach taken in the UK, where civilian structures are involved in addressing cases of extremism within the military, contrasts with that of countries such as Germany, for example, where the Military Counterintelligence Service (Militärischer Abschirmdienst) takes the lead. The UK’s integrated approach, using expertise and lessons from various sectors of the government’s response to extremism, benefits from a broader range of resources and insights beyond the military domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forces such as Greater Manchester Police have implemented programmes to track returning soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan and have been flagged as potential extremism risks. While specific details about the extent of this police programme are limited, it represents a proactive effort to address potential risks associated with extremism among veterans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are seemingly fewer structural supports in place for separating or retiring police officers. While there may be non-public efforts by individual police forces or regions, the lack of public evidence of official programmes seems to indicate that the primary effort to support officers who might be experiencing mental or physical challenges with transitioning out of the service is conducted through independent charities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain limitations in current approaches to addressing far-right extremism among individuals transitioning out of the military. The case of Alek Yerbury, a self-professed far-right extremist who claims to have left the military due to his “hatred” of the government, reveals a missed opportunity for intervention. Yerbury states that he made his sentiments clear to his superiors during his one-year notice period before leaving the military. This raises questions about whether efforts were made to challenge his extremist views or to report the potential threat or his susceptibility to recruitment into far-right groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Prevent policy is designed to cover both serving personnel and veterans, a gap appears to exist (according to the available evidence) in interventions or referrals to Prevent when soon-to-be veterans exhibit concerning behaviours or express extremist ideologies. This gap is significant, especially considering that individuals in the process of transitioning out of the military may be at increased risk of recruitment into far-right extremism, as discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a range of resources across both the police and military services focused on supporting individuals’ mental and physical health, both during the transition and as veterans. However, these services should continue to be strengthened, especially for the police, for whom it appears there is not yet as much institutional support available. Additionally, these services should aim to be coherent and consistently improving across the different strategies being developed by the UK government and the three devolved legislatures of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Providing support, intervention and referral mechanisms during transitions could be crucial in mitigating recruitment risk and addressing underlying factors contributing to vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Support Transition and Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As well as delivering support programming, engage veterans in defining the challenges they face in transitioning out of a service. Evidence shows that credibility of the messenger is essential to effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement comprehensive mental health and wellbeing programmes to address the stress, trauma and psychological challenges faced by security force personnel leaving service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop tailored resources and interventions to support individuals during the transition period, and provide ongoing mental health support for both serving personnel and veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognise and pre-empt, to the extent possible, the practical and psychological impacts and vulnerabilities associated with the point of separation from a security service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop targeted interventions that address the specific needs of individuals going through the transition process, taking into account the potential risks of radicalisation and the loss of personal identity tied to the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish support programmes specifically designed for individuals who are involuntarily exiting the security services. These should address the unique challenges and vulnerabilities associated with involuntary exits, including feelings of grievance, loss of identity and potential susceptibility to radicalisation. Raise awareness of these particular risk dynamics with existing support services and networks/charities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Monitoring and Evaluation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Regularly review and update separation procedures within the UK security forces to address the risks and vulnerabilities. Continuously assess their effectiveness in identifying and addressing far-right extremism risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conduct comprehensive exit interviews with individuals to monitor potential risks and identify concerning behaviours or signs of extremist ideologies. This can provide an opportunity to gather information, address grievances and intervene where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implement monitoring mechanisms to track wellbeing and the reintegration progress, focusing in particular on individuals who have exited involuntarily. Regular check-ins, support networks and follow-up procedures can help identify and address emerging challenges or signs of vulnerability to radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish mechanisms to monitor and evaluate the impact of programmes and interventions aimed at preventing and countering far-right extremism. Assess the effectiveness of mental health support programmes, transitional assistance initiatives and referral mechanisms to ensure they meet the needs of security force personnel and reduce the risk of recruitment into extremist groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addressing the complex and pressing challenge of far-right extremism within the UK security forces, a multidimensional strategy is essential, encompassing effective vetting, targeted training, robust accountability and dedicated support during the critical transition phase out of service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current vetting procedures in the police and military face challenges in identifying and acting on potential extremism concerns, revealing gaps in the process and a failure to address identified extremist vulnerabilities in an appropriate manner. This represents a missed opportunity for early intervention and referral to appropriate services. Lessons from established counterterrorism risk assessment frameworks should inform improvements in vetting. Ongoing vetting is crucial to address evolving risks within the security forces, necessitating strengthened accountability to address threats effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ties in closely to the importance of training. There is a need to improve prevention-focused training as a regular service requirement, ensuring that trainers are adequately equipped to deliver this type of training. Lessons from existing courses for Prevent practitioners and other security sector partners can guide this process. Training programmes within security forces should integrate insights from research on hypermasculinity and racism. Training efforts should also target cultural issues contributing to mental health concerns. A supportive training environment encouraging help-seeking, addressing mental health stigmas and providing resources can reduce radicalisation risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on lessons from other police and military reforms, robust accountability processes are crucial, addressing misconduct, incompetence and extremist ideologies within the security forces. Enforcement of consequences, including dismissal for failure to maintain vetting status, is essential to the integrity and effectiveness of the security forces. These accountability processes should be transparent, consistent and supported by strong leadership to foster a culture of professionalism and prevent the tolerance of extremist views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition out of the police or military represents a critical phase when individuals may be vulnerable to radicalisation. It is important to recognise and pre-empt the practical and psychological impacts of the transition and provide comprehensive support programmes, encompassing mental health and wellbeing support, exit interviews to monitor potential risks and tailored interventions for individuals experiencing involuntary exits. By addressing the specific challenges faced during this transition, the security forces can reduce the risk of recruitment into far-right extremism and promote successful reintegration into civilian life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing these recommendations requires a comprehensive and integrated approach, drawing lessons from existing frameworks and practices while also adapting to the evolving nature of the threat posed by far-right extremism. Ultimately, such efforts will contribute to the resilience, safety, integrity and trustworthiness of the security forces, protecting both their personnel and the communities they serve.&lt;/p&gt;

As the battle for control continues, neither side can afford to surrender control of this vital area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-stalemate-and-renewed-sense-of-urgency&quot;&gt;A stalemate and renewed sense of urgency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine seems to become a more entrenched facet of the European security landscape, forces on both sides are increasingly faced with the potential of a stalemate. The Ukrainian counteroffensive could slow down even further in the near future, according to Michael Kofman, military analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA). The difficulty of conducting modern warfare at this scale was proved already by the Russians during the first stages of the war, in absence of any comparable defensive line. Even enthusiastic Western commentators have recently labelled Russian defence systems in Ukraine as “formidable”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether these efforts have, in fact, been formidable remains up for discussion. The invasion of Ukraine has shown that loitering munitions, drones, and hybrid warfare are able to create a stalemate through a preventive formation of sufficient fighting mass. This has also been echoed by Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who recently conceded that, as in World War I, the level of technology on either side precludes prospects for a “deep and beautiful breakthrough.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alleged slowing down of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, in conjunction with limited active Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF) defence along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line near Avdiivka, have the potential to postpone a Ukrainian victory. From an alliance politics perspective, the counteroffensive was instrumental for showing Western partners that their economic and military commitments were worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1C96Zgx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This chart shows some of the major factors influencing Ukraine’s current sense of urgency in its war against Russia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited successes of the counteroffensive, when coupled with the uncertainty around Ukrainian casualty rates and President Zelensky’s internal struggles against corruption, however, have all aligned with (and potentially contributed to) wavering support from the West compared to the first months of the invasion. US support was already on rockier ground before, as claimed by Zelensky, Western attention returned to the Middle East. The EU is grappling with its own internal struggles, such as Poland’s response to the diversion of Ukrainian grain through mainland Europe instead of maritime export routes. Other European countries have also threatened to suspend aid in response to the diversion as well. This setback is due to Russia’s weaponisation of Ukraine’s grain exports, echoing Stalin’s utilisation of grain and hunger as political instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the stability required for any renewed Russian efforts may be in question. Recently, Vladimir Putin appeared on Chinese media declaring that he wants a different world order, dissimilar from the one envisioned by “countries with colonial legacies”. Internally, this translated into a series of repressive actions, such as sentencing artists, monitoring academics connected to foreign institutions, banning the “international LGBT movement”, and sacking a Natural Resources Ministry Official on grounds of corruption. The dubious death of Yevgeny Prigozhin and other Wagner Group associates also sent ripples through domestic channels otherwise supportive of the war. More recently, a former Russian Air Force Commander, Vladimir Sviridov, and his wife were found dead without explanation. Reassuringly, the Federal Security Service (FSB) officers are investigating. These repressive tactics are familiar staples of Russian autocratic measures dating back to at least the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to say whether these are symptoms of a greater problem, although it is worth recalling how frequently despotic emperors have been deposed by their Praetorian Guards. All of these measures, however, do coincide with the Russian population’s digestion of the current situation on the ground in Ukraine; as of late May 2023, roughly 47,000 Russian men under the age of 50 died in the war, and this is according to conservative estimates. As the military analyst Anders Puck Nielsen pointed out, this is already more than three times the number of the total casualties the Soviet Union (with 260 million inhabitants as of 1979) experienced during the ten years war in Afghanistan (which means roughly 1,500 dead per year in Afghanistan, as opposed to at least approximately 30,000 per year in this war) – a war which has often been claimed to be one of the major reasons for the Soviet Union’s economic and political collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TTnr4rZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This chart shows some of the more noteworthy developments influencing Russian internal and external security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Ukrainian dream of a quick ousting of Russia’s invasion further fades into preparations for a longer conflict, time is of the essence for both sides, before factors beyond the battlefield begin to erode momentum. Therefore, it makes sense that Kyiv and Moscow will expand their scopes beyond the arena of land warfare to see where other gains might be made. One such arena—the Black Sea—has already seen its fair share of action, but may very well become a revisited point of priority in the next phases of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s initial maritime attacks on Ukraine’s coastline, including the infamous encounter at Snake Island and its most recent retreat from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, show how maritime logistics have remained a crucial strategic facet of the war. The land warfare aspects of the invasion have created the conditions for a war of attrition, which requires a whole-of-society commitment to sustain supply lines, infrastructure and production capacity. World War I ended on the eastern front, in part, because of a lack of resources that ultimately led to revolution and capitulation. In Russia’s approach to its invasion, maritime logistics have proved equally pivotal, as evidenced by recent events in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-strategic-importance-of-the-black-sea&quot;&gt;The strategic importance of the Black Sea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic importance of the Black Sea lies primarily in its logistical value for Russia. The AFRF rely heavily on railroads and specialised brigades, such as the Material Technical Support brigades, for maintaining supply chains. However, these landbound brigades face challenges in meeting the demands required for sustained invasion efforts, such as capacity for physically transporting military goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the role of maritime logistics. Large cargo vessels are an easy remedy the difficulty of moving large quantities of supplies over land. With Russia’s closest ports to Ukraine being in the Black Sea, uninhibited access to these ports is essential for Russia’s military operations and heavily incentivises Russia to maintain a strategic advantage at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This value has not been lost on the Kremlin. Russia has already used its Black Sea power to impose a blockade against Odessa, Ukraine’s major port and primary hub for its grain exports. Russia’s Navy continuously targets grain depots in Odesa to eliminate Ukraine’s economic prowess, having allegedly destroyed at least 300,000 tons of grain. Additionally, Russia’s presence in the Black Sea provides the AFRF with a strategic vantage point for launching missile attacks. The Black Sea is also a major Russian hub for exporting oil and other critical goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, it is no surprise that Russia would go to great lengths to maintain its operations through the Black Sea, even by using a fleet of “special ships” that violate international maritime law to procure military goods from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-sparta-iv-a-case-study-in-russias-prioritisation-of-black-sea-logistics&quot;&gt;The SPARTA IV: A case study in Russia’s prioritisation of Black Sea logistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fleet is owned by the sanctioned Oboronlogistics LLC, a company owned by the Russian MoD and connected to the Chief Directorate for Troop Accommodations JSC, which shares close ties to Russian oligarch Timur Vadimovich Ivanov, deputy Ministry of Defense and close ally of Putin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lqF2zvE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ SPARTA IV – Layout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fleet includes ships including the SPARTA II, PIZMA and SPARTA IV that appear to transport Russian military equipment from Syria to Novorossiysk, one of Russia’s main Black Sea ports. According to the Center of Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the SPARTA IV specifically even moved howitzers and other artillery pieces. Throughout 2023, these ships appeared to frequently ferry military goods to and from the Middle East, while Putin made his interests clear through renewed arms purchases with Iran, and senior-level meetings with Iranian and Hamas leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oboronlogistics’ fleet is not stopped in the Bosporus because of the grey legal area in which they play, and they prove Ukrainian efforts insufficient. On 28 February 2022, just four days after the beginning of the invasion, Turkey closed the Bosporus to all military vessels. However, Turkey’s decision to do this was no small action, as the Montreux Convention holds Turkey accountable if the country appears to misuse this ability. The Montreux Convention defines the preconditions necessary for Turkey to restrict movement through the Bosporus, the restrictions Turkey may impose on vessels if these preconditions are met, and the limits of Turkey’s ability to impose restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey may only restrict freedom of navigation through the Bosporus if it is a belligerent, it perceives to be threatened, or has legal obligation to aid a belligerent. It can only restrict warships and auxiliary vessels, and it must still permit daytime passage to these vessels when they are formally stationed in the Black Sea, so long as the passage is announced in advance by the vessels. Turkey cannot restrict commercial vessels, and it is not guaranteed the right to check the cargo of ships transiting the Bosporus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the loophole Russia uses. By operating assets such as the SPARTA IV as commercial vessels, the ships are not beholden to the same ones applied by Turkey to military ships. However, an investigation conducted by the team (with other analysts converging in the assessment) revealed that these ships are actually possibly equivalent to auxiliary vessels transporting military materiel through the Bosporus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the ability of these ships to enter and exit the Black Sea freely, Ukraine appears to have paid close attention to these vessels. Since the Ukrainian Navy lost all its limited capability in the very early days of the war, Ukraine seems to have pivoted to guerrilla war, employing asymmetric tactics and capabilities wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2023, Ukraine even used unmanned surface vessels (USVs) to target the SPARTA IV’s alleged military escort on one voyage, and changes in behaviour of the Russian vessels (such as diversions in sailing routes and the obfuscation of AIS tracking signals) indicates that the fleet was cautious to avoid detection or confrontation. Reliance on unmanned platforms at sea, however, is a different business than doing so on land. While the use of USVs is as old as World War I, a persistent difficulty in their use is the inability employ them at a distance, making destroyers and military escorts reliable assets in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VpxPF5H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ USVs then and now. The chart shows the size difference between a 1915 Imperial German Fenlenkboote and a 2023 Ukrainian USV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Russian military capability currently provides sufficient protection to allow Oboronlogistics’ fleet to avoid both international law and USVs at the same time. Moreover, the Russian navy, though suffering maritime losses unmatched in the West since World War II (including the loss of the Moskva Project 1164 Atlant guided-missile cruiser and the Rostov-on-Don Project 636.3 Improved Kilo-class submarine – an historical achievement in itself) was nonetheless able to hamper the Black Sea corridor, where Ukrainian civilian cargo vessels were trying to resist the Russian pressure over the movement of grain, to the point of halting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the Vietnamese and guerrilla fighters in Algeria knew very well, the reality is that nobody likes guerrilla warfare. In the 1975 film “The Battle of Algiers”, when being questioned by a French journalist on the practice of planting explosives in baskets, the fictional Algerian guerrilla leader Ben M’Hidi replies: “Obviously, planes would make things easier for us. Give us your bombers, monsieur, and you can have our baskets.” As declared by sources in Russia, the war in 2024 could renew the Russian attempt to take over the coast and Odessa. Ukraine and its allies must be prepared – losing the battle for the Black Sea is simply not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defeating Russia’s attempt to subjugate Ukraine must be based upon an understanding of what Russia is trying to achieve, how it is intending to achieve its objectives, and its capacity to implement this plan. The Russian theory of victory has been through various iterations over the course of the war, but Moscow now has a clear plan for how it intends to proceed. This article seeks to outline Russia’s intent in order to provide a basis for planning how its plan can be disrupted. Outlining Russian intent and capacity does not represent an assessment as to the likelihood of it succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-strategic-objectives&quot;&gt;Russian Strategic Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia still maintains the strategic objective of bringing about the subjugation of Ukraine. It now believes that it is winning. Surrender terms currently being proposed by Russian intermediaries include Ukraine ceding the territory already under Russian control along with Kharkiv, and in some versions Odessa; agreeing not to join NATO; and maintaining a head of state approved by Russia. The only significant concession Russia proposes is that what is left of Ukraine can join the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process by which Russia aims to bring about this outcome is in three stages. The first requires the continuation of pressure along the length of the Ukrainian front to drain the Armed Forces of Ukraine’s (AFU) munitions and reserves of personnel. Parallel to this effort, the Russian Special Services are tasked with breaking the resolve of Ukraine’s international partners to continue to provide military aid. Once military aid has been significantly limited such that Ukrainian munition stocks become depleted, Russia intends to initiate further offensive operations to make significant – if slow – gains on the battlefield. These gains are then intended to be used as leverage against Kyiv to force capitulation on Russian terms. The planning horizon for the implementation of these objectives, which is providing the baseline for Russian force generation and industrial outputs, is that victory should be achieved by 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital to appreciate that Russian goals may expand with success, and given that the Kremlin has violated almost all significant agreements both with Ukraine and NATO, there is no assurance that even if Russia got what it wanted out of negotiations it would not subsequently endeavour to physically occupy the rest of Ukraine or be emboldened to use force elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-military-capacity&quot;&gt;Russian Military Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military began 2023 with a highly disorganised force in Ukraine comprising approximately 360,000 troops. By the beginning of the Ukrainian offensive in June 2023, this had risen to 410,000 troops and was becoming more organised. Over the summer of 2023, Russia established training regiments along the border and in the occupied territories and, following the mutiny of Wagner forces, endeavoured to standardise its units, breaking down the previous trend towards private armies. By the beginning of 2024, the Russian Operational Group of Forces in the occupied territories comprised 470,000 troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While Russian force quality is unlikely to increase so long as the Ukrainians can maintain a significant level of attrition across the force, the Russians will be able to maintain a steady tempo of attacks throughout 2024&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces have reverted above battalion level to the traditional Soviet order of battle of regiments, divisions and combined arms armies, but have been significantly altered below the level of the regiment. Battalions are organised as line and storm battalions, and tend to operate in company groups which fight in small, dispersed detachments. This reflects not only adaptation to battlefield conditions, but also the shortage of trained officers able to coordinate larger formations, with a significant proportion of Russian junior officers currently being promoted from the ranks and receiving condensed officer training, sometimes as short as two months long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian Group of Forces continues to take significant casualties, but is nevertheless growing in size. Operating at greater scale allows the Russian military to take measures that guarantee the integrity of the front line. Units can generally be rotated out of the line once they have taken up to 30% casualties – the point at which they are judged to be ineffective – and are then regenerated. While no large-scale offensive is currently taking place, Russian units are tasked with conducting smaller tactical attacks that at minimum inflict steady losses on Ukraine and allow Russian forces to seize and hold positions. In this way, the Russians are maintaining a consistent pressure on a number of points. Although the Russian military’s aspiration to increase in size to 1.5 million personnel has not been realised, recruiters are currently achieving almost 85% of their assigned targets for contracting troops to fight in Ukraine. The Kremlin therefore believes that it can sustain the current rate of attrition through 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of combat equipment, the Russian Group of Forces holds approximately 4,780 barrel artillery pieces, of which 20% are self-propelled; 1,130 MLRS; 2,060 tanks; and 7,080 other armoured fighting vehicles, primarily consisting of MT-LBs, BMPs and BTRs. These continue to be supported by 290 helicopters, of which 110 are attack helicopters, and 310 fast jets. These equipment sets are limited in how they can be employed by ammunition shortages, especially for key natures like 220 mm multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and fluctuating availability of 152mm ammunition. Some sets, like fast air, are constrained by the availability of pilots with sufficient experience to carry out key missions. Russian air crew losses – including operators in the Il-20 Coot and A-50U Mainstay, shot down – amount to 159 personnel, which given the unevenness of flight hours in Russian squadrons amounts to a serious loss of capability. Nevertheless, the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) can continue to mount a significant sortie rate and deliver stand-off munitions. The overall assessment is that while Russian force quality is unlikely to increase so long as the AFU can maintain a significant level of attrition across the force, the Russians will be able to maintain a steady tempo of attacks throughout 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-industrial-capacity&quot;&gt;Russian Industrial Capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of Russian industry’s capacity to support ongoing operations, Russia has significantly mobilised its defence industry, increasing shifts and expanding production lines at existing facilities as well as bringing previously mothballed plants back online. This has led to significant increases in production output. For example, Russia is delivering approximately 1,500 tanks to its forces per year along with approximately 3,000 armoured fighting vehicles of various types. Russian missile production has similarly increased. At the beginning of 2023, for instance, Russian production of Iskandr 9M723 ballistic missiles was six per month, with available missile stocks of 50 munitions. By the beginning of 2024, not only had Russia used a significant number of these missiles each month since the summer of 2023, but it had increased its stockpile to nearly 200 Iskandr 9M723 ballistic and 9M727 cruise missiles. A similar picture can be observed across other core missile types like the Kh-101.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these achievements, Russia faces significant limitations in the longevity and reliability of its industrial output. Of the tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles, for example, approximately 80% are not new production but are instead refurbished and modernised from Russian war stocks. The number of systems held in storage means that while Russia can maintain a consistent output through 2024, it will begin to find that vehicles require deeper refurbishment through 2025, and by 2026 it will have exhausted most of the available stocks. As the number of refurbished vehicles goes down, industrial capacity can go into making new platforms, but this will necessarily mean a significant decrease in vehicles delivered to the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia has significantly mobilised its defence industry, increasing shifts and expanding production lines at existing facilities as well as bringing previously mothballed plants back online&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vulnerability for Russia’s complex weapons like missiles is the extensive dependence on Western-sourced components. Although Russia has maintained a steady supply of the necessary components owing to the incoherent and lackadaisical approach to sanctions adopted by Western states, a more coherent approach to countering the Russian defence industry could disrupt supply lines. Even with the existing flawed approach, the cost of components has risen by 30% for the Russian defence sector, and it has only managed to stabilise supplies rather than expand them, despite extra investment in this line of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most serious limitation for Russia, however, is ammunition manufacture. In order to achieve its aspiration to make significant territorial gains in 2025, the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) has assessed an industrial requirement to manufacture or source approximately 4 million 152mm and 1.6 million 122mm artillery shells in 2024. Russian industry has reported to the MoD that it expects to increase 152mm production from around 1 million rounds in 2023 to 1.3 million rounds over the course of 2024, and to only produce 800,000 122mm rounds over the same period. Moreover, the Russian MoD does not believe it can significantly raise production in subsequent years, unless new factories are set up and raw material extraction is invested in with a lead time beyond five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that to properly resource the armed forces, Russia must – in the short term – further draw down its remaining 3 million rounds of stored ammunition, though much of this is in poor condition. To further compensate for shortages, Russia has signed supply and production contracts with Belarus, Iran, North Korea and Syria, with the latter only able to provide forged shell casings rather than complete shells. Although the injection of around 2 million 122mm rounds from North Korea will help Russia in 2024, it will not compensate for a significant shortfall in available 152mm munitions in 2025. Russian overall artillery production is likely to plateau at 3 million rounds per year of all natures – including MLRS, which is not considered above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian theory of victory is plausible if Ukraine’s international partners fail to properly resource the AFU. However, if Ukraine’s partners continue to provide sufficient ammunition and training support to the AFU to enable the blunting of Russian attacks in 2024, then Russia is unlikely to achieve significant gains in 2025. If Russia lacks the prospect of gains in 2025, given its inability to improve force quality for offensive operations, then it follows that it will struggle to force Kyiv to capitulate by 2026. Beyond 2026, attrition of systems will begin to materially degrade Russian combat power, while Russian industry could be disrupted sufficiently by that point, making Russia’s prospects decline over time. The latter would require Ukraine’s partners to demonstrate a semblance of competence in their measures aimed at countering Russian defence mobilisation, which remains eminently possible in spite of their performance to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopting an approach that aims to ensure Ukraine’s resistance through 2025 not only undermines the Kremlin’s theory of victory but also provides sufficient time to establish a rational mobilisation and training process for the AFU such that it can begin to qualitatively outmatch Russian forces, even if the latter continue to increase in overall size. This is critical to building opportunities to continue to threaten Russia’s position and thereby force Russia not just to seek negotiations, but to actually negotiate an end to the war on terms favourable to Ukraine.

But there are reasons for both parties to refrain from escalating further.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep into its fourth month, Israel’s offensive in Gaza remains in an intense phase of operations. While the US assesses that approximately 30% of Hamas’s fighting force has been killed, the Israeli government has little to brag about in terms of achieving its two main objectives: eradicating Hamas and freeing the approximately 130 hostages under the group’s control. Forced to juggle between far-right ministers who label any compromise with Hamas as defeatism and the families of the hostages, for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the war remains an albatross around his neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as difficult as Gaza’s operating environment is, the simmering conflict 130 miles to the north has the potential to be even worse. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hizbullah have spent the last four months engaged in a low-level, undeclared war, characterised by an incessant tit-for-tat that has produced casualties on both sides. The Israel–Lebanon border region, governed over the last 17 years by an informal arrangement that has deterred Israel and Hizbullah from replaying their full-scale conflict in 2006, is now increasingly fragile. The outstanding question is whether the war of words between senior Israeli and Hizbullah officials will, over time, become a shooting war that could compel Israeli troops to enter Lebanese territory, in what would be Israel’s fourth major ground incursion into Lebanon in 46 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israels-muddled-history-in-lebanon&quot;&gt;Israel’s Muddled History in Lebanon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israeli military operations inside Lebanon are hardly unprecedented. On 14 March 1978, the IDF launched an invasion of Southern Lebanon to push the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) north of the Litani River, 18 miles from the Israel–Lebanon border. The military campaign was instigated by a PLO terrorist attack that took place three days earlier, in which militants infiltrated Israel from the sea, took control of a bus and killed 35 Israeli tourists. The IDF would withdraw later that year on the assurance that UN peacekeepers and Israel’s Christian militia partners would exercise security control over the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four years later, in June 1982, the IDF conducted an even larger ground offensive into Lebanon, taking Israeli troops all the way to Beirut. The mission was similar to the previous incursion in 1978: destroying PLO infrastructure, bolstering the security of civilians living in Northern Israel and demolishing the PLO as a fighting force. The invasion was a mixed bag: although PLO leader Yasser Arafat was exiled to Tunisia and a buffer zone was established in Lebanon’s south, the entire operation cost Israel significant international support due to the extent of the destruction. Israel’s relations with the US were put under strain. President Ronald Reagan was lukewarm on Israel’s policy and told the Israeli prime minister at the time, Menachem Begin, that a foray into Lebanon would cause “serious complications” for US–Israel relations as a whole. The IDF would later pull back to Southern Lebanon in 1985 and consolidate its positions there, beginning a long, costly and politically unpopular occupation that would eventually conclude with a full Israeli withdrawal in 2000. Hizbullah would be the ultimate beneficiaries, taking territory south of the Litani River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Israelis also mounted smaller operations throughout this period, utilising air power in an attempt to degrade Hizbullah’s military capacity – most specifically the organisation’s rocket capability. In 1993, after Hizbullah killed five Israeli soldiers, Israel launched Operation Accountability, a week-long air campaign against Hizbullah infrastructure in Southern Lebanon and the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley. In 1996, the IDF engaged in a 16-day bombardment against Hizbullah (Operation Grapes of Wrath) to stem rocket attacks into Northern Israel. Lebanon’s ports were blockaded in a bid to stop weapons flows to Hizbullah, and the IDF conducted its first airstrikes in Beirut since the 1982 invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-second-lebanon-war&quot;&gt;The Second Lebanon War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the most extensive Israeli engagement in Lebanon occurred in the summer of 2006. On 13 July, Hizbullah militants infiltrated the border into northern Israel, abducting two Israeli soldiers and killing three others. While Hizbullah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah sought to use the Israeli soldiers as bargaining chips for the release of prisoners in Israel, such an exchange was simply inconceivable for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Hizbullah’s daring mission into Israel served as a casus belli for the IDF to initiate a comprehensive military campaign against the Lebanese terrorist group – one that would be far larger in scale and scope than the 1993 and 1996 engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Israeli intelligence and military establishment recognises that Hizbullah is much more militarily capable and politically powerful today than it was in 2006&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF not only targeted Hizbullah rocket-launching sites, command-and-control nodes and weapons storage facilities, but also took aim at Lebanese civilian infrastructure. Beirut International Airport was put out of commission; Lebanon was blockaded by sea; and Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hizbullah’s headquarters were based, were destroyed. Similar to past campaigns, Israel’s international support depreciated the longer the fighting went on. After first rejecting a ceasefire, George W Bush’s administration later pressed the Israeli government to accept one. On 11 August, the UN Security Council approved Resolution 1701, which called for a full cessation of hostilities by the combatants, a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Lebanese territory, Hizbullah’s withdrawal north of the Litani River, and the deployment of UN and Lebanese army troops to maintain the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the conventional wisdom is that the 2006 war in Lebanon ended in a loss for Israel, the reality is more nuanced. The IDF’s performance was lacking in key areas, no doubt. The Olmert government’s objectives for the campaign – getting the two Israeli hostages back and crushing Hizbullah as a fighting force – were maximalist to the point of being unattainable. As the Winograd Commission concluded in 2008, “Israel initiated a long war, which ended without its clear military victory”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel, however, wasn’t without its achievements. In the short term, Hizbullah’s military capacity was degraded. The volley of rocket fire into Northern Israel fell exponentially after the war. Deterrence was established along the Israel–Lebanon border, with Israel and Hizbullah both concluding that the costs of another round of major fighting were too high and wouldn’t serve their respective interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deterrence-is-holding--for-now&quot;&gt;Deterrence is Holding – For Now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 17-year-old arrangement has frayed ever since Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel. The Israel–Lebanon border region resembles a warzone, albeit one that hasn’t been officially declared by the combatants. Israel’s air defence system shoots down Hizbullah drones and anti-tank missiles daily, and Israeli airstrikes target various Hizbullah locations just as frequently. On 23 January, Hizbullah claimed responsibility for a missile attack on the Meron airbase in what the group said was retaliation for Israel’s assassinations of Hizbullah operatives in Lebanon and Syria. Israel has increasingly taken to using precision strikes against individual Hizbullah fighters, the most significant thus far being the 8 January assassination of Wissam al-Tawil, a commander of Hizbullah’s Radwan Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big question on the minds of Israeli, Lebanese, Hizbullah and US policymakers is whether the limited spats will expand beyond the border region. There is good reason to believe that deterrence between Israel and Hizbullah still holds up well. The Israeli intelligence and military establishment recognises that Hizbullah is much more militarily capable and politically powerful today than it was in 2006. Estimates of Hizbullah’s rank-and-file numbers range from 50,000 to 100,000. The group’s missile arsenal, complete with precision-guided anti-tank missiles, medium-range rockets and Fateh 110 projectiles, is formidable; some are able to reach any part of Israeli territory, effectively locking the entire country down in the event of major hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hizbullah has reasons to stay away from an all-out war with Israel as well. First, Lebanon’s economy is in such a depressed state that any conflict would wipe out whatever economic potential it has left by scaring away investors, eliminating tourist flows and heightening reconstruction costs that Lebanon already can’t afford, putting the country on a path to long-term financial destitution. The civilian casualties would be significant, and given the political polarisation within Lebanese politics today, Hizbullah would be foolish to assume that its current political position would survive intact. Nasrallah isn’t immune to political considerations; in addition to being a militant outfit, Hizbullah is also a political movement with seats in the Lebanese parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;All the major players appear to recognise that diplomacy is the most effective way to defuse the Israel–Hizbullah standoff, if not permanently then at least peacefully&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran, Hizbullah’s primary patron, must also be taken into account. Despite the Islamic Republic’s incessant anti-Israel statements and its material support for its proxies in the region, Tehran is unlikely to support Hizbullah stumbling into a war with Israel. Such a scenario would severely jeopardise Iran’s strategy of distancing itself from the current fighting. While US military intervention on Israel’s behalf is hardly guaranteed, Iranian officials can’t rule out the prospect of Washington becoming a party to an Israel–Hizbullah war. If that did come to pass, Iran would then have two options: fighting a much superior adversary in the US to defend its Lebanese proxy or staying on the sidelines, thereby ruining its credibility as a reliable ally. Tehran would prefer not to have to make that choice at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tempers-flare&quot;&gt;Tempers Flare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, it would be irresponsible to rule out conflict entirely. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is so concerned about the Israel–Lebanon border that he has warned about the clashes possibly triggering a regional war. As risky as another Israel–Hizbullah war would be, there’s also a risk for Netanyahu and his coalition government in tolerating Hizbullah’s access to the border, which gives the group a degree of coercive leverage in its dealings with Israel. Israeli politicians and military officers see the status quo, which has pushed approximately 100,000 Israelis from their homes, as politically and economically unsustainable. The fact that tens of thousands of civilians are unable to return is an embarrassing eye sore for Netanyahu and a daily example of his government’s weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s therefore no surprise that Israel is becoming more aggressive in its rhetoric. Israeli officials have reiterated that they would prefer to remove Hizbullah from Southern Lebanon diplomatically but haven’t ruled out the military option if talks grind to a halt. IDF Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi was blunt when he recently visited troops in the north: “I don’t know when the war in the north is. I can tell you that the likelihood of it happening in the coming months is much higher than it was in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US would be wrong to interpret these words as mere bluster – and to its credit, it hasn’t. President Joe Biden has already talked Netanyahu out of ordering a massive pre-emptive strike against Hizbullah, but the probability of one hasn’t gone away entirely. As repeatedly demonstrated during Israel’s periodic interventions in Lebanon, the military option entails a lot of risks, and the rewards are anything but certain. Just as Israel’s Gaza operation won’t eliminate Hamas completely, an even bigger (and costlier) military operation in Lebanon is even less likely to eliminate Hizbullah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the major players appear to recognise that diplomacy is the most effective way to defuse the Israel–Hizbullah standoff, if not permanently then at least peacefully. The US has spent months trying to mediate a solution, using Lebanese officials as intermediaries to Hizbullah to work out possible formulations. To date, Israel and Hizbullah’s terms remain irreconcilable; the Israelis want Hizbullah to fully implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which requires Hizbullah to pack up and move north of the Litani River. Hizbullah is adamant that no diplomatic resolution is possible until the war in Gaza ends. US attempts to find a middle ground – including a proposal that would compel Hizbullah to withdraw four miles from the border – have been rejected, although Nasrallah has kept the door open to talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Israel and Hizbullah sticking to their positions and showing little willingness to compromise, even the most talented mediator would have trouble crafting a mutually acceptable formula. The US shouldn’t give up on backchannel diplomacy. But it also needs to be brutally realistic about what it can accomplish under the present circumstances. The best strategy, at least for the short term, is conflict management. A full resolution of disputes between these two historical adversaries may not be on the cards right now, but that doesn’t preclude the US, its allies and partners from doing what they can to prevent the flare-ups from escalating further. For the US, this requires talking tough to Israel behind closed doors, making it abundantly clear that Washington doesn’t support a pre-emptive Israeli strike under any circumstances and won’t automatically come to Israel’s defence in the event of one. The US, either directly or through the Europeans, Qatar or Oman, should also press Iran to deliver a similar message to its Hizbullah proxy. Given Iran’s desire to avoid direct participation in a regional war, Tehran might be receptive to such a request.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英冀英文版「打國際線」、若政府打壓或遭譴責甚至制裁&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（20日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第29日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。庭上提及《蘋果》高層於2020年5月開始籌備英文版，陳沛敏憶述黎智英曾提及「如果有美國政治人物訂閱，咁就好喇」，希望英文版能為《蘋果》起到保護作用，當《蘋果》遭受打壓，國際社會都會提供支持，從而向政府施壓，「可能言論上會有譴責，或者採取一啲行動去制裁啦。」群組訊息亦顯示，黎曾表示英文版只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞，做具有深度的報導，「貴精不貴多」；黎又指不需要向外國讀者呈現香港不同政治陣營的觀點，只需要集中在「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」、「黃營的普遍觀點」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方馮睎乾專欄提蘋果要做國際文宣線以增值&quot;&gt;控方：馮睎乾專欄提《蘋果》要做「國際文宣線」以「增值」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第八天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英於2020年5月10日設立群組「English news」，而陳沛敏是群組成員之一。陳確認，並指創立群組之前，黎曾經口頭上講過考慮推行英文新聞，但是沒有詳細說明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示群組訊息，黎稱：「今日馮睎乾提議出英譯新聞電子版諗得過，反正現在翻譯網站翻譯成本低而快。」控方問陳對馮睎乾文章內容有否印象，陳指大概記得馮在專欄文章中指英文新聞只有《南華早報》，而《蘋果日報》都可以做到英文新聞，以「打破當時得一間英文報紙嘅壟斷」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示馮睎乾於2020年5月10日的專欄文章《不撐蘋果的100萬人》，當中一段提到：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;「蘋果救亡似乎只有兩個方向：一是增加訂閱量，吸納那100萬個潛在客戶，二是提供收費較高的訂閱選項，讓某些（不是一刀切加價）現有客戶多付點錢。但無論哪個方向，前提都是蘋果必須『增值』。根據我的網上觀察，以及讀者要求我反映的意見，『增值』主要有兩大方面：一是八卦式公義，二是國際文宣線。」&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏確認蘋果英文版方向是國際文宣線-黎智英冀美國政治人物訂閱&quot;&gt;陳沛敏確認《蘋果》英文版方向是「國際文宣線」 黎智英冀美國政治人物訂閱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，「國際文宣線」是否就是《蘋果》英文新聞的目標？陳回答：「係呢個方向，啫係為咗吸引國際關注香港發生咩事」，在她記憶中，黎曾提及這樣會為《蘋果》起到保護作用，若果國際社會有《蘋果》英文版的讀者，當《蘋果》遭受打壓，國際社會都會提供支持。被問到《蘋果》英文版有否特定國家對象，陳指「我諗譬如美國啦」，黎亦有提及過：「如果有美國政治人物訂閱，咁就好喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，高層一開始討論英文版做法時，她關心的是會否需要使用數頁實體報紙來刊登英文文章，但後來她理解黎似乎認為不需要印在報紙。以陳的理解，因為實體報紙只限於香港本地發行，平均每日約有6至7萬份，很難運送至外國發行，所以黎認為英文版不需要牽涉實體報紙，只需使用《蘋果》網站，可能是揀選一些中文文章來翻譯成英文，之後刊登在網站。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，黎智英經常跟前社長張劍虹表達想揀選哪一類文章來翻譯，同事便會按照張的指示去揀選文章。被問到何以得知黎和張之間有就這方面溝通，陳指有時在群組看到相關訊息，張有時亦會轉達黎的說話，有時跟同事之間食飯，「吐苦水嘅時候又會講吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英冀英文版能做到打國際線效果&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英冀英文版能做到「打國際線」效果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示時任動新聞平台總監張志偉向群組發送的訊息：「老闆，張生，如是要外國讀者主動訂閱，我們英文版的 newsletter ，即我們要做有效的宣傳，reach 到這班讀者，故我們要想好怎宣傳這事。而我們最終目標是打國際線，我建議我們可考慮在美、英主流報章，如 New York Times、Washington Post、英國金融時報等實體報章和網站落廣告，宣傳我們將會做 newsletter 訂閱，令外國讀者知道這事，從而 subscribe 我們 newsletter ，就像連登仔在外國報章登廣告打國際線宣傳一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，「打國際線」是否設立英文版的「最終目標」？陳則指：「我理解黎生係想做到呢個效果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示時任《蘋果》總編輯羅偉光的訊息，他向群組提議，可邀請一些香港年輕人撰寫英文評論，例如曾捲入「世衞風波」的前香港電台記者 Yvonne Tong、身處美國的梁繼平，以及一些打「國際線戰線」的學生和「手足」，「讓這些香港年輕面孔面向世界，直接說香港情況。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏mark-simon較熟悉外國媒體-可協助宣傳英文版&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：Mark Simon較熟悉外國媒體 可協助宣傳英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英又在群組中提及：「我會叫 Mark 先搞好美國方面發放這消息的方法和渠道。」陳沛敏解釋，她估計黎的私人助理 Mark Simon 對外國媒體比較熟悉，因此他可以告訴外國媒體《蘋果》會籌辦英文版，以作宣傳。她表示，有時見到 Mark Simon 接受外國媒體採訪，「由佢去代表黎生回應一啲關於黎生或黎生業務嘅嘢」，所以印象中 Mark Simon 較熟悉外國媒體。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏在群組傳送訊息：「除了翻譯，可否請人直接寫關於香港問題的英文評論。」陳在庭上解釋，她當時認為，既然要出錢聘請人翻譯文章，為何不邀請一些作者以英文撰寫文章。再者，她認為她所負責的實體報紙，讀者對象應該是香港本地人士，但如果英文版的對象是外國讀者的話，黎智英和張劍虹可以考慮為外國讀者度身訂造（tailor-made）而去撰寫一些文章，所以她不認為實體報紙要遷就外國的讀者，包括國際社會、美國公眾和政界人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，後來黎在群組內表示要做多一些中國新聞，因此有負責中國新聞的同事加入群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英曾向mark-simon-表示想彭斯訂閱蘋果英文版&quot;&gt;黎智英曾向Mark Simon 表示想彭斯訂閱《蘋果》英文版&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英於2020年5月10日向Mark Simon傳送訊息：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Mark, Imaging if we can get Mike Pence to subscribe to Apple Daily app! The publicity and respect it command would arouse much support for us. I know it’s almost impossible to pull it off. But can try? Thanks Jimmy”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏解釋，黎認為若果時任美國副總統彭斯都是《蘋果》英文版的讀者的話，會令英文版的知名度提高，「咁喺美國社會都會有好多人支持，以我嘅理解。」若果政府打壓《蘋果》的話，國際社會都會支持《蘋果》，從而向政府施壓，「可能言論上會有譴責，或者採取一啲行動去制裁啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英訊息稱英文版只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞&quot;&gt;黎智英訊息稱英文版只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英在群組中稱，他們不需要報導所有新聞，只需要報導外國人感興趣的重大新聞，做具有深度的報導：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We don’t news (need) all news, only those big enough for foreigners to be interested. That may not be an everyday item. Yes, in depth good quality items. Again the motto is 貴精不貴多！”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，黎所指外國人感興趣的大新聞是什麼意思。陳則認為是一些關於香港社會運動的新聞，不過當時社會運動已經沉寂，她記得後來黎有講過要多報導中國新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英訊息稱尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版即是尋求他們的支持&quot;&gt;黎智英訊息稱尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版即是尋求他們的支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英其後繼續在群組發送訊息，指尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版即是尋求他們的支持：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“By enlisting foreign leaders to subscribe to us is enlisting their support. They of course understand it and that’s why they would do it. Now is a good time to appeal to them when the English version is launched.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳確認，尋求外國政治人物訂閱英文版是其中一個目標，除了外國政治人物之外，黎也希望外國的公眾人士也能訂閱《蘋果》英文版。她理解若果外國政治人物訂閱，會是一種表態，以示支持《蘋果》和黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指不需平衡報導不同陣營觀點-只需報導泛黃觀點&quot;&gt;黎智英指不需平衡報導不同陣營觀點 只需報導泛黃觀點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在群組中表示，不需要向外國讀者呈現不同陣營的觀點，只需要集中在「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」、「黃營的普遍觀點」：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When we choose writers we don’t have to think about giving foreigners a balanced view of what happens here of every different colors, we only concentrate in our Apple Daily HK view, a general view of the yellow side. In choosing further writers we need not choose Weijian Shan, who’s a friend of mine and a very popular writer about China in the west. But his view is all China on the positive side we don’t need. We are not trying to strike a balance but the point of view of the people on the side of protecting HK. This is the voice the world wants to know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問何謂「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」，陳回答指，根據黎的演譯，就是「偏黃陣營的觀點」。控方續問，《蘋果》有否實行到黎所說的集中在「《蘋果日報》的香港觀點」，陳表示：「我相信有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問《蘋果》是否實行到黎所說不需要平衡報導，陳表示：「似乎係囉。」控方追問，《蘋果》英文版報導中央政府新聞時，會採取什麼角度，陳則指：「會係對中國比較批判啲嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英想英文版報導中美關係中國與國際之間互動&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英想英文版報導中美關係、中國與國際之間互動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，後來前《蘋果》主筆馮偉光被選做英文版的總編輯，應該是由他按照黎智英的準則去揀選文章來翻譯成英文。相關準則包括著重有關中國的新聞，或者「一啲佢（黎）覺得外國讀者會關注，啫唔係咁香港本地嘅嘢囉」，至於文章角度，「我諗都係有批判性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到有什麼「唔係咁香港本地」的新聞例子，陳舉例指當年《蘋果》大篇幅報導沙中線醜聞，雖然獲得獎項，但是這不是黎認為能夠吸引國際關注的新聞。她理解黎想英文版報導中美關係、中國與國際之間互動，以及牽引到國際社會要關心的議題，而且正如黎早前提及要報導「偏黃」觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏蘋果比較支持和諒解示威者的處境-因普選訴求符合黎智英取態&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：《蘋果》比較支持和諒解示威者的處境 因普選訴求符合黎智英取態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示前動新聞平台總監張志偉的訊息：「老闆，張生，我想有一方法去打國際線，出我們的蘋果英文版內容，就是利用現成的 patreon 平台，代替我們自己去 send 出 newsletter 」，張又指：「因我們今次打國際線，目的是發揮香港《蘋果日報》在外國的影響力和話語權，訂閱人頭和收入同樣重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，《蘋果》只是一份報紙，為何會涉及「打國際線」？陳則認為張志偉僅使用了社運人士所使用的字眼，但她不能代張解讀原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問《蘋果》有否參與「打國際線」，若有的話，會是以什麼形式參與。陳表示：「我諗我唔會用『參與』」，不過當時《蘋果》的態度「會係比較支持和諒解示威者的處境，立場係比較支持佢哋嘅訴求」，例如有訴求提到普選，而這符合黎一向支持民主的取態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問為何《蘋果》比較支持示威者。陳指，除了上述提及示威者部份訴求符合黎的立場之外，在七一佔領立法會事件之後，黎想《蘋果》報導示威者心聲，「佢嗰時都直接講個動機係運動可以持續落去，我估係以咁嘅方式去支持？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當示威者談及「國際線」時，意思是想國際人士關注香港情況，若果得到外國支持，運動會有較大成功機會，「如果佢哋（示威者）受到鎮壓，國際社會會出聲呀咁。」她理解這種「國際支持」，與黎開頭籌辦英文版時，提及想得到外國的支持和得到保護，「我理解個邏輯係一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英不贊成用patreon-並指美國政治人物訂閱對政治庇護更重要&quot;&gt;黎智英不贊成用Patreon 並指美國政治人物訂閱對政治庇護更重要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年5月12日的群組訊息，黎智英回應張志偉的 Patreon 提議，稱：「Patreon 的問題是與蘋果日報隔離，我們主要目的是外國人撐蘋果日報，尤其美國政治人物訂閱蘋果對我們的政治庇護更重要，我仍然認為英文版有需要設在我們 app 內。而設 app 內時間不用太久。等回來我處談談。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏確認記憶中《蘋果》最終沒有使用 Patreon 來發布英文版文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英提議翻譯桑普林本利和李兆富文章&quot;&gt;黎智英提議翻譯桑普、林本利和李兆富文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前社長張劍虹曾在群組中表示：「林本利我們可以翻譯他的社評」、「楊社長介紹 Steve Vines、Michael Chugani 和一個叫 Albert Wun 的美籍華人」，其後黎智英表示：「以上可加桑普、林本利和 Simon Lee。Mark Simon and Mark Clifford 也認識一些本地住寫英文的 KOL 給我們寫。每天平均有兩篇英文稿就差不多了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏表示記得 Steve Vines 曾在英文報紙工作過，亦有寫過一些評論文章；Michael Chugani （禇簡寧）亦有在英文報紙工作過，其後在電台擔任主持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及桑普文章的角度，陳指「都係對政府比較有批判性」。林本利則是經濟學家，比較多寫經濟分析。至於 Simon Lee 即是李兆富，陳形容他「好崇尚市場經濟，反對政府干預，覺得要由私人市場去做」，即是崇尚「大市場，小政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏憶述被捕後-同事擔心公司會否倒閉或更多人被捕&quot;&gt;陳沛敏憶述被捕後 同事擔心公司會否倒閉或更多人被捕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎訊息中提及的 Mark Clifford 是壹傳媒集團的非執行董事。陳確認，但她表示當時並未留意 Mark Clifford。她憶述，當年一些董事被警方拘捕之後，會計部很徬徨，如果他們不獲准保釋，便未能簽署支票出稿費，後來公司找黎智英和張劍虹委任她自己和羅偉光，「到時有咩事都可以簽支票」，但陳被委任之後，記憶中董事局便沒有再開過會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，她不是因為獲委任為董事而知道 Mark Clifford 這個人，而是因為在報紙上看到宣傳黎智英 Live Chat 節目的全版廣告，當中顯示 Mark Clifford 會出席節目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳略顯激動地提到，最深印象是她在2021年6月17日被捕之後，獲得警方擔保出來時，因為公司財產被凍結，同事都擔心公司會否倒閉，若果倒閉會否賠償到欠薪和遣散費，或者擔心會否再有其他同事被捕。而她當時已向公司辭職，「我係咪可以代表同事問董事局，《蘋果日報》係咪應該結束呢？」陳表示：「我嘅意見係要結束啦」，因為當有同事問她「我哋繼續做落去，會唔會畀人拉？當同事咁問我，我做唔到呢個擔保」，因要詢問董事局。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官此時打斷，指這是後來發生的事件，希望按目前時序來作供，待稍後談到2021年6月時才詳細交代。陳回應，她交代上述事件，目的是想講「去到2021年嗰個位，我先知道 Mark Clifford。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏馮偉光曾做英語媒體-是主理英文版適合人選&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：馮偉光曾做英語媒體 是主理英文版適合人選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示群組訊息，黎智英表示：「我想 English news 我們需要一個人主理，例如挖大陸任志強等先進人士寫的文章翻譯，或將『方方日記』的精髓每天翻譯一小段作為花絮等，不斷為英文版構思些做法令其姿態生動是必須的。劍虹、沛敏和偉光請你們商量選一個人出來主理。這人可以是外面的人，總之對大陸和本港熟悉和英文好，一般學識水平高便可。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏指，英文版最後由馮偉光主理，因他長期替《蘋果》撰寫社論，知道《蘋果》的風格，又有在英語媒體工作的經驗，所以是適合的人選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏憶述黎智英稱當蘋果英文版與南早不同便能引人訂閱&quot;&gt;陳沛敏憶述黎智英稱當《蘋果》英文版與《南早》不同便能引人訂閱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指訊息紀錄顯示，陳在2020年5月13日收到一條語音訊息，而她其後回覆「收到，已聽」。陳確認該語音訊息是一次會議的錄音，由於她沒有出席該次會議，所以同事事後傳送會議錄音給她。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上閱畢錄音謄本之後，控方問她會否記得黎想要哪一種中國新聞。陳指黎提到內地維權新聞，而香港新聞則想繼續關注警暴、自由民主等議題。她稱記得黎講過，「（當《蘋果》）變咗同《南華早報》好唔同嘅時候，啲人就會訂閱《蘋果日報》喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/x7xrLLT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（8日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第26日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方在黎智英的手機中發現一張佩洛西的 Twitter 截圖，當中附有黎、李柱銘和佩洛西的合照；控方另在黎的手機發現一張照片，是美國審議《香港人權與民主法案》前夕，共和黨議員克魯茲（Ted Cruz）訪港期間，他與黎智英、前政務司司長陳方安生、前立法會資訊科技界議員莫乃光和前立法會法律界議員郭榮鏗的合照。另外，庭上談及2019年9月出版的特刊《2019年自由之夏》，陳沛敏指由於首次出版便沽清，《蘋果》其後加印第二版，以及推出英文版，而且扣除收入所得收益會捐給612人道支援基金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英赴美會見議員後-個人專欄解答問題-蘋果亦有報導&quot;&gt;黎智英赴美會見議員後 個人專欄解答問題 《蘋果》亦有報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第五天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨天審訊提到黎智英於2019年10月赴美國會見參議員之後，要求陳沛敏構思約10條問題問他，以供他解答作為專欄題目。陳供稱她當時與同事構思了一些問題，包括「由最基本問起，例如點解要去」，「佢（黎）應該寫完之後，就 pass 畀 Ophe（同事）」，陳相信文章最終有刊登。她另確認，事後並沒有派記者去訪問黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英專欄文章〈美國人想對我們說的話〉，刊於2019年10月27日副刊E3版。黎在文章開首說：「這幾天身在美國，難以抽身撰寫專欄，公司手足反問我是否可解答一些疑問，造就以下答問。」陳確認文章中的問題與她交給黎的問題相似。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，文章共有九條問答，其中一條問題是「示威暴力升級，美國政界對香港抗爭看法有轉變嗎？」，問陳當時為何想到此問題。陳指因為當時有些美國議員關注示威暴力。控方續問為何會認為黎有能力回答此問題，陳表示：「因為佢一路都係對呢啲問題有睇法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一條問題是：「《香港人權與民主法案》通過後是否真的可以制裁黑警、葉劉、何君堯？」控方問陳為何有此問題。陳則指因為當時美國正在醞釀《香港人權與民主法案》，而「黑警、葉劉、何君堯」是示威者及其支持者曾提及過的制裁對象，但美國支持示威者的輿論會問：「係咪呢啲人都要負上責任呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了黎的專欄文章之外，陳記得《蘋果》亦有報導黎的訪美之行。控方遂展示2019年10月23日《蘋果》實體報紙報導〈黎智英冀美議員向港府施壓〉，當中載有時任美國眾議院議長佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）與黎智英和民主黨元老李柱銘的合照。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美國審議香港人權與民主法案前夕-共和黨議員訪港-黎智英陳方安生等人會面&quot;&gt;美國審議《香港人權與民主法案》前夕 共和黨議員訪港 黎智英陳方安生等人會面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示一張在黎手機檢取的圖片，乃2019年10月23日由 Mark Simon 傳送給黎，為佩洛西的 Twitter 截圖，顯示佩洛西與黎和李的合照。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So pleased to welcome Jimmy Lai, Martin Lee and Janet Pang to the U.S. Capitol. My full support and admiration goes to those who have taken to the streets week after week in non-violent protest to fight for democracy and the rule of law in #HongKong. pic.twitter.com/maeTwTR8eV — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) October 22, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示一張由前公民黨立法會法律界議員郭榮鏗於10月13日傳送給黎的相片，相中人包括黎智英、美國共和黨參議員克魯茲（Ted Cruz）、前政務司司長陳方安生、前立法會資訊科技界議員莫乃光和郭榮鏗，地點為香港會所（The Hong Kong Club）。法庭傳譯員翻譯「Dennis Kwok」時，一度錯誤譯為郭家麒，控方聽罷指正。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，《蘋果日報》於2019年10月13日報導克魯茲訪港，題為〈美議員轟林鄭撤會面軟弱〉，報紙頁面上方寫有「訪港力撐」，文章提及上述5人會面，當時為美國審議《香港人權與民主法案》前夕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月28日，《蘋果》手機程式發出一則推播通知（push notification），報導題為〈【人權法】特朗普動筆簽署 《香港人權民主法》生效〉。控方問這是否一宗「大新聞」，所以要發出推播通知。陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏應黎智英要求處理羅傑斯給示威者的公開信&quot;&gt;陳沛敏應黎智英要求處理羅傑斯給示威者的公開信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月18日，黎智英把「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）的公開信「AN OPEN LETTER TO DETAINEES AND PROTESTORS IN HONG KONG」傳送給陳沛敏，問她能否刊登或報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，她當時應該有將相關公開信交給網上新聞的同事處理，不過後來《蘋果》沒有全文刊登，而是將它夾雜在其他新聞之中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指該段時間香港有很多人被捕，羅傑斯希望就此作出回應，而「佢嘅訊息符合我哋一路以嚟嘅報導」，因此把公開信轉交給同事跟進。控方問這是否與黎有關，陳指有關，「咁黎生叫我刊登，我咪問同事趕唔趕得切刊登。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月27日，黎智英的專欄「成敗樂一笑」刊出文章〈我們堅持下去，才有希望〉。控方特別指出其中數句：「我們逆權運動雖然傷亡慘重，我們卻阻擋了送中惡法，團結香港人萬眾一心保護家園的決心，獲得了以美國為首的自由世界國家和人民的支持，美國政府通過《香港人權與民主法案》，和最近壓倒性的區議會選舉勝利，只要我們堅持不灰心，最後贏回《基本法》賦予我們普選的權利，絕對有可能。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2020年1月蘋果送逆權月曆&quot;&gt;2020年1月《蘋果》送「逆權月曆」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年1月1日的《蘋果》頭版，標題為：〈踏入2020市民高呼 光復香港〉，右上方寫有「明日再送 逆權月曆」。陳稱《蘋果》以往從未附送日曆，該次是首次。控方特別指出新聞圖片中有人展示「光復香港 時代革命」旗幟。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月2日的《蘋果》則以〈103萬人遊行 入夜警狂拉400人 香港人，戰鬥！〉作為標題。控方問陳，誰人會戰鬥？且他們為了什麼而戰鬥？陳回答：「呢個係示威遊行有人嗌嘅口號」，為了爭取他們提及的「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月13日，陳沛敏向主筆楊清奇傳送「飯盒會」會議紀錄截圖，當中提及「週末評論版可嘗試找端、立場、眾的一些寫得好的作者撰稿」，陳並問楊：「清奇，可否請你或 Jason 整理一下近月加入的作者陣容告訴我？因後天我們有飯盒會。」陳庭上解釋，因她當時不太掌握報紙論壇版有哪些作者，想與上述網媒作者陣容作比較，以看看兩者是否有分別。而 Jason 是楊的同事，當楊休假時會代為打理報紙論壇版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果出版特刊2019年自由之夏-陳沛敏稱當時賣斷市-張劍虹同意加印&quot;&gt;《蘋果》出版特刊《2019年自由之夏》 陳沛敏稱當時賣斷市 張劍虹同意加印&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指《蘋果》在2019年9月出版特刊《2019年自由之夏》，中文版於2019年9月20日出版，於9月27日再次出版，而英文版「FREEDOM SUMMER」則於同年10月9日出版。其中只有英文版和9月27日中文版的封面有標註價錢是10元，並聲稱扣除成本之後，淨收入會捐給「612人道支援基金」，至於9月20日的中文版則沒有標註價錢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，當時刊物出版後，有好多人買，「應該賣晒，斷咗市」，讀者要求《蘋果》加印，高層得悉讀者聲音之後，在社長張劍虹的同意下加印。控方追問，陳提及的高層是否包括黎智英？陳表示不肯定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中一頁寫「11.24 血債票償」，陳確認是關於區議會選舉。刊物內附有「抗爭日程大事記」，列出6月9日至9月16日之間的事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏對沙田新城市衝突相片印象深刻&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：對沙田新城市衝突相片印象深刻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及其中一張新聞圖片，拍攝到7月14日沙田新城市廣場警民衝突情況，當天發生暴動及有警員被咬傷手指。陳指這照片並非由《蘋果》記者拍攝，而是從相片源頭購買或者借用。她表示對相片印象深刻，「因為呢張相對於我嚟講，係幾出色嘅作品，唔係好大路咁影示威者同警察爭執」，而是拍攝到黑衣人士之間有一名紅衣女子拿著購物袋。控方問她有否要求同事將相片納入特刊，陳僅表示：「記憶中我有（向同事）提過我覺得呢張相影得好好。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 陳沛敏表示對相片印象深刻，「因為呢張相對於我嚟講，係幾出色嘅作品，唔係好大路咁影示威者同警察爭執」，惟不是由《蘋果》記者拍攝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另提到一張新聞圖片中，集會人士手持黃色「反送中」長幡。陳稱：「我記得張劍虹先生好似應黎智英先生嘅要求，寫過一啲大嘅毛筆字啦，好似就係呢啲」，待張寫好毛筆字，之後黎便安排印刷事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指其中一頁描繪示威者的全版畫作，其後被《蘋果》用來印製海報，於2019年10月1日出版，並問陳是隨報附送還是在街上免費派發。陳則相信是以類似在報紙其中一頁全版印刷尊子政治漫畫的方式。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指英文版特刊有一頁載有紐約聲援香港人士的照片，標註「G20 Stand with Hong Kong」，惟中文版卻不見這一頁，問這是誰的主意。陳則稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件編號：HCCC51/2022&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>獨媒報導</name></author><summary type="html">2019年9月出特刊《自由之夏》收益捐612基金 陳沛敏：首版沽清需加印</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://i.imgur.com/LciFH41.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://i.imgur.com/LciFH41.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Assess Autonomous Weapons</title><link href="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2024-02-08-assess-autonomous-weapons.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Assess Autonomous Weapons" /><published>2024-02-08T12:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2024-02-08T12:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/assess-autonomous-weapons</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://agorahub.github.io/pen0/hkers/2024-02-08-assess-autonomous-weapons.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The proliferation of lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) is inevitable, given the availability of the underpinning technology and the benefits that such systems bring to some users.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;LAWS will cause problems for armed forces, but the absence of an agreed definition complicates attempts to regulate and control their proliferation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAWS are not a single capability. Hence, this paper considers the risks associated with LAWS based on the likelihood and impact of their proliferation in relation to three broad categories: minimum viable product (MVP); military off the shelf (MOTS); and boutique. The sophistication of these systems differs significantly, as do the risks each pose and the demands they place on users, all of which has an impact on the proliferation risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MVP LAWS involve homemade and commercially specified and available technologies. The software, hardware and expertise necessary to develop a minimally functioning LAWS are widely available and within the reach of non-state actors if they see benefit in its adoption. These weapons represent the biggest risk of proliferation, especially in relation to non-state actors, but they are often fragile and, considered individually, are not game-changing (in terms of impact) for modern militaries. However, even relatively simple systems used at scale can still cause problems for Western militaries, who often lack mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOTS have high degrees of autonomy and are proliferating rapidly to anyone with sufficient funds, including non-state actors. However, while many are offensive capabilities, they also include defensive systems, such as air defence weapons that are often autonomous but not offensive. The risk posed by MOTS LAWS is arguably limited by affordability, but there may be clear advantages to adoption, including enabling battlefield mass. MOTS proliferation is highly likely, and military advances in autonomy are more a matter of will and ethics than of technological hurdles. So, while the likelihood of proliferation is high (if slightly lower than for MVPs), the impact is higher, especially if the systems can be used at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boutique LAWS are exquisite capabilities being developed by a select few countries. They are very expensive complex systems designed for specific effects against well-identified threats, such as a specific element of an opponent’s strategic defensive network or deterrence capabilities, and as such are the most destabilising (high impact). Their adoption advantage is high, but the cost of developing and maintaining them means proliferation is currently unlikely beyond the wealthiest states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adoption advantage is needed for LAWS to proliferate and, in many areas, such as the MVP and MOTS paradigms, advanced conventional capabilities still have an edge over LAWs, although this may change. As the technology underpinning LAWS matures and becomes proven, proliferation risks will increase. Militaries have the opportunity, and arguably the responsibility, to lead the conversation about proliferation and shape its outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 14 September 2019, 25 drones and missiles in two waves damaged the Abqaiq and Khurais oil-processing facilities in Saudi Arabia, evading the advanced air defence systems guarding them. This was not the first attack on the Abqaiq facility. In 2006, Al-Qa’ida had used humans and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED), but the assailants were discovered by guards and killed, and the facility was not damaged. The two attacks, 13 years apart, highlight the pace at which technology has evolved, and how easily it can be wielded against states that previously enjoyed technological supremacy. The 2019 attacks were reportedly facilitated, and possibly launched, by Iranian forces using weapons developed for asymmetrically challenging regional opponents. Nonetheless, capabilities that were previously the preserve of nation states have proliferated to non-state actors, allowing them to attack cargo ships, airports and armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-state actors have demonstrated a willingness to adopt new and unproven technologies to create asymmetric advantage against more powerful opponents. In 2016, Islamic State (IS) forces in Mosul used UAVs to coordinate attacks against Iraqi forces using VBIEDs and mortars. Small states also appear willing to employ relatively untested technologies, such as loitering munitions and armed UAVs, to achieve their military goals. For example, in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Azeri forces deployed loitering munitions and UAVs to prepare for conventional combined arms assaults. Forces unable to access more sophisticated capabilities offered by Western militaries may look to increase the level of autonomy of their weapons to offset the extensive targeting and strike capabilities facing them. This poses risks that need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper considers the risks of proliferation of lethal autonomous weapons (LAWS) for military organisations. Smaller, less powerful states, and non-state actors, represent a high proliferation risk via a minimum viable product (MVP) paradigm using LAWS that are rudimentary, but whose impact is medium. Military off-the-shelf (MOTS) products – ready-made weapons systems with varying degrees of autonomy – also present a proliferation risk and greater impact challenges, as they are more capable. Exquisite, or boutique, LAWS capabilities – such as the US Air Force’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft – have a lower likelihood of proliferation because of the cost, very high impact risk they carry, and the sophistication of the systems and organisations needed to operate them effectively. Consequently, boutique LAWs are only briefly covered here, but they are extensively addressed elsewhere, for example in Paul Scharre’s Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper, aimed primarily at practitioners and policymakers rather than academic audiences, assesses the likely risks to Western military organisations posed by the proliferation of different types of LAWS. It relies on a review of secondary sources supplemented by interviews with leading experts. A literature review was conducted between August 2022 and April 2023 to assess the technological, regulatory and military drivers affecting the proliferation of LAWS. The review engaged widely with policy documents from NATO, the UK government and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), research documents from industry and civil society organisations, and national and international legal frameworks regulating LAWS use and development. Non-traditional sources were used (for example, blogs, YouTube) to investigate non-state developments, such as those created by lone actors. The literature review was supported by interviews with three leading experts to frame the challenges and enable further research through specialised defence media publications and academic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is comprised of five chapters. Chapter I establishes a definition of LAWS and outlines the current regulatory frameworks. Chapter II introduces MVP LAWS, and Chapter III covers some existing MOTS LAWS. Chapters IV and V examine currently available boutique LAWS and consider constraints on proliferation arising from within user organisations and thus the overall proliferation risk. The conclusion reiterates the risks facing Western militaries from LAWS and urges them to engage in shaping the environment through policy debates and in developing counter-LAWS capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-understanding-laws&quot;&gt;I. Understanding LAWS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of autonomy, especially involving LAWS, is complex and contested. Even obtaining clarity on a definition is challenging, because LAWS are systems comprising many elements, rather than a specific capability that can be neatly bounded. This paper adopts the ICRC “position” on LAWS, in which LAWS are systems built and programmed using software to “select and apply force to targets without human intervention” once deployed. These systems may or may not employ AI-enabled software to complete their mission or determine the best course of action. This definition is admittedly minimal, because it does not necessitate a capacity for automated target discrimination. However, as this paper specifically explores proliferation risks, the definition is sufficient for considering current systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many types of lethal weapons in service that employ some form of autonomy, and that number is growing. Such systems incorporate aspects of autonomy that include navigation, targeting, lethal weapons release or a combination of these, but in policy terms, many Western militaries seek to apply “meaningful human control” to decisions to release weapons; that is, they commit to maintaining a human in the kill chain who must approve the use of the lethal weapon. It is currently less common that LAWS are able or permitted to select their own targets based on neural networks, for example. Systems such as the Israeli Harpy loitering munition that attacks radar systems matching its target catalogue, or the Russian Lancet system, which is widely used in Ukraine and reputedly has similar characteristics or functions, although this is uncertain, rely on software that is hard-coded. So, even though the program that enables this is a form of AI that conducts operations that would typically require a human brain, it does so based on software that is predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section considers the military interest in LAWS and some of the challenges of adoption, and then considers the policy framework within which the debate about LAWS is conducted, with a brief examination of the twin-track approach to a mix of prohibition and control currently being adopted by parts of the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-interest-in-laws&quot;&gt;Military Interest in LAWS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomy plays a part in many systems that ultimately deliver lethal effect, covering the data gathering to improve the accuracy and speed of targeting, through to the weapons, such as missiles or “smart” mines, that are then deployed to destroy or kill targets. Inevitably, there are risks with this, such as error in target selection, but autonomy and remotely operated systems offer militaries (and non-state actors) benefits in terms of the efficiency and effectiveness of lethality. They potentially allow for increases in battlefield mass and reduce costs – human and financial – by taking people out of the system and allowing one human to manage multiple effectors. This offers the prospect of increased mass and lethality from smaller forces, which might also help Western militaries respond to the societal, technological and political factors driving smaller armed forces. Autonomy might also reduce casualties for the side deploying such weapons by distancing them from the battlefield, even if it does not lower the total number of casualties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential benefits of LAWS, the mere existence of the technology is insufficient to drive proliferation, which is also impacted by factors such as organisational and technological system design and challenges of effective integration. The impetus for proliferation requires factors to combine and create value in adoption. This “adoption advantage” is unique to each entity. Militaries generally have a high adoption threshold because, to varying degrees, their conventional capabilities are extensive, and they have the structures and processes to support the use of these capabilities. However, funding and power structures play a part in proliferation. The influence of regional commanders, instead of there being an overarching strategy of adoption, allegedly led to haphazard procurement of armed drones in the Saudi Arabian military. Similar stovepipes exist within other militaries, and could both lead to the rapid introduction of LAWS and hamper its effective integration into wider force design. For example, Iraq’s LAWS procurement is believed to be shaped by individuals affiliated with Iran who are also trying to reduce reliance on Western arms, for whom the adoption advantage may be less about the capabilities than about the geopolitics. But institutional barriers can raise the level required for adoption advantage in military bureaucracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-state actors may have lower thresholds for adoption, especially if subjected to survival pressures by larger, well-equipped conventional militaries. State and non-state militaries are shaped very rapidly during conflict. The constant pressure of combat (losses, successes and failures) drives adaptation from the top of an organisation to the bottom, as well as from the bottom up. However, in non-state organisations, an absence of the procedures and structures typically found in militaries drives a different kind of innovation that may shape the proliferation of LAWS. Even large, seemingly homogeneous, organisations such as IS – which at one point claimed to have 31,500 fighters – comprise many smaller organisations technically working together, but often pursuing their own aims according to the local context. Thus, proliferation may be haphazard, and result in the technology’s opportunities being less well exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption advantage of LAWS is not absolute. Swarms of drones may be more lethal than a single drone but may not be more effective than an artillery barrage or precision strike by long-range missiles, both of which already exist in military inventories and are integrated into doctrine and tactics. Furthermore, humans still have an edge in some areas; LAWS will struggle to replace humans in counterinsurgency roles, or verify aircraft entering a country’s airspace. So, humans are likely to be better, albeit slower, combatants than LAWS in some circumstances, and current LAWS are typically better at augmenting capabilities within narrow confines, freeing humans to do other things. Nonetheless, the fact that autonomous weapons can be produced using dual-use technology, and their prevalence on the international market (both legitimate and black markets), suggests that autonomous weapons will be used by more states in the next decade. Furthermore, the war in Ukraine could accelerate this proliferation, whereby sophisticated technologies are captured and made available for reverse engineering by states or criminal actors with fewer controls on autonomous modes, their use or sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In peacetime, the drivers and character of military innovation and adaptation are less settled. Theo Farrell argues that militaries are bound by rationality and routine – more prone to exploiting existing structures, processes and technologies than to exploring new ones. Peacetime innovation within armed forces is, therefore, difficult, often driven by perceived changes in a state’s environment, as well as hypotheses about the changing technological landscape. This is likely to impact on the large-scale adoption of LAWS in many militaries. A rare example of radical peacetime innovation is the US Marine Corps’ (USMC) “Force Design 2030”, which moves the Corps from heavy land warfare capabilities to a lighter, multi-role littoral force supporting the US Navy. Under this programme, the USMC divested itself of $16 billion of proven (non-autonomous) platforms, such as the M1 Abrams main battle tank, to invest in new technologies, for example, long-range anti-ship missiles, and adopted new doctrine and concepts of operations to deter and compete with China. The move represents considerable organisational risk to the USMC, and may compromise its ability to fight conventional land wars, but has been justified against the potential risks to US security, especially in the Indo-Pacific. However, experience suggests that peacetime innovation that requires significant change in doctrine, tactics or technological capabilities will likely be radical and require enterprise-wide reform and, as such, is often resisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-framework&quot;&gt;Policy Framework&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the tactical and operational arguments for the adoption of LAWS, there are concerns about proliferation, and the debate around the potential impact of LAWS has reached the UN. The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) seeks to “ban or restrict the use of specific types of weapons that are considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to combatants or to affect civilians indiscriminately” and has been ratified by 126 states. However, decisions are made by consensus, achieved through “the absence of objection rather than a particular majority”, giving individual states the power to veto proposals made. In 2016, a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on LAWS was formed to convene military, legal, technological and diplomatic experts from the state parties, international institutions, NGOs, academia and other parts of civil society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CCW framework has three themes around autonomous weapons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The necessity for international regulation governing the development of LAWS: 90 of the 126 states currently support a legally binding instrument with both prohibition and regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How human–machine interaction will and will not inform the use of LAWS, and where human control should be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How autonomous systems are defined and interpreted, their role within society and their use in warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GGE has also adopted 11 guiding principles for responsible state behaviour around LAWS, although attempts to regulate LAWS have been hindered by the inability to agree a definition of them. Consequently, consensus-based decision-making in the near future is challenging, “if not impossible”. Individual countries can determine their own parameters for LAWS use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government, in an annex on LAWS in its Defence Artificial Intelligence Strategy, argued for “context-appropriate human involvement”. What “appropriate” meant was not specified, so while the Strategy is positive in terms of Britain’s potential to lead development of an international status quo for LAWS, the lack of clarity is similar to concerns expressed about ambiguity in other policy positions on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, in the largest cross-regional statement in any UN discussions on the topic, 70 states in the UN General Assembly issued a joint statement on LAWS. The statement acknowledged serious humanitarian, legal, security, technological and ethical concerns surrounding the use of LAWS, and the need to assure structures for human accountability regarding the use of force. There was a particular emphasis on the need for internationally agreed rules, with a combination of prohibitions and regulations to limit the uses of LAWS seen as more realistic than a blanket restriction, given the lack of a clear definition of the systems under discussion. Reflecting this, a joint call to develop, by 2026, a legally binding instrument setting clear prohibitions and restrictions on autonomous weapons was made by the UN secretary-general and the president of the ICRC in October 2023. This was followed by the General Assembly approving a resolution on regulating autonomous systems, which was supported by 164 states, including several major military powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulation-to-control-proliferation&quot;&gt;Regulation to Control Proliferation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An outright ban on LAWS remains unlikely, given the definitional challenges, scope for dual-use technologies, breadth of LAWS applications and the potential strategic advantages for armed forces. However, regulating specific uses or consequences of using LAWS and building on existing law is plausible, and may be desirable, given the potential of LAWS to create instability. Militaries are potentially well placed to lead this, because they own their targeting cycles and can dictate what is and is not acceptable or responsible as a part of them. They could, therefore, use their influence through requirement setting to shape the international debate on LAWS regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procurement and use of autonomous systems are always subject to human decision-making; a human decided to buy and deploy the weapon. Such decisions are typically made at strategic or operational command levels in Western armed forces with legal advice, although not all users will take the same approach. Commanders will, broadly, understand the parameters of LAWS within the context of international humanitarian law, which will inform their use. Although commanders may not understand the details and complexities of specific algorithms, their position within the military organisation guarantees a level of accountability under existing legal frameworks designed to prevent negative effects for civilians and personnel. Militaries can regulate the use of LAWS further through the training of decision-making in ways that minimise unpredictability in their use and maintenance. Even where knowledge gaps exist within a military, someone can be held directly responsible for their use. This remains true regardless of the level of autonomy or the unpredictability of any given LAWS. However, clear chains of accountability do not completely eliminate the risk of unpredictability in technology or humans, nor the risks presented by independent systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Independence” raises important questions of specificity. LAWS will do what they have been programmed to do. Simple systems may be able to launch a strike in response to a specific stimulus – for example, a suspicious aircraft moving at high velocity within national territory. More complex systems may be programmed to self-teach using ever-expanding datasets, and have greater freedom to decide for themselves how to respond to less predefined situations. Either system could operate with or without human oversight, and both could deliver lethal or non-lethal operational advantage. The spectrum of possibilities, uses and effects associated with LAWS is already broad enough to limit the ability to prohibit LAWS, and this breadth must inform attempts to regulate their use. The specific uses of LAWS and consequences of their use will, therefore, drive attempts at regulation. This specificity will also help to mitigate the complexities of debates over the role of the human, assuming there is human interaction beyond initial deployment, and could help improve the definition of LAWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the armed forces can satisfy themselves that they have taken adequate steps to consider any potential effects on civilians and have determined the outcome as necessary to achieve a strategic aim, the use of LAWS may not fall beyond the boundaries of international humanitarian law or the Geneva Conventions – regardless of the level of human interaction. These factors mean that attempts at regulation are more likely to succeed by focusing on specific outcomes rather than on the role of the human, although this remains a difficult area to navigate, and friction remains over when and how regulation should apply. In the GGE in 2023, the UK, Ireland, Norway and Switzerland, among others, promoted examination of common characteristics and effects, with flexibility to reflect the rapid pace of technological change. The US differed, proposing a focus on the objective nature of the weapons system rather than its use, but fell short of calling for international law. India, Israel and Russia explicitly stated they would not agree to a legal instrument. This block to progress is unlikely to be lifted soon, but the shift towards regulating LAWS in specific contexts could provide space to explore how existing international humanitarian law applies to specific scenarios where different types of LAWS might be used, to test the suitability of existing legislation. Such an approach could constrain the proliferation of LAWS – albeit within narrower confines than originally hoped for by many of the parties to the CCW – and is perhaps realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-minimum-viable-product-laws&quot;&gt;II. Minimum Viable Product LAWS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate around LAWS is implicitly split between the exquisite capabilities under development by the US, China and other major powers, and less advanced systems that have been, or might be, developed by non-state actors, defence manufacturers or militaries with limited budgets. LAWS manufactured by responsible defence companies are typically designed to comply with the laws of armed conflict and are subject to rigorous testing before entering service – although this itself is technically demanding. This is less true of MVP LAWS that use non-military grade components – where the technical, intellectual and financial bar for entry is low – including commercial off-the-shelf and dual-use technology, open source software and even detailed instructions for how to build non-lethal capabilities, such as autonomous sentry paintball guns, or hobby drones adapted for more dangerous uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;individual-mvp-use&quot;&gt;Individual MVP Use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of expertise for MVP LAWS need not be that high. Image-recognition-based targeting capabilities can legitimately be developed for commercial purposes by individuals using open source software and commercial components. For example, individuals have created “smart cat flaps” for their homes using image recognition software that detects when cats are carrying prey and keeps the cat flap locked. One used YOLO, an object recognition algorithm that classifies objects using training images, while another learned to code specifically for the purpose, indicating that no prior expertise is needed. It follows that suitably motivated combatants could adopt this dual-use image recognition technology for LAWS, for example using open source, pre-trained neural networks against an occupying force’s vehicles and personnel. For example, given the length of NATO’s deployment to Afghanistan, or the ongoing conflicts in Libya, Syria and Ukraine, which involve consistent terrain, vehicle types and uniforms, such forces would be vulnerable to relatively simple MVP LAWS. IS in Mosul, for example, would only need a program capable of recognising the M1A1 Abrams and T-72 tanks sold to Iraq – a relatively straightforward task when they were the only tanks in the city. Consequently, narrowly defined operational scenarios in which Western forces often find themselves could allow adversaries to deploy MVP LAWS against them using readily available autonomous target recognition and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cat flaps mentioned above were developed using software already available from experts. This differentiates the risks of LAWS proliferation from other proliferation risks: nuclear scientists capable of building and developing a nuclear weapon are rarer than computer programmers, and the engineering challenge is significantly greater for nuclear capabilities. Already happening in Ukraine, it is reasonable to presume that in future conflicts there is scope for programmers to become involved and develop autonomous weapons or technologies based on experience gained in the commercial sector. This vector has precedent. In 1995, Japanese cult terrorist group Aum Shinrikyo released a sarin gas nerve agent on the Tokyo subway, killing 12 people and injuring 5,000 more. One member of the group, Masami Tsuchiya, held a Master’s degree in chemistry and developed a working sarin gas from library books and his university education. Increasing production of the gas led to a reduction in the product’s purity, but it was nonetheless capable of causing extensive harm when released. Aum Shinrikyo also funded and ran a biological weapons programme, which was less effective than its chemical weapons programme, but the group’s success in developing these weapons, while limited, demonstrates what can happen when those with the right knowledge turn their hand to nefarious activity. There are clear parallels with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MVP LAWS, including commercially available civilian autonomous platforms, are accessible by individuals, non-state actors and states facing larger, more powerful armed forces. They are, however, fragile, and are likely to be the resort of weaker powers against stronger ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;armed-forces-mvp-use&quot;&gt;Armed Forces’ MVP Use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, Ukraine has employed hobby drones against Russian forces in Donbas. The country’s armed forces were not prepared for the war and had been described as “an army literally in ruins”. Innovation occurred organically from the bottom up, with one unit converting a Saxon armoured vehicle into a drone control centre for conducting strikes on Russian positions. Over time, Ukrainian society responded to the threat, leading to innovations in software, for example, GIS Arta, which uses GPS and digital mapping to track the positions of Ukrainian artillery systems. When a target is detected, it is logged, almost in real time, and the system’s algorithms decide which artillery system is best placed to conduct an engagement. The human gun crew may not see or visually confirm the target. The GIS Arta’s autonomy appears to be limited to selecting the most suitable weapon, but it is relevant to debates about proliferation because it was developed by Ukrainian civilians and taken up by the armed forces without defence industry involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on this, the company Saker developed an image recognition program to identify Russian armoured vehicles, including, according to the programmers, camouflaged vehicles. Saker claims its drones can self-correct after dropping a bomb to ensure that the next bomb is accurate. The program works, in part, because its operational scenario is narrow and the categories of potential targets are easily defined. It needs to identify Russian combat vehicles, a large but ultimately finite target set, aided by Ukraine operating many of the same platforms. It does not need to determine whether an identified tank is a T-72 or T-64, simply that it is a tank. As an operator directs the drone’s flight, the question of whether it is a Russian or Ukrainian tank is irrelevant. In limited deployment scenarios, therefore, MVP AI-assisted programs can identify and engage targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some states – Iran in particular – have demonstrated a patient approach to the indigenous development of autonomous weapons, and are proactively proliferating them. However, the software and hardware are openly available and actors may be able to develop their own solutions if the will and need exist. In the case of non- or less-developed state actors, there may be an adoption advantage in embracing even relatively limited capabilities, so the MVP proliferation risk here is high. However, the essentially limited nature of MVP LAWS suggests that the impact of their use will generally be low in small-scale use. And non-state actors are unlikely to be able to procure, convert and prepare to use very large quantities of drones without creating a significant footprint. Non-state and state actors have used other technologies to attack on a small scale, including IEDs or human lone-wolf attacks, that have not had hugely destabilising effects. This does not, of course, preclude the impact on the public of the use of an MVP LAWS for a targeted assassination of a kind akin to Archduke Ferdinand’s assassination in June 1914, or an attack such as 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-military-off-the-shelf-laws&quot;&gt;III. Military Off-the-Shelf LAWS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where MVP LAWS are likely to be used by non-state actors and weaker militaries against stronger ones, they will be fragile and so standard militaries are more likely to prefer more capable MOTS LAWS. This proliferation avenue is, therefore, very likely, and probably will have greater impact. Dan Wasserbly argues that the development of such LAWS is more about will and ethical concerns than about the technology itself. This chapter focuses on what is an admittedly limited number of states with the ability to design and manufacture LAWS that could be exported to actual or potential opponents of Western militaries. Meaningful analysis of the proliferation risk presented by every nation and/or military is beyond the scope of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOTS LAWS that can claim some form of autonomy fall into two broad categories: single-use weapons destroyed in engaging a target; and multiple-use systems that carry armaments for target engagement. The majority of those discussed here are aerial vehicles. Although developing underwater or surface vessels is, theoretically, straightforward, autonomous ground vehicles represent a greater challenge. The MOTS proliferation risk is largely dependent on the nature of the country that has developed the technology. Some have a legacy of proliferating destabilising and harmful technologies, others less so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple states are pursuing independent LAWS programmes. Indonesia operates an autonomous coastal surveillance system procured from Israel and has domestic companies examining other autonomous technologies. South Korea’s Dodaam Systems received widespread condemnation in 2015 for its autonomous remote weapons station, while Hanwha has expressed the goal of automating its K9 self-propelled howitzer by 2040. The analysis in this chapter focuses on the potential for autonomous weapons to proliferate in ways that could bring Western militaries into contact with them. So, while the countries below have a record of providing sensitive technologies to others, they are likely not alone in proliferating MOTS LAWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china&quot;&gt;China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China represents a significant proliferation challenge. Beijing has assisted Pakistan in acquiring nuclear weapons, contributed to Iran’s nuclear programme, and is critical in financing North Korea’s regime. Publicly, China supports both prohibition and regulation of the use of LAWS, but this contradicts the private rhetoric of the People’s Liberation Army and the Chinese Communist Party. China’s expansive R&amp;amp;D budget and close links between its universities and defence industry mean dual-use technologies and new developments in autonomy may be easily absorbed into the development of LAWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s defence industry is one of the few to have developed and sold LAWS on the international market. In 2018 it was reported that Ziyan had sold its Blowfish A2 drone to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and by 2019 was in negotiations with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for the same system. The Blowfish can form ad hoc swarms, and carries an AI-augmented targeting system allowing it to search for, identify and acquire targets, adjusting its aim and autonomously select the “trigger time” to engage the target. The level of human involvement is unclear, although the Blowfish is understood to include some form of ground control station that allows an operator to halt a mission if required. When swarming, the Blowfish relies on a module that “is capable of autonomously performing formations, attack functions, and collision avoidance”. The operator selects the attack profile, suggesting the operator might select a target, which the Blowfish swarm then decides how to attack. This form of autonomy is replicated in other Chinese designs, as well as the UAE’s Hunter 2S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the China Electric Power Research Institute revealed its UAV swarm system for reconnaissance, electronic warfare, “information countermeasures” and kinetic strikes – its name roughly translates as “Swarm No. 1 Marine Vehicle”. It uses an off-road truck chassis to carry 48 loitering munitions in a launch rack with space in the cabin for the crew. The level of human involvement is not clear, but it appears that humans select the target, and the swarm decides its approach and tactics for the engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;iran&quot;&gt;Iran&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran arguably represents the greatest proliferation risk, having provided weapons and expertise to the Houthis in Yemen. Iran’s Quds Force, part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has led and supported proxy forces since its establishment in 1979. This assistance includes the provision of arms and training, including ballistic missiles and kamikaze drones, that have enabled the Houthis to attack targets in Saudi Arabia. In February 2023, the UK presented evidence to the UN that Iran supplied advanced weapons to the Houthis in violation of a UN Council Resolution. In 2022, Hizbullah’s leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, indicated that his group could turn their arsenal of unguided rockets into guided missiles with the help of Iran. In August 2022, an attack was conducted on the US base at Al-Tanf in Syria by an Iran-backed militia using KAS-04 drones supplied by Iran. Most recently, Iran has transferred a large quantity of UAVs and loitering munitions such as the Shahed-136 to Russia, which have contributed to Russia’s war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran intends to be an early adopter of LAWS, and has developed several drones reportedly capable of autonomously locating and engaging ground-based as well as airborne targets. Iran’s developments in LAWS technology may well follow the MVP paradigm, but at a state level. Iran’s willingness to distribute sensitive technologies to proxy forces and partners represents a significant proliferation risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;israel&quot;&gt;Israel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a direct threat to Western armed forces, Israel presents a proliferation pathway as it has sold military systems to others who could use, transfer or re-engineer them. The Harpy is arguably the most successful LAWS by export sales – in service with Azerbaijan, China, India, Israel, South Korea and Turkey. In the 2000s, there were efforts to modify the Harpy so that it could autonomously locate and detect missile launchers before contacting the operator for strike authorisation. Subsequent developments from the Harpy’s manufacturer, IAI, have eschewed fully autonomous targeting – for example, the Harop requires human control at all times, but flies autonomously to the selected area. Similarly, Elbit, which manufactures the Lanius, a racing quadcopter design, has been explicit that “attack missions require man-in-the-loop control to approve fire procedures”. However, while this would not be easy, there is a risk that human-in-the-loop functions could be overridden by malicious actors with the requisite skills, or replicas made without this safety check – although replicas are likely to be more basic and potentially more easily countered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel is also a leader in autonomous ground vehicles. The Carmel programme, launched in 2019, allows the crew to monitor the vehicle’s autonomous actions and interfere if necessary. The solution, based around IAI’s Athena software, can be installed on any platform and is designed to autonomously detect and categorise threats, navigate with or without pre-planned routes, and make decisions about whether or not to alert the operators to any detected threats. So, although not a weapon system, the technology could be combined with other elements to create a LAWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s attitudes to LAWS could be shaped by many factors, but a significant factor in Israel’s foreign relations is its reliance on the US, which in the past has exerted political pressure on Israel to cancel arms deals and research links with China, for example. Where Israeli exports of LAWS run counter to US interests, there will likely be political pressure to prevent those sales from occurring. The proliferation risk presented by Israel is, therefore, mixed. The country is arguably the most capable of completing the development of LAWS and selling them to other users, but its delicate relations with the US will likely limit the potential spread of these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian Lancet loitering munition allegedly has autonomous capabilities and has been deployed operationally in Ukraine and Syria. The level of automation is not clear. The manufacturer, Kalashnikov, claims it is “capable of autonomously finding and hitting a target”, but there is no firm evidence of its ability to conduct completely autonomous engagements. However, a captured Lancet was found to carry a Nvidia TX2 single-board computer, which is designed for the edge processing of video data. This suggests that the Lancet may be capable of AI-supported targeting and video tracking. The same technology may also be used for autonomous navigation through the use of terrain features. The Lancet has been used more than 900 times in Ukraine, but video footage frequently released from it indicates that it is manually guided onto a target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Russian manufacturers and thinkers have expressed the view that proliferation of autonomous platforms is inevitable, and that Russia will have to create its own technologies to remain competitive. The war in Ukraine will likely impact Russia’s perceptions in this area, although it is not clear how. Further development will be hindered by Western sanctions, as many of Russia’s most advanced weapons rely on Western-supplied microelectronics. While sanctions will not completely deny access to the chips required for Russian LAWS, this and the loss of Russian expertise will also limit their development and subsequent proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kargu is a loitering munition that gained notoriety in 2021 after a UN report into arms embargo violations in Libya claimed it had been used to autonomously engage fleeing targets. The specifics of this claim have been disputed, and it is not clear how much autonomy the system is actually designed to employ. Less is said about STM’s Alpagu, which is described as an autonomous tactical attack UAV. A promotional video from 2017 claims that it has sophisticated computer vision and deep learning algorithms, however it also appears to show a human operator. This suggests that while parts of the targeting cycle are automated and augmented with AI, the weapon itself may not be fully autonomous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Turkey’s arms industry has a broad swathe of advanced capabilities, from high-energy lasers to electronic warfare and armed drones. It is increasingly exporting its capabilities, particularly autonomous capabilities. While a NATO ally, Turkey has been willing to ignore arms embargoes where it considers its strategic interests are at stake. Consequently, Turkey represents a proliferation risk because the proxy forces it has supported may not use the technology responsibly. Nonetheless, the country is subject to diplomatic pressure from the US and others, which can shape its actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-uae&quot;&gt;The UAE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE is pursuing autonomous capabilities and smart weapons through EDGE, a defence conglomerate of multiple national defence companies. In February 2022, EDGE subsidiary Halcon released initial details of its Hunter 2S swarming loitering munition concept, where the company’s CEO remarked on the level of autonomy. Details were scarce, but a Halcon promotional video shows a separate remotely piloted aircraft system conducting reconnaissance of a military installation before a human operator selects several targets. The launch vehicle fires multiple Hunter 2S munitions, which form a swarm. As the munitions approach the target destination, they share data on how to attack each of the selected targets, which includes the allocation of munitions to each target. In the terminal phase, the munitions separate and engage their respective targets as a coordinated swarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE is a growing presence within the international arms sales market and EDGE is already ranked as one of the world’s largest arms exporters. The UAE and EDGE have made clear their intention to become market leaders in key technologies, including autonomous platforms, and to exploit AI-enabled technologies. This, combined with its existing presence on the international arms market, indicates that the UAE is a likely avenue for the proliferation of MOTS LAWS. However, as with Israel and Turkey, the UAE is likely to face pressure from the US and its regional neighbours to avoid selling sensitive technologies to users whose interests might run counter to those of the UAE’s allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-boutique-laws&quot;&gt;IV. Boutique LAWS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While non-state actors or states with smaller budgets might exploit LAWS, these are of lower cost and complexity and are thus likely to be, individually, of lower impact than the boutique systems being explored by the US, China and others. Boutique programmes typically focus on networked sensor integration and stealthy airframes, placing them beyond the reach of all but the richest and most determined nations. Russia aspires to such platforms, but sanctions since its invasion of Ukraine and the cost of rebuilding its forces may well prevent it from pursuing the technology, even if it is technically capable of doing so, which is uncertain. Russian munitions used in Ukraine indicate that Russia relies on Western microelectronics to enable the most basic functions of its advanced weapons, although it is working to wean itself off such dependence. Consequently, the likelihood of boutique autonomy proliferating is lower than for MVP or MOTS LAWS, because of the costs and industrial sophistication involved and the desire by those few nations involved to protect their more sensitive technologies. Should proliferation occur, the impact is significantly greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Air Force Skyborg Programme was established to explore varying degrees of autonomy in human–machine teams. Operating alongside Next Generation Air Dominance, it aims to develop next-generation combat air capabilities, including loyal wingman drones and new command-and-control systems. Others are also developing loyal wingman drones, including Airbus (in Europe), Turkey (Programme Kizilelma), Australia (Ghost Bat) and the UK. China has also joined the fray with its FH-97A, which is orientated towards aerial combat and breaching enemy air defences. The loyal wingman concepts generally seek to unlock difficult missions for air forces such as augmenting aerial situational awareness in heavily defended airspace, or penetration and suppression of enemy air defences, which makes them potentially destabilising, albeit within very specific boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating systems designed to penetrate and defeat national defences could be destabilising, but this should not be overstated. Air defence networks are not perfect solutions and are vulnerable to strikes from the air, land and sea. However, it is possible that future iterations of these and other boutique autonomous weapons could lead to fractious international relations. An example might be the potential effects of autonomous weapons designed specifically to hunt and destroy elements of a country’s nuclear deterrent, such as the US Navy’s Sea Hunter, which is designed to conduct autonomous ocean patrols and track enemy submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about the impact of boutique autonomy on stability focus on how these capabilities may affect strategic decision-making, including timescales and escalation dynamics. States facing each another with boutique LAWS might fear sudden attack, particularly against nuclear capabilities, compressing the timelines for strategic decision-making in an environment where AI is also amplifying disinformation and rhetoric. The US “Star Wars” Strategic Defence Initiative, developed in the late 1980s, drove the Soviet Union to seek asymmetric technologies, such as anti-satellite and silo-defence weapons, and may have contributed to a deterioration in US–Soviet relations. This is the niche into which the kind of boutique autonomy sought by NATO states and China could fit, suggesting cause for concern about the proliferation of these systems if they were to lead to instability between global powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is mixed. Boutique LAWS could create asymmetries of risk through a perception of a lower human cost of war, either encouraging more aggressive behaviour or creating misunderstanding about an opponent’s willingness to contest an issue. Conversely, boutique LAWS could give opposing powers the impression that Western forces are less willing to accept the costs of war escalation, or drive escalation risk, because of their target set. In either scenario, the lack of information about the capabilities of boutique LAWS and their intended uses, as well as the impossibility of knowing what a potential enemy is thinking, suggest caution around development and signalling is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons designed specifically to target an opponent’s nuclear deterrent – autonomous or otherwise – carry immense potential for destabilising the international order and endangering peace and security should one nation feel its nuclear capability can be defeated and thus is no longer a deterrent. This is realistically only within the reach of boutique autonomous technologies and the countries pursuing them. A similar situation may be found in ballistic missile defence capabilities – also technically difficult and within the reach of very few nations – where the destabilising effect on the nuclear balance was such that parties agreed to limit their anti-ballistic missile capabilities through treaties, although the political consensus broke down and the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in December 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proliferation of boutique autonomy is not impossible, even if it is less likely than for MVP or MOTS. Proliferators will still have to prove that the LAWS on offer either augment existing capabilities or exceed them and enable fundamentally new types of operation, and that they can do this at a competitive price. And, having done that, they will need agreement from their governments, who are likely to wish to protect their highly sensitive technologies. The militaries adopting them are also subject to the innovation challenges discussed by Theo Farrell and David Kilcullen, which, these authors suggest, constrain the capacity for radical change under normal circumstances. It follows that their adoption and proliferation might be accelerated by the threat or outbreak of a major war, either demonstrating their utility or affecting one of the developer nations and pushing them to seek out autonomous solutions. Without some kind of catalyst, development and proliferation of acceptable solutions is likely to take another decade, with gradual increases in capability throughout that period leading up to truly autonomous weapons. Whether the war in Ukraine and US concerns over China’s intentions towards Taiwan are such a catalyst remains to be seen. Even if the technology advances more quickly, the proliferation of the systems themselves may be more limited, given the destabilising impact they pose and the desire of governments to protect the most sensitive technologies that give them an edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If political will and support for expensive programmes such as the Future Combat Air System and Skyborg are maintained, these systems will eventually enter service. However, there is an extensive period of trials and evaluations that the programmes must successfully navigate before this will happen. Because of this, their limited proliferation is considered likely but more constrained than for MOTS products. Furthermore, boutique autonomy may prove very destabilising, depending on the way in which it is employed and the political messaging attached to it. It must be understood that these weapons will enable and inform political decisions, which are what may ultimately lead to war, rather than proliferate war themselves. They may, however, give rise to uncomfortable conversations and questions about a country’s intentions to act. And while traditional weapons can be used to do many of the same things, they are less novel and thus less psychologically threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;v-proliferation-constraints&quot;&gt;V. Proliferation Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mere existence of LAWS technology is not enough to drive proliferation, let alone amount to its effective fielding. At its highest levels, warfare is an immensely complex human event involving societal pressures that defy simple explanation. At the sharp end of a war, it is common for historians to focus on a specific technology, for example, tank warfare or strategic bombing during the Second World War. However, this form of analysis ignores, whether deliberately or unintentionally, the enormous complexity of militaries at war. LAWS, although not widely used in conflict, fall into a similar trap – easy to analyse based on their individual merits and to assess as a standalone weapon. It is more instructive to consider how they contribute to the totality of an armed force’s or non-state actor’s battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The circumstances that lend themselves to the development and proliferation of LAWS can be deduced, enabling assessments of the risks. For example, autonomous weapons designed to locate and engage air defence systems are technically possible and ethically straightforward; they target radar emissions of a certain frequency and nothing else. There are few civilian applications for these frequencies and so the risk of collateral damage is relatively low. The massed and concerted use of these weapons provides an almost immediate boost to the totality of an armed force’s battlefield, assuming that they can be integrated into the military system as a whole and are deployed at the right time and place. The cost–benefit–risk ratio favours these weapons, where the political will exists for their adoption, and the risk of instability is limited, as weapons with the same effect have been used for decades without disrupting the international order. The alternative is to risk expensive, and limited, fleets of aircraft and pilots, and other expensive assets, for example, stocks of ground-based long-range strike missiles, in defeating enemy air defences to achieve control of the air. And without control of the air, ground forces are very vulnerable, so the adoption advantage is clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, the benefits may be less obvious. Autonomous weapons that select their own targets using optical sensors and computer vision would only be as successful and survivable as the optical suite. Effective imaging systems, although commercially available, are typically very expensive. Furthermore, electro-optics can be disrupted by the use of smoke or camouflage, which in some cases can almost eliminate thermal emissions. Optics are also very vulnerable to fragmentation and air-burst effects used in most conflicts, so, for autonomous ground vehicles at least, they could be damaged or degraded quickly without the manual fallback on which crewed armoured fighting vehicles can rely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with object recognition improving and commercial investment making these technologies more widely available, acquiring the training data required for neural networks to account for all possible target sets the system might encounter is probably beyond the ability of small state or non-state actors, except in the most limited and permissive scenarios. Neural networks typically require large quantities of training data and computing power to improve their accuracy, which increases the training time. Furthermore, AI technologies, such as few-shot learning, are unlikely to overcome some uses of camouflage and deception. Finally, software and programming challenges are accompanied by significant hardware limitations. Complex LAWS need a degree of hardware complexity that is difficult to overcome without significant investment, which in turn leads to additional power requirements that can result in a weight–power spiral. This suggests that MVP and MOTS products are likely to be quite simplistic in nature and limited in their ability to conduct tasks requiring multiple calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adoption advantage requires these limitations to be weighed against what is already possible. Conventional indirect fires are devastating when combined with readily available and cheap drones, such as the DJI Mavic. The training burden is low enough that non-state actors can achieve these effects without having to invest in developing their own programmes. Russian forces in Ukraine have brought accurate artillery fire to bear within five minutes of identifying a target with a drone. This very rapid targeting procedure would be difficult to accelerate because it is limited by how quickly artillery can be loaded, the gun elevated and the round’s travel to the target. Automating the entire process is unlikely to improve the end result (rapid targeting time and precision) beyond the increased survivability conferred by the absence of crews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massed swarm of autonomous drones, similar to the Hunter 2S, can have significant effects against opponents not prepared for the threat – reputedly IS employed 70 armed drones in a near-simultaneous attack on Iraqi forces in December 2016, halting Iraq’s operations. Remotely operated drones are problematic militarily, but jamming the global navigation satellite system link or the operator’s radio link can degrade and attrit them quickly, leading to high loss rates. Autonomy reduces or eliminates this vulnerability; the drones do not require command links to human operators, while alternatives to satellite navigation, such as an inertial or AI-based navigation, also increase resilience through preloaded coordinates and autonomous target selection. This is increasingly possible using commercial technology from the machine learning and computer vision market. US technology company Nvidia has produced a small nano-computer designed to run AI algorithms, while small-form computing and AI could reduce demands on space, weight and power within UAVs. Commercially available drones can also work as autonomous drone swarms. Autonomous technology could also enable VBIEDs or autonomous surface vessels designed to deliver payloads against ships, increasing an already challenging threat. This is theoretically possible using extant technology and will probably become more prevalent as interest in the technology grows. However, the damage from this type of simple LAWS would currently be quite indiscriminate, more like loitering munitions than truly autonomous weapons, and of limited impact. Ukraine’s strikes against Russian ships and infrastructure using uncrewed aircraft and vessels have been of relatively limited military effect without mass or use in combination with other capabilities such as long-range missiles, although the political effect of individual strikes has been greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to autonomously select a target within the ethical and legal constraints of the laws of armed conflict is problematic because machine learning creates problems that are difficult to answer. It is possible to know the data an algorithm has trained on, and how that might have impacted its decision-making, but in complex environments there are aspects of decision-making that the operator will not understand. Using humans to select targets in real time before releasing LAWS to engage could free forces to conduct other engagements simultaneously, imposing multiple dilemmas on an adversary. For artillery, it could enable “leader–follower” operations, with some uncrewed howitzers in a battery, increasing mass without additional people. However, this is not a truly autonomous weapon according to most definitions. It is worth noting that this kind of technology would generate a swarming challenge that is difficult for today’s armed forces to face. Allowing LAWS to select their own targets introduces uncertainty and reduces the predictability of engagements, so confining automation to parts of the targeting cycle rather than the complete cycle could enhance battlefield outcomes, while limiting some of the potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the challenge to militaries from LAWS is currently manageable. However, LAWS change the approach to defeating enemy capabilities. Most weapons are designed to kill or disable the human operator or, for remotely operated systems, defeat the link between human and machine. Defeating LAWS, however, requires the ability to disable or destroy the platform, which is more difficult. It would require destructive capabilities, for example, man-portable air defence missiles, at all echelons, as well as some form of enhanced intelligence picture to communicate incoming threats quickly. This is expensive, even where relatively fragile MVP LAWS are being employed in mass, as the economic cost of destroying a single LAWS works against the defender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAWS proliferation depends on both the availability of the technology and the adoption advantage. For militaries, modern conventional weapons are very effective at delivering lethal effects when paired with modern software-based solutions, so the bar is high. It is likely, therefore, that autonomy will complement crewed capabilities in many cases. The adoption advantage bar is lower for weaker militaries and non-state actors, but MVP systems are often more fragile and thus more easily countered, although their use at scale poses its own challenges. Boutique systems are very capable, but their cost, complexity and instability potential suggest that their proliferation is less likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autonomous weapons are being used increasingly but are not a homogeneous capability: there are different capabilities with different proliferation and consequence risks. The changing policy framework reflects this; its dual-track approach combines regulation and prohibition, with a growing emphasis on regulation as a form of arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proliferation is a function of the technology’s availability and adoption advantage, which reflects the degree to which the technology provides an edge over a potential adversary. This depends on LAWS being:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As effective as or better than humans and existing weapons in the same role, for example, suppression of enemy air defences or artillery fire.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cheaper than a human or existing weapon in the same role.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Easy enough to develop and deploy so the opportunity costs of doing so do not outweigh any potential gain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption advantage varies depending on the type of LAWS and the nature of the adversary. This paper identifies three categories of LAWS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MVP:&lt;/strong&gt; These represent a very high proliferation risk, but the systems are currently fragile and less capable than many existing military capabilities. Adoption advantage for MVP LAWS favours criminal and non-state actors and weaker militaries. Stronger militaries need to be prepared to counter these kinds of LAWS, which, while they are unlikely to be hugely destabilising, could be used for isolated atrocities, for example 9/11-type events. Regulating access to MVP LAWS is likely to be impossible, as the knowledge and technology is too widespread, but shaping the environment for their use through clear statements of acceptability (normative control) and criminal law covering the use or sale of technology offers some opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOTS:&lt;/strong&gt; These are more robust and have a higher adoption advantage than MVPs, but they are still complex and require infrastructure and organisational capacity to exploit, so the proliferation risk into militaries and larger non-state actors is high. Many are still supervised systems rather than fully autonomous, but are more challenging to counter than MVPs. Currently, they complement but do not completely replace other conventional capabilities. Further proliferation should be expected, especially from countries or companies with more relaxed attitudes to arms control, and militaries need the ability to counter these systems. The war in Ukraine will accelerate proliferation, as relatively sophisticated weapons are captured and shared with those who will copy them. As MOTS LAWS are largely, but not exclusively, in the hands of governments, some control is possible, including through existing mechanisms of international humanitarian law holding states to account for weapons use, but the problem of definitions still applies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boutique:&lt;/strong&gt; These cost billions of dollars to develop and are difficult to operate, so are only in the hands of a few nations. While they are potentially the most destabilising type of LAWS, this results in their proliferation risk being relatively low, as there is an advantage in not allowing them to proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments – through, among others, their militaries, and police forces where LAWS are used by criminals – need to be able to respond to the risks posed by LAWS, either as users of such systems or because they will be the targets of them. Consequently, they have a vested interest in shaping the debate around LAWS. While an outright ban on all forms of LAWS is no longer practical, opportunities exist to deal with different types of LAWS differently. This will involve a combination of policy and capability choices, including creating space for debate in which the normative case for regulation can be made. This should be accompanied by strengthened criminal legislation dealing with LAWS use, and industrial requirement and export controls covering autonomous systems, and also semi-autonomous systems that could be developed to full autonomy through MVP enhancement. The risks also require the development of counter-LAWS capabilities, for example electronic warfare and integrated defences. As the threats are not just military, governments need information and capability sharing between military and civilian authorities, such as police and intelligence agencies. Ensuring that information-sharing mechanisms exist is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the LAWS debate is focused on ethics, legal definitions and boutique capabilities. There are numerous less capable but militarily potentially useful LAWS being developed that require further examination to understand the adoption advantage and risks because these weapons are likely to proliferate ahead of the exquisite capabilities sought by the world’s major powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future is being written, but it has not been decided – militaries will have to play their part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e2as3R3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（7日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第25日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方就2019年七一佔領立法會提問，訊息紀錄顯示，黎智英在事後指示陳沛敏報導年輕人心聲，「盡量為他們在這件事上爭取市民諒解和支持，得以平反」、「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情」，又要求把「這些 sentiment 擴大擴散，瀰漫成為市民共識」。陳表示黎落指示之後，「我哋就好似要帶住動機去採訪呢件事」，而她最後有落實黎的指示。訊息紀錄又顯示，黎曾提議陳刊登前荃灣區議員岑敖暉的文章，或採訪他就事件的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;雙方續討論逆權英文翻譯-最終採用反威權主義意思&quot;&gt;雙方續討論「逆權」英文翻譯 最終採用「反威權主義」意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有關昨日陳沛敏提到的「逆權」英文翻譯問題，控方甫開庭便告知法庭，控方認為「逆權」譯作「anti-authority」較合適，但辯方則認為「anti-tyranny」較合適。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻表示，他未能同意控方的見解，因「anti-authority」意思是不接受任何權力管治，暗示「無政府」。彭又稱，他昨晚看過南韓電影《逆權大狀》，內容講述某律師願意接手一宗牽涉政府濫權的案件，所以認為「逆權」有反極權的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過杜麗冰隨即指出，不能盲目地跟從一部電影來翻譯，應該讓法庭傳譯員根據本地脈絡來翻譯「逆權」一字，而昨日把《逆權六月》翻譯做「The June Struggle」是不正確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示控方英文翻譯文本，就同一組中文字「逆權六月」，出現兩種不同英文翻譯，分別是「Revolution June」和「The June Struggle」。杜官認為有少許誤導性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭傳譯員被要求作出決定時，一度猶豫，表示「逆權」會因應「權」所指涉的對象而有不同譯法，她最終表示按前文後理來理解，會認為「逆權」應譯作「anti-totalitarianism」或「anti-authoritarianism」。辯方彭耀鴻表示認同此譯法，控方代表周天行則表示尊重法庭傳譯員的專業性。各方最終同意採用「anti-authoritarianism」作為「逆權」的英文翻譯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，控方有兩年時間準備本案，卻仍欠周詳。杜麗冰亦同意，指控方假設所有法官都同時懂得閱讀中文和英文，可是事實卻不然，當有法官不是雙語時，問題便會浮現。在審訊中多番表示不懂閱讀中文的法官李素蘭，對杜官表示贊同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英指示陳沛敏報導佔領立會-盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英指示陳沛敏報導佔領立會 「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第四天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著就反修例爆發之後，示威者在七一佔領立法會的事件提問。事後黎智英向前動新聞總監張志偉傳送訊息：「Nick，很好。年輕人衝（擊）立法會事（件）令我心情沈（沉）重，你們認為泛民善後工作有什麼該做令運動可以持續？好彩市民對年輕人闖立法院會是多少有些體諒，損害可能不太大。你們認為呢？謝謝。」、「這年輕父親講得很好，對很多人都會有啓發性。」黎將上述訊息轉發給陳沛敏，又指死守立法會其中一名「死士」的訪問影片有很多人看。陳沛敏回覆：「收到，明天報紙已會有很多衝擊和佔領立會年輕人心聲，包括上述『死士』。明天會再做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後回覆：「是，要再做。明天是否集中做年輕人的心聲，盡量為他們在這件事上爭取市民諒解和支持，得以平反？謝謝。」陳回覆「當然一定有些人不認同衝立會，但這些人也不會因此變成認同林鄭。我們明天會再做。謝謝」。黎再回覆「盡量大做特做令年輕人獲得同情」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎落指示後-好似要帶住動機去採訪&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎落指示後 「好似要帶住動機去採訪」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏供稱，根據訊息紀錄，黎要求把「這些 sentiment 擴大擴散，瀰漫成為市民共識」，即是要求報導年輕人心聲，爭取市民諒解和支持。而她亦嘗試告訴黎，《蘋果》已經報導了年輕爸爸「死士」及示威者放低錢才拿汽水飲，他們意識到佔領立法會是重大事件，已本能地去做報導和記錄。陳續指，「但黎生係有個 intention 想我哋再跟進」，「佢喺訊息俾我哋嘅指示係：衝擊立法會呢件事好有爭議，會令到市民唔再支持呢個運動。所以我哋喺佢未出聲之前，我哋其實都係會採訪呢件事，但係佢講完呢番說話之後，我哋就好似要帶住動機去採訪呢件事」，令市民繼續支持運動，以及「想公眾諒解或支持」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，黎是否希望陳帶著目的去做報導，而且這是否一個指示。陳表示「我理解係」，而最終亦有執行黎的指示。她會與《壹週刊》主管聯絡，先確認他們會否跟進事件，當他們提供示威者訪問後，「我哋會做大，落實黎生嘅指示。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英提議刊登岑敖暉文章或訪問有關佔立會觀點&quot;&gt;黎智英提議刊登岑敖暉文章或訪問有關佔立會觀點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月2日的訊息紀錄顯示，黎向陳傳送前學聯副秘書長、前荃灣區議員岑敖暉的 Facebook 文章，問陳：「沛敏，我們可用某種形式刊登這篇文章嗎？甚至給他做個訪問說明。謝謝。」陳回覆：「論壇可刊登。另有他的聯絡嗎？」黎回覆：「我來問。謝謝」，其後再稱：「他是岑敖暉，你應有他的聯絡吧。」陳傳送一個「OK」表情符號。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據訊息紀錄，陳將黎上述訊息轉發給負責論壇版的編輯楊清奇，並問楊「明天見報論壇會否盡量組織有關佔領立會的文章？」、「麻煩你找人聯絡他（岑敖暉）看此文章能否用。謝謝」。楊回覆：「要港聞同事幫幫手吧，睇下有冇佢 contact」，陳傳送了岑的聯絡資訊之後，楊稱：「暫時有四稿，岑未覆，如得，出全版」，又指「楊社」和另一個專欄都會延後出。被問到「楊社」是誰，陳指是《壹週刊》前社長楊懷康，筆名是「古立」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上解釋，由於她覺得不是太適合以新聞形式去處理岑敖暉的文章，或是訪問他，所以問可否刊登岑的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏指黎智英投稿外國媒體和受訪較2019年之前頻密&quot;&gt;陳沛敏指黎智英投稿外國媒體和受訪較2019年之前頻密&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月4日，黎智英向陳沛敏傳送一篇文章連結，是黎所撰寫的文章 “What the Hong Kong Protests are really about（〈香港示威究竟是關於什麼〉）”，在7月1日刊登於《紐約時報》。控方指，根據訊息紀錄，黎將相同的文章連結亦傳送至李卓人、何俊仁、WhatsApp 群組「Jim/ Jimmy/ Mark」等。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 黎智英（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問以陳所知，黎在2019至2021年期間，替外國媒體撰文的頻率是怎樣？陳表示：「我講唔到有幾頻密，不過係比2019年之前頻密咗。」控方續問，是否相比2014年較頻密？陳回答：「係，會頻密咗。」控方續問，黎接受外媒訪問的頻率又如何？陳指：「咁2019年之後係頻密過以前囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏為加入蓬佩奧晤黎智英報導-而出第二版報紙&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：為加入蓬佩奧晤黎智英報導 而出第二版報紙&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年7月9日《蘋果》報紙A3版報導〈蓬佩奧晤黎智英討論逃犯例〉。文章上方標註「今晨第二次版」，陳沛敏解釋意思不是印刷第二版，而是印了某一部份數量的報紙後，決定更改內容至第二版，之後根據第二版而印刷餘下數量的報紙。陳指由於當日他們未能趕及在第一版報紙擺放蓬佩奧晤黎智英的報導，為了刊出該報導而出現第二版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何要在第二版加入此報導。陳表示：「因為黎先生去美國見國務卿蓬佩奧，會係重要，會需要改版去處理。」控方追問這何以重要？陳表示，有見黎一直不時傳送外國的文章給她，「佢會好關注外國點樣睇香港嘅運動啦，所以佢今次直情係自己去美國，去見美國國務卿，所以我哋會咁樣處理。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，陳認為黎智英會見蓬佩奧的新聞非常重要，重要到有需要當天盡早刊登，問陳是否同意。陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年7月12日刊於報紙的報導〈黎智英晤博爾頓促蓬府援港〉，當中引述《彭博》報導，黎先後會見時任美國副總統彭斯、時任國務卿蓬佩奧、時任美國國家安全顧問博爾頓、共和黨參議員克魯茲、加德納、斯科特會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年7月15日的《蘋果》網上新聞推送通知（push notification），文章題為〈【逆權運動】黎智英籲美發聲支持港人 「以道德力量抗中」〉，報導內容源自《福斯商業網》（Fox Business）文章 “US-China trade negotiations: Moral authority is great leverage against China, Jimmy Lai says”。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據訊息紀錄，控方指「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）於2019年7月19日向黎發送訊息，轉述美國國會議員 Ted Yoho 有意投稿予《蘋果》，希望聯絡編輯。黎遂把相關訊息轉發給陳。陳確認當時有收到 Ted Yoho 的投稿文章，可是不太記得文章內容，相信是關於支持當時香港的運動。至於文章最後有否刊登，陳則不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ok25jsS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（7日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第25日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。她稱黎智英在「飯盒會」上曾經建議「關於運動嘅新聞要做得好」、「關於警暴嘅新聞，佢提我哋要做得深入」。黎於2019年10月到美國會見參議員之後，要求陳「用訪問形式，問我十條左右香港現時情況和這次華盛頓游說之旅問題」，陳遂應要求構思問題，然後交給同事。陳又提到，黎一向認為要爭取外國向香港政府施壓，令政府回應訴求。此外，訊息紀錄顯示，黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 曾向陳提及美國組織「香港民主委員會」前執行總監、正被警方通緝的朱牧民，並提供聯絡電話和電郵給陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑照片見728示威者推著火手推車-惟報紙頭版僅提生雞蛋&quot;&gt;控方質疑照片見7.28示威者推著火手推車 惟報紙頭版僅提「生雞蛋」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第四天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤作主問。上午聆訊談及7.1佔立法會之後，黎智英指示陳報導年輕人心聲，以爭取市民支持和諒解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方下午展示2019年7月29日《蘋果日報》頭版，關於7月28日的中上環警民衝突，題為〈生雞蛋來襲 催淚彈還擊警亂 槍狂射平民〉，並指報紙下方有圖片拍攝到示威者在上環西港城推動一架燃燒中的手推車，問為何標題卻只寫「生雞蛋來襲」？陳則表示當天她休假，相關報紙並非由她處理，而是其副手、前執行總編輯林文宗負責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏指黎智英在飯盒會談及時局看法-提醒警暴新聞要深入&quot;&gt;陳沛敏指黎智英在飯盒會談及時局看法 提醒警暴新聞要深入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年8月1日的訊息紀錄，黎邀請陳翌日到他家裡吃晚飯。陳供稱，過往曾經與其他同事一同到黎家中吃午飯，晚飯則比較少。被問到8月該次晚飯討論了什麼話題，陳表示不記得具體內容，只記得黎在場時會談及工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，「後來佢（黎）搞咗個飯盒會」，便會在公司大樓的貴賓房內吃飯，期間黎會向同事表達他對時局的看法。報紙部門的「飯盒會」會每隔數星期舉行一次，出席者包括她、前社長張劍虹和執行總編輯林文宗等。黎談及的話題包括如何令報紙「雜誌化」、內部資訊科技系統等；時局看法方面，黎曾經建議「關於運動嘅新聞要做得好」、「關於警暴嘅新聞，佢提我哋要做得深入」，而張劍虹會負責會議紀錄，事後透過軟件「Slack」發送給其他同事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳記得「飯盒會」由2019年開始舉行，而2020年則持續了一整年。控方指黎於2020年12月起被扣押，問「飯盒會」是否一直有舉行，直至黎還柙。陳則指即使疫情爆發後仍然有開會，但不記得直到哪一個月份為止，因她並沒有出席所有「飯盒會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蘋果廣告提及港台命運共同睇-陳沛敏黎認為台港兩地命運相連&quot;&gt;蘋果廣告提及「港台命運共同睇」 陳沛敏：黎認為台港兩地命運相連&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示《蘋果日報》自己的全版廣告，可見台灣地圖形狀及3名台灣政治人物，包括蔡英文、柯文哲和韓國瑜，大字標題〈明日台灣民主，失守還是堅守？〉，下方顯示「升級壹會員港台命運共同睇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何會使用「港台命運共同睇」字眼，以及這是否當時《蘋果》的立場。陳則指：「『共同睇』係食字，『共同體』係體育嘅『體』，而唔係睇嘢嘅『睇』。」她指上述廣告的意思是，讀者可以用一個價錢，便能在《蘋果》手機 App 上兼看香港和台灣的內容。但她相信控方問題的意思是《蘋果》立場上，是否認為台港兩地命運有相連關係，而「呢個係黎生嘅立場」，因她以往在黎的文章中，以及他在會議上談及時局時，「都會就住台灣講佢嘅意見，所以就知佢嘅立場。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年8月18日的訊息紀錄顯示，黎向陳表示將會接受美國霍士新聞訪問，要求陳替他搜集資料，而陳其後提供相關資料。同日，《蘋果》發出一則推播通知（push notification）：〈【逆權運動】讚美國將反送中跟貿易戰掛鈎 黎智英接受霍士訪問：美國應助港人抗爭〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏曾與黎智英私人助理mark-simon訊息對話&quot;&gt;陳沛敏曾與黎智英私人助理Mark Simon訊息對話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指陳的 WhatsApp 訊息紀錄顯示，她在2019年8月與 Mark Simon 有訊息對話。陳指他是黎的私人助理，她在擔任副總編輯的時候才知道有這個人。被問到曾否與 Mark Simon 面對面交談，陳反問：「可能見到面 Hello，咁算唔算？」，惟她肯定二人不曾詳談。陳又表示不記得第一次見到 Mark Simon 是何時，只記得「咁有個外國人喺公司出現，大家都會八卦吓佢係邊個」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到 Mark Simon 的辦公室是否都在壹傳媒大樓，陳表示「唔肯定」，但她知道 Mark Simon 經常到台灣《蘋果日報》工作，因張劍虹不時赴台灣公幹，回港後提及他在當地見到 Mark Simon。陳相信 Mark Simon 職責是協助黎打理傳媒以外的生意，以及處理黎指派給他的工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指mark-simon提及購買裝備-陳沛敏記者示威現場採訪需要&quot;&gt;控方指Mark Simon提及購買裝備 陳沛敏：記者示威現場採訪需要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，Mark Simon 於2019年8月26日向陳表示，他正身處台灣，可以低價購買大量頭盔、防毒面罩、保護衣，如陳有需要可提出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何 Mark Simon 會談及頭盔、防毒面罩等保護裝備。陳則指當時示威活動很頻密，而記者到現場採訪時需要這些裝備，「因為現場兵荒馬亂，都需要呢啲頭盔、防毒口罩和記者反光衣。」她續指，記憶中這些裝備很難購買，不只《蘋果日報》，其他媒體也面對相同情況，「以前未曾試過帶嗰啲嘢去工作㗎嘛」，所以當 Mark Simon 聲稱可以買到，她便禮貌上回應「好」，但是「冇好認真對待」他的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示mark-simon提及朱牧民新組織-並提供聯絡電話&quot;&gt;訊息顯示Mark Simon提及朱牧民新組織 並提供聯絡電話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2019年9月10日，Mark Simon 再向陳發送訊息，問《蘋果》有否派任何人到美國華盛頓採訪時任香港眾志秘書長黃之鋒和歌手何韻詩的訪美之旅（“Guys, Have we sent anybody in DC to cover the Joshua Wong &amp;amp; Denise Ho trip? Thanks”）。陳回覆有（“Yes”）。Mark Simon 之後再說，牧師朱耀明兒子朱牧民正帶領一個新組織，而且獲得民主黨創黨主席李柱銘和前政務司司長陳方安生的支持（“Great, there’s a new group there headed up by Sam Chu, he’s the son of Reverend Chu. I’m not 100% sure how good they’re going to be but Martin Lee and Anson Chan are backing him.”），其後傳送朱牧民的聯絡電話和電郵給陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上表示，當時並不認識美國組織香港民主委員會（Hong Kong Democracy Council），看到有關朱牧民的新聞時才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查報導，朱牧民是美國公民，他於2019年9月起擔任美國組織香港民主委員會（Hong Kong Democracy Council）執行總監。2020年7月，《國安法》生效約一個月，警方宣布通緝羅冠聰等6名海外港人，當中包括朱牧民。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又提到，黎智英於2019年9月再度接受外媒霍士新聞訪問，《蘋果》於9月6日發出一則推播通知〈【逆權運動】「如果我們不抗爭會失去所有」 黎智英接受霍士訪問解釋國際支持的重要〉。陳則表示事前並不知道黎受訪，「佢做外媒訪問又唔會通知我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英訪美後-要求陳就游說之旅訪問他&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英訪美後 要求陳就游說之旅訪問他&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早前開案陳詞提及黎智英於2019年10月22日到美國會見參議員。同日，《蘋果》網站就此報導，題為〈【美國直擊】參議員關注示威暴力升級 黎智英冀美多發聲令青年面對警暴不孤單〉，配圖寫有「國際戰線速報」。控方問《蘋果》有否組織「國際戰線」？陳回答沒有，而且這是網上新聞，她不知道網站同事使用「國際戰線」的考量是什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年10月24日，黎智英傳送訊息給陳：「沛敏，因我今期沒時間寫稿，你是否可以用訪問形式，問我十條左右香港現時情況和這次華盛頓游說之旅問題，我解答作為專欄文章？謝謝。」陳則回覆「👌我度度」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，她當時收到黎的訊息之後，便構思了一些問題，然後傳送給同事，之後再由同事傳送給黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So pleased to welcome Jimmy Lai, Martin Lee and Janet Pang to the U.S. Capitol. My full support and admiration goes to those who have taken to the streets week after week in non-violent protest to fight for democracy and the rule of law in #HongKong. pic.twitter.com/maeTwTR8eV — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) October 22, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏訪美與黎一向立場相符-即爭取外國向香港政府施壓&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：訪美與黎一向立場相符 即「爭取外國向香港政府施壓」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到事後有否與黎討論該次訪美，陳表示沒有特別去討論，因為對於她而言，「佢去美國做嗰樣嘢，同佢一向嘅立場相符，所以我又冇乜好奇怪或好意外嘅問題要問佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎「一向的立場」是怎樣。陳指稱：「佢覺得要爭取外國向香港政府施壓」，當時運動有幾個訴求，除了撤回《逃犯條例》之外，社會上還有聲音質疑是否存在警暴，要求獨立調查事件，黎的立場覺得要透過外國施壓，令政府回應訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到黎有否談及「施壓」是指什麼，陳表示「黎生冇直接同我講過」，不過當時背景是美國眾議院正在審議《香港民主及人權法案》，「佢喺嗰個時間訪問美國，亦都同當時嘅國會議員見面，我相信係呢一類、呢啲法案嘅施壓囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英吩咐陳找新聞圖片-以協助政黨製作海報籲區選投票&quot;&gt;黎智英吩咐陳找新聞圖片 以協助政黨製作海報籲區選投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年11月15日《蘋果日報》報紙，其中一篇報導題為〈屠龍隊邊緣呼喚 全民勇武／三罷〉，版面上方印有「樽頸困局」，陳形容這是編輯對當時運動情況的形容。控方補充當時香港發生中大校園暴動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問此報導以什麼角度來撰寫。陳指這是一個人物訪問，「佢屬於比較激進啲嘅團體，佢呼籲標題所講嘅嘢，同埋解釋點解要呼籲囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄又顯示，陳沛敏和林文宗就一幅題為「請投票止警暴」海報討論。陳指黎吩咐她去找一些新聞圖片讓他揀選，相信是協助一些政黨去製作海報，是有關2019年區議會換屆選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（6日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第24日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。她供稱，過往《蘋果》只會在七一大遊行當日，於報紙其中一頁全版印刷由尊子操刀的政治漫畫，不過在2019年4月28日的反送中大遊行，《蘋果》卻破例地在當天報紙做同樣的事。陳形容黎很重視該次遊行，立場上亦鮮明地反對修例，並相信他「支持抗爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳昨天談及《蘋果》頭版報導前銅鑼灣書店店長林榮基赴台一事，並稱這是她的決定。控方今展示2019年4月26日的訊息紀錄。陳解釋，黎問她有關林榮基的資料，於是她向黎智英傳送林榮基的維基百科連結和港台節目《鏗鏘集》的連結，之後黎傳來一段文字，「佢應該就將嗰啲資料綜合成一段文字，問我 fact check 啱唔啱。」陳相信黎當時正在撰寫個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」。控方遂展示黎的專欄文章〈請站出來保住最後防線〉，內文含有林榮基的描述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏蘋果以往只在七一全版印政治漫畫-2019年4月反送中遊行破例&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：《蘋果》以往只在七一全版印政治漫畫 2019年4月反送中遊行破例&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2019年4月26日黎向陳傳送語音訊息，指不能每一份報紙都印海報，建議陳問工黨李卓人需要多少海報，《蘋果》便印多少，然後供他們在現場派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏於2019年4月27日凌晨向黎傳送政治漫畫的設計草圖，寫有「反惡法 倒林鄭」字樣，以及顯示「黑獄」的鐐銬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示一張4月28日遊行現場的相片，由陳傳送給黎，相中一名遊行人士舉起《蘋果日報》，分別展示當天頭版和全版政治漫畫。頭版有前港督彭定康、林榮基、佔中案被告戴耀廷、陳健民、黃浩銘、邵家臻和陳淑莊，題為「今日上街反惡法」，而政治漫畫則與陳早前傳送給黎的草圖相同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，如果當日有大型遊行的話，《蘋果》會邀請政治漫畫家尊子設計一個漫畫，然後全版印刷，不過此做法以往只限於七一遊行當日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問2019年之後，《蘋果》在全版印刷漫畫上有否改變？陳指當時4月的遊行是關於反對逃犯條例，「嗰次我哋破例喺4月廿幾號都有做到呢樣嘢囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英重視4月反送中遊行-相信他支持抗爭&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英重視4月反送中遊行 相信他支持抗爭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何《蘋果》會破例於4月的遊行全版印刷政治漫畫？陳表示不肯定，「當時黎生都好重視呢個遊行，所以我哋就都有印嗰個漫畫出嚟囉。」控方追問陳何以感覺到黎重視該次遊行？陳指：「佢（黎）不斷 send 訊息過嚟畀我哋，睇吓點樣令多啲人上街，同埋問我哋會唔會幫民陣印海報。」被問到黎對於抗爭有何立場，陳表示：「我諗佢係支持抗爭，同反對（修例）囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指每次有意在報紙上全版印刷政治漫畫，她都會請示社長張劍虹。控方追問，張劍虹是否需要向某些人請示？陳表示不肯定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎智英託羅傑斯邀請彭定康評論反送中-並著陳報導&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎智英託羅傑斯邀請彭定康評論反送中 並著陳報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示黎的訊息，他於2019年4月27日向陳沛敏稱：「沛敏，請想想有什麼我們還可做催谷市民明天上街？現在情況實在太靜，好驚。謝謝。」黎其後轉發羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）的訊息，羅傑斯指彭定康可能身在法國，又建議黎找《蘋果》記者自行找彭定康訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示羅傑斯傳送給陳沛敏的訊息，當中轉述彭定康對反對《逃犯條例》修訂的評論，著陳可以報導。彭定康形容修例是對香港價值和繁榮穩定造成傷害，亦會為營商環境帶來恐懼和不確定性，直接衝擊香港法治制度下的「一國兩制」和高度自治，又會危害政治行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後庭上展示2019年4月28日當日《蘋果日報》的實體報紙，A2版顯示報導文章〈彭定康：修例損港地位 衝擊自主〉。控方提到，版面上方有「今日反惡法」字眼，問這是誰的主意。陳僅指鐐銬破碎的圖像是由美術部同事畫的，而「今日反惡法」字眼則由編輯根據報導主題而構思出來。她和執行總編輯林文宗核稿時會見到相關字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指當天報紙A3是一個全版廣告，顯示一個手銬，寫著字句「你確定自己不是逃犯？」、「剖析真相守護公義」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏2019年4至5月-反送中一直是蘋果主題-黎智英鮮明地反修例&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：2019年4至5月 「反送中」一直是《蘋果》主題 黎智英鮮明地反修例&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年4月22日《蘋果日報》報導，題為〈4.28 反惡法 民陣號召上街抗送中例 阻中共越港人紅線〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問4月28日之前，該4.28遊行是否一直是《蘋果日報》的主題？陳回答「係」之後，接著問「我可唔可以講一句？」，並回應早前庭上統一以「evil law」作為「惡法」的英文翻譯，她表示：「我覺得用 draconian 準確啲。」法官李運騰則回應，為了確保所有人都知道談論同一件事，有需要使用一致的翻譯字眼，否則會引致含糊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年5月21日《蘋果日報》報導，題為〈黎智英：修例後香港玩完 FCC演講斥林鄭非常邪惡〉。控方特別指出，報導另提及黎稱從沒有感到疲累，「因為需要負起作為反對聲音的責任，而這令我的人生非常有意義」，但黎「也笑言日後一旦修例成功，他或是時候退休」。法官李運騰質疑控方提問與案件是否相關：「我們沒有興趣知道黎先生想退休與否。」控方則表示這與稍後的提問有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「反惡法」這個主題是否由2019年4月起，直到5月都沒有變過？陳確認「係」。她續指，因為當時政府正在推行修改法例程序，「民間都仍然有就住呢條條例討論，咁泛民都有評論想政府擱置呢條條例啦」，而且從報導可見，「咁呀黎生都仲有嚟反對呢條條例啦，所以我哋都會有呢啲報導。」控方追問黎的新聞如何與事件相關？陳指：「啫係佢都好鮮明咁反對呢條條例。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年5月31日的訊息紀錄，黎向陳轉發前《蘋果日報》社長、著名作家董橋的訊息，董稱：「Jimmy，出來號召民眾上街的人選非常重要。」，又建議訪問民主黨創黨主席李柱銘和天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機，「你們的報紙每天有個方塊讓有份量的人說幾句『送中』看法，六月九日的人數會多很多。我們要鼓吹的不是香港要民主，我們要求鼓吹的是香港的價值不容共產黨摧殘。」黎著陳：「下午有時間談談董橋建議。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，黎希望她6月9日之前「搵多啲有分量嘅人講吓對《逃犯條例》嘅憂慮」，因為「佢（黎）覺得再由泛民嘅人講，太冇新意，叫我搵啲新嘅人講」。她便按照黎的指示，與同事商量，盡量找一些不同人士談論《逃犯條例》，雖然不可能聯絡法官做訪問，但也會盡量找法律界人士受訪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（6日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第24日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。《蘋果日報》在2019年7月1日隨報附送特刊《逆權六月》，法官李運騰問及為何特刊是免費派發而不是售賣，陳則指希望讀者能多買報紙，以示對運動的支持，又能收宣傳之效。她一度就「逆權」的英文翻譯表達見解，指譯作「Struggle」會較「Revolution」更準確。控方問「逆權運動」一詞是否源自特刊《逆權六月》這名稱。陳則指「逆權」兩字其實原初在中文並不常用，但數年前韓國推出幾套電影均以「逆權」為題，包括《逆權司機》和《逆權大狀》，所以「逆權」才開始為香港普羅大眾所認識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方早上就2019年4至5月的事件提問，陳形容黎智英鮮明地反對修例，並非常重視4月28日的反送中遊行。控方下午繼而就2019年6月的事件提問，陳沛敏確認黎智英當時仍然是重視抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示 WhatsApp 訊息紀錄，在6月9日反送中大遊行之前，黎向陳稱：「沛敏，我們應該找些聯署學生訪問，激發其他學生6.9出來。謝謝。」陳確認收到訊息後，有著同事去做學生訪問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏確認對百萬人上街感高興-黎就頭條標題給予建議&quot;&gt;陳沛敏確認對百萬人上街感高興 黎就頭條標題給予建議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年6月9日的訊息紀錄，當天有超過一百萬人參與反送中大遊行。黎在下午向陳稱有很多人上街，陳回覆：「是的，今天會很多人」，黎續稱：「應該超過一百萬！」陳在晚上再傳訊息：「愈夜愈美麗」及「103萬」。控方問，陳和黎是否都對過百萬人參與遊行感到高興？陳同意：「係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示同日訊息，前《蘋果日報》社長、著名作家董橋向黎稱：「Jimmy，你和你的報紙的努力沒有白費！為勇敢的香港人乾杯！」黎回覆董：「Haha！對，為勇敢的香港人乾杯！好！我告訴沛敏，這是個好標題，謝謝。」其後黎將上述兩則訊息轉發給陳，並說：「沛敏，董橋以上說，為勇敢香港人乾！會是個好標題，請看是否適合，謝謝。」陳則回覆：「好的，我們研究一下，或用地道的語言表達這意思。謝謝」，黎回覆：「好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年6月10日的《蘋果日報》頭版，標題為〈香港人漂亮的固執 1,030,000〉。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日訊息紀錄顯示，「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）曾向陳沛敏傳送一則《蘋果》網上新聞連結，題為〈【引渡惡法】「香港監察」羅哲斯拍片撐港人上街：通過修例如判香港死刑〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英認為暫緩修例只是策略-616前夕頭版籲上街-與黎意見一致&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英認為暫緩修例只是策略 6.16前夕頭版籲上街 與黎意見一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，黎智英於2019年6月14日向陳傳送訊息：「胡志偉他估計待6月尾的G20峰會習近平主席和特朗普會面過後，市民抗議聲音減少，令習主席不會在美國面前丟面後，條例就會捲土重來。」黎又稱：「我們只好行動日漸加劇，迎接詭計來臨！」、「不撤一散（不撤不散）！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年6月15日的《蘋果日報》頭版，題為〈惡法擬暫緩但不撤，遊行前夕，林鄭緩兵，明天照上街〉，並問此報紙標題與黎的意見有沒有關係。陳表示：「都有嘅」，雖然當時政府宣布暫緩修例，但是黎認為此舉「只係一個策略」，「要撤回先至可以達到嗰個目的囉。」她認同頭版標題與黎的意見一致，因她考慮標題時「係有考慮佢嘅意見」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年6月26日的訊息，黎智英告知陳沛敏，他已落了飛機，陳問黎是否需要記者採訪他參與遊行。陳解釋，因為黎是一名公眾人物，「睇吓佢使唔使派記者去採訪佢遊行」。控方指黎使自己變成新聞的一部份，問陳會否同意此說法，陳同意：「係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;七一蘋果附送逆權六月特刊-官問為何免費派發而非售賣賺錢&quot;&gt;七一《蘋果》附送《逆權六月》特刊 官問為何免費派發而非售賣賺錢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年7月1日的《蘋果日報》頭版，題為〈惡法未撤回 林鄭未下台 今日再上街〉，頭版上方寫有「隨報送《逆權六月》特刊」。陳解釋，該特刊主要將攝影師所拍攝的反送中事件和示威遊行照片結集。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，為何《蘋果日報》要隨報附送特刊或海報？陳表示，因為他們估計大部份《蘋果》讀者都是反對修例，加上早前有百萬人上街，相信很多人會想保存該特刊。李官續指，問題重點是，為何《蘋果》不打算售賣該特刊來賺錢，而是免費地派發？陳表示：「如果要印到好靚嘅話先至會有人買囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問，既然讀者不論如何都會支持這份報紙，為何仍要大費周章？還是這是一種宣傳方式？陳回應：「都可以話係一個宣傳。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上將逆權譯成revolution-陳沛敏認為譯struggle較準確&quot;&gt;庭上將「逆權」譯成「revolution」 陳沛敏認為譯「struggle」較準確&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏其後就「逆權」一詞的英文翻譯表達見解，因之前庭上將《逆權六月》翻譯成「Revolution June」，惟陳認為將「逆權」翻譯成「struggle」會較準確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂問她是否同意「權」可譯作「authority」或「power」。陳同意，並指可理解為「當權嘅人或組織」。法官杜麗冰問陳是否意指「政府」？陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「逆」字，陳表示理解為：「反對當權者。簡單啲嚟講，好似法官咁講，反對政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏逆權兩字起初在中文不常用-韓國電影以逆權為名-香港人始認識&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：「逆權」兩字起初在中文不常用 韓國電影以「逆權」為名 香港人始認識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，陳想透過這本特刊達到什麼目的？是想用作宣傳還是賺錢？陳認為「兩者都有」，當然他們希望讀者買多些《蘋果日報》，「都係對呢個運動支持的表現。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，「逆權運動」這詞經常出現於《蘋果日報》，問是否源於特刊名稱「逆權六月」？陳表示「我唔肯定」，因「逆權」兩字其實原初在中文並不常用，但數年前韓國推出幾套電影均以「逆權」為題，包括《逆權司機》和《逆權大狀》，所以「逆權」才開始為香港普羅大眾所認識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何要用「逆權」而不用「反政府」一詞，陳指當時香港經歷了6.9和6.16兩次大遊行，要概括兩次遊行的話，「諗住用呢兩個字，唔使咁直接⋯⋯概括啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，若要比較「反送中」和「逆權」兩個詞語，哪一個反抗程度會較強？陳回答：「反送中係講緊條條例嘛，咁 『權』就係講緊嗰政府囉。」李官指，「逆權」的重點並不是太在於修例草案，而是較著重政府的行為，問陳是否同意。陳表示：「可以咁講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭之前，法官杜麗冰指「逆權」一詞不太容易理解，籲控辯雙方律師團隊集思廣益，商討出一個最貼切的英文翻譯，又指不能依靠證人對該詞的理解去翻譯。代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻則指，以陳沛敏處理「逆權」這詞的經驗，以及她從流行文化、韓國電影理解「逆權」的意思，她確實有基礎提出其見解。法官李運騰則認為要證人處理翻譯是不公平，況且有需要就字詞的翻譯達至統一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessments of the state of the Islamic State, including of its branches, are routinely released by policy makers and official sources. These assessments, however, are often divergent. The UN monitoring reports, based on data fed by member states indicate numbers that fluctuate wildly year on year, depending on the member state. The same agency might release contrasting figures, such as the US Forces Afghanistan’s assessment of the strength of the Islamic State in Khorasan (IS-K) before the Taliban takeover in 2021. For years it was kept at an astonishingly low 1,000 members, until it was suddenly raised to 5,000 in spring 2019, without much explanation. While assessments by the US military were mostly keeping IS-K numbers low, Russian official sources tended to do the exact opposite. Hence the need for an independent, fresh assessment of just how powerful IS-K is, one of the aims of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other aim of this paper is to analyse how IS-K coped with the emerging challenge posed by the Taliban in power in Kabul. Even as recently as the summer of 2023, the predominant view among analysts was that IS-K was in good shape, in part at least because of its efforts to project its activities regionally. Acknowledging IS-K’s internal difficulties has been rare. This paper shows that IS-K has been increasingly struggling in Afghanistan, but also that it has been to adapt to a very considerable extent. The question this paper seeks to answer is what this adaptation is turning IS-K into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the conflict is still underway, any findings of this paper can be only partial and preliminary. With no access to primary written sources, there are limitations by necessity to the research methodology adopted: primarily oral sources, supported by news reports. The reader should be aware that researching this topic required several methodological compromises, as reaching out to sources in the context of Afghanistan under the Taliban is extremely difficult. IS-K recruiters and members were the most difficult ones to speak to. As a result, the body of data collected is inevitably incomplete; gaps abound, and following up on specific themes was often not possible. The analysis contained in the paper inevitably reflects this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis is based on a series of fifty-five interviews, carried out between March 2021 and June 2023 with ten Taliban officials, sixteen IS-K cadres and members, eight former IS-K members, twelve Salafi elders, Ulema and other elders, four members of the Tehrik Taliban Pakistan, two Hawala traders, one IS Central cadre, one Iranian official, and one local source. The interviews were carried out by three researchers who did not know each other, to avoid the risk of collusion in manipulating the content of the interviews. The interviewees were told that their answers would be used in a publication, the type of which was not specified. All the interviews have been anonymised and all data that could lead to the identification of interviewees has been removed. The risk that respondents could use the interviews to influence or misrepresent the facts was assumed from the start as a precautionary measure. This risk was mitigated by using different types of sources, representing contrasting points of views, by interviewing individuals separately and without them being aware of other interviews taking place, and by inserting questions where the answer was already known. Public-domain sources have also been used, where available, to check the credibility of interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is organised into several sections. The first one discusses IS-K’s initial strategy against the Taliban’s Emirate. The second section addresses how that strategy started appearing as a dead end during 2022. The third section shows how IS-K sought to adapt its strategy. The fourth and final section discusses how IS-K’s crisis deepened in 2023 and was still very serious as of January 2024, when this paper was drafted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ks-challenge-to-the-taliban-in-2021-22&quot;&gt;IS-K’s challenge to the Taliban in 2021-22&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has long been a debate on whether IS-K was really closely connected to the central leadership of the Islamic State (IS-C), rather than being a group of opportunists who tried to exploit the 2014-15 successes of IS-C for fundraising and recruitment purposes. That IS-K still existed in 2018-23 despite the decline of the Caliphate in Syria and in Iraq bears witness to the fact that its emergence was not just due to opportunism. Over the years, IS-C sought the original, heterogeneous mix of groups into a more ideological, Salafi-jihadist organisation. The transformation was quite successful, helped by the high casualty rate incurred by the first generation of joiners. By 2021, IS-K was a largely Salafi organisation, with a strong a committed hard core of ideologically motivated members. For the largest part of its existence, IS-K was heavily dependent on funding accruing from IS-C, but the latter allowed IS-K a degree of autonomy in choosing its leaders — if the process was smooth and not too divisive. During the period discussed in this paper, however, the decline and crisis of IS-C started posing major challenges to IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban takeover in August 2021 was no good news for IS-K. The Taliban had been IS-K’s primary enemy, and it could be expected that they would turn on the IS-K as soon as feasible after power consolidation. The leadership of IS-K decided to catch the Taliban off guard while the latter were busy setting up their government and suffering from manpower shortages. Tens of cells were transferred to the cities, where in the following months they unleashed their most intense terror campaign yet. Not only in Kabul and Jalalabad, where IS-K had been active for years, but also Kunduz, Kandahar, Charikar, Herat and Mazar-I Sharif. In addition, IS-K sought to unleash a guerrilla campaign in eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban initially struggled to cope, especially in the cities where they had no counter-terrorism experience. Provincial officials of the Emirate in eastern Afghanistan adopted extreme measures against the Salafi community, widely believed to be largely supportive of IS-K, including death squad tactics in Nangarhar and systematic closures of Salafi mosques and madrasas. This deeply antagonised the Salafi community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IS-K terror campaign peaked in the first half of 2022 and started losing steam in the second half of the year, as the Taliban were finally getting on top of the counter-terrorism challenge. From a peak of between five to ten guerrilla attacks and over ten bomb attacks per month during the first half of 2022, IS-K activity fell to between two and five guerrilla attacks and three to six bomb attacks in the second half of the year (see graph 1 ). By then it could be argued that the guerrilla campaign in the east had declined to negligible levels, as confirmed by local observers too. The terror campaign in the cities was beginning to falter too, however. Moreover, there were no signs that terror attacks in the cities were achieving much in terms of destabilising the Emirate, which was gradually also overcoming its initial manpower shortages. Despite still being short of cash, in January 2022 the Emirate quickly upgraded its plans for army and police, overseeing the gradual expansion of the army towards a target of at least 150,000 men, and the police to as many as 60,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K’s main aim with its 2021-22 offensive was likely to buy time, while it restructured to face the mutating threat represented by the Taliban. The process of strengthening its presence in the north of Afghanistan had already started by 2020 but intensified after the Taliban takeover. The residual overt presence of IS-K — limited by August 2021 to some areas of Nuristan and Kunar — started being disposed of, as IS-K moved entirely underground and began relying exclusively on mobile bases and training camps. In its new shape, IS-K had little use for large numbers of foreign fighters — mostly Pakistanis, followed by Central Asians as the second largest group — and the bulk of them started being moved to Pakistan either to Tirah valley, where had some bases, or to the cities, primarily Peshawar. IS-K also massively intensified its online and social media operations, presumably with multiple intents such as distracting the Taliban from its delicate transition, exchanging face-to-face with remote recruitment, enhancing fund raising, and keeping an increasingly dispersed membership together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All considered, the leadership of IS-K managed the transition quite efficiently, taking limited casualties. However, the Taliban’s Emirate had not just been increasing the size of its armed forces. Its intelligence apparatus adapted to its new tasks, building an extensive intelligence network in the cities. During 2022 the Taliban started busting IS-K cells in the cities, and terrorist attacks stopped in Kunduz, Charikar and Jalalabad. Several cells were also destroyed in Kabul, Mazar-i Sharif, and Herat (see Graph 1 for figures). The Taliban’s intelligence also started infiltrating IS-K social media operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K’s adaptation also faced some structural limitations. The increasingly dispersed character of the organisation made its trademark centralised command and control unfeasible. The group likely also faced a shortage of cadres, as the cells compromised in the cities during 2022 often included quite senior members. It would be odd for IS-K to move senior figures to the frontlines, unless it faced major command and control issues and/or a shortage of cadres. The expansion of IS-K’s presence in the cities, relying on an underground structure of small cells, required a much more cadre-heavy staffing than the guerrilla operations had demanded. IS-K tried to intensify recruitment of new cadres, but the Taliban’s crackdown on Salafi madrasas (outside Kunar province) choked a major source of recruits. IS-K had to rely increasingly on recruiting university students, itself a complicated matter due to heavy Taliban scrutiny over the campuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, IS-K appears to have been able to maintain its numbers between August 2021 and autumn 2022. During this period, IS-K sources were putting total membership at around 8,000 between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Considering that a substantial portion of these were in Pakistan at any given time, these numbers are well within the range of estimates by governments reporting to the UN monitoring committee. This is not quite as good as it seems, given that this membership level is close to its lowest during 2015-21, but at least numbers did not fall. Of the 8,000 or so members, at least a third were in non-combat roles (support, intelligence, admin), and of the 5,000 or so fighters a substantial portion were Salafi villagers who had joined to protect their communities and were poorly motivated to follow IS-K very far. The Salafi community had felt threatened when the Taliban appeared in eastern Afghanistan in strength from 2009 onwards. Having failed to obtain protection from the government, they welcomed IS-K when it turned up years later, as a force capable of protecting them. It is a common tale, heard from surrendered IS-K members, that many Salafi elders were encouraging villagers to join IS-K, whose teams had regular meetings with them, encouraging them to mobilise villagers. Especially among these villagers, morale was low in 2021 already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ks-campaign-in-crisis-winter-2022-23&quot;&gt;IS-K’s Campaign in Crisis: Winter 2022-23&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban reacted to IS-K’s challenge more quickly and with greater sophistication than expected, ordering its provincial officials to avoid indiscriminate repression of the Salafis and promoting instead efforts to reconcile IS-K members, by both involving community elders and offering reintegration packages. Although arbitrary violence against suspect IS-K members and sympathisers — peaking in the first few months after regime change — did not stop altogether, the Taliban’s efforts were quite successful; in Nangarhar province a few hundred IS-K insurgents reconciled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the winter of 2022-23 it was clear that the campaign launched by IS-K was not achieving much success in undermining the Taliban’s Emirate. Although IS-K managed to sustain the pace of its terrorist attacks in Kabul and to start a campaign in Mazar-I Sharif — and in Herat, to some extent — its campaign in Jalalabad failed and the campaigns in Kunduz and Kandahar could not be sustained. Indeed, an IS-K source mentioned in April 2023 that Kabul, Mazar-i Sharif, and Herat were the cities where their urban terror cells were concentrated. Even in Kabul, IS-K had been taking several hits. The same IS-K source acknowledged that in February 2023 the head of the special military commission for Kabul, Qari Saheb Fateh, was “martyred” by the Taliban. Interestingly, according to an IS-K cadre, as of April 2023 no replacement had been appointed yet, again suggesting that the Taliban counter-terrorism campaign might be causing a shortage of senior cadres. Another IS-K source acknowledged that recruitment teams took several hits in Kabul, Nangarhar and Kunar, with members arrested or killed; only Badakhshan remaining untouched. These hits resulted in much reduced activities, especially in Kabul, where, after one terrorist attack on 11 January 2023 and one on 27 March 2023, there was a lull of seven months with no successful IS-K attack. Both these attacks targeted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ending up with detonations outside the Ministry, resulting in civilian casualties but little damage to the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K propaganda regularly claims it is strengthening recruitment, has the support of 70% of the population in the east and north-east, and even that it is attracting growing numbers of sympathisers in the south as well. Ironically, when comparing claims made by internal IS-K sources on recruitment alongside previous claims (see above), this reveals in fact that overall IS-K numbers were declining significantly in late 2022 and into early 2023: falling to 7,000 by the beginning of 2023. In practice, IS-K’s presence in Afghanistan was shrinking even faster, as an increasing number of its members were being moved to Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious that the Taliban’s efforts to reconcile IS-K members through negotiations with the elders was making a dent in the latter’s self-confidence. Although the pace of the surrenders slowed during the end of last year and in recent months, in early 2023 another 100 reportedly surrendered in Nangarhar, later acknowledged by IS-J sources. According to one former member, even some of the reinforcements sent by IS-K to Nangarhar from Kunar decided quickly to surrender. Similarly, the campaign to attract Taliban members was clearly lagging. Despite IS-K propaganda touting successes in infiltrating the Taliban, there is little evidence of success. In fact, open defections to IS-K, which were never high, appear to have slowed down to a near halt between the beginning of 2022 and mid-2023. The Taliban dismissed the few defectors as people expelled for bad behaviour or who quit for not having been offered prestigious jobs within the ranks of the Emirate. For example, one of the few cases of Taliban joining IS-K during that period was that of a minor commander called Sangari; in January 2023 Sangari defected to IS-K with his three men in Lal Poor district, after the Emirate failed to give him a job. While the Taliban might well be reluctant to acknowledge defections from their ranks, as late as June 2023 a senior source in IS-K could not provide concrete examples of recent defections and talked instead of “negotiations” with “several groups of Taliban in different provinces” over their defection to IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting this reality, IS-K propaganda has shifted from defections towards claims of infiltration of the Taliban. One known case of an official of the Emirate detained on allegations of having links to IS-K was that of Obaidullah Mobariz, the Emirate’s Chief of Police for Panjshir’s Shotul district — detained on 16 January 2023. Mobariz had been detained by the previous government for links to IS-K. The Emirate appointed him and seemingly was unaware of his past until his suspicious behaviour attracted attention; a serious security lapse. There were also allegations, relaunched by IS-K sources, of receiving internal help for their attack on the governor of Balkh — Muzamil — in March 2023. However, few other attacks carried out by IS-K after the Taliban takeover suggest insider support. Typically, these attacks were failures in terms of attempts to break through Taliban security belts. The few successful ones were mostly against pro-Taliban clerics, who did not occupy official positions within the Emirate and were not protected by the Taliban’s security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K’s difficulties are also evident from their 2023 propaganda efforts on Telegram, encouraging members to escalate jihadi activities during the holy month of Ramadan (22 March-20 April 2023); embarrassingly, IS-K activities during that month were at their lowest level ever. A more implicit admission of the group’s decline in Nangarhar was a letter published by them, warning of retaliation to those extorting money from shopkeepers and other citizens of Jalalabad in the name of IS-K. While the letter’s intent was likely to show that IS-K still had power, as it encouraged the shopkeepers to report extortion to its intelligence service, the letter also revealed that small time gangsters were not afraid of IS-K anymore; perhaps even that isolated and under-funded IS-K members were now on the loose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ks-adaptation&quot;&gt;IS-K’s Adaptation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an IS-K cadre, during 2022 the leadership of IS-K decided to adapt its strategy: it abandoned any short-term plans to hold or re-gain territory, even in the remotest parts of the country, and instead focusing on targeting cadres and leaders of the Taliban and intensifying recruitment efforts. The aim of challenging the Taliban’s territorial control remained but was moved to the long-term. In line with this, during 2022 IS-K gave up on plans to wage a guerrilla campaign in Kunar, the primary intent of which had been to force the Taliban to pull out of parts of the province. The assessment of a member of the Taliban’s General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) was that by early 2023 there was little IS-K activity in Kunar: “they have some hideouts in the mountains and in the valleys, but they don’t have permanent military bases in Kunar province”. The source believed that IS-K was facing morale issues, with members reluctant to fight, even if not ready to surrender to the Taliban: “Because there are lots of places for hiding out in the valleys and mountain, these Khawarij Daesh prefer to stay there, rather than surrender to the Taliban”. As noted above in IS-K’s challenge to the Taliban, IS-K have faced morale issues, so this GDI officer’s assessment is plausible. However, he also acknowledged that while “local villagers received warnings from the Taliban, not to support [IS-K], some Salafi families and communities” were still “secretly supporting [IS-K] members and offering safe haven in their villages”. While the source estimated in March 2023 that IS-K had been crushed in Nangarhar province, large scale IS-K activity underground still existed within Kunar province. Overall, only 30-40 members of IS-K were confirmed to have surrendered in Kunar, as opposed to more than 600 in Nangarhar (up to March 2023).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, IS-K was not finished yet. The group was re-organising and learning to rely on thinner, underground networks of cells in the villages, focusing on maintaining influence and keeping recruitment growing rather than fighting. In the words of a surrendered IS-K member: “During the night, [IS-K is] very powerful in the valleys and villages close to the mountains, but during the day they disappear”. Despite the decision to move north (see above), IS-K could not just abandon its strongholds in the east to their fate. According to a source in the Taliban, in March 2023 Kunar was also still functioning as the source of IS-K cells re-infiltrating other areas. Both Kunar and neighbouring Nuristan did not just supply cells to Nangarhar, but also to Kabul and possibly other provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A considerable proportion of IS-K forces in Kunar was nonetheless moved to Pakistan and to the north of Afghanistan during 2021-23. The relocation northwards had started slowly in mid-2020 but there is clear evidence that it started accelerating in 2022. IS-K sources placed the number of IS-K members in the north and north-east in early 2023 at least double the numbers present there in mid-2021. Even GDI sources confirmed in March 2023 the shift of IS-K members to the north-east, with a growing presence in the north as well. Several small bases were identified in Badakhshan and Kunduz, while there were believed to be several cells in Mazar-I Sharif. The north-east was believed to be supplying attack teams, composed of Central Asians, to Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transferring many members northwards was undoubtedly a considerable feat for IS-K. However, in terms of inflicting critical damage to the Emirate there, impact was limited. On 9 March 2023, the governor of Balkh, Mohammad Daud Muzamil — one of the most capable Helmandi commanders of the Emirate and a close ally of the Amir, Haibatullah — was assassinated in Mazar-i Sharif. This attack was part of a campaign of assassinations of Taliban officials; as of October 2023 these were only carried out in the new areas of IS-K activity: north, north-east, and west. Aside from Muzamil, the other main success of this campaign was the killing of Nissar Ahmad Ahmadi, the deputy governor of Badakhshan province, on 6 June 2023; this was followed two days later by a suicide bombing at Ahmadi’s funeral, killing three other Taliban dignitaries plus several bystanders. Low rank officials of the Emirate were also assassinated: Mohammad Nader Kakar, head of Herat’s Water Supply Department, in March 2023; director of mines Abdul Fattah, in Faizabad on 24 April 2022; security chief Abdulhaq Abu Omar also in Faizabad on 26 December 2022; and Rahman Munawar, the Taliban Head of Economy for Faryab province, on 10 October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although in the big scheme of things these attacks did not even get close to making the Taliban’s hold on northern Afghanistan implode, even the GDI acknowledged that the situation in Mazar-i Sharif was somewhat worrying. The GDI estimated in April 2023 that there were dozens of IS-K hideouts in Mazar, with some 200 members already based in the city and another 150 planning to move in. Based on the interrogation of the detainees, the GDI assessed that IS-K intended to destabilise the Emirate by attacking the northern cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2020, one major problem for IS-K in trying to spread through the north was that the organisation had a stronger Salafi character than when it was originally formed in 2014-15. Of the original crowd of former TTP and Taliban members, many of whom did not identify as Salafis, little was left by that time; IS-K rejected being characterised as a Salafist group. The Taliban’s assessment in 2022 was that IS-K was very dependent on the Salafi community for recruits. Even then, after the crackdown on Salafi madrasas of the previous months, the Taliban believed that some were still sending recruits to IS-K and planning to shut them down. While over 80% of the Afghan population follows the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, there is a small Salafi minority accounting for perhaps 2-3% of the population, mostly concentrated in eastern Afghanistan. Afghan Salafism is characterised by a much stricter textualist approach. All sources confirmed that by 2020 there were few Hanafis in IS-K in Nangarhar. In Kunar, the preponderance of Salafis was even greater. A former IS-K member of almost five years, who travelled around Kunar and Nuristan, says he never saw any non-Salafi members. As far as the north and the west are concerned, IS-K sources claimed a mixed membership in early 2023. One IS-K source said that while the majority of the members in Badakhshan were Salafis, Hanafis were the majority in the north, especially Jowzjan and Faryab. While this may well be true, there were few IS-K members in either Jowzjan or Faryab at that time. The IS-K leadership was aware that the strongly Salafi characterisation of IS-K was becoming a major issue and already in spring 2021 it decided to shift away from the recent years’ focus on recruiting Salafis and toward recruiting more Hanafi members. In reality, even in spring 2023 IS-K seemed to have limited hopes that large numbers of Hanafis would join. As an IS-K cadre acknowledged as late as April 2023: “Our priority is to recruit fighters from, and train them in, Kunar, Badakhshan, Kunduz and Nuristan”; that is, all provinces either with a largely Salafi population (Kunar and Nuristan), or with significant Salafi pockets (Badakhshan and, to a lesser extent, Kunduz).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part because of its lack of strong roots in almost all the north and north-east — the only major exception being some parts of Badakhshan — the move north implied moving even deeper underground for IS-K than was the case in the east, with most cells being completely isolated from society and from each other. This inevitably created command and control issues, which IS-K sought to manage with command decentralisation. A new structure was adopted, featuring three different centres of operations, each with full operational autonomy. As of April 2023, these main centres of operation were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kunar — responsible for eastern Afghanistan but also supporting operations in Kabul, sending in attack teams. The leadership of this operational centre was largely composed of Central Asians.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kabul — a “special military commission” responsible to operations in the capital.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Badakhshan — responsible for operations in the north and north-east.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second measure, to cope with command-and-control issues, was an even greater reliance on educated and ideologised cadres and members. The importance of ideologised cadres was stressed by a commander as key to keeping morale high:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IS-K always focused on recruitment of highly aware (Hoshyar) fighters from Sharia faculties and universities. Students who study Sharia in Afghanistan’s universities are mostly aware of Islam and they are very good in preaching and spreading Islam and teaching the rules applying to Mujahidin and the value of Jihad to the other fighters. They can improve the morale of other. This is why IS-K is focusing on Afghan universities to recruit students of the Sharia faculty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for decentralisation was all the stronger due to the need to protect the leadership. Having suffered heavy leadership losses since its inception, IS-K invested in securing its internal communications, designed to survive interception by the Americans. IS-K sources claimed these were quite advanced by April 2023. According to one source, “Dr. Shahab [al Muhajir, the governor of Khorasan] has his own technology team that manages communications between him and other members of the group”. Clearly, however, internal communications have been increasing in complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move underground also complicated recruitment and training. It is revealing that IS-K began experimenting with online learning for its members. In February 2023, a new Telegram channel was established to provide basic military training. The channel was called Funun-e-Nezami (Military Skills), and its members posted pictures of weapons alongside descriptions of the ways in which they can be used, including a range of guns and IEDs. Another IS-K channel dedicated to online military training was (Commandos of Caliphate), which was irregularly active. The option of training all members in person within proper camps was no longer available. The al-Afraad al-Arqam channel instead warned to avoid compromising mobile numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasingly evident is IS-K’s growing reliance on online propaganda, especially via social media. A mapping of IS-K activities on social media by the Centre for Information Resilience identified thirty Facebook groups run by either the group or its supporters, used for recruitment purposes. In addition, IS-K activists were also seen using at least twenty-four student, Salafi and Islamic interest groups on Facebook for spreading their propaganda. Typical themes found on these pages included complaints about the policies of the Taliban’s Emirate, such as the lack of religious freedom for Salafis under the Taliban and the perceived tolerance of the Taliban towards other religious sects in Afghanistan: Shi’as, Sikhs, and Hindus. A common propaganda topic in 2022-3 has been the Taliban’s relations with foreign governments unpopular with Islamic extremists: the US, Russia, China, Iran, and Pakistan, as well as with the EU and the UN. IS-K propaganda has also very obviously tried to exploit intra-ethnic tensions to its advantage, alleging that land conflict in the north-west is driving Uzbek Taliban to quit the organisation. However, IS-K propaganda also features more subjective claims, such as what they describe as the un-Islamic character of Taliban governance. Other claims are far-fetched, such as calling the Taliban “servants of the Pakistani ISI” (see below on Taliban-Pakistan relations) and accused of having been corrupted by the Americans; IS-K falsely claimed that the Taliban agreed in Doha to implement an American-designed democratic system in Afghanistan to protect pagans like Hindus, Shi’as, and Sufis. Even when claims have some grounds in reality, IS-K propaganda strongly manipulate them; for example claiming that the Taliban obeyed the “orders” of the UN. The same propaganda video featured a clip of Donald Trump saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I met with Taliban leaders; they promised me that they will fight against all terrorist groups and bad people in Afghanistan including ISKP, and that they would be our men who fight against terrorism and the ISKP mujahideen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K propaganda also makes good use of alarmist claims made by international governments and media concerning their capabilities and power. In the aforementioned video, for example, feature several speeches of leaders of Central Asia Republics, in which they speak of the threat to their countries from ISKP, of their concern that the strength of ISKP has grown to 6,500 fighters and of the presence of these fighters in northern Afghanistan which has long borders with Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key dimension of IS-K propaganda has been portraying itself as the creator and administrator of a utopian society. In March 2023 a new IS-K Telegram channel in Pashto and Dari dedicated to this strand of propaganda activities appeared, called Daastaan-e-Shab (Story of the Night), through which it shared accounts of its recruited members every Friday night. Every member was shown as being kind and hospitable, and as having sensitive aspects to his personality — as opposed to simply being bloodthirsty militants. The target of this propaganda seemingly was to inspire members of the Salafi community who are not already members of IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K’s social media effort eventually started running afoul of Taliban counterterrorism. It also ran into issues with Telegram, where many pro-IS-K accounts were banned in May 2023. IS-K in response started sharing with its members via its remaining Telegram channels standard OSINT best practices, which highlights the group’s sophistication with respect to social media. Users were being advised to flesh out their accounts by adding profile pictures to them, and to follow non-ISKP channels which cover topics as diverse as fashion to avoid drawing suspicion of being linked to a proscribed group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from going underground, decentralising and investing in an expanded social media campaign, IS-K also tried to undermine the Taliban’s reconciliation and reintegration efforts, bringing pressure on the elders to not facilitate negotiations between IS-K members and Taliban. One surrendering member heard from villagers that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daesh is trying a lot to undermine this process. Several elders who were secretly facilitating the negotiations and connecting IS-K members with the Taliban for their surrender have been threatened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others who surrendered confirmed the same, adding that threats consisted of death warnings and of burning homes down. IS-K also increased counter-intelligence efforts among its own ranks. These countermeasures were deemed to be effective former IS-K members, as they were under the impression that surrenders had either diminished in numbers or even ceased. A few surrendered IS-K members reportedly re-joined IS-K in Nangarhar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, IS-K invested considerable efforts trying to re-launch its campaign against the Emirate. These efforts appear to have reduced the impact of the Taliban’s counter-IS-K campaign. They did not, however, completely reverse the negative trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-k-on-the-brink-spring-2023&quot;&gt;IS-K on the Brink: Spring 2023&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, as discussed above, IS-K sought hard to adapt to the challenges posed by the Taliban, by spring 2023 it was in a very serious predicament. In part this was the result of the cumulative impact of counter-IS-K efforts by the Taliban. Despite keeping its overall level of activity low and limiting casualties, successful Taliban raids against IS-K cells in the cities appear to have made a dent on IS-K morale. While the actual number of killed in action, relative to the total strength of IS-K, might have been as low as four percent per year according to an internal source, these were mostly selected core members of urban cells. Although the total number of these core members is not known, the total size of the IS-K structure in the cities was certainly less than 1,000, with operational cells perhaps a third of that number and the rest being support elements. Hence, the casualty rate among these elite operational cells was certainly high. A senior source in IS-K acknowledged not just that the Taliban had busted several IS-K cells, but also that many safe houses had been seized, at great cost for the organisation. Moreover, IS-K sources might well understate the level of their casualties, either knowingly or because of being themselves fed disinformation by their leaders. At the end of May 2023, a source in Kunar, who was in regular contact with IS-K members, stated that he was hearing them complaining about being hit by the Taliban all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to understand that keeping clashes with the Taliban at a minimum was not without side effects. It was hardly a morale raiser for an insurgent organisation. There are indeed signs that the collapse of IS-K military activities was deepening IS-K’s morale crisis in spring 2023. The accelerating withdrawal into Pakistan was also bound to affect morale. IS-K propaganda tried to present the transfer of members to Pakistan as a demonstration of tactical skills, but as more and more members ended up in Pakistan, in many cases even dragging family members with them, the transfer must have been started looking more and more like a rout. An IS-K source indicated in April 2023 that almost two thirds of IS-K’s members were in Pakistan. Multiple sources within the TTP signalled an intensified presence of IS-K members in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan in spring 2023, not only in the traditional IS-K hideout of Tirah valley, but also in Orakzai, Bajaur and even in Peshawar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There deeper cause of the crisis was the worsening financial crisis, affecting IS-K in early 2023. Local elders in Kunar, in regular contact with the families of IS-K members, and sometimes with the members themselves, indicated that salaries to IS-K fighters — between $300 and $500 per month — had not been paid for months. While there were no reports of IS-K fighters forcing villagers to feed them, villagers were known to have started sending food to IS-K fighters hiding in the mountains. At the end of May 2023, a source in Kunar, who was in regular contact with IS-K members, stated that he was hearing them complaining about funds shortages. IS-K members reported to him having to asking for food in the villages; something never before reported. The elders also confirmed that IS-K had started collecting Zakat for the first time and “bring[ing] pressure on specific shopkeepers, businessmen and other rich people in the districts and in Asadabad city to pay for them. People are forced to pay them…”. Extortion from local businesses in Salafi communities was something new for IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, the crisis was the result of the Taliban getting better at making it harder for IS-K to transfer money into Afghanistan via the hawala system. Already in September 2022, an IS-K source acknowledged that just three hawala traders in all of Afghanistan were willing to do transfers for IS-K. Hawala traders reported intensifying Taliban controls, with the enforcement of rules dictating the registration of personal details, including IDs, for each transaction. The traders reported their feeling that while in the past some Hawala traders were ready to take some risk and accept transfers of large sums by dubious individuals without registering the transactions, by spring 2023 the risk was becoming too high. The situation was compounded by the fact that the Turkish authorities in November 2022 cracked down on the main IS-K financial hub, leading to the detention of twenty cadres who were used to transfer money via the hawala system. Although IS-K was able to partially replace the lost capabilities, some damage was permanent. At the end of May 2023, a source in Kunar, who was in regular contact with IS-K members, received hints that receiving hawala transfers from abroad was no longer possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The financial issues faced by IS-K were not entirely of the Taliban’s making, however. For years IS-K had been experiencing some unreliability from the IS central leadership regarding financial commitments. For example, in 2021 the central leadership only delivered half of the funds originally allocated. In 2022, the level of funding remained relatively modest, but promises of a big increase in funding for 2023 were made. The first signs, at the time of writing, were that these promises were far from being met in 2023 either. Although assessing the wealth of Islamic State is always difficult, there were signs that in 2022-23 its fundraising effort was lagging; sources mentioned “on-going efforts”, such as visits to various Gulf countries, but little in terms of actual donations. In April 2023 a source in the IS finance commission for Iraq mentioned that orders had been issued to transfer stockpiles of cash from Iraq to Turkey. Presumably, IS Central too was low in new funds and forced to rely on its reserves to keep going. As for why the external funding to IS has slowed down, it is too complex a topic to be addressed in this paper; suffice to say, a source within the Iranian government indicated that, as part of the agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia of 10 March 2023, the Saudis committed to block any support accruing to IS from their country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional evidence points towards difficulties with funding from even potentially sympathetic donors: a senior source in IS-K revealingly commented that “Islamic donors pay every group according to the activities of that group; we invested lots of money for a long-term offensive against our enemies”. He further explained that “IS-K in the past two years have invested lots of money in transferring members from one province of Afghanistan to another and from one region to another and also spent money on building and renting houses in different provinces of Afghanistan, buying weapons and other expenses”, but then the Taliban’s crackdown hit hard. The same source confirmed that in recent months IS-K faced “some financial problem” and that IS-K had to ask sympathisers in Afghanistan and Pakistan to help with cash donations and pay taxes like Zakat for the first time, as mentioned above by the elders of Kunar. He also implicitly admitted that IS-K members might be relying on food donations from sympathisers and relatives, whereas in the past IS-K had proudly stated the ability of its logistics to feed its fighters without having to rely on the villagers. He claimed that the leaderships of IS-K and IS was working to fix the problem with “Islamic governments and Salafi charities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s counter-IS-K operations and IS-K’s financial issues both contributed to forcing the group to slow down operations, according to the senior source mentioned above. The difficult financial and military situation has also led to the re-emergence of internal fissures. A local source in Kunar, well connected with IS-K members, said that his contacts revealed tensions and struggles within the leadership about the negative trend, with talks of yet another strategy being in the works and rumours of changes at the leadership level. The same senior source already mentioned a problem of “weak leadership of some people” and the “betrayal” of others, who reported about several cells and hideouts to the Taliban. He acknowledged that “there were some internal tensions”, but quickly added that they had been resolved by June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ks-hopes-for-recovery-summer-2023&quot;&gt;IS-K’s Hopes for Recovery: Summer 2023&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have seen above, the spring crisis had complex and converging causes, some of which were upstream in the IS-K funding system. Given that funding was obviously key to IS-K’s viability, the organisation moved quickly to seek solutions. IS-K tried hard to figure out how to transfer some cash to Afghanistan, without going through the Afghan hawala sector; cross-border trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan as a covert way to transfer money to its forces within the latter. In June, one courier was caught with a lot of cash, just after crossing from Pakistan, according to local sources. Another technique for transferring money adopted by IS-K in the summer was sending goods (such as oil) into Afghanistan from both Pakistan and Central Asia as if they were being traded. IS-K members would then sell them on the market and keep the entire amount. Cryptocurrencies also appear to have become one of IS-K’s favourite ways of moving money. IS-K magazine Voice of Khurasan called for donations in cryptocurrency via Monero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K also sought to increase local revenue, for example by cooperating with kidnappers’ gangs for ransom. Extortion of money from wealthy individuals in eastern Afghanistan continued. However, given the lack of territorial control, as one IS-K source acknowledged in August 2023, tax collection did not amount to much compared to the amount IS-K had been able to obtain in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, by the summer of 2023, the financial situation was improving somewhat, at least in part because of the counter-measures discussed above. By October 2023, demands for food had completely stopped. Some IS-K members, who had been taking small loans (10,000-15,000 Afs) to feed their teams in Spring, were talking of returning the loans thanks to the improved financial situation. The financial recovery of IS-K should not be overstated, however: as one source noted, the payment of salaries was still suspended. One IS-K source in Kunar commented in October that “We have managed to restore capability and regain the trust of our financial partners and are faring much better than we were some months ago”. He then added that “If we compare the Islamic State’s current financial situation to what it was two years ago when the Americans surrendered in Afghanistan to the apostate Taliban, it can be said that we still have financial problems. However, compared to how things were six months ago, we are much better now….” The feeling was that IS-K had recovered from the nadir reached in the spring when it could not even feed its fighters, but was still far from having reached even the funding levels of late 2021-early 2022. Indeed extortion from local businessmen, a recent innovation, continued. Neither IS-K combat strength returned to the level of 2021. Under the new conditions, IS-K had to rely in Afghanistan largely on Afghan members, whereas in the past of its combat force was made up of Pakistanis. One IS-K source estimated in October 2023 that “around 80%” of IS-K’s fighters were Afghans, the rest being mainly from Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports also started emerging that recruitment in Kunar restarted, including in some Salafi madrasas. There were also reports of IS-K beginning to invest again in rebuilding its urban networks. A weapons smuggler in Kunar, with whom IS-K had accumulated a debt due to its insolvency in spring, indicated in August that IS-K had just paid cash to him for a weapons shipment. By October, IS-K guerrilla activities in Kunar reached the apparent rate of an attack every few days, causing limited casualties to the Taliban — one to two killed per attack even according to IS-K’s own claims on social media. As IS-K members flowed back into Kunar, they also started establishing more underground structures, such as training centres in areas of difficult access. The Taliban were forced to increase patrols again. In Afghanistan as a whole, throughout June - August 2023 there was an upsurge in IS-K attacks from April and May, when no attacks took place (Graph 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the summer of 2023 onwards, IS-K also resumed dispatching cells to previously unaffected northern cities, such as Pul-i Khumri, where on 13 October 2023 it was able to bomb a Shi’a Mosque, killing seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K continued to adapt its propaganda to the new strategic environment. The more it had to reduce the scale of its violent activities, the more IS-K maintained an aggressive attitude, constantly threatening attacks against the Taliban and the West, to the point that the discrepancy with reality became more and more noticeable even on pro-IS-K social media. IS-K also began extending the threats to Sunni clerics. In October 2023 pro-IS-K media outlet al-Mursalat started threatening Afghan ulema into not complying with the Taliban’s demands to condemn IS-K in their sermons. During the summer of 2023, IS-K media intensified propaganda efforts aimed at the ethnic minorities, with a special focus on Panjshiris — still believed to be supportive of other opposition groups, such as the National Resistance Front — warning them that the western countries would not help them and pointing out how the old leaders betrayed them. Despite rising Taliban-Shi’a tension in the summer, IS-K propaganda continued accusing the Taliban of protecting the Shi’a community and reproduced videos of members of the Taliban security forces proudly stating their duty of protecting the Shi’as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly, IS-K also began utilising social media for purposes other than propaganda. Online IS-K chats highlighted in September 2023 how recent online recruits in areas remote from IS-K bases are cut off and unable to participate in activities for now. In one such chat, Ghamgin-o-Gharibam, the following exchange took place:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chat member: “While we cannot migrate to Caliphate areas because we lack territory in Khurasan, how can we attack our enemy? We also don’t have weapons.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Admin response: “Very soon the way for emigrating to the Caliphate ground will be opened.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chat member: “By when? Our friends are being arrested daily and we also fear being detained.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The admin agreed to teach basic military methods and promised that it would commence training with a lesson called “How to Carry Out a Guerrilla Attack Against Enemies in Cities”. IS-K was discouraging new members from travelling to its concentration areas, presumably for security reasons. Hence, one of the intentions behind investment in propaganda was to boost the morale of increasingly dispersed members and to convince them that the jihad was succeeding. IS-K tried to diminish the Taliban’s achievements and to stimulate revenge among IS-K members, for example claiming that the Taliban had deliberately killed IS-K family members during their raids against city cells. It is noteworthy that IS-K media channels would seek to reassure members about the prospect of being detained by the Taliban, with promises of freeing all detainees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While IS-K was somewhat energised by the relative improvement of its financial streams, even in the summer of 2023 it seemed to be struggling to identify a viable strategy and was instead focusing on trying to maintain its core structure, while the lower ranks shrank, waiting for the Taliban to make mistakes. One IS-K source in Kunar noted that in the summer of 2023 the “new” strategy adopted by the leadership of IS-K consisted of: hit and run attacks; attacks on IS-K defectors; attacks on Taliban leaders and commander; and attacks on Taliban Imams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This strategy is not new, and repeats what IS-K has been doing since August 2021: keeping its core structure as safe as possible, while waiting for opportunities. From time to time, some developments do play in IS-K’s favour, at least temporarily. Repeated efforts to infiltrate the Taliban occasionally bear fruit, thanks to the growing frustration of ethnic minority Taliban with their Pashtun leaders and persistent general ethnic tension in the north. According to an elder previously connected to the Public Uprising Forces — a militia sponsored by the intelligence services of the previous regime — IS-K is indeed targeting former militiamen for recruitment, at least in northern Takhar. The source himself sounded quite sympathetic to IS-K and may have joined its membership. These recruits seem motivated largely by the desire of obtaining protection against the Taliban, as well as a thirst for revenge. As far as disgruntled Taliban are concerned, in October 2023 the Taliban detained four of their commanders, all Tajiks, in north-eastern Afghanistan, on accusation of having links to IS-K. Local Taliban sources reported that among the Tajik Taliban of the north-east there is widespread dissatisfaction at what they describe as their marginalisation by Pashtuns within the organisation. IS-K is aware of these tensions and proactively courts Tajiks commanders, some of whom are believed to be cooperating with it smuggling weapons and other logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IS-K also positioned itself to exploit worsening Kabul-Islamabad relations; its attacks in Pakistan during 2022-23 could be interpreted as an attempt to put pressure on Islamabad, perhaps with a “support vs immunity from IS-K terrorism” trade-off in mind. Such deals were reported in the past, and the Taliban claim that they are still in place today, though they appear to have long fallen off. The Pakistani authorities bear grudges concerning the Emirate giving hospitality to the Tehrik Taliban Pakistan (TTP), so the concept is not far-fetched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this strategy were the case, then, IS-K has so far failed, possibly because at the same time it was also courting the TTP — the biggest insurgent group opposed to the Pakistani government. These efforts appeared to have a more realistic chance of success, due to the Taliban’s effort to restrain foreign jihadists based on their territory. While the TTP was able to resist such efforts better than other groups, serious friction with the Taliban occurred. Tension peaked after the Chitral fighting (September 2023), when the Taliban detained tens of TTP members who were on their way back to Afghanistan, prompting more anger and resulting in high level TTP-Taliban talks to defuse tension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taliban leaders sought repeatedly to convince the TTP to avoid carrying out raids into Pakistan from Afghan territory and avoid recruiting Afghans into its ranks. Ultimately, however, the Taliban refused to crack down on TTP activities as demanded by Islamabad, fearful that IS-K accusations of betraying the cause of jihad in Pakistan gain credibility. The Taliban fear that the TTP, which has thousands of armed men inside Afghanistan, might see large scale defections to IS-K, or even ally with it. There is evidence of some cooperation between IS-K and TTP from Spring 2023 onwards. Reportedly, TTP leaders had for several months been constantly alluding to the possibility of “defections” to IS-K from their ranks, whenever the Afghan Taliban put them under pressure. The Taliban’s leadership, aware of widespread sympathies for the TTP within its ranks, for all of 2022 and 2023 prioritised relations with the TTP over relations with Islamabad, resulting in gradually worsening Afghanistan-Pakistan relations: in November 2023, Pakistan expelled Afghans illegally residing on Pakistani soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the major difficulties it faced after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, IS-K demonstrated great resilience. Its strategic choices were often based on over-optimistic assessment of the weaknesses of the Taliban and the rigid ideological approach of the organisation greatly limited its ability to expand its ranks. However, the tactical choices made by the leadership were mostly sound from the perspective of a violent extremist organisation: it rapidly bailed out of direct confrontation with the Taliban, even in the east where it had its main stronghold; it went on the offensive in the cities; it sought to spare its forces; it invested massively in its propaganda operations, which helped it convey an image of much greater strength than it actually had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical flaw of IS-K was that it remained crucially dependent on funding accruing from abroad. Not only did the Taliban get gradually better at interdicting the flow of money but IS-K also struggled to provide a compelling rationale for prospective donors to fund it. The idea of a jihad against the Taliban had little appeal among traditional sympathisers and supporters of IS-K in the Gulf countries and IS-K struggled to offer an alternative and convincing rationale. Eventually, even the central leadership of IS, which had made up for IS-K’s failure to raise enough of its own funds, seemed to have started running out of cash. Even if in the latter half of 2023 the situation was easing somewhat, this remained a critical vulnerability for IS-K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being undermined by the gradually reducing flow of money and having to decentralise its operations, IS-K was able to maintain a considerable level of organisational coherence, helped by the Taliban’s failure to offer attractive packages to disillusioned members. Moving IS-K members to Pakistan was likely part of a wider strategy meant to put a large part of its structure in “reserve” or “freeze” mode, in the hope of new funding accruing soon. Indeed, as soon as some money started flowing again, many of these re-entered Afghanistan, but parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan remain available to IS-K as safe havens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how long this organisational coherence will last if funding cannot be kept at sufficient levels. Maintaining a large structure underground is expensive and makes recruitment harder to carry on. As importantly, the low level of activity and relative passivity in the face of Taliban crackdowns should be expected to affect morale. Given that the prospects for IS central to enjoy a renaissance looked rather dim as of mid-2023, IS-K’s best chances of reversing a negative trend are if intra-Taliban divisions deepen, resulting in the implosion of the Emirate — of which there is little visible sign — or some regional power deciding to support it against the Taliban for its own reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much, of course, will also depend on how the Taliban will develop their counter-IS-K efforts. This paper shows how IS-K’s original challenge to the Emirate had to repeatedly adapt to the Taliban’s own evolving response. Overall, IS-K’s flexibility, its capacity to adapt, and even to migrate geographically is striking. If there were any doubt that IS-K has absorbed organisational know-how from the original Islamic State, it should have been dispelled by post-August 2021 developments. IS-K clearly seems to have inherited the resilience of the mother organisation. It is worth noting that IS-K has clearly been prioritising maintaining its core structure of highly motivated and well-prepared cadres, even at the price of sacrificing its foot soldiers. That core structure is the repository of the know-how inherited from IS-Central or developed by IS-K itself throughout its history. That the core has shown the ability to develop new tactics and ability to function as a relatively large underground organisation represents the greatest threat. IS-K might eventually survive the Taliban’s onslaught, but if it does it will emerge as a much more dangerous organisation than before.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;林榮基赴台擺頭版 陳沛敏：係我嘅決定，因有新聞價值、持獨家照片者要求&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cTaUc9i.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（5日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第23日審訊。前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。庭上展示黎智英與陳沛敏之間的訊息紀錄，黎指示陳：「請繼續做在大陸做生意的香港商人面對的危險，嚇壞那些生意佬讓建制派不敢造次。」控方指其後文章〈西環集中營：集結商界 專業人士7.1上街〉提及商界反對修例，陳則表示不肯定文章內容如此寫，是否因為黎的指示，還是純屬巧合。另外，《蘋果》於2019年4月頭版報導林榮基修例前赴台，陳稱：「係我嘅決定」，因她認為有新聞價值，加上持有相關獨家照片的人士開出條件，若果《蘋果》打算頭條報導，才會願意提供相片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英邀香港監察羅傑斯聯絡陳-陳沛敏反送中後傳送新聞稿較頻密&quot;&gt;黎智英邀「香港監察」羅傑斯聯絡陳 陳沛敏：反送中後傳送新聞稿較頻密&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，第二天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示訊息紀錄，黎智英於2017年10月向陳沛敏發送訊息，稱「沛敏，我剛同Ben Rogers晚飯，他剛與一些MP成立了HK WATCH維護香港自由，我對他說有需要傳媒的幫忙請他找你並給了他你的聯絡，謝謝。黎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示對羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）認識不多，只知道他與一些英國國會議員成立了「香港監察」。黎傳送上述訊息之後，羅傑斯的確有聯絡她，傳送一些傳媒新聞稿，開頭僅是一些介紹「香港監察」的資料，但到了2019年《逃犯條例》引起社會運動，羅傑斯傳送新聞稿的頻率「係密咗、多啲就香港事務出新聞稿囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;1/2 Tomorrow I will begin a 24 hour fast &amp;amp; hunger strike for Hong Kong. I call it a fast &amp;amp; a hunger strike because they have two meanings. A fast is spiritual &amp;amp; includes prayer. A hunger strike is political &amp;amp; involves protest. #HongKong #StandwithHK #democracyforhongkong pic.twitter.com/1pLvwgiCAf — Benedict Rogers 羅傑斯 (@benedictrogers) November 15, 2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，陳確認羅傑斯是「香港監察」的信託主席，相信《蘋果日報》曾經報導過「香港監察」成立，以及羅傑斯被香港政府當局拒絕入境。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏形容香港監察對中國帶批判性&quot;&gt;陳沛敏形容「香港監察」對中國帶批判性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018年5月16日，羅傑斯傳送了一篇文章給黎智英，之後黎轉發該訊息給陳沛敏。文章題為〈香港政府發動的政治檢控壓毀民主派的希望（“Lawfare Waged by the Hong Kong Government is Crushing the Hopes of Democrats”）〉，由羅傑斯撰寫，於2018年5月15日刊登。陳沛敏閱讀後，指文章提及DQ立法會議員、檢控佔中運動中的某些議員，惟她不肯定《蘋果》有否報導此文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，「香港監察」可說是支持中國，還是反中國？陳回答：「我諗佢好 critical 囉」，意指對中國帶有批判性，同樣形容亦適用於羅傑斯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指示做大美總領事演說-陳沛敏此前經已報導&quot;&gt;黎智英指示「做大」美總領事演說 陳沛敏：此前經已報導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月4日，其時政府已推出了《逃犯條例》修訂，黎智英向陳沛敏傳送一篇《華盛頓郵報》報導，指示她報導時任美國駐港澳總領事 Kurt Tong 於同年2月27日的公開演說，黎並說「請做大」。陳之後回覆，已用A2全版報導，而「明天見報會繼續」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏指，A2僅次於頭版，因此A2全版報導算是「幾大」。控方問黎此前曾否要求她「做大」某些新聞，陳稱：「應該有。」但黎並沒有解釋為何想她「做大」該新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後解釋，其實在黎傳送上述訊息之前，《蘋果》已經用了A2全版來報導演說，可能黎當時並未留意，所以其後黎發覺後，才會有一則訊息指「好的，對不起，我不知道，謝謝」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑陳毫不猶豫地遵從黎要求&quot;&gt;官質疑陳毫不猶豫地遵從黎要求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，該演說在早前發生，不再是新聞，而是一則舊聞，可是陳卻似乎毫不猶豫地遵從黎的要求，而不是告訴黎「這是舊聞」或「沒有需要放在A2」，還是因為陳覺得值得放在A2？陳則澄清，她的意思是，當黎叫她「做大」美領事演說時，「其實我哋已經做大咗喇」，因《蘋果》在演說翌日便已全版報導。而她當時回覆的訊息只是「婉轉地話畀佢（黎）我哋已經做大咗」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問，但陳並沒有拒絕黎的要求，而她剛才供稱「應該有」遵從黎的指示。陳則表示，既然黎如此重視這新聞，而且《蘋果》已經報導了，「但都會睇吓會有咩跟進報導囉。譬如輿論有冇對個演說有新回應，而唔係重覆再報導多一次個演說」，所以她回覆黎表示會跟進報導，而不是明言拒絕他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問，不論黎重視或不重視某些新聞，是否都會影響《蘋果》的編採方向。陳回答：「都會嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎指示報導陳太與彭斯會面-做到最大效果-陳沛敏有新聞價值&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎指示報導陳太與彭斯會面 「做到最大效果」 陳沛敏：有新聞價值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示 WhatsApp 訊息，黎智英向陳沛敏轉發一張照片，是前政務司司長陳方安生與時任美國副總統彭斯會面時握手的照片，黎指這是「大新聞（big news）」，指示陳將新聞「做到最大效果（use it to the maximum effect）」。陳確認其後有將新聞做到「最大效果」，即是將報聞「擺喺顯著位置，篇幅大啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示《蘋果日報》於2019年3月24日的頭版報導，標題為〈彭斯晤陳太 關注港人權〉，頭版下方有一篇配稿題為「主導對華政策」、「港問題或成中美角力戰」。控方問這是否陳當時對中美關係的理解，陳回答是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又提及，頭版照片下方標註是由公民黨提供，而且報導提及有其他公民黨成員陪同陳方安生訪美。控方另指，根據訊息紀錄，黎智英轉發給陳的訊息，是來自前公民黨立法會議員郭榮鏗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳為何要將此新聞放在頭版，陳表示：「都覺得佢係有新聞價值。當然黎生話要做大，都係一個因素嚟嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎曾希望約見記協執委-惟記協內部有不同意見-最後沒有成事&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎曾希望約見記協執委 惟記協內部有不同意見 最後沒有成事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2019年3月29日及30日的訊息均有提及香港記協，陳沛敏起初表示不記得是什麼事件，但閱過訊息紀錄後，憶述當時黎智英希望約見記協執委，相信他有意談論《逃犯條例》對新聞業的影響，於是想經她聯絡對方。惟記協執委則表示內部對於是否會面有不同意見，陳於是將相關回覆轉告黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;報導引述黎稱倘修例慘過23條-陳沛敏黎認為條例用作政治檢控&quot;&gt;報導引述黎稱倘修例「慘過23條」 陳沛敏：黎認為條例用作「政治檢控」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年4月1日《蘋果》報導，題為〈黎智英：倘修例傳媒冇得做〉，文中引述黎稱若果通過修例會「慘過23條」，又稱「呢單嘢好緊要㗎大佬，呢單嘢過咗，我哋冇得做㗎！傳媒冇得做㗎！你話報道大陸新聞，佢話你揭露國家機密；你批評佢，佢又話你顛覆國家安全，咁就冇㗎嘞，新聞自由依家少少都冇埋㗎喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，為何黎會將《基本法》23條與《逃犯條例》相提並論？陳指因為黎認為《逃犯條例》是用來「針對一啲政治檢控」、「政治檢控用途」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指示多報導商界對修例擔心-嚇壞那些生意佬讓建制派不敢造次&quot;&gt;黎智英指示多報導商界對修例擔心 「嚇壞那些生意佬讓建制派不敢造次」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年3月30日的訊息，黎向陳稱：「沛敏，今日頭條做得很好，只是沒有說做大陸新聞分分鐘被視為揭露國家機密，和批評中國政府文章會被標籤顛覆國家安全等罪名。但很好了。請繼續做在大陸做生意的香港商人面對的危險，嚇壞那些生意佬讓建制派不敢造次。謝謝。」陳回覆，稱「收到。商界有票，所以政府才稍微讓步，如果他們反對，政府就沒戲唱了」。黎回覆：「對，對付這些怕死鬼可能是我們絕招。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏指，黎認為他們「要報導多啲商界對《逃犯條例》的擔心，或者反對《逃犯條例》的意見」。法官李運騰問陳認為黎的訊息是「指示」、「建議」還是其他？陳認為是「指示」，因為黎並不是在提出建議，陳當時亦同意黎的指示。控方問到，黎口中的「怕死鬼」是哪些人，陳相信是指做生意的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後再傳來訊息：「沛敏，你今日的文章畫龍點睛，寫得真好。」陳在庭上表示，她有替副刊專欄撰寫文章，每隔一個星期六刊登一篇，專欄名為「堆填生活」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎落指示後文章出現相關內容-陳不肯定有否因果關係&quot;&gt;黎落指示後文章出現相關內容 陳：不肯定有否因果關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年4月3日的《蘋果日報》文章，題為〈西環集中營：集結商界 專業人士7.1上街〉。陳沛敏解釋，此專欄主要是寫政界花邊，多數由政治組同事執筆，雖然每次撰寫的同事可能不同，但是均會使用同一筆名「季陶」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指文章提及「有民主派人士稱，現時各個界別反修訂《逃犯條例》的人已越來越多，特別是商界及專業界，但礙於怕北京及林鄭政府秋後算賬，大多不敢公開表態，他們正研究如何集結這些力量」。控方問，上述提及商界的內容與黎早前的指示有沒有關係？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳則表示不肯定，因為她有跟同事轉達要做多些關於商界擔心的報導，但上述文章是否因為黎下達指示，然後剛巧有一位民主派說商界和專業界擔心，而哪一件事導致同事寫這篇文章，她就沒有查問下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，所以陳是不肯定當中的因果關係？陳回答是。法官杜麗冰又問陳知不知道文章由誰撰寫，陳表示只知道是政治組同事寫，但不知道是哪一位同事。杜官問，所以陳不知道文章內容如此寫是因為黎的指示，還是巧合？陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏黎智英曾建議訪問司法界前輩-惟因聯絡不到而告吹&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：黎智英曾建議訪問「司法界前輩」 惟因聯絡不到而告吹&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示訊息紀錄，黎智英轉發來自民主黨李永達的訊息，並稱「以上是李永達提議」。李的訊息建議《蘋果》將修例其中幾個重點逐日分析，讓讀者逐點消化。陳相信當時《蘋果》有執行此建議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又在訊息中提及文章〈跟司法界前輩談引渡惡法〉寫得很好，問陳可否訪問文中提及的「司法界前輩」。陳理解這是一項「建議」，因為黎的訊息有問「係咪可以？」，所以陳認為：「佢都唔肯定係咪可以做到，但建議我哋諗吓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，其後她在公司與黎親身討論，黎重申覺得該專欄文章內容寫得很好，籲陳考慮寫成報導及怎樣表達重點，又問可否找到文中提及的「司法界前輩」，如果對方不肯露面，又能否要求只刊出背影。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳最終有否執行黎的建議。陳則稱當時應該聯絡不到受訪者，因為他們希望經文章作者聯絡「司法界前輩」，惟後來沒有回音。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏稱林榮基赴台新聞做頭條乃其決定-因有新聞價值提供獨家照片人士要求&quot;&gt;陳沛敏稱林榮基赴台新聞做頭條乃其決定 因有新聞價值、提供獨家照片人士要求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年4月26日的訊息紀錄，關於黎要求報導前銅鑼灣書店店長林榮基離港赴台。陳沛敏稱：「黎生喺清晨時 send 咗幾十個 message 畀我」，直到早上10至11時，她才醒來看到黎的訊息，於是聯絡羅偉光，並得悉《蘋果》網站版同事已經正在處理，以及下午3時準備在網站刊登林榮基的新聞。陳續指，她向黎交代之後，下午才上班，而結果林榮基的新聞成為翌日實體報紙的頭條。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，以林榮基作為頭條「係我嘅決定」，因為她認為本身有新聞價值，加上提供相關獨家照片的人士開出條件，「如果做A1（頭條），佢先畀（照片）我哋用。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又憶述，前《蘋果》社長張劍虹當時似乎「好緊張呢件事」，所以陳決定把林榮基的報導放在頭條。陳指當時張在台灣，相信他透過台灣《蘋果》同事的協助找林做訪問，「佢有去幫手寫埋、採訪埋，佢亦有同黎生講佢喺採訪途中。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏蘋果每天召開數個會議-決定報紙內容和頭條&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：《蘋果》每天召開數個會議 決定報紙內容和頭條&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，控方問及《蘋果日報》實體報紙的出版流程。陳供稱，她每天約2時半會出席「鋤報會」，同場有不同部組的主管，每人輪流發表對當日出版的報紙的意見，可以是關於新聞角度、圖片選擇、其他報紙有但《蘋果》沒有的新聞，或者就同一單新聞《蘋果》有什麼做得比其他報紙遜色。最後由陳沛敏和前執行總編輯林文宗作總結，會議歷時約半小時。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及陳沛敏與林文宗在職能上有何分別，陳指林可謂她的副手，正如她上周五提及，她身體狀況不容許她工作太長時間，所以林文宗負責「守到報紙出版最後時間」，而且她休假期間林會接手她的工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏續指，開完「鋤報會」之後，下午約3時會有「初會」，各部組會派代表出席，通常是採訪主任或各部組的副總編輯。會議中各部組會報告當天有什麼重要新聞、正準備什麼新聞角度、有何跟進工作等，之後他們會揀選一些能夠「做得大」的新聞放在頭版，而陳和林會提供意見，例如可以如何跟進。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，她在下午5時會參與「編前會議」，主要是跟進「初會」，包括揀選哪些新聞放在頭幾頁。不過，「編前會議」至報紙出版之間的一段時間，可能會有大新聞發生，或事件出現新進展，假設有一宗大新聞發生於晚上9時，需要更改新聞的編排位置，然則「我哋都會改過晒佢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到上述三種會議有否保存會議記錄，陳稱沒有，因當日工作結束之後，這些紀錄便沒有需要再保存。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏總編輯羅偉光不時出席會議&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：總編輯羅偉光不時出席會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，有沒有高層出席上述會議。陳指《蘋果日報》總編輯羅偉光不時出席，大約每周數次，視乎有否重大新聞發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏續指，《蘋果日報》逢周三會有一個「Planning會」，除陳自己和林文宗之外，出席者包括港聞組、中國組、國際組和財經組等各部組，會上各部組會談及未來一星期有什麼重點新聞、、會著重什麼新聞角度及會怎樣部署，陳和林亦會提供意見，例如可以如何跟進。至於羅偉光，陳形容「因為佢真係好忙」，未能出席每次會議，因此即使他不在場，會議都會如期舉行。&lt;/p&gt;

Not long after, then-Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal was proclaiming “a Marine Corps for the next 500 years” in the wake of the U.S victory at Iwo Jima.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;This turnaround in fortunes was in no small part driven by reformers who recognized that retaining the underlying utility that amphibious forces provide in terms of both tactical and strategic mobility demanded changes to their underlying concepts of employment as well as tactics, techniques, and procedures. Underpinning this transformation was an effort to define role of amphibious forces as an enabling capability for the fleet itself rather than merely one that was enabled by the rest of the force.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s amphibious forces are at a similar inflection point when they will have to define their role in the future combat operating environment. These forces, which have traditionally represented a mechanism through which rapid reaction could be delivered on both Europe’s own maritime flanks and at reach, will be presented with two challenges. At sea, the challenge of anti-access/area denial capabilities will hold the shipping that supports amphibious forces at risk. On land, organizations such as the British 3 Commando Brigade and the Dutch Korps Mariniers will have their ability to concentrate for tactical effect contested by adversary militaries organized to deliver large volumes of fires on rapid cycles, cued in by unmanned aerial vehicles. As light forces without their own organic short-range air defense systems (beyond man-portable air defenses), European marines will face considerable challenges in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This need not, however, represent a basis for surrendering the tactical and operational opportunities that amphibious forces provide a joint force. In many respects, the contribution of forces that can exploit the entirety of the littoral as a maneuver space will be of ever greater importance if peer competitors such as Russia are to be denied the opportunity to operate as they would prefer to do on narrow linear fronts in theatres such as the Baltic and NATO’s northern flank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to deliver continued tactical and operational utility, forces such as the Royal Marines will have to resolve an underlying challenge. To survive they will, among other things, have to become an increasingly distributed force. However, distribution brings with it inherent challenges in terms of both sustaining a force and delivering meaningful effects on the battlefield. Of course, this dynamic is not unique to amphibious forces as distribution is becoming more important across the board. However, the question is how forces that are both distributed and inherently light can continue to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent report, my coauthor and I argue that European marine forces (including the Royal Marines) can deliver considerable utility if they subsume their concepts of operations within the traditional maritime functions of strike and securing sea control. Our premise is that there is a basis for closer alignment between marine organizations and fleets (in particular fleets traditionally optimized for sea denial in littoral spaces) as well as between emerging concepts of operations within marine organizations on both sides of the Atlantic. Recognizing this can help resolve the “dispersal dilemma” and can, moreover, allow marines to help resolve a growing spatial separation between fleets that operate at reach and joint forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both littoral-oriented fleets and evolving amphibious forces such as the U.S. Marine Corps can deliver capable strike capabilities — something that is as relevant to disruption inland from the littoral as it is to tasks such as sea denial in the Indo-Pacific. However, strike-centric operations need to be enabled by surveillance and reconnaissance inland, as well as by shaping operations that influence an opponent to behave in ways that maximize his vulnerability. It is here that European marine forces redesigned to operate as a distributed raiding capability can offer the greatest value. In effect, then, there is an inherent complementarity between light European marine forces, which must of necessity operate in a distributed manner, and strike-centric forces that can generate fires from the littoral. These forces would thus evolve into the forward edge of a single archipelagic capability encompassing fires distributed in the littoral and smaller coastal combatants. European marines employed in this way would become a critical enabler for any effort to deliver effects inland from the littoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;change-drivers-and-opportunities&quot;&gt;Change: Drivers and Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, European marine forces such as the Royal Marines and the Korps Mariniers were expected to provide a rapid reaction capability on Europe’s northern flank. Structured and equipped as light infantry, these forces would represent the vanguard element of an amphibious force that would include the U.S. Marine Corps. This force would, itself, be reinforced by the Norwegian army as the state mobilized based on its conscription system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, important elements of this vision would prove difficult to replicate. First, though a credible and dangerous sea denial challenge existed in the 1980s as well, the threat has evolved. The processing power to fuse data from multiple sensor types and from multiple sources has developed in tandem with the emergence of supersonic and hypersonic anti-ship cruise missiles such as the P-800 and the Zircon. The proliferation of different sensor types as well as the means to cue them will make hiding on the surface increasingly difficult, while faster missiles reduce the salvo sizes needed to penetrate an air defense screen. To be sure, Russia has struggled to engage dynamic targets in the conflict in Ukraine, but it should be assumed that it will improve in this regard. Similarly, a combination of more capable man-portable air defenses and longer-ranged air defense systems will challenge insertion using helicopters in many cases. All of this was in evidence in the early days of the conflict in Ukraine, when the reconnaissance elements of the Russian Black Sea Fleet’s 810th Naval Infantry Brigade encountered stiff resistance near Odessa when they attempted insertion by both sea and air. This does not mean that amphibious insertion is impossible, but it will occur under increasingly contested conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, lodgments ashore will become increasingly difficult to defend. This is not exactly a new issue and has been a challenge for amphibious forces historically. Examples such as the Falklands War illustrate how vulnerable a force that gradually builds up combat power ashore can be to air attack. However, the air and missile threat will become more complex for a number of reasons. First, increased precision means that tools such as short-range ballistic missiles can be used effectively as tactical tools. Secondly, armed and surveillance drones such as Russia’s Okhotnik and China’s GJ-11 can provide adversaries with a relatively simple means of generating very low observable air power. Third, opponents can generate large volumes of less-precise standoff by equipping dumb bombs with glide kits as the Russians have with the FAB-500. Finally, supporting assets will be occupied with tasks such as self-protection, the defense of carrier groups, and, in the case of aircraft, suppression of air defense — all of which means that external defensive counter-air cannot always be relied upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities&quot;&gt;Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons to believe that the ability to exploit the maneuverability of amphibious forces in the littoral can be both sustained and exploited to good effect. On the likely fronts where a Russian force might advance into Europe, Russia would enjoy the advantage of operating on narrow fronts where firepower, electronic warfare assets, and air defense systems can be concentrated to devastating effect. In Estonia, for example, NATO forces might face Russian forces on a front of roughly 50 kilometers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should Russia meet the targets that it has set itself under the aegis of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu’s planned force design, it will field a force of 1.5 million that includes 10 new divisions in two new military districts. Such a force would almost certainly be of variable quality, much like the current three-tiered Russian force structure in Ukraine (divided between disposable units, line infantry, and high-quality assault infantry). The force described would, however, generate considerable combat mass. A Russian force thus constituted could, for example, fix NATO forces on multiple points on the alliance’s frontier with Russia while concentrating its higher quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated in the campaign for the Donbas in July 2022, when Russian forces are able to concentrate in this manner, they can generate fires on a scale and with a level of responsiveness that would impose considerable attrition on defenders (at one point, Ukrainian forces in the Donbas were losing 200 men a day). Narrow fronts allow a Russian force to saturate its line of advance with drones such as the Orlan-10, which can allow Russian forces to cue in fires in as little time as three minutes from initial observation. While ground- and air-based precision strike assets can disrupt the lines of communication and supply upon which such a Russian force depends, Russian forces have adapted to systems such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System and, moreover, would be able to concentrate a considerable portion of their surveillance and strike assets to detecting and destroying ground based systems in a congested theatre. As illustrated by Russia’s use of Iskander missiles to destroy individual Ukrainian surface-to-air missile systems, when Russian forces believe that a capability is sufficiently important they can devote disproportionately costly resources to engaging it. In Ukraine, the size of the frontline has complicated Russian efforts to responsively engage Western strike assets but this may be a simpler task on many of the fronts where Russian and NATO forces would be likely to meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geometry of the battlefield can, however, be expanded considerably if the littoral is treated as a space from which inland strike can be generated. Estonia, for example, has 2,222 islands while Norway has, by some estimates, over 200,000. Strike platforms such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System and the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System, both of which will likely feature heavily in the U.S. Marine Corps’ future force design, can thus be considerably more survivable if they can operate both on continental main lands and offshore. While the utility of concepts such as Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations has largely been discussed in the context of the Indo-Pacific, the same concepts can enable an allied force to fight the deep battle more effectively in the European theatre by operating from a wider range of positions. Not only would this complicate the challenge of surveillance for Russian forces by expanding the area that must be surveyed severalfold, but it would also introduce a requirement for platform specialization and complicate the use of some intelligence and surveillance assets, since drones built to operate overland are less stable and survivable in the maritime domain due to climatic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a second opportunity in the European littoral, revolving around the existing surface fleets of new NATO members in theatres like the Baltic. Historically, nations such as Finland and Sweden built their navies for sea denial against what was presumed to be a superior Russian naval force in the Baltic Sea. While the continuing threat posed by the Russian navy in the Baltic should not be understated, it is nonetheless the case that this force will likely be heavily overmatched against NATO — meaning that the original function of sea denial that underpinned these fleets is no longer relevant. However, small missile-equipped platforms such as the Hamina-class fast attack craft and the Visby-class corvette, which are optimized to operate in shallow waters and equipped with dual use missiles such as the Swedish-made RGB-III, can just as easily form the core of a forward postured element of a NATO maritime component where their function would be delivering strikes inland from a narrow sea like the Baltic. The demand signal for such vessels from the wider force would be considerably less significant than for vessels like frigates and destroyers, which will also be required for blue water functions such as anti-submarine warfare and task group protection, and they would represent both smaller and less appealing targets for Russian shore-based sea denial systems than would larger, more expensive allied platforms. The navies of new allies could thus retain their littoral-oriented role in narrow seas but in a forward posture that would considerably complicate Russian planning on the maritime flanks of an invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational level, the ability to posture strike platforms such as those envisioned within the U.S. Marine Corps’ Force Design 2030 in areas such as northern Norway during a crisis would also impose dilemmas on Russian theater-level planning. Such systems would pose a considerable threat to facilities such as Severomorsk and would necessarily need to be engaged. Yet resourcing an effort against them would likely strip Russia’s other fronts of critical assault units (primarily from the Airborne Forces and 200th Arctic Brigade) since the ability to execute cold weather operations is not held across the force. Moreover, such forces would have to advance on narrow fronts and difficult terrain where, if they cannot suppress allied forces by sheer weight of fire and surveillance saturation, they would prove highly vulnerable, much as the Russian army was in its initial assault on Kyiv. The posturing of strike platforms can thus enable operational dislocation and — if an opponent cannot easily track them — can reinforce deterrence. As an example of how an inability to track allied assets has contributed to deterrence in the past, we might consider NATO’s exercise Ocean Venture, which saw allied maritime platforms go emissions-dark in the High North, much to the consternation of Soviet planners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;european-maritime-forces&quot;&gt;European Maritime Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, this article has discussed European naval capabilities as well as systems likely to be held within the U.S. Marine Corps. Restructured European marine forces can add considerable value to the framework described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for European marine forces is that they can no longer function as conventional light infantry brigades. However, they can provide a crucial offer to strike-capable partner forces, namely the capacity to both identify targets inland and to dislocate and fix adversary forces in ways that enable strike-centric components to be used to good effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, the Royal Marines envision restructuring the traditional commando company into 12-man strike teams. Such teams, if enabled to operate along the depth of an opponent’s frontage, can represent a considerable force multiplier for strike-centric partner forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to operate at depth can be enabled by the fact that the maritime maneuver space is effectively parallel to an opponent’s likely line of advance. If enabled by surface maneuver platforms with sufficient reach and low observability, this can enable the insertion of strike teams at depths that other force elements might not always be able to achieve. This would presume a shift in design philosophy, with surface maneuver craft and not surface connectors representing the force’s primary maneuver capability. The latter would require characteristics such as low observability, which necessarily comes at the expense of carrying capacity. Moreover, such platforms could be enabled with their own strike capabilities. We might consider, as an example, how Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps has equipped British-made Bladerunner speed boats with missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While observation in the littoral represents a considerable challenge, adversary sensor networks are inherently dependent on radar given the narrow fields of regard that other modes of detection such as electro-optical sensors allow. Efforts to beat radar through both low observability and the use of decoys and countermeasures to exacerbate the effect of climatic conditions such as super refraction (which generates false positives) can make an entire maritime network less effective. Sufficiently versatile vessels could also be equipped with Short Ranged Air Defense capabilities — something that China has emplaced on the 42-meter Type 022 catamaran. Notably, Sweden’s navy and marines appear to already be making this shift with planned surface maneuver vessels equipped with NEMO mortars. Fired from the littoral, such mortars can in principle be used against targets at depth (at least near coastal areas) because they can bypass an opposing army’s front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of a shift emphasizing surface maneuver would come in terms of both size and overall carrying capacity once requirements such as low observability are accounted for, making it necessary for marine forces to rely on light vehicles such as the Polaris MRZR. On the one hand, it might be argued that this introduces a gap between marines and land components as the latter’s equipment cannot be easily moved. While true at one level, this would also introduce complementarities in other areas. Marine forces thus equipped can, for example, as easily interoperate with units such as the British Army’s Deep Reconnaissance Strike Brigade as part of a whole-of-force effort to win the deep battle. Forces do not always have to be interoperable to be complementary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some evidence to suggest that distributed light raiding units operating at depth can be a considerable force multiplier. Russian doctrine presumes a ratio of 12 infantry to one when operating against special forces in rear areas, meaning that such forces can tie down assets of disproportionate value. The ability of Ukrainian infantry equipped with Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapons to tie down Russian armor to enable their destruction by artillery represents another example. Exercises such as Green Dagger reinforce this. In the context of Green Dagger, a force comprising 40 Commando and the Korps Mariniers operated ahead of 7th Marine Regiment against a U.S. Marine Corps opposing force. 40 Commando was divided up into 12-person strike teams that operated ahead of a light defensive screen. The presence of distributed raiding strike teams of marines posed considerable challenges to the opposing U.S. commander, who could not distribute his forces without raising the risk of raiding but was exposed to fires if he chose to concentrate to both better defend against raiding and to overrun a fairly light Royal Marine defensive screen. In effect, there is an inherent complementarity between distributed light forces and strike-centric ones including those in littoral spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former can operate at depths and in ways that enable the latter while the weight of fire that strike-centric forces at sea in the littoral can bring to bear allows distributed vanguard elements to generate effects without concentrating. Removing the requirement to concentrate in turn reduces the need for the build-up of capabilities that can support a conventionally structured brigade, which, as discussed, are inherently vulnerable. Moreover, distributed small teams have certain other advantages. They can deploy intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms with credible sensor payloads at short ranges, which is critical as large longer-ranged systems are inherently vulnerable. Moreover, smaller units can benefit from solutions such as multispectral concealment that are viable even in the current operating environment but do not scale due to the costs involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, things must change in order to stay the same. The utility of maneuver on and from the littoral remains an important part of the solution to the challenge of Russian combat power in Europe, much as it was during the Cold War. However, the methods by which effects such as operational dislocation and tactical disruption are achieved will need to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to generate long-range strike both from offshore islands and maritime platforms can help to resolve the challenge of generating concentrated effects with distributed forces. This has relevance both to the application of U.S. Marine Corps concepts of operations in the European theatre but also for how littoral-oriented European coastal fleets might be used in a NATO context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European marine forces will to a great extent need to frame their future utility in relation to these trends. They have considerable opportunities to add value to strike-centric concepts of operations for littoral maneuver and early experimentation by the Royal Marines would appear to validate this. This will, however, require shifts in how forces like the Royal Marines are structured and equipped (some of which are underway) and how their employment is conceived. It will also require a wider allied effort to align concepts of operations among both allied marine forces and littoral-oriented navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A viable concept of littoral maneuver can help reduce the possibility of a growing spatial gap between fleets operating at reach with strategic capabilities such as cruise missiles and other elements of the joint force and ensure that both marines and maritime forces more broadly can contribute to a multidomain deep battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Pbfc5hi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（2日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第22日審訊。控方完成覆問前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，結束歷時約12日的證供，接著另一名以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供的是前副社長陳沛敏。法官杜麗冰指，由於職員需要約20至25分鐘作安排，以將陳沛敏帶上庭，故押後至下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹形容國安法後-黎言論冇咁露骨&quot;&gt;張劍虹形容國安法後 黎言論「冇咁露骨」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方昨完成盤問張劍虹，今早確認沒有進一步提問。控方遂進行覆問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有關2021年4月21日的WhatsApp訊息，張劍虹向楊清奇傳來《大公報》文章截圖，當中圈出一句「直言要外國聯合制裁以致推翻國家執政黨」，張問：「主筆，你印象中我們社評有寫過這些？」楊回覆：「國安法出台前可能有」，張回覆：「出台前就不算違法」。楊續說：「出台後連老闆都唔提」，張回覆：「是」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張表示《國安法》生效之後，黎智英撰文及受訪時的言論，「冇之前國安法生效前寫得咁露骨架喇，啫係比較肯定外國制裁對阻止中國打壓香港嘅自由民主人權嘅效力咁啦。」當楊清奇說「出台後連老闆都唔提」，張理解意思是黎的言論「冇話好露骨咁話要制裁、制裁、制裁」，所以張表示同意楊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英不在數個高層群組之中-張高層可較自由表達意見&quot;&gt;黎智英不在數個高層群組之中 張：高層可較自由表達意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方早前提及因應國安法，《蘋果》高層設立了不同聊天群組，包括「國安法應變委員會」、「報紙敏感廣告小組」和「應變小組」，而張亦確認黎智英並不是上述群組成員之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今要求張澄清原因，張解釋如果黎加入群組的話，「我哋咩都唔洗傾架喇，因為全部都係由呀黎生決定哂」，但若果高層可在自己的群組中討論，「黎生唔喺度呢，大家都free 啲表達意見，睇吓係咪真係好有需要話俾黎生。」他同意這些群組的目的並不是決策，而是討論敏感議題，讓高層之間能坦白表達意見，之後才向黎表達。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方早前盤問時提到，在2020年7月4日，張劍虹把一份廣告初稿傳給前《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏，問：「有光時句子廣告，你點睇？」陳則回覆已咨詢內部法律顧問，而該廣告最終使用另外一個八字標語，而棄用「光時」。控方今展示一份廣告，可見一個楓葉圖案、「在加港人全力撐」、「五大訴求，缺一不可」、「光復香港，時代革命」，張確認當時談論的是這一份廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方將報紙顯示日期和頁數條欄放大-指有光時口號&quot;&gt;控方將報紙顯示日期和頁數條欄放大 指有「光時」口號&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月5日及8日的《蘋果日報》港聞版，並在電腦中將報紙頂部顯示日期和頁數的條欄放大，指出背景圖片顯示到旗幟上的「光復香港，時代革命」口號。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰留意到該條欄連續兩日都有顯示「兩制蓋棺」，張劍虹解釋，所有國安法的報導都會擺在此條欄下，國安法生效當天，《蘋果》頭版也是以「兩制蓋棺」作標題，因為按照黎智英的標準，國安法使一國兩制「玩完」，所以決定使用此字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於使用「光時」口號是誰人的主意，張表示不記得，但分工上港聞版是由陳沛敏負責，而該「光時」口號其實是一張新聞圖片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;信件顯示律政司否認警方邀請張劍虹做控方證人&quot;&gt;信件顯示律政司否認警方邀請張劍虹做控方證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方昨日提及2021年11月，張劍虹獲警方探監之後，決定轉做控方證人，並解聘原本代表他的羅拔臣律師事務所。而其新聘的劉陳律師事務所於12月16日去信律政司，表明在警方邀請之下，有意做控方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今問張知不知道，律政司在12月17日去信回覆劉陳律師事務所，稱警方並沒有邀請過其當事人。張表示「我唔清楚」，又指不知道該信件的存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示覆問完畢。法官杜麗冰指，得悉職員需要約20至25分鐘作流程上安排，以將陳沛敏帶上庭，故決定押後至下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官向張說，他已作供完畢，現可以離開法庭。張表示：「係，知道」，然後從證人座位站起身，向法官席鞠躬，之後張由懲教人員帶領下循特別通道離開法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（2日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第22日審訊。前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹早上完成歷時約12天的證供，前副社長陳沛敏下午以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。被問到《蘋果》是否一份政治性的報紙，陳表示：「我會覺得《蘋果》嗰個創辦人會有好鮮明嘅價值」，支持香港發展民主政制，另外也會尊重自由、人權這些價值，同時會重視市場反應。控方提到2014年佔中運動，陳指《蘋果》每天都會報導，黎智英亦親身參與運動，「成日去金鐘嗰度（佔領區）坐囉」。運動結束後，她指《蘋果》的娛樂新聞減少，黎的國際知名度增加，「我哋同事之間覺得佢喺社會運動度企得前咗囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」控罪的前《蘋果日報》副社長陳沛敏，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。其丈夫、被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」的前《立場新聞》總編輯鍾沛權，亦有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳身穿杏色上衣、淺藍色褸，蓄平蔭和冬菇頭，由兩名女懲教人員經職員通道帶進法庭，她以天主教形式宣誓。陳作供期間，黎智英亦透過耳機專心地聆聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、助理刑事檢控專員張卓勤先作主問，陳確認案發時任職《蘋果日報》副社長。壹傳媒大樓於2020年8月被警方搜查，至2021年6月17日再度被搜，而她當天亦被拘捕，之後獲警方擔保。直至同年7月21日，她在住所樓下再度被捕，其後被正式控告「串謀發布煽動刊物」和「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」罪。陳早前承認「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」，另一控罪則存檔法庭，現時正還柙等候判刑。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;個人背景方面，陳確認她在香港土生土長，大學主修工商管理，曾經在《資本雜誌》和《星島日報》工作。她離開《星島》之後，於1996年12月加入《蘋果日報》，任職高級記者。其時《蘋果日報》已發行了約一年多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，她其後獲晉升至首席記者、採訪主任和副總編輯，最終升為副社長。陳供稱她主要負責本地新聞，但當發生一些極端的國際事件，例如3.11日本大地震，她也會協助國際版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提及，她在2015年曾是總編輯，但工作了一年多之後，她在2016年確診患癌症，「嗰陣時都三期尾，要做手術、化療啦」，因此申請病假、停工了7個月。她續指，後來於2017年復工時，擔心自己的健康狀況和癌症會復發，所以跟上司張劍虹表示擔心承受不到總編輯的工作壓力。當時《蘋果》副社長退休，該職位出現空缺，在張的同意下，陳接手副社長職位，因「副社長比較副手啲，唔洗承受咁大壓力」，張亦容許陳下午才上班，工作至晚上8時便下班，「變咗夜晚黑工作可以交俾其他同事完成。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏蘋果創辦人有鮮明價值-同時著重市場&quot;&gt;陳沛敏：《蘋果》創辦人有鮮明價值 同時著重市場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，會否形容《蘋果日報》是一份政治性的報紙，還是她會形容為非政治性報紙。陳表示：「一係咁講，我會覺得《蘋果》嗰個創辦人會有好鮮明嘅價值」，支持香港發展民主政制，另外也會尊重自由、人權這些價值；不過與此同時，創辦人也會著重市場對這份報紙是否支持，例如娛樂新聞能否吸引到讀者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳個人而言，她表示：「我唔否認著重新聞嘅娛樂性，不過與此同時，都會著重揭發醜聞嘅大新聞。我覺得呢啲新聞牽涉利益衝突」，例如時任財政司司長梁錦松偷步買車事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，她提及的「創辦人」是否就是黎智英，陳確認。控方續指，黎在本案中是第一被告，不過陳可以自行選擇在作供時稱呼「第一被告」或是「黎先生」，並問她意下如何。陳則表示：「黎生簡單啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏稱佔中後在公司見到黎智英機會增加&quot;&gt;陳沛敏稱佔中後在公司見到黎智英機會增加&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，在任職初期，她會不時見到黎在公司出現，但沒有機會跟他單獨傾談和參與正式會議。被問到黎在公司出現次數，陳表示她經常外出採訪，所以不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2014年香港發生「佔中」，問陳是否有多些機會在公司見到黎智英。陳確認：「多咗機會」，可能在一些偶發性會議中見到，「有時佢會召集會議，講佢一啲經營嘅理念。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到曾有一段時間，黎希望發展網媒，又指有一段時間「佢會覺得紙媒會沒落，佢要我哋可能好多時要諗新聞嘅畫面，畫啲動畫呀」，形容「嗰時黎生好著緊要加動畫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及《蘋果》在哪一年開始引入「動新聞」，陳憶述她於2013年擔任副總編輯，在2至3年後《蘋果》創立「動新聞」，但她不肯定確實年份。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳表示蘋果每天報導佔中新聞&quot;&gt;陳表示《蘋果》每天報導佔中新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏確認，在佔中運動期間，她是《蘋果》的副總編輯，負責靜態新聞。陳表示在整個佔中時期，《蘋果》每天都有報導與事件相關的新聞，紙媒及網媒均有，數量屬於多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指佔中時黎智英成日去金鐘坐同事認為他喺社會運動企得前咗&quot;&gt;陳指佔中時黎智英「成日去金鐘坐」同事認為他「喺社會運動企得前咗」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳沛敏又指，在一些偶然召集的會議中，黎亦可能有談及佔中的話題，「因為黎生有親自參與呢場運動，黎生有去現場參與。」陳指，會議出席者包括採訪主任等「中高層」同事，他們作為記者，而當黎「本身成為一個新聞」的時候，同事都會想問黎有關情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，黎之所以成為新聞，是因他「試過一段時間，成日去金鐘嗰度（佔領區）坐囉」，當時算是一名公眾人物。陳形容黎在2014年之前，是「一個都幾多人識嘅人」，一般認知他為「一個傳媒老闆」、「《蘋果日報》老闆」。控方問到，2014年之後黎的形象是否一樣，陳表示：「我唔可以好科學咁講，一般大眾對佢認知有冇改變」，但「我哋同事之間覺得佢喺社會運動度企得前咗囉，我會咁形容」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指2014年後黎在國際層面相對上出咗名啲-佔中後娛樂新聞減少&quot;&gt;陳指2014年後黎在國際層面「相對上出咗名啲」 佔中後娛樂新聞減少&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳形容黎在2014年之前「相對冇咁多國際上嘅人認識」，但在2014年後，他在國際層面上「應該係相對上出咗名啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱在佔中事件後，《蘋果》娛樂新聞的版面減少，而較少聽到「狗仔隊」有新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦稱記得張劍虹大約於2014年佔中後期至完結期間，「放過一個幾長嘅假」，因為「嗰陣時佢話身體有啲問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳同意蘋果有報導2016年旺角暴動新聞&quot;&gt;陳同意《蘋果》有報導2016年旺角暴動新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問，《蘋果》是否有報導2016年旺角暴動事件，陳同意有。但控方指事件不是歷時數天，所以不作深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，陳同意她自2017年至案發時的2021年6月，一直為副社長的身份，需要負責紙媒。她簡述工作流程包括參與「鋤報會」、編輯前及印刷前的會議。她一般會向社長張劍虹匯報。陳解釋，紙媒有時會將電子版的新聞組合，或者改變當中的焦點角度並出版。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（2月5日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukrainian and Russian commanders face the problem of World War I on the Western front. To achieve victory, they need to break through the defensive zone and get “to the green fields beyond,” but that may be out of reach with existing capabilities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, the path forward in Ukraine was clear: train Ukrainian forces, equip them with highly effective Western weapons, and unleash them in a counteroffensive that would push Russian forces back. Unfortunately, Ukraine got hung up in the Russian defensive zone and liberated little territory. Now, stalemate has settled in. What lies ahead for 2024? Here are three scenarios: the good — Ukraine rebuilds for another offensive and regains some lost territory; the bad — Western aid declines, leading to Ukrainian military deterioration and eventual collapse; and the ugly — a continuing stalemate on the current front lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-good--continued-aid-and-renewed-military-operations&quot;&gt;The Good — Continued Aid and Renewed Military Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war enters its third year, Ukrainian officials are pleading for continued support. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently came to Washington in person to argue his case, and Ukrainian domestic support for the war continues to be strong. The Ukrainian people are committed to liberating their territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, despite opposition from elements in Congress, aid for Ukraine continues to have strong bipartisan support in Congress and with the American people, though both are getting discouraged. There is guarded optimism about a deal that includes increased border security for the Republicans and aid to Ukraine for the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militarily, Ukrainian forces have learned a lot about the Russian defensive system and now know what to expect. In a scenario in which Ukraine is able to continue fighting effectively, it will need weapons to replace losses, which continued military aid will provide. Most of all, its forces will need training. Last year, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) established training programs from basic skills to battalion-level maneuvers to meet this need. Re-equipped and better-trained Ukrainian forces might crack the Russian lines. Ukrainian troops have beaten Russian forces before and retaken half of the territory they lost since February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this approach to be viable, Ukraine needs a theory of victory to guide its military operations and counter rising war fatigue among its supporters. How does it plan to win? This theory of victory could take many forms: a series of limited counterattacks against Russian weak points that collectively regain the lost territory, a battle of attrition that wears Russia down, or a focus on long-range strikes that squeeze Russia, particularly Crimea. Whatever the theory, Ukraine needs to lay it out convincingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-bad--aid-reductions-and-military-decline&quot;&gt;The Bad — Aid Reductions and Military Decline&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. aid to Ukraine is in the balance. A strong contingent in Congress, backed by former president Donald Trump and some think tanks, seeks to end aid. So far, they have succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scenario where U.S. support dramatically diminishes or ends altogether, Ukraine’s future looks bleak, as laid out in a recent CSIS commentary. Ukrainian military capabilities will decline gradually. Over time, Ukraine will face increasing difficulty making local attacks to capitalize on Russian vulnerabilities, and eventually, it will struggle to contain Russian advances. Collapse would be inevitable. Before then, Ukraine would likely agree to a Russian-dictated peace to prevent catastrophic losses of territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-3&quot;&gt;SCENARIO 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ugly--continued-stalemate&quot;&gt;The Ugly — Continued Stalemate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front lines have changed little in the past 14 months despite hundreds of thousands of casualties. A continued stalemate on the ground is a highly likely scenario. Stalemate does not mean nothing happens; local ground assaults, long-range strikes, air attacks on infrastructure, and Ukraine’s dominance in the Black Sea will continue. Stalemate does mean that the front lines will not move much. Both sides have created formidable defensive zones with mines, trenches, strong points, and anti-tank obstacles. Ukrainian and Russian commanders face the problem of World War I on the Western front. To achieve victory, they need to break through the defensive zone and get “to the green fields beyond,” but that may be out of reach with existing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and its supporters have continually hoped for a game-changing weapon that would break the stalemate. Javelin missiles, the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), the Patriot missile defense system, M1 tanks, and Leopard tanks have all been touted as game changers, but none have brought victory even as each has added to Ukraine’s overall military capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next highly anticipated weapon is the F-16 fighter jet. Indeed, Ukraine has pointed to a lack of air support as a key reason for the counteroffensive’s lack of success. Although F-16s might arrive before the end of the year, their numbers will be small (maybe 24), and the vast supporting capabilities available to NATO air forces — airborne early warning, electronic countermeasures aircraft, joint command and control — will be unavailable to the Ukrainians. The F-16s will not do for Ukraine what U.S. airpower did against Iraq, Serbia, Afghanistan, and Libya. Success, if it comes, will result from a combination of weapons and munitions, training of forces, and the people’s determination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimism of 2023 has faded. There is always hope that negotiations will achieve what military forces could not, but the brutal truth is that facts on the ground drive peace settlements. Two of the three scenarios outlined here are Russian victories. A reduction in military aid (the bad scenario) would bring a clear Russian victory. Any peace Russia negotiates while its military power is ascendent would inevitably be unfavorable. Russia would demand not just holding on to the territory it currently occupies but also, possibly, other concessions like amnesty for war crimes and renunciation of reparations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;europes-surprisingly-resilient-support-for-ukraine-will-be-tested-in-2024&quot;&gt;Europe’s Surprisingly Resilient Support for Ukraine Will Be Tested in 2024&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Thus, while Europe is stepping up, it will need to do considerably more for both Ukraine and its own defense forces in 2024. That will require Europe taking extraordinary measures at the EU and national levels to ensure Ukraine is able to hold back Russian forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s fierce response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine surprised many. As Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Europeans were shocked to see one of their capitals under attack. This prompted an unprecedented response, with Europe providing substantial military aid, welcoming millions of Ukrainian refugees, and establishing a robust sanctions regime. Perhaps just as remarkable, today, after nearly two years of war and a major energy shock, European support for Ukraine remains robust. Yet signs of strain are emerging that may prevent Europe from living up to its rhetoric to support Ukraine “as long as it takes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the war becoming a protracted conflict and Russia looking to go back on the offensive, Europe will need to create new instruments and funding mechanisms to support Ukraine, especially if the United States stops sending aid. The sense of political urgency that existed in 2022 has faded. Now with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s Hungary becoming a major difficulty, along with German-led demands for a European-wide return to tight fiscal policy, European support for Ukraine may be far below what is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to forget how surprisingly strong Europe’s response to the war has been. Prior to the invasion, U.S. officials working on sanctions policy believed they would have to pull Europe along, as they did in response to Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014. Yet the EU sanctions response, such as pushing for an oil embargo and adopting sanctions against Russia’s central bank, often caught Washington by surprise. European countries, including the European Union itself, also took unprecedented steps to provide military support to Ukraine. Countries like Germany and Sweden provided lethal aid to a country in conflict for the first time, and the European Union used its European Peace Facility fund to provide Ukraine with lethal assistance. Europe is now collectively providing more support than the United States to Ukraine. The clear threat posed by Russia prompted historic steps from Sweden and Finland to join the NATO alliance. Defense spending also dramatically increased across the continent, with Germany leading the way with the announcement of a new €100 billion Zeitenwende defense fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European support for Ukraine remains high despite the war causing significant economic hardship in Europe. Russian president Vladimir Putin’s throttling of gas deliveries into Europe and the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines caused an energy crisis with Europeans seeing a dramatic increase in prices. The situation led to significant inflation and undermined European economic competitiveness. Yet European leaders reacted with remarkable speed, such as by buying liquefied natural gas and rapidly building new infrastructure. Remarkably, European citizens also responded by cutting their energy demand by 15–20 percent, turning down the thermostat and putting on sweaters. There is no clearer example of steadfast European support than in Germany, where in the wake of a German constitutional court ruling that prompted German leaders to cut €17 billion from its budget, funding for Ukraine was protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are challenges ahead. First, the dynamic of the war in Ukraine has changed. In 2022 and 2023, European militaries were providing Ukraine with older equipment from their militaries, but now that equipment is mostly gone. Europe has little equipment on hand to give, which is problematic because it means if the United States stops providing military aid, Europe will be unable to fill the gap. It also means that for Europe to maintain support to Ukraine, it will have to buy new equipment from its defense industries. Not only will this be more expensive, but it also requires Europeans do more to coordinate their efforts, something European defense ministries struggle to do. As a result, production lines to aid Ukraine and refill European warehouses are not yet running at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Prime Minister Orbán has demonstrated a willingness to block EU support for Ukraine. At the European Council summit in December 2023, Orbán agreed to abstain on the decision to begin ascension negotiations with Ukraine, the next step on Ukraine’s road to EU membership. The European Union had just released more than €10 billion in funds for Hungary that it was holding for rule-of-law violations. However, despite receiving the funds, Orbán noted that he still opposed Ukraine moving toward membership and that there would be many opportunities to block Ukraine’s membership in the future. The next day, Orbán blocked the European Union from providing €50 billion in support for Ukraine. EU leaders were ultimately successful in pressuring Orbán to sign on to the €50 billion financial support to Ukraine at a special February 1 European Council summit. But with Ukraine still needing more military support from the European Union, the European Union and Ukraine’s Hungary problem has not gone away. The need for unanimity for major policy and funding decisions will continue to give Orbán significant leverage and ability to hold Ukrainian funding hostage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and perhaps an even more acute challenge, is the return of austerity economics to the European Union. Last year’s ruling of the German constitutional court that the German government was violating its constitutional requirement to have a balanced budget has led to immediate budget cuts, despite Germany suffering from a major deficit of infrastructure investment. Moreover, the EU Stability and Growth Pact, which sets rules for the national budgets of eurozone countries, returned on January 1, 2024, after being suspended in response to the pandemic. While the pact was amended to give governments more flexibility, the reinstitution of the pact will still put pressure on European governments to cut spending, making additional outlays for defense of Ukraine more difficult. Germany, for instance, has kept its funding for Ukraine at the national level but is now opposing increases to the European Peace Facility, which is used to support Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, while Europe is stepping up, it will need to do considerably more for both Ukraine and its own defense forces in 2024. That will require Europe taking extraordinary measures at the EU and national levels to ensure Ukraine is able to hold back Russian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The ongoing political polarization preventing the Western political mainstream from reaching consensus on essential questions, diffuse power structures, and multiple political chokepoints provide a favorable dynamic for the Kremlin to achieve its goals, especially if its propagandist campaigns are successful in convincing Western audiences the war is too costly for them domestically.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent Ukrainian counteroffensive in the second half of 2023 has exposed Ukraine’s military vulnerabilities on the one hand and Russia’s strengthened defense capabilities on the other. Among the top challenges facing Ukraine is speedy and uninterrupted access to Western military equipment and technology. Ukrainians also require reconstruction support from the West, which is vital to shore up their morale and bring back some of the millions of exiled citizens. Russia, on the contrary, has ramped up domestic arms production, increased the number of volunteers to fight in the war, and successfully continued its sanctions circumvention efforts. Absent consistent large-scale economic and military assistance from the West, Russia might gain a significant military advantage over Ukraine in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Provision of support to Ukraine depends on Western ability to maintain unity. However, by late 2023 this unity had started to crumble. In total, newly committed aid by allies dropped by almost 90 percent between August and October 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Of the 42 previous Ukrainian country donors, only 20 committed new aid packages between October and December 2023, the lowest number since the start of the war. Ukraine is also becoming hostage to partisan battles in the West, as its support has increasingly been contested in both the European Union and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is hoping to exploit these partisan dynamics and further undermine support for Ukraine in the West by using tools such as gas dependencies, investments and oligarchs, disinformation, intelligence and spies, and support for populist parties. Some of these tools are analyzed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-leverage&quot;&gt;Energy Leverage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war, the Kremlin has attempted to undermine Western unity through its energy tools. In preparation for the war, Russian state-controlled energy giant Gazprom gradually reduced gas supplies to Europe. By mid-2022, the European Union was experiencing a 60 percent drop in Russian gas deliveries compared to mid-2021. Russia coupled gas supply reductions with high-volume information campaigns as its state-linked media broadcasted fights and protests breaking out in Europe due to high energy prices. Gazprom also released ads threatening to freeze Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To replace Russian gas, Europe hiked imports of liquefied natural gas from other countries while slashing gas use. The loss of Russia’s cheap natural gas was particularly consequential for Germany, one of its main consumers. Supply disruptions pushed up electricity prices, forcing Berlin to spend billions of euros to ease the burden of rising bills and deepening Germany’s budget crisis. High costs of hydrocarbons prompted German chemical giant BASF to cut jobs and stop its share buybacks. As a result, Germany experienced a minor recession in 2023, becoming the world’s worst-performing major developed economy and the only G7 economy to contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, besides Germany, the drag on EU economic activity was not as deep as expected when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began and the first comprehensive sanctions took place. Moreover, gas prices returned to prewar levels in 2023. At least in the short term, the European Union has successfully adapted and accumulated substantial natural gas inventories sufficient to survive winter 2023. It seems Gazprom, rather than the European Union, took the greatest blow from its own actions by losing much of the European markets and undermining its own geopolitical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;information-leverage&quot;&gt;Information Leverage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2022, the Kremlin’s disinformation strategy failed to sell its pro-war narratives in the West. The U.S. administration’s strategy of disclosing classified intel contributed to exposing Russia’s propagandist efforts. Western public opinion almost uniformly sided with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia subsequently adapted its information strategy to emphasize domestic costs of the war for the West. Thus, comparing to the early months of war, later in 2022, Russia-linked accounts on Twitter had reduced mentions of Nazis and NATO, replacing them with complaints about energy and cost of living. In France, the Kremlin-backed disinformation effort pushed the talking points that Western sanctions against Russia have damaged the economy through a decline in trade and left the country at risk of falling into the deepest social and economic crisis, and that the supply of arms to Ukraine has undermined the country’s ability to defend itself. This approach has worked much better for Russia. As measured by the popularity of those narratives in Western domestic debates, claims that the West’s support for Ukraine is too costly or too risky have found much more fertile ground with Western audiences by playing to pocket-book concerns and war fatigue rather than historical or geopolitical grievances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another disinformation effort is aimed at presenting Western support for Ukraine as futile or hypocritical. A recent BBC study found thousands of fake accounts on TikTok spreading false claims about senior Ukrainian officials and their relatives, presenting them as obsessed with money and uncaring about the war effort. Russian diplomats and Kremlin-linked media platforms are also spreading accusations that the West has a double standard about civilian casualties when it comes to Ukraine and Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-leverage&quot;&gt;Political Leverage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Russia’s influence in Europe and the United States has relied on its links to non-mainstream populist political actors. At the start of the 2022 war, this leverage seemed to have disappeared when many European populists shifted their stances following their voters’ uniform condemnation of Putin and embrace of Ukraine. Most notably, Matteo Salvini’s Lega and Giorgia Meloni’s Fratelli d’Italia parties both flipped their stances to adopt more pro-Europe, pro-U.S., and anti-Russia positions. The intensity of condemnation, however, varied, with some parties presenting others as being at least partially responsible for the war along with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent months, however, old and new populist parties have become more critical of support for Ukraine. On the left, the newly elected Slovakian government led by Prime Minister Robert Fico in early November 2023 rejected a draft plan to donate rockets and ammunition to Kyiv, while prominent German politician Sahra Wagenknecht announced plans to launch a new party opposing sanctions against Russia and arms supplies to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the right, former U.S. president Donald Trump, who leads in the 2024 Republican primaries, has offered more scrutiny on military budgets, as his supporters in Congress blocked funding to the bill that included aid for Ukraine. France’s National Rally and Germany’s Alternative for Germany are growing in popularity, presenting the war in Ukraine as a waste of European resources. In the Netherlands, the recent victory of the far-right Party for Freedom (PVV), which offered to halt military and financial support for Ukraine, threatens the assistance of the fifth-largest EU aid provider to Ukraine. But the main proponent of lifting Western sanctions against Russia and blocking aid for Ukraine is Hungary’s far-right prime minister Viktor Orbán. He has adopted a successful strategy of threatening to block European financial aid for Ukraine and Ukraine’s EU accession unless the European Commission unblocks frozen funds for Hungary. The commission’s recent caving into his blackmail sets a dangerous precedent, which other actors might soon pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;will-the-western-coalition-stick-together&quot;&gt;Will the Western Coalition Stick Together?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming months, the Kremlin is likely to continue using energy, political, and informational tools along the lines discussed here. At the core of Putin’s strategy is identifying the points of discord in the West and amplifying them with a goal of complicating Western ability to sustain consistent support for Ukraine. The ongoing political polarization preventing the Western political mainstream from reaching consensus on essential questions, diffuse power structures, and multiple political chokepoints provide a favorable dynamic for the Kremlin to achieve its goals, especially if its propagandist campaigns are successful in convincing Western audiences the war is too costly for them domestically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears the Western tide is turning for Ukraine. But the problem goes beyond the Kremlin’s aptitude to exploit Western divisions. Broadly speaking, Ukraine is suffering from the West’s inability to understand the existential importance of the war for its own survival and its policymakers’ continued lack of strategy for ensuring victory. Since early 2022, the West has offered Ukraine just enough military aid to survive but not enough to threaten Russia with defeat, which has allowed the Kremlin time to improve its military positions and undermine popular support for Ukraine in the West. The current situation generates multiple fissures in the West, which — if the past is any indication — the Kremlin will prove very apt at exploiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s future depends on the outcomes on the battlefield as much as on the economic front.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector is the main motor of growth of any functioning market economy, creating jobs; introducing new products, services, and processes; and transferring technology and know-how. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 90 percent of all business activity worldwide and contribute over 50 percent of global employment. Companies are also major sources of tax revenue for governments, helping fund public services. This is the case in Ukraine, where the private sector — comprising approximately 1.6 million individual entrepreneurs, 400,000 SMEs, and 500 large enterprises — contributes significantly to the economy and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the war has affected businesses across sectors of the Ukrainian economy, damaging facilities and logistics routes and disrupting supply chains, leading to sales losses and unemployment. Ukraine is fighting as much a military war against Russia as an economic war. The enemy is trying not only to occupy land, wipe out physical infrastructure, and inflict mass civilian casualties but also to cripple the economy, targeting critical industries including transport and logistics, agriculture, energy, digital, and the defense industrial base. Ukraine’s future depends on the outcomes on the battlefield as much as on the economic front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the war, the private sector has exhibited remarkable resilience. According to the American Chamber of Commerce’s September 2023 Ukraine survey, even one and a half years into the conflict, 98 percent of its member companies were still operational in Ukraine. Although GDP fell by nearly 30 percent in 2022, it is forecast to grow by 3.5 percent in 2023, partly due to the resilient information technology (IT) sector and the rerouting of exports. Since the war started, Ukraine attracted more than $500 million in new investments, according to data by UkraineInvest, the country’s investment promotion agency. These new investments are taking place in regions that are not under active combat, such as the western and central parts of the country. A large portion of Ukraine — close to 85 percent of its territory — is unoccupied, where businesses can operate and grow. The Global Business for Ukraine’s investment map showcases 146 investment-ready projects totaling $4.9 billion. On the other hand, large reconstruction projects in the east and southeast of Ukraine (regions that have been heavily destroyed) will probably have to wait until the war is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s allies and partners are supporting Ukraine’s right to defend itself by providing military aid. Through humanitarian and budgetary assistance — which pays the salaries of soldiers, pensioners, and teachers and finances essential public services — they are also helping the economy stay afloat. However, only a small part of this aid is being directed to help current businesses and attract new investors. Moreover, the war continues, and a political settlement is unlikely anytime soon. This complicates the situation of the private sector. Donor countries will continue supporting Ukraine, but these amounts will likely decline over time and fulfill only part of the country’s financial needs. The international community needs to work with the government of Ukraine to spur business and attract new investments into the country so they can create jobs and generate tax revenues. International financial institutions (IFIs) and development finance institutions (DFIs) could do more in this area, even amid the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian businesses have many financing needs at the moment, in particular equity investments. The capital needs are immense. The destruction of manufacturing facilities, logistical lines, and supply chains has forced some companies to rebuild their business models from scratch. Some companies were able to adapt to the war, but in many cases they require capital. The impact that new capital can produce in this environment is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IFIs and donors are exploring new finance mechanisms to support the private sector in Ukraine. They are also providing technical and legal advice on how to reform laws (e.g., the public-private partnership law) and important institutions so Ukraine can become “investor-ready.” However, as they approach operations in Ukraine, they need to be more creative, coordinated, and willing to take risks. They must devise new instruments to leverage private capital for smaller projects that could provide demonstration effects for other investors. Although these institutions are doing incredible work to support the economy, they have not adapted their business model to operate more creatively in a war zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IFIs and DFIs could set up new finance vehicles, such as investment funds where donors would provide a first-loss tranche to attract other investors. These funds could potentially be funded by using frozen Russian central bank assets worth $300 billion, or the interest proceeds, which in Europe amount to $3 billion a year. In addition, DFIs could ramp up existing risk mitigation mechanisms such as loan portfolio guarantees, which would help existing businesses access finance at reasonable rates. One example is the support that the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is lending to the Bank Lviv. Although these amounts are small, this instrument could be expanded. Additionally, a more coordinated and scalable political risk (or war risk) insurance mechanism may create the confidence needed for private sector investments to flow in Ukraine. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is working on such a scheme, but it is still not operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors also want to see more significant governance and economic reforms in Ukraine to improve the business climate in the country. This includes turbocharging anti-corruption efforts, devising a clear strategy to restructure state-owned enterprises and inefficient businesses, and de-oligarchizing the economy. This reform agenda must align with the conditions under Ukraine’s EU accession process to ensure harmonization with EU laws and standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting corruption is paramount if Ukraine wants to attract investments and join the European family. Society at large considers corruption as the number two problem in the country after the war, according to a recent survey. The latest edition of Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index shows that Ukraine still scores poorly at 36 points out of 100 (half of France’s score and 18 points behind Poland). However, Ukraine has made strong inroads in the fight against corruption, including increased criminal proceedings against suspected perpetrators, judiciary reforms, a competitive selection process for the heads of the main anti-corruption agencies, and improvements in public procurement. This is an area where the international community can play a critical role, providing both advice and pressure for reforms. Ukrainian civil society and independent journalists are important allies in this fight. Ukraine still has a long road ahead but must keep this momentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s future membership in the European Union is also a big incentive for investors. Ukraine’s entry into the European Union will provide companies with enough confidence that there is a level playing field for doing business in the country. Moreover, it will give companies access to more than 40 million consumers in Ukraine, with an added 450 million consumers in the European Union. Recent investor surveys point out that access to the EU market and EU product quality and standards are key to future business opportunities in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has huge investment potential given its low-cost skilled labor, a market size of more than 40 million consumers, and proximity to the EU market. There are many business opportunities in sectors such as oil and gas, strategic minerals, IT, and agriculture. Ukraine also has the potential to become a manufacturing hub for its neighborhood, reaching more than 800 million consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine moves away from its Soviet past and looks toward a bright economic future, developing a strong and vibrant private sector will provide tax revenues, jobs, and economic security. The international community can help provide more predictability and stability for companies operating in Ukraine and create innovative mechanisms to attract private capital. It might be risky to invest in Ukraine during wartime, but not investing is a larger missed opportunity. Ukrainians cannot wait until a peace settlement is reached. With the prospect that economic assistance will not last forever, the international community needs to find ways to make the economy more self-sufficient. The time to act is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is hard to overstate how important a Ukrainian victory — or, at the very least, a Russian loss — is for U.S. and Western interests, broadly defined. Yet it is also hard to overstate how important the issue of allied spending on defense and security (or lack thereof) is to Washington policymakers, some of whom now question why the United States — rather than Europe — must continue supporting Ukraine.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) turns 75 in 2024, and the allies will meet in the summer in Washington, D.C., to mark the occasion. A key question on many observers’ minds is, How will NATO manage what is arguably one of the biggest crises in European security in the alliance’s history — the Russian war against Ukraine? The answer to that question will, for many, inform perceptions of the utility and purpose of the alliance for both current and emerging threats to the Euro-Atlantic region. Of course, crystal balls are inherently foggy; rather than predict a specific answer, it is far better to think about what factors are likely to inform such allied decisions at NATO’s 75th anniversary summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, despite the fact that the war in Ukraine is affecting all NATO members, Ukraine itself is not a NATO member state. This is a point of frustration for several central and eastern European countries in particular, many of which waged an intense but ultimately unsuccessful diplomatic campaign for Ukraine to be invited to join the alliance in the run-up to the 2023 NATO Vilnius summit. As the logic went, inviting Ukraine to join NATO would be a way to force a cessation of hostilities, as many observers believe that Putin’s Russia does not want to want to wage war against NATO itself. The counterargument to Ukrainian NATO membership was that it would have immediately committed NATO and its member states to a major war with Russia. A half measure was instead agreed at Vilnius; among other things, Ukraine was promised membership in the future, as conditions allow, but without all the strings normally attached to the membership accession processes. But the bottom line remains that Ukraine is not a NATO ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, NATO’s responses to the Ukraine crisis are primarily inwardly focused. One major area of work addresses preparing the alliance to deter and defend against a Russian attack on NATO territories (among other threats) through a series of reorganized war plans. Another key area focuses on encouraging members to spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense programs. And still another addresses reexamining the NATO defense industrial base after shortfalls in basic areas like ammunition have become apparent. As for Ukraine, NATO will continue to aid the war-torn country through humanitarian assistance, nonlethal aid, and capacity-building measures. Allies will continue providing both lethal and nonlethal aid, assuming their domestic politics allow for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for domestic politics, therein lies the rub. It is hard to overstate how important a Ukrainian victory — or, at the very least, a Russian loss — is for U.S. and Western interests, broadly defined. Yet it is also hard to overstate how important the issue of allied spending on defense and security (or lack thereof) is to Washington policymakers, some of whom now question why the United States — rather than Europe — must continue supporting Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about “burden sharing” are as old as the alliance itself. The need for Europe to spend more on defense has been routinely expressed across U.S. administrations for decades. Prior to departing the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates argued to the allies that if they did not spend more on defense, future presidents would have a hard time making the case to continue investing in NATO. At the NATO summit in Vilnius in 2023, U.S. senator Ashley Tillis argued that burden sharing is the most critical issue before the alliance today. Yet, as of 2022, only seven European NATO states had spent 2 percent or more of their GDP on defense. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the world is where it is: the United States is frustrated that Europe does not put its money where its mouth is, and Europe is frustrated with being repeatedly browbeaten over the subject and with a U.S. presidential contender who, if elected, might attempt to pull the United States out of NATO altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate and related concerns about defense spending have been — and are — grounded in real concerns about what it takes to meaningfully defend allied territory and interests, especially as the alliance faces a Russian bear with a growing geopolitical appetite. But the problem with evaluating burden sharing against defense spending is that it turns what should be a strategic-level discussion among allies about what they can and should do to meet shared challenges into a transactional, nickel-and-dime issue of cost sharing. Because the value of NATO is being reduced to a discussion over dollars and euros, the broader strategic utility of the NATO alliance for U.S. interests is being lost. And Ukraine now hangs in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A decisive defeat of the Russian military is in the interest of the United States. Therefore, Congress should act quickly to provide Ukraine with the needed support to accomplish this goal. The longer assistance is delayed, the harder it will be to secure a Ukrainian victory and the more money and lives will be lost in the long run.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 24, 2022, millions watched in disbelief as Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Within two weeks, the U.S. Congress passed legislation allocating nearly $14 billion in support of Ukraine. Nearly two years later, the urgency in Washington seems to have evaporated. Meanwhile, Ukrainians continue to die on the front lines. Sirens continue to wail, warning citizens of incoming missiles, and mothers continue to search for their children abducted by Russian forces. Ukrainians are left to wonder, Will the world’s most powerful democracy abandon us in our darkest hour? Each passing day that Congress fails to approve additional assistance weakens the position of the Ukrainians, both militarily and politically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite waning urgency, bipartisan support in Congress for continued U.S. assistance to Ukraine remains strong. Looking at the voting patterns in the House of Representatives, where support for assistance to Ukraine is more fragile, opposition has grown slightly, but not significantly, over the past two years. Parsing out members’ positions on Ukraine can be challenging since aid has often been part of broader packages. However, three key votes can help inform the trends on support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stand-alone vote on assistance to Ukraine occurred in May 2022 when Congress took up a $39.4 billion package. Prior votes on assistance were part of larger legislative packages that garnered opposition for reasons notwithstanding assistance to Ukraine. This bill passed the House overwhelmingly by a vote of 368–57 and the Senate by a vote of 86–11. The next stand-alone votes on assistance to Ukraine did not occur until the House took up the fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). During consideration of the NDAA, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene offered an amendment to eliminate $300 million in assistance to Ukraine. The amendment failed by a vote of 341–89. Representative Matt Gaetz offered an amendment to prohibit all U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, which failed by an even wider margin, 358–70. Using the Greene and Gaetz amendment votes as a marker, a solid majority of the 221 members that make up the House Republican Conference continue to support U.S. assistance to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these vote trends tell a more positive story than what is often portrayed in the media, worries over declining support are not misplaced, particularly as the United States embarks on a hotly contested and emotionally fraught presidential campaign cycle. While U.S. president Joseph Biden is a strong supporter of continued assistance to Ukraine, many congressional Republicans feel the administration has failed to lay out a clear strategy to support victory. According to a November 2023 Gallup poll, a plurality — 41 percent — of Americans feel the United States is doing too much to support Ukraine, with 33 percent saying the United States is doing the right amount and 25 percent stating the United States is not doing enough. After February 24, 2022, President Biden did not formally address the nation again on the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine until October 2023. The president and other supporters of continued assistance to Ukraine should continue to make the case to voters about why supporting a decisive Ukrainian victory is in the interest of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their argument should be one of principles and self-interest. On principles, the case is straightforward: Russian president Vladimir Putin — an unelected dictator — invaded a sovereign nation in an attempt to overthrow Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, who was elected by the citizens of Ukraine in a free and fair election. During the course of this invasion, Russian soldiers brutally and systematically massacred noncombatant civilians. One need only stand in front of the memorial marking the mass grave in Bucha to learn of children as young as four years old being killed by the Russians. Ukrainian authorities have identified at least 16,000 children abducted by Russia since the start of the war, though they worry the true number may be far greater. The extensive documentation leaves little room to doubt Russia has committed and continues to commit crimes against humanity. Furthermore, should Putin seize control of broad swaths of Ukrainian territory, this sends the message to other dictators with expansionist ideations — such as Xi Jinping in China — that one need only to outlast the short attention span of the world’s democracies to achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the reasons to support Ukraine go beyond the moral imperative of the conflict. Analysis of the $113 billion appropriated to support Ukraine shows much of that money has gone to modernize U.S. weapons stockpiles, reinvigorate the U.S. defense industrial base, and invest in U.S. military personnel. Aid appropriated in the supplemental spending bills for Ukraine provided nearly half a billion dollars for Lockheed Martin to surge production of the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) in the town of Camden, Arkansas — a welcome economic boost. Similar infusions of spending have benefited towns across the United States, including Lima, Ohio, where Abrams tanks are produced, and Ocala, Florida, and Troy, Alabama, which are home to Javelin missile factories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the economic boon for the defense industrial base, U.S. business stands to benefit from the transformation and reconstruction of Ukraine. A World Bank estimate from March 2023 places the cost of rebuilding Ukraine at $411 billion. Continued U.S. support for Ukraine will ensure U.S. companies and businesses are welcomed to participate in the effort. Emphasizing pocketbook issues such as job creation and economic growth potential is especially important in a consequential election year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absent leadership in the White House, it is up to members of Congress to clearly articulate to their constituents why it is imperative to continue to support Ukraine’s victory. The moral argument is clear. However, politicians need to appeal to the self-interest of the American public as well. A decisive defeat of the Russian military is in the interest of the United States. Therefore, Congress should act quickly to provide Ukraine with the needed support to accomplish this goal. The longer assistance is delayed, the harder it will be to secure a Ukrainian victory and the more money and lives will be lost in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For Israel, in the years ahead, every day will be October 8 but with the fear that it is October 6. Isreal’s sense of security after decades of limited conflict with its neighbors has been shattered.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earthquakes have aftershocks,” a veteran Israeli intelligence officer told a CSIS delegation on a recent visit to that country, “and sometimes the aftershocks are more important than the earthquake.” He spoke wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Israel, this was a transformative event, every bit as much as the Six-Day War in 1967 or the 1973 Yom Kippur War. On October 7, 2023, Israel suffered an attack of unparalleled barbarity as thousands of Hamas fighters, led by the elite Nukhba forces and followed by the less disciplined Qassam Brigades and finally mobs of Gazans, attacked at over two dozen points along the frontier. During the initial fighting, 1,200 Israelis, 900 of them civilians, including children and invalids, were slaughtered; men and women were raped and mutilated; and hundreds were taken hostage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Israel, in the years ahead, every day will be October 8 but with the fear that it is October 6. Isreal’s sense of security after decades of limited conflict with its neighbors has been shattered. The existential question is on the table because Israel soon entered a war on multiple fronts including on its northern border, as Hezbollah joined in the fight in a limited way; on the West Bank; and even further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel will now no longer trust in its ability to detect and preempt threats; instead it will seek to prevent them. Israeli political and military leaders will be much more ready than in the past to initiate conflict if they think that by doing so they can reduce the possibility of another day like that one, or worse. It will arm itself more intensively and wage war with a kind of disciplined aggression it has not shown in some time. It will not crumble or weaken because it has shown itself to be a resilient society; it is wounded, enraged, and determined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting features of this war has been the muted public reactions of many governments around the world, even in the face of protests and demonstrations in the streets. Israel’s Arab partners, including Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, quietly share their fears and hatred of Hamas, itself an outgrowth of the Muslim Brotherhood. They will not openly support Israel’s actions, though they will do so quietly. The global war against extreme versions of Islamism never really ended, but it has now come back and with a vengeance. Moderate Muslim states are also going to find themselves on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Iran, the war has been a huge, if perilous, success. Its strategy of building a ring of enemies around Israel — to include Hamas (which it helped arm and train), Hezbollah in Lebanon (far more heavily equipped than Hamas), various Shiite militias in Syria that can attack Israel on the Golan Heights, and the Houthis in Yemen — seems to be working. The purpose may not be to destroy Israel in one blow but rather to weaken it in a series of wars, as Iran itself is protected by the nuclear deterrent it seeks to acquire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, considerable danger of over-reach. The Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping invite a U.S.-led response. Whether through tit-for-tat escalation or because of a decision to make a larger point, the day may well come when the United States, with or without its allies, attacks not only the Houthis but their Iranian advisers and logistics as well. Neighbors probably fear Iran more than ever and will be willing to be quiet partners in counterstrikes against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility, therefore, exists for a substantial regional war in the near future. It could come about because of an Israeli preventive war against Hezbollah or merely escalation of the fighting along the current border. It might begin in an attempt by Hezbollah to emulate Hamas with a similar strategy of building up its forces along the Israeli frontier and striking suddenly. Or it could come about through an escalation of U.S. strikes on Iranian targets in Yemen and retaliation by Iran against Persian Gulf shipping, creating a broader conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the alignment of states on the Israel-Hamas war is revealing. Russia and China are more or less openly supporting Hamas and Iran; the United States and its allies are supporting Israel. It is the same set of opposing coalitions as in the Russia-Ukraine war and, with some adjustments, the increasing tensions in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upshot is that when Hamas terrorists stormed across the fence dividing them from Israel and began the slaughter of civilians, they accelerated the division of the world into opposing blocs. They brought to the fore the challenges posed to liberal democracies in confronting enemies who openly embrace extreme brutality directed against civilians, as Russia has in Ukraine. This war is not entirely separable from other conflicts in which the United States is an interested and committed party, and it may turn out to be a trigger for other, even more devastating conflicts in the Levant, the Persian Gulf, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Israel, however, faces a different challenge in Gaza than the United States did in Iraq or Afghanistan — in many ways, a much harder one.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a shocked Israel prepared to respond to the October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack, the most devastating in Israel’s history, U.S. president Joe Biden offered some sober advice: “After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.” Looking back at the U.S. wars on terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq, Biden, along with many American strategists, urged Israel to heed the lessons the United States won so dearly and avoid the many mistakes made along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons from Afghanistan and Iraq are extensive and still being compiled, but how relevant are they to Israel’s situation with Hamas? As might be expected, some apply more than others, and a few do not apply at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. counterinsurgency model, as embodied in documents like Joint Publication 3-24, Counterinsurgency, stresses the political side of counterinsurgency. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States focused largely on defeating Saddam Hussein’s regime and the Taliban but less on what should replace them, resulting in sustained — and, in the case of the Taliban in Afghanistan, successful — insurgencies. Establishing a legitimate and competent government after military victory is vital, as this ensures support from the people and allows law enforcement and social services to function. All this requires empowering local partners, who will bear the brunt of the fighting. In Afghanistan, the United States lost 2,443 troops, while the Afghan military lost at least 66,000, to say nothing of the tens of thousands of Afghan civilian casualties. Strong local partners and successful governance, in turn, ensure popular support. As Chinese leader Mao Zedong famously argued, the guerrillas must swim in the sea of the people, and if the people are against the guerrillas, then their end is certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the United States now prefers to avoid long wars and accept that some level of risk is inevitable. The U.S. preference is to conduct shorter counterterrorism-focused efforts rather than grinding occupations that require decades of effort. When sustained insurgencies must be fought, the United States seeks to work with local governments, warlords, or other partners, supporting them with training and, at times, airstrikes or other limited military support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these lessons are applicable to Israel’s current war with Hamas. Most importantly, Israel must develop a long-term political strategy for Gaza. As Raphael Cohen has argued, the current situation has grown, in part, out of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Israel’s decades-long failed strategy of “mowing the grass” in Gaza — which attempted to both contain and deter Hamas in Gaza, while simultaneously not addressing any of the underlying economic and political conditions that had helped bring Hamas into power and keep it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel, however, faces a different challenge in Gaza than the United States did in Iraq or Afghanistan — in many ways, a much harder one. Geography poses the first problem. Gaza is on Israel’s doorstep, while the United States has the luxury of distance. What happened in Baghdad or Kabul did not pose an immediate threat to the U.S. homeland. Israel cannot wash its hands of Gaza as the United States eventually did with Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, Israel has had a less solutionist approach than the United States. It sees Palestinian hatred as almost inevitable, and the Second Intifada and the 2005 Gaza withdrawal proved to many Israelis that concessions to Palestinian leaders would be met with violence (though the truth is far more complex). The latest Hamas attack, made in the aftermath of what Israel saw as an accommodating approach to Hamas in Gaza, will reinforce this view. Thus, Israelis believe a political approach designed to win over the Palestinian people is doomed to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel also lacks local partners who might govern Gaza and serve Israeli interests. In Afghanistan and Iraq, numerous local leaders sought to work with the United States against the insurgents (even as they were often critical of U.S. policies), and they had genuine support among many communities in these countries. Israel will find few, if any, Palestinians willing to work with it, in part because its policies have steadily undermined the more pro-peace Palestinian Authority, convincing many Palestinians that Israel will respond only to force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Israel must engage in military operations in a saturated media environment, with widespread transparency regarding civilian casualties, destruction of infrastructure in Gaza, and other horrors of war. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the battlefields were remote, and much of the fighting occurred when social media was in its infancy. Now the genuine destructiveness of the Israeli response (worsened by widespread misinformation) is there for all to see, eroding international support for Israel, including in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biden and other U.S. leaders are right to urge caution on Israel and to encourage Israeli security officials to understand what the United States has learned in its various wars on terrorism. But the Israeli war on Hamas has its own characteristics, many of which are far more difficult than what the United States faced in Afghanistan or Iraq. As a result, Israel will learn its own lessons — and make its own mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Israelis may fantasize about a divorce from Palestinians, but their actions for three-quarters of a century have made that increasingly impossible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With violence between Palestinians and Israelis at its highest levels in decades, voices again have risen in favor of a two-state solution. The idea — a Jewish homeland and an Arab one carved out of Mandatory Palestine — dates back to the United Nations’ 1947 partition plan, but it has seemed increasingly remote. In the weeks before October 7, the growing consensus was that the window for a two-state solution had closed. The current violence has persuaded many that the idea needs to be revived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed it does, but doing so will require the redefinition of some terms — for starters, “two,” and “state,” and “solution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with “two.” Seventy-five years of history have intertwined the fates of Arabs and Jews far more than had ever been contemplated. Not only has Jewish settlement extended deep into formerly Arab areas, but the 20 percent of Israeli citizens who are non-Jewish Arabs have come to think of their Palestinian-ness (and Israeli-ness) in complex and connected ways. Resources, not least water, are inextricably linked, but even things as mundane as wireless spectrum are completely intertwined. Israelis may fantasize about a divorce from Palestinians, but their actions for three-quarters of a century have made that increasingly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palestinians have been enveloped in that process, too. The Palestinian economy has become deeply integrated with the Israeli economy, even as permission to work in Israel is unreliable. Just last summer, Israel was the destination for 90 percent of Palestinian exports and the source of 58 percent of its imports. While Palestine certainly needs a more diversified economy and set of trade ties, building it all from scratch without taking advantage of Israeli infrastructure and ports, not to mention the technical skills for things like managing the money supply and credit markets, will make the task infinitely harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each side has ample evidence from the past 30 years of how hard arm’s length cooperation is. Palestinians note that Israeli security forces not only have continually burst into areas of supposed Palestinian self-rule but also have been lax on vigilante settlers who seek to be a law unto themselves. Not unreasonably, they see Israeli businesspeople taking advantage of Palestine as a captive market to their own advantage and at the expense of Palestinian interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israelis have complained that Palestinian security cooperation has always been grudging and incomplete, and they blame poor Palestinian economic performance on corruption and incompetence rather than Israeli exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than more separation, however, the anti-dote to these complaints is greater integration, albeit with outside enforcement. A multinational endeavor with Israelis and Palestinians at its core, with the active participation of Americans, Europeans, regional governments, and others, will be awkward at first. But giving Palestinians and Israelis greater visibility into each other’s actions will give greater confidence. Equally important will be noting when cooperation is not forthcoming, also giving greater confidence that agreements cannot be ignored without consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;state&quot;&gt;State&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where “state” needs to be redefined. What will emerge is something less than a Westphalian state with complete control over what happens within its borders, and not just for Palestinians. Israel will also need to open its decisionmaking to justify some of its actions to others, and to consider the broader implications of actions it principally targets at its own citizens. The European Union has shown much of this is possible, but what will be required here will be more intrusive and less consensual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this will be messy, which brings us to the last problem in this trilogy: the “solution.” One might object that what is described here is not a solution at all, because it will require sustained engagement and struggle from two parties who were largely estranged before the massacres of October 7, and are even more estranged in their aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the challenge, each side is convinced that sizeable constituencies on the other side ultimately seek domination and not coexistence. While this reality cannot be willed away, much less ignored, one thing is especially encouraging. That is, through more than three decades of polling, it is clear how dynamic the support for coexistence has been, and therefore how dynamic the support can be. It responds to conditions, and it responds to actions. There is little question that, right now, it is close to bottom, and there is tremendous upward potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategy of this sort will be unacceptable to both sides, at least initially. It is not what they have been fighting for over the last 75 years, and it feels inadequate. Even so, it gives us a new construct to work from, and a new construct is necessary. For decades, most of Israel’s peace negotiations were built around the idea of “land for peace.” But what was successful with Egypt did not work with Syria, and it certainly did not work with Palestine. Israel has both political and security reasons to move away from that formula. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is determined to preserve Israeli communities scattered throughout historic Judea and Samaria, in areas designated for a future Palestinian state. He speaks derisively of the potential emergence of “Hamastan” and “Fatahstan” on Israel’s borders, and he vows to block it. On these issues, there is a fair amount of Israeli unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And at the same time, Palestinians look at the fragmented ink blots of “Area A” on the West Bank, supposedly under full Palestinian control yet largely at the mercy of Israeli decisions. Palestinians have come to regard the Oslo agreement of 1993 as a ruse that left them powerless, dominated, and immiserated. Israel’s cordon around Gaza, and its actions over the last three months inside of it, reinforces Palestinians’ despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rethinking the terms of what a two-state solution might look like will not be satisfying. Each side feels it gave the other a chance through the Oslo Accords, only to see the depth of its adversary’s hostility. Events of the last three months have convinced even more that the other side has no respect for human life. This is no basis on which to build a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the two sides surely have shared interests, not least the desire to create a future of greater security, prosperity, and freedom for their children. Seventy-five years of fighting has not gotten either side what it wanted. Thinking through ways to enlarge definitions and introduce outside monitors will not end conflict, but it could go a long way to end bloodshed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Unless the United States commits to rigorous diplomacy to resolve conflicts and properly manage crises, especially those like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the United States has unique leverage, these forever wars will spiral.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is awash with seemingly endless conflicts. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict exemplifies the most common variety: a local conflict that simmers with sporadic, unpredictable, and devastating surges in violence. Despite this growing trend, the United States has tried to narrowly focus on great power competition, particularly with China. But just as in the Cold War, those local conflicts are where global competition is most likely to play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the left and right in the United States have advocated for an end to “forever wars.” But in the sunset of unsuccessful U.S. forays in the Middle East, another kind of forever war is emerging and threatens to affect U.S. interests for the next two decades. Local and civil wars, like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, are dramatically increasing in number, intensity, and length around the world. While 2023 saw the highest number of violent conflicts since World War II, 2022 saw more battlefield deaths than any year since 1994. These crises have nearly tripled in duration since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. foreign policy tends to sidestep the drivers of these conflicts and their discontents. In an effort to downsize its approach to peripheral regions like the Middle East, the United States has instead focused on encouraging deals between strongmen and dealing with crises through increasingly anemic humanitarian aid. Even in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the United States has been an integral actor for decades, the U.S. government has sidelined Palestinians in favor of elite bargains with Arab states, otherwise known as the Abraham Accords. The United States and its Western allies have then dealt with the Palestinians through aid. As seen in the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli offensive on Gaza, the strategy is not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Gaza is the most dramatic example of this failure in 2023, it is hardly the only one. From Yemen and Syria to East Africa, protracted conflicts and fragile states have become vectors for instability. The United States deals with all these protracted crises in a similar way but with even less interest, seeing them as more peripheral or even irrelevant to great power competition. Nevertheless, in many ways these conflicts will challenge the narrow U.S. response to great power competition. The instability they create spills across borders and distracts the United States. The vulnerability inherent in protracted crises allows others to take advantage, and the U.S. response or lack of response provides an avenue for enemies to criticize U.S. hypocrisy or ineptitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reignited conflicts have the power to quickly inflame an unstable region. The escalation in Gaza exemplifies the potential ripple effect of localized violence. As the war in Gaza escalated, the regime under Syrian president Bashar al-Assad stepped up attacks in northwestern Syria, and Iranian-backed militants launched attacks on bases and facilities housing U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria — 130 attacks in under three months — injuring dozens of service members. In a globalized world, local events can quickly have global consequences. Houthi attacks on shipping vessels forced several major shipping lines — representing 60 percent of global trade — and oil giants like BP to suspend their services through the Red Sea. The attacks eventually forced the United States to strike targets in Yemen. Each of these events has its own destabilizing consequences, and all of them are distracting from the issues the U.S. government wants to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ great power competitors also gain from these protracted crises in different ways. Both Russia and China gain from U.S. distraction and redirection of U.S. resources. Russia will gain directly from U.S. efforts to provide military support to Israel as it diverts attention and resources from Ukraine. Putin also gains by directly intervening in many of these local conflicts, which the United States considers less strategic. In Sudan, Russia reaps the benefits of the country’s gold and continues to push for a naval base in the Red Sea. In Syria, Putin’s support for a struggling Assad won Russia an air base and warm-water port to expand its influence in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia are also able to manipulate the United States’ chosen path for managing these crises: aid. For aid workers, China’s support of North Korea and Russia’s support of Syria have made principled and adequate humanitarian responses nearly impossible. As aid workers struggling with aid diversion in North Korea said in 2018, “If China and Russia were not supporting the Kim regime behind the scenes, then . . . foreign aid groups would have much more bargaining power.” In Syria, the Assad regime egregiously diverts aid with little to no accountability as a result of Russia’s protection. China and Russia have since expanded these protections to other states in Africa, making conflict management through humanitarian aid even less feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indirectly, Russia and China gain from arguing the United States is hypocritical and ineffective on the world stage. For many countries in the Global South, support for Ukraine waned because of U.S. double standards in Iraq and Israel. For these countries, the United States’ inconsistent application of norms in the name of national interests excuses them from violating those same rules occasionally. While China and Russia may protect a state’s ability to impede aid and commit violence, for 153 countries at the UN General Assembly, the United States is doing the same for Israel at the UN Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless the United States commits to rigorous diplomacy to resolve conflicts and properly manage crises, especially those like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the United States has unique leverage, these forever wars will spiral. The compounding damage to U.S. interests is likely to be long lasting. To combat it, the U.S. government would do well to view the challenge as Franklin D. Roosevelt saw it in 1941:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must recognize that the hostilities in Europe, in Africa, and in Asia are all parts of a single world conflict. . . . Our strategy of self-defense must be a global strategy which takes account of every front and takes advantage of every opportunity to contribute to our total security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;War is by its nature disruptive — to life, business, and society. The longer the war, the greater the economic hit. Israel’s tech sector must once again prove resilient enough to recover and reengage with the global economy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragic toll of Hamas’s October 7 attacks can be counted in lives lost and homes destroyed, but a second-order effect lurks on the horizon: a damaged Israeli economy and a potentially massive disruption to Israel’s tech sector. That tech sector has served as an economic engine for Israel and an innovation engine for the globe. While Israeli tech has weathered recent conflicts well, the extent of this mobilization and a weaker economic context are likely to significantly delay, if not disrupt, Israeli tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workforce disruptions are the main driver of potential economic impact. In response to the October 7 attack, the Israel Defense Forces mobilized 360,000 reservists, approximately 4 percent of Israel’s total population. This marks one of the largest mobilizations in Israel’s history, eclipsed only by the 400,000 reservists called up during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In contrast, Israel’s most significant recent mobilizations were the 2014 Gaza War, with 75,000 reservists, and the 2006 Second Lebanon War, with 89,000 reservists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dent in the workforce is far greater than the call-up of reserves: at the height of the disruption, this conflict removed an estimated 764,000 Israelis, or 18 percent of the total workforce, between reserve mobilization, evacuations near the Gazan and Lebanese borders, and school closures requiring parental care at home. Recent estimates suggest that as of December, an estimated 500,000 Israelis, or 12 percent of the workforce, are still not working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mobilization has likely hit tech start-ups harder than average, given staff at start-ups skew young and much of Israel’s tech sector sprang out of skills gained in service with the IDF. According to a survey conducted by Start-Up Nation Policy Institute (SNPI), an estimated 15–20 percent of tech sector employees were mobilized, and 25 percent of company respondents reported experiencing a shortage of personnel. According to Avi Eyal of Entrée Capital, 10–30 percent of start-up employees mobilized, representing a substantial reduction in staff and a prolonged break in innovation, project development, and client servicing. Start-ups tend to operate on a skeleton staff, making them less resilient to prolonged staff disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech disruption will have an outsize impact on Israel’s economy. Israel’s tech sector represents around 18–20 percent of GDP in contrast to 9.3 percent in the United States and 6 percent in the European Union. High-tech products constitute around 50 percent of Israel’s exports. Further, foreign direct investment in the Israeli tech sector is critical, and much of that funding may be in peril. As of late October, approximately 40 percent of surveyed tech firms experienced disruptions in their financing efforts, with many investment agreements either canceled or placed on hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the labor gap is temporary and the reservists demobilize in weeks rather than months, some disruptions may be irreparable. A recent Israel Innovation Authority and SNPI survey revealed more than 70 percent of start-ups surveyed delayed or abandoned new orders and projects. This was primarily due to challenges in conducting pilots and clinical trials, progressing research and development initiatives, and exporting and importing essential products. Those disruptions are on top of signs the sector was already weakening following Israel’s domestic political unrest. Reports from December indicate Israeli start-ups only raised $1.3 billion between October and December, a 46 percent drop from the same time the year before, marking a new six-year low in Israeli start-up funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall economic impact could be double that of previous conflicts. The Bank of Israel has determined the 2014 Gaza War reduced Israel’s GDP by 0.4 percent, and the Second Lebanon War by 0.5 percent. The estimate for the current conflict is 0.7 percent for 2023. In December, the Bank of Israel once again revised downward the growth projections for 2024, from 3 percent before October 7 to 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, advances like using the cloud to deliver products have made Israeli tech more resilient, and recent history suggests a bounce back is possible. In 2014 tech bounced back robustly as venture capital investments steadily increased from $2.9 billion in 2014 to $5.6 billion in 2016. But just as the conflict in 2014 was different from that in 2023, the world economy has also changed. Bloomberg predicted an escalation in the conflict — like recent Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea — could send global oil prices soaring. Global growth could drop to 1.7 percent, an estimated $1 trillion off global output. The global economy is still feeling the effects of a war in Ukraine, monetary policy is tighter, and there is continuing uncertainty surrounding the multitude of elections in 2024. Conditions will be more challenging for a quick bounce back this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel is wisely acting fast to bolster the tech sector. As of early January, the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) had begun to deploy $100 million in emergency aid for start-ups. The New York Times reported that chip giant Intel announced it would proceed with a planned $25 billion investment to expand a factory in southern Israel, having received a $3.2 billion grant from the government. For the economy more broadly, Israel has slowly tried to fill the labor gap by increasing the number of foreign workers in the country, with more than 12,000 foreign workers arriving as of December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War is by its nature disruptive — to life, business, and society. The longer the war, the greater the economic hit. Israel’s tech sector must once again prove resilient enough to recover and reengage with the global economy. It is telling the world it is ready to do just that. Early in the conflict, the IIA started a new campaign with this tag line: “Israeli tech delivers. NO MATTER WHAT.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;張劍虹認警員赴收押所探訪數小時 翌日突表示願做控方證人 辯方質疑被游說&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/f4ozB3M.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（1日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第21日審訊。認罪候判的前《蘋果日報》社長張劍虹，繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。辯方盤問時透露，2021年11月一名警署警長到荔枝角收押所要求會見張，會面長達約6小時。翌日該警長連同另一名偵緝警員再度造訪，而張在該次會面中突然提出有說話想向警方講，以及想成為控方證人。其後張轉換律師代表，並去信律政司表達意願。辯方質疑，警長游說張做控方證人，惟張否認，堅稱會面純粹談論荔枝角的生活和運動。他又補充：「因為我睇完個判詞之後，自己開始去諗，想講返個事實出嚟囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方透露警署警長到收押所會見張劍虹-長達6小時&quot;&gt;辯方透露警署警長到收押所會見張劍虹 長達6小時&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，張劍虹於2021年11月5日向高院申請保釋，即日遭法官李素蘭拒絕，而拒絕保釋理由於11月10日以書面形式頒布。至11月11日，一名警署警長前往荔枝角羈押所探訪張劍虹，並把書面判詞送達給張劍虹。張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指根據紀錄，當天警長與張於荔枝角會面長達6小時。張表示不太記得該次會面歷時多久，只記得「係好耐啦」。辯方追問，是否由早上10時直至下午4時？張表示大概是，因為當日早上約10時親友探訪完畢，「之後有人通知我有警察嚟搵我」，會面中間沒有午飯時間，會見完才返回監倉吃飯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，一份只有10頁紙的判決理由書，警署警長理應不需要很長時間解釋。張則表示警長沒有替他解釋該理由書，乃由他自行閱讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹確認向警方提出有說話想講及想做控方證人-之後轉換律師代表&quot;&gt;張劍虹確認向警方提出「有說話想講」及想做控方證人 之後轉換律師代表&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指11月12日，警長再度前往荔枝角收押所會見張，並且聯同另一名偵緝警員8315。辯方指，張在偵緝警員8315面前，突然表示他有說話想向警方講，以及想成為控方證人。張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，此後張辭退原本的事務律師行羅拔臣（同為黎智英的代表律師行），然後聘用新的事務律師行，而新的律師代表於12月16日去信律政司，指稱警方邀請張出任控方證人。張僅稱：「呢個我唔清楚。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示律師行信件，當中張的律師代表透露，經公務探訪和索取當事人指示後，律師得悉警方邀請張出任控方證人，而張確認若果控方有需要的話，他會準備做控方證人及向控方提供協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，張此前一直在警署錄影會面保持緘默，但在2021年11月12日會見警員之後，卻決定出任控方證人。在法官李運騰的澄清下，張確認該些錄影會面是在他未被落案起訴之前進行的，而他當時正行使緘默權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹稱與警會面數小時僅談論荔枝角生活-辯方質疑警游說做控方證人&quot;&gt;張劍虹稱與警會面數小時僅談論荔枝角生活 辯方質疑警游說做控方證人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問張，警署警長有否游說他做控方證人，張說：「冇。」辯方追問，在如此長時間的面談中，張與警員談論了什麼。張表示：「喺荔枝角嘅生活呀、運動呀嗰啲嘢，都係嗰啲普通嘢，冇乜嘢。」辯方遂質疑，雙方花了數個小時，僅僅談論關於張在荔枝角的生活？張確認：「係，主要係講呢啲嘢。」辯方再問，警署警長並非張的朋友，當時雙方僅第一次見面，張同意。他補充：「因為我睇完個判詞之後，自己開始去諗，想講返個事實出嚟囉。但我冇同嗰個警員講我呢個諗法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提議，張決定做控方證人，是因為警署警長的說話，問張是否同意。張斷言否認：「唔同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹確認撰寫誓章時相信蘋果合法地營運&quot;&gt;張劍虹確認撰寫誓章時相信《蘋果》合法地營運&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方昨日提到張劍虹向高院申請保釋時，向法庭提交了一份誓章。辯方今再展示誓章內容，張當時稱相信《蘋果日報》會持續合法地營運下去，而黎智英被捕之後，高層明白難以完全釋除員工疑慮，他只能盡量提醒員工謹慎和不要情緒化。張又指，若果員工因工作關係而面對法律程序，壹傳媒集團會提供法律援助，但張當時認為可能性不大。張確認上述是當時信念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於張在全體員工大會發言稱：「唔代表我哋褪軚，《蘋果日報》冇褪軚空間」，他在誓章中解釋意思是指《蘋果》會繼續如常運作，核心價值和信念原則不變。辯方問張在撰寫誓章時是否相信，《蘋果》一直合法地營運，不曾違反法律，而且所持守的核心價值和原則是完全合法（perfectly lawful）。張確認，並稱當時提醒同事工作時盡量不要情緒化。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹黎智英被起訴還柙後-高層將黎的敏感文章和影片下架&quot;&gt;張劍虹：黎智英被起訴還柙後 高層將黎的敏感文章和影片下架&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張又提到，在國安法生效之前，他們「一路以嚟按住黎生嘅指示去做」；國安法生效之後，「黎生一直表示佢唔驚，會繼續去抗爭啦，所以佢開咗Live Chat，繼續講佢要講嘅嘢」，惟一眾管理層員工都很擔心國安法的影響，於是成立一些國安法應變群組、舉辦法律座談會，希望在紅線之內去工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續指，直至黎於2020年12月被正式落案控告國安法及還柙之後，他們便將黎的敏感文章和影片都下架，「至到我講呢番說話時（撰寫誓章內容），一路都希望蘋果日報做緊嘅嘢係合符法律嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問是否核心價值和信念不變，但行動會隨時勢改變，例如有些文章在國安法之前不違法，但在國安法生效之後便要下架。張確認，並指戴耀廷和黎智英涉及國安法的文章均有下架。張特別提到，不過即使國安法生效，黎生的「成敗樂一笑」專欄文章和Live Chat 影片，「我哋冇辦法將佢哋下架，因為佢係老闆嘅文章吖嘛。」他又說：「我哋冇辦法去阻止黎生去發表成敗樂一笑同Live Chat影片嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，黎首次被捕直至被正式控告期間，其專欄文章和Live Chat影片是否仍然可以在《蘋果》網站見到？張確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指國安法生效後-編採政策有重大轉變-避免觸犯國安法&quot;&gt;辯方指國安法生效後 編採政策有重大轉變 避免觸犯國安法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官再問，在國安法生效前後，編採政策有沒有任何改變？張表示「唔會有咩好大改變」。不過，辯方則指編採政策有重大改變，因任何文章和影片都不能違反國安法，問張是否同意。張僅表示當時不太清楚「紅線喺邊」，所以記憶中編採政策上轉變不是很大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但張亦指曾經舉辦內部法律座談會，並轉述律師講過，若報導有人上街持「光時」旗，只要不是提出主張，便沒有問題。他同意辯方所指，相關政策是為了盡量避免違反國安法，不過他認為黎智英的專欄文章和Live Chat節目則由其本人決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹過往兩度涉藐視法庭程序-事後舉辦員工內部法律座談會&quot;&gt;張劍虹過往兩度涉藐視法庭程序 事後舉辦員工內部法律座談會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續引述誓章內容，當中張否認參與串謀犯罪計劃之中，也表明從來無意作出危害國家安全的行為。張確認，但亦承認他在資深大律師和法律團隊的代表下，早前已經承認了控罪。他又確認其法律代表來自一間受人敬重的律師行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;誓章另外提到，張過往曾兩度牽涉藐視法庭程序，他解釋事後有作出補救措施，包括舉辦員工內部法律座談會，以防止同類事件再次發生。辯方指，上述做法與因應國安法而舉辦座談會相似，均為了避免觸犯法律。張同意。被問到這做法有否獲得黎的支持和認可，張表示：「有架呢個。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，《蘋果日報》在2013年大角嘴夫婦被肢解一案進入法律程序後，派出記者到監獄採訪夫婦的兒子、疑兇周凱亮，並刊登報導，當時擔任總編輯的張劍虹承認藐視法庭。《壹週刊》於1997年在一宗有陪審團的民事訴訟案件期間，刊出有關律師費的報導，被指可能造成審訊不公，當時張任職《壹傳媒》總編輯，承認藐視法庭罪。兩案均被判罰款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱報導大陸負面新聞-是為了促進透明度和改善管治&quot;&gt;辯方稱報導大陸負面新聞 是為了促進透明度和改善管治&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示WhatsApp 群組「Index」對話，群組成員只得黎智英、張劍虹和筆名盧峯的馮偉光。2020年7月10日紀錄顯示，黎智英談及有關大陸的報導不是去「踢爆」，而是透過大數據去找出問題，然後「以數據事實糾正」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指由此可見，《蘋果》報導有關大陸的負面新聞，目的是為了促進中國政府透明度和改善管治。惟張不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方黎智英沒有說過做到俾人冚為止-張否認&quot;&gt;辯方：黎智英沒有說過「做到俾人冚為止」 張否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張昨日提及，2021年4月底到獄中探訪黎時，他曾向黎提及員工擔心《蘋果》會「過唔到七一」，並請示黎，黎當時回應：「點解要自己執咗佢？不如做到俾人冚為止啦。」張今確認該次探訪中，同場還有黎的兩名兒子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，黎根本沒有說過該番說話。張不同意，堅稱黎有說過。他又憶述黎另外吩咐他，叫行政總監黃偉強將黎私人掛在公司的黃永玉畫作搬走，「因為黎生話呢啲畫係值錢嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問張知不知道，自2021年3月起，黎已開始就應否關閉壹傳媒旗下的不同子公司，積極地咨詢董事局意見。張表示沒印象，僅記得黎在2021年2月或之前指示過要處理台灣《蘋果日報》的虧損。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指出，黎智英與張劍虹及所有同事之間，從來沒有一個串謀犯罪計劃去發布煽動性文章，問張是否同意。張表示「唔同意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While considerable attention has been paid to how unwanted Russian actions in the maritime domain can be deterred, less has been paid to the maritime contribution to deterrence more broadly defined. The authors argue that this is a gap in the literature that needs to be filled, since the maritime domain remains an area of overwhelming Allied advantage. The function of this paper is to contribute to discussions of how actions at sea can translate into strategic effects on land in the context of the European theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s application of maritime power can better translate into strategic effects with three subtle changes: firstly, through the creation of an environment that forces Russia to expend resources on capabilities needed to deny the open ocean to NATO navies; secondly, the employment of maritime forces can serve as a war termination tool by increasing the costs of a protracted conflict in tandem with ground forces, which deny short-term gains; and finally, because many of the platforms which Russia employs for sub-strategic nuclear use are either maritime or, like strategic bombers, can be impacted from the sea with conventional capabilities, a maritime threat to the bulk of Russia’s sub-strategic launch capability can considerably alter perceptions of a favourable strategic balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines a strategy for how Allied maritime power could be employed to create costly capability requirements for Russia, in order to offset the country’s competitive edge in other domains. The paper’s key findings are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia views the maritime domain as critical to the strategic balance – in other words, the capacity to both strike an adversary’s homeland and deflect strikes on Russia itself. Its view of the role of its navy is one that de-emphasises purely naval functions such as seizing sea control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The capabilities that Russia needs to perform both functions are among those which it will find most difficult to generate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By investing in maritime capabilities such as long-range precision strike and operating at a higher tempo on Russia’s extended periphery, the members of NATO can impose opportunity costs on Russia’s military. Investments in deflecting Allied maritime power will prove unavoidable for Russia, and will divert critical resources from its recapitalisation of other joint capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO should, however, recognise its own shortfalls, including the subset of challenges related to military capacity. Firstly, capabilities needed to compete effectively with the Russian Federation in the medium term will be required in a 10-year timeframe, which is shorter than procurement times for most major programmes. The second likely concern is a lack of platforms to hold strike assets, and this also needs to be mitigated. In addition, different approaches to anti-submarine warfare could expand the threat envelope for opponents and mitigate the Alliance’s own potential shortfalls in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the question in each instance will be whether the capabilities developed will impose more costs than those required to develop them in the first place. It is conceivable that even marginal investments in the areas described will impose disproportionately costly adaptations on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sources informing this paper included desk research on Allied and Russian capabilities, as well as an examination of Russian military literature to identify areas where Russian authors perceive their nation to be vulnerable in the maritime domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of how Allied maritime power should be employed against a continental rival spurred considerable debate during the Cold War. Some saw the maritime preponderance of the Alliance as an asymmetrical advantage which might be used to offset Soviet advantages on the ground. Others, by contrast, emphasised the centrality of deterrence through denial against the Red Army, which remained the sword arm of Soviet power (as Russian ground forces remain to this day), and contended that the primary function of maritime power should be to contain Russian threats to sea lines of communication at chokepoints such as the Greenland–Iceland–UK (GIUK) Gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the Russian challenge bears certain similarities with, though is not identical to, that posed by the USSR. Russia remains primarily a land power with a more limited capacity for power projection at sea. This having been said, the Russian navy, officially known as the Military Maritime Fleet (Voyenno-Morskoi Flot, or VMF), does play an important role in Russia’s overarching approach to competition and conflict. In competition, the VMF is expected to support limited power projection, as it did in Syria through the provision of logistical lift and long-range precision strikes. As competition escalates, the VMF plays three core roles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Limiting the threat to the Russian homeland and in particular its defence industry, command and control (C2) nodes and nuclear-capable platforms. The VMF is expected to achieve this both through an active effort to disrupt threats from the maritime direction at reach and with a layered defence close to Russian shores.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conducting long-range conventional strikes against the territory of hostile states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintaining a portion of Russia’s tactical and strategic nuclear throw-weight&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, the Russian state views the sea as critical to shaping the strategic balance within which general purpose forces are used. Rather than naval combat per se, the purpose of Russian sea power is to ensure that the Russian state can compete and engage in conflict safely and effectively. To be sure, this is by no means the only function of Russian sea power, but it is central and has been demonstrated in the use of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in the ongoing conflict with Ukraine. In Ukraine, the key contributions of the Black Sea Fleet – long-range Kalibr strikes and an ongoing blockade – are not central to Russia’s goal of destroying the Ukrainian army (though strikes can contribute to missions such as interdiction). What the fleet has contributed, however, is a level of economic damage that will shape both Ukraine’s capacity to confront Russia in the long term and its post-war stability. With its deployment in the Mediterranean before the war, the fleet was likely intended to act in a deterrent role vis-à-vis NATO by serving both as a tripwire and a symbol. In effect, its role has been not to secure sea control, but to provide strategic shaping for land forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of both the new Strategic Concept and the Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area framework, how should Allied maritime power best reinforce the goals set out for NATO, which focus on reinforcing the Alliance’s capacity for territorial defence within Europe and the more broadly defined growing competition with Russia? The assertion of this paper is that the focus can, in principle, be on committing Russia to an unsustainable posture in the maritime domain that detracts from its more lethal land aspirations. The Alliance has avenues through which, by exacerbating pervasive Russian fears regarding threats in the maritime domain, it can both reinforce general deterrence and force the VMF to adapt in ways that impose opportunity costs on it in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core function of Allied maritime power, though by no means an exclusive one, can be its use as a means of shaping Russian perceptions of the strategic balance, as opposed to the military balance. (The latter might be understood as the ability to impact targets of critical national significance at depth, as distinct from fielded forces.) Specifically, by shaping Russian leaders’ perceptions of the relative risks involved in escalation, as well as the conditions under which war termination would occur, maritime power can complement an overarching strategic focus on both competition and deterrence by denial. Rather than contributing directly to denial, the function of maritime power would be indirect – by forcing Russia to commit to its own defences in the maritime domain, it would divert critical Russian resources to tasks that the Alliance deems less threatening. Furthermore, in a crisis or a conflict, this would complement deterrence by denial. Denial has the primary role of preventing an opponent from achieving an outcome rapidly and, while important, in a conflict this merely sets the conditions for war termination to be achieved by other means. Failing this, an opponent that is initially frustrated can double down on its objectives, particularly if it perceives there to be avenues by which it can win through exhaustion. A case in point would be Russia’s ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where, upon being frustrated in its initial approach, Russia shifted to a strategy of attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach outlined above is comparable to the Allied maritime strategies adopted in the late 1980s, in terms of their strategic logic of identifying and playing on existing Russian fears, and their emphasis on maritime power as a tool of war termination. However, a different set of tools can be employed operationally to obviate some of the challenges inherent in replicating this strategy today, among them the difficulty of operating forward in defended bastions, particularly with current submarine numbers, and the escalatory risks of doing so. At the operational level, Allied maritime power will be most effective if it is capable of delivering effects at reach and if it can complicate some of the challenges that Russia faces with respect to engaging dynamic targets. This is distinct from the maritime strategy of the 1980s, which envisioned operating as closely as possible to defended Russian bastions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, a core function of Allied maritime power ought not to be deterrence by denial but the diversion of Russian capability and the cultivation of a favourable strategic balance. Though this can serve the overarching goal of general deterrence, it is distinct from deterrence understood as the use of specific threats or instruments to dissuade specific actions. The authors argue that this framing can usefully act as a baseline through which the employment of Allied capabilities in theatres such as the High North can be contextualised, as well as a means of better understanding the interrelationships between the individual regions which collectively form the maritime periphery of European NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this paper, the authors utilise a combination of methods to validate their argument, which includes an analysis of Russian military journals to ascertain where Russian officers perceive themselves to be facing capability gaps, as well as research into the capabilities that Russia and the Alliance currently field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-enduring-russian-threat&quot;&gt;The Enduring Russian Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia will, in all likelihood, pose a limited conventional threat to the Alliance for up to a decade, due both to its losses and to its ongoing commitments in Ukraine, this could change once the country has reconstituted its land forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, it was reported that the Russian state would allocate 40% of its federal budget to defence, and the Russian regime intended to increase the size of its army by 400,000 recruits. While it remains to be seen whether the Russian state is capable of sustaining an increased rate of military expenditure over the medium to long term, it should be noted that there is limited historical evidence for the argument that it cannot do so. States facing considerable economic pressures have nonetheless maintained levels of spending that, proportionately speaking, match Russia’s: Iran, for example, maintained a defence budget which represented 4–5% of its GDP over the course of the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign. Indeed, even during the 1990s, Russia itself typically spent at least 3% of its GDP on defence for most of the decade. It is therefore plausible that Russia will maintain its current levels of military expenditure, representing around 5% of its GDP, in the face of economic circumstances which, though negative and characterised by sluggish forecasted growth, are not nearly as bad as those of the 1990s, with the country’s GDP falling by 45% between 1989 and 1998. For Europe, this creates the challenge of deterring a competitor which, though it remains plagued by qualitative inefficiencies, can generate and replace forces at a scale which European nations will presently struggle to match – a challenge which will become more acute as the US has to allocate an ever-growing proportion of its resources to competition with a peer competitor in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of a larger, if less sophisticated, Russian threat on the ground could coincide with a greater emphasis on the use of nuclear brinkmanship as a tool of statecraft. While there has been no explicit shift in Russian nuclear policy, statements both by figures within the regime, such as Nikolai Patrushev, and by academics, such as Sergei Karaganov, suggest that this is at least being debated. Certainly, there is precedent for this – Russia’s 2000 nuclear doctrine for example, conceived of a large set of scenarios to which nuclear weapons could be relevant. Moreover, as the US grapples with extended nuclear deterrence against two nuclear peers by 2030, the nuclear balance underpinning existing Western deterrence will have shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is thus not inconceivable (though admittedly not certain) that in a decade, Russia will pose a renewed conventional threat backed by an arsenal that is sufficiently large and diversified to be able to provide it with flexible nuclear options that the Alliance lacks. Alternatively, Russia might opt for a strategic posture not unlike that which nations such as North Korea and Pakistan opted for in the face of conventional overmatch: combining aggressive sub-threshold competition with the use of nuclear weapons as a backstop against escalation to a conventional war that Russia cannot win. Russia might base a future force posture around sub-kiloton nuclear weapons which are less likely to trigger a strategic nuclear exchange if used. In this eventuality, Russia could combine brinkmanship within Europe and destabilisation on NATO’s southern flank to pressure the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reconstitution of NATO’s own forces to meet the requirements of both deterrence and competition within this context will be shaped by relative uncertainty about the contours of Russia’s own trajectory. This paper, supported by the Royal Navy Strategic Studies Centre, seeks to answer a subordinate strategic question – what should the role be of the Alliance’s navies in strategic competition with Russia? The answer to this question will shape the contours of how both the Royal Navy and navies within NATO will evolve in the face of what could well be a long-term Russian threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that, irrespective of its trajectory, Russia is likely to rely on its assets in the maritime domain for two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shaping the strategic balance, defined in Russian thinking as the relative throw-weight in both conventional and nuclear terms that two nations or alliances can deliver against each other’s homelands. In Russian parlance strategic forces are treated as distinct from general purpose (military) forces, though some capabilities, like ballistic missiles, can play both roles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holding adversary maritime platforms capable of carrying long-range strike capabilities at reach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this mirrors Cold War thinking about the maritime domain as being integrally intertwined with the nuclear balance. In the post-Cold War era, however, Russian leaders (including President Putin) have evinced a belief that many tasks which were previously only achievable with nuclear weapons can now be achieved with conventional precision-strike assets. Since long-range theatre-level strike assets (and kinetic defences against them) are easiest to move on large vessels, they remain a largely (though not exclusively) maritime capability in both Russia and the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A considerable body of literature exists to suggest that perceptions of the strategic balance influence coercive dynamics across the spectrum of competition. Moreover, to the extent that many of Russia’s most viable pathways to generating a credible future force structure rest on a favourable strategic balance, a threat to this would at a minimum require adaptation by Russia. Since many of the plausible adaptations for which Russia could opt are inherently capital intensive, this will impose resource trade-offs on Russian planners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of this, the authors contend that one of the primary vectors through which naval forces can deliver competitive overmatch regarding Russia is by fielding long-range land attack capabilities against which Russia will have to field additional defences. If this is combined with multiple launch vectors, the cost and expense of defence will undercut Russia’s potential future force designs and compel it to implement a series of force design choices that are counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, what this paper is proposing is that the navies of NATO play a role in a modern variant of flexible response. Part of the solution to the Alliance’s deterrence requirements will be recapitalising the ground forces that represent a key pillar of deterrence on the Alliance’s eastern flank. The defence plans of nations such as Poland, which include the purchase of both the Korean K239 Chunmoo multiple-launch rocket system and the US-made M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, stand out as a case in point. However, it is worth noting that the success of such plans will be contingent on the maintenance of stores of munitions and spares, as well as the ability of Alliance members to crew equipment. Maintaining the political capital to deliver equipment to forces on a sustained basis is a challenge within democracies, even in the face of acute threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime forces can play three important roles in this context. First, in peacetime, their employment can impose a requirement on Russia to expend resources on capabilities needed to deny the open ocean to NATO navies. This is viewed as a pressing requirement for the VMF and Russian aerospace forces, but one for which they have limited resources. Secondly, the employment of maritime forces can serve as a war termination tool by increasing the risks attendant on a protracted conflict in tandem with ground forces, which deny short-term gains. Finally, because many of the platforms which Russia employs for both strategic and sub-strategic nuclear use are either maritime or, like strategic bombers, can be impacted from the sea with conventional capabilities, a maritime threat to the bulk of Russia’s sub-strategic launch capability could considerably alter perceptions of a favourable strategic balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, this does not represent the full spectrum of functions which maritime power can play – the roles of navies can encompass a range of tasks, such as containing rival navies and providing armies with strategic mobility. This paper is more narrowly focused on those areas where maritime power can be applied asymmetrically as an offset to an opponent’s potential advantages in other areas, and as a tool for generating competitive advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main hypothesis of this paper is that in order to impose an asymmetry of cost on Russia, as well as to reinforce deterrence, Allied maritime power should not be framed in terms of deterrence by denial. Rather, its role should be viewed in terms of the strategic functions of pre-war shaping and war termination in the event that deterrence fails. Central to this will be two things: the ability to strike inland at reach; and the capacity to exacerbate Russia’s challenges with respect to generating ISR, and operating and contesting in the maritime domain beyond its coastal defensive zones. Underpinning the proposed approach to the employment of Allied maritime power is a focus on adversary concerns, rather than an effort to match capabilities. This is drawn from the tradition of competitive strategies innovated by figures such as Andrew Marshall at the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment in the 1970s. This paper discusses how Allied planning for the use of maritime power in the context of European deterrence can be placed within the context of a competitive strategies framework. This is distinct from threat-based planning insofar as it takes as its starting point the assumption that adversary investments can be shaped rather than merely countered. Secondly, given its long-term focus, a perspective based on competitive strategies emphasises exploiting asymmetry, exacerbating bottlenecks in an opponent’s capabilities rather than overmatching specific military threats directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is composed of four chapters, each of which will build towards a broad set of proposed lines of action for NATO navies. Chapter I focuses on Russia’s views of the primary threats that it faces from the maritime domain, and the opportunities that might emerge from a closer integration of these fears into Allied and national planning. Chapter II focuses on naval dynamics on NATO’s northern flank as a case study. Chapters III and IV examine the emerging opportunities for Allied planning in this area and the practical impediments – in both capability and policy terms – to the adoption of a “competitive strategies” approach to the application of Allied maritime power in competition with Russia, as well as the ways in which these might be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors reviewed a combination of sources, including Russian military literature and academic analysis of the maritime balance between NATO and Russia, as part of their research for this paper. In addition, one of the authors has direct experience of operating in two different navies within the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-russian-threats-and-allied-opportunities&quot;&gt;I. Russian Threats and Allied Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia views itself as possessing some opportunities within the maritime domain, Russian strategists tend to frame it as a threat vector. This is relatively understandable given the country’s traditional weaknesses in this domain. Broadly speaking, Russian literature evinces several potential concerns within the maritime domain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of the maritime domain as a launch vector for adversary long-range precision fires against the Russian homeland.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efforts by rivals to challenge Russia’s ability to exploit its resource base within the maritime domain, particularly in the High North and Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Threats to Russia’s second-strike strategic nuclear capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first concern can be nested within a broader set of Russian concerns regarding the risk of a precision-strike campaign against the Russian homeland conducted on multiple axes. The fear that Russia could effectively be paralysed by Western long-range precision strike capabilities emerged partially as the result of a specific reading of the conflicts of the 1990s. A key lesson of the first Gulf War and the Balkan Wars derived by figures such as the then Soviet deputy chief of general staff of the armed forces, General Makhmut Gareev, and the deputy commander of the Soviet Navy, Admiral Ivan Kapitanets, was the notion that precision strike made it possible to paralyse a state’s capacity to mount an effective military response by simultaneously targeting the depth of an opponent’s territory. Though not an exclusively naval function, it has been assumed by several Russian strategists that naval platforms will represent a crucial launch vector for the long-range precision strike threat. This is a reasonable assumption, as the size of missiles such as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) makes launching them from platforms other than naval more complex (though not impossible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain maritime platforms also have a second advantage which is of particular concern to Russian military writers: their capacity to launch strikes at close range, which would leave Russia with limited early warning. This specific threat is of course particular to certain types of launch platforms such as SSN and SSGN submarines, which can, in principle, remain undetected and strike from positions close to Russian shores at short notice. The present Russian concern regarding air and missile threats mirrors those voiced during the Soviet era, when genuine concerns about being subjected to a nuclear first strike were compounded by inter-organisational dynamics. A combination of factors contributed to this, among them the strategic culture, which created pervasive fears of surprise attack, and organisational dynamics within the USSR that saw organisations such as the Soviet Air Defence Forces competing for resources, which they could do more effectively when they could make the case that an external threat justified their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary Russian thinking about an aerospace assault is somewhat broader and assumes simultaneous strikes against C2 nodes, critical infrastructure airfields and nuclear assets. Russian theorists presume that the launch of missiles moving at different speeds, such as UAV decoys and cruise missiles, can be sequenced to provide a coordinated time on top or convergent effect. This is certainly technically achievable – Russia has coordinated the use of Shahed-136 loitering munitions and Kalibr cruise missiles in this way, and Iran combined cruise missiles and UAVs in its 2019 strikes on Abqaiq and Khurais.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, then, priorities such as air defence have featured heavily in recent Russian procurement. For example, under the state armament programme for 2020, the Russian Federation was expected to procure 56 S-400 division sets, which, at a cost of $200 million per battery, would be comparable to a carrier programme. Moreover, Russia has placed an ever-greater emphasis on building and fielding the precision strike capabilities needed to conduct offensive counter-air missions against targets such as airbases. This has been combined with efforts to recapitalise Russia’s capacity for airborne situational awareness in areas such as the High North. In addition to deploying assets such as the MiG-31BM to the region, Russia maintains at least three S-300 and S-400 regiments under its Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command, along with the Murmansk-BN electronic warfare complex and a growing radar network in areas such as Kotelny (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bMq9i3s.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major Russian concern which emerges primarily from the maritime domain is the fear that Russia’s SSBN bastions can be penetrated. This was an especially pressing consideration for the Soviet Union during the late Cold War, and drove considerable investments in securing the USSR’s bastions in the High North. Today, factors such as the melting of polar ice caps that will allow greater access to the area will exacerbate this concern, as the growth in merchant traffic is likely to mask any increased military presence, making it more difficult for Russia to produce its recognised maritime picture and deter would-be ingressors into its historical bastions. This issue has been noted by, among others, Admiral Nikolai Yemenov, commander-in-chief of the VMF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of Russia to maintain situational awareness in the undersea domain represents another bottleneck in capacity and capability. Much of the responsibility for the task of maintaining sub-surface domain awareness falls to the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research (Glavnoye Upravlenie Glubokovodnikh Issledovanii, or GUGI). This organisation has historically depended on a highly specialised cadre of hydronauts for its operations, drawn from the ranks of the VMF via the 29th Separate Submarine brigade. It also relies on several special purpose submarines, such as the deep-diving submarine Losharik, which is launched from the Belgorod, a specially adapted stretched Oscar-class submarine. Under the leadership of Vice-Admiral Aleksei Burilichev, the GUGI took on several additional tasks, including the testing of the Poseidon nuclear torpedo. On the one hand, this represented a budgetary advantage, but it simultaneously represented a cost in terms of both submariners’ time and the use of its platforms. Currently, the organisation likely faces more tasks than its platforms and personnel can manage, with its duties including undersea surveillance, the management of Harmony (Russia’s analogue to the US Integrated Undersea Surveillance System), and more offensive functions such as espionage. This strain on availability of platforms was further compounded by a 2019 fire on the Losharik. Russia’s current emphasis on less survivable but also less costly platforms, such as the intelligence ship Yantar, and the search for autonomous solutions, may reflect these challenges. These approaches could bear fruit, but capabilities such as autonomous underwater vehicles are likely to demand investments in areas such as high-end microelectronics, which Russia can only procure at cost and at some sanctions risk to vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the risk of a distant blockade of the Russian Federation’s maritime lines of communication, which will be exacerbated by the use of “grey” shipping that can be legally interdicted in peacetime for lack of adequate insurance or flag verification, among other things. Russia is in some ways especially vulnerable to blockade. Its trade-to-GDP ratio is currently higher than that of most Western nations, and the majority of this trade is carried by sea. Though land-based infrastructure and transhipment through neutral ports can mitigate this vulnerability to an extent, it can do so only inefficiently and, moreover, at a cost in both money and material. For example, a proposed North–South Corridor moving Russian goods to the Indian Ocean via Iran would both be a high-risk investment (which is why it must be state-backed) and involve goods passing through volatile regions and states such as Azerbaijan, with which both Russia and Iran have a fraught relationship. Some Russian authors have voiced concerns that the Russian state’s increasing reliance on grey shipping will create vulnerabilities to peacetime interdiction. In a conflict scenario, much of Russia’s energy exports, among other things, will depend on sea lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the need to meet requirements such as protecting bastions and sea lines of communication, as well as contributing to objectives such as offensive counter-air missions, the VMF has secured a sizeable proportion of Russia’s defence budget over the last decades: it received a 26% allocation under the last state armament plan, as compared to 14% for ground forces. Despite this fiscal allocation, the ability of Russia’s ageing maritime sector to meet the demands placed on it is in question. The recent budget announcement that more than a third of Russia’s total budget expenditure in 2024 will go to defence will not ease this, as the main emphasis of this increase is focused on the delivery of victory in Ukraine, meaning that predominantly the land environment and the Army will benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-trade-offs-facing-russia&quot;&gt;The Trade-Offs Facing Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some challenges are easier for Russia to mitigate than others. While Russia can achieve sea denial and a degree of sea control in its coastal seas, contesting freedom of action out to 1,000 km and beyond will be difficult and costly for a country that must also rebuild its forces on land. For example, Russia has struggled to build its Pion and Lotos satellite constellations and thus has limited situational awareness at reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue for Russia is twofold. First, as previously noted, platform development in the maritime domain is inherently capital intensive, and this is especially true for those platforms that are needed to contest more distant waters. While it is difficult to ascertain the costs of platforms such as the Ilyushin Il-38 aircraft or the Yasen-class submarine with a high degree of certainty (though public figures do exist for the Yasen), proxy indicators can be utilised. For example, during the Cold War the CIA used a methodology which focused on the relative costs of platforms, rather than on their absolute costs. Essentially, the relative production cost of two different systems was established using Western analogues. Though imperfect, the assumption underpinning this mode of comparison was that while the absolute costs of two different platforms might vary across states, the relative costs were more stable and dependant on physical characteristics such as tonnage and power density (for vessels) or factors such as weight and speed (for aircraft), and because factors such as labour costs that might impact absolute costs would not impact relative costs. Using this rubric, the costs of the platforms needed for Russia to contest areas beyond its immediate close seas are prohibitive. For example, a Yasen-class submarine should cost roughly as much as the armour organic to a force such as the First Guards Tank Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second factor worth considering is how much a given system depends on foreign inputs, including machine tooling and microelectronics. In this case, there is likely to be a direct correlation between the reach of a platform or effector and its dependence on imports. Effectors such as long-range missiles depend on Western inputs to achieve precision at reach. Similarly, the larger the platform, the more it is likely to require in terms of resources such as machine tooling, much of which is imported. Estimating sophistication is a relatively imprecise art, though more is now known about the degree to which certain effectors (in particular missiles) rely on Western capabilities. One proxy, borrowed from civilian economics, is to use the average GDP of countries that produce a given product as a barometer of its sophistication and thus its reliance on high-tech imports if the country producing the product falls below the average. The percentage of industrial capacity in areas where Russia has external dependencies on which a given area of military spending draws is another measure which can be employed. By these metrics, capabilities such as SSNs, strategic bombers, long-range strike capabilities and air defence systems are all likely to be demanding in terms of external inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenance costs are another area of interest. During the Cold War it was presumed (correctly) that the poor quality of Soviet aircraft maintenance meant that the through-life costs of Soviet aircraft would exceed those of their Western counterparts in absolute terms, even if their capital costs did not. This is more likely to be true the more sophisticated the platform, thus impacting naval and air platforms in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we might consider personnel. More sophisticated platforms tend to draw on skilled personnel, both for manufacture and subsequent manning. To the extent that skilled and educated personnel represent a capability bottleneck which will be exacerbated by emigration, platforms drawing on such individuals will compete with other elements of the force that require skilled personnel. This could include, for example, operators for air defences and C2 systems such as Akatsia-M. Of course, defence could outcompete other sectors for remaining skilled personnel, but only at the cost of creating distortions elsewhere. While Russia has embraced the integration of autonomous and uncrewed systems into all aspects of warfare throughout its operations in Ukraine, it retains a lack of trust towards machines and full autonomy. It continues to fund research into AI but, again, it is not a world leader in this field and therefore lags behind the West in these areas which could potentially solve some of the crewing issues faced by militaries around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia has shown a great deal of sensitivity to the maritime domain as a threat vector, and its leadership has displayed a willingness to expend considerable resources on attempting to secure the nation’s maritime flanks. However, this represents an opportunity cost for the rest of the Russian military in several ways. First, maritime platforms are inherently capital intensive and require inputs in precisely those areas where Russia has considerable weaknesses. Moreover, maintaining capabilities such as air defences sufficient to close off Russia’s maritime approaches requires Russia to strip them from other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with this level of expenditure, significant challenges remain for Russia. One Russian analyst has suggested that the Russian armed forces had a third of the resources needed to secure the country’s maritime approaches, while considerable debates have taken place within Russia regarding the need for power projection platforms. Furthermore, gaps remain in Russia’s air and sea denial capabilities in areas such as the High North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-case-study-naval-dynamics-on-natos-northern-flank&quot;&gt;II. Case Study: Naval Dynamics on NATO’s Northern Flank&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian position in the High North is a useful case study. While Russia has invested considerable effort in reinforcing its military position in the region, it nonetheless faces certain critical gaps in capability that could prove to be enduring. If Russia were to invest in resolving these challenges, it would necessarily have to do so at the expense of other parts of its force structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not identical to its Soviet predecessor, the VMF’s conception of its role, including in this region, is similar. A primary wartime function of the Soviet fleet was the defence of SSBNs in their bastions, because the leadership of the USSR perceived the balance of nuclear power at the end of a conflict to be a critical determinant of bargaining power at the point of conflict termination. The assumptions underpinning this concept remain for Russia today. To this end, the Soviets organised their fleet for the defence of three zones: a coastal defence zone within 200 km of Russia’s shores; a near seas zone within 1,000 km; and a far seas zone up to 2,000 km from Russia. At a minimum, Russian forces should be able to dominate the coastal defence zone and achieve sea denial in the near seas and far seas zones. Russian strategists do not, however, perceive their role in purely reactive terms – one way in which Soviet SSNs were to contribute to shaping war termination dynamics was by actively hunting adversary SSBNs. Today, Russia views the balances which will determine the circumstances of war termination as including adversary conventional long-range precision strike capabilities, given the increased lethality of the latter against command nodes, logistical facilities and nuclear assets themselves. As such, at a minimum it will be a standing requirement for Russian naval forces in the High North and Arctic both to prevent platforms capable of holding long-range strike capabilities from entering into the Arctic, including denial of access to the oceans directly abutting it (from where long-range strike capabilities can be launched with limited warning), and to eliminate adversary platforms on the open oceans where possible. The ability of Russia’s forces to achieve this, however, may be constrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first area in which Russia will face considerable capability gaps in the High North is anti-submarine warfare (ASW). Though Russia’s Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command maintains a sizeable force of both conventional and nuclear attack submarines, its capacity for defensive ASW is somewhat more constrained. Russia’s fleet of 44 Ilyushin Il-38N and Tupolev Tu-142 maritime patrol aircraft, though not small by any standard, is split between the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command and the Pacific Fleet. Moreover, it is considerably more limited than the maritime patrol aircraft force that Russian planners intended to have at their disposal – the VMF had aspired to field 30 Il-38Ns by 2020, in addition to its fleet of Tu-142s. Factors such as readiness must be taken into account, and there are certain trends which will compound the problems posed by the lack of airborne surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the Russian surface fleet’s capacity to support ASW is also becoming increasingly constrained. The Udaloy II-class destroyer – the backbone of the Soviet Navy’s and then the VMF’s surface ASW capabilities – is likely reaching the point of obsolescence. While new surface platforms such as the Admiral Gorshkov-class frigate can provide a newer and more capable replacement, Russia’s production of the Gorshkov class has faced considerable delays, driven by both the limitations of Russia’s indigenous shipbuilding base and its loss of access to gas turbine engines (which it procured from Ukraine) after 2014. Compounding this are considerable overruns in the repair and refit of existing vessels such as the Kirov-class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov. Russia can continue to build vessels such as the Gorshkov-class frigates, but it will face capacity constraints. To cite one example, the Russian effort to develop combined diesel and gas engines to replace Ukrainian imports has delivered eventual success, but Russia is restricted to the production of two such engines a year, and even this rate of production may prove difficult to sustain. A major bottleneck will be capacity at Russian shipyards, which are currently running at capacity. Compounding this is the need for import substitution: the Kolomna D49 diesel engine which forms part of the M55R power unit includes several imported components that will be increasingly difficult for Russia to procure in the face of export controls. Given that the engines on naval vessels are subject to a wear rate when they are at sea, spare part restrictions can also impact the operational tempo of existing vessels. Sanctions evasion is of course possible, but this imposes additional fiscal costs on already expensive programmes. Finally, wider challenges faced by Russian civilian shipbuilding mean that civilian and military projects may, to an extent, compete for the same resources, particularly with respect to personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the airbases upon which Russian assets rely – assets such as the Tu-22M3 bomber and the Il-38N, which are crucial to denying access to surface vessels and submarines respectively – are vulnerable to air attack, as was recently demonstrated in the Ukrainian attacks on the Engels airbase. The size of the fixed-wing aircraft being deployed from these bases makes the use of hardened air shelters or dispersion impractical. While some security can be provided using airbases deeper within Russia, this comes at a cost in terms of presence and endurance (and many of these airbases can be threatened from other vectors). Russia can mitigate these challenges, but only through the employment of a robust regional air defence network. It currently maintains such a network in the form of three S-300 and S-400 regiments under OSK Sever. In addition to this, the Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command maintains an electronic warfare centre at Severomorsk, which controls electronic warfare complexes such as the Murmansk-BN and the Krasukha-4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways in which this picture can become considerably more complex for Russia. First, the changing climate in the High North might considerably expand the areas which the VMF must survey and thus deny to adversary assets. In particular, changes that make seasonal circumpolar navigation easier for subsurface assets will complicate the task of ASW in the High North and Arctic. Similar changes will also make ingress by submarines into the Arctic from the east possible to a degree that was not previously viable, both by Russian adversaries (NATO) and, potentially in the future, by China, which will complicate the water space further for Russia. Moreover, detecting submarines in the region will be complicated by factors such as the increase in temperature of the Arctic Ocean and changes in salinity that will affect sound channels, greater ambient oceanic noise due to increases in oceanic wildlife, open-ocean storms (where there used to be ice), and increases in the movement of sea ice as the ice cap breaks up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second risk to Russia’s conceived approach to oceanic defence is posed by the increasing range of strike assets. For example, the common hypersonic glide body intended for use by the US Army and Navy has a 4,000 km range, which would allow it to have an effect over much of western Russia from the Norwegian Sea. Moreover, strike platforms such as hypersonics and land attack cruise missiles, which exist at the high end of the cost continuum, are joined by considerably cheaper long-range strike assets. As an example, consider one-way attack UAVs, such as the Iranian-made Shahed-136, which have a theoretical range of 2,000 km. While limited in terms of sensors and payload, such munitions can be of use against soft targets such as administrative buildings, or targets which are inherently incendiary such as fuel or munitions stocks. At least one recent Russian study has noted that the munitions expenditure involved in engaging UAVs as well as the detection challenges they pose represent serious air defence challenges. The challenge of range for the VMF is that it forces the VMF to sortie out to engage platforms which can pose a threat from well beyond Russia’s bastions, and thus places a higher premium on Tier 1 platforms that can operate on open oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third risk facing Russia is that of the changing strategic geography of the northern flank spurred by NATO’s enlargement. First, this will spur a convergence between regions such as the Baltic and the High North. This challenge is inextricable from that of range. A sufficiently long-ranged strike munition such as the TLAM could impact many of the same regions from either the Norwegian Sea or the Baltic Sea, but the proximity to Russia of the latter region relative to the former means that strikes from within the Baltic Sea could occur with limited warning times, while missiles fired from further afield could arrive as a follow-on capability. This creates multiple avenues for convergent strikes from multiple vectors. Though Russia can more easily deny parts of the Baltic Sea with ground-based missiles in Kaliningrad, this is less true of the littorals of nations such as Sweden. Much of Russia’s capacity for denial depends on closing the straits of Denmark, which will prove difficult if NATO vessels are posturing in a crisis short of war, especially when a number of NATO members are on the other side of the straits. Secondly, the proximity of NATO’s northern flank to Russian strategic bastions means that strike capabilities which might have been classed as tactical can have a strategic effect. An ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) missile in Finland, for example, has strategic ramifications, as does an aircraft which might have been viewed as a tactical capability. If contending purely with ground-based assets, this might actually incentivise Russia to pre-empt before platforms can be dispersed. A maritime dimension to deterrence can remove this incentive by introducing strike assets which cannot be as easily pre-empted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the risk that the Alliance can enforce a distant blockade on the Russian Federation, which must still move energy from areas such as the Arctic through chokepoints in both the east (in the form of the Bering Strait) and the west (through the GIUK Gap). Overland alternatives do exist, but their capacity is likely to be considerably constrained. Moreover, most overland methods of circumventing a blockade, such as pipelines or routes to alternative terminals, are resource-intensive endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Russia can mitigate each of these challenges. It is not yet clear that NATO has the capacity to present the Russian leadership with the challenges that its maritime doctrine is partially based around mitigating. However, it is the authors’ contention that the Alliance has avenues through which to adapt its maritime posture in a 10-year timeframe in order to present Russia with an asymmetrical offset to the advantages that it may enjoy on land in terms of both mass and proximity to likely theatres. Moreover, the development of these avenues can force Russia into disproportionately costly mitigations, which will impose opportunity costs elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-emerging-opportunities-for-allied-planning&quot;&gt;III. Emerging Opportunities for Allied Planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge that Russia faces in the maritime domain can be summarised as follows. In order to be strategically secure enough to pursue a full spectrum of competitive actions including escalation to local and regional conflict, Russia must deny the maritime domain out to 1,000 km. All of the platforms and enablers that might allow Russia to achieve this are, by their nature, inherently complex. The surveillance and reconnaissance needed to cue conventional missiles at reach have thus far not been developed by Russia, while aerial and maritime platforms operating at long distances do so at considerable risk. As such, to the extent that the Alliance can expand the area over which Russia must achieve sea denial in order to protect itself against long-range strikes, it can shape the contours of Russian force regeneration. It can achieve this primarily in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By expanding its long-range land attack capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By operating on new vectors that Russia has not historically had to defend.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the assets of Alliance members can be postured in ways that incentivise Russian responses at reach. For example, exercises at or just beyond the Russian near seas zone focused specifically on strike, comparable to exercises such as Formidable Shield (which focuses on Integrated Air and Missile Defence), would in all likelihood compel responses. We might, for example, consider the relationship between NATO’s Trident Juncture and the scale of Russia’s Ocean Shield exercises, which consistently track one another. This is an asymmetrical challenge for Russia, which is operating fewer and older hulls, but it would also compel Russian leaders to plan in terms of their existing fears regarding strikes from the northern vector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Russia views this challenge in multi-theatre terms, sequencing exercises by NATO and those conducted by member states such as the US in the Indo-Pacific could act as a forcing function to compel even larger-scale responses by Russia. This was the case during the Cold War, when the Soviet Navy felt compelled to stage multi-theatre exercises, such as Okean, to demonstrate its ability to operate across theatres. The cost of such activity in both human terms and platform wear can have an indirect effect on Russia’s ability to project power elsewhere, especially in a context where recent state armament plans have prioritised surface vessels with limited endurance, and given the age and reliability issues facing many larger platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other ways for the Alliance to increase the strain on Russian forces that are constrained by both vessel age and human capital. For example, forward activity by Allied SSNs, particularly on transpolar routes, would create an imperative to maintain more persistent surveillance over a considerably wider area. Russian efforts to maintain situational awareness in these areas would be non-discretionary, both because of the importance of these zones for patrolling SSBNs and because Russia’s air defences over the central Arctic are relatively sparse, underscoring the risk of key air defence radar being suppressed by submarine-launched cruise missiles to open the way for other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, sea control at key chokepoints could be underscored through exercises which emphasise interdiction for other reasons. For example, exercises framed in terms of the need to interdict threats to critical infrastructure or to counter illicit activity would, if conducted at or near strategic chokepoints, have an implicit effect in terms of messaging. Unlike larger-scale exercises, which often take years to plan, such activity could be conducted on a more routine basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-practical-impediments-to-a-competitive-strategies-approach-and-ways-to-overcome-them&quot;&gt;IV. Practical Impediments to a “Competitive Strategies” Approach and Ways to Overcome Them&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several challenges inherent in an approach that is designed to compete in the way described above. Among them are potential risks to strategic stability and the positions of different NATO Alliance members with regard to a forward-leaning maritime posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first risk, that strategic stability could be upended if Russia perceives a risk to its own critical capabilities, is one that political leaders across the Alliance would understandably wish to avoid. There are several ways in which this risk might manifest itself. First, a Russia that perceived risks to its C2 (including its nuclear C2), second strike or other critical capabilities might well have incentives to escalate early in a crisis. Secondly, the nature of certain elements of a competitive strategy, such as the forward posturing of subsurface assets, could lead to challenges such as the loss of communications and thus control; this issue arose during the Cold War when American SSNs such as the Gato conducted operations near the Soviet coastline, an activity that carried inherent escalatory risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first challenge, while real, can also be stabilising in certain respects. If, as a precondition for military action, Russia had to posture forces in a way that insured it against a crippling first strike, this would, in principle, limit its avenues for limited military action. Any escalation would need to be accompanied by a set of actions which in turn would make it difficult for the Russian leadership to communicate limited intent, and would thus only be justifiable in extremis. Moreover, it should be noted that the very proximity of NATO’s borders to Russia and the possibility of long-range strike being surged in a crisis creates a pre-emptive logic for Russia irrespective of maritime strategy. Indeed, the relative viability of suppressing targets such as aircraft on the ground, given the concentration of Allied aircraft in generally unhardened airbases, would incentivise this. The relative difficulty of pre-emptively suppressing maritime platforms with conventional capabilities except when in port would remove some incentives for conventional pre-emption which might exist against ground-based platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is worth noting that the authors are not suggesting that in an escalating crisis, Western states should opt to engage in strikes against the Russian homeland on the scale that Russia fears. Rather, the proposition is that uncertainty regarding whether this might occur, if engendered in peacetime, can have a positive competitive effect. Perhaps most importantly, however, it is already the case that Russia appears intent on developing a range of capabilities, such as the Poseidon nuclear torpedo and the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, which are built to insure it against a crippling first strike. If this is indeed the case, then it is not obvious that instability is avoidable. Rather, what appears more likely to be shaped by Western policy is the degree to which Russia invests in such capabilities, rather than taking other avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge – namely, Alliance cohesion – is considerable, especially in areas such as the High North, where some members of the Alliance are likely to be heavily invested in regional stability for entirely understandable reasons. It should be noted that this would not necessarily be the first instance in which debates over Allied posture have proved divisive; NATO’s shift to a flexible response posture and the later adoption of the Follow-on Forces Attack doctrine were also accompanied by controversy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several avenues which might be pursued as mitigations. First, in the vein of NATO’s Harmel formula, deterrence can be combined with engagement, whereby reciprocal de-escalatory actions by Russia can be matched in kind. For example, the tempo of Allied SSN activity in the High North might be linked to Russian activity near Allied undersea cables. Linking activity with engagement can allay some Allied fears. Secondly, some of the capabilities described would impact the High North even if not postured in the region on a long-term basis. Maritime platforms hosting strike assets such as hypersonics, for example, can pose a theoretical threat from well beyond areas such as the Norwegian Sea. As such, they need not be persistently forward postured, and their intermittent presence need be viewed no differently from the occasional deployments of strategic bombers to the region. Since the mobility of air and maritime assets allows for relatively rapid posturing, the Russian leadership is likely to view the balance of precision strike capabilities as being determined by the number of missiles each side possesses, rather than those regionally postured. Thus, forward deployment in ways that pose a challenge to Alliance cohesion may in many instances be unnecessary. This would not be equally true of other activities, such as subsurface activity along the Northern Sea Route; however, such activity is likely to involve a limited subset of Allied navies in any instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subset of challenges relates to military capacity. In many of the areas described, including long-range strike capabilities and subsurface assets, members of the Alliance will face their own considerable shortfalls in capacity. To use an example, the UK currently has a single launch vector for deep strikes inland from the maritime domain – namely the TLAM launched from the Astute-class submarine. This challenge will likely be compounded by the eventuality that a large proportion of the capabilities fielded by the US will be reallocated to the Indo-Pacific theatre to contend with an increasingly capable People’s Liberation Army Navy. The Alliance will also face shortfalls in other areas, such as submarines capable of operating under ice, and limitations to the human capital available across Allied navies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, however, that considering the present operating circumstances which Russia faces, it is likely that capabilities needed to compete effectively with the Russian Federation in the medium term will be needed in a 10-year timeframe and beyond. As such, Allied maritime capabilities can be viewed in the same vein as virtually any other category of capability, such as munitions – while present shortfalls in production capacity are real, there is a window in which they might be rectified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relatively quick way in which members of the Alliance could increase Russian uncertainty regarding the scale of the precision-strike threat is by experimenting with the use of air defence interceptors in a dual-capable role. This has already been the case with the SM-2 and SM-6 missiles, and while there are many technical reasons why interceptors may not be the best means of striking targets at reach, the fact that Russian planners already presume that they will play this role means that they will have to be factored into planning regarding the strike threat to soft-skinned targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The containerisation of subsonic munitions both by Russia and more recently by the US Marine Corps suggests that at least some strike assets could be emplaced on non-dedicated platforms in a crisis, or deployed ashore in an escalating crisis. This would also be the case for attritable one-way attack UAVs, which can be containerised in larger numbers. Though unlikely to pose a threat to hardened targets, such capabilities are regarded by Russia as posing a credible threat to targets such as airfields, on which strategic capabilities such as ASW aircraft and bombers are based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch platforms for bespoke capabilities such as hypersonics are likely to pose more of a challenge, given the lengths of the strike cells needed. Presently, only the US Navy’s payload-module-equipped Virginia-class submarines could plausibly carry long-range hypersonic missiles, and any competitive approach in Europe will depend on the presence of at least some of these assets within European waters. This being said, there are relatively few targets that are either so heavily hardened or so fleeting that they demand the use of a hypersonic missile. In a 10-year timeframe, this could change, as European navies such as the Royal Navy seek to integrate hypersonics on future platforms such as the SSN(R). The fact that ground-based versions of naval hypersonics which fit within 40-foot container-sized launchers are also being developed holds out the option of deploying missiles ashore from amphibious shipping, rather than firing them from vessels. If concerns regarding emissions and heat can be mitigated, container-based hypersonics can also be integrated on non-bespoke platforms. As an example, we might consider how the Israeli Lora SRBM has been containerised and operated from a non-dedicated vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Russian defence planning is programmed on a 10-year basis, the choices that the Russian state makes for investments out to a 10-year time horizon are dependent on the force structures that it may expect to face. With respect to the missiles themselves, the primary barrier will be R&amp;amp;D costs, and there is some reason to believe that a model comparable to the F-35 – with manufacturing distributed, but intellectual property held by states that have moved ahead of the pack – should be the basis for work on hypersonics envisioned via the AUKUS (Australia, UK and US) defence partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward SSN operations could prove much more challenging, given that most SSN fleets are unlikely to grow in the next decade, and the demand on the US Navy in the Indo-Pacific is likely to increase. Past the next decade, this challenge may be alleviated somewhat, but this is uncertain. Uncrewed solutions may offer an offset to limited hulls, and uncrewed capabilities have the potential to be used in similar roles, but with a different concept of employment to the standard SSNs of today. First, autonomous vessels can be used for forward surveillance, and have already been used in this capacity by states such as China. While this poses a risk of platforms being captured, it also allows for intelligence gathering without the escalatory risks that the use of crewed assets near hostile shores posed during the Cold War. Moreover, the task of tracking subsurface contacts, whether crewed or not, would be one that imposes burdens on Russian ASW assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, uncrewed capabilities can be used for tasks such as forward minelaying, and as active sonar emitters in forward positions, which can enable passive detection by more valuable crewed platforms. This is important since one of the reasons that SSNs need other platforms to perform wide area searches is that they cannot afford to emit themselves. Rather than operating in an anti-SSBN role, NATO’s SSNs could act as a forward perimeter. This could impose dilemmas on Russia when viewed in conjunction with the imperative that long-range strike creates for Russian SSNs to sortie beyond their bastions: if strike creates imperatives for SSNs and SSGNs to be utilised in risk-acceptant ways, mines and uncrewed capabilities teamed with smaller numbers of crewed platforms will be able to ambush them in forward positions. The resultant dilemma is one that Russian planners will not easily contend with in a crisis. On the other hand, the complexities of communicating underwater make the direct control of uncrewed underwater vehicles as armed complements to crewed submarines difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, however, the question in each instance will be whether the capabilities developed can impose more costs than those required to develop them in the first place. In this, the Alliance will have the advantage of knowing that Russia will have to develop mitigations premised on a worst-case scenario. As illustrated by Russian literature that consistently overemphasises the scale at which the Alliance can generate long-range strikes, and by both Russian and Soviet responses to prior changes in Alliance posture, it is conceivable that even marginal investments in the areas described will impose disproportionately costly adaptations on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s reactive application of maritime power does not currently translate into strategic effects, but with three subtle changes it could. Firstly, it could do so through the creation of an environment that forces Russia to expend resources on capabilities needed to deny the open ocean to NATO navies; secondly, the employment of maritime forces can serve as a war termination tool by increasing the costs of a protracted conflict in tandem with ground forces, which deny short-term gains; and finally, because many of the platforms which Russia uses for sub-strategic nuclear use are either maritime or, like strategic bombers, can be impacted from the sea with conventional capabilities, a maritime threat to the bulk of Russia’s sub-strategic launch capability can considerably alter perceptions of a favourable strategic balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime power has historically been an asymmetrical advantage for the Alliance vis-à-vis Russia, and it can continue to play this role. Russia’s concepts for defending its maritime periphery commit it to a posture which can only be sustained by platforms that are capital intensive – precisely the type of capability that Russia is least well-situated to generate. By investing in capabilities in areas such as long-range strike, the Alliance can exacerbate the challenges which Russia faces. This, in turn, means that the way Allied maritime power is conceived should be a function of what can be delivered ashore from the sea (which is what Russian leaders primarily worry about), rather than seizing sea control per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has several concerns about the use of maritime that could be exploited by NATO. Firstly, there is the threat to Russia’s second-strike capability. Russia views the use of the maritime domain as a launch vector for adversary long-range precision fires into the heart of the Russian homeland, including critical national infrastructure, airbases and strategic strike capabilities. It has therefore sought to improve surface-to-air missile coverage and situational awareness through increased radar sites across the High North in an effort to detect and deter potential aggression from this vector. Secondly, Russia’s traditional concerns regarding the safety of its second strike may be exacerbated by the impact of climate change. Thirdly, Russia fears the risk of a distant blockade of the Russian Federation’s maritime lines of communication, not only in the Baring Strait/GIUK Gap but also in the Baltic, the Black Sea and into the Pacific. Overland import/export routes are costly and rely on good relationships with neighbouring nations, something that cannot be guaranteed, and therefore lacks potential investors. This is further exacerbated by the use of grey shipping, which has ways of being legally interdicted in peacetime. Without steady access to engines and spares, Russia’s ability to maintain its fleets and maritime squadrons will be significantly called into question, leaving the maritime areas open to further exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These concerns can be exploited by NATO to create strategic advantages. The Alliance can use a threat to shift the strategic balance in its favour in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By shaping Russian leaders’ pre-conflict assessments of their ability (or lack thereof) to control a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By shifting the allocation of scarce resources towards costly mitigations such as air defences and platforms capable of contesting distant seas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By setting the conditions for war termination if deterrence fails and initial denial is achieved on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fear of Allied maritime power has historically provoked counter-reactions by Russia. As a lack of response would imply a weakening in Russia’s stance internally, a response to any NATO action is typically thought necessary. These counter-reactions are financially costly and increase the strain on Russian forces, which are constrained by both vessel age and human capital. The cost of such activity in both human terms and platform wear can have an indirect effect on Russia’s ability to project power elsewhere. The forward posturing of Allied subsurface assets and circumpolar transits represent two avenues through which this kind of outcome might be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO should, however, recognise its own shortfalls, including the subset of challenges related to military capacity. In many of the areas described, including long-range strike capabilities and subsurface assets, members of the Alliance will face their own considerable shortfalls in capacity. There are certain ways in which the Alliance can rationalise its approach to producing precision strike capabilities. The first might be an emphasis on commonality of capabilities – something already visible in initiatives to increase the Alliance’s capacity in areas such as air defence. Allied efforts to co-produce existing effectors rather than develop multiple independent types could yield considerable efficiencies; the emphasis of AUKUS Pillar 2 on fielding hypersonics could serve as the first step for a wider Allied effort in this regard. The Alliance will also face shortfalls in other areas that will necessitate the preparation of their navies to operate on a warfighting basis against a well-defined threat. Capabilities needed to compete effectively with the Russian Federation in the medium term will need to be fielded in a 10-year timeframe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second likely concern – a lack of platforms to hold strike assets – could be mitigated in several ways, including through the containerisation of subsonic munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, different approaches to ASW could expand the threat envelope for opponents. Though hardly a panacea, uncrewed solutions such as uncrewed underwater vehicles can be used for tasks such as emplacing mines in forward positions within bastions, as well as for forward surveillance. A combination of the machine learning tools that make low-frequency active sonar (previously too riddled with false positives to be used as a tactical asset) a viable means of detection at reach could allow a combination of distant platforms used for detection to cue in more attritable ones in their final approach, without the requirement to risk SSNs forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each instance, the key consideration will be whether capabilities developed can impose more costs than those required to develop them in the first place, which should be the key determinant of Allied policy in the maritime domain.&lt;/p&gt;
