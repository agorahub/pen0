&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian gas flowed into Moldova via Ukraine from the fall of the Soviet Union (formally 1991) until the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Historically, this arrangement gave Russia an annual opportunity to seek Moldovan concessions or have the country suffer the consequences in both gas prices and the volume of gas supplied. This ongoing struggle provides a window into Moldova’s complex and layered relationship with Russia and with the Moldovan breakaway region of Transnistria, as well as Moldova’s internal challenges with institutional effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examining Moldova’s energy sector also reveals the country’s significant growth and reform over the past several years. As of 2023, Chisinau (the capital of Moldova) no longer purchases gas from Russia’s Gazprom. However, this does not mean that Chisinau has freed itself from Russia’s malign hand on the thermostat. Russian gas still flows into Transnistria and the majority of Moldova’s electricity is still supplied via the electrical plant in Transnistria, which is run on Russian gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully understand the current energy situation in Moldova, it is essential to explore the history of the country’s post–Soviet Union energy supply system. Moreover, in order to explore the long history of discounted gas from Russia, as well as Transnistria’s current supplying of most Moldovan electricity, one must inevitably look at Tiraspol, the capital city of Transnistria. But more than a look backward is needed to understand the future of gas, electric, and alternative energy sectors; accordingly, this piece goes beyond that, offering an overview of the current international aid efforts underway, as well as how EU accession is likely to affect this industry. Most importantly, this piece includes potential and crucial solutions to continue progressing toward Moldova’s energy independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-on-post-soviet-moldovan-energy&quot;&gt;Background on Post-Soviet Moldovan Energy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Moldova’s independence in 1992 and until 2022, the majority of Moldovan gas has come from Russia. As of 2018, Chisinau was only meeting 20 percent of its energy demand domestically, instead relying almost entirely on imports. Until 2014, most of this imported energy consisted of natural gas coming from Russia via Ukraine. The Moldovan populace felt the Russian hand reach in and turn down their thermostats in the winters of 2006 and 2009, when the energy giant Gazprom shut off gas to Moldova. While such measures are not unheard of in Moldova, the country has largely been shielded from Russian shut-off threats at least partially because the Balkan gas supply ran through Moldova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has long used energy as a coercive tool, especially against post-Soviet states, in particular targeting Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, and Moldova. While Russian efforts to leverage energy flows as a coercive tool across the post-Soviet world often yield acquiescence in the short term, in the longer term such effort pushes clients to diversify their supply, as has been the case in both Ukraine and Lithuania. Moldova’s tempestuous history with Russia — as played out in the latter’s unreliable supply and pricing of energy, among other avenues — eventually pushed Moldova to diversify its energy supply in earnest in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, Moldova’s long-standing efforts to develop and reform its energy sector have produced minimal results. In 1997, the Moldovan government established the National Agency for Energy Regulation (ANRE), a body tasked with, among other duties, regulating and monitoring the energy sector. But like much of the Moldovan bureaucracy, the agency was not provided with sufficient independent authority to effect this oversight. Without such power, the energy industry has remained a political and profitable tool for internal and external forces. ANRE has also been accused of placing unnecessary challenges on private sector engagement in the marketplace, including delays in permitting, licensing, and anticompetitive tariff setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Until recently, Moldova’s long-standing efforts to develop and reform its energy sector have produced minimal results.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moldova’s efforts toward energy diversification, if not full energy independence, have gone the way of so many Moldovan reform efforts — progressing in fits and starts and plagued by corruption and bureaucratic missteps. In August 2014, the Iasi-Ungheni gas interconnector between Romania and Moldova was commissioned, becoming notionally operational in 2015. However, the entire pipeline was not finished, including connecting Ungheni to Chisinau, until 2021. Moreover, gas did not even begin to flow through this pipeline until 2022. There was a 2017 attempt to move Moldova’s electrical supply to a Ukrainian firm, but that ultimately failed, with some alleging corruption as the culprit. Even in the fraud cases investigated by ANRE, prosecutions and fund recovery have been slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the largest corrupt bureaucratic maneuvers occurred between 1995 and 1998, when the gas networks in Moldova were privatized. Throughout the privatization process a number of dubious, and likely corrupt, schemes were evident, including the undervaluation of assets and the overvaluation of Moldovan government debt. These debt and asset valuations led to the Russian state-owned Gazprom obtaining a 50 percent ownership stake in Moldovagaz as repayment for the debts. The remaining ownership of Moldovagaz rests with the Moldovan government in Chisinau (35 percent) and the government in Tiraspol, the capital of the Moldovan breakaway region of Transnistria (15 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian Gazprom was created in 1989 when the Soviet Gas Ministry was privatized. In 2005, the Russian state became the majority owner of Gazprom. Until 2022, the company was one of the top producers and exporters of natural gas in the world. (Since the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Gazprom’s revenue has decreased sharply; it reported its first net loss in 20 years.) By law the sole exporter of Russian gas, Gazprom has leveraged this supply to obtain diplomatic concessions from not only post-Soviet states but western Europe as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gazprom’s ownership stake in Moldovagaz provides another avenue for the Russian government to manipulate the Moldovan energy sector, which it has already done. For example, in 2021, it was only after a contentious negotiation period that the contract between Moldovagaz and Gazprom was renewed for five years. Two days before the deal was set to be signed, Gazprom tripled the pricing model for Chisinau, leading to a hold in negotiations during which the Moldovan government proved successful in diversifying its energy sources, if only for a short period. The European Union played a role in this process, not only through financial assistance to aid Moldova in keeping the lights on, but also by publicly calling out Russia’s use of energy as a geopolitical tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 negotiations centered around three main challenges that have long plagued Moldova’s energy industry. The first involves the debt that Chisinau supposedly owes and the repayment schedule, both of which are contested. The second is the pricing model and its flexibility, as well as Russia’s commitment to supply. The third challenge involves the restructuring of the energy sector, including the unbundling that Moldova has committed to as a part of the European Union’s Third Energy Package. While progress has been made on each of these challenges since 2021, none are yet resolved. All three of these challenges are discussed in greater depth later in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2021 deal and the overall lack of progress in the energy sector since independence left Moldova still largely dependent on Russia for energy when Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022. Russia’s invasion and continued attacks on infrastructure meant that Ukraine was no longer able to supply Moldova with electricity, a gap which Romania stepped in to fill. Most likely in response, Russia announced it was reducing gas supplies to Moldova — including to Transnistria — by 30 percent. Tiraspol then announced cuts of over 50 percent in the amount of electricity it could supply to Chisinau. Combined, this left Moldova with the worst energy crisis since its independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis led to the government in Chisinau asking citizens to reduce their energy usage; protests against the pro-western government followed. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the United States, and the European Union provided aid in the form of grants, loans, and funds aimed at subsidizing bills for the poorest Moldovans. While efforts to diversify energy suppliers had been made prior to 2022, the crisis pushed them into high gear. By 2023, none of the gas supply flowing to Moldova (aside from Transnistria) was imported from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite this apparent independence from Russian gas (and therefore influence), since Moldovagaz controls gas flow, and Gazprom owns 50 percent of Moldovagaz, the Russian government is still involved in and profiting from Moldova’s gas sector. Furthermore, while none of the right bank of Moldova’s gas is imported from Russia, the entirety of Transnistria’s gas is still being provided by Russia, and it has been provided free of charge for the last fifteen years. The cost of this “free” gas — worth approximately $9 billion — is billed by Gazprom to Moldovagaz. In 2023, an independent review found that Moldova’s current debts were significantly lower than Russia had alleged. And so, disagreements over debts that Moldova, or more specifically Moldovagaz, owes to Russia for gas continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the debts owed and who might owe or pay them eventually, the Transnistrian economy has long been reliant on discounted (“free”) gas from Russia, including to run one of the largest electrical plants in the region, the Cuciurgan Power Station (MGRES), which itself is owned by a Russian company. This plant currently provides approximately 80 percent of Moldova’s electricity, revealing yet another way in which Moldova remains under Russia’s thumb for its energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Russian gas flows to Transnistria via Ukraine, but Ukraine has indicated that it will not extend that contract with Russia when it expires in December 2024. The Moldovan government has indicated that there are alternative ways for Russian gas to flow to Transnistria following the ending of the Russian-Ukrainian contract. But questions remain: Will Russia continue to provide this free gas? Who will pay transit fees? And, will this affect the price of electricity provided to Chisinau?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moldova’s pathway to energy independence has continued to develop in leaps and bounds. In 2024, Moldova joined with other European partners in supporting the security of the energy supply for Ukraine, including efforts to integrate Romanian, Moldovan, and Ukrainian electrical systems. These efforts, among others, not only support Ukraine’s energy supply, but also further diversify Moldova’s energy flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, the United States committed additional resources to Moldova to support energy development, among other cross-sector collaborations including but not limited to cyber security. This follows significant U.S. government investments in Moldova’s energy sector. Furthermore, the continuing support from the European Union, the World Bank, and other foreign partners is essential for Moldova’s energy future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this progress toward energy diversification, the higher energy prices have negatively impacted the Moldovan economy. This means that energy remains not only a physical resourcing issue but also a political one, as pro-Russian candidates can (and do) use the promise of a return to lower prices as a part of their platforms. While Moldova is solidly on the path to energy diversification, its road to long-term energy independence and having an efficient energy sector free from corruption and Russian influence is going to take time, support, and smart, collaborative policy solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-transnistrian-equation&quot;&gt;The Transnistrian Equation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transnistria, a territory wedged between Moldova and Ukraine, has existed as a breakaway region with Russian troops stationed there since 1992. The Russian “peacekeepers” arrived at the end of kinetic conflict and are tasked with patrolling the territory as a part of the agreement that ended the fighting. While Moldova agreed to the “peacekeepers,” it never agreed to the additional Russian forces tasked with protecting a large Soviet-era weapons depot. The presence of these troops and the weapons depot serve as reminders of Moscow’s power to exert influence on Chisinau one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine — in fact, since 2005 — both governments (Chisinau and Tiraspol) engaged in negotiations via the 5+2 format. This group originally included Moldova, Transnistria, Russia, Ukraine, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the European Union, and the United States; since the 2022 Russian invasion, Ukraine has refused to continue negotiations in this format, but Russia and Transnistria have asked for their continuation. While a reinstatement of the 5+2 format is unlikely, Chisinau has expressed a commitment to working closely with Tiraspol, as it is in the former’s interest for the situation in Transnistria to remain stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has attempted to exert influence over Moldova through manipulating energy prices and flows or by threatening to do so. An argument frequently raised in these aggressive negotiations is Moldova’s gas debt. This debt — the total of which is still being contested — includes the amount that Moldova owes Russia both for the “free” gas being provided to Transnistria and the gas provided to the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia has attempted to exert influence over Moldova through manipulating energy prices and flows or by threatening to do so.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a part of the 2021 Gazprom, Moldovagaz, and Moldovan government negotiations, an independent review of the debts was conducted. The review found that the Moldovan government owes Russia approximately $8 million, not the more than $700 million that Russia claims. The difference is partially due to noncompliant expenses including salaries, office renovations, and interest accumulation on the debts owed. Furthermore, this review found that the distribution of gas transit costs over the last twenty years had been overpaid by Chisinau and underpaid by Tiraspol to the tune of $250 million. Some portion of discrepancy may be due to Gazprom not providing financial documentation in support of this review. Of note, this review was only conducted in relation to the debts for Moldovan territory and did not include those relating to Transnistria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The import contract between Gazprom and Moldovagaz stipulates that gas is to be provided to Transnistria, with Moldovagaz holding the debts. In a further complication of the structure between these entities, Transnistria’s gas is provided via a Moldovagaz subsidiary named Tiraspoltransgaz. This company owns the gas-related infrastructure in Transnistria. Historic ANRE inspections and their subsequent reports have noted irregularities in the accounting for Tiraspoltransgaz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gas that Moldovagaz provides to the Transnistrian-based subsidiary is then sold via an agreement with the government in Tiraspol and subsequently sold at below-market rates to Transnistrian businesses. The revenue thus generated is put into an account and recorded as loans from Tiraspoltransgaz to support the region’s budget. This revenue makes up approximately 50 percent of the region’s budget, but more importantly, the value of the gas consumed free of charge was approximately 50 percent of the entire region’s GDP over a ten-year period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the entire Transnistrian economy, and government service provisioning, is based on a model of receiving free Russian gas. If Transnistria were to no longer receive free or significantly subsidized Russian gas, there would likely be massive and swift bankruptcies of Transnistrian businesses. This is not in the interest of the Transnistrian oligarchs, who hold significant political power in the region. Perhaps surprisingly given Moscow’s significant influence and presence, the Transnistrian government has remained neutral regarding the war in Ukraine. This neutrality is demonstrative of just how much sway the oligarchs in Transnistria have over Tiraspol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the December 2024 expiration of the Russian-Ukrainian gas contract, the Moldovan government is confident that alternatives exist to continue the flows of Russian gas to Transnistria. The cheapest option would be to continue using Ukrainian pipelines via a third party, but, given Ukrainian laws on signing contracts with Russian entities, any such third party would need to own the gas itself, not just be providing it on behalf of Gazprom. An alternative is to utilize the Turkstream and Trans-Balkan pipelines, but this would be significantly more expensive, and the pipelines still pass through Ukrainian territory. Both of these alternatives are only possible if the infrastructure in Ukrainian territory remains undamaged from a Russian attack and if the pipelines in question have the capacity to carry the additional flow. It remains to be seen if Russia will take these alternatives or request for Transnistria to pay transit fees or other costs associated with the gas delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of note in this discussion is the fact that Moldova’s largest power plant, the Cuciurgan Power Station (MGRES), sits within Transnistria. Moldova has historically been reliant on this plant’s production and the pricing models provided to Chisinau, which are predicated on the free gas the plant receives. Moreover, historically all Moldovan gas and electrical lines ran through Transnistria; prior to independence, Moldova was essentially reliant on its east for energy. However, even if Moldova could supply all the electricity needed for all its citizens through lines from the west to Chisinau, in all likelihood, not purchasing Transnistrian electricity would lead to a collapse of the Transnistrian economy, government, or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If subsidized gas ceases to flow, unemployed Transnistrian citizens will likely seek support from Chisinau, creating an additional flow of refugees. Chisinau, which has taken in the largest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita worldwide since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, is not equipped to handle the numbers this would entail. Moreover, as mentioned above, Transnistria is home to a contingent of Russian troops and a Soviet-era weapons depot, both of which would be affected by the instability in the region if a collapse were to occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This instability could force Chisinau to face the challenges a reunification process presents. Alternatively, if Russia ceases to provide its “free” gas, Chisinau could stave off volitivity by subsidizing the purchase of gas and electricity for both itself and the breakaway region. If this were to occur, the Moldovan government would likely need to turn to international partners for support given the costs associated with these subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in neither Chisinau’s nor Tiraspol’s interest to get into a back and forth tit-for-tat on energy, nor to let the Transnistrian energy market — and subsequently its entire economy — collapse. Ukraine also has a vested interest in Transnistrian stability, not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because a portion of Ukraine’s electrical grid is linked to Moldova’s via the hub in Transnistria. There is also the question of whether even Moscow would want a true crisis in Transnistria, especially one focused on energy, as it might break the implicit contract between Moscow, the government in Tiraspol, and the population residing in Transnistria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is in neither Chisinau’s nor Tiraspol’s interest to get into a back and forth tit-for-tat on energy, nor to let the Transnistrian energy market — and subsequently its entire economy — collapse.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also in both Chisinau’s and Tiraspol’s interests to keep energy prices as low as possible, especially at a time when the Moldovan populace has been economically depressed since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. This pricing is of concern not just for Chisinau seeking alternative sources of energy, but also for Transnistria. If Transnistria were cut off from heavily subsidized gas, but alternative sources were available to Transnistria at market rates, the pricing adjustments would create a shock to the economy that would likely lead to a refugee crisis, which would not only be a humanitarian problem but also a political one as it would occur approximately six months before the 2025 Moldovan parliamentary elections. Furthermore, the current electricity that Transnistria sells to Moldova is below market rate, so this arrangement also benefits Chisinau. This leaves Chisinau in the position of funding its own breakaway region for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gas-sector-overview&quot;&gt;Gas Sector Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Moldova has been heavily reliant on supply from Russia, specifically Gazprom, for nearly all its natural gas needs. Moldova’s gas company, Moldovagaz — with Russian Gazprom holding a 50 percent stake, the Moldovan government 35 percent, and Tiraspol 15 percent — monopolizes the gas sector. This has left the country vulnerable to Russian market manipulations and influence. The power of this ownership is particularly significant as more than half of Moldova’s energy supply is derived from natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it halted the direct import of Russian gas and began diversifying its gas supply in 2022, Moldova has also sought sources outside of Moldovagaz. Chisinau now uses Energocom, another state-owned Moldovan company. Of note, Energocom also participates in the auctions on the BRM (Romanian Commodities Exchange) gas exchange in Moldova to deliver gas to Moldovagaz. While this removed Gazprom from having ownership control, it has not created an environment that incentivizes private sector participation in the energy market. For example, the recent contracting negotiations with suppliers have been opaque at best, releasing neither volume nor pricing publicly. A state-owned entity conducting business in this manner is not a recipe for accountability to the Moldovan taxpayer, nor for private sector engagement in the sector in the short or long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming years, Moldova is expected to continue diversifying its gas sector by exploring a range of alternatives for expanding supply, including developing networks through Romania to import gas from EU markets; using Bulgarian networks to transport natural gas; and implementing the Vertical Corridor Initiative to import natural gas from the Caspian Sea and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from terminals in Greece. In fact, Moldova was instrumental in the first delivery of gas from Greece to Ukraine via the Vertical Corridor in 2023, which stored it in its underground storage space, the largest in the European Union. However, while Moldova has the Iasi-Ungheni gas interconnector operational and available as an alternative gas supply if the current main route — the Trans-Balkan pipeline — is unavailable, that option is significantly more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recent contracting negotiations with suppliers have been opaque at best, releasing neither volume nor pricing publicly. A state-owned entity conducting business in this manner is not a recipe for accountability to the Moldovan taxpayer, nor for private sector engagement in the sector.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that Moldova could enter the global LNG market and access resources from the United States and Qatar. Additionally, Moldova could import gas from Azerbaijan or Turkey by building extensions to the Trans-Anatolian pipeline. While these options are costly and time consuming, Moldova will want to avoid a return to reliance on a single source of gas. The country will likely continue pursuing energy market reforms aimed at liberalizing the market, increasing competition, and reducing the power of Moldovagaz, all of which necessitate private sector participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moldova will also likely continue working to improve its energy efficiency, thereby lessening the demand for energy, to a degree. Currently, many buildings use older technology for district heating, and consumers use two or three times more energy than would otherwise be required because they do not have horizontal distribution of heat with individual temperature controls. With the help of other countries and international financial institutions such as the World Bank Group, Moldova aims to modernize its gas and energy capabilities. As part of that strategy, in 2024, the Moldovan government launched a program focusing on increasing energy efficiency in residential buildings. Additionally, Moldova is working toward building and utilizing the alternative energy industry, thereby further reducing its reliance on natural gas and aligning with the European Union Clean Energy package and standards for a green economy as part of its EU accession aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the situation of Moldova’s gas sector overall is contingent on the outcomes of Moldova’s next presidential and parliamentary elections, as well as the trajectory of Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine. If pro-Russian government officials are elected in Moldova, the gas sector may revert to its historic dependency on Russian gas supply. But even if a pro-European government is elected and able to hold power, this will not be enough. It is essential that Moldova continue the challenging process of unbundling its energy sector, not only to comply with EU requirements but also to ensure that Moldova has an energy sector that is sufficiently diversified to withstand market and geopolitical fluctuations. This includes ensuring an environment that is sufficiently private sector friendly to not be so reliant on Western aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;electricity-sector-overview&quot;&gt;Electricity Sector Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electrical systems of the Eastern European region were designed under the assumption of a unified region, specifically under the control of the Soviet Union. Now, Moldova and Ukraine must manage fragmented pieces of a larger energy puzzle. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Moldova and Ukraine stayed connected to the Eastern European electrical system known as the Interconnected Power Systems, while Romania connected with the Western European system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built in 1964, the Cuciurgani power plant (MGRES) in Transnistria was the only power plant capable of meeting Moldova’s electricity consumption demands. Consequently, all electricity transmission infrastructure in Moldova was built around this plant. For many years, Gazprom has supplied the gas needed for electricity generation in Transnistria for “free” while billing Moldovagaz (and thus the Moldovan government in Chisinau) for the costs. This enabled the breakaway region to sell the electricity to Chisinau and to Transnistrian businesses at below market rates. This process continues today and is critical for Transnistria’s economy. Currently, approximately 80 percent of Moldova’s electricity is generated by the Cuciurgani power plant (MGRES), with the remaining portion either imported from Ukraine or produced domestically. Despite efforts by pro-European Moldovan politicians to reduce dependency on Russian energy, initiatives are often reversed by pro-Russian Moldovan officials. Implementing reforms also has been difficult due to a lack of investment in infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2022, in part due to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, Moldova and Ukraine conducted an energy synchronization with the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity. This gave both Moldova and Ukraine the ability to import electricity from EU markets. When Ukraine was forced to halt electricity exports due to Russian bombardments of its energy infrastructure, Moldova initially turned to Romania, at a more expensive rate. As a result of the increased costs, the Moldovan government chose to continue purchasing electricity from Transnistria on a short-term basis. To ensure long-term energy security, Moldova is currently working to increase grid stability and to build additional power lines — that do not pass through Transnistrian territory — in order to connect the country to the EU market. With the support of the European Investment Bank, lines between Vulcanesti-Chisinau and Balti-Suceava are expected to be operational in 2025 and 2028, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Moldova may have secured alternative sources of electricity starting in 2025, the questions surrounding Transnistrian electrical production and the gas supply to support it remain. If Russian gas ceases to flow into Transnistria or if Chisinau no longer purchases Transnistrian electricity, the effects to Transnistria will be devastating. The region’s electricity sector will have to look to Chisinau for help, and the breakaway region may have to purchase gas at market rates, which would be shocking and devastating to its economy. Tiraspol would also likely be pressured to integrate its energy infrastructure with Moldova. To adapt to these potential changes, Moldova will need to continue looking for new sources of electricity, increasing storage capacities, and exploring alternative energy possibilities. Additionally, as it currently stands, electricity even from Romania must transit through either Ukraine or Tiraspol before reaching Chisinau, further complicating the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the coming years, Moldova’s electricity sector is expected to make significant progress in diversification and integration with the EU energy market. Upon the completion of the Vulcanesti-Chisinau and Balti-Suceava power lines, Chisinau will be able to supply electricity without relying on Transnistria; a power line between Straseni-Iasi is under consideration as well. But further development of the electrical sector requires the government to implement reforms that align with EU standards in the electricity sector and modernize its grid. To incentivize private sector participation, Moldova must also improve its rule of law and ensure a stable environment for energy-market competitiveness and investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;alternative-energy-sector-overview&quot;&gt;Alternative Energy Sector Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, renewable energy represented 25 percent of gross energy consumption in Moldova, with biomass serving as the primary resource. Moldova’s biomass sector has been long under development, and the resource is utilized for heating purposes as well. Although Moldova’s alternative energy market is not as developed as that of some of its neighbors, the country has significant potential for alternative energy to play a major role in its energy production. While the country is attempting to expand its solar energy and wind energy sectors, it faces limitations in integrating generated energy into its grid due to the consumption patterns of its population and the lack of flexibility in the existing grid. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)’s BESS (battery energy storage system) and ICE (internal combustion engines) investment will increase Moldova’s grid stability and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Renewable Energy Promotion Law, which became active in 2018, created support mechanism schemes aimed at promoting the alternative energy market, including net metering, feed-in tariffs, and tendering. Net metering allows consumers who generate their own electricity from renewable sources to receive credit for the surplus electricity they feed back into the grid. Feed-in tariffs entail guaranteed payments, access to the grid, long-term contracts, and other incentives for entities developing renewable energy projects in the country. In January 2024, this was replaced by net billing, which allows individuals or companies who are generating electricity to feed surplus energy produced back into the grid. Although feed-in tariffs and net billing have already been implemented, the Moldovan government recently initiated its first renewables auction. The government allocated 165 megawatts of total capacity for wind and solar energy, reflecting the structure of consumption, generation, and grid availability. Moldova expects to see 190 million euros in associated investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rB5cKsN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these advancements, barriers to total renewable energy success persist. Sufficient wind and solar generation, grid stability, and functioning power plants are necessary to meet energy consumption demands. Unfortunately, Moldova’s largest power plant is in Transnistria, and this makes Moldova’s electricity supply dependent on both the Transnistrian government and the flow of “free” Russian gas. In 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Moldovan government introduced energy balancing to the market through relatively expensive and unplanned energy exchanges with nearby countries. Moldova’s current infrastructure is not yet capable of supporting large amounts of renewable energy generation. Many potential investors are deterred by these factors, as well as unstable rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2030, Moldova plans to increase the role of renewable energy in its electricity production by 30 percent. Not only is the transition to alternative energy better for the environment, but it also reduces dependence on Russian gas and electricity from MGRES, the Transnistrian electricity plant. To achieve this, Moldova will need to explore all available options, including developing new infrastructure for solar and wind energy. Since Moldova’s overall energy consumption is low, and its existing energy system is relatively small (the country mostly relies on imports), it does not have to dismantle any large-scale systems and can build from a relatively fresh slate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pGJnEuS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next five to ten years, Moldova is likely to increase its power system capacity and flexibility. This includes managing demand and investing in battery storage. Additionally, the country will need to attract investors in order to become less dependent on international aid. This will require Moldova to expand its renewable energy market and to ensure all market standards are aligned with the European Union regulations. Moldova will need to implement reforms streamlining bureaucratic processes, improving the transparency of technical guidelines, and ensuring fiscal stability; without such reform, private sector investors will shy away from the market. For example, Moldova recently opened an auction of renewable energy that was met with a tepid response from the investor community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in the country’s best interest that the government ensure all resources are being developed and are used efficiently, including hydropower, biofuel, and geothermal energy. Currently, Moldova has only one operational hydro installation, the Costesti-Stinca hydropower plant. The government will likely attempt to expand this sector to meet investors’ interests. Moldova could also develop a biofuel sector and utilize both liquid and solid biofuels to leverage its existing agricultural industry. To manage all of these renewable energy sources, Moldova will have to stabilize its current energy grid and supply. Ultimately, Moldova’s focus will likely extend beyond merely expanding renewable energy infrastructure to maximizing the development of all potential renewable resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;european-union-accession-and-foreign-aid&quot;&gt;European Union Accession and Foreign Aid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December of 2023, following their 2022 candidate status, the European Union opened formal accession talks for both Moldova and Ukraine. This was a recognition of the progress that both countries individually had made on the reform recommendations provided. Moldovan president Maia Sandu has indicated a goal of 2030 for EU membership, but there are structural challenges within the European Union to Moldova becoming a member. These challenges are unrelated to the many reforms Moldova must complete, including but not limited to reforms in the energy sector, before it is eligible for full membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In December of 2023, following their 2022 candidate status, the European Union opened formal accession talks for both Moldova and Ukraine.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the timeline for Moldova’s notional EU membership, progress is being made across sectors. Even before EU candidate status was granted, Moldova was already engaged with the European Union on several fronts, including but not limited to energy. In 2010, Moldova became a member of the Energy Community, a group of EU and non-EU members in southeastern Europe who have committed to adopting parts of EU energy-related legislation. As a part of this membership, Moldova agreed to reform its energy sector to comply with EU directives and antitrust laws; while several pieces of legislation have been adopted as of 2024, the process is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Moldova signed an Association Agreement with the European Union in which it committed to implementing the legislation by which all EU member states are bound, including legal and regulatory provisions related to the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the fifth EU-Moldova High-Level Energy Dialogue in 2024, both sides endorsed a roadmap that included a timeline for EU accession. The reform agenda and associated timeline are aggressive and Moldova is continuing to struggle to reach its commitments on the timeline; commitments include, among other things, increasing the energy efficiency of infrastructure and the use of renewable sources. Additionally, Moldova has committed to having 27 percent renewables by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key reforms in the EU package is the unbundling of the electrical and gas sectors. Unbundling refers to the separation in ownership of supply, generation, and transmission across a sector, in this instance specifically gas. During the 2021 negotiations between Moldovagaz and Gazprom, Moldova agreed not to proceed with unbundling the gas sector until the debt issue was resolved. As discussed previously, an independent review was conducted on Moldova’s debt, the results of which Russia is contesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU-required unbundling includes the separation of supply and generation from transmission operators for natural gas, thus bolstering incentives for private sector competition, particularly around gas infrastructure. As currently structured, Moldovagaz controls almost the entirety of the Moldovan gas business, including infrastructure. As discussed above, Moldovagaz is 50 percent owned by Russia’s Gazprom, 35 percent by Chisinau, and the remaining 15 percent by the government in Tiraspol. Moldovagaz’s ownership structure is further complicated by a Moldovagaz subsidiary, Tiraspoltransgaz, which provides gas to and owns the gas-related infrastructure in Transnistria. After the European Union opened infringement proceedings against Moldova for their continued failure to unbundle in 2021, Moldova has begun to make progress in this arena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moldova’s other improvements in gas sector reforms include adopting regulation around network codes and market rules. There has also been significant progress in both the gas and electrical sectors with regard to regional integration. For example, on the electrical side, both Moldova and Ukraine became connected to the European grid following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In October of 2023, Moldova was granted observer status in the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity; to become a full member, Moldova must implement the Catalogue of Measures, work which is supported by USAID. And when the Chisinau-Vulcanesti line is completed (which is projected to be in 2025), electricity will flow into Moldova without passing through Transnistria. These are not the only reforms needed on the pathway to a free and fair energy sector in Moldova; more on this is discussed in the recommendations section of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU support for Moldovan energy development has included grant funding to individuals making improvements in their homes to increase energy efficiency, as well as ongoing energy subsidies for economically disadvantaged populations within the country. While the European Union has provided significant development assistance to Moldova’s energy sector, it is far from the only donor in this space. The United States has supported Moldova’s energy development across the interagency portfolio; for example, the Development Finance Corporation has provided millions of dollars to support political risk insurance for energy projects. The U.S. State Department and USAID have been working on projects funded through a $394 million investment in support of energy sector development. This includes a focus on developing the country’s power grid, as well as supporting foreign investments in the energy sector, especially in renewable energy sources. The U.S. government is one of the main donors providing capacity building to key energy sector entities and supporting legal-regulatory reforms required as a part of the European Union’s energy directives, regulations, and provisions in Moldova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The U.S. government is one of the main donors providing capacity building to key energy sector entities and supporting legal-regulatory reforms required as a part of the European Union’s energy directives, regulations, and provisions in Moldova.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support has also come in from a variety of multilateral institutions. The United Nations Development Programme and the government of Japan have funded development of the biomass sector, as well as additional energy development in partnership with Switzerland. NATO and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have also supported the continued growth of Moldova’s energy security. The EBRD has been a key source of support for Moldova’s energy development. The World Bank recently launched an initiative that includes support for renovating public buildings and heating. Support has come bilaterally across Europe from countries including but not limited to Bulgaria, Germany, France, Lithuania, and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outpouring of aid must not disincentivize the development of a robust energy private sector in Moldova. This requires donating countries to not only bear this potential for market disruption in mind when providing aid but also to hold the Moldovan government accountable for the commitments and progress it has made as a part of energy sector development. It is essential that future support for Moldova be contingent on continued development and reform of the energy sector, including but not limited to the solutions outlined in the following section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ensuring-a-bright-future&quot;&gt;Ensuring a Bright Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moldova’s energy picture is complex and largely rooted in the country’s history — not only regarding reliance on Russian gas, but also the very structure and ownership of its state-owned gas company, Moldovagaz, which still leaves Russia with a controlling interest. There is also, of course, the reliance on Transnistria — with its close ties to Russia — for electricity, not only in terms of the current production but also as all power lines presently run through this breakaway region. Over the past few years, significant progress has been made toward a more independent and secure future for Moldovan energy, but more work is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growth has been aided by partners and allies across the globe. And efforts driven by the need to meet EU requirements have the potential, if done correctly, to continue this trajectory. There is still much to be done in order to achieve not only Moldovan energy independence, but also a Moldovan energy sector that is based on free-market competition and rule-of-law principles. Outlined below are six key recommendations for ensuring a bright energy future for Moldova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Domestic Electrical Connectivity and Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While sources of natural gas have been diversified for Moldova, the same is not yet true for electricity. Most of the electricity generated for Moldova is via the plant in Transnistria; all the physical lines supplying Moldovan electricity run through Transnistria. This will change when the Chisinau-Vulcanesti line is operational, as this line will not run through Transnistria. However, this line is unlikely to be able to provide all electricity needed to supply both Moldova and Transnistria at peak usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that capacity needs to be further increased. The essential capacity needs to not only be supplied by lines that do not pass through the Transnistria hub, but also should be used as an opportunity for Moldova, outside of Transnistria, to generate its own electricity, and not simply import from either Romania or other allies and partners. Among other collaborations in process between Ukraine and Moldova is the exploration of a gas-to-electricity exchange in which Moldova would build the capacity to produce electricity (outside of Transnistria) and Ukraine would supply gas, which it continues to produce. Moldova, Ukraine, and Romania must work to get their lines out of Transnistria and to integrate their systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Impartial Oversight and Support for Unbundling and Deregulation of Gas Sector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of unbundling the gas sector is still in its early stages and faces many hurdles, including the ongoing contestation of the debts owed and Gazprom’s majority ownership stake in Moldovagaz. In practice, this means that Gazprom can vote against many of the changes needed to move forward. It is essential that Russia’s proxy Gazprom be removed from this industry entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There must be oversight, transparency, and technical support throughout all elements of the unbundling process. This will not only ensure free-market best practices are leveraged, but also that the process is free from both actual and apparent corruption. Transparency and oversight will also provide the ability to shine a public light on any tactics Gazprom may employ to delay or divert the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, its partners, and its allies should extend on-the-ground, technical, expert-staff augmentation to support the development of regulations both for the gas sector and for the entirety of the restructuring process. This staff augmentation is especially important given Moldova’s challenges with personnel capacity across all sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Create a Secure and Enabling Environment for Investments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process for investment in the energy sector must be clear, transparent, and provide ease of access for potential investors. This is important to increase the volume and types of investments that come not only from within Moldova, but also from the diaspora and other investors across the globe. There must also be foreign investment limitations, including effective and as-transparent-as-possible investment screening to ensure that malign actors, including but not limited to Russian state-owned or affiliated enterprises, cannot bid. These clarity and screening processes need to be in effect prior to unbundling, thereby continuing to ensure that the overall process is done freely, fairly, and securely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Moldova’s geographic location — less than four hours from the frontlines of Ukraine — and investors’ concerns over stability are impediments to capital investment, they are not the only ones. There is also the history of corruption across all Moldovan sectors, as well as bureaucratic ineffectiveness and challenges with consistent rule of law. The combination of these factors means that there is a need for structural changes within the law — and therefore, to some degree, election proof — to align incentives for investors to put money in Moldova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such change is the creation of formal, government-sanctioned advisory boards for Moldovan gas, electricity, and alternative energy sectors, at least. These boards must include representation from the European Union, the U.S. government across the government agencies with stakes in these efforts, and private industry from across the globe. It is essential to include a varied group in order to ensure that these recommendations are not designed with a singular interest in mind but instead are long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the selection process for members of these advisory boards and their work should be made public on an ongoing basis. This is of critical importance as state-owned enterprises have long been a magnet for corrupt interests in Moldova. With Moldova’s commitments to the IMF, the country has agreed to the creation of corporate governance structures and the review of appointees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These boards should work with the energy ministry and make recommendations for policies and practices that are needed to stimulate investment in the energy sector in the short and medium term. These groups should provide specific solutions, timelines, and resources associated with decisions to implement. Foreign donors seeking to help the Moldovan energy sector must work with these boards to provide a long-term, sustainable pathway for the development of a robust energy private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Reforming Corporate Governance Structures and ANRE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a need to revisit myriad corporate governance structures, starting with Moldovagaz and moving across the entire energy sector. The development of updated structures and new processes for appointments or reappointments need to be done publicly and with monitoring from development partners to ensure scrutiny and to limit kickbacks or even the appearance of impropriety. There also needs to be a careful vetting of all current holders of these roles, as well as senior leadership at ANRE. This would align with the ongoing and proposed vetting happening elsewhere across Moldovan government. In order for any system or industry to function, there should be a natural tension between stakeholders, including but not limited to regulators, private sector entities, oversight bodies, and agencies; this is healthy in any free-market sector. To help ensure there is tension, rather than collusion, between these groups, there must be ethics regulations, including gift limitations, in place prior to the appointments or reappointments of individuals to the advisory boards and ANRE. These ethics regulations should be developed with the help of EU partners and must include methods to report violations and enforce compliance. If done thoughtfully, these ethics rules could be applied across the government and all sectors in Moldova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Cybersecurity for the Energy Sector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks have increased in frequency and scale within Moldova and include significant cyber incursions targeting infrastructure. It is likely that cyberattacks targeting the energy sector will increase as the negotiations with Gazprom around unbundling and with Transnistria on issues related to energy continue. Regardless of a short-term increase, it is of utmost long-term importance that, as new physical energy infrastructure is brought online and new private sector energy players enter, there be an integrated strategy for cybersecurity across the Moldovan energy sector. Improving cybersecurity for the energy sector is essential not only to protect publicly owned infrastructure and government agencies, but also to integrate protections across private entities within the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Moldovan government has taken steps to implement best practices in cybersecurity, including their 2023 cybersecurity law (set to go into effect in 2025), there are still gaps. This law, which will require incident reporting as well as safeguards, cooperation, and network standards, is just a first step. The Moldovan government should work with the private sector, as well as international partners and allies, to develop an energy sector–specific plan at the national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sector-specific strategy must include details for energy subsectors, a focus on increasing public-private partnership, and diplomatic engagement, including shared intelligence. The strategy must be created with timelines aligned to resourcing and include not only incident response plans but also strategies to train and prepare for these potential occurrences across the sector. Cyber and physical security must be fully integrated within the strategy and include access controls, as well as the screening and vetting of associated personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Transnistrian Reintegration in Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Russia continues its hybrid warfare against Moldova, it could focus on energy as part of its continued cyber-assault. Moreover, it is near certain that pro-Russian candidates will continue to leverage energy-focused narratives — including what the pricing would look like were they to be elected — against pro-Western candidates and parties. These narratives are especially important in Transnistria, where the majority of the population are Russian speakers, because, whether causal or not, consuming Russian media is correlated with higher trust in the Russian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anticipated end of the Russian-Ukrainian gas contract in December 2024 has brought to the forefront the challenges that the Transnistrian economy, government, and people would face if Russian gas were to no longer flow there for free. Even if this gas were provided at cost, the difference in price would be so significant that it would crash the Transnistrian economy and lead to a refugee crisis. This means that it is in both Chisinau’s and Tiraspol’s interest to find a long-term solution to Transnistria’s energy instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negotiations along this pathway toward long-term energy sustainability for Transnistria, as an integrated part of Moldova, must be conducted between Chisinau and Tiraspol. Chisinau will have more leverage in 2025 than ever before; the Chisinau-Vulcanesti power line will give Chisinau the first electrical power line that does not run through Transnistria. As discussed earlier, by 2025, at a minimum, the transit method for providing Russian gas to Transnistria will have changed. These are key leverage points for Chisinau to use to bring Tiraspol leadership to the table in developing a collaborative, realistic, and time-bound plan to further reintegrate Transnistria with Moldova.&lt;/p&gt;

Disrupting Russia’s access to ammunition and new artillery barrels should therefore be a central focus for Ukraine’s supporters.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;The findings within this paper will empower Ukraine’s Western partners to coordinate sanctions, diplomatic pressure and civil society efforts to exploit the vulnerabilities of Russia’s artillery supply chain and reduce its access to ammunition and barrels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, attempts to disrupt Russia’s military supply chains have achieved some successes, with thousands of Russian entities and individuals sanctioned, and evidence of raw materials being diverted from the Russian supply chain. By and large, however, they have targeted components or high-priority items that are difficult to disrupt, such as microchips, and have not taken a view as to which supply chains should be disrupted. Instead, the current approach has been to try and restrict the access of the entire Russian defence industry to key materials and equipment like machine tools. While this approach is admirable in its ambition and has produced many sanctions and even some effects, it has struggled to measurably restrict the growth of Russia’s defence industry and its ability to fuel the war. This paper’s findings indicate that a more effective approach is to focus on a single supply chain and identify the raw materials, products and machinery that sit outside Russia and must be imported. These elements of the supply chain may be open to Western interventions from a variety of angles, and their limited nature, combined with the overall importance of artillery, could empower governments to focus disruption efforts on these elements, to meaningfully degrade and disrupt Russia’s artillery supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To evidence this, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of Russia’s artillery supply chain – from raw iron ore, cotton and sulphuric acid to the 2S19 Msta-S howitzers – to identify vulnerabilities that could be disrupted by Ukraine’s Western partners. It also provides an indication of the expansion of Russia’s defence industry that is currently underway. The objective of this research is to show the ways in which Russia’s supply chains are truly vulnerable, and to inform future policy decisions that are taken towards supply chain disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has led to three key conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s artillery supply chain is complex, but exposed in procurement of key raw materials and components from abroad. More than 70% of Russia’s computer numerical control machines come from China, 55% of its chromium is imported, and its imports of nitrocellulose have increased by 70% since 2022, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is redundancy within the supply chain, and even a complete disruption of the Plastmass ammunition plant – a major producer – would not lead to a collapse in Russia’s ammunition supply. It could remove 300,000 rounds from Russia’s artillery ammunition production capacity, but there are alternative sources. This necessitates a comprehensive and focused approach to disruption, with intra- and inter-governmental coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Russia’s defence industry is expanding, with major works identified at the Perm and Kazan Gunpowder plants, Izhevsk Unmanned Systems Research and Production Association, several armoured-machine repair plants and Kurganpribor. However, the industry faces challenges such as a lack of personnel and a crumbling rail infrastructure that is struggling to meet the demands of the war, as well as the need for imported machinery to meet its aggressive expansion goals. There is a window of opportunity for Western governments to slow this expansion; otherwise, they risk facing a rejuvenated and more capable Russian defence industry when the invasion of Ukraine is over.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, elements of Russia’s artillery supply chain are relatively robust and contained within its borders. This led to the conclusion and key recommendation from the paper, which is that Ukraine’s Western partners can achieve the greatest impact by focusing on Russia’s import of key materials before they reach the country. These parts of the supply chain are the most vulnerable to external influence, whereas the elements that sit inside Russia, or can be smuggled with relative ease, are difficult to regulate without coordinated corporate compliance, and often have established networks for sanctions evasion. Disruption should, of course, focus on vulnerabilities rather than taking a broad-spectrum approach, and within the gamut of vulnerabilities, Western governments are most likely to have success against those outside Russia’s borders. For example, it is apparent that Russia is facing recruitment challenges in its expansion: this is a vulnerability, but it may prove difficult to disrupt recruitment from Washington or London. Another vulnerability is that many companies in the artillery supply chain rely on Western machinery and/or Western businesses, or still have European subsidiaries that keep them supplied with key materials and components. This report shows the role that these companies play in the supply of howitzers and ammunition to the frontlines and indicates that targeted efforts to disrupt these elements of the supply chain are more likely to lead to success than a broad spectrum approach, and may create the disruption that policy makers are hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has demonstrated determination and bravery from day one of the invasion and has upset Russia’s military plans time and again. However, Russia’s greater economic and industrial capacity is likely to be a determining factor in the ultimate outcome of the war. This need not be the case: Russia’s industrial might can and should be disrupted with a focused effort on the artillery supply chain. Doing so will save Ukrainian lives, degrade Russia’s offensive and defensive capabilities, and weaken its overall ability to fight the war in the way that its units have grown accustomed to. The Russian threat will not disappear, regardless of what happens in Ukraine – the expansion of its defence industry and armed forces makes this clear. However, there is a window of opportunity for Western powers to disrupt this expansion and slow production to prevent further Russian successes in 2025. That window is small, but Ukraine and its Western partners have the tools and knowledge to make the most of it and reduce the threat posed by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper provides a comprehensive overview of Russia’s artillery supply chain. It set out with the ambitious goal of mapping the supply chain, from the extraction and processing of raw materials needed for producing howitzers and ammunition, to their delivery to the frontline in Ukraine. The goal of the paper is to inform a cross-government, and ideally inter-governmental, approach to disrupting this specific supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research has been conducted through the layering of different datasets and the expertise of a research team built specifically for this type of task. The data used includes: records from commercial providers of trade data; trade data from the UN; and publicly available information released either by the companies and enterprises involved, or through leaked financial records seen by the report authors that reveal the nature of contracts between Russian manufacturers. Extensive analysis has been conducted of Russia’s internal railway data, which was obtained via a commercial trade platform, to provide additional granularity on the nature of supply between manufacturers. Many online sources are no longer available, as Russian websites relating to defence are frequently changed or removed, and company websites may have been altered to obscure their involvement in Russia’s defence industry. The Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/) and other internet archives have been used to locate and interrogate past iterations of websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That data has been collated and organised to detail the process required to get from iron ore to a finished howitzer, or from cotton to a propellant charge for an artillery projectile. The research is focused on Russia’s manufacturers of 122 mm, 152 mm and 203 mm howitzer ammunition, and 82 mm and 120 mm mortar ammunition. However, many of the companies involved in this supply chain also produce components for rocket ammunition and anti-tank guided missiles. The paper sets out to establish which elements of the supply chain might prove vulnerable to the policy levers available to a Western government, such as the application of sanctions, diplomatic pressure, preclusive purchases, or the disruption of financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper gives a brief explanation of the role that artillery plays in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and why it is important to focus disruption efforts on that supply chain. It sets out the component parts of a typical howitzer before exploring the supply chain for Russian howitzers in detail. The same process is repeated for artillery ammunition, taking raw materials as the starting point. The key companies involved in each step of the process are profiled, and where possible, the volume of their transactions with the Russian Ministry of Defence (Russian MoD) are indicated. The final element of the artillery supply chain – the delivery of howitzers and ammunition to the frontlines – is briefly covered to provide an overall picture of the Russian artillery lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Western countries have brought hundreds of sanctions into force against Russian companies and individuals. They have applied tools such as diplomatic pressure and public shaming of companies in a bid to limit Russia’s access to key Western technology. This approach has enjoyed some success, but has failed to prevent the growth of Russia’s domestic defence industry, or to alter the balance of power in the invasion. If Ukraine is to win, Russia’s artillery supply chain must be disrupted; no theory of victory for Ukraine will be viable as long as Russia’s supply of artillery systems and ammunition remains intact. This paper aims to help address this challenge by providing an assessment of where this supply chain is vulnerable to external action by Western governments, and showing that Russia’s defence industry is far from the Soviet behemoth of the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-1-why-artillery&quot;&gt;Chapter 1: Why Artillery?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The balance of artillery between Russia and Ukraine is the single greatest determinant of the distribution of casualties and equipment loss, the balance of military initiative, the calculus of what is operationally possible, and thus the political perception of the trajectory of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial Russian invasion force that entered Ukraine on 24 February 2022 fielded 2,214 artillery systems, of which 1,635 were howitzers and 579 were multiple rocket launchers (MRLs). Russia originally viewed the invasion as a “Special Military Operation” in which the military component was to conduct a coup de main to capitalise on the destabilisation of the Ukrainian state by Russia’s special services. When this failed, the Russian military found itself fighting the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), which fielded 1,176 tube artillery systems and 1,680 MRLs, in a conventional war. Alongside Ukraine’s resolve, and Russian disorganisation, this imbalance in artillery in Ukraine’s favour was a key factor in the defeat of Russian forces north of Kyiv and near Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv, and Ukraine’s successful retention of Donbas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, however, only had ammunition to support its artillery park until mid-May 2022. The result was that when Russia regrouped and launched an offensive on Donbas, it was able to achieve an indirect fires superiority of up to 20:1 in some areas, as Ukraine’s artillery was starved of munitions. It is also important to note that this disparity in artillery gave the Kremlin the confidence that they could defeat the AFU without mobilising additional troops, despite being outnumbered by Ukraine at this time. Artillery is the centre of gravity for Russia’s ground forces. It is seen as the most efficient means to defeat an opponent’s forces, either through destruction or by weakening them to such an extent that an offensive is certain to succeed. Recognising the central and foundational role of artillery in Russia’s armed forces is key to understanding the priorities for disrupting Russia’s war machine. Whereas NATO forces broadly see artillery as a supporting element that is designed to set the conditions for manoeuvre forces to engage an enemy, the Russians see manoeuvre forces as responsible for both getting the enemy into a position where artillery can defeat them, and then exploit the destruction achieved by artillery. This was what Russia was doing to the AFU in Donbas in May to June 2022. It is also why, when the AFU received the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) from its international partners and began to unpick Russian artillery logistics, this brought Russian forces to a standstill, ceding the initiative to Ukraine, until Russia began the process of military mobilisation over the winter of 2022 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Russian mobilisation, the artillery advantage has consistently sat with Russia. Russia reached a high point in its rate of fire at around 38,000 rounds per day in June 2022. For the remainder of the war, the rate of Russian fire has been fairly consistent, at between 7,000 and 16,000 rounds per day, averaging at around 10,000 rounds per day. Ukrainian artillery fire, meanwhile, peaked at around 9,000 rounds per day, and has rarely exceeded 6,000 rounds per day, while in early 2024, Ukraine was firing fewer than 1,800 rounds per day. This disparity is largely a product of Russia’s deep stockpiles and industrial mobilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its fielded artillery park, Russia entered the war with approximately 13,985 artillery systems and 2,700 MRLs in storage, though not all of them were suitable for restoration. Ukraine has succeeded in inflicting sustained losses on Russia’s artillery park, but Russia’s defence industry has mobilised for war and is working to replace those losses. Many of the enterprises involved in Russia’s artillery supply chain are working triple shifts. As a consequence, the Ukrainian General Staff assessed in February 2024 that the Russian Operational Group of Forces inside Ukraine was fielding 4,780 tube artillery systems, as well as 1,130 MRLs. Despite the losses inflicted by Ukraine, Russia has managed to increase the number of artillery systems available to its forces over the opening invasion force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also succeeded in stabilising the supply of ammunition to support its rate of fire. Russian ammunition production for 152 mm howitzers quadrupled in the first year of the war to one million rounds. By the end of 2023, Russia had increased the totality of its ammunition production and is expected to produce 1.325 million new 152 mm rounds in 2024, as well as 800,000 122 mm rounds, and to refurbish an even larger number of rounds from remaining stockpiles. It is procuring millions more from North Korea, Iran, Syria and Belarus. By comparison, the AFU has received more than 600 155 mm howitzers from Ukraine’s international partners, but a significant proportion of these have been destroyed, and ammunition supplies have been limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This disparity has had a range of tangible effects on the course of the fighting. The considerable attention paid to first-person view (FPV) drones conceals the reality that artillery continues to be the biggest cause of death and injury among Ukrainian troops. The actual percentage varies along the length of the frontline and is not uniform, but a paper written by the Global Medical and Surgical Support Group in 2023 observed that 70% of all Ukrainian combat casualties had been caused by Russian artillery. The casualties often suffered severe wounds, including polytrauma to multiple organ systems, which, if not fatal, would likely prevent them from returning to service. Russian artillery has also inflicted widespread concussion among Ukrainian troops subjected to barrage, with multiple concussions over time leading to personnel having to be withdrawn from the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continued disparity in fire is one reason why the Kremlin believes it can still win the war. With approximately 1,200 km of active frontline, Ukraine must maintain enough combat-capable personnel to both hold defensive positions across this area and have enough reserves to rotate its units. The rate of rotation is increased in those sectors where units are under pressure. The accumulation of killed and wounded, with artillery injuries often causing wounds that prevent troops from returning to service even if they survive, is a strategic threat to Ukraine’s ability to sustain the war effort. As of August 2024, the Russian theory of victory does not centre on major breakthroughs, but rather on the destruction of the AFU as a force capable of defending the breadth of front through attrition, and it is artillery that is primarily inflicting the constant attrition of Ukrainian troops. The Russian leadership likely believes it can kill its way out of the war, and artillery will be key to doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, so long as Russia maintains a substantial advantage in artillery systems, it can use tactics that will, over time, deplete the AFU of reserves – a critical vulnerability for Ukraine. For example, fixing the AFU into defending terrain can allow Russian artillery to inflict significant casualties on Ukrainian forces as they rotate and are resupplied. In other cases, Russia has used its artillery to destroy Ukrainian towns that come into range. This has fixed the AFU politically into defending unfavourable terrain to delay the widespread depopulation of nearby population centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s artillery advantage also constrains Ukraine’s tactical options, thereby limiting the risk to Russian forces. For example, during the Ukrainian offensive of 2023, Ukraine managed to concentrate 55 155 mm howitzers on its main axis of advance, as well as a variety of Soviet calibre guns along the front. The total number of Ukrainian guns in action is sensitive and therefore remains undisclosed, but suffice to say that it was unable to properly resource the artillery fight in support of its offensive. Russia fielded 720 guns and 230 MRLs across the southern front, and was able to concentrate a significant proportion of those around priority areas. This meant that the Ukrainian artillery concentration struggled to be brought forward because of strikes from Lancet-3M loitering munitions and counter-battery fire on what was a limited frontage. Thus, Ukrainian forces advanced into a fire pocket where they could not suppress Russian artillery, and so accepted disproportionate risk if they rose from their trenches. Given Ukraine’s need to husband limited artillery and ammunition stockpiles, this situation meant that any advance had to be carefully planned and executed, both reducing the number of points at which Ukraine could dynamically threaten Russian units and slowing the tempo of Ukrainian operations. If the conditions for successful offensive action were not obtained with sufficient quantities of howitzers and munitions, this would also increase the cost to the AFU as they were unable to counter the Russian fires superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effectively constraining Russian artillery – even to achieve parity with the AFU as regards the availability at any given point in the front – would therefore have a transformative effect on the character of the war. It would achieve three things. First, it would reduce the rate of Ukraine’s casualties, alleviating the pressure of rotation, and thereby allowing the AFU to preserve the fighting power of its units in defence. Second, it would reduce Russia’s ability to punish Ukrainian attempts to conduct localised attacks, thereby increasing the proportion of Russian forces that must be held across the front to defend each sector, and so reducing the felt effect of Russia’s advantage in personnel along the front. Third, a consequence of the preceding effects would be to stabilise the front. Between the reduced attrition of the AFU and the reduced offensive combat power of Russian forces, limiting Russia’s access to artillery would likely undermine Russia’s theory of victory and make the conflict sustainable for Ukraine in the long term. This would protract the war, increasing the risk to the Russian economy. It would therefore reverse the current trajectory of the conflict, where Russian leverage in potential negotiations is gaining as the AFU becomes weaker, and would instead leave Russia with the prospect of accumulating damage to its critical national infrastructure, the depletion of its stockpiles, and the growing vulnerability of its domestic economy, without any confidence that it would achieve its objectives militarily. Even if negotiations end the intensity of the fighting, limiting Russia’s ability to regenerate its artillery stockpiles is critical to reducing the threat of renewed hostilities against Ukraine or a conventional threat emerging against Georgia, Moldova or European NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reduction in casualty rates and equipment loss for the AFU, were the volume of Russian artillery fire to be curtailed, could also allow new recruits to be kept in training for longer and formed into new units, rather than pushed to units on the front as battlefield replacements. Given that the West has a limited supply of artillery systems and armoured vehicles and is not yet producing equipment in sufficient quantities to replace losses, the reduction in the rate of equipment destruction at the front is also important if the AFU is to build new units for future operations. The reduction of Russia’s artillery park is therefore a prerequisite for Ukraine rebuilding its capacity to achieve the liberation of its occupied territories. The prospect of Ukraine regaining such a capability must necessarily increase the risk of Russia continuing the conflict, building Ukrainian leverage to terminate the conflict on favourable terms. The disruption of Russia’s artillery supply chains should consequently be of the highest priority for Ukraine’s international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-2-what-makes-a-russian-howitzer&quot;&gt;Chapter 2: What Makes a Russian Howitzer?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A howitzer is a large-calibre gun, over 100 mm in diameter, designed to fire large shells filled with high explosives. It can be self-propelled or towed. In Russian service, most self-propelled howitzers are based on tracked armoured vehicles designed during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vehicle protects the crew from small arms fire and other howitzers, and carries the system’s ammunition. Towed howitzers are moved around by the crew, which operates out in the open, exposed to enemy fire. Ammunition is typically carried in the truck that tows the howitzer, or pre-positioned so that the gun can be moved between different areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core component of a howitzer is its gun assembly, which includes the barrel, breech, a bore evacuator (on a self-propelled howitzer), and a muzzle brake. The gun assembly is installed into an armoured hull with electric servos that elevate the barrel, and recuperators that absorb the recoil generated by firing the gun. The vehicle that carries the barrel in a self-propelled howitzer is built from armoured steel that is rolled to the correct thickness, often while heated, and welded into shape. This becomes the hull, which is then fitted with an engine and transmission. A drive sprocket is attached to the transmission through final drives to provide the vehicle’s motion. The weight of the vehicle is supported through road wheels attached to torsion bar suspension, which all rest upon the track. The track is built using segments connected with pins, and helps disperse the vehicle’s weight over a wider area, which in turn improves its ability to cross weak terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/B3t1toS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: D-30 2A18 Russian towed artillery.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Open Source Centre.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the gun assembly, drive train and running gear have been added to the hull, the howitzer is fitted with a fire control system. The fire control system is a computer that is used to enter coordinates and meteorological data to support the firing of the howitzer. It generates ballistic calculations that, in an ideal setting, will account for air pressure, wind and the temperature of the ammunition. The ballistic calculation generates the elevation for the gun that will give the greatest chance of successfully delivering rounds against a target. A howitzer will typically carry a radio that allows the crew to communicate with other howitzers, its battery commander or the force that it is supporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final element that makes a howitzer is the ammunition. There are three components to an artillery round: the charge, the projectile and the fuse. The charge is built from nitrocellulose and propels the projectile out of the barrel at very high speeds in a ballistic arc towards the target. The projectile is made of steel with thick walls that may be pre-fragmented. The shell is filled with an explosive material that is detonated by the fuse. The fuse is a cone-shaped object that is screwed into the nose of the projectile before it is loaded into the gun; it detonates the explosive filling inside the projectile either when it hits the ground, or just above it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia employs different calibre artillery systems to the West, including howitzers that are towed and self-propelled with 122 mm, 152 mm and 203 mm barrels. They are accompanied by mortars, which can also be towed or self-propelled and are used with 82 mm, 120 mm and 240 mm barrels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bWebmte.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of the smallest howitzers is greater than the range of the biggest mortars. A mortar uses less propellant to fire its projectiles at a high angle. As a result, mortars have a shorter range and may take longer to reach their target. A howitzer has a longer and stronger barrel, which enables more propellent and heavier projectiles to be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howitzer projectiles typically deliver more explosive energy; however, the lower weight and size of mortars and their ammunition means that they can be carried and used by infantry, with howitzers typically held further back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-3-howitzer-supply-chains&quot;&gt;Chapter 3: Howitzer Supply Chains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern military supply chains are deeply complex, often requiring inputs from a variety of entities and culminating with a systems integrator, where the component parts are assembled into a finished vehicle or weapon. This can make it difficult to understand supply chains – and where they are vulnerable. This chapter attempts to set out the primary elements in Russia’s howitzer supply chain through an in-depth look at the production of howitzer barrels. Barrels are a consumable product that must be replaced regularly or their accuracy and efficacy declines – unlike items such as armoured plates or engines, which are rarely required unless new systems are being built. At present, Russia is modernising or refurbishing many of its armoured vehicles and maintaining a large arsenal of howitzers in Ukraine. This indicates that barrel production may be a bottleneck in Russia’s ability to sustain its artillery forces in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manufacturers&quot;&gt;Manufacturers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BWTDAiw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Cannon units for Msta-S, made by Volgograd-based Titan-Barrikady Plant, ready for assembly at Uraltransmash in Yekaterinburg, April 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Russian military correspondent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery system production in Russia is a centralised network of interconnected manufacturers, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers and research and development (R&amp;amp;D) partners, managed mainly by Rostec, the state-governed defence holding, in direct cooperation with the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army. In 2023, Rostec announced an internal reorganisation on the “gun-to-shot” principle, which aimed to streamline production of tanks and artillery by separating them and allowing each group to specialise. It transferred companies in the artillery supply chain from UralVagonZavod, Russia’s main tank manufacturer, to Tekhmash, which had previously focused on ammunition production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key artillery production facilities are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uraltransmash:&lt;/strong&gt; The main assembly facility for Russian artillery systems is a 143-hectare plant in Yekaterinburg which also produces trams and oil pumps for the civilian market. The plant has its own engineering and design centre for artillery, SKB Transmash-Spetstekhnika, and tests howitzers on a 15,000-hectare artillery range 17 km north of the plant. Uraltransmash developed and manufactured the main artillery systems used by the Russian army, such as the 2S3 Akatsiya, which entered service in the 1970s, and the 2S19 Msta-S, which was produced from 1989. According to Russian brand registers, the plant now owns the Msta-S, Koalitsiya-SV, Akatsiya, Tyulpan and Giatsint howitzer brands, which make up the majority of self-propelled howitzers (SPH) in Russian service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motovilikha Plant:&lt;/strong&gt; Earlier towed versions of the Msta-S howitzers and other self-propelled machines – such as the 2S23 Nona, a 120 mm mortar based on the wheeled chassis of a BTR-80 armoured fighting vehicle – have been assembled at the SKB Motovilikha Plant. The plant went into bankruptcy in 2018 and stopped delivery to the Russian army in 2022. To preserve its manufacturing processes in 2023 it was transferred to Remdizel, a Rostec-affiliated company, before being fully acquired by Rostec subsidiary Tekhnodinamika in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zavod No. 9:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a former production unit of Uralmashzavod and specialises in barrel manufacturing, being one of the four main artillery suppliers. It produces D-30 towed howitzers and various tank guns, including the 2A20 U-5TS Molot for the modernised T-62 and 2А46 for the T-72, T-64A and T-90. The plant is also the manufacturer of the Soviet-era 125-mm 2A45 Sprut-A and 2A45M Sprut-B anti-tank guns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Titan-Barrikady:&lt;/strong&gt; The Volgograd-based plant has specialised in a diverse range of artillery and missile systems and its portfolio includes Msta-B and Msta-S howitzers (the latter’s assembly has been recently moved to Uraltransmash).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Krasny Oktyabr:&lt;/strong&gt; Titan-Barrikady has been vertically integrated with the nearby Krasny Oktyabr metallurgy plant, which specialises in the production of special steel, and the two plants share energy and forging infrastructure. Krasny Oktyabr does not list military uses for its products, but Russian archives have records of the plant casting 152 mm barrels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hull of a howitzer is built from high-hardness steel that is hot- or cold-rolled until it forms a material called rolled homogeneous armour (RHA). After the collapse of the USSR, Russia developed its own production of RHA, having previously relied on plants in Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia and Mariupol in Ukraine. According to the armour steel Institute Stali, the three main steel suppliers for tanks and artillery are Krasny Oktyabr iron &amp;amp; steel plant, Magnitogorsk Iron &amp;amp; Steel Works (MMK) and OMZ-Spetstal. Establishing these production capabilities required a serious re-adjustment and investment in specialised production facilities with little to no civilian application, which suggests they are reliant upon the Russian defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eOLAPWz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: The MSTA System.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Open Source Centre.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary supplier of diesel engines for Russian tanks and self-propelled howitzers is the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant (Uraltrak) , while some newer models - such as the wheeled 2S34 Malva - use engines from the Yaroslavl Motor Plant. Engine production requires heat-resistant high-alloy steel for elements such as valves and fasteners, and high-precision computer numerical control (CNC) machines. Tracks for tanks and self-propelled artillery have similar requirements, and are forged by Rostec-owned Omsktransmash and Kalashnikov Concern’s Lipetsk Mechanical Plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its physical structure and gun, a howitzer carries a fire control system. The traditional supplier of automated fire guidance and navigation systems for Russian howitzers is the Signal Research Institute, based in Kovrov. Like most other strategic enterprises, it is part of Rostec, and is held within the group’s missile-manufacturing arm. It supplies the newest version of Russia’s automated fire control system ASUNO, which has been in development since 2019 and was first shown at the Ukrainian frontline in June 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these companies will have their own supply chains, from raw materials through to finished products that are delivered to Uraltransmash for assembly into a howitzer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;barrel-production&quot;&gt;Barrel Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike armour or engine production, barrel production is a constant requirement for any military. This is because barrels are a consumable component of a howitzer or tank. Even when steels that are resistant to high heat and pressure are used, and a chrome lining is added to the bore interior, the use of a barrel will degrade its structural integrity to the point where it must be replaced. This means that a country’s ability to meet its needs for barrel replacement in a high-intensity war is critical to its ability to continue the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of failing to replace barrels is demonstrated by a report from an operator of a 203 mm 2S7 howitzer in Ukraine: “The gun was fired a lot in one day and overheated. It was performing poorly, and we weren’t sure where the shells landed. There are no replacement barrels, so we might be transferred to the 2S1 [a Soviet-era howitzer]”. This indicates not only that the gun was less accurate and effective because of barrel wear, but that the crew could be transferred to a shorter-range and less lethal system if a replacement could not be found. This is why disrupting barrel production is likely to have a greater impact on the battlefield than disrupting the production of armour or refurbishment of engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian artillery barrel manufacturers are under state control because of their strategic importance. Historically there were many barrel manufacturers in Russia, but there are now just four: Zavod No. 9 in Yekaterinburg; Titan-Barrikady in Volgograd; MZ/SKB in Perm; and the Burevestnik Research Institute in Nizhny Novgorod. The latter is the country’s main artillery research and development facility; its research and production facilities are responsible for developing artillery systems and their production processes, so these facilities are equipped with trial production capacity. There is also the main assembly plant, Uraltransmash, which has its own casting and forging facility, but this is primarily the systems integrator in Russia’s artillery supply chain, and reports deliveries from Zavod No. 9 and Titan-Barrikady, indicating that it is not currently a significant source of barrel production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RAW MATERIALS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metallurgy plants manufacture the steel for artillery barrels in dedicated production runs, allocating resources specifically for producing barrel moulds. The output ranges from 20 to 10 tonnes per mould, depending on the order size and forge capacity. The process begins with casting a steel bar – known as ingots – that will eventually become a barrel. The base materials needed to make the alloy – iron ore, scrap metal and small amounts of molybdenum, chromium or nickel – are melted in a blast furnace for up to 12 hours. An alternate process uses an electric arc furnace, which primarily relies on electricity and scrap metal, as well as ferroalloys, which are created by reducing metal elements in a submerged electric arc furnace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The molten steel is treated to remove excess carbon before it is poured into moulds. The ingots may be subject to further treatments such as annealing, which removes impurities, and acid baths to remove forge scale from the surface. The steel will be rolled into its final shape before being cut to size and transported to the customer by rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several metallurgy plants have been identified as suppliers to the UralVagonZavod group of companies. Most of the sources are pre-2022 registers of public procurement and contracts, as this information is no longer disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raw Materials In-Depth: Chromium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research indicates that Russia’s artillery supply chain is exposed and vulnerable in its need for foreign sources of high-quality chrome ore to sustain its barrel production. Much of this material is sourced from outside Russia, and so it should be feasible to disrupt its delivery through the focused use of sanctions and by adjusting existing sanctions legislation and export control regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is self-sufficient to a significant degree in the raw materials required for barrel production. There is, however, evidence to suggest that Russia requires substantial imports of chromium ore to produce pure chromium, which is used for chrome-plating barrels. This is a process whereby the interior of the barrel bore is coated with a layer of chrome between 50 and 180 microns thick. This thin layer of chrome protects the bore from the corrosive effects of firing. Shooting can damage the barrel. Regular maintenance, such as cleaning and lubrication, helps manage this wear. The chrome coating makes maintenance easier and reduces the harmful effects of shooting. Chromium is also used to alloy the steel used to produce artillery barrels, which makes it an important raw material for the overall barrel supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chromium is valued for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. It can be processed into different types of compounds, such as oxides and ferrochromium, which are used to harden steel, manufacture stainless steel or make anti-corrosion coatings. Chrome ore (chromite) tends to be quite accessible and is primarily extracted using open-pit mining. The extracted ore is mainly used to produce an alloy of iron and chromium called ferrochromium, or to process the ore into pure chromium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia produces between 1.5 and 2 million tonnes of chrome ore per year from the Saranovo Rudnaya mine and in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. Russia’s demand for chromium is around 1.47 million tonnes per year, with a growth trend to 1.6 million tonnes by 2025 and 1.73 million tonnes by 2030. About 55.2% of this consumption is covered by imports, despite Russia technically producing enough by weight to meet its needs, because Russian ore has a lower chromium content. For example, deposits in the Polar Urals or the Perm region are characterised by a chromium content of 38% and 37% respectively. Typically, ore with a chromium content in excess of 45%, along with a low ratio of impurities like aluminium and silicon, is required for metallurgic uses. Russia is also understood to have a state reserve system that may include chromium as a strategic raw material, which means that a disruption to chromium supply could lead it to rely on this reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Russia’s ore being generally of insufficient quality for gun barrels and pure chromium, the country’s reserves are underdeveloped. Russia technically sits on 52.4 million tonnes of chrome ore, around 2% of the world’s global reserves, however it has only initiated development of 13% of those reserves. As a result, it is forced to import large quantities of raw materials to meet its chromium needs – for pure chromium in particular. Krasny Oktyabr’s relationship with the Aktobe Ferroalloy Plant in Kazakhstan, which manufactures artillery barrels, reinforces this conclusion. The two entities have no public relationship, but commercial trade data reveals that the Aktobe Ferroalloy Plant delivered more than 4,000 tonnes of high carbon ferrochrome, worth approximately $9 million, to Krasny Oktyabr between March and May 2024. As transactions between Russia and Kazakhstan are not normally recorded, it is possible that this relationship has existed for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chromite has the harmonised system (HS) code of 2610, which is used to monitor trade between countries. Data for 2023 indicates that Russia imported around $36.7 million worth of products under this HS code. Russia’s imports for 2023 and January to May 2024 show that most chromium-containing goods – $29.9 million – originated from South Africa, but that the majority of South African ore was exported to Russia via European countries, including $17.9 million from the Netherlands. Export data for Kazakhstan is not included in this analysis, as Kazakhstan and Russia are both members of the Eurasian Customs Union, which lacks detailed records on their mutual trade. In 2021, Kazakhstan was the primary supplier of chromium to Russia, accounting for 86.8% of imports. Although supplies from Kazakhstan have significantly decreased since 2022, it is likely that Kazakhstan remains a major supplier of chromium-containing goods to Russia. Information on other countries of interest, along with the dollar value of those supplies, are provided in Table 2 below. The available data for 2024 paints a markedly different picture, with less than $1 million in chromium-containing imports between January and May. This may indicate that Russia’s imports have reduced because of sanctions, or that Russia has limited the data made available on its imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/goX7Kgp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Countries of Interest (the US and EU Members) Involved in Supply of Chromium-Containing Goods to Russia in 2023.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Trade data supplied by third-party commercial provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies involved in extracting and processing chromite and exporting it to Russia, along with the dollar value of those exports in 2023, are provided in Table 3. The top three are mining companies which both extracted and exported chromium ore to Russia. The others are mainly involved either in processing chromium ore into various chromium compounds or reselling raw material. Of course, not all these imports are destined for Russia’s artillery supply chain; its oil and gas industry are significant consumers of chromite, too. However, there are five chromite importers in Russia with historical ties to the defence industry: Polema; Vladmettsentr; Industrial Systems; CTK Euro; and EK Resources. These companies imported $6,758,000 worth of chrome products across five different HS codes in 2023. EK Resources was responsible for importing $3,485,000 worth of products under HS code 2610 (through EK-Company AG “EKC.AG” as a supplier), indicating that it is potentially a key link in the supply of chromite imported to be processed into pure chromium for the lining of barrels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/K5RK4dd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3: The 10 Largest Suppliers Involved in the Chromite Supply Chain.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Trade data supplied by third-party commercial provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many methods of processing chromite to produce pure chromium. The most common is the aluminothermic method, which produces metals and alloys by reducing their oxides through a chemical reaction with aluminium. The largest producer of pure chromium in Russia is the powder chemicals plant Polema. Between 2015 and 2018, Polema made 100 deliveries of pure chromium compounds and other components to Russian military plants worth $6.4 million. In the first half of 2023, Polema had $928,000 in transactions with the Imperial Tula Arms Plant alone, which makes components for the 152 mm 2K25 Krasnopol guided munitions, as well as many other defence-related components. Polema also registered $134,000 in transactions with the Perm Machine Building Plant, as well as small orders with other Russian defence manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, while disruptions to imports of chromite may be difficult, they are not impossible, especially given the increasing scrutiny on supply chains and continued sanctions pressure by the US, particularly via banks. Though Russia’s access to alternative suppliers like Turkey and India is a potential safeguard, the logistical complexities and the potential for sanctions to extend to those channels should not be underestimated. Thus, while chromium supply may not pose an immediate crisis, it remains a point of strategic vulnerability, especially in prolonged conflict scenarios where access to diverse and stable sources of critical materials becomes increasingly important. As with the majority of sanctions, the initial impact is likely to be indirect, and manifest itself in logistics and time costs, which does not defeat the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manufacturing-process&quot;&gt;Manufacturing Process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raw materials for an artillery barrel are cast, rolled, and forged in several steel plants traditionally specialising in artillery-grade alloys. Further processing involves cutting, drilling the bore, polishing, and assembly with other elements (such as the breech and recuperator) into a barrel module ready for the assembly plant. The first stage is done by plants with special steel processing capacity, such as Krasny Oktyabr and MMK. The barrel module manufacturers buy steel blanks from these suppliers and process them into finished barrels and fully assembled artillery parts ready to be installed onto the appropriate system. There are two primary methodologies for producing large-calibre artillery barrels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first primary methodology is radial or rotary forging. In this method, a steel blank that is shorter than the total length required is drilled and heated, before being inserted into a radial forging machine. The machine inserts a mandrel inside the blank, which can carry the rifling in the case of howitzer barrels, and the blank is passed through four hammers that operate at a very high speed and pressure to shape the steel around the mandrel. This process hardens and stretches the steel and forms it into shape in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result will be precise, and close to the profile of the finished part. Machine tools can either be manually operated – that is, without a CNC – or automated with a CNC. Automated radial forging machines are much more precise, as they allow for the selection of the forging angle, forging diameter, and pressure. It is noteworthy that the Soviet Union also imported its barrel-forging equipment from the West: a CIA report from 1982 covers the procurement of 26 automated rotary forges from Austrian company Gesellschaft fuer Fertigungstechnik und Maschinenbau (GFM). One machine, an SXP 55, was installed at a Perm factory in 1975 and provided the capacity to produce artillery barrels up to 203 mm in calibre. The CIA estimated that a large-calibre barrel could be forged using this technology in two to 10 minutes, and that the USSR had procured sufficient spares for 15 years of operations. The same report estimated that the Soviets could produce 14,000 barrels per year, although this only relates to the production of unfinished barrels. Rotary forging machines have a number of civil applications as well as military outputs, and it is possible that many of these GFM machines were imported for civil production, although Russia’s mobilisation laws do allow for the transfer of capacity and machinery from civil to military production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second primary methodology of barrel production is for the blank to be shaped externally before the bore is drilled using a type of machine tool that holds the blank in place as a channel is drilled through the blank from one end to the other. The drill is fed a constant supply of a lubricant that is designed to remove debris and cool the metal and drill. This process may take place in two stages, with course drilling followed by fine drilling. It can take 24 hours. Once the barrel is shaped and complete, it is heat treated in a shaft furnace with as many as three barrels that are brought up to temperatures of around 500°C before being cooled in oil. This regularises the grain structure within the barrel and is designed to ensure it is suitably hardened against the stresses of firing. To increase the service life of barrels, the interior of the barrel bore is then coated with chrome between 50 and 180 microns thick, which increases the service life by 2.5–3 times. There are separate processes for the breech and block, which are forged from similar steel to the barrel. Additional components such as a muzzle brake and recuperators are also produced, all using high-quality alloy steels. These components are combined to create a complete barrel that is then painted, tested and inspected before being shipped to one of the manufacturers, which adds the barrel to a howitzer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the production process for a batch of artillery barrels using this methodology can take up to four months, according to the CEO of SKB, which sits within the Motovilikha Plant in Perm. The full process can also include the production of steel blanks, which may take up to five months. This equates to a potential nine-month delivery schedule for batch orders made by the Russian MoD. This provides a fuller indication of barrel production capacity at many of Russia’s plants. Furthermore, barrel-forging machines are shared between calibres, so a rotary forging machine that is used to make a 152 mm howitzer barrel may also be used in the production of 125 mm tank barrels. Only one manufacturer, Zavod No. 9, is understood to have distinct production lines for different calibres. In addition, Russian manufacturers report recycling worn and damaged barrels from the frontline, as well as old Soviet-era barrels. A rotary forge can also be used for this process by reducing a larger calibre barrel to a smaller one. Furthermore, some models, like the 2S5 Giatsint 152 mm howitzers, do not need new barrel production, as a large stock of barrels has been retained from the Soviet era, according to Vyacheslav Tsybulin, the production director at SKB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As barrel production is key to maintaining an effective fighting force, it is useful to assess Russia’s capacity to produce barrels. This is naturally challenging, but there are some data points that provide an indication of Russia’s ability to meet these needs. UralVagonZavod reported the capacity to manufacture 328 armoured vehicles of all types in its 2019 annual report. This was stated to be 64% of the company’s total production capacity, indicating a theoretical maximum of 512 armoured vehicles per year, which in turn suggests the ability to produce 500 barrels of all calibres per year. This would not be sufficient to meet the needs of the war in Ukraine, either those generated by losses of howitzers, or those arising from wear and tear. However, by April 2024, production of self-propelled and towed howitzers had increased by 10 and 14 times respectively, compared with 2022, Bekhan Ozdoev, an industrial director at Rostec, claimed. Given the above, this figure is likely reached through a combination of refurbishing old barrels, matching existing stocks to new howitzers, and new production. If 30% of UralVagonZavod’s production in 2019 was focused on artillery systems, these figures indicate an approximate theoretical production maximum of 1,000 howitzers of all types per year. Within this, it is reasonable to conclude that the focus of forging may have shifted away from tank barrels and towards artillery barrels, which may mean that Russia is able to produce hundreds of new barrels per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRODUCTION IN-DEPTH: MACHINE TOOLS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery barrels are complex metal structures that require large, precise machinery throughout the production process. In this respect, the question of existing production capabilities looms large. Russia is thought to have access to legacy Soviet barrel-manufacturing machines. Also, Russia relies on metalworking machine tools, including CNC machines, offering higher degree of automation and precision that support many parts of the artillery supply chain; they are used in the production of engines, in shaping the shell casings of artillery ammunition, in barrel production and in the production of many other weapons. Russian internal demand for machine tools is partially met by local producers, particularly manufacturers within the military-industrial complex like Kalashnikov and Rostec, which specialize in machinery for military production. Efforts to expand domestic production capabilities are also underway. Still, as of 2024, Russia has limited production capacities for machine tools manufacturing and imported many of its systems from Europe prior to 2022. For example, the Motovilikha Plant announced a contract in 2011 to procure a new radial forging machine from GFM in Austria. The machine was expected to replace the legacy equipment operating at the plant, which indicates that it may have been designed to replace the SPX 55 referenced in the CIA report from the previous section. China became Russia’s main supplier of machine tools after 2022, and was the primary source of CNC radial forging machines that were imported in 2023. It is unclear how all of these machines will be used; however, Russia’s defence industry uses around 70% of all machine tools in Russia. And there is evidence that a portion of them have been used to expand artillery production capacity. At the same time, import was the primary source for meeting the machine tools consumption demands, with 70% of machine tools and 80–90% of spare parts and components coming from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian companies have historically preferred Western machine tools over Chinese equivalents, as they are more precise and higher quality. Russia’s longstanding preference for Western machines and components provided Ukraine’s Western partners with a critical lever of influence on the Russian war machine that was overlooked until late 2023, when a raft of sanctions came into force. Russia had accelerated its imports of machine tools and their control systems from $29.46 million in January 2022, a month before the full-scale invasion, to $120.86 million in July 2023, with most coming from China. As the sanctions came into effect, supplies from nation-states in the Sanctions Coalition Against Russia (the Sanctions Coalition) decreased dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Russia’s demand for machine tools, including with CNC, is increasing. This is due to many different factors. Part of the increase is driven by Russia’s struggle to recruit enough personnel to meet its production needs. The Russian media outlet Izvestia estimated that Russia was short of 4.8 million workers in 2023, and recruitment adverts on the websites of many Russian defence companies point to challenges in expanding production. Machine tools, especially those with CNC, allow fewer personnel to perform a given role – albeit personnel with a higher level of training. Moreover, as of 2023, 63–65% of capital equipment in the defence and related industries was worn out or approaching the end of its service life. Finally, Russia is expanding its ammunition and artillery production capacity, as well as its production of drones and all the materials of war, which drives the need for additional machine tools. Russia’s domestic machine tool-building industry cannot meet this demand; it produced 9,269 machine tools in 2023, up from 7,221 in 2022. At the same time, imports of processing machine tools for various materials, including metal, for the same period are understood to have exceeded 60,000 units, indicating the extent of Russia’s import dependency. To meet this need, Russia has turned to China, which is becoming a key supplier of goods and technologies critical to Russia’s military-industrial complex using the following three mechanisms, explored in more detail below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Re-export of machine tools manufactured by countries from the Sanctions Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supply of machine tools manufactured at Western subsidiary factories located in China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Supply of Chinese machine tools that rely upon Western components, technologies, and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to an analysis of Chinese customs data by the Carnegie Endowment, Beijing exports over $300 million worth of dual-use items to Russia every month. In 2023, China was responsible for approximately 90% of Russia’s imports of goods on the G7’s high-priority export control list. Machine tools exports from China to Russia grew 10-fold from $6.5 million in February 2022 to $68 million in July 2023, representing 57% of Russia’s imports of machine tools, up from 12% before the invasion. Pavel Luzin, an expert on the Russian defence industry, has assessed that China’s share of Russian imports of machine tool parts grew to 32% in 2022, compared to pre-invasion period, and to at least 80–90% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis indicates that there are avenues for disrupting Russia’s artillery supply chain through targeted sanctions and diplomatic pressure to restrict the supply of quality machine tools. As of August 2024, a minority of the Chinese machine tool manufacturers that are among Russia’s critical suppliers were sanctioned by any member of the Sanctions Coalition. This gap in the international sanctions regime allows Chinese companies to export and re-export machine tools, including with CNC, to Russia without consequences, to manufacture Western machine tools under licence and to build critical Western technology into machines that would be far less capable without them. Many of these machines are then used to build weapons to fight Ukraine and threaten the West with nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China as a Re-Export Hub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China serves as a re-export hub for machine tools (including with CNC) manufactured in Western countries and Sanctions Coalition states. The following supply chain assessment is based on Russia’s imports under 18 HS codes corresponding to machine tool products, and originating from 10 Western countries with active machine tools production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data indicates that at least 2,113 companies supplied machine tools manufactured in Western countries to Russia during 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Among these suppliers, Chinese entities rank second (340 companies, or 17.5%), behind only Turkey (508 companies, or 26.16%). The rest of the suppliers originate from Germany (8.50%), South Korea (6.75%), Taiwan (6.08%), Italy (5.92%), the UAE (4.63%), Lithuania (2.47%) and Serbia (2.21%). The total value of Russia’s machine imports over the same time period was $4.5 billion. Chinese companies accounted for $568.6 million or 12.6% of the total during 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Chinese entities are increasingly facilitating the re-export of machine tools and equipment to Russia from neighbouring countries. For instance, Chinese entities account for 41% of entities re-exporting Japanese machine tools products to Russia, 26% of those re-exporting Taiwanese machine tools, and 19% of those re-exporting South Korean machine tools. There are 36 Chinese companies among the top suppliers of Western machines to Russia for 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Only five of those companies have been sanctioned by members of the Sanctions Coalition – one by the US, the EU and Switzerland (Shenzhen Biguang Trading Co. LTD), three just by the US (Silver Technology LTD, Most Development LTD, Agu Information Technology Co. LTD), and one just by the EU (Afox Corporation LTD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the Chinese companies Agu Information Technology (AIT) and Yinuo Supply Chain Management (YSCM) were established in April and August 2022, respectively, shortly after the full-scale invasion. From the start of 2023 to the end of the first quarter of 2024, they exported $75 million worth of US and Taiwanese machines, including with CNC, to Russia, and both supplied machines to importers close to the Russian defence industry. AIT’s largest client was the Russian company Vneshekostil, which has been under US blocking sanctions since September 2023. YSCM became a supplier to the Russian company known as LLC Energy Industries. According to public procurement registers and financial data available to the authors, the latter has cooperated with Russian defence enterprises including Admiralty Shipyards, the largest Russian manufacturer of diesel-electric submarines, and Elektrokhimpribor Combine, a nuclear weapons company, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yemjYYe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5: Chinese Subsidiaries of Western Companies with Sales to Russia Exceeding $800,000 for 2023 – Q1 2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Trade data supplied by third-party commercial provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Western Subsidiaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dimension of Chinese support for Russia’s need for critical equipment is the supply of products manufactured at Western companies’ subsidiaries in China. An analysis of 30 Western brands that make up the main machine tools manufacturers indicates that 22 of them have direct subsidiaries registered in China (see Table 5). This study only examined subsidiaries that have their production facilities in China; it excludes those that only provide technical support, training or sales functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these machines are not exported to Russia directly by the Chinese subsidiaries, but via Chinese intermediaries. The case of the US company Hardinge illustrates a typical supply chain. In 1996, the company established a wholly owned subsidiary in Shanghai, Hardinge Machine Tool (Shanghai), which also serves as its demonstration, training and maintenance centre in China. The company’s largest production site in China is the Hardinge Jiaxing factory, established in 2010. This factory manufactured three vertical CNC machines worth $701,000 in 2023 that were delivered to Russia via Chinese distributor Beijing Zhuangguan International Import &amp;amp; Export Trade Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian importer of Hardinge’s equipment was Technoproekt, a research and production company specialising in development and production of pipeline valves for the gas, oil, and nuclear industries. Technoproekt is not subject to international sanctions despite having open state contracts to supply machine tools and fittings to Russian military-industrial enterprises such as the Electrokhimpribor Combine, which manufactures components for nuclear warheads. While Technoproekt could be using Hardinge’s machinery to produce valves for the gas industry, it could also be shipping those machines onwards to a key entity in Russia’s nuclear deterrent. There are at least 12 other Chinese entities that supplied CNC machine tools produced by Western subsidiaries to Russia in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Machine Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also evidence to suggest that the expansion of Russia’s defence industry is enabled by Chinese machine tools, including with CNC. For example, the Russian Izhevsk Unmanned Systems Research and Production Association, which manufactures Granat and Takhion reconnaissance drones that are used in Ukraine, recently announced that it had increased its production output. Russian media reported that the company had commissioned a new 5,800 m2 production shop complete with newly installed CNC machines and an increased number of machining centres. Then, in March 2024, a CNC machine produced by Chinese Dalian Machine Tool Group was observed at the new facility. Another Russian defence plant, NPO Kurganpribor – which manufactures components for land and naval artillery, as well as fuzes for tank rounds and rocket launchers, among many other products – opened a new 1,500 m2 production site with dozens of new CNC machines in August 2024. The manufacturers that can be identified include Zhe Jiang Headman Machinery and Shandong Weida Heavy Industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supply of Chinese machine tools with CNC to Russian defence plants is not straightforward, because Western states are critical suppliers of hardware that is essential for their production and use. For example, vital control instruments such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and distributed control systems (DCSs) usually come from non-Chinese companies, which hold nearly 100% of the small and medium/large PLC markets and 65% of the DCS market. This means that Russia is dependent on Western technology for its machine tools, and China is too. China’s reliance upon Western companies is further evidenced by the fact that of 10–16 Chinese manufacturers supplying the Russian market, at least 13 have confirmed connections with Western markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;refurbishment&quot;&gt;Refurbishment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia launched an extensive modernisation of its armed forces leading up to the invasion of Ukraine, concentrating much of its newest equipment in its better-trained and professionalised units. However, the losses incurred during the invasion, as well as the need to stand up additional units to fight the war, has exhausted Russia’s stocks of new systems. There was a huge effort to refurbish old howitzers that had been kept in storage from the Soviet era, with the result that up to 80% of Russia’s armoured fighting vehicles are now refurbished. The degree of refurbishment required depends upon the conditions that the vehicles have been stored in, and for how long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is understood that as of 2024, all new model production and repair is concentrated in Uraltransmash, while most repair and refurbishment of legacy models is conducted at Russia’s armoured vehicle repair plants and the Motovilikha Plant. The number of these facilities is unknown: they received their numbered names during the Second World War and some, if not most, were transferred to Rostec in the 2000s, which closed many that were not solvent. Below, six of the main armoured-vehicle plants are examined in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. 103: One of the main armoured-vehicle repair plants is No. 103 in Atamanovka (Transbaikal region). This plant is the key military facility in the easternmost regions of Russia and is directly on the Trans-Siberian railway linking the European part of Russia and the Pacific coast, with a rail connection allowing the plant to load vehicles directly onto freight carriages. Satellite images reveal the plant has parking space for more than 1,000 vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. 560: There is at least one more armoured-machine repair plant operating in Siberia – the Vozhaevka-based armoured-vehicle repair plant No. 560, which is visibly smaller than No. 103.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. 81: Much closer to the frontline is Armoured Vehicle Repair Plant No. 81 in Armavir, some 200 km from the official Russian-Ukrainian border, in the Donbas area.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. 61: Armoured Vehicle Repair Plant No. 61 is owned by UralVagonZavod in the St Petersburg region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. 163: Armoured Vehicle Repair Plant No. 163 is located in the Krasnodar region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No. 144: Armoured Vehicle Repair Plant No. 144 in Yekaterinburg (close to Zavod No. 9 and Uraltransmash) has been contracted by the Russian MoD for upgrades of BMDs and 2S9 self-propelled mortars to 2S9-1.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these plants were advertising for additional staff at the time of writing, with an emphasis on CNC operators and technical engineers, indicating the rapid expansion of these facilities. The majority of identified armoured-machine repair plants are involved in repair and overhaul of direct fire armoured fighting vehicles like tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. The 39th Arsenal in Perm is believed to be one of the only armoured-machine repair plants specialised in refurbishing artillery in the country. The property, including the land and buildings, had been acquired by a private entrepreneur following asset liquidation in 2021, but the liquidation was halted in the Russian courts in 2023. The case for doing so was based on the strategic importance of the plant. The current status of the plant and its equipment is unknown, but it is possible that it and its infrastructure – like the tracks that carry vehicles to and from the plant – have fallen into disrepair. It is understood that ad hoc facilities have been established closer to Ukraine for the repair of artillery systems, including regular maintenance like the replacement of barrels. However, this type of facility is unlikely to be capable of returning stored howitzers to a combat-fit state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has a lot of equipment waiting for refurbishment; one assessment indicates that Russia had at least 10 storage bases, 12 artillery storage bases and 37 mixed equipment storage bases. For reference, one storage base – the 591st artillery warehouse in the Novgorod Region – was home to at least 400 howitzers in 2018. This indicates that Russia may have thousands of howitzers sitting in storage. The refurbishment of equipment has been accompanied by what appears to be a significant effort to stand up or restore armoured-machine and artillery repair plants closer to Ukraine. The majority of those that were functional in 2022 were in the Urals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Russian news outlets indicate that orders were given to establish facilities closer to Ukraine in late 2022. This suggests that Russia has established or will establish facilities designed to repair vehicles and artillery damaged in Ukraine and return it to the front line as quickly as possible. However, if the facilities to refurbish howitzers are specific to those vehicles, and have been allowed to atrophy, it is logical that artillery manufacturers like Uraltransmash and Motovilikha Plant would currently be responsible for refurbishing artillery stockpiles as well as manufacturing or overhauling new, more capable systems like the Msta-SM2 and 2S35 Koalitsiya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-4-ammunition-supply-chains&quot;&gt;Chapter 4: Ammunition Supply Chains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has an anticipated need for four million 152 mm artillery rounds and 1.6 million 122 mm rounds for offensive operations in 2025. The Russian defence industry can manufacture around 1.3 million 152 mm rounds and 800,000 122 mm rounds per year, so many of the required rounds will have to be procured from abroad or refurbished from legacy stockpiles. Russia has been refurbishing artillery ammunition and missiles at least since 2018, when Putin indicated that 550,000 rounds of ammunition and missiles had been refurbished and returned to service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manufacturers-1&quot;&gt;Manufacturers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s artillery ammunition manufacturers sit on top of a supply chain that is largely domestic, but some key resources are procured from abroad. There are three primary manufacturers of artillery ammunition in Russia: NIMI Bakhirev, the Plastmass Plant and KBP Shipunov. NIMI Bakhirev appears to perform as a contractor for the Russian MoD and control deliveries from companies like Plastmass and the Kazan Gunpowder Plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NIMI BAKHIREV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State Scientific Research Institute of Machine Building Bakhirev (NIMI Bakhirev) is Russia’s oldest and most prominent developer of artillery and tank ammunition. Like most of Russia’s artillery supply chain, it sits within the Tekhmash holding, part of Rostec. The available tax data indicates that it delivered goods worth around $1.7 billion to the Russian MoD in the first half of 2023. NIMI Bakhirev is Moscow-based and doesn’t have any known production facilities, which leads to the conclusion that it acts as an R&amp;amp;D, procurement and supervising entity on behalf of the Russian MoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIMI Bakhirev is understood to produce a range of 125 mm ammunition that is used by tanks, as well as 152 mm rounds for artillery. Since the invasion of Ukraine, the plant has made efforts to restart production of 122 mm ammunition and to upgrade and modernise the 100 mm ammunition used by the BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLASTMASS PLANT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plastmass Plant is also a subsidiary of Tekhmash and a producer of 76–152 mm artillery ammunition. Its product portfolio includes the 3VOF58 152 mm round, which is the designation given to the 3OF45 high explosive projectile, and a variable charge, designed to be fired by the 2A65 Msta-B towed howitzer and the 2S19 Msta-S self-propelled howitzer. It also manufactures 3VOF39 152 mm rounds with 3OF29 high explosive shells and charges for the towed 2A36 Giatsint-B and 2S5 Giatsint SPH. Collectively, these four howitzers represent the longest-range systems chambered to fire 152 mm shells that are available to Russian forces in Ukraine. Plastmass produces a range of other warheads that are used in missiles and rockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INSTRUMENT DESIGN BUREAU&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instrument Design Bureau (KBP) is the second-largest supplier to the Russian MoD by value, with more than $895 million in sales for the first quarter of 2023. Its parent company is the High Precision Systems Holding, which sits within Rostec. KBP develops precision-guided weapons and air defence systems as well as automatic cannons. This includes the Kornet ATGM and Pantsir-S short-range air defence system, with deliveries of the former reported in June 2023. Additionally, KBP manufactures and develops the 2K25 Krasnopol laser-guided artillery round. In August 2023, KBP started supplying the Russian army with upgraded Krasnopol rounds that can be guided onto a target by a laser designation from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The enterprise has also been working on increasing the efficiency of its laser-guided KM-8 Gran bomb for 120 mm mortars and Kitolov-2M artillery shells for D-30 and 2S1 artillery systems. Laser-guided rounds are important to Russia’s artillery war, as the extreme dispersion adopted by Ukrainian forces reduces the efficacy of massed artillery barrages. More precise fires are therefore used against singular targets and individual howitzers when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRODUCTION IN-DEPTH: PLASTMASS PLANT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OjRnrxd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 8: The Plastmass Plant.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Airbus Defence and Space, RUSI, Open Source Centre.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plastmass is an important element of the Russian artillery supply chain, located in Kopeysk in Chelyabinsk region. The following analysis indicates that the plant is responsible for at least 15% of Russia’s projected 152 mm round production in 2024. The plant is owned by Rostec and has focused on ammunition for artillery, tanks and aviation. It specialises in the assembly and refurbishment of shells and rounds for 120 mm and 152 mm howitzers, and has supplied the Russian army with ammunition for all of its primary indirect fire systems. It produces the S-8 series of 80 mm unguided rockets that are fired from Russian helicopters in a ground attack role, as well as 125 mm explosive ammunition natures for tanks. This product suite is indicative of the plant’s role in supporting Russia’s war effort, and, while it is by no means the only plant producing ammunition for the armed forces, it is one of the few that only produces ammunition, and for which there is sales data to indicate volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant part of the plant’s production is commissioned by ammunition developer NIMI Bakhirev, which in turn is subcontracted by the Russian MoD. The Plastmass Plant reportedly made $143 million in payments to NIMI Bakhirev and $232 million to the Russian MoD in 2023. In addition, publicly available arbitration records confirm that prior to 2022, the entity was subcontracted by NIMI Bakhirev to fill artillery shells with explosive materials under contracts issued by the MoD or Rosoboronexport, Russia’s defence export agency. The total value of these orders is $375 million – far less than the Instrument Design Bureau, which has close to $1 billion. However, as Plastmass is primarily involved in ammunition production, while KBP has a range of business lines, the volume of production at Plastmass and the possible impact of disrupting its operations can be more accurately discerned. A 152 mm artillery round is thought to cost around $700, suggesting that Plastmass could be contracted to produce 535,000 rounds of 152 mm ammunition for the $375 million that it has received from the Russian MoD. While this figure is unlikely to be precise, given Plastmass’ range of products, it indicates the potential impact of disrupting this manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of early 2022, the Plastmass Plant operated 38 production facilities, repair shops and workshops with a total area of 33,005 m2, as well as 78 warehouse facilities with a total area of 37,200 m2. In 2013, it had seven main structural subdivisions, including Workshop No. 4, which focused on ammunition production, with a stated output of 50,000 units per year with a “military” purpose – Plastmass has other business arms, including the production of explosives for industrial use. In September 2021, Rostec announced plans to launch a new assembly facility for 100–152 mm ammunition, with an area of approximately 4,000 m2 by 2023. The facility was to employ automated technologies worth RUB 250 million (~ $3.4 million) and increase the plant’s output by 150%. The most recent publicly available video showing the plant’s premises is from March 2022; it includes footage of a new industrial boiler room and older-looking ammunition assembly facilities. Nevertheless, Rostec announced in June 2024 that Plastmass had increased its military-use production five-fold since the start of the invasion, and planned to increase production volumes by another 20% in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growth in capacity is confirmed by the plant’s recruitment of new personnel, particularly assemblers of munitions for three shifts per day. The plant started posting monthly job adverts on the VK social media platform in June 2022 seeking ammunition assemblers, electricians and other technical roles. The salary offered for ammunition assemblers grew from a minimum of RUB 19,000 (~ $351) per month in June 2022 to a minimum of RUB 85,000 (~ $964) by July 2024. As of 24 July 2024, the plant had 134 vacancies for ammunition assembler positions on the Federal Service for Labour and Employment vacancies website, accounting for more than 20% of the plant’s active vacancies. The sharp increase in salaries and large number of vacancies for this unskilled position may indicate that the plant is struggling to find enough workers to meet the demands of its expanded capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is rare for any ammunition manufacturer to reveal production figures, but it is possible to form an assessment of Plastmass’ output using the available data. If, for example, the production figure for 2013 of 50,000 units is accurate and remained constant until the invasion, the increases announced by Rostec indicate that Plastmass will be able to produce 300,000 units by the end of 2024. Taken together with data seen for this report, it can be reasonably concluded that the annual production output of Plastmass is at least 300,000 units of all ammunition types per year, and may be as high as 535,000 if it focuses on 152 mm natures alone. However, the plant’s activities include refurbishing old ammunition, which is likely cheaper and faster than producing new ammunition, as well as the production of munitions that are more advanced and therefore likely more expensive than a traditional 152 mm round. This could lower or increase the total output of the plant. In addition, Russia is understood to have sacrificed production capacity for many of its non-artillery ammunition natures in 2022 and 2023 to meet its need for 152 mm and 122 mm rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the plant’s artillery ammunition output is therefore challenging, but it appears likely that the plant could produce at least 200,000 rounds of artillery ammunition per year through production and refurbishment, alongside production of tank and rocket ammunition. This figure could be increased by tens or hundreds of thousands of rounds if all other production was sacrificed to focus on artillery natures. As Russia is projected to produce 1.3 million rounds of 152 mm ammunition in 2024, Plastmass may be responsible for more than 15% of the country’s output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course depends upon the ability of the plant’s supply chain to meet its needs for raw materials and products. The available data indicates that the supply chain is heavily concentrated; the plant was reliant on six suppliers for more than 95% of its purchases in terms of value, which were in excess of $179 million in 2023. More than 60% of its transactions by value were with the Selmash Plant, which manufactures shell bodies for 152 mm ammunition as well as S-8 rockets. This plant has been expanding production capacity by refurbishing old buildings and modernising its existing machinery, and is working “24/7 in support of the SVO [special military operation]”, according to the director general. Plastmass’ suppliers are set out in Table 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iPOdh2e.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These supply chain dependencies can become vulnerabilities. The largest dependency is Plastmass’ relationship with Selmash; there are other manufacturers of shell bodies within the ammunition supply chain, but they are supplying other producers. It is not clear that an alternative to Selmash could be found if it were unable to supply Plastmass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the expansion of the plant and recruitment of staff may be limiting production capacity. These supply chain dependencies can become vulnerabilities.

&lt;h4 id=&quot;raw-materials&quot;&gt;Raw Materials&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raw materials involved in producing artillery ammunition begin with the iron ore that is used to make the shell casing. A shell casing is typically made from steel, and it is designed to be strong enough to withstand the forces of firing from a howitzer, but brittle enough to shatter into small fragments when the explosive inside detonates. In the Russian supply chain, propellent is stored and transported in brass cases that are loaded into the howitzer behind the shell and detonated to fire the round. This adds zinc and copper to the supply chain. The propellent itself is produced from cotton cellulose or cotton pulp and nitric acid, as well as some alcohols. Cotton pulp is produced by harvesting cotton linter and treating it with chemicals like sodium hydroxide that break down the other fibres, leaving only the cellulose, which is then purified and refined to the appropriate length. The resultant material is dried and formed into bales for transport. The final element to consider is the explosive inside the shell, which is typically a variant of Royal Demolition Explosive (RDX), which may also be known as hexogen or cyclonite. RDX is made from the nitrolysis of hexamine, which is produced by combining formaldehyde and ammonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raw materials needed for Russia’s artillery ammunition are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ammonia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Aluminium.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nitric acid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cotton pulp.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sodium hydroxide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Iron ore.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alloy components.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copper.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Zinc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies active in the supply of raw materials into Russia’s artillery ammunition supply chain are shown in Table 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/204RcO2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RAW MATERIALS IN-DEPTH: NITROCELLULOSE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charge in an artillery round charge is made of nitrocellulose, making this a key material for artillery production. Russian propellant plants are critically dependent on imports of cotton cellulose, the base material of nitrocellulose, as Russia currently has no domestic capacity for its production. Attempts to grow cotton domestically or develop alternatives to cotton cellulose from wood or flax have so far been futile. The raw materials are often imported, leaving them open to Western interventions to disrupt Russia’s access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan have been the main exporters of the base material for cotton cellulose. Russia and Uzbekistan have remained particularly close following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as indicated by a joint statement released during Russian President Vladimir Putin’s three-day state visit in Tashkent in the end of May 2024 announcing that the two countries would continue “paying attention to cooperation in the defence sphere”. Under an agreement between Uzbekistan’s State Defence Industry and the Kazan Gunpowder Plant in 2020, Russia even agreed to set up licensed powder production in Uzbekistan in exchange for supplies of propellant powders in 2021. Official statistics indicate that Russia’s largest supplier of cotton pulp is currently Uzbekistan, whose exports of the material to Russia doubled in 2022, to $9.4 million. One report indicates that Uzbekistan sold more than 4.8 million kilograms of cotton pulp to Russia in the first nine months of 2023. The majority of shipments were received by Russian entities, which appear as suppliers of all major propellant plants, including Perm, Kazan and Solikamsk. Most of these intermediaries were designated by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZzFBrtg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to commercial trade databases, 85% of Uzbek cotton cellulose exports to Russia in 2023 came from just two manufacturers Fargona Kimyo Zavodi and Raw Materials Cellulose. The two entities are interlinked through their beneficial owners and appear to be ultimately controlled by Rustam Muminov, who has owned several companies in Russia, including LLC TD Khimsnabsbyt, which used to be a direct supplier to the Kazan Gunpowder Plant and was the largest Russian importer of cotton cellulose prior to the invasion of Ukraine. Muminov is currently building a factory in Russia for hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), a cotton cellulose derivative with civilian uses. It will also have the capacity to produce cotton cellulose, and so could contribute to the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customs records show that the Kazan Gunpowder Plant – which manufactures propellant and explosives for artillery ammunition – imported over $2.2 million of cotton pulp from Fargona Kimyo Zavodi between March 2022 and January 2023. The plant also appears to have transacted with at least three other Russian companies – Lenakhim, the Bina Group, and Khimtreid – which imported significant amounts of Uzbek cotton pulp. In total, the four companies imported over $3.5 million in 2022 and almost $7 million in 2023. Meanwhile, the Perm Gunpowder Plant has not reported any imports, and has relied on Lenakhim and the Bina Group (with which it had contracts) to supply Uzbek cotton pulp. These transactions are shown in Figure 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US-sanctioned Lenakhim is the largest Russian importer of cotton pulp, procuring over $8 million-worth from 2019 to 2023. The company received payments from the Kazan and Perm plants in early 2023 and has been fulfilling contracts for both since at least 2016 and 2013, respectively. Its annual imports of cotton pulp sat below $700,000 between 2019 and 2021, but in 2022 and 2023, the company imported over $7 million in cotton pulp from Fargona Kimyo Zavodi and Raw Materials Cellulose LLC, which supplied over $4.4 million. Uzbek customs data shows that Fargona Kimyo Zavodi supplied a further $600,000 of cotton pulp to Lenakhim in January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other importers of cotton pulp include Kazan-based Khimtreid, a chemical products wholesaler that imported just under $200,000 of cotton pulp from Fargona Kimyo Zavodi in September 2023, Bina Group, a large Russian chemicals company which received payments from Kazan and fulfilled contracts with Perm and other Russian defence companies. Both Khimtreid and Bina Group were sanctioned by the US in May 2024. The latter company has been importing large volumes of chemicals and precursors since 2020, and in 2023, it imported $1 million of cotton pulp from Fargona Kimyo Zavodi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some evidence that sanctions and diplomatic pressure have successfully disrupted the nitrocellulose supply chain. The Kazakhstan-based Khlopkoprom-Tsellyuloza used to be one of the largest cotton cellulose suppliers of Russian propellant plants, but as of July 2023, when the Kazan and Aleksin propellant plants were designated by OFAC, Kazakhstan has drastically decreased its total exports of cotton cellulose, sending a total of 115 tonnes, worth $232,959 to Russia, between July and October 2023, and then ostensibly ceasing its shipments altogether. Instead, commercial trade data reveals that since March 2024, the entity has delivered 8,585 metric tonnes of cotton cellulose, worth nearly $17 million, to one single customer: US Department of State contractor, Bizzell Corporation. Bizzell is reportedly engaged in the production of large-calibre artillery ammunition in Europe for NATO partners. This is indicative of the positive effect that focused sanctions and political effort can have in denying critical materials to an opponent, while also benefiting a country’s own defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;processing&quot;&gt;Processing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raw materials are processed into core products that are then turned into projectiles and propellant. The product that becomes the outer shell of each projectile is a steel rod that is forged and stamped into a cylinder with a cavity in the middle. The outside of the shell is shaped with a machine tool, and a thread for the fuse is cut into the cone-shaped nose of the projectile. The projectile is heat-treated and cooled. A copper band is added to the outside of the shell, which is known as a driving band; it is designed to be softer than the steel of the shell so that the metal grooves of the rifling inside the howitzer barrel bite into it. This creates a more effective seal to ensure most of the gases produced by the propellant are directed into the shell and serves to impart spin to the projectile once it leaves the barrel, which stabilises it and improves accuracy. The shell is designed to be thick and strong enough through heat treatment to withstand the pressures of being fired from a howitzer, but not so thick that it will not fragment upon detonation. Further work is carried out to remove excess metal and prepare the round to receive a fuse, and the outer surface of the shell is polished and painted before it is transferred to a filling plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At another plant, the explosive fill is produced, which, for Russian ammunition, is a compound called A-IX-2, an explosive made from 73% RDX, 23% aluminium and 4% wax, which is called a phlegmatizer. This is added to stabilise the explosive material. RDX is produced through the nitrolysis of hexamine with nitric acid. Hexamine is produced through a chemical reaction that results from formaldehyde and ammonia being mixed in gaseous states. The explosive fill is added through casting or pressing through the opening left for the fuse. This takes place at the filling plant before the shells are made ready for transit. Often this is done by plugging the open nose of the shell, which is used to insert the fuse before firing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, the propellant for the shells is produced from nitrocellulose, which is produced by nitrating cotton cellulose with nitric and sulfuric acid under temperature-controlled conditions. This creates an unstable and energetic material by binding nitrate groups to the cellulose fibres found in cotton. The degree of nitration can also be controlled, leading to different nitrocellulose products. In the next stage, the nitrated cellulose is separated from the acid mixture and boiled in water to help remove unstable nitro groups. The finished mixture is then dried and cut or extruded into rods or granules. In the case of Russian ammunition, these are packed into a brass casing. The casings are filled either completely or partially, depending on the range they are designed to provide. They are they made ready for use as a propellent that is inserted behind the artillery round in the breech of the gun prior to firing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian ammunition manufacturing is not strictly specialised, and in an emergency, it is possible for companies to cover more than one stage or process. For example, one company may assemble projectiles for one calibre but deliver elements of others to a separate company working on a different calibre. There are several companies involved in this process in Russia (see Table 9); the Serov Mechanical Plant is one example. It is part of Tekhmash and is responsible for producing shells for artillery ammunition up to 152 mm. The plant was extensively refurbished in 2020 with state-of-the-art CNC machines, and has become an important element within the artillery supply chain. Other companies such as Mechanical Plant in Orsk produce brass casings for propellant. Charges and propellant are produced by many companies, including the Perm and Kazan Gunpowder Plants, as well as the Samara Plant, which is focused on charges for mortars. The Solikamsk Plant is also responsible for manufacturing propellant for mortar and rocket ammunition. The Sverdlov Plant, which has a branch in Altai region, states that it produces Hexogen for the defence industry, and fuses are believed to be manufactured by a company called the Kazan Precision Machinery Plant and Kurganpribor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PROCESSING IN-DEPTH: THE PERM AND KAZAN GUNPOWDER PLANTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of Russia’s most important propellant and energetics plants are the Perm Gunpowder Plant, which accounts for over 40% of Russia’s propellant production based on sales, and the Kazan Gunpowder Plant, which is the country’s most advanced propellant plant and has its own research and development centre as well as a dedicated nitrocellulose production facility. The Perm Gunpowder Plant is a sprawling facility that houses a TNT production plant, a ballistic missile R&amp;amp;D institute and an area dedicated to the testing of ballistic missile engines. It also reportedly produces charges and igniters for rocket engines used in a variety of Russian weapons systems. Perm is equipped with its own thermal power plant, and manufactures a range of explosives for submarine-launched, air-to-air and ground-to-air missiles and artillery systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, both plants appear to have ramped up production. In December 2022, Perm’s governor announced that the plant would receive over RUB one billion in investment for modernisation and construction of new facilities. Meanwhile, the plant announced plans to add 350 workers and increase shifts for current employees after an influx of new defence orders. Similarly, the workforce at the Kazan Plant increased shifts, while the plant launched plans to upgrade production of nitrocellulose and propellant powders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-resolution satellite imagery confirms that, in mid-2023, both the Kazan and Perm Plants began significant expansion and renovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ground has been broken on a large footprint of land directly next to the Kazan Plant’s nitrocellulose production facility, indicating that areas of the facility used for the production of ammunition are being expanded. At least five other locations at the plant have been cleared, likely indicating plans to expand production. This is shown in Figures 12 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar expansion was observed at several locations in the Perm Gunpowder Plant, most notably alongside the TNT production facility, where large swathes of land have been deforested. Similar deforestation can also be seen alongside the solid fuel production area. This is shown in Figures 13 and 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis of the Perm and Kazan Gunpowder Plants further demonstrates that the vulnerabilities of Russia’s artillery supply chain – specifically those that can be affected by Ukraine’s Western partners – are outside Russia. There is a large and significant trade in chemicals between Russia’s petrochemical industry and its defence industry, which would be difficult to disrupt. However, that same petrochemical industry has multiple intersections and relations with Western countries and companies. This means that key chemicals are linked to Western economies, providing points of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domestic Supply Chains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s sprawling petro-chemicals and mining industries are responsible for meeting much of the defence industry’s needs for chemicals and precursors. The majority are moved by rail, and analysis of Russian railway data indicates that both the Perm and the Kazan Gunpowder Plants receive large volumes of precursor materials and chemicals by rail. These include monthly shipments of benthol, methylbenzene, nitric and sulphuric acid, oleum and a range of other chemicals and materials used to manufacture propellant powders, explosives and high- energetics. The delivery of these materials has increased significantly since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WOQRhZp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image24&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, the chemicals are sold and shipped to the Perm and Kazan Plants by well-established Russian companies involved in the manufacture of chemicals, petrochemicals and fertilisers, underscoring the intimate links between the country’s defence and civilian economies. Despite acting as critical supply nodes for Russia’s war effort, many of these companies continue to trade with the global economy. For example, one of the most important suppliers of precursors to both plants is Russia’s Sredneuralsky Copper Smelting Plant (SUMZ). Between April 2023 and April 2024, the latter shipped over 4,000 tonnes of oleum to the Kazan Gunpowder Plant and over 770 tonnes of oleum to the Perm Gunpowder Plant. Oleum, otherwise known as fuming sulphuric acid, is used in the manufacture of explosives such as TNT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/luZwGaH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image25&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available Russian customs records show that SUMZ has been procuring machinery from overseas since 2019. While its total imports have decreased since 2019, the company still imported $11.5 million of equipment and related materials in 2023. Over $1 million of these shipments were spare parts for sulphuric acid blowers supplied by Herzog Hydraulik GmbH, a German company which has a history of shipping goods to SUMZ and other Russian companies. An acid blower is used to move gases during the production of sulfuric acid. The majority of these acid blower spare parts, produced by Howden Turbo, were shipped via Lithuania, with the last shipment occurring in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s petrochemical and refinery industry is also a critical supplier to both gunpowder plants. For example, Lukoil’s refinery in Perm has been making regular deliveries of toluene by rail, a critical precursor for the manufacture of TNT, to the Perm Plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International supply chains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal transaction data for the first half of 2023 shows that both plants made payments to hundreds of companies in Russia, including some that have imported goods. Customs data reveals that dozens of these importers procured items critical to the production of propellants, explosives and shells, which can be broken down into three categories: cotton pulp; chemicals and precursors; and machinery. The issue of cotton pulp supply for nitrocellulose is covered in the Raw Materials section of chapter 4 of this paper. It is sufficient to state here that the trade in cotton pulp and nitrocellulose mentioned in that section is important to the function of the Kazan and Perm Plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemicals and Precursors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kazan and Perm Gunpowder Plants have also engaged with a network of large and small wholesale traders of critical chemical compounds within Russia. This is shown in Figures 12 and 13. Several of these enterprises have been sanctioned by the US, UK and Ukrainian governments since February 2022. Nevertheless, some continue trading internationally and are open about their relationship with the military-industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cxs9XhS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image27&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One supplier to both plants is Neo Chemical LLC, a large distributor of chemical products that states that it operates in Russia, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Europe. It has fulfilled contracts with Russia’s defence industry, including with the Srednenevsky Shipbuilding Plant, the Solikamsk Plant, and the Sverdlov Plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company has been consistent in procuring chemicals and precursors, including epoxy resins, stearic acids, acrylic polymers and polyisobutylene - primarily from Chinese companies. The last of these is a compound used for the production of explosive charges. Russian government patents demonstrate the application of polyisobutylene in the production of plastic and emulsion explosive charges, including for military use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neo Chemical is one of the largest importers of polyisobutylene into Russia, receiving over $3.4 million-worth over 2022 and 2023. The largest supplier during this period was a South Korean petrochemical company named DL Chemical, which shipped over $1.6 million of polyisobutylene in that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one of the company’s largest foreign suppliers is Neo Chemical Deutschland, which shipped over $25 million of products – such as surfactants, epoxy resins and polyethylene produced in the EU – between March 2022 and November 2023. Neo Chemical Deutschland was founded in 2004 by Russian national Andrey Lipovetsky, who was the founder of a third company named Neo Chemical in Russia a year later. While this iteration of Neo Chemical was dissolved in 2007, a co-founder of that company, Vladimir Fedyushkin, founded and currently operates the Neo Chemical that has been receiving shipments from Neo Chemical Deutschland. Meanwhile, an individual named Andrey Lipovetsky registered the domain for a UAE-based company named Proximo FZCO, which also shipped nearly $1.4 million in chemicals and acids to Neo Chemical from October 2022 to December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4jda5ZQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image28&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another supplier to Kazan and Perm, UCC UralChem, has continued to import large volumes of chemicals and related materials from abroad, including lubricants, mineral fertilisers, stearic acids, catalysts, calcium nitrates and potassium nitrates, the latter of which is used in production of gunpowder mixes. While its imports fell from $17.5 million in 2022 to $3.3 million in 2023 the company received shipments from companies in countries such as China, Germany, Turkey, Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the Russia-based companies supplying both gunpowder plants, the largest importer is Sibur Holding, an oil and petroleum processor closely associated with Gazprom. In addition to oil and petroleum products, the company is involved in the supply of rubber and polymer products and owns a large processing plant in Perm that produces polystyrene, propylene and butyl alcohol. In 2022 and 2023, the company imported over $439.7 million in chemicals and precursors. While many of these products were shipped by Chinese companies – including subsidiaries of Chinese state-owned enterprise SinoPec – the company also received shipments of chrome-aluminium composite catalysts and aromatic polycarboxylic acids from South Korean companies Annamoon Co Ltd and Lotte Chemical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VitaReactiv, a chemicals supplier to both Perm and Kazan, imported over $5.5 million of chemicals from Chinese, Turkish and Indonesian suppliers in 2022 and 2023. Contract data shows that the company has a history of supplying industrial chemicals to other Russian defence companies, including Admiralty Shipyards, Salut LLC and the Smolensk Aviation Plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virage International, a Kazan-based producer of chemical products, has imported a curious variety of items over the years, from esters of methacrylic acids to kitchenware, primarily from Chinese companies. One Chinese company that has supplied it with tert-butyl peroxybenzoate, Shanghai East Best International Business Development, is ultimately a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machinery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Perm and Kazan plants have also transacted with companies that have procured machine tools and industrial tooling from abroad. While it is possible that the importers are procuring such machinery to sell to Kazan or Perm, it is likely that some procure machinery for their own use while providing other related goods or services to Perm and Kazan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/W0p6UpF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image29&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable companies that has received large payments from Kazan is the Tambov-based Metall Service LLC, a wholesale trader of pipes, wires and rolled metals. The company’s website confirms that its metal production capacity has significantly expanded since 2019 with the purchase of numerous CNC machines and construction of additional manufacturing halls. The website shows images of Italian, German and South Korean machine tools installed in its manufacturing halls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Import data shows that Metall Service has procured large volumes of machine tools and related components, with the total value of imports in 2023 exceeding $13.2 million, compared to $123,000 the previous year. Since February 2022, the company has imported almost all of these items from Chinese suppliers, with the exception of several shipments of cutting tools acquired from Italy-based Rolm Srl in July and August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/k8udQOM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image30&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 21: Annual Imports for Vidis Group, Syaskky Pulp &amp;amp; Paper Mill, Metall Service and Pozis, 2019-23.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Trade data supplied by third-party commercial provider, Open Source Centre.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;POZiS, which is part of Rostec, is involved in production of small-calibre munitions for artillery systems and over 20 different types of pyrotechnic ignition devices. The company has imported a variety of goods, including steel alloy products and injection-moulding inserts, from Chinese, Italian, South Korean and Turkish companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example, Vidis Group, is a US-sanctioned metal-cutting-tool supplier and was once the Russian distributor of German Widia-branded drilling and milling equipment. In 2022 and 2023, the company imported a total of $3 million in metal-cutting tools and related items from Chinese companies. As well as transacting with the Perm Gunpowder Plant, the company has fulfilled contracts with other defence companies, including Ulan Ude Aviation Plant, UAZ and Titan-Barrikady. The latter is involved in the assembly of artillery pieces and mobile launchers for ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Syassky Pulp &amp;amp; Paper Mill (Syassky PPM), a producer of wood pulp, has received payments from the Kazan Gunpowder Plant. While the mill itself has not been sanctioned, it has supplied a since-sanctioned military explosives plant (Federal State Enterprise Kamensk Plant) with cellulose. Customs records show that the company imported a range of industrial machinery totalling almost $5 million over 2022 and 2023 from Chinese, Turkish, German and Italian companies. It is likely that Syassky PPM is procuring this machinery for its own use to produce cellulose which can then be sold to the Kazan Plant to mitigate Russia’s reliance on foreign importers of cotton cellulose. If this is the case, Syassky PPM’s imports may represent an opportunity for external disruption that could slow the expansion and recapitalisation of Russia’s defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supply chains of Perm and Kazan overall indicate the disruption challenges. A lot of the materials needed by both plants are produced inside Russia and transported via rail. Sanctions against the companies involved may damage their finances on the international market, but they are likely obliged to serve the Russian defence industry, and will receive government backing to continue. It stands to reason that seeking disruption of elements that could be physically stopped because they originate or transit through jurisdictions where Western powers can exercise legal or political effects is more likely to impact the supply chains of Perm and Kazan. For example, by denying access to raw materials like cotton pulp, products like polyisobutylene and key components like German and Italian industrial machinery, Western governments could be reasonably certain that both plants would have to affect a major adaptation and face disruption to their production output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;delivery&quot;&gt;Delivery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After it has been filled, the ammunition is transported via rail from the factories to Russian military depots. From there, it eventually makes its way to one of three primary depots near the Ukrainian border:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Kotluban depot, close to Volgograd. It has an area of 2.17 km2 and appears to include 67 sheds and 28 open air sites for storage of ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;68th Arsenal of the Main Missile and Artillery Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army, near Mozdok in North Ossetia. It has an area of 2.12 km2 and appears to house 61 sheds and 35 bunker facilities dug into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The 719th Artillery Ammunition Storage Base, near Krasnodar region. It has an area of around 1 km2 and includes 13 sheds, four bunker facilities dug into the ground, and 12 open-air storage sites.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is understood that ammunition is driven from these sites to temporary storage locations inside occupied Ukraine. The routes avoid the Kerch Bridge, with less than a quarter of Russia’s cargo traversing the bridge, and the majority instead driven over long distances through occupied Ukraine – even that which is destined for Kherson. Once in Ukraine, the ammunition is stored in warehouse facilities that are rarely protected, but are located some distance from the frontline. It may be driven forward to the front by logistics units such as the 293rd Separate Automobile Battalion – a road-based unit located in Rostov-on-Don – or, as some accounts indicate, collected by drivers dispatched by Russian units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has recently completed a new rail route between Rostov-on-Don, Mariupol, Donetsk City and Dzhankoi in Crimea. This route has a single track and has been built in a year, indicating that its primary initial purpose will be support for logistics inside occupied Ukraine. It has been reported that four engines with associated freight cars in the Russian Railways colours were observed in the Mariupol region on 5 August 2024, indicating that the rail route had been launched at that time. It is possible that this rail route will become a source of supply to Russian units fighting in Ukraine, reducing reliance upon road transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian Aerospace Forces are normally reliant on rail infrastructure and railheads for their logistic requirements. However, it appears that a lack of secure access to these facilities inside Ukraine has led to greater reliance on road transport of ammunition and supplies. At certain points in the conflict, Russia has employed the rail infrastructure in occupied Ukraine to deliver directly to the front, but Ukraine has effectively severed these routes on several occasions. The largest national railway carrier, owner and builder of public railway infrastructure is Russian Railways. The company is 100% owned by the government, and it is responsible for 16 railways covering the entire country. Although other companies participate in the freight sector, they operate under Russian Railways’ network, leasing access from the state-backed monopoly. For example, the Federal Freight Company JSC, delivers raw materials to the fuel and energy sector and to metallurgical industries. It is owned by Russian Railways and participates in the Russian public procurement system. Among its most prominent clients is UralVagonZavod, the largest supplier of military equipment in Russia and the sole manufacturer of tanks in Russia. There are also rail companies that specifically handle military cargo, like T-Trans, which delivered military cargo to the frontline in 2022 by order of the Russian MoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some signs that the rail network is struggling to cope with the pressures of sanctions and to meet the demands of the war. The Ukrainian advance into Kursk in August 2024 prompted the large-scale movement of Russian troops to the area, primarily using rail. This caused overcrowding at stations in the region and led Russian Railways to cancel freight trains coming from Belarus. The Belarusian Railway Workers Association reported that a significant portion of the Moscow region locomotive fleet was used to complete the transfer. This led to a shortage of locomotives to return train carriages, which were abandoned in Smolensk. Russian Railways reportedly faces a labour shortage – much like Russia’s defence industry – as well as challenges in finding spares to maintain its rail fleet. According to Russian Railways, the high volume of locomotive repairs needed and the longer timeframes needed to repair them because of a lack of parts mean that Russia’s ability to export cargo is decreasing. The number of trains put on hold due to a lack of maintenance more than doubled in 2023. As of 2024, about 40,000 trains were out of service because the locomotives re undergoing repairs. Russian Railways’s own figures for 2024 indicate a year-on-year decline in freight loading of 3.5%, as well as a 6.8% reduction in freight turnover. It is reasonable to conclude that the Russian railways are both a vital element in the artillery supply chain and a potential vulnerability. However, further study – of a similar nature to this paper – would be required to assess the exposure of the Russian railways to external disruption and anticipate actions that Russia might take to secure alternatives to Western components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper set out to investigate Russia’s artillery supply chain and identify vulnerabilities that could inform thinking around disrupting the defence industrial base. It has explored the critical role played by artillery in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and how Russia’s supply chains are set up to support the war effort. The available information indicates that Russia’s defence industry is expanding, through new facilities in Kazan and Perm, supplies of CNCs from China, and mass recruitment programmes. This suggests that, if it is not interrupted, Russia will be in a better position to conduct a prolonged war in a material sense by 2030 at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From analysing Russia’s artillery supply chain from end to end, it is clear that some elements are more robust than others. From the mining pits that feed the furnaces at Krasny Oktyabr to the cotton fields that are harvested throughout summer to make nitrocellulose, to the storage sheds at the Kotluban ammunition depot, Russia’s artillery supply chain is a complex ecosystem of raw material suppliers, foreign machinery, trains and overworked specialists. The foundations of the artillery supply chain – namely the factories themselves – and the depots used to store ammunition close to Ukraine are hard to disrupt. These facilities sit inside Russia, in some cases thousands of kilometres from Europe, in others built to withstand a NATO aerospace assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is self-sufficient in many of its needs, especially in raw materials like iron ore, and may have enough machine tools and stored howitzers from the Soviet era to support its war in Ukraine. However, the longer the war continues, the more Russia’s dependencies on foreign suppliers will become a weakness. The examples identified here – such as chromite, cotton cellulose and CNC machines – are examples of raw materials and components that must be sourced from abroad to maintain the artillery supply chain. There have been efforts at disruption of supplies of some of these, but the expansion of Russia’s artillery manufacturing capability, and its ability to continue using artillery ammunition at a high rate of expenditure, indicate that these efforts have failed to successfully limit or affect the artillery supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Russia’s artillery supply chain is not infallible. It can be disrupted with the help of Ukraine’s international partners, through careful targeting of vulnerabilities. The evidence gathered for this paper indicates that Ukraine’s Western partners would be better able to disrupt Russia’s artillery supply chain by focusing efforts in a coordinated manner on raw materials and components that are procured outside Russia. This would involve sanctions and diplomatic pressure: levers that have so far been pulled only in an ad hoc and opportunistic manner. A concerted approach, with additional resources dedicated to enforcement and disruption, will have a greater chance of success. Disrupting the artillery supply chain should be a priority, and if the vulnerabilities identified in this report can be successfully disrupted for prolonged periods, Russia will struggle to meet its needs for artillery ammunition and barrels – this will be vital if Ukraine is to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, strict sanctions against the supply of chrome ore to Russia would impact the barrel production process and likely other military outputs, as well as the oil and gas industry, which is a significant source of funding for the Russian state. Most resources are imported from countries or companies in jurisdictions that are Western partners or receptive to their concerns. It is more difficult to secretly transfer thousands of tonnes of chromium ore into a country than to smuggle in a few thousand microchips. It therefore appears likely that enforced sanctions in this field would have a better chance of successfully disrupting the chromium supply to Russia than sanctions on microchips have had of disrupting that supply chain. Russia would eventually find an alternate source of chromium, but that would take time and could present further disruption opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other tools may include: diplomatic pressure, such as encouraging Taiwan to examine companies exporting CNC machines to Russia and China; or preclusive buying of raw materials on the open market to prevent the hostile nation from accessing them, or to drive up the price and limit access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a growing alliance of authoritarian powers aligned against the West and the rules-based international order. Russia, China and Iran frequently work together to evade sanctions, degrade the authority of Western governments and counter the progress made by democracies since the end of the Second World War. The current focus is Russia, but the need to disrupt supply chains will emerge again as these autocratic regimes continue to attack the West. Western governments must develop the ability to understand and disrupt an opponent’s most critical supply chains sooner rather than later. As Russia expands its defence industry, there is an opportunity to limit its ability to support the war. But there is also a necessity to do so, to help Ukraine win the war. Left on its current trajectory, Russian fire superiority will increase year-on-year and become less vulnerable to external disruption through pressure on the supply chain. It is therefore paramount that Ukraine’s partners work together to find routes that will lead to the disruption of the artillery supply chain. This report provides a starting point; there are dozens of vulnerabilities that could be identified. And if each one could be acted on in concert, it would prove very challenging for Russia to adjust before the trajectory of the war had changed.&lt;/p&gt;

China possesses a range of non-kinetic options it may employ to coerce Taiwan, which could significantly disrupt this trade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime trade is the lifeblood of the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/StdkURK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, thousands of massive containerships and tankers ferry more than $11.5 trillion in goods and energy across the world’s oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These vessels follow well-established routes that converge at strategic chokepoints where maritime traffic is especially vulnerable to disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mXlsru0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asia’s geography, and its centrality to global commerce, have heightened the importance of chokepoints like the Strait of Malacca and, increasingly, the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4LqpdA5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rising assertiveness has sparked fears that it may soon use force to bring Taiwan under its control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a major conflict over Taiwan would have catastrophic consequences for the global economy, less severe actions taken by Beijing would also destabilize trade through the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New research from CSIS estimates that approximately $2.45 trillion worth of goods — over one-fifth of global maritime trade — transited the Taiwan Strait in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruptions to this trade would send shockwaves well beyond Taiwan and China, impacting key U.S. allies and broad swaths of the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z9NnwKA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made it unequivocally clear that the use of force remains an option for resolving Taiwan’s ambiguous political status, stoking fears about a possible invasion of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Beijing has a range of options short of invasion at its disposal. CSIS research suggests that less kinetic actions, such as a coast guard–led quarantine of Taiwan, are more likely in the short term than an amphibious assault on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While lower in intensity, such contingencies could still threaten the trillions of dollars’ worth of trade that moves through the Taiwan Strait each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7nsuvOe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Reliance on the Taiwan Strait for Trade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan produces over 90 percent of the most cutting-edge chips used in smartphones, data centers, and advanced military equipment. Disruptions to the supply of these technologies could wipe trillions of dollars from global GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a critical hub for other goods as well. CSIS estimates that Taiwan’s ports handled approximately $586 billion worth of trade in 2022, including transshipments between other economies. Yet nearly all of this activity flowed through a handful of ports located as little as 100 miles from the Chinese mainland — leaving them uniquely vulnerable to Chinese provocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any possible disruption of merchant traffic through the Taiwan Strait may prompt shipping companies to avoid the area to limit risks and avoid the increased costs from spikes in insurance premiums. Many shippers have done just that throughout 2024 to avoid Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ej2RUIV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merchant vessels typically travel well-worn routes that make the most economical sense, so forced deviations come at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a container ship carrying goods from Singapore — the second-busiest port in the world — to South Korea’s top port, Busan, would typically route through the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, with stops in Taiwan or China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If traffic through the Taiwan Strait is disrupted, the same container ship could reroute through the Luzon Strait and sail east of Taiwan. This would not add much distance to the overall route, but it would likely necessitate skipping port calls in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If cross-strait tensions become especially dire, cautious shipping companies may avoid routes near Taiwan altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same vessel departing from Singapore may choose to sail south of the Philippines before heading north through the Miyako Strait to reach South Korea. This would extend the journey by roughly 1,000 miles, adding significant costs and delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would also likely make it infeasible to stop at Chinese ports while en route to Busan, which could have significant ripple effects on supply chains given China’s central role in maritime shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While charting new routes is possible, shipping companies will face significant logistical challenges in implementing these changes, leading to cost increases and delays that will ultimately affect consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;powering-japan-and-south-korea&quot;&gt;Powering Japan and South Korea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many countries would feel the effects of these disruptions, but two key U.S. allies, Japan and South Korea, would be among those most impacted. CSIS estimates that 32 percent of Japan’s imports and 25 percent of its exports — totaling nearly $444 billion — transited the strait in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea depended on the Taiwan Strait for 30 percent of its imports and 23 percent of its exports, amounting to about $357 billion in goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ng1LqQk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Reliance on the Taiwan Strait: Japan and South Korea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both allies, their reliance on the Taiwan Strait is crucial for importing raw materials. Each year, tankers and other ships carry vast amounts of oil, gas, and coal through the strait to Japan and South Korea to meet their immense energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 95 percent of Japan’s crude oil and 65 percent of South Korea’s is sourced from a select group of Middle Eastern countries. Since ships typically follow the shortest paths available, much of this trade passes through the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Japan, CSIS estimates that roughly $13 billion of its imports also pass through the Luzon Strait — a trip that makes sense for some ships bound for the country’s eastern ports. Yet this is just a fraction of its imports through the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We reaffirm that maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is indispensable to international security and prosperity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and South Korea are also major players in high-tech supply chains and are heavily reliant on the Taiwan Strait for shipments of electronics and machinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chips and electronics rank as South Korea’s second-largest import and Japan’s fourth-largest by value. The lion’s share of these chips are imported from Taiwan and China, including fabrication plants located along the Taiwan Strait in western Taiwan and southeast China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elsewhere-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;Elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For another key U.S. ally, Australia, these dynamics are almost completely flipped. The continent is endowed with immense natural resources, which Canberra has leveraged to position Australia as a pivotal player in the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly 27 percent of Australia’s exports passed through the Taiwan Strait in 2022, totaling almost $109 billion. Commodities such as iron ore, coal, and liquefied natural gas comprised approximately 83 percent of this trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/T76yRjO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Global Reliance on the Taiwan Strait: Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has an especially voracious appetite for Australian iron ore. One in every six dollars Australia earns from its global exports comes from selling iron ore to China. Much of this must pass through the Taiwan Strait to reach China’s heavily industrialized northern provinces, where roughly three-quarters of China’s steel production occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These exports are heavily geographically concentrated in northern Australia. Roughly 85 percent of ore carriers sailing from Australia through the Taiwan Strait to China depart from just one location, Port Hedland, which is one of the world’s largest iron ore export hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EEz1s49.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, though, the extent of the pain for Australia would likely depend on the extent of Chinese aggression. During a quarantine or blockade, Australia may continue selling iron ore and other goods to China while absorbing some of the costs from rerouting away from the waters around Taiwan. In a wide-scale war over Taiwan, the issue may be moot as Canberra could withhold exports of iron ore and other goods to China in response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other key actors in the region are less reliant on the Taiwan Strait. The Philippines depends on the strait to transport about one-fifth of its global imports and one-seventh of its exports, but its geography allows it to send much of its trade through the Luzon Strait and Western Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, mainland Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar are less dependent on the Taiwan Strait — in part because they can send a sizeable portion of their trade overland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-critical-route-for-the-global-south&quot;&gt;A Critical Route for the Global South&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taiwan Strait’s importance is not limited to Indo-Pacific countries. The four countries most reliant on the strait are in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These countries all have one thing in common: their economies depend heavily on exporting raw materials to Asia, especially China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Democratic Republic of the Congo shipped nearly $13 billion worth of copper, cobalt, and other metals through the strait — about 62 percent of its total global exports. Nearly all of it was bound for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zdW0xjp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Global Reliance on the Taiwan Strait: Africa and the Middle East&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eritrea likewise exports more than 70 percent of its zinc ore and almost 100 percent of its copper ore to China. Gabon and Angola are endowed with oil, about 40 percent of which is bound for China. Much of this trade makes its way through the Taiwan Strait to ports in northern China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries in the Middle East are similarly reliant on the strait for transporting oil to markets in Asia. Oman, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, and Yemen all send over 30 percent of their exports through the strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dynamics also extend to some of China’s largest and most important economic and geopolitical partners. On average, the nine BRICS economies rely on the Taiwan Strait for about 14 percent of their imports and 15 percent of their exports. That is more than twice the level of dependence of the G7 economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/f994PTk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Reliance on the Taiwan Strait: BRICS vs. G7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has sought to position itself as a leader and voice of developing countries, in part to build support for its alternative vision of international order beyond the “Western approach.” This is especially the case for its engagement with BRICS nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to maintain broad-based diplomatic support to advance this vision may make Beijing more sensitive to the concerns of these nations. In a crisis or conflict over Taiwan, developing countries will likely seek to continue trading with China — as many have continued to do business with Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Faced with severe disruptions to their trade, they could collectively exert significant pressure on Beijing to resolve a conflict to avoid long-term economic pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-reliance-on-the-taiwan-strait&quot;&gt;China’s Reliance on the Taiwan Strait&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s own economy stands to be severely impacted by any disruptions to trade through the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a large-scale conflict over Taiwan — such as a blockade or invasion — China would likely face severe economic consequences from financial market shocks, U.S. and allied sanctions, and other ripple effects. In addition to those imposed costs, the consequences of interrupted trade flows would be significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A staggering $1.3 trillion of Chinese imports and exports passed through the Taiwan Strait — far more than any other country. Hong Kong adds another $95 billion in trade, bringing the total to nearly $1.4 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/U3SZyzE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Value of Trade through the Taiwan Strait&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waterway is especially crucial in supplying China with raw materials. China’s rapid economic development has transformed the country into the largest importer of oil, coal, and natural gas, as well as key manufacturing imports like ores and metals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These goods collectively make up two-thirds of the value of goods headed to China through the strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/h9BhO94.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CZC2hme.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Chinese Trade through the Taiwan Strait by Industry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s reliance on the strait for exports is lower by comparison, with only 15 percent of its exports passing through the waterway. This is largely because many exports do not have to transit the strait to reach China’s key export markets, such as the United States, Japan, and South Korea. Despite this lower dependency, the total value of exports transiting the strait still exceeds $551 billion — an enormous sum to put at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the strait is not simply vital for China’s international trade. It also facilitates the flow of goods within China. Over half of all voyages through the Taiwan Strait are between the sprawling ports dotting China’s eastern seaboard. China could move some goods internally by land or air, but doing so is typically far more expensive than transporting them by sea. Policymakers in Beijing are undoubtedly aware of this reality, which likely plays a role in their decisionmaking regarding the use of force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a crisis or conflict that disrupts maritime traffic through the Taiwan Strait, China would face major obstacles to conducting trade. Yet Beijing does have options to mitigate the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MhZCgWS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s Top Container Ports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Taiwan Strait is completely impassable to merchant ships, vessels bound for China could reroute, but if they are forced to go through the Miyako Strait, this could leave China susceptible to a distant blockade by U.S., Japanese, and other forces seeking to deprive China of trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In less kinetic scenarios, China could also attempt to only close the Taiwan Strait to non-Chinese vessels while allowing or demanding that its ships continue sailing through the Strait. Nearly half of all cargo and tanker vessels transiting through the Taiwan Strait each year are Chinese-flagged. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that Chinese-owned ships would be secure from interdiction by forces opposing China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing forcefully asserts that the issue of Taiwan is “purely an internal affair,” and its officials bristle when other countries sail naval vessels through the Taiwan Strait — despite their rights to freedom of navigation under international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this report shows the immense importance of the Taiwan Strait to international commerce and demonstrates the scale of the economic consequences should Beijing upset the fragile stability in the strait by using force against Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensuring free and open maritime trade through the Taiwan Strait is critical not just for nearby nations like China, South Korea, and Japan, but for the entire global economy. For Washington, working closely with allies and partners to maintain cross-strait stability is essential to safeguarding international trade.&lt;/p&gt;

It is an opportunity for the United States National Semiconductor Technology Center and its nonprofit purpose-built operator, Natcast to learn from and collaborate with imec to accelerate the U.S. research and industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International competition for the most advanced semiconductors has highlighted the importance of cooperative research institutes. These centers, while diverse in their memberships and specialties, serve a critical role as aggregators of research and development (R&amp;amp;D) resources across firms — as well as shared infrastructure for de-risking emerging technologies throughout the semiconductor value chain and for driving the chip industry’s uniquely rapid pace of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located in the Flanders region of Belgium, imec is perhaps the foremost cooperative research organization for semiconductors, a status bolstered by the participation and support of the world’s top semiconductor firms in its programs, with the exception of major Chinese entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imec has pushed the concept of multinational, diverse research collaboration to achieve ambitious objectives. To this end, it works closely with other leading semiconductor research centers such as the Albany NanoTech Complex, the Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA)’s Leti lab in France, and now Japan’s Leading-Edge Semiconductor Technology Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research institute’s substantial physical assets, talented staff, reputation for neutrality, strong track record, and proven protocols make it ideally situated to advance leadership in semiconductor technology among like-minded countries. In fact, to a considerable degree, it is already performing this role. As such, the United States should collaborate closely with this research center in its efforts to regain technological leadership in chip manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imec holds major lessons for the development of the U.S. National Semiconductor Technology Center and its nonprofit purpose-built operator, Natcast. Imec’ s ability to attract and retain leading companies to cooperatively develop cutting-edge semiconductor technologies in a fiercely competitive and unforgiving industry represents an outstanding model for international cooperative research. The following analysis highlights the unique strengths and approach of this research institute in Leuven, Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Imec’s ability to attract and retain leading companies to cooperatively develop cutting-edge semiconductor technologies in a fiercely competitive and unforgiving industry represents an outstanding model for international cooperative research.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;imecs-origins&quot;&gt;Imec’s Origins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1982, the regional government of Flanders launched an “intense mobilisation of industrial and scientific actors for a ‘Third Industrial Revolution’” in the area. The most important expression of this effort was the government’s establishment of the Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Center (imec) in Leuven in January 1984. Its mission was to promote microelectronics in Flanders through R&amp;amp;D projects with companies and universities that anticipated industry needs by 3–10 years. Research themes eventually came to include microelectronics, nanotechnology, information and communications technology, semiconductor packaging, photovoltaics, and chip-design methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imec was founded by Roger Van Overstraeten, a Flanders-born Stanford PhD graduate who returned to Belgium to pursue future-generation semiconductor technology with a group of colleagues at Catholic University Leuven (KU Leuven). His vision was to establish “an unparalleled research facility dedicated to microchip technology,” which he pursued despite considerable skepticism at the time. There was widespread recognition in government circles that while Flanders often excelled in research, its ability to support its practical applications was often lacking. Focusing on this challenge, Van Overstraeten sought to “drag European microelectronics excellence out of the laboratories and into the factories.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When imec was established, policymakers intended for it to focus entirely on support for the Flanders region in collaboration with regional universities and companies. Given the lack of critical mass in the microelectronics space within the region, this initial concept was not feasible. Fortunately, imec’s leadership pivoted to a more international approach, establishing the organization as a neutral research center supporting companies and universities worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;business-model&quot;&gt;Business Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most major microelectronics R&amp;amp;D centers around the world are located in jurisdictions that have one or more large semiconductor companies and where, for political and economic reasons, the centers tend to support those local producers, whether directly or indirectly. Belgium has no large chip firms — but in building a global network of industry partners, this has worked to imec’s unique advantage. The center’s current CEO, Luc Van den hove, explained in 2024 that because no one semiconductor company dominates imec’s strategy, the organization has been able to build a “Switzerland of semiconductors” reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The center’s broad membership includes companies that often compete with each other but are confident that their intellectual property (IP) will be respected. They recognize the value added from cooperation on common problems and the advantages of sharing the costs of cutting-edge facilities and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of neutrality has been reflected in practice. For example, in 2008, imec declared that it would not take part in any R&amp;amp;D projects organized under the auspices of the European Union’s Eureka initiative, claiming such programs often serve as “a form of support for national champions” and are thus inconsistent with imec’s practice of strictly neutral international collaboration. In subsequent years, imec did participate in Eureka programs but to a limited degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;partnerships-with-industry-the-central-focus&quot;&gt;Partnerships with Industry: The Central Focus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal focus of imec’s operations is joint R&amp;amp;D projects with industry partners to develop precompetitive technologies for applications in future generations of semiconductor products and processes. According to a science and technology counselor for the Flemish government, “This joint collaboration model accelerates innovation, by pooling resources and alleviating the ever-increasing development costs of new technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting its central position in advanced semiconductor manufacturing research, as of 2021 imec has over 600 industry partners who contribute their own resources to joint projects, including their knowledge base, experts, funding, and materials. They may share precompetitive intellectual property or use imec’s fabrication services for their own proprietary research, including prototyping and low-volume manufacturing. Industry partners can sign up for individual imec projects and programs without committing to others — in contrast to the former U.S. chip research consortium Sematech, which required an all-or-nothing commitment from member companies. Companies can also collaborate with imec bilaterally for private research, development, or services while securing their IP. For example, imec helped ASML fabricate high-quality sensor chips for their EUV lithography systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry partners can also collaborate with imec to develop new research units and facilities within the consortium. In 2000, for example, imec and Philips Research (the R&amp;amp;D arm of Dutch chip and electronics firm Royal Philips Electronics) jointly created a permanent department within imec, with Philips signing onto all of imec’s process-oriented industrial programs and gaining the ability to use the center’s chip fabrication line for its own research on process technologies. In 2003, Samsung, Intel, Infineon, Philips, and STMicroelectronics enabled imec to set up an R&amp;amp;D fab for 300-millimeter (mm) chips by joining imec as core partners in its sub-45-nanometer (nm) complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) program. And in 2010, imec and Intel entered into an agreement to establish a new lab dedicated to exascale-class supercomputers, including the development of tools and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imec’s chip research strategy has two elements. The first, “More Moore,” seeks to sustain the developmental path of established silicon-based technologies through incremental improvements, usually through scaling, to maintain Moore’s Law into ever-deeper extremes of miniaturization. On this front, imec has created the world’s largest ecosystem for CMOS technology, bringing together most of the world’s major chip foundries, fabless firms, tool and materials suppliers, electronic design automation firms, and application developers. CMOS is the chip technology currently used to produce most of the world’s integrated circuits, offering advantages such as low power consumption, simple structure, high noise tolerance, and strong temperature stability. In addition, imec’s longstanding commitment to developing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography with Dutch chip toolmaker ASML has been instrumental in the industry’s ability to scale beyond the 14 nm node level (as discussed further below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, “More Than Moore” pursues innovation that could lead to the emergence of new micro- and nanoelectronics technologies and markets. Imec’s long-term assumption is that this branch of its research effort will eventually eclipse More Moore. Pursuant to More Than Moore, the center has explored specialties such as organic electronics, hybrid semiconductors, organic photovoltaics, and biomedical electronics. These projects often involve collaboration with imec’s Dutch affiliate, the Holst Center, which it cofounded in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the constellation of imec industry partners, a handful of companies are “core partners.” The center’s management may identify research programs of interest, then reach out to interested firms from their pool of core partners and provide them the shared facilities to conduct collaborative research. In 2003, imec recruited several major chipmakers to pursue process technology for 45 nm and smaller semiconductors — then the next generation of semiconductor technology. Core partner status meant that the firms involved could participate in all seven of the 45 nm programs that comprised imec’s platform at the time and would receive “certain advantages over companies that remain outside the core,” according to then-CEO Gilbert Declerck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;substantial-and-sustained-public-support&quot;&gt;Substantial and Sustained Public Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imec research center was founded in 1984 with an initial investment of around $72 million by the government of Flanders. Although the regional government continued to make the annual contributions crucial for a sustainable research program, it set a target from the outset for imec to eventually receive 50 percent of its revenues from nongovernment sources, which it achieved in the mid-1990s and has exceeded in every subsequent year. In 2023, imec’s annual revenue totaled 941 million euros: 75 percent came from industry partners, 16 percent from the regional government of Flanders, 6 percent from the European Union, and 3 percent from other government programs. This long-term commitment by the regional government to support and grow the institution is one of the keys to imec’s success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Flanders is a relatively small political jurisdiction with a population of about 6.8 million, its government wields substantial power to drive internal economic development and plays a strong role in supporting imec. A 2012 Japanese study observed that the “strength of the Flemish government’s authority in industrial development is equivalent to that of the Japanese federal government.” This regional thrust comes as Belgium has shifted from a unitary state to a federal state in phases since the 1960s, with central government powers devolving progressively onto the regional governments of Dutch-speaking Flanders, French-speaking Wallonia, and the Brussels Capital Region, each with its own executive and parliament. Although the central government retains authority in areas such as foreign relations and national defense, regional authorities lead industrial development. Devolution gave the government of Flanders the autonomy to significantly increase its investments in innovation, enabling it to more than double outlays on R&amp;amp;D from what had been below-average levels relative to the European Union prior to devolution to far above the EU average by 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a 2024 interview at CSIS, imec CEO Van den hove emphasized the importance of continued public funding despite its diminished percentage of total revenue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We believe that we’ve been able to realize a phenomenal growth over those 40 years. And this has been realized through a growing commitment from industry. But at the same time, this commitment from industry was leveraged on top of very strong and stable support from the local government. And this, we believe, is important because it allows us to invest in new programs which today are probably too early for industry to finance but allow us to make sure that we can develop a long-term strategy. . . . Our role is to kind of set the roadmap for the next 10–20 years. So we have to pre-invest a lot in some of these [emerging technology areas].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Flanders and the European Union have also made significant one-time contributions to imec for special projects. For instance, Flanders provided imec 35.7 million euros for a new research facility that allowed it, among other things, to build a machine to clean silicon plates of minute dust particles in 2004. In 2009, Flanders gave imec 35 million euros to help finance 75 million euros that it used to construct a new 2,800-square-meter (0.7-acre) cleanroom to support research on 22 nm and smaller CMOS chips and on organic solar cells and biomedical electronics. In 2012, Flanders indicated it would invest in the cost of building cleanroom facilities at imec to enable the pursuit of 450 mm wafer technology, estimated at 100 million euros. The project was shifted to expand the existing 300 mm facility, as the industry did not coalesce around 450 mm technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, imec added a second 4,000 square meter 300 mm cleanroom. This new cleanroom expansion (including building and equipment) entailed a total investment of more than 1 billion euros, one-tenth of which was supplied by the Flemish government. Importantly, more than 900 million euros in investment were derived from joint R&amp;amp;D with more than 90 industrial partners from across the entire semiconductor industry. Imec’s semiconductor research cleanrooms now total more than 13,000 square meters (nearly 140,000 square feet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, it was announced in May 2024 that imec will receive 1.4 billion euros in combined funding from the European Chips Act and the Flanders government — complemented by 1.1 billion euros from industry partners — to extend its NanoIC pilot line, a leading technology platform for companies to explore new technologies before they are introduced into large-scale production. Aiming to accelerate commercialization of sub-2 nm semiconductor technologies, the NanoIC pilot line will support a broad range of industries — including automotive, telecommunications, and health — to develop products that leverage the latest chip innovations. This will include a new 4,000 square meter 300 mm Fab 4, bringing total cleanroom space to 17,000 square meters (182,000 square feet). These ambitious projects feed into what European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has described as an “essential” role for imec in the context of the European Chips Act:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The role imec plays in the European Union’s ambitions will be particularly significant. . . To be less dependent on East Asia, we need to scale up our production here in Europe: imec is essential for our economic security. For investors who need to research and test their innovations before moving to mass production, it is an important place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While imec is strongly supported by Flanders, it enjoys operational autonomy. It is run by an executive board and a senior leadership team that plan and execute strategy. The center’s R&amp;amp;D targets are set forth in 5-year business plans that are reviewed by both the government of Flanders and technical advisory boards comprised of global experts in the various thematic areas in which imec is active. imec is further overseen by a board of directors, which has four members drawn from the faculty of Flemish universities, two from Flemish industry, two designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and one picked by the Ministry of Education. In addition, university professors and industry researchers drawn from among core partners conduct a critical review twice a year of each research project and suggest actions the center could take. The relative autonomy of the imec leadership enables it to follow the technology — and indeed lead it — without undue political constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-leuven-technology-cluster&quot;&gt;The Leuven Technology Cluster&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imec is the main hub of a local technology cluster, which reflects decades of investment by Flanders, local governments, the private sector, and imec itself. In addition to five excellent nearby research universities, Leuven hosts numerous other world-leading research entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying the imec model to similar national efforts around the world has led critics to claim that subsidizing the research activities of multinational firms without a local footprint will not help the local economy. However, imec’s benefits to the Flemish region have been significant and measurable over the past four decades. Young company representatives doing research at imec are likely to move up in their own companies, then consider Flanders when later making decisions about where to locate research centers or other activities. Hundreds of PhD candidates pursuing their research at imec provide a growing talent pool with ties to the region. In addition, imec subcontracts many tasks to local companies, helping to strengthen the industrial ecosystem; some of these firms have gone on to become “very fast growers.” An independent analysis of imec’s economic benefits to the region concluded in 2020 that for each euro of Flemish government investment, imec creates 7 euros of value added to the Belgian economy and 3.7 euros of return on the subsidy through taxes. Each million euros invested in imec creates 23 jobs at imec and 67 elsewhere in the Belgian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intellectual-property&quot;&gt;Intellectual Property&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its large pool of researchers and expertise, imec brings very substantial knowledge — some of it patented — to any research collaboration, known as “relevant background IP.” Industry partners can pay a fee to join one or more of imec’s Industrial Affiliation Programs, and imec will share its background IP applicable to their particular research area. Imec holds the “foreground IP” that is developed during the collaboration and licenses it out to all industry partners who participated; this becomes part of its background IP for use in future collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial partners can take away as little or as much of the IP generated by the joint effort as they would like, with the terms being negotiated on a case-by-case basis, usually involving costs to the industrial partner, particularly for an exclusive license. These bilateral negotiations are overseen by imec lawyers and valuation experts. Imec may seek terms such as payment of the royalties on subsequent sales if the industry partner takes the technology to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;infrastructure&quot;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From imec’s inception, companies and academic researchers have been attracted to its research partnerships because of its ability to make available the advanced equipment needed to pursue cutting-edge research. Imec benefits in this respect since partners “can provide tools, equipment and materials for free and that can be provided and tested by other partners when conducting R&amp;amp;D at the facility.” The center also offers other forms of support, including design, prototyping, testing, and consulting services, which are particularly important for start-ups and small- to medium-sized enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an event at CSIS, imec CEO Van den hove observed that the center’s success is attributable to the fact that it has invested in the infrastructure needed to achieve its objectives: “Over those 40 years, we probably built out what is. . . the world’s most advanced, independent R&amp;amp;D pilot line. We’ve invested more than $5 billion in that facility. And it’s really run as one integrated facility, with a very strong focus on operational excellence so that we can deliver value in a very effective way to our partners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imec currently has 8,000 square meters (1.98 acres) of 300 mm cleanroom space and 5,200 square meters (1.28 acres) of 200 mm cleanroom space. Its class 1,000 300 mm cleanroom has all the equipment needed to pursue sub-2 nm CMOS R&amp;amp;D, including advanced lithography based on ASML’s newest EUV equipment. It has a vast array of specialized labs pursuing silicon and organic photovoltaics, packaging and testing equipment, photonics, gallium-nitride processing, design methodology, biosensors, DNA research, imaging, and many other topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-a-melting-pot&quot;&gt;Workforce: A Melting Pot&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From about 70 employees at its inception, imec’s workforce has grown to over 5,500, with roughly 10 percent holding PhDs. In November 2023, imec forecast that its workforce would add nearly 2,000 new hires by 2035. Research staff are drawn from university partners in Belgium and many other countries, and staff are allowed to hold dual appointments at their institutions. An important strength of the model is that it allows industry partners to assign their own employees to work on site, which brings in cutting-edge, commercially relevant perspectives and the tacit knowledge garnered through familiarity with actual production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This inclusive approach results in imec having one of the most diverse workforces of any major microelectronics center in the world. As CEO Van den hove observed, “We’ve been attracting people from all over the world, close to 100 nationalities, and 5,500 of the most advanced, top-notch researchers. Many of them have experience of more than twenty years either in imec or the industry.” One Indian-Finnish employee at imec remarked that the staff is so multinational in character that “the Flemish culture does not prevail. . . . You can never see the difference between people’s national backgrounds.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An important strength of the model is that it allows industry partners to assign their own employees to work on site, which brings in cutting-edge, commercially relevant perspectives and the tacit knowledge garnered through familiarity with actual production.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imec’s facilities are colocated with KU Leuven, and its CEOs have all been professors there. For instance, Luc Van den hove is a member of KU Leuven’s Faculty of Engineering Sciences and received his PhD in electrical engineering from the institution while conducting research at imec. When the center was starting up, faculty from various Flemish universities — particularly a group of KU Leuven professors who wanted to pursue microprocessor research — served as experts to help build its knowledge base. This partnership has contributed to Thompson-Reuters rating KU Leuven as Europe’s most innovative university in recent years, while the university-based leadership has enabled imec to develop a global network of formal and informal relationships with other institutions of higher learning. At present, it has collaborations with over 200 universities and myriad “non-formal collaborations through a network of scientists, engineers and PhD students.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;critical-bilateral-partnerships&quot;&gt;Critical Bilateral Partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;asml&quot;&gt;ASML&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imec’s costly, risky, but successful three-decade research partnership with the Dutch chip toolmaker ASML is an important illustration of its capabilities. This collaboration has created an ecosystem for proving, testing, and debugging newly developed ASML tools and integrating them into manufacturing lines. With imec’s support, ASML has produced technological breakthroughs such as the development of EUV lithography tools used to produce the chips needed to support cutting-edge applications, including artificial intelligence (AI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior versions of photolithography for chips utilized deep ultraviolet (DUV) light, but shorter wavelengths were needed to continue to make circuit patterns smaller and advance Moore’s Law. EUV uses light with a wavelength of 13.5 nm, which does not occur in nature but can be created by zapping drops of molten tin with a carbon dioxide laser until they become plasma. The light emitted by this process is collected and passed through a mask with the pattern of the circuitry on it, then the pattern is shrunk down to the size of a semiconductor die with a system of ultra-flat mirrors and projected onto a silicon wafer. This must all be done in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing and refining this technology into workable lithography tools was a challenge so daunting that during the several-decade-long developmental effort, various observers declared that the process was a failure, would never work, or could not become reality in the reasonably foreseeable future. Nevertheless, ASML and imec persevered in a protracted, multi-billion-euro effort, a demonstration of how big R&amp;amp;D risks and a long-term focus sometimes pay off in spectacular fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ASML enjoys a monopoly on the manufacture of the world’s most advanced lithography equipment, EUV — representing a major strategic asset for Western powers in their technological competition with China. EUV lithography enables the high-volume production of chips with advanced AI applications, underpinning advances in a vast array of other critical technology areas that have the potential to shape the outcome of future conflicts. Many in the West have underestimated Chinese capabilities in adapting and improving complex technologies such as high-speed rail, aircraft, and telecommunications. Nonetheless, given the enormous complexity of EUV lithography, China is unlikely to possess a comparable capability for many years, especially given U.S. semiconductor export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ASML and imec persevered in a protracted, multi-billion-euro effort, a demonstration of how big R&amp;amp;D risks and a long-term focus sometimes pay off in spectacular fashion.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While other players made major contributions to the EUV effort — including Intel, IBM, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), and ASML’s German optics partner, Carl Zeiss — imec’s role was crucial. Before the first EUV-based lithography tool was available, imec conducted EUV tests at Switzerland’s Paul Scherrer Institute and collaborated with six makers of photoresist. In 2006, imec received one of the first full-field EUV lithography tools, the Alpha Demo Tool — jointly created by engineers at ASML and the College of Nanotechnology, Science, and Engineering (CNSE) at the University of Albany, SUNY — so it could assess its commercial viability and identify operational challenges on pilot lines in a real factory environment. Since then, imec has worked with ASML to prove and test every subsequent generation of EUV tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarizing imec’s “very close partnership” with ASML, CEO Luc Van den hove has said “ASML focuses on the machine. We develop the process. We develop the ecosystem around the machine.” This dynamic continues today. In June 2023, imec signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with ASML to install and service its “full suite of advanced lithography and metrology equipment in the imec pilot line in Leuven,” such as the new 0.55 and 0.33 numerical-aperture (NA) EUV machines. The high-NA lithography EXE-series machines enable much faster wafer throughput than the previous-generation NXE systems introduced in 2010, and can be used to produce 2 nm and below semiconductors. Imec has secured commitments of 750 million euros each from the European Union and the Flanders government to support this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company&quot;&gt;Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, imec has come to engage deeply with TSMC. A core partner of imec since 2005, TSMC dispatched a researcher to Leuven in 2006 to work with the prototype Alpha Demo Tool and prepare the technology for high-volume manufacturing; after its work at imec, it eventually ordered a development EUV tool from ASML for delivery in 2013, concluding that the technology could be refined and used successfully. TSMC subsequently deployed its EUV machines in high-volume manufacturing in 2019 for use in its N7+ process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the imec-TSMC relationship became more symbiotic. One 2010 partnership between them was designed to resolve a chicken-and-egg conundrum facing the Taiwanese foundry. TSMC could not safely develop manufacturing processes for certain application-specific technologies until it was sure that volume demand would exist, but volume demand would not emerge until the process existed. To break the impasse, imec promised to pass on certain new technologies to TSMC, which would ramp up their production once imec had demonstrated their viability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rapidus&quot;&gt;Rapidus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting its international approach, in late 2022 imec entered into a collaboration with Rapidus, a collective of eight Japanese companies that aims to restore an internationally competitive chip industry in Japan.71 In 2023, the conglomerate became one of imec’s core partners, gaining access to its “advanced technologies, system solutions, state-of-the-art 300 mm pilot line, and extensive partner network.” This cooperation complements the partnership at SUNY-Albany’s CNSE between IBM and Rapidus, which hopes to gain the ability to manufacture 2 nm chips. The Japanese government is committed to this ambitious effort, as reflected in its announcement in April 2024 that it would contribute $3.9 billion to Rapidus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-up-support-and-investment-arms&quot;&gt;Start-up Support and Investment Arms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, over 300 high-tech companies are now located in Leuven, many of which are spinoffs from KU Leuven and imec. This situation underscores imec’s dynamic effects on the region (in the view of Chairman Antoon de Proft) and highlights how imec not only serves established high-tech companies but also creates new firms in significant numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, imec conducts venturing activities that focus on “deep tech” — fundamental technologies that require an extended phase of R&amp;amp;D to commercialize but promise major payoffs, transforming “disruptive technologies into disruptive companies.” Imec encourages this dynamic in several ways: through spinoffs led by its own researchers; through its technology accelerator, imec.istart; and through venture capital investments in its independently managed imec.xpand fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spinoffs&quot;&gt;Spinoffs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view of imec’s director of venture development, Olivier Rousseaux, spinoffs in particular represent a way for imec to help commercialize IP it has developed and capture “a share of the upside potential of our innovation.” He suggests this activity could be expanded further, noting, “Today, imec gets paid typical research project fees for innovation that goes into the market and generates billions of Euros. We make good money, but peanuts compared to what we could make.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These spinoff ventures continue to grow. Imec’s website lists 72 companies spun off by the consortium between 1986 and 2023, most of which are still operating or have been acquired by other firms. Another 68 companies were spun off from iMinds before that organization merged with imec in 2016. As one would expect with high-tech start-ups, a few of these new companies have been liquidated, but the majority have survived and thrived. This is in no small part because imec contributes the deep-tech expertise of over 5,000 “highly skilled and dedicated researchers”; access to exceptional facilities, particularly cleanroom space and 3.5 billion euros worth of equipment; and support through a vibrant regional ecosystem of established partners, “which creates opportunities for young spinoffs to collaborate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-imecistart-accelerator&quot;&gt;The Imec.istart Accelerator&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12 to 18-month imec.istart program complements imec’s venture activity. Launched in 2011, imec.istart is a digital technology business accelerator for supporting start-ups that present a working proof of concept, providing access to imec facilities, early-stage financing, mentoring, free office space, and introductions to tech communities, among other benefits. Participation in imec.istart is limited to companies that are less than two years old, based in Belgium, and focus on digital products or nanotechnologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imec.istart invests a minimum of 100,000 euros in pre-seed funding for each selected start-up, split 50-50 between equity and a convertible loan, and may choose to award an additional 150,000 euros at its discretion once the start-up is “up-and-running.” The initial 100,000 euros can be used for any business costs, but only up to 30,000 of it can be spent on product development, and none of it on salaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2024, imec.istart announced the launch of a new, independently managed future fund to enable longer-term and larger-scale investments in promising imec.istart start-ups beyond the initial 100,000 euros of seed funding. The investments are expected to average 1 million euros per qualifying start-up, totaling an estimated 25 million euros over the first five years. Investors include imec, PMV (the Flanders government’s wholly owned investment fund), ING Belgium, and private parties such as angel investors and the founders of imec.istart alumni companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two-thirds of imec.istart’s portfolio consists of software firms, which have the advantage of lower capital costs than hardware developers and can go to market more quickly, making them much more attractive to investors. Some of the accelerator’s notable successes include the Ghent-based food-delivery company Deliverect, data companies Datacamp and PieSync, and medical-software developer Ugentec. Imec.istart now has a portfolio of over 300 start-ups, and in 2023 UBI Global named it the world’s top business incubator linked to a university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;venture-investment-imecxpand&quot;&gt;Venture Investment: Imec.xpand&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Established in 2017, imec.xpand operates as a venture capital fund, investing in nanotechnology hardware start-ups and spinoffs in which “imec knowledge, expertise and infrastructure will be the differentiating factor for success.” The fund is independently managed and cofinanced by imec, government entities, and private firms (some of which are imec members), who together contributed 120 million euros in its first round of investment. In May 2024, imec.xpand announced the launch of a second, 300-million-euro fund for “accelerating the growth of transformative semiconductor and nanotechnology innovations.” According to imec, imec.xpand has invested in 23 companies to date — including two unicorns — which have collectively raised close to 1.5 billion euros in funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;international-partnerships-and-footprint&quot;&gt;International Partnerships and Footprint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;imec-in-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Imec in the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its research partnerships with many U.S. firms, imec operates three centers of excellence in the United States at sites where it can collaborate easily with local research universities. Notable centers and partnerships include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;imec USA–Florida, located near Orlando, which focuses on cryogenic and superconducting computing, as well as advanced semiconductor packaging;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;imec USA–Berkeley, which focuses on innovative AI architectures and the co-optimization (redesigning) of system technology;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;imec USA–San José, which provides design services, multi-project wafer runs, and application-specific integrated circuit development;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;joint research by imec and Purdue University to develop and demonstrate novel semiconductor materials, laying the foundation for “the next wave of high-performance compute and packaging materials” and aiming to make them more sustainable; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;an MoU signed by imec, the University of Michigan, Washtenaw Community College, General Motors, the semiconductor firm KLA, and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to pursue semiconductor technologies for the automotive industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imec has proposed further partnerships with U.S. research organizations and companies to advance the competitiveness and self-sufficiency of semiconductor production in the two regions. Along with partners, imec has expressed its willingness to help CHIPS Act entities ramp up U.S. semiconductor programs. As CEO Van den hove has pointed out, the center is well-positioned to expand upon its ties with major U.S. chipmaking firms by providing access to its expertise, IP, and other complementary operational capabilities. Imec also hopes to work with the newly established U.S. National Semiconductor Technology Center on earlier-stage technology research that may take seven to ten years before going to market and has proposed assigning imec engineers to the Albany NanoTech Complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;europes-prevail-consortium&quot;&gt;Europe’s PREVAIL Consortium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2022, Europe’s four leading public research organizations — imec, France’s CEA-Leti, Germany’s Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, and Finland’s Technical Research Center (VTT) — established a consortium to coordinate their respective 300 mm research facilities to design, evaluate, test, and fabricate the advanced chips needed to enable artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consortium, the Partnership for Realization and Validation of AI-hardware Leadership (PREVAIL), will initially operate for 42 months and has a budget of 156 million euros — half of which is coming from the European Union and half from the host governments of the four organizations involved. Most of this budget (86 percent) is allocated to capital outlays, and only 6 percent funds the manufacture of demonstration circuits. By February 2024, the consortium announced it was finishing up installing cleanroom tools and was almost ready to design and test prototypes from across Europe. The aim is for the consortium to open up their new, shared pilot lines to smaller chipmakers, start-ups, and research institutions by May 2026, allowing them to manufacture, assemble, and test AI-embedded devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;imec-research-center-in-spain&quot;&gt;Imec Research Center in Spain&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, imec, the Spanish government, and the regional government of Andalusia signed an MoU to establish a public-private partnership to establish a 300 mm R&amp;amp;D facility in Málaga called Fab 5. Imec will manage operations, provide the necessary technology and operations, and grant access to its global partner network. The two government parties have agreed to finance the construction of Fab 5, including equipment for a pilot line, and will provide additional long-term support for its operation. However, as the parties are reportedly still negotiating on the level of public support, there is no timetable or budget available yet. Complementing the existing imec fab in Leuven, which is focusing on CMOS and sub-1 nm fabrication, the Málaga fab will concentrate on “process developments and the introduction of materials that are difficult to combine with standard CMOS processes,” as well as R&amp;amp;D of devices with applications to healthcare, photonics, sensing, and augmented and virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of the world’s premier cooperative research institutions, imec has made remarkable contributions to today’s semiconductor ecosystem. These contributions are reflected most clearly in the continued active participation of major chip manufacturers, system companies, and equipment, materials, and design software suppliers in imec programs, as well as the sustained support of the Flanders regional authorities. In addition to its outstanding research facilities and staff, the flexibility of the imec structure — allowing for different degrees of cooperation — and the independence of its leadership have made it a central node in the global semiconductor supply chain. Critically, the center is a major source of the next-generation manufacturing technologies needed to keep the Western chip industry continuing along its rapid trajectory, with all the economic and social benefits that entails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, expanded collaboration with imec is an opportunity to accelerate the progress of U.S. semiconductor research programs, strengthen the transatlantic alliance, and minimize needlessly duplicative, costly investments in semiconductor research programs and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

While the CHIPS Act has built downstream U.S. capacity, upstream incentives are needed to secure materials for the next generation of advanced chips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductors are a vital and mineral-intensive component in the electronic devices that power the modern economy. Four minerals central to semiconductor production — gallium, germanium, palladium, and silicon — face heightened supply chain risks due to dependence on China and Russia. Building resilient supply chains for these minerals is essential for the next generation of chipmaking. To date, enacted legislation has focused on downstream manufacturing, leaving American technologies highly vulnerable to minerals supply chain disruptions. A new policy playbook for semiconductor minerals is necessary to incentivize private sector investment and foster cooperation with allies and strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductors are a critical technology for economic security, and they are also incredibly mineral intensive. Semiconductors are present in all types of electronics, including smartphones, computers, automotives, energy storage, medical devices, lighting, and military and aerospace applications. Four indispensable minerals — gallium, germanium, palladium, and silicon — face significant supply chain risks. While current government funding and tax incentives, such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), focus on addressing supply chain vulnerabilities and stimulating private investment, they are limited to metals used to manufacture electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Moreover, though the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 was designed to boost semiconductor manufacturing, it does not include any support for the related mineral inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act provided over $280 billion for advanced chip manufacturing, packaging, and workforce development. The bill focused almost entirely on onshoring downstream capabilities, and as a result significant funding has gone to companies such as Intel and Micron to enable them to build and expand fabrication facilities for chipmaking. Yet the CHIPS Act did not include any provisions to incentivize the diversification of critical mineral supply chains for semiconductors. This is a major national security oversight. Without alternative sourcing, the semiconductor supply chain remains highly dependent on China and other U.S. adversaries. This has already backfired. In August 2023, China imposed export restrictions on gallium and germanium, alarming the U.S. semiconductor industry. China accounts for 98 percent of the world’s refined gallium and 68 percent of the world’s germanium production. The United States, meanwhile, produces no gallium and less than 2 percent of the world’s refined germanium. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that just a 30 percent supply disruption of gallium could cause a $602 billion decline in U.S. economic output, equivalent to 2.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), posing a significant economic threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs policies that incentivize investment in mineral supply chains that are independent of Chinese control. Just as the IRA has spurred private sector investment in lithium, copper, nickel, and graphite for EVs, the right set of tax incentives and grant programs could bolster the mineral supply chains on which semiconductor technologies rely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mineral-inputs-for-semiconductors&quot;&gt;Mineral Inputs for Semiconductors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semiconductors control the flow of electric currents within electronic devices. In order to perform this function, semiconductors use a variety of minerals for their different conductive and insulative properties. The manufacturing process is extensive and complex, requiring industry-specific equipment (e.g., lithography machines) and precise processes (e.g., etching, packaging, and cleaning for impurities). The type of semiconductor and the stage of manufacturing determine the minerals needed. For example, fluorine is used in etching and purifying, while titanium comes into play during advanced packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it can be conductive, semiconductive, or even insulative, silicon is the most common material for chip wafers. After initial manufacturing, silicon wafers undergo a process called doping, where additional metals such as gallium, arsenic, iridium, and phosphorous are introduced to slightly alter the wafers’ conductivity. Copper and cobalt make up the wires connecting these billions of transistors together into one integrated circuit. By the end of the manufacturing process, a dozen different minerals may have been used in the creation of a single chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper focuses on gallium, germanium, palladium, and silicon for several reasons. First, the primary application for gallium, germanium, and silicon is the semiconductor industry, with U.S. demand for these minerals consequently being driven by the industry. In contrast, demand for copper, titanium, and cobalt is driven by the energy, construction, automotive, and aerospace industries. Second, these same three minerals — gallium, germanium, and silicon — are the most used semiconductor materials and lack good substitutes; other materials such as arsenic are only needed in trace amounts for gallium arsenide (GaAs) chips, which are increasingly being substituted with higher-performance gallium nitride (GaN) compounds. Finally, the United States is reliant on foreign adversaries for the import of these four essential minerals, whereas it was a top exporter of iridium, fluorine, and phosphorous in 2022 and already has a plethora of allied sourcing options in India, Israel, Japan, and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the industry specificity of these four minerals, U.S. reliance on imports from foreign adversaries, and the export restrictions and supply disruptions that gallium, germanium, palladium, and silicon already face, or are likely to face, prioritizing new sourcing is key for U.S. economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;critical-minerals-for-semiconductors-which-minerals-pose-the-greatest-risks&quot;&gt;Critical Minerals for Semiconductors: Which Minerals Pose the Greatest Risks?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gallium&quot;&gt;Gallium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium is key to unlocking higher-power and higher-frequency electronics. Yet, the mineral is also the semiconductor mineral with the highest supply chain vulnerability due to the concentration of its global production in China and the high dependence of U.S. semiconductor manu¿facturing on Chinese imports. Used to produce GaN and GaAs high-performance chips, gallium offers higher speed, lower resistance, and lower production costs when compared to alternatives. Gallium is an indispensable, non-substitutable material for the United States’ defense industry’s next generation of electronic devices. These kinds of chips can be found in mobile phones, automotives, satellites, and LiDAR sensors. Today, China produces 98 percent of the world’s gallium, meaning that even as the United States reshores semiconductor fabrication facilities with CHIPS Act money, the semiconductor industry remains reliant on materials sourced from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty in diversifying gallium sources centers on the mineral’s availability. It is exceedingly rare in the Earth’s crust — less than 19 parts per million (ppm) — and is sourced only as a byproduct of bauxite mining. The United States has small bauxite reserves (just 20 million metric tons) and minimal mining activity. Guinea, however, has the world’s largest bauxite reserves, at 7.4 billion metric tons, followed by Australia (5.1 billion) and Brazil (2.7 billion). In 2022, 64.3 percent of global bauxite exports came from Guinea, 12.0 percent from Australia, 9.3 percent from Indonesia, and 2.4 percent from Brazil. Most of these exports went to China for refining. For example, 81.5 percent of Guinea’s bauxite exports went to China, as did 97 percent of Australia’s and 100 percent of Indonesia’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States seeks to increase its bauxite imports from non-Chinese sources, the private sector will need to invest in mineral-refining infrastructure in bauxite-rich allied nations and secure offtake agreements with Western mining companies. As an established ally, Australia would be an excellent partner for the United States to develop a bauxite-to-gallium refining pipeline. Guinea and Brazil are also potential partners for sourcing bauxite, and investing in the development of refineries can boost economic development in these states while decreasing dependence on China and minimizing the related supply chain vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;germanium&quot;&gt;Germanium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to its high electron mobility, germanium is a key material for high-speed transistors. Fiber-optic cable manufacturing accounts for one-third of germanium demand. Germanium wafers are high performing and can be found in computer processors, infrared detectors, communication systems, and radar systems. No alternatives to germanium exist without significant performance losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germanium is sourced as a byproduct of the processing of zinc ores; it does not occur as a natural metal. The Earth’s crust is only 1.5 ppm germanium, making the mineral one of the rarest metals on the periodic table. Countries with the greatest zinc reserves, aside from China, include Australia, Peru, and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world’s leading producer of refined germanium, China accounts for about 60 percent of global supply. Since imposing export restrictions last year, germanium prices have climbed over 70 percent, to $2,280 per kilogram. The United States produces some germanium from zinc mines in Tennessee and Alaska, but over half of its domestic consumption is imported, largely from China (53 percent), Belgium (22 percent), Germany (11 percent), and Russia (9 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germanium needs significant refining to become suitable material for semiconductors, and germanium refining infrastructure is currently dominated by China. Companies in the United States face significant hurdles in justifying investment in new refining capacity for germanium. Germanium refining is particularly expensive, as the metal needs to reach purity levels of over 99.999 percent. The process is not only costly, but technically challenging and energy intensive. While China manages to keep production costs low through reduced environmental and social safeguards, manufacturers outside of China have not been able to compete. Without the kind of government subsidies Chinese competitors have, U.S. companies will not be competitive in the face of higher labor and power costs, necessitating financial incentives to reduce the cost of doing business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;palladium&quot;&gt;Palladium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palladium is one of six platinum group metals (PGMs). Metals in this group are characterized by high melting points, heat and corrosion resistance, and catalytic properties. Palladium is used in the metal connections attaching chips to circuit boards, and palladium plating is used on semiconductors to ensure longevity and reliability. As semiconductors advance and chips become increasingly compact, the risk of oxidation and deterioration rises. Palladium’s durability and corrosion and oxidation resistance make it a crucial protective shield on chips to ensure their sustained performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States produces just 5 percent of the world’s palladium from its two operations in Montana, both owned by Sibanye Stillwater, a South African company. Domestic production represents just 16 percent of the nation’s consumption, leaving domestic industry reliant on imports from other palladium-rich nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia holds the world’s largest palladium reserves and produces over 40 percent of the world’s palladium from just two top-performing projects. In 2021, the United States imported 35 percent of its palladium from Russia. Following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration warned the semiconductor industry to diversify its palladium supply chains. Compounding matters, the World Platinum Investment Council predicts a 1.28 million ounce palladium deficit in 2024, equivalent to over one-third of Russia’s total production in 2022. These deficits are largely the result of supply issues as mine producers restructure in response to a period of suppressed prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa holds the world’s second-largest reserves of palladium, contributing 34 percent of the world’s production. The country’s largest venture, Mogalakwena, produces 6 percent of the world’s palladium and is owned by Anglo American, a UK company. The industry faces several challenges in South Africa, including rising production costs, energy and transport infrastructure failures, lack of permitting, labor disputes, and declining ore grades. South Africa ranked 62nd out of 84 jurisdictions in the 2021 Fraser Investment Attractiveness Index, one place below the Democratic Republic of the Congo and just above Ecuador. The index indicates that South Africa is not an attractive option for Western private sector investment because of the aforementioned risks without government-led incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total cash cost for mining one ounce of palladium in Mogalakwena is $590, compared to just $402 at Norilsk in Russia. With palladium prices down to just $923 per ounce, Russian palladium mining operations have a 56 percent greater profit margin than Anglo American’s project in South Africa. However, the South Africa mining operations are more economical than those in the United States. The Sibanye Stillwater palladium mine in Montana faces 2024 operating costs of $1,032 per ounce, greater than the current selling price of palladium. As current palladium prices make domestic mining operations untenable, the United States needs to be incentivizing investment in countries such as South Africa where operation costs will be more competitive with Russia and, therefore, projects will be more likely to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;silicon&quot;&gt;Silicon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silicon is the most important mineral for semiconductor manufacturing and is used to make silicon wafers, the largest portion of the semiconductor materials market. Integrated circuits with billions of transistors are squeezed onto less than a square inch of silicon. Although Japan and South Korea perform the majority of global silicon wafer manufacturing, China accounts for 79 percent of global raw silicon production and 75 percent of the ultra-high-purity polysilicon needed for semiconductors, demonstrating the need for polysilicon manufacturing in allied countries in order to diversify silicon sourcing and reduce potential supply disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silicon is the second-most common element in the Earth’s crust and is mined in open pits as silica sand. However, silicon is bound to oxygen, alumina, and magnesium, so it has to undergo extensive refining to extract silicon metal and produce high-purity polysilicon. In the early 2000s, an oligopoly of seven companies, known as the Seven Sisters and all located in the United States, Japan, and Germany, dominated the polysilicon market. Today, six companies dominate the global polysilicon supply — five out of those six companies are Chinese owned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses of gallium, germanium, palladium, and silicon supply chains highlight both the dominance of foreign adversaries in the production of these critical raw materials and the importance of commercially viable, Western mineral-refining projects. Building a resilient domestic semiconductor industry will require not only incentives and subsidies in downstream manufacturing, but also support to develop mining and refining capabilities in allied countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-from-the-ira-what-worked-to-incentivize-investments-in-ev-mineral-supply-chains&quot;&gt;Lessons from the IRA: What Worked to Incentivize Investments in EV Mineral Supply Chains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA was the Biden administration’s flagship legislation meant to incentivize the transition to clean energy and EVs. Several provisions created financial mechanisms to expand and strengthen critical mineral projects, including the Section 30D Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, the 48C Investment Tax Credit, the 45X Production Tax Credit, additional grant funding for the Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III program, and Department of Energy loan programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Section 30D New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit provides up to $7,500 in tax credits for qualifying EV purchases. To be eligible, vehicle manufacturers must meet several criteria, including sourcing requirements for critical minerals and components. As part of 30D, vehicles eligible for a $3,750 tax credit at purchase must: (1) ensure that 50 percent of critical minerals contained in EV batteries produced in 2024 (increasing to 80 percent by 2027) are extracted and processed in the United States, or a country with which the United States has a free trade agreement (FTA) or critical minerals agreement (CMA); and (2) do not contain any critical minerals extracted or processed by a Foreign Entity of Concern, such as China or Russia. To take advantage of the 30D program, EV manufacturers are looking to quickly diversify critical mineral supply chains away from China, but there is little evidence that Section 30D is actually driving mining companies to expand operations in FTA countries. Although lithium- and nickel-mining explorations in countries such as Australia and Canada have moderately increased in 2023, exploration in lithium-rich FTA countries, such as Chile, has stalled. At the same time, exploration in non-FTA countries, such as Argentina, has increased because it has a more favorable domestic investment policy climate. Without extending IRA benefits to Argentina, there is little incentive to export minerals to the United States instead of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some critical mineral projects may qualify for the IRA’s Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Investment Tax Credit (48C) or its Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit (45X). The 48C credit was renewed and expanded under the IRA with an additional $10 billion in funding. So far, the Department of Energy has announced $6 billion for projects investing in clean energy manufacturing as well as the refining, processing, and recycling of critical materials. Albemarle, Novonix, and MP Materials have all received the 48C Investment Tax Credit for their critical minerals projects. The 45X credit aims to spur domestic production capacity by offering a 10 percent tax credit to companies producing critical materials for EV battery manufacturing in the United States. These two credits are especially desired by the private sector, as they can be sold in exchange for cash. However, the credits are restricted to projects within the United States, limiting their reach; companies investing abroad — even in allied nations — largely do not qualify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the IRA included grant funding in the form of an additional $500 million toward DPA Title III grants, which provide financial support to critical mineral projects that protect, expand, or restore industrial base capabilities critical to national security. DPA Title III grants have so far been awarded for nickel production, lithium mining, graphite processing, rare earth element separating, and cobalt extraction feasibility studies in the United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the rollout of these programs has not been without criticism, the IRA has catalyzed investment in EV mineral supply chains. For example, Syrah Resources began production earlier this year of its natural graphite anode material facility in Vidalia, Louisiana, funded by the Department of Energy. The Vidalia processing facility will source graphite from Syrah Balama’s mining operations in Mozambique, originally funded through a loan from the U.S. Development Finance Corporation, creating the first fully vertically integrated supply chain for natural graphite anode materials outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chips-20-policy-recommendations-to-incentivize-investment-in-semiconductor-minerals-supply-chains&quot;&gt;CHIPS 2.0: Policy Recommendations to Incentivize Investment in Semiconductor Minerals Supply Chains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs a comprehensive legislative package that incentivizes private investments in projects at home and abroad aimed at securing, and ensuring, supplies of critical minerals for the semiconductor industry. As discussed, current supply chains for gallium, germanium, palladium, and silicon are highly dependent on foreign adversaries, leaving vital semiconductor supply chains vulnerable to supply disruptions that can bring significant economic consequences. Recommendations to create more resilient semiconductor supply chains include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initiate an Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for mineral processing and refining projects at sites with Western-allied mining operations.&lt;/strong&gt; Australia has significant bauxite and zinc reserves mined by Western mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Glencore. In 2022, Western companies mined 98 million metric tons of bauxite ore in Australia, accounting for nearly all of the country’s bauxite production and 24.5 percent of global production. However, a midstream vulnerability in this supply chain remains — this ore is being sent to China to be refined into gallium and germanium. Since Western companies are already controlling upstream bauxite mining, the United States needs to focus on securing the midstream processing and refining of bauxite into gallium. Therefore, the United States should offer incentives (including tax credits) to the private sector to encourage onsite, Western-controlled refining capabilities to close supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The IRA’s 48C Investment Tax Credit could be a good guidepost for this type of new tax credit, but the current program needs to be expanded to allow projects abroad to qualify. Western mining companies already own some of the largest mining projects in Peru, Guinea, South Africa, and Australia: Glencore controls the largest zinc mine in Peru, Rio Tinto owns bauxite mines in Guinea, and Anglo American possesses the largest palladium mine in South Africa. To ensure that bauxite and zinc are refined into gallium and germanium by a Western partner onsite — and not sent to China for refining — the United States should offer an investment tax credit for companies setting up refining projects that will work jointly with already established Western mining operations. These refining investments are critical to securing the entire mineral supply chain upstream and downstream.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fund a research and development laboratory to build the technological know-how for semiconductor-specific critical mineral refining.&lt;/strong&gt; Refining gallium, germanium, and silicon to needed purity levels of over 99 percent for the semiconductor industry requires specific technology, infrastructure, and know-how, all of which are currently lacking. The United States has only one company that refines high-purity gallium, one operation for refining germanium, and three companies producing high-purity polysilicon. In order to be competitive globally, the United States needs to innovate and ramp up production quickly to generate minerals in a more cost-effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Energy already funds laboratories focused on critical minerals for EVs and clean energy. For example, the Critical Minerals Innovation Hub at the Ames Laboratory and the Minerals and Materials Supply Chain Facility (METALLIC) bring together the expertise of several leading national laboratories to find solutions to critical minerals supply challenges for the EV industry. The Department of Commerce should fund similar initiatives focused on minerals for the semiconductor industry. If the United States wishes to build and expand critical mineral refining operations at home and abroad, it needs to invest in national laboratories that will develop the capabilities, technologies, and skills needed to produce refined semiconductor minerals at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subsidize price premiums to ensure Western companies can compete for offtake agreements.&lt;/strong&gt; Western-owned mining and refining operations face higher production costs than their Chinese and Russian competitors due to higher labor, energy, and environmental standards. For example, Anglo American’s cash costs to produce palladium in South Africa are 41 percent higher than Russia’s costs to do so domestically. Furthermore, China is investing in bauxite smelting facilities in Indonesia which run on coal, making them energy intensive and environmentally dirty, but inexpensive. Western companies looking to invest in bauxite refining in an environmentally responsible way do not have this option. As a result, these companies need to place a premium on their prices, making it difficult to compete for offtake agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government should offer a direct subsidy to U.S. semiconductor manufacturers to offset the price premium for Western-produced semiconductor minerals. This will incentivize chip producers to diversify from China and enter offtake agreements with Western mining and refining operations. Just as the $7,500 30D tax credit was designed to incentivize EV manufacturers to source critical minerals outside of China, chip manufacturers need to be incentivized through a subsidy to source gallium, germanium, palladium, and silicon from Western-allied sources despite the higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dedicate more DPA Title III funding toward projects focused on securing semiconductor mineral supply chains.&lt;/strong&gt; DPA Title III provides an upfront source of capital needed for the private sector to make investments in projects crucial to national security that they may be unable to finance otherwise. The Department of Defense has awarded funding to projects for EV minerals and for downstream semiconductor manufacturing, but no funding has been put toward the production of upstream gallium, germanium, palladium, or silicon. In 2023, a DPA Title III grant was awarded to Raytheon for military-grade GaN produced at its semiconductor foundry in Andover, Massachusetts. The project is a worthwhile investment, but in order to fully secure the supply chain, DPA funds need to be targeting projects that produce the refined and purified gallium needed for GaN, as this refining is currently dominated by China.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The DPA Title III program should also be expanded to include project development in more allied countries such as Australia, Japan, and member states of the European Union aimed at expanding potential reserves and refining capacity. Tables 2 and 3 illustrate how grant funding of projects in Australia, Canada, and Norway would be invaluable to securing critical supplies of gallium, germanium, palladium, and silicon. Considering how central semiconductors are to defense technologies, the use of DPA funds for critical minerals projects related to semiconductors should be prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;target-countries-for-critical-minerals-investments-to-secure-semiconductor-supply-chains&quot;&gt;Target Countries for Critical Minerals Investments to Secure Semiconductor Supply Chains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States builds alternative supply chains for gallium, germanium, palladium, and silicon outside of China, it also needs to target countries for investment that are mineral rich and allied with U.S. interests and that offer economically viable and cost-effective opportunities. Because China and Russia hold significant reserves of vital commodities and are top producers of bauxite, zinc, palladium, and silicon, it is vital for the United States to partner with mineral-rich allies that can compete with foreign adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To secure the bauxite needed for gallium production, the United States should be encouraging Western investment in Australia and Guinea. Australia is currently the top global producer of bauxite, but China is close behind, despite having just 14 percent of Australia’s bauxite reserves. This indicates that there is significant opportunity to increase Australia’s total production. Furthermore, Australia is currently sending 97 percent of its bauxite to China, allowing the latter to dominate the refining of bauxite into high-purity gallium. Similarly, although Guinea holds the world’s largest bauxite reserves and is responsible for nearly 65 percent of the globe’s exports, the country sends over 80 percent of its bauxite to China. DPA Title III funds should be leveraged for Australian refining projects, and projects in both Australia and Guinea should be eligible for the investment tax credit. This will give the private sector an influx of cash to boost gallium production from Australian and Guinean bauxite ores under Western control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and Peru will be key allies for securing zinc deposits for germanium production. Australia holds the world’s largest zinc reserves, estimated to be double the size of China’s, but currently has less than one-third of China’s output. Peru has more modest reserves — about one-quarter the size of Australia’s — but currently produces more zinc than Australia. DPA Title III and the ITC can free up capital for investments in Australian and Peruvian zinc and germanium projects while national laboratories build the expertise and innovative technologies needed to drive successful germanium refineries outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa’s palladium reserves will be key to countering Russia’s lead in the commodity, with Canada as a strong secondary resource. South Africa and Russia both produce about 40 percent of world’s palladium (see Table 3), despite South Africa holding less than half the reserves of Russia. South Africa also has the distinct advantage of an open trade regime and a strong U.S. business presence; as the largest U.S. trade partner in Africa, approximately 600 U.S. businesses operate there. The U.S.-South African trade relationship is united under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), and a bilateral tax treaty. Still, the mining sector in South Africa faces a number of challenges in attracting needed investment. High production costs and the risks of doing business in South Africa discourage potential Western investors. Implementing the ITC and direct price subsidies could offset some of these risks and encourage more Western palladium mining projects in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, silicon production should be further supported in Brazil and Norway, which currently account for 5 percent and 4 percent of global silicon production, respectively (see Table 3). China has a formidable lead in silicon production, necessitating further investment in Brazilian and Norwegian silicon projects. To establish alternative silicon supply chains for the semiconductor industry, policymakers should leverage: (1) DPA Title III funds for silicon refining in Norway; (2) the ITC for production in Brazil; (3) direct subsidies to put prices on a more competitive footing with less-expensive Chinese materials; and (4) a national laboratory to further research and development in purified polysilicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply chains for semiconductor critical minerals are fraught with vulnerabilities, as China and other U.S. adversaries continue to dominate the mining and refining of gallium, germanium, palladium, and silicon. Meanwhile, U.S. policymakers have so far done little to incentivize diversification of these supply chains by the private sector. The semiconductor industry needs a set of tax incentives and funding programs to spur the private sector, just as the IRA spurred investments in EV mineral supply chains. To address supply chain vulnerabilities, policymakers should prioritize: (1) creating an investment tax credit for processing and refining projects; (2) opening national laboratories focused on semiconductor mineral research and development; (3) expanding eligibility for DPA Title III grants; and (4) offering direct subsidies to encourage offtake agreements with Western companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing debate within the United States over whether to pursue a clear “end state” in its China policy or focus on managing the competition reflects a crucial divide in American strategic thinking. As tensions with China deepen, U.S. policymakers and experts are wrestling with the question of how best to navigate this evolving rivalry. One camp argues that the United States must articulate definitive long-term goals to safeguard U.S. interests and shape the future global order. The opposing view contends that given the inherent uncertainties of China’s political trajectory and the volatility of global events, it may be wiser for the United States to adopt a more flexible approach, one that emphasizes managing the competition rather than locking in a fixed endpoint. This debate strikes at the heart of how the United States should engage its most formidable challenger in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report brings together more than 20 leading scholars from the United States and its allies and partners to examine this debate, analyzing both the strategic necessity and the historical context of the U.S.-China rivalry. Understanding today’s debate requires a longer view — one that places contemporary issues within the broader sweep of history. The United States and China have been grappling with each other for over 150 years, navigating a relationship that has been characterized by both cooperation and intense competition. It is against this historical backdrop that the current tensions must be understood, and it is in this context that the necessity of a clear “end state” or the prudence of ongoing management must be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of U.S.-China relations stretches back to the mid-nineteenth century, beginning with the Treaty of Wanghia in 1844. This treaty, signed following the Opium Wars, marked the first formal diplomatic agreement between the United States and China. While it opened trade and established American rights in Chinese ports, it also reflected the unequal power dynamics of the time, as China was forced into concessions by Western powers. The treaty laid the foundation for a relationship rooted in commercial interests but shaped by geopolitical rivalry and strategic distrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late nineteenth century saw the United States play a unique role in China through initiatives such as the Open Door Policy, which sought to guarantee U.S. access to the Chinese market and to prevent European powers from carving up China into spheres of influence. American leaders argued that all nations should have equal access to Chinese markets, not only as a matter of economic interest but as a principle of fairness. Yet, despite this seemingly benign policy, the United States was still driven by its own strategic goals, attempting to secure influence in China without resorting to colonialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This early period of interaction demonstrates a key feature of U.S.-China relations that persists today: a tension between cooperation and competition, between engagement and self-interest. Even as the United States worked to protect China from European colonialism, it was also seeking to assert its own influence. This duality has been a recurring theme in U.S.-China relations, from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which reflected rising racial and economic anxieties, to the 1940s, when China became a crucial ally in the fight against Imperial Japan during World War II. As both nations evolved, so too did the stakes of their engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to the Cold War, and the competition between the United States and China took on new dimensions. Following the communist revolution in 1949, China became a central player in the global ideological struggle between capitalism and communism. America’s containment strategy, largely focused on the Soviet Union, extended to China, particularly after the Korean War. But despite decades of isolation and hostility, both countries eventually found common ground when President Richard Nixon opened the door to U.S.-China engagement in 1972, seeing China as a counterbalance to Soviet power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This period of rapprochement, however, did not resolve the underlying strategic tensions. Rather, it temporarily aligned the two powers’ interests in the face of a common adversary. Once the Cold War ended, the United States embraced a strategy of engagement, hoping that China’s integration into the global economy would lead to a “mellowing” of Chinese behavior and its evolution into a stakeholder in the international order. For a time, this strategy appeared to be working, as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) released its grasp on the economy, providing space for millions of Chinese citizens to work their way out of poverty. At the same time, China’s political institutions began to evolve out of their Soviet-Maoist straightjacket. Yet, by the early twenty-first century, it became clear that China’s leadership was growing wary of Western economic and political models. Instead, they pursued a strategy of authoritarian resilience, pairing economic growth with military power and political control under the CCP, particularly under the leadership of Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States faces a China that is more powerful, more confident, and more assertive on the world stage. Whether through economic statecraft, military modernization, or technological innovation, China seeks to reshape the global order in ways that challenge U.S. dominance. The strategic competition is no longer confined to military or economic realms; it extends into cyberspace, technological innovation, and even the narratives that shape global governance. As U.S. policymakers debate whether to define a clear “end state” or simply manage this competition, they must do so with a keen understanding of this historical trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of this report’s contributors see economic, technological, and military friction as a likely enduring feature of the U.S.-China relationship, at least until change in China’s political trajectory opens up space for a different type of relationship. This near-consensus among the contributors, one that I share, is a tragedy for the respective populations of the United States, China, and, indeed, the entire world. Instead of these two great nations pooling their considerable economic resources and human talent to jointly address the world’s many growing challenges, they lock horns in a multifaceted strategic competition. The blunt reality is that because of these deep divisions, there will be diseases that will not be cured, there will be children who will unnecessarily suffer, and our climate will continue to degrade as opportunities for global cooperation slip through humanity’s fingers. The mutual mistrust and strategic rivalry between the United States and China create barriers to innovation, collaboration, and the bold, unified action needed to tackle existential threats. In this fractured global landscape, the pursuit of dominance and security overshadows the shared responsibility to steward a livable future for all, leaving the world worse off.&lt;/p&gt;

Kissinger Distinguished Professor, Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies; Senior Fellow, American Enterprise Institute&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China competition has begun, but how will it end? There is a bipartisan consensus that Sino-American relations will be defined primarily by rivalry across multiple regions and dimensions of statecraft for years to come. Yet there is little clarity on what will happen after that. Washington has accepted, under both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the reality of competition without identifying a theory of victory — which means that U.S. leaders have yet to articulate how rivalry will lead to something other than unremitting tension and danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marks a contrast to the United States’ Cold War experience. By 1947, U.S. officials — principally George Kennan — argued that if Washington held the line against Soviet expansion, while selectively exerting counterpressure, the Soviet system would either eventually collapse from its own internal weaknesses or evolve into something less threatening. It took time for this thesis to gain widespread acceptance; in the early 1950s, the Eisenhower administration considered preventive war and aggressive rollback as alternative solutions to the Soviet challenge. But over time, Kennan’s theory of victory directed the United States’ approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many conceivable outcomes to the present Sino-American competition, ranging from the United States ceding a sphere of influence to China, to mutual accommodation, to Chinese collapse, and even to a devastating global conflict. Yet if the goal of competition is to secure a better peace by means short of war, then the pivotal question becomes whether the United States can achieve this outcome by changing the minds of present or future Chinese leaders — convincing them that expansion and aggrandizement is futile — or whether it will require the decline of Chinese power or the downfall of the Communist Party. In short, can Sino-American tensions turn into competitive coexistence, as some Biden administration officials have suggested? Or must this clash culminate in regime failure, via the weakening or political evolution of the United States’ challenger? U.S. officials should certainly hope for the first outcome. They should probably prepare for the second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-new-consensus&quot;&gt;The New Consensus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, a consensus has emerged in Washington: the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is seeking to regain China’s historic place as the dominant power in Asia (and perhaps globally) and is pursuing a comprehensive strategy — economic, technological, diplomatic, and military — to attain this end. Beijing is seeking to upend, perhaps forcibly, the favorable balance of power that the United States has long enjoyed in the Western Pacific while challenging U.S. technological, economic, and diplomatic leadership globally. As a result, the Trump and Biden administrations have largely abandoned the idea of using engagement and inducement to integrate China into — and make it a stakeholder in — the liberal international order and have focused on penalizing Beijing’s revisionist behavior instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this consensus is more superficial than it initially seems. There remain major debates about the degree to which China is an ideological rival, whether China is a peaking power whose economic strength will soon begin (in relative terms) to decline, when and under what circumstances Xi Jinping might be willing to use military force, and how thorough an economic decoupling or de-risking the United States should seek. Furthermore, the U.S. government has yet to clearly and consistently articulate its view of how competition will produce a better and more stable status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At several points — namely in a speech by then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in July 2020 and in documents issued by the National Security Council and the Department of State’s Policy Planning Staff that same year — the Trump administration argued that competition with China was caused by the nature of the Communist Party. This assertion implied that the rivalry would last as long as the regime itself. Yet the administration also insisted, on various occasions, that its approach was “not premised on determining a particular end state for China” or “on an attempt to change the PRC’s domestic governance model.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its early months, the Biden administration adopted the overall framework of strategic competition with China — “extreme competition,” as the president initially phrased it, before tempering that description by terming the relationship as one of “healthy competition” instead — without fully clarifying its view of how that competition might ultimately be resolved. There are two basic possibilities: competitive coexistence or regime failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;competitive-coexistence&quot;&gt;Competitive Coexistence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advocates of competitive coexistence believe the United States can eventually change the minds of Chinese leaders — if not Xi then perhaps those who come after him — convincing them not to forcibly contest the balance of power in Asia and upset the liberal international order in that region and beyond. The idea is that if Washington shows, over some sustained period, that it can preserve a favorable military balance in the Western Pacific, preserve its economic and technological advantages, and rally overlapping coalitions of states to push back against Chinese coercion, then Beijing might conclude that its current course is self-defeating and adopt a less bellicose stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would not lead to perfect harmony. U.S.-China relations would still have strong elements of military, geopolitical, economic, technological, and diplomatic competition. But Beijing would presumably pull back a bit on issues — such as Taiwan and the U.S. alliance structure in East Asia — where U.S. vital interests are at stake. The end state, whether enshrined in a formal diplomatic settlement or simply arrived at through tacit geopolitical bargaining, would be a more stable relationship in which the danger of war recedes, the United States’ key strategic interests are preserved, and areas of potential cooperation can gradually expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competitive coexistence updates, but does not discard, the logic of U.S. policy toward China in the post-Cold War era. It holds that Washington can still shape Chinese behavior through the proper mix of incentives, although the United States will rely significantly more on pressure and dissuasion, meant to inhibit China from doing disruptive things, and far less on positive inducements aimed at making it a responsible stakeholder. Competitive coexistence rests on the idea that the CCP may mellow over time; even if Xi Jinping has chosen confrontation, perhaps his successors will take a more moderate tack. Indeed, the more effectively the United States pushes back against disruptive Chinese behavior during Xi’s rule — that is, the more it shows that Chinese coercion and aggression will lead to counterpressure and isolation — the more likely it is that a future generation of Chinese leaders will conclude it is in their interest to de-escalate the rivalry with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is appealing because it offers strategic success without requiring the downfall of one of the competitors. Yet it also invites a series of questions that proponents of competitive coexistence have yet to persuasively answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: Does the fact that Beijing has become so assertive, not just regionally but globally, over the past 15 years indicate that any significant softening of China’s policies may be many years in the future? Indeed, if Xi retains power as long as Mao did — until the age of 82 — then a post-Xi leadership would not emerge until 2036. (If he lives as long as Deng Xiaoping did — until the age of 92 — a leadership transition would not occur for another generation.) In addition, how could U.S. officials be sure whether the CCP made a strategic decision for moderation or as a tactical decision meant to temporarily reduce tensions in hopes of splitting its opponents or inducing the United States to lower its guard? After all, this is often what Soviet leaders had in mind when they spoke of “peaceful coexistence” in the 1950s. When U.S. officials declined to accept a détente on Soviet terms, a terrifying period of high tensions followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with competitive coexistence is that it does not seem to reflect the reality of U.S.-China relations. This approach holds that the rivalry between the United States and China is severe but not immutable. In other words, a powerful CCP-led China can eventually be reconciled to a world order in which the United States, its allies and partners, and its democratic values remain predominant. Yet what if that belief is illusory because the rivalry is more deeply rooted, more fundamental? What if the CCP desires a more thorough revision of the international order because it views a liberal system led by a democratic superpower as an existential threat to its own survival?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is substantial evidence to suggest that this is the case. Sino-American tensions may have risen under Xi Jinping, but Rush Doshi has shown that those tensions reflect something far more profound than the soaring ambitions of a single statesman. Leading Chinese officials have publicly affirmed the party’s view that the United States has always been committed to undermining, even overthrowing, the Communist regime. “From the Chinese perspective,” former diplomat Fu Ying wrote in 2020, “the U.S. has never given up its intent to overthrow the socialist system led by the Communist Party of China.” Even at the height of Sino-American cooperation during the 1980s, Deng alleged that Washington was prosecuting a “smokeless World War III” against the CCP. Sinologist Nadège Rolland argues that the party cannot reconcile itself to an international order whose liberal principles conflict directly with the government’s illiberal rule. Even in the early 1990s, when the United States was betting big on engagement with China, some Chinese military officials argued that it was “impossible to fundamentally improve Sino-U.S. relations.” Xi himself has more recently suggested that the United States is bent on the “containment” and “suppression” of his country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Win-win” rhetoric aside, the CCP is governed by a fundamentally zero-sum mindset which bodes ill for long-term strategic accommodation. Moreover, the party’s increasingly coercive behavior vis-à-vis Taiwan and other Asian democracies, its horrifying crimes against its Uyghur population, and its utterly cynical and irresponsible conduct at the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic demonstrate how fundamentally the regime’s concept of self-interest diverges from anything acceptable to the United States and other liberal democracies. Today, far from preparing for détente, Xi’s government is hoarding food and fuel, churning out weapons, and making moves that suggest it may be preparing for war. In view of all this, the United States needs to reckon with the possibility that acute Sino-American antagonism will persist so long as a powerful China is governed by the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regime-failure&quot;&gt;Regime Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, then even a long period of vigorous competition by the United States would not bring about a mellowing of the CCP. Instead, the rivalry could persist in a fairly intense form until the party loses its ability to prosecute that rivalry. This could happen due to either a decline in Chinese power or a fundamental change in the nature of the ruling regime. In this scenario, competition would not be a relatively short bridge to a more stable relationship, but rather a longer bridge to the collapse of China’s power or the transformation of its government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to this theory, what will end the Sino-American competition is the accumulated effects of the profound internal problems China confronts, combined with consistent external resistance. If the United States and its friends can check China’s aggrandizement, then the combination of slowing growth, a slow-motion demographic catastrophe, an increasingly stifling and unresponsive political system, and other internal flaws could eventually produce a marked decline in China’s ability to challenge the international order. Beijing’s hostility to the United States could become less strategically problematic, even if hostility persists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the same pressures could eventually cause an evolution in Chinese governance, either toward democracy or simply toward a less toxic form of tyranny. In either case, the United States’ task would be to hold the line geopolitically — while perhaps marginally increasing the stresses on Chinese power and governance — until these internal processes play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are grim scenarios because the regime-failure scenario echoes an experience — the Cold War — that no sober analyst wishes to relive. The regime-failure theory also raises serious questions. A CCP that fears its power or control is slipping could become more aggressive, in hopes of locking in gains while it still can. If the United States uses offensive measures to increase the strains on Chinese power or on the Chinese regime — such as technological denial policies meant to keep Beijing well behind in the economic and military race — it could ratchet up tensions and dangers in the relationship. And critically, the United States simply does not know, at this point, whether the combination of external resistance and pressure would accelerate the decay of the CCP — or help it hang on by stoking Chinese nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, this approach is not as radical as it might initially sound. It need not involve actively seeking regime change any more than the United States’ containment strategy actively sought to overthrow the rulers of the Kremlin. Back then, “regime failure” or “regime mellowing” was more of a long-term aspiration than a near-term operational objective. This approach also does not require abandoning diplomacy any more than containment precluded cooperation on arms control, nuclear non-proliferation, or global public health during the Cold War. What it requires, simply, is accepting that the nature of the CCP imposes severe limitations on how much the relationship can improve, so long as the party retains power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;who-cares&quot;&gt;Who Cares?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, another question: Why should U.S. officials spend their time speculating about long-term theories of victory in a competition that is just getting underway? Indeed, given how dangerous that competition can be on a day-to-day basis, there is a certain argument for simply focusing on handling China in the here and now, while deferring intellectual debates about the distant future. This is, in fact, the approach that some key U.S. officials seem to favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this would be a mistake. Strategy involves determining how actions taken today will lead to the achievement of distant objectives. Different theories of victory might produce different conceptions of what roles bilateral diplomacy and offensive pressure should play in U.S. statecraft. Moreover, if the United States does not know where it is going, how can Americans tell if it is getting anywhere? And if rivalry with China is indeed the fundamental challenge for U.S. strategy, does the U.S. government not owe the American people an answer to the question of where this all may lead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, it is hard to conclusively say which theory of victory is analytically dominant, because both theories hinge on judgments that are necessarily prospective and somewhat tentative. But in my view, the balance of evidence supports the more pessimistic theory — that competition will ultimately be resolved through changes in Chinese power or in the way China is governed. That is a dark view of where Sino-American competition is headed. Yet if the rivalry is as fundamental as CCP leaders seem to think, and as Xi himself sometimes says, then that view may also be the most realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this conclusion leads to a final problem. Right now, the theory of victory that holds together analytically may not be the theory of victory that best holds the counter-China coalition together. A multilateral strategy is necessary to check Chinese power. As the United States has seen in recent years, this requires assembling multiple, overlapping coalitions to balance Beijing militarily, economically, technologically, and ideologically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden team, in my view, has done fairly well in this task. But there is no denying that the rallying of these coalitions is often complicated by the fact that many U.S. allies and partners, in Asia, Europe, and elsewhere, have little appetite for a zero-sum slugfest between Washington and Beijing. Few of these countries — even the United States’ closest allies — would welcome a U.S. strategy that explicitly seeks regime failure. Indeed, just talking about such a strategy in public makes many U.S. allies nervous. So, it is understandable that there has remained so much ambiguity in Washington’s assessments of where the rivalry is going, because the truth may be something that no one particularly wants to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no easy escape from this dilemma. Eventually, the U.S. government must be candid about its China strategy. There is no way to rally the domestic commitment and resources necessary to succeed if U.S. officials are not honest about the underlying problem. Democracies cannot have one strategic agenda in private and a second one for public and international consumption. In the near term, there may be good reasons to highlight the practical aspects of building the coalitions needed to counter China while downplaying the more sensitive question of how this might all end. But over the longer term, it is hard to see how the United States can win the defining rivalry of this century without being clear about what it is trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs a China strategy that maintains security in the short term and presents a vision of success in the long term. Recent U.S. approaches have focused on either the former or the latter, without a clear strategy for integrating them together. This essay suggests a different framework — a phased strategy that overlays objectives with distinct timeframes. A phased approach of this sort is the only option around which policymakers can build a lasting and bipartisan consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;extreme-end-states&quot;&gt;Extreme End States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wide range of views on China within the United States makes characterizing the overall debate difficult. Yet the extreme positions on the United States’ China strategy are relatively clear: coevolution or regime change. Neither is likely to attract sufficient support, for reasons explained below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years, a cadre of U.S. experts promoted a strategy aimed at making China more like the United States and bringing it more fully into the international order. The end state envisioned by advocates of this approach was to make China a “responsible stakeholder” in the existing order rather than a threat to that system. Henry Kissinger labeled this “co-evolution” and explained it as an effort in which “both countries pursue their domestic imperatives, cooperating where possible, and adjust their relations to minimize conflict. Neither side endorses all the aims of the other or presumes a total identity of interests, but both sides seek to identify and develop complementary interests.” This approach enjoyed broad bipartisan support for several decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, over the last 15 years — and especially since Xi Jinping took over as general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 2012 — it became clear that China was not converging with the United States. As a result, Beijing is unlikely to become a responsible stakeholder in the existing system anytime soon, if at all. Xi has sketched out a vision of China as a challenger to the United States, rather than a partner. Although Beijing’s vision of an alternative order has not come into focus — at least not yet — Chinese leaders proposed elements of an alternative system in the 20th Party Congress in 2022, as well as through the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, and Global Civilization Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it has become increasingly clear that China will not follow the path that some in the United States have hoped, experts from both parties have suggested that Washington should take a different approach to Beijing. Some have called for the “end of engagement,” while others have called for an era of “strategic competition.” Few observers, however, have laid out a clear alternative end state to U.S-China coevolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small group of academics and China experts favor a turn toward a policy of accommodation in order to ensure that China’s rise does not lead to conflict. Charlie Glaser, for example, has suggested that an alteration of U.S. policy on Taiwan might be sufficient to satisfy Beijing. Others have urged the United States and its allies and partners to give China more breathing room in the Western Pacific, which could help “meet China halfway.” This, however, appears unlikely to succeed given that Obama-era engagement efforts largely came to naught. Perhaps more importantly, there is little political support for these efforts in Washington today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative end state favored in some more hawkish circles is to actively undermine the CCP and accelerate processes that could bring down the regime. But it remains unclear whether the United States has enough influence within China to genuinely threaten the CCP’s hold on power. More importantly, even if this was possible, doing so might not be in the United States’ interest, given the possibility that U.S.-instigated regime change could backfire and lead to even more confrontation. Moreover, it remains unclear whether a post-CCP government in China would be more cooperative with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, although there are some who would advocate for end states of either coevolution or regime change, the bulk of observers in Washington find these alternatives unappealing and desire a third way. This is precisely what the Biden administration has attempted to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unsatisfying-steady-states&quot;&gt;Unsatisfying Steady States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that neither of these end states has robust political support in the United States, the Biden administration and many Democrats have jettisoned discussion of end states altogether. Instead, they have embraced an approach focused on establishing a stable “steady state” with China. Shortly before returning to government, current deputy secretary of state Kurt Campbell advocated turning “from end states to steady states across military, economic, political, and global governance domains to find a form of evolving and complex co-existence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden team has asserted that the best way to shape regional dynamics is by deepening Asian alliances and partnerships — its strategy therefore has revolved less around China’s future than around that of the United States and its friends. The thinking is that Washington has less ability to influence Beijing’s actions than commonly perceived, so U.S. policymakers should focus on things they can control. With this in mind, the Biden team put forward a three-part China strategy, which it calls “invest, align, compete.” The core idea is that investing in the United States and aligning with allies and partners will put the United States in a better position to compete with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the lack of a clear objective with regard to the preferred end state of their China policy has been a recurring problem for advocates of the Biden administration’s approach. Although it is tempting to do away with end states altogether, it is hard to convince the U.S. public to make great sacrifices for a competition with no end. Though Republicans have started making this critique more directly in recent months, political leaders from both sides of the aisle talk explicitly about winning, not just competing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true even of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. In the foreword to his administration’s National Security Strategy, Biden pledged to “win the competition for the 21st century.” In his last State of the Union speech, Biden was more explicit, promising to “win the competition for the 21st century against China.” Vice President Kamala Harris has made similar remarks, committing in her Democratic National Convention speech that “America, not China, wins the competition.” These remarks suggest that political leaders in the United States believe that the U.S. public wants to “win” rather than simply “compete,” regardless of what their advisers put in policymaking documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question that remains is whether the United States can identify an end state with regard to China that can win broad political support. Many Republicans are more willing to tolerate short-term instability if it puts the United States on a better long-term pathway vis-à-vis China. This case was made by then secretary of state Mike Pompeo when he referenced Richard Nixon in arguing, “we simply cannot afford to leave China forever outside of the family of nations. . . . The world cannot be safe until China changes. Thus, our aim — to the extent we can, we must influence events. Our goal should be to induce change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view has generally been an outlier among Republican policymakers. Although politicians may talk openly about accelerating the downfall of the CCP, few leaders embrace those statements when put into positions of power. Donald Trump’s White House guidance on China strategy was explicit that “United States policies are not premised on an attempt to change the PRC’s domestic governance model.” Other Trump administration officials have continued to insist that the United States should signal to China that U.S. policy is to maintain the status quo when it comes to the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observers are thus left with three basic options — coevolution, regime change, or sustained competition — none of which alone can win sufficient support across the political spectrum to be sustainable from one administration to the next. The end states of coevolution and regime change are too extreme to attract bipartisan support. Steady-state competition is more palatable, but Republicans find it unsatisfying and even Democratic political leaders say their aim is to win, not just compete. The U.S. strategic community must do better than these three options — and it can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-phased-approach&quot;&gt;A Phased Approach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there is a way to combine elements of all three concepts into a coherent strategy — it just requires a phased approach. Phasing would differentiate between short- and long-term objectives, acknowledging that the situation which exists today will not last forever and, therefore, could make more appealing end states possible at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the short term, the United States is unlikely to fundamentally alter China’s basic path. U.S. policies can certainly influence China’s decisions on the margins. But at the moment, the best Washington can do is to build strength at home and partnerships abroad in order to demonstrate to Xi that he cannot overturn the existing order through the use or threat of force. In other words, U.S. policies designed to put the United States on a stronger competitive footing should win broad partisan support for the moment. This short-term period is likely to last at least as long as Xi remains in power — possibly the next 10–20 years. Both patience and firmness will be required during this period to avoid a conflict while demonstrating to China that aggression will not pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, in the long term, it is only natural for the U.S. public to expect that a strategy requiring substantial resource expenditures will bring about a more lasting resolution. Xi Jinping’s eventual departure as general secretary could create an opportunity to reset the U.S.-China relationship. Optimists will no doubt hold out hope for a new set of leaders in China more open to genuine cooperation with the United States. Pessimists will think this unlikely and instead envision the people of China demanding political reforms from within once Xi is gone. This could even bring about more fundamental changes in China’s domestic governance system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policymakers need not make this choice for the Chinese people. It is critical that U.S. experts differentiate between forceful regime change, which is commonly viewed as brought about from outside, and regime failure, which emerges from a government’s own internal breakdowns. U.S. leaders can talk openly about the latter without suggesting that they endorse the former. Indeed, the United States did exactly this in the Cold War and it did not bring about a third world war in the twenty-first century. Acknowledging the CCP’s flaws need not be inflammatory, particularly since many Chinese citizens are growing increasingly frustrated with aspects of their own government’s decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be acknowledged that a phased approach is not an entirely new strategy. The long-term options presented here might be termed “mellowing or breakup” — indeed, that is what George Kennan labeled them when discussing just this sort of strategy with respect to the Soviet Union. Kennan did not insist that mellowing or breaking up should — or could — happen at the outset of the Cold War. Rather, he acknowledged that the United States would only prevail over the Soviet Union when the Communist Party’s own flaws manifested. The same is true of the CCP today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate around the long-term objectives for U.S. China strategy is intensifying. Does the United States need a definitive “end state” for its competition with China, or is a “steady state” of competition on terms favorable to Washington more realistic? Would either even be enough, or is the focus on the long-term academic when the short-term challenge is so urgent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often what should be a strategic debate breaks down, becoming merely conceptual and semantic. So, for the sake of clarity, “end states” in this context should be understood as a specific vision for how a rivalry ends, be it by war, grand bargains, regime change, or mutual agreement. A “steady state,” in contrast, assumes rivalry is more likely to persist than it is to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving a steady state is not about what kind of bilateral relationship Washington wants from Beijing, nor is it about the kind of government Americans want for China. The assumption behind a steady state is that there is no exit from this rivalry that is realistic, achievable, or acceptable and around which U.S. policymakers could prudently strategize. A steady state instead revolves around an affirmative vision of which interests the United States should secure and what order it should build in a world where competition with China is a condition to be managed rather than a problem to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many proponents of an end state tout its benefits for mobilizing the U.S. public or for reassuring Beijing. But they then fail to put forward an end state that anyone could support. Moreover, they overlook the fact that steady states — when defined with adequate detail — can also work like end states to mobilize or to reassure. When compared with the obvious end states for rivalry, steady states are the only realistic anchor for U.S. strategy. Accordingly, the debate should focus less on how rivalry ends, which the United States cannot control, and more on defining and framing steady states in a world where rivalry continues — all with an eye toward mobilizing Americans, reducing misperceptions, and properly guiding strategy in a future U.S. administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-assessments-new-debates&quot;&gt;New Assessments, New Debates&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not coincidental that this debate on strategy has intensified as the national consensus on China has shifted. Many in the analytic and policy community believe — as I’ve argued previously — that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) seeks to displace the current order led by the United States and its allies and partners, first at the regional level and now at the global level. They see the PRC preparing to defeat the United States in a protracted military conflict over Taiwan while also pursuing global military bases; working to dominate technologies critical to the “fourth industrial revolution”; increasing the world’s dependence on China while decreasing China’s dependence on the world; and aligning with Russia, Iran, and North Korea to challenge U.S.-led order. On all sides of the political spectrum, growing numbers of analysts frame this competition as a new Cold War, albeit one fundamentally different from the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some disagree with these assessments, for now, the center of gravity has shifted. The Biden administration, for example, declared China as the only state with the intent to reshape the international order and as having the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The darkening national assessment about the scale of China’s challenge has led to greater discomfort — even alarm — over the idea that this competition might have no foreseeable end point. This has intensified the question of what the end state for U.S. strategy should be and whether a focus on a “steady state” is sufficient as many analysts look for an exit to rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;no-exit&quot;&gt;No Exit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, great power rivalries end in only a few ways, and none offer a realistic escape from the current U.S.-China competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, rivalries can end in war. Yet no serious analyst would propose that the United States could or should seek to militarily subjugate or occupy a nuclear-armed great power to end a strategic rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, they can end with a formal grand bargain. This might mean conceding a sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific to China in exchange for the PRC perhaps committing not to use force in the region, including against Taiwan, and accepting the U.S. regional presence. But trading such stark and irreversible U.S. concessions for speculative benefits is foolish, especially if it closes off the world’s most dynamic region to PRC hegemony. And in any case, the competition is global, too, spanning most regions of the world and most functional policy domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, rivalries can end with the collapse of one party. Some writers have hinted that this is the end state that the United States should pursue with regard to the PRC. But doing so makes the competition dangerously more existential than it is now. Moreover, it is unlikely to succeed in any case, and it may just as easily leave the United States with a more aggressive — and still potent — rival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, some strategists, such as the RAND Corporation’s Michael J. Mazarr, have made the innovative point that rivalries can end by mutual agreement. For example, Britain and France set aside their hostility to deal with a rising Germany. This threat of a rising third power, however, has no analogy in the current U.S.-China rivalry, and transnational challenges, such as climate change, are unlikely to fill that gap. More broadly, given the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s nationalist objectives, Leninist ideology, and deeply rooted paranoia, Beijing is unlikely to exit rivalry due to overt U.S. pressure. Any such exit “will have to emerge organically from Beijing’s own thinking,” which is precisely why this end state cannot serve as a basis for strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, some analysts reject the preceding four end states and propose an intriguing phased approach. Zack Cooper from the American Enterprise Institute, for example, acknowledges the need for steady states in the short term but believes it necessary to articulate that the United States is “waiting for regime failure” even as it does not pursue “forcible regime change.” This idea of explicitly phasing objectives is interesting and similar to George Kennan’s recommendations in the Cold War, and it could be workable. But any strategy that posits Beijing’s collapse as the United States’ end goal would lead Beijing to see all U.S. actions as part of a cohesive strategy to bring down the CCP. The distinctions between short-term steady states and long-term visions of victory would merely exist in the minds of American strategists. And an approach that declares an interest in regime failure, but then opts to wait for it, would incur the costs of a seemingly provocative end state without necessarily having implications for U.S. policy or for mobilizing Americans. Nonetheless, a phased approach with different ends might provide a plausible path for structuring U.S. strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the four end states above are unrealistic, and phased approaches cannot necessarily avoid the downsides of the end states they are associated with, then what path remains for a rivalry to end that proponents of end states could support?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-critiques-of-steady-states&quot;&gt;The Critiques of Steady States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than answer this question with a clearly defined and realistic end state, many proponents of end states elide it. They instead conflate this debate with other questions: how should U.S. strategy be framed so that it can motivate the U.S. people? How tough should it be practically? Their arguments demonstrate that they see end states not as a strategic device but rather as a political or rhetorical one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two broad camps on opposite sides of the policy spectrum thinking in these terms. Neither puts forward a clear and distinct end state, but each instead offers critiques of steady states that are in reality merely criticisms of other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first camp is uncomfortable with the idea that rivalry is more likely to endure than to end and seeks an end state that can mobilize the U.S. public for what increasingly resembles a cold war. But this is a political argument rather than a strategic one. Mike Gallagher, the clearest proponent of this view, writes that “strategic competition with China will be difficult and expensive” and “American leaders must convince their constituents to sacrifice.” He goes on to indicate the need for an end state because “nobody wants to sacrifice much in pursuit of “managed competition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it is unclear which end state would mobilize Americans. It is hard to imagine invocations to pursue war, grand bargains, regime collapse, or mutual exit that would mobilize Americans in peacetime competition. Left unstated in these kinds of critique is what the end state should be. Gallagher admirably puts forward an answer, citing Kennan’s “Long Telegram” as providing an end state in the “break-up” or “mellowing” of Soviet power. But only the former is an end state, while the latter is in fact a steady state assuming competition continues. Similarly, when Gallagher approvingly cites the Biden administration’s objective of “building a balance of influence in the world that is maximally favorable to United States [and] our allies and partners” as “something approximating a long-term objective,” he is once again supporting a steady state. This objective — which continues to animate U.S. policy from export controls to shifts in posture to coordination on tariffs — assumes that rivalry persists and that the United States should try to shape the terms of coexistence in its favor with its allies and partners. The aim is not, as other critics charge, simply to “avoid war” or to “change China’s thinking.” It is to advance U.S. interests responsibly amid rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, what proponents of end states often seek is a rhetorical frame that can mobilize Americans, discipline bureaucracies, and restrain vested interests. But it is not clear that an end state would do that. In fact, the best way to mobilize Americans is likely through focusing on how PRC behavior directly harms them and the United States’ future. Such a rhetorical frame — even a cold war frame, should a future administration adopt it — would be consistent with a steady state acknowledging that rivalry is unlikely to decisively end. Discussion of PRC efforts to defeat the U.S. military, surpass the United States technologically, exploit U.S. dependencies in critical minerals and pharmaceuticals, compromise critical infrastructure, export Fentanyl precursors to drug cartels, and silence dissent even beyond China’s borders are more likely to be compelling than abstract visions of victory because these actions directly harm U.S. citizens. This kind of rhetorical mobilization has helped generate bipartisan support for domestic investments that strengthen the United States’ competitiveness, including in infrastructure, semiconductors, scientific research, and manufacturing. But more is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller than the first, the second camp includes those who are uncomfortable with the idea that rivalry is more likely to continue than to end because they fear misperception and escalation. Their criticisms include that, “a strategy of an open-ended competition” is dangerous and that “broadcasting an endless horizon of confrontation will appear to China and others as a sweeping and permanent campaign to undermine its power.” But this analysis is also in error. Acknowledging that rivalry is unlikely to end is not the same as advocating open-ended competition. Put differently, the United States does not have a strategy seeking competition with China but instead a structural reality that forces competition on the United States. For those worried about misperception and escalation, what should be more important than articulating the end of competition is articulating the possible limits of competition in a world where it continues so that there might be a chance of managing it. This entails making clear that U.S. ambitions are not unlimited but instead tied to U.S. interests. It also means stressing the kind of steady state the United States seeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;steady-states-and-a-new-administration&quot;&gt;Steady States and a New Administration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics have rightly made clear that the current steady state requires further definition. It is important to get the strategic logic for a steady state right. And if that can be accompanied by a public frame that can mobilize Americans, keep allies and partners aligned, and perhaps help manage PRC perceptions, all the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anchoring U.S. strategy on an end state for how rivalry ends is neither realistic nor practical. Nor should U.S. strategy be based entirely on what the United States hopes to avoid, such as conflict. Instead, U.S. strategy should be anchored on a steady state that envisions terms of coexistence — however uneasy and fraught that may be — with the PRC that are maximally favorable to the United States. This might have several components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the ideal steady state should begin with affirmatively outlining the interests that the United States seeks to secure and the kinds of order it hopes to preserve and strengthen. In broad terms, these interests include keeping the Indo-Pacific and wider world free from PRC hegemony, including by maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait; sustaining U.S. technological leadership; ensuring broad-based prosperity for Americans while avoiding dependence on adversaries; and ensuring that the international system allows states to make sovereign decisions and is generally conducive to democracy and liberalism, among other elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it should involve some theory of how to get there. There is bipartisan consensus that the United States needs to invest in the sources of its own strength — such as its defense industrial base, technological edge, manufacturing capability — and to align with allies and partners to achieve the scale needed to take on the China challenge. On that foundation, the United States will need to powerfully compete across every regional and functional domain to blunt China’s provocative actions, including its order-building efforts, and to build the foundations for U.S. order. None of this is inconsistent with diplomacy with China that seeks to manage competition, avoid escalation, and enhance transnational cooperation — all of which contribute to a more competitive and sustainable U.S. approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, a steady state should involve some articulation of what the United States wants from Beijing. It is better to avoid framing the answer in terms of changing China’s regime, but instead put it in terms of changing China’s actions. There is value in stating that rivalry would lessen dramatically if Beijing would cease threatening its neighbors militarily; increase consumption and reduce excess capacity economically; refrain from interfering in free societies politically; and work in good faith on issues such as climate transnationally, among other elements. To be clear, China is unlikely to make sweeping changes, U.S. and Chinese interests are at odds in many cases, and both sides will continue taking steps that harm the other’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, there is competitive advantage in signaling to Beijing, and to the allies Washington needs to keep on board, that U.S. aims are not unlimited but instead tied to specific interests that are quite reasonable and widely shared by the rest of the world. In some cases, this kind of precision can create bilateral understandings that lead to fragile but real de-escalation and progress in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, and finally, the United States needs a public frame for its strategy. For foreign audiences, anchoring strategy on an affirmative vision for the world that speaks to their interests will be more appealing than anchoring it on how a bilateral rivalry ends. Meanwhile, at home, China competition needs a frame that rallies the U.S. people. The next administration should stress that outcompeting China is the United States’ main foreign policy priority and necessity, and that the current decade is the critical window to adjust the trend lines in the competition. It should link the China challenge to the interests of everyday Americans, which are real and concrete, rather than rely on abstractions for mobilization. And it should make clear that, while the United States will run hard in the competition, it need not run scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these propositions for a steady state are debatable. Indeed, this is the debate that is needed. The question of how rivalry ends is somewhat hubristic and premature, particularly when some of the trend lines in the competition need urgent reversal. The questions around how the United States succeeds in rivalry — what objectives it prioritizes, how it strengthens itself after decades of neglect, how it keeps allies and partners on board, how it mobilizes audiences at home and abroad, and how it competes hard while managing escalation — will shape the United States’ future. U.S. strategy may or may not need an answer to the question of how rivalry ends, but it certainly needs answers on how best to compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategy requires an end goal or a “vision of victory,” and policymakers need a clear objective against which to establish priorities, align resources and capabilities, and make appropriate trade-offs among policy choices. Yet a vision of victory is not enough to ensure a successful strategy. The vision held must be in keeping with the scale and scope of the challenge. While the current U.S. strategy toward China of “managed competition” has a vision of victory, that vision is not adequate to address the grand-scale, multi-dimensional challenge that China poses to U.S. interests. China has articulated a transformative vision for itself, its position in the international system, and the international system itself. Beijing’s policy toward the United States — namely maintaining stability while working to erode U.S. global leadership and the values, norms, and institutions that underpin it — is a function of its grander vision of change for itself and the international system. The United States needs an equally comprehensive vision of victory that includes a vision for itself and for the nature of U.S. leadership in a transformed twenty-first-century international system. Constraining China is only one strand of what must be a much larger strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;grand-vision&quot;&gt;Grand Vision&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s vision of victory is clear. He seeks to create a system predicated on Chinese values, interests, and institutional preferences which redefines both the international system and China’s position in it. Much, if not all, of this vision is antithetical to U.S. values and interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s objectives include a dramatically expanded Chinese physical territory and maritime domain that reflect the realization of Chinese sovereignty claims over contested territories, such as Taiwan, the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, territory on the Sino-Indian border, and land within Nepal and Bhutan, among others. Xi’s vision also includes dominion over 80 percent of the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Xi seeks to position China as the dominant economic, political, and military power within the broader Asia Pacific, supplanting the United States. According to Xi, “it is for the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia, solve the problems of Asia and uphold the security of Asia.” The United States is thus not a legitimate voice in regional affairs. He has established new trade and investment institutions, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the Silk Road Fund, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, that bind the region’s economies more closely to China. Chinese investment in the region rose by 37 percent between 2022 and 2023, making China the largest single investor in the region (although Chinese investment has still not attained pre-Covid levels). Moreover, under Xi’s leadership, China is rapidly developing the capabilities to challenge the United States’ military preeminence in the Asia Pacific, including an apparent new basing opportunity for the People’s Liberation Army Navy in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond seeking China’s primacy in the Asia Pacific, Xi is transforming China’s role on the global stage through four initiatives — the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), the Global Development Initiative (GDI), and the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI). Combined, these projects are designed to transform the geopolitical, economic, and strategic landscapes in ways that reflect Chinese interests, supporting a set of norms and institutions aimed at eroding those of the current international system. The BRI, for example, has provided as much as $1 trillion in financing and investment for global infrastructure projects in emerging and middle-income economies. At the same time, it serves as a vehicle for the export of China’s own development model (and control) through rapid, debt-inducing infrastructure investment with poor transparency and weak labor, environmental, and social safeguards. China also uses the BRI to gain support for political elements of its governing model. Alongside the export of technology, for example, China has provided cybersecurity training to over three dozen countries, including how to monitor and control dissenting opinions. The GSI also advances a set of norms and values that undermine the current order. The GSI calls for the end of formal alliance structures (e.g., NATO) and supports the notion that one state’s security cannot come at the expense of another’s. Russia used this principle of “indivisible security” to justify its invasion of Ukraine, and China could follow suit in any military action against Taiwan. Further, both the GDI and GCI undermine the notion of inalienable and universal political and civil rights by claiming that all states have the power to determine the rights of their citizens depending on their history, culture, system, and development. Finally, China is working hard to advance the de-dollarization of the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s vision is engendering a new reality in the U.S.-China relationship. Competition between the two countries is not merely economic, nor is it simply between rising and status quo powers. Instead, the U.S.-China relationship much further reaching. It is a competition for the values and structure of the international system itself and leadership of that system. The United States sees China as a revisionist power trying to undermine U.S. global leadership, while China believes that the United States is trying to contain its growing influence and power and is working to prevent China from realizing its legitimate right to define the rules of international engagement. The two countries stand on opposite sides of the current major military conflicts — between Israel and the Palestinians, and between Russia and Ukraine. There is also the potential for the United States and China to end up in direct military conflict in the Indo-Pacific over Taiwan or over territorial disputes that involve U.S. treaty allies, such as Japan or the Philippines. Each major power also backs a different set of multilateral organizations. For example, China supports the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the BRICS, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, while the United States supports the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), the G7, and NATO. Xi does not shy away from acknowledging the system-level competition underway, claiming that the “rising east and declining west” is the “most prominent” feature of today’s world, suggesting the inevitable triumph of socialism over capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limited-line-of-sight&quot;&gt;Limited Line of Sight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Xi has moved to execute his strategy, successive U.S. administrations have struggled to keep pace. What has emerged over the course of the Obama, Trump, and now Biden administrations has been a series of China strategies that are too reactive and piecemeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current U.S. strategy toward China — “managed competition” — reflects a highly discrete set of objectives, not a comprehensive plan. The United States seeks to maintain a comparative advantage over China in core technologies and military capabilities, push back against Chinese political and military incursions globally, rally support from U.S. allies and partners, and prevent the U.S.-China relationship from devolving into kinetic conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, this has translated into a policy built on three and a half pillars. First, the United States is investing in the technology, education, innovation, and manufacturing ecosystems necessary to enable it to compete effectively with China in the twenty-first century through the CHIPS and Science Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it is working to align its policies with those of its allies and partners. In recognition that the United States cannot effectively compete or counter China by itself, the Biden administration has aggressively courted other countries and created new institutions (e.g., IPEF, AUKUS, and the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council) as well as informal groupings (e.g., the U.S.-Japan-ROK trilateral). These partnerships are designed to coordinate policies across an array of U.S. priority areas, such as the green transition, supply chain resiliency, military technology, and AI governance. Many of these policies either explicitly or implicitly are directed at China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And third, the United States is directly competing with China. This competition includes ensuring that the United States has the appropriate economic, military, and political tools to secure a number of U.S. objectives, including a peaceful and stable environment in the Indo-Pacific, a global investment environment that respects the rule of law, and the wherewithal to push back against Beijing’s efforts to advance authoritarianism globally. These tools include, for example, export controls on military-related technologies, new U.S.-supported investment initiatives (e.g., IPEF and Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment), and U.S. leadership in international organizations, such as the International Telecommunications Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the current administration, managing competition also requires developing channels of communication with China to identify and, where possible, address U.S. concerns. The channels focus on issues affecting both countries, including ensuring operational safety between the U.S. and Chinese militaries; addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, third-world debt, and AI governance; creating a level economic playing field; countering climate change; and expanding civil society engagement. Progress has been constrained, however, by a limited willingness to compromise on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;broadening-the-horizon&quot;&gt;Broadening the Horizon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed competition is a strategy with two primary goals: (1) preventing the U.S.-China relationship from deteriorating further; and (2) providing the time and space needed to rebuild the foundations of U.S. political, economic, and military competitiveness. However, while ensuring that the foundations of U.S. strength are robust is necessary for “winning” in the competition with China, it is not sufficient. The United States needs a strategy that takes aim at China’s claim that it (along with Russia) is driving the transformative changes in the world. The United States needs an understanding of victory that includes a vision of itself and its global leadership in the twenty-first century. The strategy for China should anchored within this larger vision of victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winning in this context means that the values, norms, and broad policy preferences of the United States continue to underpin the future of the international system. As articulated by Samantha A. Taylor of the U.S. Army War College, these values include: “open and free trade, liberal democratic governance, universal human rights, collective security, international institutions, and the rule of law.” The overarching U.S. strategy will require a return to a U.S. consensus around what international relations scholar Kori Schake has termed conservative internationalism, in which the United States commits to “promote American security and economic power while supporting the expansion of democracy around the world.” Schake’s prescription for how to get there includes a list of traditional pre-Trump and pre-Biden U.S. values and commitments: advancing free trade, providing a level playing field for U.S. companies, opposing authoritarianism, promoting the rule of law in immigration policy, ensuring a strong military, cooperating with allies to advance shared interests, and enhancing U.S. power in international institutions. These elements are essential to a winning strategy, and many are already represented in the U.S. National Security Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the United States cannot go back to the future. The world has changed and U.S. strategy must account for that change. The relative economic weight of China and India in global GDP terms is now roughly equal to that of the European Union and Japan, respectively; and of the world’s fastest-growing economies in 2024, nine are in Africa. Spurred by China, many emerging and middle-income economies are working to de-dollarize the global economy by trading and investing in their own currencies. In addition, new military alignments, such as the one between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea in support of Russia’s war against Ukraine, are emerging and pose significant new challenges to U.S. security interests. While the United States remains the world’s most powerful military, of the next four, only South Korea is a treaty ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changed relative and absolute limitations of U.S. military and economic power mean that the United States needs to make explicit a different conception of global leadership — one that reflects a greater role for its closest allies and partners, for example, in the G7, in shaping and driving the future international system. Some of this is already occurring. Japan, for example, has stepped up to lead in advancing multilateral trade agreements. In addition, the evolution of the hub-and-spoke alliance system into a “lattice” framework in the Indo-Pacific recognizes the importance of other regional powers playing larger roles in guaranteeing regional stability through a set of informal and formal minilateral arrangements across multiple economic and security domains. In spite of these positive developments, the United States needs to stay ahead of this shifting power dynamic and consider what new security structures may be needed and whether and how to defend the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will also need to address its failure over the past eight years to develop a compelling vision for global trade. Within the Biden administration’s mantra of “a foreign policy for the middle class” is a deep suspicion of international trade, and this has left the United States without a seat at the table as the future international trading system is being designed. The administration dropped out of the World Trade Organization e-commerce negotiations being led by three of its closest partners — Australia, Singapore, and Japan — and pulled out of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a trade arrangement which not only includes its closest Asian allies but also accounts for over 40 percent of the global goods trade. Without U.S. leadership in structuring these deals, the country’s role in shaping the international system is diminished, and U.S. consumers and businesses lose out as others reap the benefits of lower tariffs and efficiencies in integrated supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the United States should consider how it can most effectively engage with emerging and middle-income economies. The Biden administration has worked hard to rebuild relations with its closest allies and partners in Asia and Europe. But without an equally committed effort to build stronger ties with countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, the United States cannot “win” a global contest to shape the international system of the twenty-first century. These countries are essential to U.S. efforts aimed at shaping Chinese behavior on issues such as human rights; internet governance; illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; freedom of navigation; and climate change. Without their support in international regimes and institutions, China will continue to make gains in reshaping the international system to advance its own values and interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should start by bringing emerging and middle-income economies to the table to be part of the decisionmaking processes. This is particularly the case for some of the newest and most pressing issues, including AI governance and workforce retraining. Making decisions with only advanced economies participating will alienate these countries, who rightly believe that their voices should also be heard and respected. Furthermore, the United States should meet these countries where they are at; in other words, the United States must take account of their needs and interests and work with them to achieve those objectives as well. The CHIPS and Science Act and the IRA both have the potential to offer these countries opportunities to participate in major U.S. economic and innovation initiatives, for example. Weaving countries in Africa and Latin America into the educational, innovation, and manufacturing ecosystem of the CHIPs and Science Act and the IRA would send a powerful signal of support from the United States and begin to build a sense of investment in partnering with the United States. The United States should also consider expanding security cooperation with countries in these regions; currently, of the 20 countries the United States has designated as major non-NATO allies, only 6 are in Latin America or Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States needs a clear set of metrics to evaluate how it is faring in this “all-of-system” competition with China over time in order to determine the need for strategy adjustments. Such metrics should include votes in the United Nations, the number of technical standards in core technologies, immigration statistics, and resolution of major military conflicts, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A winning U.S.-China strategy will require leadership that prioritizes investing in the foundations of U.S. economic, political, and military strength. The United States will need to develop new forms of global leadership that elevate the role of allies and partners. Most important, however, the overall vision of victory enacted will need to embrace and help shape the dynamics of change in the international system in ways that acknowledge and invite in the needs and interests of the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To invoke the U.S.-Chinese rivalry as a defining feature of today’s world is now commonplace, and analysts and policymakers across the political spectrum support the United States’ shift away from engagement and toward competition. Jettisoning Washington’s previous strategy of cooperation and integration, premised as it was on the eventual transformation of Chinese behavior, has become a rare point of agreement between the Trump and Biden administrations. The next U.S. administration, irrespective of its makeup, is likely to retain this fundamental orientation in its approach to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a welcome shift, given the paucity of positive results yielded by the previous approach. China and the United States are in a largely competitive relationship, and U.S. policy aims to respond to Chinese actions more than to shape them. A strategy grounded in this reality — one that combines a U.S.-led coalition with targeted, issue-specific efforts to contest Chinese assertiveness — is now emerging to protect U.S. interests and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remains, however, a significant omission in U.S. policy: an objective. Competition is merely a description of U.S.-Chinese relations, not an end in and of itself. Conspicuously absent from the flurry of speeches, strategy documents, and policy pronouncements is the endgame that Washington ultimately seeks with China. Without a clearly defined goal, any overarching strategy is likely to waste resources, frustrate attempts to track progress, and elude the broad-based domestic support necessary to sustain it. U.S. allies and partners wish — and deserve — to know the objective of the coalitions in which Washington increasingly seeks to enlist them. The absence of a clear goal for its self-proclaimed top priority is a liability for Washington — and one that it should urgently work to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eyes-on-the-prize&quot;&gt;Eyes on the Prize&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good strategies articulate a desired end state and outline how to attain it. In his famous 1947 Foreign Affairs article, for instance, diplomat and historian George Kennan argued for “either the breakup or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power,” to be pursued through a combined policy of containment and an effort to increase the strains under which the Soviets operated. Establishing such an objective, as the United States did early in the Cold War, explicitly ruled out other possible goals, such as a partnership and political intimacy between Washington and Moscow on the one hand or the active rollback of communism on the other. Having identified the collapse — or at least moderation — of Moscow’s regime as their aim, U.S. officials pursued containment as the strategy most likely to yield the desired positive results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the end of the Cold War, the United States established a set of objectives for China and theorized about how to achieve them. In 1997, U.S. president Bill Clinton said that Washington’s goal vis-à-vis Beijing “is not containment and conflict; it is cooperation,” noting that “a pragmatic policy of engagement” was most likely to bring about that end. By engaging Beijing, primarily but not exclusively through trade, the Clinton administration aimed to cultivate a “stable, open, and non-aggressive” China. U.S. policymakers postulated that such openness might even foster liberalization and political pluralism within China itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The George W. Bush administration largely retained the goal of a cooperative and liberalizing China, adding to it a wish that the country would become a “responsible stakeholder” in the international system. Washington would seek areas of active cooperation with Beijing across the spectrum of global challenges, from terrorism to energy conservation, in hopes that Chinese leaders would become invested and active in addressing them. Perhaps less certain than its predecessor in the prospects for cooperation, the Bush administration hedged its bets by boosting U.S. military capabilities and bolstering alliances and partnerships throughout Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration shared many of the Bush administration’s objectives, but it hedged even more heavily as doubts about Beijing’s direction and goals grew. Still, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rejected the notion of an adversarial Beijing, saying that it was “essential” for the United States and China to have “a positive, cooperative relationship.” The administration announced a “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia aimed at forging such a relationship by embedding it in a “regional framework of security alliances, economic networks, and social connections” that would strengthen the United States’ position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration ushered in a new era of U.S.-Chinese relations. Under Trump, the United States neither sought a cooperative relationship with Beijing nor pursued engagement as the central means for securing U.S. interests. Rejecting the notion that integration into the global order would spur either Chinese liberalization or responsible international behavior, the Trump administration labeled Beijing a “revisionist power” with which the United States would have a fundamentally competitive relationship. Trump’s Indo-Pacific strategy, declassified in the waning days of his presidency, takes malign Chinese activity as a given to be resisted, often in concert with partners. The Trump administration was no model of message discipline, however, and key policymakers differed on the desired end state. Whereas Trump predicted in 2020 that his bilateral trade deal would “bring both the U.S. and China closer together in so many other ways,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that same year that the United States “must induce China to change” and suggested that efforts to replace the regime in Beijing might be on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration largely retained Trump’s diagnosis of a fundamentally competitive U.S.-China relationship and dismissed previous hopes of transforming China through U.S. policy. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin referred to China as the Pentagon’s top priority. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described China as “the biggest geopolitical test” of the twenty-first century. And President Joe Biden himself stated that he envisions “extreme competition” between Washington and Beijing. A long period of managed competition, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said, “is simply not going to resolve in a neat and decisive end state.” Instead, in Blinken’s words, the United States seeks to “coexist peacefully” with China, and to “share in and contribute to human progress together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, any brief review of the past several administrations’ China policies risks attributing a coherence and continuity to their strategies that did not always exist. Governments are not unitary actors, objectives and approaches change with shifting circumstances and players, and public pronouncements can conflict with private aims. Yet for much of the time since the end of the Cold War and, particularly, during the years of U.S. engagement with China, Washington’s objectives with regard to Beijing were generally explicit. That is no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-the-bottom-up&quot;&gt;From the Bottom Up&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fate of the U.S.-Chinese relationship has profound global implications, and so the objective of U.S. policy should flow from the kind of order Washington wishes to obtain — and the kind of threat China poses to that order. The United States generally seeks to maintain a global order governed by rules rather than by brute power, one in which countries enjoy sovereignty, disputes are resolved peacefully, markets are open to trade, human rights are considered universal, and democracy can flourish. Although the United States’ own track record in upholding such principles is hardly perfect, the country has nevertheless championed them as ideals that should govern international behavior. Since the 1940s, Washington has opposed hostile spheres of influence emerging in Eurasia precisely because they threaten the United States’ desired rules-based order. The overarching goal of U.S. policy today should be to preserve the core pillars of the international order, even as specific rules and institutions change and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that overarching goal should flow the objective of U.S. policy toward China. Given China’s growing military and technological power, its assertive behavior, its economic interdependence with the United States and its allies, and the incompatibility of many Chinese actions with the existing order, Washington should articulate an objective that is both realistic and protective of its people. The aim of U.S. policy toward China should be to ensure that Beijing is either unwilling or unable to overturn the regional and global order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China might cease trying to upend elements of the liberal order if its leaders come to see the strength of the countries that are committed to them and the vigor with which they oppose China’s disruptive efforts. Beijing might someday even see its own future in the preservation of the liberal order. Even if it does not, it could grow incapable of undermining the order for any number of reasons: Beijing’s own weaknesses, the unpalatability of its authoritarian vision in other countries, or a relative strengthening of the powers committed to the liberal status quo, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A China that is unwilling or unable to undermine the regional and global order is a fairly abstract goal for U.S. policy, but it would nonetheless rule out several other potential objectives. With such an end in mind, Washington would not aim to transform China into a liberal power or a responsible stakeholder in the international system. Washington would not work toward Cold War-style containment or regime change in Beijing. And it would not aim to stop China’s rise but rather oppose Beijing’s efforts to disrupt existing international arrangements in ways that damage the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress toward this objective would almost certainly be a matter of degree, but it could be measured (unlike progress toward the broad notions of competition or coexistence). China’s approach to global rules and norms is varied, however. Beijing does not seek to simply repeal and replace what currently exists but rather to reject some principles, accept others, and rewrite the remainder. Such subtlety should help define U.S. priorities, as Washington should focus on preserving those elements of the liberal order that are simultaneously of greatest importance to U.S. interests and under the most threat from Chinese behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A medium-term policy agenda would naturally flow from such a goal. The United States would seek to improve its military position in the Indo-Pacific relative to China; it would contest China’s use of economic coercion, including through an ambitious regional trade policy that aims to reduce countries’ reliance on the Chinese market. The United States would promote building new technology partnerships to ensure the free flow of information and focus existing alliances on protecting democracies from external interference. Washington would, in other words, continue many of the efforts that currently fall under the broad umbrella of competition, but it would channel them toward resisting Chinese attempts to upend key elements of the liberal order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this would entail a shift in how Washington communicates — and thinks about — its China policy. The United States would not strictly be competing against China but rather be working toward the preservation and extension of core international values that serve many nations, including the United States. Its partners would not be required to break their ties with China in order to join a unified bloc, but they would be encouraged to join coalitions aimed at resisting Beijing on specific issues, such as economic coercion, military aggression, the spread of illiberal technologies, and human rights abuses, among others. The accompanying message, despite Beijing’s claims to the contrary, would be that Washington does not seek to suppress China’s rise but rather to establish a U.S.-Chinese equilibrium in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reckoning-day&quot;&gt;Reckoning Day&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and the world can live with a powerful China that does not attempt to overturn key principles of the liberal order. At the moment, however, that possibility seems remote. The military balance in the Indo-Pacific is shifting away from the United States and its allies and toward Beijing. China is becoming increasingly economically dominant in Asia, with Washington noticeably absent from any real leadership on trade. Chinese diplomacy is growing more coercive and more focused on the internal affairs of other countries, undermining the latter’s sovereignty and independence. Although cooperation with Beijing is desirable and theoretically possible, it is in very short supply, even in areas in which U.S. and Chinese interests seem to overlap, such as climate change and pandemic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reversing these trends is no easy task. It will take years and involve risks. Diplomacy can help mitigate the risks, but only to a limited degree. The United States will need to accept increased tension in the medium term in order to achieve a more stable equilibrium with China in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every month, it seems, U.S. policymakers sound the alarm about the U.S.-Chinese relationship with greater volume. Across party lines and branches of government, increasing numbers of policymakers now endorse a major response to the China challenge. The watchwords are more resources, more speed, more vigor. And all of this is appropriate. But Washington would do well to clarify what, precisely, this national effort aims to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been heartening to see the recent invigoration of discussion around the need for clarity on the goals of U.S. strategy toward China. Effective strategy requires clear goals. Over the past three years, the U.S.-China relationship has become more functional and stable, even as it remains intensively competitive. As laudable as this progress has been, the Biden administration has fallen short in articulating goals for its relationship with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s foreign policy record has been strongest on its progress in deepening America’s relationships with key allies and partners. With creativity, tenacity, and good diplomacy, the Biden team has launched an alphabet soup of minilateral groupings which collectively have improved the United States’ posture in Asia. The sum of these efforts equals greater U.S. influence and stronger deterrence against any attempts to redraw borders through threat or use of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration also has unlocked a massive wave of investment aimed at upscaling the United States. With over $2 trillion allocated through the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Biden team has made generational investments in clean energy, semiconductors, and advanced manufacturing. These efforts have attracted many global firms to crowd-in their support for these industries, contributing to America becoming the world’s top recipient of inbound investment in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the critical question of America’s goals for its relationship with China, however, the Biden administration has not been clear. To the extent leaders have addressed the question, they have tended to explain what the United States seeks to avoid — a new Cold War, confrontation or conflict, containment of China, or full economic decoupling from China — not what it seeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In attempting to clarify, at least partially, the boundaries of the U.S. approach toward China, the Biden administration aims to attract greater alignment with partners regarding China while still maintaining a firm handle on competition with China. In leaving U.S. objectives open to interpretation, and not black and white, the administration provides — perhaps intentionally, perhaps not — allies and partners with greater political space to work alongside the United States. In other words, the Biden team seeks to demonstrate competence and steadiness in building coalitions and in navigating competition with a nuclear-armed rival, while giving its partners flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, calculated ambiguity in explaining the goals of U.S. strategy on China carries risks. First, it feeds a perception of President Biden as lacking the vision and boldness needed to confront what his administration has identified as America’s most serious foreign policy challenge. Second, if Americans do not know the purpose of a particular strategy, they are less likely to support sacrifices in service of it. Third, with this approach, the United States risks squandering one of its asymmetric advantages — its global network of allies and partners for dealing with challenges posed by China. If America’s partners do not know the desired destination of U.S. strategy, there is greater risk that they will hedge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, experts have begun filling the vacuum left by the Biden administration’s decision not to articulate clear affirmative goals vis-à-vis China. Unfortunately, however, the expert debate has run into an intellectual cul-de-sac. On one side, there are advocates of regime change, on the other, proponents of managed coexistence. This binary framing turns on a judgment about whether a strong China poses an intolerable threat to the United States and its way of life. To some, the answer is yes. To others, it is closer to maybe not; for the latter, it remains possible for the United States to coexist with China, even amid intense competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While an interesting intellectual debate, this is not a sound basis for developing strategy. First, as history has shown, the United States is not capable of determining China’s governance system. If the United States could not alter Cuba’s governance structure — a small island 90 miles off the coast of Florida — it should not expect to affect the CCP’s grip on power; the same logic could be applied to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the United States and China are not captains of two rival blocs with fixed geographic boundaries, as was the case during the Cold War. Instead, both countries exist within the same international system, are entangled within the same global web, and are both vying for greater relative influence over its future direction. Washington and Beijing are competing to establish a favorable balance of power. They both want to maximize their freedom of maneuver and limit dependence on the other. They are striving to outpace and outperform the other rather than to defeat them. Indeed, as both realize, if ever one side did vanquish the other, they would harm themselves in the process, given the depth of interdependence that exists between the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics will counter that the United States won the Cold War by toppling the Soviet Union. In this telling, the United States should employ a similar playbook for confronting China, including by working to contain China’s global expansion of influence and limiting China’s capacity to grow its economy. These critics celebrate President Reagan’s unflinching determination to stare down the Soviet Union and clamor for a strong U.S. leader to do the same against China. They overlook the fact that virtually no other country in the world would join the United States in seeking to contain China today. Moreover, America is incapable of containing China alone. These critics also elide the fact that out of the Soviet Union’s collapse grew Putin’s Russia, not an outcome worth celebrating or seeking to emulate. The brave people of Ukraine are a living testament to this sad reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than drawing imprecise historical analogies to justify ideological pursuits against China, the more central questions policymakers should ask are: (1) What kind of world do Americans want to live in during the twenty-first century, and (2) what type of relationship with China would best support such a scenario?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, U.S. policymakers had the luxury of not having to grapple with these questions. America enjoyed primacy in international affairs. Now, however, the era of Pax Americana is over. U.S. power is contested around the globe, as are U.S. invocations of a “rules-based international order.” The United States and China are both capable of harming the other; and neither rival can secure absolute security against the other. America’s ability to control the outcomes of events worldwide has diminished and continues to do so. This is the present-day reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is entering a unique era of fluidity. Comparable precedents include the ends of the Napoleonic era, of World War II, and of the Cold War. Geopolitical tectonic plates are shifting as power changes and disperses. The impact of these shifts is being exacerbated by concurrent industrial revolutions — in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this moment of transition, the goal of U.S. strategy should be to maximally advance the security, prosperity, and wellbeing of the American people. Doing so will require holding firm on — and securing as broad of a buy-in as possible from other countries for — several key principles and conditions. Preserving the post–World War II norm that national boundaries should not be redrawn through threat or use of force must remain, a norm that has been honored in the breech recently with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The United States also should rally global support for upholding open access to the global commons, including international waters and airspace. Washington must coordinate with allies and partners to prevent any single power from dominating Asia and establishing a closed sphere of influence. The United States should work to become more of a model for upholding the human rights it advocates protecting around the world. Washington also should strive to preserve an open, rules-based international trading system, which would support diversification of value and supply chains and limit the ability of any power to corner the market on key products and inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American people’s security, prosperity, and wellbeing depends upon collective efforts to confront global challenges. One of the largest casualties of the breakdown in U.S.-China relations over the past seven years has been the abandonment of efforts to coordinate global responses to immediate challenges. The debilitating spectacle of Beijing and Washington engaging in nationalist blamesmanship instead of leading international efforts to tackle Covid-19 was a glaring example of the baleful consequences of the U.S.-China relationship becoming singularly defined by mutual enmity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is more comfortable and self-satisfying to coordinate responses to crises within a cocoon of like-minded partners, such an approach will only hasten the United States’ abdication of global leadership. To best protect its interests, Washington needs to truly lead on the world stage, not merely settle to serve as leader of the G7. Global leadership means being capable of pulling in and pooling resources from the world’s most capable countries, including those with whom the United States disagrees, such as China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America has experience pulling China into responses to global challenges, including in response to the 2014 outbreak of Ebola, Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, calls for greater UN peacekeeping capacity, and climate change, to cite a few examples. To do so again, Washington will need to return to first principles. Among these, Washington will need to demonstrate in word and deed that it is willing to share leadership with China when Beijing materially contributes to solutions for global challenges. China’s leaders crave recognition as global leaders, and this desire should be better leveraged to extract concrete Chinese contributions, such as in Gaza’s reconstruction, the development of a global emerging disease surveillance network, and investments in the green energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving this will require the United States to rethink its global position and to pursue global leadership in lieu of centering its foreign policy on competition with China, regardless of whether Beijing remains fixed in its dark view of hostile U.S. intentions. This will necessitate U.S. policymakers adopting a broader framework for evaluating the impact of Chinese actions beyond a narrow threat-based prism, currently in vogue in Washington. Viewing every Chinese action as threatening produces pressure on U.S. policymakers to react to every Chinese move, without regard as to whether the Chinese action implicates vital U.S. interests or even whether the United States’ response helps or hinders its own long-term interests. Viewing Chinese actions as primarily threatening has forced U.S. foreign policy to become increasingly reactive and defensive, when the present global moment calls for the United States to be bold, ambitious, and optimistic about leveraging its strengths to lead globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, with the acceleration of climate change, the growing wave of climate-induced migration, armed conflicts, the likelihood of another pandemic, and the societal disruptions that artificial intelligence will engender, there is a crying need for global leadership. In this post-unipolar moment, the United States will need to draw on as much support as it can muster to address these and other challenges in line with its interests, including from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enlisting greater Chinese buy-in for tackling global challenges will not be easy, nor will it be satisfying. Beijing will insist on doing things its own way. Chinese leaders will continue to support and sympathize with countries that oppose U.S. leadership, including Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Even so, Beijing’s goal is not to become captain of a team of aggrieved and isolated powers. Rather, it desires to become a respected global power. China lacks the power to achieve this outcome through conquest or use of force. Yet President Xi and those around him still covet recognition as global statesmen, peacemakers, and leaders for the coming century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, shared pursuits will not dull the intensely competitive nature of U.S.-China relations. Nor will they reduce the imperative for the United States to bolster its military posture in Asia. After all, China will still claim Taiwan and will continue to develop advanced military capabilities in order to assert greater control over its periphery. As China’s military capabilities rise, so too will the bar for the United States and its partners to maintain credible deterrence against Chinese aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterring Chinese assertions of control over contested territories is necessary, but it is an insufficient response to the challenge at hand. A core pillar of America’s strategy must be, as Ben Rhodes suggested, to “revitalize U.S. innovation and advanced manufacturing, disentangle critical supply chains from China, and maintain a lead for U.S. companies in developing new and potentially transformative technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, to lead effectively, U.S. leaders will need to create conditions which enable the United States to continue serving as a magnet for global talent, technology, and capital, including from China. These are key ingredients for the United States to maintain an overall edge in innovation. It is increasingly clear that whichever country leads in technological innovation in the coming century will enjoy preponderant influence in the international system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, U.S. policymakers need to realize that their obsession with countering China is blinding them to larger dynamics in the international system and thus limiting the United States’ chance to renew its global leadership. Neither attempts to vanquish China nor aspirations to coexist with it are credible end goals for the purpose-built strategy for which the current moment calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embedding its approach to China within a broader framework for renewing global leadership will allow the United States to regain initiative. It will help rebuild U.S. capacity to galvanize solutions to global challenges by bringing U.S. priorities in closer alignment with those of its partners. It will strengthen the United States’ hand to push back firmly when China attempts to challenge core principles. At the same time, such an approach holds the potential to open space for China to contribute more to global challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ foremost priority is to lead in a twenty-first-century multipolar world, rather than to downsize itself into a regional power or a mere captain of a collection of democracies. To move in this direction, U.S. policymakers will need clarity and firmness on what principles it must uphold, as well as flexibility and creativity in creating (and leading) broad coalitions of capable countries, including China, to tackle pressing challenges and to develop rules and norms for future ones. Policymakers also will need to prioritize strategies for accelerating innovation within the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps are well within America’s reach. For all its challenges, the United States remains uniquely positioned to lead in this coming century, if it plays its cards right. The more it does so, the better positioned it will be to address challenges posed by China in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1848, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote, “A specter is haunting Europe — the specter of Communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter.” Today, America is haunted by the specter of a Cold War. Many key stakeholders — members of Congress, voters, social media commentators, and geopolitical strategists — have entered into an alliance to exorcise this specter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cold War ended in a collapse of the Soviet Union, and some in the policy community advocate for a collapse of the Chinese Communist Party’s regime in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as an end goal of U.S. policy toward China. Regime collapse is such a complex phenomenon rooted in a myriad of conditions, dynamics, and factors, many of which are simply beyond any realistic conception of what the United States can achieve in its foreign policy. That purported goal does not provide a meaningful direction and reliable guide for how to think about international relations, and it does not account for the deep complexities of the relationship between China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a saying in management education, “Operation is strategy.” While some critics deride “managed competition” as a mere process, getting process right is precisely what the United States needs to confront the geopolitical challenges of a China that has abandoned its previous pragmatic working relationships with the West, but also a China with which the United States has built up some deep and productive connections and ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy of the Biden administration is known as “managed competition.” As a concept, managed competition permits a degree of flexibility in U.S. policy toward China — tough in areas where necessary and collaborative in areas where desired. It is also a concept that does not set out assuming a China that is completely set in stone; rather, it is a China that, however reluctantly, slowly, and often imperceptibly, may still respond to a combination of incentives, punitive acts, and confrontational postures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-is-not-a-new-soviet-union&quot;&gt;China Is Not a New Soviet Union&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. policy toward China designed to achieve a complete victory is based on a loose reading of history, and prescriptively it is a highly risky idea. First, it is worth clarifying some fundamental distinctions between the Soviet Union of the Cold War era and China today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1956, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary, and in 1961, the Berlin Wall was built with tacit or explicit encouragement from the Soviet Union. In 1962, the Soviet Union’s placement of missiles in Cuba prompted the Kennedy administration to impose a naval blockade, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear Armageddon for 13 days. In 1968, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia, and in 1979, it invaded Afghanistan. Today, Russia, the successor state to the Soviet Union, is waging an active war of aggression against Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has adopted an aggressive and destabilizing geopolitical stance toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea, matched with strident and virulent anti-Western, anti-American rhetoric that is deeply unsettling. Historically, it has engaged in border clashes with Vietnam and India. That said, China has not engaged in reckless behavior that has brought the world to the brink of World War III or nuclear Armageddon in the same way the Soviet Union did during the Cold War. The United States needs to be vigilant, clear-eyed, and attentive to the geopolitical intentions and actions of the PRC, but a factually loose and selective analogy between China and the Soviet Union is misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some analysts assert with certainty that the Soviet Union collapsed because of the confrontational policy of the Reagan administration, that view is an oversimplification of history. The arms race with the United States and significant military expenditures did strain the Soviet economy, and President Ronald Reagan’s policies — including increased defense spending and the Strategic Defense Initiative — put additional pressure on Moscow. But the collapse of the Soviet Union resulted from a host of other complex developments, such as the reform programs launched by Mikhail Gorbachev and long-term economic stagnation. Also, unlike China, the Soviet Union’s composition — with distinct ethnic and nationalistic groups that overlapped with the entity’s political boundaries — also contributed to its unitary frailties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many counterexamples in the world. North Korea and Cuba did not collapse despite years of sanctions imposed by the West and isolation. History does not repeat, and in this case it may not even rhyme. Adopting a “vision of victory” designed to destabilize China or otherwise provoke internal change has a very small likelihood of achieving its professed goal, while its provocative rationale risks getting the United States involved in an escalation of conflicts with China. Designing a policy around the idea of causing regime collapse is not only lacking in realism — it is prone to many problematic, unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has, by and large, struck the right balance between cooperation and confrontation in its articulation of policy toward China. One can quibble exactly where the administration should come down in that difficult and delicate balancing act, but the general approach is one that the United States should continue to embrace in the future. The overarching goal of the United States’ policy toward China should be avoiding conflicts, and that goal sometimes requires a confrontational stance and sometimes requires active diplomacy and acts of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of “managed competition” is not only a prudent approach, it is rooted in the complexity that defines the very nature of the relationship between China and the United States, a level of complexity that was entirely absent during the Cold War. For instance, collaboration with China is essential to addressing climate change. And even amid trade wars and derisking, China remains an important economic and trading partner with the United States. Scientists of the two countries have collaborated with each other on important and meaningful basic research projects that benefit not only the two countries but all of humankind. One area of fruitful research is in agriculture, as noted by a report of the Carter Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A policy that is single-handedly punitive can backfire on the United States. The trade war with China is one example; it damaged the Chinese economy but also produced a negative effect on the United States. The bout of inflation that the United States experienced resulted from supply chain disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic, but the trade war with China further constrained the supply capacity and exacerbated the transitory inflationary pressures. A widespread view is that China hoarded pandemic-related medical supplies during the Covid-19 outbreak. China did hoard supplies, but it was not the only cause of the lack of preparation among U.S. healthcare institutions. For example, the tariffs enacted by the Trump administration reduced U.S. stockpiling of essential medical supplies before the onset of Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an argument to go back to the geopolitically naive era of unfettered globalization, but an argument that economic interdependence creates special challenges that U.S. administrations during the Cold War did not have to consider. A “win” against China is not guaranteed to be an unambiguous win for the United States, and the costs of trying to achieve that win can be far costlier than those associated with the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;even-the-cold-war-was-not-all-about-confrontation&quot;&gt;Even the Cold War Was Not All About Confrontation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that the actual Cold War was far more nuanced than many of the current Cold Warriors remember. Indeed, the United States pursued a version of “managed competition” with the Soviet Union for much of the Cold War. Its policy toward Moscow was a mixture of détente and confrontation, and the United States and the Soviet Union actively collaborated with each other in areas that were deemed as benefiting both countries. While many China hawks no doubt oppose continuing academic collaborations with China, it is important to point out that even in the immediate aftermath of Sputnik, the Soviet Union and the United States maintained collaborative efforts. The 1958 Lacy–Zarubin Agreement, a cultural exchange accord, facilitated the movement and collaboration of students and scholars between the two nations. Additionally, during the 1960s and 1970s, the two countries cooperated on the smallpox eradication project under the auspices of the World Health Organization, a project that provided enduring benefits to humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two ends of the policy spectrum — unfettered collaboration and globalization on the one hand and the decoupling of all the ties with the PRC on the other — are easy options, but a responsible policy course that recognizes the complex reality of interdependence between the two countries is one that mitigates risks while striving to retain the upside of that interdependence. It is hard and does not make for good bumper stickers, but it is the only responsible policy course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, it is possible to look to the Cold War and how the United States and Soviet Union managed collaboration in science and technology. One suggestion is to adopt a more structured and organized approach, akin to the joint smallpox project during the Cold War, where both governments mutually agreed on and supervised topics and research areas. In this geopolitical climate, collaboration must ensure the safety of both nations and participating researchers. This curated method will inevitably result in some loss of autonomy and research scale, and while it may not be the preferred approach, it is a necessary and viable alternative in these times of geopolitical tension and distrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of capital investments, the United States can take a page from how China has managed its own globalization process. The United States utilizes tariffs to restrict goods from China, a strategy that, if executed correctly, can benefit American interests. The current approach to Chinese capital inflows tends to recognize the complexity of the issue but then simplifies it to a single solution — restriction. The United States should leverage the benefits of Chinese capital inflows while mitigating the drawbacks. The United States can establish special procedures and processes dedicated to vetting and regulating Chinese investments. For instance, Congress could pass a law mandating that Chinese investments in the United States have to have American joint venture partners, or that subjects Chinese operations in the United States to a higher level and broader range of scrutiny than investments from other countries. The rise of China and the numerous challenges it poses to the United States necessitate a dedicated policy and regulatory framework, rather than adhering to the United States’ usual non-discriminatory most favored nation (MFN) approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-balanced-lesson-from-the-cold-war&quot;&gt;A Balanced Lesson from the Cold War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s shift toward autocracy, reversal of globalization, market reforms, and belligerent geopolitical posture have all been deeply troubling developments, and the United States should harbor no illusions about Xi Jinping and his policy agenda. That said, it is important to recognize that the China of today is not the Soviet Union of the Cold War era. China is a globally connected economy in a way the Soviet Union never was, and it remains a vital economy that is important to the United States and the rest of the world. The flows of financial resources, human capital exchanges, and research collaborations have been beneficial to both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States must confront China where the geopolitical and economic interests of the two countries collide, but it must categorically reject a strategy based solely on confrontation. Instead, the United States should seek creative and proactive ways to compete and collaborate with China, balancing the relationship to produce benefits while managing risks. The world is a complex place, requiring a nuanced approach. To espouse a policy based on toppling the Chinese regime runs the risk of turning China, an economic competitor and geopolitical rival, into an outright enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the deft management of the Cold War — a combination of the willingness of President John F. Kennedy to reach a compromise with the Soviet Union to resolve the Cuban Missile Crisis, the détente policy of President Richard Nixon, and President Reagan’s challenge to the Soviet autocracy — that cumulatively contributed to an outcome in which the Cold War ended in peace rather than in nuclear Armageddon. In drawing a lesson from the Cold War, the United States should make sure to draw the right one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-vision-of-victory-is-unnecessary-and-undesirable&quot;&gt;A “Vision of Victory” Is Unnecessary and Undesirable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ relationship with China cannot be separated from broader historical processes. Professor Michael J. Green has pointed out that, since the eighteenth century, the central theme of the United States’ strategy toward the Asia-Pacific has been that it “will not tolerate any other power establishing exclusive hegemonic control over Asia or the Pacific.” To this end, the United States has “overcome bids for regional hegemony in Asia from the European powers, Imperial Japan, and Soviet communism.” The current competition with China is only the latest iteration. After more than two centuries of application, the United States’ current focus on avoiding exclusive control by China remains both necessary and desirable; no alternative “vision of victory” presented rivals current policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though critics may disagree, they also provide valuable reminders of what is too often overlooked or downplayed: China is a Leninist state ruled by a vanguard party that demands a monopoly of power. Moreover, the flaw in many of these Cold War 2.0 arguments lies in their underlying assumption: that the current U.S.-China relationship mirrors the twentieth-century U.S.-Soviet Cold War. While there are superficial similarities between the current U.S.-China and former U.S.-Soviet competitions, this is to be expected in a relationship between two great powers. The real problem with the Cold War analogy is that it confuses the epiphenomenal with the essential and is, therefore, fundamentally misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and the Soviet Union’s connections were tangential as each led a discrete system, with only superficial economic connections. The Cold War was a war of ideas, an existential struggle between systems, between differing views on the fundamental ordering of society. At its core, the U.S.-Soviet relationship was a competition to determine the best way of organizing modern industrial society. Once the Soviet Union collapsed, the issue was settled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China relationship is fundamentally different because their connections are very real and deep. The relationship rests on mutual interdependence and, consequently, mutual vulnerability. Unlike during the Cold War, almost all twenty-first-century economies are now mixed and differ only in the balance between the planned (which the United States and others in the West prefer to call “regulated”) and market elements. By contrast to the twentieth century, with its clear divides and limited interdependence, the twenty-first century is a global century, its economies and societies deeply interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and China are the two most important nodes in this global system woven together by a global web of supply chains whose scope, density, and complexity have never before been seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and China are both uncomfortable because their interdependence exposes their mutual vulnerabilities. Each is trying to mitigate its risks — Washington by denying China critical technologies and forcing supply-chain diversification and Beijing by promoting technological self-reliance and domestic-consumption-driven growth. Neither approach is likely to succeed, at least not to the extent their advocates may hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global system is under pressure. But barring a catastrophic U.S.-China war, it is highly improbable that the incredibly dense and complex web of supply chains binding the United States and China (and others) will — or can be made to — bifurcate into two separate systems. Even within particular high-technology domains — the only area where such a divide is conceivable — it would be, at most, only partial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Asia-Pacific is the epicenter of U.S.-China competition. It is also the location of some of the most important nodes of the global web. It is also the region where the interconnections are most difficult to disentangle. Like it or not, the United States and China must continue to compete within the single system in which they and the rest of the world are inextricably entangled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cold War 2.0 advocates often see the end point of U.S.-China competition as regime change — “a China that is able to chart its own course free from communist dictatorship,” as one advocate put it. Such an understanding echoes George Kennan’s prediction that patient containment would eventually lead to “either the break-up or a gradual mellowing of Soviet power,” although most contemporary advocates of regime change in China seem less patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the Soviet Union was containable because it pursued self-containment through autarchy; the regime in essence contained itself. The same cannot be said for China, which is so vital a node in the global system and its economy so intertwined with the world that the United States might as well try to contain itself. Even with the demographic and other structural weaknesses now evident, the Chinese system is more economically viable and more resilient than the Soviet economy ever was, even at its peak. Chinese growth will slow, but China will not collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of competition within a system are fundamentally different from the dynamics of the Cold War U.S.-Soviet competition between systems. Though dangerous The U.S.-China competition is not an existential struggle between two systems, each seeking to replace the other, but rather a struggle between two powers seeking to control the one system. Today, no one can seriously hope (or fear) that communism or the planned economy could replace capitalism or the market. Nor is it likely that U.S.-China competition will end in any clear-cut dénouement as did U.S.-Soviet competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and China compete by trying to use the complex interdependencies of their relationship to gain an advantage within a system from which they and the rest of the world have benefitted. And, in a crucial difference from the Cold War, both the United States and China seek to do this without irrevocably damaging the system itself. This is very different from one system trying to replace the other; it is also not clear that either can gain a decisive advantage without risking serious damage to themselves, something the United States largely accomplished in the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This underscores a fundamental reality: competition and the possibility of conflict are intrinsic characteristics of international relations among sovereign states. It is thus a mistake to conceive of any international order as necessarily based on consensus. More often than not in world history, it was the competition between major powers, and the efforts to minimize the risks of competition, that constituted the only “order” that existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was certainly the case for the 40 years after the end of World War II. Only within the short and historically exceptional period after the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union imploded was this central reality masked by the overwhelming dominance of the United States, which had created the illusion that there was only one vision of order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brief period was beneficial to most countries, including China, but that does not make it any less exceptional. Though the United States is not in the absolute decline that China likes to portray, the relativities of power have irrevocably changed. The United States will never again be as dominant as it was in the immediate post–Cold War period. The world have returned to normalcy, where competition and the possibility of conflict drive international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed within the longue durée of world history, the end of the Cold War was just another geopolitical event, albeit a momentous one. It is foolish to invest a single geopolitical event with universal significance. Although the most extreme versions of investing an event with such widespread significance as the “end of history” are no longer fashionable, their lingering shadow underlies the idea that some “vision of victory” is needed for competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realization that China’s views of the post–Cold War international order were not identical to those of the West — despite being one of its main beneficiaries — seemed shockingly unnatural to some analysts. Responses by some Cold War 2.0 advocates seem overblown, with aggressiveness concealing a loss of confidence that is close to panic. But it is not just China whose views differ from the West. Many U.S. partners and friends in the Asia-Pacific also have their own interpretations of the current rules-based order — across the region, the same words do not necessarily hold the same meaning. Singapore, for example, is a staunch supporter of what it too calls a rules-based order but is much more committed to the economic rules than to the belief that certain political ideas claimed to be “universal rights,” give other countries the right to interfere in another’s internal affairs. It is a Western conceit that U.S. — or Western — definitions and interpretations of rules are or should be the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heightened U.S.-China competition was in some measure due to the disenchantment after the hope that economic reform in China would lead to at least some political reform, and that this would then modify China’s behavior, proved illusionary. When political reform did not follow economic reform, some of China’s strategic choices — entirely logical from the Leninist state’s viewpoint — aroused something almost akin to a sense of betrayal among some observers. Self-delusion contaminated the Western idea of China after Deng Xiaoping’s reforms; this was based on a misunderstanding of why such states reform. The purpose of reform — any reform — in a Leninist system is always to strengthen the vanguard party and to perpetuate its rule, a fact that Xi Jinping has now made impossible to ignore. The United States must dispel its illusions to compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the orthodox justification of class struggle no longer credible, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), to legitimate its monopoly of power, now relies on a highly nationalist — and revanchist — narrative of Chinese humiliation, rejuvenation, and anticipated achievement of the “China Dream” under its leadership. This narrative drives assertive Chinese behavior in the Himalayas, the East and South China Seas, and Taiwan. It infuses Chinese foreign policy with a strong sense of entitlement and makes compromise difficult, except as a tactical expedient. With this understanding, Chinese actions become more intelligible. After all, if they are only reclaiming what is rightfully theirs and that was stolen when the country was weak — as their revanchist narrative lays out — why should China compromise? Moreover, from the CCP’s perspective, how can they do so without looking weak to their own people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lacking a credible alternative, the CCP cannot abandon its current legitimating narrative. The regime knows that it cannot rule by coercion alone, and preservation of its rule and its monopoly on power are the most vital of the CCP’s core interests. There is no real threat to CCP rule, and it is not unreasonable to assume that the general Chinese population whose lives have undoubtedly improved under its leadership are not dissatisfied with its rule. However, the CCP’s demand for absolute control makes it continually insecure. As China faces a future of uninspiring growth, to bolster its authority the CCP may be tempted to act out its legitimating narrative even more aggressively, possibly in the East and South China Seas or against Taiwan, particularly it if concludes that the United States is in no mood to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States must be prepared to manage Chinese behavior over the long term through the time-tested tools of resolute deterrence and patient diplomacy. There are no quick fixes. The United States should not assume that a China without the CCP would be easier to deal with than the current China with it. Whatever various other countries may think of China’s Leninist system, the United States cannot assume that all countries in the Asia-Pacific, including U.S. allies, would regard a regime change, even if achievable, as desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is naïve to think that without the CCP, nationalism would fade away. Professor Yan Xuetong of Tsinghua University has warned of the dangers of the sense of superiority and over-confidence of young Chinese. The CCP fears — and uses — nationalism. And its monopoly on power gives the CCP the means to control nationalism. That is not to be assumed in any other type of regime. Political dynamics in a multiparty China have the potential to stoke rather than dampen nationalism, with dangerously unpredictable consequences&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to shoehorn U.S.-China relations into simplistic frameworks such as “democracy versus authoritarianism” only complicates the management of competition and evokes as much resistance as support. Most countries in the Asia-Pacific, including U.S. allies, do not regard every aspect of U.S. democracy with unqualified admiration, nor do they recoil with horror from all aspects of Chinese authoritarianism. With so many disparate views, it would be well-nigh impossible to achieve regional consensus on any definition of victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leaders are rational actors, not gamblers. They will certainly not roll the dice with CCP rule, which is what a war with the United States would amount to. Nuclear deterrence kept the “long peace” between the United States and the Soviet Union. The risk of conflict is never entirely absent from international relations. Still, nuclear deterrence makes a war by design — where China or the United States use war as an instrument of policy against the other — highly improbable. Instead, the real risk is conflict by miscalculation or an accident getting out of hand. Although such risks cannot be entirely eliminated, they can be managed and minimized through deterrence and diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Composing oneself for the long-term management of an issue with little prospect of any clear resolution is not an attitude that sits naturally with most Americans. However, accepting a different goal — the prevention of exclusive hegemonic control of the Asia-Pacific, as identified by Michael Green — has the potential to make the situation more acceptable across and within the U.S. and its allies. Moreover, this goal — the aim of U.S. policy in the Asia-Pacific for the last two centuries — has largely already been achieved. Insofar as the CCP’s “China Dream” implies the restoration of a real or imagined regional hierarchy with China at its apex, Beijing cannot succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s size, proximity, and strategic weight will always give Beijing significant influence in the region. But these very same factors have also aroused resistance in all but a handful of countries. Within today’s Asia-Pacific region, there is a better — if not always publicly acknowledged — appreciation of the irreplaceable U.S. role in maintaining equilibrium. To be sure, no country, including U.S. allies, will ever foreswear dealing with Beijing. The U.S. will have to share the Asia-Pacific space as countries seek to maximize strategic flexibility by pursuing omnidirectional foreign policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns about Chinese behavior have revitalized bilateral U.S. alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines, with only Thailand still somewhat ambivalent. It has led to the formation of the Quad, AUKUS, and security cooperation between the United States, South Korea, and Japan, between Manila and Tokyo, between Australia and Indonesia, and between Japan and India, among others. Japan has finally and decisively abandoned its postwar Yoshida Doctrine and adopted a proactive security role. Vietnam is putting aside old enmities to improve defense ties with the United States, as are traditionally non-aligned India and Indonesia. No member country of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is going to accept an exclusive relationship with China. Laos and Cambodia are partial exceptions but strategically, they are of little consequence. Overall, China is not in a favorable geopolitical position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China modernizes its nuclear forces and improves its second-strike capabilities, the strength of U.S. extended deterrence in the Asia-Pacific will inevitably be questioned. Will San Francisco or Los Angeles be sacrificed to save Tokyo or Seoul? Japanese or South Koreans are unlikely to assume that the answer will be positive. It is a matter of when not whether Japan and South Korea will acquire nuclear deterrents within the U.S. alliance system, just as Britain and France did in Europe decades ago. For Tokyo and Seoul, this will be politically very difficult. But however reluctantly, the logic of their situation will inexorably lead them in that direction. The alternative is the loosening of their alliances with the United States and their eventual subordination to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subordination would force such a fundamental redefinition of Japanese and South Korean national identities that the nuclear option will be the less traumatic one. Independent nuclear deterrents will keep Tokyo and Seoul within America’s orbit. With India, Pakistan, Russia, and North Korea also in the equation, an octagonal balance of mutually assured destruction will freeze the Asia-Pacific into a multipolar configuration, preventing hegemonic domination by China and thereby forcing the CCP to moderate its dreams of hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an outcome is not against U.S. interests. Even if the journey there may be fraught, the end result — which will be to the benefit, not only of the United States, but also to the global economy — will be a stable Asia-Pacific. The essential U.S. role is to manage the transition to such an Asia-Pacific. There is no reason for hasty or panicked responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-superficial-consensus&quot;&gt;A Superficial Consensus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common refrains in Washington today is the claim of a deep consensus on China policy. Republicans and Democrats may disagree on almost everything else, but they are united in their assessment that China is increasingly authoritarian at home and in violation of its international commitments abroad. As a result, the argument goes, the United States must emphatically push back on security and economic issues, with both becoming increasingly intertwined. The clearest evidence of this consensus, so the story goes, is that the Biden administration has continued, and even extended, many of the trade and technology restrictions first imposed by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this alignment is not as deep as it first appears. It is held together artificially, as with a horse’s blinker hood, by a focus on day-to-day developments, the consideration and adoption of tactical moves, an effort to avoid steps that would invite domestic political attacks, and a preference for policies that score political points. While proponents of this consensus focus on the short term, however, China policy has lacked clear and measurable long-term goals, and little effort has gone into evaluating the extent to which recent policies have actually been effective in achieving their stated aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a quiet countertrend, with analysts constructively pressing for a turn toward addressing unresolved issues. A central question, around which this volume revolves, concerns identifying the ultimate goals that the United States should set in order to define the success of its China policy; possibilities include the orientation of China’s political system, the tenor of the U.S.-China relationship, and China’s international behavior. The United States should not make having China be a multiparty democracy a policy goal. Instead, attention should go to the two other kinds of end states — the U.S.-China relationship and China’s actions abroad. Some effort should be made to achieve a relatively stable bilateral relationship, though such a goal is highly conditional and not paramount. Instead, the most important goal of the United States’ China policy should be directed at shaping Chinese behavior — specifically, limiting its destructive actions and facilitating constructive behavior — with an eye intentionally toward both the short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explain the reasoning behind this position, this essay first provides a brief overview of the alternative approaches the United States has taken toward China over the past five decades and the key assumptions and goals of each strategy. It then provides succinct answers to key questions about China’s trajectory, the dynamics of the U.S.-China relationship, and the United States’ broader foreign policy goals, all of which are relevant for setting the primary goal for China policy. The essay concludes by suggesting how U.S. policy should be adjusted with the arrival of a new administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-strategies-to-date&quot;&gt;Alternative Strategies to Date&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the path toward normalization commenced in the early 1970s, the United States has adopted four distinct strategies toward China (see Figure 1). The approaches have differed on whether they have seen the U.S.-China relationship as essentially cooperative or competitive and over what kind of tactics they have thought would be most effective in achieving their goals. However, surprisingly, all four have shared one characteristic in common: none has been aimed at turning China into a multiparty democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pkdHshy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: U.S. Strategies toward China since 1972&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is widely recognized that regime type was a nonissue for the original opening to China. Instead, in the 1970s, during the latter part of the Cold War, Presidents Nixon and Carter were primarily focused on drawing China nearer to the United States and, consequently, away from the Soviet Union. A decade later, the administration of George H. W. Bush clearly discounted the relevance of China’s authoritarian system. Instead, motivated to keep relations stable as part of a broader realist view of maintaining a balance of power in international politics, they argued against heavily sanctioning China following the June 4 massacre in Tiananmen Square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less well-known is that those administrations that pursued a strategy of engagement were also not motivated to make turning China into a democracy a policy goal. Some analysts have argued that advocates of engagement believed that China’s democratization would naturally emerge from greater economic connectivity between the United States and China, what James Mann called “the soothing scenario.” Given the wave of democratization that occurred among former Soviet republics and in Central Europe, the existence of senior Chinese elites who favored at least some sort of political pluralism, and the emergence of the private sector in China, it would not have been outlandish at the time to make this connection. Nevertheless, promoting China’s political change was never a central motivation of any administration pursuing engagement. In fact, although Anthony Lake, President Clinton’s first national security adviser, put forward the idea of using trade to expand the number of market democracies, this idea was never translated into policy. And although President Clinton said on at least one occasion that China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) could generate pressures for political pluralization, analysts who have carefully reviewed the record convincingly argue that democratization was not a priority of the Clinton or George W. Bush administrations, or of congressional advocates for China’s WTO entry; the issue was mentioned for domestic political purposes. China experts were, and have remained, skeptical that greater trade would result in China’s democratization. Instead, the key arguments for WTO entry (or more accurately, for providing China permanent normal trade relations) have revolved around promoting the marketization of China’s economy and the consequent commercial benefits for the United States and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations also did not focus on China’s political regime as a target of policy. All assumed that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was ensconced in power and that it would be impossible for the United States, alone or in concert with others, to remove it, and that even an attempt to do so would be highly counterproductive to the United States’ national interests. And so, if Washington were to now make the replacement of the CCP regime by a multiparty democracy a preferred end state of its China policy, it would be breaking entirely with the precedent of every other previous administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous administrations have enacted their China policies — and thereby revealed their desired end states — by pursuing a certain kind of relationship with China and by trying to encourage and discourage certain kinds of Chinese behavior. Those that pursued engagement were not aiming to induce regime change, but instead to integrate China into the liberal international rules-based order as a way to induce marketization of its economy at home and less threatening behavior on both the economic and security fronts abroad. This patient approach was always combined with deterrence on security issues, especially with regard to Taiwan, and some restrictions around sharing the most advanced technologies. This was aptly described by some in the 1980s and 1990s as a strategy of “entanglement” or “constrainment.” By the mid-2000s, as China became more powerful and more active in global governance, the George W. Bush administration went one step further and tried to induce China to become a “responsible stakeholder” who would act in accordance with international norms across economic, security, and human rights spheres. The final attempt to use integration to induce Chinese behavior more aligned with international norms was the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Although China was not an original negotiating party, in the back of many minds was the desire to create a new agreement with higher standards that China would have to meet in order to maintain extensive commercial ties with its neighbors and advanced economies. But this effort was stillborn when the Trump administration withdrew on the first day of its administration, having an effect similar to that of the United States’ decision against joining the League of Nations almost a century earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump and Biden administrations both abandoned pursuing a relationship defined by cooperation with China and neither was optimistic that the United States could induce Chinese behavior consonant with U.S. interests. As will be discussed below, this is mainly the result of their assessment of China’s more problematic policy direction under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping. Neither administration sought regime change, but rather both have used alternative approaches against what they have determined is a strategic competitor. Like the Nixon, Carter, and George H. W. Bush administrations, the Trump administration saw the relationship entirely in terms of relative power and was not motivated by a desire to defend a broader liberal international order. By contrast, the Biden administration, akin to advocates of engagement in previous years, has made defending such an order the cornerstone of its broader foreign policy and its specific approach toward China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;answering-the-big-questions&quot;&gt;Answering the Big Questions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of previous administrations’ strategies, determining what should be the ultimate measure of success for the United States’ China policy going forward requires addressing key questions about the United States’ broader foreign policy goals, China’s current direction, and the factors shaping the U.S.-China relationship. In the interests of space — fully addressing each issue could be an article on its own — here is a list of the key questions and brief answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BROADER U.S. FOREIGN POLICY GOALS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Should the United States support the rules-based liberal international order?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes. This order has been hugely beneficial to U.S. national interests and has helped facilitate peace and prosperity around the world, including in East Asia, since the end of World War II. Its successful operation should be of paramount importance to the United States. That said, to be durable and have greater legitimacy, it clearly needs to be reformed to more effectively address the challenges of inequality, the changing nature of work, rising debt, climate change, public health threats, the role of the state in the market, and the blurring lines between the economy and national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Is it important for the United States to act in ways consistent with the principles of this order?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes. The order is both normatively attractive and materially beneficial to the United States. Regularly acting against its principles undermines the system’s legitimacy, effectiveness, and value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Is the United States powerful enough to defend this order on its own?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No. The United States needs others to proactively and enthusiastically participate in and contribute to the governance of this system as well as to defend it against violators, including China. Without widespread buy-in, involvement, and collective defense, the system will break down and its value will dissipate. Collaborating with others under the framework of a broader order expands the United States’ influence and raises its ability to deter and reassure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHINA’S DYNAMICS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Has China’s domestic and foreign policy become significantly more problematic under the leadership of Xi Jinping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes. Although the difference is not night and day and some of the changes preceded his ascendance to power, on Xi’s watch the CCP has substantially tightened up the political system, expanded party-state intervention in the economy, and pursued with more vigor economic and security policies inconsistent with the rules-based liberal international order. An important implication of this conclusion is that the United States’ overriding concern is not with the CCP regime per se, but rather with the policies of its current leadership. This means that if China’s overall policy direction were to change, the dangers to the United States and the international order would be less severe. Significantly, there are important segments of the broader Chinese population and elites who are dissatisfied with the country’s current overall direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Are China’s current overall foreign policy intentions to displace the United States as the world’s dominant superpower and establish a more illiberal international order?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is unclear. The language of Chinese leaders often criticizes the rules-based liberal international order and advocates for substantial reforms in line with CCP values and norms (such as the absolute sovereignty of states), but China also often praises elements of the current order (such as the United Nations and WTO), and it appears some of the more critical elements of their rhetoric are directed at a domestic audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Is China destined to be an economic superpower?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No. China has made huge, genuine strides in the past four decades, becoming dominant in manufacturing, prominent in many supply chains, and a leader in several high-tech sectors. However, China’s economy has major structural challenges that will constrain growth, and its current economic strategy, which is rooted in pursuing technology leadership, is depressing growth due to industrial-policy waste and growing tensions with trading partners. Going forward, China could encounter a crisis, muddle through with low growth, or revive growth with a more market-oriented strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Is the U.S.-China rivalry simply about relative power?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No. It is about both relative power and different visions — liberal and illiberal — of the international order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Can the United States shape China’s environment to limit negative behavior or its consequences and incentivize more constructive behavior?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes. This is possible if the United States pursues this in concert with other countries and in line with broader principles. Collective action creates higher material and reputational costs for China to act uncooperatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Does interdependence with China only carry risks to the United States’ economy and national security?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No. There are substantial risks, including being vulnerable to China’s non-market economy, practices, and threats to economic security (e.g., technology leakage, supply-chain dependence, and economic coercion). However, there also are substantial benefits: opportunities for greater business, more rapid innovation, and accelerated commercial competitiveness; the ability to maintain global technological leadership and Chinese dependence on Western technology; possibilities to increase China’s economic costs of engaging in military aggression; continued access to Chinese talent; greater ease of benchmarking Chinese capabilities; and the maintenance of lines of communication to reduce the chances of misunderstanding or a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above answers can be boiled down to the following: China’s current domestic and international trajectories are highly problematic, but they are also subject to substantial change even if the CCP remains in power. The United States’ aims toward China should be viewed through the prism of a broader contest over the international order. The United States can most effectively manage relations and shape China’s behavior by operating according to the norms of this rules-based order and in concert with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beyond-de-risking&quot;&gt;Beyond De-Risking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These insights should shape the overall goals of the United States’ China policy as well as the ways Washington pursues these aims in both the short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important “end state” for the United States’ China policy is not the nature of China’s political system or simply a more powerful United States, but rather the extent to which its China policy helps strengthen a reformed rules-based liberal international order. This outcome is unlikely to be furthered by an aggressive effort to undermine the CCP’s monopoly on power, which very well could lead to war or, at a minimum, an expensive waste of resources and energy that could be more effectively employed elsewhere. Conversely, the rules-based order would also not be promoted by eternal patience and the accommodation of China’s preferences about human rights, economic governance, sovereignty claims, and other issues in the name of maintaining friendly relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of either extreme, the United States should pursue a middle path of actively managing relations with China through a combination of deterrence and reassurance across issue areas, both on its own and in concert with others. In the short term, the goal would be to limit destructive Chinese behavior, or at least its consequences, and promote its constructive behavior where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach outlined here is likely closer in spirit and overall approach to the Biden administration’s strategy of the past three years than that of the Trump administration’s strategy before it. There is no doubt that adopting de-risking measures to address economic security risks has been and will continue to be necessary. Yet such steps — such as export controls, investment screening, and onshoring — need to be judicious, coordinated with other economies, and done in a manner consistent with the rules-based order. And where there are no rules or the rules are outdated, the United States must pursue revising the international system with a sense of urgency in order to avoid a race to the bottom. If the United States overly emphasizes defensive restrictions, it is likely to find itself with insufficient support to achieve its goals. Similarly, unconstrained industrial policy would likely result in massive waste, slower growth, less innovation, and weaker global competitiveness. Finally, the United States needs to avoid targeted de-risking measures escalating into a broader decoupling that would result in a bifurcated or fragmented global economy. Such an outcome would be economically costly to U.S. companies, workers, and consumers, while also denying the United States the benefits of maintaining commercial ties with China, as outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pursuing specific policies aligned with the principles of the broader order on a day-to-day basis is meant to provide long-term benefits in two ways. The first is simply through the gradual advancement of building and strengthening a successful rules-based order. The second is by maintaining an opportunity for China to eventually choose a path more consistent with this order. From today’s vantage point and with the current geometry of power in China, this second goal seems highly unlikely. However, given the prevalence of internal disquietude because of the trajectory of the country’s current political, economic, and foreign policies, an eventual tack back in the other direction is not out of the question. Hence, even if ties are highly constrained and defined largely by rivalry, maintaining civil ties and avoiding conflict would help “keep the pilot light on” for future generations of potential reformers. Similarly, the United States can only keep an open seat at the table for a future China if the United States continues to defend and nurture this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no consensus on the goals and approach of the China policy outlined here. That is reflected in disagreements about China’s trajectory, analyses of U.S.-China relations, and conflicting views about the international system. The final leg of this triangle may be the weakest given the chorus of criticisms from the left and right, alternatively, about globalization, multilateralism, and immigration. Yet this is a debate that needs to occur, with an evaluation of the costs and benefits of U.S. policies to date and a weighing of the strengths and weaknesses of various options going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, if one takes a historical view, the various policy approaches adopted over the past half-century, even if different, need not be seen as necessarily in inexorable conflict. Instead, one could argue that different times call for different strategies. There was a powerful logic in normalizing relations in order to counter the Soviet Union, but such a rationale had a finite life once the Soviet Union waned and then disappeared. Using engagement to facilitate integration did yield substantial value for a decade or more, on net benefiting the U.S. economy and restraining some of China’s most aggressive impulses. But as China became more powerful, the U.S. economy faltered, and faith in the underlying order waned, China shifted in a different, more contentious direction, pulling the United States to adjust accordingly. As Susan Shirk aptly describes, China “overreached,” and the United States then “overreacted.” It is now time for Washington to course correct again, from “de-risking” to “re-building,” not just the bilateral relationship, but the broader international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, Indian policymakers, scholars, and strategic affairs analysts have been grappling to contextualize the changes in international affairs and to understand what they mean for India’s interests. Some have contended that the world has entered a new state of disorder; unfortunately, the prescriptive utility of this analysis is extremely limited. Others argue that there is a definite, if gradual, shift toward a new Cold War–style architecture. Such an outcome is indeed a possibility and, moreover, is rather seductive, for it embodies the comfort of familiarity. Yet it underplays the peculiarities of present times. Finally, there are those who maintain that the world is between orders — that it is adrift, somewhere between bipolarity and classical multipolarity. Though this third framework accounts for the prevailing uncertainties and advises caution, it does not capture the opportunities that may be emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;constituents-of-the-new-order&quot;&gt;Constituents of the New Order&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last decade has witnessed the gradual reemergence of great power competition — between the United States and China. Assessed on broad metrics of power, and though there are significant differences between them, these two countries are the dominant global actors. Together, the United States and China account for over 42 percent of global GDP and over half of global defense spending. Moreover, increasingly, the prism of competition appears to be baked into their respective strategic worldviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, nearly three decades of economic globalization have built deep linkages between Chinese and U.S. economic and science and technology ecosystems. An unprecedented web of interconnected supply chains now powers the global economy. The Chinese economy is central to these networks and the health of the world economy. Shattering these bonds, therefore, would come at significant costs. The recent shift in discourse — away from decoupling to de-risking in the United States and from self-reliance to high-standard opening up in China — acknowledges that reality. In addition, while the current U.S.-China competition does exhibit an ideological hue, both sides have significant stakes in the existing international institutional architecture. Undoubtedly, both China and the United States have their own set of grievances with this architecture and are engaging in a certain degree of revisionism. However, neither appears to be driven by a revolutionary zeal to upend the UN-centered system. More importantly, even if revolution were an ambition for either, both are evidently inhibited by the constraints of their resources, capacities, domestic politics, and global appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complex interdependencies between and limitations of the United States and China have generated space for and shaped the decisionmaking of countries like India. In essence, the world appears to be in a state wherein great powers are seeking to compete by investing in domestic capacity, constraining and delegitimizing each other’s actions, and expanding their respective influences. Middle powers such as India, meanwhile, are pursuing capability enhancement, autonomy of action, and enhanced bargaining power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-view-from-delhi&quot;&gt;The View from Delhi&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his book, published on the eve of India’s 2024 parliamentary elections, S. Jaishankar, India’s external affairs minister, described the current international order as fragile and undergoing a “transition,” with sharpening great power competition enhancing stress factors across multiple domains. This, he argued, is likely to result in selective disengagement in certain areas of contention. Nevertheless, given the impacts of decades of economic globalization and the transnational nature of many challenges (e.g., climate change), interdependence and interconnectedness were likely to remain key features of the world order. Consequently, the challenge for countries like India was to identify opportunities and boost national capabilities, particularly in core and sensitive areas. This, Jaishankar wrote, was the key to ensuring strategic autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implicit in this analysis is an acknowledgment that distant developments increasingly have a direct bearing on Indian interests. The strategic impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the global balance of power, along with the war’s second-order effects on global finance and food and energy supply chains is a case in point. At the same time, Jaishankar’s analysis evidences India’s desire to engage more actively in mitigating these challenges and shaping a favorable external environment. This shift is a product of not only India’s expanding interests but also the country’s greater capacity and willingness to pursue them. In other words, if India’s earlier non-alignment was the product of a desire to not choose between competing blocs, multi-alignment, as the current strategy has been termed, is premised on a desire to expand options and choices. The objective of this strategy is to eventually fashion a multipolar world order, with India being a key pole. Indian strategic thought has long engendered a sense of manifest destiny regarding the country’s global role, and multipolarity in Asia, of course, is a prerequisite to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logical corollary to this line of thought is that neither extreme — a Cold War–style rivalry between China and the United States nor a coexistence that results in U.S. acquiescence of Chinese primacy in Asia — serves India’s interests. The former scenario narrows India’s options and potentially places it on a volatile frontline. The latter fundamentally alters Asia’s balance of power adversely for India. That said, Indian policymakers and analysts do not tend to view the U.S.-China relationship as a zero-sum game. Rather, they believe that the relationship exhibits strands of cooperation — albeit deeply strained — and of contention. India’s engagement with both great powers, therefore, is primarily rooted in pragmatism, prioritizing the country’s strategic interests, while being mindful of factors like geography, values, and legacy. Issue-based tents rather than ideological camps is what India would prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, a certain amount of friction between the United States and China on issues of security, values, trade, and technology is essential to opening up new formulations and dimensions of cooperation. Given the current state of affairs, fluidity is where India believes it can thrive. Of course, fluidity is not necessarily a sustainable state, nor is it desirable for the long term; it comes with significant challenges. By its very nature, fluidity engenders uncertainty. The occurrence of a black swan event, such as hostilities in the South China Sea or over Taiwan, can quickly erode the window of opportunity for middle powers and inhibit maneuverability. Such an event would also result in higher costs for accessing capital, markets, commodities, and technologies. Consequently, the transition from fluidity to multipolarity necessitates prompt deal-making to enhance developmental outcomes, build interdependencies based on shared interests and values, and rapidly expand national capabilities and power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interests-and-strategic-empathy&quot;&gt;Interests and Strategic Empathy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The India-U.S. relationship has grown by leaps and bounds over the past 25 years. This is a product of a convergence of strategic interests and sustained diplomatic engagement. Despite raucous public debates, there is an evident appreciation of the significance of a close partnership with the United States among the political elite in India. Economic ties with the United States are deeply consequential for India, particularly regarding access to technology, skills, capital, and markets. More significantly, the persistence of U.S. power in Asia is a necessary condition for India to ensure that the external environment remains conducive to its security and developmental goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, over the past 25 years, successive governments in New Delhi have pursued a deeper strategic partnership with Washington. Economically, the United States is among India’s largest trading partners. Security ties have also deepened, picking up pace after the signing of foundational defense agreements and the 2016 designation of India as a “Major Defense Partner.” The United States’ defense trade with India has expanded from near zero in 2008 to over $20 billion in 2020. Additionally, the two countries are also more deeply cooperating in the exchange and development of critical and emerging technologies. Finally, there has been greater diplomatic and intelligence engagement across a range of issues. In particular, the United States has played a key role in augmenting India’s capabilities to counter domestic threats, particularly through intelligence and defense cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, both sides appear to view the relationship as strategically symbiotic, rather than as a transactional arrangement. From a U.S. perspective, India’s growing market, skilled talent pool, democratic system, and shared normative vision for the world order make it an attractive partner. This has acquired greater salience recently, particularly given the rise of China and the United States’ domestic debates over recalibrating its own interests and commitments abroad. Washington’s desire to pursue more cost-effective means of influence, primarily by seeking an offshore balancing role and greater burden-sharing from allies and partners to achieve global objectives, also makes India an appealing partner. Consequently, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy acknowledges that a strong India is critical to further the United States’ vision of “freedom and openness” by expanding “autonomy and options” for regional actors. In other words, the United States views India’s growing power in Asia as critical to blunting the coercive edge of Chinese power. This is a goal that New Delhi shares, as evident by its engagement in the Quad, its support for AUKUS, and its public criticism of Chinese policy in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the United States and India, thus far, have demonstrated foresight and not let specific divergences in interests or narrow differences over values undermine their strategic congruence. The management of friction over India’s ties with Russia and its importation of Russian energy supplies, along with differences with the United States over human rights and democracy in India, are noteworthy examples. However, given the challenges inherent to fluidity, as discussed earlier, lines of communication absolutely must remain open and be utilized frequently. This is likely to remain a challenging endeavor. Maintaining strategic empathy requires constant engagement, clarification of expectations and limitations, and respect for each other’s political concerns. It also requires appreciating that the daily manifestations of shared values — such as respect for freedom and individual liberty, the sanctity of constitutionalism and rule of law, transparency in governance, inclusion, pluralism, and human rights — derive from social and national contexts. That, however, does not mean that their manifestations must be constrained by those contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quest-for-a-modus-vivendi&quot;&gt;Quest for a Modus Vivendi&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has long believed that a shared antipathy toward its rise is the fundamental driver of U.S.-India proximity. Chinese diplomats’ repeated calls for New Delhi to view bilateral relations in the context of the evolving global situation underscore this. China has predominantly relied on tools of coercion to shape and constrain India’s options. In doing so, China has also demonstrated increased risk tolerance and willingness to use force, likely emboldened by perceptions of its own superiority in terms of the bilateral balance of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, over the past decade, Chinese policies have shifted from being merely unaccommodating of India’s interests to being clearly hostile and adversarial. This has been particularly evident in the escalation of tensions along the countries’ disputed land border, China’s repeated blocking of the listing of Pakistan-based terrorists on the ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council, and its refusal to acquiesce to India’s membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group. China has remained steadfast on these issues, despite repeated high-level diplomatic attempts at a thaw, particularly in 2018 and 2019. It is little surprise then that the India-China relationship is at its worst since their 1962 war. Key to this relationship are structural factors, such as the expanded interests and capacities of the two countries, the asymmetry of power between them, and the shifts in the world order as characterized by U.S.-China competition. In addition, the persistence of the boundary dispute and escalation along the Line of Actual Control have deepened political mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing standoff between Indian and Chinese forces in Eastern Ladakh is now in its fifth year, with both sides having 60,000 forward-deployed troops. Politically, dialogue has largely stalled. There has been no formal bilateral meeting between the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and the Chinese president Xi Jinping since October 2019. Years of discord have dealt a severe blow to people-to-people relations, with people on both sides increasingly viewing the relationship through a threat prism rather than an opportunity one. This is also the dominant view of the strategic affairs communities in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, geography as well as economic and security concerns necessitate dialogue. It is simply not possible to wish away a neighbor or perennially eschew engagement, particularly when that neighbor is one of your largest trading partners, and trade with them is critical to your own manufacturing and export ambitions. Moreover, the absolute and opportunity costs of the sustained deployment of sizable forces along a frigid and harsh boundary terrain will sooner or later begin to take their toll. New Delhi’s quest, therefore, has been to arrive at a new modus vivendi with Beijing, one in which China accommodates India’s core interests and aspirations. This is encapsulated in India’s framework of the “three mutuals” — mutual respect, mutual sensitivity, and mutual interest. Ensuring adherence to these, however, requires a significant advancement of Indian power in order to narrow the differential with China. This is akin to the proposition put forward by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken of dealing with China from a position of strength. In this endeavor for India, the United States is an indispensable partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, from India’s perspective, sustained yet contained competition between the United States and China is desirable. It is in India’s interests for the United States to remain the preeminent power in a multipolar Asia. China, of course, would be part of such an order, although the balance of power would ideally have significantly constrained that country’s ability to coerce regional actors or to violate rules and norms. Ensuring this outcome requires the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Washington must maintain policy continuity, regardless of domestic political changes, and ensure sustained high-level engagement with the region, despite stress in other theaters. Second, the United States must work with allies and partners to build joint capabilities with the aim of blunting Beijing’s ability to coerce through threats of force. This requires action across domains including defense, economic development, resiliency in key supply chains, innovations in emerging technologies, and development of governance rules and norms based on shared values. Finally, it is inevitable that this process will generate friction; there is, in fact, a high probability of confrontation. It is, thus, imperative for Washington to engage Beijing with the aim of establishing escalation management mechanisms. Given the current circumstances, progress is likely to resemble two steps forward, one step back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has long been abundant evidence that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) poses a formidable challenge to U.S. interests, whether in matters directly relating to the national security of the United States or in matters relating to the security of U.S. allies and partners. But the United States would not be better served by attempting to bring about a particular outcome in its China policy: any “vision of victory” would either be too specific to be attainable or too abstract to be actionable. If such a vision were elaborated in all of its details, the United States would face the problem of lacking the policy instruments for engineering political and economic developments on the other side of the world; it is difficult enough for the United States to implement a vision for how its own polity and economy will develop, let alone in China. If, on the other hand, a vision of victory should be defined in terms of abstractions, it would necessarily be subject to a wide range of interpretations and lack clear benchmarks for measuring its progress and eventual success. Moreover, in attempting to pursue those abstractions, the United States would introduce substantial risks in its relations with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and with its own allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To elaborate on this critique more fully, it is helpful to first provide a working definition of a “vision of victory” with regard to China. Judging by recent proposals along these lines, this concept can be defined as follows: to make it inconceivable that China would seek to contest U.S. primacy in international relations, especially in the Indo-Pacific. Pursuant to this end, the United States would seek some combination of degrading PRC capabilities (both military and economic) and encouraging liberal reforms within the PRC that would weaken the CCP’s hold on power. In this view, the United States would be able to claim victory once it became clear that China could no longer achieve its strategic and operational objectives under any contingency scenario that involved the introduction of U.S. forces and assets. This would be deterrence by denial, but on a systematic and comprehensive scale. The United States would also be able to claim victory once China was transformed into a liberal state that (it is assumed) would observe more moderation and restraint in its foreign policy. The scale of these ambitions is vast — so vast, in fact, that this vision seems very much like a pipe dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a vision of victory would go beyond the strategic requirements of the challenge that the United States faces. Safeguarding U.S. national security does not require the United States to “defeat” China, but rather to deter China from taking actions that would jeopardize U.S. interests. This is a tall order, to be sure, but it considers contingencies, capabilities, operations, and tactics that are finite and concrete. Many of them, such as the range of scenarios that involve Beijing trying to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, have already been elaborated in public documents. While some of these analyses necessarily involve a degree of speculation, any speculation is subject to the discipline of the facts on the ground: Does Beijing have the capability to launch a fait accompli that would enable it to seize control of Taiwan before the United States (and U.S. allies and partners) could intervene? Does the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have the requisite capabilities for launching a major amphibious operation across the strait? Does Taiwan have the resiliency needed to prevent the PLA from securing a beachhead within a matter of days? The answers to these questions may not be straightforward, but their operational and tactical dimensions are fairly well defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aperture of speculation widens to unmanageable proportions once U.S. strategy is conceived of as a vision of victory. If the United States is to plan for a future “V-Day” in the Indo-Pacific, then it must take into account — and even try to influence — what happens the day before V-Day, and what happens the day before the day before V-Day, and so on. The longer the time horizon over which this vision is to unfold, the more difficult it will be to put it into practice because the variables and constraints will multiply with every passing day. The difficulty is magnified by the fact that, in contrast to victory in war, victory in peace is neither easy to see nor to define: nobody will be waving a white flag, nobody will be signing instruments of surrender, and nobody will pay reparations to the victor. Consider, for instance, the earlier definition in which China “could no longer achieve its strategic and operational objectives under any contingency scenario that involved the introduction of U.S. forces and assets.” In the abstract, that is clear enough, but what does it mean in practice? How could the United States ever be certain that China would be incapable of achieving its objectives if the United States intervened? Not only would such a vision require a complete description of all potential contingencies, but it would also require the United States to have absolute confidence in the outcome of a range of hypothetical scenarios. Such confidence would be either elusive or fundamentally misguided. It is impossible to predict the outcome of a war before it starts, even if all of the available information suggests that one side has a decisive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a vision of victory would not help the United States secure appreciable gains, and it would introduce significant risk. If the issue at stake is taking more decisive action in the United States’ China policy — by bolstering U.S. capabilities in the Indo-Pacific, for example — then it is entirely possible to rationalize and implement those policies without a vision of victory. The United States can compete more vigorously with China without defining its objective as the defeat of China. The concept of a vision of victory is neither necessary nor sufficient for prescribing policy changes that would more effectively safeguard U.S. interests. The difference is largely one of branding, and that branding could be detrimental to the United States even if the policies themselves are sound. There is a risk that if the United States declares its vision of victory, the PRC will be locked into a posture of hostility, especially if Beijing comes to believe that the United States seeks regime change. Under that scenario, Beijing would likely lose all interest in engaging on issues of importance to the United States, including continuing dialogue between their military forces, halting fentanyl production and trafficking, mitigating the effects of climate change, and regulating AI. As much as U.S.-China relations may have deteriorated in recent years, they could deteriorate even further, and the United States still needs some degree of cooperation from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to consider how U.S. allies and partners will respond. Concerns about their reactions have been raised before, though they are not always fully elaborated. The Biden-Harris administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy relies extensively on the United States’ alliances and partnerships, and that context provides enough reason to ask whether a U.S. vision of victory would find support outside of the United States. But supposing that a more unilateral strategy could be formulated, how important would it be to consider the views of allies and partners? The Cold War concept of “neutralism” offers an answer: the posture of not aligning with either of the great powers. U.S. strategy throughout the Cold War was often concerned with preventing the spread of neutralism among U.S. allies and partners. At the start of the Korean War, for example, an intelligence estimate concluded that failure by the United States to intervene in Korea would “strengthen existing widespread desire for neutrality” in Japan because it would “add force to the argument that alignment of Japan with the United States would, while inviting Soviet aggression, in no way ensure American protection of Japan against such aggression.” According to the estimate, neutralism would also spread in West Germany. While the United States does not currently face the prospect of a wholesale disengagement from the U.S. alliance system, it must ask itself whether its allies and partners see the United States as a strategic asset or as a strategic liability over the long term. If the United States pursues a more confrontational approach in its relations with China — even if that confrontation is circumscribed to the branding of U.S. strategy — will U.S. allies and partners see that approach as shielding them from PRC aggression, or triggering the PRC to retaliate? Bonnie Glaser has raised a similar point in the debate on strategic ambiguity and strategic clarity in the Taiwan Strait. The risks for U.S. allies and partners become even more acute under a vision of victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might argue that the United States could offset these risks for its allies and partners in how it implements its vision of victory. In this view, any increased risk of PRC retaliation could be compensated for by an increased U.S. defense commitment. But that kind of assurance would not be very comforting to U.S. allies and partners, who would become even more dependent on the United States for their security because of actions that the United States had taken. This development would be particularly alarming for U.S. partners, who, lacking a formal alliance treaty, would harbor doubts about the United States’ willingness to intervene in their defense. Public opinion research from Taiwan, for example, has shown that there is considerable fluctuation year to year in terms of how the Taiwanese public views the credibility of the United States (defined as being “consistent in its words and actions 講信用”). Doubts about U.S. credibility cannot be completely addressed by declaring a policy of strategic clarity, since adopting a policy of clarity would only be a change of words. Allies and partners might choose instead to distance themselves from the United States, leading to the spread of neutralism that the United States feared during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vision of victory has a certain appeal in terms of its simplicity and clarity. Yet this appeal, which often invokes the Cold War, can be misleading in how it interprets history, and thus lead to a poorly conceived strategy. When the United States decided to intervene in the Korean War, its objective was not only to impose costs on North Korea. It was also to reassure U.S. allies that an alliance with the United States was worth more than what it cost: aligning with Washington might raise tensions with U.S. adversaries, but the promise of U.S. support was credible enough to convince those allies to choose Washington’s side. A vision of victory, on the other hand, has the potential to remind U.S. allies of the risks, rather than the benefits, of an alliance with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics might claim that there’s a logical inconsistency: if the United States’ intervention in the Korean War enhanced U.S. credibility and galvanized support for alliances with the United States, why would a vision of victory with regard to China not have the same effect? The difference has to do with which side would be perceived as changing the status quo and what the nature of that status quo would be. The North Korean attack on June 25, 1950, was a brazen act of aggression in flagrant violation of the UN Charter; in President Truman’s words, “The attack upon Korea makes it plain beyond all doubt that Communism has passed beyond the use of subversion to conquer independent nations and will now use armed invasion and war.” The international communist movement had tried to create a new status quo in which U.S. allies and partners were potentially subject to armed attack; U.S. intervention restored the status quo ante, by defeating North Korea in war and deterring North Korea in peace. A vision of victory against China, on the other hand, would involve the United States trying to create a new status quo in how it defines its strategic objectives; and if China reacts with hostility, then the United States would be creating a condition of insecurity for its allies and partners. Adopting a vision of victory would not be a case of the United States saving the free world from communism, but rather of the United States setting itself, its allies, and its partners on a collision course with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-vision-of-success-in-the-us-china-rivalry-the-technological-competition&quot;&gt;A Vision of Success in the U.S.-China Rivalry: The Technological Competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. strategy toward China is currently focused on the requirements of persistent competition rather than on a clear vision of success or end state. Arguably, nowhere is that more evident than in the most important single measure of competitive advantage: the competition in basic science and frontier technologies. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has identified this domain as a critical leverage point for national power, and its strategies — ranging from massive state subsidies to intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers — to achieve leadership, or even dominance, in key technologies have caused severe strains in its relationship with the United States and others. The United States has responded with a series of actions designed to sustain or recapture scientific and technological leadership — limits on high-technology exports and outbound investment, massive investments in the U.S. semiconductor and renewable energy industries, increased research and development (R&amp;amp;D) spending, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few treatments of the U.S.-China technology competition, however, have addressed the question of objectives: What would count as a successful endgame for this specific contest? Developing a concept of success for such a wide-ranging and ongoing competition, while extremely difficult, is essential. Absent such a construct, the current U.S. approach risks embracing competition for its own sake and rushing down blind alleys without a clear sense of where policy will lead. The recent spate of semiconductor-oriented export controls is a perfect example. While they are based on a clear sense of the importance of cutting-edge chips, even the architects of such policies admit that their true long-term results — such as how much of a delay they will impose upon China, how Beijing’s responses will reshape the future technology competition, and how the loss of markets will affect the semiconductor industry — cannot be known. The only vision of success that appears to animate these actions is a very broad idea of staying ahead of China in semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several studies have suggested lists of basic outcomes for the U.S.-China science and technology competition, and such lists are useful as far as they go. But U.S. strategists need something more — a broader idea of what success looks like that describes how those outcomes can be produced on an enduring basis and that nests them within a larger vision of how the overall rivalry can reach a more stable and lasting equilibrium that itself can serve as an endgame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay offers such a vision, based primarily on lessons from the history of prior scientific and technological revolutions. The goal is neither to assess who is winning nor to lay out a comprehensive strategy, but rather to sketch out a lasting recipe for security and competitive advantage within a larger concept of a trajectory toward an endgame for the rivalry, one that can provide a target for U.S. strategy. In the process, the essay focuses in some depth on one especially critical field of technology — artificial intelligence (AI) — and offers one especially important overarching theme: a stable outcome of the current competition has much less to do with metrics of relative standing with major rivals and instead relies much more on the fundamental national qualities which underwrite dynamism and competitive advantage. The most compelling concept of success must be built around a dynamic, effective, and innovative U.S. competitive engine in science and technology, an approach that is consistent with a program to encourage the long-term mellowing of the rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vision of success proposed here marries this core ideal of domestic scientific and technological dynamism with two other elements. First, any successful outcome will be one in which the United States remains at the hub of the global science and technology networks of the twenty-first century. Second, success requires that the United States achieves enough national resilience to mitigate key vulnerabilities and dependencies related to science and technology, a concept that implies, at a minimum, preventing Chinese monopolies or effective dominance of essential scientific and technological fields. Current U.S. policy embraces all of these themes, to some degree. But the important insight for U.S. strategy is that these three concepts — a world-leading engine of scientific and technological progress, network power, and resilience — can provide the essential ingredients for a vision of success in scientific and technological competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-rivalry-for-global-economic-and-technological-supremacy&quot;&gt;A Rivalry for Global Economic and Technological Supremacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China rivalry takes place in many domains — such as military capabilities, cultural influence, the ability to shape the international system, and battles of narratives. But both sides appear to believe that the contest for leadership in a set of frontier technologies may be the most decisive struggle of all. Many analysts of scientific and technological trends agree that the nations of the world are confronting a transformational moment, with one economic-technological era giving way to another. A set of emerging technologies, including biotechnology, quantum science, advanced manufacturing, and most of AI — discussed at some length below — may be fashioning a new Industrial Revolution with even more profound implications than the last two. The great powers which master this new revolution will gain tremendous competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHINA’S VIEWS OF TECHNOLOGY COMPETITION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Chinese leadership has come to see science and technology as the essential requirement for national competitive success. China-watcher Tanner Greer recently catalogued the numerous ways in which the senior leadership of the Peoples’ Republic of China (PRC) has declared, in word and deed, the priority they place on technological progress and advantage. The 2024 National Peoples’ Congress Work Report, for example, calls out developing China “through science and technology” as the basic avenue to economic competitiveness. As Greer and Nancy Yu put it, “The central task of the Chinese state is to build an industrial and scientific system capable of pushing humanity to new technological frontiers.” They cite a 2016 PRC planning document which lays out the goal of China becoming the “leading scientific power in the world.” Recent statements such as these build on earlier programs for scientific and technological advantage, such as the “National Medium- and Long-Term Program for Science and Technology Development (2006–2020),” which explicitly stated its goal: “In the 21st century, China, being a large developing nation, is to accelerate its [science and technology] development and narrow down the gaps with the developed nations. To this end, the nation must make unremitting efforts for a long period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent emphasis on technology in the Chinese system has deep roots in pre-communist-era analyses of how China fell behind in the industrial age, Marxist historical materialism, and various other sources. As Greer and Yu write, many Chinese sources refer to a “hinge point in history,” a transition point in economic life, and they believe that the set of emerging technologies is creating that today. A recent study entitled National Security and the Rise and Fall of Great Powers by a Chinese think tank also emphasizes science and technology as the leading “general law” that determines national fates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent form this thinking has taken is the Chinese discussion of “new quality productive forces.” This is another way of referring to a set of science and technology advances that empower national strength. As economist Arthur Kroeber writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These slogans culminate a major shift in China’s overall economic policy direction that has been building for two decades, and that has accelerated noticeably in the last five or so years of Xi’s administration. China has now decisively moved away from the growth-maximizing orientation that prevailed from 1979 until the early 2010s, which prioritized systemic reforms to achieve as high a GDP growth rate as possible. The new economic vision prioritizes the acquisition and development of technology — especially “hard” technologies that require a large industrial and manufacturing base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In service of these general concepts, Beijing’s Made in China 2025 program is designed to channel state investment into a set of 10 critical technologies with the goal of achieving relative leadership, if not global predominance. With ideas of innovation chains and productive networks clearly in mind, China is investing in technology components throughout these chains. In the process — and especially after recent U.S. technology export controls — Beijing has placed an increasing focus on self-reliance and indigenous production of key technologies. This year’s Third Plenum of the 20th Party Congress reemphasized these factors, doubling down on China’s development strategy, which focuses on dominating key frontier industries to achieve “high-quality” development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s endgame in the technology competition, then, is in one sense clear enough. There can be little doubt that Beijing aims to be the unquestioned global leader in a whole series of science- and technology-based industries, from 5G and renewable energy to electric vehicles and biotechnology. (In parallel, it is seeking dominance in less technologically cutting-edge industries such as shipbuilding.) How precisely China defines success in these terms is not clear, although in some cases, such as solar panels, it has achieved something close to a global monopoly position in manufacturing, and in 5G China was apparently seeking to position Huawei similarly as the overwhelmingly dominant global actor. This position of technological overmatch would consequently provide Beijing with tremendous leverage in its broader effort to achieve global leadership. China’s favored end state in the technology competition therefore envisions overall supremacy in many critical fields, all of which can be employed for broader geostrategic effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE UNITED STATES’ APPROACH TO THE COMPETITION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the United States’ approach to the technology competition has been far less comprehensive, strategic, and nationally directed, instead relying on a more laissez-faire attitude that largely counted on the private sector to produce the necessary national scientific and technological strengths. In fact, despite earlier emphases on technology competition with Japan, until the late 2000s the United States did not even fully recognize that it was engaged in a national technology competition with China at all. This began to change in the Trump administration and was fully overturned in the Biden administration, which brought a new focus to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan made perhaps the most elaborate statement about the contest in a 2022 speech. “Advancements in science and technology are poised to define the geopolitical landscape of the 21st century,” he argued. “They will generate game-changers in health and medicine, food security, and clean energy. We’ll see leap-ahead breakthroughs and new industries that drive our prosperity. And, of course, new military and intelligence capabilities that will shape our national security.” Sullivan laid out an ambitious goal for the U.S. strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On export controls, we have to revisit the longstanding premise of maintaining “relative” advantages over competitors in certain key technologies. We previously maintained a “sliding scale” approach that said we need to stay only a couple of generations ahead. That is not the strategic environment we are in today. Given the foundational nature of certain technologies, such as advanced logic and memory chips, we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A later speech by Secretary of State Antony Blinken expanded on the significance of the technology competition. He identified six technologies as core to the U.S. competitive strategy: “microelectronics, advanced computing and quantum technologies, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and biomanufacturing, advanced telecommunications, and clean energy technologies.” Blinken introduced a key principle of U.S. strategy — not an isolating “digital sovereignty” as China has proposed, but rather engaging in “digital solidarity” with friends and allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. response to China’s goals has taken shape gradually and incrementally. At least three major tools have so far been in evidence. First, the Biden administration has invested large sums in catalyzing certain domestic U.S. technology industries — most notably semiconductors and renewable energy — in a bid to match selected elements of China’s industrial policy. Second, the United States has sought to set back efforts of specific Chinese firms to achieve dominance (or at least parity) in critical domains. Major examples of this strategy include sanctions against the Chinese firms ZTE and Huawei, targeted outbound investment restrictions, efforts to convince other countries to spurn Chinese firms and investment, and semiconductor export limits. (In the process, the United States has sought to identify chokepoints or “chokeholds,” specific firms or dependencies that U.S. policy can use to constrain China’s technology development.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not yet evident, however, if the Biden administration or other U.S. analysts and commentators have a clear idea of what this must or could all add up to. The U.S. strategy so far seems to lack a clear theory of success, and its embrace of apparently never-ending competition has the potential to lead to substantial mission creep. As one account suggests, the intensity of the U.S. competitive vision contains elements that “seek to eradicate, root and branch, China’s entire ecosystem of advanced technology,” which more than one observer has described as acts of economic warfare. The United States has embraced an approach that at least implies a campaign to constrain China’s general technological and economic advances, something that is viewed in Beijing as a generalized threat to the regime’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also not clear, however, whether the current U.S. approaches will even work in the long run. While U.S. policy might have restrained the spread of Huawei to a few key countries, for example, the firm has managed to thrive despite U.S. sanctions. Whether U.S. semiconductor sanctions can provide a lasting advantage — or if they will merely prompt China to develop indigenous production years before it might otherwise have done — remains an open question. Both situations starkly illustrate the problem of sustaining a truly targeted approach to technology competition. Sanctions against individual firms or technologies do not address the larger ecosystems that support China’s development. Yet going after the wider ecosystem, as a growing list of U.S. technology sanctions has sought to do, implies a completely unrestrained technology conflict. China, meanwhile, is gearing up to build tools to retaliate against U.S. technology constraints. These challenges and risks are increasingly evident in what may become the centerpiece of the scientific and technological contest in years ahead — the development and, perhaps even more importantly, the practical application of the wide range of tools collectively known as AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE SPECTER OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefits of AI to the great powers remain a mystery. Some economic forecasts envision a massive boost to productivity and growth, while others are less optimistic. If even part of the hype surrounding AI’s economic and military applications proves true, this area of the technological competition may decide the U.S.-China rivalry all by itself. Some analysts expect further developments in AI — including, perhaps, the achievement of artificial general intelligence, the moment when an AI model can solve a broad range of problems and operate autonomously through many stages of self-determined action in ways that vastly outpace human consciousness — to augment national power in almost magical ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If AI has such effects, whoever gets to critical thresholds first, or whoever develops a massive lead in a more gradual and emergent process, will enjoy a competitive advantage far beyond even that granted to earlier great powers by the Industrial Revolution. Many commentators agree with the recent statement of the U.S. Special Competitive Studies Project that, “The geopolitical and technological imperatives of the emerging international landscape demand a grand strategy, one that harnesses the transformative potential of AI and other emerging technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How all of this will play out remains unknown. Export controls on semiconductors and other AI-supporting technologies may provide the United States with a significant and growing lead that it never relinquishes, or AI progress may stall across the board. New forms of AI may begin to deliver astonishing levels of national advantage, or not. The only thing clear today is that the potential of AI to be the single point of success or failure in the technology competition is very real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conceptualizing-endgames-in-scientific-and-technological-contests&quot;&gt;Conceptualizing Endgames in Scientific and Technological Contests&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contest for the high ground of science and technology in the twenty-first century, and in particular for predominance in AI, represents one of the very few essential components of the larger U.S.-China rivalry. Both countries have embraced strategies for scientific and technological advantage that are increasingly creating a zero-sum mindset in the other, both, evidently, without a clear sense of what success looks like. One leading observer has noted that the United States “stumbled into” the generalized application of export controls and other technology restrictions: “We started using these weapons before we really knew how to use them.” As the intensity of the overall rivalry worsens, moreover, the significance of the technology competition will grow as well. The more each side comes to fear war as an inevitable outcome of the rivalry, the more each will view victory in the technology competition — and its implications for military and societal capabilities in conflict — as an existential priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current U.S. approach to this contest includes many important and necessary steps — investing in U.S. science and technology, nurturing talent in key fields, protecting U.S. technology from slipping into the hands of rivals, and developing partnerships with allies and friends. But the present approach promises only endless competition without a horizon; it does not spell out a true long-term theory of success. The ways in which the United States can protect its most critical national interests and sustain truly necessary degrees of power and influence remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptualizing an endgame or vision of enduring success for a broad-based scientific and technological competition is extremely challenging, for several reasons. Treatments of the issue often use buzzwords like “control,” “hegemony,” or “domination” to describe potential great power influence over technology domains, but no such clean outcomes are likely. Competition encompasses myriad frontier technologies and dozens of subcomponents within each domain. Perhaps most of all, because science and technology advance without end, establishing a clear threshold for success or anything like a singular endgame remains elusive. This makes the contest in science and technology different from the larger rivalry, which, as a geopolitical phenomenon, can (and, if history is any guide, will) end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge relates specifically to AI and biotechnology. In these areas, the United States and China face not only competition from one another, but also threats from the technologies themselves. Unconstrained development of these domains has the potential to pose existential risks to either or both sides. Any vision of success must seek to mitigate those threats as well as guarantee national competitive position. What vision of enduring and stable success would serve all these goals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;visions-of-success-in-scientific-and-technological-revolutions-the-lessons-of-history&quot;&gt;Visions of Success in Scientific and Technological Revolutions: The Lessons of History&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to history, specifically, to the last transformational scientific and technological advances, is essential to developing an answer. What lessons might the scientific revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Industrial Revolution spanning the eighteenth to twentieth centuries, and the twentieth-century computing revolution offer for conceptualizing success in the current scientific and technological competition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section relies on an extensive literature review, much of which was consulted for the RAND project on the social foundations of national competitiveness. That literature reviewed the sources and character of the Industrial Revolution, the factors energizing national dynamism and development in general, explanations for the West’s stunning surge of economic and technological development after 1500, and more focused assessments of scientific and technological revolutions. That broad set of sources offers several lessons that are applicable to the current scientific and technological competition. Taken together, they point in the direction of the three essential components mentioned above: domestic dynamism, network power, and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology revolutions encompass many interrelated technologies and techniques.&lt;/strong&gt; Different countries might lead in distinct areas, but overall success comes from remaining competitive in a wide set of areas and in ways that provide critical synergies. It is the holistic interaction of these technologies that produces major advantage. During the Industrial Revolution, for example, the technologies of steam, railroads, mass production, and advanced agriculture, among others, comprised a much broader scientific and technological advance. Investing in a handful of leading technologies individually will not be enough for more comprehensive forms of success.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The essential basis for scientific and technological advance is a supportive package of social qualities, with values, habits, and institutions that promote innovation and its widespread adoption throughout society.&lt;/strong&gt; Many studies have demonstrated the importance of social values, structures, and institutions to innovation. The scientific and industrial revolutions were deeply grounded in such qualities, without which individual inventions and scientific breakthroughs would not have had their transformative effects. This understanding also comes in part from RAND’s analysis on the sources of long-term competitive advantage, which highlights seven major societal characteristics — including a forward-looking ambition, shared opportunity among the people, a learning and adapting mindset, and effective institutions, among others — that create the context for more material forms of national advantage, be it economic growth, military power, or technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The supporting ecosystem for scientific and technological advance — including resources, infrastructure, energy, human capital, social values, and more — is the essential basis for long-term competitive advantage.&lt;/strong&gt; Beyond the general societal characteristics that underwrite advantage in these areas, the most competitive nations have strong scientific and technology ecosystems — a broader context of material capabilities and networks, with elements ranging from capital to skilled workforces, and from transportation and energy infrastructure to intellectual networks among scientists and entrepreneurs — that provide the necessary support structure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science and technology are by nature shared and now global enterprises, and their advance cannot be limited to one country except in very specific industries and usually for limited periods of time.&lt;/strong&gt; Any vision of success must think primarily in terms of generating greater national dynamism rather than denying advances to others. There are exceptions to this rule, such as industries or specific technologies where one firm or country manages to acquire unique capabilities, tacit knowledge, and sometimes specific technologies to dominate an industry. Examples include the German optics industry in the twentieth century and the present-day Dutch semiconductor lithography producer ASML. As a rule, however, history suggests that countries exist within a broad flow of scientific and technological progress, which is often propelled by shared breakthroughs and ideas and even investment across borders. The degree to which nations keep up is a function of their own domestic qualities, not others’ constraints. During the Industrial Revolution, for example, efforts to quash others’ progress played a relatively small role in determining relative standing, which was largely a function of key internal variables that determined each country’s scientific and technological prowess. A vision of success predicated upon denying progress to a rival, except for in a very small number of highly targeted and usually temporary controls, will not work in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific and technological innovation is often initially fueled by the insights and efforts of a relatively small number of critically important scientists, entrepreneurs, engineers, and tinkerers.&lt;/strong&gt; This was very much the story of the Industrial Revolution, in which a few hundred critical innovators, and a larger but still modest number of innovator-implementers in Britain, made a disproportionate difference. (The lesson here is not that the actual breakthroughs from a handful of geniuses make all the difference — quite the opposite, wider diffusion of those inventions, spurred by a broader community of application-focused engineers and tinkerers, is key. But those technically expert individuals who led the diffusion still represent only a tiny proportion of a nation’s overall population.) Creating an environment that empowers such actors, both the original inventors and those making practical applications — with capital, the rule of law, regulatory clearance, and other supports — is therefore an important component of the wider domestic environment needed for progress. In its most successful guises, this is usually a process of “mass flourishing” — bottom-up aggregations of dynamism rather than centralized direction.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-mover advantage is not permanent, but catching up requires the right national support system.&lt;/strong&gt; So far there has not been a general technological revolution monopolized by a single country. Second movers can catch up and sometimes have certain advantages from doing so, but only if they manage to cultivate the essential supportive ecosystem. In the industrial era, only one country — Japan — managed this feat from a position of significant inferiority. Some analysts believe that there may be a profound first-mover advantage in AI, because the first countries past certain thresholds will begin to experience explosive growth and innovation; but this is a contested idea, based more on speculation than hard analysis at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government support is almost always critical for at least some steps in the process.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a strong relationship between scientific and technological advantage and open, market-based systems, at least in the modern era. But comprehensive national programs of development, or efforts to align themselves to the demands of a new technological era, do not happen on their own. They require some level of what the RAND project termed an “active state” — efforts to promote and shape the necessary advances, and to mitigate their socioeconomic risks. Japan again provides a leading example of the competitive value of targeted and effective government action, both in the Meiji and postwar periods — through support for research and economic intelligence, direct backing for national champions, investments in infrastructure, and other means.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diffusion is at least as important as technological breakthroughs to long-term sustained advantage.&lt;/strong&gt; There is a significant literature on the role of diffusion in generating technological advantage, much of it arguing that many entrepreneurs in different states might generate similar ideas and even test products, but if those ideas and products do not spread throughout a society and become applied in numerous ways, the country will not gain the full degree of competitive advantage. The institutions, skills, and capabilities required for diffusion are somewhat different from those of initial innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The accumulation of tacit knowledge is one of the most essential foundations for long-term success in scientific and technological innovation.&lt;/strong&gt; Tacit knowledge is understanding or expertise built up through long experience — things like insight, intuition, skills in operating equipment, and other forms of knowledge that are not formalized or objective and therefore are difficult to express or transfer. Significant evidence suggests that countries or firms which accumulate tacit knowledge in key fields gain the potential for long-term advantage. This again points to the essential role of a broad-based socioeconomic foundation for technological progress, one which embeds tacit knowledge throughout multiple firms and industries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific and technological advances reshape the societies in which they occur, in ways that either promote long-term solidarity, resilience, and dynamism, or that cause disruptions and instabilities that undermine competitive standing.&lt;/strong&gt; History suggests that long-term success in scientific and technological competitions is not mainly, or even mostly, about simple measures of relative standing. Instead, such success concerns how technological advances echo through society and create or disrupt patterns of social, economic, and political life in ways that either enhance or undermine national competitive dynamics and resilience. Especially in their early phases, these effects can be deeply disempowering for workers and average people. The initial decades of the Industrial Revolution, for example, were devastating for wages and opportunities for many elements of the working and middle classes in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Countries that lead frontier technologies tend to become the hubs of international networks of research and production around those technologies, and to dominate norm and standard setting for these domains.&lt;/strong&gt; The fundamental international scaffolding for any science and technology revolution involves a combination of networks of exchange, norms, rules, and standards that end up providing advantages to some countries over others. Like so many other forms of advantage, these tend to reflect synergistic dynamics, with some elements building on others. During the Industrial Revolution, to cite one example, Britain’s position in world trade networks, standard setting for emerging technologies, and influence in international institutions that began to set the context for science and technology reinforced the country’s advantage conveyed by its domestic dynamism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-vision-of-success&quot;&gt;A Vision of Success&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing a vision of success requires the United States to define its goals: What is it trying to achieve? What are the ends against which success should be measured?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lessons of history and the challenges posed by China to U.S. interests suggest at least four necessary components, or objectives, of any concept of success in the scientific and technological rivalry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The domestic U.S. foundations of scientific and technological innovation, including the supporting science and technology ecosystem, must remain at a world-class level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The domestic capability for the diffusion and application of those technologies — the financial and infrastructural foundations of the technology ecosystem, the domestic standard-setting processes, the supply of educated specialists to develop new breakthroughs, and much more — must be vibrant and effective at enabling the practical employment of advances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No major rival should obtain a monopoly position or a lasting, dominant advantage in any critical field of science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States should remain free from catastrophic risk to its science and technology sector, military capabilities, or broader society due to foreign dependencies on supplies of the most essential components or materials or vulnerability to active disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that these objectives do not require the United States to achieve monopoly or a lasting dominant position in any arena. The lessons of history seem to be clear on this point: among the most advanced science and technology powers, the goal cannot be to achieve monopoly or controlling position in any technology area for a sustained period. Such outcomes are possible for a limited time and only in very specific fields. Long-term national security and power comes from seeking the four broader and more self-directed goals above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those objectives, combined with the lessons surveyed above, point to one essential finding about scientific and technological advantage: success starts not with performance relative to a rival, but with the qualities of a nation and its society that offer the basis for enduring innovation, development, diffusion, and societal mitigation efforts. That is the primary lesson of earlier scientific and technological revolutions. Britain did not actively seek to ruin French or Prussian/German modernization (or did so only at the margins). Instead, the country generated an engine of scientific and technological application that could not be matched. That was the only effective route to long-term advantage; and it was, in large part, when Britain lost the societal and economic prerequisites for dynamism that their advantage flagged, and they could not bring about an endgame of true success. Their earlier recipe for success is the model the United States should seek to follow. The Western technology controls applied to the Soviet Union made some difference, but the real determinant of success was the relative energy and dynamism of the two societies and their institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/80xqLXP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Conceptualizing a Vision of Success in the U.S.-China Science and Technology Competition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure above outlines the three-part vision of success in graphical terms. As it suggests, the centerpiece for any enduring positive end state in such a competition is a domestic engine of dynamism and technological integration. Everything flows from that — national competitive advantage, resilience, and standing relative to others. The domestic foundation for success in turn has three major components: nurturing a supportive ecosystem for science and technology, promoting diffusion, and managing the wider social effects of technology for competitive advantage. As suggested above, those in turn rely on even more essential national qualities — ambition and willpower, solidarity, widely shared social opportunity, an innovative and learning mindset, effective institutions, and other factors essential to a healthy engine of dynamism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wider recipe for success includes two other elements which support that core domestic emphasis. One is a supportive international context in the form of rules and norms, and also friendly networks and coalitions that underwrite U.S. scientific and technological strength, so that the United States continues to sit at the hub of critical network power in science and technology. A second element involves a future in which critical vulnerabilities and dependencies have been mitigated to some degree, especially in that very small number of technologies or areas of scientific knowledge where ensuring some sort of lead or advantage may have disproportionate leverage over the wider competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach does not emphasize holding China back as a necessary component of any vision for success. A good end state emerges from domestic vibrancy paired with strong positions in global networks. The challenge emerges in avoiding Chinese dominance in key industries where the United States and its friends and allies do not have competitive industries. There will be a great temptation to punish Chinese firms in order to attempt to level the playing field rather than push to develop indigenous capabilities, but in the long run that is likely to be a losing gambit. If Western 5G providers cannot offer competitive technology and prices to Huawei, sanctions will get the United States only so far in obstructing Chinese leadership in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this simple formula leaves many questions to be answered, it also suggests a specific research agenda to flesh out this concept of success. Dozens of research reports have already been published on important questions bearing on these issues, including: the most essential technology areas in which the United States must ensure global competitiveness; technologies in which China has the closest thing to an emerging predominant position, the risk posed by each, and the essential elements of a sufficient U.S. position in them; sectors more subject to natural monopolies or “moats” preventing others from gaining equivalent positions; and specific supply chain or material dependencies that threaten continued U.S. science and technology progress. Questions that remain without definitive answers include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most cost-effective investments and policies to promote the U.S. position in critical fields and thus sustain domestic dynamism (including a critical assessment of recent U.S. industrial policy support for key industries)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important parts of the supportive ecosystem for leading areas of scientific research and technological innovation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The most important mechanisms for the diffusion and application of innovations, including their weaknesses and areas where public or private action could strengthen them&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strategies for overturning Chinese leadership in key areas (such as solar power and 5G) where they have achieved temporary dominance, in part by developing leapfrog approaches that position the United States for leadership in successor technologies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the vision suggested here is indeed the route to success in the scientific and technological contest with China, then the United States may enjoy important advantages. Despite the large role of the private sector in China’s development and technology sector, the United States continues to have a far more open system, one more intrinsically oriented to generating grassroots experimentation and energy. Recent trends suggest real problems for China, with the growing emphasis on the sort of orthodoxy and control that are devastating to innovation. China is not and will never be the Soviet Union, but the U.S. system starts the race with intrinsic advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remains work to be done. The RAND analysis on the societal foundations of national competitiveness has suggested that the essence of the twenty-first-century competitive paradigm for great powers is effective governance of all kinds. And it has highlighted an urgent requirement for the United States: to transcend the social and institutional ossification, so characteristic of late-stage great powers, that has set in with many industrial-era institutions today. The modern analogy to the constraining orthodoxy, conservatism, and tradition that held back the laggards of the Industrial Revolution is red tape, bureaucratic inertia, path dependence, excessive hierarchy, and confining management techniques. Finding ways to free as much progress as possible from these straightjackets — even while protecting humanity from the risks of some key technologies — may well be the best route to competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept of a route to success in science and technology — one focused on spurring the United States’ domestic dynamism — can fit nicely into a larger vision of a successful endgame for the rivalry as a whole. Rivalries do eventually end. From the roster of historical possibilities, a peaceful endgame for the U.S.-China competition will have to involve mutual decisions — particularly one from China, as the dissatisfied power of the two — that both countries can better promote their long-term power and interests by transcending the zero-sum competition to some new form of relationship. Such an endgame is most likely to emerge through a combination of political shifts, changing perceptions of interests, and growing concerns about threats other than the rival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may take decades to reach that point. In the meantime, the United States, while competing and opposing Chinese goals and ambitions where necessary, can preserve the possibility for such a peaceful endgame by adopting strategies that deny Chinese hegemony, but do so in a way that is focused on U.S. strength rather than on trying to undermine China. A vision of success for science and technology built around U.S. domestic dynamism would achieve both of those goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-united-states-needs-a-broader-vision&quot;&gt;The United States Needs a Broader Vision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, Beijing has firmly adopted a statist, security-driven approach to economic governance, become more coercive in its region, and begun proactively undermining liberal norms abroad. These developments required Washington to revisit long-held expectations for China’s rise and move into a more competitive mindset. The United States is now transitioning from diagnosing to addressing risks posed by China. The Biden administration expanded the Trump administration’s tariffs, multiplied export controls on high-end technology, and sought to unwind supply chains out of China. China-related bills increased over sixfold from the 113th Congress (2013–15) to the 116th Congress (2019–21).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many experts argue that Washington will need a concrete set of goals for its China policy, as intense bilateral frictions will endure for decades to come. Instead, the Biden administration has sought to compete with China where needed to sustain and advance the United States’ preferred vision for the global order. This is a more durable and flexible approach, one more conducive to vital coalition building with U.S. partners in the years ahead — but it could use a stronger foundation. What is needed now is not a “vision of victory” for China policy but a bold and well-specified U.S. “vision of victory” for the global order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-visions-of-victory-for-china-policy-dont-cut-it&quot;&gt;Why Visions of Victory for China Policy Don’t Cut It&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escalating U.S.-China tensions have led practitioners and analysts from the United States and elsewhere to suggest that Washington needs a vision of victory for its China policy. Proposed visions range from outright regime change in Beijing at an extreme to sustained U.S. global dominance to policy-based goals seeking to blunt problematic Chinese behaviors until they change for reasons the United States cannot predict or foresee. Advocates of any one of these visions of victory suggest that clear objectives for China policy will improve the focus and effectiveness of U.S. actions by guiding tough questions around prioritization and trade-off management, improving bureaucratic alignment, and providing more sustained signaling to allies and partners about the direction of U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon closer examination, these arguments run into several problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, clarity on goals for U.S. policy toward China does not necessarily translate into more efficient and directed policymaking. Take the case of U.S. investment screening reform, for example. In 2016–17, a bipartisan set of lawmakers and both the Obama and Trump administrations expressed interest in more scrutiny of inbound Chinese investment. Despite consensus around U.S. goals (in this case, curbing openness to Chinese capital), various parts of the Trump administration, business community, and Congress came up with their own ideas of how to achieve them. Debates ranged from the jurisdictional (e.g., the locus of certain regulatory authorities) to the philosophical (e.g., the proper role of the state in commerce) to the practical (e.g., how to balance trade-offs, such as scalability versus nuance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clear goals for what the United States would like to see from China do not tell U.S. policymakers how to reconcile these tricky choices over priorities and trade-offs. This is clear from debates over outbound investment screening today. Proponents and opponents have a similar goal — to slow China’s military modernization — yet reach very different conclusions on whether such a mechanism will help us get there. Advocates argue that U.S. investments in China need to be screened and, in some cases, prohibited to prevent Americans from funding China’s technological and military ambitions. Opponents argue that such a mechanism is counterproductive: U.S. investments in China enable U.S. firms to keep tabs on innovations coming from the Chinese economy, an advantage the United States should not forfeit. Concrete goals toward China will not be a cure-all for tough decisions around prioritization and trade-off management in the policymaking process, as advocates suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second problem is that over-specified visions of victory for China policy lack flexibility, whether focused on China’s political system, power, or policies. There is no guarantee, for example, that regime change in China would result in a country neatly conforming to U.S. interests. Some analysts have pointed to the example of Communist Russia giving way to Vladimir Putin’s Russia to make this case. Likewise, a weaker Beijing could still threaten U.S. interests. Russia offers another example: its gross domestic product (GDP) is 10 percent of China’s and yet its actions have proven even more destabilizing and disruptive to international peace and prosperity in the past two years. Declaring “victory” after China democratized, or grew substantially weaker economically or militarily, would be short-sighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true for visions of victory for China policy that seek to blunt a set of Beijing’s practices, defined a priori. Say “victory” were a China that approaches military modernization more transparently, calls off its territorial pursuits, promotes domestic consumption, and curtails problematic practices such as intellectual property theft, cyber hacking, and an increasingly statist approach to economic governance. For one, it would be challenging to know whether these practices had stopped for good or might be resumed under a new leader or the same leader down the road. Putin’s Russia, for example, was causing far less trouble in 2012 than in 2022, and optimistic U.S. and European assumptions about its future trajectory 10 years ago led to problematic dependencies today. Moreover, new threats from Beijing could arise at any time, which might prove a better use of limited U.S. diplomatic attention and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, visions of victory for the United States’ China policy risk jeopardizing much-needed coordination with market democracies. U.S. power on the world stage is declining in relative terms. Still, the United States and its closest allies — including the G7 and key Indo-Pacific partners such as Australia and South Korea — boast nearly half of global GDP, over half of the world’s largest companies by market capitalization, and among the world’s most sophisticated militaries. Beyond this, unilateral U.S. measures only go so far in a world of long, globally diversified supply chains. Controls on advanced chips and chip equipment exports to China in late 2022, for example, only have a chance to slow China’s military technology trajectory because Japan and the Netherlands followed suit. Allied coordination will, therefore, be essential to push back against China’s coercive tendencies, deter its regional aggression, improve the effectiveness of U.S. technology and economic controls, and minimize the chances of loopholes and backfilling in technology protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This coordination is not guaranteed. Visions of victory for China policy will make it harder. The close allies mentioned above would distance themselves from a bid for political transformation in China, given their exposure to the Chinese economy and the amount of resistance such a goal would provoke in Beijing. Visions of victory directed at China’s policies would be less off-putting to allies, but even G7 economies remain uneasy about naming China explicitly in policies clearly designed to address China-related concerns. This suggests that unilaterally articulating a set of China-specific objectives will not necessarily make enlisting allied cooperation on everything from export controls to deterrence measures in the Indo-Pacific any easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;thinking-bigger&quot;&gt;Thinking Bigger&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration recognized these challenges in its 2022 National Security Strategy, committing to compete with China where needed — while aligning with partners and investing in domestic strength — to protect a “free, open, prosperous, and secure international order.” Many call this approach “managed competition,” defined as competing across a variety of domains to reinforce and defend the international order that the United States prefers while avoiding conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach has come under attack by Republicans and Democrats alike — the former publicly, the latter less so — for various reasons. Some argue that “managed competition” without an end goal for China makes U.S. competitive efforts unfocused. Others worry about room for interpretation of U.S. intentions among allies and partners in a way that undermines coalition building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These critiques have merit, as elaborated below. However, none are insurmountable under the current approach. Where “managed competition” has suffered is not in design, but execution. Strategic competition over the global order becomes difficult without a clear vision of victory for this order. In recent years, however, domestic consensus over the United States’ preferred global order, and its role in sustaining this order, has come under strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the Republican Party, various “tribes” compete for influence. These include “restrainers” that would prefer a more isolationist foreign policy in favor of a greater focus on domestic issues — which would mark a major departure for a globally engaged United States over the past decades; “prioritizers” that emphasize limitations on U.S. resources and support a full-scale reorientation of strategic resources to the Indo-Pacific; and “primacists” that assert the United States can and must remain globally engaged. Democrats under the Biden administration have declared ambitions to sustain the liberal political and economic order through broad international engagement, but even here, longstanding U.S. preferences for existing international rules and norms are clearly evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade policy is one example where U.S. practice is departing from the principles of free and open markets that Washington used to espouse (across party lines) as a global priority. The Biden administration eschewed traditional trade deals. The Trump administration levied tariffs on China and U.S. allies alike and promises to do so again in a potential second term. Both major political parties now embrace industrial policy. Economic efficiency, once the gold standard for Washington and internationalizing U.S. firms alike, now comes second to other imperatives (national security, manufacturing jobs at home) in a “new Washington consensus,” to cite a term referenced by U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This development reflects a broader reckoning over longstanding U.S. preferences for the rules and norms of interstate behavior. Understandably, perhaps, the world in 2024 looks different than it did during the United States’ “unipolar moment” of uncontested military, economic, and technology leadership in the 1990s. Global power is far more diffuse. China got rich in part by leveraging open markets in the West yet is now strengthening state-led economic governance at home. A revanchist Russia, regionally assertive China, and growing transnational challenges such as climate change and global pandemics have complicated the security landscape. A two-decade U.S. fight against transnational terrorism and “forever wars” in the Middle East have made Americans wary of sustained military commitments overseas and the sacrifices that come with global leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, an underspecified vision for the global order leaves “managed competition” with China underperforming. For one, combating Chinese behavior without consensus on broader U.S. goals risks wasting national resources on fights the United States does not need to have. China’s cooperation in certain domains may help achieve a world that benefits the United States. Should Washington care if China deepens cooperation with Africa in agriculture and public health?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reduced global hunger and disease promises benefits for the United States, including fewer demands on U.S. resources to address these issues, less global political instability and risk of conflict, richer societies that buy U.S. goods, and less migration pressuring U.S. borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, absent an articulation of U.S. goals for the international system, allies and partners will indeed draw their own conclusions about the motivations behind competitive U.S. measures toward China. To boost European support for reducing reliance on China for critical goods, for example, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen adopted the term “de-risking” to distinguish a European approach from what was familiarly seen in Brussels and key EU capitals as a broader “decoupling” by the United States. This deliberate distancing was a powerful reminder of the wariness in many EU capitals to fully align with a U.S. approach many see as overly aggressive and confrontational. Confusion around broader U.S. global objectives among key allies and partners leaves space for such wariness to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is needed now is not a China-specific vision of victory but a well-articulated, bipartisan vision of victory for the global order. It is time for policymakers on both sides of the aisle to have hard conversations about the set of principles the United States would like to govern the international system going forward. This may seem an insurmountable task given the political debates over foreign policy and U.S. international engagement described above. On the other hand, most U.S. policymakers could agree that a vision for the global order is actually needed, which is more than can be said for a vision of victory for China policy itself. And this broader vision should be centered on a set of principles for state behavior rather than the resourcing and specific policies that will be required to support such principles — which is where the controversy generally lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This vision for the global order need not be revolutionary. “Winning” should mean the international system is characterized by policy preferences that both the United States and its closest allies have spent billions of dollars to sustain and advance as a basis for post–Cold War global peace and prosperity. These preferences must be adapted to geopolitical and domestic realities, but should include peaceful resolution of disputes, territorial integrity, the primacy of individual rights in international law and standards, unimpeded freedom of navigation and commerce, and space for democracy to flourish. U.S. strategy toward China and every nation should flow from this broader set of goals: the United States should welcome China’s international contributions but commit to blunt China’s behavior (or ability to carry out such behavior) where it threatens such principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-stronger-foundation&quot;&gt;A Stronger Foundation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The substance of United States’ China policy today would not necessarily change much under a more disciplined definition of global priorities. Preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan that threatens an Asian democracy and risks destabilizing global confrontation, deterring China’s threats to freedom of navigation and trade in the Indo-Pacific, developing defensive mechanisms against Beijing’s coercive economic behavior, and fighting back against Beijing’s efforts to shape global rules and standards in illiberal ways would all be on the agenda. However, an approach of “managed competition” to shape the future international order is more flexible than a China-specific vision of victory. U.S. priorities toward China could evolve dynamically — based on a regular determination of where Beijing’s behavior runs counter to the United States’ preferred principles of the global order and, therefore, must be deterred or blunted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond its flexibility, this approach is conducive to coalition building. Support for a rules-based order — and a focus on threats that Beijing’s behavior poses in this light — have been central themes of the China strategies issued by the G7, many NATO countries, and key Indo-Pacific partners in recent years. This includes Berlin’s China strategy released in July 2023, the China policy paper of the Netherlands, the EU-China Strategic Outlook, and Tokyo’s National Security Strategy in 2022, among others. A principles-based approach to China strategy speaks to this common language, making it politically easier for these capitals to support U.S. competitive measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this approach is better suited to counter Beijing’s bid for influence in the so-called Global South, a set of low-income and emerging economies that will increasingly shape the future global order. China builds influence in many of these countries by pushing a narrative that the United States is seeking to preserve its global hegemony at all costs and is unilaterally responsible for geopolitical tensions squeezing the development space of these economies. These narratives may seem far-fetched in Western capitals, but they get more airtime and traction in the Global South than is in U.S. interests. As one example, Beijing’s packaging of efforts such as AUKUS, the Quad, and the U.S.-Japan alliance as a destabilizing “NATOization” of the Indo-Pacific has gone some way to deter Southeast Asian states from engaging with the United States on security issues. Anchoring China policy in a clear, affirmative set of principles for the global order — and then following these principles — will help combat such narratives, more so than an approach more explicitly focused on forcing policy or political changes from Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater consensus around U.S. goals for the international system going forward, across party lines, would help U.S. policymakers tackle both the “policy” and “political” dimensions of strategic competition with China in the decade ahead. This would provide a concrete and sustainable foundation for dynamic U.S. foreign policy prioritization as Beijing’s behavior evolves — and prove more useful in lubricating the joint action with allies and partners that will be necessary to resource U.S. goals in a more multipolar era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contextualizing-us-debates-on-china&quot;&gt;Contextualizing U.S. Debates on China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of World War II, U.S. debates about China policy have been both legendary and legion. They date back to the earliest days after the war, when scholars and policymakers asked big questions such as “who lost China?” As the Cold War raged, policymakers argued about how best to contain Mao Zedong’s China when it was acting as the “OG” of rogue states with its extensive support for Vietnam and “third world” revolutionary movements. By the 1970s and 1980s, rapprochement and normalization sparked a different conversation about the optimum means of building U.S.-China ties. Engagement had become all the rage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, U.S. debates about China changed, expanded, and intensified. Policymakers struggled to manage America’s competing interests when it came to China (e.g., economics versus human rights) as well as diverging assessments of China’s growing power. Conflict over Taiwan became a real possibility and a new axis of debate. China policy became even more politicized in Congress. In retrospect, the debates about China policy in this decade of great change became a Rorschach test of elites’ beliefs about global affairs, embodying the pacifying influence of international integration and economic interdependence, the stabilizing effect of nuclear weapons, and the ability to shape authoritarian regimes, among other issues. This may remain so today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, policy debates about China have come to focus, essentially, on two issues: (1) diagnosing the nature of the China challenge, and (2) prescribing strategies and policies to respond. The relative focus on diagnosis versus prescription has shifted as policymakers have responded to Chinese actions while navigating politics at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Debates about these two issues have taken a very different course in recent years, however. As China’s capabilities have grown and as Chinese leader Xi Jinping began to act assertively, discussions about the nature of the China challenge have converged, in broad terms. While some differences persist, most policymakers and analysts now perceive Chinese goals, capabilities, and behaviors as being directed at undermining both U.S. interests and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, debates about the most appropriate response to the China challenge remain robust, with experts and officials constantly discussing the right mix of competitive and cooperative strategies. Competitive approaches have received far more attention and support in recent years, with discussions now focusing on a range of policies aimed at constraining, containing, and degrading Chinese capabilities. Indeed, strategies of both external and internal balancing are back in vogue. Such balancing strategies are even becoming linked in novel ways, as policies to expand alliances and to modernize U.S. industrial capabilities are now reinforcing one another. Nonetheless, the perennial grand strategy question of how to best mix policies of engaging, binding, and balancing Chinese power persists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;understanding-the-new-era&quot;&gt;Understanding the New Era&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this brings us to the latest iteration of the United States’ China debates: end states versus steady states. In essence, the question is, does the United States need a specific end goal for its China policy, or can it be content with pursuing a steady state of persistent, albeit evolving, competition? This is a new and important evolution in the pantheon of China policy discussions. This question looks beyond the preoccupation with competition and cooperation by asking an even more fundamental question — an a priori question — about U.S. strategy. This question asserts that the United States needs to know the direction of strategy before discussing the right mix of tools to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering this question is a particularly complex matter because most answers come embedded within a series of assumptions about China policy and U.S.-China relations, both past and present. Thus, answering it must begin with a precise understanding both of the current state of bilateral relations and of the United States’ China policy. In that regard, the U.S.-China relationship is in a historically unique moment. While many policymakers and scholars tend to focus on the 40-year evolution of bilateral ties, doing so obscures the uniqueness of the current period. The U.S.-China relationship may be middle-aged, but it is experiencing a new youth — or perhaps a midlife crisis — and not a positive one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and China are in the early stages of the complex process of determining the scope and intensity of the competition. Washington and Beijing are still figuring out — both implicitly and explicitly — where and how they are going to compete: on what issues, in what regions, and using which mix of policy tools. (Notably, will nuclear weapons move to the forefront?) In this sense, the United States and China have only just begun to explore the arenas and boundaries of their competition. This moment bears some resemblance to the U.S.-Soviet competition in the late 1940s and 1950s. As in those decades, both sides are probing and testing one another in regions, in venues, and on various issues. Perceptions and policies are hardening on both sides, while the precise contours of the competition are still evolving and thus remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this process, both Washington and Beijing are trying to determine the precise national interests and, perhaps more importantly, the stakes for each other in this long-term competition. In practical terms this means that both sides are still exploring what risks they are willing to run and what costs they are willing to bear. The Cold War was both an intense ideological competition and a military confrontation, with Europe as the main theater and nuclear weapons at the center of it all. Economic and technological competition between the powers was secondary at most. The order and intensity of the drivers of U.S.-China competition will clearly be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Washington and Beijing, this process will take time and will be intensely political in both capitals. During the Cold War, actions and behaviors in key regions shaped this phase of the U.S.-Soviet competition; the same will be true for U.S.-China dynamics. Just as the first Berlin crisis in 1948 set the stage for the then-emerging U.S.-Soviet rivalry, U.S.-China jockeying over disputes in the South China Sea and Taiwan may have a similar consequence. As with the early days of the Cold War, there are few rules or norms to guide or even bound today’s competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;not-either----or&quot;&gt;Not Either . . . Or&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framing of current U.S.-China ties is critical to understanding the argument put forward here on the issue of end states versus steady states. In this bilateral context, the issue assumes a false distinction; there is, in fact, no need to make a binary choice. Both are needed, albeit in the right configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effective strategy toward China requires an end state, but it should be a general or broad one meant to guide policy choices. The end state should not be too specific or rigid because policymakers and strategists do not yet know the precise arenas, boundaries, or even rules of the competition. The end state needs to be able to evolve as the competition does. An end state with a general directionality and some elasticity provides this while also giving content and credibility to U.S. efforts at competition, including recruiting and retaining allies and partners. At the same time, a strategy that lacks any future orientation point risks meandering from crisis to crisis, misallocating resources, and being driven by domestic politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This varietal of end state should be an affirmative proposal focused on protecting and promoting U.S. interests (rather than opposing others). These interests should include the following: preventing the rise of a hegemon in Asia that could restrict U.S. freedom of action; preserving unfettered U.S. access to Asia (especially its markets); reinforcing the credibility of global rules and norms (on both economic and security issues); generating cooperation for transnational challenges such as climate change; and encouraging support for extra-regional security challenges, such as the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach offers several benefits. It is a positive vision focused on upholding interests and values which benefit multiple stakeholders beyond (and including) the United States. It offers broad international appeal because it puts the protection of nations’ sovereignty, strategic autonomy, and respect for national conditions at its center. It leverages U.S. strengths and experiences over the past 70 years in defending a rules-based order. It is flexible enough to adapt as U.S.-China competition evolves and does not preclude additional competitive options. It creates plenty of room for China to choose to be more constructive, without requiring it to change its domestic political regime. Finally, it provides allies and partners with much to support, even as tactical policy differences emerge about where and how to compete with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of current U.S. debates about end states, the approach offered here gains the advantages of the advocates and avoids the disadvantages of the detractors. It provides direction to policymaking as well metrics to measure success and failure. It offers the flexibility policymakers need to adapt to shifting Chinese behaviors, both positive and negative. The goals outlined above provide sufficient guidance on policy trade-offs, which would be hard even with a more specific end state. In sum, this approach — with its affirmative vision — not only guides competition management but also generates support for it, even amid its inherent vagaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach avoids trying to solve the China challenge in absolute terms, such as by advocating regime change (or another end state). It focuses on Chinese behavior rather than regime type, the latter of which could be problematic even under a change in Chinese leadership or a new governance model. Washington is more likely to be able to generate a domestic political consensus around these objectives than around more specific end states. None of the ideas outlined here will alienate partners and allies and, in fact, most will reassure them. Indeed, Washington might even gain a few fence-sitters with active and creative diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;broadening-the-steady-state&quot;&gt;Broadening the “Steady State”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the equation is how best to approach the “steady state” of managed competition. Current U.S. debates about the steady state often use the Biden strategy of “invest, align, and compete” as the baseline. This approach has both strengths and weaknesses. After the volatility of the Trump years, Biden rightly refocused U.S. strategy on domestic investments and alliance building to put the United States in a stronger position vis-à-vis China. However, Biden’s approach to a steady state remains somewhat under-conceptualized. It has some important components but is not comprehensive enough to meet the demands of long-term competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, the Biden approach mixes up apples and oranges and in doing so takes its eye off the bullseye of a long-term competition. “Investing” and “aligning” are both important means to balance Chinese power, and the Biden team excelled at expanding both in novel and creative ways. But both are competitive strategies — both are varieties of apples. The third part of the Biden trifecta (“compete”) is also an apple, and it is treated as a grab-bag category of policies meant to constrain and contain Chinese capabilities. Moreover, it begs many questions and would benefit from greater clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essential strategy question at the heart of a steady-state approach is broader than that implied by Biden’s policymaking. Namely, what is the optimum mix of engaging, binding, and balancing policies that can achieve a steady state of competitive coexistence that advances U.S. interests and values. To continue the analogy, a strategy for long-term competition needs several types of fruit, not just apples. All three types of policies — engaging, binding, and balancing — are needed to compete effectively, especially on complex issues such as Taiwan. The mix can be adjusted as the challenges posed by China evolve and as U.S.-China dynamics evolve with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dialogue and engagement get a bad rap, often dismissed as ineffective at best, and as appeasement at worst. U.S. policy has not been purely engagement with China since the 1980s. In fact, engagement is a broad category that encompasses multiple types of dialogue and negotiation. A recent positive example is National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan’s channel with Politburo member Wang Yi, which has been key to stabilizing relations in 2023 and 2024. Military communications, crisis management, and confidence-building measures are also types of engagement. These tools are critical to managing the scope and intensity of competition. In this sense, engagement policies enhance competition rather than undermine it. They improve deterrence and prevent competition from drifting into confrontation. In addition, such policies reassure U.S. allies and partners that Washington is not drawing them into an inevitable conflict, thereby making U.S. coalitions more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the scope of China’s global footprint and its substantial technological and military capabilities, a steady state of competition will require a broader support base in the world, especially among emerging powers and in the Global South. Such support can help bind China, including through means such as regional and multilateral commitments. In this sense, binding can function as a non-confrontational competitive strategy that focuses on creating a strategic environment in which China’s choices are delimited. The Biden team made headway with traditional Asian and European allies in expanding support for its China strategy, both binding and deterring Chinese actions. But the current era will require the United States to cast a wider net and use different tools, especially with the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to effectively compete with China without resorting to confrontation at every turn, Washington needs to expand its competition tool kit to offer more and different things to countries. The most obvious candidates are initiatives aimed at helping countries improve their own infrastructures: digital, health, transport, and energy. An effective steady state of competition requires the United States to offer a better value proposition to others, such as high-quality and resilient infrastructure. The United States’ ability to compete effectively rests on its ability to bring something to prospective partners and not just treat them as proxies in a great power contest. Ideally, these initiatives dovetail with U.S. domestic policies seeking to renew and expand U.S. industrial capabilities, including by creating new markets for exports. Finding and maximizing synergies between internal and external balancing creates both the political and the material foundations for long-term competition against a country as capable as China. Such synergies are perhaps the holy grail of steady state competition given their ability to broadly distribute the benefits of competitive policymaking, especially at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay offers one final point about crafting and maintaining a steady state of competition. For it to be politically sustainable in the United States (not just in Congress but within the business community) and to ensure access to the right kinds of resources, U.S. policymakers, over time, need to better articulate the boundaries of their competitive policies. On technology competition, U.S. officials often talk about pursuing a strategy of “small yard and high fences,” but they do not explain the principles that will inform these limitations. In recent years, both the yard and the fence have grown, and they will likely continue to do so. Enforcement has been uneven as well, undercutting effectiveness. Policymakers, business leaders, and foreign partners will be more willing to support costly policies needed for long-term competition — such as reduced exports to China — if they have greater understanding about the boundaries of U.S. policy actions and greater faith in their enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recommendation and the ones above are all designed to maximize the synergies generated by a China strategy that possesses both a well-articulated end state and a steady state. Such an approach provides sufficient clarity and direction for both policymakers and business leaders. It provides flexibility and an expanded tool kit to deal with the evolving challenge. Collectively, this approach unlocks domestic support, international assistance, and a broad base of resources (monetary, technological, and otherwise). All of this substantially improves the United States’ ability to compete with China, but in a way that can be sustained over time and that can adjust as the challenges posed by China morph and change, as they inevitably will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-the-united-kingdom-want-from-a-china-policy&quot;&gt;What Does the United Kingdom Want from a China Policy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 4, 2024, the United Kingdom elected a new Labour government with an immense parliamentary majority. A wealth of foreign policy issues faces that government, notably the Russia-Ukraine war, as well as the wider issue of the United Kingdom’s post-Brexit relationship with Europe. China does not loom large in public discussion, certainly compared to the moment four years ago when several issues put Beijing’s actions at the heart of British decisionmaking: among them, the role of Huawei in UK critical infrastructure, the imposition of the National Security Law on Hong Kong, and the question of blame over the origins of Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet there are plenty of signs that the United Kingdom will want to think about China in the medium term. One of the government’s first actions has been to mobilize a “China audit” examining the relevance and role of China in all aspects of UK foreign policy engagement, from defense to trade. There will likely be continuity with defense initiatives in Asia, such as AUKUS, and confirmation of trade-related plays, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a useful exercise to substitute the words “United Kingdom” for “United States” in answering the question: “Does the United Kingdom need a specific ‘vision of victory’ for its China policy?” In Washington, there have been lively debates around whether victory is possible or can even be defined for the United States. For the United Kingdom, the question makes much less sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working through an answer is worthwhile. The United Kingdom is still a country with global economic interests, particularly in services, considerable soft power, and a military and security role that makes it one of the most significant members of NATO. It may not be correct to think of the United Kingdom looking for “victory” over China (as it may similarly be incorrect for the United States). But knowing whether there is an endpoint, or at least a steady state, when it comes to the United Kingdom’s relationship with China says a great deal about how other powers involved in the U.S.-China binary, but with roles of their own, may see the 2020s and 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;brexit-britain-navigating-the-us-china-relationship&quot;&gt;Brexit Britain Navigating the U.S.-China Relationship&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas from government, business, and society in the United Kingdom regarding the country wants to end up with China is a function of the United Kingdom’s current need to redefine itself in a world where previous certainties (e.g., Atlanticism, Europeanism, free trade) are more fragile. The United Kingdom is a close ally of Washington, yet finds the relationship harder to navigate and make relevant than a decade ago; it is a European power with a security narrative in formation and a trade and cooperation narrative that has narrowed since Brexit; and it is a seeker of opportunities in a Global South, which it has yet to fully understand or engage with. Its interests relating to China have to be seen through that prism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that context, does the United Kingdom of 2024 have a vision of what the China endpoint looks like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short answer is not yet. The majority of UK policymaking over the past two decades has been to find maximal trade opportunities with China while remaining vocal on certain values issues (for instance, the National Security Law in Hong Kong) and steadily increasing concern about UK security interests. But these have mostly been reactions, not proactive choices: domestic politics in the United Kingdom has been too turbulent in recent years to allow for a firm assessment of China policy, and the additional unpredictability of both Chinese and U.S. politics has made it hard to navigate toward a steady outcome. The major reviews of UK policy, the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy (2021) and the Integrated Review Refresh (2023), both gave a broad definition of policy toward China, defining it as an “evolving and epoch-defining challenge . . . to the international order.” However, there is a strong sense that the direction of travel in the 2020s has been toward treating China primarily in security terms rather than as a major opportunity for growth, particularly as investment in China becomes less attractive because of domestic regulation and a faltering economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, one trend that will likely accelerate under the Keir Starmer government is coordination with the United States. It is extremely unlikely that the United Kingdom would support any version of China’s global role that sits at odds with the policy of the United States, regardless of whether the president is Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. In an earlier era, there were occasional small exceptions. In 2013, former UK chancellor of the exchequer (finance minister) George Osborne could bring the United Kingdom into the Asian International Infrastructure Bank against U.S. advice, but that was at a time of relatively calm geopolitics, with a friendly U.S. administration and the United Kingdom firmly embedded in the European Union. A United Kingdom that is much less certain of its geopolitical links will not take a risk on links with China, particularly if those links risk the relationship with the United States on security. This does not mean matching on every element in the Indo-Pacific: while AUKUS involves deepening formal links with the United States, membership of CPTPP involves a relationship with an organization that the Trump administration left and the Biden administration has shown no signs of wishing to rejoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event that the United States sought “victory” over China in some form definable to a wider global audience, why would the United States be concerned about UK support? The United States would not be concerned for reasons of material support. The United Kingdom’s assets in the region are simply too limited to make a decisive contribution; Japan and South Korea are clearly the key allies. However, the symbolic importance of the United Kingdom is not negligible when it comes to a “vision of victory.” After all, this was the reason that Lyndon Johnson pressed Harold Wilson to support the United States in Vietnam (unsuccessfully), and George W. Bush looked for Tony Blair’s support (successfully) over Iraq. London would almost certainly provide support of some sort for U.S. policy on China and might be a surer bet for that support than other major European capitals, but the form of that support might remain undefined until a moment of crisis — for instance, a call for sanctions that might be more damaging to the United Kingdom’s smaller and highly open economy than to the United States. Any such UK action, of course, would have consequences and likely result in China categorizing the United Kingdom as a clear adversary by definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;britain-as-a-european-actor-on-china&quot;&gt;Britain as a European Actor on China?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One factor that will shape the United Kingdom’s trajectory on China policy is the country’s rapidly changing role in the European defense environment. This was already underway under the Sunak government, where bilateral relations with Paris and Berlin had greatly improved, and there was warm talk about greater security cooperation with Europe. However, a government that was a continuation of the one that had engineered Brexit would still have had trouble creating a warm atmosphere with a collective Europe, even defined in terms that went beyond the European Union. A Labour government without an anti-EU political strand will find it easier to engage with European actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared even to five years ago, there are thin but growing structures that allow the UK-Europe partnership on security to develop, in particular the European Political Community (EPC), formulated by French president Emmanuel Macron in 2022 as a means to include actors who were not EU members, and which has developed a strong orientation toward security issues. The institution will also morph over time depending on what foreign policy agenda is promoted by the U.S. administration in power from 2025, but the Starmer government will have a strong interest in making sure it has as central a role as possible in the EPC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China will not be the first or most urgent issue on a security agenda with Europe: Russia sits at the top of the list, where the question of “victory” is more clearly defined by Europeans, even if it is increasingly harder to obtain. However, there are signs that, in a range of ways, the United Kingdom is already indicating interest in China as a wider security issue and will share that agenda with Europe as a whole. The United Kingdom may choose to press harder on China’s support for Russia on dual-use technologies that have the effect of helping Russia’s war effort and is likely to follow the United States’ lead (or demands) on the restriction of Chinese access to sensitive technology and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom will continue to support the status quo around Taiwan and the South China Sea in terms of freedom of navigation. The term “status quo” might seem odd in the context of the United Kingdom’s involvement in AUKUS, which extends the United Kingdom’s presence in the region over time, but in light of Chinese pressure on regional maritime claims, the argument would be that the United Kingdom is contributing to maintaining the balance that is being altered by Chinese claims. Yet a harder question would be: Would the United Kingdom consider a change in Taiwan’s status, brought about by coercion, to be an issue of fundamental concern? And would either NATO or the EPC, in both of which the United Kingdom would be a key voice, be the right forum to debate that viewpoint if European actors took a different view?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;endpoint-rather-than-victory&quot;&gt;Endpoint Rather than Victory?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ideal endpoint from the United Kingdom’s point of view will be a settlement in which versions of the current status quo remain the case. There is no great desire to expend political capital to obtain an ideological outcome in China that is different from the current one — in other words, there is no current British equivalent with the standing of Margaret Thatcher as an advocate of a Cold War–style victory (on the left or right). If a U.S. administration were to adopt a “vision of victory” that demanded an ideological outcome, there might be some symbolic sense of adhering to that vision of the world, but it would be something the United Kingdom would choose to do on a minimal basis for the most part. Europe will simply loom larger, and even an expanded European defense ecology with a strong UK presence would necessarily be focused on Russia and not China. A desirable UK outcome would also need to consider the practical need to keep the country’s core interests secure and viable. Therefore, any economic and infrastructural settlement would need to provide significant protection from cyberwar, as the prospect of direct UK involvement in regional Asian kinetic conflict is low, but the likelihood of the UK economy, which is heavily tied to international services, being vulnerable to cyberattacks is high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the United Kingdom also has other key aims where China is deeply relevant that do not sit simply in the security and defense space. The current Labour government, not wholly at odds with its Conservative predecessor, wants to see a global endpoint that involves a net-zero energy transition. For that to happen, there needs to be a realistic assessment of how far that will be possible without dealing with Chinese technology. More broadly, the United Kingdom’s net-zero aims as a global influencer will need to take into account whether to support Global South countries in using one of the few global public goods that China produces: solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is aside from the areas where the United Kingdom has trade interests and can no longer rely on the European Union as a powerful trade shield. If both France and Germany end up with policies that seek to accommodate China (and Russia), particularly if there is a more transactional administration in the United States, then the three Ls — luxury automobiles and goods, legal and financial services, and life sciences — in the United Kingdom’s heavily service-dependent economy will need space to flourish, too, and cutting Chinese markets out of any growth model will be hard. The United Kingdom has various core interests, but one is being part of a global trading network at a time when free trade is not in fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question, of course, is whether such a UK-friendly status quo is attainable. If there were to be a fundamental shift in geopolitics — a conflict over Taiwan or the South China Sea — then the United Kingdom would certainly become tied to the United States’ vision of the outcome. But without that shift, that gray steady state on China is probably the closest “vision of victory” that the United Kingdom is likely to be able to manage or afford in the world as it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-comfort-of-ambiguity-europe-and-the-future-of-the-us-approach-to-china&quot;&gt;The Comfort of Ambiguity: Europe and the Future of the U.S. Approach to China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europeans should be careful offering strategic advice on China policy to others generally, and maybe Germans in particular. Europe is desperately trying to support Ukraine after Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion. Failure to spend adequately on defense has left the continent ill-prepared for a contingency that was not only likely but certainly foreseeable. What the war has since made abundantly clear is that Europe does not only have a Russia problem, it also has a China problem. By providing strategic, diplomatic, economic, and military support to Moscow, Beijing has become part of the European security equation and now poses a more palpable risk than Chinese economic coercion, cyberattacks, or market distorting practices — even if all simultaneously present — ever could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategic China-Russia axis is even worse for European security and economic interests than it is for the United States. Europe is economically, strategically, and geographically more exposed. China’s increasing dominance in sectors crucial to Europe’s industrial and economic future are challenging Europe’s future prosperity and political stability. Europe, particularly Germany, has benefitted for decades from the close integration and complementarity of its own economy with that of China. However, a “China shock,” possibly worse than what the United States went through — that is, a massive wave of deindustrialization and loss of competitiveness in crucial sectors — is now on the horizon. The outlook is grim. While a lot has changed in the rhetoric in Paris, Berlin, and Warsaw since the Trump administration first increased the pressure on Europeans to face up to their China-sized Achilles heel, real action has still mostly been emanating from Brussels. In member states, illusions about a “third way,” a magic “middle ground,” or even the delusional idea of Europe playing a “mediating role” between the United States and China continue to make up a surprisingly potent part of the policy conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this, does it make the life of the European policymaker easier if the United States were to spell out its “vision of victory” for its China policy more clearly? Absolutely not. Ambiguity gives Europeans the ability to wiggle their way around the tough policy choices that a clearly defined vision of victory would entail, all while pretending to be either “on the way to being more closely aligned” or “basically almost fully autonomous” in their decisionmaking, depending on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November. Ambiguity leaves room for interpretation and appropriation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union and its member states have a self-interest in responding to Beijing’s support of Moscow, China’s assertive posture in the Indo-Pacific region, and China’s market-distorting practices with overcapacities in key industries that are threatening to destroy the very sectors that have thus far provided for European prosperity. Without the stabilizing effect of economic prosperity, Europe lacks not only the financial but also the political basis for its ability to invest in military defense. This has been particularly evident in light of the Russian aggression in Ukraine, Europe’s transition to a decarbonized economy in order to continue to lead on climate action, and the research, development, and education needed to form the basis of future wealth and progress. While the United States, under the last two administrations, has made significant efforts to counter or shield itself from the economic practices promoted by China’s leadership under Xi Jinping and has heavily invested in preparing the U.S. armed forces for a potential conflict with China, Europe has been slower to act, as the political costs of taking similar measures appear overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European policymakers like to point out that while U.S. and European interests vis-à-vis China overlap to a large extent, they are not identical, and they are thus keen on carving out a path that is at least domestically seen as genuinely European and actively distinct from the United States’ path. This is particularly the case in Germany and France, where transatlantic skepticism is a relevant factor. For domestic political reasons, actions taken should thus by no means be seen as either a response to U.S. pressure (because who wants to be seen as being a poodle) or as a form of “ganging up” against China (because who wants to be seen as being a bully).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being seen as aligned with the Trump administration’s alleged endgame of “full decoupling” has been used as a strawman for inaction by European policymakers in the past. By using the phrase “de-risk, not decouple,” policymakers suggest that Europeans have a more balanced and less aggressive approach to China, without having to explicitly state it. This framing implies that certain segments of the U.S. policy elite are more focused on achieving outright victory — favoring defeat over coexistence and dominance over balance — which could ultimately be futile or even exacerbate global conflicts, from kinetic wars to intensified disputes over climate action. When the Biden administration started to use the “de-risking” framing as well, it made it harder to keep this line of argument alive. Close transatlantic alignment on responding to Beijing remains highly contested. Europe wants its distinct strategy. And while it is clear that this would entail a serious new approach to economic policy, new investment, and a radical repositioning vis-à-vis Beijing, so far the political will needed to pursue this approach is missing. “Not like the United States” then becomes a comfortable fallback option, but that is much easier stated if the U.S. approach remains ambiguous in its end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what could happen if the next U.S. administration were to specify its vision of victory?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume the next U.S. administration was to say: “The United States has to continue to be the dominant military, technological, economic, and security player in the Indo-Pacific region. It has to maintain the ability to push back against Chinese pressure wherever it challenges this core interest or the interests of U.S. allies, and the United States will use all available means — from economic and trade tools to the use of military force — to defend its role of global superiority, which would include: the defense of Taiwan out of pure U.S. self-interest; the destruction of Chinese high-tech ambitions through export controls, where possible, and sabotage or coercion, where needed; and the use of all possible means to force allies to follow suit.” This would mean a United States seeking to win systemic competition, striving to maintain and restore superiority through demonstrating the failure of the Chinese system, and embracing the possibility of at least massive weakening of China, but even a political collapse or regime change — or in a nutshell, a different China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The knee-jerk reaction of European policymakers would be to seek distance. Rather than winning systemic rivalry with all possible means, they would argue, the twenty-first century should be about proving the capacity of democracies to deliver a green and digital transformation and to guarantee security and stability. They would underscore that Europe certainly does not seek regime change and does not have a problem with losing superiority in global politics and trade because it does not have it in the first place. This would, however, imply that: (a) the Chinese leadership has no ambition to win systemic rivalry and does not see the current situation as such (which unfortunately it has clearly said it does), and (b) that it would not matter to European policymaking whether the United States or China leads in military, technological, or economic terms, that Europeans could basically accommodate either in this role. This is a crucial but often only implied point. For some Europeans, the prospect of a Trump-led United States makes the difference between global leadership of the United States or China a more optional question. And for some, the focus on renewed fossil fuel extraction becomes scarier than the idea of an authoritarian, surveillance-prone, aggressive, green-tech superpower that dominates the industrial supply chains of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those interested in European territorial integrity and the survival of democracy, market economy, freedom, or privacy, this is a questionable proposition. But the clarity in approach on the U.S. side would necessitate policymakers in Europe to make the case for why they believe that it would be in Europe’s broader strategic interests to push back hard against U.S. policies that are trying to undermine Chinese dominance in key industries, strategic theatres, and emerging technologies. And they would have to do so under conditions of extreme economic pressure, as many leading companies in Europe have used the incentives of the Inflation Reduction Act and other Biden administration policies to invest more deeply into a U.S. footprint in production, supply chains, and shifting market shares. The economic cost of pushing back against the United States would have to be factored into, and would ultimately challenge, the political equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume on the other hand that the next U.S. administration decides that it has a much more limited endgame for its China policy — one that really ignores Europe for the most part. It could say: “Only the direct contest matters. The United States would happily concede global leadership to China as long as Beijing never has the ability to coerce or attack the United States. The United States will become more self-sufficient; it will continue to be an attractive market and a place for international investment and talent, but it will focus on domestic consumption and production, relative military strength, and a highly flexible interpretation of where intervention is deemed necessary.” This would represent a more inward-focused and self-centered approach, where allies and partners play only a marginal role, if any at all. In this scenario, Europe is left to manage its own security, and every nation is expected to fend for itself, with Washington operating under the assumption that the United States would maintain a relatively stronger position for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European policymakers would likely find this option equally problematic. As soon as a U.S. administration clearly spelled out a game plan for an isolationist, self-centered rivalry that is national rather than systemic, Europeans would have to relate to it without the comforting ambiguity of the current approach, where they can alternate between condemning the United States for overly confrontational policies and benefitting from actions taken that are in the European interest in the first place, all without having to pay a political price. Such a U.S.-centered endgame would force Europeans to make tough policy choices, accrue greater debt, and invest more in industrial capacity and consumption at home. It could also lead to some allies making different choices, exerting enormous pressure on EU structures, and making it even harder to come to collective action. Smaller countries, less dependent on the United States, might seek the opportunity in a changing global order to be on the “right side” of the new global leader and see a benefit in closer alignment with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the United States could define its “vision for victory” with regard to China — or choose not to — and it would have no effect on Europeans doing whatever they possibly can to improve their own position under the current geopolitical circumstances: more scrutiny for Chinese production and investment in Europe; greater focus on strengthening competitiveness in areas exposed to de-industrialization so that it is adequate to the scale of the problem and the speed with which it is coming at Europe; creating improved structures to deal with economic coercion and critical dependencies; and galvanizing the political will to dare greater European integration, make the tough political choices to strengthen European defense, and invest collectively in the green and digital transformations to ensure technological leadership and future prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be a European reality where the lack of unity around these goals would no longer be optional, but imperative — and in which Europe could make actual choices. As this dynamic was not unleashed by the existential threat of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine and Beijing’s strategically enabling role, it seems hard to fathom what kind of shock would be needed to get to this point. On China policy, even a second Trump administration might not be enough — precisely because, even among his supporters, there is no clear agreement about the actual vision for victory. Neither is an alignment within the Democratic Party around one precise vision for victory very likely. Ironically, it could be this ambiguity on the strategic aim that will throw European governments a lifeline so that they may maintain incessant complacency and as a form of collateral damage make it even harder for both sides of the Atlantic to actually deal with the challenges posed by Xi Jinping’s China, collectively and individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concrete-goals-and-strategic-bargaining-with-china&quot;&gt;Concrete Goals and Strategic Bargaining with China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government needs to specify concrete goals for its China policy to incentivize Beijing to act more responsibly as it pursues its ambitions. Americans have no choice but to coexist with China under Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the United States needs a strategy to influence China’s decision calculus so that it acts constructively, or at least in ways that are less harmful to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effective strategy requires that the United States identify the Chinese behaviors that it wants to change and that the CCP leadership might be amenable to change under the right circumstances; communicate these specific demands to the Chinese leadership; and use a mixture of negotiations, pressure, and reassurance to motivate the leadership to adjust its behavior. Underlying this practical approach, the United States should make clear that the way it treats China depends entirely on China’s own conduct, not on U.S. ideological preconceptions or domestic politics. The overall objective of the United States’ strategy should be to motivate China to moderate its policies and improve its conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;primacy-and-strategic-competition&quot;&gt;Primacy and Strategic Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative conceptions that have dominated U.S. China policy over the past decade — U.S. primacy and strategic competition — have not been at all effective at persuading Beijing to act like a responsible power. From China’s perspective, these are simply synonyms for Cold War–style containment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widespread notion that the United States should claim global primacy in every domain — holding on to the top slot in the global pecking order — may sound appealing to American ears, but it has not gotten the United States anywhere with China. The idea of complete primacy is an outdated holdover from the exceptional period of U.S. unipolarity in the immediate wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse, at a time when China was still an extremely poor country. Primacy now smacks of a playground fight, not a principled aspiration for peace and order. No country, however capable, can expect to be the best at everything. For example, nothing can stop the rest of the world from buying Chinese solar panels and electric vehicles that offer superior value, even if the Chinese government subsidized the takeoff of the green tech sectors. Defining the bilateral relationship as a universal zero-sum contest also alienates the United States’ partners, who do not want to have to choose between China and the United States. This framework also discourages Beijing from making the compromises necessary to preserve a constructive relationship with the United States and its neighbors. Why should Beijing calm relations with other claimants in the South China Sea or resume dialogue with the Democratic Progressive Party government in Taiwan if it cannot expect to gain any appreciation from the United States or its neighbors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the next level of goal setting, the U.S. framework of “strategic competition” or “managed competition” is overly vague. Without a clearer conception of success, there is no way for the American public, Beijing, or allies and partners to assess how well the United States is doing. Moreover, the competition framing creates global uncertainty by setting no limits on how extreme U.S. actions such as tariffs or other sanctions might become and offers no reason for Beijing to cooperate with the United States by restraining itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most important, neither “primacy” nor “competition” has effectively motivated Beijing to moderate its behavior. These approaches simply have not worked. China’s behavior today is just as harmful, or even more harmful, to the United States, its neighbors, other countries, and China’s own citizens as it was a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s intimidation of Xinjiang, Hong Kong, India, Australia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Lithuania, among others and its support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine have hardened U.S. perceptions of the Chinese threat. Although China has not invaded another country as Russia has, the Trump and Biden administrations have treated China as the greatest threat to the United States’ security, economy, and values. Washington’s accusations of genocide against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, nervous talk about an imminent war on Taiwan, and economic and financial sanctions, some of which are unprecedented except in wartime, have mobilized Americans to ready their defenses against the China threat, but they have failed to provide any incentives for Beijing to ameliorate its policies. Instead, Beijing is currently expanding its nuclear deterrent and pursuing technological and economic self-reliance in its own preparations for a possible war with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the dangers of this downward spiral toward military confrontation, shouldn’t the United States revise its approach to China by testing the potential for intensified diplomacy that uses carrots and sticks in a targeted strategic manner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;possibilities-for-negotiated-agreements-today-or-tomorrow&quot;&gt;Possibilities for Negotiated Agreements, Today or Tomorrow&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Beijing is unlikely to make fundamental changes in its system or modify its approach to Xinjiang or Hong Kong, there are other important areas where compromise may be possible if Washington presents realistic demands and offers. Chinese leader Xi Jinping still appears motivated by a desire for international respect. There are also issues where pragmatic adjustments might help Xi shore up his lagging domestic support during this period of economic and fiscal distress. China is dealing with an economic slowdown, an aging population, high youth unemployment, and a middle class whose real estate assets are losing value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my own interviews, I believe that many among the Chinese elite are disenchanted with Xi’s overconcentration of power and his policy missteps. Some might dare to encourage Xi to respond positively to the United States’ diplomatic offers if they seem beneficial to their country. Moreover, China’s domestic dynamics are unpredictable, and Xi will not be in charge forever. Making reasonable offers now will increase domestic pressure on Xi to reach agreements with the United States and encourage his successors to negotiate if Xi does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own experience in government as the deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for China (1997–2000) was more than 20 years ago, during what might, in retrospect, be considered a golden age of U.S.-China engagement. During that period, arms control negotiations by professionals such as Bob Einhorn, backed up by the threat of sanctions, helped convince China to stop proliferating nuclear and missile technology. And trade negotiations by professionals such as Charlene Barshefsky, combined with the inducement of Permanent Normal Trade Relations and increased foreign direct investment, convinced China to open its markets to meet the requirements for membership in the World Trade Organization. China’s legal system and access to information through commercial media and the internet improved largely due to domestic initiatives reinforced by a welcoming attitude from the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, China has changed significantly since that time, as I discuss in my book, Overreach: How China Derailed its Peaceful Rise. Nowadays, a cloud of pessimism lies over Washington’s policymaking toward China. The American policy elite has concluded that the United States and China are destined to be hostile adversaries and that nothing the U.S. can do will change that. Xi’s overweening nationalist ambitions and his dictatorial rule reinforce gloomy expectations of China’s behavior in the future. Many politicians and experts have abandoned hope for leveraging Xi’s choices through negotiations even now that the United States has restored its position of strength and dispelled misperceptions that it is a declining power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is too soon to give up on diplomacy, however. China’s post-Mao political history contains surprising twists and turns driven by domestic and international factors, which should lead observers to reject deterministic predictions about future Chinese behavior. In fact, such factors — including human agency, especially the decisions of individual leaders; the swing from collective leadership to centralized dictatorship; shocks such as the 2007–08 global financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic; and incidents such as NATO’s 1999 accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade — have produced unexpected shifts in Chinese behavior. China’s future is likely to be equally unpredictable and could open avenues for well-crafted diplomatic efforts as well as create new dangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the uncertainty about China’s future is the fact that, as of 2024, Xi’s power looks to be past its peak. Since 2019–20, the strongman leader has confronted daunting economic and political realities at home, many of them related to his mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic and his fetish for social control over economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s lockdown of Shanghai and other cities and then the sudden reversal of his zero-Covid policy in reaction to widespread protests left the population collectively traumatized. In the absence of government assistance to households struggling with layoffs during the pandemic, consumption has plummeted, and deflation and unemployment have taken hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign investment has also cratered, as even the most bullish investors have grown skittish about the risks of betting on Xi’s China, which nowadays looks more like a police state than a developmental state. When, in 2024, foreign investors withdrew more money than they put into Chinese equities markets for the first time in a decade, Beijing’s first response was to stop publishing net investment flow data, a suppression of economic information that is bound to further erode confidence. Data secrecy, erratic interventions in financial markets, and crackdowns on the private sector have so alarmed Chinese entrepreneurs that many of them have exited China to seek opportunities elsewhere. This would be a logical time for the U.S. government to press Xi to expand market access and legal protections for foreign businesspeople instead of restricting financial flows to China in the name of national security; anything to restore investors’ confidence should be a high priority for Xi. Reviving proposals for a bilateral investment treaty or an agreement that combines China’s “voluntary” export controls with a U.S. policy to allow Chinese foreign direct investment in certain sectors in the United States with appropriate security protections, as the United States did with Japan in the 1980s, might also be beneficial to both economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Chinese believe that Xi’s mishandling of foreign policy has left China in a weakened position. Xi’s support of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine is controversial within China and has estranged Europe and the United States. This self-defeating policy has reinforced the backlash from advanced democracies, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia, against China’s provocative military pressure on its neighbors and Taiwan. Moreover, Xi has no way of knowing how capable his military is because he has jailed the key generals he selected to lead the modernization of the strategic missile program, who turned out to be corrupt and deceiving him about the performance of the new equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese elites and the public alike have lost confidence in the competence of Xi’s leadership. As an aging strongman heading toward a fourth term with no successor in place, Xi must also be anxious about possible challenges from other CCP leaders. The United States’ own strategy should be more cognizant of Xi’s domestic dilemmas without explicitly pursuing regime change. The United States’ audience is mainly Xi, but it should extend to other elites who might persuade him to shift gears or eventually to transfer power to a successor. Showing a reasonable face to the elites who will govern China in the future makes good sense. This is the context in which the next U.S. administration should pursue a practical strategy to motivate changes in Chinese behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-bargaining-with-beijing&quot;&gt;Strategic Bargaining with Beijing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether Xi’s regime is influenceable. However, the United States needs to test the possibility of mutually beneficial compromises by clearly communicating to Beijing the specific actions it wants it to take and then negotiating with China through the strategic use of pressure and inducements linked to these actions. More intensive communication with Beijing will enable Washington to reinforce the message that good relations with the United States are contingent on China’s own actions. The United States will retaliate in various ways when China pushes other countries around, but on the other hand, if China can restrain itself and get along well with others, the United States should be willing to retract sanctions and extend a friendly hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effective strategy is not only linked to specific goals but also melds reassurance with threats. The more explicit the United States can be about the actions Chinese decisionmakers could take to improve relations, the more likely it is to motivate them to act on them. And if this strategic approach fails to moderate Chinese actions, the United States will have learned something important about what it will take to be more effective in the future. Some might argue that the United States already ran this experiment in the 1990s and failed. Others might argue that it succeeded but only because China was still weak. But in my view, the United States abandoned it too soon and needs to test it again, especially now that Xi has damaged China’s national interests and his own standing by overreaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A negative example is the Biden administration’s recent campaign against Chinese “overcapacity,” which is flooding the world with cheap exports that exceed domestic demand and harm producers in the United States and other countries. When U.S. officials complain about this unfair phenomenon, they frame it as a feature of the heavy hand of the state in the Chinese economic system instead of targeting a specific set of government subsidies such as the export tax rebates that could be eliminated to mitigate the problem. How is Beijing supposed to get back into Washington’s good graces without specific asks to guide its responses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor has the Biden administration’s approach to managing technological competition with China been linked to specific Chinese actions that are objectionable to the United States. Instead, Washington erects barriers to Chinese technological advances because some of them leak from civilian into military capabilities, broadly speaking. Because putting successful Chinese companies such as Huawei on the entity list and banning U.S. outbound investment to China are costly to the United States as well as China, these sanctions are viewed by China as credible signals of a hostile containment policy. The U.S. mode of technological decoupling appears to have no limits. It keeps bleeding into new sectors and has not been connected to specific Chinese malfeasance; rather than motivating Beijing to act more considerately, it has only served to heighten its determination to achieve technological self-reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan’s public statement that the goal of U.S. technology policies is to keep “as large a lead as possible” to ensure that “technology that could tilt the military balance . . . is not used against us” sent the wrong message. Instead, he should have identified the specific ways that these advanced military technologies have been used to coerce Japan, Taiwan, or other neighbors and linked them to U.S. restrictions on semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies. The message should be that openness with trade and investment partners depends on their eschewing the use of force against other countries. Sullivan could have argued that were China to ease off its military intimidation of Asian neighbors, the United States would be prepared to reduce its technology restrictions against Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if China were to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross or another respected organization to inspect Xinjiang and certify that the reeducation camps have been closed and that recruitment of workers is entirely voluntary instead of “forced labor,” the United States should also be prepared to end its economic sanctions against Xinjiang and permit imports of cotton, silicone, and other products from the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Biden administration has been much more targeted in its efforts to prevent Xi from assisting Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine. Before Putin invaded, President Joe Biden directly warned Xi that if he provided military aid to the Russian invasion, the United States would impose severe sanctions on China. From the standpoint of Europe and the United States, preserving the sovereignty of Ukraine and other countries that border Russia is what the Chinese would call a “core interest.” This leader-to-leader communication was effective in dissuading China from giving lethal military support to abet Russia’s aggression, which would have been unpopular inside China as well as financially costly. Subsequently, when Xi started helping Russia revive its military-industrial complex to meet its wartime needs, including by producing military equipment (a form of gray zone military assistance), the Biden administration’s clear and forceful diplomacy failed to persuade Xi not to support Putin. This discouraging outcome indicates that to overcome Xi’s affinity for Putin, the United States and Europe will have to ramp up both threats and promises to the Chinese leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negotiating with China based on clear and targeted goals in a respectful manner that connotes goodwill toward the Chinese people may not always succeed. However, it will provide a foundation for a more stable relationship in the future and tell the United States whether it needs to move into an even harder defensive crouch. Only if a series of strategically designed diplomatic interactions attempted over an extended period of time fail to moderate Chinese conduct should Americans conclude that the only option is to pull the grim trigger to deny and degrade China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like to win. And why shouldn’t they? It satisfies the id, the ego, and the superego all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those most in thrall of winning tend also to be those most certain that victory is within reach. They are confident pitfalls can be anticipated, traps avoided, and obstacles overcome. They urge on the hesitant with motivational affirmations and quiet the questioners with oblique insults to their valor. They emphasize the righteousness of their cause, the perfidy of the competitor, and use both to rouse and to galvanize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In times of war, the call to victory is indispensable because it works on the mind the way a fictional leader of men described the recommending attributes of rum: it incites violence and liberates from self-doubt. At most other times in international politics the call to victory is dangerous, for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is not at war with China. China is not at war with the United States. Neither state’s survival or prosperity is furthered by the other’s destruction, physically or ideologically. To the extent that there is symmetry with the Cold War — the memory of which has softened since its death and become remarkably forgiving of its menacing character and many excesses — it lies in both sides’ conviction about the superiority of its own model of domestic politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, nonetheless, those who wish for the United States to pursue victory over China — who seek not to manage competition indefinitely but rather to produce an end state in which the United States has “won.” It is not wrong to agitate for a clear articulation of what the United States seeks to achieve in the world and an explanation of how it plans to do so. There is, indeed, a pressing need for a U.S. strategic vision that is more than getting through today to get to tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victory over China is not that vision. The purpose of U.S. foreign policy is not to vanquish the United States’ competitors. It is to create conditions that allow Americans to live, in Franklin D. Roosevelt’s enduring phrase, in freedom from want and in freedom from fear. Seeking to defeat China would do neither — it would only make Americans economically worse off and the world less safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-victory-that-would-utterly-undo-us&quot;&gt;A Victory that Would Utterly Undo Us&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. defeat of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) can come about in one of two ways: as the outcome of a kinetic war that produces surrender, or through internal dissolution that either cascades from the leadership down or surges from the citizenry up. For the moment, no one openly advocates for victory by violence, though there are some whose views on the U.S. role in the cross-strait dispute over Taiwan’s international political status reveal that war is not their least-preferred option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War — begun over Taiwan or as the result of another dispute — would do more harm than good to U.S. interests. This is true even if the war were to remain conventional — and there is no reason supported either by history or by theory to presume that the likelihood that it would not escalate to nuclear exchange is any greater than the likelihood that it would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the United States were to win a conventional war with China — an outcome that is far from certain — the net effect would still be profoundly negative. Such a confrontation would very likely include cyberattacks on domestic U.S. digital assets and critical infrastructure. It would destroy U.S. military platforms, take the lives of U.S. servicemembers, kill civilians, and cause an enormous amount of damage in Taiwan, throughout East Asia, and possibly within the broader Indo-Pacific. It would have unknown effects on U.S. regional alliances, drop the bottom out of the global economy for an imponderable period of time, and turn China’s domestic political situation into a giant, seething question mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outlook for victory by internal political dissolution is not much better. Those drawn to this idea seem to believe that government collapse is more likely to occur without immediate or sizable intra-or interstate violence than with it, though there is no analytical method through which to arrive at a defensible conclusion about which of these outcomes is more probable. China’s history of such transitions, however, might offer some instructive insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is similarly difficult to take solace in the optimists’ view that China’s domestic politics ultimately would resolve into “the end state desired by a growing number of Chinese: a China that is able to chart its own course free from communist dictatorship.” This is a possibility. It also is a possibility that this prediction is based on an overly rosy view of the aspirations and commitments of the average Chinese citizen — of which there are almost 1.4 billion — and that the result would be something far less desirable. There is, again, no social-scientific method to assess the relative probabilities of the many possible outcomes such a political undoing might produce. Russia’s history, as well as that of other post-Soviet states, however, might offer some instructive insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic effects of an unraveling of CCP control, whether violent or not, would doubtless constitute an enormous shock to China’s economy. There is no way to predict the contours and duration of this disruption, but it is implausible to think that the derailing of normal economic activity inside China would not ripple outward to shock economic activity elsewhere. And there is no objective measure to suggest that a dramatic reduction in the extent or quality of China’s participation in global commerce and finance would do anything except harm economic growth in the United States, or in any other country. In a private exchange about what might happen in such a situation, the chief economist of a large global investment management and research firm offered, “Nobody can say, really. But it seems like it would be bad.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;off-target&quot;&gt;Off Target&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to reaching any end state — good or bad — aiming for victory points U.S. policy toward costly non-liberal economic practices and risky military confrontation. Today’s economic prescriptions for beating China include imposing high tariffs on imported Chinese goods, enacting export controls and supply chain requirements that restrict access to China’s commercial market, and favoring bilateral trade deals over multilateral free trade agreements. Such parochialist and protectionist policies harm the U.S. economy and strain its otherwise productive, long-term relationships with allies, partners, and friends worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military prescriptions for beating China invariably include increases in U.S. defense spending and plans to bulk up U.S. military presence in the Indo-Pacific. This is despite the fact that although Americans are increasingly uncomfortable with China’s growing presence in international affairs, they are not more concerned about China’s military power than they are about its human rights record. It also is despite the math: expert analysis estimates that in 2024 China’s defense spending totaled $471 billion — “around 36 percent of comparable U.S. defense spending of about $1.3 trillion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of trying to beat China, it would seem, will come at a steep price to the American — and global — economy, while also requiring the United States to outspend China on defense by more than the current ratio of nearly 3 to 1. It is insufficient to justify this differential on the basis that the United States is a global power with global interests while China’s concerns are regional. It is, after all, China’s global threat to U.S. interests that proponents cite as the impetus for the drive to victory in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infusing the Indo-Pacific with U.S. warfighting capability would further provoke China’s anxieties about U.S. intentions toward Taiwan and exacerbate Beijing’s fears about the security of its nuclear arsenal. What it would not do, therefore, is decrease the likelihood of war. It also would not restore U.S. dominance; as remarked by noted defense experts, much of the military superiority the United States enjoyed after the Cold War “is gone . . . and it is not coming back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;its-not-them-its-us&quot;&gt;It’s Not Them, It’s Us&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States does not need to defeat, contain, convert, or befriend China. What it needs is a strategy for which the measure of success is what the United States does or does not achieve, not what China does or does not do. Such a strategy will continue to focus on creating the conditions that keep Americans in freedom from want by generating domestic economic productivity and in freedom from fear by minimizing the likelihood of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An affirmative U.S. strategy designed to generate domestic economic productivity will seek to stimulate innovation by growing and attracting human talent, by investing in the research centers and supporting the companies that are developing and applying the next generation of modern technologies, and by promoting access to resource and commercial markets worldwide. It also will attend much more purposefully to the quality of U.S. participation in the institutions that have guided the post–World War II global economy. This is not a bromide about the ability of institutions to constrain powerful states or about the power of diplomatic engagement to settle scores and mend ties. It is a response to the reality that China has made significant investments of capital and talent in expanding and enhancing its ability to shape the operations and outputs of these post-war institutions for the purposes of advancing the interests and values of the CCP. If the United States prefers that the rules that these institutions produce hew toward the interests and values of the United States and other liberal democracies, then it only stands to reason that the United States will need to work more actively and effectively within them to make it so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An affirmative strategy designed to minimize the likelihood of war does not require increasing U.S. forward presence in the Western Pacific. It entails emphasizing the region’s military balance less and acting on its non-military priorities more — transnational crime, illicit resource extraction, climate change, climate-caused security threats, and economic development, for example. Seeking to restore U.S. military superiority would give the appearance of assuming, perhaps mistakenly, that local governments are more fearful of China than they are interested in solving these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. military capability and presence, developed and deployed wisely and with discipline, can enable action on these issues while simultaneously promoting the long-standing and unchanged U.S. interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and in peaceful resolution of disputes throughout the waters of East Asia. Ongoing support for Taiwan’s investment in creative and modern applications of military technology, and for its efforts to increase all-of-society preparedness, will usefully increase the difficulty and cost of any military attack on the people of Taiwan. The United States can similarly encourage regional allies to communicate to China the unprofitability of aggression by being demonstrably prepared to defend their territorial and access interests by investing in their own coastal defense capabilities. And the U.S. Department of Defense can develop the concepts and acquire the tools and platforms that power a dispersed presence, equipped with modern sensing and information technologies and hardened command and control networks. This combined U.S. and allied force profile will provide domain awareness, operational agility with which to respond rapidly to indications and warnings, and mission and asset flexibility without fueling an arms race or being dangerously provocative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seeing-things-as-they-are&quot;&gt;Seeing Things as They Are&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images of competition with China that end with U.S. global dominance restored are illusions. Defeating China will not make the United States a unipolar power again, and that outcome is neither necessary nor sufficient to make Americans prosperous and secure. To the contrary, even if seeking a win ultimately produced one, the United States and the world would be the poorer for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aspiration for an end state in international politics in which most if not all states have representative forms of government has a long intellectual lineage and might, someday, come to pass. In the meantime, the work of U.S. foreign policy is not to rid the world of unrepresentative, illiberal governments. It is to create an international environment in which Americans have opportunity to exercise their talents, to innovate, to grow their national economy, to make progress on solving the world’s pressing problems, and to live with the minimum of worry that their country will be attacked. Unipolarity is not the only structural condition under which U.S. citizens can enjoy these freedoms from want and from fear. A strategy that tries to recapture the primacy of the past century, rather than to position the United States to succeed as a great power in the next one, will most likely fail to do either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the era of great power competition between the United States and China in 2017, a vision of victory in U.S. policy toward China has been the subject of persistent debate. Most U.S. analysts agree that the United States is in a strategic competition with China, but disagreement runs deep on what a victory looks like. Most agree that competition itself is a process rather than a goal or a means to an end. The question is: What is the end?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategists have developed very different visions for the answer. Nicknamed “competition managers” by some Chinese analysts, the Biden administration has been criticized for aiming to “responsibly manage the competition.” Some prominent Republicans have singled out China’s regime type as the essential problem. They have called for “winning the competition” and for a China “free from communist dictatorship.” Yet challenges to that proposition exist even within the Republican Party. In Project 2025, the proposed presidential transition plan drafted by the conservative Heritage Foundation, the China challenge is defined as “rooted in China’s strategic culture and not just the Marxism-Leninism of the [Chinese Communist Party], meaning that internal culture and civil society will never deliver a more normative nation.” The clear implication is that even if the regime changes, or the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) collapses or is overthrown, it will not solve the challenge that China poses to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China has always presented the United States with challenges and problems since the diplomatic normalization in 1979 (even during the engagement era), strategic competition with China is a relatively new development. The Trump administration is generally seen to have initiated this great power competition, even though the origin and momentum of this contest are deeply rooted in past decades of “engagement” policy. The recency tends to lead to bias and a limited field of vision. As put by historian John Lewis Gaddis, “the direct experience of events isn’t necessarily the best path toward understanding them, because your field of vision extends no further than your own immediate senses.” He concludes that “the historian of the past is much better off than the participant in the present, from the simple fact of having an expanded horizon.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaddis’s observation highlights an inconvenient truth: a vision of victory or a theory of success in dealing with a major geopolitical power such as China may ultimately be a matter of ex post facto assessment, rather than an a priori declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-the-cold-war-were-comparable&quot;&gt;If the Cold War Were Comparable&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many strategists have described today’s U.S.-China relations as a “new cold war,” perhaps the original Cold War could be a historical reference point. A key debate is whether and when the United States decided that the total collapse of the Soviet Union was its goal for victory in the Cold War. George Kennan’s “Long Telegram” diagnosed the nature of the Soviet regime, its destructiveness, and its profound sense of insecurity. One could conclude from the “Long Telegram” that regime change, or the “internal change” of the Soviet Union, was Kennan’s view of an endgame for U.S. strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at least two key factors stand out in the assessment of Kennan’s view. The first is that Kennan did not prescribe an actively confrontational policy solely aimed at regime change. He did not believe that the United States alone “could exercise a power of life and death over the Communist movement and bring about the early fall of Soviet power in Russia.” In fact, he advocated for the United States to “increase enormously the strains under which Soviet policy must operate, to force upon the Kremlin a far greater degree of moderation and circumspection.” And the eventual end state would be “either the breakup or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power.” From this perspective, the policy toward the Soviet Union was solidly focused on the process of straining the Soviet Union, pushing Moscow back regionally and globally, and actively competing in all domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, despite Kennan’s conclusion, it took two decades of negotiations and testing each other’s limits before the United States and the Soviet Union established rules to avoid mutual destruction. The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis itself was not sufficient. It took at least another decade for the United States and the Soviet Union to agree to the rules of their coexistence. It was in the early 1970s that the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to several arrangements, including the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty and the Agreement on the Prevention of Incidents on and Over the High Seas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened during those two decades and since then is what Kennan called a “test of national quality.” This was true for the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War and is equally true for the United States and China today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-vision-of-victory&quot;&gt;A Vision of Victory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for those who see the current U.S.-China competition as analogous to the Cold War, it should not be forgotten that the disintegration of the Soviet Union did not eliminate the threat from Russia. It might only have reduced its intensity and scale. Russia may no longer be an existential threat to the United States, but it remains a critical geopolitical challenge, and an acute threat, as demonstrated by the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true for China. Given its history, culture, and physical capacity, China will always remain a geopolitical challenge for the United States, regardless of its regime type. Historically, China had been the hegemon in Asia, and the tributary system — China’s own version of hegemonic stability — is the only international relations system that China knew and that worked in its favor. Beijing’s desire to reclaim its historical primacy in the region is a fundamental cause for its clash with the United States in the western Pacific. China as a nation-state will not, of course, go away; therefore, some type of coexistence with China is almost a given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s defeat might be the next-best outcome. The best and most gratifying historical example of this is the defeat of Germany and Japan in World War II. However, that victory was only the beginning of a long process of reforming Germany and Japan and reintegrating them into a global system based on shared values and interests. The defeat was not the endgame — reform and integration were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the reform and integration of China into the liberal international order is the goal, the theory of victory will look very different. Four decades of engagement since 1979 did not mold China according to the United States’ desired economic and political liberalization model. If the diagnosis is that the CCP is the core of the challenge, the vision of victory will have to include an alternative path that will lead to the desired change without jeopardizing China’s economic and political stability. If a divided and unstable China is indeed the endgame, this might potentially recreate the situation that the United States faced after the breakup of the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros-and-cons&quot;&gt;Pros and Cons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clearly defined vision of victory offers some advantages. Presumably, it will diminish the space for unending debate on China policy and help to direct the United States’ attention and resources in one single strategic direction. From a domestic point of view, it could help forge a national consensus and, to a certain degree — as some would hope — reunite a deeply divided nation through a higher calling to counter a challenge, threat, and adversary that poses a menace to the United States’ society and way of being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, once implemented, any clearly defined vision of victory will become self-reinforcing. China will react and, most likely, respond in kind. A hostile strategy, therefore, will lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy and a self-reinforcing security dilemma between the United States and China. This will further strengthen China’s nature as a threat, reinforce the national consensus, and lock both countries in a fixed trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a single-dimensional, irreversible, and rigid definition of U.S. strategy toward China could be potentially very costly, especially before Kennan’s “test of national quality” renders a concrete, definitive answer about China’s strength and resilience. It could run the risk of underestimating China’s strength and elasticity, posing a potential overstretch of the United States’ resources and capacity. Alternatively, it could overstate the China threat, missing more important priorities and global challenges that could require great power cooperation. Just like it took the United States decades during the Cold War to identify the equilibrium of coexistence with the Soviet Union, it would potentially be premature to declare an endgame in the strategic competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-china-question&quot;&gt;The China Question&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2018, relatively early in the great power competition, Chinese strategists have been complaining about the lack of a clearly defined vision of victory — an endgame — by the United States. In the Chinese narrative, “competition” fundamentally lacks explanatory power in defining the endgame and the cost that the United States is willing to carry for the competition. One prevalent question among Chinese analysts is whether the United States sees strategic competition with China as one of superiority or survival. In these analysts’ view, the former offers space and the possibility for coexistence, while the latter equates to an existential rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China prefers strategic clarity regarding the United States’ endgame. This would help China develop, define, and refine its counterstrategy and, at the same time, forge consensus within China’s bureaucracy and society. It would help the hardliners eliminate dissenting views in China about the U.S. strategic agenda. If the United States were to adopt a Cold War–like strategy, it would push China to tighten domestic control to counter the U.S. threat for the foreseeable future, as some hardliners have called for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s demand for clarity certainly does not require the United States to provide it. Ambiguity might work in the United States’ favor. But how Beijing interprets the U.S. debate on China policy should nonetheless be a consideration, as it impacts an important set of dynamics shaping the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;competition-as-an-imperfect-vision-of-victory&quot;&gt;Competition as an Imperfect Vision of Victory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current state of U.S.-China relations is often summarized as “competition.” The two countries are engaged in a whole-of-government, extensive, and comprehensive competition in almost every domain. It is a true test of national quality. Victory depends not on the result of one contest, but the sum of the results of all the contests. The endgame is unlikely to transpire in the short or medium term. Furthermore, given the nature of the China challenge, which goes beyond the CCP, an eventual victory is unlikely to be as unambivalent and clear-cut as the disintegration of the Soviet Union. If the United States remains vigilant and seeks to actively compete with China in all relevant domains — diplomatic, informational, military, and economic — while vigorously building up its own capacity and competitiveness, the competition strategy will be both a means to an end as well as the end in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People like to ask what the U.S. endgame with China is. The question underestimates the duration and complexity of the competition between two great powers such as China and the United States. Today is not the endgame — far from it. If history serves as precedent, the United States and China are only at the beginning of the game and likely not even the beginning of the end. Given the nature of the China challenge, which does not only originate from its regime type, it is better strategy to compete vigorously at every corner and in every domain rather than declare a goal that may be premature or self-reinforcing and deny other options and possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the United States have a specific “vision of victory” for its China policy? This question assumes that the United States is in competition with China. Few would deny that the two countries are in an intensifying strategic competition. The initial question provokes another — does China have a “vision of victory” for its relations with the United States? It does, and the United States should have one, too. The United States and its allies must share a vision of the future in order to win the strategic competition they have been compelled to enter. That is, they must prevent China from changing the status quo by physical or economic force. If China wants to change the rules that support the international order, it should do so according to the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, when discussing the end goal of the United States’ relations with China, a “vision of victory” may not be enough. The reason is simple. The United States is not only competing with China. It is also cooperating with China, its people, and its companies. There are numerous aspects of the bilateral relationship beyond competition. Discussing only the strategic side will not be enough to understand and envisage the relationship in total. Japan’s relations with China provide an example of how the United States might proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;should-the-united-states-have-a-vision-of-victory-china-does&quot;&gt;Should the United States Have a “Vision of Victory?” China Does.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In explaining China’s vision, Japan serves as a productive example. When comparing China’s policies toward Japan and toward the United States, it is evident that while China’s Japan policy is rather murky, its U.S. policy is quite clear. Beijing has been sending mixed signals to Tokyo for decades. At the November 2023 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed with Japanese prime minister Kishida Fumio that Japan and China should comprehensively promote mutually beneficial relations with common strategic interests and strive to construct a constructive and stable relationship. A few months later, at the May 2024 trilateral summit with Prime Minister Kishida and President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea, Chinese premier Li Qiang offered a proposal for cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, science and technology, and sustainable development, among others. At the same time, however, China pilloried Japan for releasing treated water from the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean. To this day, Beijing calls it “contaminated water” and bans the import of seafood products, including freshwater koi. In addition, some Chinese scholars continue to question the international status of Okinawa, over 50 years after the United States returned its administrative authority to Japan. These scholars claim that China never agreed on Okinawa’s status since it did not take part in the 1951 San Francisco Peace Conference, which acknowledged Japan’s residual sovereignty. Moreover, the Chinese government has not stopped regularly sending its coast guard vessels into the Senakaku Islands’ territorial waters and their contiguous zone. All are grave challenges to the international order in Northeast Asia. What, then, is China’s Japan policy? Chinese international affairs experts themselves often wonder if China even has one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contrasts sharply with China’s view of what it wants to do with the United States, the sole superpower. Although the text of China’s National Security Strategy for 2021–2025 has not been publicly released, based on the words of Xi Jinping, the strategy is likely designed as part of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s larger goal of becoming a leading world power. It is well known that Xi encourages his people with phrases such as “the East is rising and the West is declining” and “we are advancing towards the center of the world stage.” Internally, he has declared, “History indicates a true world power is one that is both a sea power and a land power. . . . It is our important strategic decision to proceed from a land power to a nation that is both a land power and a sea power.” Does Xi mean to replace the United States as the hegemonic power and initiate a Pax Sinica? At the least, this is probably not the target for 2025. China knows its national power will not reach that level soon. However, China’s intentions grow as its power increases. In 1973, for example, former premier Zhou Enlai did not deny the possibility that China would become hegemonistic in the future. China has actually become more ambitious along with the rise in its national power. Xi Jinping himself told President Barack Obama that the Pacific Ocean was big enough to accommodate both the United States and China. Ten years later, he told President Joe Biden that the globe is big enough to accommodate the two. In fact, Xi has a personal liking for standing center stage. In 2018, he told the late prime minister Abe Shinzo that he would have become either a Democrat or a Republican and not a member of the U.S. Communist Party had he been born in the United States, since a politician should aim to stand center stage. Xi knows it’s impossible for China to leapfrog the United States in the near future, but his end goal is to eventually win the competition, do away with the global dominance of U.S. forces and the supremacy of the U.S. dollar, and gain power and prestige as the Middle Kingdom. From his remarks and the policies Xi promotes, this would appear to be his “China Dream.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite pursuing dominance, China argues for a multicentered world. For example, the recent Resolution of the Third Plenum of the 20th Central Committee of the CCP stated that China calls for an equal and orderly multipolar world. This is especially appealing to many countries in the so-called Global South, where anti-Western sentiments are running high. But what do the Chinese really mean by multipolarity? Judging from the way China exerts pressure on smaller nations via paramilitary vessels and measures of economic coercion, it would appear that, for China, equality exists only among the poles themselves, and not between the poles and other, smaller nations. Despite the modest, friendly language written in leaders’ speeches and other policy documents, any potential Pax Sinica seems actually to be a global extension of the Pax Communista, that is, their domestic order as supported by the potent power of the CCP and not by rule of law. Such multipolarity is unacceptable to the great majority of the countries in the world. In order to counter this Chinese vision, and to prevent China from changing the status quo through physical and economic force, the United States must share its “vision for victory” with allied nations, working with them in the pursuit of a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maintenance of peace and the preservation of the rule of law may not appear to be a decisive “victory.” However, the United States and its partners need to face a reality: what is best for the United States, its allies, and the world is to coexist and cooperate with China where possible, while competing with it fiercely where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;winning-the-strategic-competition-is-not-enough&quot;&gt;Winning the Strategic Competition Is Not Enough&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preventing China from changing the status quo through physical and economic force does not mean that the United States should wage a new cold war or sever the cooperative ties between the two nations. Rather, the vision of the future should include the possibility of prosperous collaboration in the areas of economics, non-traditional security, and other global issues (e.g., climate change, environmental protection, and global pandemics). But can the United States compete and cooperate at the same time? Japan’s experience over the past 15 years offers one potential path to do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Komiyama Hiroshi, former president of the University of Tokyo, dubbed Japan an “advanced country in meeting new challenges.” Earlier than many other countries, Japan has had to face the challenges of a financial crisis, an aging society, and the fallout from a nuclear power plant accident caused by a tsunami. It has also faced the challenge of China’s rise. Needless to say, Japan directly aided China’s economic rise and has benefited from it. Although Japan stopped embarking on new official development assistance (ODA) projects to China in 2018, it remains the largest historic donor nation toward China’s economic and social development. However, along with the rapid rise in its economic power, China increased its military might. Chinese leaders used to say that they had no intention of building aircraft carriers or of militarizing the South China Sea, but their actions tell a different story. The focus of tension between Japan and China has been the Senkaku Islands. China claimed sovereignty over them for the first time in December 1971 and started printing the Chinese name Diaoyudao (钓鱼岛) on their maps, replacing the islands’ Japanese name — Senkaku Islands (尖閣列島) and Uo-tsuri-jima (魚釣島). Although there was a tacit understanding between the two governments that neither side should touch the issue or change the status quo, China began to abrogate its agreement by sending fishing boats (1978), research vessels (1990s), and eventually the Chinese Coast Guard (2008) into the Senkaku Islands’ territorial waters. The initial patrol boat intrusion in December 2008 was likely the result of the recently introduced (2006) policy to regularly patrol Chinese maritime interests in the East China Sea. In 2012, when the Japanese government purchased three of the five major islands in the Senkakus from a private landlord with the aim of stabilizing the situation, China seized the opportunity and started consistently sending their patrol boats into the islands’ territorial waters and contiguous zone. Japan originally did not think that China would increase its national power such that it would be able to start physically challenging Japan’s interests and sovereignty so quickly (if at all). But China’s military rise and its maritime advancement eventually posed a serious potential threat, and Japan had no choice but to stand up to this strategic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters, and further increasing strategic tension, Japanese firms were attracted by the growing Chinese market and its appeal as a profitable production site in the increasingly globalized world economy. China overtook the United States as Japan’s largest trading partner in 2004 and has remained in that position. As of May 2024, there were over 31,000 Japanese companies registered in China. According to a survey conducted by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China in the spring of 2024, 26 percent of Japanese companies in China consider the country their most important market in 2024 and beyond; another 26 percent declared that the Chinese market was one of their three most important markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Japan has adopted a two-pronged approach toward China — compete and cooperate concurrently. This is, in many ways, a seemingly contradictory approach. If one is concerned about security, then Japan should not cooperate with China, since cooperation makes China stronger. But then economic and business experts would counter that if Japan stopped cooperating with China, it would lose the economic vibrancy that constitutes the foundation for the competition itself. Which side is right? Both. And this is Japan’s dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the United States is less dependent on the Chinese economy, the situation is roughly analogous; this applies to Europe as well, especially since China began supporting Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. China, for its part, is facing the same dilemma in reverse. It is true that striking the right balance between competition and cooperation is increasingly difficult, particularly as it is likely that strategic competition will intensify, while economic, environmental, and cultural cooperation widens and deepens. However, the reality is that people often live with contradictions and dilemmas. Japan has had to live with them in dealing with China for the past 15-plus years. Of course, this is not an easy situation. The world needs to strive, persevere, and maintain peace by mobilizing every means and method possible. Balancing, hedging, communicating for strategic reassurance, and exchanging at all levels in order to promote mutual understanding all require maintaining strategic patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;upholding-strategic-patience-until-when&quot;&gt;Upholding Strategic Patience until When?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for how long must the United States and the world uphold strategic patience? The answer is until China changes. Much mainstream thinking in the United States today holds that China has not and will not change. However, China and Chinese society have changed enormously in the past 40 years. True, the CCP clings on to (and has even increased) its power and is prone to wield that power forcefully. Likewise, Xi Jinping is reversing the trend of political and administrative reform set by Deng Xiaoping and his friends started in the 1980s. But the path of history is always a zigzag. Xi is desperate to indoctrinate the Chinese people because he knows that the Chinese people have changed, both the elite and ordinary, everyday people. Nobody can shape China from the outside; only the Chinese people can change China. One day the transformation will start, triggered perhaps by a financial crisis or another pandemic. No one knows when the transformation will start, if that process will be peaceful, or what the final end state will be. The United States and other countries could help the Chinese people, perhaps through inviting more students and tourists. Though this path involves myriad risks and challenges, if the internal order of China is eventually transformed into one that is supported by the rule of law, the returns would be high, and there will be a significant, positive change in the nature of the relations between China and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, U.S. policy toward China has shifted from being a somewhat niche topic, covered almost exclusively by a small group of China watchers, to the center stage of debates over national security and foreign policy. Those debates spawn questions such as, does the United States need a specific “vision of victory” for its China policy? And, if it does, what is it? Or, if not, why not? It is tempting to desire a clear and concise end state when crafting policy but doing so would be shortsighted. U.S. policy toward China has been and remains nested within broader national strategies and policies, making it difficult to adopt one specific vision of victory or strategic end state for policy toward China. Such U.S. policy only makes sense within the broader outline of what Americans want the world to look like and what they are willing to sacrifice to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem like an unsatisfying answer, but the United States already has a well-developed vision of victory, and that vision has been remarkably consistent for nearly a century. Leaders from across the last fifteen presidential administrations (which implies a considerable degree of support by the American people) believed that U.S. security and prosperity depend on building, expanding, and maintaining an international system that privileges democracies over authoritarian regimes. Whether one calls it a “liberal international order” or a “rules-based international order,” the concept is the same. Allowing for a situation to emerge in which the United States is isolated, cut off from foreign markets, and surrounded by more powerful and hostile powers is a disastrous scenario that U.S. strategists and political leaders have been wise to avoid. U.S. policymakers from across the political spectrum largely share the vision that security and prosperity rest on an international environment that is “maximally favorable to the United States, our allies and partners, and the interests and values we share.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In countless speeches and documents over nearly a century, U.S. policymakers have described the attributes of the desired international order. For example, the Biden administration described the challenge facing the United States and their version of the vision of victory in their October 2022 National Security Strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The post-Cold War era is definitively over and a competition is underway between the major powers to shape what comes next. No nation is better positioned to succeed in this competition than the United States, as long as we work in common cause with those who share our vision of a world that is free, open, secure, and prosperous. This means that the foundational principles of self-determination, territorial integrity, and political independence must be respected, international institutions must be strengthened, countries must be free to determine their own foreign policy choices, information must be allowed to flow freely, universal human rights must be upheld, and the global economy must operate on a level playing field and provide opportunity for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quotation above describes a vision for how the world works, and how Americans want it to work. It observes that the nature of the international order is contested, and it ties U.S. prosperity and security to an international order with particular characteristics. Not every U.S. administration has or will define this international order in precisely the same language, but their descriptions are close enough to view the underlying consensus that Americans have about the world they desire, as well as how that vision differs from the alternative international order that Beijing and Moscow are trying to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The embrace of this concept of a “maximally favorable” international order is so ingrained in U.S. strategic culture that it is very difficult to imagine an alternative end state that Americans would be willing to accept (whether Americans are willing to bear the costs to maintain it is a different question). This is the vision of victory or end state that strategists demand an articulation of and from which all subordinate policies and strategies (including U.S. policy toward China) flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. strategic culture views alternative international orders based on anti-liberal characteristics (whether built by Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, the Soviet Union, or the People’s Republic of China) as threats to be countered, contained, and vanquished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This begs another question: if the U.S. end state has been so consistent in how Americans define their vision of victory, what accounts for the changes in U.S. policy toward China?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the 1970s and the early 2010s, U.S. policymakers largely viewed China as a partner (or potential partner) in achieving broader U.S. objectives, first in helping the United States weaken and isolate the Soviet Union, and later in becoming a “responsible stakeholder” in the international order. As long as U.S. policymakers assumed that China’s leaders shared mutual objectives with the United States and that Chinese interests were converging with U.S. interests (or at least as long as Americans thought they could persuade Beijing of these things), U.S. policy sought to accelerate China’s economic growth and strengthen the Sino-American partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two decades following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the goal of U.S. policy toward China was to ensure that a potential rival became a strategic partner instead. This was in line with a wider set of bilateral and multilateral policies that sought to turn the world’s major powers into partners to be swayed and persuaded, as opposed to rivals to be countered and contained. U.S. policymakers wanted Chinese leaders to succeed with a form of “reform and opening” that fit U.S. interests (whether this was the same “reform and opening” Chinese leaders were pursuing is another matter). As Orville Schell has observed, U.S. policymakers wanted China to become “a little bit more soluble” in the world the United States had built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under these conditions, it made little sense for U.S. policymakers to imagine a vision of victory with regard to China policy (aside from the ultimate political liberalization that would come with Beijing’s mellowing as its citizens became wealthier and more connected to the rest of the world). This was a relationship that needed to be managed, not a rivalry to be won. If one were to press U.S. policymakers during that time, many would have likely claimed that their objective was to prevent the start of a second cold war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the early 2010s, U.S. policymakers could see that Chinese and U.S. interests were diverging, and their objectives were in greater conflict. In response to these developments, U.S. policy became more competitive. The debate today centers around how competitive that policy should be and whether the U.S. should treat the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as a rival, or even an adversary, bent on undermining the United States’ broader end state of a liberal international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2022, this change in thinking and policy revealed itself with statements like this from Secretary of State Antony Blinken:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing’s vision would move us away from the universal values that have sustained so much of the world’s progress over the past 75 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, Chinese actions over the past 15 years changed the minds of U.S. policymakers about Chinese intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where there had once been optimism about “reform and opening,” there came to be hardened conclusions that Beijing’s vision of victory — the Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation — could only be achieved at the expense of the U.S. rules-based order. As the implications of these conclusions sunk in, U.S. administrations shifted U.S. policy away from engagement and partnership with Beijing, and toward rivalry and hostility (an approach that Chinese leaders had already adopted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-partner-to-rival&quot;&gt;From “Partner” to “Rival”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This U.S. vision is not a secret, and for many living in Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, it has become banal. The effort by the United States and its partners to build, expand, and maintain an international order that favors liberal values while disadvantaging authoritarian regimes has been on display for decades. The citizens living within this order take it for granted, with many assuming that its existence is natural, the way things ought to be. But even as some dismiss talk of an international order as empty rhetoric, it is important to consider how this decades-long effort is interpreted in places like Beijing and Moscow, as well as in Pyongyang and Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leaders of these regimes have come to view this international order as an existential threat, one that compels them to set aside their differences and cooperate. As far back as Mao Zedong in the 1950s and continuing through to the present, Chinese leaders have interpreted efforts by the United States to bring about democratic reforms as a deceptive tactic meant to weaken and topple the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Known as “peaceful evolution” (a term Mao borrowed from speeches given by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles), the concept is employed by Chinese leaders to explain a long-term U.S. effort to drive the CCP from power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fall of the Berlin Wall, revolutions across Eastern Europe, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the collapse of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union turned a vague sense of vulnerability into an acute fear. As South Korea and Taiwan transitioned from authoritarian rule to democracy a pattern started to emerge. The United States and NATO’s war against Serbia fit the pattern. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan fit the pattern. As a series of color revolutions took place in the 2000s and 2010s, leaders in Beijing and Moscow became convinced that all these events were connected: the United States was intentionally causing revolutions (some peaceful, others violent), and it was only a matter of time before the leaders in Beijing and Moscow faced the same fates as Ceauşescu and Gaddafi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For individuals like Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, the grand strategy of the United States and its vision to build and extend a liberal international order poses an existential threat to their personalized rule. History provides them with stark examples from their predecessors who failed to take seriously the threat posed by the United States. One of the key lessons that their predecessors left is the danger that arises when the United States can take advantage of divisions between China and Russia. From Xi and Putin’s perspectives, the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s sowed the seeds for the Soviet Union’s collapse two decades later. The two leaders understand how critical it is for their two countries to remain aligned. Preventing their own isolation and accentuating divisions between the United States and its allies is vital to their own survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that Xi and Putin have set their sights as low as simply survival. Actions and assumptions by leaders in Beijing and Moscow brought about the end of the post-Cold War era, and the United States has entered an era of the second cold war. Both leaders want their nations to flourish and see them resume, what many of their countrymen believe to be, their rightful places at the center of the world stage. The United States stands in the way of those more ambitious visions. Thus, the only way to achieve them, under the leadership of Xi and Putin, is to dismantle what the United States has built over the past century. Fracturing the U.S.-sponsored international order and replacing it with one that privileges Beijing and Moscow is the only long-term end state that serves the interests and desires of both men. It is clear that if they are successful in creating what they intend, the new international order will be anti-liberal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different Chinese and Russian leaders might make different assumptions, different calculations, and different decisions, but for the foreseeable future, the United States will be dealing with Xi and Putin and the regimes they have built. The United States should prevent Xi and Putin from achieving their vision, and it must put considerable pressure on their regimes. That will require a significant increase in U.S. defense spending (and the defense spending of U.S. partners), as well as a realignment of our economies away from both the PRC and Russia (call it de-risking or decoupling, the concept is the same). The United States will need to contain them militarily and isolate them economically. This will require serious upfront sacrifice, as well as prioritizing these efforts over a rapid energy transition that is overly reliant on the PRC. But the United States should be confident that it can build a much more prosperous international system than its rivals can. The United States therefore needs to play for time and wait for leaders to emerge in Beijing and Moscow who will be open to compromise on its terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;George Kennan often lamented that ambiguities in his “Long Telegram” allowed it to be used as the intellectual basis for a global military containment effort he never intended. Kennan thought the Soviets could be defeated by a more calibrated (and less costly) approach. Decades later, he said “My thoughts . . . were distorted by the people who understood it and pursued it exclusively as a military concept, and I think that, as much as any other cause, led to [the] 40 years of unnecessary, fearfully expensive and disoriented process of the Cold War.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current ambiguity over the end-state goal of U.S. policy toward China is an impediment to strategy development. Without defined ends, strategy — the application of means to an end — is incomplete and ineffective. Today, wide gaps exist within both Republican and Democratic foreign policy debates over what the desired end state with regard to China should be. To be sure, the lack of a clear answer under the past two administrations did not prevent the U.S. policy pivot to strategic competition under the Trump administration or, under the Biden administration, the reboot of U.S. industrial policy and the profound reshaping of the Indo-Pacific security architecture. But, as with Kennan’s formulation, ambiguity over the theory of victory for U.S. policy toward China can contribute over time to an environment fertile for strategic incoherence and overreach. This is the case for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, domestic U.S. consensus around a theory of victory is essential to a durable China strategy. What exists in Washington today is more a diagnostic convergence over key aspects of the China challenge than a true bipartisan union around strategy, as the latter requires an alignment of means against clearly defined end goals. Phrases such as “bipartisan consensus” and “malign Chinese behavior” elide over the central question: Does the United States seek to blunt or change China’s policies and actions by affecting the leadership’s cost calculus or, alternatively, is it the nature of the regime itself that must change before the country’s policies will shift? This question matters because the subset of appropriate responses along the policy spectrum will vary between different end-state formulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current administration’s answer evolved from Jake Sullivan and Kurt Campbell’s 2019 Foreign Affairs essay outlining why a steady state was preferable to an end state in the U.S.-China context. This notion implicitly underpinned the 2022 National Security Strategy, Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s 2022 speech outlining the Biden administration’s China policy, and subsequent speeches from cabinet officials. Yet much of the current administration’s answer to what that means revolves around articulating what its China policy is not. For example, in early 2024, Jake Sullivan stated “We expect that the PRC will be a major player on the world stage for the foreseeable future. That means that even as we compete, we have to find ways to live alongside one another. Competition with the PRC does not have to lead to conflict, confrontation, or a new Cold War.” This approach made sense as a placeholder while the United States worked to rebuild its domestic strength and fortify key partnerships, but in dodging the end-state question, the policy increasingly catalyzes debate over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some scholars have proposed a regime-based theory of victory as an alternative to a U.S.-defined end state for U.S. policy. This approach has several shortcomings. First, the United States lacks the ability to achieve its goals in most domains without third-country support, and the coalition that would align around a regime-based framing is a solitary one. Second, a successor regime would not necessarily jettison Beijing’s broad ambitions unless they lacked the resources and power to do so. The historical record suggests that nearly 80 percent of authoritarian regimes conclude with a depressing end — another regime that pursues similar interests. Third, it is unclear whether ordinary Chinese citizens dislike the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as much as some scholars believe they do, or at least should. In fact, many Chinese people who are dissatisfied with current policies indicate privately that they pin their hopes on the transition to the next generation of CCP leaders who came of age after the Cultural Revolution and in many cases studied abroad — some of whom are quite candid in private about their frustration with the current direction of domestic and external policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a theory of victory could arguably be considered better than no theory, the challenge for the next administration is to articulate a clearer alternative to a steady state, or many will read into the ambiguity of the current formulation that regime change is the ultimate U.S. hope. Raja Krishnamurthi (D-IL) has spoken of an end state in which China’s policies moderate, returning Beijing to a greater pragmatism akin to that of Deng Xiaoping. Krishnamurthi admitted that the odds of this happening are not high, meaning the United States must be prepared for a long competition. While the Republican and Democrat co-chairs of the House Select Committee on the CCP found some common ground, the risk in eliding over gaps — especially the lack of a coherent end state — is that prioritization comes to be defined more by which constituencies are loudest than by a clear strategic North Star. Even the House Select Committee name implies that the problem is the CCP, not its policies, creating a perhaps unintended messaging around the motivation behind the 150 bipartisan recommendations it put forward last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, ambiguity over U.S. end-state goals undercuts coalition-building efforts by allowing third-country suspicions (and the Russia/China “color revolution” narrative) to fill in the blanks. Many abroad suspect that regime change (or its passive cousin, peaceful evolution) remains the secret U.S. intention, or at least that it could become the goal of some future administration. These suspicions shape the context within which third countries consider the choices Washington is asking of them. Although ambiguity over the end state did not prevent the Biden administration from engineering alignment around advanced computing restrictions with the Dutch, Japanese, and South Koreans, new trilateral mechanisms, AUKUS, or the strengthened Quad, it does evoke suspicion, even hesitation. For example, third-country diplomatic colleagues often confide that suspicion of the United States envisioning a regime-change end state sometimes acts as a partially engaged emergency brake, limiting the speed of alignment on coordinated policy responses or providing excuses to hedge in these areas. When it comes to convergence over the “core interests” of the CCP — such as human rights, Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Xinjiang — the impact of this ambiguity is more pronounced, as even like-minded nations balk at tactics (e.g., visa sanctions on Chinese leaders and their families) as going beyond human rights advocacy and into regime delegitimization efforts. Ambiguous formulations complicate U.S. messaging by allowing others — including China itself — to paint U.S. intentions as seeking a “color revolution” — a narrative that appeals to the instincts of autocrats, countries where past U.S. regime change strategies went awry, and to the vast majority of Global South countries who see their interest as staying on the sidelines of a new cold war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the absence of a clear end state impedes the development of detailed implementation guidance within the executive branch. A sharper end state is a precondition to articulating more robust internal executive branch implementation guidance and prioritization frameworks akin to those that served as the bureaucratic operating system during the Cold War. Key internal National Security Council strategy documents offered robust assessments of the strategic choices facing the United States during the Cold War, the rationale for adopting a specific course of action, and the implications for policies across various domains (including even taxation). No similar strategy documents have emerged regarding the policy toward China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national security and defense strategies of two successive administrations as well as key speeches from administration officials offer partial answers to the question of overall strategy (including desired end states) in some domains (particularly Indo-Pacific security), but in other areas discrete tactical decisions (e.g., visa restrictions targeting CCP leaders and their families) often accumulate to give the impression of a strategic regime-change end state, complicating alignment with allies and strategic communications efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the steady state formula is too ambiguous to shape frameworks for evaluating the costs and benefits of policy options or to determine when incentives should be considered versus a mix of solely defensive or punitive measures. An “everything, everywhere, all at once” dynamic sometimes results among the roughly 1,400 parts of the U.S. government which hold some legal or regulatory authority over aspects of China policy. Executive branch structures originally constituted to tackle more straightforward national security challenges — such as bilateral relationships or specific functional issues like counterterrorism or arms control — are often not configured to manage global, multidimensional challenges such as technology competition or to reconcile U.S. objectives across geographic and bureaucratic boundaries. Too often, the tendency is for these individual bureaucratic actors to articulate niche China “strategies” which often become the justification for resource requests or starting points for debates that should more accurately be framed as cost-benefit equations against a cohesive administration policy that could include trade-offs or requests the United States’ makes of partner nations. No single Executive Office of the President (EOP) structure can coordinate these debates; the National Security Council, National Economic Council, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Office of Management and Budget, and Office of Legislative Affairs are all peer-equals, reporting (loosely) to the White House chief of staff with little statutory authority over cabinet agencies. Moreover, within the executive branch, there is a dearth of expertise in critical areas (including both Sinologists and technologists), and much of the proprietary external analysis is not shared between agencies. Finally, rotational bureaucracies and political appointee staffing create incentives to prioritize what can be achieved (or avoided) within timeframes of two to three years and disincentivize specialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, China’s perception of the debate should also be considered. Regardless of future trendlines, China currently accounts for a quarter of the world’s population and a third of global growth, and for over a decade, it has been the world’s largest trading nation and the largest bilateral trading partner with most of the world. Many in the senior leadership — including Xi himself — have long believed that the U.S. endgame is regime change, and, as such, there is no middle ground between the two governments. This limits the utility of assurances to the contrary, despite the Biden administration’s efforts. Yet former National Security Council deputy senior director for China Rush Doshi and others have spoken eloquently about the role leader-level diplomacy has played in keeping the Chinese leadership from interpreting specific competitive actions (e.g., tech restrictions or new funding for Taiwan’s defense) as tactics of regime change rather than as reflections of specific policy concerns. This diplomatic approach has kept the U.S.-China relationship from unravelling as it did in 2020, when channels froze after Covid-19 and parts of the Chinese system convinced themselves that the U.S. military was planning some form of imminent attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the problem of an unarticulated end state goes beyond Xi. Yes, he is the dominant figure now, but China still has politics below his level and he will not live forever. Chinese scholars often say that even perceptions of a U.S. regime-change goal feed hardline views within the system and make it more difficult to advocate for moderate perspectives on issues that are subject to debate even under Xi, such as parts of economic and social policy or tactical aspects of China’s external policies. These same academics often interpret the phrase “outcompete” in the 2022 National Security Strategy and the word “prevail” in the 2021 Interim National Security Strategy as code for a comprehensive containment strategy aimed at unseating the CCP. Many Chinese contacts saw the shift in U.S. export-control strategy from maintaining a few generations’ lead to “maintain[ing] as large of a lead as possible” in foundational technologies as akin to a technology containment strategy meant to deny China’s move up the value-added chain. Subsequent assurances that U.S. restrictions would entail merely a “small yard, high fence” achieved little traction as advances in technology frequently force recalibrations of U.S. protection measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, nearly every advanced technology is inherently dual-use, and China’s current development strategy increasingly centers around dominating advanced technologies, particularly those with offensive or defensive importance and the supply chains that support them. In a sense, China’s leaders are right that the United States seeks to block China’s ability to achieve its economic and technology ambitions, as both present a threat to U.S. national and economic security objectives. The question is what condition — leadership or policy change — could alter U.S. strategy. If framed around the former, some Chinese scholars claim it becomes more difficult to argue internally for desired U.S. changes, though it is difficult to judge in an increasingly opaque decisionmaking system. Even amid uncertainty, it seems advantageous to reduce the chances that ambiguity around the desired U.S. end state sends strategic signals the United States’ does not intend, particularly into a system it does not adequately understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Michael J. Mazarr has written, great power rivalries only truly end in one of three ways: one side collapses or is conquered, one side decides to give up and grants predominance to the other, or both sides agree to transcend the competition and develop a different relationship. Surrender is not a logical national strategy, nor should the United States bet on China’s submission or the collapse of the CCP. The remaining approach would be to leave open the theoretical possibility of transcending current dynamics over time, if China makes key policy choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strategic end state requires setting conditions that are achievable at a reasonable cost with the sustained support from the American people and U.S. allies. A China that chooses to regulate its modernization efforts of the People’s Liberation Army via transparency and strategic stability discussions, to live within its current borders, to incentivize demand over supply, to rein in industrial policies, to curtail cyber hacking and intellectual property theft, and to keep its law enforcement and influence tactics within the scope of normal state-to-state behavior would offer the United States different policy choices. Whether these shifts are possible under CCP rule or under Xi is unclear — no one really knows what China will look like in a year, much less a decade. Returning the end state focus to policy differences, rather than the nature of the regime, will lend discipline to U.S. tactics and strategy, remove hedging excuses from allies, and perhaps leave oxygen within China for debates over failing strategies that could, over time, moderate as a result of economic constraints or unforeseeable internal political dynamics. This would also avoid the Kennan trap of allowing others to define the end state for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

This report, the first in a series of four, explains how export controls have accelerated and scaled Chinese efforts to design out (i.e., adopt alternative sources for U.S. technologies) and design around (i.e., innovate new technologies that bypass U.S. technologies altogether), ultimately facilitating a shift of global semiconductor supply chains away from the United States. This report describes how the design-out and design-around strategies jeopardize U.S. economic and national security due to the diversion of sales and innovation to China and other nations’ technology champions. The report then describes Chinese efforts to develop advanced packaging capabilities to “leapfrog” U.S. and allies’ leadership in leading-edge chip design and manufacturing. It is argued that advanced packaging provides a key example of the design-around trend and threatens to shift the balance of U.S.-China competition in critical technologies. The report concludes with emphasizing the importance and challenges of greater multilateralization as well as potential avenues to mitigate the negative impacts of controls on U.S. companies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has undertaken a significant shift in its economic security strategy in recent years. As geopolitical competition with China has accelerated, U.S. policymakers have increasingly leveraged restrictions on critical and emerging technologies (CETs) to safeguard U.S. leadership in military and dual-use applications such as artificial intelligence (AI). Export controls have reemerged as a widely utilized economic security tool in the U.S. arsenal, with the aim of slowing Chinese technological progression by limiting access to U.S. and allied nations’ products. Advanced semiconductors have been a key focus of these efforts due to their national security implications, chief among them the enablement of advanced AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s actions toward Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE marked an early, pivotal moment in the United States’ expanded use of export controls. In April 2018, President Donald Trump imposed tough restrictions on ZTE’s access to a range of U.S. technologies, including semiconductors, putting the company on the verge of bankruptcy. Despite Trump’s later reversal, the episode showcased a renewed embrace of export controls by Washington as a tool of economic coercion. Another key moment came in a 2022 speech by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, in which he announced that the United States must “maintain as large of a lead as possible” over China in the fields of advanced logic and memory chips. This was a departure from the longstanding “sliding scale” approach, in which the United States sought to stay “a couple generations ahead” of strategic competitors like China but did not impose broad measures to restrict technological progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Biden administration, the U.S. government has implemented two major rounds of semiconductor export controls targeting advanced semiconductor supply chains in countries of concern, most notably China. As of this report’s release, Washington remains engaged in discussions around enacting further measures. The U.S. goal is to ensure that Chinese semiconductor capabilities remain well behind the global technological frontier in the interest of protecting U.S. national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as the U.S. government has expanded efforts to control global semiconductor markets, Chinese officials and businesses have responded — often in ways not entirely anticipated by U.S. policymakers. For one, Chinese policymakers and businesses have employed various methods to circumvent U.S. export controls. These include importing controlled U.S. technologies from third countries via overseas shell companies, redirecting semiconductor technologies to prohibited entities via domestic technology trading networks, misleading foreign suppliers about the end uses of imported technologies, and stockpiling equipment before regulations take effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While circumvention efforts have been a key topic of discussion for the U.S. export controls, less attention has been paid to the other key impact of the controls: catalyzing a government-and industry-wide effort within the Chinese semiconductor industry to do away with U.S. companies and technology entirely. While Beijing has for decades been interested in building domestic semiconductor production, the Biden administration’s controls transformed the timeline and scale of these efforts. China’s government and commercial sector have begun undertaking a supply chain transformation aimed at reducing reliance on U.S. semiconductor technologies wherever possible. These efforts aim to mitigate the impact of current export controls and reduce the long-term vulnerability of China’s semiconductor ecosystem to future U.S. trade actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s semiconductor ecosystem is following two main pathways to achieve this goal: design-out and design-around. Together, these strategies threaten to render U.S. export control policies — even when comprehensively enforced — less effective as a longer-term barrier to Chinese technological progression in advanced semiconductors. More importantly, they also threaten to weaken U.S. semiconductor industry leadership overall by hindering U.S. companies’ market access and revenue — and consequently, their long-term leadership in research and development (R&amp;amp;D):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design out: supplanting existing U.S. and allied semiconductor technologies with comparable technologies, from either&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;a. Chinese firms; or&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;b. third-country (non-U.S. and non-Chinese firms)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design around: developing new technologies that do away with an entire category of controlled technology in the semiconductor supply chain&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s design-out and design-around efforts are threats to U.S. policymakers and domestic business leaders working to develop a strong domestic technological industrial base and compete with powerful dual-use technologies. Therefore, they are threats to U.S. national and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report argues that if they are not responded to properly, design-out and design-around efforts mean that U.S. export control policy could unintentionally undermine the United States’ long-term positioning in its geopolitical and economic competition against China to “win the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-design-out-strategy&quot;&gt;The Design-Out Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese policymakers are increasingly concerned about dependence on U.S. technology within China’s semiconductor supply chain. Private sector interests, namely Chinese semiconductor companies, have also come to realize the business risks of overreliance on U.S. technology. To minimize the impact of current restrictions and hedge against a future tightening of controls, Chinese policymakers and semiconductor companies are working to “design out” U.S. technology from China’s semiconductor ecosystem — in other words, to replace U.S. suppliers with alternatives wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, non-U.S. production lines are being built out in two ways. First, China’s central and local governments are investing billions to help domestic firms produce the designs, components, and tools necessary for manufacturing semiconductors. At the same time, there is new government pressure on Chinese semiconductor companies to procure key technologies domestically. These manufacturers, themselves wary of the commercial risks of reliance on foreign technology, are also increasingly eager to buy from Chinese suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, companies from third countries (i.e., countries other than the United States and China) — whose governments are resistant to expanding export controls on China due to concerns about lost revenue and access to Chinese markets — are filling in the gaps left behind by U.S. companies. As Chinese semiconductor manufacturing facilities, known as fabs, buy less and less technology from U.S. suppliers, market opportunities are opening up for firms from third countries, which are not fully aligned with the United States on control policy or enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. controls are designed to apply extraterritorially, which ostensibly complicates import substitution. However, this has not necessarily been the case in practice. Despite the U.S. foreign direct product rules (FDPRs) and de minimis restrictions associated with the controls, which limit foreign companies’ use of some U.S. technology content, there is strong evidence to suggest that import substitution by foreign countries is occurring. Although the Netherlands and Japan imposed new controls in 2023 that replicated aspects of U.S. restrictions, key differences remain in scope and enforcement capabilities — for instance, the ability of foreign companies to offer on-site servicing to Chinese customers. Notable supply countries — such as Germany, South Korea, and Israel — have also not imposed comparable controls. The United States, for its part, continues to pressure allies to expand export regimes to achieve harmonization, but success has proven challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-direct-product-rules&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Foreign Direct Product Rules&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FDPRs apply the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to foreign-made items if they are the “direct product” of certain types of U.S.-origin equipment, software, or other technology, and are destined for designated countries. Specifically, FDPRs empower the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) to require licenses for exports of certain foreign-made products if listed U.S. technology was directly used to produce them or produce key parts of the plants that were used to manufacture the products, such as a tool or a piece of software — even if a controlled U.S. component or system does not appear in the product.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Three FDPRs limit Chinese access to semiconductor technologies: the Entity List (EL), Advanced Computing, and Supercomputer FDPRs. These FDPRs differ in terms of the products, companies, and countries that they cover. The EL FDPR, introduced in May 2020 by the Trump administration, applies U.S. export controls to products destined for hundreds of Chinese (and other foreign) companies and their subsidiaries. These restrictions vary based on the products involved as well as the type of EL classification applicable to the purchaser company. Their reach has continued to grow as the U.S. Department of Commerce has added Chinese firms to the EL. The Advanced Computing FDPR applies the EAR to a narrower range of products meeting certain performance parameters and based on the destination country rather than the destination company. Originally aimed at China, the Advanced Computing FDPR has expanded the list of destination countries to include the countries China likely uses to avoid controls, such as Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Finally, the Supercomputer FDPR applies a country and end-use scope to encompass any items subject to the EAR that are used to produce supercomputers, which are defined based on compute capacity and system dimensions.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;de-minimis-rules&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;De Minimis Rules&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;De minimis rules apply the EAR based on the inclusion of U.S.-origin controlled inputs in foreign-exported goods destined for specific countries. Notably, unlike the FDPRs, use of de minimis rules requires that the exported goods directly contain products produced in the United States that fall under the EAR. This differs from the FDPR’s broader threshold of goods being the “direct product” of certain U.S.-origin technologies or inputs (that do not need to be included in the actual goods being shipped). In cases where the shipment of the U.S. inputs to the final country destination by themselves (i.e., when not incorporated into a final product) would require a license, a de minimis calculation is necessary for the foreign export of the product that contains the inputs. Depending on the type of product and country destination, different de minimis thresholds — or the minimum percentage of U.S.-origin controlled items as a share of “fair market value” at which the EAR applies (typically 10 or 25 percent) — are relevant to the specific good. If the good exceeds the relevant de minimis threshold, an export waiver is required, pursuant to the EAR. For some products (e.g., certain lithography tools), a zero percent de minimis threshold applies, meaning that inclusion of any U.S.-origin controlled input automatically applies the EAR.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-design-around-strategy&quot;&gt;The Design-Around Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond its efforts to replace U.S. technologies one-for-one using domestic and third-country suppliers, China also seeks to develop novel capabilities that offer alternative methods to achieve the same performance capabilities provided by leading-edge chips in microelectronics systems. These innovations would enable China’s semiconductor ecosystem to achieve the capabilities required for applications such as advanced AI, and to do so using technologies that originate in Chinese — rather than U.S. or partner nations’ — intellectual property (IP) and manufacturingcapabilities. This report refers to such efforts as “design-around.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing incentive to innovate ways around U.S. export controls has bolstered domestic R&amp;amp;D efforts and potentially placed China on a quicker path toward semiconductor technological superiority in industry segments where it already held strong market share, such as packaging. For instance, advanced packaging innovations offer one potential path for Chinese companies to achieve cutting-edge chip capabilities without needing to replicate Western semiconductor manufacturing equipment technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The growing incentive to innovate ways around U.S. export controls has bolstered domestic R&amp;amp;D efforts and potentially placed China on a quicker path toward semiconductor technological superiority.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside design-out efforts, design-around provides another tool for the Chinese semiconductor ecosystem to reduce reliance on U.S. technologies in supply chains. It also creates potential opportunities for Chinese companies to ultimately surpass U.S. technological capabilities in semiconductor supply chains. While testifying to a Senate panel in April 2024, a senior U.S. official dealing with export enforcement called attention to this longer-term danger of the design-around issue. “I’m . . . concerned [about] the day that . . . [the Chinese] don’t want our technology, that day that we aren’t the world leader, because that means that they’ve surpassed us and they’ve become superior.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impacts-on-us-economic-and-national-security&quot;&gt;Impacts on U.S. Economic and National Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At an elementary level, well-functioning export controls on advanced, dual-use technologies seek to regulate the export of goods when there is no other method of supply. Otherwise, buyers can simply shift procurement of controlled goods to either domestic suppliers or countries with looser controls. If the controlled technology can be easily sourced from a domestic firm or a foreign country outside of the export control regime (i.e., design-out), then the restriction will only be successful until the replacement technology can fill the resulting demand gap. Additionally, as new substitute technologies emerge (i.e., design-around), export control policies must adjust accordingly, or they risk solely being a hindrance to the home country’s export revenue and its influence within the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the age of the “sliding scale” approach to export controls, the United States’ adversaries consistently lagged behind the technological frontier, in large part due to the global R&amp;amp;D leadership of U.S. companies in key technology areas. In switching to the current approach — “maintaining as large a lead as possible” — the United States hopes to leverage its industry leadership to contain China’s technological progression in military and dual-use technologies. However, the design-out phenomenon threatens to unintentionally undermine this goal and ultimately presents a threat, rather than a boost, to U.S. technology leadership over China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary concern with design-out efforts is that they would allow China to divert global semiconductor industry revenue away from U.S. companies, shrinking U.S. market share and creating new opportunities for Chinese and third-country firms. This risk is by no means trivial since the Chinese semiconductor market is — and is expected to remain — the largest in the world. The potential impacts are also not confined to the Chinese semiconductor market itself, as export controls could create new incentives for foreign-based multinationals to limit their use of U.S. technologies to avoid facing export controls that would affect access to the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, current U.S. export controls risk inadvertently allowing foreign companies to supplant U.S. semiconductor champions throughout key parts of the global market. If this happens, U.S. technological companies stand to lose out on the revenue, as well as share price growth, that serves as the feedstock for R&amp;amp;D investment. R&amp;amp;D is critical for companies in the semiconductor industry given the rapid rate of technology change and the importance of maintaining the leading edge, so any reduction in investment can be devastating to a firm’s positioning. This means that losses in R&amp;amp;D could entail U.S. companies losing the technology leadership they currently have in key parts of the semiconductor supply chain — the very opposite goal of the export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China’s semiconductor industry can successfully remove U.S. technology from its supply chain, then the U.S. government would also lose access to data on Chinese equipment purchases, which sales from U.S. companies currently provide. This data offers insight into the military and dual-use capabilities available to China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), which confers advantages from a national security perspective. U.S. policymakers would also lose a key point of leverage over China. If China no longer utilizes the U.S. technology to make chips, continued implementation and enforcement of U.S. export controls — as well as the threat of introducing new controls — would do little to advance U.S. economic and national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States would also give up some of its ability to influence how CETs are developed and utilized, a key advantage within global technology markets. The following table provides an overview of why CET standard setting is important to U.S. strategic competition with China and other adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this series of reports, the CSIS Scholl Chair will seek to detail and evaluate the design-out and design-around threats as they relate to the Chinese and global semiconductor supply chain. Analysis will focus on four key stages of the semiconductor supply chain. For each stage, findings will highlight (1) the risk of design-out by firms in China and third countries, (2) the potential for design-around solutions, and (3) the effects of these strategies on U.S. economic and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first report provides a brief introduction to the design-out and design-around phenomena and how they have taken shape within China’s government and private sector. It then turns to the packaging segment within semiconductor supply chains, a primary example of the design-around threat. Advanced packaging represents an area of intensive innovation that China has identified as a strategic priority in efforts to undermine the effectiveness of U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In subsequent reports, the Scholl Chair will cover the fields of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and tool subsystems and components, as well as electronic design automation (EDA), chip design, and core design IP. Each report will provide evidence for the design-out and design-around phenomena and evaluate the potential impacts of these Chinese counterstrategies. Ultimately, it is argued that the resulting loss of leverage over the global semiconductor industry is detrimental to U.S. economic and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-evolving-strategy-2018present&quot;&gt;China’s Evolving Strategy, 2018–Present&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic motivation behind both design-out and design-around strategies is a recognition by Chinese policymakers and businesses that U.S. (and allies’) export controls jeopardize China’s critical technology supply chains — and that strategic trade controls are only becoming more common. Such concerns are not new within the highest levels of the Chinese government. Beijing has long been anxious about its reliance on foreign manufacturing for “core technologies,” including semiconductors. Xi Jinping’s election as general secretary in 2013 led to a strengthening of this focus, reflected in the ambitious semiconductor self-sufficiency goals associated with the landmark industrial policy document “Made in China 2025.” Despite these top-down goals, however, Chinese semiconductor companies continued to source key technologies heavily from U.S. and other foreign suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s 2018 restrictions on ZTE — and their implication that U.S. export controls could put a Chinese national technology champion out of business — created newfound urgency behind efforts to wean off U.S. technology. An additional wake-up call was Huawei’s near collapse following its addition to the entity list, which crippled its smartphone business for multiple years. Huawei, alongside Chinese policymakers, made attempts at reshaping domestic technology supply chains to reduce foreign (particularly U.S.) dependencies, investing in new vertical integration efforts and partnerships with local suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important shift, however, came on October 7, 2022. The Biden administration’s new rules under the EAR, which were broader than expected by both Chinese and third-country commercial and government stakeholders, fundamentally changed decisionmaking about U.S. technology within China’s semiconductor industry. Almost overnight, Chinese self-sufficiency targets transformed from top-down, broad objectives to an industry-wide supply chain effort to ensure that the future of China’s semiconductor industry was safe from current and future U.S. restrictions. As an employee of one top U.S. semiconductor company described it, “the October 2022 unilateral regulations poured ‘jet fuel’ on the Chinese innovation economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This series of reports focuses on the key pathways that the Chinese government and businesses have used to pursue this goal of “de-Americanizing” semiconductor supply chains, as well as their consequences for U.S. and global semiconductor markets. In conducting background research, several baseline facts about Chinese semiconductor manufacturing and procurement behavior became apparent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Politics aside, Chinese companies largely prefer to utilize the most advanced semiconductor tools and technologies, most of which are produced in the United States and allied nations. Under normal circumstances (i.e., in the absence of recent export control trends), Chinese firms would likely continue to purchase and utilize U.S. technology in areas where it is industry leading.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;China is aiming in the long term for a semiconductor manufacturing supply chain free of U.S. equipment. Policymakers and business leaders are directing domestic semiconductor firms to find alternatives to U.S. technology. Government entities are also investing heavily in the domestic semiconductor supply chain through subsidies and R&amp;amp;D programs to create substitutes for foreign technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing, relatively successful, government-backed campaign across the Chinese semiconductor industry that urges Chinese companies to buy domestic equipment rather than equipment from foreign suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinese fabs and other semiconductor industry participants will often purchase Chinese technologies that are less technologically advanced than foreign counterparts in order to reduce foreign dependencies and nurture domestic industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When there is not a domestically produced substitute to U.S. technology, Chinese firms will look to procure equipment from companies headquartered in countries with less hawkish economic security policies toward China. Buying new equipment from U.S. companies is often seen as a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In response to U.S. export controls, companies from third countries (i.e., not the United States or China) have actively sought to replace U.S. companies in the Chinese semiconductor supply chain. Some have even used the lack of U.S. regulatory impediments as a sales pitch to Chinese customers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These assertions largely reflect the conclusions of publicly available reporting on China’s semiconductor industry. The clearest available evidence in Chinese policy for these trends is “Document 79” — also known as “Delete A,” for “Delete America” — a highly sensitive strategic plan to rid Chinese digital supply chains of Western technology that has been partially leaked to Western sources. In the weeks before the landmark October 7, 2022, U.S. export controls package, the Chinese leadership privately circulated Document 79. The plan, according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal, incentivizes firms to procure technology from domestic firms even in cases where foreign alternatives are more advanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trends described in the reports on Document 79 are supported by a wide range of sources. They are also taking place across the semiconductor supply chain, from design to manufacturing equipment to packaging. For instance, in semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME), Chinese companies such as Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC) and Naura Technology Group have increasingly won key tenders over U.S. leaders. Within subsystems and components, China is attempting to develop its own extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) light sources and replace foreign suppliers for chemicals, gases, and other materials. In design and electronic design automation (EDA), Chinese startups like Moore Threads and Empyrean Technology are beginning to take some share from U.S. companies. These cases are merely illustrative examples out of a broader set of evidence, as these trends will be explored in detail during each supply chain stage’s report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat that U.S. companies will be designed-out of key parts of the semiconductor supply chain is multifaceted and growing. Design-out efforts are boosting Chinese companies, as policymakers and businesses are attempting to nurture new domestic alternatives. The efforts are also visible in third-country semiconductor industries, where opportunistic non-U.S. firms are seeking to fill the demand gap in China left by newly shunned U.S. firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design-around threats are also continuing to emerge. Chinese innovation leadership can be seen in several portions of the semiconductor supply chain, some of which are outside the reach of export control regulations. Advanced packaging serves as a key example of this trend, but there are other examples of it in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, such as novel attempts to produce leading-edge chips using older lithography and etching tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current U.S. economic security policy may, therefore, inadvertently cause the very thing it was attempting to prevent: the acceleration of leading-edge semiconductor innovation and manufacturing beyond the boundaries of the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this series of reports will cover the Chinese counterstrategies to U.S. export controls in much of the supply chain, this report focuses on advanced packaging. These technologies are a key growth area in chip production today, and they offer a prime case of China’s design-around efforts in practice. Importantly, advanced packaging and its associated capital equipment are (1) less technologically challenging to develop — and less exclusively dominated by the United States and its allies — compared to fabrication technologies like EUV lithography and (2) potential enablers of cutting-edge applications such as AI large language models (LLMs) without the need for advanced chips. While design-out efforts are occurring in some parts of advanced packaging, such as a shift away from U.S. packaging tools and inputs like advanced substrates, this paper will focus on design-around because of its greater impact on the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, U.S. economic security policymakers seeking to keep China from developing cutting-edge technology feel compelled to counter the enabling power of advanced packaging technologies. However, attempts to broadly control these technologies would likely only serve to damage U.S. companies, which lack dominance in the supply chain and operate in the context of a highly competitive global market. Packaging is a clear example of how design-around threatens U.S. technological superiority and must be addressed appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Current U.S. economic security policy may, therefore, inadvertently cause the very thing it was attempting to prevent: the acceleration of leading-edge semiconductor innovation and manufacturing beyond the boundaries of the United States and its allies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper focuses only on packaging services and tools. It does not cover packaging design tools and overall chip design services and IP, nor does it cover physical testing tools used during the packaging process. Packaging design and testing will be covered in the briefs on (1) EDA and chip design and (2) semiconductor manufacturing equipment, respectively. Designing advanced packaging relies on many of the same software tools used in chip design, such as Synopsys and Cadence, and often occurs in concert with, or as part of, chip and manufacturing process design by “fabless,” or design-only, semiconductor firms and foundries. Testing tools, while used in the packaging process, are also important to semiconductor manufacturing and have more similar design-out and design-around dynamics to semiconductor tools used in areas like etching and process control. For these reasons, these technologies and companies are not covered here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-of-advanced-packaging-technologies&quot;&gt;The Rise of Advanced Packaging Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background-chasing-moores-law&quot;&gt;Background: Chasing Moore’s Law&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the infancy of semiconductor technology, chip manufacturers have pursued the twin goals of greater computing power and efficiency. These goals have, for decades, been achieved by increasing the number of transistors on a chip, primarily via component miniaturization. Moore’s Law — an observation made by Intel cofounder Gordon Moore in 1965 — predicted that the number of transistors that manufacturers could fit onto an integrated circuit would double every two years. Researchers and engineers sought to continually invent ways to put more and more transistors on a chip while optimizing the key tradeoffs between power (P) vs. performance (P) as well as a chip’s area (A) vs. its cost (C), a paradigm collectively known as PPAC. For most of the semiconductor industry’s history, the winning strategy was continually shrinking transistor sizes. For each successive generation of chip, node names (e.g., “50 nanometers”) referred to the actual size of a chip’s smallest feature — typically its gate length — which was decreasing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in recent years, transistor size has been shrinking at a slower rate than in the past, calling into question the durability of Moore’s Law and increasing the need for alternative strategies to boost computing power and efficiency. Around the late 2000s, leading-edge node names stopped signifying a chip’s exact minimum feature size. Instead, node names began symbolizing total increases in transistor density, which were being enabled less by shrinking transistor sizes than by new methods such as feature depopulation and reductions in space between transistors. However, even these new methods have at times struggled to sustain the pace predicted by Moore’s Law in the last decade, and ballooning capital costs to boost transistor density have challenged the economic corollary often associated with Moore’s Law, which says that cost per transistor is inversely proportional to the number of transistors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-rise-of-advanced-packaging&quot;&gt;The Rise of Advanced Packaging&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced packaging has emerged as a promising alternative to both boost transistor density and scale processing power and efficiency in other ways — particularly as a more capital-efficient alternative compared to investing in changes at the transistor level. The architectures and materials used to connect different chips to each other and the printed circuit board (PCB) can be as important in optimizing PPAC as transistor architecture itself, representing a key opportunity. For instance, the density of interconnects between memory and logic units within a chip package has historically been a communication bottleneck that has lagged the growth of transistor density.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous decades, semiconductor packaging was often regarded as a somewhat commoditized last step in an otherwise highly advanced chip fabrication process. The function of packaging has traditionally been to isolate the chip from other components and keep it connected to the PCB. The PCB, in traditional applications, is responsible for transferring power and information between chips and other circuit components. Conventional packaging is a low-value step in the manufacturing process, and it has historically been outsourced to third-party firms — often located in countries with lower labor costs — that specialize in packaging and testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced packaging design, on the other hand, is a newer field seeking to arrange the components of a chip and its interconnecting parts in ways that improve input/output (I/O), reduce latency (the delay period between when a computing instruction is given and when data begins transferring), and increase power efficiency. As such, it incorporates wholly different processes and technologies than traditional packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, advanced packaging occurs during both upstream and downstream manufacturing processes. Traditional packaging is an entirely back-end process, occurring downstream, typically executed by an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) vendor. This outsourcing existed because packaging was lower margin relative to front-end manufacturing due to its commoditized nature, with OSATs competing primarily on cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced packaging, on the other hand, is moving much of the packaging process farther upstream. New, innovative methods are changing the way in which foundries prepare chips during fabrication, such as logic and memory fabs collaborating to make their chips integrate seamlessly in the final package. To build advanced packaging architectures, certain technologies and methods need to be integrated throughout the front-end wafer fabrication process, creating opportunities for chip manufacturers to increase their share of industry value-added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chiplets-and-heterogeneous-integration&quot;&gt;“Chiplets” and Heterogeneous Integration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One particularly important advanced packaging innovation is “chiplet” design, which brings multiple chips with discrete functions into a singular packaged unit. The packaging methods used to bring chiplet designs to life — referred to as heterogeneous integration — have the potential to enable greater power efficiency, faster data transfer rates, and lower signal degradation relative to conventional packaging methods. One major advantage of chiplet design is flexibility in terms of serving different applications. Semiconductor components that interact often in a system can be placed in greater proximity, reducing latency and power demands. For AI computations, for instance, which rely heavily on memory functions, bringing a memory chiplet closer to the processing core has proven to be a powerful design solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, chiplet technology can be used to create microelectronic systems that perform like those containing leading-edge semiconductors — without any access to the advanced manufacturing technology required to make such chips. Chiplets have therefore become a serious concern for U.S. policymakers seeking to curb the advancement of Chinese technology, as cutting-edge chipmaking tools, such as EUV lithography, represent the key “chokepoints” used to deny China access to advanced semiconductor capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;imposing-export-controls-on-advanced-packaging&quot;&gt;Imposing Export Controls on Advanced Packaging&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters more challenging for U.S. regulators, advanced packaging is, for the most part, enabled by widely available equipment and materials. Unlike semiconductor fabrication, which occurs on the nanometer level (one billionth of a meter) and requires highly sophisticated equipment at every step, advanced packaging processes are typically measured on the micron level (one thousand times larger). While some specialized machinery is required to build advanced-packaged semiconductors, most tools are less technologically niche and challenging to develop in comparison to fabrication. Furthermore, the supply chain for equipment and materials used in advanced packaging involves Chinese companies and has greater supplier diversification compared to SME or chip design, making potential unilateral, bilateral, or trilateral agreements less effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, a couple of hard-to-acquire inputs and technologies that enable advanced packaging and are worth covering specifically: hybrid bonding and advanced substrates. Each of these technologies enables firms to create advanced chip packages that perform well above their traditionally packaged counterparts, even for similar process nodes at the underlying chip level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HYBRID BONDING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most impactful technology propelling advanced packaging innovation is hybrid bonding. Hybrid bonding, in short, is a method used to vertically connect fabricated semiconductor wafers (commonly referred to as “dies,” “die,” or “dice” once they are cut into individual chips) using closely spaced copper pads, creating an exceptionally short interconnect distance between discrete chips. Importantly, hybrid bonding enables advanced “3D” stacking of wafers, which is expected to play a key role in future Moore’s Law advancements in power and performance. The utilization of hybrid bonding can dramatically increase the performance of a given chip package. Without advancing the process nodes of the underlying semiconductors, computing efficiency can be greatly increased, enabling various leading-edge applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid bonding can be done in one of two ways: wafer-on-wafer (W2W) or die-on-wafer (D2W). In W2W bonding, wafers are stacked on top of one another, and the stack is diced upon finishing. In D2W bonding, wafers are diced into individual chiplets before stacked. Both methods require specialized manufacturing equipment such as die attach and laser dicing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OEo99Df.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;

Khan, “The Semiconductor Supply Chain,” Center for Security and Emerging Technology, January 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besi, a Dutch company specializing in tools for advanced packaging, is a major player in hybrid bonding. According to company data, Besi holds 40 percent of the total global market for “die attach” and 74 percent of the total global market for “advanced die placement.” Both technologies are critical components of D2W hybrid bonding operations. Besi’s major competitors include two Singapore-based companies, ASMPT and Kulicke &amp;amp; Soffa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid bonding processes are for the most part executed in fabs rather than OSATs. Key companies developing hybrid bonding capabilities include leading chip manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Samsung, Intel, and SK hynix — as well as Chinese companies such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and Yangtze Memory Technologies Corporation (YMTC). But in terms of existing scaled production, hybrid bonding is limited to a handful of AMD chiplets produced by TSMC, and certain 3D memory chips. Key breakthroughs are expected in the next five years, such as TSMC’s 3D-stacked system-on-integrated chip (SOIC) packaging, which is expected to reach the market in 2027. This design builds on TSMC’s leading chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) process — a “2.5-D” package one step below hybrid bonding in terms of advancement — which has already proven critical for AI data center applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADVANCED SUBSTRATES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A substrate serves two main purposes in the manufacturing and packaging of a chip. First, a substrate is the basic surface on which microfabrication takes place. Second, and more important for the purposes of advanced packaging, a substrate serves as the connecting point between the “brains” and the “electrical highways” of a chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computing operations of a chip occur on the die, in essence the “brains” of the chip. When in operation, information comes in from the printed circuit board (the “electrical highway”), through the substrate, and onto the die, where a computing operation is performed. Then, the processed information leaves the die by passing back through the substrate and returning to the printed circuit board for further transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of chip capabilities and growth of specialized applications such as 5G infrastructure, aerospace and defense, high-performance computing, and electric vehicles (EVs) increases demand for semiconductors that can withstand high signal frequency, heat, and data throughput requirements. Advanced substrates are often uniquely able to achieve desired high-performance capabilities under these types of conditions. Therefore, chip packages based on advanced substrates such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN), and silicon carbide (SiC) are growing in importance. The latter two on this list are considered “wide-bandgap” semiconductors, which can operate at higher voltages, temperatures, and frequencies relative to traditional semiconductors and play a key role in the production of various renewable energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current advanced substrate supply chain runs primarily through three geographies: Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. Combined, companies in these three countries are responsible for 88 percent of global advanced substrate revenues. Taiwan in particular holds a strong share in advanced substrate production, led by companies such as Unimicron, NanYa PCB, and Kinsus. China, however, has ambitions to expand with newer players such as Shennan Circuits and Access. China’s growing investment in the advanced substrate market has the potential to shift market share away from the current leaders. The United States, building off government subsidies under the CHIPS and Science Act, also hopes to gain a foothold in the market, although its share remains small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;designing-around-us-export-controls-via-advanced-packaging&quot;&gt;Designing Around U.S. Export Controls via Advanced Packaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advanced packaging technologies provide a key opportunity for Chinese government officials and companies to design around U.S. export controls on advanced chips and pursue performance gains via noncontrolled technologies. In these efforts, Chinese companies have a moderate incumbency advantage due to their strong market positioning in conventional semiconductor packaging. While the global packaging market is more geographically distributed than semiconductor industry segments like chip design and fabrication, China is the global leader, controlling 38 percent of total assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP) value-added activity. Key Chinese outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) companies include Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Tech ( JCET) and Tongfu Microelectronics, both of which have historically provided low-cost partnerships to key foreign foundries for ATP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-volume packaging facilities for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers such as Intel, GlobalFoundries, and Onsemi are located inside China, indicating that packaging technology and expertise are likely widely available in the country. As of 2021, for instance, China was home to 111 ATP facilities for OSATs and 23 facilities for integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), 28 percent of all global facilities (regardless of firm headquarters). Additionally, China holds stronger shares in manufacturing packaging equipment relative to other types of semiconductor tools, giving it some experience with producing required tools such as die attach and bonding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging its conventional packaging capacity to build out an advanced packaging ecosystem offers a key opportunity to get around U.S. export controls, and this is indeed what China has begun doing. Chinese OSATs have increasingly pivoted toward advanced back-end processes such as chiplets over the past few years. In conjunction with its private sector, the Chinese government is also subsidizing advanced packaging research. In August 2023, for example, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology announced it would fund up to 30 chiplet-based projects, making over $6.4 million available for research. This is also happening at the local level: in 2023, the city of Wuxi — home to JCET and other Chinese packaging firms — made a pledge to invest $14 million to create a Chinese “Chiplet Valley,” a nod to Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese foundries and chip designers are working to incorporate advanced packaging methods into their semiconductor manufacturing operations. To this end, Huawei, through its subsidiary HiSilicon, has already launched partnerships with packaging equipment vendor JT Automation and wafer probe card startup MaxOne Semiconductor, in addition to securing hundreds of patents. In 2022, Huawei and HiSilicon began innovating with 3D chip stacking designs, an advanced process involving vertical integration of multiple wafer dies into a single package, in an attempt to design around U.S. sanctions. A 2019 patent filing reveals a sophisticated design that makes use of two chips, stacked on top of one another, but only partially overlapping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMIC, the most advanced of China’s foundries, has called for other Chinese companies to embrace advanced packaging since 2021. SMIC often partners with Huawei to develop chips (including packaging), recently doing so to develop the 7 nanometer (nm) Kirin 9000s for the Huawei Mate 60 Pro smartphone. JCET also recently confirmed its ability to offer packaging capabilities for 5nm manufacturing processes, linking the OSAT with SMIC’s reported efforts to achieve 5nm process production at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YMTC is yet another Chinese entity trying to design around U.S. regulations using advanced packaging. In 2022, YMTC, which is the top Chinese chipmaker for NAND flash memory — a type of semiconductor that stores data without using power, commonly used in memory cards and solid-state drives — employed advanced packaging processes to develop a world-leading memory chip. With different architectures from logic chips, memory chips are measured in the number of layers produced in their manufacturing processes. U.S. export controls prevent the export to China of NAND chips with 128 layers or higher. YMTC’s 2022 NAND process produced memory chips with 232 layers, making the firm the first to break the 200-layer milestone. Additionally, the package architecture — called Xtacking — uses hybrid bonding, an advanced packaging process hallmark, demonstrating China’s commitment to utilizing packaging as a means of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the YMTC 232-layer memory chip attracted the attention of customers beyond the domestic market. In fact, the U.S.-based technology giant Apple planned to use YMTC memory chips in its sold-in-China iPhones in 2022. While the company canceled this plan shortly after the October 2022 U.S. export controls took effect, the episode nonetheless provides an example of the potential global appeal of Chinese advanced packaging technologies. Some analysts have gone as far as to argue that cheaply produced, advanced-packed chips originating from China have serious export potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most alarming example of Chinese companies leveraging advanced packaging to design around U.S. controls is the Jasminer X4, a cryptocurrency mining chip that successfully made use of DRAM-to-logic hybrid bonding, a package that involves stacking advanced logic chips on memory chips to boost performance and lower energy demand. While most non-monolithic designs (i.e., packages combining different types of chips) from Chinese companies have been theoretical, the Jasminer X4 is a case of heterogeneous integration in practice. In fact, this is the first demonstrated commercial use of DRAM-to-logic hybrid bonding — a niche heterogeneous integration application that illustrates the ability of Chinese engineers to work around U.S. regulations to manufacture high-performance chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The YMTC and Jasminer examples should be a warning sign for regulators in Washington. U.S. export controls, which incentivized the design-around counterstrategy, may well have created a generation of Chinese innovators that seek to push the boundaries of semiconductor technology via advanced packaging. Chinese companies, rather than copying the cutting edge as was seen during the “sliding scale” era of U.S. export control policy, are forced to invent new technologies to design around U.S. regulations. This implicit cultural shift in Chinese commercial goals, from copying to innovation, is a potential sea change in U.S.-China technological competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China has invested heavily into the chiplet ecosystem, it is worth noting that few chiplet designs have been made into physical products, and scaled production remains an obstacle. A key challenge, as with any new semiconductor manufacturing process, will be achieving high yields in production. However, some industry analysts believe that Chinese firms are perhaps just one to three years away from achieving the wide adoption of heterogeneous integration processes. Chinese companies, including scaled firms and startups, as well as public officials have widely highlighted the promise of advanced packaging — particularly chiplets — as a way around U.S. export controls. One key factor is that the United States does not have significant incumbent advantages in the packaging space, so China is in a strong position to match (or even overtake) U.S. capabilities more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This implicit cultural shift in Chinese commercial goals, from copying to innovation, is a potential sea change in U.S.-China technological competition.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a macro level, aggressive U.S. economic security measures — through their impacts on the expansion of Chinese semiconductor innovation — have the potential to harm the very industry leadership they are designed to protect. Chinese advancements in the packaging space present medium- and long-term challenges for U.S. semiconductor companies. Unintentionally, U.S. export restrictions have galvanized Chinese companies to invent novel technologies that threaten the balance of global competition in semiconductor markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;designing-out-us-firms-in-advanced-packaging&quot;&gt;Designing Out U.S. Firms in Advanced Packaging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence of U.S. firms being designed-out of the Chinese advanced packaging market is more limited compared to design-around innovations. It requires U.S. companies to occupy leading market share positions in the advanced packaging supply chain, which is less common relative to segments of the semiconductor industry (e.g., tools, design). The strongest example of this taking place is in the advanced substrate market — in particular, silicon carbide (SiC) wafer substrates, which are the foundation of wide-bandgap power electronics semiconductors used in EVs. Despite not being directly affected by the export controls, SiC substrates provide an example of how Chinese decoupling from U.S. semiconductor inputs is affecting technology areas outside of leading-edge chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies — particularly Wolfspeed and Coherent — along with Japan’s SiCrystal, together hold a dominant share of the global SiC wafer market today. North Carolina-based Wolfspeed alone controlled more than 60 percent of the market as of 2021 and pioneered the industry’s transition to eight-inch wafers, a key technological breakthrough. SiC-based chips have taken on increased importance within the automotive industry due to their performance benefits compared to silicon wafers in inverters for EVs. China’s rapidly growing EV manufacturing capacity represents a key market for SiC wafers for U.S. and third-country firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has targeted expansion in the SiC market for many years (SiC was mentioned in China’s 14th Five-Year Plan, indicating plans for government support), but its efforts have recently accelerated. A key focus has been on developing public-private research partnerships with key universities such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has helped China become a leader in SiC patent filing. At the same time, large private capital investments by EV giants such as BYD and Nio have propelled the growth of emerging Chinese players such as TanKeBlue, SICC, and Sanan. Projections by the semiconductor research firm Yole Group indicate that SiC production within China could see substantial increases in the coming years: 2021 production levels of SiC wafers stood at 0.18 million wafers, whereas 2026 forecasts predict an increase to 3.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S. firms have retained their large leadership so far in terms of SiC market share, the rise of Chinese competitors, facilitated by government support, is expected to create increased challenges going forward. China also has advantages from its leadership in EV manufacturing and integrating SiC-based packages into power electronics systems, providing a strong source of demand and technological knowledge that enables innovative partnerships with domestic SiC substrate suppliers. Overall, this design-out example showcases how China is taking a “whole-of-supply-chain” approach to replacing semiconductor technologies from the United States and its allies, one that has only accelerated following the October 2022 export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;the-state-of-advanced-packaging-today&quot;&gt;The State of Advanced Packaging Today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semiconductor advanced packaging market is at a critical juncture. While Chinese policymakers and companies are prioritizing packaging innovation and have made key strides, similar efforts are playing out in the United States and around the world. They include increased private sector R&amp;amp;D focused on areas like chiplets and advanced substrates as well as industrial policy investments, such as the CHIPS Act in the United States. As discussed, China has some existing advantages — namely, large domestic conventional packaging capacity and leadership in downstream applications manufacturing for wide-bandgap semiconductors such as EVs and solar panels. That said, China does not hold all the cards in terms of developing advanced packaging, and its long-term leadership in the sector is by no means guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan is currently considered the global leader in advanced packaging, primarily due to TSMC’s leading CoWoS product as well as Taiwan’s important domestic ecosystem of equipment and packaging materials suppliers. TSMC’s capabilities depend on close collaboration in system design with U.S. fabless firms such as Nvidia and AMD (which will be discussed in greater detail in a future paper on design), whose Hopper H200 and Ryzen-16 core packages, respectively, are key market leaders. In terms of OSAT competition, the United States’ Amkor and Taiwan’s ASE retain the technological edge over China’s JCET and Tongfu in terms of advanced packaging. Key OSATs are also increasingly shifting production away from China to geographies like Southeast Asia amid rising U.S.-China tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, China’s recent progress in advanced packaging should not be taken lightly. There is broad consensus among Chinese and foreign observers that U.S. export restrictions have accelerated the timeline of innovation in China’s advanced packaging ecosystem. Chinese investments into advanced packaging are significant and reflect the high level of government prioritization for the area, which was identified as a Chinese opportunity to surpass the United States even prior to October 2022. Most importantly, the United States and China are working from a similar “starting line” with respect to packaging, unlike most of the rest of the semiconductor ecosystem. The extent to which either country can achieve packaging industry leadership longer term will likely depend closely on effective coordination between a wide range of players, including OSATs, IDMs, designers and EDA firms, foundries, and original equipment manufacturers. In this respect, the increasingly close collaboration across China’s entire semiconductor (and electronics manufacturing) ecosystem in response to U.S. controls may present another possible Chinese advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is broad consensus among Chinese and foreign observers that U.S. export restrictions have accelerated the timeline of innovation in China’s advanced packaging ecosystem.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether future advancements in the semiconductor industry will be driven primarily by transistor density or changes in systemic complexity such as advanced packaging innovations. Areas such as EUV lithography — access to which is controlled by the United States and its allies — are likely to remain important to PPAC improvements, meaning that the ability of U.S. companies to use these technologies still confers advantages in the overall chip race against China, which is still struggling to develop domestic alternatives. However, the combination of advanced packaging capabilities and advanced fabrication tools represents the most promising way for the United States and its allies to maintain semiconductor leadership. For this reason, the United States cannot afford to let China run away with leadership in advanced packaging, even if it continues to lead in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ new approach to semiconductor export controls attempts to grow its technological lead to the greatest extent possible, rather than simply remaining one step ahead of adversaries. This strategy has produced a range of countermoves from Beijing, including design-out and design-around efforts. Both have the potential to severely impact the U.S. chip ecosystem in the long term. This paper has focused on advanced packaging, which offers China’s semiconductor industry a rare opportunity to leverage preexisting advantages in a supply chain segment to avoid using U.S. and allies’ chipmaking technologies and leapfrog ahead in innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New export controls focused on advanced packaging technologies, which have reportedly been under consideration, would likely do little to solve this issue due to the previously mentioned challenges of lower industry barriers to entry than chipmaking equipment, a widely distributed global supply chain, and the extent of existing Chinese facilities and know-how. In fact, controls would potentially hurt U.S. industry players seeking to grow in advanced packaging more than they would hobble Chinese competitors. The most effective direct U.S. responses to Chinese packaging advancements therefore likely lie in the “promote” side of economic security rather than “protect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the low margins and labor intensity of packaging traditionally made U.S. investment unattractive, these factors are evolving as the value added by advanced packaging increases and plant automation expands. A promising government effort to drive U.S. packaging growth is the National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP), a National Institute of Standards and Technology initiative under the CHIPS Act that will invest $1.6 billion in funding innovation across five packaging R&amp;amp;D areas, including chiplets. Another CSIS paper outlines potential strategies to further boost these efforts, including permitting process changes to develop manufacturing sites, workforce development initiatives, and further public-private partnerships. While increased onshoring of packaging technologies will likely not lead to the United States controlling key chokepoints in the packaging space, it can mitigate the risk of domestic and allied firms being supplanted by superior Chinese packaging technologies. This would also prevent Chinese firms locking in future packaging leadership by leading the global setting of protocol and technology standards in advanced packaging, which will likely shape advanced packaging technology adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s primary goals — and its already-realized achievements — in advanced packaging are designing around U.S. controls on advanced chips and associated manufacturing equipment. Investments in areas like chiplets may soon enable a range of Chinese electronics systems with processing, power, and cost capabilities that were once only possible using leading-edge lithography tools and inputs — technologies developed and largely controlled by the United States and its allies. The United States, itself not a key leader in packaging, has been unable to meaningfully slow China’s rise in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A potential policy shift on a broader level would be to return to the sliding scale approach to semiconductor export controls. This approach disincentivized countries of concern to invest tremendous amounts of time and money into their own capabilities in attempts to surpass the United States and its allies. Sliding scale strategies kept adversaries behind by letting them consistently access new capabilities — albeit capabilities one or two generations behind the United States. The new U.S. “hard ceiling” approach to export controls incentivizes affected countries and companies to innovate away from their dependencies on U.S. and allied inputs. To be fair, the shift is not quite so clear cut for China. The country has long sought to become more technologically independent — even before the U.S. and its allies tightened their economic security rules. The hard ceiling imposed by export controls over the last two years, however, undeniably brought Chinese efforts to a new scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The new U.S. “hard ceiling” approach to export controls incentivizes affected countries and companies to innovate away from their dependencies on U.S. and allied inputs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A move back to the old sliding scale approach may not be politically feasible, however — and more importantly, it likely would not reverse the damage done to U.S. industry interests. The most notable impact of the current export controls is not China’s newfound homegrown capabilities in advanced packaging. Rather, it is the shift in the Chinese industry and government mindset that foreign inputs — particularly U.S. inputs — are no longer reliable because their supply is not secure. The growing U.S. conflation of economic and national security means that leading-edge critical goods are always liable to be controlled, making them less attractive to Chinese buyers. De-controlling items related to CETs to adjust policy gaps may, therefore, be too little, too late in terms of reversing Chinese design-out and design-around efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea that “the ship has sailed” should not be used either as a reason to surrender to Chinese ambitions or as an excuse to expand controls on mature and foundational technologies, such as legacy chips, packaging, or any semiconductor technology with substantial foreign capacity. Such controls would strangle domestic industry, overwhelm BIS capabilities, and exacerbate the Chinese mindset shift related to CETs. Alternative strategies to reduce impacts on U.S. businesses will be discussed in greater detail in a report on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and include greater multilateralization of semiconductor export controls, which may require a narrower focus on certain “chokepoint” technologies and the exclusion of areas such as memory chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, policymakers can redouble efforts to make up for the inevitable losses the U.S. industry will be facing due to design-out and design-around, such as how China’s development of advanced packaging may lead to reduced purchases of U.S. capital equipment and chips. These efforts should include, for instance, greater cooperation between the United States and its partners and allies to coordinate state-led investments as well as efforts such as manufacturing expansions and joint R&amp;amp;D projects. These efforts could also include a more ambitious trade policy to ensure that U.S. firms have access to more customers globally, which could help offset lost commercial opportunities within China.&lt;/p&gt;

The number of violent incidents related to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict increased 4.5 times in the last week of September from the weekly average between October 7, 2023, and August 31, 2024. In addition, the attacks are targeting a much larger geographic area. Israeli and Hezbollah attacks struck an average of 27–28 km from the Blue Line in the last week of September, up from an average of about 3–4 km between October 7, 2023, and August 31, 2024. The number of strikes and the geography of the conflict are likely to grow and include a larger swath of Lebanon and Israel as well as potentially Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah continue to escalate in what Israel has called Operation Northern Arrows. In mid-September 2024, Israeli intelligence sabotaged thousands of Hezbollah beepers and walkie-talkies, detonating them in an operation that killed dozens of group members and wounded thousands more. On September 27, 2024, Israel killed Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on the group’s Beirut headquarters — the culmination of a campaign against Hezbollah’s leaders that led to the killing of numerous senior group leaders in September 2024. Two days before the Nasrallah assassination, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, chief of the general staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), told Israeli troops from the Seventh Brigade deployed along the northern border, “We are preparing the process of a manoeuvre, which means your military boots . . . will enter enemy territory.” The IDF also called up two reserve brigades for what it referred to as “operational missions in the northern arena.” Israeli commandoes have conducted cross-border operations to gather intelligence and otherwise prepare for a ground invasion, and Israel has done limited operations so far in southern Lebanon. Iran responded by launching waves of ballistic missiles and other stand-off weapons at Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the prospect of further escalation, this brief asks four questions: What are Israel’s and Hezbollah’s objectives? How has violence evolved over the past several months? What are plausible scenarios for further escalation? What options do the United States and other countries have to mitigate or prevent escalation? To answer these questions, this analysis draws on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative information. It compiles data on Israeli and Hezbollah strikes along the Israel-Lebanon-Syria border and geolocates Hezbollah attacks against Israel in the demilitarized zone between the Blue Line and Litani River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data show the increased scope and scale of Israeli and Hezbollah operations in recent months. Although most strikes by both sides have been within a relatively narrow area along the Israel-Lebanon border, the nature of the limited war between Hezbollah, Iran, and Israel is rapidly changing. Israel has escalated the number of strikes and the depth of its targeting. Hezbollah too has increased strikes, though in a far more limited way than Israel. And Iran has become directly involved in the conflict by firing ballistic missiles at Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing risk, an all-out war is not inevitable. Israeli attacks might successfully coerce Hezbollah to accept a ceasefire and move forces away from the border, or they might significantly weaken Hezbollah’s capabilities to strike Israel. But if negotiations fail to establish a buffer zone along the Israel-Lebanon border, there is a heightened possibility of all-out war. Escalation could lead to significant casualties for both Hezbollah and the Israeli military, put Israeli civilians throughout the country at risk, lead to hundreds and perhaps thousands of Lebanese civilian casualties, and spread to Iran, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore the implications of escalation, the rest of this brief is divided into four sections. The first examines likely Israeli and Hezbollah objectives. The second assesses the evolution of violence. The third explores plausible scenarios of further escalation, and the fourth explores U.S. policy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategic-objectives&quot;&gt;Strategic Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the 1979 Iranian revolution, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) helped establish Lebanese Hezbollah and provided money, equipment, training, and strategic guidance to the fledgling Shia organization. In addition, Iran sent as many as 1,500 IRGC advisers to the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon to build and run training camps that prepared Hezbollah fighters for war with Israel. Hezbollah played a major role in Israel’s 1985 decision to withdraw to a buffer zone on the Lebanese border and its 2000 decision to withdraw from Lebanon completely. Hezbollah, since its establishment, has defined itself in opposition to Israel. Its main objectives have been to drive Israel out of Lebanon and, ultimately, to destroy the state of Israel. In the 1980s and 1990s, Israel and Hezbollah regularly attacked each other despite the presence of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) along the Israel-Lebanon border, which is typically known as the Blue Line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Israel withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah continued occasional attacks on Israel and conducted a series of attacks against Israeli interests and citizens across the globe. This limited conflict flared into an all-out war in 2006 after a Hezbollah cross-border kidnapping operation. The war left over 100 Israelis and around 500 Hezbollah fighters dead and devastated Lebanon. The 2006 war ended with United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1701. Among other measures, UNSCR 1701 created a demilitarized zone between the Blue Line and Litani River along the borders of Israel, Lebanon, and Syria (Figure 1). Weapons and fighters that did not belong to the Lebanese government or the United Nations (i.e., those of Hezbollah) could not pass south of the Litani River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pZR3hLc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: UNSCR 1701 Zone in Southern Lebanon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2006, an uneasy status quo prevailed. Israel occasionally attacked Hezbollah fighters, and Iranian arms shipments headed to Hezbollah and other groups in Syria. There were intermittent rockets and drones and other standoff attacks across the border. For the most part, however, the border was the calmest it had been in decades. Another area of dispute was the village of Ghajar, just west of Shebaa Farms and bisected by the Israel-Lebanon border. Its residents have both Lebanese and Israeli citizenship. For years, a fence divided Ghajar, but in 2006 Israeli forces reoccupied the entire village and today retain control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, however, several factors have changed the dynamics between Israel, Hezbollah, and Iran. First, the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel dramatically increased Israeli insecurity and took a psychological toll on Israelis. Israel’s risk tolerance significantly changed. If Hamas could kill over 1,100 Israelis in a surprise cross-border operation, what could a much better organized, armed, and trained Hezbollah do? Hezbollah’s close relationship with Iran and ties to Hamas reinforced this fear. Second, the repercussions of the October 7 attack and clashes between Hezbollah and Israel displaced more than 150,000 people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border after October 2023, including over 62,000 civilians from northern Israel and more than 92,000 from southern Lebanon. The continuing displacement has put pressure on Israeli leaders to contain the Hezbollah threat to northern Israel so that residents can return. Third, Hezbollah has dramatically improved its military and stockpiled more than 150,000 standoff weapons in Lebanon and Syria. With Iranian partner and proxy forces active in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and other countries across the region, the threat from the north could get worse over time, not better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these changes, Israeli leaders likely have several main objectives. The first is to curb the Hezbollah threat to Israel by seriously degrading Hezbollah’s military capacity and deterring further actions against Israel. As Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant remarked, a key Israeli goal is “destroying Hezbollah’s capabilities that have been built up over 20 years,” including “disarming entire units of the Radwan force and leaving Nasrallah alone at the top of Hezbollah.” As the Nasrallah killing, beeper operation, large-scale air attacks, and ground operations showed, Israel is increasingly shifting from a traditional deterrent approach of threatening punishment to one of weakening Hezbollah’s capabilities to the point that the group cannot effectively respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah has repeatedly fired anti-tank guided munitions (ATGMs), rockets, drones, missiles, and other standoff weapons at Israeli military and civilian targets from south of the Litani River and other locations in Lebanon. Figure 2 displays possible launch areas for Hezbollah ATGM attacks based on geolocated footage of ATGM impacts shown in Hezbollah propaganda videos. These attacks are a clear violation of UNSCR 1701. Hezbollah’s elite Radwan forces have also been deployed along the border. Thanks to Iranian assistance, Hezbollah possesses as many as 200,000 standoff weapons, including short- and long-range unguided rockets, short- and intermediate-range unguided ballistic missiles, and short- and medium-range guided ballistic missiles such as the Fateh-110/M-600 and Qadr-1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/a54ELh1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Assessed Areas of Hezbollah ATGM Team Operations (October 7, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second Israeli objective is to resettle Israel’s internally displaced population back to their homes and villages in northern Israel. Doing this requires establishing and sustaining a security environment that currently does not exist. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated it would be impossible to return Israeli civilians to their homes without a “fundamental change in the security situation in the north,” an attitude that appears to be driving Israel’s recent escalation. Defense Minister Gallant added, “We will continue with additional blows that are already prepared until we achieve our goal — the return of the residents of the north to their homes, to achieve the goal we are willing to take any action.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;escalating-violence&quot;&gt;Escalating Violence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The escalation of violence in late September far surpasses any other phase of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. After conducting an average of about 160 attacks each week for the 11 months following October 7, Israel struck Lebanon more than 300 times in the week of September 15 and more than 700 times in the week of September 22 (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yKnCJZ6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Violent Incidents Related to the Israel-Hezbollah Conflict (October 8, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even before Israel commenced Operation Northern Arrows in September, there were indications the conflict was entering a new phase. The number of violent incidents related to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict fluctuated between 150 and 250 incidents each week between October 7, 2023, and August 18, 2024. But late August saw the number of incidents rise past 280 per week, with Israeli attacks driving most of the increase. Another sign was an increase in Israeli warplanes conducting threatening overflights over Lebanon (Figure 4). Before summer 2024, these incidents were extremely rare, but Israel sent warplanes over Lebanese cities with increasing frequency throughout the summer, frequently breaking the sound barrier in what now seems to be an implicit threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5fGtoXh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Recorded Israeli Overflights of Lebanon (December 31, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summer, most of the violence took place in the vicinity of the Blue Line (Figure 5). Hezbollah and Israel have traded artillery, ATGM, and air and drone strikes across the border almost daily since October. Before the beginning of Operation Northern Arrows, the fighting displaced roughly 60,000 Israelis and 110,000 Lebanese. The fighting has resulted in a major increase in displacement and death since the beginning of Operation Northern Arrows, with Lebanese authorities reporting that more than 90,000 people were displaced and 600 were killed between September 24 and September 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hAyt9V8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Violent Incidents Related to the Israel-Hezbollah Conflict (October 8, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The violence has not remained limited to southern Lebanon or northern Israel; it has expanded deeper into both countries. Israel has conducted long-range strikes into Lebanon since early 2024, and both the frequency and depth of these strikes have increased over time (Figure 6). Between October 7, 2023, and August 31, 2024, the average Israeli strike occurred about 4 km into Lebanon. In the first three weeks of September, the average depth of an Israeli strike was approximately 6 km. During the week of September 22, the average depth of an Israeli strike was 27 km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highest-profile deep strikes have been the assassinations of Hezbollah leaders in Beirut, but the IDF has also repeatedly attacked Hezbollah’s logistics and air defense infrastructures. The IDF does not appear to be limiting its deep strikes to symbolically or politically important targets but seems to have been engaged in a campaign to degrade Hezbollah’s ability to supply and protect its forces throughout Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite promises by Hezbollah and Iranian leaders to escalate in response to Israeli deep strikes, Hezbollah’s success has been mixed. As shown in Figure 7, Hezbollah attacks have reached deep into Israel on far fewer occasions than Israel has struck deep into Lebanon. This may be, in part, due to the efficacy of Israeli air defenses like Iron Dome and David’s Sling, but Hezbollah restraint and Israeli deterrence have played a role. For more than a decade, Hezbollah has possessed standoff weapons capable of striking all of Israel, but it has not appeared to use them in response to any of Israel’s deep strikes, generally retaliating with an increase in short-range rocket or ATGM fire into northern Israel. Hezbollah has also kept its rocket attacks small relative to its total launch capacity, which is frequently estimated to be more than 1,500 rockets per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 7: Violent Incidents in Israel by Distance from the Blue Line (October 8, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah has, however, managed to escalate the depth of its attacks, if not their number. As shown in Figure 8, the average depth of Israeli and Hezbollah attacks has moved roughly in parallel since October 7. Between October 7, 2023, and August 18, 2024, the average Hezbollah strike occurred about 3 km into Israel. Between August 18 and the beginning of September, the average depth of a Hezbollah strike was approximately 4 km. During the week of September 22, the average depth of a Hezbollah strike was 28 km. Hezbollah has conducted far fewer attacks than Israel since the beginning of Operation Northern Arrows, probably due to the pressure created by Israel’s recent killings of Hezbollah leadership, penetration of the group’s communications, and bombing of rocket and missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lkmGq7b.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 8: Average Distance from the Blue Line of Violent Incidents in Israel and Lebanon (October 8, 2023 - September 29, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah has recently escalated its long-range attacks with a September 25 missile attack that apparently targeted the headquarters of Mossad, Israel’s main external intelligence agency, near Tel Aviv. Although Israeli air defense systems intercepted the attack, Hezbollah signaled that it is willing target Israel’s largest city. But the attack has not yet developed into a campaign of long-range strikes against Israel, possibly because of the amount of pressure from Israel’s recent killings of Hezbollah leadership, penetration of the group’s communications systems, and bombing of rocket and missile systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conflict underwent a further escalation on October 1, when Iran launched about 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. The attack marked only the second direct attack on Israel launched from Iranian territory. Israel’s response remains uncertain; it responded to Iran’s previous missile attack with an implicit threat to destroy Iranian nuclear infrastructure. The region is currently teetering on the brink of all-out war. More direct attacks between Israel and Iran will probably push it over the edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scenarios-for-escalation&quot;&gt;Scenarios for Escalation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the escalating violence, this section examines three scenarios for further escalation: an Israeli ground invasion, a coercive Israeli air war, and a major Hezbollah escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ground-invasion&quot;&gt;Ground Invasion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel might conduct a major and sustained ground incursion into southern Lebanon to drive Hezbollah forces away from the Israel-Lebanon border, ideally up to or past the Litani River. In essence, the goal would be to recreate something like the buffer zone Israel held from 1985 to 2000, when the cumulative weight of Hezbollah attacks led Israel to withdraw. The operation might require large numbers of Israeli ground forces (in 2006 Israel sent around 30,000 troops into Lebanon — a number that was probably insufficient), both to suppress retaliatory Hezbollah missile and rocket fire against Israel and to support ground operations. Because Israeli forces have been fighting in Gaza or have been called up in other theaters for almost a year, reservists need little retraining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If successful, such an operation would greatly reduce the risk of an October 7–like ground incursion from Lebanon. Hezbollah fighters would need to traverse the buffer zone before crossing the Israeli border, making their detection and disruption far more likely. In addition, depending on the length of the buffer zone, Israel would reduce the risk of Hezbollah strikes from short-range systems such as mortars and especially ATGMs, making it hard for the group to fire into Israel proper. This, in turn, would make it safer for Israelis to return to their homes in northern Israel. Hezbollah would probably lose hundreds of fighters in the operation, perhaps even thousands — another blow to the group, which has suffered for months from Israeli strikes and covert operations against its personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short- and long-term costs of such an operation would be significant. Almost a year of fighting in Gaza has strained the Israeli military, which relies heavily on reserves. Another major operation would place a high burden on Israeli society. Because of the skill of Hezbollah fighters and the years they have had to build tunnels and establish defensive positions, operations may need to move slowly or risk surprise attacks that could lead to significant Israeli casualties or the risk of Hezbollah taking military captives. Even with a cautious approach, Hezbollah likely would impose significant casualties on Israeli forces, as it did in 2006. In addition, a ground invasion could trigger a far more massive Hezbollah rocket and missile attack deeper into Israel, with large numbers of systems launched to overwhelm Israel’s air defenses. These systems could target the whole country and, because Hezbollah has some precision systems, pose a risk to important military and civilian sites. In the 2006 conflict, Hezbollah sustained rocket and missile attacks on Israel for all 34 days of the conflict. Israel’s recent operations against the group, however, may have degraded its ability (and thus its willingness) to engage in a massive response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The damage to Lebanon would be far more severe, with Israeli forces targeting Hezbollah infrastructure and fighters throughout the country. If the Gaza campaign is any guide, Israel would be willing to inflict significant damage to civilian infrastructure and kill many civilians in pursuit of military objectives. Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese might be displaced as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vexing issue for Israel is the long-term status of the territory. Before 2000, Hezbollah regularly attacked Israeli forces and their Lebanese allies in the buffer zone, imposing low-level but steady casualties on Israel. Israeli forces were caught in the “Botz HaLevanoni” (the Lebanese muck) for 18 years. Given Israel’s 2000 abandonment of its Lebanese allies, it will struggle to find local allies to maintain the security zone, increasing both the risk of casualties to Israel and the number of troops needed to maintain the buffer zone. Iran would also help Hezbollah rearm and otherwise support the group as it recovers from Israeli attacks. With Israel occupying Lebanese territory, backing for Hezbollah is likely to increase, as Hezbollah can more credibly claim its operations are defensive and seek to restore the country’s sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of these risks, Israel might use a ground invasion supported by an aggressive air campaign to significantly degrade Hezbollah’s capabilities, destroy infrastructure (including tunnels) in the south, withdraw troops to Israel, and threaten to escalate if Hezbollah continues attacking. Economist and military strategist Thomas Schelling writes, “It is the threat of damage, or of more damage to come, that can make someone yield or comply.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;coercive-air-war&quot;&gt;Coercive Air War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a major ground invasion, Israel might conduct a sustained large-scale air campaign against Hezbollah and perhaps Iran and Iranian-backed groups. In such a scenario, piloted aircraft and drones would attack Hezbollah and other rocket and missile sites, ammunition stockpiles, command-and-control centers, and leadership targets, as well as interdict Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah. In contrast to current operations, far more attacks would occur outside the border zone, especially in Shiite-populated parts of Beirut and the Bekaa Valley, both of which are long-standing Hezbollah strongholds. Such an operation would put far fewer Israeli personnel at risk and otherwise avoid many of the costs to Israel of a ground operation. The operation would have to be sustained for many days. For example, Operation Allied Force, the U.S. air operation that forced Serbia to make concessions on Kosovo, lasted 78 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If successful, such an operation would continue to inflict a high pace of leadership turnover against Hezbollah. As a result, Hezbollah would continue to be off-balance and face difficulty drawing on the full strength of the organization. Attacks on Hezbollah’s military infrastructure would reduce the number of rockets and missiles Israel might face and make it harder for the group to deploy longer-range (and thus larger) systems without risk of detection and destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although such an operation would be less destructive to Hezbollah than an Israeli ground operation, the constant killings and destruction might make the group more willing to accept a ceasefire independent of the outcome of the Gaza war. Hezbollah leaders might also fear that ordinary Lebanese would turn against them, blaming the group for Israel’s campaign of destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah, of course, might not cave in the face of Israeli pressure. In the past, the group has proved willing to suffer considerable costs, including the loss of its most senior leaders, without abandoning its fight against Israel. Hezbollah may fear the public embarrassment of surrender, especially if Hamas and other Palestinian groups keep fighting. They may also believe they are in a use-or-lose situation with regard to some weapons systems. Moreover, by not using ground troops, Israel would be less effective at rooting out Hezbollah fighters near the border, who might hide underground or among civilians. In addition, the group’s short-range systems are less vulnerable to airpower. Hezbollah will also believe, probably rightly, that Iran will eventually replace many of the weapons systems Hezbollah would lose to air strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any event, Lebanese civilians would suffer considerably from this operation. The Israeli military claims that many Hezbollah facilities are located near civilian sites and that the group has deliberately put weapons in civilian areas. Several conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah have ended, in part, because of high-profile Israeli attacks that mistakenly killed civilians. However, Israel’s approach to Gaza suggests international condemnations due to civilian deaths matter less in its leaders’ calculations than other factors. This campaign may also take weeks or even months to resolve, far longer than a ground operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hezbollah-counter-escalation&quot;&gt;Hezbollah Counter-Escalation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah and Iran may decide to dramatically escalate operations against Israel. Israel’s recent attacks may lead group leaders to feel that their credibility is at stake if they do not respond. Hezbollah might also feel that Israel’s operations will be unrelenting, even if it does not retaliate, and thus the group may lose capabilities if it does not use them. A Hezbollah and broader Iranian decision to move to all-out war could involve a massive and sustained rocket, missile, and drone assault on Israel as well as limited ground operations on Israeli territory, though such ground operations are unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ground operation would be difficult under the present circumstances. Israel’s leadership attacks and the explosion of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies have made command and control more difficult and thus make it harder for Hezbollah to coordinate a successful ground operation. In addition, Israeli forces on the border are reinforced and prepared for an attack. There would be little chance of surprise, and given the recent successes of Israeli intelligence, Israel may know about the attack well in advance and prepare a devastating response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More dangerous for Israel is Hezbollah’s rocket, missile, and drone arsenal. Although Israeli air strikes have degraded some of this arsenal, Hezbollah still has much of it left, including large numbers of unguided missiles as well as smaller numbers of guided missiles that have the range to strike all of Israel. Hezbollah’s command-and-control systems also may be in chaos due to the various Israeli attacks. If Hezbollah could simultaneously launch large numbers of rockets and missiles, Israeli air defenses would down many, but Hezbollah could probably overwhelm Israeli defenses with massive simultaneous strikes and drone swarms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah’s goals would be as much political as military. If Hezbollah could conduct credible operations against Israel, it would offset some of the damage done to its reputation by Israel’s various intelligence successes. In addition, by inflicting steady punishment on Israelis throughout the country, Hezbollah would try to repeat its 2006 war success, when it created a sense among Israelis that they were involved in an unwinnable war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks for Hezbollah would be considerable. In addition to losing many of its fighters in ground attacks, the group might have an uncoordinated response and inflict only limited damage upon Israel, a further humiliation. Lebanon would suffer considerably from the Israeli response, and many Lebanese would blame Hezbollah, as well as Israel, for the destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah may count on help from Iran, though Iran’s anemic response to Israeli attacks so far, its weak conventional military, and its distance from the theater make it a limited partner. Nevertheless, Iran would likely replenish Hezbollah’s matériel losses and provide financial support to help the group recover, as it did in 2006. Iran has also increasingly signaled its willingness to directly attack Israel in response to the Israeli threat to Hezbollah, and the Israeli response to Iran’s October 1 ballistic missile attack will risk further escalation between the two regional powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;options-for-mitigating-a-war&quot;&gt;Options for Mitigating a War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has engaged in near-constant diplomacy to bring about a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah since the crisis began. Although U.S. efforts have clearly failed, the United States did help convince Israel not to launch a preemptive strike on Hezbollah in the days after the October attack. Moreover, the United States has probably helped deter Iran from increasing its direct role and may be a factor in Hezbollah’s decision, so far, not to escalate to all-out war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amos Hochstein is the face of U.S. diplomacy in the Lebanon crisis, often working with French, and at times German, officials. He has put forward a plan to relocate Hezbollah forces north of the Blue Line and end Israeli overflights of Lebanon, which violate UNSCR 1701. Hochstein has advocated for additional observers (potentially from Germany) to the 13,000 UNIFIL troops deployed in southern Lebanon to better monitor potential Hezbollah activity there. Hezbollah, however, claims it will not end its attacks as long as Hamas is fighting, a stance it reiterated after the Nasrallah killing. Israeli officials claim diplomacy alone will not bring a ceasefire, and they call for Hezbollah to abide by UNSCR 1701, which prohibits the group from placing fighters near the Israeli border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the United States has pushed for a diplomatic settlement, however, it has supported Israel militarily with equipment, ammunition, air defense, and intelligence, and it could continue to do so as a way to increase pressure on Hezbollah. Given the risk of all-out war, however, U.S. officials should redouble efforts to bring about a ceasefire in Lebanon, even if they cannot achieve one in Gaza. Hezbollah, given its recent losses, may be open to a ceasefire if it can occur in a face-saving way, which in practice may mean after Hezbollah successfully conducts a significant attack on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, experts like Middle East analyst Robert Satloff contend the United States might push for an informal deal where both sides suspend or significantly curb cross-border fire and civilians return to their homes. Under this proposal, Hezbollah would remove its major military systems from the area near the Israeli border. An Israeli concession would allow Hezbollah’s forces to return to the border but not in uniform or as part of large formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these diplomatic initiatives, a lasting ceasefire will be difficult to achieve. The October 7 Hamas attack was a landmark moment for Israel’s government and population, exacerbating the country’s insecurity. The best that negotiators may be able to achieve is managing the escalation of violence and preventing an all-out war that devastates much of Lebanon and expands into Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea remains one of the most opaque nuclear states in the world, offering little information about its nuclear fuel cycle (NFC) and weapons programme. Yet, the structure and scope of its programme have significant implications for global stability. There is a need for a robust analytical methodology that can derive insights from limited data to assess North Korea’s NFC and nuclear strategy. Such analysis is crucial for the international community, particularly should diplomatic avenues reopen, providing a rare opportunity to curtail or reverse North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper builds on work conducted by the Verification Research, Training and Information Centre (VERTIC) to model North Korea’s NFC. It integrates VERTIC’s estimates of North Korea’s production of weapons-usable fissile material – specifically weapons-grade plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU) – into a comprehensive framework that assesses Pyongyang’s nuclear strategy. By examining the trade-offs in arsenal structure amid fissile-material constraints, the paper offers a nuanced exploration of North Korea’s approach to deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s nuclear arsenal serves two purposes: to deter distant nuclear powers such as the US; and to counter nearby non-nuclear adversaries such as South Korea, United States Forces Korea and Japan. Should deterrence fail, North Korea aims to contain and win any conflict on the Korean Peninsula, ensuring the regime’s survival. To meet these objectives, North Korea appears to be developing both a strategic and more versatile arsenal – featuring smaller-yield weapons and varied delivery platforms – for regional and battlefield use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper delves into the various strategies North Korea might employ to optimise its arsenal, given its fissile-material constraints. Based on the analysis of force-structure requirements to achieve credible deterrence, it is assessed that North Korea might aim to develop 25–35 strategic thermonuclear warheads and 80–200 short- and medium-range single-stage warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given its fissile-material inventory at the end of 2023, as analysed by VERTIC, North Korea might have already developed approximately 21–23 composite (plutonium and HEU) thermonuclear warheads. With its remaining HEU inventory, the state could additionally have manufactured 51–165 single-stage nuclear warheads, supporting its regional deterrence goals (via tactical and battlefield deployment). Although North Korea is still likely constrained by its plutonium supply, evidence suggests that its nuclear material production goals may have been met or are nearing sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, North Korea may choose to work within its existing fissile-material resources, deeming its arsenal adequate. Alternatively, it might ramp up production to exceed current needs, maintain a surplus stockpile or continue enhancing its arsenal’s capabilities to align with the availability of its fissile material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the future trajectory of North Korea’s nuclear strategy remains uncertain, this paper provides an analytical framework that enriches understanding of North Korea’s nuclear force structure given its fissile-material production. By offering these insights, the paper seeks to advance a more informed international dialogue, recognising the critical need for preparedness in the face of limited information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea provides very little information to the international community about its nuclear fuel cycle (NFC) and nuclear weapons programme. However, the structure and extent of its programme impacts geopolitical stability. An analytical methodology that can work with only limited data to assess both North Korea’s NFC and its nuclear arsenal strategy is therefore crucial. Such a methodology would help to prepare the international community should negotiations restart with North Korea and an opportunity present itself to restrain or roll back its nuclear programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, the Verification Research, Training and Information Centre (VERTIC), the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) and RUSI, with funding from Global Affairs Canada, embarked on a multi-year project to assess the entirety of North Korea’s WMD programme. For the nuclear programme, the whole NFC was modelled – from uranium mining to weapons-grade material production – using software provided by the UK’s National Nuclear Laboratory (a process hereafter referred to as the “VERTIC model”), with the help of open source information, including extensive satellite imagery analysis. The result of this work was a range of estimates of North Korea’s inventory of fissile material, given different plutonium reprocessing and uranium enrichment scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this analysis, conducted by the Open Nuclear Network (ONN), a programme of PAX sapiens, is to take the fissile-material inventory as it stood at the end of 2023 and assess North Korea’s nuclear force structure. It specifically aims to address two research questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What key fissile-material demands are derived from various strategies that North Korea might adopt to structure its nuclear arsenal?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How might North Korea’s nuclear arsenal structure have been affected by fissile-material constraints?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has four chapters. Chapter I explores North Korea’s nuclear strategy, Chapter II examines its potential nuclear arsenal size and Chapter III addresses the potential designs of its nuclear weapons. Chapter IV then explores the fissile-material demands and constraints that might affect each of those areas. The paper concludes with overall observations and future recommended work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete answers to the above research questions can only be provided by a handful of North Korean leaders and nuclear decision-makers. Nonetheless, ONN provides here an analytical framework with which to evaluate North Korea’s nuclear weapons strategy, including examining trade-offs that the country must consider when deciding how to structure its arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the first research question, ONN analysed the composition of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. This encompassed a comprehensive literature review of North Korea’s nuclear strategy, arsenal size and weapons designs. This aided in evaluating North Korea’s declared nuclear strategy and identifying the types of weapons developed, quantities of weapons required for different deterrence strategies and the corresponding amount of fissile material. Further evaluation was made of the nuclear weapon varieties and potential designs. This primarily entailed measurements based on accessible open source images of North Korean nuclear armaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the second research question, ONN took the cumulative fissile-material inventory estimates – as they stood at the end of 2023 – from the VERTIC model, assessed trade-offs North Korea might make under fissile-material constraints and analysed other areas that may potentially constrain the programme (such as tritium production and high-explosives testing capabilities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this picture of North Korea’s fissile-material demands and constraints, several conclusions were drawn about what North Korea’s current nuclear weapons arsenal may look like and how the state might be hoping to develop its nuclear weapons programme in the future. While the fissile-material models ran to the end of 2023, the analysis was completed by March 2024. The methodology presented here can be adapted if assumptions change or new information is revealed. This allows changes in the arsenal and fissile-material demands/constraints to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are clear bounding constraints or design imperatives deriving from the development of delivery systems that are relevant to fissile-material requirements. However, this study does not consider in detail the implications for weapons design of the development of specific North Korean delivery systems. This research also focused primarily on analysing the present situation; historical situations are considered only to provide clarity on the present. These two aspects, in addition to other recommended follow-on work, are discussed further in Conclusions at the end of this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;i-nuclear-strategy&quot;&gt;I. Nuclear Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on a state publication from 2013, North Korea classifies weapon size according to yield (with “super-large” above 1 megatonne, all the way down to “super-miniaturised” at less than 1 kilotonne). North Korea reportedly further classifies its nuclear arsenal by use: tactical (to destroy personnel and equipment on the frontline or operational tactical depth zone via tactical ballistic missiles or artillery shells); battlefield (to strike regional targets via medium-range missiles); and strategic (to strike large cities, industrial centres and other strategic targets via intercontinental or submarine-launched ballistic missiles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to state media, North Korea has begun to gradually shift its nuclear strategy from solely intending nuclear weapons for strategic deterrence to including potential regional and battlefield use. Additionally, North Korea is looking to diversify its nuclear forces to operate in a variety of environments and with a variety of delivery means and ranges, including greater emphasis on the nuclearisation of North Korea’s navy. This means developing nuclear weapons with a range of yields that can be delivered by a wide range of platforms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, North Korea released its codified nuclear doctrine, the Law of the Supreme People’s Assembly of the DPRK on the State Policy on the Nuclear Forces. The new law is a departure from its 2013 Law on Consolidating Position of Nuclear Weapons State, primarily in that it provides more details on North Korea’s nuclear command and control. It also specifies the following conditions for nuclear weapons use, which were absent from the 2013 law:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“In case an attack by nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction was launched or drew near is judged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case a nuclear or non-nuclear attack by hostile forces on the state leadership and the command organization of the state’s nuclear forces was launched or drew near is judged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case a fatal military attack against important strategic objects of the state was launched or drew near is judged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case the need for operation for preventing the expansion and protraction of a war and taking the initiative in the war in contingency is inevitably raised.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In other case an inevitable situation in which it is compelled to correspond with catastrophic crisis to the existence of the state and safety of the people by only nuclear weapons is created.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un also stated that North Korea’s “status as a nuclear weapons state has now become irreversible” and there would be no more denuclearisation talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further attempting to solidify its position as a nuclear state, in September 2023 North Korea amended its constitution to read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea relies on the all-people, nationwide defence system. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as a committed nuclear state, shall accelerate the development of nuclear weapons to ensure its rights to existence and development, deter war and safeguard peace and stability of the region and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this amendment, North Korea is now the only nuclear-armed state to have any reference to nuclear weapons in its constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since October 2023, changes in the political landscape may have implications for North Korea’s nuclear strategy. One such change is the reclassification of South Korea as the “principal enemy”, departing from a previous relationship aimed at unification. This shift followed North Korea’s complete suspension in November 2023 of the Comprehensive Military Agreement, accompanied by the remilitarisation of former buffer zones. Subsequently, North Korea’s rhetoric towards South Korea has become more confrontational, evidenced by tests and inspections of close-combat weaponry, and strategic maps of Seoul. These developments may lead to greater emphasis on the development of tactical and battlefield nuclear warheads. Reported and observed technical advancements also indicate a continued expansion of medium- and long-range missiles and the development of space capabilities. Notable examples include the testing of a new solid-fuelled intermediate-range ballistic missile equipped with a manoeuvrable re-entry vehicle payload, another ICBM test and North Korea’s first successful spy satellite launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These statements and actions, taken together, suggest that North Korea is looking to deter both a large, distant nuclear adversary (that is, the US) and a range of regional conventionally superior, non-nuclear adversaries (that is, South Korea, United States Forces Korea (USFK) and Japan) by making its arsenal useable (with smaller yields, a greater variety of platforms and an acknowledgement of battlefield use). This approach is consistent with its stated goals of being able to deter, contain and win a conflict on the Korean Peninsula in order to preserve the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-nuclear-arsenal-size&quot;&gt;II. Nuclear Arsenal Size&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explores North Korea’s potential nuclear arsenal size. First, a literature review is presented of external open source estimates of North Korea’s fissile material and nuclear weapons amounts. Following this, a potential numerical force structure is developed through analyses of likely defence needs and analogous nuclear weapon programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;literature-review&quot;&gt;Literature Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External evaluations from the time of North Korea’s last reprocessing campaign in 2022 to the analysis cut-off period of March 2024 provide a range of assessments about the amounts and types of nuclear material and weapons that North Korea possesses (Table 1). These align closely with the outputs from the VERTIC model and ONN’s subsequent analysis (discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Gav575H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: External Open Source Estimates of North Korea’s Fissile-Material and Nuclear Weapons Amounts from 2022 to March 2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The authors. Note: Additional open source estimates have been released since the end date of this analysis (March 2024) and are included in a separate literature review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-numerical-force-structure&quot;&gt;Potential Numerical Force Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on North Korea’s own definitions, the country seems to divide its arsenal into strategic (long-range), battlefield (medium-range) and tactical (short-range) nuclear weapons. ONN has used these categories in its own analysis of the potential number of weapons that North Korea may be seeking to fulfil its goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic Weaponry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic weaponry of North Korea’s arsenal is seemingly aimed at deterring the US from invading or attacking the country – such an invasion would present an existential risk to the regime. Given this overarching goal, it is plausible to assume that North Korea views the US as minimally deterred if North Korea can, with a strategic nuclear weapon, hold at least one target on the continental US at risk. To do this, North Korea might seek a quantitative capacity that would be significantly likely to breach US missile defences working at optimal performance levels. This assumes a conservative level of North Korean risk tolerance. If North Korea is prepared to take on more risk, the country might require a smaller strategic arsenal to accomplish its desired level of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US ICBM defence architecture contains 44 ground-based interceptors (GBIs), based in Alaska and California. At least two GBIs would be fired per incoming re-entry vehicle (RV), meaning these 44 GBIs might intercept 22 RVs, assuming the capacity for simultaneous launch. An additional 20 GBIs will reportedly be added by 2026, meaning eventually 32 RVs might be intercepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be reasonably confident that at least one nuclear weapon would breach US missile defences and strike a target on the mainland, North Korea would need to launch at least 23 weapons loaded on separate ICBM RVs (33 by 2026). For the purposes of this analysis, 25–35 weapons is the range considered, given that at least two weapons will likely be undergoing maintenance or be in transport at any one time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “worst-case” estimate – from North Korea’s perspective – assumes perfect operation of US missile defence and that North Korea does not take evasive measures (for example, dummy RVs). As mentioned above, modified assumptions may mean that North Korea might be satisfied with a smaller strategic arsenal. On the other hand, varying the assumptions might end up with North Korea requiring a larger strategic arsenal; for example, to account for the potential for missile or warhead failures, or the loss of nuclear weapons due to an attack before they can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical and Battlefield Weaponry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tactical and battlefield weaponry of the North Korean arsenal is aimed at deterring large-scale attacks or invasion from South Korea, USFK and Japan by establishing the threat that North Korea has the capability and willingness to use nuclear weapons in the region (either on the frontlines or at regional targets on the Korean Peninsula, Japan or surrounding areas). The number of weapons North Korea might be building for this portion of its nuclear arsenal is more difficult to assess. What constitutes “enough” weapons for warfighting or regional use varies state to state and person to person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible insight into North Korea’s tactical strategy was provided in the March 2023 reveal of the Hwasan-31, a new type of nuclear warhead that was depicted as part of eight different delivery systems. While this may or may not be an accurate representation of North Korea’s current capabilities or actual intent, it does suggest one way North Korea may decide to shape its arsenal: with nuclear weapons on a variety of delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to assess how many weapons per delivery system North Korea might be aiming to deploy. These could be all the same design but mated to specific, different delivery systems. Or they could be different designs made specifically for deployment on one type of delivery system. The implications for fissile-material amounts are negligible. There is no universally accepted way to assess this, as every state has vastly different strategies when deciding how many warheads should be deployed on each delivery system. Additionally, there are even fewer states that actively deploy tactical or battlefield nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the probable compositions of the Indian and Pakistani nuclear arsenals are helpful guides as each of these states is trying to hold many targets at risk in their neighbour’s territory. Hans M Kristensen and Matt Korda assessed that for these states there are 10–25 warheads mated to each delivery vehicle type. This range can be used to consider the North Korean arsenal. Parts of the Indian and Pakistani nuclear arsenals are for similar uses – on short- or medium-range ballistic missiles – and are relatively small nuclear programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If 10–25 warheads are similarly mated to each of North Korea’s eight notional delivery systems, North Korea could aim to have 80–200 tactical weapons deployed. This would presumably be “enough” tactical and battlefield nuclear weapons for warfighting, as it would allow the state to hold at least 80 targets at risk, both on the Korean Peninsula and further afield in the Northeast Asia region. As discussed earlier, there are many potential targets in the region for North Korea’s tactical and battlefield nuclear weapons, and this number provides flexibility and extensive coverage for the country’s targeting plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the strategic arsenal, varying any of these underlying assumptions might mean a larger tactical and battlefield arsenal (for instance, to account for greater caution on the potential for missile or warhead failures, the loss of nuclear weapons due to an attack before they can be used, a larger set of identified targets, or more warheads per system) or a smaller one (such as to account for a higher level of North Korean risk tolerance, or fewer delivery systems or warheads per system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-nuclear-weapons-designs&quot;&gt;III. Nuclear Weapons Designs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter analyses potential nuclear weapon designs North Korea may have incorporated into its arsenal. First, a literature review is presented, followed by a summary of imagery analysis conducted on North Korea’s displayed nuclear devices. This is followed by a discussion on design element trade-offs, and concludes with a list of designs North Korea may have developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;literature-review-1&quot;&gt;Literature Review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External experts and analysts have suggested that North Korea may have tested or may be developing the following possible nuclear weapons designs. Not all listed designs are considered plausible (either by the original authors or ONN).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Single-stage device:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 15-kt device, with a diameter of 40–60 cm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An HEU device with a total warhead weight of 500 kg.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An unboosted 250-kt HEU device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tactical warhead (Hwasan-31) with a levitated pit capable of being used in different delivery vehicles, and with a diameter of 40–45 cm and yield of 10 kt.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A 15-kt composite core made of a 2-kg plutonium sphere with 10–15 kg of HEU shells.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A thermonuclear “layer cake” device with a 3.5-kg plutonium core, 80 kg of uranium (HEU, low-enriched uranium and natural uranium), and lithium-6 deuteride and lithium-6 deuterium-tritium shells.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two-stage device:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A thermonuclear device with a 4-kg plutonium primary and a 37–40-kg HEU secondary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other analysts have been less specific in suggesting possible designs, although several have assumed when conducting their calculations that an average of 4 kg of plutonium or 12–20 kg of HEU is used per weapon, depending on whether the weapon uses only plutonium or only HEU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;imagery-analysis&quot;&gt;Imagery Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates of the size of each device shown by North Korea can be used to obtain bounding constraints on the possible designs of North Korea’s devices. The amount of fissile material and designs do not correlate exactly to size. Nonetheless, it is an important aspect to assess, as North Korea releases relatively little data and only a handful of images of these devices exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONN independently conducted an analysis of open source images of nuclear devices, released by North Korea, to generate the size estimates. The results are published separately and are summarised below. These estimates of maximum device diameter are a guide to the potential sizes of North Korean nuclear devices and show the country’s desire to move towards more complex and compact designs. While the devices shown may be fake, their very release at the least indicates some sort of drive or desire for these types of weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-design-capabilities-and-resources&quot;&gt;Specific Design Capabilities and Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Composite Pit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During its third test, some assessed that North Korea used an HEU or composite pit. If it did, this would mirror the Soviet Union’s third test, which used a composite plutonium-HEU pit. As a late mover, North Korea has a relative technological advantage, lending weight to the argument that the country has diversified its fissile-material use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gas Boosting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While gas boosting would increase yield and allow for more advanced miniaturisation, it is unlikely that North Korea has incorporated this design into its arsenal, although it is technically possible. To do so, North Korea’s programme, as with earlier programmes of other states, would have to overcome several issues, such as gaseous tritium/deuterium storage and handling, tritium production and integration of such materials into the weapons themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Gaseous Tritium/Deuterium
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaseous tritium/deuterium, which can be used for boosting the primary, creates challenges in handling and storing within a warhead system. There is potential leakage under very high pressure, which increases as tritium decays. This is exacerbated by the radioactive decay specifically to helium, which accelerates cracking in imperfections in the metal lattice of the containment vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in storage, gaseous tritium “leaks” from containers, and will cause pressure increases in its containers due to radioactive decay. Tritium stored in a solid matrix, such as in uranium or palladium metal, is easier to handle and ship; however, the process to recover the tritium can be difficult depending on the metal used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As tritium has a half-life of 12.26 years, 5.7% decays per year, requiring any nuclear-armed state incorporating gas boosting to manufacture tritium close to the date of a test or use in any weapon, to prevent as much decay as possible and lower the risk of storage incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tritium Production
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on data from the VERTIC model, North Korea’s NFC can produce 3–17 g of tritium per year depending on how much of its plutonium and HEU production North Korea is willing to sacrifice; there are trade-offs between tritium production on the one hand, and plutonium and HEU production on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Weapons Integration
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, gas boosting has required significant testing to ensure its reliability. As North Korea has only conducted six tests, it is unlikely to have mastered this technology, which eluded other nuclear-armed states until they were well into their testing programmes. Confidence in a boosted system requires significant testing, especially as it is a potential single point of failure for the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as mentioned above, tritium’s short half-life requires that it is regularly changed out of the weapon, thus increasing maintenance time and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given such difficulties, the lack of technical necessity or security imperative and the lack of announcements from North Korea’s government, ONN assesses that North Korea is unlikely to be employing gas boosting in its nuclear weapons. North Korea might instead be opting for the more abundant lithium-deuteride fusion fuel, which would remove some logistical burden in handling tritium directly, eliminate the half-life issues and allow for production in situ when the secondary is initiated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all these considerations, North Korea has likely decided to use more proven designs that can still produce considerable yield without sacrificing reliability and safety. This area should be monitored for further developments as this is likely a technology North Korea is eager to master, allowing for greater yield at lower warhead weights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thermonuclear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONN assesses that North Korea already has a fielded thermonuclear weapon, likely demonstrated in its most recent test. This is consistent with, for example, China’s programme, which designed and tested a two-stage thermonuclear device within five nuclear tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lithium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-6 can be used to breed tritium (which is used in fusion reactions), either directly in a thermonuclear weapon or in a nuclear reactor via neutron activation. Open source information indicates only a few kilograms are used per weapon. According to the available literature, it appears that North Korea has access to millions of tonnes of natural lithium (both through domestic reserves and dual-use imports), and the capability to enrich to higher concentrations of lithium-6 at its Hungnam Chemical Complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these external assessments, for the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that North Korea has enough lithium, and in particular lithium-6, for use in any thermonuclear arsenal it has built or plans to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beryllium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beryllium can be used in nuclear weapons as a neutron reflector to increase the fissioning efficiency of the nuclear material, thus requiring less fissile material to produce a critical mass. North Korea has known reserves of beryllium and, although little is known about the exact amount, based on geological data from the 1950s, they are assumed to amount to at least thousands, if not millions, of tonnes. Additionally, there is data suggesting that North Korea sent beryl for processing to the Soviet Union in the 1950s. It is unknown if there are any current processing capabilities in North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are uncertainties, this analysis assumes – based on the limited evidence available – that beryllium is not a constraint on North Korea’s weaponisation strategy. This is especially the case as other materials can be substituted for beryllium in nuclear weapons applications. Should additional information come to light, this assumption should be revisited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Explosives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High explosives are used to achieve criticality in nuclear devices, while also having numerous non-nuclear military applications. There is an abundance of raw materials and production techniques known to exist in North Korea for high-explosives manufacturing, and a lack of any indication that the country is having issues with supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea conducted high-explosives tests at the Yongbyon Nuclear Complex in the 1980s and 1990s. Since the 1990s, media and research articles have repeatedly associated Yongdoktong (approximately 40 km northwest of Yongbyon) with the country’s nuclear weapons programme, specifically in connection to high-explosive tests and storage, and the storage of nuclear weapons. According to ONN’s analysis of available satellite images, the Yongdoktong site has a number of locations with features similar to other high-explosives testing sites (such as enclosed structures to avoid blast effects and a monitoring area). The site has underground facilities with multiple entrances, and activities related to excavation and construction have been seen. North Korea has demonstrated its ability to manufacture high explosives for its six nuclear tests and numerous non-nuclear tests. Thus, it is assessed that high explosives are not a constraint on nuclear weapons manufacturing in North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modelling and Simulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To verify nuclear weapons design information and gain insight from nuclear weapons tests, some modelling and simulation capabilities are necessary. Of course, testing is a form of design verification, but the more modelling capability a state possesses, the better it can interpret the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has clearly developed expertise with weaponisation-relevant codes (receiving valuable early assistance on nuclear weapons designs from A Q Khan), as demonstrated by its training of others on these codes. In 2011, it was reported that North Korea had provided Iran with a US-origin computer program. This program simulated neutron flows and would help with nuclear weapons development. North Korea also trained Iranian specialists to establish and maintain proficiency with the software. Furthermore, North Korea was linked to participation in the provision of “mathematical formulas and codes for theoretical design work” in Iran. It is unknown how much of this expertise was indigenously developed or learned from external sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis assumes that North Korea has sufficient competencies to model and simulate nuclear devices. Further in-depth analysis of this aspect of North Korea’s weaponisation programme is needed for additional clarity and insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other Weaponisation-Relevant Equipment and Technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some instances, it can be difficult to assess the availability of weaponisation-relevant technologies (such as specialised machining equipment, high-speed cameras or other monitoring equipment used for nuclear weapons testing) because of the lack of open source information, including international trade and domestic commercial data. Due to the focus of this paper, an in-depth analysis of these issues was not conducted, but could be explored in further analysis. Difficulties in procuring such equipment and technology could constitute a significant complication for North Korea’s nuclear strategy. However, as North Korea has demonstrated its ability to conduct nuclear tests despite these limitations, it can be assumed for this study that other weaponisation-relevant technologies are not a major constraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potentially-incorporated-designs&quot;&gt;Potentially Incorporated Designs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the discussion presented in this chapter, ONN has assessed that the six nuclear devices tested and incorporated into North Korea’s arsenal are likely one of the following designs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Implosion-based single-stage device with a levitated pit made of plutonium, HEU or a composite of plutonium and HEU.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Two-stage thermonuclear device that incorporates a version of its single-stage device as the primary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea has likely explored several designs that could be considered more reliable (that is, those that will produce the designed yield when detonated) and, conversely, more technically sophisticated (that is, miniaturised weapons). The state has displayed what was indicated to be a thermonuclear weapon and a tactical weapon, designed to be deployed on a number of delivery vehicle types. Therefore, to understand the full range of North Korean force structure strategies and provide a fully exhaustive assessment, it is assumed that the country has built both single-stage implosion devices and a two-stage thermonuclear device. These devices would satisfy the two purposes of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and allow the state to diversify its nuclear force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most likely design selection for the strategic weaponry is a two-stage thermonuclear device, given that North Korea defines its strategic weapons as ones that will strike large cities, industrial centres and other strategic targets. It is certainly possible that North Korea has single-stage implosion devices in its strategic arsenal. However, based on the country’s own definition, this analysis assesses that “strategic” means two-stage thermonuclear. Should this assumption be modified, the analysis could be adapted to account for another composition of the strategic arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most likely warhead design for the tactical/battlefield part of North Korea’s arsenal is a single-stage implosion device, as it would be used in proximity to North Korea’s own forces and homeland. Tactical/battlefield nuclear weapons could be two-stage thermonuclear weapons, and thermonuclear weapons could be designed with lower yields to prevent harm to friendly troops. However, based solely on North Korea’s own definition, ONN assesses that tactical/battlefield is a lower-yield, single-stage device. The most likely candidate for this is the Hwasan-31, as it is the only reported tactical weapon North Korea has shown. If any of these assumptions were modified, the analysis could be adapted to account for another composition of the tactical/battlefield arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-fissile-material-demands-and-constraints&quot;&gt;IV. Fissile-Material Demands and Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines the intersection between fissile-material demands and constraints, and how this interplay could affect North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fissile-material-demands-from-potential-force-structure-and-designs&quot;&gt;Fissile-Material Demands from Potential Force Structure and Designs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all the considerations presented, North Korea has many choices for how to structure its arsenal to optimise its fissile-material use while also accomplishing its geopolitical and security objectives. For this analysis, ONN has identified plausible arsenal configurations and derived the associated fissile-material demands of these arsenals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strategic Arsenal Demands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following assessments about the fissile materials potentially used in North Korea’s strategic arsenal are made based on nuclear physics principles and assumptions made in open sources. The figures shown in Table 2 represent the final amounts of fissile materials in each two-stage thermonuclear device (losses due to the weaponisation process are discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All plutonium: 4 kg of weapons-grade plutonium per device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All HEU: 12–15 kg of HEU per device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mixed-material: 2–4 kg of weapons-grade plutonium and 10 kg of HEU per device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tactical/Battlefield Arsenal Demands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following assessments about the fissile materials potentially used in North Korea’s tactical and battlefield nuclear warheads are made based on nuclear physics principles and assumptions made in open sources. The figures shown in Table 3 represent the final amounts of fissile materials in each single-stage nuclear device (losses due to the weaponisation process are discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All-plutonium pit: 4–6 kg of weapons-grade plutonium per device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All-HEU pit: 10–12 kg of HEU per device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Composite pit: 2 kg of weapons-grade plutonium and 8–10 kg of HEU per device.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summary of Fissile-Material Demands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should North Korea be fielding an all-plutonium arsenal, based on the options presented, it would need 420–1,340 kg of plutonium. For an all-HEU arsenal, it would require 1,100–2,925 kg of HEU. For an arsenal made of composite pits, it would require 210–540 kg of plutonium and 890–2,350 kg of HEU. There are of course ranges in between, should there be different mixes of weapon types (such as ½ plutonium, ½ HEU; ⅓ plutonium, ⅓ HEU, ⅓ composite); the estimates here represent the extremes of fissile-material demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figures in Table 4 represent the nuclear material actually used in the device (losses from machining and fabrication are discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fissile-material-production&quot;&gt;Fissile-Material Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uranium is a naturally occurring element. In its natural form, it mostly consists of the isotope U-238 with very small (less than 1%) amounts of the isotope U-235. To manufacture most fuel for nuclear reactors, uranium needs to be enriched to approximately 3–5% U-235 to create the proper fission dynamics. For nuclear weapons, uranium needs to be highly enriched, at over 20% U-235, although the ideal enrichment level is over 85%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various isotopes of plutonium are produced via fissioning of uranium in a nuclear reactor, typically consisting of approximately 24% Pu-240. For use in nuclear weapons, the amount of Pu-240 needed for practical purposes is less than 7% of the total amount of plutonium, which corresponds to 93% Pu-239. This can be accomplished by configuring the nuclear reactor fuel in specific ways to produce this “weapons-grade plutonium” and thus optimise the amount of Pu-239. However, the plutonium products must be separated from the rest of the spent reactor fuel via reprocessing, and then further refined into a form usable in nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VERTIC ran three different fissile-material production scenarios (as of 2023) in its NFC model for ONN to produce cumulative totals of fissile material produced in North Korea. All scenarios assume no plutonium production prior to 1991 and no HEU production prior to 2003, and only significantly vary in the HEU production estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first scenario is based on analyses from Siegfried S Hecker at Stanford University’s Center for International Security and Cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a second large clandestine centrifuge facility that may be Kangson or some facility not yet identified in open sources … Hecker, under this scenario, assumes a pilot plant with two cascades (660 centrifuges) and a SWU/centrifuge of 4. The UEW [uranium enrichment workshop at Yongbyon] then has 8000 SWU/year from 2010-2015 and 16,000 SWU/year from 2016 onwards. A clandestine facility is constructed in 2013-2014 and expanded in 2017-2018 for a total 35,000 SWU/year. Hecker’s analysis is based on North Korea’s annual production capability of rotors, with two flow-forming machines between them capable of producing 1500 P2 rotors/year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario Two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second scenario is based on analyses from David Albright at the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this scenario, the UEW [Uranium Enrichment Workshop] at Yongbyon is the largest centrifuge facility and only a pilot plant exists alongside this, responsible for all pre-2010 evidence of enrichment. In this scenario, Albright takes Hecker’s estimate of 2000 P2-type centrifuges observed in the UEW and assumes a four-stage enrichment process as observed in Libya … and operational challenges with the centrifuges that reduces a 5 SWU/centrifuge effectively by a third for a total SWU/year for the plant of 6500 from 2010 to 2015 and 10,000-13,000 from 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario Three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third scenario is also based on analyses from David Albright at ISIS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this scenario, there is a second large clandestine centrifuge facility that may be Kangson or some facility not yet identified in open sources. Albright in this scenario assumes the clandestine facility becomes operational from 2005-2010 with a comparable size to the UEW for total SWU/year of 26,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outputs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Table 5, all three scenarios generally agree that North Korea has produced 64–65 kg of plutonium enriched to weapons grade (98% Pu-239). The three scenarios, however, indicate vastly different HEU (88–89% U-235) accumulations, ranging from 868 kg to 2,111 kg. This large difference in uranium largely stems from the external community’s uncertainty about North Korea’s uranium enrichment programme, as detailed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;potential-fissile-material-losses&quot;&gt;Potential Fissile-Material Losses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Production&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONN assumes that losses due to production and experimentation, and keeping some material in storage for excess, should account for around 10% of total fissile-material availability. Estimations of fissile-material losses are difficult to assess due to secrecy surrounding the manufacturing process. An initial estimate of 10% was chosen, as material losses from the NFC are already accounted for within the VERTIC model. This is therefore a reasonable starting point for the losses due to weaponisation. See Table 7 for the adjusted fissile-material availability numbers as of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the information that is both known and assumed about North Korea’s nuclear tests, the likely fissile material available at the time of the test, and its nuclear strategy, the assessment in Table 6 was made about the devices tested by the country thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7FeiVe4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 6: North Korean Nuclear Tests and Assumed Devices.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The authors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adjusted Fissile-Material Availability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the assessments of the fissile material consumed via losses (see above) and testing (presented in the “ONN Device Assessment” column in Table 6), the total fissile-material inventory available for North Korea’s nuclear weapons arsenal was adjusted to the amounts shown in Table 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;plutonium-versus-uranium-weapons&quot;&gt;Plutonium Versus Uranium Weapons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear weaponry using plutonium is aligned with North Korea’s overarching nuclear strategy aimed at deterring the US. This approach allows lighter-weight strategic weapons to fit on ICBMs. As its nuclear doctrine evolves, North Korea is incorporating more tactical and battlefield weapons into its nuclear approach, facilitated by its accumulated stockpile of HEU. The accessibility of HEU provides the state with increased flexibility in crafting a variety of tactical/battlefield nuclear weapons, stemming from the ability to design devices with various arrangements of fissile materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is also possible that HEU is used in North Korea’s strategic nuclear weapons in combination with plutonium in the primary, as this configuration would allow the state’s limited stockpile of plutonium to be stretched much further. Additionally, HEU was likely first produced in 2003, before North Korea’s first test in 2006, which means it is highly likely that HEU is in at least some of the test devices (to confirm reliability), including the strategic weapon tested in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;comparison-with-demands&quot;&gt;Comparison with Demands&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the analysis of North Korea’s demands, it was concluded that the state may be aiming to develop at least 25–35 strategic thermonuclear warheads and 80–200 tactical and battlefield fission devices to meet its geopolitical and security objectives. Given the fissile-materials constraints presented here, it is likely that North Korea has not yet accomplished this goal – although it could be very close – as it has not yet produced sufficient quantities of nuclear material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should North Korea intend to produce 25 composite thermonuclear weapons, it would, at a minimum, need 2 kg of plutonium and 10 kg of HEU per weapon, leading to a demand of 50 kg of plutonium and 250 kg of HEU. Given the material constraints presented in Table 7, North Korea would have been able to produce 21–23 devices of this type, using at least 42–46 kg of plutonium and 210–30 kg of HEU. This leaves a deficit of 2–4 strategic thermonuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the tactical and battlefield mission of its nuclear arsenal was added after its strategic mission, it is assumed that North Korea would work to accomplish its strategic nuclear requirements before its tactical ones. The use of nuclear materials for strategic weapons described above would leave minimal plutonium (0 or 0.5 kg) but large quantities of HEU (513–1,652 kg) remaining for the tactical and battlefield mission, which could be accomplished with only HEU. As assumed before, North Korea would need at least 10 kg of HEU per tactical and battlefield weapon for a single-stage, all-HEU device. This indicates that North Korea could have 51–165 weapons after production losses and testing, which could already or nearly fulfil its tactical and battlefield deterrence objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should any of the underlying assumptions in this analysis be modified, this final weapons deficit could end up being larger or even result in a surplus. Additionally, any further data that would require adjustments to the VERTIC model or underlying assumptions made there would require adjustments to the figures derived in this analysis. As North Korea reveals so little information, any further information that confirms or changes these inputs and assumptions will greatly increase the precision and accuracy of these analytical outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea is likely diversifying its nuclear force to operate in a variety of environments and with a variety of delivery means. Relatedly, the country looks to be continuing to move towards a nuclear strategy with two purposes: to deter both a large nuclear adversary (that is, the US); and a range of regional conventionally superior, non-nuclear adversaries (that is, South Korea, USFK and Japan) by making its arsenal useable. Based on this potential dual focus of North Korea’s arsenal, the state is likely developing at least three different categories of weaponry: strategic; battlefield; and tactical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many options for how North Korea can structure its arsenal to optimise its fissile-material use and demands while also accomplishing its deterrence objectives. To meet its objective in deterring the US, one possibility is that North Korea could strive for at least 25 strategic thermonuclear warheads, with the eventual goal of 35 based on the 2026 target delivery date for the expansion of US missile defences. Based on calculations of North Korea’s potential available fissile materials as of 2023, the state could have sufficient material to enable it to have already developed 21–23 thermonuclear warheads. After developing its strategic thermonuclear devices, North Korea would have enough HEU remaining to manufacture 51–165 single-stage nuclear warheads, thereby also potentially addressing its regional objectives (which could be 80–200 warheads, although if underlying assumptions change, this goal could change as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is clear that North Korea is still operating under some fissile-material constraints, especially regarding plutonium, both the strategic and tactical/battlefield objectives have either been met or are approaching nuclear material sufficiency. The state could therefore decide to work within the current fissile-material inventory and determine that its weapons demands have been sufficiently met at this point, without any further expansion of nuclear material production. Alternatively, North Korea could continue producing fissile material at a quick pace to either: catch up to full current demands if they have not yet been met; exceed its defence demands and maintain an excess stockpile of fissile material without expanding the weapons arsenal; or restructure its nuclear strategy to continue to add defence capabilities to fit its fissile-material supply. However, as North Korea moves from an early-stage programme a more established one, like other nuclear states it will likely continue to make nuclear material in excess of defence needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a handful of arsenal options that North Korea may be considering. Without more information, it is not possible to know precisely what North Korea is trying to achieve with its nuclear weapons programme. This analysis provides an analytical framework and points of discussion to stimulate a transparent and detailed conversation about the types of choices and trade-offs that North Korea is making on nuclear force structure and fissile-material production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-recommended-research&quot;&gt;Future Recommended Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several follow-on analyses that would be beneficial to better understand some underexplored areas that ONN identified while developing this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of North Korea’s nuclear strategy further into the future (that is, 15–20 years) is already underway to consider how the state might expand and structure its NFC to meet its long-term fissile-material demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some history of North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme was considered to provide clarity on present realities, a more in-depth analysis of the entire history of the programme using the analytical methodology presented here (combining demand- and supply-side analyses) would provide additional clarity on present and future North Korean nuclear arsenals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional area for exploration is the interaction between nuclear-warhead development and delivery-system development. While some consideration of delivery vehicles were factored into this paper’s analysis as context, a more detailed look would aid in discovering further details about North Korea’s current and planned nuclear weapons programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both the nuclear and missile programmes, it would be advantageous to analyse potential external programme assistance, as any assistance could affect the assumptions of this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, additional investigation into the other potential weaponisation constraints is needed. While there is some published research on North Korea’s lithium and tritium production capabilities, further research is needed into its: beryllium supply and refinement capabilities; high-explosives manufacturing and testing facilities; weapons-relevant modelling and simulation codes; and additional weaponisation-relevant technologies. Further investigating North Korea’s capabilities in all NFC-relevant material, equipment and technologies, especially those related to uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing, would provide a fully comprehensive picture of the state of North Korea’s civilian and military nuclear programmes, and would be a much-needed information source for external analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further research in these areas could help to clarify some of the uncertainties on the issues presented in this paper and could help raise the global community’s awareness and understanding of additional aspects of North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves a good competition. There is a reason the Olympic Games have been around for millennia. It is human nature to compete, compare performances, and strive for improvement. The commercial remote sensing arena is not immune. When the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) released a public product comparing the performance of commercial satellite imaging systems in 2021 — what came to be known as the “Commercial Imaging Olympics” — the outcomes were surprising. U.S. systems won “gold” in only three of the nine categories of performance, with Chinese systems also earning three gold medals. The results informed discussion and elicited actions within both the U.S. space industry and the U.S. government to make changes in support of a stronger industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this, four leading institutions — the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Taylor Geospatial Institute, Taylor Geospatial Engine, and United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation — collaborated to independently produce a “Top 3” ranking of the world’s best commercial space-based remote sensing systems in 2024. The results should spur discussions on the state of U.S. leadership and global competition among commercial space providers and serve as an indicator of the relative strength of a nation’s remote sensing offerings within the global space economy. While the project team developed a new and distinct research methodology and ranking system rooted in well-understood technical performance parameters, the format of the results honors both the spirit of the Olympic Games and the original product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2024 assessment centers largely on advances in U.S. and Chinese remote sensing systems. Of 11 performance categories, Chinese systems garnered the gold medal in five areas and U.S. systems in four areas, with Finland and South Korea each securing a gold medal. Nearly half of the podium spots went to satellite systems launched between 2021 and 2024, showing a large amount of dynamism within the last four years and the speed at which more advanced capabilities are being introduced in the global commercial marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Of 11 performance categories, Chinese systems garnered the gold medal in five areas and U.S. systems in four areas, with Finland and South Korea each securing a gold medal.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report discusses actions the U.S. government should take as “a regulator, investor, and customer” to keep U.S. companies at the cutting edge of technology and globally competitive. With a nascent commercial market, the government is the primary customer and market driver. It will need to take a more strategic and active role in advancing commercial capabilities that must endure and be competitive against Chinese commercial offerings, among others. This means building multiyear budget profiles for commercial remote sensing to create a stable demand signal, harmonizing government investment and private capital, aligning executive and legislative branch support, improving access to financial tools common in other economic sectors, and continuing to reform U.S. export policies and regulations. The report further highlights that U.S. national interests are also advanced through greater collaboration with allies and partners in commercial remote sensing, and explores the benefits of foreign companies establishing a greater presence in the United States and sharing their technological advancements and business innovations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has long been the global leader in space, the 2024 medal winners spotlight the continued advancement of China’s remote sensing capabilities and the expansion of its commercial space sector. Commercial remote sensing is one dimension of a broader space competition as Beijing continues to execute its vision of leading the world in space, among other key technology sectors. The stakes are high. Should any one country dominate the commercial remote sensing market, not only could it gain economic advantages, but it would also control the information narrative about the entire planet, from the environment to natural resources to human conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has long been the global leader in space, that lead is being challenged as nations vie for the same economic, security, and industrial benefits from space capabilities that the United States has long enjoyed. The proliferation of space technologies, decreasing launch costs, diffusion of capital, and stimulating government policies are affording more nations the opportunity to compete in space, with some countries — in recent years — taking surprising new leadership roles in space-based remote sensing. Further, the expanding privatization of the space-based remote sensing sector is creating increasing supply and competition in the international marketplace. Should any one country dominate the commercial remote sensing market, not only could it gain economic and security advantages, but it would also control the information narrative about the entire planet, from the environment to natural resources to human conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) sought to understand trends in the global remote sensing marketplace. In 2021, it produced a ranking of commercial remote sensing systems across various categories of performance: a “satellite Olympics” that coincided with the 2021 Summer Olympics. The NGA product was informative and well received by the government, industry, and academia. It challenged assumptions by policymakers, many of whom “assumed that U.S. companies would be industry leaders across the board.” Yet, U.S. systems won “gold” in only three of the nine categories. The 2021 product spurred important conversations about the importance of U.S. leadership in commercial remote sensing and, according to some U.S. companies, prompted new investments to accelerate developments in certain areas of remote sensing where the United States appeared to lag the rest of the world in technology. The product also reinforced changes to U.S. government regulatory policy and prompted an emphasis on a “competitive and burgeoning U.S. commercial space sector” that was described in the United States Space Priorities Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Should any one country dominate the commercial remote sensing market, not only could it gain economic and security advantages, but it would also control the information narrative about the entire planet, from the environment to natural resources to human conflict.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed in just three years. To understand the latest trends, a collaborative team from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Taylor Geospatial Institute, Taylor Geospatial Engine, and United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation conducted an independent assessment of the world’s best commercial remote sensing systems — shining a spotlight on those companies and nations that are leading the world in capturing knowledge of Earth and the activities upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To produce a ranking of the world’s best commercial space-based remote sensing systems, the authors developed a methodology to quantitatively assess satellite performance using commonly understood and widely used technical performance parameters for remote sensing. The assessment covered eleven categories of performance across electro-optical (EO), synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and infrared (IR) modalities. Nine categories are similar to those used by NGA in 2021, and two categories have been added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance parameters relevant to each category include technical factors such as spatial resolution, spectral resolution, number of imaging bands, and the number of operational satellites (or persistence of imaging), among others. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) uses many of these parameters in evaluating commercial remote sensing license applications and in its benchmarking of foreign remote sensing systems. In each category, the top performers were scored, ranked, and awarded gold, silver, and bronze medals. A company’s national flag corresponds to the state or organization under which its satellite system is registered, as captured by the United Nations, and from where the majority of its satellite constellation and operations are regulated. While the authors recognize that several foreign companies have established U.S. subsidiaries to pursue greater business opportunities within the United States, they were still attributed to a national team based upon satellite registration and licensing. Foreign companies that have established U.S. subsidiaries are recognized for sharing their technical and business innovations with the United States, promoting greater alliance and partnership opportunities, and increasing the overall competitiveness of the market. The one exception made this year is for Satellogic, which is dual-flagged as both a U.S. and Uruguayan competitor due to unique circumstances of redomiciling in the United States, maintaining Uruguayan registration with the United Nations, and subjecting its entire satellite constellation to NOAA licensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To qualify for this assessment, only those space-based remote sensing systems that were privately owned and currently operating (i.e., not owned and operated by a government entity) and offering a product or service available to the commercial market as of July 1, 2024, were included in the dataset. The authors relied on information that was publicly available and — recognizing that the accuracy and opacity of information can vary — sought to corroborate data across multiple sources, confirm technical specifications, and capture true performance data to the maximum extent possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report makes comparisons to the 2021 NGA rankings, as provided in NGA’s publicly released and discussed rankings chart. While the methodologies may differ, the project team makes such comparisons buoyed by the fact that there are a limited number of key technical parameters needed to evaluate performance in categories such as EO imaging resolution and SAR revisit, and those technical parameters are often made publicly available in product specification sheets, press releases, and other information disclosed by companies. When necessary, companies were contacted directly to verify and fill in gaps in satellite system information, which in some cases was essential in determining podium rankings. The research team did not contact Chinese system owners, which could introduce both favorable and unfavorable effects for Chinese systems in the rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While striving to compare objective technical parameters with a repeatable methodology, the authors acknowledge that it is impossible to do so perfectly. Choices were made for how to score performance in each category and for selecting the definitions of the categories themselves. Challenges to this methodology and rankings are to be expected and encouraged, and the authors are receptive to engaging with companies and other experts to inform future iterations of the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the authors recognize that many U.S. and foreign commercial remote sensing systems are dual use, with companies selling data and services both in the commercial marketplace and to governments. Those companies may offer even higher-end capabilities to government customers that they do not make commercially available, but such capabilities were outside the scope of this assessment. Further, while including government systems might provide different outcomes at a different classification level (this project was completed based solely on non-classified, publicly accessible information), the purpose of this effort was to examine the state of competition among commercial providers alone as an indicator of the relative market strength of a nation’s remote sensing offerings within the global space economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year’s assessment centers largely on advances in U.S. and Chinese remote sensing systems. Of the eleven performance categories, Chinese systems garnered the gold medal in five and U.S. systems in four, with Finland and South Korea each securing a gold medal. Nearly half of the podium spots went to satellite systems launched between 2021 and 2024, showing a large amount of movement within the last four years and more advanced capabilities being introduced in the global commercial marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electro-optical-eo-systems&quot;&gt;Electro-Optical (EO) Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notable in the EO categories is China’s rise to gold in EO imaging capability, with its SuperView Neo-1 system, launched in 2022, offering a commercial product that combines high-resolution imagery with the largest constellation collection capacity. Because there is now a clustering of commercial systems able to capture native 30-centimeter (cm) imagery, additional performance factors such as collection capacity (at this resolution) provide further differentiation in the global market. While the U.S. WorldView-3 system (launched in 2014) still remains on the podium, Maxar’s WorldView Legion constellation is likely to compete for the top spot in future assessments once its products become commercially available. The first two satellites in the Legion constellation were launched in May 2024, and two more launched in August 2024. Expected to launch in 2025 are the first commercial EO imaging systems going to very low Earth orbit — from Albedo Space and EOI Space — a move which will significantly improve their imaging resolution and enable them to be highly competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s Jilin-1 EO systems hold the top spot in EO revisit, owing to its large constellation of over 100 operational satellites in orbit. In the EO video category, the latest generation U.S. SkySat system earns gold when accounting for its enhanced product offerings tied to frame rate, dwell time, and spatial resolution. While not on the podium due to its products not being available on the commercial market, Japan’s CE-SAT-1E system, operated by Canon Electronics and launched in 2024, receives an honorable mention for its high frame rate performance and innovative design. A noteworthy trend is a growing group of EO constellations offering sub 1-meter imagery at higher revisit rates. One such example is the U.S. BlackSky Global constellation that, while not on this year’s podium, will be one to watch as it and other constellations optimize different performance parameters to increase the value of remote sensing to end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;synthetic-aperture-radar-sar-systems&quot;&gt;Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAR performance was the most challenging to assess, given the complexity of the data collected in radar pulses and the relative opacity of Chinese technical data. The authors used a benchmark that the NOAA Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs (CRSRA) has adopted in its regulatory process, an equation to calculate information density contained in a SAR dataset called the Radar Generalized Image Quality Equation, and drew heavily on NOAA published data to rank the top foreign remote sensing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAR X-band imaging performance saw a complete shake-up on the podium this year, with the three medalists being all new systems — U.S. Umbra SAR (gold), U.S. Capella Space Acadia (silver), and Finnish ICEYE Generation 3 (bronze) — launched in the 2022–2023 timeframe. Similarly, the same three companies were top performers in SAR revisit, with ICEYE outpacing the competition due to its larger constellation size. This is a stark contrast to just seven years ago when, as described in an Aerospace Corporation report, it was observed that “U.S.-based companies are not participants in the competition for commercial radar imagery due to domestic regulatory limitations that so far have been an insurmountable barrier to entry.” With NOAA’s regulatory reforms in 2020 and the removal of further restrictions on X-band SAR data sales in 2023, U.S. companies quickly become top performers in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese firms have made less progress in X-band SAR, they lead the pack in C-band SAR. C-band SAR provides lower-resolution radar imagery over larger areas and is particularly useful for environmental analysis, including global mapping, landform changes, and ocean monitoring. The aging Canadian RADARSAT-2 satellite earned a bronze medal and its follow-on system, the CHORUS-C satellite from MDA Space, is expected to compete favorably in future rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that all commercial SAR companies will approach a resolution limit based on spectrum constraints set by the International Telecommunication Union. With resolution and dwell time approaching technical limits, where commercial SAR companies go next in offering differentiated performance and products over their competitors will soon make these comparisons more complicated and diverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spectral-systems&quot;&gt;Spectral Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multispectral and hyperspectral podiums tell two different stories. In multispectral, China’s SuperView Neo-3 received the gold medal, but the competition in this category was tight. All three podium winners appear to offer similar capabilities, with China’s Siwei and the second-place finisher, U.S./Uruguay Satellogic, both launching their top performers in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hyperspectral capability was a category that, in NGA’s 2021 assessment, showed no competitive U.S. system. In 2024, a U.S. system is now atop the podium with GHOSt satellites developed and operated by the U.S. company Orbital Sidekick. And an Indian system, Pixxel, is in receipt of the silver medal. Performance parameters for hyperspectral systems can often be in tension, making direct comparisons challenging. Some systems are designed for higher spatial resolution to aid in discovering smaller targets while others are optimized for finer spectral resolution (i.e., spectral density) to characterize specific materials and hydrocarbons and find them over larger areas. In future iterations of this analysis, it will likely be appropriate to separate hyperspectral systems into two unique categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;infrared-ir-systems&quot;&gt;Infrared (IR) Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the IR remote sensing categories, short-wave infrared (SWIR) appears largely unchanged from NGA’s 2021 rankings. WorldView-3 remains the leader, driven by its resolution performance, as many U.S. companies have shied away from SWIR offerings due to long-standing regulatory restrictions. While not reflected on the podium, several countries have or are developing commercial SWIR systems that could alter these results within the year. In contrast, fewer companies are pursuing mid-wave infrared (MWIR) remote sensing systems. The South Korean KOMPSAT-3A — a system launched in 2015 — was then and still sits now atop the podium. Chinese systems launched in 2018 and 2019 took silver and bronze, respectively, with lower resolution offerings than KOMPSAT-3A. Despite a smaller competitive pool at present, there are MWIR efforts by British, German, and U.S. companies worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the category of long-wave infrared (LWIR), Chinese commercial systems are dominant. Much of the utility of LWIR remote sensing is in applications such as climate change, agriculture, and wildfire monitoring. Changes to U.S. regulatory restrictions on infrared imaging will enable U.S. companies to test this commercial market, with two U.S. companies planning to launch systems in 2025 capable of imaging in the LWIR spectral range: Albedo Space and Muon Space. Both could be future medal contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ciIVYZ3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Trends in the Medal Rankings.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither the United States nor China has a clear across-the-board lead in commercial remote sensing. In comparison to NGA’s 2021 rankings, U.S. companies have made the greatest positive movement in X-band SAR, hyperspectral capability, and EO video. Government contracts, strategic investments (from both private and U.S. government-related entities), and U.S. policy and regulatory relief appear to have played formative roles in the acceleration of these improved commercial capabilities over the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Chinese companies moved up the podium in EO imaging and multispectral capabilities, and they hold dominant positions in LWIR and C-band SAR. The authors cannot definitively explain China’s dominance and the absence of U.S. or other Western commercial entrants. However, space-based remote sensing using C-band SAR and LWIR instruments for environmental and scientific applications has long been a core competency of Western civil space agencies, such as NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite weather satellites and the European Commission-European Space Agency Copernicus initiative, with fewer commercial market opportunities. Important to watch will be progress by U.S. companies like Albedo Space and Muon Space, and their ability to disrupt the IR results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bueiQSp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;The payload stack for the SpaceX Transporter 11 mission launched on August 16, 2024, included new satellites from Planet, Satellogic, Capella, and Umbra, among others.&lt;/strong&gt; Photo: Planet Labs PBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are commercial remote sensing systems currently flying as demonstration systems or launched since July 1, 2024, that are on the cusp of operational capability and were not eligible for inclusion in these results. Established U.S. companies like Maxar and Planet launched WorldView Legion EO imagers and a Tanager hyperspectral system, respectively, and new-to-market companies will soon begin to offer commercial IR data and products. It is more difficult to predict new capabilities coming from Chinese aerospace companies, though they are expected to continue improving their commercial offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding China, are Chinese companies focusing efforts on assessed niches where little competition exists, or is their progress reflective of a broader strategy by Beijing to advance on myriad space-based remote sensing fronts? The authors believe it is both when looking holistically at the presence of Chinese companies across these categories, the numerous systems that did not medal but are in orbit or in development, and trends in other areas of commercial space. While U.S. analysts tend to focus on the People’s Liberation Army’s developments in space, China’s commercial space sector is also rapidly expanding — enabled by leadership priority, national policy, government funding and incentives, and private capital. China is likely intent on dominating this medal count in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-discussion&quot;&gt;Policy Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The fundamental goal of this policy is to advance and protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests by maintaining the nation’s leadership in remote sensing space activities, and by sustaining and enhancing the U.S. remote sensing industry.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-us-commercial-remote-sensing-policy-april-25-2003&quot;&gt;— U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Policy, April 25, 2003&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assessment considered worldwide commercial space-based remote sensing systems and produced a ranking of the world’s best. As the overall medal count shows, the dominant front-runners are Chinese and U.S. companies. While the United States has long been the global leader in space, Beijing has declared its intent for China to lead the world in space. Commercial remote sensing is but one dimension of a broader space competition, from Earth to the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions for policymakers include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What issues will shape the long-term viability of these commercial remote sensing companies?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What role should the U.S. government play in creating opportunities for U.S. companies that strengthen their overall viability and global competitiveness?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is at stake for U.S. national interests if the United States loses ground in this important area of technology and commerce?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Policy, unchanged since 2003, articulates the objective of “advanc[ing] and protect[ing] U.S. national security and foreign policy interests by maintaining the nation’s leadership in remote sensing space activities, and by sustaining and enhancing the U.S. remote sensing industry.” Furthermore, the first policy goal listed in the more recent 2020 National Space Policy is that the United States shall “promote and incentivize private industry to . . . strengthen and preserve the position of the United States as the global partner of choice for international space commerce.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might take away from these 2024 Commercial Remote Sensing Global Rankings that, in general, the U.S. remote sensing industry is performing well and that its position has improved from three years ago. Companies from the United States or its allies medal in nearly all categories, new systems are soon coming online (e.g., Maxar’s WorldView Legion) that will be top contenders in the international marketplace, and U.S. companies are high performers in key categories that the U.S. government relies upon (e.g., EO and SAR). However, given the current global rankings, it is clear that the United States has not fully achieved its stated policy goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there is also fragility and acute competition across the ecosystem with global security and economic consequences. The 2024 rankings provide a snapshot in time with mixed trends. Four Chinese systems and four U.S. systems each make their podium debut this year, having been launched in 2021 or later. While U.S.-flagged companies gained in the rankings in several categories when compared to 2021 (e.g., EO video and hyperspectral capability), they lost ground in others (e.g., EO imaging). The 2024 Commercial Remote Sensing Global Rankings published here highlight the challenges ahead for the U.S. government to leverage all tools at its disposal to achieve U.S. national policy goals in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-as-a-regulator-investor-and-customer&quot;&gt;Government as a ‘Regulator, Investor, and Customer’&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three government stimulants occurred in the past four years that appear to have played formative roles in the acceleration of U.S. commercial capabilities and, very likely, this year’s podium results: government policy and regulation, strategic investments, and government contracts. This mirrors observations made by the Defense Science Board in a May 2024 report on commercial space access and integrity, where they see the role of government as “a regulator, investor, and customer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First in 2020 and later in 2023, NOAA implemented licensing reforms that removed several restrictions on the ability of commercial remote sensing companies to sell their more advanced and competitive products. For example, it removed all “temporary conditions” on X-band SAR, the practical effect being that U.S. companies could, according to the president of one U.S. SAR company, “offer customers the highest resolution images that our satellites are capable of capturing.” U.S. company Albedo Space, in 2021, was granted a first-of-its-kind NOAA license to sell 10 cm resolution EO imagery, a leap forward from today’s 30 cm offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A philosophical shift is occurring, with U.S. government regulators accounting for the need to keep U.S. industry in the lead amid a tightening global competition. These global rankings show the speed at which the overall sector is moving and how both U.S. and foreign companies are seeking to push the performance envelope. Roughly half of this year’s top performers were systems launched in the last four years alone. While trends in U.S. policy and regulations are positive, they must continue to lead and pace, not lag. NOAA regulators should now work to remove the remaining technical restrictions on U.S. remote sensing systems and, like other nations, regulate more directly to whom they can sell their data. This would open a new era of technical innovation and dominant performance for the U.S. commercial remote sensing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the sector saw an influx of private capital in recent years that fueled many of the systems atop this year’s podium. According to market analysis firm BryceTech, 2021 was a high watermark for private capital entering the commercial space sector, including through the use of special-purpose acquisition company vehicles, which raised capital for a few U.S. companies featured in this report. The investment firm In-Q-Tel, whose aim is to transition intelligence and defense-relevant technologies from the private to the public sector, also made strategic investments in commercial remote sensing companies during this time. In 2022, In-Q-Tel invested in U.S. company Orbital Sidekick to advance its hyperspectral capabilities, with previous strategic investments including U.S. firm Capella Space (2017), Finnish firm ICEYE (2021), and British firm SatVu (2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Three government stimulants occurred in the past four years that appear to have played formative roles in the acceleration of U.S. commercial capabilities and, very likely, this year’s podium results: government policy and regulation, strategic investments, and government contracts.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the investment landscape is becoming more challenging. Commercial space investments in North America are decreasing overall, with investors not seeing a return on their capital and the markets growing slower than they anticipated. Without a continued influx of capital — satellite development and operations are capital intensive — U.S. companies will be hard-pressed to invest in further technological advancements, which could limit their future competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the U.S. government awarded a large contract for commercial EO imagery. In 2022, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) awarded “its largest-ever commercial imagery contract. . . . Valued at billions of dollars over the next decade” to three U.S. companies with commercial EO systems. The NRO has also outlined plans to purchase other sensing modalities, like SAR, hyperspectral imagery, and radiofrequency mapping, but has not yet followed through with an expanded demand signal and program of record like it has for EO. Meanwhile, the U.S. Space Force is beginning to acquire commercial remote sensing data and analytics to provide “tactical support of unified combatant commands as directed by the recent Tac ISR/SRT [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance/surveillance, reconnaissance, and tracking] initiative,” but also lacks clarity on scale, funding, and timelines. Additionally, NGA plans to procure commercial analytic services through a program named Luno, creating a further market demand signal for geospatial data and value-added products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;projecting-ahead&quot;&gt;Projecting Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projecting ahead, one might read market forecasts with headlines that the space economy is “booming” and think there is no need for concern; the market is strong. After all, a 2024 World Economic Forum report projects the global space economy will grow to $1.8 trillion by 2035, with space-based Earth observation revenue more than tripling from $2 billion in 2023 to $9 billion annually by 2035, driven by increasing demand for value-added services like analytic insights and tailored products. One firm noted that, “The demand for EO imagery remains the highest in the defence and intelligence (D&amp;amp;I) vertical.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, this forecasted demand signal from the U.S. government has not translated into sustained investment. U.S. companies are capturing small, initial government contracts but are finding it hard to secure substantial follow-on contracts. Without an ability to forecast long-term revenue, these companies will be challenged to attract capital to continue advancing their technology and product offerings. Even further, without a near-term demand signal, there is uncertainty about whether current companies will survive to realize the forecasted market opportunities in the decade ahead. It has already affected commercial SAR. Two U.S. SAR companies earned medals this year — Umbra and Capella Space — with ICEYE (headquartered in Finland with a U.S. subsidiary) also earning a podium spot. However, other U.S. companies have scrapped plans to deploy SAR satellites in the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government is still a powerful market actor with an ability to shape the commercial marketplace and assure the long-term sustainability of private industry, consistent with its policy goals. The Defense Science Board observed that “the government can be indispensable as an anchor tenant and source of a stable demand signal” for “nascent markets emerging from traditionally government missions . . . for which there may be limited early pure commercial demand.” To keep U.S. companies atop the podium and globally competitive, the government will need to wield its power as a customer, investor, and regulator more strategically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aligning government investment and private capital is a good place to start. Today’s systems benefited from an influx of capital, including unprecedented private capital that entered the commercial space sector in 2021. Further investment now will determine the most advanced systems on the podium three years from now. The government is the primary customer and market driver with a nascent commercial market. It will need to take a more active role in investing in commercial capabilities that must endure and be competitive against Chinese commercial offerings, among others. This means building multiyear budget profiles for commercial remote sensing to create a stable procurement demand signal and aligning executive and legislative branch support. Such a demand signal should be used strategically to drive early capital investments that accelerate technological advancements and innovative solutions ahead of planned government contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To keep U.S. companies atop the podium and globally competitive, the government will need to wield its power as a customer, investor, and regulator more strategically.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government can also better integrate commercial capabilities into its architectures to increase the diversity of sources, add capacity, and improve mission resiliency. However, so long as commercial data and products are treated separately and perceived as costly to access, whereas government data is “free,” users will not embrace it. The user experience should be seamless from tasking to delivery, whether they are accessing commercial or government-collected remote sensing information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A closer partnership with investors can also seed advancements, whether to improve capabilities in existing areas of U.S. strength or nurture U.S. companies into new areas altogether. For example, new hyperspectral medal winner GHOSt, developed by U.S. company Orbital Sidekick, was bolstered by a strategic investment from the global security venture firm In-Q-Tel in early 2022 and a U.S. Department of Defense Strategic Funding Increase award in 2020, which private investment funds matched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for those U.S. companies atop the podium, revisions to U.S. export policies and processes — beyond NOAA’s regulatory reforms — will continue to be necessary for selling their superior capabilities in the rapidly growing international marketplace. There is international demand, particularly from allied and partner governments that see procurement of commercial systems as a way to accelerate their own sovereign space capabilities. However, ITAR continues to hamper U.S. companies as they pursue these international business opportunities. The ongoing U.S. government review of space export controls holds promise. But, as this year’s podium shows, it is important to recognize the global diffusion of remote sensing technology and speed of progress; U.S. export restrictions have not slowed advancements by Chinese firms, who, in some areas, lead U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of international demand, Poland recently acquired two French Pléiades Neo satellite systems (the 2024 silver medalist for EO imaging). Not only could such contracts expand revenue for U.S. companies, putting less pressure on the U.S. government as an anchor tenant, but they build opportunities for greater interoperability with allies and partners, and prevent China from further expanding its market reach. The U.S. government holds significant sway as an advocate of U.S. industry. It should aggressively promote its commercial remote sensing sector abroad, as it does for other areas of U.S. industry. Further, to expand international business opportunities, especially vis-à-vis China, greater use of investment and financing levers such as the Export-Import Bank of the United States should be encouraged within the commercial space sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States regards its allies and partners as an “asymmetric advantage that our competitors can never hope to match.” Although Americans want to see U.S. flags atop the rankings, and beat their friends in competition, U.S. national interests are also advanced and U.S. leadership demonstrated through greater collaboration with allies and partners. Notably, there is a lack of Five Eyes partners and NATO countries on the podium, despite Europe’s long-standing space aptitude. Japan is injecting capital into its space industry to advance capabilities for its security and economic benefit. Many of these allies and partners possess cutting-edge technologies and are making investments in space-based remote sensing. Friendly countries looking to expand their commercial remote sensing capabilities should be encouraged, with this report being a helpful guide to put more friendly flags on the podium that complement U.S. systems and compete vis-à-vis China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the government must be mindful that it can have a deleterious effect on the market as a competitor to industry. Mantras like “exploit what we have, buy what we can, and build only what we must” from the U.S. Space Force are encouraging, but the contribution of commercial capabilities and services must be integrated throughout requirements, acquisition, and operational processes to avoid the government pursuing systems that compete directly with what the commercial sector can offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-the-stakes&quot;&gt;What Are the Stakes?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“China’s commercial space sector is growing quickly and is on pace to become a major global competitor by 2030.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-annual-threat-assessment-of-the-us-intelligence-community-2024&quot;&gt;— Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, 2024&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assessment shows the dynamism occurring in the sector and how rapidly the technology is advancing. Without deliberate actions by the U.S. government, as discussed above, it is not guaranteed that U.S. flags will remain atop the podium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is intent on being the world’s leading space power by 2049. Beijing is rapidly expanding its government and commercial space sectors, accelerated by political direction from President Xi Jinping himself, government-wide prioritization, large state and private investments, regulatory leeway, and technology theft. Beijing sees its commercial companies as a way to bring technology innovation into the government and, consistent with its civil-military fusion strategy, to improve its military capabilities. Its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is creating new markets for Chinese goods and services, and its commercial space companies “will continue attempts to undercut the price of Western firms in more competitive markets,” according to the U.S. intelligence community. Rising nations may look to acquire Chinese remote sensing systems, or data and services from those systems, for their own security, economic, and environmental needs and leverage already established BRI relationships and infrastructure. Should China take the mantle of global leadership in space, whether in remote sensing or communications, it is expected to spread its own techno-authoritarian norms and standards, grow its influence in international governance and standards bodies, and extend its surveillance model into orbit. Simply put, U.S. leadership here matters. The competition in commercial remote sensing is emblematic of the broader strategic interests at stake for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;way-ahead&quot;&gt;Way Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intent of the 2024 Commercial Remote Sensing Global Rankings is to spur a discussion on U.S. leadership, take stock of the state of global competition, and consider ways in which the government tool kit can be used to keep U.S. companies at the cutting edge of technology and globally competitive. According to a recent article in the MIT Technology Review, a “country’s economic security — its ability to generate both national security and economic prosperity — is grounded in it having significant technological capabilities that outpace those of its adversaries and complement those of its allies.” The authors want the results of the 2024 global rankings to generate deeper conversations across the public and private sectors on the importance of U.S. leadership in this area of economic, technological, and national security significance and the longer-term consequences should this leadership erode. These global rankings should also motivate closer discussions between the government and investment community on how government resources and private capital can work together to keep U.S. companies outpacing and out-innovating the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 2024 assessment is an initial effort to characterize the state of global commercial remote sensing capabilities. While this product focused strictly on the technical performance of remote sensing collection systems, the project team intends to expand the research effort to spotlight recent market advancements and technological trends that will impact the value of commercial remote sensing information delivered to customers. New collection modalities should be explored, including radio frequency, non-Earth imaging, and variations in hyperspectral remote sensing, as well as capabilities such as virtual constellations that aggregate multiple modalities of remote sensing information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The intent of the 2024 Commercial Remote Sensing Global Rankings is to spur a discussion on U.S. leadership, take stock of the state of global competition, and consider ways in which the government tool kit can be used to keep U.S. companies at the cutting edge of technology and globally competitive.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, this study’s repeatable, objective research methodology could be expanded to assess companies’ efforts to move up the value chain, such as the timeliness of information delivery, the range of data sources used in multisource analysis, and the relative value of highly automated analytic products and services — focusing on outputs rather than inputs. As several market forecasts predict, demand in the Earth observation market will grow in value-added services, such as “data processing, data fusion and tailored products,” to meet user demand for analytic insights. Feedback and reader interest will help determine the future direction of this research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how the United States finds itself in this dynamic and highly competitive global landscape, tremendous commercial remote sensing capabilities have been created that are now ready to shine. Ideally, these companies will continue to spend capital to improve their capabilities. Doing so will enable a new community of private multisource analytics companies who will create even greater economic success and information value in the form of fused products and services that reveal the many changes and behaviors on Earth and the gamut of human activities taking place upon it. The “gold rush” is on, and the future competitiveness of U.S. commercial remote sensing is no longer guaranteed. What happens next will be decided by U.S. government actions through regulation, investment, consumption, and competition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;4認罪被告求情 辯方：蘇緯軒對社會有熱誠、曾比喻社會問題如危樓&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j8YRxN3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年「屠龍」小隊等被指計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警察，遭律政司起訴反恐怖主義條例，他們亦被控「串謀謀殺」警察。陪審團裁定6名被告無罪，1名被告交替罪成。早前有4名被告已認罪，包括兩名「污點證人」蘇緯軒及彭軍壕，4人今（27日）在高等法院求情。辯方指，案發時18歲的蘇緯軒在言談中表達對社會的熱誠，他曾比喻香港社會的問題有如危樓，「唔可以俾危樓起落去」。辯方認為，蘇是天真及正直的年輕人，「以為自己做嘅嘢係啱」。另外，辯方指彭軍壕因任控方證人被單獨囚禁，比一般在囚人士孤單及辛苦。就製作引爆器及接收槍械零件的另兩名被告，法官張慧玲指量刑時不能抹煞背景與2019年反修例事件有關，「知道對抗警方同政府，好難話唔知呢件事，只係貪得意」。案件暫定11月14日判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4名認罪被告為：蘇緯軒、彭軍壕、蔡凱明及陳玉龍。蘇承認「串謀謀殺」、「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」及「使用槍械及彈藥意圖抗拒或阻止合法逮捕」罪。彭承認「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪。蔡承認「協助和教唆製造爆炸品」罪。陳承認「串謀無牌管有槍械及彈藥」及「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方蘇緯軒對社會有熱誠是正直的年輕人&quot;&gt;辯方：蘇緯軒對社會有熱誠、是正直的年輕人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就蘇緯軒，控方讀出其經歷口供，他於2001年在美國出生，現年23歲。他於2019年12月20日被捕，當時任職兼職救生員，被捕前沒有案底。代表蘇的大律師江小菁求情指，對蘇有深刻印象，因蘇被捕後兩人曾於警署聊天。辯方留意到，年僅18歲的蘇在言談中表達對社會的熱誠，他曾比喻指香港社會的問題有如危樓，「唔可以俾危樓起落去」。辯方認為，蘇在她心目中是天真及正直的年輕人，「以為自己做嘅嘢係啱」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方蘇案發時年輕易受影響事後知道行為魯莽&quot;&gt;辯方：蘇案發時年輕易受影響、事後知道行為魯莽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，本案不幸中的大幸是蘇的人生觀因而改變，他的求學態度變得積極，亦修補了與父親的關係。辯方補充，蘇曾經與父親關係緊張，認為父親不理解他，起初拒絕父親探訪，後來破冰。辯方指她見證蘇的成長，蘇後來發現之往接收的訊息並非絕對正確，亦知道自己行為魯莽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方強調，沒有打算淡化案情的嚴重性，但蘇於案發時較其他被告年輕，思想較為天真，且容易受人影響。辯方最後指，「（蘇）佢嘅人生路仲係好長，而家23歲，佢明白離開監獄要面對社會，希望努力讀書彌補之前嘅錯」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭軍壕因任控方證人被單獨囚禁較孤單及辛苦&quot;&gt;辯方：彭軍壕因任控方證人被單獨囚禁、較孤單及辛苦&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就彭軍壕，控方讀出其經歷口供，他於1986年在香港出生，現年38歲，被捕前沒有案底，完成中三學歷。他於2020年1月被捕，當時無業。辯方指，彭的父親及胞妹今天到法庭支持他，惟母親在他還柙期間去世。辯方又指，明白判刑需要反映案情嚴重性，亦知道刑期不短，但希望法庭接納彭有悔意，亦很快表示願意做控方證人。在彭決定擔任控方證人後，他被單獨囚禁，比一般在囚人士孤單及辛苦。彭在鐵窗下生活了4年8個月，成為終身不能磨滅的烙印，其重犯機會微乎其微，「有生之年唔會再犯」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指蔡凱明知道製作引爆器是為反抗政府&quot;&gt;官指蔡凱明知道製作引爆器是為反抗政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就蔡凱明，控方讀出其經歷口供，他於1999年於內地出生，2003年來港定居，現年25歲。蔡修畢機械工程高級文憑，案發時任職倉務員。蔡於被捕時被發現電話內藏有兒童色情物品，並於2024年被判囚6個月。辯方表示，蔡還柙至今已4年5個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲指，考慮判刑時不能抹煞本案背景與2019年反修例事件有關，「知道對抗警方同政府，好難話唔知呢件事，只係貪得意」，雖然他們並不知道本案的串謀，但被告的行為確實與串謀相關。辯方同意。張官又指蔡製作引爆器的行為或牽涉暴動，從他與同案被告吳智鴻及賴振邦的對話可見，蔡知道製作引爆器是為了反抗政府並達到「五大訴求」。辯方同意被告知悉其行為與社會事件有關，但他對背後目的及串謀的規模並不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方無證據顯示陳玉龍藏槍打算作非法用途&quot;&gt;辯方：無證據顯示陳玉龍藏槍打算作非法用途&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳玉龍，辯方讀出其經歷口供。陳於1992年在港出生，現年32歲，中五學歷。他於2020年被捕，案發時任職技術人員。辯方求情指，陳的親友為他撰寫求情信，形容他積極面對困難，沒有放棄自己，希望出獄後照顧家人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官引述案情指，陳在本案中不斷協助其他被告接收槍械零件的包裹。陳於被捕後表示，每次能獲取蘇給予的200元報酬，他以為包裹內的是玩具。辯方確認，陳事後同意知道包裹內的是槍械零件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，陳管有一支裝有14粒子彈的真槍，並管有近百發彈藥。張官表示很難接受屬於收藏性質，辯方則同意沒有證據證明他打算作非法用途，惟背景確實牽涉2019年社會事件，很難撇除他完全沒有非法意圖。辯方強調，沒有證據證明陳有參與其他活動；張官表示串謀牽涉很多人及角色，沒有證據顯示本案被告知道串謀，但他們的行為始終對串謀有幫助。張官另指，被告沒有可能不知道槍械與社會事件有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪，上月被裁定罪成，今於區域法院判刑。早上已有不少市民到場輪候，有前立場員工形容兩人「decent」、「有禮貌」，「畀好大嘅自由度所有記者」，又憶述早前見面時鐘沛權精神狀態不俗，惟林紹桐「好明顯咁瘦咗好多」，望兩人保重，「就算佢哋入返去，我哋都會再見。」記協前主席岑倚蘭亦望到場支持兩人：「讓佢哋唔好覺得孤單，留喺香港啲行家繼續出現，撐佢哋囉」，又指結果雖很多時令人失望，但「心存盼望囉，風雨總會有消除嘅一日」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;身穿深藍色裇衫、卡其色褲的鍾沛權，今近12時半到達法院。而裁決日因病獲准缺席的林紹桐，則穿白色長袖裇衫、深綠色褲、戴白口罩，於約1時許到達，身形明顯較之前消瘦。辯方早前求情時透露，林患嚴重疾病需接受化療。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;市民一早到場輪候公眾旁聽席&quot;&gt;市民一早到場輪候公眾旁聽席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件於下午2時半開庭，《獨媒》早上約7時到場，法院地下已有約9名市民排隊。排首名的市民「姨婆」居於葵涌，由2019年開始旁聽法庭案件，今早約6時到場，她指「牆入面嗰啲，每一個對我哋都係好重要，甚至係一個人我哋都要去聽，去話俾佢聽『有我哋響度』」。她希望向兩人說「希望佢哋身體健康」、「祝佢哋平安」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早上約9時，旁聽隊已達40多人，當中有一部分為中年人士，記者問他們旁聽什麼案件，均不獲回應。現場多次發生爭執，有人打算插隊被其他人士揭發，亦有多個位置的人離隊良久，引起市民不滿，稱「冇排隊黨就冇問題啦」。在場保安則解釋措施「人性化」，指由於排隊時間長，允許輪候人士外出散步、用膳等，亦強調保持公平公正的原則，呼籲「唔好幫人排隊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前立場員工指林紹同身體好明顯瘦咗好多&quot;&gt;前立場員工指林紹同身體「好明顯瘦咗好多」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;曾在《立場》工作一年多的前員工葉小姐，坦言感覺「唔好受」，指公司因而結業，經歷這番事件後她亦轉行。以前的她負責法庭新聞，較少到公司工作，但每次開會都會見到兩人，形容他們「decent」、「有禮貌」，亦不會限制記者所編寫的內容及工作，「會畀好大嘅自由度所有記者」，也會給予改善意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;她又指，兩星期前曾與兩人見面，「阿權就應該睇落精神狀態都ok嘅，但係Patrick（林紹桐）就真係好明顯咁瘦咗好多，同埋成個人都好攰囉，好似得返一嚿骨咁樣囉，撐住件衫咁樣。」被問到有什麼想對兩人說，她希望兩人身體健康和保重，「就算佢哋入返去，我哋都會再見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;記協前主席岑倚蘭到場支持心存盼望風雨總有消除一日&quot;&gt;記協前主席岑倚蘭到場支持：心存盼望，風雨總有消除一日&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記協前主席岑倚蘭亦有到場排隊，她表示與鍾沛權相識近30年，在《蘋果日報》任採訪主任已認識其太太陳沛敏，亦見證二人結婚，今早向兩人傳短訊稱「風雨同路，繼續撐你哋，願你哋平安」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑認為，審訊由二十多日延至五十多日，二人被捕至今亦近3年，對二人而言「係好磨人嘅一個過程」。她上星期曾與鍾沛權進餐會面，替他打氣，並擔憂林紹桐的身體狀況：「希望佢唔好再判返入去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;岑又說，對於裁決結果感到「好憤怒」，亦不認同裁決理由：「做新聞工作咋嘛，做到點解要坐監？」她又指，雖然結果「好多時好似好令我哋失望，但係心存盼望囉，風雨總會有消除嘅一日」，她作為新聞工作者亦望繼續支持和同行，指新聞界發生很多事：「讓佢哋唔好覺得孤單，留喺香港啲行家繼續出現，撐佢哋囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;獨立記者稱新聞界早於二人被捕時已受影響&quot;&gt;獨立記者稱新聞界早於二人被捕時已受影響&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;獨立記者鄭思思坦言，對裁決感到失望，亦認為判詞對新聞界進行訪問和時事評論，定下了很多新紅線。被問及會否影響往後的新聞工作，她指「個影響before嗰判決已經有喇」，即使未有判決前，經已無人敢訪問海外流亡人士，「我覺得個影響係早於2021年佢哋被捕，已經會步步為營、自我審查、小心，但個判詞就更加冇改變嗰局面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;居於粉嶺的市民王先生早上約9時半到場，他由提堂開始已旁聽此案三次，指「今日係大概都估到嗰結果，但係都覺得要支持一下」。他形容，《立場新聞》對他而言是一個「獨立的聲音」，用另一個角度去闡述事情，「係我其中一個要睇嘅媒體，但就冇咗喇。」王說，「欣賞佢哋敢講」，能反映他的心聲，並想向鍾沛權和林紹桐說「加油」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪，上月被裁定罪成，今（26日）於區域法院判刑。國安法指定法官郭偉健判處鍾沛權監禁21個月，至於林紹桐以14個月為量刑起點，但考慮其健康狀況，以及入獄可能對他生命有危害，判處他可即時獲得釋放的刑期。《立場》母公司則判罰款5,000元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾沛權和林紹桐已分別還柙11.5個月及10個月9日，意味鍾沛權須即時入獄，如無行為良好三分一扣減，須多服刑9.5個月；林紹桐可獲即時釋放。鍾沛權聞判表現平靜，林紹桐則一度仰天，其妻子激動落淚。散庭時，多人向鍾沛權揮手，鍾沛權逐一揮手回應，又頻頻微笑合十、做OK手勢和豎起拇指。至於《立場》母公司的充公令，將於2025年3月17日處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;裁決日因病缺席-林紹桐明顯消瘦&quot;&gt;裁決日因病缺席 林紹桐明顯消瘦&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;身穿深藍色裇衫、卡其色褲的鍾沛權，今近12時半到達法院。而裁決日因病獲准缺席的林紹桐，則穿白色長袖裇衫、深綠色褲、戴白口罩，於約1時許到達，身形明顯較之前消瘦。辯方早前求情時透露，林患嚴重疾病需接受化療。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;正庭及延伸庭的座位均爆滿，多名前《立場》員工到庭旁聽，另前記協主席岑倚蘭、社民連曾健成、浸大政治及國際關係學系副教授陳家洛、中大政政學院副教授周保松等人，及美國、比利時、歐盟、加拿大、意大利、愛爾蘭及英國等多國領事均有到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;開庭前，多名前《立場》員工在庭外交談，鍾沛權入庭前，各人輪流送上祝福，搭肩說「保重」，鍾亦笑着合十道謝。鍾沛權和林紹桐進入被告欄後，不時交談，狀甚輕鬆、面露笑意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;延遲逾兩小時開庭&quot;&gt;延遲逾兩小時開庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由《國安法》指定法官郭偉健處理，控方代表為高級助理刑事檢控專員伍淑娟，辯方代表為資深大律師余若薇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件原定今午2時半開庭，惟最終延後逾兩小時始開庭。下午4時16分，法庭書記一度步出，並播放法庭錄音，惟4時24分錄音播畢，書記亦離庭。等候期間，鍾沛權、林紹桐及多名旁聽人士均現疲態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指林紹桐病況嚴重-憂再入獄或延誤治療致生命危險&quot;&gt;辯方指林紹桐病況嚴重 憂再入獄或延誤治療致生命危險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件4時41分開庭，資深大律師余若薇進行補充陳詞，就林紹桐的情況呈交3份醫療報告，由瑪麗醫院內科學系主任講座教授、腎病外科主管陳德茂教授，及黎嘉能醫生所撰寫。陳自2020年4月起已是林的主診醫生，指林患「抗嗜中性白血球細胞質抗體」，其身體會產生抗體攻擊自己的血管，雖然2022年經診斷後穩定下來，但今年7月病情惡化，患嚴重狼瘡性腎炎，腎功能少於3成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余引述醫生指，林要經常定期覆診，獲及時適切的治療和藥物才能穩定控制病情，相隔兩周覆診一次；而林一直接受瑪麗醫生治療，若判監無法送往瑪麗治療。余又指，林現時腎炎為第四期，容易進入第五期，屆時如感染、脫水亦可能要洗腎，憂慮如他再入獄，或因延誤治療導致生命危險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望判刑不超出已還柙日數&quot;&gt;辯方望判刑不超出已還柙日數&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余若薇又呈上多個案例，重申鍾沛權和林紹桐分別已還柙349日及313日，若計算行為良好三分一扣減，相等於已服刑16.5個月及15個月，即使控罪最高刑期為2年，二人無論如何已服畢大部分刑期。余又指，二人被捕至今3年，當中國安法案件應盡快處理，林紹桐亦因等候裁決失去出國留學機會；而今年3月《監獄規則》修訂，令被告或未能獲三分一扣減，二人已獲保釋近2年，若要再服刑「對佢哋來講係好大嘅負擔同焦慮」，望法庭判處二人可獲即時釋放的刑期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指煽動文章非立場意見佔比很小-法官應整體考慮&quot;&gt;辯方指煽動文章非《立場》意見、佔比很小 法官應整體考慮&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指，有別於以往羊村繪本或譚得志案的街頭宣傳，本案被裁煽動文章為兩人履行新聞工作期間所刊登。就判詞指《立場》政治立場為本土主義，余亦強調被裁煽動的11篇文章，無一是《立場》的意見、宣傳其政治立場，全部均是受訪者或博客的意見；而且《立場》亦有刊登很多其他文章，涉案文章所佔百分比「好細好細好細」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余認為，正如判詞指鄒家成專訪雖有批評中央政府，但亦有批評泛民主派，整體考慮下不屬煽動，法官量刑時亦應作「整體考慮」。法官郭偉健認為兩者有分別，指如有人說「我唔鍾意你」，「有理冇理都講」；但如果無客觀事實作中傷、抹黑就不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指被告非明知故犯已下架多篇文章&quot;&gt;辯方指被告非明知故犯、已下架多篇文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，法官裁定文章屬煽動，在於沒有提出客觀基礎，惟法例無就新聞工作的限制定下指引，辯方審訊時曾呈上多篇其他媒體如《大公》、《文匯》等文章，亦沒有提客觀理據、甚至屬謾罵；又指博客文章不同學術論文，一般受訪者或作者可能心中有客觀基礎，「但佢未必知道要提出」，被告並非明知故犯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就判詞指，無證據《立場》其他99.99%文章並非煽動文章，余若薇指涉案17篇文章是控方深思熟慮下挑選，而《立場》運作7年，一直以來無收到文章具煽動性的投訴，只是因政治環境、民情和法律轉變，以往可接受的報導現時變得犯法。余強調，「以往真係冇傳媒因為呢一類報導被判刑」，而被告並非刻意犯法，如鍾沛權看到有關北愛抗爭的文章已立即下架。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官提屠龍小隊訪問-指難考慮其餘9999文章非煽動作減刑因素&quot;&gt;法官提屠龍小隊訪問 指難考慮其餘99.99%文章非煽動作減刑因素&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，「其實我唔係好想提其他嗰啲文章」，因不屬檢控基礎；但補充他曾考慮應否將另一篇屠龍小隊的專訪文章納入考慮，指「好明顯對辯方係不利」。郭官又反問：「發布嗰篇文章係幾時？係中大同理大暴動期間，啱啱有人比人掟死、啱啱有人被活燒，《立場》喺度寫咩呀？和平示威」，因此就其餘99.99%文章不具煽動意圖，「對唔住我真係好難比一個positive嘅減刑因素，因為我見到呢個唔係一定啱嘅事實」，而他在判詞亦已寫明，無證據顯示其餘99.99%文章不具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余若薇指，《立場》報導屠龍小隊並非為「歌頌」，而是「報導」，其他媒體亦有報導該小隊，甚至附上捐款號碼。郭官指，他只是解釋「有啲可能對辯方不利嘅文章喺我面前，我已經擺低哂」，余指法官應這樣做，並再強調當有事發生，傳媒有責任報導，而非傳媒導致事件發生，而且「冇一個政府指示話屠龍唔准報導，何桂藍唔准訪問」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指鍾沛權自動放棄犯罪可獲減刑&quot;&gt;辯方指鍾沛權自動放棄犯罪可獲減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，認為《國安法》第33條適用於鍾沛權，指鍾辭職和將逾萬篇文章下架，屬自動放棄犯罪，可獲減刑，而他無將何桂藍專訪等4篇涉案文章下架，最多只是判斷上錯誤。至於林紹桐，余指他涉案只有兩個月及一篇文章，該篇中大衝突兩年專訪性質亦僅訪問當時在場的人；而警方指報導失實後，他們已作覆核，並將警方投訴如實刊出，如判監的刑罰是不相稱。加上其健康狀況，如有事發生未能送往瑪麗醫院，可能有病情惡化或性命危險，望法官可判處二人即時獲釋的刑期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官聽罷陳詞後，休庭約50分鐘後宣讀判詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官裁11篇文章具煽動意圖立場理念為本土主義&quot;&gt;官裁11篇文章具煽動意圖、《立場》理念為本土主義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案為1997年後首宗傳媒被控煽動的審訊。法官郭偉健上月裁定，涉案17篇文章中有11篇具煽動意圖，認為其中何桂藍專訪、中大衝突兩周年專訪，以及區家麟、羅冠聰、陳沛敏的博客文章，在無客觀基礎下，指律政司檢控初選案為荒謬濫權、攻擊《國安法》和警方執法、煽動「攬炒」、以假消息散播憎恨及反政府情緒等。至於餘下鄒家成、梁晃維、羅冠聰、許智峯及梁頌恆5人的專訪，及鄒幸彤得獎報導，官則裁定不具煽動意圖，認為只涉受訪者表述政治觀點、屬新聞報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又根據《立場》創刊辭、社論等，認為其政治理念是本土主義，媒體路線為支持及促進香港自主，反修例期間成為抺黑和中傷中央及特區政府的工具。法官認為兩名被告審批涉案文章，是知悉並認同文章的煽動意圖，提供《立場》作發布平台，意圖煽動憎恨政府等，指「無論如何，至少罔顧煽動後果」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方求情指新聞工作者有責任報導-有別其他煽動案&quot;&gt;辯方求情指新聞工作者有責任報導 有別其他煽動案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;兩人均呈上陳情信，提及新聞理念，其中鍾沛權指如實記錄和報道是新聞工作者「不可逃避的責任」，林紹桐則指新聞工作者效忠對象「只有是公眾，亦只能是公眾」，同事最後在巨大壓力下仍堅守崗位，「無愧於時代」，且「新聞工作者捍衛新聞自由的唯一方式是報道」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方資深大律師余若薇指，二人均是新聞工作者，有責任報導社會狀況和不同意見，與其他煽動案涉宣洩政治言論不同。她又指，二人曾分別還柙349日和313日，如考慮三分一行為良好扣減，相等於已服刑16.5個月及15個月，望法庭判處刑期不會超出已還柙日數。余又提到，二人在本案後已失去工作，林紹桐患嚴重疾病需接受化療，如入獄難以接受治療。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被控串謀發布煽動刊物&quot;&gt;被控串謀發布煽動刊物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告依次為Best Pencil (Hong Kong) Limited、《立場》前總編輯鍾沛權（53歲）及前署任總編輯林紹桐（35歲），他們被控一項串謀發布及／或複製煽動刊物罪，指他們於2020年7月7日至2021年12月29日在香港，一同串謀和與其他人串謀發布及／或複製煽動刊物，即具以下意圖的刊物：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》煽動案今日判刑，前總編輯鍾沛權判囚21個月，前署任總編輯林紹桐則基於健康狀況，獲判可即時獲得釋放的刑期。散庭後已經入夜，林紹桐約7時半離開區域法院。他未有發言，在正門站立讓傳媒拍攝後離開，期間雙手合十及報以微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林紹桐搭升降機到法院地下時，有約3名便衣警及2名警民關係科警員詢問他會如何離開，期間有女警觸碰其手臂。林表示「唔好掂我」，望警員與他保持距離。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方在林步出門口前向傳媒稱：「（林）唔會接受訪問，會企定定影相，之後喺後門搭車走，希望大家安全唔好追。」林現身時，有人高呼「Patrick，加油」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》兩位前總編輯鍾沛權、林紹桐，昨日（9月26日）因「串謀發布煽動刊物」分別被判監21個月及11個月。記協發聲明，認為已對新聞業造成不可逆轉的傷害。政府發言人則指，判刑理由指《立場新聞》與鍾林「站在抗爭者的一邊與政府抗衡」、「干犯的罪行相當嚴重」，判刑彰顯公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記協的聲明指，《立場新聞》及鍾林被定罪「已對香港新聞業界造成不可逆轉的傷害」，明言反對以煽動罪、《港區國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》等法例，檢控按《基本法》行使權利，進行新聞工作的人士及機構。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記協又指，本港現時可以合法報導和刊登的議題和評論比以往大減已是不爭事實，而案件亦未有為新聞業劃下清晰界線，加上煽動罪最高刑期已提升至七年，認為只會令新聞工作者陷於憂心動輒得咎，難以無後顧地履行職責。審訊期間，控方就編輯、記者及文字的意圖向被告逐字逐句盤問，記協認為亦加劇新聞業界的自我審查風氣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明稱「維護國家安全無可厚非」，惟「讓新聞工作者敢言直諫、社會能暢所欲言，是維持香港繁榮穩定所必須，亦是維持其國際良好形象的重要一環。」對於政府堅稱新聞自由如何完備，記協認為「公道自在人心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;政府則以《區域法院就「串謀發布煽動刊物」案的判刑彰顯公義》為題，在昨晚發出新聞稿。政府發言人指早前的裁決理由已指出涉案文章並非以事實為基礎的新聞報導，「將煽動仇恨的言行歪曲成『新聞工作』是絕對的顛倒是非。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;政府發言人又指，裁決理由提到「三名被告不是進行真正的傳媒工作，而是參與當時所謂的抗爭」，從《立場新聞》的社論和其出版的刊物《立誌》可見「他們站在抗爭者的一邊與政府抗衡」，「干犯的罪行相當嚴重」。《立場新聞》有約160萬跟隨者，「涉案的煽動文章對中央和特區政府及其居民造成的傷害必然是相當嚴重，雖然難以量化。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於有指本港新聞及言論自由受影響，政府發言人指裁決理由已指出《立場新聞》罔顧客觀事實，違背國際人權公約需按「負責任新聞作業」原則真誠地行事，而《基本法》和《香港人權法案》保障港人權利。港人和新聞工作者可「一如既往可以自由作出基於事實的評論或批評，及依法享有和行使新聞和言論自由，無須擔心會誤墮法網。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《立場新聞》目前有約6,100萬資產被凍結，律政司已根據《香港國安法第四十三條實施細則》附表3，向法庭提出沒收令申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Nvoohlf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，鍾沛權今被判監禁21個月，林紹桐則可獲即時釋放。法官判刑時，拒納二人因履行新聞工作者報導責任及誤墮法網為減刑因素，指煽動罪自1938年已是成文法罪行，法例早已就傳媒可發布或不可發布的內容提供指引，而傳媒若以事實為基礎，「即使他的批評是猛烈和尖銳，他也不會干犯煽動罪」，而「只有那些意圖『打擦邊球』的人才會擔心誤墮法網」。法官認為，二人並非「單純的新聞工作者」，如專訪何桂藍顯然為她助選，中大衝突兩年專訪則重燃已冷卻的暴力抗爭，雖有將警方投訴列出，但「顯然是視警方的投訴為無物，增加他們對警方的藐視」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官批評，被告並非進行真正的傳媒工作，而是「參與當時所謂的抗爭」，「站在示威者的一邊與政府抗衡」；即使辯方指涉案文章無一篇是《立場》的意見，但他認為文章「完全可以幫助《立場》促進本土主義在香港萌芽和壯大」，「無論如何，雖然《立場》不是作者，它依然是發布者。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;拒納履行新聞職責誤墮法網-指煽動罪已立多年早有指引&quot;&gt;拒納履行新聞職責、誤墮法網 指煽動罪已立多年早有指引&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官判刑時表明，3名被告不是因為履行新聞工作者的報導責任被定罪，強調煽動罪為特定意圖罪行，控方須證明發布者具煽動意圖或罔顧煽動後果，而法庭已從《立場》社論和刊物等，裁定其政治理念是本土主義，媒體路線為支持及促進香港自主，反修例期間成為抺黑和中傷中央及特區政府的工具；鍾沛權和林紹桐是知悉並認同文章的煽動意圖，提供《立場》作發布平台。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 《立場新聞》前總編輯 鍾沛權&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，因此不接納被告因履行新聞工作者報導責任為減刑因素。就辯方指，法庭無就新聞工作者限制訂指引，二人並非明知故犯、是誤墮法網，法官不同意，指煽動罪自1938年已是成文法罪行，大公報案表明煽動罪元素不包括煽動暴力，對傳媒工作者有指導作用；而《刑事罪行條例》第9條亦訂明煽動意圖以及合法辯解，法例早已就傳媒可發布或不可發布的內容提供指引，而且重點顯然在發布者意圖。此外，言論和新聞自由受《基本法》、《香港人權法》和《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》保障，即使回歸後本港無傳媒被控煽動案例，新聞工作者仍可參考大量海外案例，包括歐洲人權法院對編輯責任製作指引，在互聯網「唾手可得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於辯方指，法例從未指出評論文章必須「提出客觀基礎」才可避免指為煽動，法官指「這是不需要法例或政府指出的」，指任何一名新聞工作的人都知道，「新聞工作的首要責任是講真話，不是講假話、不是講半真半假的話」，當評論或意見得到真確事實、或發布者盡力查證為真確事實所支持，自然有「客觀基礎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指若以事實為基礎-即使批評猛烈尖銳亦不犯罪&quot;&gt;官指若以事實為基礎 即使批評猛烈尖銳亦不犯罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，法庭裁定被告是否發布煽動刊物時，會先考慮刊物是否具煽動意圖，如有，再考慮被告是否具煽動意圖，但他認為新聞工作者考慮的次序可對調——若他意圖發布批評政府或政權的文章，可先考慮發文意圖是什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，若他抹黑中傷中央和特區，意圖嚴重破壞政府合法性等，「他自然要承擔罪責」；但若其批評不是為抹黑中傷、散播仇恨恐懼，是「以事實為基礎」，透過適當驗證確保事實真確性，並在呈現、描述和敘述評論或意見時「保持真誠公正的態度」，且根據傳媒倫理守則進行，「在這種情況下，即使他的批評是猛烈和尖銳，他也不會干犯煽動罪。」法官又指，即使後者不幸被控，控方舉證必然遇上困難，被告「亦絕對可指出他的強烈批評是如何有理有據」，及不具煽動意圖。法官指，「只有那些意圖『打擦邊球』的人才會擔心誤墮法網，因為他不是從他的意圖出發，而是從言論或文章的內容是否可以『偷雞』出發。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指作其他報導-不表示不會無煽動意圖&quot;&gt;官指作其他報導 不表示不會無煽動意圖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官並指，《立場》案發時無疑作出很多新聞報道，涵蓋官方和非官方人物的新聞、法庭新聞等，但這「並不表示3名被告不會在發布其他文章時沒有煽動的意圖」。官指《立場》作為網媒，自然須以新聞媒體的形象出現，但現今媒體吸引讀者的賣點「更多是它如何作出評論」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指被告絕非單純新聞工作者-發布何桂藍專訪顯然為其助選&quot;&gt;官指被告絕非單純新聞工作者 發布何桂藍專訪顯然為其助選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，案發期間鍾沛權和林紹桐「絕對不是單純的新聞工作者」，以鍾沛權負責審批的何桂藍專訪為例，指《立場》專訪何並發布，「顯然是為參加民主派35+初選的何桂藍助選」，透過訪問讓她有機會說出早在2014年已參與撰寫本土主義的專題文章、對六四的覺醒，及曾到烏克蘭學習民主運動；亦將何過往號召他人支持郭榮鏗等在立法會拉布阻止國歌法立法的錄像嵌入文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，作者特別讓何桂藍說出選民選她而不是其他參選人的理由、及她即使攬炒自己也絕不與政權妥協，再以煽情手法問讀者會否選何。而專訪在7月7日發布後，《立場》在7月11日初選投票日首日再在網絡發布，但其他人的專訪無相同待遇，「毫無疑問，《立場》替何桂藍助選」，唯一合理和不可抗拒推論是《立場》和鍾沛權認同何的煽動言論及意圖發布。法官又指，何桂藍有接受其他訪問並發布，但該些媒體無在文章內或行為上說明他們認同何的煽動言論，亦無替何助選勝出初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指中大衝突專訪列警投訴仍發布-顯然視投訴為無物增加對警藐視&quot;&gt;官指中大衝突專訪列警投訴仍發布 顯然視投訴為無物、增加對警藐視&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於林紹桐負責審批的中大衝突兩周年專訪，法官裁定無客觀基礎下指中大學術自由受威脅、攻擊警方執法並美化暴動者行為，更嵌入片段比較校園暴動時及兩年後景象，出現「光時」等口號。法官認為，「這顯然是《立場》的編採決定」，藉文章意圖重新展示抗爭口號，重燃已冷卻的暴力抗爭，引起公眾對政府及警方憎恨，可見《立場》和林紹桐「不是純粹履行傳媒的報道責任，而是意圖發布煽動文章」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，其他媒體亦曾發布參與「所謂『保衛中大』」示威者的專訪，雖受訪者聲稱「保衛中大」，但文章無提出警方或政權當時損害中大的學術自由，只是記錄示威者說法、事件對他們及家庭關係的影響等，《明報》相關文章一欄亦加入〈警員：從來無意攻入中大 保衛戰是偽問題〉的文章，「平衡了文章的內容」，但《立場》和林紹桐卻無相類似做法。法官又指，《立場》和林紹桐確實將警方投訴在文章開端和結尾以編按形式列出，但繼續發布該文章，「顯然是視警方的投訴為無物，增加他們對警方的藐視。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指涉案文章非編者話-官可助促進本土主義在港萌芽壯大&quot;&gt;辯方指涉案文章非編者話 官：可助促進本土主義在港萌芽壯大&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，《立場》的社論及博客文章，散播出來的資訊是「中央政府是極權政府、特區政府是中央的傀儡，及警隊和法官是政權的打手」，必然意圖挑起港人對中央和特區政府的仇恨藐視，及不接受中央和特區政府的合法性和認受性。就辯方指煽動文章無一篇是《立場》的編者話或意見，法官認為：「這些文章完全可以幫助《立場》促進本土主義在香港萌芽和壯大。無論如何，雖然《立場》不是作者，它依然是發布者。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官被告非進行傳媒工作而是參與抗爭與政府抗衡&quot;&gt;官：被告非進行傳媒工作、而是參與抗爭與政府抗衡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官郭偉健指，3名被告並非進行真正的傳媒工作，而是「參與當時所謂的抗爭」，從《立場》的社論和《立誌》可見，被告「站在示威者的一邊與政府抗衡」。他指被告的罪行嚴重，犯案持續1年5個月，「大部分處於香港社會過半民眾最不信任中央、特區政府、警隊及司法機關的時間」，而「立場」有近160萬名追蹤者，因此文章「對中央及政府和居民造成的傷害必然相當嚴重」，基於罪行嚴重性，監禁是唯一恰當選擇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納鍾下架文章屬放棄犯罪-判監21個月&quot;&gt;官拒納鍾下架文章屬放棄犯罪 判監21個月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;刑期方面，就鍾沛權的量刑，郭官不接納《國安法》第33條的減刑理由適用，指鍾並非自動放棄犯罪，他移走部分文章，其「目的只是降低被執法機關對他及《立場》進行執法的風險」。郭官以23個月監禁為量刑起點，由於相隔一段時間才作裁決，對他構成壓力，故減刑兩個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官又指，本案因譚得志的上訴案而押後，至現時判刑時，《監獄條例》已修訂，但郭官認為這不代表鍾未能獲行為良好的三分一扣減，只要他能夠令懲教署署長相信不會再犯危害國家安全的罪行，他就可獲刑期扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官考慮林紹桐患腎病易受致命感染-判即時釋放&quot;&gt;官考慮林紹桐患腎病易受致命感染 判即時釋放&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於林紹桐，郭官指他在鍾辭職後才擔任《立場》署理總編輯，僅參與兩個月，牽涉一篇文章，因此以14個月監禁為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於減刑方面，由於辯方指林患上「抗嗜中性白血球細胞質抗體血管炎」，其抗體會攻擊自己的細胞，而腎功能低於正常三成，屬於第四期腎病，容易受到危及生命的感染，而林一直在瑪麗醫院接受治療，若返回獄中服刑的話，懲教署未必批准林到瑪麗就醫，但其主診醫生的照顧十分重要。因此，郭官決定減刑3個月，而林早前只還柙了10個月，即需要再入獄21天。惟郭官考慮到林需接受醫學監察，再入獄會對其生命構成威脅，因此判他可即時釋放的刑期，並下令林即時獲釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，鍾沛權今被判監禁21個月，林紹桐則可獲即時釋放。國安法指定法官郭偉健判刑時，提及由區家麟撰寫、無被納入檢控基礎的博客文章〈終審法院喜迎江湖新秩序〉，文中評論終院推翻黎智英獲高院批准保釋的判決，批評「法官們跪得很快很徹底」、「完全站在權貴立場」等。郭官斥：「即使是終審法院的判決，區家麟完全不尊重，語調輕挑、充滿藐視」，又指他沒有提出任何實質理據，也沒可能有任何客觀理由相信終院法官會不遵守誓言執行職務。郭官指區的文章明顯地具有引起市民憎恨司法機關的意圖，並強調：「毫無疑問，終審法院法官在司法界的地位是不可能受到任何政權的操弄。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官反駁區家麟稱法官受政權操弄不可能是正確&quot;&gt;官反駁區家麟稱法官受政權操弄「不可能是正確」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官郭偉健判刑時拒納履行新聞工作者報道職責為減刑因素，指《立場》非進行真正傳媒工作、而是參與抗爭，涉案文章幫助促進本土主義在港萌芽壯大（見另稿）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官另在判詞兩度提及區家麟的博客文章，指《立場》刊登區家麟等人的博客文章，肆意攻擊和抹黑《國安法》，藐視司法，「尤其是將指定法官描述為被政權操弄，而這些法官亦願意接受操弄或自行配合」，惟「這一點不可能是正確」。法官指，區家麟和鍾沛權「根本沒有證據顯示政權操控法官，更沒有證據證明指定法官屈服於政權之下而不是根據其法官誓言執行職務」。而他們不可能不知法官李運騰是首批被委任為指定法官的原訟庭法官，據他們說法，李「必然是政權的打手」，但「假若這是事實，他們又如何解釋李法官批准黎智英保釋外出」，法官批評區從無在此方面解釋，鍾沛權亦「視而不見」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官嚴詞斥區家麟完全不尊重法院判決-語調輕挑充滿藐視&quot;&gt;官嚴詞斥區家麟完全不尊重法院判決 「語調輕挑、充滿藐視」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於辯方多次指被裁定煽動的文章只有11篇，佔《立場》整體文章數量約0.001%，無證據餘下99.99%的文章涉煽動，郭官表示不想論述其餘文章，以免被指擴大檢控基礎，但為回應辯方陳詞，以區家麟另一篇博客文章〈終審法院喜迎江湖新秩序〉為例，它刊於2021年2月11日，當日正正是終院推翻法官李運騰批准黎智英保釋外出的判決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官引述區在文章中批評司法機關和法官的句子，包括「讀終審法院有關黎智英保釋上訴的判案書，才不過幾段，只見法官們跪得很快很徹底，權力永遠是對的，人權法治聊作點綴」、「法官所理解的社會背景，完全站在權貴立場，並非站在人權公義的視角」、「判詞也略提到香港人享有公民自由、無罪假定等原則，但只是口甜舌滑一番」、「終審法院反駁，律政司一些技術性理據⋯顯得終審法院還有點自主、有點權威，但這些技術性細節上的反駁，只屬趴在地上嗱番拃沙之舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官語氣稍強地指：「即使是終審法院的判決，區家麟完全不尊重，語調輕挑，充滿藐視，但他沒有提出任何實質理據，他更加沒有亦沒可能有任何客觀的理由相信終審法院法官會不遵守法官誓言執行職務。」郭官強調，「毫無疑問，終審法院法官在司法界的地位是不可能受到任何政權的操弄。」區的文章明顯地具有引起市民憎恨司法機關的意圖，而區亦視而不見。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黃振強自行求情指「出庭指證難免受憎恨或潛在報復」冀獲減刑&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AKtahPt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年「屠龍」小隊等被指計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警察，遭律政司起訴反恐怖主義條例，他們亦被控「串謀謀殺」警察。陪審團裁定6名被告無罪，1名被告交替罪成。認罪被告、「屠龍」隊長黃振強在審訊中以「污點證人」身份作供。他今（26日）在高等法院自行求情。法官張慧玲指黃雖有作供，但「你畀完口供嗰啲、關你事嘅個個都罪名不成立，『屠龍』全部罪名不成立」，並問黃有否就減刑作補充。黃表示：「希望法官閣下可以考慮人身威脅呢個因素，呢宗案件牽涉好多殺傷力武器，我出庭指證相關人士，以及一啲仍然在逃嘅人士，難免會受到佢哋憎恨或者潛在嘅報復。」黃最後哽咽稱：「我對於2019年反修例運動期間所犯下嘅罪行，同對社會造成嘅破壞深感歉疚同抱歉。我會藉住監獄嘅時間積極進修⋯⋯將來重投社會做返個腳踏實地嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件暫定11月14日判刑。明天將由蘇緯軒、彭軍壕、蔡凱明及陳玉龍求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃振強大律師有事-未能繼續代表&quot;&gt;黃振強大律師有事 未能繼續代表&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;還柙中的黃振強身穿灰黑色西裝、手持文件步入犯人欄，他一度望向旁聽席微笑。法官張慧玲向黃確認，原本代表他的陳大律師是否有事而未能繼續代表他；黃同意。控方讀出黃的經歷口供，他於1998年9月出生，案發時任職搭棚工，月入3萬。他於案發時並沒有刑事紀錄，自2019年12月8日起被捕還柙至今。黃同意張官更正，他於案發時已辭職。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指黃作供後屠龍全部罪名不成立&quot;&gt;官指黃作供後、「屠龍」全部罪名不成立&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官指，黃並非最早認罪，因此不會有三分一減刑。原本代表黃的大律師，早前已向法庭呈交求情陳詞，提及希望法庭考慮黃有出庭作供，而給予額外減刑。張官指黃雖然作供，但「你畀完口供嗰啲、關你事嘅個個都罪名不成立，『屠龍』全部罪名不成立」，「你畀咗兩個星期嘅口供，陪審團唔信，或者有疑問。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃稱出庭指證難免會受對方潛在報復-冀法庭予減刑&quot;&gt;黃稱出庭指證難免會受對方潛在報復 冀法庭予減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官引述求情陳詞指，黃選擇認罪後，同案被告吳智鴻才改為認罪；黃同意這點。黃另補充：「希望法官閣下可以考慮人身威脅呢個因素，因為呢宗案件牽涉好多殺傷力武器，我出庭指證相關人士，以及一啲仍然在逃嘅人士，難免會受到佢哋憎恨或者潛在嘅報復。」黃再補充，希望法庭可以考慮他被捕時提供的手機證據，對案件有幫助，「協助控方理解成件事嘅案情同埋真相，件案好大程度依賴我手機嘅證據去組織返案情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃哽咽表示將來重投社會做返個腳踏實地嘅人&quot;&gt;黃哽咽表示「將來重投社會做返個腳踏實地嘅人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃最後哽咽向張官表示：「我對於2019年反修例運動期間所犯下嘅罪行，同對社會造成嘅破壞深感歉疚同抱歉。我明白要面對好長嘅刑期，我會藉住監獄嘅時間積極進修，反思自己嘅錯誤，報答家人師長朋友嘅照顧，將來重投社會做返個腳踏實地嘅人，多謝法官閣下。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，張官一度問控方，就「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，黃承認的案情牽涉400多萬款項，但審訊期間卻顯示所涉金額並非如此多，而法庭量刑時該如何考慮。控方認為，法庭可考慮400多萬作為判刑基礎，並非只依賴審訊期間的證供，而且罪行的基礎是計算「進進出出」的累積金額。張官另問到，控方能否提供涉及眾籌的案例，控方指有一宗英國案例相關。案件暫定11月14日判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃振強早前承認「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪；而「串謀謀殺」及「管有爆炸品」罪則獲存檔法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告不認罪，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，被裁定《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，以及「串謀謀殺」罪不成立。賴振邦被裁定交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立。女被告劉佩凝的「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪亦不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyiv’s signature of the statute on 21 August came several weeks after Russia’s 8 July attack on a paediatric hospital, which killed over 35 people (including four children) and injured another 190, in Russia’s latest egregious crime committed during its war of aggression in Ukraine. In the face of such a tragedy, OSINT analysts in Ukraine and further afield were quick to identify the make and composition of the Kh-101 missile that hit the hospital, denying Russia the opportunity to mask the attack and affirming the increasing relevance of OSINT in holding the Kremlin accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSINT’s relevance to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is no coincidence, but rather the result of OSINT’s gradual development and acceptance in recent years, in parts thanks to advancements in data tools including geolocation and chronolocation software. Realising its full potential requires a coordinated and prepared approach from government, the private sector and civil society – no small undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;squaring-the-evidentiary-triangle&quot;&gt;Squaring the Evidentiary Triangle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, from Luhansk to Lviv and around the world, the online community is filming, posting and resharing evidence of Russian war crimes on social media, online fora and journalistic sites in the hope that someday, victims might hold the guilty to account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of OSINT techniques in documenting modern crises has demonstrated a need to expand the production of criminal evidence beyond the traditional triangle of law enforcement, forensic experts and witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the aftermath of the Second World War, OSINT has gradually played a more pivotal role in holding perpetrators of international transgressions to account. For example, starting in 1945, photography and film offered critical evidence during the Nuremberg Trials. From 1993–94, documentation from news channels, online fora and satellite imagery led to the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Beginning in the 2000s, cell phone photos and videos, geo-referencing tools, drones and social media captured information crucial for the hybrid internationalised tribunals for the conflicts in Sierra Leone and Cambodia in 2001 and Lebanon in 2009. Finally, in March 2011, images of clashes in Darʿā, a rural province of southern Syria, changed everything, giving birth to the first “war feeds”, or “digital war in plain sight”. During the Syrian conflict, OSINT was regularly pivotal in correcting war narratives, especially surrounding the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In We Are Bellingcat, Elliot Higgins highlights how, even as hopes for international support in Syria dwindled, OSINT analysts continued documenting and disseminating evidence of human rights violations on social media. Collaborations like the Google/Bellingcat-supported Syrian Archive validated the dangers faced by Syrians in gathering evidence and solidified OSINT’s role in facilitating evidence collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spinning-the-web-of-accountability&quot;&gt;Spinning the “Web of Accountability”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was once a fledgling ecosystem of citizen journalists has grown into an organised cohort of OSINT practitioners documenting, analysing and presenting open source evidence in court, ultimately pursuing greater degrees of accountability for criminals and malign actors than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and its partners have jointly pursued a “web of accountability” – a term coined in March 2023 at the United for Justice conference in Lviv – for war crime investigations in Ukraine. However, the pseudo-network of strands comprising this web are messy and convoluted, spanning an amalgamation of actors in nearly as many jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;What was once a fledgling ecosystem of citizen journalists has grown into an organised cohort of OSINT practitioners documenting, analysing and presenting open source evidence in court&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the OSINT network dedicated to uncovering war crimes in Ukraine comprises – at a minimum – six legal firms, nine academic hubs, 19 OSINT investigative teams (including names like Berkeley’s Human Rights Investigations Lab, Osint For Ukraine, Global Rights Compliance and the Ukrainian Molfar), 17 special IT projects (which range from apps like e-Enemy to blockchain solutions like project Dokas), a sub-network of 23 judicial bodies in Ukraine and further afield, and 39 civil society organisations (including the 5AM Coalition) that collect and document potential war crimes and crimes against humanity. These actors are intricately linked with judicial authorities across the West and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Joint Investigation Team and the CICED Database at Eurojust epitomise this collaborative spirit, pooling resources and evidence with enhanced support. Additionally, the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group – a collaborative venture between the EU, UK and US – provides tailored guidance to war crime prosecutors. Another effort, the Dialogue Group on Accountability for Ukraine – an initiative led by Ukraine, the ICC and the EU – aggregates workstreams from Ukraine’s General Prosecution Office, international accountability actors, domestic and foreign accountability providers, and civil society organisations. USAID’s Human Rights in Action Programme is funding study visits and advanced training (inclusive of OSINT modules) in international criminal law and justice for Ukrainian lawyers. Europol has also established an OSINT taskforce to facilitate international investigations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The Council of Europe has launched the CyberUA project, which aims to enhance Ukraine’s capabilities in handling electronic evidence related to war crimes and gross human rights violations. In short, there are several notable cases of successful international cooperation in leveraging open source information for documenting war crimes in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between these achievements, however, interorganisational coordination is arduous. Actors may not know of each other’s existence and do not necessarily have the means, forums or trust to collaborate. “The current landscape lacks a unified model for archiving war crimes evidence, with various platforms operating in isolation and without full integration”, stressed Roksolana Burianenko, former programme manager for Mnemonic’s Ukrainian Archive. “The key issue is the absence of a coordinated approach and a governance system to harmonise efforts across different archives and actors. Such coordination is essential not only for accountability, but also for creating a digital memorial that captures the Ukrainian people’s suffering. In our digital age, establishing these archives and memorials should, and could, happen much faster than in the past”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is paradoxical: actors across nearly every sector of society are tackling overlapping aspects of war crimes investigations, but those same actors are so siloed that communication is inconsistent and cooperation is sporadic, even in the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leveraging-osint&quot;&gt;Leveraging OSINT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the strengths that OSINT lends to war crime investigations, the sheer amount of information (and disinformation) in the open sources, the costs of upskilling to use this information, and judicial wariness of open source information pose several challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;information-overload&quot;&gt;Information Overload&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immense and ever-growing volume of digital evidence – from sources including social media, blogs, online forums, CCTV footage, livestreams and satellite – deepens the web of accountability’s inefficiency. The Ukrainian Archive contains a staggering 6,930,635 videos from 9,567 sources, and even this represents only a fraction of the pieces of open source evidence amassed by the 5AM Coalition. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s office keeps a diligent count of registered crimes of aggression and war crimes since February 2022. At the time of writing, this number exceeds 143,899 – a testament to the enormity of the task at hand. For comparison, the office records only 19,274 crimes against national security in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Overall, we have 5 million digital records in our system”, says a chief investigator for Mnemonic. “We are preserving the potential human rights violations and possible war crimes from all parties, but only a small percentage is being really analysed. While preservation of data was our initial priority, the community now aims to undertake analysis, mapping and tagging on a larger scale to harness the full potential of the preserved data. With all the data we have collected it would take decades, probably, if not longer, to investigate every single one of these files!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the volatile nature of conflict zones and the complexity of war crimes make it difficult to verify the authenticity of digital evidence. Russia has enthusiastically compounded these issues by flooding online spaces with disinformation and propaganda, propagating conflicting narratives and leveraging deepfake technology in ways that highlight the need for continuous adaptation and innovation in the use of OSINT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prohibitive-capacity-building-costs&quot;&gt;Prohibitive Capacity-Building Costs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the overwhelming availability of OSINT evidence is one problem, the costs of storing and processing this evidence represent another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s a pressing need for a technological platform”, argues Lindsay Freeman, co-author of the Berkeley Protocol on Digital Open Source Investigations, “that enables civil society groups and documentarians on the ground to securely store digital evidence. This idea, like a ‘digital evidence locker’, has been widely discussed, but even the biggest NGOs face significant challenges in scaling and securing such operations”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this evidence is stored, investigators and legal professionals often require training to ensure they can efficiently handle and process OSINT-generated evidence. Thus, another obstruction facing the coordinated use of OSINT by actors investigating war crimes is a difficult trade-off: should they invest time, resources and funding into trainings and platform subscriptions, or leave investigators aimlessly sifting through datasets that grow with each social media post and website refresh, further burying key evidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, actors with more resources can advance their application of OSINT in their investigations, while others are left further behind in capacity and capabilities. This disparity exacerbates the web of accountability’s patchwork use of OSINT. “Technical trainings on software techniques and OSINT methods should not be confined to exclusive clubs; there is a need of some form of modernisation and update of these investigative and legal communities to achieve a more effective usage of the concept of Universal Jurisdiction”, says Burianenko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;courtroom-challenges&quot;&gt;Courtroom Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a judicial perspective, accountability structures need time to adapt to the introduction of OSINT as an evidence collection tool as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, courts often have varying admissibility criteria for open source evidence, which needs to be handled accordingly. “I’m certainly not against open-source investigations”, Freeman clarifies, “but I insist on their execution within the bounds of legal standards. It’s heartening to see many in the OSINT field have significantly honed their methodologies … [but some] tend to leap to conclusions prematurely. In criminal proceedings, where establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is the cornerstone, selecting a single hypothesis from a spectrum without adequately exploring alternative scenarios can be a major oversight”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is imperative for Ukraine and its partners to wade through the challenges of a coordinated and consistent use of OSINT in holding perpetrators of war crimes accountable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freeman also indicates that the aforementioned information deluge compounds the legal difficulties of using OSINT. “Much of what’s captured during a conflict is [more relevant] for historians and won’t directly feed into crime documentation … Flooding [judges] with an excessive amount of information is not just tactically unsound; it risks prolonging the trial unnecessarily and could potentially infringe upon procedural efficiency”. For actors to use OSINT to evidence war crimes in a way that could be effective in judicial proceedings, they therefore need to be incisively selective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The essence is ‘data minimisation’, to gather only what’s pertinent to the case at hand”, continues Freeman. “This requires setting precise research questions and establishing a clear investigative direction – to discern what must be proven and what evidence is genuinely relevant, whether it incriminates or exonerates”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-labour-of-love&quot;&gt;A Labour of Love&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is imperative for Ukraine and its partners to wade through the challenges of a coordinated and consistent use of OSINT in holding perpetrators of war crimes accountable. Thankfully, several mechanisms are already in place that could facilitate both a more efficient, well-connected web of accountability and the closer integration of OSINT into that web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU, which supports Ukrainian rule of law institutions and agencies with EUAM Ukraine, is investing over €10 million to support the ICC, as well as over €6 million on IT and equipment for the Ukrainian General Prosecutor’s Training Centre, civil society organisations and new, dedicated accountability structures. EUAM has also helped coordinate workshops designed to assist Ukrainian legal offices and courts with admitting OSINT war crime evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other allies of Ukraine are pursuing similar support and coordination structures. For example, the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine (ICPA) aims to be “the first step in this process to preserve evidence and prepare cases for future trials” with the help of a joint investigation team led by Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and Romania, and with additional participation from the ICC and financial support from the US. The EU also supports the Register of Damage, which records “claims and evidence on damage, loss or injury caused by the Russian Federation’s internationally illegal acts in or against Ukraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As initiatives like the ICPA seek greater coordination for evidence collection and processing, other partners are specifically facilitating opportunities to boost OSINT capabilities. In December 2023, the UK committed £3.7 million to the “documentation, investigation, and prosecution of war crimes committed in Ukraine”, which will fund training for Ukrainian authorities to develop “skills in verifying and utilising open-source intelligence, including materials uploaded by mobile phones to social media, and train prosecutors in preparing strong and well-evidenced legal cases”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts, among others, to develop a comprehensive, technology-centric and OSINT-enabled approach are encouraging, but there is always more work to be done. As stated by the ICPA, “we are dealing with an international crime that has rarely been prosecuted and for which there is no standard practice”. Holding war crimes perpetrators accountable will require an equally unprecedented commitment to innovative collaboration in evidencing and prosecuting atrocious crimes in Ukraine, but the benefits of doing so – chief among them, a secure and sovereign Ukraine – are worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sophisticated remote pager and walkie-talkie attacks on Hezbollah on 17–18 September were followed by an intensive Israeli air campaign against the militant group, which is ongoing. These events were hailed by Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant as a new phase in the country’s conflict with Hezbollah and a shift of gravity in Israel’s conflict from south to north. These actions, driven by intelligence breakthroughs and rapid decision-making, mark a critical moment in the ongoing conflict in the region and could have far-reaching implications for regional stability and Israel’s political landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israels-use-it-or-lose-it-moment&quot;&gt;Israel’s “Use it or Lose it” Moment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensational events of last week were, arguably, a suboptimal military outcome for Israel. Israel has not publicly claimed responsibility for either attack, though the capability and intelligence from allies point to its involvement. The pager and then the walkie-talkie attacks were originally designed to be the opening salvo in a coordinated and total attack against Hezbollah. This would undoubtedly have been devastating, rendering communications obsolete for Hezbollah while being prepared to simultaneously hit hard with drone and missile strikes, maybe even alongside a ground incursion. Despite this careful planning, US sources have reported that Israel’s leaders were forced to either act instantly or risk losing this asset. This was a “use it or lose it” moment, and has ultimately led Israel to ramp up its pressure on the north to follow what Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah fairly identified as a “declaration of war”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the activation of the pager attack was forced upon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel followed up with the movement of the 98th Division, a paratrooper division, from Gaza to the northern border on 18 September. In addition to this, Gallant visited aircraft bases on the northern border in the immediate aftermath of the pager attack. Israel then activated another of its assets in the walkie-talkie attack, another “use it or lose it moment” as reeling Hezbollah security officials (as well as embedded Iranian officers) began to look for other infiltrations. Israel has since begun a brutal missile campaign against Hezbollah with strikes in Southern Lebanon as well as in Beirut, where Israel reported the successful assassination of Ibrahim Aqil, a senior Hezbollah commander. According to Lebanon’s Ministry of Health, these attacks killed almost 500 and wounded many more on 23 September alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel’s “shock and awe” strategy in Lebanon is clear, proving capability and intent to strike and eliminate targets at will until Hezbollah agrees to Israel’s demand to withdrawing its troops and missile silos to beyond the Litani River. After activating their pager asset, Israeli commanders were forced to activate their walkie-talkie asset before it was detected. The forced use of these two key assets led Netanyahu to believe that this was his best chance to push for a victory against Hezbollah with further missile strikes and assassinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Israel’s “shock and awe” strategy in Lebanon is clear, proving capability and intent to strike and eliminate targets at will until Hezbollah agrees to its demands&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is clear is that throughout this last week Netanyahu has been led by events, and not the other way around. Despite this, he will be delighted that he is one step closer to reclaiming the “Mr Defence” reputation that has seen him serve a record eight terms as prime minister. After the shock of 7 October and the hostages that Israel has not been able to bring home, this is a moment of victory for the Israel Defense Forces, Israeli intelligence services and Netanyahu himself in re-asserting the competence and superiority of Israeli capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel will ultimately hope that ramping up pressure on Hezbollah through its continuing assassination and missile campaign will force its troops back behind the Litani River (some 18 miles from the current border, as mandated by UN Security Council Resolution 1701). This would allow Israel to return 200,000 displaced refugees to cities and villages in the north and score a major political and legitimacy goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-crushing-blow-for-hezbollah&quot;&gt;A Crushing Blow for Hezbollah&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Hezbollah, the pager and walkie-talkie attacks represented the most significant failure for the organisation since the 2006 war. In three days, Israel’s intelligence services blatantly proved their ability to infiltrate and destroy Hezbollah’s command-and-control structures. This began with the remote detonation of several thousand pagers on Tuesday and was followed up by the remote detonation of thousands of walkie-talkies used by the terrorist group on Wednesday. For Hezbollah this is a serious blow that carries a number of serious implications for the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the successful outcome of the Israeli operation exposed fundamental weaknesses in the group’s command-and-control mechanisms. Hezbollah already operates in an extremely difficult command-and-control environment due to extensive human intelligence and Pegasus spyware, where Israeli intelligence can compromise mobile phones simply by sending them a signal. This environment has forced Hezbollah to operate on a network of cells which rely on almost constant top-down delegation. The inevitable restructuring as well as the human capacity that Hezbollah has lost will hamper the group’s ability to effectively resist Israel’s attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there has been an impact on Hezbollah’s legitimacy. Israel’s attacks are a humiliation for the group, representing as they do a colossal security failure. Hezbollah’s inability to prevent the attacks and protect Lebanon (as it claims to do) makes its position extremely difficult. The severity of this legitimacy hit is demonstrated by Nasrallah being forced to admit that Hezbollah has suffered a major and unprecedented blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Hezbollah’s position is made more difficult by its lack of credible options to respond. Hezbollah cannot afford a full-scale conflict with Israel and will be wary of giving Netanyahu the slightest justification for further attacks or a ground incursion. At the same time, however, Nasrallah has furious internal stakeholders demanding revenge. The only real pressure valve available to him in this extremely difficult position is being able to claim attacks by the Axis of Resistance as consequences for Israel’s actions. This axis is comprised of an aligned group in the region, led by Iran and including Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and various militia groups, who claim to resist Israel and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wider-questions-for-the-axis-of-resistance&quot;&gt;Wider Questions for the Axis of Resistance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a major test for the Axis of Resistance. Iran has watched seemingly powerlessly as Hezbollah, its ally, has been pummelled again and again by Israel. The refugees streaming out of Southern Lebanon towards Beirut are another example of the pressure Israel is applying on Hezbollah. Iran is also yet to respond to Israel’s assassination of Ismayel Haniyeh in Tehran in July. Iranian leaders and key Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps figures will be increasingly frustrated that they have been unable to re-establish credible deterrence against Israel. This is a particularly sore point as it is fairly clear by now that their April missile and drone strikes against Israel were ineffective in achieving this. We can expect to see an evolving Iranian strategy that aims to place maximum diplomatic pressure on Israel through moves such as encouraging proxies to strike at Israel, as well as threatening regional stability and shipping lanes. We may also see Iran to make diplomatic overtures to the West to exert more diplomatic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hezbollah cannot afford a full-scale conflict with Israel and will be wary of giving Netanyahu the slightest justification for further attacks or a ground incursion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something to be aware of is that there are multiple smaller militia groups and individual cells within Hezbollah that have the potential for escalation. Many of these smaller or splinter groups may feel that they must respond to Israel with an independent attack that pre-empts or goes beyond Hezbollah’s so far very measured response. This danger is illustrated by previous attacks on UNIFIL in Southern Lebanon, such as the attack that resulted in the death of Private Sean Rooney in December 2022. If one of these smaller groups was to hit an Israeli population centre, either on purpose or by mistake, the tension could easily spill over into a larger-scale conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-usisrael-relationship&quot;&gt;The US–Israel Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting dynamic to note is that the pager attacks and subsequent missile campaign represent another case of Israel making aggressive decisions without first consulting the US. Prior examples of this include the decision to invade Rafah, rejecting any possibility of a future Palestinian state as part of negotiations, and missile campaigns on non-combat areas in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the US is Israel’s main ally and security guarantor, this trend embodies the increasing risk appetite of the current Israeli government. This is likely due to an assessment of the strategic environment, particularly Iran’s reluctance to enter a full-scale conflict, but also represents a political calculation by Netanyahu. Once again, the only way for Netanyahu to safeguard his short-term survival is by taking decisions that ensure Israel remains in a state of conflict. Followers of Israeli politics will not need reminding that Netanyahu faces three criminal cases that will progress as soon as he loses the premiership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The escalation perhaps also reflects a weakness in the US’s security arrangements, as it has been unable to effectively dissuade and disincentivise its own allies from escalation. The US has made it very clear that its priority, especially approaching the presidential election, is for regional de-escalation. This is illustrated by the exhaustive diplomatic efforts made since 7 October to reach a settlement between Iran, Hezbollah and Israel in order to keep the border cool. When the new US administration takes office later this year, its first priority in terms of Middle East policy must be addressing the balance of power between Washington and the Israeli prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a shock because, in a world where the use of aggressive war has been a contravention of international law since 1945. It was not a surprise because Western intelligence agencies had detected indications of a possible attack from late 2021, and they had made their conclusions public.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;They did so in part to deter Russia and in part to build “Western resolve.” The intelligence was also passed on to Ukraine, even if many in Kyiv struggled to accept that Russia would actually invade. The real surprise for several commentators and for U.S. intelligence itself was not the invasion but its immediate aftermath. The Russian forces failed to achieve a quick success, and Ukraine, in turn, mounted an effective response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine was not the first time that both participants in a war and their observers on the sidelines have made the wrong calls. It will probably not be the last, although the purpose of this report is to mitigate that danger in one particular case: a possible clash between the United States and the People’s Republic of China in the Pacific. No one example will exactly match any other. However, the quality and quantity of information — much of it not the product of leaks from official agencies but from open sources like Bellingcat — make the overestimation of Russia’s capacities and the underestimation of Ukraine’s particularly egregious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prussian military thinker Carl von Clausewitz considered that “a great part of the information obtained in war is contradictory, a still greater part is false, and by far the greatest part somewhat doubtful.” In Clausewitz’s day, most tactical intelligence was collected by cavalry patrols, and much of it was dependent on rumors, often inflated, or on reports from illiterate peasants of doubtful loyalty. Because of the inherent unreliability of the intelligence on which planning and operations were based in the Napoleonic era, he observed, “what a dangerous edifice war is, how easily it may fall to pieces and bury us in its ruins.” The advent of wireless, the consequent collection of signals intelligence, the development of aerial reconnaissance, and now the use of drones and satellites for persistent surveillance have all transformed the quantity and quality of information available to commanders. Artificial intelligence and its capacity to handle and interpret big data promise to deliver an era of intelligence-led operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent experience, however, should warn against hubris. Information superiority has not in itself delivered victory in recent wars, despite its capacity to enable stunning individual successes. In the 1990s, the assumption that dominant battlespace knowledge could allow the United States to dictate the tempo and outcomes of armed conflict was a key feature of the “revolution in military affairs,” but it did not prove of much use in preventing the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States or in directing the wars that followed in Iraq and Afghanistan to satisfactory conclusions. It, therefore, behooves states and their organizations to consider why their expectations were not correct and how they might do better next time. For there will be a next time: that is another reason why wars, even if they are shocks, should never be surprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place to begin any such exercise in lesson-learning from the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, is with those assumptions that are so inherent they are the most likely to be left unquestioned by otherwise well-informed analysts, whether they are from Beltway think tanks or government intelligence agencies. This prologue to the report that follows sets out eight such assumptions, several of which have a resonance that goes beyond the specifics of the Ukraine case. They illustrate how easy it is to take shortcuts in some thinking, not least because ideas are taken from others who are presumed to be experts without critical reflection, or — in the case of the United States’ allies — because they accept them from the United States without giving them context. In some cases, these ideas may indeed be appropriate in Washington, but they may not travel so well to the capitals of the United States’ partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first of these assumptions is the short-war illusion.&lt;/strong&gt; The expectation of an easy Russian victory in February 2022 began here, with the argument that the war would be short. What is a short war? Historians conventionally describe World War I as a long war because it did not end by Christmas 1914. That was the hope of those who were mobilized and taken from their families and peacetime jobs in late July 1914, but it was not the conclusion of many prewar staff planners who had thought more deeply about the issues. When they looked at the dependencies created by alliance structures and the effects of industrialization on war’s conduct, they were not convinced that the war could end so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popular expectations, and their rapid disappointment, have led many to see World War I as a “long” war, a point that is sustained when one bears in mind that, after the German armistice of November 11, 1918, bitter fighting continued from the Baltic to the Balkans and across the southern arc of the British and French empires until the last peace treaty was signed in 1923. But on one reading, particularly if one takes 1918 as its traditional end point, World War I was not so long, especially in relation to its scale. At just over four years, it was shorter than World War II (1937–45), and much shorter than the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48), or the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453). It was also shorter than the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality in any war — especially after it has started — is that few of its participants can anticipate the war ending tomorrow, but they will still hope that something will happen to end it in the next six months or so, precipitated perhaps by a surprise attack at the front or by a sudden domestic collapse in the enemy’s rear. After three or four months of conflict, when the possibility of a quick victory, or its corollary, the danger of quick defeat, has passed, such speculations look to an event out of the ordinary, one that is not on the immediate horizon but could have an instantaneous effect — such as the addition of a major new ally or the collapse of a coalition. World War I and World War II were transformed in 1917 and 1941, respectively, by the former. Both world wars ended with the victors acting with growing coherence while the soon-to-be defeated powers lost whatever unity they possessed and sought separate ways out of the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equivalents by the autumn of 2022 were the hopes that Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was fatally ill or that Russia would, once again, as in 1905 and 1917, respond to war with revolution. When these hopes are regularly postponed, they are abandoned as fantasies, and so the short war expectation becomes a long war in reality. It does so through accumulation: the end never ceases to be somewhere around the next corner. The main point, however, is that neither “short” nor “long” is an adjective endowed with any precision, despite the determination of analysts to use both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How short or long did analysts think the Russian invasion would be? Three days? Three months? Three years? Any of these would have revealed how devoid of context they were. By February 2022, the war was already into its ninth year and, by most standards, had become a long war even before the Russian invasion. In 2013–14, Ukraine effectively acquiesced in the loss of Crimea and parts of the Donbas. That acquiescence magnified the capabilities of the Russian forces because they were not tested. It locked in the minds of Western observers the apparent threat of “hybrid” war, even if hybrid war was largely fabricated by NATO. It ignored what became, in the jargon, a “frozen conflict” — a misnomer — even a euphemism — given that fighting continued and people were killed. It also led to an underestimation of what Ukraine achieved between 2014 and 2022 as it sought to put its armed forces on a better footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aided by training teams from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Ukraine prepared over eight years for a possible renewal of more active hostilities. From 2014 onward, it enhanced its capacity for national mobilization and popular resistance, prepared plans for territorial defense, and built up both the training and the tactical and operational competence of its battalions and brigades. A striking omission was the failure of those powers charged with advising Ukraine to consolidate the knowledge of its fighting capacity gleaned from their training missions or to integrate the views of those who executed these tasks into any strategic assessments. The reports submitted by the advisers were, at least in the United Kingdom’s case, treated as matters of defense engagement and not as an index of the levels of preparedness for the next round of fighting. Effectively, they went into a separate, self-contained file and were not shared at a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second assumption that reveals remarkably little about war in reality is that, in order to mount a successful offensive, the attacker requires a 3:1 superiority.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite its endless repetition, that statement is profoundly misleading. Only very rarely has that margin of superiority been available to any military commander. Unusually, however, the preinvasion analysis of Russia and Ukraine’s relative strengths insisted that this was, in fact, the sort of advantage which Russia was alleged to enjoy. As of November 2020, Russia was reported to have 900,000 active-duty troops to Ukraine’s 209,000, 2 million reservists to 900,000, and similar ratios in terms of tanks and guns. Its superiority in combat aircraft was even greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality in most armed forces is that strengths on paper do not convert into actual numbers available for combat. The result, and this was true in February 2022, is that forces are frequently much more evenly balanced and that, if they are not, the inferior force avoids battle and opts for other methods like guerrilla warfare or terrorism. Russia did not manage to create a local superiority of 3:1 and had not even sought to do so. On December 30, 2021, the Financial Times put the total Russian force on the Ukrainian border at 175,000. This was definitely not a 3:1 advantage. Nonetheless, it was enough for some analysts to conclude that “Russia’s military superiority would enable it to overrun Ukraine’s army in weeks by launching assaults on multiple fronts.” That interpretation of Russian intent was right, but it ignored the fact that Russia lacked the manpower to put it into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, the assumption about the inherent superiority of Russia was not one just about quantity but also about quality. It reflected a greater faith in the professional soldier than in the conscript or national serviceperson.&lt;/strong&gt; The Russian forces were portrayed in glowing terms twice over, as professional soldiers and as professionals with extensive combat experience, most recently in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This calculation rested on three core assumptions. The first was NATO’s own rejection of the principles of mass and national service in favor of long-service professionals better adapted for expeditionary warfare than home defense. Even France and Germany, the long-standing exemplars in Europe of the conscript army, went down that route in 1997 and 2011, respectively. The United Kingdom and the United States, territorially more secure because of the sea and with their defenses also underpinned by nuclear deterrence, had done so even earlier, in 1960 and 1973, respectively. Both Russia and Ukraine are continental states with long land frontiers, and neither could afford to make such a choice. Moreover, their immediate western neighbors, the most resilient Eastern European and Scandinavian states — Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland — either never abandoned conscription after 1991 or have returned to it since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Ukraine’s own combat experience since 2014 was discounted as somehow insignificant because it had been gained in a “frozen” conflict, not in an active, high-tempo war. The one-sidedness of the estimates of relative quality was striking, not so much for their underestimation of the Ukrainian army as for their almost complete lack of attention to it. As a result — and the third attribute of this third assumption — very little attention was given to what Ukraine’s own professional forces had learned from the continuity and depth of their combat experience over a period of eight years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth, the prewar assessments were conditioned by the Military Balance, the annual publication of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which counts the equipment and manpower strengths of each state.&lt;/strong&gt; A standard reference in the think tank community (for good reason), the Military Balance has encouraged generations of analysts to begin any judgments of capability with crude numbers — a process rarely put to the test in the Cold War because it never became hot. That approach in itself is not unreasonable precisely because it is capable of some form of exactness. But that very feature gives it a dominance that overshadows efforts to assess its less quantifiable aspects — will, morale, and intent. These, too, are part of fighting power and its measurement. For those who forgot that, Ukraine’s response since February 24, 2022, has reminded them that all three matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two direct consequences emerged from the prewar estimates as a result. First, insufficient account was taken of the fact that Ukraine’s soldiers were defending their homeland and that its people were fighting an existential war for national survival. Debates about the motivators for high morale, which focus, for example, on small-group cohesion, pale into insignificance in comparison with the unifying effects of legitimate and passionate national defense. The surprise — not that it should have been — was the fact that the sum of the state’s military capabilities did not represent the full sum of Ukraine’s defensive strength. If it were true that the number of professional soldiers married to sophisticated technology invariably trumped motivation and self-belief, the United States might have done better in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second and related consequence was the mistake of treating prewar measurements as predictors of wartime applications. States may want to match each other before a war, not least to deter their adversaries from attacking, but during a war, they endeavor to exploit differences to establish a relative advantage. They seek ways to exploit enemy vulnerabilities, not just to match strength with strength. Arms races, peacetime military competition, and the Military Balance focus attention on the latter, but, in doing so, fail to reflect war’s realities. After the 9/11 attacks, the United States called its enemies’ refusal to pitch like against like “asymmetric” warfare, as though they were somehow behaving unfairly by not meeting it on a level playing field in the sort of battle for which the United States had prepared and so reckoned it would win. But by so derogating asymmetric warfare, the United States failed to take sufficient account not just of the resilience and adaptability of Iraqi militias or the Taliban but, ultimately, also of Ukrainian strength in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part and parcel of this approach is a continuing fifth assumption that there is a clear division between the “conventional” operations of “major war” and the insurgent and guerrilla warfare historically associated with “small wars.”&lt;/strong&gt; Russia, an analyst from the Institute for the Study of War commented in January 2022, had created “a large-scale maneuver army to conduct operations against Ukraine.” That military capability had been modernized since 2008 and especially since 2014. However, that analyst and another from the Center for Naval Analyses recognized that if the Russian invasion in February 2022 became a protracted conflict, it would also turn into an insurgency. The war in Ukraine would, therefore, become a quagmire for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some commentators, this was the gleam on the horizon. Although Kyiv would fall and Russia would win quickly in the opening conventional phase of the war, a national insurgency would follow. The relative insouciance with which some senior politicians accepted this scenario demonstrated a striking ignorance of what an insurgency would do — and had done very recently in Iraq and Afghanistan. It would have divided the Ukrainian people; it would have broken the state; it would have fostered criminality and corruption, both in part legitimized by their necessary role in funding resistance; and it would have made the transfer to peace and the recovery of national unity even more protracted and complex than the war’s current shape — that of an interstate conflict — suggests is likely. This sequencing, conventional success for one side followed by that side’s exhaustion and possible defeat in a much messier, protracted war, appealed because it was familiar: it did, of course, mirror the experience of the United States in its post-9/11 wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2001, the United States, aided by the Northern Alliance, took Kabul in short order, but the war in Afghanistan did not end there. Insurgency followed, and two decades later, in 2021, the United States acknowledged defeat. But the lessons of Afghanistan had not sunk in with everyone, however recent and traumatic they were for many U.S. soldiers. One retired U.S. Army major wrote that if Russia took Kyiv in short order, “At that point you’ve lost the war. Yes, you may start the greatest insurgency in history. But you’ve [presumably meaning the Russians] won the war.” That is an extraordinary statement. This is not just a point about the inherent strength of an insurgency; it is also a point about the presumed sequence of events in Ukraine. It would begin with a high-tempo operation, as in Afghanistan in 2001–2 and in Iraq in 2003, and then would be followed by an insurgency. There was no allowance for the possibility that Ukraine would plan on incorporating some aspects of insurgent warfare from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement of the retired major was not only revealing for what it assumed about sequencing; it also assumed that the conventional operations of major war and the guerrilla operations of an insurgency were opposites and thus to be seen as alternatives. It ignored the fact that in both the world wars of the twentieth century, as well as in the Napoleonic Wars of the nineteenth century, guerrilla operations and partisan warfare had coexisted with “major war.” The standard narratives of all three of Europe’s major wars since the French Revolution, by focusing on conventional operations, omitted or marginalized the contributions and roles of insurgencies on multiple fronts. Nor was this neglect necessarily caused by the perception that insurgencies were somehow lesser forms of war, as the term “low-intensity operations” suggested. Frequently, they were not. Popular resistance to enemy occupation elicited brutal responses and indiscriminate violence. There was plenty of firepower-intensive, face-to-face combat in Afghanistan between 2006 and 2014. The division between the two forms of war is an illusion: over the course of a conflict, especially if it is protracted, war changes its shape and can do so many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2014 and 2022, Ukraine had prepared the capabilities for a war of national resistance, and it mobilized them on February 24, 2022. The territorial defense units formed in small groups and the non-attributable sabotage teams operating on Russian lines of communication had the potential to enable an insurgency at the same time that Ukraine also fought major conventional operations. It is worth remembering that in 1941–44, Ukraine was a theater of war characterized both by major conventional operations — using armor, artillery, and airpower — and by partisan warfare, sustained and directed from Moscow. The Soviets claimed that 200,000 partisans were organized into 2,145 groups, and at their peak they tied down 424,000 Germans. These figures may be exaggerated, but the SS and the Wehrmacht were provoked into counterinsurgency operations of extraordinary ferocity. The early Cold War texts on the subject stressed how the Soviet Union placed partisan warfare at the center of its thinking about war. Today, Russia, unlike the United States, makes no distinction between major wars and counterinsurgency. War, whether it is waged in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Syria, or Ukraine, is about the use of force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sixth was the way in which the issues of terrain and weather and their effects on the conduct of operations were examined.&lt;/strong&gt; The Military Balance mentality, which looks at capabilities, can tend to neglect geography — broad, deep rivers; boggy ground and swamps; forests; and mountains. These are the principal concerns of field commanders and key elements in the conduct of land operations. In analyzing Ukraine’s case, commentators saw its size and strategic depth as a source of weakness for Kyiv. In the words of two analysts, “Ukraine is vast, which makes it impractical for the country’s inferior force to mount an effective defence against an invasion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Russia in 1812 and the Soviet Union in 1941, strategic depth proved to be not a liability but a major defensive asset. In focusing on the problems for Ukraine of its force-to-space ratio, analysts failed to consider the much greater challenges that Russia would face on the same grounds. An army of 175,000 men was simply insufficient for a front of roughly 1,000 kilometers and a depth that was far greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the two world wars, the Pripet (or Pripyat or Pinsk) marshes were studiously avoided by the armies of both sides as unsuitable for the conduct of major war. Straddling the border of Belarus and Ukraine, they create a natural obstacle north of Kyiv, which in itself makes the city’s encirclement a daunting task. Some argued that, by attacking in the winter, Russia would be able to maneuver because the ground would be frozen. By late February 2022, however, it was not. Much of the landscape around Kyiv — thick forests in standing water — was unsuitable for mechanized warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The propositions around terrain took another twist. Pundits said that, if Ukraine had to wage guerrilla warfare, it would do so in the cities, and, if it did that, Russia would find its forces sucked into dense urban spaces. They counseled Ukraine against exercising this option: it would endanger the civilian population and cause major damage to the nation’s infrastructure. But if Russian columns could not maneuver across open ground because it was too waterlogged and so were instead forced onto the roads, the towns and cities where these lines of communication converged could be fortified as hubs of resistance. Mariupol was the obvious example in 2022: the Stalingrad of the Russo-Ukrainian war. The fighting here, however, was less urban insurgency and more conventional defense — a fight which, once again, made the distinction between the two much more fluid than the prevailing wisdom suggested was likely. In both world wars, attacking armies avoided cities with good reason: generals lose tactical control of their troops and operational designs are hijacked by house-to-house fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seventh, there is a further point about the importance of territory, which the preinvasion analysis, and much that has been written since, has failed to address.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States has encouraged Ukraine and its de facto NATO allies to identify this war, as it encouraged Europe to see both world wars, as a war for the defense of democracy and freedom. The “Western allies” clothe war in the vocabulary of the United States’ “manifest destiny.” Ukraine has colluded in that, not least to ensure its leverage with NATO members, and specifically with Congress in Washington and with the American people as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is an underlying truth in this characterization of the war, but the United States’ physical distance from Europe also minimizes the fact that for Russia, as Putin has himself described it, the war in Ukraine is designed to recover a lost empire, while for Ukraine it is a war to reestablish its 1991 frontiers. In other words, the control of territory is as much at the heart of this conflict as is the difference between an autocracy and a liberal and democratic government. In that context, possession is nine-tenths of the law. Ukraine has to fight to regain the land it has lost in order to be in a strong negotiating position when the war ends. Russia only has to hold what it has to have won something. That is why maneuvering, especially withdrawal, is so risky, and why counterattacking to regain what has been lost is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centrality of territory — with small gains counting as significant victories for Ukraine — feeds a narrative that plays badly in the United States. It smacks of attrition. The need for Ukraine to hold what it has elevates trench warfare. U.S. observers doubted that Ukraine could sustain the operational level of warfare. They saw its army as locked in by tactics and battles characterized by exhaustion and heavy casualties. Hence, the surprise created in September 2022 by the thrust on Kherson and then the switch to the counteroffensive at Kharkiv. Ukraine was not meant to be able to maneuver. The doubters argued that the success was due to Russia’s relative lack of numbers in the Kharkiv sector. A very similar set of arguments was run in August–September 2024 when the Ukrainian forces advanced into Russian territory to create the “Kursk pocket.” The Ukrainian military had used the best of its brigades against the weakest of Russia’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That emphasis on territorial control and trench warfare became a recurring part of the narrative as summer turned to autumn in 2022. It evoked frequent, but largely unhelpful, comparisons with World War I, not just from the international press but also from many of those fighting at the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World War I analogy played badly in the United States for three reasons. First, the United States, even more than the United Kingdom, sees World War I as a wasteful war, a conflict into which it was lured by a combination of British propaganda and Wilsonian rhetoric. It ended with a peace settlement that unraveled by the 1930s. By contrast, World War II is the “good” war, even if that narrative rests on retrospective myth-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, attrition became a taboo word after the war in Vietnam, with maneuver being elevated, especially in the U.S. Army’s Field Manual 100-5: Operations (1982), as the virtuous form of war, both more decisive in its effects and less costly in lives. That debate, which presented attrition and maneuver as opposites, rested on a false premise. At the tactical level, fire and movement are not competing alternatives but complementary and mutually dependent forms of fighting. Troops use fire to create the opportunity to move and to improve their position for firing. Moreover, the supposed antithesis between fire and movement, or between attrition and maneuver, is totally redundant in the air, where platforms do both. So, too, do most of today’s land platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the fighting of 2022–23 was characterized as attritional: Mariupol became Ukraine’s Stalingrad and Bakhmut its Verdun. Attritional battles make sense where terrain matters and where — as a result — the enemy is prepared to commit its forces to patterns of fighting that exhaust them. Bakhmut became symbolic for Ukraine because of the losses it suffered in its defense, just as Verdun did for France in 1916: “Ils ne passeront pas” [They shall not pass], in the words of the French posters that year. But Bakhmut also had significance for Russia’s capacity to maneuver: it sits athwart the junction of several roads running westward. The defense of Stalingrad similarly fulfilled two strategic functions in 1942–43. It was a rallying call for Soviet morale, which, in annihilating Friedrich Paulus’s 6th Army, inflicted the most obvious direct losses on Germany’s order of battle so far in World War II. The siege also blocked Germany’s access to the southeast and the Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attrition is, therefore, a means to an end, at the strategic level to exhaust the enemy and at the tactical to enable maneuver. Too many popular interpretations of World War I, not least those peddled in the United States, fail to observe that that major war ended with the successive surrenders of four powers and allied victory, even if the peace was lost. By the same token, the equivalent narratives of World War II, because victory was more successfully translated into a lasting peace, overlook the importance of attrition on the eastern front in 1941–45, in northwestern Europe in 1944–45, and at sea and in the air throughout the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The eighth and last set of assumptions about the expectations put in place in advance of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, concern the United States’ appetite for mirror-imaging its adversaries and their approach to war.&lt;/strong&gt; In the eyes of both the United States and NATO, Ukraine, it is important to remember, was a potential ally, not an enemy. Then U.S. president George W. Bush raised the possibility of Ukraine’s membership in NATO after Russia’s war with Georgia in 2008. The enemy was Russia. For that reason, the United States thereafter focused on Russia’s military modernization: its move beyond the “little green men” of 2013–14, its development of advanced technologies, its restructuring of combined-arms armies, and its growing presence beyond its borders — in Belarus and Syria, as well as in Crimea and the Donbas. U.S. military intelligence and U.S. military analysis were focused here and not on Ukraine. It is worth remembering, too, that the United Kingdom’s 2021 strategic defense review, “Global Britain in a Competitive Age: the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy,” named Russia as its principal adversary. Moreover, so focused was NATO on Russia that its attention, and with it the United States’, was concentrated on those members of the alliance that looked most vulnerable to Russia — the Baltic states and Poland. In 2016, a RAND study on reinforcing deterrence on Russia’s eastern flank war-gamed the defense of the Baltic states, not of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That attention to Russian capabilities focused on two that the United States expected to have an even greater salience in any expansion of the war in Ukraine than they have had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first was cyber warfare. Before the invasion of February 24, 2022, much of the Western narrative was disproportionately focused here, as though the war might be so restricted to cyberspace that it would replace more traditional and destructive forms of war. It was anticipated that, at the bare minimum, Russia would precede any invasion with a cyberattack. It did, but Ukraine’s cyber defenses proved equal to the task. It provided clear evidence of Russia’s intent, but it came so late, in the early hours of February 24, that it neither acted as an early warning of Russia’s intentions nor formed a dominant image of the invasion itself. More important, however, is that although cyber has been immensely important to both sides since February 2022, it has been as an enabler, not as a weapon of destruction in its own right. Traditional forms of combat have had as high a salience as activity in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second capability was “shock and awe,” the U.S. phrase coined to cover the establishment of rapid dominance over the enemy, especially through air power in the opening stages of a campaign. One of the reasons for the elevation of Russia’s military effectiveness was its massive superiority over Ukraine in the air, particularly in manned aircraft: 1,857 combat aircraft to 160. Because it would be unthinkable for a NATO land force to deploy without significant air assets, Ukraine’s weakness in this respect promised to become a besetting sin. The prewar commentary emphasized how Russia would — alongside a cyberattack — embark simultaneously on a “shock and awe” campaign directed at Ukrainian cities. An early air offensive would force Ukraine to choose whether to prioritize its ground forces in the field or its civilian air defenses to protect its population. This is not the place, nor would it be right, to play down the impact of Russian aircraft and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilians in 2022. Nonetheless, the point remains that the consequences of Ukraine’s inferiority in the air proved far less significant than first feared. The surprising conclusion from the opening year of the war proved to be the reverse of what was anticipated: Ukraine’s aerial defenses, especially over its major cities, were strikingly successful, and the numbers of civilian deaths lower than forecast. It is important to remember that the title “shock and awe” reflected not Russian doctrine but U.S. doctrine. Its use referred not to what might have happened in Ukraine in 2022, so much as what did happen in Iraq in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Shock and awe” especially showed how the United States was using mirror images of its adversary to guide its expectations and doing so in preference to sustained analysis of how to avoid or defend against air threats. Moreover, there was a further problem when the United States looked in the mirror. It confused its image of Russia with its image of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. commentators regularly cited two injunctions from their reading of Clausewitz’s On War. The first was Clausewitz’s reminder that the principal task of a state embarking on a war is to recognize the sort of war on which it is embarking and not to mistake it for something else. The second, and the one so often quoted that it is frequently identified simply by the adjective “Clausewitzian,” is that war is a continuation of policy by other means. It implies that war has utility as an instrument of state power. In the debate surrounding the post–9/11 wars, both aphorisms became accusations. The United States’ use of war over the first two decades of the twenty-first century proved an inadequate deliverer of effective outcomes. Neither in Afghanistan nor in Iraq did operations match their objectives. U.S. statesmen overpromised and underdelivered in both countries — and in Afghanistan catastrophically so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, Putin’s record in the same period seemed to be the exact opposite. One analyst described Putin as brilliant in his use of war in the pursuit of policy. Putin had come to power on the back of success in the Second Chechen War, so reversing the result of the First Chechen War; he took “southern Ossetia” from Georgia within days in 2008; he intervened in Syria in 2014–15 and shored up Bashar al-Assad’s stumbling regime; and in 2013–14, he took Crimea and a large chunk of eastern Ukraine. In this last instance, NATO was deterred from trying to stop him. Putin’s calculations seemed to be spot on and, therefore, war delivered on its political objectives. Putin’s record in the use of war was more obviously successful than that of any U.S. president since George H. W. Bush in the First Gulf War of 1990–91.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, another analyst, who served as an adviser to U.S. governments in the post–9/11 wars, spoke of Putin’s “undeniable genius.” Commentators constructed the successes against Ukraine in 2014 as the work of this genius, embodied in the use of “little green men” in “hybrid warfare” to achieve objectives in ways that made Russia’s role deniable. One analyst called this “liminal warfare.” One U.S. general, then the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, described it as “the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects of U.S. failure and Russia’s success in the use of force were threefold. First, NATO credited Russia with developing a new form of warfare — “hybrid war” or, in later versions, “gray-zone warfare.” Having created this fantasy, NATO turned it against itself and proceeded to doubt its own internal resilience when confronted by Russia. Second, NATO then emphasized Russia’s readiness to use force and politicized it to make the case for improving its own conventional defense. The Russian army, which had been discounted as corrupt and inefficient, was seen as having turned a corner, rooting out its problems and embracing reform and modernization. Although real enough, the evidence to support this interpretation was elevated for reasons that had more to do with the domestic politics of NATO member states. Third, the enhanced conventional capability delivered by Russia’s military reforms was reinforced by its apparent readiness to use tactical nuclear weapons, which in turn gave Putin escalation dominance before he invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The more nuanced findings of academic scholars working on the Russian military made little impact on these assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, Putin was unlikely to escalate the war in Ukraine to the nuclear level precisely because that could have provoked NATO to intervene. Russia would have lacked the strength to match NATO in a conventional conflict if that happened. The possibility of “vertical escalation” was further reduced by China’s warning to Russia that it would not tolerate the use of nuclear weapons, an approach fully consonant with China’s own policy of no first use. Nonetheless, Putin’s readiness to use force, reinforced by recurrent rhetoric to that effect, so grips Western imaginations — particularly in the upper reaches of the United States government — that the United States has been self-deterred. Consequently, despite being the weaker power, Russia has appeared to enjoy escalation dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War lies in the realm of contingency and uncertainty. Its course fluctuates, and its outcomes are unpredictable. For this reason, among others, the notion of “applied history” can be a false friend when it is used to analyze war and strategy. Some will say, with justification, that some of the predictions made before February 2022 began to look more sure-footed in 2024 as the war progressed through its third year. That may be true, but it still does not indicate how the war will end. At what proved to be the midpoints of the two world wars, in 1916 and 1941, the eventual victors were on the ropes as plans miscarried and losses mounted. What matters to this analysis is that critical early failings based on false assumptions can tend to have longer-term consequences than missteps later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opportunities to avoid the descent into war or to act preemptively could have forestalled war or ended it with the rapidity that gave rise to the short-war expectation in the first place. The result of flawed assessments before February 2022 wrong-footed the United States and its NATO allies and has left them struggling to catch up. The claim that they have been behind the curve of events in their support of Ukraine has persisted. Moreover, if the signals had been better read in advance, going back not just to late 2021 but instead to 2013, Ukraine’s supporters might have read them better, enabling an earlier resolution to the war or — even better — deterring the invasion in the first place. Applied history may not work, but that is not a reason for failing to consider the reasons for failure and for not endeavoring to do better next time by learning from experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprise occurs in many forms. Many think of it in terms of a surprise attack, but it occurs in other dimensions. The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is a good example: the attack was foreseen, but the immediate outcomes were astonishing. To use an old Soviet phrase, analysts misunderstood in fundamental ways the “correlation of forces.” Their judgments about Russian and Ukrainian military capacity were not merely off — they were wildly at variance with reality. And even more perplexing, leading and widely acknowledged experts misjudged with a degree of certainty that in retrospect is no less remarkable than the analytic failure itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their misjudgment was not a case of normal error or exaggeration. The expert community grossly overestimated Russian military capabilities, dismissed the chances of Ukraine resisting effectively, and presented the likely outcome of the war as quick and decisive. This analytic failure also had policy implications. Pessimism about Ukraine’s chances restricted military support before February 24, 2022. For years, voices in the analytic community argued publicly against providing crucial military aid for Ukraine precisely because Russia was presumably so strong that a war between the two countries, particularly a conventional one, would be over too quickly for the aid to make a significant difference. Once the war began, some of Ukraine’s most important international friends hesitated to supply advanced weapons, in part out of the mistaken belief that Ukraine would prove unable to use them or would be overrun before it could deploy them effectively. Today, such hesitation remains, with Ukraine still lacking the weapons systems it needs to defeat Russia in its relentless effort to destroy Ukraine as a state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definitiveness with which the experts made these erroneous assessments has not been sufficiently examined. Instead, analysts have resorted to a number of inadequate explanations or justifications for them. More to the point: the authors believe that consideration of these failures holds important lessons for other analytic communities, including those concerned with the military balance in the Indo-Pacific and other areas where the prospects of armed conflict are rising. Errors of comparable magnitude at the outset of a crisis leading to war can have profound and lingering effects. While some misjudgments are inevitable, ones that are wildly off are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to their general reading, the authors created a database of 181 pieces of research and analysis, mostly think tank reports and pieces released in major media outlets (see Appendix A), focusing on statements published in major journals, publications, and news networks, as well as commentary by acknowledged experts in the field. The investigation deals only with unclassified analyses of the Russian and Ukrainian militaries and the prospective war, though it appears, given the congressional testimony of senior U.S. intelligence leaders, that the intelligence communities in the United States and other countries made comparable errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors broke these sources down based on the sources’ views on the Russian military, the Ukrainian military, and how they believed a full-scale war between them would develop. What the authors found was a remarkable degree of consensus, which is reflected through the use of sources in this report. To show the impact of this analysis, the authors will quote regularly from major journals, prominent think tank reports, and popular media outlets such as prominent newspapers. While there were outliers (noted in the text), what was striking to the authors was the degree of unanimity in the core expert community, i.e., among those identifying themselves, and identified by others, as experts on the Russian military. There were diverging views, but often from sources outside this community — retired military officers who had participated in the training of the Ukrainian military after 2014, for example. The authors noted, finally, that judging by press reports, this consensus view was shared by the intelligence community in the United States. To discuss the findings of this investigation and the possible interpretations of the evidence, the authors convened three workshops. Attendees included senior intelligence analysts from the United States and the United Kingdom, military historians, former government officials, and experts from the United Kingdom and a number of Scandinavian and Baltic countries. While these discussions enriched the work considerably, responsibility for all arguments and conclusions rests with the authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some may doubt whether one should review in detail errors made two years ago and in a few (though not all) cases rectified within months. The authors disagree. Thorough consideration of why responsible and expert analysts made egregious misjudgments is the best way to avoid a similar outcome in this part of the world or elsewhere. What follows is the documentation and explanation of a large, consequential failure. The potential measures suggested at the end of report, including an uncompromising argument for curiosity, sensitivity to intangibles, and, above all, humility in the face of the uncertainties of war — have real and important implications for analysis in other areas as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-estimate&quot;&gt;The Estimate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ukraine’s paucity of air defences and the weakness of its armed forces means that Russia could drive to Kyiv perhaps as easily as American forces reached Baghdad in the Iraq war of 2003.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Russia has the ability to carry out a large-scale joint offensive operation involving tens of thousands of personnel, thousands of armored vehicles, and hundreds of combat aircraft. It would likely begin with devastating air and missile strikes from land, air, and naval forces, striking deep into Ukraine to attack headquarters, airfields, and logistics points. Ukrainian forces would begin the conflict nearly surrounded from the very start.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Russian military has repeatedly practiced the use of long-range strike and tactical fires cued by drones as well as other means of reconnaissance, both in training and in combat operations in Syria. Russia’s combat aircraft and strategic air defenses give Moscow many more options to control the air and to strike Ukrainian forces, and most Russian pilots have recent real-world experience in Syria.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If Russia decides to seize Ukraine, its attack will be multifaceted. Cyber attacks and sabotage will target economic and communications infrastructure. Agents provocateurs will begin causing chaos in the streets. Organised protests will erupt around the country. Ukrainian civic leaders deemed hostile to Russia will be assassinated. Internet access will likely be suppressed or corrupted, while false information will flood across the airwaves to spread panic and paralysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the same time, Russia has the capacity to conduct an extensive precision strike campaign against Ukrainian military installations using ballistic and cruise missiles and overwhelming airpower. This could suppress Ukrainian air defences, allowing for aviation assaults to seize key bridges, road junctions and critical infrastructure. The capture of these points would pave the way for rapid armoured thrusts with the use of massive artillery strikes to break up defensive strongpoints, and the isolation of key urban centres.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Russia’s military is far superior. Defense analysts say this gives Russia a range of options if it decides to escalate further, such as bolstering separatists fighting in the Donbas to a full-fledged assault aimed at seizing all of Ukraine. . . . Many defense experts note that Russia has undertaken a remarkable modernization effort since its war with Georgia in 2008, one that has transformed its Soviet-era force into an increasingly well-equipped and well-organized military. Additionally, its members have gained considerable combat experience in the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. . . . The great financial resources required to sustain Russia’s recent mobilization around Ukraine is illustrative of the wide disparity between the two countries’ military capabilities.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A Russian military campaign could range from standoff strikes to a largescale invasion of Ukraine’s eastern regions, the encirclement of Kyiv, and the taking of Odessa along the coast. The question is not what Russia can do militarily in Ukraine, since the answer is almost anything, but what kind of operation might attain lasting political gains.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the view of leading analysts before the Russian invasion on February 22, 2024, the Russian military was so powerful and multicapable that, when presented with an enemy such as Ukraine, it could do “almost anything.” A consensus coalesced around an extreme vision of what Russia could accomplish militarily and a correspondingly pessimistic view of Ukraine’s ability to resist. Analysts widely stated that Russia could open with a devastating blow in the first few hours, Kyiv could be surrounded or seized in a matter of days, and Ukraine could be defeated conventionally in a matter of weeks. Ukrainian citizens were portrayed as having little capacity to affect their fate, being left to choose between capitulation and guerrilla warfare in the cities or countryside. Compounding the discrepancy in military power, Ukrainian identity was so weak, analysts contended, and so enmeshed with Russia that Ukrainian resistance — particularly in the east of the country — would be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened was entirely different. From the outset, the Russian military exhibited major shortcomings. The inability of the Russian air force, for instance, to suppress Ukrainian air defenses and control the skies over the battlefield meant that Ukrainian forces, far from being devastated in the opening moments of the war, could maneuver and fight back effectively. Moreover, shortcomings in command and control and logistics meant that Russian forces had difficulty sustaining their advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian conventional resistance, which many had written off before the war, proved robust. The Ukrainian army, far from being swept off the battlefield, fought back effectively with quicker reactions and adaptations than its Russian enemy. Using mostly upgraded Soviet legacy systems, the Ukrainian army forced the Russian forces to retreat from Kyiv after a few weeks of fighting. In the ensuing months, Ukrainian forces compelled Russian forces to retreat from much of the eastern sector (particularly around the endangered city of Kharkiv) and retook the city of Kherson. Ukraine struck the Black Sea Fleet, opening up a vital sea-lane for its exports while denying Russia’s navy the offensive use of the maritime space. Further, Ukrainian forces have struck deep into Russia, though not on the scale of Russia’s continuing attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Since the summer of 2022, Ukraine has liberated far more of its territory than Russia has been able to seize in the opening months of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors have found little disagreement within the analytic community, most of which resides at semiofficial or official research organizations such as the RAND Corporation, the Center for Naval Analyses, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), and similar organizations. The number of analysts who publicly assessed the Russia-Ukraine military balance before the war and in its early stages and created the most detailed reports on the question was relatively small. Between 10 and 20 analysts dominated the community as the most widely cited and most prominent, receiving regular requests to brief governments and intelligence agencies. The consensus was broad and mutually affirming among this community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize that these assessments seem to have been largely shared within the U.S. government. Thus, a remarkable exchange between Senator Angus King and the then-director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, occurred in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on May 12, 2022:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Berrier: I think the Intelligence Community did a great job on this issue, Senator . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Senator King: General, how can you possibly say when we were told, explicitly, Kyiv would fall in 3 days and 2 Ukraine would fall in 2 weeks? You are telling me that was accurate intelligence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Berrier: So we were really focused on the Russian forces at the time, and so when we backed . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Senator King: And we were wrong about that too, were we not? We overestimated the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Berrier: Well, the Intelligence Community did a great job in predicting and talking . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Senator King: And I acknowledged that at the beginning of my question. I understand that. Yes, they did. What they failed at was predicting what was going to happen after Russia invaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;General Berrier: So as I look at the totality of the entire operation I think the enormity rests on the predictions of what the Russians were going to do versus whether or not the Ukrainians were going to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Senator King: Well, if you do not concede there was a problem on this then we have got a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And such assessments were believed at the top of the United States government and military. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was reported only two weeks before the invasion as saying that Kyiv could fall in 72 hours and having reported as much to members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessments-of-the-russian-military&quot;&gt;Assessments of the Russian Military&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The modernized and massive Russian military force that currently surrounds Ukraine on three sides can muster air and missile strikes that would likely overwhelm Ukrainian airpower and air defenses and severely damage military and other facilities. In particular, Russia’s Aerospace Forces, or VKS, are very different from a decade ago. They have new and modernized aircraft, along with better radar, communications, and targeting equipment. Pilots have generally flown more flight hours and received training in close air support and nighttime operations. And although they have little experience flying through hostile air defenses, 92 percent of VKS pilots have recent combat experience in Syria. The VKS also has adopted . . . more-effective countermeasures against man-portable or short-range air defenses such as Stinger missiles, including flying at higher altitudes.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Russian forces are not just better armed, but also more fleet-footed. Thanks to improvements in readiness, Russia could probably get 100,000 troops, complete with heavy armour, to a European hotspot within 30 days. NATO might struggle to muster half the number, of lighter forces, in that time. . . . Russia’s armed forces enjoy the additional advantage of being blooded in battle.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“They [the Russian military] could disorient the Ukrainian military and society so the conflict is basically over in a day or so.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prewar assessments of the Russian military focused on three key elements: organizational and technological modernization, sophisticated doctrine, and combat experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-modernized-combat-tested-military&quot;&gt;A Modernized, Combat-Tested Military&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts trace the modernization of the Russian military to 2008 and the “New Look” Russian military process. The key figure in this process was Russian minister of defense Anatoly Serdyukov, who served in that role from 2007 to 2012. Motivated by the poor performance of the Russian military in the invasion of Georgia, Moscow attempted to create the New Look military by expending large sums of money — an annual expenditure of somewhere between $150 and $180 billion, approximately 4 percent of Russian gross domestic product (GDP). The investment reportedly influenced all military domains, “from top to bottom,” covering air, sea, and land forces. In 2022, the International Institute for Strategic Studies reported that the reforms had “made Russia a far more capable military power today than at any time since the dissolution of the Soviet Union.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modernization took a number of forms. Older Soviet-era aircraft such as the Su-27 (Flanker) and the MiG-29 (Fulcrum) were phased out. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, these earlier aircraft were the mainstays of the Ukrainian air force but had since passed into obsolescence for the Russian military. In their place, Russia fielded a range of far more capable aircraft, including the two-seater Su-34 fighter/bomber and single-seater Su-35 fighter. The Su-34 was appraised to have performed very well in the bombing of Syria. These aircraft had capabilities that allowed them to engage enemy aircraft at much greater range than anything the Ukrainian military possessed; they were even considered extremely threatening to the air forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond aircraft, the Russian precision strike was said to have been significantly improved by the New Look reforms. The Russian navy deployed a large stock of sea-launched Kalibr missiles (used in Syria) while upgrading a number of ship and submarine classes. Reports stated that Russia was deploying hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, which would give the military great flexibility in targeting enemy assets, from government buildings to critical infrastructure to important military targets. At the time, reports claimed that there was no defense against this last system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the ground, much of the stress was on organizational changes. Analysts saw Russian land forces as having improved the quality of their soldiers by moving away from a majority conscript force toward more motivated and better-trained contract soldiers. At the same time, the Russian military reorganized their armed forces into innovative and highly effective battalion tactical groups (BTGs). These small infantry battalions, or fractions of them, were reinforced with armor, artillery, and other systems. Russian artillery and rocket capabilities, a traditional strength, reportedly surpassed U.S. capabilities in terms of range and effectiveness. Many experts assessed modernized Russian land forces as capable of quickly overwhelming NATO resistance in key areas along the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, RAND undertook a series of tabletop exercises to better understand the prospects for a Russian conventional attack in the Baltics. Based on open-source estimates, Russia could muster approximately 27 maneuver battalion tactical groups to attack the Baltic countries in a short-warning attack, supported by significant long-range fires. Assuming a week of warning, NATO could deploy 12 maneuver battalions. NATO forces, however, would be light, outgunned, and outmaneuvered by Russian heavier units, and fixed in place or destroyed while Russian forces maneuvered toward the capitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts assessed that, in addition to the modernization of key items of equipment and improved organization and terms of service, Russia had restored its Cold War edge in electronic warfare (EW). As part of Russia’s military modernization after its poor 2008 performance in Georgia, the Russian government heavily invested in improvements in this area. EW — described as the fight to control the “invisible” parts of warfare “by exploiting, deceiving, or denying enemy use of the [electromagnetic] spectrum while ensuring its use by friendly forces” — includes such activities as jamming communications, radar, and Global Positioning System signals, as well as various spoofing and deception activities in the electromagnetic spectrum. Analysts saw Russia as having steadily improved its capabilities in EW throughout the 2010s, while the United States and its NATO partners had let their EW capabilities “atrophy.” By 2022, these Russian improvements in EW had been so successful that they would likely have “an outsized negative impact on Russia’s adversaries.” Indeed, in testimony to the House of Commons just before the full-scale Russian invasion, one analyst claimed that Russia “might be the most capable military in the world in terms of electronic warfare capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond declaring the Russian military modernized and well equipped with some of the most advanced weapons in the world, analysts believed that the Russian military was doctrinally sophisticated. In particular, analysts stated that Russian doctrine — its concepts of operation — had evolved such that the Russian military need not rely on large forces of soldiers suffering significant losses to achieve their objectives. Doctrine, like artillery (and unlike, for example, proficiency in infantry tactics or small-unit leadership), has long been a Russian strength, building on sophisticated Soviet and even Tsarist military thought. During the later stages of the Cold War, Western analysts were particularly impressed by the quality of Soviet military literature, while military historians such as David Glantz painted a picture of the Soviet Union’s World War II performance as being at odds with the image of overwhelming but unsophisticated mass that had brought victory on the Eastern Front. Instead, analysts believed that Soviet operational art, derived from the work of pioneers such as Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Vladimir Triandafillov, animated the Soviet Union’s plans for deep operations — as well as, presumably, their ability to conduct them. Even as the Soviet Union weakened, Russian military leaders such as Chief of the General Staff Nikolai Ogarkov and General Makhmut Gareev had the respect of Western observers impressed by their portrayal of a revolution in military-technical affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cold War, despite Russia’s evident weaknesses, Western observers portrayed Russia as leading the way in hybrid warfare — the use of nontraditional means to achieve political goals with low levels of force. This doctrinal specialty in hybrid warfare, which could be used with or without more traditional, conventional means of war fighting, was often referred to as the Gerasimov doctrine, after General Valery Gerasimov, chief of Russia’s general staff and respected in the West as an original military thinker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to conventional warfare, analysts saw Russian doctrine as espousing “active defense,” an intelligent and multifaceted way of coping with a potentially larger and more technologically advanced enemy, such as NATO. Such a doctrine stressed avoiding dangerous offensives to preserve forces and prevent the extremely costly, if successful, attacks that characterized Soviet operations in World War II. Overall, analysts characterized Russian doctrine as looking for “smarter” ways to engage an opponent, with stress on long-range fires and artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts interpreted Russia’s successful execution of large-scale military maneuvers as a sign of its military progress. The Zapad exercises of 2017 and 2021, particularly the latter, supposedly demonstrated that Russia could quickly and efficiently deploy military forces over a large area. Even though few scripted impediments were in the way of Russian actions, analysts claimed that the ability to undertake these choreographed showpieces revealed very real capabilities. As one analyst claimed, Zapad 2021 “is not just military theater, it affirms that years of defense modernization and reform have made the Russian military a force with increased capability, readiness, and mobility.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to Russian strengths in equipment, organization, doctrine, and training, analysts noted that the Russian military, crucially, had proved itself in battle. This was particularly notable in Syria, where the Russian intervention began in 2015. Before this, the Russian armed forces exhibited serious deficiencies in the invasions of Chechnya and Georgia, and their command and control capabilities, particularly the ability to coordinate land and air forces, were seriously deficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts saw the Russian intervention in Syria as showing how much progress the Russian military had made and how prepared it was becoming to execute complex operations. According to the New York Times, quoting a number of the best-known analysts, “Russia used the war in Syria, experts say, as a laboratory to refine tactics and weaponry, and to gain combat experience for much of its force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While analysts noted how Russia’s experiences in Syria helped improve its EW and force deployment abilities, they claimed that the Russian air force had improved the most during the fighting in Syria, with both technological and operational improvements. The Russian military not only introduced a number of their newest aircraft into operations, but they also refined their tactics. In Syria, Russia flew a large number of missions, in particular attacking ground targets, many of them, admittedly, civilian. Flying approximately 9,000 sorties overall, at an average of 70–80 per day, the Russian air force learned a great deal about operating in combat conditions. By the end of the Syrian conflict, analysts considered the Russian air force greatly improved and highly effective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The five years of war in Syria have been the most intense period of transformation for the [Russian air force] since the war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The Russian military not only gained an unprecedented amount of experience, but also made substantial improvements in tactics and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-analysts-overlooked&quot;&gt;What Analysts Overlooked&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion of the Russian military generally avoided addressing some of the more intangible elements of military effectiveness. One of the most extreme examples was the almost total avoidance of commentary on the possible negative impact of systemic corruption, widespread in the regime of Russian president Vladimir Putin, on the performance of the Russian military. Although the upper echelon of the Russian military had clearly capitalized on access to the large amounts of money available for the new military, the analytic literature about the Russian military in the run-up to February 24, 2022, almost entirely avoided the word “corruption,” let alone assessing its likely implications for Russian military performance. Rather, “corruption” was far more commonly used with reference to weaknesses in the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When analysts mentioned corruption, it was almost always to say that the Russian military had been prone to corruption in the past but that this problem had been heavily attacked during the Serdyukov reforms. For instance, one of the most laudatory pieces written about Russian military modernization, published in The Economist, stated that the Russian military had improved so much by 2020 because corruption had been significantly reduced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After the Soviet Union’s collapse, Russia’s once-mighty armed forces were laid low. Moscow bus drivers outearned fighter pilots. Hungry soldiers were sent to forage for berries and mushrooms. Corruption was rife — one general was charged with renting out a mig-29 for illicit drag racing between cars and jets on a German airfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“No army in the world is in as wretched a state as ours,” lamented a defence minister in 1994. Yet few armies have bounced back as dramatically. In 2008 Russian forces bungled a war with Georgia. In response, they were transformed from top to bottom. . . . Though the days of renting out warplanes may be over, last year Russian military prosecutors announced that 2,800 military officials had been charged with corruption. The amount stolen totalled around $90m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, one of the few reports that mentioned Russian corruption as a possible negative factor was also one of the few to cast strong doubts on Russia’s ability to succeed in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts generally ignored the Russian logistical system, which in many ways failed during the full-scale invasion. A short War on the Rocks piece was one of the few analyses devoted solely to the subject. Larger studies, such as those on Russian modernization, usually asserted that Russia had the logistic lift needed to fulfill its strategic obligations without much evidence to back up that assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the few mentions of corruption and logistics in the functioning of the Russian military, the role of training and motivation in assessing Russian military performance was discussed more often (though considerably less often than issues such as technological modernization). However, the discussion of Russian recruitment, military training, and motivation usually focused on their presumed contribution to Russian military effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, analysts widely assumed that because Russia had moved away from reliance on conscripts, soldiers would have the high morale and motivation to do their jobs effectively. Analysts also stated that Russian soldiers would be well led and trained and able to efficiently execute complex operations. In fact, analysts declared this one of the main areas in which Russia’s military reform had made a massive difference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[In the past] senior officers sometimes lived in moldy, rat-infested tenements. And instead of socks, poorly trained soldiers often wrapped their feet in swaths of cloth, the way their Soviet and Tsarist predecessors had. Two decades later, it is a far different fighting force that has massed near the border with Ukraine. Under Mr. Putin’s leadership, it has been overhauled into a modern sophisticated army, able to deploy quickly and with lethal effect in conventional conflicts, military analysts said. It features precision-guided weaponry, a newly streamlined command structure and well-fed and professional soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, when analysts compared the Russian army to the Ukrainian army, they highlighted the Russian army’s significant advantages in experience, training, and leadership. The Russian army operated their new advanced equipment with high levels of “readiness” and their soldiers were being led by “officers bloodied in several conflicts, such as the war in Syria,” which would ostensibly give the Russian forces “quantitative and qualitative” superiority over the Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessment-of-the-ukrainian-military&quot;&gt;Assessment of the Ukrainian Military&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ukraine does not have anywhere near enough forces to credibly defend against all the potential avenues of attack, which means it would have to choose between defending a select set of fixed strong points — ceding control of other areas — or maneuvering to engage Russian forces that outnumber them. The line of conflict in the Donbas will be but one of many fronts. The Ukrainian fortifications there may well look like a modern-day Maginot Line: prepared for a frontal attack that may never come and bypassed by the mobile forces of an adversary with more-advanced aircraft and more-mobile land forces.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If it quickly found itself overwhelmed, Ukraine’s military could embrace guerrilla warfare, breaking itself into smaller tactical formations with maximum autonomy. That would entail abandoning most of its heavy armor and artillery and focusing instead on infantry armed with shoulder-fired missiles to hit tanks or aircraft. . . . Ukrainian air defenses are in short supply, and they would be unlikely to provide effective cover for most of the country’s ground troops. They would be quickly overwhelmed.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The implication for a battle in Ukraine is that where Russian armored units wish to succeed, they will pour vast firepower on defending Ukrainian troops, and then try to overwhelm them with superior numbers. This is how the Soviets planned to fight NATO, and this is how the Russians would likely attack the Ukrainians. Javelins and Stingers can certainly make the Russians pay, because they are indeed great weapons, but they are unlikely to change the operational outcomes. Ukrainian units would no doubt fight bravely, but given the geography of the country, the open topography of much of its landscape, and the overall numerical superiority that Russia enjoys, it is unlikely that Ukraine will be able to defend itself successfully.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts portrayed the ability of the Ukrainian military and Ukrainian society to defend itself very differently from Russia’s ability to invade and dominate Ukraine. In the first case, compared to the analyses of Russia, relatively little was written about Ukraine, and Ukrainian capabilities were not subjected to detailed analysis. As such, analyses of the Ukrainian military tended to stress its limitations and inability to defend the country, often focusing on the supposed differences in the capabilities of Russian and Ukrainian equipment and weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second case, whereas there was almost no discussion of how Russian society and politics would diminish Russian military capabilities (and very little discussion of corruption or the degrading influence of Putin’s dictatorship), a great deal of discussion addressed Ukraine’s supposed weakness in these areas. Some analysts considered Ukrainian society lacking in unity, torn between a Russian-speaking east and a Ukrainian-identifying west. Moreover, analysts claimed that the Ukrainian state, with a recent history of disunity and corruption, was a real handicap to Ukrainian resistance. Ukraine could even be portrayed as a failing state, especially compared to the supposedly effective and strategic Russian one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, analysts had a much greater focus on Ukrainian weakness and Russian strength. Possible sources of Ukrainian strength — for example, its political transformation following the Revolution of Dignity (or Maidan Revolution) in 2014 — were rarely considered. Above all, the history of Ukraine’s tenacious resistance to Russia for more than a century received little attention, and evidence of Ukrainian tactical successes at the end of the most intense period of conflict in the Donbas failed to gain traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;analysis-of-the-ukrainian-military-and-ukrainian-society-and-politics&quot;&gt;Analysis of the Ukrainian Military and Ukrainian Society and Politics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important point is the lack of analyses of the Ukrainian military as a stand-alone institution. Major think tanks published fewer than five reports on a possible war with Russia from a Ukrainian perspective, and all were pessimistic about Ukraine’s chances to conventionally resist a full-scale Russian invasion. All were published only a few weeks or months before February 24, 2022. Therefore, analysts made seemingly little effort to look at the Ukrainian military from a long-term perspective or to consider its institutional evolution and development, particularly since the 2014 war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More commonly, analysts compared the Ukrainian military only with the Russian military, usually as a much smaller addendum, and from that concluded that Ukraine was severely outmatched. The Ukrainian navy was barely worth mentioning, described as “insufficient” to deter Russia in any meaningful way. Analysts claimed that when it came to antiair capabilities, Ukraine was operating at a huge disadvantage, with its systems “woefully deficient in both quantity and quality.” The Russian military in any war would likely make Ukrainian “ground-based early warning radar stations” a “primary” target. Thus, Ukrainian fixed-wing aircraft would have to approach combat with its modernized Russian enemy at a massive disadvantage — flying almost blind. According to one analyst, “Put simply, the [Ukrainian Air Force] will be rapidly destroyed if it attempts to directly oppose [Russian] fixed wing sorties near the lines of contact.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Ukrainian navy were inconsequential and the Ukrainian air force unable to contend with the Russian forces, analysts would at least consider the relatively large and combat-experienced Ukrainian army powerful enough to challenge the Russian army. Since 2014, the Ukrainian army has been continually engaged against Russian forces and their surrogate forces in Donetsk and Luhansk. In that time, the Ukrainian forces suffered thousands of deaths but also gained combat experience and, as time went on, improved their performance and capabilities. However, that seemed to matter little compared to the Russian forces they expected to fight. If the Ukrainian forces had improved, the Russian forces had trumped them with the New Look reforms and Russian military experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although reliable numbers are hard to come by, Ukraine’s ground forces might field 50 to 60 battalions against the more than 120 currently mustered by the Russian army, and these battalions do not have the same levels of combat effectiveness. Russia has far more — and far better — artillery, reconnaissance, and logistical capabilities than Ukraine does. The Russian military would have the advantage along every axis of attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when the Ukrainian forces claimed that they had improved as a fighting force and could meet the Russian forces in the open field, the analytic community disagreed with the assessment of the Ukrainian military. As one report published just before the full-scale invasion read: “Despite the imminent threat of invasion, the Ukrainian military projects an aura of calm confidence in its capabilities. Any assessment of Ukraine’s conventional forces makes this attitude difficult to understand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;corruption-and-identity&quot;&gt;Corruption and Identity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason analysts believed that the Ukrainian military could not put up effective conventional resistance to a full-scale Russian invasion was that they doubted Ukraine’s fundamental powers of resistance — both the trustworthiness of its system and the commitment of a large percentage of its population. Analysts often mentioned Ukraine as a weak and shaky political and national construct or “the closest thing Europe has to a failed state.” The single most common reason analysts considered Ukraine so systemically weak was that it was supposedly riddled by corruption. According to one RUSI report, Ukrainian corruption was a “legitimate concern” restraining financial aid for Ukraine. Moreover, Ukraine was caught in a catch-22, unable to “tackle corruption” because Russia was destabilizing it. This connection between Ukrainian corruption and the difficulty it would face resisting Russian aggression was also made in a RAND blog post claiming that, over time, “discouraging Russian imperial coercion may depend in large part on whether Ukraine overcomes poverty and stifling corruption and becomes a resilient democracy.” Analysts used the supposed damaging inability of even Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to do anything about corruption to describe his government as weak: “Zelensky’s administration also appears weak and increasingly desperate to find domestic support. He has not done much to reduce corruption or to separate Ukraine from its long tradition of oligarchic rule.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the issue of corruption were not enough, analysts often portrayed Ukrainians as lacking a strong national identity, certainly one that called into question whether a large part of the population would fight for its existence. Russia’s illegal seizure of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk in 2014 seemed to have exacerbated this view. The Council of Foreign Relations wrote in 2014 that the “country of forty-five million people has struggled with its identity since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ukraine has failed to resolve its internal divisions and build strong political institutions, hampering its ability to implement economic reforms.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts usually connected the idea that Ukrainians had a weak identity to the fact that a large percentage of the population had linguistic, cultural, and even strong economic ties to Russia. As a Congressional Research Service report released in late 2021 commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most Ukrainians can speak Russian, whether as a primary or secondary language. In Ukraine’s last national census (2001), 17% of the population identified as ethnic Russians, mostly concentrated in the south (Crimea) and east, where ties to Russia are stronger than in the rest of the country. In Soviet times, eastern Ukraine became home to a heavy industrial and defense production sector that retained close economic ties to Russia after independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts used this weakness in Ukrainian identity to cast doubt on whether Ukraine could muster an effective insurgency once it, as expected, lost a conventional war. One prominent analyst, in an article titled “Why a Ukrainian Insurgency against Russia Is Likely to Fail,” argued, “The Russian and Ukrainian cultures are rather similar, whether in terms of language, culture or history.” This similarity, he claimed, would allow Russian occupiers to appeal to conquered Ukrainians’ sense of “normalcy.” Another analyst, speaking in a Center for a New American Security podcast released on February 14, 2022, used similar language when asked about a possible Ukrainian insurgency: “So, it is hard to tell whether or not there is going to be a true uprising against a Russian invasion or people in certain parts of the country are going to say, ‘Well, I can deal with this for a while; it’s not a big change.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question of a weak or even pro-Russian Ukrainian identity opens up a reverse question about the constitution of the analytic community. It is practically impossible to find an analyst who identified as a Ukrainian specialist before the 2022 invasion. Most were analysts of the Russian military who had spent much of their time studying Russian policy and practice in its involvement in Ukraine. For this reason, few reports specifically addressed Ukraine, whereas analysts constantly published reports on Russian policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessments-of-the-russian-and-ukrainian-militaries-in-the-donbas&quot;&gt;Assessments of the Russian and Ukrainian Militaries in the Donbas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian and Ukrainian militaries were engaged in almost constant combat for years before February 24, 2022 — particularly in the Donbas, illegally seized by Russian forces starting in 2014. The analytic community discussed this war in the Donbas often in the context of the supposed overall improvement of Russian capabilities. This in itself is noteworthy because, as analyses also mentioned, fighting in the Donbas did not lead to major Russian advances and, in time, actually evidenced improvements in Ukrainian performance. However, such phenomena, which pointed to Russian shortcomings and Ukrainian improvements in the Donbas, did not lead to a recalibration in the overall analysis of what would happen if the Russian military launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all the Russian successes in the Donbas occurred in 2014 and 2015 at the start of the fighting. Russian deployments to the Ukrainian border throughout 2014 reportedly had achieved substantial logistical successes, proving Russia’s ability to “maintain large formations in the field after rapid deployments and sustain them over extended periods with little obvious degradation in performance.” Furthermore, its operations in Ukraine (and Syria) allowed the Russian military to carry out a roulement of troops across its armed forces to the Ukrainian border, allowing its personnel to gain more practical experience than they would have obtained through exercises: “Ukraine, in particular, has provided Russia with valuable experience fighting a contemporary enemy of comparable capability, in combat involving heavy use of main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential of the Russian armed forces in a combat scenario was evident, in particular, during the two large-scale ground offensives in the summer of 2014 and January 2015. Russia deployed thousands of troops to eastern Ukraine and used massive artillery fire to hit Ukrainian troops at range. On July 11, 2014, near the Ukrainian village of Zelenopillya, Russia conducted a short but highly effective artillery strike that killed over 30 Ukrainian soldiers previously spotted by a UAV, wounded another 100, and destroyed two battalions’ worth of vehicles and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Donbas, irregular troops — namely, separatist militias — were employed in the first line of engagement, decreasing the casualty rate of the regular Russian army while providing intelligence and reconnaissance to artillery brigades. These volunteer militias were led by “retired” Russian military officers and equipped with limited amounts of artillery, armored vehicles, and antiaircraft missiles. Regular troops were used only “against significant Ukrainian targets using traditional equipment such as main battle tanks, as well as modern communications and reconnaissance drones.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia’s offensives in Ukraine from 2014 onward characteristically used proxies, irregular forces, disinformation, and cyberattacks. These forms of covert warfare accompanied conventional military operations. At first, Russia achieved tangible results particularly in its occupation of Crimea, and the Kremlin succeeded in temporarily paralyzing the Ukrainian government and multilateral institutions. However, operations soon evolved into an ongoing and inconclusive conflict with Ukrainian troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2015, when the Minsk II agreement was signed, no significant Russian offensive operation has occurred in the Donbas, and the line of contact has remained static. Kinetic activity has been limited to sporadic shelling and exchange of fire along the front:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There has been regular, low-level fighting across the LoC, with often-daily loss of life on both sides. That low-level engagement has been punctured by periodic escalations, such as the fighting around the town of Mariinka in summer 2015. This calibrated coercion has drained Ukraine of financial, human, and political resources and put Russia in position to have a decisive say in the international diplomacy regarding the crisis. But Moscow has not sought military victory — e.g., a routing of the Ukrainian military or a significant expansion of rebel-held territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s approach to the war in the Donbas has been termed “calibrated coercion,” meaning that the Kremlin has sought neither a major escalation nor a ceasefire. Rather, it has used proxy forces to maintain a “simmering” conflict, aiming to keep a lever of influence on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Russia has failed to seize more Ukrainian territory since 2015, primarily due to Ukrainian military improvement. Between 2014 and the February 2022 invasion, Ukraine was engaged in constant low-intensity combat. Ukrainian military officers were thus confident that their troops would be better trained and prepared in case of a large-scale conflict with Russia. The major problem during the Donbas war concerned numbers: the Ukrainian armed forces had limited personnel and reserves. The problems with retaining a sufficient force stemmed primarily from poor salaries and short-term contracts, which caused high turnover of personnel. However, this turnover meant that a large number of Ukrainians had military experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue concerned the shortage of missile and artillery troops and ammunition due to the pre-2014 pro-Russian government of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, which carried out a systematic reduction of missile and artillery personnel and weapons. Due to these shortfalls, officers on the battlefield had to face a challenging situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With 10 brigades covering the entire line of contact in the JFO [ Joint Forces Operation], a brigade frontage at the start of the war was around 20 km. This left a limited reserve and depended on a manoeuvre defence to counterattack against breaches in the line. Each brigade started the war with around 10 days of ammunition, but there was limited confidence — given the threat from artillery — that more would reach the lines if the Russians committed all their capabilities to this axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Battle of Ilovaisk in August 2014 was a turning point for the future of the Ukrainian armed forces. After surrounding the town, Russia targeted Ukraine’s forces with massive shelling that left hundreds of soldiers dead and forced those remaining to retreat and surrender the town to Russian-backed separatists. Following the bloody defeat, Ukraine’s military establishment began a round of reforms. Three key changes occurred before 2016:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukrainian society mobilized, which would become paramount to financing and supplying the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The government allowed the formation of militias, which led to the creation of 50 volunteer battalions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conscription was introduced, acknowledging the need for a standing army.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes were followed by what has been labeled a new “hybrid transformation model,” resulting in the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a more effective command and control structure&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the development of a noncommissioned officer corps and special forces operators&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;specific procurement objectives&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;increased training, advisory, and intelligence support from NATO countries&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;strengthening of mission command&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After March 2014, Ukraine focused on rebuilding its artillery capabilities, leading to five new artillery brigades and one new artillery regiment by 2019, which doubled the number of artillery battalions Ukraine had and made it the second-largest artillery force in Europe behind Russia. There were also significant qualitative improvements in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; counterbattery fire; and combat control systems like the Kropyva. Improvements in the use of the latter led to an 80 percent reduction in deployment time for artillery units. Ukraine’s defense establishment also increased the number of tank units between 2014 and 2018, though tanks were employed more as a source of indirect fire than direct action during the conflict in the Donbas. However, while a constant lack of funds prevented the purchase of new tanks, it did allow the modernization of the existing fleet of T-64s and T-64Bs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning antitank capabilities, Ukraine established a school of antitank artillery, and the Ministry of Defence purchased several antitank missile systems — at least 650 Stugna-P and Korsar systems and about 7,000 accompanying missiles, 150 tower systems for armored vehicles with dual antitank missiles and 900 additional accompanying missiles, and 1,600 Cobra and Kombat guided missiles for tank missile systems. Since Russian precision strikes targeted several industrial and energy facilities located in the Donbas, the Ukrainian military enhanced its antiair capabilities by modernizing its radio and radar systems to ensure that it could detect enemy aircraft and missiles from a distance of 300–400 kilometers. Although Ukraine had put major efforts into modernizing and repairing its aircraft since 2014, analysts still considered its air force overmatched from a technical point of view by Russia’s VKS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, while analysts saw the opening of fighting in the Donbas as an indicator of growing Russian military efficiency, the improvements the Ukrainian forces demonstrated after 2015, while acknowledged, seemed to play little role in challenging the narrative that Ukraine would be overrun in a full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-of-war&quot;&gt;Understanding of War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If Russia really wants to unleash its conventional capabilities, they could inflict massive damage in a very short period of time . . . They can devastate the Ukrainian military in the east really quickly, within the first 30–40 minutes.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Russian military forces — including elements of the 41st Combined Field Army and 144th Guards Motorized Rifle Division . . . would likely outmatch Ukrainian conventional forces and overrun Kiev in a matter of hours if they invaded.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Russia’s military superiority would enable it to overrun Ukraine’s army in weeks by launching assaults on multiple fronts — including from Belarus and the Black Sea, according to [one analyst]: ‘They’re defending the eastern flank of the largest country in Europe and what do they have? They could very easily be cut off and isolated in the eastern part of Ukraine, which is why they may find themselves fighting an organised retreat if faced with a multipronged attack.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one thing stands out in the analysis of what a war between Ukraine and Russia would look like, it is the extraordinary specificity about how little time it would take the Russian military to achieve its goals and the great speed with which it would move through Ukrainian defenses. One analyst claimed that Russia could “devastate” Ukrainian forces in the east of the country in less than an hour and disorient Ukraine to such an extent that the war would be “basically over in a day or so.” Another said the Russian army could overrun the Ukrainian army in “weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts saw the conventional part of any Russian invasion happening with fast and brutal efficiency, as Russia could effectively deploy military systems to have an “overwhelming” and immediate impact on overmatched Ukrainians. In some ways, the analysis positioned the Russian military as comparable to, if somewhat smaller and less proficient than, the U.S. military. Any full-scale Russian invasion, analysts declared, would start with a shock-and-awe campaign — a direct echo of the U.S. attack on Iraq in 2003 — with Russia assuming (or indeed exceeding) a role akin to that of the United States in its ability to impose itself militarily on its supposedly overmatched foe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key elements of this first stage would be Russia’s long-range strike capability, which analysts assumed would allow Russia to precisely hit almost any Ukrainian target. Analysts also widely stated that these strike capabilities would combine with Russia’s powerful cyber capabilities to degrade Ukrainian systems and “degrade, fragment and paralyze” the Ukrainian armed force and government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One analyst described this as part of Russian military thinking and a sign of Russia’s strengths in the operational art:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many Russian concepts of operation emphasize a short and intense “Initial Period of War” that may produce decisive effects even before ground forces are fully committed. Standoff weapons — bombs, precision-guided missiles — are unleashed against enemy forces and the infrastructure that sustains the fight: military bases, forward-deployed units, air defense sites, airfields, key transportation nodes, fuel depots, command-and-control targets, power plants, even local news organizations. The aim is to force the enemy government to capitulate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts saw the time it would take Russia to inflict such devastating damage as remarkably short — a matter of days or even hours. Russian missiles were supposedly so accurate that Ukraine had no ability to counter them. One analyst summed up all of these visions at once:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As it stands, Russia is likely to begin any full-scale invasion with a lethal and largely unchallenged assault by bombers, ballistic missiles and artillery, said [one analyst]. “The shock and awe campaign they can launch with those resources against entrenched Ukrainian forces before the main ground invasion begins will be truly devastating,” he said. “The Ukrainian military has no answer for these weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the quick, destructive opening precision-fire phase of the Russian invasion was over, the Russian army would leap into action with its fast-moving and hard-hitting armored forces in a “combined arms ground offensive.” Spread out around Ukraine in a long arc reaching from west of Kyiv in Belarus, around Kharkiv, through Donetsk and Luhansk, and poised to come north out of Crimea, Russian forces were said to be well placed to create maximum problems for the Ukrainian defenders. Indeed, even though many of the same analysts would later claim that it was a mistake for the Russian forces to have developed such a wide, multi-axis offensive plan, analysts before February 24, 2022, broadly saw this as one of the key elements of likely Russian success. They said the Russian military had spread out its forces so much that Ukrainian defensive planning was far more difficult, forcing Ukraine to spread its supposedly less powerful forces too thinly to defend against all possible Russian attacks. As one report put it, “For Ukrainian forces to commit to denying one axis would simply leave another avenue of advance undefended.” Another paper described five axes of Russian advance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Due to the length of the Ukrainian border, Russia has multiple axes along which it could potentially invade. The first axis, and the most direct, could involve a push west from Rostov Oblast, reinforcing the DPR (Donetsk People’s Republic) and LPR (Luhansk People’s Republic) and assaulting the line of contact. The second axis would be to push south from Russia’s Belgorod Oblast. A third axis would be to push north from Crimea. If performed in conjunction with the second axis, Russian forces could rapidly cut off the JFO. Two further axes have been opened through Russia’s deployment of troops to Belarus. Fourth would be to push south from the Gomel region of Belarus, to encircle or overrun Kyiv, and a fifth would be to push south from Brest, to physically block Ukraine from receiving assistance overland from NATO countries. It is likely that in any conventional invasion Russia would push on all of these axes to fix Ukrainian forces, but weigh the main effort to target Kyiv, or to break the core of the Ukrainian army in the JFO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most assessments of the correlation of forces lead to an expectation that Kyiv would be enveloped within days if Russia committed to an all out assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, analysts considered the Russian forces massed on the Ukrainian border, which numbered around 200,000, more than adequate to do the job — though after the initial invasion failed many would claim that the Russian army had been too small. As one analytic blog stated before the invasion,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Moscow has amassed enough forces to conduct the largest combined arms operation since the Battle of Berlin in 1945. This could involve an onslaught from Crimea in the south, Russia in the east, and Belarus in the north. Moscow could pursue a “thunder run” south from Belarus with the aim of quickly encircling Kyiv and causing the government to surrender or to collapse and install a puppet regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the best way to understand how analysts saw the Russian army as an overwhelming threat to Ukraine is to look at a number of the maps generated on or just before February 24, 2022, claiming to show how a Russian invasion could progress. In their scope, the maps were as least as ambitious as the Russian invasion itself — and in some cases even more ambitious, depicting Russian thrusts farther to the northwest than the Russian military actually attempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Russian army moved forward in the combined arms stage of the invasion, analysts predicted, the war would end quickly. The Ukrainian military would have little to no chance out in the open, and the Russian forces would drive almost anywhere they wanted, at least in the east of the country. One typical comparison matched the speed of U.S. military operations with Russian capabilities: “Ukraine’s paucity of air defences and the weakness of its armed forces means that Russia could drive to Kyiv perhaps as easily as American forces reached Baghdad in the Iraq war of 2003.” Indeed, for some prominent analysts, the ultimate question was not whether Russia could succeed militarily in Ukraine but how much of the country Putin would take. Would he want all of Ukraine, most of Ukraine, or just parts of the east while installing a puppet regime in Kyiv? One prominent analyst theorized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A full land invasion could entail Russia seizing as much as two-thirds of Ukraine’s territory by deploying troops from the eastern border, Belarus, Crimea and the Black Sea. . . . The big question is, will they look to conduct regime change and then a settlement? Or are they actually intending on partitioning Ukraine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show just how little chance analysts thought Ukraine had in a conventional war and how little they discussed the chance of Ukraine surviving, it is worth looking at something analysts discussed in detail — whether Ukrainian forces should, or even could, fight on as insurgents. A great deal of talk, much of it skeptical, surrounded the prospects of a Ukrainian insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts discussed two kinds of insurgency: (1) a campaign of urban resistance centered on Kyiv and the other large cities and (2) a regional campaign, likely in the west of the country only. The urban campaign was thought to be possible because the Ukrainian army stood no chance of fighting the Russian army in the open and therefore might retreat into the cities. Analysts saw this as a potentially promising move as it would allow the Ukrainian forces to exact higher casualties from the Russian forces than they could in a conventional war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regional resistance campaign clearly fed on many of the stereotypical views of eastern Ukrainians, who would supposedly adjust to Russian rule in a relatively straightforward way, and western Ukrainians, who would be willing to resist with greater determination:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the case of Ukraine, a war would have a host of potential long-term consequences. Ukrainian resistance might live on as an insurgency, although, paradoxically, it would be most successful in the one part of the country Russia is unlikely to invade — its west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, analysts did not see either of these campaigns as a path toward a Ukrainian victory; the campaigns were rather seen as ways to make the conquest of part, or even all, of Ukraine more painful for Russia. Even then, analysts argued against encouraging Ukraine to start an insurgency on grounds of cost, Ukraine’s supposedly weak sense of national identity, and the low chance of success. In terms of cost, if Ukrainians resorted to insurgency, the Russian reaction would be so brutal, it would be “catastrophic.” Indeed, those who argued against aiding Ukraine claimed that helping the Ukrainians prepare for an insurgency would only worsen their suffering. Moreover, the argument went, Ukrainian resistance would be less effective than pro-Ukrainian optimists thought because it was not clear how many Ukrainians would really strongly resist the Russian invaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analogy to the U.S. invasions of Iraq in 1991 and 2003 was a poor one. In retrospect, allied forces attacking Iraq in 1991 substantially outnumbered their opponents, who were confronted with the full weight of U.S. air and land power near its Cold War height. In 2003, an Iraq weakened by postwar sanctions and isolation was in no position to put up more than sporadic resistance. At the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the differences between the Russian and U.S. militaries were vast. Russia could not orchestrate the intense, continual coordinated air attacks the United States could in 1991 and 2003. Further, the Russian army could not outclass its enemy in everything from technology to training and organization as the United States had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking omissions in the prewar analytic literature was the failure to acknowledge the fundamental unpredictability of war. Analysts portrayed war as a matter of equipment and doctrine, something that could be planned and executed, more as a complex engineering project than as a contest of will, military skill, and personalities. Friction, the fog of war, and the unpredictable nature of military interaction on the battlefield were all notable in their absence from the analyses. This fact is not entirely surprising: the analysts, by and large, were not military historians but analysts of the Russian military and as such seemed not to have thought about war in this broader way. Analysts evinced little humility about their ability to predict the outcome of combat operations, which is, indeed, one of the most striking characteristics of these assessments. Many of the most prominent analyses lacked reservations, qualifications, or simply acknowledgment of the imponderables of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-advocacy&quot;&gt;Policy Advocacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Notionally, helping Ukraine is admirable, but the lack of public discussion and suddenness of this announcement are worrisome. While arming Kiev may seem like an easy political win, it is poor policy. The idea of providing Ukraine with $50 million-worth of anti-tank missiles is eerily reminiscent of Washington’s halfhearted efforts to train and arm the moderate Syrian opposition. . . . The proposal to send arms to Kiev is also untimely. Ukraine has not seen a Russian offensive, or lost significant territory to Russia, in more than two years. Of all the possible ways to help the country improve its armed forces, dumping missiles on an unreformed military hardly seems the smart way forward. This is the time to help the country transform, not play geopolitical checkers with missiles.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The only weapons systems that could plausibly impose costs that could change Russia’s calculus, such as surface-to-air missiles and combat aircraft, are ones that the United States would be highly unlikely to provide the Ukrainians. And, regardless, they could not be procured, delivered, and be made operational — to say nothing of getting the Ukrainian operators trained up to use them — in time to have an impact on this crisis.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“One issue when looking at equipping the Ukrainian military is that even if we provide them with very capable conventional weapons systems, if they get into a conventional fight with the Russian military, they are not going to win. A conventional fight is often going to be very lethal and very fast. We should be looking at how we can better equip Ukraine to fight unconventionally against the Russian military.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analytic consensus before the war was that Russia was a great power with a modernized and battle-tested military that could project overwhelming force on Ukraine. Ukraine, in comparison, was riddled with corruption and ethnic divisions and had a military that could not compete in a conventional war. Such strong, almost unequivocal language would have qualified as a form of policy advocacy. Helping a corrupt and divided Ukraine against such a mighty Russian military was, after all, bound to be futile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the analytic community went beyond using leading language and at times argued specifically against arming Ukraine with advanced weapons and capabilities. Maybe the first example came in 2017 when policymakers seriously discussed sending U.S. antitank missiles to Ukraine. One analyst in a New York Times op-ed warned against sending U.S. missiles to Ukraine, touching on many of the same themes that would typify the discussion of Russia and Ukraine over the coming years. First, Ukraine was primarily of Russian, not U.S., interest. Moreover, Russian “military superiority [was] well established.” The Ukrainian military was “unreformed” and moreover was regularly losing on the battlefield with its own antitank missiles. Ultimately, the analyst concluded, arming Ukraine with U.S. antitank missiles would be a pointless signal to Moscow and would not change the balance of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A widely discussed essay titled “The West’s Weapons Won’t Make Any Difference to Ukraine” — published by one institution as “U.S. Military Aid to Ukraine: A Silver Bullet?” — used similar rhetoric. The piece argued against sending antiair weapons to Ukraine because even with such aid, Russia would overwhelm Ukraine in a conventional war. The authors gave an overview of any likely invasion that followed all of the analytic errors described above. This textbook case exemplifies how the analytic community viewed the military balance between Russia and Ukraine and how it viewed the war as developing from the opening strike phase through a possible insurgency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia has the ability to carry out a large-scale joint offensive operation involving tens of thousands of personnel, thousands of armored vehicles, and hundreds of combat aircraft. It would likely begin with devastating air and missile strikes from land, air, and naval forces, striking deep into Ukraine to attack headquarters, airfields, and logistics points. Ukrainian forces would begin the conflict nearly surrounded from the very start, with Russian forces arrayed along the eastern border, naval and amphibious forces threatening from the Black Sea in the south, and the potential (increasingly real) for additional Russian forces to deploy into Belarus and threaten from the north, where the border is less than 65 miles from Kyiv itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In short, this war will look nothing like the status quo ante of conflict in Ukraine, and that undermines the first justification for U.S. aid: deterring Russia. The Ukrainian military has been shaped to fight the conflict in the Donbas and thus poses little deterrent threat to Russia; provision of U.S. weapons can do nothing to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, Russia had Ukraine surrounded; was expert in joint operations from land, sea, and air; and would open the campaign with devastating missile and air strikes on Ukrainian logistics, command and control, and military bases. The Ukrainian military, on the other hand, had been shaped to fight a much smaller conflict in the Donbas and had little capacity to deter the larger Russian military. Moreover, the conventional part of the war would be over so quickly, Ukraine would not be able to train to make U.S. weapons operational. As such, U.S. weapons could “do nothing” to change the equation. The authors stated, “In short, the military balance between Russia and Ukraine is so lopsided in Moscow’s favor that any assistance Washington might provide in coming weeks would be largely irrelevant in determining the outcome of a conflict should it begin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having dispensed with any chance for a successful Ukrainian resistance in a conventional war, the authors stated that Western assistance would not help much even in an insurgency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If Russia attempts a long-term occupation of areas with lots of hostile Ukrainians, these forms of support could, on the margins, complicate matters for Moscow. But U.S. support to a Ukrainian insurgency should be a matter of last resort during an extended conflict, not a centerpiece of policy before it has even started. The prospect of a marginally more costly occupation is unlikely to make a difference to Moscow if it gets to that stage; it will have already absorbed far more significant costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support to any insurgency should be resisted as the costs would be borne by the Ukrainians. The United States, the authors argued, should “wish” that its partners, the Ukrainians, would not have to suffer so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the analytic community created a catch-22 with respect to military aid to Ukraine. Analysts clearly stated to politicians that Russia was so strong and Ukraine so weak that nations should not aid Ukraine to compensate for its weakness. Just 16 days before the full-scale Russian invasion, one analyst told the UK House of Commons Select Committee on Defence that providing Ukraine with weapons to fight a conventional war was pointless because Ukraine “was not going to win”; the Russian military would be too “lethal and fast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the analytic community was generally skeptical about aiding Ukraine because it had such an elevated view of Russian military capabilities vis-à-vis Ukrainian capabilities, it is also worth noting that some in the U.S. think tank community made another strong argument against arming Ukraine. Drawing on older U.S. foreign predilections as well as dissatisfaction with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, think tanks such as the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft offered a policy of restraint. In addition to principled opposition to U.S. entanglement in this conflict and a belief that conventional military aid to Ukraine would be fruitless, some holding this position argued that aiding an insurgency was not only pointless; it was also wrong — as it would be better to keep good relations with Putin’s Russia. Moreover, the Ukrainians might be Nazis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The current front-runner for a more robust response is a scheme to fund and arm Ukrainian fighters to mount a resistance to a Russian occupation. Indeed, there are news reports that CIA operatives already are busily training Ukrainian paramilitary units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is a spectacularly bad idea. Assisting guerrillas to maim and kill Russian soldiers might well create an irreparable breach between Russia and the West. The new cold war already is chilly enough without adding to the dangerous tensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Some of the Ukrainian factions that the United States and its allies would be supporting are more than a little unsavory. Western media outlets recently suffered serious embarrassment when they featured flattering news stories about how a Ukrainian military unit was training children and the elderly in the use of weapons, so that they could resist Russian invaders. It turned out that the unit giving the instructions, the “National Guard,” had close ties to the openly neo-Nazi Azov battalion. There are other far-right factions in Ukraine that would eagerly join the line for U.S. weapons and funding. Western governments don’t seem all that selective about their potential partners in a Ukrainian resistance force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when the assessments of the larger analytic community studying Ukraine did not support these policy views, some analysts reinforced them, though many showed sympathy with Ukraine’s plight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology-and-consistency&quot;&gt;Methodology and Consistency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One notable aspect of the analysis of Russian and Ukrainian military capabilities and how a war between them might evolve is a great consensus regarding outcomes but the lack of a clearly accepted methodology through which this consensus was reached. Net assessments, judgments, and analyses contained little information as to how they were compiled. Indeed, despite the many types of evidence used, sometimes in different ways, the conclusions were surprisingly uniform. The methodological problem is a general one that confronts those conducting strategic analysis. Making judgments on military power is a complex process, so analysts consider many different variables. Using different methodologies with different evidence can produce very different results. However, in the case of the analysis before February 24, 2022, the various pieces of evidence, even when used differently, produced a remarkable consensus judgment about Russian and Ukrainian military power — let alone about how these nations would interact in the case of full-scale war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, analysts regularly used certain variables to make the case that Russia was strong, while presenting a weaker case for Ukraine. Analysts used five different evidence groupings — sometimes in tandem, sometimes in isolation — but rarely with a clear methodology. These groupings were the numerical, the qualitative, the doctrinal, the experiential, and the political and social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-numerical&quot;&gt;The Numerical&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts often considered the Russian military much stronger than the Ukrainian military because of its numerical advantages in terms of equipment. Indeed, this numerical advantage was so pronounced in some quarters that analysts assumed that Russia could conquer eastern Ukraine with a relatively small number of soldiers (around 200,000). As reported in one major outlet, “Military analysts say the Ukrainian force has critical gaps and probably would be overwhelmed if Russia decided to mount a full-scale assault. On nearly every battlefield metric — fighter jets, tanks, missiles, troop numbers — Ukraine would find itself outmatched.” This assumption of the numerical difference between the forces was widely held. Indeed, analysts often claimed that Russia had more than enough force to conquer Ukraine, without employing any discernible methodology about what kinds of numerical advantage would be needed to both defeat the Ukrainian army and conquer an area as vast as eastern Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the full-scale invasion, analysts had a widespread shared understanding as to the numerical size and composition of the Russian force massed on the Ukrainian border. They described it as overwhelmingly powerful: “The modernized and massive Russian military force that currently surrounds Ukraine on three sides can muster air and missile strikes that would likely overwhelm Ukrainian airpower and air defenses and severely damage military and other facilities.” One of the most detailed calculations assessed that Russia had between 150,000 and 175,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders in late January 2022 and a strike force of 90–100 BTGs, with at most 100,000 troops. The analysis assumed that at least eastern Ukraine would be quickly overrun. And yet, by most military standards, such a force would have been as small, or not much larger, than the Ukrainian army it was supposed to easily overrun. In the weeks before the full-scale invasion, for instance, the Ukrainian army (independent of the air force and navy) numbered around 150,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-qualitative&quot;&gt;The Qualitative&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers alone were not the only reason for the assessment of Russia’s supposed advantages over Ukraine. Analysts generally considered Russian forces better trained and capable of deploying their systems effectively, and their systems were qualitatively much better. This qualitative advantage, which was generally stated rather than proven, seemed to be based on Russian claims. Thus, analysts assumed that the quality of Russian military personnel was considerably higher than in previous years — and certainly higher than that of the Ukrainian forces. The Russian army, they said, “no longer relies on large numbers of poorly trained conscripts and ill-equipped ground forces as it did in Chechnya. Its modernization program was designed to avoid the kind of disorganized, stove-piped, ground-force dominant operation seen in Georgia in 2008.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian forces, on the other hand, even though they had also been modernizing, were usually considered a class below the Russian forces. One of the few statements directly comparing the two accepted Russian quality at face value:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although Ukraine’s armed forces have improved since the fighting of 2014–2015, so have Russia’s. The units surrounding Ukraine are largely staffed by contract soldiers — professional servicemen, rather than conscripts — with high levels of readiness, modernised equipment and officers bloodied in several conflicts, such as the war in Syria. Ukraine’s military is understaffed, poorly supplied, and inexperienced in manoeuvre warfare. Russian forces therefore have considerable quantitative and qualitative superiority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts also applied Russia’s qualitative advantage to its weapons systems, which they assumed were capable of operating at a very high rate of efficiency. For instance, Russian long-range strikes were believed to be both exceedingly accurate and well-targeted for maximum impact. The Ukrainian military, on the other hand, was at such a disadvantage in armaments that it could not prepare or react to a devastating Russian distance strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-doctrinal&quot;&gt;The Doctrinal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One specific area where Russia supposedly had a significant qualitative advantage was in military doctrine. Indeed, analysts had elevated Russian doctrine in the years before 2022 to among the most creative and perceptive in the world. In the run-up to the full-scale invasion, analysts claimed, for instance, that Russia had been a world “trendsetter” in military doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lauding of the high quality of Russian doctrine, which was treated in many ways as a continuation of Soviet doctrine, has gone on for decades. Soviet doctrine traces to the concept of deep battle in the 1930s. Seen as creative and successful, the doctrine has seemed to transfer directly to Russian military thinking over the last decade. Indeed, analysts have considered Russian doctrine so important that they have accorded different parts specific labels, such as the New Look Russian military, the partly mythical Gerasimov doctrine, and the Russian active defense posture. Even the Russian army’s reorganization into BTGs is considered an intelligent adaptation that greatly increased the striking power of Russian units. Overall, Russian doctrine appeared so strong that the Chinese military — though larger and more powerful — attempted to base much of its doctrine on Russian thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine, by contrast, did not have a doctrine so much as it was trying to get as close to NATO as possible by taking on NATO thinking. In the end, when the full-scale invasion occurred, Russian doctrine did not appear to be particularly creative or useful for the purpose of subjugating Ukraine. Arguably, the Ukrainian military handled the full-scale invasion with greater initiative and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-experiential&quot;&gt;The Experiential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pre–February 24, 2022, experiences of both militaries, in terms of combat and military exercises, mattered a great deal, particularly for Russia. These experiences purportedly provided evidence of Russian combat efficiency and logistical capabilities and revealed significant limitations for the Ukrainian forces. The Syria case study, mentioned earlier, gave an obviously distorted vision of Russian air power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much the same could be said about how analysts used Syria to describe general improvements in Russian combat capabilities. In one major news report, analysts claimed that Russian forces poised to invade Ukraine were “steeled with recent combat experience in Syria.” Interestingly, Russia used few land forces in Syria, and Syrians undertook the vast majority of the fighting. Moreover, the activity of Russian land forces in Syria could be considered advanced combined-arms warfare. Still, analysts used the Syria case study to make the case that Russian ground forces had shown significant improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same could be said about the experiences of Russian maneuvers. Even though the well-known Zapad maneuvers were arguably more choreographed displays than realistic deployments, analysts often held them up as demonstrating real capabilities through experience. Indeed, some claimed that these were not “theater” but made little effort to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the lauding of Russian experiential improvement and maneuvers in Syria stands out because analysts treated the Ukrainian experience in the Donbas very differently. Even though Ukrainians fighting in the Donbas showed noticeable combat improvement in conditions much closer to those in 2022, analysts generally dismissed this experience as of little benefit in helping them correct the massive power differential that supposedly existed between Ukraine and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-political-and-social&quot;&gt;The Political and Social&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts widely mentioned political and social variables, though once again not in a methodologically consistent manner but more to provide illustration for arguments they had already made. In the run-up to the full-scale invasion, analysts regularly discussed Ukrainian corruption as a weakness Russia could take advantage of, but made little or no mention of corruption in the Russian military, which was just as great or worse. Ukraine was even presented as so corrupt that the European Union would not consider admitting it as a member for at least a generation. However, they rarely mentioned Russian corruption, and when they did, it was as a problem that had been largely rectified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doubt about the distinctiveness of Ukrainian identity was also widespread and had persisted for a significant period. Indeed, a long-standing position among some analysts was that the borders of the Soviet republics that emerged as independent states in 1991 were dubious and represented little to the people who lived there. Analysts minimized the linguistic, historical, and political differences between the now sovereign and independent states that used to make up the Soviet Union. By contrast, there seemed to be little in the way of doubts expressed about Russian identity or national self-understanding. Instead, analysts described Ukraine as an object of Russian desire. One report shows the clear subject-object relationship often portrayed between Russia and Ukraine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No part of the Russian and Soviet empires has played a bigger and more important role in Russian strategy toward Europe than the crown jewel, Ukraine. The country is essential to Russian security for many reasons: its size and population; its position between Russia and other major European powers; its role as the centerpiece of the imperial Russian and Soviet economies; and its deep cultural, religious, and linguistic ties to Russia, particularly Kyiv’s history as the cradle of Russian statehood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts will never have one shared methodology by which to judge military power and war, nor should they. Analysts who make sweeping and confident judgments about what will happen would be wiser to be up front about the criteria they are using to make such judgments. If this report reveals anything, it is how different methodologies and variables ended up supporting a predetermined vision of power and war. Greater explicitness about the methodologies used might well have opened up a debate about the judgments being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-the-analytic-failure&quot;&gt;Why the Analytic Failure?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analytic error of some kind is inevitable. But in the case of the Russia-Ukraine military analysis, the errors (a) were well beyond the normal failures expected in any intellectual project, (b) had potentially consequential policy implications, and (c) were not, in most cases, mitigated by any noticeable analytic humility or caution on the part of those committing them. It is also striking that the analysts who were most egregiously wrong in their assessments remained prominent and influential despite these errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As erring forecasters often do, the analysts resorted to classic explanations that seemingly obviate the need for searching self-criticism. The guide to such self-exculpation is Philip Tetlock’s Expert Political Judgment, a powerful study of expert error. The book is particularly interesting in this case because it illuminates some of the retrospective justifications for error. Many of these have indeed been brought to bear in the Russia-Ukraine military analysis problem and take the form of what Tetlock refers to as “belief system defenses,” which, as he puts it, “renege on reputational bets.” Of those he lists, the ones most germane to the failures described here are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-exogenous-shock-defense&quot;&gt;The Exogenous Shock Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exogenous shock defense is the proposition that while the core prediction was correct and solidly based, an unforeseeable event undermined it by deranging the prognosticators’ calculations. In the current case, that exogenous shock would be the exquisite degree of warning that the United States provided the world and Ukrainian leadership about the impending attack. This defense may also include the supposition that U.S. and other friendly intelligence agencies provided Ukraine with the details of the Russian plan, allowing them to make essential tactical adjustments (e.g., dispersing aircraft). As a result, Western intelligence stymied the invasion by mitigating Russia’s overwhelming advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defense falls apart, however, given the open menace that President Putin had presented Ukraine in the preceding year, which the Ukrainian military seems to have taken seriously. The Ukrainian government, by contrast, refrained from publicly predicting and preparing for the massive assault for a variety of reasons, including a hope to avert it. Moreover, the Russian army did achieve local successes, particularly in the south, against Ukrainian forces that seem to have been surprised by the attack. None of this would explain the Ukrainian military’s tactical effectiveness, innovation, and successful counterattacks around Kyiv and Kharkiv. In any case, even though Western agencies were providing detailed information about the Russian buildup well before February 22, the expert community did not modify its predictions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-close-call-counterfactual-defense-i-was-almost-right&quot;&gt;The Close-Call Counterfactual Defense (“I Was Almost Right”)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This argument has had a good deal of play because of the close-run defense of Hostomel Airport outside Kyiv. On February 24, Russian airborne troops launched an attack on the airport, less than 10 kilometers from Kyiv. They were held back for a day, in part by Ukrainian national guardsmen, the latter of whom were subsequently reinforced by regular units. Although Russian mechanized units and airborne forces took Hostomel a day later, the airport had been damaged, and the delays, analysts argued, prevented Russian columns from suddenly dashing into Kyiv proper, which might have toppled the Zelensky administration overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But was it fortuitous that Ukrainian mechanized units were available to defend the airport? And for that matter, even if the Russian forces had taken Hostomel on the first day, is it right to assume that a Russian column charging into a dense, hostile urban area like Kyiv, filled with armed civilians and light infantry, would have done better than their counterparts in, say, the city of Mariupol in the south? Other similar “for want of a horseshoe nail” arguments include the possibility of President Zelensky being killed on the first night of the war — but it was not for want of trying by Russian secret services, nor was it a coincidence that the president, well protected by his own efficient bodyguards and secret services, was not killed. Moreover, such arguments can play in the opposite direction: Suppose Putin had a fatal heart attack on February 21. Suppose even more Ukrainian forces had deployed to Hostomel, north of Kyiv, and so on. The analysts were not nearly right; they were simply wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-politics-is-hopelessly-cloudlike-and-the-low-probability-outcome-just-happened-to-happen-defenses&quot;&gt;The “Politics Is Hopelessly Cloudlike” and “The Low-Probability Outcome Just Happened to Happen” Defenses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Politics Is Hopelessly Cloudlike” and “The Low-Probability Outcome Just Happened to Happen” defenses are two versions of an argument common to defenses of poor predictions of military outcomes. War is an intrinsically uncertain affair, as every theorist notes; no prediction can claim complete accuracy, and a variety of outcomes are always possible. The problem with either version as applied to the analysis of the Russian and Ukrainian militaries before the war is that a serious belief in the unpredictability of war should have moderated analysts’ certainty. As demonstrated, it did not. Instead, analysts depicted war as a large engineering operation in which all the heavy equipment and logistical planning argued overwhelmingly for the success of the aggressor nation. There was no more uncertainty in the prediction than there would have been about the completion of a major construction project, which, after all, has a set of uncertainties associated with it — though nothing like those of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-i-made-the-right-mistake-defense&quot;&gt;The “I Made the Right Mistake” Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final justification for analytic failure is that the Russian forces should have accomplished everything that they planned but were thwarted by the unpredictable and foolish intervention of President Putin and his advisers from the Federal Security Service (FSB). In this version, the Russian general staff had the right ideas and the requisite organizations, doctrine, and technology at their disposal but were undermined by the meddling of an ignorant civilian leader and his incompetent intelligence services. The original Russian plan would have involved fewer axes of advance (three rather than five) and would have had more regard for Ukrainian capabilities, some have suggested. In this view, the president, encouraged by FSB advisers who convinced him that Ukraine was ripe for the plucking and that resistance would be minimal, interfered with a competent general staff that would otherwise have conducted the operation with the results the Western analysts expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty here is that early Russian failures were multidimensional, and many had little to do with Putin or the FSB. The logistical challenges and the organization and tactics that left Russian armored columns exposed to light infantry ambushes would all have remained the same. There is no evidence of general staff pushback against the simultaneous attack on multiple vectors or apprehension about it; indeed, the idea of such an attack presenting too many challenges for the Ukrainian military to cope with had a certain plausibility to it. It would be closer to the mark to say that the general staff made its own set of mistakes. The “civilian meddling and incompetence” explanation for the outcome, and hence for the analytic failure, is in some ways the most interesting. It represents a seemingly subconscious desire to make the Russian military out to be more formidable than it actually was — perhaps not implausible for those who had devoted their careers to studying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-remedies&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Remedies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analytic failure at the outset of the war rippled beyond the conflict. The initial estimates seem to have influenced the tentativeness with which the West armed Ukraine, holding back on advanced weapons systems in part based on the argument that the primitive Ukrainian military could not operate them successfully. Pessimism about Ukrainian chances, hesitation about reinforcing Ukrainian successes, and difficulty in seeing Russia’s true weaknesses were all hangovers from the initial failure, even though many analysts eventually adjusted to the reality of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broader implications of the failure are even more important. It is striking how small the analytic community was that made the judgments that shaped public perceptions and, in some measure, government policy. These individuals, for the most part, had similar backgrounds — degrees in political science and experience almost exclusively in think tanks, along with occasional stints in the intelligence community. They were not historians and certainly not military historians. Few had field experience as soldiers. They were overwhelmingly “Russia military analysts” by trade and not experts on Ukraine, often accepting, at a tacit level, deep-seated Russian views about the unreality of Ukrainian nationhood. Their internal system was mutually supportive. They constantly approved citations of one another’s work and treated both the underlying uncertainty and commentary of those outside the community with a degree of disdain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a recipe for what the pioneering social psychologist Irving L. Janis referred to as groupthink. Indeed, the analytic community exhibited many of the characteristics Janis noted: underestimation of the group’s susceptibility to error, stereotyped views, self-censorship of dissent and commitment to unanimity, and even “self-appointed mindguards” who enforced orthodoxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did this happen? Analysis of the Russian military was a major intellectual field during the Cold War, but it shrank after the war’s end and the emergence of new threats in the form of radical Islam and China. The result was a small community dependent on mutual support, operating in the research institution environment. The latter point is important. Academic disciplines, despite all their faults, promote (at least in theory) sharp debates and disagreement, and professors are usually rewarded for challenging and displacing conventional wisdom rather than elaborating it. Academics can also switch fields of specialization, which can bring in new perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is much less the case in research institutions, particularly in small areas where patronage by leading figures is necessary for career advancement. In the case of government-funded research — much of it coming from the U.S. Department of Defense, with its vested interests — in the decades before the war there was considerable disincentive to underplay Russian capabilities. Moreover, the initial failures of Russian operations in the opening phases of the war did not change matters much. If anything, the pathologies were reinforced during crisis and ensuing wars as the small group of acknowledged experts became media stars, repeatedly interviewed and quoted in major outlets, on social media, and even by government officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysts discussed here did not exhibit moral turpitude, much less stupidity or willful blindness. They were the product of their incentive systems and the intellectual structures that produced them. But the failure is a warning because it can and will happen again in other cases possibly more consequentially. Luckily, however, potential remedies are available to governments, journalists, and research organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRING IN THE GENERALISTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A self-conscious effort by journalists and government consumers of military analysis to critique expert conclusions is a good idea. In the present case, military officers, historians, and Ukraine experts might all have offered useful counters to the analytic orthodoxy. Indeed, research institutions could make contributions in this area by convening reviews of expert consensus in military analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRING IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF SPECIALISTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the commentators who were most optimistic about Ukraine’s chances came from the ranks of soldiers, particularly those who had served in advisory and training roles in Ukraine since 2014. Diverse intellectual and professional backgrounds might well have changed the weight of expectation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAINTAIN ACCOUNTABILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outsiders need to keep book — not with the purpose of banishing or blacklisting analysts but confronting them with their errors and putting them in a position to reflect on why the errors were made. Unfortunately, there are few professional incentives to do this work, reflecting a larger problem in the social sciences, such as the “replication crisis” in psychology and many other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BROADEN THE EDUCATION OF ANALYSTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social sciences and humanities bring different qualities to analysis. Political science and sociology have their strong points, but so does history, which would have been particularly useful in this case. The sensibility of historians — their alertness to contingency, nuance, culture, personality, and much else — differs from that of political scientists. Students of the history of war, in particular, have a much better visceral feel for the imponderables than social scientists usually do. This is, of course, even more true of well-educated soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENCOURAGE A CULTURE OF DEBATE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consensus on analytic forecasts is perilous, as students of intelligence failure have long noted. The problem with the usual solution — an in-house contrarian of some kind — is that it runs the risk of being formulaic. Analysts need venues and incentives to disagree with one another without fearing professional consequences, either for their reputation as oracles or due to retaliation from leaders in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors again stress that they do not find deliberate dishonesty or manipulation, much less simplemindedness or stupidity, in the poor analysis of the Russian and Ukrainian militaries before the war. Rather, the structure of the analytic community — its incentive structures and educational formation — makes the failure understandable, if no less disturbing. The authors’ concern is that in an era of severe military conflict, this is highly unlikely to be a one-off case, with quite possibly more cases to come. In such cases, consensus and certainty are not only intellectually problematic, but they are also downright dangerous. Consumers of such analysis, as well as those who produce it, must act to prevent another such failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military analysis, in one form or another, has existed for millennia. However, only in the last two centuries has it become institutionalized, and only since 1945 has it become industrialized. Before 1945, military analysis was often the remit of random scholars or civil servants, a very small number of research organizations, such as Janes, or soldiers in defense departments or armies. Military analysts had no agreed-upon methodology and little in the way of a shared community, and only occasional authors, such as Antoine-Henry Jomini, Carl von Clausewitz, and Alfred Thayer Mahan, emerged to become widely discussed strategic thinkers. Since 1945, the growth of think tanks and the proliferation of military bureaucracies, with their analytic, intelligence, and educational arms, have vastly expanded the number of military analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, as the field of military analysis has flourished and become institutionalized, it has not improved on the surface and, in some respects, may have deteriorated. For the sake of comparison, it might be helpful to briefly discuss some examples of analysis from the twentieth century to better understand how deep the errors were before February 24, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following case studies all have something in common with the Russia-Ukraine War: the Russian navy at the time of the Russo-Japanese War, Benito Mussolini’s military before Italy joined World War II, and the Iraqi military before the United States launched Operation Desert Storm in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the great differences between the analysis of military power before 1945 and the analysis thereafter is that in the earlier period there was little formal organization. To be sure, there were standard yearbooks such as Jane’s and Brassey’s annual surveys of the navies of the world, but these were often static compilations of statistics. When it came to the Russian navy and Italian armed forces, for instance, there were no think tanks producing regular reports on their supposed strengths and weaknesses, although publications like Jane’s and Brassey’s did tabulate order of battle data. Instead, public discourse was mostly dominated by reporters, sometimes specifically military reporters, writing in major newspapers. Within governments, military and naval attachés posted in different countries generated much of the analysis. However, almost all of their reports were confidential, and it is hard to say that any organized methodology drove their different opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because of the lack of a defined community, early analysis tended to shy away from taking overly strong or definitive opinions, as evident in the analysis of the Russian navy at the time of the Russo-Japanese War (1904–5). Although many people in Europe and North America likely thought that the Russians were superior to the Japanese due to their European status, public reports on the Russian navy seem to have made no such assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, much of the reporting, as shown by the 1903 New York Times editorial on the war cited above, tended to see the war as evenly matched, with the Russians having no significant material advantage because they were Europeans. The UK Times, which was establishing itself as the paper of record, analyzed the war very similarly. In December 1903, as war clouds were gathering, a Times military correspondent claimed that the Russian and Japanese fleets were evenly matched and, as such, the outcome of any naval war between them would be decided by seamanship and tactics, not materiel. If anything, this was a relatively positive view of the Russian navy, as subsequent analysis of its capabilities tended to focus on weakness. In March 1904, the Times military correspondent pointed out a wide gulf between Russian naval power and that of a major maritime power such as the British or French. By 1905, before the Battle of Tsushima, the analysis revealed a Russian navy with major flaws. Describing its performance during the Japanese attack on Port Arthur, the Times military analyst spoke of “the abasement of the art of naval war by Russian seaman and the Russian Government.” Thus, before the Russian navy’s almost total destruction at the hands of the Japanese in June 1905, the analysis of its capabilities in the leading journals of the United States and United Kingdom was not hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reporting about the Italian military right before it entered the pre–World War II fighting was not quite as negative but stressed weaknesses as well as strengths. Certain military correspondents, such as Herbert Matthews in the New York Times, stressed the comparatively large size of the Italian army, the Italian navy’s growing fleet, and the Italian air force’s latest aircraft, arguing that Italy would be a major player in any coming war. When judging the impact of Italy entering the war on Germany’s behalf on June 1, 1940, Matthews wrote that Italy had a “powerful weight to throw into the balance” when the time came. The Times could also rate Italy a major player by relying mostly on metrics, such as the supposed size of the Italian army, which the Times estimated was 1.25 million in the spring of 1939.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the analysis the major papers provided also stressed major weaknesses in the Italian military. Italy’s relative economic backwardness was widely understood as a handicap to Mussolini’s attempts to make Italy a great power. Matthews, for instance, wrote a detailed piece in May 1939 about what a war would be like between Italy and Germany against Britain and France. He argued that the relative economic weakness of the Axis powers would play a huge role in determining the outcome of any such conflict. Even if Italy and Germany had great success at the start, the longer the war went on, the more the balance of production would turn against them. Within this analysis was an understanding that Italy might well lack the resources to sustain full-scale operations. One report, for instance, claimed that because of economic weakness, Italy would have difficulty sustaining naval operations after a few months of intense fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This understanding of basic Italian weaknesses was, if anything, even more prevalent in the attaché community in Italy. The German military attachés, for instance, were known to be very skeptical about Italy’s military capabilities — much more so than German dictator Adolf Hitler. These kinds of doubts played a significant role in undermining the notion of Italian military prowess that Mussolini tried hard to propagate. One of the best examples is the farcical Italian military maneuvers of the summer of 1939, described in the excerpt from Matthews. The Italian government was hoping to impress the world’s press with these maneuvers, which would have them drive off an expected invader (probably France) and then counterattack. However, after a few days, the organization of the maneuvers broke down, and Mussolini decided he could not even risk appearing in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first half of the twentieth century, military analysis could be quite cautious based on a range of factors, not just military metrics but also societal and political efficiency and economic strength. Also, as there was no one analytic community, the analysis lacked consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the twentieth century, however, the caution seemed to have lessened in at least one case: the vision of what the Iraqi armed forces could do to fighting U.S. armed forces during Operation Desert Storm (1991). Before the war there was a great deal of speculation about how the Iraqi military could fight against U.S. military forces sent to Saudi Arabia after Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait. One of the most hotly discussed topics was the number of casualties the Iraqi army could inflict on the United States. Many considered the Iraqi military to be battle hardened after its long war against Iran and in possession of very effective military equipment. Analysts widely held that the Iraqi Republican Guard was “elite” and would pose significant problems for U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the estimates of the casualties the Iraqis would inflict on U.S. forces were far greater than the reality. In some cases, professional military analysts estimated that the United States would suffer well over 10,000 dead and more than 30,000 casualties. In the end, U.S. forces suffered 96 deaths in action against the Iraqis. That said, although analysts did not widely believe that the Iraqis would defeat the United States, they overestimated the damage the Iraqis would inflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to argue that military analysis improved in the twentieth century, and there is evidence that as the structures of military analysis grew, the quality of that analysis did not. One reason is that earlier analysis, not being systematized, may have relied on more holistic criteria for understanding military power. Instead of simply counting units and running calculations, early analysts, such as those who addressed the Russian and Italian militaries, often stressed their economic and societal weaknesses, not just the purported strength of their military units. That seems to have happenedless in 1990–91, which could have contributed to a significant overestimation of the Iraqi military. Yet, in comparison to the analysis of the Russian and Ukrainian militaries before February 24, 2022, much of the earlier work was more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of the ebb and flow in the Middle East was on display in real time as Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian visited the Kurdistan Region of Iraq on 12–13 September at a time of widening Turkish operations against Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) targets there, and only days after Turkey’s foreign minister attended the ministerial meeting of the League of Arab States in Cairo. As the war in Gaza rages on, it is important not to overlook what is unfolding in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq – a pivotal arena where Iran and Turkey, long aligned against Kurdish separatist movements, have both indirectly clashed through local factions as they seek to navigate their overlapping spheres of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) has escalated its cross-border strikes against PKK strongholds in recent months, with reports that it has advanced as far as 15 kilometres into the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The PKK has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK since March 2001 and is also listed as a terrorist organisation in over a dozen other countries, as well as by the EU. While this puts the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) under pressure, it also pits Ankara against Iranian interests, as well as raising concerns among Arab League countries about Turkey’s expansionist regional ambitions. Like Syria next door, Iraqi Kurdistan remains a key battleground for Turkey and Iran, and Tehran in recent years has steadily moved to amplify its influence vis-à-vis the Iraqi Kurds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey’s decision to step up the intensity of its cross-border activities rests on several considerations. These include the Turkish security establishment’s assessment of a heightened risk of PKK militancy, combined with a weaker and divided political administration in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and re-centralising state dynamics in Iraq that are favourable to Turkish military objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;turkeys-claw-operation-in-iraq&quot;&gt;Turkey’s Claw Operation in Iraq&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 22–23 December 2023, twin PKK attacks left 12 Turkish soldiers dead in the Harkuk and Dohuk regions in northern Iraq. Then, on 12 January 2024, the PKK killed nine Turkish soldiers and wounded another four in strikes against a Turkish military base. While cross-border operations in the region have been a grim reality since 2018, with periodic casualties among Turkish forces, the proximity of these latest attacks raised fresh alarm bells. Since 2022, Turkey has conducted a military operation known as Operation Claw-Lock to secure the northern Dohuk area in Iraq along its border. And while President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on 10 July, “We will close the lock very soon in the Claw Operation Zone”, this is unlikely to mean the end of Turkish military presence in the operational area, including a network of bases, checkpoints and secured military roads to minimise reliance on aircraft for logistical transport and movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2022, Turkey has expanded its operations against the PKK in northern Iraq, reaching into areas as far as the countryside of Sulaymaniyah and even regions along the road to Kirkuk. Turkish forces have established numerous bases in the areas where operations have been conducted, with consequences for local civilians and agricultural land. In northeastern Syria, the TAF has targeted key infrastructure, and it makes no distinction between Iraq and Syria in its fight against PKK-linked terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current Turkish operation in Iraq, which has been conducted below the threshold of a ground invasion, aims to degrade the PKK and deprive it of forward bases, and to prevent insurgents from reoccupying areas that have been cleared. This entails pushing PKK fighters southwards and away from the border, using a series of operations that leverage Turkey’s advanced military capabilities, such as surveillance and air superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent phase of Turkish operations has been localised, aiming to secure the Matin mountains within the Amedi district north of Dohuk in northern Iraq. The area is significant because it is crucial for any future operations in the larger Gara mountain range, where the PKK has established a network of sophisticated bases. Gara’s strategic importance stems from its central location, linking Qandil with Syria, Turkey and Sinjar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Turkish pressure and shifting realities on the ground have rendered Baghdad and Erbil more pliable on the question of the PKK in recent years&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PKK established a foothold in Sinjar in 2014 when so-called Islamic State attacked the local Yazidi peoples in a genocidal campaign, leading to mass civilian casualties and atrocities. The region has been penetrated by a medley of groups, including Iran-backed Shiite militias and Yazidi armed groups linked to the PKK. Sinjar is a crucial supply line that allows transit for the PKK across Iraq and Syria; losing its access will lessen the influence it holds in northeastern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pkks-posture-in-iraq&quot;&gt;The PKK’s Posture in Iraq&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three regions stand out for their strategic significance for the PKK: Mahmur, Sinjar and the so-called Medya Defence Zones. Having evolved over four decades, these enclaves represent strategic assets for the organisation, following its shift from bases in Syria and Lebanon to northern Iraq. Over time, the PKK expanded into civilian areas by expanding into cities, towns and villages through social, political and economic structures, giving it access to material assets and overland smuggling routes in the borderlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish pressure and shifting realities on the ground have rendered Baghdad and Erbil more pliable on the question of the PKK in recent years. The central government’s formal ban of the group – which falls short of the terrorist designation Ankara wanted – is more than a symbolic gesture. Iraqi officials have warned against the possibility of PKK-linked attacks on oil refineries and other critical national infrastructure, an indication that Ankara has made strides in persuading Baghdad that the organisation poses a risk to Iraqi national interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the PKK’s slow and steady encroachment into civilian areas, infringing upon the territorial authority of the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), has triggered a legitimacy crisis at a time when the latter is already under pressure from Baghdad and local opponents. The PKK maintains a presence in the area of Sinjar, despite the agreement in October 2020 between the central government and the KRG that calls for the withdrawal of foreign fighters from the area. As the PKK’s freedom of movement has grown in the area of Sulaymaniyah, which is controlled by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), tensions have intensified between Turkey and Iran. For Erbil, the effect of PUK cooperation with Iran is to hand greater leverage to Baghdad over the Iraqi Kurds and the ability to degrade the region’s autonomy through economic, judicial and security interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a series of setbacks to the power-sharing arrangement that has held since 2005, the KRG has seen its autonomy come under mounting pressure from Iranian- and Shia-influenced politics in Baghdad. In February 2022, the Federal Supreme Court decreed that the KRG’s 2007 natural resource law was unconstitutional and its oil exports and contracts illegal. This was followed in January 2023 by a ruling against new federal budget transfers to the Kurdistan region. In March 2023, the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce ruled in favour of Iraq in a decade-long arbitration case that led to the Iraq–Turkey pipeline closure, which remains unresolved. In a further blow, in a February 2024 decision, the Federal Supreme Court of Iraq ruled that the KRG must hand over control of its finances to the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Gaza has amplified the role of various Iran-aligned Shia militias in Iraq, a patchwork of ideologically like-minded groups that have been called to action against US military targets since the 7 October attacks on Israel. Iran views Turkey’s sizeable military footprint as a threat to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ and Shia militias’ areas of operation inside northern Iraq and the border areas. To prevent Turkey from regaining a foothold in areas like Mosul and Kirkuk, and to degrade its existing influence over Erbil and Duhok, Iran has both targeted the KDP in ways that are a throwback to the dynamics which defined the region in the 1990s, as well as engaged with it in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, as US influence receded from northern Iraq, a delicate balance of power took shape among the region’s key players. Turkey threw its weight behind the KDP, while Iran lent support to the PUK. Meanwhile, the PKK entrenched itself in the rugged, mountainous terrain along the Turkish-Iraqi border – territory neither the KDP nor the PUK could decisively control. During this period, the PKK forged strategic ties with the PUK, a relationship that shaped the insurgent dynamics of the region for years to come. The PKK has historically moved to exploit local fractures for its own survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;re-centralisation-dynamics-in-iraq&quot;&gt;Re-centralisation Dynamics in Iraq&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the unsuccessful independence referendum held in 2017, the KRG has seen its authority weakened by the federal government in Baghdad through political manoeuvres and tools of lawfare, a series of judicial decisions that Iraqi Kurds believe have incrementally eroded the region’s constitutionally mandated autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ankara benefits from closer security cooperation with the KDP, it has simultaneously benefited from the centralising dynamics that have transferred greater control to the central government at the expense of the KRG’s constitutionally mandated autonomy. Iraq continues to be a key foreign policy and security priority for Turkey, as evidenced by a series of high-level meetings in quick succession early this year. On 14 March, the Turkish defence and foreign ministers and the head of the National Intelligence Organisation visited Baghdad. A Turkish diplomatic win came in March ahead of Erdogan’s visit to Iraq on 22 April 2024 – the first in 12 years – when the government of Iraq designated the PKK a “banned” group on Iraqi soil, effectively rendering the activities of the group illegal inside Iraq and clearing the path for Iraqi state forces (in principle, at least) to pursue, prosecute and punish militants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 21 July, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ Al Sudani inaugurated a 115-km power transmission line that had been stalled for 20 years, running through the Kisik station west of Mosul to supply the provinces of Nineveh, Salahuddin and Kirkuk with a capacity of 300 megawatts. This dwarfs in comparison to the proposed $20 billion Iraq Development Road project, a landmark network of railways and highways that will alter existing supply chains and link Asia to European markets via Basra and overland via Turkey. The proposed transit route will traverse through Mosul, the outskirts of Kirkuk, areas of Islamic State cell activity as well as PKK presence, and clearing this insurgent-held territory is essential to minimising the chances of disruption or sabotage. The project will not effectively counter growing Iranian hegemony in Iraq. On the contrary, the route will run through territory that is under Iran’s influence, and if Tehran wants to block it, it probably can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PKK is unsettled by the deepening rapprochement between its adversary and the Iraqi government, and for good reason. Northern Iraq has long served as a strategic haven for the group, providing a safe zone for its leadership, military assets, and logistical networks. Any disruption to this sanctuary would have cascading effects across the PKK’s operations, both in Iraq and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irans-role&quot;&gt;Iran’s Role&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq has become even more critical for Iran against the backdrop of the Gaza war. Iraq is a critical node in the highly networked supply chains of logistical and financial support that feed not only the militia there, but also Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis and militias in Syria. Iraqi Kurdistan is important for Iran as it seeks to limit the activities of armed Iranian Kurdish groups such as the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Komeleh and the Free Life Party, consolidate its influence over the country, and apply pressure on Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KDP accuses the PUK of engaging in opaque relations with Baghdad, Tehran and Shiite groups, as worries mount that the increasing influence of the PUK may result in a growing Iranian dominance over the KRG. The KDP initially attempted to counterbalance the alliance between the PUK and Iran-linked Shiite groups by converging with Sunni Arab factions and Muqtada al-Sadr, but this failed as Iran successfully downgraded al-Sadr’s influence and divided the Sunni Arab coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Instability in the Kurdistan Region, and increased Iranian infiltration, does not bode well for wider Western interests in the Middle East&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 15 January 2024, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards claimed to have targeted an Israeli “espionage headquarters” near the US consulate in Erbil, with Iran-backed Iraqi militias having made similar claims following strikes conducted in December 2023. Iranian sources claimed the attacks were in retaliation for Israel’s role in targeting commanders of the “Axis of Resistance”. Four were killed, including a prominent Iraqi Kurdish businessman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As he has consolidated his leadership over the PUK, Bafel Talabani has grown closer to Iran. But he is not alone. In early May, President of the Kurdistan Region Nechirvan Barzani paid an official visit to Tehran, in an attempt to recover from the January strikes and to balance interests between Turkey and Iran. Shortly after his return, the Iraqi Supreme Federal Court issued a ruling that favoured Masrour Barzani’s formal objection to the election law that altered the distribution of seats and the minority quota in the Kurdish parliament. The KDP will be cautious about confronting Iran-linked militia because the stakes are so high. Antagonising Iran may lead to unforeseen circumstances that will work against its claim to ensure stability as the governing party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, three Iranian Kurdish armed groups under the “Komeleh” umbrella were relocated to a “less accessible” camp in Iraqi Kurdistan, restricting their activities, logistical access to weapons and supplies. This stems from a security agreement between Baghdad and Tehran signed in March 2023 that saw Iraqi Kurds push several armed factions away from the Iranian border in order to comply with Tehran’s demands. In July, Nechirvan Barzani attended the inauguration ceremony of President Pezeshkian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These overtures seem to have paid off. On 12 September, Pezeshkian visited Erbil (after touching down in Baghdad) on his first overseas visit since taking office, showcasing the level of priority given to a neighbour that Tehran wields significant influence over and extracts considerable value from. Pezeshkian also visited Sulaymaniyah, effectively acknowledging that the Kurdistan Region has two centres of authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the region’s parliamentary elections, which look to be finally going ahead on 20 October, will impact these dynamics. If the KRG is fragmented further, or the results are disputed by either of the major parties leading to instability, this will impact the federal balance of power in Iraq, as well as complicate US and allied interests in the region. Ankara may opt to take steps to prevent the KDP from falling under Iranian control, a scenario that would curtail the manoeuvrability of Turkey’s counterterrorism operations. One possibility would be supporting the KDP to strengthen the local economy in order to stem popular discontent, which may include building momentum towards finally reopening the oil pipeline to Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As US forces prepare to withdraw from Iraq, the scramble to fill the inevitable void has long been underway. The increased activity of local and regional actors needs to be read within the context of a future US withdrawal, or rather, drawdown. Instability in the Kurdistan Region, and increased Iranian infiltration, does not bode well for wider Western interests in the Middle East, especially given the current fragility in the region. Curtailing Iranian influence is a persistent concern, which is ever more pressing – and simultaneously difficult – given Tehran’s deeply embedded networks and vested interests across the rest of Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the 2019 Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly could not resist taking the mickey out of her UK counterpart. She boasted that she had gone to the high-level defence ministerial forum with her entourage, plus a carrier strike group (CSG) comprising the Charles de Gaulle carrier, escorted by destroyers, tankers, Rafale fighters and helicopters. The UK, she said with a mischievous grin, “would be kind enough not to reciprocate”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parly’s dig at the UK might have been light-hearted, but the issue of European deployments and engagement in the broader Indo-Pacific is serious business, given the growing geopolitical weight of the region. Consider the numbers: the region includes five of the world’s biggest-spending military powers (China, India, Japan, Russia and the US); four formidable democratic powers (the members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue); three powers in an extensive trilateral arrangement (Australia, the UK and the US); two of the biggest global powers (China and the US); and a dynamic regional institution (ASEAN).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, many key European powers - such as France, Germany and the EU - have tabled elaborate documents detailing their plans for the Indo-Pacific, and in particular, Southeast Asia. But to many Southeast Asian observers concerned about delicate regional hotspots – such as the South China Sea, the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands and the Taiwan Strait – the key question is how much military power European countries can bring to bear to bolster deterrence and regional stability. Ultimately, these Indo-Pacific strategies must be complemented by tangible exercises of hard power, particularly given the tough regional environment. As the oft-quoted retort by Stalin goes: “How many divisions does the Pope have?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To their credit, countries like Germany and France have stepped up. The former will send its latest F125-class frigate with a support ship to the region this year (in addition to deployments by the Air Force). As for the latter, French Rafales deployed on the Charles De Gaulle conducted a power projection exercise from the Indian Ocean to Singapore in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this game, however, the new UK government appears to be lagging in the stakes. It has been two months since Labour became the governing party in the UK, and all signs point to a desire to strengthen relationships across the Atlantic and the English Channel at the expense of the Indo-Pacific region. In his first international visit since taking office, Prime Minister Keir Starmer jetted off to Washington to participate in a NATO summit. He followed this up by hosting the fourth summit of the European Political Community, making good on his campaign promise to forge a stronger relationship with European allies and maintain an “unshakable” commitment to NATO. Following his lead, Chancellor Rachel Reeves also visited New York and Toronto in a bid to shore up investment in key sectors of the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, the new UK government has kept relatively mum on its approach to the Indo-Pacific. There have been some suggestions that Labour will conduct a “full audit” of London’s relations with China, as it puts its “three C’s” approach – “challenge, compete and cooperate” – towards Beijing into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, there has been an emphasis on the need for “progressive realism” – using realist methods to prosecute progressive ends – since before the general election. John Healey, the new defence secretary, has already given a big hint as to London’s overall policy direction. Under Labour, he said in an interview last year, London will remain a staunch ally of Australia and New Zealand. But the UK cannot be a “strong military force in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic simultaneously”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Any form of retrenchment from the Indo-Pacific – and in particular, ASEAN – would be detrimental to the UK’s long-term interests in the region&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are reasonable grounds for such an approach. The UK’s defence budget is stretched. The previous Conservative government sought to raise the UK’s defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% in the long term, but this was conditioned on favourable “fiscal and economic circumstances”. Labour has stated the same aspiration, but contingent on a review of defence strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Reeves has made clear that the new government has inherited a £22 billion budgetary hole from the previous Tory government, leaving Westminster with “difficult decisions” to make and portending the need for further spending cuts. Speaking to the Financial Times in July, a senior MoD official said that the UK armed forces could not defend the “British homelands properly”, let alone fight in a “conflict of any scale”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK is also focused on shoring up Ukraine in the latter’s war with Russia, and on its participation in NATO and European security, particularly with the possibility of a second Trump administration come January 2025. This is true to form for Labour, which has traditionally been an Atlanticist party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, any form of retrenchment from the Indo-Pacific – and in particular, ASEAN – would be detrimental to the UK’s long-term interests in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has long-standing interests in the region, as highlighted by its “Refresh” of its 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy in 2023. The Refresh doubled down on the UK’s so-called “tilt” towards the Indo-Pacific. In 2021, the UK secured a dialogue partnership with ASEAN. Two years later, it signed the accession protocol to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has also committed itself to AUKUS, the trilateral security partnership with Australia and the US. This will see the forward deployment of a UK Astute-class submarine in Western Australia later this decade. Likewise, the UK is part of the Global Combat Air Programme with Japan and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a report by International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the UK also remains engaged with regional partners through combined military exercises. In 2023, the UK expanded its annual combined exercise with Tokyo, Exercise Vigilant Isles, marking the “first time British troops have been embedded with their Japanese counterparts”. London also routinely deploys its troops to Australian exercises, such as Exercise Talisman Sabre and Exercise Pitch Black. Moreover, the UK has committed forces to combined exercises with Washington, most notably the deployment of the RAF’s Atlas A400M transport aircraft under the US-led Exercise Mobility Guardian in Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following its withdrawal from east of Suez in 1967, the UK retained a security footprint in the region with the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA). It has detachments in Singapore and Brunei and maintains two forward-deployed offshore patrol vessels in the region. As part of the FPDA, the UK also engages annually with Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand and Australia through Exercise Bersama Lima and Exercise Bersama Shield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the UK was ranked among the major powers as the sixth most strategically relevant to ASEAN in ISEAS’s 2024 State of Southeast Asia Survey, just above Australia (to much consternation in Canberra, which considers itself to be far more involved in Southeast Asia and the wider region than London).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the new UK government cannot argue that more pressing concerns in the Atlantic and Europe should lead to reduced commitments in the region. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida put this across well when he said that “Ukraine may be the East Asia of tomorrow”. That is, conflicts on the western end of Eurasia could come home to roost in the eastern part, and vice versa. Indeed, the aforementioned IISS report suggests that major EU member states, such as Germany, France and Italy, recognise this interconnectedness and have been stepping up their engagement in the Indo-Pacific (albeit in a piecemeal fashion), even as the bloc makes steady progress towards its commitment of spending at least 2% of its GDP on defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, given Labour’s fiscal constraints and the urgent need to reinvigorate growth in the UK economy, what can be done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a start, the UK should continue to ask for a seat at the table at the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus and the East Asia Summit, building on the momentum of its conferment as an ASEAN dialogue partner in 2021. Participating in ASEAN-led platforms is no panacea, but it would give London access to established regional networks while also signalling the UK’s support for the (much-vaunted) centrality of ASEAN at a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ultimately, the sheer importance of the Indo-Pacific to the UK’s national interests behooves it to lean more towards the region rather than turn away&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a step in the right direction, the UK also announced in early August 2024 that it would deploy a CSG to the Indo-Pacific in 2025. To be led by the HMS Prince of Wales carrier, the group would include Royal Navy escorts and aircraft, and be bolstered by two ships, including a frigate, from Norway. This CSG would train with the navies of the US and Japan – two powers that are key members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, which seeks to manage the challenge posed by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that Southeast Asian countries remain wary about assertive Chinese actions in the South China Sea, the UK could also participate in so-called “Quad-lite” exercises (working with Quad countries, without the “Quad” brand) with like-minded Southeast Asian states, demonstrating the active presence of other powers in the region. A good example would be Super Garuda Shield 2023, which involved six participating contingents (including from Indonesia, the US, Japan and the UK) and nine observer countries. The exercise last year was timely given Indonesia and China’s standoffs in disputed waters off the Natuna islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, the UK should provide assistance to countries that are seeking to build their own capacities to defend the existing rules-based order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cost-effective option would be a reciprocal access agreement (RAA) with the Philippines, which is at the forefront of the South China Sea dispute with China. This is not a bridge too far: the UK has signed a similar RAA with Japan, while Tokyo inked an RAA with Manila on 8 July this year and a similar agreement with Australia in 2022. The Japan–UK RAA would also allow the UK to generate significant bang for its buck, as the agreement would not require it to maintain a permanent deployment of troops, and would allow for greater flexibility in the conduct of joint training and exercises. In fact, the latter are key to upholding regional stability, as Japan and the UK can plan for “complex military exercises and deployments” in their own territories as well as the wider Indo-Pacific (most likely with like-minded countries such as Australia, the Philippines and the US).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a leaf from Japan’s playbook, London should also consider augmenting its existing training with coastguards in Asia by providing coastguard ships to countries such as Malaysia and the Philippines. Labour has previously expressed its desire to “restore the UK’s leadership in international development” by reversing the Tory government’s decision to reduce the Overseas Development Assistance budget, and it could explore an arrangement akin to Tokyo’s Official Security Assistance to beef up the capabilities of regional allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expectations of a UK military contribution to a Taiwan Strait contingency are low. But it is likely that the US would value the deployment of UK forces already in the region. According to another IISS report, Whitehall should at least consider some forward planning as to the likely assets that it could bring to the region in the event of a conflagration in the Taiwan Strait, be it a naval task group or a brigade-sized land force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that any major power’s regional engagement is contingent on whether it serves the national interest and is sustainable. London’s historic withdrawal from “east of Suez” in 1967 served its interests at the time, given the dire financial straits it was in and its inclination to reduce its global military footprint. Today, the obverse is true: to be a power of consequence, it needs to be present in strength in the Indo-Pacific. Ultimately, the sheer importance of the Indo-Pacific to the UK’s national interests behooves it to lean more towards the dynamic region rather than turn away.&lt;/p&gt;

Some LAC countries are benefitting from increased access to low-cost, high-quality electric vehicles (EVs) and new investment throughout the value chain from China that can help meet governments’ climate and economic objectives.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;However, this comes with risks, as dependencies on Beijing may be exacerbated at a time when China’s economy is underperforming and geopolitical competition with the United States is on the rise. Washington should find new ways to engage with the region to find solutions that address local demands and simultaneously mitigate U.S. geopolitical risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s external economic engagement is evolving rapidly and is reshaping its relationship with countries in the developing world, including in LAC. Beijing’s continued commitment to industrial policy is causing increasing tensions with countries concerned about overcapacity and a second “China shock.” However, China’s growing exports and nascent overseas production of high-tech green products such as EVs are changing the country’s offerings to regions such as LAC, which exports many critical raw materials, desires more value-added manufacturing investment, seeks to address climate change, and imports an increasing number of vehicles from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing tensions between the United States and China have raised concerns globally, but some countries in LAC see great power competition as an opportunity to position themselves as new nodes in this evolving trade and investment environment. Given LAC’s growing importance to the economic security strategy of the United States, the changing relationship of the region with China is worth analyzing more closely — especially with respect to the EV supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s high-profile Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has shaped its relations with the LAC region for much of the last decade, but this is rapidly changing as the number of new Chinese-backed large-scale infrastructure projects declines. Instead, Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) is becoming more common in the region. Although China’s investments remain concentrated in the mining segment of the supply chain, there are signs of increasing interest from Chinese firms to expand their international presence in refining, assembly, and manufacturing, particularly in the EV supply chain. If this trend holds, it would represent a significant shift in Beijing’s offerings to potential partners in the developing world. Crucially for LAC, this would allow China to answer a growing regional call for investment in higher-value segments of the local supply chain while also helping meet governments’ climate goals. LAC is increasingly a market for Chinese EVs as well, and although much smaller than Europe and Asia, it is growing quickly (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ETNz0B0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Chinese EV Exports by Region&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why Chinese firms are considering investments beyond mining in LAC, and why the EV industry appears to be at the forefront of this trend. China’s slowing economy and high levels of competition are encouraging companies to seek new markets. This is particularly evident in the automotive industry, which has received significant state support over the years. Because economies of scale and acquiring more data are crucial to the innovation process and cost competitiveness in the EV industry, companies have a strong incentive to seek new customers globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Chinese companies have been focusing more on developing markets, in part due to partial or complete closures of larger automotive markets such as Europe and the United States through tariffs. However, many emerging economies have their own industrial ambitions in this space. Take Brazil, which became a top importer of Chinese EVs before President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s second tranche of tariffs came into force in the summer of 2024 (see Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/m2DrrPf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Chinese Exports of EVs to Select Latin American Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lula’s government has also enthusiastically welcomed BYD — China’s and the world’s leading EV manufacturer — which is taking over an old Ford plant to build EVs in the country. This is one of three Chinese automotive companies with plans to make EVs in Brazil. Greater investment on the ground in LAC could allow Chinese firms to meet the region’s growing need for affordable EVs while also boosting the local economy through value-added manufacturing, especially if local workers are employed. It would also integrate the region further with China, both economically and technologically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important driver is derisking policies in the United States itself. To comply with requirements in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and to avoid tariffs, for example, Chinese companies have been exploring opportunities to expand assembly and manufacturing in third countries, including in the LAC region. Indeed, the United States and other developed countries are putting in place incentives and restrictions that aim to onshore supply chains and direct companies to invest outside of China — especially in places closer to home, such as LAC. The IRA, with its EV tax credit requirements, represents one of the most ambitious policies so far when it comes to redirecting investment in third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this paper will proceed by offering an overview of Chinese firms’ involvement in various segments of the EV supply chain in LAC and the implications for U.S. strategy. Although the value chain can be quite complex (see Figure 3), this paper will focus on key minerals (i.e., lithium and copper), the production of battery cells and packs, and vehicle assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BBKTCeo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Electric Vehicle Battery Supply Chain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mining&quot;&gt;Mining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mining industry in LAC has attracted international attention as governments seek to transition to green technologies, which require critical minerals such as lithium, found in large quantities in the region. China is ahead of its competitors in forging partnerships and catalyzing investment in LAC’s minerals space for use in the energy transition. China maintains outsized control over the mining of several critical minerals used in EV battery manufacturing, such as lithium and copper (see Figure 4). It does so by investing in complete acquisitions of local mines, purchasing significant shares in Western mining companies, and partnering with local governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ebYHyN4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Chinese Investment in Lithium Mining and Refining in LAC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lithium&quot;&gt;Lithium&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of lithium carbonate, the key compound used in EV batteries, has increased tremendously in the last decade. While Australia is currently the world’s largest lithium producer, LAC is home to the renowned lithium triangle — comprised of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile — which is estimated to hold around 58 percent of the world’s lithium reserves. These countries have become major exporters of the mineral to China (see Figure 5). However, lack of infrastructure, weak institutions, and water crises are only a few of the challenges the region faces as it seeks to turn its lithium mining potential into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PzQ4mXU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: China’s Imports of Lithium Carbonate from Chile and Argentina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper, Bolivia has the world’s largest reserves of lithium, at 23 million tons, followed by Argentina (22 million tons) and Chile (11 million tons). But Bolivia’s efforts to capitalize on its resources remain mired in domestic politics — namely its effort to nationalize lithium starting in 2008 and the tight political control over the resource since exercised by the state-owned company YLB. In February 2019, President Evo Morales announced that his country would partner with China’s Xinjiang TBEA Group to advance the industrialization of the Coipasa and Pastos Grandes salt flats. This agreement eventually fell apart, however, due to the political turmoil caused by Morales’s election theft and subsequent flight from the country. The latest attempt to advance Bolivia’s lithium production came in June 2023 with the announcement of a $1.4 billion partnership with a consortium led by battery giant CATL to develop two lithium projects in the Uyuni and Coipasa salt flats. It remains to be seen if this venture will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina has positioned itself ahead of Bolivia by retaining business-friendly policies that have attracted investment in its lithium mining sector. These policies have propelled Argentina to become the fourth-largest producer of lithium in the world — after Australia, Chile, and China — generating around 5 percent of the world’s supply at three mines in the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, and Catamarca. According to some estimates, Argentina could overtake Chile as the largest producer in the lithium triangle by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina’s mining laws and regulatory landscape make it a more attractive partner. While the Bolivian government maintains full control of mining operations in its territory, Argentina’s laws allow local provinces to negotiate mining agreements directly with the private sector and limit royalties owed to the provinces to 3 percent. These benefits, and the ability of foreign companies to buy and operate mines, have allowed Chinese mining companies to acquire lithium mining operations and buy a significant percentage of the shares of other lithium mining companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Argentine government, there are currently 49 new lithium mining projects under development in the country’s northeast, seven of which are being developed by China. Of the seven lithium projects owned or partially owned by China, the Caucharí-Olaroz project has started production of lithium carbonate and the Mariana project has begun operations and is expected to begin production soon. The rest of the projects are in different stages of development, with two in the construction phase, two in the feasibility stage, and one in advanced exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chile is currently the top lithium producer in South America and the second-largest producer in the world, though this position may soon be overtaken by Argentina. In 2022, Chile produced about one-third of the world’s lithium and accounted for 89.5 percent of China’s total lithium carbonate imports, making it a key player in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until last year, Chile’s relatively open business environment attracted companies from the United States, Canada, and key Asian countries such as Japan. However, President Gabriel Boric’s new National Lithium Strategy, a move characterized by some as nationalization, has quickly reshaped the business landscape and may alter investor sentiment. According to the strategy, private sector entities must gradually transfer control of lithium operations to state-owned company Codelco, in what some experts argue is an effort to position Chile higher up the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, lithium extraction in Chile has been in the hands of two private companies, SQM and Albemarle. Albemarle is an American-based company, while SQM is a Chilean company in which China’s Tianqi Lithium has a 22 percent stake. It is unclear whether both SQM and Albemarle will continue their operations in the country past their contracts’ sunset clauses in 2030 and 2043, respectively. Indeed, at the time of writing, Tianqi had initiated an appeal that could slow down SQM’s planned partnership with Codelco. Chinese EV giant BYD was expected to invest $290 million in a new lithium project that combines mining, refining, and a cathode factory, answering Chile’s call for more local investment, but the project was recently reported as being on hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges faced by Chinese companies in Chile should be contextualized in the overall strong bilateral economic relationship. Chile was the first country in LAC to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with China, which it did in 2005, a time when China was growing at double-digit rates yearly and rapidly expanding its engagement with the region. Since then, Chile’s trade with China has surpassed its trade with the United States. It remains to be seen if concerns over exposure to Chinese markets and disputes over investments in Chile could lead Santiago to seek a more forceful economic diversification strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Chile’s lithium strategy has created some new challenges for Chinese companies, Mexico’s policies on natural resources over the past few years have shifted the lay of the land for Chinese companies seeking to tap into Mexico’s lithium reserves, estimated at 1.7 million tons. In 2022, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador ordered the creation of a state-owned company, LitioMx, which would take over the exploration, exploitation, and refining of lithium in the country. This decree jeopardized major concessions in the state of Sonora given to Bacanora Lithium in 2009, acquired later by Ganfeng, and should they win arbitration, it would cover the largest deposit of lithium identified in Mexico. In June of 2024, Ganfeng filed an arbitration case against Mexico, and although President Lopez Obrador has indicated a desire to find an agreement with the company, the road ahead is one of legal limbo. The incoming president, Claudia Sheinbaum, a close ally of Lopez Obrador, is expected to maintain a similar approach to retaining government control of mineral resources and has been vocal about her desire to expand Mexico’s position as an active player in the EV value chain, including in lithium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;copper&quot;&gt;Copper&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though not categorized as a critical mineral by the United States until 2023, copper is essential for EV production and is used in components ranging from batteries to wires. This makes LAC a pivotal player, as it produces about 40 percent of the world’s copper and contains the largest deposits of the ore, primarily located in Chile, Peru, and Mexico. China is a leading importer of copper, and its companies have made key investments in LAC to secure access to the resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese companies such as Minmetals (MMG), Guoxin, and Citic are important players in Peru’s mining sector. As a share of Peru’s total copper exports, sales of copper ore and copper concentrate to China have grown from 41 percent in 2012 to 76 percent in 2022, according to UN Comtrade data. Peru is an important case given its favorable business environment, which enabled Chinese companies to acquire two of the country’s largest copper mines, Las Bambas and Toromocho, though political instability in the country has caused a slowdown in investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Chile is undoubtedly the largest player in the copper industry, which accounts for over half of Chile’s total exports. Copper is a key commodity in the thriving Chile-China economic relationship. In 2022, out of the $22.8 billion in copper ore that Chile exported, $15.6 billion went to China, followed by Japan at $4.0 billion and South Korea at $935 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chile, 72 percent of copper mines are owned and operated by private companies; the other 28 percent are operated by Codelco, the state-owned enterprise, which gives China less latitude to invest in copper mines in the country or to buy them outright. While Chinese-owned firms play a smaller role in Chile than in Peru, China still maintains a strong investment presence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, Chinese companies remain important in the Latin American mining industry, but local conditions matter. Resource nationalization and especially political volatility can lead to declining investment overall, as epitomized by Bolivia’s challenges, and could have long-term impacts on the sector. However, tighter controls on the exploitation of natural resources by host governments can be beneficial, among other things, in ensuring more diversified sources of investment and in negotiating greater local benefits. Finally, some countries, such as Bolivia and Mexico, may see Chinese investment as the most realistic pathway to developing domestic resources and tapping into a growing export market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;refining&quot;&gt;Refining&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While investment in mineral extraction is a clear strategic goal, less intuitive are the forces behind a surge in interest in lithium refining in South America. One important driver of this trend is U.S. government policy. Per IRA rules, an EV qualifies for tax incentives if it is assembled in North America and the battery meets a series of requirements regarding mineral sourcing and the ownership of the companies involved throughout its value chain. All of these rules aim to incentivize lower levels of Chinese control over the supply chain and provide incentives for production outside of China. The result has been an immediate interest in countries that have FTAs with the United States (e.g., Chile) and those that may be able to secure sectoral agreements (e.g., Argentina).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the processing of critical minerals is concentrated in China, with some experts estimating that the country refines around 90 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals and 60–70 percent of lithium and cobalt. This has raised global concerns about the potential for disruption, price manipulation, and weaponization of highly concentrated supply chains. China’s 2023 decision to introduce export controls on graphite, germanium, and gallium has further fueled economic security concerns around minerals. Finally, as the United States makes historic investments in the energy transition, policymakers have tried to restrict how much of those financial incentives benefit Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other things, China’s position as the top smelter and refiner has long gone unchallenged because of the highly polluting and energy-intensive nature of those industries, though recent efforts by China to open new refining capabilities in LAC and Southeast Asia may signal a shift in this trend. In the case of lithium, for example, the raw material must undergo a series of chemical processes to produce lithium carbonate. With current technology, this process is very energy intensive and involves vast amounts of water, which in places such as Chile and Argentina can prove to be a significant challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another driver for Chinese companies to invest in refining capacity in LAC is the policies of countries in the region, most notably Chile. Despite having well-established copper refining operations, Chile’s lithium refining industry is still underdeveloped relative to its mining. With its new strategy, Chile seeks to position itself as the fourth-largest lithium refiner in the world to complement its sizable production of the mineral and, following protests about wealth inequality and development, ensure that more of Chile’s mineral wealth delivers local benefits. In October 2023, President Boric announced an investment of $233 million by Chinese giant Tsingshan Holding Group in Mejillones (located in the Antofagasta region) for a refining plant. Boric and his economic minister linked the deal explicitly to the country’s national strategy, which seeks to facilitate knowledge transfer and generate more value added. The Tsingshan deal followed the now-uncertain commitment by Chinese EV manufacturer BYD to build a refining facility in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithium refining is gaining momentum in Argentina as well, with several projects in various stages of development. In 2022, China’s battery giant Gotion High-Tech signed a joint venture agreement with Jujuy’s state-run mining company. Additionally, in 2021, Tsingshan signed a $1.7 billion joint venture with French firm Eramet, aiming to produce 24,000 tons of refined lithium carbonate. Questions remain in Chile and Argentina over the vast water requirements of the industry, which has sparked debates about the long-term viability of their lithium industries. The introduction by Chinese companies of direct lithium extraction technology could ameliorate some of these concerns, though it is liable to raise costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic policies play an important role in attracting investment in segments of the industry with higher value added. Governments are attempting to leverage access to their natural resources (an example set by Indonesia with its rules in the nickel industry) and their commercial links to larger markets such as the United States, as well as potential growth in their own markets. Access to the U.S. market and compliance with IRA tax credit requirements appear to be important factors, especially for Chile, which has an FTA with the United States. (Argentina is hoping for an exception to IRA rules, much like the one granted to Japan and the European Union, in order to qualify for IRA tax credits.) Long-awaited rules by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service — as well as the Department of Energy’s Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rule, which sets ownership standards as low as 25 percent to qualify for tax credits — have raised some challenges for Chinese companies hoping to qualify for tax credits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;battery-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Battery Manufacturing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there may be nascent signs that Chinese and LAC companies are interested in expanding lithium refining, the Latin American lithium-ion battery industry remains less dynamic. The industry overall is limited to a handful of factories throughout the continent. The only Chinese investment related to battery manufacturing appears to be a BYD plant in Manaus, Brazil, which started production in 2020. It is unclear if the facility can produce battery cells; it appears to be mainly focused on battery pack assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BYD is largely known for its vehicles, but the company is a leading battery manufacturer and supplies other automakers as well. The Manaus plant, however, appears to be primarily dedicated to producing batteries for BYD buses made at the Campinas plant near São Paulo, which opened in 2015 in southeastern Brazil. This may change as BYD’s new auto factory in Camaçari, in eastern Brazil, comes online in 2025 and increases demand for batteries. BYD also produces solar panels in the country, which are increasingly installed alongside stationary battery storage worldwide. It is not immediately clear if the batteries that support the solar plants are produced by BYD or whether they may be produced locally at the Manaus plant in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BYD’s battery production in Brazil is likely aimed primarily at fulfilling local demand and supporting the company’s automotive production in the country, which is the largest market in LAC. Indeed, given current transportation costs and the large investments taking place within the United States, it seems unlikely that Chinese-led battery production in Brazil could be aimed at the export market. This is very different from the dynamic observed in refining and mining, where Chinese firms are tapping into LAC natural resources for export to China or are establishing refining facilities to better access markets in third countries such as the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been at least two other high-profile Chinese battery plant projects that have received news coverage without making any significant progress. Chery, a Chinese automotive manufacturer that is a significant player in the internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV industries, announced a large project in Argentina in early 2023. Although some reports suggest that the proposed manufacturing complex would feature battery manufacturing capacity, this seems unlikely, since the company does not produce its own batteries. Regardless, the project seems to have stalled in the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second project that has failed to come to fruition is a CATL factory in Mexico, first reported in 2022, which could have potentially supplied Tesla’s factory in Texas. However, the plan has been on pause since the fall of 2022 after the IRA was made law. CATL has since pursued a licensing agreement with Ford to make lithium iron phosphate batteries in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CATL’s pivot to the U.S. market reflects a general challenge to building batteries (and EVs) in LAC. The incentives offered by the IRA have led to a surge of investments in the United States by some of the world’s leading battery manufacturers (BYD being a notable exception). The IRA has also helped to drive more refining investment in countries that have FTAs with the United States, including Chile, as well as more manufacturing investment in Mexico, but it has complicated the position of Chinese firms that would otherwise be the biggest players in these sectors. Moreover, given the incentives available in the United States — expected to remain the largest EV market in the Americas for the foreseeable future — there is less reason for battery manufacturers to make investments in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ev-manufacturing-and-assembly&quot;&gt;EV Manufacturing and Assembly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the manufacturing of EVs and their components, two countries stand out: Brazil and Mexico (see Figure 6). This makes sense, as they are the largest markets in LAC, as well as the most sophisticated manufacturing bases — including in the automotive sector. Yet there are significant differences between the two countries and in the types of investments that Chinese firms are making. The biggest variable appears to be Mexico’s special trading relationship with the United States, epitomized by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Indeed, Mexico benefits significantly from the IRA, which allows companies in the country to qualify for the same credits as those making vehicles and batteries in the United States. However, this also means that Mexico has been under pressure to be more cautious in its approach to Chinese investment, as such investment is viewed as a direct pathway to the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gnqgGF8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Chinese Investments in EV Manufacturing in Latin America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these dynamics, there have been no overt investments in Mexico by Chinese EV manufacturers to date, despite significant news coverage. Although BYD has signaled interest in opening a plant in Mexico and is reportedly in discussions with state governments, reports suggest that the project is on pause until at least the outcomes of the 2024 U.S. elections and Mexico’s judicial reforms are known. Similarly, Chery’s subsidiary Jetour announced its interest in investing in a $3 billion facility with a local partner to assemble vehicles, including EVs, in Mexico in 2023, but no progress has been made even in identifying the location. Finally, Foton, a Chinese manufacturer of commercial vehicles that has a plant for ICE vehicles in Mexico, also announced its plans to build an EV factory in the country in 2023. However, no progress has been reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason why announcements may have not led to actual investments is that Mexico City has made clear that it will not offer financial incentives to Chinese firms looking to establish facilities in the country, leaving Chinese firms requesting such incentives from state governments with fewer resources. Additionally, only a few state governments are likely destinations for Chinese auto manufacturers, meaning that only a small subset of states would be likely to receive local benefits in the absence of federal incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This contrasts with the rapid expansion of Chinese investments in Mexico (most prominently in Nuevo León) in less sensitive sectors that can more easily export products to the United States, including furniture and automotive components. New restrictions on connected vehicles using Chinese software and equipment are expected once the U.S. Department of Commerce completes its security review, likely precluding Chinese companies from exporting to the United States from Mexico. This means that it is increasingly likely that any investments in Mexico by Chinese EV makers would predominantly aim to serve the local market and demand from countries in Central and South America. This is consistent with the strategy pursued in other emerging markets ranging from Thailand to Brazil. Chinese firms may believe that locating themselves in Mexico would allow them to take advantage of its strong automotive manufacturing base and the common language throughout much of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investments in Brazil are even more clearly aimed at the domestic and regional markets. In 2023, the Brazilian automotive market reached 2.3 million vehicles, which although by far the largest in South America is much smaller than the 15.5 million sold in the same year in the United States. Yet Brazil’s sizable population — 216 million in 2023, according to the World Bank — makes it a potentially lucrative market as its middle class continues to grow. Most leading automotive companies have an established presence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil’s existing industrial infrastructure, combined with a growing market, has likely been a draw for Chinese firms. Demand for EVs in Brazil has outpaced expectations, surging from 1 percent to almost 5 percent of sales between April 2023 and April 2024. Of the battery electric and plug-in hybrid models sold in the country, the majority are Chinese brands with highly competitive prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great Wall Motor (GWM) took over a Mercedes-Benz plant in Iracemápolis in 2021 and is expected to start production of hybrid models there in 2024. BYD, to great fanfare, began revamping a former Ford factory in Bahia in the same year, part of a large EV manufacturing hub that could help meet President Lula’s green industrial policy objectives. If BYD starts production in 2025 as planned, this would be its third factory in the country, after the Manaus battery facility and the Campinas bus-manufacturing facility. Finally, CAOA Chery, a joint venture between CAOA, a Brazilian company, and Chery, which owns two plants in the country, is reportedly aiming to start production of two EV models in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Brazilian market is potentially attractive, GWM and BYD are likely looking beyond the country’s borders in the long term. Brazil could easily serve as an export hub for the region if demand in LAC countries grows — especially if Chinese manufacturing in Mexico becomes too controversial or does not take off. However, exports to the United States are unlikely at this stage because these factories are not yet operational and will likely be producing vehicles for a different market — at least initially. Regulation of software and data collection capacity through connected vehicles, the subject of an ongoing probe at the U.S. Department of Commerce, may also restrict the ability of Chinese auto manufacturers to export to the United States for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese investments in the EV value chain in LAC appear to remain highly concentrated in mining, although more investments are observable in the refining and assembly segments. Market demand, local government policies, and U.S. market access requirements are likely to determine whether investment continues to expand in the industry. Another crucial factor worth watching will be the successes and challenges faced by the Chinese companies that are undertaking these novel types of investments; their experiences will inform decisions by other firms, as well as Beijing’s own strategy of engagement with countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trends outlined in this paper suggest that LAC countries may find new opportunities to meet their own development targets and potentially accelerate their transitions to low-emissions transportation sectors. However, for many countries, deepening dependency on China will present risks, especially at a time when the country is unlikely to experience the high growth rates of previous decades. While Chinese investments could offer a welcome path to economic and FDI diversification in some sectors for some countries (e.g., battery and vehicle assembly in Brazil), they may lead to further concentration of critical resources under Chinese-controlled firms in others (e.g., Argentina or Peru). This points to a fragile balance that governments will need to strike to both meet their own goals and maintain a productive relationship with the United States. Indeed, growing geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing are unlikely to soften in the short term and could have some negative spillover effects for countries in LAC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This context is important for U.S. policymakers as they evaluate the risks and opportunities that emerge from China’s engagement with LAC in this space. In many ways, U.S. policy shapes how these investments and supply chains develop. IRA clauses that catalyze investment around the world, including in LAC, can help diversify supply chains and could generate growth in LAC countries. This could help strengthen ties to the United States and should be further explored as a tool that can create mutual benefits with partner countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, however, the United States will need to use its political capital carefully. In some situations, Washington may want to discourage specific Chinese investments, should they be a threat to national security. However, encouraging countries to reject Chinese FDI altogether would damage U.S. relationships. This is especially true at a time when the United States is experiencing historic influxes of FDI in the battery and EV industry domestically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States pursues a policy of limiting Chinese investments that threaten national security, identifying the real risks to U.S. national security in China’s new outbound investment surge will be crucial. What emerges from the case of EV value chains in LAC, for example, is a significant variation in the nature and objectives of the investments, as well as in host countries’ policies to attract investment and manage trade. Although a large number of projects fall under Chinese FDI, their implications and risk levels vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current U.S. economic security strategy is coalescing around the objective of building more resilient and diversified supply chains for critical resources. This points to the importance of tracking Chinese investments in the mining industry in LAC. It is critical to follow which companies are investing where and how those investments fit in the context of the host country, as well as to identify chokepoints and policies that can ameliorate risks. For example, one productive approach could include working with LAC governments to develop policies that ensure more local government control over resources and encourage the cultivation of a diverse set of economic actors. This could include using new technologies to help enforce stricter environmental, social, and governance standards, as well as improving transparency on the part of companies that invest in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAC countries could consider new policies that would support their own economic targets as well as U.S. supply chain diversification objectives. For example, they could pursue policies that incentivize Chinese companies to share technology and invest more in value added sectors, such as through joint ventures. Governments could also take more direct action by providing targeted seed funding to universities and companies to encourage them to move up the value chain in key industries. These firms would need markets, and to this end LAC governments could seek reciprocity with China in value-added sectors and diversify exports. Finally, governments should continue to ensure that all investments meet the highest environmental standards. Strong implementation will continue to be important as the mining and refining of critical minerals expands in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese manufacturing investment aimed at supplying the non-U.S. market is clearly less of a direct security challenge for the United States, but it may remain a significant challenge for U.S. companies operating in LAC. Mexico’s proximity to the United States puts it in a special position and earns it extra scrutiny. In fact, it is likely that concerns over Chinese investments in Mexican manufacturing will have a deleterious impact on the 2026 USMCA review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LAC manufacturing question points to the bigger issue of U.S. competitiveness. Although Chinese firms in the EV and battery space have benefitted and continue to benefit from large state subsidies, they have also reshaped the automotive industry and raised the bar significantly in terms of performance and affordability for EVs — with affordability often being the decisive sales factor in developing regions such as LAC. An affirmative strategy to incentivize U.S. companies to produce better products for non-U.S. markets would likely have better long-term results than solely focusing on market protection tools. Indeed, competition with Chinese companies may in some cases help U.S. firms engage with cutting-edge technology and improve their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this study has limited itself to analyzing investments in the EV manufacturing value chain, two connected industries will likely become more important in the coming years as EV adoption grows in LAC: (1) software and data managements, and (2) EV charging. Software and data management is an area where more cooperation with places such as the United States, which is hampered by the lack of comprehensive national regulation, and the European Union, which has one of the most developed data protection regimes globally, would be beneficial for LAC stakeholders. Concerns over connected vehicles powered by Chinese software are increasing, and more research would be beneficial to evaluate risks and technical solutions. Without a concerted effort on software and data management issues, Chinese firms could continue to dominate in those industries as they do in LAC’s digital infrastructure and information and communications technology networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of EV charging, Chinese state-owned companies control significant electricity transmission infrastructure in Peru and Brazil. The increased demand for electric charging infrastructure may provide more opportunities for Chinese companies, which could benefit from significant vertical integration despite the existence of strong international competitors. In this sector, as in the others analyzed, the United States would benefit from careful analysis of real risks and alternative pathways to encourage more diversification.&lt;/p&gt;

China’s strategy does not seek to replace the United States in the Middle East, push it out, or outcompete it. Instead, China is working to untie the Middle East from the United States and to make the region and the world more receptive to China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dating back to the early Cold War and continuing since, the United States has worked to encourage the growth of free and open societies in the Middle East and around the world. An important part of China’s Middle East strategy is encouraging appreciation that China’s decades of remarkable economic growth, as well as its global rise, occurred under the firm guidance of the Chinese Communist Party. Whereas the United States explicitly encourages imitation among allies — and, in the eyes of many countries, social and political instability — China seeks to legitimize the idea that there are myriad pathways to prosperity and security. China’s Middle East outreach efforts proclaim its noninterference in domestic affairs and a focus on mutually beneficial economic partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle Eastern states seeking leverage with the United States have seized on the idea of a China model. In part, this is to legitimize their own resistance to U.S. calls for domestic liberalization. But equally importantly, expressing openness to engagement with China on looser Chinese terms puts them “in play” and allows them to demand more from the United States. Even close partners of the United States, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, have expressed interest in drawing closer to China. Their interest is in part due to China’s rising global influence, but it also reflects a desire to blunt what they see as U.S. hegemony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, increased Middle Eastern interest in a China model specifically, and closer ties to China more generally, calls for a three-pronged effort. The first prong is largely internal and requires clarifying U.S. priorities in the Middle East and the role the United States seeks to play. As part of this, the United States should consolidate its 20-year effort to transition from security provider to security partner. The second prong is gaining a better understanding of regional governments’ concerns and motivations. The United States needs to tailor U.S. engagement more closely to regional governments’ needs, and it needs to untangle slow bureaucratic processes that make sense to Americans but not to those they seek to help. The third prong is to get better at imposing consequences for bad behavior and incentivizing good behavior, for allies and adversaries alike. Doing so would inject dynamism into U.S. regional diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Middle East looks forward, the region’s urgent strategic need is to grow its human capital. This is necessitated both by the rising number of young people seeking employment and the implications of the energy transition. The U.S. ability to contribute to regional governments’ efforts to address this need — in terms of education, training, and a business climate that helps build capacity — is unparalleled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China will continue to seek to increase its role in the Middle East. The United States should not fear China’s presence. Rather, the United States needs to sharpen regional understandings of the value of U.S. partnerships, lower the costs of maintaining them, and clarify the consequences of undermining them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifteen Saudi horsemen bearing Chinese and Saudi flags surrounded Chinese president Xi Jinping’s limousine as it entered the lush gardens of Riyadh’s Yamama Palace in December 2022. The disparity between the honor guard in brilliant white robes astride stallions and the sleek black limousine gliding on a spotless stone pavement was striking, but this is the image the Saudis seek to project to the world: simultaneously traditional and modern, powerful, hospitable, and very much in control. Cameras captured Xi’s arrival from the side, the front, and overhead, ensuring full appreciation of the majesty of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s visit was a marked contrast to President Joe Biden’s visit to Jiddah the previous July. Biden’s arrival was captured in a carefully scripted fist bump with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. A single official Saudi photographer captured the moment, and a single image was released. Although the crown prince normally beams when photographed greeting guests, his expression in this photo was almost blank, perhaps through prearrangement. The fist bump, ostensibly a Covid-19 precaution, became the shorthand for the visit. One could say it was warm, one could say it was contrived, but there was one thing it clearly was not: normal. The White House had such an aversion to the idea that Biden would be photographed shaking the beaming crown prince’s hand that it seems to have carefully negotiated an alternative. In doing so, the U.S. government created an indelible image of the strained and shifting U.S.-Saudi relationship and paved the way for a sharply contrasting visit by a Chinese head of state six months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans are accustomed to occupying a position of primacy in the world, and particularly in the Middle East. This is derived partly from a conviction that the whole world wants to be like the United States. Centuries of immigration to North America from every corner of the globe have persuaded many Americans of the enduring attractiveness of U.S. society, as well as its universal adaptability to peoples and cultures. Spreading what many Americans saw as the blessings of freedom and prosperity across the North American continent was a key U.S. government priority until the end of the nineteenth century; for much of the twentieth century, countless U.S. officials maintained an equally sharp focus on sharing what they saw as the gifts of the American way of life with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, many foreign governments, and especially those in the Middle East, have deep reservations about becoming too much like the United States. They see the U.S. path as one that threatens their culture and history, risks wrapping them in chaos and failure, and jeopardizes their power at home and abroad. For some of them, China represents an exemplar of a society that has remained true to its roots, nurtured a vibrant economy, managed social change, and maintained tight political control, all by following a path very different from the U.S. one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four decades of the Cold War conditioned the United States to treat admiration as a zero-sum game, and capturing the imagination of governments and societies as they think about their future has been an important aspect of U.S. soft power for much of the last hundred years. As Joseph Nye wrote in his seminal essay on the topic in 1990:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A state may achieve the outcomes it prefers in world politics because other states want to follow it. . . . This second aspect of power — which occurs when one country gets other countries to want what it wants — might be called co-optive or soft power in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, China has increased its own soft-power efforts, intended at least in part to dent what Chinese officials see as U.S. hegemony. While China has generally not promoted a discrete “China model” for other states to emulate, there has been a substantial, albeit superficial conversation in Middle Eastern states about what lessons China’s experience holds for their development. While China is not necessarily provoking this conversation, it is nurturing it. This conversation has geopolitical implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do countries such as China and the United States use the power of example to engage in competition and advance their interests in the Middle East? How do Arab governments view U.S. and Chinese attempts at influence and models of development, and why is there a greater affinity toward a China model in the region? Given the above, and China’s increasing influence in the region, what are the policy implications for the U.S. position and for U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addressing these questions, this paper explores the popular discussion of a China model in the Middle East, as well as how Arab governments and the Chinese government use the idea of a China model to push back on what each sees as the excesses of the U.S. government. These countries’ interests are not identical, but they are congruent. Arab states are seeking to maximize the value they derive from the sum of their varied diplomatic relationships, increasingly pursuing cooperation in parallel with global powers rather than joining one discrete bloc or another. They also seek to maintain control over their domestic environments, blocking social trends and political movements that they believe will undermine their stability. Deeper engagement with the Chinese government, and the Chinese example itself, advances their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s interests are more complicated. The country’s economic growth depends on imported energy. About half of that imported energy comes from the Middle East, where the United States is the predominant power. Beijing is wary of conflict with the United States in the Middle East, and it seeks neither to compete head-to-head nor to displace Washington. Instead, China seeks to make inroads into the region without either getting bogged down or tipping the Middle East into instability. Doing so means enticing countries currently aligned with the United States to adopt a more unaligned posture, and it often uses state-directed economic engagement as its calling card. The Chinese government explicitly contrasts itself with the U.S. government, noting that it can move more quickly and predictably, that it neither second-guesses nor lectures its partners, and that its goal is not to remake them in China’s own image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vehicle for much of this is the impression — probably stronger in the Middle East than in China itself — that there is a tangible China model that can guide radical economic transformation without accompanying social and political disruption. The “China experience,” as some Chinese prefer to call it, is an impressive one: decades of double-digit growth accompanied by huge investments in industrialization and massive internal migration. Even so, most Arab understandings of China remain remarkably superficial. Arab states impressed with China’s remarkable rise often seem more interested in China’s outcomes than the path China took to achieve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand what this means for U.S. interests, this paper analyzes how the Chinese and Arab governments each use the inchoate idea of a China model as a key tool through which they advance their own interests vis-à-vis the U.S. government. This study is especially salient now. Middle Eastern states are uniquely focused on how the energy transition will force a profound change in the region’s political economy in the next three decades. With so many Middle Eastern economies tied to hydrocarbons — either producing them or relying on worker remittances, investment, and government assistance from energy-producing countries — regional governments are especially open to exploring alternative models of development. The Arab uprisings of 2010–11 gave governments an experience of political discontent boiling over. China is still largely able to project an image of strong economic growth and political stability. Many Arab states are urgently seeking to diversify their economies while sustaining the prevailing political and social order. For them, China’s example suggests an enticing set of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States, which has been the preponderant global power in the Middle East for more than a half-century, the Middle East’s rising fascination with the China model is an important phenomenon. In part, this is because the United States retains a vital strategic interest in the Middle East deriving from the region’s roles in global energy markets, in the global economy more broadly, and in global nonproliferation efforts. Middle Eastern states’ use of the idea of a China model to develop leverage against — and potentially undermine — U.S. policies toward the region creates a need for a thoughtful U.S. policy response. In addition, because China-U.S. competition has become the overwhelming strategic focus in the United States, China’s instrumentalization of Middle Eastern states’ admiration to advance its own policy interests at the expense of the United States becomes an issue of strategic concern with bearing on U.S. interests in Africa, Latin America, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this paper demonstrates how Arab governments and China converge on the idea that there are ways to achieve U.S.-style economic performance without embracing liberal societies. It does not seek to evaluate whether such approaches are viable or if the plans that governments carry out hew more closely to U.S. or Chinese development models, in part because China itself seems not to care. But it is also because Middle Eastern governments themselves are seeking to strike a balance between multiple imperatives rather than make a binary decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this paper will proceed as follows. First, it begins by reviewing how states that have seen themselves on the brink of change think of different models of development. It further explores how the U.S. and Chinese governments have thought about their own development experiences, what parts of that they believe are relevant to other countries, and how they have sought to share their lessons. Second, this paper examines the broader context of U.S.-Chinese competition, and how that competition has manifested in the Middle East, paying close attention to both countries’ perceived stakes in the patterns of governance in Middle Eastern states. In particular, this section carefully explores China’s efforts to engage broadly with three states:Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. These countries are of varying size, have different political economies, and have had different trajectories. All of them are important to both the United States and China. The section analyzes how these major Arab states perceive both China’s actions and China’s lessons for their own societies. Finally, the essay concludes with the implications of its findings and recommendations for U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;competing-and-contested-development-models&quot;&gt;Competing and Contested Development Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inspirational power of the American experiment has been a thread running through much of U.S. history, but it is only in the last three-quarters of a century that Americans have drawn a clear and consistent connection between spreading that model and advancing U.S. national interests. China has had a relatively more complicated task in the last 35 years. It has sought to navigate between advancing its interests in the globalized world that the United States and its partners constructed while ensuring that its engagement in that world does not advantage the United States at China’s expense. China’s breathtaking economic growth in the 1990s and 2000s involved its partial adoption of Western mores. At the same time, it involved an assertion of China’s distinctiveness. China’s success in doing both simultaneously has had more benefits for China than one might initially suspect. It has both helped boost international interest in China and encouraged other states to assert their own distinctiveness and reject U.S. hegemony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the United States and China are seeking to tap into an enduring trend in the Middle East and around the world. While all governments seek agency over their futures, sometimes governments undergoing especially profound transitions have sought inspiration from external models to help them guide changes more purposively. Faced with innumerable challenges and decisions, foreign expertise has often helped to inform their choices and model their trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In broad historical terms, both countries are newcomers to foreign admiration. For governments considering their options in the nineteenth century, neither the United States nor China was of much interest. The United States was too different, inhaling immigrants from much of Europe and conquering its own vast continent. Its proud pioneer culture and robust individualism had no equivalent, and no bearing, on much of the world. China was in the midst of its “century of humiliation,” as the depredations of foreign powers ate away at the withering Qing Dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there was a European model of development, manifested in Africa, Asia, and Latin America by colonial administrations that sought to impose modernity and order on societies while extending investment opportunities for European private capital. They passed laws and created capital markets, and they advanced notions of citizenship that gave rights to local inhabitants even as they often gave superior rights to citizens of the metropole. European colonial powers fostered coteries of elite clients in their colonies, but for ambitious local governments, it seemed perilous to get too close to the colonial enterprise. The danger of being swallowed up in the European imperial maw always lurked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, Prussia seemed much more relevant, and it seemed to be a power on the march. For example, as Meiji Japan watched Western countries capitalize on China’s relative weakness, Japanese officials sought to replicate the Prussian experiment with great urgency. More than 50 years ago, Barrington Moore argued that similarities between imperial Germany and Meiji Japan were, in the words of Mark R. Thompson, “the product of political learning. Meiji Japanese reformers, after carefully examining several Western countries’ political systems, chose the German model because of its illiberal but modern politics.” In this reading, Japan’s leaders explicitly chose a German development model, with economic, political, and military implications for Japan and for the world in the century to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the twentieth century, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk’s modernization project also cast a wary eye on development models that sought to engender liberal systems. Many recall Ataturk’s zeal for Westernization — he famously adopted the Latin alphabet, banned the fez, emancipated women, and put secularism at the center of politics. Yet despite adopting superficial aspects of Western style, it was the Soviet experiment in state-driven industrialization that seemed genuinely enticing to him and his circle. The Soviet model not only promised rapid results while reinforcing state power, but it also presented an opportunity to “overturn Western economic and political dominance,” which had been an Ottoman sore spot for more than a century. Turkish nationalists did not seek to align with the Western bourgeoisie that had helped dismantle the Ottoman empire; they sought to develop the state so as to give Turkey the strength to be an independent power. The noncommunist aspects of the Soviet model, with its modernization agendas, five-year plans, and skepticism of Western intentions, aligned closely with the new Turkish leadership’s instincts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of fascism in the interwar period represented a wholesale rejection of the Western liberal development model. Fascists offered the European public a clearly formulated and comprehensive solution to a status quo that was, to some, economically, politically, and socio-culturally unsatisfactory. In the words of Michael Mann, a prominent chronicler, “All of these regimes worshipped order and protected private property; all embraced authoritarian statism, rejecting federalism, democracy, and their supposed ‘vices’: disorderly class conflict, political corruption, and moral decline.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each case noted above — Meiji Japan, Ataturk’s Turkey, and fascist Germany and Italy — states sought what they believed to be scientific efficiency, in stark contrast to what they saw as the weak and disorderly approach of liberal democracies. Meiji Japan adopted illiberal Westernization, Turkey sought to adopt more liberal social policies while embracing more authoritarian economic policies, and fascism was largely a rejection of liberalism more broadly. In all cases, ruling elites were unwilling to leave the fate of the nation in the hands of an unruly and self-interested cosmopolitan business class. All of these movements called for a firm hand from the top and limited engagement from below. It is an instinct that is in stark contrast with the U.S. model, and more consonant with a Chinese model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-example-of-social-and-economic-development&quot;&gt;The U.S. Example of Social and Economic Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government’s Cold War efforts to win hearts and minds throughout the world were an innovation. While priorities shifted from administration to administration, underlying all U.S. efforts was a deep belief in both the desirability and replicability of American patterns of life. Inspired by mostly European philosophers such as John Locke, few Americans have ever doubted the universal relevance of American truths. What was in question, instead, was the level of effort Americans should put into spreading them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of the world in the nineteenth century, the United States did not have much inspirational power. This is in part because the U.S. government’s tasks were unique: populating a continent, exploiting seemingly endless natural resources, and capitalizing on the country’s almost complete isolation from potentially hostile powers. But Americans often took their country’s inspirational potential for granted. It is not a coincidence that much of the U.S. engagement with the rest of the world in the nineteenth century was through missionaries and traders, not through diplomats and soldiers. Their “Good News” was only partly religious. Echoing the themes stressed by the French nobleman Alexis de Tocqueville in Democracy in America, many were guided by a broad belief that uniquely American values stressing the importance of individualism, industriousness, property rights, and political expression provided a universal key to both prosperity and progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States began to play a more active role in global affairs immediately after World War I, the post-war isolationist current ran strong. The Wilsonian impulse to “make the world safe for democracy” soon ebbed, and U.S. politicians expressed fear that internationalism would merely benefit profiteers at home and draw the United States into endless European conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, after World War II, U.S. officials were convinced that securing the country required blocking Marxist inroads in the developing world and expanding the circle of freedom to reach the billions who lived there. They took their missionary heritage and set out to replicate U.S. conditions abroad, using the U.S. historical experience as their template to use economic and political development to prosecute the Cold War. Drawing on Louis Hartz’s notion of an American liberal tradition, Robert Packenham suggests in his 1973 study that four propositions long guided U.S. policymakers working in the developing world: “1) Change and development are easy 2) All good things go together 3) Radicalism and revolution are bad 4) Distributing power is more important than accumulating power.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the anti-colonial sentiments of the Roosevelt administration converged with the anti-communism of the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, many believed that the United States was well positioned not only to win the Cold War, but also to eliminate much of the world’s poverty. Commonsense U.S. efforts such as those of the Tennessee Valley Authority and cooperative extension programs were the salve the world needed. Such programs would provide enabling environments for private enterprise rather than an enduring role for repressive governments. Spreading prosperity to long-immiserated populations would do more than merely improve their quality of life. It would also inoculate these populations from the appeal of Soviet communism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this U.S. strategy included a heavy dose of self-interest. If foreign elites were enveloped in a warm embrace of shared goals and common interests, they could help lead their states to carry out policies that advance those goals and interests, creating a world more favorable to U.S. priorities. While the U.S. model seeks to be competitive, it does not seek to bolster U.S. dominance to ensure that the United States wins every economic competition. Instead, it seeks to incentivize counterparts to participate in the system compatible with U.S. interests, enable them to compete successfully, and dissuade them from swinging into opposition. It was the manifestation of Nye’s soft power, whereby the United States would encourage other countries to “want what it wants.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, after World War II the United States led the construction of a global system of institutions to regulate and arbitrate between economic interests. The United States broadly advanced a policy that emphasized private enterprise, free markets, open trade, and the integration of national economies into the world economy by emphasizing the comparative advantage of exports. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank, multinational corporations, and U.S. government all worked to advance these policies. Embedded in these international institutions was attention to the rights of the individual and adherence to the rule of law. Land reform and community development played a significant role in postwar development efforts, seeking to develop communities of freeholders who could shape their own societies and destinies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The not-so-implicit adversary in this was the Soviet Union, which linked the collapse of colonialism with the end of capitalism. The Soviet model retained a strong Leninist strain, requiring a party to assert a dictatorship of the proletariat to help guide society toward communism and avoiding the rights-driven approach of the United States and its allies. The Soviet Union saw a need to win supporters, though. Seeing similar stakes to the United States, the Soviet Union invested in major international development projects, sometimes at the expense of Moscow’s direct interests. The Soviet Union’s construction of Egypt’s Aswan High Dam was a part of this effort. Picking up a project that the World Bank had abandoned under U.S. pressure, Soviet engineers partnered with Gamal Abdel Nasser in a project to reshape Egyptian agriculture and the whole Egyptian economy. Abdel Nasser’s embrace of “Arab socialism” was not a condition of the dam’s construction, but his increasing alignment with the Soviet Union and increasingly strained relations with the United States represented a victory for Soviet policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-us-record-in-middle-east-development&quot;&gt;The U.S. Record in Middle East Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For much of its history, the U.S. government treated the Middle East as an afterthought. The United States mostly forsook the European scramble for influence in the region in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, until the rise of the petroleum age coincided with the decline of European regional power and the rise of Soviet communism. Fearing a vacuum, Americans perceived heightened stakes of projecting U.S. influence into the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the Middle East was not the principal focus of U.S. efforts, nor was the U.S. government’s focus in the Middle East independent from its approach elsewhere in the world. The United States established security relationships with a wide array of regional governments, and it stepped up those efforts when Great Britain pulled back from the region after 1970. The United States also engaged in economic development efforts, limited in most places but significant in some, and especially significantly with Israel and the Arab states that made peace with it. It built educational and cultural ties, as elite Arabs in the 1970s and 1980s eschewed Cairo and sought university educations for their children in Princeton, Cambridge, and Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all that the United States embraced a Cold War commitment to helping Middle Eastern states develop along U.S. lines, U.S. efforts to promote economic development overseas have yielded mixed results. For example, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has invested more than $30 billion in Egypt since 1978. According to the USAID website, its “Economic Growth” program has sought to “improve the policy and business regulatory environment, stimulate entrepreneurship, strengthen enterprises, improve the workforce, and enhance trade.” As part of its efforts, USAID has also maintained a democracy and governance program in Egypt to promote values of democracy, human rights, and inclusion alongside improvements in economic performance. USAID has sought to increase the accountability and efficiency of public institutions and remove barriers to economic and social participation for marginalized communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, after four decades of continuous economic assistance that have made Egypt one of the largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid in the world, the World Bank continues to classify Egypt as a lower-middle-income country. Successive Egyptian governments have regularly rebuffed U.S. efforts to engender a more vibrant private sector and spread democratic values, or they have frustrated them. Egyptian officials have long complained that U.S. aid represents unacceptable meddling in the country’s internal affairs and that economic aid funds ultimately end up lining the pockets of U.S. firms rather than benefitting Egyptians. Democracy and governance programs have been a special sore point. In an extreme instance, an AMIDEAST employee contracted to work on the Administration of Justice Project said that the U.S. and Egyptian governments took a decade merely to agree on a scope of work. In part because of tensions over priorities and implementation, U.S. economic assistance has been diminishing since 1998, from a high of over $800 million annually to current levels of just over $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have not been targets of U.S. development assistance in anything like the same way, although the U.S. government provided technical assistance to both countries as their governments sought to create modern institutions for what had until recently been tribal sheikhdoms. The strong involvement of U.S.-based oil companies in the development of the petroleum industry, before and after the nationalization of oil production, helped ensure that both countries’ national economies developed along lines compatible with U.S. interests. U.S. government efforts to promote democracy and governance were often more subtle, in part because of fewer opportunities in the absence of aid vehicles, and in part because both countries are ruled by royal families that consider the prospect of participatory politics with alarm but are keen to pursue a strategic alignment with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-chinese-proposition&quot;&gt;The Chinese Proposition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s history differs starkly from that of the United States. Over three millennia the country experienced great power and wealth. The so-called “century of humiliation” that preceded the country’s communist revolution was a reminder of the constant threats that Chinese governments feared looming beyond their borders. The richness of Chinese culture spoke for itself, but China never saw that culture as a universal proposition with much relevance outside of China. China extracted tribute from surrounding states and expanded its continental reach into Central Asia, but as European imperialism spread in the nineteenth century, China saw itself as the victim of global powers rather than their peer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The victory of Mao Zedong’s revolutionaries in 1949 put China in an unaccustomed place, ideologically committed to a political project with global ambitions and presumed universal relevance. China’s actual efforts in that regard were modest, however, and Deng Xiaoping’s effective renunciation of the Marxist-Leninist global project removed an area of conflict with the West. Even more strikingly, Deng’s “four modernizations” — the urgent need for advances in agriculture, industry, national defense, and science — pushed China to open to the outside world while relying on the communist party to insulate the country from the depredations of foreign powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the decades since, China’s history has combined with the legacy of Deng’s instincts to prompt the country to be modest in its claims and defensive in its posture. While Chinese “Wolf Warrior diplomacy” under Xi Jinping has been more assertive, in part because it presumes a broader decline in Western power, it generally has been less interested in asserting the wisdom of its model to foreign audiences than in protecting its own legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China has engaged increasingly in the Middle East in the last 25 years, it has backed away from Soviet concepts of a zero-sum ideological competition with the United States. Instead, China often has gone out of its way to appear nonthreatening to Middle Eastern states and Western powers alike, advertising its modesty and trumpeting an interest in “win-win solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also avoided being doctrinaire about its approach. In contrast to the Marxist-Leninist tracts of Soviet authors, there is a lively debate within and outside of China about what constitutes a China model for development, or if one exists at all. Western analysts have tended to treat it as an argument for authoritarian-led economic development that is exemplary in its ability to “make large, complex decisions quickly, and to make them relatively well, at least in economic policy.” Although some argue that authoritarian development already had a strong history in Southeast Asia by the time China adopted it after Mao’s death and that Chinese expatriate communities in adjacent countries may have been involved in triggering its execution in China, China’s size and its dramatic pace of growth in the two decades between 1990 and 2010 made it a very different kind of example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, when the Chinese economy was growing most strongly, some of the greatest successes occurred in cities that took very different approaches from each other to economic development. Chongqing’s charismatic communist party secretary pushed an approach that some scholars described as populist and “Maoist-revivalist,” Guandong pursued a policy that seemed largely neoliberal and capitalist, and the Shanghai government seemed largely technocratic and technologically focused. The experimentation that Deng opened in the late 1970s continued to expand for decades in China. Yuen Yuen Ang argues persuasively that the Chinese have pursued varying strategies at different times and places, and she argues that Chinese government policy is best characterized as “directed improvisation.” Whereas Mao pursued ruinous top-down strategies, his successors set dynamic parameters for local officials to follow. They set boundaries, defined criteria for success, and encouraged the flow of industry and capital to less-developed regions. The “China model,” then, can be seen less as a set of processes than as a set of philosophies that produced strong outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s interest, arguably, is less about winning over imitators than it is about gaining legitimacy for its efforts. While Chinese leaders speak openly and repeatedly about a “China solution” (alternately translated as a “China proposal”), Chinese leaders take pains to limit its reach. Xi Jinping told a group of leaders of political parties in 2017, “We do not want to ‘import’ models from other countries, nor do we want to ‘export’ the Chinese model, still less will we ask other countries to copy the Chinese practice.” Noting that China itself adopted communism from overseas, he continued, “As a Chinese saying goes, a stone taken from another mountain may serve as a tool to polish the local jade. The CPC will embrace and approach the achievements of other cultures with an open mind and a broad perspective. We stay committed to engaging in dialogue, exchanges and cooperation with the people and political parties of other countries.” Just as Xi asserted, “We are eager to draw on the achievements of other cultures and apply them in the Chinese context,” implicit in his statement is an invitation to draw on Chinese achievements and apply them in diverse local contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in 2017, at a Belt and Road conference, Xi put great emphasis on China’s fundamental belief in mutual benefit. Suggesting that the ancient Silk Road was all about reciprocity, Xi noted that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chinese silk, porcelain, lacquerwork and ironware were shipped to the West, while pepper, flax, spices, grape and pomegranate entered China. Through these routes, Buddhism, Islam and Arab astronomy, calendar and medicine found their way to China, while China’s four great inventions [papermaking, printing, gunpowder, and the compass] and silkworm breeding spread to other parts of the world. More importantly, the exchange of goods and know-how spurred new ideas. For example, Buddhism originated in India, blossomed in China and was enriched in Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added, for good measure, “We are ready to share practices of development with other countries, but we have no intention to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs, export our own social system and model of development, or impose our own will on others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Chinese leadership’s rhetorical approach has been that it merely seeks to inculcate respect for difference. For example, Xi noted in his September 2020 speech to the UN General Assembly, “We should respect a country’s independent choice of development path and model. The world is diverse in nature, and we should turn this diversity into a constant source of inspiration driving human advancement.” Yet, Elizabeth Economy suggests that appeals to tolerate diversity soon yielded to a more pointed strategy. In the period after 2017, she argues, “both in rhetoric and reality, China has become increasingly comfortable in its efforts to export its state-centered political and economic model globally.” Noting that China’s efforts have both defensive and offensive motivations, she argues that China is committed to “supporting the creation of laws and regulations that enhance state control, limit individual freedoms, and favor state-led economic development.” It remains unclear “whether China is acting offensively to forge a more illiberal world or defensively to make the world safe for China’s brand of autocracy.” From the perspective of authoritarian regimes in the Middle East, the difference is not especially relevant. The Chinese approach legitimizes their resistance to calls for democratization and human rights, providing living proof that there are multiple paths to combining economic growth with social peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle Eastern assessments of China’s approach have been overwhelmingly positive. Writing in the widely circulated, Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat, a Lebanese professor lamented, “It is our misfortune that we know nothing of China except its products.” She made clear that China has experienced many of the same “declines and failures” as the Arab world, yet Arabs are disinterested in how it has triumphed. After a visit to China, one Arab journalist was smitten: “May God help us for our lack of planning and our inability to see the future, which is either the scourge that hinders the progress of nations, as in our case, or the reason for advancement and progress, which is the Chinese case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government’s recent soft-power efforts that build on the idea of a China model are distinct from its soft-power efforts in the past. China has maintained bilateral ties with developing countries — and especially with former revolutionary states such as Algeria — for decades. China was the first non-Arab state to recognize Algeria’s National Liberation Front government in 1958 when it was fighting for independence from France, and after independence was won in 1962, China provided a range of material support: wheat, steel, school equipment, a 13,000-ton freighter, and four transport aircraft. China also dispatched a medical team and supplies and extended a low-interest loan. China began sending medical teams to Algeria in 1963 and has sent more than 2,000 in total. China has also sent more than 2,000 medical personnel to Yemen, and 60 Chinese workers lost their lives between 1959 and 1962 building a mountainous road from what is now the Yemeni capital of Sanaa to the port of Hodeidah. All of those efforts were very much on the government-to-government level, reflecting a sensitivity in China — shared in much of the Arab world — toward foreign governments that seek to go over the heads of local governments to speak with their people. Throughout the twentieth century, China was seeking diplomatic recognition and bilateral partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the twenty-first century dawned and China grew more self-confident, its efforts to seduce foreign governments were accompanied by increasingly active efforts to seduce foreign publics. Joseph Fewsmith has argued that Pan Wei at Beijing University sought to popularize the idea of a China model in the early 2000s. Nobel Prize-winning author Naguib Mahfouz argued in 2002 that Arab societies should diversify what they borrow from abroad to include lessons from China, as China’s historical and social traditions more closely resemble the Middle East than the West. An Emirati scholar of China wrote in 2008 that the China model proves “there is another pathway for governments of the world to follow in order to successfully pursue economic growth.” While 500 articles with the phrase China model in the title could be found on the internet in 2007, there were 750 in 2008 and fully 3,000 in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One proximate cause for the popularization of the idea was the 2007–09 Global Financial Crisis, which Chinese officials saw as an opportunity to stress Chinese resilience. Another was a multi-billion-dollar soft-power push by the Chinese government that followed the Beijing Olympics. As Willy Lam noted, “the Hu leadership is convinced that the sorry state of the American model has thrown into sharp relief the superiority of the Chinese way of doing things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study of China’s soft-power efforts succinctly summarizes the “China brand” in the Middle East as resting on three principles: “1) The nation’s impressive economic rise, 2) China’s interest in becoming an economic rather than security partner to the region, and 3) China’s continued and evolving status as a developing nation, as a peer — rather than a superior — to Middle Eastern nations.” The authors suggest that the goal is not to inspire imitation, but rather to “promote local acceptance of the growing Chinese commercial, diplomatic, and expatriate presence in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, Africa has been on the front line of Chinese efforts to revise their global engagement strategy. Africa is the source of key natural resources necessary for Chinese (and global) economic development, making it a logical focus for Chinese attention. Equally important, Africa has not been a major focus of other great powers’ efforts, giving China a relatively unencumbered path to continental influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many African elites have been receptive to China, not entirely because of Chinese efforts, but also out of frustration with a Western focus on human rights, democratization, and governance. For instance, the former president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, started questioning the sincerity of the West and its democracy promotion when the European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on the country because of his regime’s human rights abuses. It is only then that he launched the Look East Policy and cultivated stronger diplomatic relations with China. The driving force for Mugabe was the need for an alternative development partner and source for diplomatic support, foreign direct investment, and development financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2017 McKinsey report noted that Africa-China trade had grown approximately 20 percent per year since 2000 and was almost four times U.S.-Africa trade. Yet, despite the fact that Chinese investment was growing 40 percent year-on-year in the mid-2010s, China’s foreign direct investment in Africa remained less than half that of the United States. Where China excelled was in the financing of African infrastructure. There, China’s 2015 commitments were $21 billion, exceeding the combined total of the African Development Bank, European Commission, European Investment Bank, International Finance Corporation, World Bank, and G8 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s approach to Africa was broadly consistent with its approach to Asia, which took off after the 2013 announcement of the Belt and Road Initiative. The initiative, which stresses the importance of infrastructure construction and trade, is centered around a wide array of loans to finance work by Chinese companies. Completely enwrapped in Chinese promises of “win-win solutions,” and accompanied by a conviction that Chinese attention would grow, Asian governments — including West Asian governments — were intrigued by the prospects of deep partnership with a rising power. Yet, some of those governments came to decide that the terms of Chinese partnership were badly skewed in China’s favor, requiring the “surrender to Chinese management the entire strategic infrastructure of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the loans plummeted after 2017, both in size and number. According to a project at Boston University, the average Chinese loan commitment between 2018 and 2021 was 70 percent of the average loan between 2013 and 2017, and the average size of area-based projects was just 18 percent of the size of projects from the earlier period. While some ascribed the change to a decline in China’s diminishing current account surplus, the diminishing emphasis on Belt and Road projects may more clearly reflect a conclusion that they are more problematic than anticipated and that success is harder to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is emerging, then, is a pattern of both U.S. and Chinese behavior that is broadly similar throughout the world. While not always expressed in stark terms, the struggle to inspire imitation — or at least to blunt the inspirational power of an adversary — has grown increasingly important as the U.S. and Chinese governments have approached the Middle East. The United States has long sought to spread a model of development that encourages the proliferation of liberal systems (in the classical sense), with free market economies and civil liberties. China has increasingly seen such efforts as a self-interested U.S. effort to constrain competitors and adversaries and to delegitimize their accomplishments. As a consequence, Chinese officials increasingly portray their own successes as disproving the premises of the U.S. model, not merely for China, but for other countries that seek to inspire similarly sharp increases in economic performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-china-competition&quot;&gt;U.S.-China Competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rise, and what many Chinese scholars describe as U.S. decline, has spurred a global Sino-American competition for power and influence. Third countries’ perspectives are often left out of U.S. discussions of this competition. Many Middle Eastern officials are quick to tell U.S. audiences that they fear becoming collateral damage in superpower conflict. A senior Gulf minister visiting Washington in 2021 viewed the rising great power competition and cited the proverb, “When the elephants fight, it is the ants who get killed.” Yet, at the same time, many of those same countries welcome the mere idea of competition. They do so partly because they see it helping them accrue leverage to deploy against the United States and China, and partly because they see it curtailing what they believe to be the excesses of U.S. hegemony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to define China’s global ambitions, as well as to discern how its actions advance them, are increasingly fraught. In the last five years, Western analysis has sharply diverged. For some longtime analysts of China, there is nothing especially unique about Chinese behavior. As a former U.S. national intelligence officer for East Asia put it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China is making a bid for strategic influence, economic and technological advantage, international respect, freedom of action, and accommodation of its interests — all in areas where the United States has long enjoyed preeminent power and influence, and is not inclined to concede it. But China is making this bid on the basis of reasonable great power aspirations, some valid historical grievances, considerable resources, growing confidence, a readiness to compete globally — and, it should be noted, a genuine interest in constructive and cooperative relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proper response to China’s rise, in this account, is a certain degree of empathy and understanding, and a fair amount of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others take the opposite tack. In some of the harsher articulations, “We are now in an existential struggle with China,” and “Beijing’s goal is a world without America.” In this view, the United States and China are not merely competing, but locked in a zero-sum conflict. China’s victory would not only be devastating for U.S. interests — China’s victory actually requires devastating U.S. interests. By these lights, the only responsible strategy to pursue is to seek China’s defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate about Chinese intentions does not occur in a vacuum. It is accompanied by an increasingly robust domestic U.S. debate over the country’s proper role in the world and the breadth of its international ambitions. Amid a sharp rise in policy circles’ talk about “restraint” and questions about both the wisdom and capacity of the country to advance maximalist goals overseas in the wake of long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, some argue that the United States must be more mindful of its limits as it constructs its China policy. At one side of that spectrum, some analysts suggest that any U.S. effort to pressure China must necessarily be “accompanied by an equally robust path for mutual adjustment, cooperation, and shared achievement.” At the other side of the spectrum, analysts stress a need for “a steady state of clear-eyed coexistence on terms favorable to U.S. interests and values.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite differences, it is clear that U.S. views on China are hardening across the U.S. political spectrum. Chinese actions at home and abroad alarm Americans for a host of reasons, and Congress’s focus on the need to meet threats from China enjoys deep bipartisan consensus. Even so, there is rising alarm in some parts of the China expert community in the United States that the way the United States is approaching challenges from China is self-defeating. Describing the first meeting of the congressional Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, Jude Blanchette complained, “If you were an alien and you tuned into this, you would think the United States is a pathetic, weak, scared nation, which is being beset by an omnicompetent, omnipresent enemy of just galactic proportions in terms of its capabilities. . . . If we continue to follow the playbook outlined at that committee, it will lead to . . . tragedy and devastation and extraordinary amounts of waste.” Former State Department policy planning staff member Jessica Chen Weiss worried that a U.S. determination to compete with China at all costs pushes the United States to be reactive, to operate without any sense of priorities, and to drive conflict. And former Bush administration official Evan Feigenbaum cautioned five years ago that a U.S. approach premised on the idea that China was seeking to subvert the U.S.-led order misses the much subtler but important threat that China was seeking to infiltrate that order to bend it to be more responsive to Chinese preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;liberalism-vs-authoritarianism&quot;&gt;Liberalism vs. Authoritarianism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is abundantly clear is that China and the United States have been pursuing radically different agendas in the Middle East for three-quarters of a century and achieving different results. Referring principally to the Middle East, Indian minister of external affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar observed in 2020, “For two decades, China has been winning without fighting, while the US was fighting without winning.” The United States maintains a robust military footprint and asserts itself as the protector of partners against external aggression, while China has pursued efforts to be a commercial partner to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Jaishankar’s analysis downplays the interaction of those two trends. That is to say, China benefitted for decades from the U.S. Navy’s efforts to secure freedom of navigation for Gulf energy, as well as from U.S. actions that undermined terrorist networks’ efforts to attack infrastructure, topple governments, and undermine trade. China benefitted, too, from the efforts of U.S.-backed international financial institutions to grow the economies of Middle Eastern states, and from the efforts of generations of Western energy executives to identify and develop the Middle East’s energy infrastructure. A half-century of U.S. efforts to create a Middle Eastern bulwark against Soviet aggression in the Cold War helped ensure that the region had strong national governments with which China could seek bilateral relations. Ironically, it was a half-century of the United States pressing regional governments on governance issues that helped prime regional governments to be open to Chinese engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially after the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011, Middle Eastern authoritarians came to appreciate China’s resolute noninterference in the domestic affairs of its partners, which stood in stark contrast to the U.S. approach. As the United States used force to seek political change in the region, and as U.S. diplomats worked to more tightly intertwine U.S. engagement, economic partnerships, and political liberalization, China promised a radically different path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many in the U.S. foreign policy community, the U.S. insistence on pushing for better governance is a key instrument of national power. As Hal Brands wrote in Survival, “The chief defender of the existing international order is a liberal democracy that has traditionally sought to shape the global environment in accordance with its ideological values as well as its strategic interests. The leading revisionists are autocracies that practice a distinctly authoritarian version of capitalism and see the advance of liberal ideals as an existential threat to their legitimacy and power.” This is different from the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, in which each side competed to spread its ideology. In the current ideological contest, China is not seeking to promote its own ideology or any other. Instead, it simply seeks to undermine an opposing one. Brands sees authoritarians’ fundamental goal to be an effort to vest authority in a “small elite headed by a paramount leader.” Repression and coercion provide a semblance of legitimacy. These tools replace the elections, accountability, and rule of law that secure liberal democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen this way, authoritarianism broadly challenges a liberal world order, but liberalism is a much more acute threat to authoritarian rule. Liberal states were born amid authoritarian peers, and it is relatively rare that liberal states slide into authoritarianism. Authoritarianism, after all, is not a model that appeals widely in most democracies. Yet a democratic wave would pose a profound challenge to governance models in authoritarian states. The fundamental question for authoritarian leaders is whether liberal democracies are an attractive model to their own populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the Cold War and its immediate aftermath, the United States and many of its allies considered the answer to that question to be obvious. Francis Fukuyama’s seminal 1989 article in the National Interest, “The End of History?” marked Americans’ rising enthusiasm for the universal attractiveness of the liberal model. U.S. policymakers took the almost immediate crumbling of Soviet client states in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the relatively rapid rise of more liberal and democratic governments on the ashes of four decades of communism, as confirmation that liberal ideals were both attractive and viable even in distant regions of the world. Central to the U.S. strategic approach to Iraq after 2001 was confidence that once the country was stripped of its Ba’athist authoritarian veneer, Iraqis would embrace liberalism and democracy just as Poles, Czechs, and Albanians had done in the 1990s. Central to the U.S. approach to the 2011 Arab Spring was a quiet confidence not only that positive outcomes were likely, but that the end of authoritarian regimes was to be celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious extension of this issue is whether the U.S. government’s almost evangelical approach to promoting global liberalism is intended principally as a way to advance its own interests through promoting global stability, or rather to undermine China’s interests by constraining and inhibiting the country’s global ties. Seen another way, and perhaps from a Chinese perspective, the question is whether the United States is a fundamentally conservative or revisionist power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one of China’s leading strategic thinkers, Wang Jisi, the official view is clear: “In Chinese eyes, the most significant threat to China’s sovereignty and national security has long been U.S. interference in its internal affairs aimed at changing the country’s political system and undermining the CCP.” He adds that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beijing believes that Washington was the driving force behind the “color revolutions” that took place in the first decade of this century in former Soviet states and that the U.S. government has ginned up protest movements against authoritarian regimes around the world, including the Arab revolts of 2010–11. The CCP believes that those alleged U.S. interventions will supply a blueprint for Washington to undermine and eventually topple the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s response, then, is to portray the United States as a power that is both hegemonic and homogenizing, imposing not only its own political model, but also social and cultural mores premised on the American experience and beliefs. Seen this way, the United States sweeps away local existing power structures to empower U.S. agents who will contort societies to grow U.S. wealth and power at the expense of local interests. China’s growing focus on “South-South” relations seeks to sharpen attacks on the U.S. approach and build solidarity broadly with countries in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-modesty&quot;&gt;China’s Modesty&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China crafts a very different self-image. It portrays itself as approaching difference with respect and humility. China’s five principles for peaceful coexistence — mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other’s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence — were first promulgated in 1954, but they have been playing an increasingly prominent role in Chinese rhetoric because they serve so effectively to contrast with the U.S. approach. One could argue, for example, that U.S. policy in the Middle East for the last two decades has been a refutation of each and every one of those five principles. In the face of the quite mixed, and often negative, consequences of U.S. actions, China’s strategy is to embolden objections to the U.S. approach rather than to promulgate discrete alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is scrupulous not to criticize any of its non-Western partners publicly, and it pushes its non-Western partners to reciprocate (which they do with a startling and almost uniform silence on the conditions of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang). This, too, appeals to Middle Eastern governments because it enhances their domestic legitimacy. Their apparent embrace by what is not merely a global superpower, but also a rising force in the Middle East with an impressive record of its own economic growth, creates a halo of competence and effectiveness around Middle Eastern rulers. As Middle Eastern governments weather criticisms, conditionality, and condemnation from Western governments, China provides a reputational refuge, not to mention significant opportunities for bilateral cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;APPLICABILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genuine applicability of any sort of China model to modern Middle Eastern states is unclear. Regional states are starting from a different place than China did, and they are likely headed for a different place as well. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, for example, have relatively few people but rich mineral resources. Their economies thrive on imported labor, and industrialization is scarce (and industrial work by nationals, or even any private sector employment by nationals, is scarcer still). Their economies are profoundly cyclical, tied to the price of hydrocarbons. For example, Saudi GDP grew 11.2 percent in 2003, contracted 2.1 percent in 2009, and grew 11.0 percent in 2011. Saudi Arabia’s economic volatility is even greater if one goes further back in time: the country’s GDP grew 58.6 percent in 1970 and fell 20.7 percent in 1982. Although all of the GCC economies are eager to diversify from energy exports, those exports remain the engine of the economy, and they will remain so for years into the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment for Gulf nationals skews heavily toward government jobs, where productivity is hard to measure, unlike the factories employing rural migrants that were the engine of China’s economic miracle. Foreigners continue to provide most of the services in the Gulf’s service-oriented economies, and while some of their earnings stay in the country to pay for things such as housing, much of it is repatriated to their countries of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other countries, such as Egypt, have more similar economies. While Egypt’s 100 million people have been urbanizing for more than a century, agriculture remains a key component of employment. The World Bank estimates that 21 percent of Egyptians worked in agriculture in 2019, versus 25 percent of Chinese, and identical percentages (27 percent) in the two countries were engaged in industrial employment. As with China, state-owned enterprises constitute an important part of the industrial base. Also similar to China, Egypt has a sprawling military-industrial complex, although in the Egyptian case, the military’s economic interests dip deeply into normally civilian activities such as bottled water, gas station convenience stores, and cement manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian military’s role in the economy, combined with what many political economists describe as a system of crony capitalism in Egypt, may be partly responsible for major differences in economic outcomes. Egypt’s economic liberalization has provided outsized benefits to individuals and families close to the government, and those advantages have often spanned generations. While that may be considered analogous to the benefits accruing to members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), there is less evidence that Egypt’s political insider communities were nearly as meritocratic as their Chinese counterparts, or that the rotation of elites has been nearly as frequent. The current Egyptian government is the descendant of secret political cliques within the Egyptian military that overthrew the monarchy in 1952. The pervasiveness of military networks, and the taboo against discussing the Egyptian military’s economic activities in public, undermines scrutiny and accountability. When Hisham Geneina, the head of Egypt’s Central Auditing Organization, charged in 2016 that corruption was rife in several of Egypt’s government institutions, especially related to real estate development, he was fired. Convicted of “insulting the army” for threatening to reveal clear evidence of malfeasance, he was imprisoned by a military court for five years, only to be released and charged in civilian court for “joining a terrorist group and spreading false news.” The new charge makes the former auditor subject to immediate arrest at any time. While China has had its share of corruption scandals — not least the rise and precipitous fall in 2012 of Bo Xilai, who was the CCP party secretary in Chongqing — China after Deng Xiaoping has avoided fashioning ossified economic elites who remain in power for decades and generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the lessons that China might offer to Middle Eastern governments are less important than a vague idea that it has lessons. China’s remarkable economic growth, begun under Deng and continuing for more than four decades, remade the global economy. Although China’s record of double-digit GDP growth, particularly in the late 1990s and early 2000s, will not return, bringing 800 million people out of poverty remains an enduring accomplishment. Similarly, China has managed a tremendous amount of economic and social change with relatively little political disruption. China shifted from a country where fewer than one in five Chinese were urban in 1979 to two in three today, accompanied by the creation of a massive, literate, and consumption-oriented middle class that is the country’s economic driver. Throughout, the CCP has maintained control over public life and sustained its coherence and solidarity. The ability to do so in the face of such extraordinary material, social, and demographic change is not an obvious outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-courtship-of-the-global-south&quot;&gt;China’s Courtship of the Global South&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has used its twentieth-century experiences to deepen its ties with billions of people around the world. The country tells billions that it shares their grievances and feels a strong sense of solidarity with them. Since the 1970s, China has emphasized the need to create a “just and equitable new political and economic order” by addressing “economic and political inequalities between the developing world and the developed world, between the Global South and the Global North.” Despite a sharp rise in income, especially in the last two decades, China has resolutely defended its developing country status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this, China continues a version of Mao’s 1950s strategy to support revolutionary movements against imperial powers. As European empires fell, local leaders arose who harbored a sense of grievance, injustice, and disempowerment. After more than a half-century, these countries’ leaderships continue to highlight legacies of exploitation and submission to explain their contemporary problems, and the Chinese leadership — drawing on China’s history — asserts its strong identification with the oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China promotes the idea that there is a coherent entity of disenfranchised states that can be termed the Global South and strives to be perceived as a leader of it. Doing so boosts China through building solidarity with governments and populations that feel persistently marginalized in terms of power, influence, money, and respect. China has artfully positioned itself as both a status quo power that supports the self-determination and sovereignty of local governments and a revisionist power that seeks to reform international relations to enhance the role of countries that aspire to a greater voice in global affairs. China portrays this in explicit contrast to the United States, arguing that the United States seeks to force its ideas of domestic reform on sovereign governments while maintaining unjust influence for itself and its allies, who continue to benefit from the power they enjoyed 75 years ago when the UN system was established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China approaches Arab states with avowed humility and modesty. The tone is well articulated in its 2016 “Arab Policy Paper,” the first six paragraphs of which celebrate two millennia of consistently aligned objectives between China and Arab states, from “sovereignty and territorial integrity” to “the establishment of the friendly and cooperative relationship oriented toward the 21st century.” An early paragraph contains the sentence, “China will continue to uphold the banner of peace, development and win-win cooperation, be committed to peaceful development, pursue a win-win strategy of opening up and promote the formation of a new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation.” In fact, the phrase “win-win” appears 11 times in the document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embedded in more than 4,800 words are a slew of Chinese commitments: to expand official and unofficial exchanges, to boost trade and investment, to strengthen civilian nuclear cooperation, and to deepen military and counterterrorism cooperation, health care exchanges, and many other efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the single obligation imposed on the Arab side is an oblique one. The document observes that the Taiwan question “concerns the core interests of China” and that Arab states and organizations have “refrained from having any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan.” For this, China expresses its appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-studies&quot;&gt;Case Studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many countries, China’s approach to foreign policy emphasizes bilateral relations between states rather than with multilateral regional organizations. The Middle East has at least two relatively robust multilateral groupings — the League of Arab States and the Gulf Cooperation Council — but China has put its Middle East emphasis on five states: Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Iran, and Algeria. With each of these, China in the last decade has proclaimed a “comprehensive strategic relationship,” although regional foreign ministers sometimes chuckle and say they do not quite understand what that actually means. Yet, by setting a public set of priority countries, China has helped to signal to these countries and to the world where it seeks to focus its energies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;egypt&quot;&gt;Egypt&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the country that feels most in need of a Chinese embrace is Egypt, which has been casting about vigorously for a strategic reset for most of the last 150 years. Egypt’s first brush with ambitious economic and social development nearly bankrupted the country in the mid-nineteenth century. Under Khedive Ismail Pasha, the government borrowed tens of millions of pounds, mostly from Great Britain and France, to construct the Suez Canal, build out transportation and irrigation, and grow the industrial base. When European lenders grew concerned at what they saw as the khedive’s profligacy, they seized control of Egypt’s finances, and when army officers revolted over the Europeans’ control, the Europeans pressed the Ottomans (who had nominal control of Egypt and were facing their own profound problems) to install a khedive who would be more accommodating of Great Britain’s efforts to secure its debts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egypt gained greater independence from Britain after World War II, and especially after Gamal Abdel Nasser led a 1952 coup that overthrew the Egyptian monarchy. Abdel Nasser initially seemed inclined to explore a range of economic development models, pursuing aggressive land reform on the backs of the nobility and seeking to drive industrialization by making land speculation less attractive. Ultimately, however, Abdel Nasser’s was a military regime that favored a command economy and state-led industrialization over invigorating the private sector. A tentative U.S. effort at land reclamation and resettlement in Egypt in the mid-1950s sought to promote freehold farmers, cooperative extension, and local self-rule in a project called the Egyptian American Rural Improvement Service. The military’s preferred option was “Liberation Province,” a regimented land reclamation effort that brought peasants into labor on collective plots in work shirts color coded according to their area of specialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Suez Canal crisis in 1956, Egypt turned more sharply toward the Eastern Bloc and embraced what it called “Arab socialism.” The country’s economic strategy was more statist than Marxist, and it seemed guided more by a desire to eviscerate the wealth of the regime’s potential political challengers than an effort to empower the proletariat. The project to construct the High Dam at Aswan brought hundreds of Soviet engineers and construction workers to Egypt, but Soviet economists and theoreticians did not follow. In fact, Egypt’s minister of industry from the mid-1950s, and later deputy prime minister for industry and mineral resources (and prime minister from 1972 to 1973), was Aziz Sidky, whose 1951 Harvard doctoral dissertation was a study of Egypt’s iron and steel industry. While Egypt was broadly committed to import substitution industrialization, Egypt’s industrialization strategy was, in fact, subordinated to its political strategy. The political strategy, in turn, was the product of army officers with long experience in secret organizations. It may, in fact, have owed as much to thousands of Nazis who fled to Cairo after World War II and helped organize the domestic security services as it did to the economic models Egypt was seeking to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Abdel Nasser’s death, Egypt swerved away from Arab socialism, but not completely. Anwar Sadat’s Infitah, or “open door,” created opportunities for the private sector after the 1973 war and the abandonment of Soviet ties in favor of an alignment with the United States. Yet, while the United States poured billions of dollars into Egypt in economic assistance after the Camp David Treaty, and international financial institutions began to engage more deeply with Egypt, the Egyptian system remained a patchwork. The military continued to maintain a privileged position in the economy, and the state maintained a robust system of subsidies and state-owned industries. A pattern of five-year plans begun in the 1960s persisted, as did the focus on import substitution. Public sector employment remained robust. In 1998, after two decades of large-scale U.S. economic assistance to Egypt, 39 percent of the Egyptian workers were either government employees or worked for public enterprises. Egypt was not so much pursuing a development model as it was resisting one. The government consistently sought international support while simultaneously seeking to preserve the status quo to the greatest degree possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While scholars can disagree on the precise cause, and it is an open question whether a clearer development model would have delivered different results, Egypt fared far poorer than many Asian economies that were in similar conditions in the 1950s and 1960s. Egypt’s per capita GDP in 1965 was $161, Thailand’s was $142, and South Korea’s was $109. In 2021, the respective numbers were $3,699, $7,066, and $34,998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egypt pivoted away from the Soviet Union in 1970 and aligned with the United States in the wake of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. The Camp David agreement of 1979 established the promise of $2.1 billion per year in U.S. foreign assistance, partly intended to replace Gulf Arab assistance that all parties believed would be cut after an Egyptian-Israeli agreement. The U.S. assistance — $1.3 billion in military aid and another $800 million in economic help — was significant in 1979. But the Egyptian economy grew, the population grew, and inflation ate away at the value of the assistance. Starting in 1998, and in parallel with a change in U.S. aid to Israel, the United States agreed to reduce economic assistance to Egypt significantly. While the number has fluctuated, in part due to congressional concern about Egyptian human rights conditions, U.S. economic aid to Egypt now stands at approximately $100 million per year for a population of more than 100 million Egyptians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a bilateral perspective, Egyptians came to regard U.S. economic assistance as an entitlement, and it bred Egyptian resentment. In the early 2000s, an Egyptian diplomat at an informal gathering in Washington bristled at proposed legislation that would condition a portion of U.S. assistance on Egyptian human rights performance. “If you want to condition additional assistance on what we do, that’s your money and you can do what you wish. But this is our money,” he complained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USAID has proudly trumpeted its achievements in Egypt over 40 years. U.S. government efforts have helped eliminate polio, lower infant and maternal mortality, improve early literacy, expand telecommunications networks, reduce lead in the air in Cairo, and improve water and wastewater supplies for 25 million Egyptians. Included in the assistance was $1.4 billion to support Egyptian agriculture, including helping farmers buy land, liberalizing markets for fertilizers and seeds, and matching Egyptian farmers with local and international buyers. And yet, Egyptians have long complained that their partnership with the United States has been a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Egyptians seeing persistent poverty around them have argued that a true partnership with a superpower such as the United States would have lifted them to prosperity (as many say the United States has done with Israel, and as others argue the United States has done with South Korea and Japan). They have objected that USAID contracts are designed to support U.S. contractors and not Egyptians. Additionally, Americans have worried that international support for Egyptian projects has actually inhibited Egypt’s development of indigenous capacity to address its development issues. For example, international aid programs have used robust salaries to lure the most capable Egyptian experts out of the Egyptian bureaucracy to implement projects. While that has helped ensure that the projects are successful, it has weakened the Egyptian government’s capacity to carry out other work independently. For these reasons and others, it is not entirely coincidental that Egypt shares a distinction with a number of other long-term recipients of U.S. foreign assistance: rather than creating strong popular support for the United States, the bilateral aid relationship seems to have contributed to strained ties. In 2010, the Pew Research Center polled countries around the world about favorable attitudes toward the United States. Of the 21 countries polled, the lowest ratings (hovering close to 20 percent) were in Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, and Turkey, all significant recipients of U.S. assistance over decades. While U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan may have played a role in dragging numbers downward, one might have thought that decades of partnership might have mitigated some of the frustration. It is also worth noting that U.S. favorability ratings in Lebanon were above 50 percent. Remarkably in light of the current round of great power competition, U.S. favorability ratings in Russia and China were 57 and 58 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Egyptian-Chinese relationship is newer and, at least superficially, more robust. Since first going to China in 2014, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi visited six times in six years and signed at least 25 bilateral agreements. A former Egyptian ambassador to China, now the vice chairman of the Egyptian-Chinese Friendship Association, gushed to the Chinese-published Global Times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Egypt and China enjoy a lot of similarities, that has been so obvious since their two leaders took over as president. They have both almost identical and profound appreciation of world politics. Their mutual understanding got deeper and deeper over the past few years. They met many times and developed mutual understanding, in particular with regard to the priority that should be given to sustainable development in their nations, to the building up of their economies, to striving to aim at raising the standards of living of their people and to the preservation of our two nations’ national security, peace and stability, because any country, if it’s stable and strong from within, no other country could threaten its peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went on to add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The two presidents have the political will to work together to develop further and further their two nations’ bilateral relations, this is beneficial for the two nations and the two peoples. The presidents are willing to work together to further develop Arab-China relations, Africa-China relations, and our mutual relations with other developing nations. Both countries are focused on the idea of creating a joint future because we have a common destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One businessperson who has dealt extensively with China raved about implicit comparisons between China and the United States. “There is no conditionality on financing, and they finance on comfortable terms,” she said. “They provide financing and know-how . . . and they provide long installments with a grace period. It is a less arrogant model, and they are not interfering in politics.” Another businessperson with extensive investments in Egypt’s new capital city complex in the desert east of Cairo also highlighted the financing issue: “The Germans, French, and Chinese are investing with financing on easy terms. The U.S. is letting go and blaming Egypt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, China’s engagement with Egypt has been measured, and China has pulled back when it has judged Egypt to be overreaching. On the New Administrative Capital, for example, Chinese firms originally were slated to play a major role in constructing the government administrative district, but as one senior Egyptian official put it, “It didn’t work for economic and political reasons.” A Chinese colleague commented privately that the dispute was over commercial terms and that “the Egyptians thought they were the only ones who were supposed to make money.” The Chinese focus shifted to building towers only in the central business district, a smaller area for which they have specific technical expertise, some of which the Egyptians hope will be transferred during the construction process. The commonly accepted figure for Chinese investment in the central business district is $3 billion, although the terms of the investment are hard to discern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Suez Canal Zone has become an area of special focus for China. It is one of the few sites in Egypt where the Chinese have made investments, and those investments have yielded returns. A 2002 effort to establish a free zone had weak results, but parliament amended the law in 2015, and the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) expanded its facilities there significantly. Presidents Xi and Sisi inaugurated an expansion of the so-called TEDA-Suez project during Xi’s 2016 state visit to Egypt. The project now occupies an area of more than 7 square kilometers, with a long-term planning area almost three times as large. According to the organization’s website, “It is an industrial project mainly covering processing and manufacturing, logistics, bonded [sic], technology development, commerce and modern services and other major industries, housing, commerce, finance, and other functions.” The area has gymnasiums, libraries, Chinese restaurants, and even a “dinosaur paradise” for recreation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant economic enterprise in the TEDA-Suez zone is a Jushi fiberglass plant, which produces 200,000 tons of fiberglass annually. The plant reportedly employs 2,200 Egyptians, and according to a former Egyptian diplomat, only 14 Chinese workers. Most of the work, however, is done by robots. A 2015 master plan projected for the TEDA-Suez zone to create a million jobs for Egyptians by 2030, but so far, only about 50,000 Egyptian jobs have been created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There often seems to be a gap between the perception of Chinese investment in Egypt, Chinese partnership with Egypt, and the reality. Agreements are struck and heralded, but sometimes projects are quietly shelved without clear explanations of when or why. For example, the Egyptian press widely reported in January 2016 that the Ministry of Transportation had signed a memorandum of understanding with China Railway Construction Corporation for a $3.5 billion project to design, plan, and build Cairo’s sixth metro line, noting that financing was still being negotiated. Eighteen months later, the press reported that Egypt’s National Authority of Tunnels had signed a nonbinding agreement with Quebec-based Bombardier to develop a plan for the sixth metro line and made no reference at all to the prior Chinese agreement. There is no public record of what went wrong with the earlier project or when it foundered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, sustained attention has been paid to the Chinese role in constructing the electrified light rail between Cairo, 10th of Ramadan City, and the New Administrative Capital. The $1.25 billion project, whose first phase is a 66 kilometer line with 11 stations, opened in July 2022, approximately five years after being agreed to. The construction of the railway is an example of China’s ability to build infrastructure more quickly and affordably than Western firms, drawing from China’s extensive domestic experience building railways and helping to drive Egypt’s economic development. Because Egyptians see China as a fellow developing country, there is a tendency to see the railway more as a partnership of equals, with an implicit hope that some of China’s economic magic rubs off on Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Egyptians argue that what attracts them is not so much a Chinese model specifically, but an Asian model more generally. One former diplomat argued, in part, that Asian countries are often willing to embrace “strategic latency” and allow diplomatic processes to unfold over time, without forcing rapid and explicit decisions that can be destabilizing. The explicit example he cited was China’s decision not to take either Hong Kong or Macao by force, but surely the evolution of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as an instrument of consensus building was an element of his thinking. Contrarily, he also admired that “In circles of government, Asia is fascinated by performance, speed, and growth rate.” To accomplish that, he said, “Sometimes you need an iron fist, especially after three to four years of revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might interpret this seeming contradiction — a simultaneous admiration of Chinese patience and impatience — as an embrace of realism, practicality, and outcomes over rigid ideology. Many Egyptians complain that Western efforts to improve systems and transparency are self-interested diktats cloaked in supposedly principled altruism. China makes no such demands and no such pretense, and as with the construction of the light rail line, it gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a line of argument in Egypt that the turn toward a Chinese option is a practical one that has been forced on them. As one businessperson said, “The U.S.-Egypt relationship is in the DNA of Egypt. Egyptian officials hate dealing with the Chinese.” Another said, “We have no hostility to China, but it is not like the American dream.” But however much they might prefer dealing with the United States, Egyptians assess that China is interested in Egypt, and that the United States is not. “The U.S. is letting go and blaming Egypt,” one businessperson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;saudi-arabia&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gulf has a very different attitude toward both the United States and China, in part because the fundamental problem Gulf governments have had for the last half-century or more has been how to spend money rather than how to acquire it. In Saudi Arabia, the discovery of oil in 1938 meant money flowed to lands that had not had a major capital injection for most of human history. Spending only became deliberate when Prince Faisal established control in the early 1960s. When Faisal became king, Saudi Arabia became a more conventional developmental state, adopting a pattern of five-year plans starting in 1970 and quickly becoming more ambitious as energy revenues exploded. Foreign consultants helped some. For example, the California-based Stanford Research Institute helped staff the Central Planning Organization. Even so, as oil revenues grew sharply on a relatively low economic base, there was never much opportunity to develop a robust private sector. This was in part because the state was such an outsized economic actor, and in part because plentiful government employment opportunities made Saudi labor expensive, especially in comparison to expatriates. Saudi Arabia evolved into a system in which a low-wage, high-productivity foreign workforce supported a high-wage, low-productivity native workforce. The private sector, with mostly Saudi owners and foreign workers, focused mostly on traditional sectors such as services, light manufacturing, agriculture, and, importantly, construction for state-funded projects. The Saudi state led the major industrialization efforts, the growth of a petrochemicals industry, and, of course, the upstream oil sector. A sympathetic journal article asserted that Saudi development plans had combined “capitalist and Islamic values” and eschewed the socialist instincts of most five-year plans in the developing world. Yet, although the 1980 five-year plan explicitly endorsed private capital, the state was overwhelmingly the country’s largest employer, and citizens enjoyed a series of social subsidies and benefits that were the envy of any socialist state. From 1980 on, each five-year plan called for reducing the number of expatriate workers and boosting Saudi employment. Each plan failed to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge that has bedeviled Saudi development plans is wild swings in oil revenues. When Saudi Arabia established its first five-year plan, revenues blew past predictions, and expenditures could not keep up. That happened with the second five-year plan as well. By the time the third five-year plan was implemented, prices fell well short of expectations, and they remained relatively low until climbing steadily in 2002 and afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has had persistent difficulty shifting gears to take advantage of oil windfalls. One management consultant told then Saudi minister of labor Ghazi al-Ghosaibi in the early 2000s that economically, Saudi Arabia was “on a path to Mexico, not the U.S.” By 2010, McKinsey published a short paper arguing that Saudi Arabia was “on a path to Pakistan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Saudi Vision 2030 plan, announced in April 2016, is an ambitious effort to completely reframe the Saudi development debate. Designed quickly by leading U.S. strategic consultancies, most prominently McKinsey and the Boston Consulting Group, the plan was an effort to simultaneously recast the kingdom’s future trajectory and legitimate the leadership of Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was elevated to crown prince just over a year after the plan’s introduction. The vision encompasses 13 “vision realization programs,” each of which has its own set of objectives, commitments, and key performance indicators (KPIs). A National Transformation Plan was put in place to address 37 strategic objectives across eight different themes, measured through 92 main KPIs and 224 sub-KPIs implemented through 433 initiatives and projects. As the plan has been implemented, the number of KPIs and sub-KPIs has increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, many Western observers openly wondered how Saudi Arabia could manage economic development without encouraging social and political liberalization. As a reviewer of an account of Saudi economic planning wondered, “How can a population whose majority is conservative and still living in a Medieval time frame accommodate and absorb the technology of the Western world, which is mainly based on a liberal and material background?” In the four decades since, Saudi Arabia has provided an answer to that question. For several decades, it aggressively coopted most potential domestic opposition and paid particular attention to pursuing a symbiotic relationship with the clerical establishment, which legitimated the ruling family’s patrimony. Under the Vision 2030 plan, the country has pursued an aggressive plan of social liberalization (or, perhaps more accurately, a strategy to “coerce tolerance”) that promotes many forms of social and economic liberalization while becoming even more sensitive to expressions of political liberalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-uae&quot;&gt;The UAE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE is a more heterogeneous state than either Saudi Arabia or Egypt, and its development spurt happened relatively later. Not only was oil not discovered until the 1960s (and the state itself was not formed until 1971), but emirates such as Dubai and Sharjah had histories of trade and commerce long before Abu Dhabi became a global oil giant and the country’s economic driver. Baked into the agreement forming the UAE was a relatively weak federal government and significant local autonomy. A symbiotic relationship developed between Abu Dhabi and Dubai in particular, where Abu Dhabi acted as a frequent financier for Dubai, and many of the oil operators found an entrepot such as Dubai a more hospitable base than the relatively underdeveloped and relatively more parochial Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before statehood, the emirates that became the UAE formed Trucial Oman under British protection. By most accounts, local rulers lamented Britain’s 1971 departure. This may be in part because a pattern of British payments to local rulers throughout the early twentieth century gave the rulers dominion over local commercial families, creating a pattern of patrimonialism in the UAE that persists to the present. Regardless, British technical advisers were present throughout the emirates, and a British consulting firm helped guide the plan to dredge Dubai Creek that began in 1959, which laid the groundwork for Dubai’s spectacular economic growth in the decades since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the British left reluctantly, and because the Emiratis were, for the most part, sorry to see them go, the UAE economy grew amid a robust pattern of partnership with Western development experts. Such experts helped advise on the creation of a currency board in 1973 and on the creation of a central bank in 1980. Revenues quickly outstripped the federal government’s ability to spend them, but the government sought to develop infrastructure rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one author wrote, it is clear why the UAE had no overall development strategy in the early years of statehood: the Emirates “were in need of practically every amenity, and therefore, everything had to be done very quickly.” Yet, individual emirates were each pursuing development independently of each other, often replicating each other’s efforts. Each emirate built its own cement plant, and four different emirates raced to build their own international airports. The Ministry of Planning conceived of a five-year plan to begin in 1981, but it lacked the authority to enforce its will nationwide, and it proved ineffective even in communicating with local development planners, let alone coordinating with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of central control, or perhaps because of it, the UAE developed robustly by its own lights. Arguably, this diversity of approach and hunger for results resembled the multiple strategies China pursued in the 1990s. Dubai in particular developed a reputation for urgency and ambition, which in recent decades Abu Dhabi has sought to match. The state — in this case meaning both the federal government and the governments of individual emirates — remains the key driver of economic decisionmaking, which it maintains through state-owned conglomerates such as Dubai World, Dubai Holdings, and a government-controlled property development firm named Emaar. Dubai has an “Executive Office” (and Abu Dhabi has an Executive Affairs Authority) that allows rulers to mesh their governmental and economic roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore has been a particular Emirati inspiration for almost 30 years. One of the most prominent developers in the UAE, Mohammed al-Abbar, was posted in Singapore from 1987 to 1992 as the representative of Khaleej Capital. When he returned to Dubai, he spent five years creating the Department of Economic Development. Based in part on his Singapore experience, al-Abbar wrote Dubai’s first 10-year strategic plan as the emirate began to diversify into transport, real estate, logistics, and tourism. The first Singaporean ambassador resident in the UAE judged that Emiratis were attracted by Singapore’s “stability, one-party rule, and economic dynamism,” and while Dubai was the first emirate to send delegations to understand what made Singapore tick, Abu Dhabi was not far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Saudi Arabia, the UAE maintains a deeply patrimonial system with an antipathy to anything that reeks of political opposition. The UAE has a nod to political participation with a partially elected Federal National Council, although the rulers of each emirate select electors. For all of its embrace of change and swiftness, the UAE has been on its current development path for decades, explicitly welcoming foreigners’ deep engagement in the Emirati economy and embracing an internally heterogeneous approach that seems to reward experimentation. By contrast, Saudi Arabia’s current approach represents a much more sudden break from the past. Until recently, the country had a strong emphasis on homogeneity, presumably as a mechanism to manage social and economic change. If the UAE sought inspiration from Singapore, Saudi Arabia seems belatedly to have found inspiration — and rivalry — in the neighboring UAE. That rivalry is not always friendly, and its stakes are clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gulf-attitudes-toward-the-united-states-and-china&quot;&gt;Gulf Attitudes toward the United States and China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gulf’s economic growth has been intimately tied to the price of oil. Much of the region was deeply impoverished in the interwar years, and it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that oil production made a meaningful difference in the lives of most Gulf Arabs. During that period, teachers, lawyers, physicians, and professionals from Egypt and the Levant were the bridge between Gulf governments and the world’s developed economies. An even more fundamental change occurred after oil prices shot up after 1973. Massive infrastructure projects, a flood of workers from South and Southeast Asia, and large teams of Western professionals rendered most of the region’s cities unrecognizable, and a spike in Gulf Arab students training in Western universities laid the foundation for a much different future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of the oil boom, the whole notion of economic development in the Gulf took on a different coloration than for a country such as Egypt. The region was not ideologically attracted to socialism — indeed, the Gulf monarchies had a strong aversion to Gamal Abdel Nasser and his Arab socialism project — but it essentially set up socialist systems funded by oil revenues. Almost all citizens were quickly brought out of poverty, often on the backs of nonnational workers who labored in poverty. Guaranteed government jobs, free education and health care, and subsidized utilities were all part of the ruling bargain for citizens, and still, there was plenty of money to spare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resultant economic systems blended capitalism and socialism in ways that had few antecedents in either the United States or China. Politically and socially, the tribal, clan, and family systems of the Gulf increasingly had to cope with the cosmopolitan demands of fast-growing cities, mobility, and generational change. Here, too, there was not an obvious direction in which they might adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some, economic development called for more democratic, or at least more liberal, systems. To these people, the dynamism of the modern world was synonymous with greater individualism, which in turn would encourage excellence and intellectual independence. The so-called “Red Prince” of Saudi Arabia, Talal bin Abdulaziz, went into exile for several years in the early 1960s for his embrace of such reforms, and he was merely one example of the region’s liberalizing current. Kuwait first established a legislature in 1938 as a way for merchants to ensure that the ruler was sharing oil revenues with the population. Although it was soon dissolved, it has proven mostly durable since its reestablishment in 1963.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, more democratic systems have not always correlated with liberalization. The advent of democratic politics in Kuwait, for example, has had the paradoxical effect of nurturing tribal politics. Tribes organize to ensure their representation in parliament, and then they use that representation to maximize their share of state benefits. Rather than push individualism, Kuwaiti elections have spurred collective consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of Gulf rulers, collective consciousness is not a bad thing as long as the leaders of the collectivities respect the leadership’s rule. Indeed, it is easier to manage individuals when that management can be delegated to a small number of subnational authorities who can both reward compliance and punish deviance. Gulf governments have not embraced systems of large domestic security forces with widely placed informants, as countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Iraq pursued in the 1960s and beyond. Rather, the networks of affiliation that pervade Gulf societies serve to reinforce loyalty and obedience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has quietly pushed for greater democratization in the Gulf. It worked to ensure that Kuwait reinstated its parliament after the U.S. liberation in 1991, and it encouraged Saudi efforts to strengthen its advisory legislature, the Shura Council, and sought to bolster municipality elections in 2015. For the most part, U.S. diplomats have recognized that their ability to push Gulf partners to adopt open election systems is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, U.S. officials have relied on a more indirect tool. For more than three-quarters of a century, the United States (and to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom) has been the aspirational educational target for Gulf elites. As a destination for students, the trickle turned into a flood as oil wealth spilled into the Gulf in the 1970s. Numbers shot up again after 9/11, when the King Abdullah Scholarship Program sent more than 100,000 Saudis to the United States to study. In the last two decades, U.S. universities have arisen throughout the Gulf, in some cases as branches of U.S. campuses and in others as independent institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political and social impact of U.S.-style education — obtained both at home and abroad — is debated in the region. To some, the exposure to cosmopolitanism imbued by the 600,000 Saudis that have studied abroad necessarily has seeped back into the country. Whether it is encountering unfamiliar ideas, being pushed toward independent thought, or being exposed to women who live unencumbered by the desires of their male relatives, education forces Saudis to navigate profoundly different cultural environments for extended periods. In addition, Gulf students have built their English language skills as part of their education, not only to attend international schools, but increasingly to attend national universities in places such as the UAE and Qatar. With the expansion of the internet and social media in the last two decades, intimate awareness of Western societies has increased markedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many in the Gulf consider this to be a mixed blessing. While they find much to admire in the West, they also find a great deal that is unattractive. They are quick to raise not only the problems in the West such as poverty, crime, and drug abuse, but also a social code that seeks to make room for protecting blasphemy, disrespecting parents, and condoning homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For governments in the region that seek to rule through what they say is a benign authoritarianism, they argue that liberalism would open the door not only to what they see as the social ills of the West, but also a conservative reaction by extremists that would undermine necessary progress. That is to say, they insist that governments must play a central role in managing contestation in society, and more open politics would only drive polarization and hostility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is here that the Chinese model of government management of the confluence of economic, social, and political change becomes attractive. As a former U.S. diplomat with extensive Middle East experience said of the current president of the UAE, Mohammed bin Zayed, “he wanted to develop a benevolent autocracy. He thought that vision plus resources plus grip would equal success.” One Kuwaiti investor said, “Our experience with democracy is not so constructive. Many people think, stupidly, it is what is holding the country back, rather than incompetent government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one UAE-based think tank scholar put it, “The UAE is asked to be apologetic for lots of stuff, especially its political system. . . . The China model achieved success. They are doing more than any Third World democratic country. They created a parallel model. We don’t need to apologize anymore.” This scholar continued, “We have an Islamic background, so family is first. But in civilization we are closer to the West because Islam is an Abrahamic religion. Even so, the radical individualism of the West is sometimes offensive. For example, the right to decide gender doesn’t resonate with our sense of the boundaries of individualism.” Another UAE-based scholar asked, “Who comes first, the individual or society?” He suggested that democracy was one way of improving governance, but that improved governance without democracy also represents an attractive path forward. As he put it, “China is making people think we have another choice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A senior Arab League official made a similar point. He argued that there is a sense of revelation that comes from Chinese success: “They did a miracle. The West said it wasn’t possible. If you want economic progress, there is one way forward, and that requires liberalization and democratization.” China refutes that premise, and from an economic point of view, China can represent a more conservative bet. The Arab League official argued that “the China model has continuity. The democratic model has disruptions all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Gulf understandings of the Chinese political economy are almost entirely impressionistic. There is no literature in Arabic on China’s economic and political development, aside from a few newspaper columns. Academic articles about China’s role in the region rely almost entirely on secondary English-language sources rather than Arabic or Chinese material or primary documents. There is no community of elite Gulf businesspeople who have lived in China and can act as a bridge. Similarly, there is no community of Chinese living in the Gulf who mix easily with their Arab counterparts. On the popular level, Chinese goods are widely thought to be of inferior quality, and Chinese construction is below the standard of Western or Northeast Asian firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-chinese-parallel&quot;&gt;The Chinese Parallel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there remains a cultural fascination with China among Gulf rulers that manifests itself in intriguing ways. In Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Culture sponsored the first Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale from December 2021 to March 2022. The town is especially significant among the country’s current leadership. It was the birthplace of the Saudi state in the eighteenth century, and it is now the target of a $63 billion development giga-project funded by the Public Investment Fund, which is closely associated with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show’s curator, Philip Tinari, curates China’s leading contemporary art museum and is based in Beijing. The show’s title was “Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones.” A display at the exhibit explained that the expression became common in the 1980s in China to refer “to strategies for implementing and adapting to the massive economic and cultural transformations that were then taking place. Saudi Arabia finds itself today in a similar moment of optimistic energy, willingness to ask questions, and openness to new futures.” A further display panel explained, “Moments of rupture, such as we have experienced recently around the world, are those most likely to unleash new waves of retroactive understanding and codification, as well as of reassessment of earlier orthodoxies. The past might be best understood not as a source of immutable tradition, but as an unstable function of the present.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to imagine a clearer invocation of the applicability of China’s modernization experience in the 1980s to what Saudi Arabia is experiencing now. China went through a wrenching social and economic transformation as brutal experiments in collective farming were abandoned, cities exploded in size and complexity, and room was made for private enterprise. Political elites were purged, many of whom had purged their predecessors not so long before. Iron-clad ideological principles were abandoned, and new ones were adopted. It led to world-beating growth in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vision 2030 process in Saudi Arabia envisions a similarly dramatic shift. For many decades, prayer times shaped the rhythm of daily life in Saudi Arabia. The government dominated the economy in every way and employed most Saudi citizens in the workforce. Saudi women were almost entirely absent from most sectors of the workforce despite high levels of education. Saudis reveled in the country’s uniqueness, in the formal alliance between the rulers and the religious establishment, and in the rules and roles that provided lifetime employment and protected Saudis from economic downturns. While the country changed dramatically over the twentieth century, it proudly charted its own course while seeming to pick and choose the aspects of Western modernity it would accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last five years, the government has worked actively to reduce the influence of religious institutions on daily life and, in particular, to liberate younger people to socialize and celebrate in diverse ways. While the government still plays a commanding role in the economy, it is seeking to become more of a strategic investor than a regular employer. The private sector is growing, much as it did in China in the 1980s and 1990s, and the rigid ideologies of the past are visibly yielding. Another parallel is rapidly shifting dress patterns. In China, the monochromatic Mao suits of the 1950s and 1960s yielded to patterned Western-style clothing in many places; in Saudi Arabia, the uniform of white thobes for men and black abayas for women is breaking down quickly. Men increasingly wear jeans and t-shirts, while women’s abayas are in a riot of colors and are increasingly worn open with only the lightest hair covering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is similar, too, is an understanding that the newfound freedom has clear limits. In China, the CCP still has complete control over politics, and the government closely monitors public expression for political content. The same is true in Saudi Arabia. While the economy is increasingly unbound and social options are increasing, there is little tolerance for unsanctioned political expression. Saudi officials have privately admired the efficiency of China’s internal transformation. As the metaphor of “feeling the stones” suggests, Saudis see China as having experimented on small matters while ensuring that the country was making deliberate progress, all in the context of a centralized decisionmaking structure with a clear destination in mind. Saudis have also admired the results: a society that was profoundly transformed into an economic powerhouse without an accompanying political transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prominent retired Arab diplomat spoke with deep admiration for China’s feat. Comparing Russia and China, he argued that China superseded Russia because the leadership showed flexibility and innovation. Dismissing Mikhail Gorbachev as an idealist who “played games through perestroika and glasnost,” he argued that China succeeded in part because it focused entirely on the economic task at hand without delving into deep political reform. “The industrial base in Russia should have allowed success,” he said, but because of the Chinese leadership, China came out ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area of contemporary art captures Saudi ambition especially well. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been at the forefront of encouraging creativity among young people in Saudi Arabia, itself a revolutionary concept in a religious tradition that was consistently interpreted to frown on innovation (bid‛ah). Not only had the government formerly frowned upon art and music when not intended for religious purposes, but the clerical establishment sought to constrain it. Artists were barred from depicting human forms, and the religious police confiscated and sometimes destroyed musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explosion of the contemporary art scene in China suggests that even creative artistic expression can be encouraged while it is simultaneously closely monitored for political content. Indeed, one can see China’s efforts to nurture a creative class removed from political or social consciousness as a model for Saudi ambitions. China’s implementation of this practice also models how the institutionalization of political censorship in the art world can help regularize the role of censorship in society more broadly by simultaneously highlighting the power of censors and the narrowness of the censors’ ambit. Because both China and Saudi Arabia have long histories of strict censorship in the past, they are able to cast current patterns of censorship as part of a pattern of liberalization. They place emphasis on a flowering of artistic freedom rather than the guardrails that are strictly maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s reluctance to push adherence to a unitary China model makes tracing Chinese assistance on issues such as censorship difficult, and neither China nor authoritarian governments feel any obligation to publicize cooperation on security-related issues. At the same time, evidence from the Arab side suggests that the Chinese role in this and similar endeavors is more inspirational than practical. The apparent distance serves both sides well. China’s interest is less in advancing Chinese-style solutions than in undermining a belief that Western-style solutions are the only option; from the perspective of Arab governments, if the Chinese experience does not exactly undermine Western calls for liberalization, it helps boost the resolve of liberalization’s critics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, from the point of view of Arab governments, articles in Western publications that describe Chinese government strategies toward censorship are more than adequate to demonstrate both what the Chinese government does and what its effects are. They helpfully boil down Chinese government action into brief and salient points, and they avoid the formal and sometimes formulaic cadences of official Chinese government documents. Of course, many Arab government elites speak and read English, and few speak or read Chinese. For countries that already have well-developed censorship functions, the specific details are less important than the principles, anyway, and Western journalists and academics have covered the principles extensively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-soft-power&quot;&gt;China’s Soft Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might ask what broader Arab publics make of the China model, and in what situations these perceptions matter. Recent polling by the Arab Barometer Project found that, in eight of the nine countries where they were able to poll, the publics have a more favorable attitude toward China than the United States. Notably, in each of the nine countries polled, respondents were more likely to view the development of U.S. economic power as a “critical threat” than the development of China’s economic power, and in eight of the nine countries surveyed, at least a third of respondents viewed U.S. economic power through this critical lens. It is important to note, however, that the Arab Barometer’s polls do not touch many of the countries most important to the United States and China, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Washington Institute for Near East Policy has commissioned polls that ask a different set of questions. One poll released in December 2022 (but fielded before Xi’s trip to Riyadh that month) found that 57 percent of Saudis surveyed believed that the Saudi-China relationship was either very important or somewhat important, while only 41 percent said the same was true of the United States. Meanwhile, 61 percent of Saudis agree at least somewhat with the proposition, “We cannot count on the United States these days, so we should look more to other countries like China or Russia as partners.” A similar Washington Institute poll in the UAE fielded in November 2022 found similar numbers, with 56 percent arguing that strong China ties were important, 44 percent saying the same about the United States, and 61 percent supporting the hedging proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, numbers in Egypt were much more evenly divided. A November 2022 poll found that 55 percent of Egyptians believed that the Egypt-China relationship was important, compared to 52 percent saying the same about the United States, a gap that is within the poll’s margin of error, and Egyptians were evenly split 49 percent apiece on whether the country should hedge against U.S. abandonment through closer China and Russia ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those polling numbers are not a clear assessment of soft power, and they say little about public attitudes toward the more liberal models of the West and the more authoritarian model of China. It is hard, in fact, to imagine how one could get research permission in those states to ask those questions broadly. It is significant, though, that these are nations that have been the targets of substantial U.S. attention — both through educational exchanges and cultural efforts dating back to the 1970s, and strong government-to-government cooperation on security issues that in some cases has lasted even longer. That a larger fraction of the public believes in the importance of close ties with China than with the United States, and the widespread belief in the importance of having a balanced relationship between multiple powers rather than aligning as closely as possible with the United States, represents an important victory for China’s global strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least when speaking with a U.S. researcher, English-speaking Arab elites are keen to highlight the differences between the United States and China. “China is a market, not a model,” one Emirati researcher suggested, and a Kuwaiti businessman complained, “It is not clear how they do business.” While China provides a lower-cost structure, the Kuwaiti felt communication was easier with the West. An Egyptian businessperson cautioned that while the Chinese model can provide financing, “You have to look at the intentions, too.” This Egyptian argued that Chinese financing in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa led to default, and ultimately to Chinese ownership. An Egyptian official who has negotiated with the Chinese had a more balanced view, suggesting that the Chinese “are tough in negotiation, but they control their temper. They are masters of micro and macro. They are patient negotiators, and they don’t lie.” Yet, that description is an almost clinical description of negotiations, with no sense that personal chemistry can help bridge differences. A former U.S. ambassador, long resident in the Middle East, said that culturally, Arabs “don’t understand the Chinese. They can’t figure out what makes them tick. There is no cultural communication.” A veteran Arab journalist who is close to the Egyptian government said simply that the Chinese “are not good at mixing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On an analytical level, some Arabs are skeptical that partnerships with China can yield all that is promised. Kuwaitis have watched the highly touted “Silk City” partnership with China languish for more than a decade, although they are as critical of the Kuwaiti role as the Chinese one. Similarly, Chinese cooperation on Egypt’s New Administrative Capital has waxed and waned and has ultimately yielded much less than initially promised. One Egyptian business executive argued that both the scale and pace of bilateral cooperation are “too aggressive. There are 44 new cities in the pipeline,” he said in March 2022. “It’s too much, especially if there are external shocks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some Arab leaders wonder just how applicable the Chinese experience is to Arab governments after all. A veteran Arab diplomat argued that there is no way to repeat the China experience in the Middle East, “Because the human factor is completely different. . . . [They] are not in a position to replicate it because of the nature of the people.” A former Egyptian government official concurred, suggesting that Islam had created a “fatalistic attitude toward development” that engenders passivity. Former New Yorker China correspondent Peter Hessler moved to Egypt, and in one memorable 2015 article wrote about expatriate Chinese entrepreneurs there. The entrepreneurs had a dour view of the country’s workforce and economic prospects. They argued that the work ethic was poor, especially among men, and gender roles blocked women from full economic participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, some Chinese say their understanding of the Arab world is superficial at best. A Chinese diplomat told a former professor that “the United States and Great Britain have many . . . human resources, but our channels are basically official. We don’t know many people. We don’t know the kings and bankers and complicated Arab camps and different political colors, family relations, clans.” The scholar added that with almost no heritage speakers who can act as a bridge, “We Chinese have a hard time integrating into that region,” adding also that anti-Muslim bias is widespread in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether such comments are intended more as straightforward analysis or represent a Chinese effort to — in Deng Xiaoping’s formulation — “hide capabilities and bide time” is unclear. Yet the two are not contradictory. China is quite intentionally not seeking to imitate the U.S. path, and part of the U.S. path is inspiring imitation. One could imagine China would gain significantly by emboldening others to resist imitating the United States without inspiring a simultaneous imitation of China. The “China model,” in this case, can be seen as promoting global resistance to the adoption of Western liberalism. Arguably, the China model represents the notion that governments around the world can follow the Chinese path, in that the economy flourishes and stability is maintained while the government picks and chooses those aspects of modernity their populations will embrace and rejects aspects that it sees as contributing to instability or immorality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-policy-responses&quot;&gt;U.S. Policy Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy challenge China poses to the United States is an unconventional one. Whereas the Cold War pitted the United States and the Soviet Union against each other, China argues that there is no contradiction in building stronger relations with the United States and China simultaneously. China and Middle Eastern states alike point to the vague notion of a China model to undermine what each sees as undesirable U.S. hegemony. All of these countries agree that they are merely seeking to foster a respect for legitimate difference, and no one is choosing sides. In the process, each country is enhancing its leverage against the United States and making it harder for the U.S. government to accomplish its goals in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a certain instinct in the U.S. government to fall back on Cold War models and see Sino-American competition in the Middle East as a zero-sum, symmetrical affair. The United States works with an array of allies and partners to weave together diplomatic cooperation, military basing, commercial relations, and a host of other ties to drive a common purpose and isolate an adversary. It assumes China is doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, China is playing a different game. It is not looking for allies and, in fact, does not pursue formal alliances at all. Instead, China is seeking to undermine the solidarity of U.S. partners to create a world dominated by ad hoc, at-will bilateral relationships — in which China is the dominant party. It obscures some of this by embracing a slew of loosely held multilateral groupings such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the BRICS, all of which hold meetings that are long on verbal expressions of solidarity and short on binding mutual obligations. These groups play a very different role than the treaty-based organizations that are fundamental to U.S. foreign policy. Through these efforts, China is not seeking to out-align the United States so much as it is seeking to undermine U.S. alignments, thereby nullifying many of the advantages that the United States enjoys in global affairs. It does so partly defensively, to avoid U.S.-led isolation, and partly opportunistically, to exploit opportunities that the United States creates through its own efforts to isolate adversarial countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this can be seen working in practice. The United States built a 35-country coalition to repel Saddam Hussein’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Amid the war in Ukraine, U.S. partners and allies in the Middle East have been circumspect about aligning with the United States against Russia. They have been reluctant to condemn Russian actions and reluctant to enforce sanctions against Russian entities. It is easy to see how this trend advances Chinese interests. If states are reluctant to act collectively against Russian aggression, they are even less likely to act against future Chinese aggression, should it occur. After all, most countries have only distant relationships with Russia. China is the leading trading partner of most of these countries, an important source of technology and infrastructure, and a country that most assess to be a rising global power. Even Western European countries with deep and strategic U.S. ties and long histories of close cooperation with the United States are uneasy about being drawn into a Sino-American rivalry. Middle Eastern states that see diminishing U.S. interest in the region are even more reluctant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proper U.S. response to this set of circumstances is threefold: establishing a clearer set of U.S. priorities, making a clear-eyed assessment of partners’ motivations, and crafting a mix of incentives and consequences to shape partners’ behavior. The first of these is both the most obvious and most important. The United States must determine where the Middle East fits into the U.S. global posture. Too often in recent years, U.S. visions for the region have been asserted negatively rather than positively, as an indication of what the United States will no longer do — or what it will no longer do to excess — rather than what it will. Yet, the Biden administration’s commitment to align U.S. ambitions in the Middle East with available resources without specifying those resources has led many to judge that the drop-off will be acute. In addition, dramatic shifts in policy and strategy between different administrations, and in particular the Trump administration’s skepticism of alliances and the Biden administration’s warm embrace of them, cannot help but provoke hedging behavior by allies and partners alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is little that any presidential administration can do about the policies of its predecessors and successors, there is much that it can do to assert its own priorities. Still, administrations are often reluctant to do so with much clarity. This is in part because the U.S. system often finds it far easier to accrue priorities than dispense of them. It also reflects a concern that publicly shedding priorities has more costs than benefits. U.S. national security advisers often fall back on the formulation that “the President has no higher priority” to reassure audiences, inadvertently highlighting the profound challenge of even beginning to order the myriad objectives of U.S. foreign policy. Even so, a clearer U.S. articulation of its enduring priorities — including but not limited to energy security through the energy transition, freedom of navigation for global seaborne trade, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism — is a task of the utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this priority, the United States needs to redefine the U.S. security role in the region from policeman to security partner. For more than five decades, the U.S. security approach has been to push Middle Eastern militaries to build capabilities that are complementary to U.S. capabilities while simultaneously pushing them to buy U.S. equipment. The consistent assumption has been that in the event of actual hostilities, U.S. soldiers would do much of the fighting and dying. The American public is increasingly skeptical of that bargain. A more sustainable approach would have two components. The first is to push regional states to develop more genuine capabilities, as Israel has done for some time and the UAE has done more recently. Rather than end direct U.S. support, as some have advocated, the goal here is to raise the threshold of actions that require direct U.S. support. Developing these capabilities is a multi-decade process that must touch on everything from personnel to logistics to acquisitions to doctrine, as the Saudis have discovered since embarking on their own defense reform effort. Enhancing these efforts needs to be a strategic priority for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aspect of redefining the U.S. security role is to make good on two decades of efforts by U.S. administrations to integrate the security capabilities of regional states. Many are too small by themselves to develop full-spectrum capabilities, but the ability to operate as a coalition — which requires efforts to align doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities, as well as aligning efforts at early warning — would give each a significantly larger margin of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the instinct of many is to use speeches and statements to proclaim bold U.S. intentions and then work toward making them a reality, it is the wrong approach here. The approach the U.S. government should adopt is to act first and create a record of accomplishment, and then deliver speeches and statements that connect the dots for a skeptical audience. The security space is not only one of profound U.S. advantage compared to China, but also one where China is unlikely to be able to compete effectively for decades, if ever. There are two principal challenges for the United States here: managing a maturing in these security ties while maintaining the confidence of partners and maintaining enough influence with partners to dissuade them from embarking on open-ended military adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After establishing a clearer set of U.S. priorities, the second piece of the puzzle is gaining a better understanding of how Middle Eastern states view the potential for deeper relationships with both the United States and China. Part of China’s attraction is the government’s ability to make and implement agreements swiftly, and part is the lower cost of Chinese goods. Part, too, is the sense that opening up to China gives them leverage in all of their negotiations, on everything from pricing to terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of speed, the U.S. government needs to see its slow and bureaucratic processes for what they are: a competitive liability against China, and thus a strategic vulnerability. Some of these processes are well justified to ensure proper diligence, some are a consequence of law, and some are a consequence of bureaucratic inertia and accumulations of custom. To the extent that the U.S. government identifies great power competition as a core security concern across all domains of government, and not just the Department of Defense, accelerating U.S. government decisionmaking and implementation needs to become a strategic priority — across the entire interagency process and on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition must push U.S. officials to both understand what the Chinese are offering and what Middle Eastern states are seeking. To do so, they must put as much time into understanding what the Chinese government puts on offer as Chinese officials do of their American counterparts. Some Arab officials report that when Chinese delegations come in, they essentially red-team the U.S. side, presenting what they believe the U.S. proposal will be, at what price, and with what conditions. They then present their own counteroffer. Too often, U.S. officials take comfort in the logic of the superiority of the U.S. side and presume to know the needs and expectations of their partners. Yet, the result is that Middle Eastern states sometimes treat U.S. cooperation as a luxury good: something that is too expensive to rely on every day and something that should be acquired only in instances when it can be seen easily or when superior performance is vital. Thinking creatively and critically about the U.S. value proposition, and understanding better how to both enhance it and articulate it, is a vital priority that is too often neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a competitive perspective, the hardest puzzle for the United States to address is its desire to move the world toward systems that embrace human rights and rule of law, as well as China’s hostility to linking morality with international affairs. That difference — which should be sustained — is likely to represent a persistent aspect of advantage to China. Yet, it need not be a debilitating difference. The United States has had enough experiences in its history, both further back and in the more recent past, to have some humility about the effects of its choices and the strength of its foresight. Countries as different as South Korea, Chile, and the Czech Republic have taken very different paths toward greater democratization, and countries such as Peru and Myanmar have once seemed on a very different democratizing course and endured significant backsliding. Massive U.S. efforts to promote democratization in Iraq and Afghanistan have fallen profoundly short of their goals. The United States should not seek to be the referee of whether countries’ political and economic journeys are in the right direction and at the right pace, nor should it see itself as the principal catalyst for change in foreign lands. Efforts should focus on both the complexity and necessary duration of efforts to foster positive change. The United States should seek to reward those inside of government and out who make courageous efforts to build more robust systems that support the rule of law and ensure that the U.S. political system serves as a positive example to countries around the world. The last part is the hardest, but ultimately, it is the most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last piece — imposing consequences for negative behavior and incentivizing good behavior — is far easier to describe than to execute. It has several aspects. The first is reaching a clearer internal understanding of what is most important. As noted above, the U.S. system is often bad at prioritization, and it accrues objectives far better than it sheds them. U.S. government bureaucracies each seek to advance their own priorities, and they are often quite different. Yet, from the perspective of target countries, the U.S. system produces a muddle of demands that cannot possibly all be satisfied, and that even the United States does not expect to be fully satisfied. A clearer set of targets from the U.S. side — in what areas and regarding what issues the United States insists on being preeminent — would help address this weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aspect is the need to maintain discipline in imposing consequences for malfeasance. When adversaries and competitors are waiting in the wings to fill gaps that the United States leaves, there can be a U.S. instinct to seek comity and compromise. Creating credibility for U.S. parameters worldwide is more important than any single deal or any single relationship. Communicating this effectively to partners and allies is both delicate and difficult, although a more streamlined set of priorities should ease this task. When the U.S. response is both clear and expected, it may become less necessary over time. In this regard, the United States already has demonstrated important guardrails on Middle Eastern states’ Chinese ties. For example, an agreement to sell the F-35 fighter to the UAE has been delayed, reportedly because of U.S. concerns that the UAE’s installation of Huawei’s 5G telecommunications network would open the door to deeper Chinese understandings of U.S. weapons capabilities. The Emiratis suspended talks over the deal in December 2021, and the agreement may not go through at all. Both sides have expressed their limits, and each appears willing to walk away from a significant agreement that each side wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third aspect is being willing to invest in incentives. Priorities help here, but equally important is a sense of both empathy toward regional governments as well as creativity. The Middle East is looking at profound change in the coming decades as young graduates flood the workforce and the energy transition upends economies. In the near term, cheap Chinese infrastructure can buy political support, but long-term political survival requires solutions with technical, educational, vocational, and business components. The United States has a considerable comparative advantage in these areas. China builds things for money and repatriates the profits to China. U.S. companies invest in people and processes, and they develop management cadres that endure for decades. The legacy of Aramco, which began as a consortium of four U.S. oil companies, is instructive in this regard. It became an increasingly Saudi company that for decades has produced ministers and the country’s top technical, engineering, and management talent. There are few major projects in the kingdom that do not have leadership that encompasses at least some Aramco alumni, and Aramco is a company that is shot through with U.S. DNA. As the region prepares for the coming transition, it will need an invigorated cadre of people and institutions that stay in the region, not foreign construction workers who return home to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When combined with the possibility that some adversaries, such as Iran, may have an even harder time with these challenges and provoke additional security threats as they struggle, the U.S. security proposition, when embedded in a broader economic growth relationship, becomes even stronger. Although the sentiment in the United States often seems to trend toward divesting from the Middle East, investments tied to encouraging closer ties are more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterintuitively, the energy transition appears destined to enrich the region in the near term, as low-cost production (in terms both of dollars and carbon emissions) will give Middle Eastern producers a larger share of global markets, even as those markets are shrinking. Awareness of the challenges ahead is also making regional leaders especially focused on their long-term sustainability. China’s own economic problems, partly self-inflicted during the coronavirus pandemic, dim China’s luster. As the region went through a period of writing off the United States and its sustained interest, its sense of comfort and entitlement has diminished. A focused U.S. effort would not need to be expensive, and it could reap broad returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connected to all of this is a need to bring the U.S. public along. The United States cannot effectively compete with China in the Middle East when many Americans are hostile to U.S. involvement there. Decades of war have persuaded the U.S. public that the Middle East’s most serious challenges have military solutions, and they resent putting U.S. soldiers’ lives at risk in exchange for arms sales. The Middle East will remain vital to the global economy and to global security for decades to come. Even if the United States is principally focused on China, China and the world will have a strong focus on the Middle East, and the United States will need one too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have to find an alternative to condescendingly screaming at people not to follow the China model,” a U.S. military veteran with long experience in the Middle East explained. “I think that liberal democracy, capitalist democracy, scares the shit out of them. It’s not entirely consistent with their culture and their history . . . and it was brought there by the colonizers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, for many in the United States, it is unimaginable that the U.S. model of economic and political development would not have universal appeal. Small minorities with financial or political stakes in the status quo would be expected to defend their privilege, but the masses should be naturally pro-American. After all, for many in the United States, the country is a “city upon a hill,” as John Winthrop admonished fellow New Englanders almost 400 years ago — some combination of a manifestation of divine providence and a model for global emulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After World War II, Americans took their missionary heritage and set out to replicate U.S. conditions abroad. U.S. officials were convinced that securing the country required blocking Marxist inroads in the developing world and expanding the circle of freedom to reach the billions who lived there. The U.S. historical experience was their template for using economic and political development to help prosecute the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Cold War ended and a unipolar world emerged, echoes of the same instinct to equate global economic prosperity and freedom with U.S. security emerged after 9/11. The Bush administration made unprecedented efforts — and investments — to spread democratic institutions and improve governance throughout the Middle East. Speaking to the National Endowment for Democracy in 2003, President George W. Bush argued, “Freedom is worth fighting for, dying for, and standing for — and the advance of freedom leads to peace.” He added his belief that “the prosperity, and social vitality and technological progress of a people are directly determined by [the] extent of their liberty,” and the rise of middle classes strong enough to protect their rights contributes to the spread of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, U.S. officials had confidence that economic growth would help guide “China’s peaceful rise.” In the estimation of then deputy secretary of state Robert Zoellick in 2005, “China does not believe that its future depends on overturning the fundamental order of the international system. In fact, quite the reverse: Chinese leaders have decided that their success depends on being networked with the modern world.” As a more integrated China became more prosperous, Zoellick suggested, China would open up internally, because “closed politics cannot be a permanent feature of Chinese society. It is simply not sustainable — as economic growth continues, better-off Chinese will want a greater say in their future, and pressure builds for political reform.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative then, through 75 years of U.S. policy, was that the world was ineluctably moving toward greater freedom, prosperity, and peace. U.S. policy to promote imitation of the U.S. path would hasten that journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has had a different narrative, predicated on the country assuming its rightful place in world affairs after more than a century of humiliation and subjugation. China has had no interest in following a U.S. path, nor has it thought one was necessary. Instead, China has been cautious and circumspect while pushing its global rise. It has led with trade, touted its embrace of “win-win solutions,” and widely advertised its commitment to noninterference in the domestic affairs of its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Middle East is an especially sensitive case for China. The country’s economic growth depends on imported energy, about half of which comes from the Middle East. Yet, China recognizes that the United States has been the overwhelmingly dominant power in the region for more than a half-century, with an unequaled military and diplomatic presence. China is wary of conflict with the United States in the Middle East, and it neither seeks to compete head-to-head with the United States nor to displace it. Instead, China’s regional strategy is to make its own inroads in the region while neither getting bogged down nor tipping the Middle East into instability. Doing so means enticing countries currently aligned with the United States to adopt a more unaligned posture, using state-directed economic engagement as its calling card. China explicitly contrasts itself with the United States, noting that as a state it can move more quickly and predictably, that it neither second-guesses nor lectures to its partners, and that its goal is not to remake them in China’s own image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vehicle for much of this is the impression — probably stronger in the Middle East than in China itself — that there is a China model for radical economic transformation without an accompanying social and political disruption. The “China experience,” as some Chinese prefer to call it, is an impressive one: decades of double-digit growth accompanied by huge investments in industrialization and massive internal migration. Yet, Arab states impressed with China’s remarkable rise often seem more interested in China’s outcome rather than the path it took to get there, and China has little interest in inspiring imitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, what is important to both China and the Arab states is undermining the presumed Western monopoly on pathways to development. Societies premised on Lockean notions of natural rights, the sanctity of the individual, and the centrality of private property are understood to be but one of an array of options. The Chinese experience gives Arab states leverage to resist Western efforts to reshape their societies, introduces what the Chinese presumably see as a useful friction between Arab states and the West, and adds luster to bilateral cooperation with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States and its allies, a proper assessment of the situation is the first step to addressing it. China is not trying to supplant the United States, it is trying to supplement it. U.S. partners and allies in the Middle East — and the region contains eight “major non-NATO allies” of the United States — are similarly seeking to supplement their U.S. relationship. They partly want military equipment the United States is reluctant to sell, and they partly want investment and financing for capital development projects. Even more, though, they want to be courted, to not be taken for granted, and to be able to pursue benefits from every corner. Just as all four of President Donald Trump’s addresses to the UN General Assembly called for the United States to pursue an “America first” strategy, and for every other country to do the same, virtually all Middle Eastern states believe they would benefit from more aggressively pursuing their own individual interests and adopting positions of greater nonalignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Context matters here. No Middle Eastern country is seeking to follow a China model with any fidelity; at the same time, no country thinks it is either realistic or desirable to take a purely American path. No Middle Eastern country considers itself to be “premodern,” and as a consequence, the nineteenth- and twentieth-century clarity that inspired countries such as Turkey and Japan to pursue radical modernization along the lines of the Soviet Union or imperial Germany has yielded to a muddle of incremental options. Governments are seeking to grow their strength, balancing efficiency and effectiveness with stability, security, and resources. They see improved governance as a tool with both costs and benefits, and they see it as obtainable irrespective of whether they follow a more authoritarian or liberal path. Indeed, there are aspects in which China’s governance outperforms the United States. These countries view themselves not as choosing between options but among them, experimenting with contradictory initiatives in hopes of making gradual but steady improvements in an increasingly crowded and noisy policy environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To many in the Middle East, pure imitation of the U.S. path is both unwise and unattainable. It relies on citizens who are entirely different from their own, in a robust legal and policy environment and a vibrant economy. For years, Arab officials visiting Washington have averred that U.S. democracy took 200 years to reach its current state and that they need a century and a half to catch up. The Arab uprisings of 2011 continue to reverberate in the region. In places such as Syria, Libya, Iraq, and Yemen, governments continue to struggle to assert control over their entire territory; in other places, governments see potential revolutionaries continuing to lurk. The United States needs to be sensitive to the charge that it is both sanctimonious and reckless, lecturing partners while leading them into anarchy. Under current conditions, many regional governments consider mainstream U.S. advice to constrain government authority, liberalize political activity, dispense with patronage, expand free speech, and empower political opponents to be madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the United States is not without options. The U.S. government needs to be clearer that in seeking a world that is more prosperous and stable, it is not seeking mere imitation. Every country will treat its own issues in its own way, but should countries seek partnership, the United States is both a superior choice and a possible one. It needs to better articulate the benefits of a closer alignment, the costs of a looser one, and the criteria by which closeness is judged. The answer to this question is likely to vary from administration to administration, which itself will promote some hedging behavior from regional partners. Even so, a clearer framework — and one that allows for both resilience and dynamism — would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already we have seen the U.S. government articulate redlines for Chinese engagement, particularly on issues of technology, infrastructure, and military hardware. This is appropriate. Yet, the United States should not seek to list comprehensively every activity it frowns upon, implicitly encouraging partners to come right up to the line of what is permitted and what is forbidden. The United States should be clearer in outlining principles and examples, pushing partner states to judge what is consistent with acceptable boundaries and what is outside of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more important than communicating the costs of some kinds of Chinese ties, the United States needs to help its partners better understand the unique value proposition of closer U.S. ties, especially when it comes to the development of human capital that will shape the region’s future in the next five decades. China’s offerings in this regard are weak, not only in terms of university education, but also in terms of developing management experience. China’s record of empowering local employees in the Middle East and grooming them to take on leadership positions pales in comparison to the United States and its allies. While there is certainly a role for Chinese-style industrial development in countries’ overall plans, it is hard to imagine it provides a pathway toward national prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In science and technology, a key to future prosperity, Western science — especially in the United States — developed a robust Covid-19 vaccination. Leaving aside the question of Chinese officials’ role in containing the Covid-19 virus in its earliest stages, China’s broad efforts to promote a homegrown vaccine and distribute it widely made good headlines but not good public health outcomes. Reports of widespread vaccine hesitancy throughout the Arab world to take the Chinese vaccine validate the fundamental U.S. value proposition: the United States provides robust solutions to complicated problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On economic issues as well, a U.S.-guided path toward more open markets, a well-functioning banking system, and a capable and well-educated workforce may not provide the “sugar rush” of results that directed government grants (or in the case of wealthy Gulf states, government spending) provides, but it provides benefits that endure. U.S. government officials have no monopoly on wisdom in this area, and they need to work hand-in-hand with private sector leaders in business and banking to develop robust systems, but as U.S. allies in East Asia demonstrate, these patterns develop virtuous circles that endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The superiority of such systems is likely to become more evident as the “Chinese economic miracle” recedes in the public memory, the Chinese economy cools off in the post-Covid era, and China begins to grapple with the economic realities of a shrinking population. Strong patterns of growth in U.S. partners such as India, some of which are being boosted by Gulf investment, can help reinforce this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of these opportunities, the United States will need to continue to push for ways to lower the transaction costs of partnering with the United States. A combination of law, regulation, and U.S. bureaucratic inertia can mean that straightforward transactions can take months or years to implement. Chinese officials regularly approach Arab officials with proposals for economic cooperation — one said, “I receive a proposal every week” — while sometimes explicitly “red-teaming” the U.S. government response by outlining the timeline and conditions of U.S. cooperation while explicitly outlining a supposedly superior Chinese offer. Within the parameters of law, the U.S. government should seek ways to advance the agility of its decisionmaking process. It should explore amendments to laws that would speed up implementation while preserving necessary checks on abuse. Too often, Arab officials say, the United States acts as if it has a monopoly. One of China’s advantages to them is that it reminds them that they have a choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, though, the United States needs to remember that Middle Eastern states are not making a choice as they did during the Cold War. There is no Iron Curtain, and the dilemma is not to choose sides. These states see themselves in a dynamic market in which they are constantly seeking to assess their own worth and sense the demand signals. In this, the United States has significant advantages alongside some vulnerabilities. No country is seeking to fall into a Chinese orbit, and China has no interest in creating an orbit into which they can fall. Likewise, few seek to isolate themselves from the United States. The United States is likely to remain predominant in the region as long as it seeks to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, China is seeking to chip away at U.S. hegemony in the Middle East, undermining efforts to strengthen a U.S.-led global system that the Chinese government views as directed against it. The idea of a China model to which states can aspire helps advance Chinese goals in this regard, if only to entice states to push back on the United States and draw closer to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China and the United States are each other’s largest trading partners, both sides understand that competition, contestation, and cooperation necessarily coexist. It will be so in the Middle East as well. Sharpening understandings of the value of close U.S. partnership, lowering the costs of maintaining U.S. partnership, and clarifying the consequences of undermining U.S. partnerships in the Middle East provide the best path forward for U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the afternoon of 17 September, pagers belonging to Hezbollah fighters, collaborators and civilian supporters exploded across Lebanon. The pagers beeped for a few seconds before exploding, leading to injuries primarily to the face and eyes. By the following morning, 11 people were dead and more than 2,000 injured. Among the injured were senior Hezbollah officials and the Iranian Ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amini. While initially, two main theories – a cyber attack and the use of explosives – emerged, it soon became apparent that tiny quantities of explosives had been placed in the pagers sometime between production and distribution. The pagers were distributed widely among Hezbollah and its affiliates and were part of a batch only recently purchased by the group. While the attack represented a security breach for the group, it constituted a great success for Israel and (likely) Mossad, even if – as some suggest – Israel was in a “use them or lose them” predicament. The attack also raises important issues that have to do with the conduct and signalling function of covert operations, international legality and legitimacy, and the increasing risk of regional escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is confirmed that Israel used explosives hidden in the pagers, such an operation entails both novel and recurring elements in Israel’s (covert) foreign policy. The attack is unprecedented in terms of scale and reach. It occurred in a denied country where it should be harder for Israel to conduct operations. Be that as it may, Israel has shown great ability to target individuals in Beirut and even Tehran in recent months. The number of pagers distributed is also impressive, as is the ability to modify them to explode simultaneously. Such prowess also entails an ability to interfere effectively in a supply and distribution chain. The operation to sabotage the supply chain and insert a few grams of explosives in the devices must have taken months. It remains unclear when this intervention took place. The pagers were seemingly produced under the label Gold Apollo, a Taiwan-based company, but the president of the company was quick to distance it from the attack. Instead, he pointed the finger at BAC, a company based in Budapest with the rights to produce under the Gold Apollo label. The operation’s conduct and outcome is likely to have provided Israel with an even better picture of the group, its collaborators, its capabilities and its main locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The operation is likely to damage Hezbollah’s morale, and many fighters and collaborators will have been put out of action for some time due to their injuries&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, this is not the first time that Israel has used explosives; it has often hidden them in civilian items and/or communication technology. As Ronen Bergman detailed in his history of Israel’s use of assassination, the practice was particularly prevalent in the late 1970s. In Lebanon, in a close historical precedent, Israel placed explosives in oil and fuel drums that were later distributed to the families of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) fighters. Explosives have also been used in the assassination of high-level targets. In 1973, Israel hid explosives in the marble stand of the phone of PLO leader Mahmoud Hamshari in Paris. Having confirmed Hamshari’s identity by phone, Israel exploded the device. He was severely injured and later died in hospital. In 1996, Shin Bet assassinated Yahya Ayyash, Hamas’s chief bomb-maker, by smuggling a small explosive into his mobile phone, which was then remotely detonated. Perhaps more famously, in 2009, in collaboration with the CIA and then Director Michael Hayden – who had received the green light from President George W Bush – Israel killed the terrorist Imad Mugniyeh by placing a bomb in the spare wheel compartment of his SUV, an area not checked by his security detail, while he was in Damascus, Syria. More generally, Israel is not the only country that has explored the use of explosives, often placed in “exotic devices” for use in assassination. The US government and the CIA famously developed explosive cigars and considered an explosive seashell in their many attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro. The explosive seashell plot was ultimately abandoned, and it isn’t entirely clear what happened to the cigars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the practicalities of the operation, on which more details are likely to emerge in the next few weeks, a key question is the rationale behind the operation. One can think of many possible answers. First, the wide-ranging attack and the targeting of individuals including civilians, as well as collaborators in civilian settings, points to the aim of terrorising the local population. Such an attack could be considered a form of psychological warfare. Early reports after the attack pointed to the level of chaos in Lebanon: overcrowded and struggling hospitals, traffic and ambulances coming to a standstill, general shock among the population, and a fear of answering phone calls. Second, as with many covert operations, part of the rationale was signalling. Here, the target was not solely the Lebanese population at large, but Hezbollah and its collaborators more specifically. The manner in which the attack occurred highlights this dimension. In February, Hezbollah’s Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah had warned his fighters against using their phones. They are more dangerous than Israeli spies, he had warned, pointing to how they had been used to track and kill Hezbollah fighters and leaders. While the group had used pages for years, this increased after Nasrallah’s call and after the killing of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders as revenge for the 7 October attacks. Israel has long demonstrated prowess in exploiting hi-tech devices for its operations, including assassination; such a widespread attack against low-tech objects tells Hezbollah that it has nowhere to hide. In this case, the operation is likely to damage Hezbollah’s morale and – from a more practical point of view – many fighters and collaborators will have been put out of action for some time due to their injuries. Third, the attack will also have reverberations within the international community and international politics. It will increase concerns surrounding supply-chain sabotage, with a greater focus on low-tech items in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Israel has increasingly shown a tendency to escalate the fighting, bringing the region to the precipice of a wider war&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to emerging rumours, Israel might have decided to conduct the operation earlier than it expected, when some Hezbollah leaders raised concerns about the pagers. If this is the case, one could speculate that the initial aim of the operation might have been to target specific high-level individuals, perhaps including the Iranian Ambassador to Lebanon, Amini, who was among the thousands injured in the attack. Another theory currently floating around is that the attack – had it happened when Israel wanted – would have been the first salvo in a broader attack against Hezbollah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the attack certainly violated Lebanese sovereignty. Questions remain regarding the proportionality and the effort to distinguish civilians from combatants in conducting the attack. While Israel might have known who the carriers of the pagers were, it would not have known where they would have been located at the time of the explosion. Israel has disregarded international humanitarian law and international human rights law in many of its recent operations against Gaza, Hamas and Hezbollah. It has also increasingly shown a tendency to escalate the fighting, bringing the region to the precipice of a wider war. This is particularly glaring since the attack happened one day after the visit of Amos Hochstein, senior envoy of the Biden administration, whose mission aimed to prevent a further regional escalation. The US, which has struggled to moderate its regional ally – often contributing to the war effort – was not told in detail of the operation. According to Axios, Israeli Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant only warned US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin moments before the attack that an “intelligence operation” was about to take place. As with many similar operations, then, Israel has put the ball into Hezbollah’s and its regional allies’ – primarily Iran’s – court. Will they respond with a further escalation as they have threatened, or will they de-escalate? At the same time, has the Biden administration lost credibility and leverage with Israel and those it is fighting?&lt;/p&gt;

This monograph explores America’s evolving role on the world stage and highlights key strategies to navigate the critical shifts reshaping the international landscape.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events of the past four years have triggered a fundamental shift in the global international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war and China’s political alignment with Russia have brought an end to the era of global economic integration. Geopolitical forces are intricately reshaping political and economic landscapes worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has adopted a new philosophy, replacing the “hide and bide” strategy of the past. President Xi has developed a more assertive posture, politically, diplomatically, and militarily. Tensions have risen in the South China Sea over artificial islands and claims over exclusive sovereignty. Japan has transitioned from a modest defense posture to doubling its defense spending. India is seeking greater cooperation and coordination with the United States on defense matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 pandemic prompted corporations to undergo a fundamental reassessment of global supply chains. During the 30 years prior, businesses primarily drove global sourcing of materials and components by pursuing the lowest input costs. In the post-Covid era, the reliability of supply has become an equally important factor in these decisions, causing a shift or a duplication of supply chains as hedges for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ascent in the global manufacturing value chain has heightened tensions with other manufacturing power centers, particularly concerning goods related to the energy transition. Europe and the United States are now considering trade restrictions on electric vehicles and batteries. This builds on U.S. restrictions regarding semiconductors, causing a geopolitically driven rift in global economic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domestic consensus on active international leadership is now a debated issue in Congress and between the presidential candidates. The role of the United States as the global indispensable leader was set over 70 years ago. America’s allies are now rich. American politicians and citizens are now actively questioning: Do we need to spend so much of our national treasure on defending wealthy distant allies while we have security challenges at our border? What is the true value of American international political leadership?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global South countries (defined here as countries with low-income economies, generally in the Southern Hemisphere) question the value to them of blindly following the so-called Washington Consensus. Joining the Western-dominated international political and economic order hasn’t accelerated their development. China offers a compelling alternative model and resources to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;modest-burdens-enormous-benefits&quot;&gt;Modest Burdens, Enormous Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of America’s long-term strategy was to build an operating international order that was based on three pillars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consensus with key partner countries on the fundamental values, notably rule of law, government accountability, and constructive international cooperation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alliances with key partners most fundamental to our security interests&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Active participation in international organizations that directly benefited American well-being&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal government’s international affairs budget currently is less than 20 percent of the total federal budget and amounts to approximately 3.5 percent of GNP including defense-related expenditures. While the defense budget is enormous, in relative terms it is a small burden for the U.S. economy. The development budget and the cost of diplomacy is a tiny percentage of GNP and a very small percentage of federal spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit from these investments is enormous. U.S. alliances and partnerships have created a global security environment that greatly favored U.S. interests and benefited the U.S. economy. America’s per capita and national income have soared above all other countries in the world over the past 50 years, outpacing all major allies; collectively with our allies, we dwarf the income capacities of opponents, despite the burdens of international leadership. The United States and Europe primarily set the norms for most global industrial standards, ensuring market access for American products; U.S-established global business norms have given American products pricing power compared to competitors. Americans travel the world freely and at unprecedentedly low costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While America’s prosperity has outpaced all others over the last half century, our prosperity is not uniformly distributed. There are wide and widening disparities of opportunity and benefit in American society. If the United States is to secure a stronger future, it must address these disparities. But neither political party has a coherent growth agenda for the future. One of the most pressing requirements for a secure future is to build a national strategy to grow the economy, and to do so in ways that do not exacerbate inequality or environmental quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will only be achieved with a much stronger commitment to innovation as the cornerstone of a national economic strategy. The economy must grow and become more productive. That will come only with a stronger commitment to making innovation the centerpiece of a domestic economic strategy. This requires greater spending on research and development, strengthening the patent system, and changing immigration policies to recruit more highly skilled talent to help innovate in the field of cutting-edge technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;competing-more-effectively-on-the-global-stage&quot;&gt;Competing More Effectively on the Global Stage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing economy and a more dynamic and open society will be attractive to people around the world. Still, it will not address the fundamental challenge of competing effectively in the Global South. At present, China brings tangible benefits to lower-income countries, while the United States often brings strong lectures about its virtue and paltry support for tangible activities. China has supplanted the United States and Europe as the primary trading partner with African countries. China offers attractive financing for development projects, and increasingly, Chinese companies are making major investments in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes at a time when populations — particularly in Africa — are exploding. The challenges this presents to the world could be enormous — continued pressure on the climate, heightened levels of migration, challenges of new pandemics. America and our allies have a direct and tangible opportunity to help foster accelerated economic growth in the Global South to effectively address these challenges and capitalize on the opportunities of such rapid growth. But this takes a more thoughtful development strategy than we currently have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America needs to return to an earlier vision of boosting economic growth in poorer countries. This can only be practically accomplished by the private sector. The U.S. government development agenda now needs to emphasize enhancing economic growth through promoting private sector investments in the Global South. The U.S. government also needs to address the risk headwinds that currently drive up borrowing costs in the Global South. It has the authorities and institutions to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is deep questioning of whether America can or should remain the leader of the international order it created 70 years ago. There are overwhelming benefits to American citizens by retaining global leadership — benefits that directly contribute to the security and prosperity of individual American citizens. But this will require creating a national strategy that builds on the structural advantages we created and updates them for our day. What follows is only a framework, not a comprehensive delineation of actions. It does contain sufficient specific recommendations for initial implementation. At its core, it requires a consensus that it is fundamentally in America’s self-interest to again welcome the burden of global leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-strategic-framework-for-the-twenty-first-century&quot;&gt;A Strategic Framework for the Twenty-First Century&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America needs a new strategy for the international order that is emerging. China has become a formidable strategic competitor. Often this new era is framed as a new “cold war,” but it would be a huge mistake to label it as such. To understand why the analogy is wrong, we need to first review the factors that informed the Cold War era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-world-in-19461950&quot;&gt;The World in 1946–1950&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to World War II, America never sought global leadership or responsibility. In the 1800s, America was consumed by managing its internal energies and tensions. Slavery, left unresolved by the formation of the United States, led to a tragic and consuming civil war. The government was absorbed by securing its borders and territories, keeping the British government and the Royal Navy at arm’s length, and establishing the foundations for astounding economic growth, fueled by technology-driven expansion in productivity and exploitation of the vast resources of the country. At the end of the nineteenth century, American leaders sought a larger international role, but exclusively on their own terms. The United States avoided the geopolitics of Europe and cherry-picked its larger involvement in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;World War II changed everything. Where America could retreat from the larger international order after previous wars, it could not do so at the end of World War II. The country initially faced two overwhelming problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Europe was shattered by two wars separated by a massive recession. World War I proved enervating to the leadership sentiments of European government leaders. World War II broke their economies and displaced tens of millions of people. Allied armies met in Germany after crushing the Wehrmacht. Initially, the United States hoped to rapidly demobilize and convert its war economy toward renewed domestic rebuilding. But the Soviet Union sought to retain a massive military establishment and expropriate resources from what was left of Europe to help rebuild the Russian economy. Europe was prostrate, and the Soviet Union was prepared to use military power to install compliant governments as far as it could. The starkly different political systems — the authoritarian model of the Soviet Union and the liberal, open economic model of the United States — were now directly in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American leaders realized that it was in the country’s core national interest to help rebuild Europe consistent with American political and economic values. This required neutralizing the threat of the Red Army that continued to occupy Eastern European territories captured from Nazi Germany while helping to rebuild Western European economies with liberal political ideals and free market economic principles. America needed to retain a large standing military in peacetime, breaking with a tradition that went back to its founding. The country also needed to take the lead in rebuilding the economic foundations of a new international order, built on American values of an open market economy and rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second problem that confronted America’s leaders was in part a derivative of the collapse of Europe. The old colonial European empires were losing vitality, accelerated by the enervating impact of World War I. World War II shattered what little remained of the old European-centric colonial system. Within only a few years, dozens and dozens of former colonies now emerged as new states. But which alternative economic system would prevail: the U.S-led system built on liberal government, free market principles, and the rule of law, or the Soviet Union’s system of command mobilization and authoritarianism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-1-bretton-woods&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BOX 1 Bretton Woods&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While World War II was ongoing, the United States started thinking about the world after the war. The country was dedicated to creating a new global system that would promote commercial ties around Western concepts such as due process and transparent markets. What emerged was the so-called Bretton Woods system. The United States initially envisioned a system of rules, institutions, and procedures to regulate international commerce and monetary systems. This led to promoting the establishment of three major institutions: the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (then called the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development), and the International Trade Organization, which would set rules and adjudicate disputes, thereby promoting expanded global trade. The U.S. Senate supported creating the IMF and the World Bank but rejected establishing the International Trade Organization. That forced the Truman administration to support a weaker alternative, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). GATT remained in effect until the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deal with both problems, but especially the second, the United States took the lead to create a system of international organizations that would manage problems that extended past the sovereign remit of any individual country. The priority was economic reconstruction, and what became the so-called Bretton Woods system (see Box 1). Working with wartime allies, the United States pushed to create the United Nations. Everyone had lived through the profound failure of the League of Nations experiment. The authors of the United Nations conceived of a more balanced system that recognized the realpolitik interests of the great powers but also provided a normative structure for the aspirations and interests of newly emerging countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Cold War era advanced, there was further elaboration on the structure that U.S. government leaders created in the early days after World War II. The United States expanded the Bretton Woods institutions beyond the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The UN system became more sophisticated and diverse. The United States augmented its defense agenda with NATO and bilateral defense and security treaties and agreements. The foundation was set. The United States would be an active leader in the world, with its military ensuring security while its diplomacy and commercial activity would help build an international system of institutions designed to promote broad prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grand strategy that emerged in the competition with the Soviet Union was a big success. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1989–1991, unable to sustain its economic model, afford such a massive security establishment (both domestic and military), and keep subordinate allies in line. It all collapsed, thankfully without widespread violence. As discussed below, the end of the Soviet Union was not the end of history, instead leading to the happy emergence of a benign international order built around Western liberal economic and political values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;this-is-not-your-grandfathers-cold-war&quot;&gt;This Is Not Your Grandfather’s Cold War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superficially, there are broad strokes of comparability between the Cold War and the current era. The current geopolitical competition with China (and secondarily with Russia) is fundamentally a standoff between two competing political philosophies about how best to structure and lead countries. The United States, Europe, and many important ally and partner countries, including in Asia, share a political philosophy in which the role of government is to ensure a fair and level playing field for the private sector. The government works to balance the interests and demands of individual liberty with the collective requirements of an orderly society. This “Western” model is based on concepts such as the rule of law; open (but regulated) markets; due process in judicial, political, and administrative procedures; transparent governmental decisionmaking; an open and free press; and open and free elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China embraced an authoritarian command mobilization model. The government’s legitimacy derives not from a mandate from citizens but from the transcending authority of a sole dominant political party. The Chinese Communist Party decides what is best for individual citizens and for society. China has adapted some structures from the Western model, but there is no question where power lies, or with whom the coercive powers of the state reside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great competition with the Soviet Union was primarily a military and a diplomatic competition. The Soviet Union was never an economic competitor. By contrast, China is an economic powerhouse, with four times as many potential consumers as the United States. It sets the political terms of access to Western companies that want to compete in the Chinese market. Neighboring Asian countries cannot resist the enormous economic pull of the vast Chinese market. The government provides enormous subsidies to start-up companies and to education and research establishments. China has created an impressive array of university laboratories and centers that are engaged in cutting-edge research. The government collects intelligence on other countries and companies, stealing intellectual property. China has also been effective in its diplomatic outreach to countries in Africa, the Middle East, and South America, championing the interests of poor countries against the interests of rich Northern Hemisphere countries, tapping into the lingering resentment over colonialism and the general disregard by American leaders for the issues of the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, China is a full-dimension competitor, unlike the Soviet Union. China offers a development model that is far more compelling than was that offered by the Soviet Union, and it has mass and momentum in its diplomacy. But there are other factors that make this era starkly different from the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, while the United States remains the largest economy in the world, it is not the towering, dominant actor on the global stage. Whereas America’s economy was roughly 50 percent of world GDP in 1946, it is only slightly more than 15 percent today, after adjusting for purchasing power. In 1950, human talent was highly concentrated in American universities and research facilities. Today, human talent is global and connected in unprecedented ways through modern communication systems. The United States continues to dominate global financial markets, but many new tools are available to individuals, corporations, and countries to work around U.S. financial dominance. The United States is an innovation powerhouse, but so too are Europe, Japan, South Korea, China, Israel, and, increasingly, many other pockets around the world. America remains strong, but not omnipotent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, despite its strengths, America’s political system is now fractured, disputatious, and dispiriting. Both dominant political parties have adopted the same strategy to win elections — mobilize their angry base voters and exploit real or invented flaws in the opponent to sway unaffiliated voters. Fear and anger are seen as more powerful motivating sentiments to win elections than are specific proposals or broad sentiments of hope and encouragement. This rancorous politics projects grotesque images on the international stage, images exploited by opponents and occasionally by friends. It is hard to see how America can continue to be a welcome leader in the world when it is riven by bitter politics at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, technological advances are moving far faster than the ability of democratic governments to deal with the implications of these technologies. Social media has turbocharged anger and divisiveness in U.S. politics. But there is absolutely no consensus on how the U.S. government should manage the problem. The astounding advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) will only amplify this gap between social and commercial developments and government policy. The speed of technological advancements far exceeds the deliberative pace of government. The ultimate “product” of government is due process, which takes time. The widening gap between advancing technology and government review is now a challenging problem. These technology developments accelerate a broader political pattern seen over the past 60 years where priority is often given to the rights of personal liberty and private benefit over the collective needs of a community. There has also been a sharp rise in alienation in American society, propelled mightily by social media that has no objective standards for truthfulness. Reading or seeing something that validates one’s prejudices now constitutes evidence in popular political discourse, making the task of explaining the complexities of problems and the sophistication of policy formulations all the more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted a fundamental issue concerning modern commerce and society. Problems move speedily around the world, but the mechanisms of coordinating effective response are weak and fractured. All of the complex and hard problems in the world today are “horizontal,” but all sovereign governments are “vertical.” Really hard problems — pandemics, illegal drugs, refugees and migration, climate change and pollution, illegal money laundering, and terrorism — span far beyond the reach of any individual country, no matter how powerful. By contrast, the structures of international collaboration and coordination are weak. Poverty and weak governance in a distant land create fertile conditions for criminality and terrorism. For example, weak regulatory systems in China show up as a flood of precursor chemicals fueling dangerous illegal drug manufacturing in Mexico and the United States. The problems confronting the world today are more complex and multidimensional than was the case in the late 1940s, while the structure of coordination (and even the competency of governments) has remained static, at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, countries in the so-called Global South no longer see Northern Hemisphere countries as benefactors or agents of positive change. There is a deep and widely held view that Europe and the United States have largely ignored the needs of the Global South. By contrast, China has effectively presented itself as a “developing” country, sharing the sentiments of aspiring Global South governments and citizens. Developing countries see commercial protectionism enacted by rich countries. Countries in the Global North will gladly take university-educated citizens but block poor migrants. Climate change advocates champion renewable energy sources to low-income countries without recognizing that many of these countries place a higher priority on affordable energy for economic development. International institutions seem structurally biased in favor of the wealthy countries in the Northern Hemisphere. The International Criminal Court seems only to concentrate on wayward African leaders, but never confronting leaders of developed countries. The war in Ukraine has highlighted the ambivalence that countries in the Global South feel about a conflict that they see as unrelated to their needs or aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of 2023 is not at all like the world of 1947 and 1948. The strategy that successfully guided the United States through the Cold War will not be adequate for the current day. The United States needs a new national strategy to navigate these complicated waters. What follows is not a strategy. Instead, this report proposes a framework for thinking strategically about the United States’ choices and directions. There was no blueprint master plan to survive and succeed during the Cold War. Many of the most important elements of the Cold War strategy emerged only when America confronted an intractable new problem. The strategy for this new era will be similar, but there are outlines of a framework that could guide the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-survive-as-a-nation&quot;&gt;To Survive as a Nation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is common for corporations and other organizations to adopt a mission statement. The most apt mission statement for the U.S. government is simple: to survive as a nation and to prosper as a people. The U.S. Constitution used different terms but clearly articulated these goals in the opening sentence by stating that the purpose of the new American government is to “provide for the common defense” and to “promote the general Welfare” of American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days following World War II, the immediate problem facing U.S. government leaders concerned the security of a shattered Europe. Tensions with the Soviet Union built up during the war but soon became an urgent priority. This led the United States to break with history and to maintain a large standing military establishment, augmented by alliances and partnerships, and to shape the international environment by creating a network of organizations and procedures that would influence the emerging world along lines more favorable to U.S. national interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;starting-with-what-we-inherited&quot;&gt;Starting with What We Inherited&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build a strategy, you need to know your goals. What are national goals? Every modern American president usually adopts a formal National Security Strategy. But these documents outline the administration’s security strategy, not a grand strategy for America’s future. Presidents usually articulate elements of a national strategy as part of a political agenda to promote their party’s philosophy of governing. The United States does not have a tradition of developing an integrated national strategy that incorporates all of its potential resources, channeled to accomplish specific goals. And a national strategy requires identifying what the country will not do as a nation, which is hard in a polyglot society with a geographically defined representative legislature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More fundamentally, the United States lacks the government structure to develop such a strategy. Congress is divided into dozens of committees and hundreds of subcommittees. There is no way for Congress to develop an integrated national strategy. In theory, a president could create a national strategy, but the cabinet system divides operational jurisdictions into over a dozen stovepipes, hardened by congressional oversight that impedes cross-cutting integration. Within the White House, the president has a National Security Council and a National Economic Council, each competing for the president’s time and focus. Important elements of the U.S. economy — such as U.S. universities and research institutions — have only a weak channel into the most senior levels of decisionmaking in the White House. In short, the country lacks a structural focus for creating a new national strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To develop a new national strategy, we return to the fundamental mission statement for the U.S. government from the Constitution: to survive as a nation and to prosper as a people — to “establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity” (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two great pillars of a national strategy must deal with these primary goals: (1) to survive as a nation, and (2) to prosper as a people. This report will explore them separately, but they are inextricably connected. Security is a prerequisite for prosperity, and prosperity is required to support the structures of government that guarantee security. As stated by a wise observer, “We must be safe before we can get rich, and we must get rich to remain safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sustain-hard-defense-resources&quot;&gt;Sustain Hard Defense Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed above, the United States pursued two primary channels for national security in the early years of the Cold War. The first was to maintain in peacetime a large and sophisticated military establishment and to base elements of that force in countries close to the enemy. These actions were seen as necessary to deter hostile forces acting against U.S. interests. The United States continues to maintain a large and sophisticated military establishment and continues to deploy military units around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This long-standing bipartisan consensus is now being challenged. Conservatives are divided. A growing faction argues that the United States should pull back from foreign deployments and focus on domestic security needs, such as securing the southern border of the country. This group of conservatives questions the need for massive defense spending. The other group of conservatives — still a majority, but a declining one — believes that the country has weakened the military through inadequate investment in new kit. These conservatives challenge the Biden administration and have increased the administration’s defense budget request every year. Meanwhile, some progressives argue that the United States spends as much on national defense as the next eight countries combined. Democrats support current operations because they do not want to undercut a Democratic president, but progressives are primed to shift funds from defense budgets to domestic needs when the politics permits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these obviously significant differences in priorities, annual adjustments to defense spending and to the defense establishment are relatively minor, reflecting a general consensus among voters. Generally, the American public wants a significant military establishment and accepts the argument that basing forces forward to support allies is beneficial to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States must sustain a strong military, the country must take a serious look at how efficiently it spends money on national defense. The defense budget is enormous, by any measure. In fiscal year (FY) 2023, Congress appropriated $853.0 billion for defense spending. We need to put this in context, however. It is critical to exclude the war costs of the past 20 years. However, even including those costs, the $853 billion is not hugely out of scale with spending in the past. FY 1985 saw the peak spending of the so-called Reagan buildup years. When President Reagan came to office, he campaigned on the poor conditions of the U.S. military and weak defense spending in the Carter budget years. President Reagan sought to reverse the decline of spending following the Vietnam War. The height of the Reagan buildup — expressed in FY 2024 dollars — was $718.6 billion. Adjusting this year’s $853 billion to FY 2024 inflation brings it to $877.8 billion. So the spending appropriated by Congress in FY 2023 was 22 percent greater in real terms than the height of the Reagan buildup in 1984. But it is instructive to compare what the United States bought with these two budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1984, the United States had nearly 300,000 military personnel stationed in Europe. Today, that number is just 66,326. The United States stationed 41,718 Army and Air Force personnel in South Korea in 1985. Today, that number has shrunk to approximately 25,372. In the intervening 40 years, the United States has had five rounds of base closures and has closed over 300 military facilities. In short, with a budget that is 22 percent larger today, the country has a significantly smaller military force than at the height of the Cold War. It is therefore critical to understand how the country is spending more and getting less every year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there have been new mission requirements. There was no Cyber Command back in 1984, space-based resources were more limited, and the U.S. intelligence community has grown significantly, particularly since September 11, 2001, with much of the budget embedded in Department of Defense (DoD) accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the primary reason why this United States is spending more and getting less is there has been far too little fundamental modernization of the DoD organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Congress passed the hugely important Goldwater-Nichols reform legislation in 1986, which fundamentally transformed and improved the warfighting capabilities of the DoD. At that time, Congress presumed that wars would be fought through the regional combatant commands — European Command, Central Command, Pacific Command, and Southern Command. But the United States does not fight wars through the unified commands. Today the country establishes joint task forces to conduct actual combat operations, yet the formal structure of regional combatant commands and sub-unified commands has remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YYyQEpF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Defense Spending Comparison.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Congressional Record, 98th Cong. 2nd Sess., September 27, 1984, p. 27426; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://comptroller.defense.gov/portals/45/documents/defbudget/fy2024/fy24_green_book.pdf&quot;&gt;Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), National Defense Budget Estimates for FY 2024 (Washington, DC: Department of Defense, May 2023)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two headquarters staffs in the Pentagon — the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Staff of the Joint Chiefs. Neither staff fights wars, except against each other in conference rooms. These two staffs largely parallel each other, with little value added for the redundancy. And both have grown hugely over 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty years ago, American business removed the institutional barriers between warehouse and transportation functions. Now the private sector seamlessly manages goods, whether they are located on a truck in transit, in a warehouse in stockpiles, in vendor inventories, or on supermarket shelves. The DoD has made only tiny progress in adopting streamlined operations for matériel support. The last real reform occurred over 30 years ago when some administrative functions (such as finance and accounting) were removed from the military departments and placed in expanded defense agencies. Still, ancient business practices persist with astounding inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress has periodically legislated reforms on the DoD, but the result has been a larger, more cumbersome bureaucracy. The number of Senate-confirmed positions has grown from 47 (excluding the trustees of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences) to 66 over the past 38 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procurement costs have also soared, while the quantities of kit being delivered have shrunk. Enormous sums are required for overhead functions. The result is that the country has accommodated soaring costs by shrinking the size of its military forces and buying less-modern equipment for operating units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no question that the United States needs to retain a strong and capable military force. But the current trend is not a viable path. It needs serious reform and faces hard choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress also needs to scale back the astounding micromanagement it imposes on the DoD. The National Defense Authorization Act in 1985 was 169 pages. In FY 2023, the annual authorization act was over 1,770 pages. There has been an explosion in the size of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees. In 1985, there were 18 senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Today there are 25. The House Armed Services Committee grew from 44 to 59 over the same period. More members inherently mean more congressional staff, resulting in ever-greater micromanagement of the DoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of greater impact, Congress blocks needed efficiencies proposed by the DoD. Congress refuses to close surplus and unneeded facilities, to rationalize its extended laboratory system, or to shut down or streamline depots and arsenals. Congress will often stipulate that a military department must continue to operate an obsolete weapon system in order to preserve activity at bases in members’ congressional districts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DoD is certainly responsible for inefficient use of resources, but Congress equally shares blame for massive waste of resources through micromanagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should continue to support a significant military establishment and sustain forward basing and operations of U.S. forces as an essential element of U.S. security strategy. But extending current activities and practices will erode U.S. capabilities over time. The United States now needs a fundamental management streamlining of the DoD. Congress should lead the way by cutting the size of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees by 50 percent and cutting the staff on the defense committees by a similar amount. Fewer people will lead to less micromanagement. Congress should commission a nonpartisan commission of experts and former members of Congress to identify fundamental streamlining opportunities for the DoD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shaping-the-international-environment-to-favor-national-goals&quot;&gt;Shaping the International Environment to Favor National Goals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second element of the Cold War strategy is still relevant, but there is less consensus on its content. In the early days of the Cold War era, the United States sought to create a network of institutions that would establish global norms of behavior and expectations. These global norms were fundamentally favorable to American interests and included principles such as the rule of law, stable and convertible currencies, the relaxation of barriers to commerce and investment, due process in judicial and administrative proceedings, the prioritization of peaceful dispute resolution and diplomacy, and a normative bias toward representative government and the rights of citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to pause at this point and reflect more directly on the purpose of creating international institutions and norms. The French philosopher Henri Bergson is credited for once saying (my wording) man invents ideas, but institutions sustain them. The purpose of creating institutions is to establish the sustaining framework that embodies the policy goals and norms desired to be implemented by a government, and to teach those norms to rising generations through the work of those institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States took the lead to create institutions such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and United Nations as well as the UN agencies, regional development banks, security alliances, and bilateral treaties. This was all done for the same purpose: to shape the future in ways that would make it easier to achieve American interests. America’s leaders believed that the interests of other countries would be served by these institutions as well. But the United States did not create them or support them because of some detached nobility of sentiment. It created them because they would help the United States achieve its national goals. Fortunately, what was excellent for the United States also proved good for the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is especially important for a global superpower. Most countries — including other great powers — have numerous interests, some in tension with other interests. But no country has the same span of interests as the United States. It is very hard for a global superpower to provide the focus and intellectual capacity required to manage dozens of challenging developments. Having a network of international institutions shaped generally around U.S. political values is enormously beneficial to the country’s national goals. Many of these problems can be managed primarily within an institutional framework that is favorable to American values, but without requiring intense American involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By definition, any international treaty and treaty-based institution does constrain sovereign flexibility to varying degrees. Historically, the United States has managed this in several different ways. The first, obviously, is to not agree to join the organization or sign the agreement. The United States has refused to join the International Criminal Court because of concern that third parties would turn the court against the United States for a political agenda. The United States has also refused to sign treaties that would be beneficial to U.S. interests — such as the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Ideological opposition tracing back 40 years continues to stymie ratification of a treaty that becomes more important every year. But abstinence is the default choice in the face of controversy. The second option involves some form of a “sovereign immunity” clause that allows the signatory parties to uphold core fundamental interests of their nations. But the third and most common way that sovereign states have protected their interests is to design the relevant international institution in such a way that its powers are inherently weak and cannot threaten core national interests. We see this vividly in the UN Security Council. The United States and other World War II powers ensured their flexibility by giving themselves permanent veto rights over any action proposed in the council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent years have brought a new phenomenon. The United States has participated in drafting treaties, only to then decide not to enter into the treaty for domestic political reasons. Presidential administrations state that they will observe the conditions of the treaty, but the Senate opts not to ratify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While nations craft ways to preserve their sovereign flexibility when they join treaty-based international institutions or enter into treaties, the point remains that we ratify treaties and join international organizations because there is more benefit than risk in the work of the institution. Countries join treaties and treaty-based organizations that constrain independent national flexibility because those rules also constrain the flexibility of other countries, which is perceived to have greater value in the long run than any perceived loss of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;alliances-partnerships-and-international-organizations&quot;&gt;Alliances, Partnerships, and International Organizations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed earlier, America set out on a course after World War II that it had previously avoided. The United States entered treaty-based alliances, bilateral security agreements, and treaty-based international organizations. The impulse was not based on romantic idealism or philanthropy. America created these structures to shape the international environment, bending issues into predetermined channels where we had support from others to deal with the problem. Below, we will examine each of these dimensions of structured international engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE RISE OF STANDING INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern agenda of creating more effective international institutions accelerated in the years after World War II. America and allied countries anticipated the collapse of the previous European-based international order. The United States invited allied countries before D-Day to participate in a series of conferences to create a new international finance structure. The purpose was to facilitate the reconstruction of war-damaged economies, to establish a durable framework for stable exchange rates for international commerce, and to create a framework for helping the economic development of former colonies that gained independence following the collapse of the old European imperial system. Remembering the trauma of the global recession following World War I and the dreadful political consequences that emerged during that time, the Bretton Woods system envisioned a world of open markets, reduced barriers to trade, and international mechanisms to assist in the resolution of national financial crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-2-multinational-governance&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BOX 2 Multinational Governance&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Multinational governing institutions are a relatively new innovation. The first functional international institutions were the International Telegraph Convention in 1865 and the Universal Postal Convention in 1874. The first International Sanitary Conference in 1851 was Europe’s effort to prevent the spread of cholera and other infectious diseases following the opening of the Suez Canal. Still, it took four decades to produce a more permanent framework for public health.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and U.S. allies launched a parallel effort to replace the ineffective League of Nations. On April 25, 1945 — before the formal end of the war, but with victory in sight — 50 nations met in San Francisco to start the process of drafting a charter for the United Nations. A core dilemma challenged the drafters of the UN Charter: Should the structure of the United Nations be built around the practical power reality of the day, or should it be designed to promote the world we wanted to create? The League of Nations failed because it could not balance the practical power dynamics of the interwar period with the idealism codified in the league’s charter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drafters sought to accomplish both goals. The UN Security Council was organized around the practical power dynamics of the day. The major wartime allies were given permanent veto authority over any matter brought before the Security Council. Idealism informed the creation of the General Assembly, where all countries had equal standing. Individual countries and groups of countries could stimulate a focus on a topic of interest. The structure of the United Nations sought to balance the world as it existed with the world that leaders wanted to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been consistent arguments for reforming the UN Security Council. Most countries naturally resent the permanent veto rights given to the victors of a war concluded nearly 80 years ago. While the United States and China represent leading powers today, the other three permanent members have declined in global power. Still, their positions as permanent members of the Security Council ensure that they will not tolerate a dilution of their status. Any meaningful reform is unlikely in the near term (see Box 3). Presently, the Security Council is significantly frozen because of the war in Ukraine and growing tensions between authoritarian powers such as Russia and China and their Western counterparts such as the United States, United Kingdom, and France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-3-challenges-to-reforming-the-un-security-council&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BOX 3 Challenges to Reforming the UN Security Council&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Efforts to reform the UN Security Council started in 1993. The G4 countries — Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan — have pushed to become permanent members because of their considerable economies and regional influence. A group of countries informally called the Coffee Club opposed the G4 and proposed instead to restructure the Security Council on the basis of regional representation. The African Union has proposed that two African states be made permanent members, though individual African states cannot agree on which two should be given those privileges. In short, regional and international rivalries continue to confound any serious effort to reform the body.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Growing Ambivalence about the United Nations and the UN System&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is considerable ambivalence within American political circles about the United Nations, there are important functions undertaken by the UN system which Americans need and value:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing political problems in the absence of a functioning government:&lt;/strong&gt; While the United States has not used the United Nations in this capacity in recent years, one of the body’s valuable functions is to step in to serve as the provisional administrative authority when countries or regions lack a coherent government entity. The deterioration of governance in Haiti is a good example of where this function has been used.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undertaking peacekeeping operations when core U.S. interests are not at stake:&lt;/strong&gt; Presently, there are 12 UN peacekeeping operations around the world. The United States contributes funding and some administrative support to these operations, but largely they are executed by forces contributed from other countries operating under a UN Security Council mandate (see Table 2).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping to establish standards for international commercial activity:&lt;/strong&gt; The United Nations has several agencies that provide a global forum for important activities that require explicit international standards. For example, the World Intellectual Property Organization works to facilitate protection of intellectual property throughout the world and to harmonize national legislation when there is disagreement. The International Civil Aviation Organization coordinates global standards for safety, environmental preservation, security, and operational efficiency for worldwide commercial aviation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coordinating international response to natural disasters and humanitarian need:&lt;/strong&gt; The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) operates the world’s largest healthcare delivery organization, administering over 2 billion vaccinations annually to low-income countries and communities. The World Health Organization took the lead in helping African countries deal with the recent Ebola virus outbreaks. The Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme deliver critical food to countries enduring famine or war-related food insecurity. While criticized in the United States for its ambivalence during the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization remained the only authoritative source of advice and support for the vast majority of lower-income countries in the world. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) mobilizes aid for and supports crisis-affected communities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Securing nuclear activity:&lt;/strong&gt; The International Atomic Energy Agency sets standards for safety and security for civilian facilities around the world and is a fundamental monitoring agency to detect the diversion of commercial nuclear resources for covert development of nuclear weapons (see discussion in Chapter 5).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are examples of activities undertaken by international institutions that are valuable to the United States. Not all UN agencies are uniformly helpful, but they serve an important function that benefits America’s security, economy, and society. As a nation, the United States would struggle to sustain the pace and rhythm of modern life and manage a wide range of second-tier problems without the United Nations and its agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stronger U.S. Support — and Stronger Oversight — for the United Nations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost from the outset, the United Nations was beset with great power competition and controversy. But in recent years, America’s enthusiasm for the United Nations has waned dramatically. Giving Cuba the chairmanship of the UN Human Rights Council struck most Americans as absurd and offensive. For many years, the United Nations considered resolutions condemning Israel over its treatment of Palestinians. The United States often had to veto these resolutions, which contributed to growing disenchantment with the United Nations in U.S. political circles. This has only become far more intense now with the ongoing war in Gaza. The UN system has become a platform for amplifying the agenda of nongovernmental organizations, many with a goal of forcing change on U.S. stances on foreign relations. This has fueled the critique that the United Nations threatens U.S. sovereignty. And there are frequent reports of abusive behavior by UN peacekeeping forces toward civilian populations. All of these problems have contributed to a significant deterioration in support for the United Nations among American political figures. These criticisms are valid, but they do not negate the value of having a functioning organization that can coordinate needed international collaboration when it is directly or indirectly affecting American interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that the United Nations and the wider UN agency system have considerable legitimacy and moral authority around the world, both to governments and individuals. While the United Nations may not enjoy high standing in the United States, it is highly regarded around the world. The United States’ strained relationship with the United Nations wins the country no admiration in these nations and capitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has made a major push to become a leader within the UN system. It has sought leadership roles in major UN agencies and contributes thousands of peacekeeping soldiers to UN operations while the United States contributes almost none. Table 3 below shows the top 10 state contributors of personnel to UN peacekeeping operations as of 2022. China is 10th in the world. The United States, with 30 staff officers and 3 experts on mission, ranks 78th. The United Nations has been a major channel through which China has projected its claims to better represent the interests of developing countries. China is on the march within the UN system, while the United States is often observing from the sidelines, occasionally booing the play of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Nations does offer significant benefits to the United States. But there are legitimate questions about its efficiency and the accountability of UN leaders and agencies. The United States should continue to support the United Nations, but it should also take a larger role in leading UN deliberations. In exchange, the United States needs greater accountability of UN leaders and operations to restore credibility that the United Nations is worthy of U.S. support. The United States should join other like-minded countries to demand a stronger process of performance reviews and assessments of UN activities. The United Nations needs an independent inspector general function that reports to the Security Council, not just the secretary general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should strengthen its work through the United Nations but demand new structures to evaluate the effectiveness of UN agencies and personnel. This should include the creation of an independent inspector general, reporting directly to the Security Council. The G7 countries should jointly establish performance standards for the new inspector general structure and issue biennial reports on the efficacy of the office.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADAPT AND STRENGTHEN ALLIANCES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries join security alliances for varying reasons. It might be to draw more strength to manage a core problem facing the country. It may be to strengthen another country whose security is judged essential to its own national interests. It might be to present a more complex security challenge to an opponent. The reasons vary, but they all share a common attribute: treaty-based security alliances are designed to provide strategic depth for a country. The United States joined or created military alliances after World War II because the agreements added strategic depth to our sovereign power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a second common reason for security alliances. These structures are normative, creating a framework for a shared agenda of security-related political objectives. The framework developed by one generation of leaders carries over to succeeding generations so long as the conditions attendant to the treaty remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was evident in the way NATO responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Even though Ukraine was not a signatory member of NATO, Europe collectively saw the risk posed to the continent if Russian aggression was not countered. The NATO treaty gave structure and coherence to the deliberations before and following the invasion and led to an aligned response across the spectrum of European politics and priorities. The compelling attributes of NATO led both Finland and Sweden to seek membership. Nearly 75 years after the founding of NATO, national leaders today understand the structure of defense and the values of the alliance because of the normative qualities of standing treaties. And again, for emphasis, the NATO treaty provides strategic depth for all signatories, and especially for the United States. America’s primary security priority today focuses on Asia and managing the rise of China as a superpower. NATO makes it possible for America to make decisive contributions in Europe while sustaining its strategic focus in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine also highlights yet again the relatively weak defense capabilities of European countries. European countries have generously donated combat equipment to Ukraine, but few of the weapons have been accompanied by spare parts or maintenance equipment. Munition stocks are thin. European defense establishments still devote excessive percentages of resources to parochial infrastructure, such as national training establishments, parallel command headquarters, and redundant acquisition establishments. The United States still must provide the integrating structure and impetus for collective action by NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Retool NATO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is gratifying to see the focus and energy in Europe on defense matters, now is the time to undertake serious retooling of NATO. At the end of the Cold War, NATO shifted its focus to preparing and integrating new member states. The political dimension of NATO grew, and warfighting preparedness declined. When Russia invaded Crimea, there were no operational war planners in NATO headquarters. The regional war-fighting headquarters had been disestablished. There were no operational command structures between the NATO operational headquarters and a battalion in the field. Since 2014, America and European partners have undertaken strong efforts to put muscle tone back into NATO. These organizational and operational investments have been crucial in the current effort to support Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine now highlights the underlying strategic premise of NATO: it is a collective security alliance designed for unified action against a direct threat to members of the alliance. The only direct threat to NATO comes from a revanchist Russia. Clearly now there are four primary theaters of combat facing NATO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforcing Finland primarily and the Nordic states secondarily&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Securing the Baltic Sea for unfettered NATO operations and commercial navigation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reinforcing the central frontline states (primarily Poland, the Baltic states, and possibly Ukraine in the future) against a ground invasion&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing effective air and missile defenses for all of Europe&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO now needs to realign its operational command structure around these four theaters of operation. In addition, NATO needs a serious restructuring of the support mechanisms required for combat operations. This would include a NATO-wide logistics and transportation command, a NATO-wide training organization for advanced combat and combat support training, and a NATO-wide command to manage test-and-training ranges and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently individual countries largely make solo decisions about procurement priorities and organizational competencies. There is no blueprint for what the European side of NATO needs for capabilities and where it stands in providing those capabilities through the efforts of individual member nations. The European component of NATO needs organizational rationalization as well as a blueprint to guide forward plans and investments by individual countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: NATO should establish four new operational command headquarters for the four primary security theaters of operation, and it should create new NATO-wide commands for vital combat support functions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While NATO is inherently valuable as an operational collective security structure, it is especially important because America’s strategic security focus has shifted to Asia. Back in 2011, President Obama directed a strategic security review in light of the budget agreement with congressional Republicans to cut back on defense spending as part of a broader agreement to constrain federal budgets. At the conclusion of that review, President Obama proposed a “pivot to Asia.” He was then criticized because while the pivot was welcome, there was no subsequent buildup of forces in Asia. This policy shift was made in the context of plans for major defense budget reductions. President Obama basically committed to preserve U.S. military strength and operational pace in the Pacific while cutting back on military activities in Europe and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The salient importance of this pivot was not recognized at the time. It was the first time in American history when the U.S. government said that Asia, not Europe, was the country’s highest security priority. This remains true, despite active U.S. support of Ukraine through NATO. The war in Ukraine would have been far more challenging for the United States had the framework of NATO not been in place to share the burden of reinforcing Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are things that can and should be done to strengthen NATO further. European defense ministries are still woefully underpowered because so much of their budgetary resources are devoted to purposes such as redundant headquarters, training establishments, and acquisition bureaucracies. Collectively, European NATO partners have spoken for years about rationalization, pooling, and sharing of resources. But very little has been done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ demand for modernizing NATO must go beyond hectoring European countries to spend more money. There needs to be a concrete blueprint for what the European element of NATO can and should become in the future. Rather than just tuck into various areas of American-led forces, Europe needs a coherent integrated defense capability. And that can come only through serious rationalization of defense contributions, consistent with a blueprint that would produce a coherent integrated European defense establishment. This should be the current focus, using the recent experience of Russian aggression as a yardstick for measuring how well European defense forces could manage an invasion like that experienced by Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should demand that European NATO countries develop a comprehensive plan for an integrated defense capability that can accomplish the four tasks noted above. The United States should provide technical support as needed, but Europe needs to develop its side of the alliance and build a self-standing defense capability, with the United States playing a reinforcing role.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;U.S. PARTNERSHIPS IN ASIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defense in Asia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Korean War globalized the great security standoff with the Soviet Union. The victory of the Chinese Communist Party in 1949, followed by the Korean War, convinced American government leaders at the time that communism was on the march and that Asia needed a collective security structure like NATO. In September 1954, the United States and seven other countries created the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Tellingly, five of the eight countries — Australia, France, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States — were primarily culturally European. Both the Philippines and Thailand were treaty partners to the United States, and Pakistan joined primarily to seek support in its standoff against India. Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam were given presumed military protection through a protocol instrument but were never formally part of SEATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATO had no organic roots in Southeast Asia, despite its name. It lacked geographical propinquity. The central organizing concept was alignment against the Soviet Union and China, which led as many countries to eschew membership as to join. Pakistan pulled out in 1973, South Vietnam was defeated in 1975, and SEATO formally ended in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the United States was developing deeper security structures with Japan and South Korea on a bilateral basis, which met with greater success. The threat posed by China was more immediate, and the United States had opportunities to create a much wider range of contact points with both countries than it did with Southeast Asian countries. The Korean War caused the United States to retain significant conventional combat forces in Japan and South Korea and pushed it to focus on developing the domestic political structures of both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security ties with Japan and South Korea were important, but even more important was the way both countries would develop powerful, vibrant economies that generally embraced U.S.-European geoeconomic norms. America kept significant military forces in both countries as part of the larger security structure designed to manage the rise of China in Asia. Initially, the United States had a containment strategy for China, but that shifted dramatically with President Nixon’s outreach to China, which was accelerated by China’s decision in 1978 to drop a policy of autarky and instead open its economy to global markets and global investments. The security dimension of the U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea relationship remained relevant, but the transition within China following the economic reforms shifted the focus to economic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America needed both Japan and South Korea as major components of its security architecture. This was complicated by the tensions that remained between them, significantly because of Japan’s brutal occupation of the Korean Peninsula prior to and through World War II. Most recently, the Biden administration has demonstrated considerable skill in creating a working trilateral relationship. The rise of a more pugnacious China, the continued bellicosity of North Korea, and the election of pragmatic politicians as prime minister and president respectively in Japan and South Korea with prominent security agendas have led to landmark structures of closer collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quadrilateral Security Dialogue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Asia remains a theater where security arrangements represent networks of relationships, but with no overarching security structure like NATO. The most important recent development is the establishment of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, most commonly called the Quad. The Quad is comprised of four countries — Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. It was initially proposed by Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo back in 2007 in conversation with Australian prime minister John Howard, Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, and U.S. vice president Dick Cheney. The idea languished for a decade as political sentiments shifted in Australia, India, and Japan. In 2017, three new leaders plus Abe again committed to support the Quad dialogue, stimulated by concerns over Chinese island building in the South China Sea. Started during the Trump presidency, the Quad picked up momentum under President Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Quad is not and will never be a security treaty, despite China’s loud complaint that it is a mini-NATO. There is no geographical propinquity to the Quad, and each country has wide-ranging political and economic priorities that are at times in tension with each other. The unifying feature of the Quad, however, is a concern about a rising, more pugnacious China and the need for coordination to counter Chinese political and military intimidation in the region. The Quad will also likely never grow into a larger group. The unstated but obvious purpose of the Quad is to counter China. No other country in the region wants to join the Quad, knowing it will unleash intense pressure from China. There is no need for more members. Each of the four members of the Quad brings its own networks of diplomacy, commercial ties and mutual support agreements with other countries in the region. The Quad is primarily a network of networks providing reassurance and stability in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Void: The Lack of an American Trade Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much of the security framework architecture for Asia is in place, there is a gaping void with the absence of a real American trade policy for the region. For most countries in Asia, foreign policy is trade policy. The value of a comprehensive trade policy for Asia is that it becomes the backbone of a rules-based international system of mutual interest and support (see Box 4). In 2006, four small economies in the Pacific region developed an economic framework that expanded to become the most ambitious trade agreement in recent times. In 2009, the United States joined this process and sought to use its leverage to create higher standards and a broader structure for the agreement. What emerged was the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which President Obama formally endorsed in the spring of 2016. Opposition in Congress (Republicans did not want to give President Obama a victory, and Democrats were cowed by opposition from labor unions and environmentalists) prevented ratification during the Obama administration. President Trump subsequently withdrew from the treaty on January 23, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;box-4-from-tpp-to-cptpp&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BOX 4 From TPP to CPTPP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In 2006, four countries across the Indo-Pacific developed a trade agreement to bring their economies closer together. The four countries — Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore — established an agreement lowering trade barriers and increasing interconnection. The agreement showed benefits, and soon other countries expressed interest in joining. By 2009, eight additional countries sought to join, creating new pressures and challenges to reaching agreement. To work through those issues, negotiations began on what became known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP, negotiated between 2009 and 2016, brought together 12 countries from North and South America, Asia, and Oceania, in what was intended as one of the world’s largest free trade agreements. The other 11 countries (beyond the United States) collectively represented the largest bloc of exports from the United States to the rest of the world. Proponents of the agreement argued that it would result in more than 1 percent annual growth for participating countries. Within the United States, this could have amounted to approximately $131 billion in increased annual income, additional jobs, and increased U.S. exports up to $357 billion annually by 2030.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The TPP was more than a trade agreement. It also represented a geopolitical effort to establish a new standard for international trade that raised the bar in a range of areas such as environmental and labor standards, requiring countries to reach those standards before entry. This was important because it was increasingly clear to countries around the world by 2016 that China was backsliding on its World Trade Organization (WTO) accession commitments to make progress toward a range of WTO standards. Even though it was backsliding, China represented too large a share of companies’ profits for countries to threaten meaningful consequences to China for noncompliance with its commitments.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Within the United States, however, the TPP faced significant opposition. The academic community was not uniform in its support. Several studies showed that the TPP may actually have resulted in a loss of jobs and a reduction in GDP due to trade dislocation. With negotiations only establishing the final text in 2016, the crucial push to sign and ratify the agreement would have had to come in the middle of a presidential election campaign. President Obama’s public position on the TPP was tepid. Republicans in Congress were disinterested in providing a political “win” to Obama and the Democratic Party amid an election season. Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders expressed opposition to the TPP on the campaign trail. Then candidate Donald Trump pledged to withdraw from the TPP on “day one” of his administration. Only two days into his administration, he made good on that commitment and withdrew the United States from the TPP, effectively killing the effort for all parties because the rules of the agreement would come into force.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The remaining 11 countries that had negotiated the TPP, however, were unwilling to let their own benefits fall by the wayside because of a U.S. decision. Under leadership from Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo, the TPP-11, as they came to be known, reconvened and negotiated a similar agreement, this time called the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This agreement came into force for the first signatories on December 30, 2018, and an additional six countries have applied for membership. Among those countries, the United Kingdom has been granted membership, and China, Taiwan, and Ukraine have all applied for membership.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the United States withdrew from the TPP, the agreement was not ratifiable under its existing terms. The late prime minister Abe saw an opportunity for Japan to play a larger leadership role in Asia. Japan took the lead, using the bulk of the TPP agreement as the basis for a streamlined version relabeled as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). For Abe, even without U.S. participation, the CPTPP was important for setting rules for trade that were not based on a Sino-centric view. Presidents Trump and Biden have since ignored it, and the United States remains outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to criticism that it lacked a trade policy, the Biden administration has proposed something called the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). The title reveals its true nature. IPEF is just a framework, outlining the conditions that the United States will insist upon in discussing trade matters with other Asian countries. Asian partners and allies have met IPEF with a polite yawn. Asian countries believe IPEF offers few tangible benefits. They are willing to engage the United States through IPEF, believing that this is as much as the United States can muster these days. And while there are small steps forward within the IPEF framework, for all practical purposes the United States has no real trade policy for Asia. This is a theater where trade policy is he foundation for foreign policy. The sad irony is that the Biden administration often champions an international rules-based order as its strategic objective. That was what the TPP was and now the CPTPP is. But it is not something the Biden administration will now champion or support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States needs to either join the CPTPP agreement or implement elements of it to become a partner in regional trade dynamics in Asia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-prosper-as-a-people&quot;&gt;To Prosper as a People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second paragraph of the Declaration of Independence states clearly the purpose of the U.S. government, specifically enshrining the goals of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” The pursuit of happiness sounds a bit superficial, but fundamentally it means the government should enhance the well-being and prosperity of its citizens. This forms the second great element of our national strategy framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unites States has not done badly over the past 50 years. In 1970, the income per capita was a little less than $26,000 (expressed in constant 2015 dollars). By 2021, this figure exceeded $60,000, far higher than the world average of around $11,000 as shown in the figure below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to other countries, the United States started with a remarkable set of advantages — a large landmass with very productive agricultural resources, abundant mineral and energy resources, long coastlines on two oceans with good harbors, relatively temperate climatic conditions, and a tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world. Many of America’s strengths are also grounded in decisions made — and sustained — by governments and institutions over time. The United States remains a world leader in university-level education, with top-notch businesses, strong government and nongovernmental institutions, and a dynamic civil society. And the United States retains the most capable military in the world. Each of these attributes of power has contributed to — and derived benefits from — growing prosperity in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growing and diverse population:&lt;/strong&gt; By 2053, the United States is projected to reach a population of more than 370 million, up from 336 million in 2023. About 75 percent of that growth, or about 25.5 million people, is projected to come from net immigration. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group of the next 40 years will be people who are “Two or More Races,” suggesting that tomorrow’s Americans will more accurately represent the long-held concept of America as a melting pot. Perhaps as important, tomorrow’s Americans may be better positioned to move within and among global cultures, leveraging America’s diversity as a strength in both diplomacy and business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A world-leading innovation ecosystem:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States remains a world leader with its innovation ecosystem. Arguably, much of that strength starts with the United States’ university system. Global rankings indicate that 39 of the world’s top 100 universities are in the United States, including 17 public universities. The strength of America’s educational institutions translates into a high level of education among Americans. About half of Americans aged 25 to 64 have post-secondary degrees, up from 42 percent in 2010. The education Americans receive enables them to tackle more complicated and sophisticated challenges. Within the United States, approximately $656 billion goes toward research and development every year. Of that, the government share is 22 percent. Finally, the strength of the U.S. innovation ecosystem is globally recognized. The United States is the top destination for foreign patent filers; more non-residents file for patents in the United States than residents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A top-notch business environment:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States remains the strongest consumer and capital market in the world. It provides a high-standards, relatively low-cost business environment for firms. Fifty-nine of the world’s 100 largest firms are in America, with the United States holding 65 percent of total market value, equal to more than $20 trillion. This is more than four times the number of leading companies based in China and four times their market capitalization. There are over 33 million small businesses in the United States, which employ more than 61 million people. Approximately 3.2 million businesses are immigrant owned, employing more than 8 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A vibrant and thriving civil society:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States retains a vibrant and dynamic civil society spanning nonprofits, social support organizations, and religious institutions. There are more than 1.6 million registered charities in the United States. Donations to those charities consistently account for approximately 2 percent of GDP and support approximately 10 percent of the U.S. labor force. Individual contributions provided 64 percent of the support to charities in 2022. This broad spectrum of organizations enables U.S. society to adapt and adjust relatively quickly to shocks, including natural disasters and sudden migration flows, or to better understand the impact of changing laws and policies. Few other countries have such a strong network of civil society organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, these advantages have helped America become an economic powerhouse. Today, it constitutes 25 percent of global GDP (not adjusted for purchasing power parity) despite accounting for only 4 percent of the world’s population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-progress-is-very-uneven-in-america-today&quot;&gt;Economic Progress Is Very Uneven in America Today&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aggregate data suggests that America has done very well over the past seven decades. But aggregate data such as income per capita masks a far more complex reality, as shown below with data as of October 2023:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The top 10 percent of households by wealth held 69 percent of total household wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The bottom 50 percent of households collectively held only 2.54 percent of total household wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Black and Hispanic families owned only a quarter of the wealth of white families on average.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Families headed by someone with only a high school education had only 22 percent of the wealth of families headed by a graduate from a four-year college or university.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Families headed by someone with less than a high school diploma had only 10 percent of the wealth of families headed by a college graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A portion of Americans are born with advantages well beyond the reach of the majority of citizens. The gap between upper-class and lower-class cadres is widening. People who work with their hands find the wind in their faces. People who work with their minds find the wind at their backs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strengthening America’s Economy Starts with Addressing the Income Gap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, the gap in annual income between high-income workers and medium- and low-income workers has widened significantly. And this has become a major dimension of the United States’ domestic political debate. As was said pointedly in the days during and after the recession of 2009, “blue collar workers lost their jobs and bankers lost their bonuses.” We see a widening gap in incomes between urban centers with high concentrations of “mind workers” and rural and rust-belt America where more workers work with their hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A widening income and wealth gap matters from a macroeconomic perspective. Flat incomes for the bulk of workers limits their capacity to consume. Soaring incomes of well-compensated workers esult in savings that need to find a channel for investment. The past 30 years of globalization and the opening of the vast Chinese labor market have created enormous disparities in the United States. Competing against 400 million hungry Chinese workers, blue-collar American workers have struggled. Returns to labor have remained flat in real terms. Returns to capital — moving the unconsumed savings of highly compensated individuals — have soared, particularly due to new investment opportunities in Asia. Yes, blue-collar workers have benefited from cheap T-shirts and sneakers manufactured in China, but the widening income gap has also delivered stagnant wages and dying neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has contributed to the great unresolved debate now underway in America about “fairness” in the economy. It was the foundation of the Biden administration’s Build Back Better agenda. In this agenda, progressives defined what they thought it would take to remove the barriers facing blue-collar workers. Conservatives saw it as a massive expansion of government bureaucracies and programs, and a return to redistribution politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report does not choose to enter this debate or take sides in it. It does, however, want to use it as a springboard for its first fundamental observation. America is a rich and prosperous nation, but the distribution of income now is limiting future growth. Roughly 70 to 75 percent of GDP goes to consumption. If wages for the bulk of American workers remain stagnant, future economic growth will be limited. Highly compensated workers end up investing their income in other countries where markets are growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of equal concern is the accumulation of massive deficits caused by our desire to spend more on government than we are prepared to pay through taxes. The federal government now has accumulated deficits exceeding $34 trillion. In addition, we need to add to this figure the over $34 trillion of unfunded commitments for entitlements, such as social security, government pensions, Medicare, and Medicaid. A modern and successful society should provide security for its population, but it also must pay these bills. At present, the United States is pushing these liabilities onto the shoulders of Americans’ children and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMMITTING TO A GROWTH STRATEGY FOR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America needs a new political commitment to economic growth. Progressives are more interested these days in economic justice than they are in economic growth. Progressives also believe economic growth threatens the environment. Conservatives, meanwhile, have become preoccupied with “woke capitalism.” Because the two political parties are so evenly balanced in Congress, the battles are endless and incremental. Strategically important issues fall victim to tactical posturing for temporary advantage in the next election. The Biden administration will argue, with justification, that the so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was designed to stimulate new jobs in the context of boosting renewable energy. The jury is still out on whether these incentives are sufficient to create the irreversible momentum needed to transform the fundamental position currently held by hydrocarbon energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress did pass, on a bipartisan basis, the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides financial support to boost manufacturing of semiconductors in the United States. The CHIPS Act also provides authorization for a wide range of much-needed support for U.S. universities, research institutes, and other elements of the ideas industry, but only the semiconductor provisions were funded. Still, the CHIPS Act does indicate that the United States can indeed undertake industrial policy on a bipartisan basis. It is doubtful that the CHIPS Act would have passed without the unifying fear of China as a geopolitical and geoeconomic competitor. But the CHIPS Act was authentically bipartisan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are welcome examples, but they are exceptions to the current political landscape. Neither political party has a coherent agenda to boost economic growth in America. Without a growing economy, the two political parties will be battling over a shrinking pie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: America now needs a coherent and well-developed strategy to expand the economy. Such a strategy must address income disparities to ensure growth is sustainable in the United States.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-liberal-conception-of-the-role-of-government&quot;&gt;The Liberal Conception of the Role of Government&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America is confronting a great competition with China. China has a profoundly different concept for the role of government in Chinese society. America’s concept traces back centuries, drawing heavily on ideas that emerged in the writings of French and English political philosophers as well as movements such as the Scottish Reformation. The purpose of government is to create the appropriate balance between the rights and liberties of individuals and the needs and responsibilities of society. This is best accomplished through a government structure with checks and balances. The best articulation of this is still found in the Federalist Paper No. 51, authored by James Madison: “The great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the other.” One element of the government can effectively stop the unilateral action of another branch. All must work together for a durable new policy direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In economic matters, the role of government is to ensure a fair and level playing field for the private sector. This requires multiple actions. The government must create and maintain a stable currency. It requires a system for protecting intellectual property that properly balances individual benefit and societal need. The government must establish a fair and transparent legal system based on due process, as well as a system for standardizing specifications for goods and services so that commerce can occur beyond a small neighborhood. In today’s world, this likely means that the government will have to take a greater role in cybersecurity, especially in developing solutions to ensure the authenticity of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this objective and transparent framework, the private sector is free and encouraged to operate based on perceived opportunity. Entrepreneurs will decide what new opportunities can be created. Customers will decide if they want these products or services, and at what price. Technologies advance and open new ideas and channels for entrepreneurs and potentially new products and services for customers. The marketplace decides winners and losers, not the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, our political leaders have changed and expanded the definition of what is required to provide a fair and level playing field. Abraham Lincoln felt that America’s future was limited without a significant boost in higher education sponsored by the government. To protect investors in financial markets, the government created the Securities and Exchange Commission. To protect consumers from exposure to adulterated food or dangerous products masquerading as drugs, the government created the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To ensure safe air transportation, the government created the Federal Aviation Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government plays a significant and vital role in modern American society by ensuring that the marketplace is fair, stable, and safe for consumers who otherwise could not protect themselves through their own agency. This has not been a conflict-free process. The government has expanded as problems were identified and possible solutions were explored and adopted. And political conflict carries on after the establishment of a new policy. In a representative government, conflicting perspectives must be reconciled through a legislative process where all parties have access to the representatives and senators who will ultimately decide what is needed. But the controversy does not end there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executive branch regulation is required to implement broad new legal policies, but this “rulemaking” process is always filled with tension and controversy. The politics that lead to the creation of a new government regulatory mandate invariably requires extensive and contentious rulemaking procedures for implementation. Aggrieved parties may take a judicial route to try to change the approach used to implement the legal mandate. And these issues will change as new economic or technological developments advance and require some adjudication in the regulatory process, and sometimes through judicial action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the controversy that accompanies government regulation, there is an important byproduct that has greatly benefited America. Quality government oversight creates value. Stringent regulation of financial markets and a strong judicial system have fundamentally made America’s financial markets attractive for investors worldwide. Stringent regulation of drugs and medical devices has effectively created a value premium for any U.S. product that is approved for sale by the FDA. Stringent air safety standards have made America the aviation leader of the world and ensured that U.S.-manufactured aircraft are valued around the world. High-quality regulations create high-value products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the modern administrative structure of the U.S. government has created enormous inefficiencies through elaborate processes and regulations. Regulatory burdens in the United States result in capital resources moving to other countries where it is easier to build factories and hire people. China has come to dominate the processing of critical and rare-earth metals because America raised environmental standards while China welcomed investment with little regard for the environment. But once these enormously capital-intensive investments have been made, long-term patterns of commerce are locked in. America’s current regulatory environment and culture of litigiousness has become a major factor that will inhibit returning mining and manufacturing to American soil. If America is going to compete more effectively in the future, it needs to streamline the regulatory burden presented to companies and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The government needs to undertake sustained streamlining of regulations, protecting essential goals while lowering the burdens of compliance. Special interest advocacy groups have created excessive ways to slow government deliberations. The Constitution stipulates that accused parties have a right to a speedy trial. This should apply to government regulatory reviews as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial-policy&quot;&gt;Industrial Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “industrial policy” was politicized when then president Jimmy Carter tried to boost his flagging popularity before reelection by formally launching a national industrial policy initiative. Candidate Ronald Reagan strongly condemned the idea, and from that moment, the term “industrial policy” has been burdened by politics. Over the past 40 years, “industrial policy” is routinely condemned, but the argument is superficial. In reality, America has always pursued sensible industrial policies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Abraham Lincoln, as a candidate, had two main pillars in his campaign platform. One called for government investment in infrastructure, and the second called for government spending on university education. He followed through, pushing legislation to create incentives to build the transcontinental railroad and encouraging the creation of the so-called land-grant universities that became the backbone of higher education in America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;General Dwight D. Eisenhower saw the power of the limited-access, high-speed autobahn road networks in Germany. He recalled his time in the Army in the 1930s, taking three months to move across the United States on poorly designed and constructed roads. When he became president, he pushed to create the Interstate Highway System.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Senator Pete Domenici, wanting to help support the Department of Energy’s nuclear labs in his state, pushed for funding in nuclear weapons labs for the first mapping of the human genome, a step that has completely revolutionized modern medicine and biological research.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense began developing the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) in the 1970s. While designed for the precision targeting of weapons systems, the GPS signal was offered to the public for commercial exploitation. GPS is now ubiquitous in American commerce. It not only makes ride-hailing services possible but is also used as a fundamental resource for synchronizing distributed computer systems, enabling activities such as using credit cards to pay for gasoline at self-serve stations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration initiated a series of public-private partnerships to boost quantum research and development. The Department of Energy funded the costs of these new quantum research centers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just examples of historic steps that America has taken with the explicit goal of creating incentives and structures to promote new economic opportunities and to ultimately enhance prosperity. The CHIPS Act is fully consistent with this rich history of shaping incentives for important new opportunities. These examples share a critical common dimension: American industrial policy generally funds the infrastructure of knowledge that cannot be built through market forces alone. No single company could afford to build a transcontinental railroad back in 1862. But once built, the railroads opened the vast heartland for countless opportunities, such as helping farmers get raw or semi-processed food to distant markets. Research on the genome in a nuclear weapons laboratory created part of the infrastructure that permitted the development of mRNA vaccines to manage the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the obvious need to develop a thoughtful national industrial policy strategy, the U.S. government is poorly suited to create it. Modern commerce and new technologies cut horizontally across the stovepipes of the cabinet departments and across the jurisdictions of congressional committees, which basically map (sometimes a bit incoherently) against the structure of the executive branch departments and agencies. Which cabinet department is responsible for AI? Which cabinet department should take the lead in shaping the realignment of global supply chains?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cutting-edge developments and opportunities do not fit neatly in the existing structures of the federal government. They come together only in the White House, but the White House is also the platform for one political party at any one time. Initiatives springing from the White House inherently carry political baggage. America needs a novel way to develop a national industrial and national security strategy. We need a national strategy for making strategic investments, both in the government and in the private sector. Development of that strategy should be sponsored by the U.S. government, but no members of the U.S. government (other than support staff ) should prepare it. A national commission should be appointed for a three-year period to develop a national strategy. Members of the commission would be nominated, half by the president and half by the Congress. All members would have to be confirmed by the Senate. (For administrative support, the commission should be supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.) The commission would be responsible for highlighting important new technological and societal developments that will have significant impact on future prosperity and security, as well as highlighting the gaps in American public and private resources regarding expertise on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Create a standing process for national-level commissions outside of government that would chart industrial policy ideas for consideration by the president and Congress.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthen-the-foundations-of-innovation-in-the-united-states&quot;&gt;Strengthen the Foundations of Innovation in the United States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States remains the world’s leading innovation power. To remain competitive in the future, the United States cannot simply assume today’s advantages will persist without continued investment. There are three areas where the United States can act in the near term to drive its competitive position forward: strengthening the U.S. role in standards setting, updating the patent system for the present day, and increasing the United States’ ability to attract and retain talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRENGTHENING AMERICA’S ROLE IN STANDARD SETTING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting standards to shape American commerce started at the very beginning of our country. To bring together 13 separate colonies into a coherent new government, our first leaders knew that a pound of flour in Virginia needed to weigh the same as a pound of flour in New York. Standard setting seems a simple and uninteresting topic. However, operating on common standards is what allows companies to sell products widely, and to innovate quickly. Explicit standards ensure that consumers reap the benefits of new ideas without being locked into one company’s products. With explicit standards, products can improve in an open competitive market. An example of critical standards that have helped transform the world comes from those that govern wireless communication protocols — no matter where you are or what device you own, connecting to Wi-Fi works the same. This standard did not happen randomly. It was developed through engagements between competing firms, policymakers, and academics working to develop a standard that maximized consumer benefit, streamlined production requirements, and met necessary safety standards for communications devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a cutting-edge issue that would benefit from concerns for global standards is the energy transition. Currently there are inadequate standards for measuring, reporting, and verifying greenhouse gases embedded in manufactured goods. The Department of Energy is already working on this front, and a canonical counting of carbon could become strategic high ground in a border-adjusted world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s global standards are the product of decades of American leadership and the astounding technological advancement of the past 50 years. China has seen the power of global standards and now seeks to gain leadership positions in global standards-setting organizations. Sujai Shivakumar, director of Renewing American Innovation at CSIS, notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s determination to dominate standards extends to controlling communications and discourse. Linking internet governance and standards, Chinese president Xi Jinping has stated that in cybersecurity and telecommunications, the “game of great powers is not only a game of technology but also a game of ideas and discourse power.” Developing standards for the digital economy therefore also requires reference to standards for political expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When new technology opens up new concepts for products or services, there is generally no accepted standard to guide commercial exploitation. For example, there is currently no set of standards for AI. Many governments, including China, India, the European Union, and the United States, are all embarking on efforts to begin regulating this new area of technology, though doing so before any standards are set can also create a balkanized world where standards become different in different markets, reducing efficiency and slowing innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America has a unique approach to standards setting. In the United States, the private sector sets the standards. The role of government is to recognize and enforce them and ensure that the standards are developed broadly within an industry. In China, setting standards is an explicit act of government control. In Europe, the European Union plays a very large role in shaping standards. Because America’s approach leaves it to the private sector, we face a challenging future if China comes to dominate standards-setting venues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To succeed in the emerging standards-setting competition, the United States will need bipartisan and consistent focus on resourcing standards-setting organizations and ensuring that the United States nominates strong and experienced leaders to these institutions, specifically including individuals capable of setting clear, achievable agendas and developing the necessary coalitions to succeed in setting standards that embody U.S. values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Congress should appropriate funds to the National Institute of Standards and Technology to provide financial support to academic experts, experts in innovative small companies, and consumer representatives to participate in international standards-setting conferences and processes. NIST will play no role in determining standards (other than for government-specific technologies) but will help identify and support private sector representatives to participate in international standards-setting venues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATING THE PATENT SYSTEM FOR THE PRESENT DAY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has always been a nation of inventors. An important aspect of U.S. competitiveness over the past 100 years has been the strength of the U.S. patent system. The patent system has sought to balance the interests of the inventor and the interests of consumers by allowing inventors to derive the sole benefit of their innovations for a set period of time. This system has propelled forward an ever-accelerating wave of creativity. The United States’ innovative spirit rests on a complex network of economic rules favoring market-based competition, predictable legal arrangements for patenting and securing intellectual property, and incentives for investors. For decades, the United States set the global pace on patents. Over the past 20 years, global innovators, especially in China, have closed the gap and, in some cases, exceeded U.S. patent output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the successful track record of the U.S. patent system, there are growing calls within the United States to fundamentally reform the patent system. In many cases, the proposals include decreasing or eliminating the duration of patent benefits, arguing that the duration of the exclusive use period of the current patent system stifles innovation by limiting access to new technology. If these so-called reforms reduce or eliminate the exclusive use window of a patent, the financial incentive to make the necessary investments to develop new technologies is effectively eliminated. The benefits of innovating will be eclipsed by the ability to rapidly copy emerging technology. Only China would benefit from such an approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the intersection of standards and patents are standard essential patents (SEPs), patents that form the basis of industry standards and allow both consumers and a broader array of firms to participate in innovation. Common in a range of technologies, including telecommunications, wireless systems, the internet of things, and AI, SEPs are offered at terms determined to be fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (F/RAND). SEPs allow a company to develop and profit from a technology that becomes an industry standard without leveraging that position to eliminate its competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Ensuring that U.S. innovators can derive the benefits of their inventions has propelled the U.S. economy for more than 200 years. Ensuring the patent system remains robust will be critical to incentivizing entrepreneurs to stay focused on the U.S. market.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INCREASING THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN GLOBAL TALENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the final report of the CSIS Trade Commission on Affirming American Leadership, “The United States thrives when it invites the best and brightest from around the world to set up shop and contribute to the U.S. economy.” Yet immigration policy now is one of the most contentious issues facing the U.S. government, with very little consensus on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis below draws heavily on work undertaken by Remco Zwetsloot while he was a trustee fellow at CSIS; William Reinsch, Scholl Chair in International Business at CSIS; and his colleague Jack Caporal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of immigrants in the U.S. economy is often overlooked as a driver of both innovation and growth. As of 2021, there were 3.4 million immigrant entrepreneurs in the United States. As of 2017, immigrant-owned businesses employed 8 million people. Those businesses had cumulative sales of more than $1.3 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In innovation, immigrants to the United States also contribute at levels above their share of the population. According to a 2022 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, from 1990 to 2016, immigrants accounted for approximately 10 percent of the U.S. population but created approximately 16 percent of inventions, 23 percent of patents, and 24 percent of top patents. Altogether, they contributed more than 25 percent of market value of the firms benefiting from the patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, the United States sets aside 416,000 green cards for permanent immigrants. This allows non-citizens to live and work in the United States on an unlimited basis. Total green cards are subdivided into three groups: 226,000 for family-preference green cards; 140,000 for employment-based green cards, reserved for skilled workers as well as investors; and 50,000 “diversity” green cards for individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Not only are there numerical caps imposed on green cards every year, but there are country limits that preclude more than 7 percent of green cards every year going to one country. This has a major impact on green card applicants from countries such as India, China, the Philippines, and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is no longer recruiting foreign talent at the same pace as in earlier eras. From 2000 to 2016, foreign enrollment in U.S. universities doubled from 500,000 to over 1 million students. Growth slowed, beginning in 2016–17, and turned negative by 2019–20. The Covid-19 pandemic saw foreign enrollment drop by 15 percent, with only a modest rebound in 2021–22. In 2022, 54 percent of international students majored in science, technology, engineering, and medicine (STEM) programs. A large portion of foreign STEM students historically came from China, but the current tensions with China have had a dampening impact on Chinese students applying for admission to American universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to declining numbers of international students enrolling at U.S. universities, it is difficult for firms to hire foreign nationals, even if these individuals are highly qualified. The CSIS Trade Commission notes that “the H-1B visa is capped at 85,000 visas annually, despite consistently hitting the limit months before the deadline for companies to apply.” Further, visas are distributed by lottery, “discourag[ing] companies from hiring international students and foreign workers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of H-1B visas available has been steady since 2004. From 1999 to 2003, however, H-1B visa quotas were set at between 115,000 and 195,000 per year based on two laws passed in 1998 and 2000, respectively, the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act and the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States has an enduring asymmetric advantage over nearly every country, it is immigration. For centuries, the United States has drawn talented and ambitious people from all over the world. We see this today in U.S. universities and across the cutting-edge American economy. Innovation relies on access to the most talented people. For much of the twentieth century, the United States leveraged deep investment in domestic education and a pipeline of foreign talent to drive American innovation to new heights. As one CSIS expert put it: “The U.S. government risks squandering that advantage through poor immigration policy. Without significant reforms to STEM immigration, the United States will struggle to maintain long-term competitiveness and achieve near-term technology priorities such as semiconductor supply chain security, leadership in AI, and clean energy innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are entering a period of accelerating need for human talent. America’s immigration policy is heavily weighted toward reuniting families. Other countries, such as Canada, have an immigration policy focused on attracting highly educated and skilled migrants for entry into the workforce. Many countries adopt this practice and are making immigration rules more flexible to attract needed talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see large numbers of foreign students in American universities and graduate schools, but all of them are in the United States on student visas or limited work visas. There is no fast track to a green card for highly capable and desirable student visa holders. America’s high-tech industry has complained for many years about the constraints it faces due to the limited availability of H-1B visas. Recently, the congressionally chartered National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence called for a massive increase in educational training domestically in AI, as well as for a major program to recruit more AI talent from other countries. The United States is in a global competition for talent, and current U.S. immigration policies are a significant roadblock to competing internationally for this talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States maintains a bewildering number of visa categories for everything from an athlete coming to a competition in the United States, to temporary agricultural workers following seasonal harvest requirements, to physicians. This discussion focuses specifically on permanent immigrant workers (green card holders) and temporary non-immigrant visas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Congress should authorize the reuse of unused green cards, with priority given to employment-based applicants.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: Given the importance of innovation to economic growth and the outsized role immigrants play in driving innovation — particularly in high-tech fields — the United States should immediately expand H-1B visas back to 195,000 per year. The United States also should double the number of green card allotments, putting first priority on highly qualified technical talent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should explore ways to incentivize academic performance by foreign students, extending the length of time they are allowed to work on a J visa based on academic performance and contributions in fields judged to be crucial for future American productivity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;develop-a-dynamic-trade-policy&quot;&gt;Develop a Dynamic Trade Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2021, the CSIS Trade Commission on Affirming American Leadership issued a series of reports on why trade is vital for America’s future growth and strengthening America’s broader values in the world of international commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the latter half of the twentieth century, the United States championed the expansion of global trade as a means of advancing U.S. interests in growing its domestic economy and in expanding international markets for its goods. China’s rise, including both the expansion of China’s industrial labor force and its adroit navigation “between” World Trade Organization (WTO) rules pose significant challenges to the existing WTO-centered system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current system is far from perfect. It was developed at a time when issues such as the digital economy, climate change, and rent seeking by the world’s second-largest economy were hard to imagine. Dispute evaluation and resolution mechanisms now take longer than the market cycles they intend to correct. Reforms and updates are nearly impossible in a consensus-based organization comprising 164 members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than retreating from the WTO — and ceding standards setting there to China’s autocratic economic model — the United States should reinvigorate efforts to drive forward a WTO based on U.S. interests and advantages. These include transparency, fair and market-based competition, and common global rules for trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A road map exists for what the United States should do to reinvigorate trade in a manner consistent with U.S. values and domestic interests. It starts by working with a subset of like-minded countries to commit to a compact reflecting a more ambitious approach to trade rules, with the aim of bolstering rather than replacing the WTO. In addition to deepening trade ties, compact members should identify and implement means to counter non-market economic practices. Compact members should also engage in discussions on leveraging trade to reduce the impact of climate change and on “best practices to mitigate trade’s disruptive impact on workers and on trade’s potential to improve working conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should work to secure greater commitment from the WTO as an institution to impose penalties for non-compliance with existing WTO rules, and to reform and accelerate the dispute resolution mechanisms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: At home, the United States needs to bolster its domestic policy framework for resisting non-market economic actions from foreign actors — including China — while sustaining U.S. adherence to transparency, clearly applied standards, and consistent application of rules.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;competing-more-effectively-with-china-on-the-global-stage&quot;&gt;Competing More Effectively with China on the Global Stage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-of-us-foreign-assistance&quot;&gt;Overview of U.S. Foreign Assistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the Cold War, the United States well understood that it was in direct competition with the Soviet Union in presenting a development model to former European colonies around the world that had recently become independent states. America took comprehensive steps to strengthen its agenda in this global competition, including creating the United Nations and the Bretton Woods organizations like the World Bank. The United States also has created a range of institutions and programs at the federal level to help guide and support new leaders of young nations with weak economies and limited depth of talent for administering a country. The following list includes key U.S. institutions that have worked to develop stronger economies and more effective governments in developing countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL AID&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID):&lt;/strong&gt; USAID is an independent agency of the U.S. government with primary responsibility for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance. USAID’s budget for operating expenses and capital investment in FY 2023 was 2.08 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC):&lt;/strong&gt; The DFC provides financing and insurance for private companies developing economic projects in developing markets. The DFC underwrote $7.4 billion of projects in FY 2022 and currently administers over $9.3 billion of ongoing investments. The DFC returns a profit to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC):&lt;/strong&gt; Established in 2004, the MCC focuses on economic growth, poverty alleviation, and institution strengthening in low-income countries. Based on a rigorous, competitive application process, the MCC prioritizes creating sustainable impact in partner countries while delivering a return on investment for U.S. taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA):&lt;/strong&gt; The USTDA works to promote U.S. job creation through assisting U.S. firms to export goods and services for infrastructure projects in low-income countries. It funds feasibility studies, technical assistance, and pilot projects at early stages in foreign countries, better positioning partner countries to understand the advantages of working with U.S. firms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TALENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fulbright Program:&lt;/strong&gt; In FY 2020, the Fulbright Program sent more than 2,500 Americans overseas for research and teaching and brought more than 4,000 of the world’s brightest to the United States to study and engage. Over 75 years, the program has connected many thousands of people around the world to the United States and given Americans deeper understanding — and enduring relationship advantages — around the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OTHER PROGRAMS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peace Corps:&lt;/strong&gt; The Peace Corps was created in 1961 as a permanent federal agency within the State Department, and in 1981 it became an independent agency. It was established as a way to more actively involve Americans in the cause of global democracy, peace, development, and freedom. Since its inception, the Peace Corps has sent over 200,000 Americans to serve in 139 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Information Agency:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Information Agency was established in 1953 to promote U.S. messages abroad, especially into the Soviet Union and aligned countries. Many of its functions were consolidated into the U.S. Department of State, especially the undersecretary for public diplomacy, before the agency was closed in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Agency for Global Media:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Agency for Global Media oversees U.S.-funded programming abroad, including six media organizations, such as the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. In 2022, it reached a global audience of 410 million people weekly with programming in 63 languages, supported by an $885 million appropriation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the Department of Commerce and the Department of State have created major undersecretariats designed to promote American businesses working internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these various efforts have been successful. Generally, the world America wanted to create following World War II — a world dominated by Western commercial and political values — has come to pass. The country has championed independence, representative government structures, and open markets as normative goals for the rising world. The government has encouraged major American foundations and universities to establish programs to accelerate leadership development in these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with the passage of time, America became distracted by security issues that came to dominate U.S. international engagement policies. This is evident when we look at American development funding for various regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CkKyRpB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American foreign assistance has largely reflected the primary political agenda confronting the United States at any particular time. The United States provided considerable aid assistance to Europe between 1946 and 1955 (seen in light blue in Figure 2). This was the start of the Cold War, when America launched the Marshall Plan to jump-start the rebuilding of European economies. When the Soviet Union started to implode and ultimately collapse, there was a modest increase in spending for Europe. Foreign assistance to South and Central Asia (purple) became considerable as the confrontation with China increased and during U.S. involvement in the war in Vietnam. That funding ended sharply in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development assistance to Central and South America (dark blue) paralleled the threat perceived there by Cuba in the mid-1960s and the U.S. effort to contain radicalism in the Americas. That tapered off, only to be boosted in the 1980s in the so-called war on drugs. The last spike in spending in the 2000s involved Plan Colombia, a coordinated effort to keep Colombia from disintegrating into a narco-state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa (yellow) saw a significant boost in spending during the second half of the Bush administration in the early 2000s, when the United States devoted considerable resources to the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. That funding has remained high through commitments of resources for Feed the Future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Middle East and North Africa (green), two developments largely account for U.S. assistance. The first was the result of the end of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, when the United States committed to providing significant defense resources on an ongoing basis to Israel and Egypt. The most recent spike reflects spending on economic development in Afghanistan and Iraq following the invasion of both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, this abbreviated survey shows that U.S. foreign assistance has largely been shaped by urgent geopolitical objectives that have evolved over time. Development funding was an extension of our overall political agenda. The United States has significantly increased assistance when a crisis (or perceived crisis) has developed and then cut it back to shift focus to other priorities. Our original goal to use American foreign assistance to build a structural world favorable to our strategic interests evolved into a tactical complement to a broader foreign policy. Our focus on new states struggling to develop took a back seat over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-new-competition-with-china-in-the-global-south&quot;&gt;The New Competition with China in the Global South&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, U.S. policymakers have increasingly complained about China’s rising influence in Africa and South America. It is important to put this in context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has made a priority of courting countries in the Global South. China has been actively building projects throughout the Southern Hemisphere. It is often noted that these projects represent opportunities for Chinese workers, not local workers. Still, China has made significant investments throughout Africa and increasingly in South America. These investments are paralleled by active diplomacy. President Xi Jinping launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), through which China has loaned over $1 trillion to countries to pay for major infrastructure projects. Many of those projects were launched without adequate economic analysis, and China now finds itself as a major creditor country with loans that cannot be paid without significant restructuring. China generally does not forgive debt. This has had a dampening effect on China’s willingness to finance massive projects and on the willingness of receiving countries to take on large loads of debt. Much of the debt sustainability crisis facing the Global South is directly attributable to BRI projects. Still, the BRI has created pathways of influence for China in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 34 years, China has convened the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, which has become the premier conference bringing African heads of state to Beijing. President Xi invariably spends days personally with these African leaders, collectively and individually, throughout the conference. By contrast, America’s history of engagement in Africa is very uneven and rarely at presidential levels. To his credit, President Biden hosted a conference for African heads of state, but it stands out as a rare exception for an American president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, China has made major commercial inroads in the Global South (Figures 3 and 4). In 1980, the primary trading partners for South American countries were the United States and Europe. Where there was active trade in Africa, it was generally with Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2018, China had become a dominant trade partner for much of Africa and a good portion of South America, not to mention all of Southeast Asia. China has had an integrated strategy to build infrastructure that supports its own commercial activities in these countries. This commercial and geopolitics. In short, China has had an integrated strategy to advance its influence in the Global South, while the United States has no strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UunJ5F0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, while the United States has struggled to sustain a consistent focus in its development policies, China has been stealing the march. The United States’ development agenda now tends to reflect domestic political priorities and controversies, not a grounded interest in building the economies of countries in the Global South. The United States’ inconsistency has been countered by an integrated Chinese strategy that has entailed significant commercial and development investments in all three major regions of the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This points to another fundamental observation: economic development has shifted from aid to trade, and from pilot projects to direct investments. China is doing far better in this new dimension of development than the United States. The United States has used development funding to pursue important social goals, while China has used its financial resources to build access to stronger markets. As a president of an African country noted to one of the authors of this report: “China gives us money, and you give us lectures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and Europe do not need to duplicate China’s mercantile policies to be effective, but they do need to change their thinking about the problem. America has not had an effective trade policy for a number of years. Protectionism has been more dominant in U.S. trade policy than global economic growth. In the early years of the Cold War, the United States saw the clear need to help newly emerging countries grow and prosper and shape their economic preferences for the U.S.-inspired Bretton Woods system. The infrastructure of the United States’ soft power agenda remains in place, but the world has changed. The United States does not have a trade policy designed to draw African and South American countries increasingly into Western commercial orbits. Indeed, for several disastrous years, Congress blocked the work of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (now replaced by the DFC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America needs to return to the vision we championed in the early days of the Cold War. At that time, policymakers understood that the United States was competing against an alternative vision of economic development. The country is in this competition again, but with a far more capable opponent. America believes in free markets and competition. China believes in “managed democracy,” government-controlled markets, and preferential treatment of favored Chinese firms. African and South American governments are trying to improve the material lives of their citizens. The United States firmly believes that its model is superior, but it is failing to prioritize economic growth in African and South American countries as a key policy objective. If the United States is to succeed in the great competition with China in the Global South, it needs to shift its focus to promoting economic growth, commercial development, and trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be most vividly illustrated by looking at Africa. African states have a combined population of approximately 1.4 billion people today, and given the exponential birthrates on the continent, this number will surge to nearly 4 billion by the end of the century. The majority of its economies are still considered low income. Studies have shown that birth rates around the world almost invariably drop to replacement level or lower once GDP per capita reaches about $10,000. High birth rates in low-income economies is but one example of further intensified environmental and climatic demand pressures that the world will be facing in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a known fact that developed countries plus China have contributed the most to carbon loading in the atmosphere to the present day. These countries are increasingly making major commitments to transition from carbon-based to renewable energy sources, though their actions to date fall short of what is required to meet the goals set in the COP process. In addition, such commitments are counteracted by the increasing energy demands associated with rapid and unmanaged population growth. It is crucial to recognize that Africa is not to blame. The African continent has every right to become prosperous, and economic growth directly depends on affordable energy resources. However, the developed world has no effective program to offer lower-income countries that seek economic development. Under current trends, said development will inevitably cause continued high consumption of fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued high consumption of hydrocarbon-based energy will only heighten the water crisis that is now spanning the world. As African economies grow, we will see significant increases in urban populations and even greater stress on water and energy resources. In short, the global environment and America’s future well-being will be directly affected by boosting prosperity in Africa, responsibly managing population growth, and mitigating the negative consequences of increasing energy and water use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should develop a strategy that integrates development financing with trade liberalization to boost per capita incomes in Africa to $10,000 by 2040.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The Department of Commerce and the Development Finance Corporation should develop more programs and strengthen existing ones that encourage direct U.S. commercial investment in Africa, initially providing risk premium support to make commercial projects viable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;climate-change-and-energy-security&quot;&gt;Climate Change and Energy Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fossil-fuels-and-energy-consumption-today&quot;&gt;Fossil Fuels and Energy Consumption Today&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global energy consumption is highly correlated with economic growth. Indeed, the availability of lower-cost energy largely drove the Industrial Revolution and has led to an astounding increase in per capita incomes across the world. Energy consumption has grown dramatically worldwide over the past 60 years, but it is now causing great challenges because of the impacts on climate change. Scientists have estimated that global temperatures will continue to inexorably rise because of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere caused by the burning of hydrocarbon-based fuels. Governments around the world have pledged to reduce consumption of the primary hydrocarbon fuels — coal, oil, and natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has presented both good and bad news in this regard. Threatened by Russia’s aggressive posture, Europe has launched major investments in advancing renewable energy sources. For the first time, European energy policies are more closely matched with European energy promises in the Conference of the Parties (COP) process of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. But the war’s immediate threat to energy supplies caused an enormous spike in prices of natural gas and has driven world consumption of coal to an all-time high. Developing countries do not have the same capacity as Europe and the United States to massively subsidize conversions to renewable energy. Consequently, fossil fuel demand will remain very high for at least the next 30 years. Fossil fuel consumption will go down somewhat after 2030 but will remain at 90 percent of the peak established in 2030 (see Figure 6).&lt;/p&gt;

The rightmost scenario represents what steps would be required to meet net zero by 2050. Renewable energy resources are rising impressively, but fossil fuel consumption remains high due to current government policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A primary reason fossil fuel consumption rates remain high is because populations in emerging and developing countries in the Global South are growing dramatically and remain relatively poor while hydrocarbon energy resources are currently relatively affordable. As countries grow richer, citizens seek a higher quality of life, and this often means air cooling for homes and offices (a trend that climate change will accelerate) and personal transportation. Currently, about 80 percent of the global population without access to electricity — roughly 600 million people — lives in Africa, where electricity is overwhelmingly required for cooling. Currently, 5 billion people globally live in regions that require cooling, but only one-third of these individuals have air conditioners. As climate change intensifies, the number of people who need cooling is anticipated to grow to 7 billion. Today, there are 1.5 billion air conditioners, and that number is expected to grow to 4.4 billion by 2050, driving much higher consumption of electricity, particularly because the air conditioners that most people can afford to buy are not very energy efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been astounding progress in the efficiency and cost of photovoltaic solar power generation, but photovoltaic power generation and wind power are still intermittent sources. They work well in smaller-scale settings, but are difficult to scale to larger grid networks. Urbanization will heighten demand for reliable electricity, and at present, this is most likely to be met through carbon-based electricity generating facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need accelerated economic growth in developing countries to allow for better resource management. However, increased personal wealth will lead to greater demand for energy, and achieving economic prosperity depends on affordable energy resources. Under current trends, these countries will repeat the unfortunate pattern set by high-income economies that developed at the expense of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESURGENT INTEREST IN NUCLEAR POWER GENERATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The persistent high demand for fossil fuel power generation has again prompted interest in nuclear power. Nuclear power generation does not emit carbon dioxide or other gases that cause greenhouse gas effects in the atmosphere. Climate and energy security considerations have led several countries to adopt new strategies for energy security that involve nuclear energy. South Korea and Belgium have altered plans to retire existing nuclear production facilities. Japan has again restarted shuttered generation plants and plans to replace older nuclear generating facilities. Poland, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom have plans on the books to build new generating facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nuclear power has been plagued by high construction costs, serious cost overruns, and construction delays. This has led to a significant interest in small modular reactors. Currently there are a dozen companies developing designs for small generators that would range from 30 to 350 megawatts of power generation. Theoretically, these facilities would not require the extensive and expensive construction costs of larger reactors and can still incorporate designs that ensure safety, but to date, the promise of small modular reactors is more aspirational than a likely reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, construction has begun on 31 new large-scale reactors. However, all but four of them are being designed and built by either Russia or China. Herein lies a great concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR ENERGY AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial nuclear power generation is invariably the foundation for a nuclear weapons program. Countries have developed nuclear weapons without commercial generation facilities, but invariably countries develop the expertise to manage nuclear weapons and generate fissile materials when undertaking commercial nuclear power programs. This was understood when the Eisenhower administration launched the now famous Atoms for Peace program, announced at the UN General Assembly back in 1953. President Eisenhower and his advisers understood the enormous potential positive benefit of nuclear power as a generating source for electricity, but also knew the danger posed by nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led the United States to take the lead to develop a comprehensive architecture of controls to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The United States encouraged the development of commercial nuclear power under the strict surveillance of an independent UN agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which was established in 1957. IAEA inspectors travel around the world monitoring the nuclear power programs in 30 of the 32 countries that currently operate commercial nuclear power plants. (North Korea was included until 2002, when it kicked out IAEA inspectors as it set out on its current path of building nuclear weapons.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This then led to the establishment of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, commonly called the NPT. The NPT had three pillars. The first pillar committed all signatory states to not starting nuclear weapon programs and to accepting IAEA safeguard inspections to ensure that their nuclear programs conform to peaceful commercial power goals. The second pillar committed the countries that possessed nuclear weapons to getting rid of them. There is considerable criticism of nuclear weapon states for not following through on this commitment. At the time the NPT entered into force, there were only five acknowledged nuclear weapon states — China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Israel has long been a nuclear weapon state and has refused IAEA safeguards. India and Pakistan subsequently developed nuclear weapons but eventually agreed to IAEA safeguard inspections. North Korea had been an IAEA signatory but withdrew from the NPT treaty in 2003 and expelled all IAEA surveillance systems in order to develop nuclear weapons capabilities. While other countries have toyed with covert weapons programs (notably Syria, Iran, and Libya), generally the NPT has effectively limited the spread of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third pillar of the NPT treaty authorizes the peaceful use of nuclear energy for commercial and research purposes. Of the 32 countries that have commercial nuclear power plants, only 9 countries currently have nuclear weapons. It is strongly in America’s interests to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. The NPT has been reasonably successful in establishing norms of transparency and accountability that have limited the proliferation of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now we must return to the key fact that since 2017, 31 new nuclear reactor programs have been started, and 27 of them involve Russia and China. Russia and China were signatories to the NPT, but they have never been active champions of the IAEA or of non-proliferation. China actively aided Pakistan in developing its nuclear weapons, and Russia is now actively collaborating with North Korea, but it is unclear if this involves North Korea’s nuclear program. The burden of sustaining the NPT was largely carried by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, joined by Germany and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Energy Agency says it politely: advanced economies “have lost market leadership” in commercial nuclear technology. It goes on to explain that despite having nearly 70 percent of global nuclear capacity, investment has stalled, and the latest projects have run far over budget and behind schedule. America’s commercial nuclear power industry has substantially deteriorated. For 15 years, the United States has had to import enriched material from other countries, though recent legislation has provided funds to restart enrichment in the United States. The United States retains design teams but largely contracts for pressure vessel construction from Japan. Advocacy for commercial nuclear power has been weak over the past two decades, largely because of the cost, and cost overruns for new plants have damaged the commercial viability of nuclear power generation. We are now seeing encouraging signs of stronger interest in commercial nuclear energy, though price signals in the marketplace remain a major impediment to fielding a new generation of reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reasons-to-again-promote-commercial-nuclear-energy&quot;&gt;Reasons to Again Promote Commercial Nuclear Energy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States now has three compelling reasons to promote a resurgence of commercial nuclear energy. The first is the need for non-carbon power generation. Once in operation, nuclear power plants emit no greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Second, due to its past significant commercial nuclear power industry, America has developed gold standards for safety and security for operating commercial plants. And third, America needs to stay active in commercial nuclear power to sustain its leadership of the non-proliferation architecture. These goals are existential and require active American leadership on commercial nuclear power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The United States should develop a strategy to introduce small modular reactors into the Global South, assuring an expansion of nuclear power by countries that comply with and champion the compliance standards of the NPT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America’s success has been astounding, by any measure. The vast majority of Americans today live better than did Queen Victoria, only 150 years ago; Americans today have far superior medical care, warmer clothes and houses, ubiquitous and inexpensive entertainment, and far more comfortable transportation. This is not meant to minimize the inequity in America, nor the country’s scandalously high levels of hunger and poverty despite being the richest country in the world. But the human condition in the world — and especially in the United States — has improved dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The astounding improvement in the human condition over the last 70 years is a direct byproduct of the way the United States championed an open, liberal economic order and promoted liberalized trade during this period. This growth accelerated amid globalization, when geopolitical tensions were diminished, and new global supply chains and markets flourished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as they say in the world of public investing, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. We are facing a challenging time. America has fractured domestic politics, a divided electorate, disappointing public education performance, and frightening new technologies for which the government has no reliable framework for protecting the public. And the United States faces a formidable competitor on the global stage that offers a compelling narrative to a significant portion of the global population. This narrative suggests that Americans either take them for granted or, even worse, exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States does need a new strategy for this era, but it has a remarkable foundation for success well within its grasp. The United States’ driving goal is to survive as a nation and to prosper as a people. America certainly has all that it takes to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this monograph is not to delineate the intricate dimensions of a new national strategy. That requires the full commitment and efforts of hundreds or thousands of leaders in the United States. It rather offers a simple reflection of what challenges the American people face and what principles should guide the country going forward. This monograph attempts to outline a broad framework to guide the hard work of developing detailed policies and plans. Recounted here in summary form are the basic elements of this framework:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States must retain a strong military establishment capable of anticipating and addressing potential future challenges. The country has a strong establishment now, but it needs to become more efficient in its deliberations and strategic planning. Retaining a strong military will require serious streamlining and reform.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States still needs to play a leading role in shaping the global policy landscape to facilitate its accomplishment of national objectives. This means actively investing in stronger international institutions capable of managing complex modern problems. In addition, it must increase investment in alliances and partnerships with countries that share the same fundamental values. These alliances, partnerships, and institutions add strategic depth to U.S. national capacities, making it easier to manage an increasingly complex set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;America needs a growth strategy for its economy. Without significant expansion, Americans will contend to fight over a shrinking pie. It is crucial that we foster growth and ensure that the benefits are more evenly spread to establish a self-reinforcing economy. By prioritizing an agenda focused on growth, other problems in the country will be easier to address. Without ample economic growth, all problems will be harder to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To grow the economy, the U.S. government must bolster its commitment toward the expansion and success of the private sector. The United States needs to take a more active role in helping the private sector lead in setting global standards. The country needs to reform and fortify the intellectual property protection system. It also needs to ameliorate the immigration system to recruit more highly qualified people to expand the talent pool in the country and assist it in competing more effectively on the global stage. We also need serious reform of regulatory processes to remove the impediment of investing in the United States compared to investing in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States needs one comprehensive trade policy, for two reasons. First, such a strategy is the best way to widen the appeal and efficacy of a rules-based international order, which is fundamentally in America’s national interests. Second, the government needs to boost economic growth, both here in the United States and around the world. The vast growth in American prosperity and in prosperity around the world in recent decades was the product of increasing international trade. Today, the Global South perceives that America champions the international rules-based order to protect its privilege and amplify its growth at the expense of developing countries. The best way to reverse that perception is to create a vibrant trade agenda that prioritizes growth here and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is particularly important to support the economic development of low-income countries in the Global South. These nations will become customers of U.S. goods and services. More importantly, this presents an effective approach to curbing unmanaged population growth while addressing the challenges of economic migration that is presently confounding Europe and the United States. At the start of the Cold War, U.S. leaders understood that helping other countries become more prosperous was going to be good for America — for both economic and security reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If we are to address climate change effectively, the United States must deal with the reality of explosive population growth in the developing world and the comparably rising demands for energy. That means that the United States needs to shift its thinking on development from aid to trade. We also need to support these countries in their efforts to find development paths that are less exploitative and damaging to the environment. Seventy years ago, bringing economic growth and development to African, Asian, and Middle East countries was central to the U.S. strategy to win the Cold War. Now it likely is essential to win the battle against climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;America again needs to champion nuclear power. American leadership produced the credibility to shape a global system of rules and norms to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. America’s ambivalence now about nuclear energy could cede the international market to Russia and China, neither of which is a champion of non-proliferation. Expanding commercial nuclear power would also make a major contribution to reducing reliance on carbon-based sources of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a strategy but a framework that can guide the development of detailed plans to secure the future of the United States as a nation and ensure the prosperity of American citizens. The country finds itself once again in an era of strategic competition. Our primary competitor — China — possesses capabilities far exceeding those of the Soviet Union. While this is not Cold War 2.0, it is a competition between alternative philosophies of governance. There is a large segment of American society that is looking for sensible direction for a stronger future. There is no reason that the twenty-first century should not be the American century. However, that will only happen with pragmatic and constructive approaches to our shared future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US closed its last military base in Niger, located in Agadez, on 5 August 2024, following the earlier withdrawal of 800 troops from the Niamey base in July. This move came in response to demands from Niger’s military regime which, in March 2024, revoked the military accord with the US, signalling a shift in the country’s stance on foreign military presence. On 19 April, the US agreed to withdraw its troops from Niger. At that time, there were around 1,000 US troops in the country, stationed at two military bases, including a drone base near Agadez that is essential to US interests in Africa. Concurrently, while the US was discussing the modalities of its withdrawal, a Russian plane landed in Niamey on 12 April carrying a large amount of military equipment, including a Russian air defence system and 100 Russian soldiers from the Africa Corps, referred to as instructors. While according to local sources some of the instructors have left, the anti-aircraft defence system should enable the country to control its airspace against neighbouring countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two events exemplify, in a concrete way, the re-composition of the geostrategic landscape taking place in the Sahel, where countries such as Russia and China have increased their influence, while countries such as France and the US have seen theirs diminish. This change has been marked by a strategy of partnership diversification, which has characterised Sahelian foreign policy under military governments since 2021. This strategy is based on a principle of national sovereignty that prioritises the renewal of partnerships to seek strategic “win-win” agreements for each sector, without having to rely on one partner for everything. On the other hand, it calls into question previous agreements with traditional partners, as the new military governments now perceive that these partners may not have the best interests of the Sahelians at heart or do not fit in with the government’s strategy. One example was the non-renewal of the UN stabilisation mission in Mali, MINUSMA, in 2023 after the Malian authorities demanded its termination. The Malian transition authorities argue that the mission does not meet their expectations as the context requires “a force to fight terrorism, going beyond the doctrine of the United Nations peace mission”. A second example of this can be seen with the US withdrawal from Niger, where a spokesperson for the Niger military authorities, the Conseil national pour la sauvegarde de la patrie, said: “Niger regrets the intention of the American delegation to deny the sovereign Nigerien people the right to choose their partners and types of partnerships capable of truly helping them fight against terrorism”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A strategy of partnership diversification has characterised Sahelian foreign policy under military governments since 2021&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, there have been many examples of the exiting of various Western missions from the region. This started with the withdrawal of French forces under Operation Barkhane from Mali in 2022) and from Burkina Faso (Operation Sabre) and Niger in 2023, as well as the European missions EUMPM and EUCAP Sahel Niger in December 2023, and now includes the departure of the US from Niger. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that most Western international actors have not withdrawn from the Sahel, and most of the aid and humanitarian assistance programmes in the region are still led by European and North American countries. The deterioration of relations with the West, especially since the coup d’état in Niger, has also been used as an excuse for Sahelian countries’ political and security approaches at the regional level. In January 2024, Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso decided to suddenly withdraw from ECOWAS. The reason outlined by the junta is that ECOWAS has strayed from its original principles and has fallen under foreign influence (referring indirectly to France).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As relations between the military juntas and the West have deteriorated, other partners have stepped in to strengthen relations with these three Sahel countries. Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have strengthened their relations with Russia, especially in the security sector, with deployments of Russian and African Corps troops. China and Turkey have also increased their influence in several vital sectors in the Sahel countries. A recent example involving China is the construction of Africa’s largest oil pipeline, a 2,000 km long pipeline to export crude oil from the fields of Agadem in southeast Niger to Benin. This pipeline is not only significant from an economic investment standpoint, but it has also become an essential component of diplomatic aid for the Nigerien junta. In mid-April the Nigerien government announced that it had secured a $400 million loan from its Chinese partner as an “advance” for forthcoming crude oil sales, expected to commence in May. This economic capacity will allow the Nigerien government to stabilise its economy after the comprehensive sanctions imposed on it following the coup d’état. Turkey, meanwhile, has become an essential partner for these three countries in the defence sector, facilitating the sale of drones which will be a significant boost to their air capabilities. On 8 April, Burkina Faso received two dozen combat drones delivered by Turkey (Bayraktar TB2 and Bayraktar Akinci), forming a critical component of the country’s counterterrorism strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Western powers are reacting too slowly to the emergence of other partners in the the Sahel, which highlights a shifting global landscape&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the three countries have also increased their presence in the communication sphere of the three Sahelian countries. The Alliance of Sahel States (AES) formed by Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso is set to launch a certified digital platform, featuring an online TV channel, on 16 September 2024, coinciding with the organisation’s first anniversary. This initiative follows a key virtual meeting held on 10 July 2024, where the ministers of communication of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso established the foundation for a unified communication strategy. The ministers prioritised creating an emergency communication plan to inform citizens about major AES initiatives and “counter orchestrated misinformation campaigns”. Another recent example of control over the media came at the end of April when the Higher Communication Council of Burkina Faso suspended access to the websites of DW, The Guardian, Le Monde, the BBC, VOA and TV5 Monde (among others) until further notice. It has also suspended the broadcasting of programmes from these channels (for those broadcasting in Burkina Faso) for 2 weeks. The reason for the suspension is that these channels have shared a Human Rights Watch report accusing the Burkina Faso armed forces of carrying out executions of civilians. While these media outlets are downsizing, other media outlets such as TRT and Anadolu Ajansı from Turkey, as well as Chinese agencies such as Xinhua and Russia’s RT, are growing their presence significantly, positioning themselves as media outlets with alternatives to traditional sources such as the Agence de Presse Française. In addition, while this analysis has focused on Russia, Turkey and China, many other regional powers have also forged closer ties with the Sahelian juntas, such as the Gulf monarchies, North African countries like Morocco and Egypt, and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expanding influence of these three powers in the region, alongside the declining influence of Western states, clearly demonstrates the multipolarity of the current era. It is evident that there are viable alternatives to Western partners, and countries in the central Sahel region are demonstrating a preference for working with them on issues such as counterterrorism. Unlike Western partners, these alternative powers can respond more effectively to the needs of military juntas, operating without the red lines often tied to standards on civilian protection and human rights, as well as the promotion of democratic transitions. Western powers are reacting too slowly to the emergence of other partners in the region, which highlights a shifting global landscape. These evolving dynamics necessitate a reassessment of traditional diplomatic approaches and strategic alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

They also reflect the commitment of each to cyber as an international policy area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership demonstrates the value of targeted engagement driven by operational activities across multiple policy areas. Effort should now be made to ensure that the momentum that has defined the first year of the Partnership is sustained, that challenges are overcome, and that the impact of engagement on cyber continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership and considers the factors that determine how it functions. It recommends further activities for the Partnership to undertake within its existing strategic priorities, and advocates for an expanded scope. The paper makes the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capability development.&lt;/strong&gt; Japan and the UK should expand mutual efforts on personnel development through training, exchanges and exercises. Furthermore, continued dialogue on policies to retain and recruit technical personnel will ensure best practices are mainstreamed. Similarly, establishing trusted and secure processes to share information and intelligence is crucial to driving greater depth and breadth of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public–private partnerships (PPPs).&lt;/strong&gt; The UK and Japan should amplify cyber engagement led by non-governmental stakeholders: for example, emerging regional cyber clusters should be encouraged to continue developing bilateral partnerships. Efforts should also be made to promote connections between sectoral Information Sharing and Analysis Centres. Both governments should take a more proactive approach to expanding and supporting commercial cyber-security engagement, through facilitating partnerships and identifying areas of competitive advantage. Finally, existing efforts to promote bilateral involvement in national PPPs, such as Industry 100, should be expanded.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advancing shared international interests.&lt;/strong&gt; There is significant opportunity and willingness to expand bilateral cooperation on cyber capacity building across ASEAN and the wider Indo-Pacific, and to provide targeted support to deter adversaries. Japan and the UK should also pursue closer collaboration to promote global rules and norms in cyberspace by working together, conducting joint attributions, and so on. Both should also consider how to align their approaches to providing proactive international cyber crisis support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber-resilient ecosystems.&lt;/strong&gt; The UK and Japan should continue expanding the scope of the Partnership in response to need and opportunity. “Cyber-resilient ecosystems”, understood as cooperation on reforms to government structures, legislation, regulation and resilience, is one such area. The UK and Japan should further explore alignment on cyber-security professional standards, and establish a bi-annual dialogue on standards and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other activities the UK and Japan should undertake include: sufficiently funding engagement activities; trialling deeper cooperation on cyber education; and regularly assessing the progress of the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s findings, which inform these recommendations, are that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is currently momentum, enthusiasm and opportunity to continue and expand the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber security is both a distinct activity within the bilateral relationship and an enabler for further activities, for example in national security and defence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cooperation can be expanded on reforms to Japan and the UK’s cyber ecosystems, but it must be undertaken as peers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Japan’s commitment to reforming government structures, improving information security and developing capabilities will be decisive in deepening the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Persistent challenges and obstacles impact the tempo and scope of the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important that the Partnership remains on its current trajectory. Stakeholders across both countries believe that the Partnership has positive momentum and that there is space to expand engagement. Seizing this opportunity, while avoiding wasteful or unnecessary activities, can advance the wider bilateral relationship. As Japan and the UK expand their bilateral partnership, cyber security can be a springboard to achieve operational successes and enable broader strategic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, the UK and Japan signed a joint statement agreeing they were “each other’s most important partners in Asia and Europe, respectively”. Since then, the bilateral relationship has benefited from successive governments in each country prioritising engagement. Shared interests on diverse issues have presented opportunities for cooperation. To reiterate the importance of the Japan–UK relationship and to continue expanding the strategic partnership, the two countries agreed the Hiroshima Accord in May 2023. The Accord provides a strategic framing for the relationship by setting out the following bilateral priorities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic prosperity underpinned by technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Global resilience against threats such as climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defence and security, and within which a specific commitment to a UK–Japan cyber partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership is a landmark agreement to pursue a “full spectrum” of cyber cooperation, based on core strategic areas of cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthening public–private partnerships (PPPs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhancing cyber capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advancing shared international interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These strategic commitments have informed initiatives pursued under the Partnership, for example the meeting of the Japan Business Federation (“Keidanren”) with the UK’s National Cyber Advisory Board (NCAB), and joint exercises conducted by Japan’s Self-Defense Forces (SDF) and the British armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agreed strategic priorities and concrete activities demonstrate that the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership has momentum. They also reflect the commitment of each country to cyber as an international policy area. The progress of the Partnership to date shows the value of bilateral engagement on cyber, not just as one part of broader UK–Japan cooperation, but also as an enabler of other dimensions, such as defence industry cooperation, economic security and resilience. Priorities should be: determining which of the Partnership’s initiatives have been effective; examining why this is; and identifying how to further increase engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further develop the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership, both countries should regularly reassess existing initiatives and anticipate future opportunities. They should consider the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What activities are currently pursued under the Cyber Partnership and how do these contribute to bilateral objectives?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Could the Cyber Partnership be better leveraged to meet additional national cyber priorities?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What further activities and areas of strategic engagement should be considered for the Partnership?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a sustainable and deliberate expansion of the breadth and depth of the Cyber Partnership to further address existing mutual strategic priorities. Chapter I provides background on the UK–Japan relationship and the two countries’ respective cyber ecosystems. Chapter II outlines cyber engagement activities, detailing the actors involved and their remits. Chapter III examines how the strategic priorities of the Cyber Partnership align with wider bilateral cooperation, and whether national cyber strategies reveal additional areas for cooperation. Chapter IV offers strategic considerations for the Partnership and recommends further activities across its existing scope, as well as proposing an additional pillar: “cyber-resilient ecosystems”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research for this paper was conducted as part of the Indo-Pacific Cyber Programme, funded by the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office (FCDO). The programme is delivered by a consortium, of which RUSI is a member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research for this paper was conducted between November 2023 and February 2024. It consisted of qualitative research methods: a rapid evidence assessment; semi-structured interviews; and a roundtable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid evidence assessment:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers conducted a short review of open source academic and grey literature published in the past 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-structured interviews:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers conducted 29 semi-structured interviews, both online and in person in London and Tokyo, with UK and Japanese stakeholders in the public, private and civil society sectors. The interviews took place between November 2023 and February 2024. All interview data has been anonymised.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roundtable:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers ran one data-gathering roundtable for stakeholders to discuss relevant thematic issues, including respective approaches to cyber governance and PPPs on cyber security. There were more than 15 participants, primarily from the Japanese private sector. The roundtable was held as an in-person event in London on 18 January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Limitations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper has made limited use of literature or interviews in Japanese. One researcher, a Japanese speaker, conducted some discussions with relevant stakeholders in Japanese. The research team also used online translation software (Google Translate and DeepL) to review limited Japanese-language literature. Researchers acknowledge the limitations of non-bilingual data-gathering in identifying comprehensive findings and would welcome further research conducted by Japanese think tanks and academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-shape-of-cyber-ecosystems-in-the-uk-and-japan&quot;&gt;I. The Shape of Cyber Ecosystems in the UK and Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides context on the cyber ecosystems of the UK and Japan, and the factors that shape the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-cyber-posture-and-governance&quot;&gt;National Cyber Posture and Governance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Japan score well on international cyber rankings. The International Telecommunication Union’s Global Cybersecurity Index ranked the UK 2nd and Japan 7th globally in 2020. Similarly, the UK is ranked 9th on the e-Governance Academy’s National Cyber Security Index 2016–2023, with Japan ranked 52nd. While Japan has increased its focus on cyber security in recent years, partners have urged the country to move faster. Comments in particular from US Admiral Dennis Blair and then Director of the US National Security Agency, Paul Nakasone, have emphasised Japan’s need to match the capabilities of its allies and partners. The need is recognised in the commitment in Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy for response capabilities in cyber security to be “strengthened equal to or surpassing the level of leading Western countries”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivating the shared focus on cyber security of both the UK and Japan is the growing cyber threat. Ransomware attacks conducted by cyber-criminals in 2023 included those on the Port of Nagoya in Japan and on the British Library in London, inflicting significant financial and societal damage. It has been estimated that cybercrime against businesses has cost the UK over £30 billion per annum, with interview data suggesting that Japan also experiences significant costs. State-sponsored attackers are a persistent threat. Cyber attackers affiliated to China have been associated with a hack into Japan’s military in 2020, and into the UK Electoral Commission in 2022. Interstate competition, reflecting geopolitical tensions, has driven greater attention towards national cyber defence in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK significantly reformed its national approach to cyber security in 2016 by establishing the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) as a central authority. The NCSC is part of GCHQ. The closest equivalent to the NCSC in Japan is the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC), which sits within the prime minister’s office. Compared with the NCSC, the NISC has limited cross-government influence or powers beyond convening; moreover, it does not have a permanent staff – officials are seconded from industry and other parts of government. Furthermore, the NISC has many fewer technical personnel than the NCSC. Technical officials sit instead within the Information Technology Protection Agency (IPA) and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT). Japan’s 2022 National Security Strategy commits to restructuring the NISC into a new organisation that can “comprehensively coordinate [cyber] policies” – interviewees indicated that the UK’s NCSC may be used as a model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both countries have had several national cyber strategies. The UK launched its first strategy in 2009, Japan in 2013. The UK’s current National Cyber Strategy 2022 outlines five central pillars: the domestic cyber ecosystem; national cyber resilience; achieving technological advantage; pursuing global leadership; and countering threats. Japan’s 2021 national cyber-security strategy, Cybersecurity for All, has three pillars: promoting socioeconomic development; safety and security in a digital society; and contributing to international peace and stability. Across their strategies, both countries acknowledge the importance of taking a multi-stakeholder approach – the UK refers to this as a “whole of society” approach, Japan as a “whole of nation” approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;drivers-of-bilateral-cyber-engagement&quot;&gt;Drivers of Bilateral Cyber Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research participants identified several factors that support continued buy-in to the Cyber Partnership across both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, several participants noted that the Cyber Partnership and the wider bilateral relationship are mutually reinforcing. Activities that build trust in one another’s cyber capabilities reassure each country that wider cooperation is secure. Likewise, cooperation on diverse activities, such as defence and security or standards development, encourages deeper engagement on cyber security. The Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), the UK–Japan–Italy initiative to build a sixth-generation fighter jet, was regularly cited by interviewees as an example of how cyber-security engagement is a requirement for and enabler of the wider bilateral relationship. Were high-level domestic commitments to the relationship to weaken, there is a risk that the Cyber Partnership would lose the momentum built around the Hiroshima Accord. For example, if a headline activity such as the GCAP experienced significant and public issues, they could undermine other activities. To deepen the Cyber Partnership, it is important to continue making the case for engagement on cyber security, and to entrench operational areas of cooperation that will maintain a close and trusting relationship. Choosing the right framing for activities under the Partnership and adopting a long-term mindset, including bilateral exchanges or multi-year commitments to joint exercises, is thus a valuable way to harness the opportunities the partnership presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second factor identified by participants that drives the Cyber Partnership is geopolitical alignment. Under the late former prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Japan revitalised its approach to defence and security, modifying the interpretation of its right to “collective self-defence” (“集団的自衛権”) and pioneering the vision of a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”. Japan’s cyber strategy has drawn on these ambitious changes in advocating for a “free, fair and secure” cyberspace, a call supported by various reforms, such as the introduction of “active cyber defence” (ACD – for differences in understandings of ACD, see next section, “Common Misunderstandings”). The UK has committed to supporting a free and open Indo-Pacific, and the country’s Indo-Pacific “tilt”, confirmed as a permanent pillar of UK strategy in the Integrated Review Refresh 2023, emphasises the relationship with Japan. Similarly to Japan, the UK is committed to a “free, open, peaceful and secure cyberspace”. Amid geopolitical tensions, the two countries align on major international security issues, such as supporting Ukraine against Russia’s illegal invasion and engaging with Taiwan on building resilience. The Cyber Partnership has thus far benefited from bilateral alignment and there is little reason to expect this to change in the coming years, with neither the UK Labour Party nor Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party showing signs of reneging on the commitment at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, several Japanese research participants remarked that their perception of the UK as a “first mover”, its transparency on various aspects of cyber policy and its comparable size all motivated engagement. The UK was regarded by research participants as a first mover for convening the AI Safety Summit and co-leading the Pall Mall Process in 2023. Compared with the US, the UK was also seen as more similar to Japan in terms of scale, spending power and cultural attitudes, among other things. When discussing transparency on cyber policy, interviewees referred to the UK National Cyber Force’s guidance on “Responsible Cyber Power in Practice”, which outlines how and why the UK conducts cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, multiple participants emphasised the importance of trusted in-country representatives as facilitators and enablers of the Partnership. Participants specifically praised the efforts of embassy officials in London and Tokyo who focus on cyber aspects of the bilateral relationship. Their presence ensures that cyber-specific face-to-face meetings can regularly take place. This offsets the obstacle of geographic distance, which can increase the time and financial commitment required for Japan–UK government engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;common-misunderstandings&quot;&gt;Common Misunderstandings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership is impacted by different uses of terminology and a low awareness of respective capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misunderstanding can arise where key concepts are used differently, for example ACD. In the UK, ACD is a programme of interventions led by the NCSC to tackle high-volume commodity attacks. In its 2022 National Security Strategy, Japan committed to its own version of ACD, consisting of three activity areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advancing information sharing from the private sector to government in the event of cyber attacks, and improving incident response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Working with domestic telecommunications providers to identify and block malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establishing required authorities for government to “penetrate and neutralize attacker’s servers and others in advance” of cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this definition, some members of Japanese civil society understand ACD as creating expanded scope for surveillance and permitting extra-territorial offensive cyber operations. This has raised questions about whether ACD violates the constitutional right to privacy and secret communications, and about Japan’s application of the principle of self-defence. Political sensitivity about ACD has delayed its implementation and created scepticism among potential private sector partners. ACD has also created some confusion in the bilateral relationship, as the UK and Japanese definitions and approaches differ. Some interviewees reported that translations of Japanese ACD activity areas have been confusing. For example, one interviewee remarked that “侵入・無害”, translated in the English language version of the National Security Strategy as to “penetrate and neutralize”, does not necessarily include the “and” in Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The language barrier has meant that difficulties in aligning understandings of strategic and policy frameworks are reproduced to some extent at an operational level – neither the UK nor Japan has a strong reputation for linguistic aptitude. In some cases, slightly different Japanese phrases are used for the same term in English. For example, the broad English term “information sharing” is translated as “情報交換” (which has connotations of exchange), but also as “情報共有” (which has connotations of common ownership). In other cases, terminology is imported into Japanese discourse from English through transliteration, rather than translation. For example, the transliteration of “attribution” as “アトリ ビューション” introduces a degree of uncertainty as to whether this is best represented in Japanese as “特定” (“specify”) or “帰属” (“attribute”). Awareness of nuanced differences and attention to precise detail in communication will mitigate such problems and help manage expectations in the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research participants generally reported that Japan’s cyber-security capability is low in all areas. They frequently cited well-known issues about Japan’s information security, particularly in the defence sector, as evidence. Nonetheless, there are also capabilities which are often overlooked. Multiple Japanese ministries have had PPPs since the early 2010s. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has the Initiative for Cyber Security Information-Sharing Partnership of Japan, the Ministry of Defense (JMoD) has the Cyber Defense Council, and the National Police Authority (NPA) has the Japan Cybercrime Control Center. Additionally, Japan’s International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which sits under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), has established a cyber-security capacity-building centre with ASEAN to train government and critical national infrastructure professionals. Concerns about Japan’s cyber-security capabilities, particularly related to information security, are well founded and widely acknowledged. Nonetheless, a one-dimensional understanding of Japan’s cyber capability discounts the progress that has been made and implies that peer-to-peer engagement is out of reach. No country has a perfect record. A mature and sustainable UK–Japan cyber partnership should honestly acknowledge where each country needs to improve, while appreciating how the other’s existing and emerging strengths can improve mutual resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-cyber-engagement-progress-so-far&quot;&gt;II. Cyber Engagement: Progress So Far&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides an overview of UK–Japan cyber engagement activities and assesses their composition and intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;partnership-activities-and-engaged-actors&quot;&gt;Partnership Activities and Engaged Actors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 shows cyber engagement activities between the UK and Japan. Listed activities are linked with relevant actors, assigned a type of engagement, and assessed as to whether they align with the themes of the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activities outlined in Table 1 were identified through interviews and from open source information. As far as the authors are aware, Japan and the UK do not maintain a shared list or overview of all activities under the Partnership. By collecting activities which can reasonably be linked to bilateral cyber cooperation and assigning them a theme, type and responsible actors, the table provides a snapshot of the Partnership. This snapshot is not an authoritative list of activities under the Partnership, as it is not confirmed by either government, nor did the research take place at a classified level. Assumptions based on the list of activities must therefore be made with caution and with the awareness that the list may not be conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kdMKnZK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Overview of Cyber Partnership Activities, 2023–24.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The authors, based on interviews and open source information. Notes: For acronym meanings, please refer to the Abbreviations list at the start of the paper. “Themes” include specific priorities of the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership – PPPs, capability development and advancing shared international interests – as well as governance and miscellaneous other themes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Partnership matures, more transparency on implementation and resourcing should be considered. For example, there is currently little public communication about how it is monitored and resourced. Publicly agreed milestones, for example, could emphasise the importance of appropriate resourcing to meet Partnership commitments. While too much transparency carries the risk of watered down or vague commitments, the UK and Japan should nonetheless consider clearer communication on the details of the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activity Themes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1 shows that cyber engagement activities broadly align with the priority areas of the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partnership themes with the most activity were “advancing shared international interests” and “capability development”. This aligns with statements by research participants that assigned the most significance to cooperation in these areas. Participants explained this in the following terms: that these areas have multiple implementing actors with clear remits and motivations to engage, and increased resourcing on each side to implement these commitments. For example, Japan and the UK have worked closely in forums where they are both members, for example the Counter Ransomware Initiative and the OEWG, but – perhaps more importantly – they have prioritised participating in and supporting each other’s minilateral initiatives, such as the Pall Mall Process and the Keio International Cybersecurity Symposium. Similarly, data gathering indicated a particular focus on joint exercises to develop and refine capabilities, and initiatives for skills building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities to advance shared international interests through multilateral platforms have built on existing engagements and reflect that the Partnership does not take a zero-sum view of cooperation. UK–Japan cooperation on cyber does not preclude engagement with other countries, nor can it. Efforts on capability development have concentrated on defence and security. Joint teaming on Exercise Locked Shields was particularly emphasised as an activity that built capabilities, reinforced trust and signalled alignment internationally. Nonetheless, select UK government officials expressed uncertainty that they would continue to pursue joint teaming in exercises, explaining that it is difficult to over-commit personnel in operational roles. Concerns about resourcing were not frequently raised by research participants. Researchers concluded that this was either because top-down prioritisation of the Partnership made for fewer resourcing obstacles, or because the activities were not excessively costly. If ambitions for the Partnership continue on their current trajectory, resourcing activities may become more challenging due to limited cyber workforces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activities on PPPs show promise for closer cooperation but have thus far been focused on Japanese firms operating in the UK. Researchers believe this can be explained in part by the smaller number of UK firms active in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers created an additional theme of “cyber-resilient ecosystems” to categorise activities that support national reforms and concern standards and regulations. This theme recognises activities that already exist or are ongoing, and reflects insights from research participants who stressed the value of Partnership in this area. Discussions between counterparts on areas including structural reforms, secure AI, standards and so on are particularly important. Neither the UK nor Japan is part of a supranational regulatory body such as the EU, nor do they have the market power of the US or China. More dialogue on regulation and approaches would provide opportunities for Japan and the UK to influence global headwinds, share learnings and best practices, and deepen the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Activity Types&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper assigns 12 different types to identified activities. These types attempt to group and rationalise activities to support the Partnership in structuring further cooperation. Again, while the list of activities may not be definitive, the diversity of types reflects positively on the Partnership’s ambition to be diverse and broad based. The sub-section below discusses the most salient of these activity types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, there is significant depth and breadth of activity focused on government-to-government (G2G) dialogue. These discussions span a variety of issues, including sensitive topics such as defence and security. Regular substantial dialogue is important to ensure mutual understanding and to identify further opportunities for cooperation. Regular G2G and multi-stakeholder dialogue also facilitates other activities. Research data noted that activities, such as joint agreements on standards or product security, often emerge from initial wide-ranging conversations, such as between the UK’s Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) and Japan’s METI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activity types where research participants indicated there was good opportunity for more cooperation are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical.&lt;/strong&gt; Participants identified the opportunity to accelerate the technical assurance and accreditation of cyber-security companies, for example by the UK’s NCSC. Existing activities facilitated market access for Japanese firms and provided benefits for UK consumers. Further activities could build on this work, including improving access for UK companies in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deterrence/international norms.&lt;/strong&gt; UK stakeholders placed significant importance on this type of activity. The UK sees joint attributions with close partners as highly impactful. Japanese officials are aiming to expand attribution activities and consistently emphasise the importance of accuracy. Some research participants believed that Japan has little capacity to conduct technical assessment to support attributions, and are wary about sharing data due to information security concerns. While Japanese officials acknowledged that they would like access to more information and intelligence, they do receive inputs from the NPA, the NISC, the Japan Cyber Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (JPCERT/CC) and the IPA, which can inform political decision-making. Expanding cooperation on this type of activity is more likely to be a political question than one of technical capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devolved engagement.&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers were surprised by cooperation between regional cyber clusters in the UK and Japan, specifically Cyber Hiroshima and Cyber Wales. This included sharing best practices and trailing joint activities. Both organisations demonstrated significant enthusiasm for the Partnership, and this model offers a clear value case for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercial.&lt;/strong&gt; Japan and the UK both have advanced digital economies with substantial high-tech sectors, including robotics, smart cities and AI. Cyber security is significant for these industries and data gathering indicates that companies from both countries have opportunities to work with counterparts, and to export and purchase products and services. Data gathering did not include in-depth market research, but researchers would recommend that government trade ministries produce and publish such information to support companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber capacity building (CCB).&lt;/strong&gt; Research participants from both the UK and Japan emphasised CCB as an area of opportunity. JICA and the FCDO each have a good international reputation for CCB. The UK-funded training course delivered through the ASEAN-Japan Cybersecurity Capacity Building Centre (AJCCBC) in February 2024 is consistent with Japan’s focus on personnel development and demonstrates the ability to cooperate on this type of activity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe it is also likely that a rather low level of current activity on the above areas informed research participants’ belief that there is opportunity in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Actors Involved&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variety of actors involved in activities listed in Table 1 demonstrates that cyber cooperation is decentralised, and that organisations often establish and maintain relationships with bilateral partners independently. Multiple officials validated this perception, including one who argued that decentralised, whole-of-government engagement is preferable for Japan in advance of expected reforms to the NISC. While a central coordinating actor can be beneficial, if Japan and the UK aspire to have a high tempo of engagement across multiple areas, diverse government actors will need direct points of contact with their counterparts. Determining how centralised cooperation should be is important. Too much centralisation can create barriers to engagement, leading to delays, too little can result in siloed activities that are unaligned with bilateral strategic priorities. Moreover, too few centralised initiatives that facilitate engagement can result in some government entities not being involved in bilateral cooperation: for example, Japan’s IPA featured infrequently in research participants’ accounts of the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A challenge to cooperation is that some counterpart organisations do not have the same roles and responsibilities. For example, the coordination of public attribution in Japan sits with the National Security Secretariat, fed by technical information from the NPA and other members of the intelligence community, and advice from the MOFA on the diplomatic consequences. This contrasts with the UK, where the FCDO holds political responsibility and the NCSC provides technical advice. In practice, a ministry or agency may have different counterparts on different policy or operational issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for effective conveners who can facilitate bilateral connections between counterpart organisations is a key dependency for the Partnership. In their absence, there is a risk that an inability to identify and connect with relevant counterparts will undermine engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-institutional and departmental career paths can be beneficial to enhance dialogue between actors working on various aspects of cyber policy in different governmental departments. This avoids government departments working in silos on overarching topics such as cyber. This is already practised in the UK, where civil servants move within cyber-relevant institutions, for example from positions in the National Crime Agency (NCA) to the NCSC or the National Cyber Force. While temporary secondments are common in Japan, dedicated cyber career paths could further strengthen the government’s cyber workforce and international engagement, with officials developing trust and competence over multiple posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;additional-considerations&quot;&gt;Additional Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section outlines additional considerations that have shaped the development and prioritisation of activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Informal networks drive activity take-up.&lt;/strong&gt; Primary data gathering indicated that several activities happened because officials had personal connections with counterparts and together identified opportunities for cooperation. Participation in annual cyber dialogues was identified as a particularly important way to build these relationships. Reports that some government stakeholders were unable to join dialogues because of funding restrictions are therefore worrying. While governments should ensure value for money, bilateral cooperation benefits from personal relationships. The geographical and linguistic distance between the UK and Japan therefore presents obstacles. The resources required for officials to engage can be prohibitive, especially in a context of limited budgets. Given the scale of resources required, whether these are provided will likely depend on political will – if there continues to be high-level commitment to the Partnership, sufficient funding is likely to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperation is complex.&lt;/strong&gt; The activities identified in Table 1 are summarised and organised into delimited categories. While this offers a snapshot of the Partnership, some areas of engagement cannot be understood as discrete activities. For example, while few activities were assigned under the cyber-resilient ecosystems theme, several senior decision-makers conveyed that this area was their primary priority. While this could show that prioritisation had been ineffective, data gathered instead indicates that engagement on this theme can proceed without distinct activities – demonstrating a limitation of assessing a partnership solely through listing activities. Multiple Japanese stakeholders referred to the UK’s structures and legislation as a model, and explained this was because of similarities between the two countries, and the depth of wider cooperation. Further, in addition to activities identified under “advancing shared international interests”, other informal, ad-hoc and small-scale cooperative efforts regularly take place in multiple forums not listed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited scope for impact in some areas.&lt;/strong&gt; More cooperation does not guarantee more impact. The introduction of initiatives in areas of cyber not well suited to UK–Japan cooperation could be inefficient or disadvantageous. An example of this is formalising operational cooperation on cybercrime investigations. In practice, very few of the cases covered by the UK’s NCA and Japan’s NPA overlap. In the rare cases that are linked, agencies engage on an ad-hoc basis to meet operational objectives. Any well-intentioned move to formalise this limited engagement would neither be a good use of resources nor create efficiencies. The difference in each country’s cybercrime threat landscape is mirrored to some extent in state threats. Japan is focused on cyber threats from China and North Korea, whereas the UK often prioritises Russian threat actors. This could mean that information sharing is less relevant – however, multiple research participants framed the difference as complementary. Where information sharing can take place, it could bolster each country’s national cyber defence. Officials from the UK and Japan should be on the lookout for areas where there is modest scope to expand valuable engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-strategic-alignment&quot;&gt;III. Strategic Alignment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter contextualises existing activities and assesses how existing Partnership commitments align with wider bilateral priorities, and considers whether national strategies point to further opportunities for cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aligning-the-cyber-partnership-and-the-hiroshima-accord&quot;&gt;Aligning the Cyber Partnership and the Hiroshima Accord&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership focuses on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strengthening PPPs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhancing cyber capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advancing shared international interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As detailed above, these priorities broadly correspond with cyber cooperation activities identified in this paper. The only exceptions are activities that the authors associate with a new area (“cyber-resilient ecosystems”) and several others that fall into the “Other” category – entirely G2G dialogues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership was set out under the Hiroshima Accord. The Accord commits to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Strengthening our shared security capabilities to help safeguard global peace and stability”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Deepening our economic relationship to create shared prosperity and increase trade and investment”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“Leading international efforts to deliver a better and more sustainable future for all”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cyber Partnership is mentioned within the first of these three categories, implying that the Partnership focuses on defence and security. This is reflected in activities identified in Table 1, for example the combined SDF and UK armed forces exercises. Nevertheless, other activities have addressed, for example awareness and skills building and aligning standards and regulations, thereby suggesting that the Partnership is broader than defence and security. Discussions with officials have supported this conclusion. While the Partnership was founded with a focus on defence and security, it now also addresses – albeit informally – other Hiroshima Accord priorities: shared economic prosperity and leading international efforts for global resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift to pursuing activities across the Partnership that align with all three Accord priorities has shown some signs of success, but prospects for a higher pace of engagement are uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positive signals have been sent by both governments on deepening economic ties through cyber security. Japan has contracted a British company to provide cyber-security training to SDF and JMoD officials, and the NCSC has invited Fujitsu UK to join its Industry 100 scheme and accredited Nihon Cyber Defence as an incident response provider. Nonetheless, the growth in trade and investment in cyber has been slow. Private sector stakeholders are wary about the difficulties of entering foreign markets, with several anticipating high costs and, in the defence sector, expressing anxiety about the ability to acquire required clearances. The lack of a common language is a significant challenge. Translation software, which is increasingly AI-enabled, partly mitigates language differences, but these still present a barrier. Market structures also present challenges. Japanese companies often procure cyber-security products and services from a small number of large vendors. Vendors are risk averse, and slow to integrate small- and medium-sized-enterprise (SME) products and services. This disadvantages both Japanese and British SMEs. Larger UK cyber-security companies are less likely to use a vendor, and while they have sufficient resources to set up offices locally, there is a significant time and cost investment. UK companies reported significant difficulties in hiring qualified and bilingual Japanese employees, who were seen as essential to business operations. Research participants from Japanese companies similarly reported anxiety about entering the UK market, but were able to identify fewer specific concerns. Officials in the UK and Japan are enthusiastic about deepening the economic Partnership through cyber, although data gathering indicates there are outstanding challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third priority of the Cyber Partnership already aligns somewhat with the third pillar of the Hiroshima Accord. It is possible to advance shared interests – building influence, countering adversaries and so on – while simultaneously delivering a better and sustainable future internationally. For example, both the UK and Japan undertake CCB to support cyber resilience, awareness and security in recipient countries. In addition to building recipients’ capacity to mitigate cyber harms, CCB can also meet influence, security and economic objectives. The UK has several global CCB programmes, including the Indo-Pacific Cyber Programme, while Japan currently focuses on Indo-Pacific countries – JICA intends to expand its activities in Oceania and Africa. Additionally, Japan has established the AJCCBC as an axis for CCB in the Asia Pacific region. As detailed in Table 1, the UK has deployed CCB through the AJCCBC. The UK and Japan each have ambitions for CCB, and further alignment could act as a multiplier for their efforts. The extent to which the UK and Japan can coordinate their CCB efforts will depend on strategic and practical considerations. Do the countries agree on where, how and when to expend resources on CCB? Further, can they effectively work together on an operational level – are their ways of working, processes for information sharing and so on aligned? While the UK and Japan are like-minded partners, diverse individual factors shape their respective foreign policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-strategic-alignment-and-additional-overlaps&quot;&gt;National Strategic Alignment and Additional Overlaps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Japan each have an overarching national cyber-security strategy, the pillars of which are shown in Table 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Japan share a strategic commitment to increasing the security and resilience of their digital societies. Japan’s overarching stated objective is to ensure “a free, fair and secure cyberspace”, while the UK vision is for a “free, open, peaceful and secure cyberspace”. The strategies echo one another, and the two countries have similar priorities in cyber policy. Both recognise the necessary role of the private sector, are increasingly prioritising standards and regulations, and are committed to using cyber to pursue international objectives. Additionally, they share an understanding of the nature of the threat. These points of convergence provided the impetus for the Cyber Partnership and have driven its first year, focused on PPPs, advancing shared international interests and capability development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several areas where the UK and Japan have strong strategic crossovers, but which present more difficulties for cooperation. These include: interoperable standards; cyber threat intelligence sharing; joint hunt forward operations; and research and academic partnerships. Chapter IV discusses the benefits and challenges involved in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-strategic-considerations-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;IV. Strategic Considerations and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper finds that there is valuable momentum in the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership across multiple areas, driven by shared challenges and opportunities. Nonetheless, the Partnership is still in its infancy and there is significant space to grow. While current strategic priorities are appropriate for the bilateral Partnership, further activities can be pursued, and areas of focus expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter makes recommendations for the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership, highlighting strategic considerations and suggesting practical activities as the Partnership moves into its second year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-considerations&quot;&gt;Strategic Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In approaching the recommendations outlined below, Japan and the UK should consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay the course:&lt;/strong&gt; The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership, and the Hiroshima Accord within which it sits, are relatively new initiatives. Bilateral relations between the two countries have been warming over the past decade, but domestic political priorities can divert attention. It is important that the achievements of the Partnership to date are properly communicated and that the areas of cooperation it has identified are entrenched. Continued attention to the Partnership will provide benefits across the wider relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Partnership as one piece of the puzzle:&lt;/strong&gt; Viewing bilateral cooperation in isolation is unhelpful. The UK and Japan are like-minded partners which sit within a latticework of other multilateral and minilateral agreements. While the importance placed on bilateral activities is understandable, neither country should be discouraged from pursuing initiatives that involve other partners within groupings, such as Five Eyes, AUKUS and the Quad, that have aligned strategic interests. Nonetheless, opportunities for bilateral cooperation to drive comparative advantage for both the UK and Japan should be pursued where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Successful cooperation on cyber reforms is a two-way street:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan’s cyber legislation and structures are undergoing significant reforms. Japan’s international partners, including the UK, are keen to provide input and assistance to this process, and Japanese stakeholders want to learn from international best practices. Nonetheless, the Partnership should not be framed as a capacity-building initiative. Engagement between the UK and Japan, for example the GCAP, takes place on peer-to-peer terms. Thus, the Partnership should continue to frame itself as a peer-to-peer initiative. While Japan is looking to “catch up” with the UK on cyber, there are still learnings to share in the near term and, as Japan’s capabilities quickly improve, significant opportunities for in-depth cooperation in the medium to long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber security as an enabler and an activity:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased trust and cooperation on cyber security open the way for deeper engagement on diverse areas of partnership. This is especially important as the UK and Japan prioritise defence and security cooperation. Equally, cyber-security engagement should be seen as an end in itself. Assessing and appreciating the value of the Partnership in these terms is important to determining how much resource to assign to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticipate delays and dead ends:&lt;/strong&gt; The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership has achieved good momentum in its first year, despite several challenges and obstacles that are unlikely to disappear in the near term. These issues have been highlighted throughout this paper, across strategic risks such as domestic political commitment and conflicting international priorities; tactical obstacles including resourcing, language, information security, different threat landscapes and geographical distance; and the lack of a common implementation plan. While this paper raises these challenges, it focuses on outlining the strategic motivation for the Partnership and identifying bilateral activities. Further research is required to better understand the significance and breadth of challenges to the Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommended-activities&quot;&gt;Recommended Activities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Capability Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a global shortage of cyber skills. Governments are struggling to train and retain skilled officials, which impacts their ability to assess, develop and implement technical solutions. Shortages of skilled personnel have downstream effects on governments’ access to cyber-security products and services that contribute to national cyber defence. Internal capability gaps within governments and non-specialist companies have led to a greater reliance on cyber-security providers and implementers. The following recommendations detail how the UK and Japan can continue to cooperate to develop and improve capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Establish repeatable and department-neutral personnel development cooperation activities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinating agencies, national technical authorities and ministries of foreign affairs should establish limited and distinct personnel development activities. Such activities should be relatively reproducible by different parts of government and should encompass:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training.&lt;/strong&gt; Technical training is an important way to upskill personnel and provide a non-financial incentive to remain with an organisation. For Japan, the scale of the training required will necessitate private sector assistance – Japan’s MoD intends to have around 4,000 cyber core personnel of SDF units by the end of Japan’s Financial Year (JFY) 2027, up from around 890 in JFY2022, and around 20,000 cyber-related personnel in the ministry, including the cyber core personnel of the SDF units. The UK cyber-security sector has many companies that conduct this kind of training: they should be incentivised and facilitated through the Partnership to bid for Japanese government contracts. Non-technical training should also be included in this offer – there is a particular opportunity for interactive sessions on defence doctrine, although this should likely involve direct participation from the MoD.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exchanges.&lt;/strong&gt; Japanese and UK agencies, departments and ministries that engage regularly and have clear areas of overlap should pursue personnel exchanges. DSIT, METI and other organisations focused on cutting-edge cyber and technology regulation would especially benefit. This activity will likely be impacted by the language barriers outlined throughout this paper. Creative solutions, including intensive language training, may limit the impact of this obstacle but can be resource intensive. Participating agencies could instead link exchanges to language upskilling opportunities offered to officials.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercises.&lt;/strong&gt; Joint teams at international exercises and participation in each other’s national exercises builds operational familiarity, develops participants’ skills and signals partnership internationally. These benefits should, however, be managed against understandable concerns about trade-offs in resourcing exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the private sector is involved in these activities, Japan and the UK should encourage partnerships involving companies from both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Continue informal discussions on retention and recruitment policies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD and JMoD should continue to discuss retention and recruitment efforts. They should commit to sharing learnings with other parts of government that employ cyber operators, such as the police. This could also include proposals for cooperation initiatives between UK and Japanese cyber reservists. Including reservists in cooperation efforts brings strong expertise to the table and can limit demand on limited personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Establish processes for more effective sharing of information and cyber threat intelligence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve a higher tempo of cooperation, Japan and the UK should more effectively and actively share information. Information must include cyber threat intelligence but should not be limited to it – for example, intelligence about the organisation of threat actors is also important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To share information, better processes are required. Practices to enable cyber threat intelligence sharing are an example of where reforms are underway to balance the need for equivalence with country-specific demands. Reform of Japanese policy and processes on information security, security clearances and classifications are proceeding at the same time as the UK security establishment is refining its understanding of how to approach a satisfactory level of equivalence. Sustained bilateral dialogue through the channels of cyber-security cooperation facilitates convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GCAP has driven efforts to converge approaches to information security. The timeline to achieve an operational capability by 2035 is tight, and there is pressure to accelerate information-sharing questions at all classifications. In the absence of streamlined information sharing, the concern is that GCAP will be less efficient, and a delayed timeline will mean it offers a less effective response to increasing threats from adversaries. Currently, the commitment to establishing a secure digital platform enabling GCAP partners to work together and share information in a real-time collaborative environment is still in the process of delivery. A sixth-generation fighter cannot be designed with first-generation techniques. Solving information sharing is a technical problem, but it is also a political one. The primary responsibility at present sits with government officials, who are understandably risk sensitive. To ensure significant and timely progress is made on information sharing – which is necessary for GCAP and across the wider Partnership – political decision-makers will likely need to engage more actively to drive implementation. Part of this will involve making tough decisions about trust and information security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. PPPs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private companies are critical actors in cyber and technology. Japan and the UK have acknowledged a need to work with the private sector, each developing multiple PPPs. Building cooperation on PPPs between the UK and Japan, however, presents significant challenges. There is no common language, business cultures differ, motivations to engage with two governments rather than one vary, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Enable partnerships between regional clusters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devolved administrations working with trade ministries should encourage partnerships between regional cyber clusters. The support of Cyber Wales in establishing Cyber Hiroshima and their continued partnership is a non-governmental success story for the Cyber Partnership. As more Japanese municipalities look to establish cyber clusters, trade and digital ministries from each country should facilitate introductions with existing UK clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Promote connections between sectoral Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevant ministries and agencies, including the NCSC, NISC and IPA, which work closely with national sectoral ISACs, should facilitate discussions with their bilateral counterparts. Agencies should then encourage and partially support cooperation between sectoral ISACs where there is clear interest, such as nuclear, finance and automotive. This activity should be careful not to duplicate existing international ISAC cooperation, nor unnecessarily promote engagement where there is no clear need and interest. One opportunity is to build additional cooperation on the foundation of the existing good relations between the UK’s Cyber Defence Alliance and Japan’s Cybercrime Control Center – non-profits that work with the private sector and law enforcement to combat cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Take a more proactive and targeted approach to expanding commercial cyber engagement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s METI and the UK’s Department of Business and Trade (DBT) should determine a strategic approach, in partnership with their respective private sectors, to promote market access in the UK and Japan. This could include: encouraging and facilitating partnership with UK/Japanese firms; enabling SMEs and primes to present a consolidated UK/Japan offer; and identifying and promoting relevant niches where UK/Japan industry has a relevant comparative advantage. These principles should continue to be supported by regular trade missions. These activities are important to lower the perceived barriers to trade in cyber security, as well as creating opportunities for companies to explore partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METI and the DBT should further explore providing a landing-pad function for the UK’s and Japan’s cyber-security companies. This would complement other efforts, for example the Industry 100 scheme including Japanese firms with a UK presence, to demonstrate the opportunities for British and Japanese businesses. Non- or quasi-governmental organisations, especially trade and industry bodies (for example, Keidanren, the Confederation of British Industry and the National Cyber Advisory Board – NCAB), should also be facilitated to support bilateral commercial opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Explore further opportunities to expand national PPPs to include UK or Japanese companies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government organisations operating national PPPs should assess whether they can expand these schemes to include foreign (Japanese/UK) companies. This should include multiple types of initiative, such as cyber threat intelligence sharing and personnel secondments. The UK has begun to take this approach through the Industry 100 scheme, admitting two Japanese companies with a UK presence. Japan could consider a similar approach in the Cyber Defence Council (a defence industry PPP) through the Cybersecurity Council, or by inviting secondees from UK companies with a Japanese presence into the NISC. For this to happen, however, UK companies would need to expand their presence in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Advancing Shared International Interests&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK and Japan are like-minded liberal democracies that share many geopolitical concerns and ambitions. Both support a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific”, value a responsible approach to cyber, and face common adversaries. The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership provides an effective channel through which cooperation to achieve shared international interests can be expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Promote the AJCCBC as a hub for CCB in ASEAN, use it as a model in the Indo-Pacific and develop cooperative offerings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JICA and the FCDO should develop joint CCB projects leveraging existing initiatives. These projects should use current products/services such as CYDER (Cyber Defense Exercise with Recurrence) trainings delivered by the MIC, and Cyber Security Capacity Maturity Models developed by Oxford University. The FCDO should also consider expanding its deployment of CCB activities in ASEAN via the AJCCBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JICA should explore linking the AJCCBC more closely with other Indo-Pacific centres of cyber excellence on CCB and other topics, for example the ASEAN Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence and the Global Forum for Cyber Expertise’s Pacific Hub. This would involve building on existing regular exchanges between the AJCCBC and these organisations. The FCDO should offer to support this effort, drawing on its experience of coordinating and implementing CCB activities and its commitment to Indo-Pacific security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annual UK–Japan cyber dialogues should commit to discuss and, where possible, strategically align decision-making about CCB. This alignment should entail deconfliction at a minimum. More ambitious alignment would include coordinating efforts to improve regional partners’ cyber resilience and defence to deter, deny and disrupt adversaries. The 2024 UK–Japan cyber dialogue should consider Mongolia and Taiwan as high-priority partners for trilateral engagement on CCB. In the latter case, this is more likely to involve peer-to-peer-type activities, such as joint exercising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Pursue closer collaboration to promote international rules and norms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the UK should expand and continue to align structural and activity-based cooperation on international rules and norms. The FCDO, MOFA and other ministries participating in international structures, such as the Counter Ransomware Initiative or the UN Open-Ended Working Group, should, where possible, adopt consistent positions. They should further work cooperatively to advocate for a free, fair, responsible and open cyberspace among countries that have not committed to this principle, particularly in ASEAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FCDO, MOFA and relevant technical agencies should continue to actively identify opportunities for joint attribution or statements that reiterate their positions on international rules and norms in cyberspace. An example of this is Japanese support for the UK’s attribution of APT31, a Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat actor, in March 2024. Reforms to clearances and increased information sharing will enable more joint statements, as will focusing attribution efforts on less sensitive adversaries. Nonetheless, both partners should appreciate the other’s specific thresholds and willingness to make public statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Align proactive international cyber crisis support efforts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ministries of defence and foreign affairs and relevant technical agencies should explore cooperation on proactive international cyber support to third countries at high risk of experiencing large-scale cyber incidents. Engagement on proactive international cyber crisis support should include identification of cooperation activities and alignment on strategic priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation activities could include joint deployment in initiatives in the style of hunt forward operations. Additionally, relevant government departments should share lessons identified through providing international crisis support to, for example, Ukraine. From this, the UK and Japan should discuss involvement in a jointly funded mechanism to respond to large-scale incidents in third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When expanding cooperation on international cyber crisis support activities, the UK and Japan should clearly set remits, thresholds and priorities for these activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Cyber-Resilient Ecosystems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber-resilient ecosystems rely on clear, well-assigned roles and responsibilities across government. Since establishing the NCSC in 2016, the UK has made few changes to its cyber governance; Japan is in the midst of major reforms to its cyber governance. The UK and Japan are both actively considering how, where, and when to regulate cyber security. Both countries are outside the orbits of the largest regulators: the EU; China; and the US. Cooperation on governing cyber security is important as each country navigates a complex global regulatory environment. With the UK planning a new Cyber Security Resilience Bill and Japan committed to the reforms discussed above, cooperation on cyber-resilient ecosystems and the necessary reforms should be seen as a “two-way street” as the Partnership progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Provide consolidated learnings from the development of government structures and processes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In partnership with other relevant government departments and former officials, the NCSC should provide a consolidated summary of UK cyber structural and legislative reforms since 2016. Areas of importance within this summary are: responsibly using investigatory powers; the creation of structures to integrate confidential and non-sensitive intelligence; the expansion of PPPs from operational to strategic functions; and the development of products to support whole-of-society cyber security. Japan’s Cybersecurity Strategic Headquarters and the NISC could use this resource to inform their reorganisation, while also providing feedback to British counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Discuss learnings from the development of military cyber functions and enabling processes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Cyber Force, the MoD, armed forces and intelligence services should continue to conduct bilateral dialogues with Japan’s SDF and JMoD, including its Cyber Defence Group and Defence Intelligence Headquarters. There should be a focus on discussions of processes to declassify and share information and the development of cyber capabilities in a responsible and transparent manner – each was considered a priority concern by several Japanese government interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Pursue mutual recognition of cyber professionals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSIT, METI and relevant national bodies, such as the UK NCSC, should explore mutual recognition of cyber professional standards. This effort should aim to integrate with the existing Cyber Skills Partnership between the UK and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Create a bi-annual dialogue to explore standards alignment and interoperability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSIT and METI should lead and coordinate bi-annual dialogues to promote alignment on cyber security and related standards. These should reinforce existing efforts on app security, AI and the Internet of Things, by addressing areas such as software supply chain security and industrial control systems. The UK Department of Business and Trade and METI should also work with industry to identify where interoperability is most important to promote trade, including schemes such as Cyber Essentials, which are required to compete for UK government contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Other&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the priorities of the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership should determine most bilateral cyber cooperation, actors should not be closed to other opportunities. Dispersed cooperation with multiple points of contact between the governments presents many opportunities, but may be hard to track centrally and could draw resources from priority areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: Continue supporting enabling engagement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sufficient funding should be committed to ensure proper cross-government representation at annual cyber dialogues. Maintaining person-to-person relationships is crucial to achieve mutual ambitions for an increased tempo of bilateral engagement on cyber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued visits by senior officials and government representatives should also be pursued. Top-down pressure provides government officials with motivation and authority to prioritise bilateral efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: Deepen partnership on cyber education.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the UK’s Department for Education, and relevant higher education authorities should explore measures to encourage university-level partnerships on cyber security. These should include promoting joint degree programmes between universities and exploring special exemptions or allowances for language tests to encourage higher-education mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevant departments should assess the effectiveness of the pilot Japan Cyber Fellowship and Cyber First competition, and determine whether to expand the programme. Further activities should be trialled across all stages of education to test whether bilateral engagement can promote better safety and skills outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Produce a report every two to three years assessing the UK–Japan Cyber Partnership.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primary responsible organisations (likely the FCDO, MOFA, the NISC or the NCSC) should continue to regularly review the progress of the Cyber Partnership to assess areas of success, learning and further opportunity. This assessment should also be used to examine whether the existing remit of the Partnership is sufficient. Within the assessment, both countries should commit to an approach to implementing the objectives of the Partnership that can be measured against agreed milestones. While aspects of this assessment cannot be made public, the UK and Japan should commit to releasing a progress report similar to those issued by the Japan–UK Digital Partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation on cyber security between Japan and the UK effectively furthers mutual interests through specific operational activities, and enables the wider partnership. The UK–Japan Cyber Partnership should aspire to continue the momentum of its first year and expand the depth and breadth of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has provided an overview of the activities and strategic priorities of the Partnership and has set out recommendations for its development. Current priorities within the Partnership are appropriate and provide opportunities to develop further activities. Furthermore, engagement outside the remit of set priorities represents an opportunity to expand the scope of the Partnership. Cooperation on cyber-resilient ecosystems would recognise existing efforts while also creating more space for engagement, particularly on digital government, technology standards and structural reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is significant space to expand activities across existing priorities. Japan and the UK both face challenges in scaling, developing and retaining cyber capabilities. Exchanging knowledge, identifying opportunities to cooperate, and sharing information can help to strengthen capability. Promoting commercial cooperation is a priority for the Partnership. Issues such as differences in language present challenges, but platforms to lower barriers to entry exist for companies, and there is a clear value case for users and providers. Worsening geopolitical tensions present concerns for both countries. Increasing cyber cooperation to advance shared international interests should include a focus on CCB, closer alignment on rules and norms, and consideration of international cyber crisis response efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Partnership can expect to continue benefiting from key drivers. Japan and the UK are closely aligned, exist within a network of common partners and face similar challenges and opportunities from cyber security. They share long-term joint initiatives, such as the GCAP, which provide a platform for close engagement over the long term. Japanese partnership with Pillar II of the AUKUS programme on advanced technologies would add to this. Nevertheless, the Partnership faces speedbumps which, if unresolved, could impede the pace and scope of activity. These include the need to tackle issues relating to information sharing and ensuring that the Partnership is sustainably resourced in a context of competing priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the UK’s new Labour government conducts its national security review, its approach to nuclear modernisation will send a crucial message to the US. The UK’s nuclear deterrent is not just a national asset; it is a cornerstone of NATO’s collective defence strategy. How Labour navigates this issue will have far-reaching implications for transatlantic relations and the future of the Western alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of the UK’s nuclear capabilities was recently underscored by the US Strategic Posture Commission. In its comprehensive report, the Commission emphasised the critical role of the UK’s nuclear forces in maintaining NATO’s deterrence posture. The report explicitly states: “The United Kingdom and France provide important nuclear forces that contribute to the NATO Alliance. The United Kingdom, in particular, contributes to deterrence and complicates adversary planning with its independent nuclear arsenal.” This assessment highlights how the UK’s submarine-based deterrent enhances the credibility of NATO’s nuclear policy and presents additional strategic challenges for potential adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Keir Starmer has repeatedly emphasised the importance of maintaining the UK’s nuclear deterrent. In a recent speech, he stated: “A strong, modernised nuclear capability is not just a pillar of our national defence – it’s a cornerstone of our commitment to NATO and global security.” This clear stance from the former opposition leader underscores the cross-party support for nuclear modernisation in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commitment to nuclear modernisation was recently strengthened by the UK’s 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy. In a bold move, the review announced an increase in the UK’s nuclear weapon stockpile cap from 180 to 260 warheads. This decision demonstrated the UK’s resolve and ability to be flexible in the face of evolving global threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starmer has expressed support for this decision, noting: “In an increasingly unpredictable world, we must ensure our deterrent remains effective. The increase in our stockpile cap is a necessary step to safeguard our national security and uphold our NATO obligations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A clear and unambiguous commitment from the UK to a fully resourced nuclear modernisation programme would serve as a powerful demonstration of burden-sharing and alliance solidarity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s commitment to nuclear modernisation was further reinforced in March 2024 with the publication of “Delivering the UK’s Nuclear Deterrent as a National Endeavour”. This strategic document reaffirms the critical importance of the nuclear deterrent to UK national security and outlines a comprehensive approach to resourcing and upgrading the country’s nuclear capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the paper emphasises several key points that underscore the UK’s unique position in global nuclear deterrence. Firstly, it highlights that the UK is the only power besides the US that has pledged its nuclear deterrent to NATO, underscoring the UK’s indispensable role in the alliance’s overall deterrence strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the document recognises the UK’s critical role in helping the US confront what it terms a “two peer problem” – referring to the challenge posed by simultaneously deterring both Russia and China. It stresses that with the right support from the US, in line with historical agreements, the UK can play a pivotal part in addressing this complex geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the paper acknowledges the significant challenges ahead and outlines a comprehensive response. Under the banner of a “National Endeavour,” it proposes mobilising a wide set of measures to ensure the continued effectiveness and credibility of the UK’s nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starmer has praised this document, stating, “The March 2024 strategic review provides a clear roadmap for ensuring our nuclear forces remain cutting-edge and capable of meeting future challenges. Labour fully supports this forward-looking approach to our nuclear policy, recognising it truly as a national endeavour.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Labour now conducts its own national security review, it must carefully consider these key points and translate rhetorical assurances into concrete policy decisions and resource allocations. The review should build upon this foundation, exploring ways to further enhance the UK’s nuclear capabilities and its contribution to NATO’s deterrence posture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where the UK could demonstrate its commitment to a robust nuclear deterrent is by considering the adoption of a nuclear capability outside its current Continual at-Sea Deterrent construct. Currently, the UK relies solely on its submarine-based Trident missiles. While this system has proven effective, diversifying the nuclear arsenal to include a second delivery method could enhance flexibility and resilience. The original Polaris Sales Agreement could serve as a model for future engagement and additional capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signals sent by Labour’s ongoing review will be particularly significant in the context of an increased emphasis on allied burden-sharing. A clear and unambiguous commitment from the UK to a fully resourced nuclear modernisation programme, to include a second delivery platform, would serve as a powerful demonstration of burden-sharing and alliance solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a strong UK nuclear posture would help maintain strategic stability in an era of renewed great power competition. As Russia continues its aggressive behaviour and China rapidly expands its nuclear capabilities, the deterrent value of Western nuclear forces has only grown. The UK’s nuclear arsenal, though smaller than that of the US or Russia, plays a vital role in this broader deterrence landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high, and the world will be watching closely. Translating the new prime minister’s rhetoric on nuclear modernisation into action and resources will help ensure the continued effectiveness of the Western deterrent and the stability of the transatlantic alliance for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously argued, international diplomacy continues to prioritise engagement between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This binary thinking is understandable given that what little attention Sudan receives is fixated on delivering greater humanitarian access and a workable ceasefire – outcomes that are sorely needed. By every measure, the situation remains catastrophic. Roughly 26 million people (over 51% of the population) face acute food insecurity (the worst levels ever recorded by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification in-country); nearly 9 million are displaced, up to 5 million of them children; and over 2 million are now refugees. Against this backdrop, reports suggest “national cereal production [has] collapsed by almost half”, correlating with an 83% hike in the price of basic goods. Despite considerable “data gaps”, monitors accurately predicted (manmade) famine conditions by June; fatalities could exceed 2 million by late September and hit up to 10 million by 2027. With fighting across the breadbasket states of Gezira and Sennar, many in the worst affected areas are already “eating leaves to survive”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, relief efforts appear hampered by theft, violence, poor logistics and superfluous bureaucracy. Crossing the frontline is a “deliberately time-consuming” process, with SAF originally banning the “delivery of supplies via Chad” and blockading Khartoum. In March, the RSF likewise barred aid from Port Sudan from reaching El-Fashar. Trucks have often been confiscated and local responders “harassed, detained, and otherwise abused”. Visas, travel permits, and operating licences are routinely withheld by the military-backed Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC), a well-established front for profiteering recently emulated by Hemedti’s Sudan Agency for Relief and Humanitarian Operations (SARHO). Elsewhere, warehouse raids persist – in one case, militiamen looted stock that could have fed 1.5 million people for a month – and stories are emerging of NGO workers coerced, on video, into saying that the RSF has “acted in accordance with international humanitarian law”. Even without this disruption, there is a risk that aid modalities themselves are becoming outdated: unlike rural, highly localised crises of the past, Sudan is now grappling with a nationwide, largely urbanised food emergency – dynamics the “UN…[has] little experience in addressing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramping up and refining the response is therefore a priority, one the global community continues to bungle. Of the $2.3 billion requested by UN stakeholders in 2023, for instance, only 43% was eventually secured. Even after the much-hyped Paris Conference in April, donors stumped up less than 50% of this year’s appeal, pledges deemed “gravely inadequate” by Médecins Sans Frontières. While resourcing for Sudan’s “Emergency Response Rooms” – volunteer support networks – has gradually improved, many international organisations also face administrative and structural difficulties in accommodating mutual aid methodologies, which prioritise “community accountability ahead of traditional NGO reporting”. Instead, UN recognition of SAF as the country’s legitimate authority leaves interventions truncated and increasingly susceptible to extortion. Though pragmatic, such approaches are defined by long-standing perceptions of state-centric dependency, tempering the leverage humanitarians could otherwise exert. As experts like Joshua Craze, Kholood Khair and Raga Makawi make clear, better arrangements are possible, however imperfect they may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparable problems characterise efforts to impose a ceasefire or, crucially, to prevent a possible genocide. Amid explicit patterns of ethnic cleansing – identity-based pogroms, an erasure of cultural signifiers, mass killings, expulsions and sexual violence – external engagement has generally remained disjointed and inconsistent. Before June’s declaration on El-Fashar, the UN Security Council had only passed a single resolution calling for a (temporary) cessation of hostilities. Mutasim Ali and Yonah Diamond have also criticised major powers for failing to “take decisive action” or even “name the genocidaires and their sponsors” – diplomatic posturing that has “not changed [significantly] since the first weeks of the war”. Although UK officials were relatively quick in adopting more appropriate language, a drip-feed of sanctions with little coordination between London, DC and Brussels is unlikely to have any real effect on RSF decision-making. Notably, US senators are still debating whether to pursue Hemedti personally, despite mounting evidence of “gross human rights” violations. Yes, this could reflect long-standing discrepancies between atrocity prevention and conflict resolution, but it also speaks to a fundamental lack of vision over how external parties can constructively intervene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Successful humanitarian and peace-making processes must also account for the contested realities of the “new” Sudan, a very different political, societal and normative landscape to that of April 2023&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As John Prendergast, among others, argues, an effective sanctions strategy should, at the very least, target the (transnational) networks of “cutouts, collaborators, and companies” propping up RSF operations, designed multilaterally and iteratively to “account for any changes in nomenclature and structure”. While specific firms have been designated, such as Al-Junaid Multi Activities Co Ltd and Tradive General Trading, the RSF is allegedly affiliated with over 50 commercial entities, including shares in Al-Khaleej Bank. With relationships cross-cutting the UAE, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, this one node alone could reportedly provide second-order connections to the international financial system and even Friends of Sudan member-states, allowing stakeholders to skirt the (full) impact of economic penalties. Plugging these loopholes is therefore imperative. The entire breadth of complicity from the aleutaawa (pro-RSF communities from Darfur and Kordofan) must also be mapped out, exposing the middlemen responsible for translating Hemedti’s policies into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, concerted pressure should be piled onto regional enablers sustaining the RSF’s military capabilities. Although Abu Dhabi denies the claims, a UN assessment cites “credible” allegations of weapons shipments – multiple-rocket launchers, howitzers and anti-aircraft missiles – being smuggled over the Chadian border, with wounded fighters medevac-ed the other way. Accounts similarly describe a web of brokers and local proxies stretching across the Central African Republic, Libya, South Sudan and Uganda, disguising munition flows as humanitarian aid. Quadcopter drones have dropped 120mm mortar rounds purportedly tracing back to UAE stockpiles, and Emirati passports were recovered from RSF-occupied Omdurman, feeding claims of covert deployments. At the same time, Sudanese gold is reportedly still finding its way to Dubai’s souks, supplementing erstwhile shipments of RSF bullion – packaged as “cookies” – to Russian bases in Syria (liquidity that previously kept a cash-strapped Kremlin afloat in exchange for armaments and tech).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there has been movement in recent months – US legislation threatened to suspend arms sales to the UAE over its support for Hemedti; the Treasury Department blacklisted “seven Emirati-based companies” for sanctions violations; and diplomatic pressure did appear to delay the assault on El-Fashar – this is far from sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;structural-changes-and-long-term-problems&quot;&gt;Structural Changes and Long-Term Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving these efforts is not only urgent but entirely feasible. However, a genuine resolution to the conflict goes far beyond negotiation strategies or immediate crisis management. Successful humanitarian and peace-making processes must also account for the contested realities of the “new” Sudan, a very different political, societal and normative landscape to that of April 2023. There is little space to provide a full exposition of such dynamics, but as the first round of talks in Geneva conclude, it is worth exploring a few structural issues that will inevitably condition the efficacy and longevity of any intended outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, violence is inherently transformative, reshaping both the conflict parties themselves and the ecosystems they inhabit. In this context, the distortion of Sudan’s political economy is already immense. Khartoum and the wider “Hamdi Triangle” – a middle-income enclave of industry, investment and trade – is beset by power outages and daily shelling. Labour displacement, infrastructural damage, and severed supply lines continue to cripple productivity, with the IMF predicting an 18.3% contraction in GDP by late 2024 (following a 12% decline the previous year). Crucially, this has been accompanied by a wave of primitive accumulation, with the ransacking of Sudanese cities upending much of the post-colonial dispensation. Whereas in the past, a riverain elite – the Jellaba – ran a predatory system of resource extraction, “reap[ing] profits in the provinces and plough[ing] them into Khartoum”, the inverse is becoming readily apparent, as vehicles, household goods, and heavy machinery are funnelled to Darfur. Makeshift entrepôts – “Dagalo markets” – have quickly sprouted up, brokering everything from stolen cars and mobile-phones to oil, gold and electronics. While the mechanics of this “destructive economy” are not necessarily new, the scale of wealth redistribution from core to periphery may be unprecedented. These shifts have also been accompanied by rapid demographic changes, with affluent neighbourhoods now reportedly occupied by 80,000 “RSF families” and rural tribesmen. Across Darfur, the transformation is even more acute after the expulsion of non-Arab residents from towns and villages. Amid virulent strains of ethno-populism, Sudanese society – with all its attendant norms, hierarchies and assumptions – is therefore being reconfigured, introducing a new set of power dynamics that will define the scope, resonance and durability of any political settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analogous – albeit less radical – changes are evident in SAF territory, with most of the country’s institutional, military and industrial architecture being transposed to Port Sudan. This raises its own problems, not least by disturbing local political arrangements that tie back to the Juba Peace Agreement (2021) and Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement (2006). A rapid injection of international assistance and financing, for example, has already provoked disputes around land and compensation rights, compounding divisions within the Beja Nazir Council. Of course, the implicit creation of a new capital could be beneficial over time, diffusing commercial monopolies previously confined to Khartoum and fostering growth in otherwise neglected regions. But given the city’s limited capacity, and ethnic and class-based cleavages, this shift may, in the short term, not only be detrimental for the efficiency of Sudan’s post-war economy but also drive further instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the securitisation of the country’s agro-industry poses massive complications for tackling food scarcity. Unsurprisingly, war has proved deleterious for producers, processors and exporters alike. The cumulative impact of untilled farmland, lost harvests, and seed shortages is devastating, with cultivated acreage across Darfur and Kordofan dropping by over 65%. At the same time, damage to El-Obeid and Khartoum – vital markets for livestock and crops, with the latter home to most large-scale factories – has effectively paralysed the sector. The issue is not only material but structural, with violence precipitating shifts in agency and power. While SAF and the RSF have always been prominent in the country’s food system, the fighting has consolidated and expanded their duopoly, squeezing out independent smallholders and rival businesses. This raises serious problems, particularly if domestic supply chains become wholly dependent on two ever more unstable cartels. Starvation tactics applied liberally across southern Sudan in the 1990s are evident again today, used to compel local recruitment and to depopulate towns. Both sides are likewise prioritising conflict over commerce, with knock-on effects for agricultural output. Operations are either suspended – as is the case with SAF’s Military Economic Corporation – or placed on a war footing, impacting the long-term capacity (and inclination) to feed civilians, and hampering the sustainability of humanitarian outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the conflict’s regionalisation has important implications for peace-making. Amid porous boundaries, weak institutions and patrimonial politics, cross-border clientelism is not new to Sudan, with experts describing a well-established “rentier system” of extraversion and graft. Accordingly, the role of transnational sponsors and spoilers – the UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Russia and, recently, Iran – has received significant coverage, and is rightly viewed as a determining factor for any resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Refugee flows are already placing a massive strain on under-resourced borderlands, and the circulation of small arms, drones and heavy weaponry poses a direct threat to regional stability&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But violence has also assumed its own momentum, diffusing along the kinship, patronage and political networks that enmesh Sahelian states together. Over 18,000 “ethno-mercenaries” have supposedly joined the RSF alone, drawn from across the “Baggara Belt” – a confederacy of nomadic tribes spanning from Darfur to Niger. Additionally, the fighting is starting to intersect with neighbouring disputes. Reports suggest Tigrayan militants could be collaborating with SAF in Sennar, raising concerns of possible “tit-for-tat” cooperation between the RSF and “Fano”, a loose assortment of ethno-nationalist militias in Amhara waging a “low intensity insurgency” against federal authorities. Eritrea is purportedly training “popular resistance” groups from Eastern Sudan, further militarising local social dynamics and creating a “time-bomb” for renewed inter-communal hostilities. In Chad, freshly “elected” President Mahamat Déby has received Emirati loans amounting to $1.5 billion (equivalent to 83% of his annual budget) – a deal coinciding with alleged UAE weapons shipments starting to reach Hemedti via Amdjarass. Yet he also faces growing pressure from local Zaghawa communities – the powerbase of his regime – demanding material support for co-ethnic, anti-RSF paramilitaries in Darfur. With further massacres threatening El-Fashar, these competing priorities may not only upend Déby’s ruling coalition but inflame ethno-regional tensions across Chadian society more widely. Elsewhere, unrest in White Nile State led to a provincial pump station running out of diesel, a seemingly banal hiccup that eventually precipitated “gelling” issues along South Sudan’s Petrodar pipeline. With the route previously channelling 100,000 barrels of crude per day – 60% of Juba’s oil production – to Sudan’s Bashayer terminal on the Red Sea, the blockage effectively cuts off an “insolvent kleptocracy” from its main financial lifeline (roughly 90% of foreign exchange earnings). Without the cash to keep “factious security elites in check”, the payroll peace underpinning President Salva Kiir’s government looks increasingly untenable, risking yet another humanitarian catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These externalities are not unique. War tends to be contagious, spilling over national borders and metastasising into complex, highly inter-dependent systems of insecurity. Libya is indicative, with state collapse facilitating the transnational “proliferation of [guns], jihadists, traffickers, and gangsters”. Analysts fear Sudan may prove even worse. Refugee flows are already placing a massive strain on under-resourced borderlands, and the circulation of small arms, drones and heavy weaponry – especially man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS) – poses a direct threat to regional stability. In this context, civil wars often start as endogenous processes, but they rarely stay that way, evolving into “wicked problems” of global proportions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fraught-realities-of-now&quot;&gt;The Fraught Realities of Now&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, the limitations of what former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok calls the “Sudanese model” of peace-making – namely elite bargains between military and civilians – are well documented. As Payton Knopf argues, diplomatic efforts like Jeddah and Geneva fail on several counts: mistakenly assuming that securocrat power-sharing offers a basis for stability; that ceasefires end violence or are a “prerequisite for doing so”; and that “political legitimacy is less important than coercive force”. This flawed logic is not a recent aberration, but has marred international engagement for decades, rewarding militancy while undervaluing (or undermining) civic agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these interventions can quickly be improved: they will not resolve the war in its entirety, but they may help temper its worst excesses and better address immediate humanitarian needs. However, any sustainable solution must also confront the realities of Sudan today. The warring parties have fragmented and multiplied: SAF is a bricolage of competing interests and ideologies, while the RSF appears bound together by little more than spoliation. Amid massive structural problems, any deal between Hemedti and al-Burhan is subsequently unlikely to trickle down or resonate in a meaningful way. With the country now at a “cataclysmic breaking point”, mediators can no longer afford to “shelve” the broader political issues feeding the conflict. They should be embedded into discussions from the outset, otherwise the same mistakes (and shortcomings) will be continually repeated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variety of forces are promoting reindustrialization of the United States. Concerned about the fragility of long supply chains, some firms are reinvesting in U.S. production. They are enabled by government support ranging from tax subsidies for capital investment to active support for strategic industries that will keep the United States at the technological frontier or that relate closely to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding manufacturing in the United States inevitably raises questions for energy policy. Energy security, resilience, and affordability are important factors for business competitiveness, and each influences how and where companies locate manufacturing facilities. Companies are also focusing on their emissions footprints, as carbon intensity affects corporate emissions accounting and will impact the global trade of manufactured goods due to the implementation of border adjustments in Europe and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of natural gas in reshoring manufacturing is an important consideration for policymakers. Gas supplied 43 percent of U.S. power in 2023, and the expansion of gas in the power sector over the last 20 years has helped to reduce emissions, expand renewables, and lower prices. As policymakers consider how to address emissions while increasing power supply for strategic industries, they must decide on frameworks for natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To probe these issues, this paper examines the energy requirements of some key manufacturing sectors and their emissions implications, assesses the role of natural gas in supporting strategic manufacturing, and analyzes the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing from a carbon-intensity perspective. This paper presents the key findings from CSIS’s research — including from a literature survey, data analysis, workshops, and stakeholder interviews — and policy recommendations on how the United States can maintain competitiveness while furthering decarbonization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reshoring-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Reshoring Manufacturing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, investments in new manufacturing facilities have accelerated in the United States, driven by two key sectors: semiconductors and electric vehicles (EVs). Remarkably, real spending on construction of computer and electrical manufacturing facilities, including semiconductor and EV battery manufacturing, has nearly quadrupled since the beginning of 2022. By April 2024, project announcements reached $367.9 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and $84.4 billion for EV manufacturing. These industries now account for nearly 60 percent of all manufacturing investment in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both market and strategic imperatives are driving these investments. Chipmakers aim to diversify supply chains beyond East Asia and move closer to the U.S. market, while automakers and their suppliers are investing to meet growing demand. Federal government support, driven by the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, is accelerating these trends. Supply chain vulnerabilities for semiconductors increase national security and economic risks, while reshoring and rerouting the EV battery supply chain helps advance the nation’s decarbonization efforts and supports the tactical and operational demands of the U.S. military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration aims for the United States to produce 20 percent of global leading-edge logic chips and for EVs to comprise 50 percent of new vehicle sales by 2030. Taking into account uncertainties in future sales and value chains, forecasts of battery manufacturing capacity vary widely. The Rhodium Group estimates that if all investments announced since 2018 are realized, they would create 1,062–1,288 gigawatt hours (GWh) of domestic cell and module production capacity in 2030. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence forecasts a more modest 588 GWh of domestic battery production capacity in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;energy-and-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Energy and Manufacturing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, energy consumption by the semiconductor and EV sectors in the United States is a small fraction of the total energy consumption by U.S. manufacturing. According to 2018 U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, energy consumption in the semiconductor and EV sectors is far lower than in sectors such as chemicals and petroleum refining (Table 1). However, such comparisons predate the active U.S. policy for reshoring and could change as these sectors grow in significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pCemZas.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: U.S. Manufacturing Energy Consumption by Sector, 2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public data on energy consumption by the semiconductor and EV sectors is scarce because new facilities are only being announced and built now and anticipated energy use is commercially sensitive. The data average derived from multiple papers surveyed by CSIS suggests the need for 44 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of average energy consumption to produce 1 kWh of EV battery capacity. At that intensity, the 1,000 GWh of potential battery manufacturing capacity forecasted for 2030 would require 44,000 GWh of energy consumption, or approximately 150 trillion British thermal units (Btu). However, energy usage estimates vary across studies due to different methods and data sources. Many rely on data that is over a decade old and that likely differs from current usage, given industry growth and efficiency improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, according to a 2021 regulatory document, a new Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) fabrication site in Arizona is estimated to use 1,200 megawatts (MW), which at 99 percent capacity would be equivalent to about 30 trillion Btu. That is roughly equivalent to the peak power output of a Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactor or one-tenth of the installed capacity of natural gas combined-cycle plants in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the dearth of authoritative energy use estimates, both the administration’s goals and the $452.3 billion (actual and planned) invested in the semiconductor and EV manufacturing sectors combined through April 2024 suggest significant energy demand growth. Moreover, the expansion of strategic manufacturing will expectedly induce additional energy demand in other sectors, such as steel and aluminum production. Even with efficiency advancement in manufacturing processes, increased demand from reshoring will be happening at the same time as pronounced load growth nationally, creating supply risks for energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, projections over the next 10 years are already pointing to a higher electricity growth forecast than at any point in the past decade, including summer peak demand growth of 79 gigawatts (GW) and winter peak demand growth of 91 GW, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;natural-gas-and-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Natural Gas and Manufacturing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades, the role of natural gas in the U.S. economy has risen dramatically. Enabled by shale production, U.S. dry gas production has grown from 18 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in 2005 to 38 Tcf in 2023, with consumption increasing from 22 Tcf to 33 Tcf over the same period. For most of that period, the Henry Hub natural gas price has been below $5 per million Btu (MMBtu), easing the cost of higher consumption throughout the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pl6ECoC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: The Major Role of Natural Gas in Electricity Generation and the Industrial Sector, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low energy prices are associated with manufacturing competitiveness. In general, economic studies find a small positive effect on manufacturing output and employment from lower gas prices enabled by U.S. production. A working paper for the Federal Reserve first released in 2014 found that the decrease in natural gas prices between 2006 and 2013 contributed to an increase in manufacturing output by 2 to 3 percent across the whole manufacturing sector. The increase appears to be higher in more energy-intensive sectors, such as fertilizer production. A similar study published in 2021 found roughly similar effects, verifying a larger body of literature produced in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry players expect that natural gas will continue to play a key role in meeting growing energy demands. In the most recent long-term reliability assessment, published in 2023, NERC sees natural gas remaining a “critical resource” for the U.S. electric power supply in many areas. Particularly in winter, natural gas power plants will provide “necessary reliability attributes . . . as traditional generators retire and inverter-based renewable resources take their place in the resource mix.” Goldman Sachs expects natural gas to meet about 60 percent of additional load growth from expanding data centers and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilities in states attracting manufacturing investment are re-elevating natural gas in resource planning. Arizona is one of the major destination states for actual and planned investments in both EV batteries ($3.7 billion) and semiconductor manufacturing ($100.7 billion). One of the leading utilities in the state, Arizona Public Service (APS), projects the energy needs through 2038 in its service territory to increase at 3.7 percent annually to 23,700 GWh — about 55 percent from data center expansions and 24 percent from large industrial activities (inclusive of demand-side management and efficiency gains). This projected growth translates into about 3,400 MW of capacity needs in the next 15 years. Particularly in light of its planned exit from coal-fired generation in 2031, APS views natural gas — including hydrogen-capable natural gas combustion turbines — as a means to ensure reliability while expanding renewables and energy storage resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story in Georgia is similar. A massive economic expansion since January 2022 led Georgia Power to file an update to its 2022 integrated resource plan (IRP) in October 2023. The utility projects electricity load growth of 6,600 MW through 2030–31, which is about 17 times larger than what it anticipated in its 2022 IRP. During the first half of 2023, the manufacturing sector — including solar, EVs, and aerospace — was leading the state’s economic growth, representing 67 percent of job creation and 81 percent of the capital investment. Georgia Power views natural gas as crucial for a cost-effective and reliable low-carbon transition, complementing energy storage resources that have limited time duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prices&quot;&gt;Prices&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present forecasts for U.S. gas production show that rising consumption will be accompanied by rising prices. The EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2023 forecasts a 0.5 percent growth in the domestic supply of dry gas and a price level increase of 0.4 percent through 2050. While the trajectory for production growth is relatively linear, the forecasted price increase of 0.4 percent, from $6.52 per MMBtu in 2022 to $7.23 in 2050, is accompanied by a notable dip to below $3.50 in the late 2020s (Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ofhSsKQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Outlooks for U.S. Natural Gas Supply and Henry Hub Prices through 2050&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, natural gas consultancy Wood Mackenzie’s forecasts show that large increases in gas consumption — from data center operation, chip manufacturing, and liquefied natural gas exports — will not lead to a significant price increase. Corresponding to its upward revision in the U.S. gas demand projection for the early 2040s from 13 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) under the 2022 version to 30 Bcf/d, Wood Mackenzie’s latest forecasts are for Henry Hub to reach $4 per MMcf by the mid-to-late 2030s, and closer to $6 per MMcf through the 2040s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;emissions&quot;&gt;Emissions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural gas plays a significant role in the energy system, and expanding gas consumption raises potential challenges for meeting ambitious zero-carbon targets for the power sector. The continued use of coal-fired generation and changes in the dispatch order for generations make evaluating the emissions impact of additional capacity challenging to estimate outside of a modeling framework. In the meantime, about two-thirds of the states where strategic manufacturing is on rise are below the national average in terms of the carbon intensity of their electric power supply. The map below shows the top 10 recipient states of actual and planned investments in semiconductors and EV manufacturing, as well as the carbon intensity of associated power generation and the percentage contribution from natural gas in each state (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;carbon-competitiveness&quot;&gt;Carbon Competitiveness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world moves toward net-zero emissions, how much CO2 emissions companies and industries produce will affect their competitiveness. More firms must now report direct and indirect emissions as part of their Scope 1 and 2 emissions accounting. As carbon pricing or similar regulations spread, lower-emissions production will be more profitable, as prices will reflect emissions intensity. Even if the United States delays implementing national climate regulations, markets will value lower-emissions production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) now exposes U.S. exporters to climate-related trade rules for certain goods. While these measures will not immediately affect semiconductors or EV batteries, they will apply to commodities such as steel, aluminum, and chemicals. In these areas, U.S. producers have some carbon advantage over international competitors such as China but may trail producers in Europe. For products crucial for decarbonization, such as EV batteries, the carbon output of manufacturing will remain important in life-cycle analysis and could soon affect commercial decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, both Democratic and Republican leaders see benefits in highlighting how efficient the U.S. economy and manufacturing specifically are with respect to emissions. In April 2024, the Biden administration formed a climate and trade task force to address the neglect of emissions from imported goods in current trade policies. Announcing the task force, U.S. climate envoy John Podesta cautioned that ignoring these emissions unfairly advantages countries with high-carbon manufacturing, such as China. This echoes a frequent Republican claim that lax regulations overseas award foreign manufacturers an unfair advantage. Legislators are drafting proposals to study the relative carbon intensity of production and install carbon border adjustments across different product categories. At their most expansive, these proposals would apply beyond the small set of commodities covered by the European Union’s CBAM and include battery materials and other goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where carbon emissions matter in competition, U.S. manufacturing has a mixed advantage. U.S. industry produces semiconductors and EV batteries with less carbon than China thanks to cleaner energy generation, but it still trails Europe (Table 2). Although both the U.S. and Chinese power grids rely on fossil fuels, China’s higher use of coal power — 63 percent of its power generation compared to 23 percent in the United States as of 2021 — makes its manufacturing more carbon intensive, particularly as coal is more than twice as carbon intensive as natural gas. The European Union uses more emissions-free sources (deriving 37 percent of its power generation from renewable energy and 25 percent from nuclear energy) than the United States, reducing its emissions output. The degree of reliance on natural gas within power systems varies notably across the three economies: 38.4 percent in the United States, 19.9 percent in the European Union, and 3.3 percent in China as of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qaq8AW4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Emission Intensity of U.S. Semiconductor and EV Battery Manufacturing Compared to Europe and China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expansion of strategic manufacturing demands construction, which requires raw materials such as iron ore and aluminum. In supplying these resources, the United States has a relative advantage over major competitors such as China. A 2019 report comparing steel industry emissions across the 15 top steel-producing countries found that U.S. production is one of the least carbon intensive, while China ranked last. Similarly, North American aluminum production emits about half the global average rate, according to industry data. An industry report found that “the current emission intensity of aluminum products produced in China is 2.5 times [that] of [North American] domestic products, and the global aluminum product carbon intensity is 1.9 times [that] of [North American] domestic products.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;abatement-opportunities&quot;&gt;Abatement Opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, the expansion of gas in the power sector has reduced emissions as it has displaced coal. Using gas in the power and industrial sectors contributes to the relative emissions advantage of U.S. manufacturing. However, a path to net zero will require emissions abatement for all use cases of natural gas, as other emissions abatement opportunities will be exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three general options for reducing emissions from natural gas consumption. The first is reducing the emissions intensity of natural gas by producing renewable natural gas (or biomethane) or synthetic methane via clean hydrogen production. These methods are presently limited in potential scale and cost, respectively. The second option is using carbon capture and storage (CCS) on point sources where gas is combusted for power or heat, which can be costly but is scalable. The last option is reducing gas use to the point where remnant emissions can be offset using carbon removals. Of these three, the deployment of CCS on existing or new facilities is most likely to help square near-term energy demand growth and long-term climate ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy modeling indicates that deploying CCS can achieve rapid emissions reductions and the continued utilization of natural gas. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s 2023 Standard Scenarios Report found that gas capacity continues to expand across different scenarios, adding 200 GW through 2050 under current policy and 130 GW in the case that achieves a 95 percent emissions reduction in 2050. But in scenarios with strong and immediate emissions policies (net-zero electricity by 2035), natural gas with CCS can grow significantly — even after the emissions standards are in place — and provide as much generation in 2050 as it does today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of capture and a lack of pipeline infrastructure for CO2 are commonly cited reasons for not deploying CCS today. Even with subsidies, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) assesses combined-cycle natural gas generators to be a longer-term opportunity for deployment of CCS, meaning that it will be commercially viable after 2030. In the meantime, deployment of capture technologies in other sectors will help reduce costs and support infrastructure. The post-2030 timeline makes CCS a relevant consideration for utilities, power plant operators, and regulators today. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has already identified CCS as the best means of emissions reduction for natural gas generators in its rule for new emissions sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accelerate progress toward commercial deployment, the DOE has sponsored front-end engineering and design studies for retrofitting natural-gas-fired power plants with CCS technologies. Capital and finance costs dominate the total cost of retrofitting natural gas generation for carbon capture. In a DOE-sponsored study of the retrofit costs for a 750 MW gas plant in Texas, capital costs accounted for 70 percent of the cost of the retrofit, which totaled $477 million, or about $115 per ton of CO2 captured over 15 years. At present, there are reportedly eight planned or in process deployments of CCS on gas plants in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stakeholder-considerations&quot;&gt;Stakeholder Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strong outlook for energy demand growth introduces a range of qualitative considerations and concerns for energy planners and firms. Reliability, affordability, accessibility, and carbon intensity are some of the key considerations that shape stakeholder approaches to energy requirements from the strategic manufacturing sectors. What stakeholders value in addressing energy requirements may not vary significantly, but there is some diversity in how different stakeholders prioritize key attributes of energy supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturers:&lt;/strong&gt; Along with factors such as the availability of a skilled labor force, logistical infrastructure, and local political support, local energy resources shape manufacturers’ siting decisions. Energy considerations extend beyond securing large, low-cost supplies, though this remains crucial for manufacturers’ profitability. Energy reliability is a key priority for semiconductor manufacturers, as a “stoppage at any of its manufacturing stages can result in wasted batches.” The cost of a supply disruption can be significant. For example, Samsung reportedly incurred a $43.3 million loss in 2018 when a regional transmission cable failed, leaving its chip plant without power for 30 minutes. The need for an uninterrupted supply of electricity could accelerate interest from manufacturers in these sectors to seek on-site power generation assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon intensity is another major interest of manufacturers. Leading companies in EV battery and semiconductor manufacturing, as well as data center operators, have corporate sustainability commitments that include greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction commitments and energy conservation targets. EV battery manufacturers seem eager to procure clean power to produce the goods whose primary objective is to decarbonize the transportation sector. For example, Panasonic, LG Energy Solution, and SK hynix have pledged to achieve net-zero operational emissions by 2030 or 2040. These commitments may amount to a future where half of batteries would be made at factories that source at least 50 percent of their power demand from renewable energy sources by 2030. Battery manufacturers’ interest in a low-carbon supply chain has also manifested in exploration of the option of leveraging investment interests to facilitate a regional power supply mix, including coal plant closures. Also, leading U.S. semiconductor manufacturer Intel has pledged net-zero emissions by 2040 for both direct emissions from chip fabrication and purchased electricity, steam, and heating/cooling equipment, while semiconductor end users such as Microsoft and Amazon are committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2030 and 2040, respectively. However, a recent media report highlights the difficulty in accelerating, let alone maintaining, the pace of emissions reduction as AI business expands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Electric and gas utilities need to ensure the provision of energy to various customers — ranging from households to large-scale industrial users, including semiconductor and EV battery manufacturers — while sustaining a profitable business. The economics of various energy resources are important factors that utilities watch in planning what generation and transmission infrastructure is needed where and at what increments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The possibility of stranded assets is a major concern for utilities. They make plans for resource procurement (including by trade with neighboring states) and new infrastructure based on the best available energy data. Some view energy data availability as a primary challenge, whereas others find data analysis a bigger challenge. Some factors necessary for sound modeling are dynamic and difficult to analyze. Consumer preference in the case of modeling the growth of EV battery manufacturing capacity may be one such example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another complicating factor is the misalignment of the pace of decisionmaking among different stakeholders. For example, investment decisionmaking by manufacturers is generally much faster than the pace of planning by utilities, whether they operate in regulated or unregulated markets. Even when utilities recognize the demand growth, they often face delays in obtaining the permits required to build the necessary infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State Utility Regulators:&lt;/strong&gt; The principal mission of state utility regulators (e.g., public utility commissions, or PUCs) includes ensuring that energy supply is reliable, affordable, and accessible. Another key concern of state regulators is who pays for infrastructure that will be required to meet energy demand from expanding manufacturing. Conveying the net economic benefit for the state could be a challenge, as ratepayer interests can be more geographically segmented even within a state or such benefits may not be immediately apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clean energy use, including measures such as renewable portfolio standards, can also be part of oversight and regulatory consideration where the state legislature so mandates a state regulatory body. The impact of rapid growth in energy demand on clean energy mandates warrants close regulatory attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the level of concern regulators have regarding the risk of stranded assets seems to vary depending on whether utilities in each state operate as vertically integrated monopolies under PUC oversights or in unregulated markets. Regulators in regulated markets are likely more concerned with an overbuild of generation and transmission assets by utilities, as the economic loss from a stranded asset can be passed on to ratepayers. At the same time, a state PUC could be less concerned with a utility’s ability to build generation to meet the state’s energy demand, as investment decisions are made in close consultation with utilities, including through the IRP process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-observations-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Observations and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintaining economic competitiveness over higher-carbon manufacturers such as China and narrowing the intensity gap with Europe will require emissions reduction efforts throughout supply chains. The United States needs policies that help unlock the strategic value of natural gas to reestablish its industrial competitiveness while furthering decarbonization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, neither the CHIPS Act nor the IRA impose energy use or emissions-intensity requirements for tax credit eligibility on strategic manufacturing sectors, such as the semiconductor and EV battery sectors. An approach that imposes firm guidance on power procurement similar to the one proposed for hydrogen under the IRA (i.e., hourly matching, incrementality, and deliverability under the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit) is likely unfeasible in many strategic manufacturing cases. At the same time, it would incur significant costs and thus undermine project economics in most cases. The policy needs to be designed to foster the commercial feasibility of emerging strategic manufacturing while making material progress in emissions reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several areas are ripe for action by industry and government stakeholders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage strategic manufacturing sectors to collect and share energy usage data with a federal agency.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Energy usage data for emerging strategic sectors is currently scarce, largely due to the sectors’ nascence in the United States. Also, manufacturers may be concerned that energy usage data could reveal certain proprietary manufacturing processes. Such data is essential for a multitude of stakeholders, however. It would help utilities and energy regulators improve their ability to identify future energy requirements and infrastructure needs, especially as the regulators strive to ensure the reliability, affordability, and accessibility of energy against the fast-evolving investment and manufacturing landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In particular, a greater amount of quality data could help reduce the risk of overbuilding or underbuilding. The risk of stranded assets is a major concern for utilities and regulators, as it could incur significant costs to ratepayers. Yet, the risk of underbuilding energy infrastructure has a consequence, too. Failing to meet the energy demand could stymie industrial redevelopment of a state or the country. Ultimately, collecting and sharing more energy data — qualitatively and quantitatively — is also in the interest of strategic manufacturers as a better understanding of energy usage and estimating future needs can help regulators and utilities plan better, thereby cultivating a policy environment that enables such manufacturing activities. Industry associations in leading strategic manufacturing sectors are well positioned to take the lead in collecting and sharing energy usage data with the public, potentially through a federal agency such as the U.S. Department of Commerce or the EIA, as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Accelerate the reduction of emissions intensity from manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Manufacturing is intensive in both energy usage and GHG emissions. Electrifying as much of the manufacturing processes as possible while facilitating low-carbon fuel use could help reduce manufacturing emissions. For example, in EV battery cell manufacturing, the process of drying electrodes is a leading source of non-electricity-related emissions. Several technologies, including near-infrared drying and laser drying, are under development to help reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions in this process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Emissions reductions in manufacturing associated materials, such as steel and aluminum, are also crucial. Areas for proactive consideration include greater use of lower-emitting electric arc furnaces over blast furnaces and complementing natural gas use with hydrogen use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage CCS readiness at new gas power plants.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;CCS is likely the best path for emissions reductions from new gas plants, but it is not ready to meet growing demand today. Utilities and developers could prepare for the deployment of CCS in the future to create option value for all stakeholders and opportunities for natural gas to continue to provide baseload power at decreasing emissions intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Active planning and forward engineering studies at the project development stage can encourage CCS readiness, even when CCS will not be immediately deployed. By considering future retrofit, developers could assess the costs of facilities and site design for accommodating flue gas treatment, solvent regeneration, CO2 compression, and additional power and water requirements. Avoiding designs and facility layouts that would make future retrofit prohibitively expensive should become an industry standard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Encourage infrastructure permitting reform.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The importance of enabling infrastructure is one of the key considerations that was underscored throughout the stakeholder interviews. Infrastructure under consideration ranges from natural gas pipelines to electric power grids.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The federal processes for infrastructure permitting merit modernization that will enhance efficiency and reduce uncertainty while protecting the environment and local communities. Permitting reform could help alleviate the misalignment of the pace of decisionmaking that confronts manufacturers, utilities, and regulators. Having infrastructure in place where and when needed is crucial if government support and business investments are to catalyze reindustrialization that strengthens U.S. leadership in strategic industries and manufacturing competitiveness in the global market, where carbon-intensity is under increased scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, on the eve of then U.S. House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at CSIS conducted a formal survey of Taiwanese companies’ views and activity related to the international geostrategic environment. What most stood out was the high percentage of firms that already had begun to move some of their business from Mainland China or were considering doing so. A smaller, yet surprising number also reported either already moving or considering moving some of their business from Taiwan. These levels of reported movement of operations far outstripped such activity by their American, European, and Japanese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, in part due to two summit meetings between the leaders of the United States and China and the launching of over a dozen dialogues, geostrategic tensions have modestly tempered. In that context the Trustee Chair conducted a second survey of Taiwanese firms in November 2023 to assess how companies’ views and behavior may have shifted during the intervening period. The new survey was slightly modified to take into consideration changing circumstances, and the sample size was increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching conclusion from the latest survey is that although worries about the risks of doing business with China remain high, Taiwanese companies are engaging in a variety of diversification strategies rather than decoupling from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies’ worries about the geostrategic environment have receded somewhat, but they still favor a variety of coping strategies, including expanding involvement in regional trade arrangements, broadening commercial ties with the United States, expanding research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and nurturing a talented workforce to protect Taiwan’s technology advantage, and shifting some of their operations from China and Taiwan. Although the total proportion of firms considering or actually moving some of their business from China and Taiwan fell slightly, the proportion reporting they have already moved some operations rose significantly (from 25.7 percent to 34.3 percent from China, and from 13.0 percent to 17.9 percent from Taiwan). Companies report that Southeast Asia is still their number one destination, but interest in South Asia has risen dramatically. Companies are motivated to move from China for a variety of reasons, including high labor costs, fears of supply chain disruptions, changing investment policies, and worries about the possibility of war. Industries vary significantly in their interest in moving, which may be affected by the extent of their investment and the purpose of their existing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the proportion of firms moving remains high, they are moving as part of a variety of diversification strategies, not outright abandoning China altogether. China is still seen as an important trading partner; Taiwanese businesses are still not convinced India and Southeast Asia are sufficient substitutes; and companies are only moving a portion of their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results have important implications for policymakers in Washington, Beijing, Taipei and elsewhere. In the face of similar risks faced by Taiwanese industry, the U.S. government has launched a range of initiatives to address a list of economic security concerns, including dual-use technologies, supply chain resilience, economic coercion, and human rights abuses. If Washington’s approach becomes overly focused on imposing restrictions and shifts from a goal of managing risks to decoupling, it could very well find itself out of step with Taiwan, and most likely with other like-minded partners as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Beijing has taken a variety of steps over the past two years to address the concerns of companies and investors, including from Taiwan, it has simultaneously increased military pressure against Taiwan, carried out an investigation into Taiwan’s potential violation of ECFA, and imposed a variety of tailored restrictions. At a minimum, these steps send a mixed signal to Taiwanese businesses and propel them to explore alternative opportunities. Beijing will need to adjust its policies if it wants to achieve progress on both political issues and economic ties. For Taipei, the survey results suggest that policy steps to radically expand restrictions against Mainland China would not be welcomed by local industry, which instead still sees China as an important location for production and a large market. The continued anxiety about a possible war and supply chain disruptions means Taipei still must work to reassure local industry about the island’s commercial environment and economic future. Strengthening business confidence is central to maintaining the island’s economic vibrancy and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwanese-industry&quot;&gt;Taiwanese Industry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;a-potential-canary-in-the-mine&quot;&gt;A Potential Canary in the Mine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views and actions of Taiwanese companies provide invaluable insights into both cross-strait relations and trends in the geoeconomic environment. Firms from Taiwan are deeply embedded in supply chains that traverse the West, the People’s Republic of China, and the Global South, operating along the most complex geostrategic fault lines in the world. Moreover, Taiwanese industry may be the “canary in the mine,” with its views and conduct providing a preview of how global industry may behave when faced with competing forces to either shift business away from China or stay put. On one hand, the growth of restrictive trade and investment policies, the rising possibility of military conflict, climate change, increasing labor costs, pandemic restrictions, and other risks have created pressures for firms to move from China to other locales. On the other hand, China’s large domestic market, its sophisticated infrastructure and manufacturing value chain, and its growing innovation ecosystem act as incentives for firms to remain there or even expand their footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multinational companies and financial institutions trying to assess their options, as well as policymakers attempting to evaluate the efficacy of their economic policies, will gain a deeper understanding of this landscape by examining the views and behavior of Taiwanese industry. Although trade and investment data and individual case studies are useful gauges, surveys provide an intermediate bridging tool, as they allow for the assessment of a large number of firms’ subjective evaluations of their circumstances, their actual behavior, and the factors shaping their future choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, on the eve of then U.S. House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at CSIS conducted a formal survey of Taiwanese companies’ views and activity related to the international geostrategic environment. As a group, the polled companies believed that Taiwan was overdependent on China, and they were worried about a possible conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the consequences of China’s zero-Covid policies, and other risks. Many of those polled advocated for expanding Taiwan’s economic ties with the United States, becoming more involved in regional arrangements, and strengthening the island’s technological edge through greater research and development (R&amp;amp;D) and investments in human talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what most stood out was the high percentage of firms that already had begun to move some of their business from China (25.7 percent) or were considering doing so (33.2 percent). A smaller, yet surprising number also reported already moving some of their business from Taiwan (13.0 percent) or were considering doing so (20.8 percent). At the time, roughly two-thirds of those moving from either locale were shifting some of their operations to Southeast Asia. These levels of reported movement of operations far outstripped such activity by their American, European, and Japanese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then the geostrategic environment has continued to evolve. In early 2023, China ended its zero-Covid policies and reopened to international travel. Around the same time, the United States and China took a range of steps to stabilize their relationship, including leadership summits in October 2022 and November 2023 and the launch of over a dozen bilateral dialogue mechanisms. In the process, the sense of imminent conflict in the Taiwan Strait receded, as the United States and China sought to reassure the other about their motivations and to clarify their red lines. It is in this somewhat less tense geostrategic context that the Trustee Chair conducted a second survey of Taiwanese firms in November 2023 to assess how companies’ views and behavior may have shifted during the intervening period. In addition to remeasuring their assessment of risks and coping strategies, a second survey could also evaluate whether steps by China to normalize inward and outward international travel and by Beijing and Washington to stabilize ties had any effect on firms’ intentions to move business operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new survey was slightly modified from the original. There were fewer questions about the Covid-19 pandemic. In their place, new questions were added to more directly understand why companies would potentially move from Mainland China and Taiwan, and if so, how much of their operations they were moving. The survey also placed greater attention on the relevance of companies’ industries to more fully capture variation in patterns of views and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Figure 1.1 shows, the average size and overall profitability levels of companies in the latest survey sample are similar to 2022, but firms in the new survey skew substantially younger. The proportion of firms with investment in China is slightly higher (61.6 percent compared to 60.8 percent), and the companies in the new survey depend somewhat more on the Mainland for their revenue than those polled in 2022. The 2023 survey has a somewhat higher percentage of firms in agriculture and industry but still has roughly 25 percent of firms in manufacturing, which is very similar to the island’s overall average. The size of the sample was increased intentionally (to 610 firms from 525) so that it would be more feasible to analyze how firms’ sectoral identity shapes their responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KG8WqNV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1.1: Comparison of 2022 and 2023 Survey Samples.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.csis.org/analysis/its-moving-time-taiwanese-business-responds-growing-us-china-tensions&quot;&gt;Scott Kennedy, It’s Moving Time: Taiwanese Business Responds to Growing U.S.-China Tensions (Washington, DC: CSIS, October 4, 2022)&lt;/a&gt;; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference in this year’s sample is that the proportion of respondents in favor of Taiwan’s independence was much lower, 13.9 percent compared to 23.2 percent. The general population’s support for independence did drop over the same period, with 3.8 percent in favor of immediate independence and 21.5 percent in favor of maintaining the status quo for the moment but eventually moving toward independence, but was still higher than this sample. In the 2022 survey, pro-independence respondents were more likely to favor moving their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the timing of this new survey — coming after a general stabilization in U.S.-China ties — and the skewing of the sample in a pro-unification direction would, all else being equal, suggest a lower proportion of companies would be moving their operations, whether from Mainland China or Taiwan. As will be explained below, the actual results indicate that a high proportion of Taiwanese companies are still moving. That said, it appears that the vast majority are engaged in one form or another of diversifying rather than fully decoupling their business from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next chapter of this report presents the key findings of the survey with regard to how Taiwanese companies evaluate the various geostrategic risks they face and how best to respond, both in terms of government policies as well as their own behavior. The third chapter delves further into Taiwanese firms’ decision to move operations from the Mainland and explores why they are more prone to move than their counterparts from elsewhere. The final chapter evaluates the policy implications for the various actors with a stake in these geopolitical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;evolving-risks-and-responses&quot;&gt;Evolving Risks and Responses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching conclusion from the latest survey is that although worries about the risks of doing business with China have modestly receded — in part due to the thaw in U.S.-China relations and the end of zero-Covid — anxieties remain high. As a result, companies still favor a variety of coping strategies, with an even higher proportion than in 2022 having already started to move some of their business out of Mainland China and Taiwan. As in the 2022 edition, the full survey and results are included in the appendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Anxieties about China and international affairs remain high but have attenuated in a few ways, reflecting slightly less alarmist expectations about the likelihood of a U.S.-China military confrontation and a subtle shift in views regarding China’s Covid-19 policies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable change is a drop in the proportion of those expecting a U.S.-China military conflict in the next five years, falling over 10 percentage points, from 38.7 percent to 28.2 percent (see Figure 2.1). At the same time, the proportion believing Taiwan’s semiconductor industry serves as a disincentive to Beijing to attack or as an incentive to the United States to come to Taiwan’s aid both fell somewhat, to slightly under half of those polled. Those who believe China’s zero-Covid policies had a negative impact on their business did not change — 45.7 percent in 2022 and 45.5 percent in 2023 — but the proportion who said zero-Covid had either a somewhat positive or very positive effect on their business rose from 15.0 percent to 24.3 percent, perhaps reflecting a reevaluation once the tensions of the moment had passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Taiwanese companies seek to reduce dependence on China and expand cooperation with others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these continuing worries, the proportion of polled companies that believe Taiwan should reduce its dependence on China is still high. But the overall proportion that agree with this statement — either strongly or somewhat — fell almost 10 percentage points, from 76.3 percent to 66.9 percent (see Figure 2.2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GKliDmE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.2: Taiwan Should Reduce Its Dependence on China.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first approach to reducing dependence is to expand involvement in regional trade arrangements. As Figure 2.3 shows, the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), which regulates cross-strait commercial relations, is still regarded as the most important regional agreement for Taiwan; however, support for this view dropped substantially, to just over 21 percent. Evaluations of other major East Asia arrangements — the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional and Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) — are also still among the top tier but fell as well. Rising in the assessment are new arrangements such as the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA), Taiwan’s own New Southbound Policy, and the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). DEPA was launched in 2020 and as of May 2024 had four members: Chile, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea. Taiwan’s interest ostensibly originates from the arrangement’s focus on issues central to the island’s economy and from the fact that efforts by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reach a new pact on digital trade have faltered. Interest in the New Southbound Policy, geared toward expanding ties with Southeast Asia, India, Australia, and New Zealand, also modestly rose. Finally, recognition of IPEF rose even though the prospects for Taiwan to formally join have been very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rWyrRc7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.3: Preferred Regional Arrangements.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second component is to expand commercial ties with the United States. Although the United States and Taiwan recently successfully negotiated the first part of the Initiative on 21st-Century Trade, whose components mirror those in IPEF, Figure 2.4 shows that Taiwanese firms’ primary interest is still in three other arrangements. Leading the way is a formal bilateral trade agreement, but interest in that dropped somewhat (especially when ranked among the top three), likely because prospects for such a deal have remained low. Similarly strong support exists for two arrangements that have been in operation for some time, the Technology Trade and Investment Collaborative Framework and the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for a bilateral double-taxation agreement with the United States still does not rank as highly as other arrangements but did rise from 7.8 percent to 14.3 percent as the top option of respondents and increased to be among the top three, from 26.1 percent to 35.4 percent of respondents. Moreover, when specifically queried about a double-taxation agreement, a full 70 percent consider it important, with almost a quarter describing it as “extremely important” (23.0 percent), “fairly important” (24.9 percent), or “important” (22.1 percent). Only 7.4 percent said the agreement is “completely unimportant.” The Biden administration, Congress, and Taipei have made progress on creating parallel double-taxation measures, but final adoption, as of September 2024, is still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Consensus solidified over the importance of offensive technology policies to maintain the island’s technological advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original 2022 survey, Taiwanese companies reported that the most important steps needed to protect Taiwan’s technology advantage were expanding R&amp;amp;D and nurturing a talented workforce. These “offensive” steps drew more support than “defensive” ones such as rigid export controls and investment restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new survey, these views were further strengthened. When asked how Taiwan should maintain its technological edge on China, 37.9 percent of respondents said that R&amp;amp;D in Taiwan should be expanded, compared to 35.4 percent in 2022 (see Figure 2.5). Jumping up to second, with 14.9 percent support, is expanding the number of university undergraduate and graduate students in science and technology (S&amp;amp;T). By contrast, support dropped for every kind of “defensive” policy meant to limit China’s access to technology — such as export controls on dual-use technology, inward investment restrictions, outward investment restrictions, and limits on Taiwanese working in Mainland Chinese high-tech companies — with each attracting just above 10 percent support. This sentiment is consistent with the respondents’ analysis, discussed further below, that one of the main constraints on their firms’ competitiveness is insufficient talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Tum4OZE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.5: How Should Taiwan Keep Its Technological Edge?&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. More Taiwanese companies are following through on their plans to move some operations from Mainland China and Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most surprising finding from the 2022 survey was the high percentage of companies that were considering moving or were actually starting to move some of their business from both Mainland China (58.9 percent) and Taiwan (33.8 percent). Despite the tempering of U.S.-China tensions and less alarmist worries about war, companies in the latest survey still report that they are considering or already moving, from both China (57.4 percent) and Taiwan (37.6 percent), as Figure 2.6 shows. The biggest shift is from thought to action, with a jump in actual moving from China (from 25.7 percent to 34.3 percent) and Taiwan (from 13.0 percent to 17.9 percent), indicating that the original consideration of moving was more than baseless speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a jump in those already moving, there was also a change in the pattern of destinations. In the original survey, over 63 percent of companies moving from China and 67.8 percent of companies moving from Taiwan were going to Southeast Asia, far more than any other location (see Figure 2.7). By contrast, by late 2023, companies reported that Southeast Asia was still their number one destination from China (50.9 percent) and Taiwan (48.9 percent), but by a smaller margin than before. For those moving from China, the second most common destination was, as in 2022, Taiwan. However, the third most common destination, and biggest change from 2022, was South and Central Asia, by which respondents most likely meant India. There was still interest in moving to Northeast Asia (South Korea and Japan), while North America, and Australia and New Zealand, still garnered low levels of interest. For those moving from Taiwan, there was a substantial jump in those moving to the Mainland, while South and Central Asia moved up to attract as much interest as Northeast Asia. And like those moving from Mainland China, there was still only limited interest in North America and in Australia and New Zealand. This suggests that large individual investments, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) fab in Phoenix, Arizona, are not being followed by a wave of other Taiwanese companies. By contrast, momentum to move to India has gained substantial steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.7: A Shifting Pattern of Destinations.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide greater insight, the new edition of the survey also asked companies to indicate the proportion of their operations that they are considering or actually moving from the Mainland and Taiwan. As Figure 2.8 shows, the plurality (39.4 percent) of those in Mainland China are moving 26–50 percent of their business, and just over 30 percent of companies are moving 11–25 percent. Only 7.9 percent are moving the vast majority of their business (over 75 percent) out of China. For those leaving Taiwan, the data skews somewhat lower, with the plurality (36.7 percent) moving 11–25 percent, and 31 percent moving 26–50 percent. These are not insignificant portions of their business, but very few are leaving either locale outright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BCz2YO1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.8: Shifting, Not Leaving: Proportion of Investment Being Moved from Mainland China and Taiwan to Elsewhere.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some important insights to be gained by looking at the responses of different industries (see Figure 2.9). First, industries vary substantially in the share of firms with investment in China that are considering or actually moving. In five sectors (public administration, real estate, finance and insurance, human health and social work, and manufacturing), over two-thirds of firms are moving or considering doing so. In another 10 sectors, it is 50–60 percent of firms, and in four sectors it is less than 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complete explanation for the variation across sectors awaits more refined statistical analysis, but there are a couple of findings that stand out at first glance. Sectors with firms that report China’s market is a relatively higher share of their overall revenue appear to move somewhat more of their operations than those less dependent on China. Additionally, in sectors where a higher proportion of firms report moving, they tend to be moving a slightly lower proportion of their business compared to sectors where a lower share of firms are moving. Put another way, in some sectors a high share of firms are moving, but they are moving less of their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an important contrast in terms of destinations. Over half (52.8 percent) of firms in manufacturing are moving to Southeast Asia, whereas only 22.6 percent in that sector were returning to Taiwan. Other likely movers to Southeast Asia were in health and social work and hotel and food services, all services that could support the people who are in manufacturing firms. The most likely sectors to return to Taiwan were public administration, finance and insurance, and hotel and food services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in around 40 percent of sectors, firms most commonly were moving a moderate proportion of their operations (26–50 percent). In five sectors, firms were mainly moving 11–25 percent of their operations. And in another five industries, the proportion of operations that firms reported moving was widely distributed, with no one dominant pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yPuUH8f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.9: Industry Patterns of Moving from China.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these broader patterns of shifting investment decisions, there are some distinctive regional patterns that suggest Taiwanese companies are pursuing a diversity of approaches. The largest plurality of companies are not moving at all, either from the Mainland or Taiwan. Of those that are moving, three groups are significant. The first is the group of 22 companies that are moving from China and Taiwan and going only to Southeast Asia. The second group is composed of 25 firms that are moving from both China and Taiwan to at least three other destinations. The final group is made up of 30 firms reporting that they are simultaneously moving only from Mainland China to Taiwan and from Taiwan to Mainland China. The “Southeast Asia movers” are focused on shifting production to a single locale; the “diversifiers” appear to be spreading risk across a range of regions; and the “cross-strait movers” appear to be reorganizing their production within the company, with a clearer delineation of their “China for China” activities in the PRC and their other activities directed for Taiwan and the rest of the world back on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broader point is that although most companies are moving or planning to move their business, there is substantial variation in where they are moving to and how much of their operations they are moving. Understanding these patterns is aided by analyzing the reasons why companies are moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-taiwanese-companies-are-moving&quot;&gt;Why Taiwanese Companies Are Moving&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not only surprising that such a high percentage of Taiwanese firms are moving from Mainland China and Taiwan despite the stabilization of U.S.-China relations, but that the inclination for Taiwanese firms to move is so much higher than for their counterparts from the United States, Europe, and Japan (see Figure 3.1). Whereas over 57 percent of Taiwanese companies are considering or already moving, just under a quarter of U.S. firms in China are, and only around 10 percent of European and Japanese firms report that they are moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no direct evidence to explain why Taiwanese companies have a stronger propensity to move than their American, European, and Japanese counterparts. But we can evaluate what differentiates the Taiwanese firms that choose to move from those that do not, and then more closely analyze the various reasons for moving. This may then help provide insights across different investors in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to distinguish movers and non-movers is to compare their answers to other questions in the survey. These patterns are not necessarily statistically significant, because the potential effect of other factors is not simultaneously accounted for, but such “crosstabs” are nevertheless suggestive. The first survey from 2022 found that several factors — companies’ backgrounds, the Covid-19 pandemic, firms’ evaluation of the international economic situation, the respondents’ political leanings, and their views about security — were related to how likely they were to have considered or actually begun to move some of their business from China and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the 2022 results, companies in manufacturing are more likely to have already moved than to either be just considering moving or have no plans to move (see Figure 3.2). A company’s current profitability does not appear to shape their relocation decisions. Unlike in 2022, however, older companies are now more likely to leave rather than younger firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JY8qUcW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at economic ties, while revenue reliance on China did not seem to matter in 2022, it does in the latest survey. Companies that depend more on China for their profits are less likely to move than those that are less dependent. A total of 69.2 percent of those who did not move generated more than 25 percent of their profits from China, while only 51.7 percent of those considering moving and 36.4 percent of those who have not moved depend on China for a quarter or more of their profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, those who already started moving strongly believe that the island should reduce its dependence on Mainland China. In short, while exposure to China may be synonymous with higher opportunity costs, fears of overdependence still shape relocation decisions. Finally, those who believe that Southeast Asia and India are sufficient substitutes for China were, as in 2022, more likely to have already started moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of political and security views did not change much between the two surveys. In 2023, 21.3 percent of those who moved away supported Taiwan’s independence, compared to 9.5 percent who were considering moving and 2.8 percent who were not moving at all. Moreover, companies that left were less concerned about China’s military action given Taiwan’s strength in semiconductors and were most likely to believe that the United States and others would provide military support in the event of a contingency for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/O5ngcHF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.2: Distinguishing between Movers and Non-movers from Mainland China.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the focus turns to reasons for moving from or staying in Taiwan, because the pandemic subsided in 2022, the 2023 survey did not ask how Covid-19 cases affected business or whether respondents were satisfied with Taiwan’s Covid-19 policies. Instead, as Figure 3.3 shows, basic company characteristics and views about the semiconductor industry mattered. Companies that are older, larger, and in manufacturing showed a greater propensity for moving. Unlike in the 2022 survey, the belief that Southeast Asia and India are sufficient substitutes for both Taiwan exports and investments with Mainland China now appears positively correlated with the decision to move from Taiwan. In addition, companies that believe Beijing is less likely to take military action because of Taiwan’s strong semiconductor industry were also more inclined to move. Respondents’ views about Taiwan independence, their companies’ relative dependence on China for revenue, and the likelihood of war in the next five years did not seem to differentiate movers and non-movers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5hBDgxc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.3: Distinguishing between Movers and Non-movers from Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more recent survey, from late 2023, went one step further and directly asked only those companies that are moving or considering moving to choose the top three reasons from a long list of reasons why. Although not posed to those who did not move at all, this approach lets firms themselves clearly explain their decision to move as opposed to looking for patterns between separate questions. As Figure 3.4 shows, this approach yields some similarities but also reveals some differences from the crosstabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jMbUqgB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.4: Why Companies Are Moving from China and Taiwan.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four of the top five reasons concern China’s business environment, including high labor costs, the possibility of supply chain disruptions, changing investment policies, and lack of policy transparency. Although Taiwanese firms are worried about the possibility of war, that ranked fourth among the various factors affecting their decision. At the other end of the spectrum, issues that were much less important included a general desire to diversify production or reduce ties with China, the need to follow others in the same supply chain, China’s Covid-19 policies, and reputational risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons firms gave for moving some business from Taiwan shared similarities with those moving from China but also revealed some differences. As with China, the top issue is the rising cost of labor. Other issues related to Taiwan’s business environment were also cited, such as the investment environment and the possibility of supply chain disruptions. By contrast, the fear of war vaulted to second place, cited by 37.1 percent of respondents as a reason to move from the island. At the other end of the spectrum, general reasons to diversify or follow other firms in one’s supply chain were cited much less often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, Taiwanese firms seriously consider moving from either China or Taiwan when they believe it will make a tangible difference to their business and substantially reduce their risks, and not because of vague worries and fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diversifying-not-decoupling&quot;&gt;Diversifying, Not Decoupling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data reflect a high degree of anxiety among Taiwanese firms, and a substantial proportion are moving some of their operations from China and Taiwan as a result. That said, it does not appear that these adjustments add up to a plan to decouple from China by entirely rerouting their supply chains, or a complete loss of interest in the Mainland Chinese market. Instead, several signs point to these changes adding up to an effort to diversify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked how important various countries and regions are as economic partners for Taiwan, although the United States was most often identified as “extremely important” in both the 2022 and 2023 surveys, China’s position rose significantly in 2023. The proportion of those identifying China as an extremely important trading partner for Taiwan rose from 28.4 percent to 35.6 percent, placing it ahead of Japan, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Europe (see Figure 4.1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, as noted earlier in Figure 2.3, Taiwanese businesses still see the ECFA deal with China as the single most important agreement for expanding their international business opportunities. And in 2023, the ECFA received almost as many mentions among the top three as the CPTPP and the RCEP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, a belief that India and Southeast Asia could collectively be sufficient substitutes for trade and investment ties with China is still high, but has fallen, with those answering “strongly agree” falling from 20.8 percent to 17.4 percent and those answering “somewhat agree” dropping from 44.0 percent to 39.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UteTeHS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4.1: Who Are Taiwan’s Important Trading Partners?&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Kennedy, It’s Moving Time; and appendix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, the ways in which the firms are moving also do not point to decoupling as the primary motivation. As noted above, Taiwanese companies that are moving or considering moving are only shifting a portion of their operations from China, most often somewhere between a quarter and a half, with very few moving more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, as previously mentioned, those moving display a range of regional patterns, each shaped by a distinctive rationale. Some firms are simultaneously moving some operations from China to Taiwan and from Taiwan to China, what the authors call “cross-strait reorganizers.” These firms appear to be relocating their business for China’s market entirely in China and their business for the rest of the world in Taiwan. Every company in this group believes that U.S.-China cooperation is in their interests. This group also appears more confident that Taiwan’s semiconductor industry would act as a “silicon shield” to deter Beijing from an attack but should there be a conflict, the United States would come to Taiwan’s defense. Those moving to multiple locations (“diversifiers”) also seem to be reshuffling their operations into a “China for China” strategy and “elsewhere for the world.” It is the “Southeast Asia movers” (those moving from China and Taiwan only to Southeast Asia) who are most concerned about the business environment on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and are adjusting accordingly, with companies in this group moving a higher proportion of their operations in China and Taiwan than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, actual cross-strait trade and investment is still quite high. There’s been a reduction in China’s dominance as a destination for outbound investment but very little change in the direction of trade, with China still being the destination for a quarter of Taiwan’s exports (see Figure 4.2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these various pieces of evidence point to diversification but not abandonment of China as a location for production or as a market. Even with all of these changes, China is still an extremely important economic counterpart for Taiwan, substantially higher than the United States and far higher than Europe. There is little indication this reality will fundamentally change in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications&quot;&gt;Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese industry’s anxieties about the geostrategic environment tempered slightly between mid-2022 and late 2023, yet there are still concerns about U.S.-China tensions, the possibility of war, and China’s business environment. As a result, Taiwanese companies advocate reducing dependence on China and expanding business ties with others in the region and beyond. As in 2022, Taiwanese companies are still moving some of their operations out of China and Taiwan, and they are doing so at a greater level than their counterparts from other countries. That said, they appear to be motivated by a desire to hedge their risks and diversify their regional and global production footprint, not outright decouple from China. Firms from the island still see China as a key economic partner and generally favor advancing their own capabilities instead of restricting ties as a method to handle the various security and competitive risks from across the Taiwan Strait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings have important implications for policymakers in Washington, Beijing, Taipei, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of similar risks, the U.S. government has launched a range of initiatives to address a list of economic security concerns, including dual-use technologies, supply chain resilience, economic coercion, and human rights abuses. At the same time, U.S. industry has slowed new investment into China, while adding incremental capacity in other locales. The data from these surveys suggest that although Taiwanese firms are moving at a higher rate, they broadly recognize that interdependence with China is impossible to fully eliminate, and that while “defensive” measures are necessary, so too are “offensive” steps to advance their own competitiveness. If Washington’s approach becomes overly focused on imposing restrictions and shifts from a goal of managing risks to decoupling, it could very well find itself out of step with Taiwan, and most likely with other like-minded partners as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications for Beijing are even more challenging. Although the Mainland’s zero-Covid policies are no longer a concern, Taiwanese firms still lack sufficient confidence in China’s business environment and are nervous about geostrategic tensions. Beijing has taken a variety of steps over the past two years to address the concerns of companies and investors, including from Taiwan. As a result of cross-strait political tensions, however, Beijing has increased military pressure against Taiwan, while also carrying out an investigation into Taiwan’s potential violation of ECFA and imposing a variety of tailored restrictions. These steps at a minimum send a mixed signal to Taiwanese businesses and propel them to explore alternative opportunities. Beijing will need to adjust its policies if it wants to achieve progress on both political issues and economic ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Taipei, the survey results suggest that policy steps to radically expand restrictions would not be welcomed by local industry, which instead still sees China as an important location for production and a large market. Although the New Southbound Policy has borne some fruit in encouraging diversification of investment to Southeast Asia and India, further steps are needed to make these destinations more credible as long-term options for global business operations. Finally, the continued anxiety about a possible war and supply chain disruptions means Taipei still must work to reassure local industry about the island’s commercial environment and economic future. Strengthening their confidence is central to maintaining the island’s economic vibrancy and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan encountered problems with overreliance on Chinese mineral supply chains over a decade ago, long before it became a critical issue for other countries. Following a territorial dispute in 2010, China implemented an export ban on rare earth elements (REEs) that specifically targeted Japan. This ban only lasted two months, but encouraged Japan to change its approach for key mineral-dependent industries and supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s export controls on minerals needed for the green energy transition become more indiscriminate – exemplified by last year’s graphite restrictions – other countries can learn from Japan’s experience. Groups like the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP) have prioritised alternative producers and processors, but there is also value in stockpiling. This approach could be particularly effective because China’s relative economic weakness means that it is unlikely to be willing or able to sustain onerous or lengthy export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that, despite all its efforts, Japan still gets more than half its REEs from China and remains heavily reliant on Chinese processing for other raw materials. Urgent action is required to reduce concentration risks, but China will nonetheless remain an important part of mineral supply chains for the foreseeable future. It should also be underlined that China is set to play a leading role in attempts to push forward recycling and technologies that reduce material reliance. Ongoing engagement with China is therefore imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-lessons&quot;&gt;Key Lessons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article sets out to profile four of Japan’s high-level responses to the REE export ban in 2010. Some of these responses, particularly stockpiling and diversification, could be mimicked easily by other countries. Importantly, these strategies are even more effective when adopted by alliances like the MSP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Investing in alternative producers and processors:&lt;/strong&gt; Japanese companies and investors have been instrumental in the emergence of Lynas, an Australia-based REE producer and processor. Similarly, they have supported the emergence of Malaysia as a major processor of REEs. They have also encouraged allies like the US to promote domestic REE production, such as at the Mount Pass facility. This initiative has enjoyed government-level support, but at a local level met opposition to mining operations that are seen as dirty and destructive in the US and developed democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Urgent action is required to reduce concentration risks, but China will nonetheless remain an important part of mineral supply chains for the foreseeable future&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan empowered the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security to act as a one-stop shop that coordinates the country’s minerals strategy. This has been instrumental in its diversification success, which has helped to reduce the proportion of the world’s REE mining that takes place in China from 95% to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China still accounts for nearly 90% of REE processing, underlining the limitations of the strategy and the importance of a holistic approach to supply chain resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Stockpiling:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan immediately started to stockpile REEs in 2010/11, and its experience underlines the need for consideration and coordination: Japanese companies were in such a rush to stockpile REEs both during and after China’s embargo that they exacerbated a price bubble that lasted for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, stockpiling can offer a good way to manage price spikes and resource scarcity (e.g. in the oil and gas markets). China has demonstrated its own capacity to stockpile critical minerals while prices are low. More recently, several countries have started to stockpile graphite and other critical minerals following China’s controls. Examples include the US’s National Defense Stockpile of various metals and South Korea’s expanded critical mineral stockpile. The UK is considering a strategic stockpile, and France is set to conduct a stockpile of mineral resources located domestically and in its overseas territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stockpiling is most effective as a response to relatively short or limited trade disputes or supply chain disruptions. This is important because China’s economic fragility suggests that it may be unable to sustain trade disputes that have significant impacts on its core industries, including minerals and electric vehicles (EVs). So far, China’s controls on gallium and graphite have been closer to a skirmish than committed economic warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stockpiling would be more powerful still if groups like the MSP could work on shared stockpiles. This approach would also help to mitigate the risks to transition mineral supply chains outside China and/or those driven by external forces (such as climate impacts). It is therefore unfortunate that the EU appears to be walking back its plans to establish such stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Promoting technology alternatives that reduce material reliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan has attempted to develop technologies that use fewer REEs or alternative materials. It has also been more hesitant than the EU and US to increase reliance on Chinese supply chains for products like EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part for this reason, Japanese automakers have shown greater support than their counterparts for technologies like hydrogen. This has put them in a weak competitive position given the growing dominance of EVs and has left a gap for Chinese automakers to fill, particularly in servicing regional demand. Japan’s approach has therefore increased China’s control over EV supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this strategy would be more successful in collaboration with other countries. For example, replacing graphite with other anode materials (such as silicon, tin and lithium) or developing new battery technologies (such as solid state) will take time but is achievable in the next few years, particularly with concerted effort. But material substitution would take place faster if this concerted effort included China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Supporting recycling:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan has accelerated the development of technologies for recycling REEs and other key materials, but reuse is still very limited outside base metals like copper, nickel and steel. Recycling of REEs, for example, is unlikely to be commercialised until the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Engaging with China is just as important as reducing reliance on it, and the two approaches should not be mutually exclusive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other transition materials like lithium, cobalt and manganese face several significant barriers to recycling at scale, including technology shifts (such as in battery chemistry), price uncertainty for virgin material, lack of standardisation in battery design/construction processes, and lack of available feedstock at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, recycling can reduce reliance on China in the medium term (that is, post-2030) but not the short term. Again, China is currently leading the way with much of this technological development. Expanding recycling at the rate needed by global markets and standards will likely mean learning from China. This argues for greater engagement as well as concentration risk management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What Next&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concentration of transition mineral supply chains in China creates substantial risks for other economies and their green transitions. China can weaponise its control of these supply chains, but is unlikely to do so unprovoked. Engaging with China is therefore just as important as reducing reliance on it, and the two approaches should not be mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s experience can help other countries to get the balance right, but as ever, the devil is in the detail. Stockpiling is a particularly effective response given the nature of the risk posed by China’s dominance and in the context of its weak economy. As with other approaches, stockpiling is more effective when countries collaborate. But this should be framed to manage supply chain risks in general, rather than as a way of combatting Chinese control of transition minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement of yet another strategic review – the third in just four years – presents an opportunity for the new government to outline a roadmap for securing the UK’s innovation ecosystem, a crucial backbone of its economic and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous strategic reviews outlined the UK government’s goal of becoming a technology superpower. Any advances in key areas of emerging and deep technology will undoubtedly require cultivating a thriving innovation ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entails promoting research in a higher education sector that is experiencing profound financial challenges, supporting the commercialisation of research, and developing a more informed approach to industrial policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is already easier said than done. However, in addition to these policy challenges, the UK also faces determined adversaries that are seeking to steal its intellectual property and otherwise disrupt its innovation ecosystem. Ensuring the security of the ecosystem and its resilience against these threats without stifling innovation is an epochal challenge for the UK government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-of-innovation-under-threat&quot;&gt;Security of Innovation Under Threat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological innovation is a key strategic battleground between great powers. Accordingly, organisations that are engaged in technological innovation will be targeted by well-resourced, persistent threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic espionage is not a novel phenomenon. However, Western governments are increasingly open in their assessment of the scale and breadth of China’s theft of innovative technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Organisations that have an IT-focused information security function may not have organisational policies and processes to address threats to physical, supply chain, personal and personnel security&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research institutions, university spinouts, startups and larger enterprises are all at risk. Greater public awareness of this issue has also increased the pressure on companies to address the threat. However, efforts to strengthen the security of some organisations have run into practical and cultural challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of technologies and companies considered relevant to national security, and therefore falling under the scope of UK government efforts to counter threats, is expanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many organisations innovating in emerging technologies, which are often small startups and spinouts, are unfamiliar with security and do not have well-established connections with the security services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat extends beyond the comparatively familiar domain of cyber security. Organisations that have an IT-focused information security function may not have organisational policies and processes to address threats to physical, supply chain, personal and personnel security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also cultural challenges in introducing security controls in some institutions, not to mention opposition to working with government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uk-government-response&quot;&gt;The UK Government Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Security and Investment Act (NSIA) was enacted in the UK in 2021. The act provides the UK government with enhanced powers to scrutinise and intervene in business transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, over 17 sensitive areas of the economy that are relevant to national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSIA is notable for the breadth of its coverage, permitting scrutiny of transactions in catch-all categories such as communications, defence and transport. Other categories cover entire fields of research and development, such as AI, quantum technologies and synthetic biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal evidence suggests that the startup ecosystem has not always appreciated the NSIA. There remains uncertainty among businesses over the scope and applicability of the act, likely leading to unnecessary delay in mergers and acquisitions. The impression that emerges is that both government and the private sector are finding their way at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the NSIA approval process is set out in a legally binding decision called a final order. In addition to prohibiting a proposed deal, or unwinding one that has taken place, these final orders can also impose conditions on the parties involved, pending the acceptance of which the deal can go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysing these final orders shows that, rather than blocking deals entirely, the government is increasingly using final orders to mandate changes in companies’ approach to security. These changes emphasise a holistic approach to protective security, with a focus on security governance, personnel security and vetting, and assurance functions. This suggests a direction of travel in terms of broader requirements for protective security for companies working in sensitive areas of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TYYcmwW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ NSIA Final Order Actions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government offers some support to industry through the National Protective Security Authority (NPSA), which focuses on economic security and the protection of science, technology and research. The NPSA runs a campaign called “Secure Innovation” that offers guidance to organisations operating in this space. An online survey allows organisations to assess their need for protective security, and the NPSA has also launched a pilot programme with UK Research and Innovation which covers some of the costs for companies seeking protective security assessments from a list of approved providers. This is a positive move towards a more collaborative approach to mitigating risks in this area, but still leaves the onus on companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future-of-innovation-security&quot;&gt;The Future of Innovation Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As more – and more diverse – organisations are asked to introduce security controls to protect their work, the ability of the UK government to provide guidance and support will be increasingly strained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The challenge is to promote the adoption of security controls in a way that does not stifle innovation or undermine the commercial viability of companies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are pockets of expertise and capability across the private sector and within public institutions such as universities, think tanks and research institutes. Nonetheless, given the UK government’s limited capacity to directly support companies at risk, there is a pressing need for the development of collective responses within industry. This will involve bringing together companies that address different aspects of security, such as cyber security and physical security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also challenges around security awareness and culture, and around the incentives of different actors. Companies operating in this highly competitive space are unlikely to spend on security measures unless the costs of not doing so are immediate and unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broad statements from government about the criticality of science and technology to national security may resonate with some individuals, but are unlikely to drive organisational behaviour in companies that do not already have a more mature security function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing organisational behaviour around security will likely involve the promotion of forums for sharing information and best practices. It will also involve recognising that this is a diverse and heterogeneous space with existing pockets of expertise and collaboration. The government should focus on building and supporting a system of systems, rather than attempting to impose a single body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to promote the adoption of security controls in a way that does not stifle innovation or undermine the commercial viability of companies. As with the security of academic research, such efforts also need to find a balance between the necessity of international collaboration and the need to protect sovereign capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it may take more high-profile company failures resulting from adversary actions before this issue gains significant attention, prompting companies to seek best practices and benchmarks to justify security spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, it triggered an influx of material to Ukraine from Kyiv’s Western partners. This assistance enabled Ukraine to prevent Russia from toppling its government, but it also depleted Western stockpiles and pulled equipment out of service to be shipped to Ukraine. Replenishing these stockpiles with technologically updated material is not an easy task. Since the end of the Cold War, responding to governments’ demand levels, Western defence industries have shifted to just-in-time production models, reducing their output capacity. Meanwhile, many of the systems sent to Ukraine are legacy designs from the last century. Replacing them like-for-like would delay the necessary modernisation of Western forces and in many cases would not be feasible. As a result, industry and military planners face a dual challenge: they must decide how to meet immediate needs for restocking, while also enabling industry to develop new platforms that meet future battlefield requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the war in Ukraine also rekindled the value of defence industrial independence in defence procurement policy circles. For instance, Germany was unable to supply ammunition for the Gepard tank as Swiss neutrality laws prevented Rheinmetall’s factory in Switzerland from exporting arms to Ukraine. This situation drew further attention to the need for indigenous supplies of critical products that the Covid-19 pandemic had already emphasised. Geopolitical factors have also heightened this concern. Donald Trump made US support within NATO conditional on increased European defence spending. This made European leaders wary of relying on US supply chains and encouraged them to prioritise spending on their domestic defence industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uk-risks-being-the-odd-one-out-in-the-long-term&quot;&gt;UK Risks being the “Odd One Out” in the Long Term&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU has been pushing structured integration of its defence industrial base. The European Defence Fund (EDF) launched in 2021, and the European Defence Industrial Programme (EDIP) is under consultation in Brussels. The EDF endows research grants to consortiums of companies from at least three different EU member states, especially incentivising the inclusion of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Non-EU-based companies are excluded from the funding. Meanwhile, the annual work programmes are agreed across member states, necessitating requirement harmonisation that could make national European programmes more accessible to cross-EU industry. The EDIP will enact the EU’s defence industrial strategy that seeks to pool defence procurement with the aim that, by 2030, 40% of national defence procurement budgets go towards pan-European programmes. It also envisages that EU members will spend 50% of national procurement budgets within the EU. Thus, the two programmes aim to future-proof European industry by investing billions in research and development. This enables them to satisfy their European market through indigenous development and creates a level playing field with less national favouritism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The continental European market enjoys long-established links with UK industry and brings the benefit of working with the similar operational requirements of NATO’s eastern flank&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presents a strategic challenge to the UK defence industrial base, which is at risk of becoming the “odd one out” between the biggest Western defence markets – Europe and the US. The EDF and EDIP and their likely successors will develop a more consolidated industrial base exclusive of UK industry and a more coherent domestic market landscape. Meanwhile, the UK defence industry is deeply intertwined with the continent. Airbus, Leonardo, Thales, MBDA and RBSL are examples. Sharing intellectual property from EDF initiatives will be complicated and so will the UK side’s access to European tendering. This presents a challenge for the highly integrated UK-European defence industrial landscape. Earlier negotiations on access to the EDF and PESCO led to no conclusions other than on PESCO’s Military Mobility project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the UK experience of cooperating with US programmes to keep and develop industry skills has been lukewarm. It managed to maintain key aerospace competence in the country through its cooperation with the US on the F35 striker as a junior partner, but it received less attractive workshares in the programme. Indeed, its relatively competitive effectors industry faces the challenge of being excluded from the programme, as the closed software architecture of the platform prevents effective integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bi--and-minilateral-cooperation-should-complement-structured-cooperation&quot;&gt;Bi- and Minilateral Cooperation Should Complement Structured Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK government hopes to overcome this challenge through a series of “minilateral” collaborations on major projects, such as the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) and the US-Australian cooperation on nuclear submarines. The GCAP programme with Japan and Italy retains competency in airframe design and production and includes a dual software architecture allowing effector integration. This makes it more attractive for export markets with an existing effectors industry while boosting the participants’ own effectors industries’ exports to markets without one. Yet, the question remains to what extent these programmes can provide the UK defence industrial base with the necessary resources to not only maintain its current competencies but also develop its competitiveness. As the F35 has shown, the established links with the US bear the danger of being overpowered by the significant advantages of extensive resources and market potential that US industry enjoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continental European market enjoys long-established links with UK industry and brings the benefit of working with the similar operational requirements of NATO’s eastern flank. Yet, these links are at risk of being decoupled as the EU extensively funds research and, in the future, procurement from EU-based industry. Thus far, bilateral cooperation has been the UK’s preferred approach to remain connected with the continent. An example of this is the Lancaster House treaty with France, which served as a platform for deepening defence relations. The new Labour government seems eager to expand this approach, signing a joint declaration on “Enhanced Defence Cooperation” with Germany and envisioning a revised relationship with the EU. So, what opportunities lie ahead for the UK defence industrial base in such an expansion of ties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “low-hanging fruits” for UK-German cooperation are in the land domain sector. There is already an established legacy of successful cooperation with the M3 bridging capability, the modernisation of the Challenger 3 tanks as well as the UK’s embrace of Rheinmetall’s Boxer programme, encompassing various mechanised infantry variants and a 155mm howitzer on a Boxer basis. Thus, industry has already been intertwined in this sector, with the joint venture Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL) being the most visible example of many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Franco-German ambition of a joint future tracked main ground combat system (MGCS) has seemed beset by handwringing. Industry and politicians had been upset about the workshare on the combat air equivalent, FCAS. Yet, this spring, MGCS regained momentum as both countries agreed on an equal distribution of work across eight capability pillars and set up a joint venture to manage the project. The bad news is that the programme is currently closed for potential partners. However, this will likely be reconsidered at some point during the conceptual stage: Italy has expressed interest in the project, while pressing ahead with Leonardo and Rheinmetall’s strategic partnership to develop a main battle tank. To reduce European platform diversity, this project will eventually have to be merged with MGCS, and it could provide Italy with the necessary arguments to gain a satisfactory workshare for Leonardo. It also seems unlikely – especially in the crowded tracked armour market of the 2040s (when these concepts are planned to be introduced), with likely new competition from India and South Korea – that the Franco-German project can afford to ignore important Northeast European markets for much longer. Thus, the established UK-German cooperation in the land sector may provide a longer-term entry route into the MGCS and set the stage for a strategic partnership on land systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UK military capabilities will have to play a significant part in long-term planning for European defence, even with Brexit and EU ambitions in that area&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aerospace sector, meanwhile, the fruits hang a little higher. Here, the continental FCAS and GCAP are fully established, and a reconsideration of the programmes’ compositions other than to include major exporting partners, such as Saudi Arabia, seems unlikely. This is because of the implied costs of including further requirements, language barriers and the diplomatic costs implied in any structural shake-up of either programme. Future related programmes concerning effectors and uncrewed wingmen concepts may be an area for cooperation, especially considering the high levels of cross-border industry integration in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, bi- and minilateral defence cooperation initiatives lack the strategic security that UK industry needs to maintain and develop its design and manufacturing capabilities. The uncertainty caused by the Strategic Defence Review over some key programmes underlines this point. Broader research and development investments ensure this competitiveness. National research programmes are fiscally limited and may struggle to access the continental expertise they have previously enjoyed. Labour’s more relaxed stance on the UK’s relationship with the EU might be an opportunity: over the next five years, the European Commission will be looking to reconsidering its current defence procurement policy instruments, as the EDF’s funding and the EDIP end in 2027. The UK government should re-explore the benefits of having a Norway-like role as a non-EU participant, not only to secure funding for innovation but also to enable industry to build on its extensive relationships with continental partners and, therefore, maintain access to that market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geopolitical arguments for such a setup are strong. The European component of NATO must become less dependent on US capabilities as the long-term US commitment to the continent seems destined to fade independent of the short-term political outlook. UK military capabilities will have to play a significant part in long-term planning for European defence, even with Brexit and EU ambitions in that area. A UK attempt at access to EU structures may find some supporters within the Union: research on the priorities in the European programmes has shown a split between member states that prioritise NATO capability planning and those that prioritise national industrial concerns. With its thorough commitment to NATO and highly capable and Europe-oriented industry, a UK attempt at accessing European programmes may find partners in those European states that seek to adapt and augment NATO capabilities, rather than replicating them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;呂智恆主動撤保釋還柙候判 辯方指失社工資格、望法庭判「療癒式刑罰」&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;林景楠指參選是中計 索社服令報告官指不現實&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1ikNs2w.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（3日）續處理參選新東的呂智恆和林景楠求情。代表呂智恆的大律師陳世傑，指呂在案中角色次要，從無意圖推翻政權、只是企圖阻礙運作，屬「其他參加者」。陳又呈上呂親撰的求情信，呂從小志向成為社工，但因本案而失去社工資格。求情信亦提到，呂參加初選為由人民授權行使否決權，以非常無奈和間接的方式罷免特首，望當權者回應民意；他當時無知相信議員行使否決權是合法，現已明白想法錯誤，深感後悔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，接受違反《國安法》須判處阻嚇性刑罰，但本案阻嚇性效果已是眾所周知，眾被告心靈受創，「我們現在需要的，是法庭判處『療癒式刑罰（healing sentence）』」，令被告和社會可從創傷中復原。罪成45名被告全部求情完畢，法官表示會另行通知判刑日期。原獲保釋的呂智恆主動撤銷保釋，還柙候判，他今早並在 Facebook 發布與養母 Elsa 的合照，表示：「期待在遙遠的那天重聚，大家珍重。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋陳志全及范國威無到庭&quot;&gt;楊岳橋、陳志全及范國威無到庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已完成求情的楊岳橋、陳志全及范國威今無到庭，其餘6人分成三排就坐，由7名懲教人員看管。呂智恆穿米白色長袖裇衫，林景楠穿白裇衫、白口罩、深藍西裝外套。穿粉紅色裇衫、黑色西裝外套的林卓廷微笑向旁聽席揮手，穿軍綠色上衣的鄒家成，與女友以手勢交流。劉頴匡穿深藍色西裝和打深藍領帶，何桂藍綁短馬尾、穿白背心，坐下後與劉及鄒談天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方呂角色次要因對法律無知犯案-屬其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：呂角色次要、因對法律無知犯案 屬「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表呂智恆的大律師陳世傑認為，呂屬刑期3年以下的「其他參加者」，指他在案中沒有主要角色，只是支援性質、頗為次要，對整個謀劃沒有任何重要或實質的貢獻。陳接納，呂競選時曾批評制度，但那是他為爭取選民支持而說的話。若法庭拒納，辯方亦望考慮呂為「積極參加者」較低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又接納，呂同意無差別否決預算案的協議，但強調他只是企圖「阻撓」議會運作，從未企圖「推翻」政權；而否決預算案本身沒有違法，呂因對法律無知、真誠誤信合法而犯案，加上涉案謀劃不可能實現，望法庭給予及時認罪的呂，全數三分一刑期扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;呂撰求情信稱因本案失社工資格明白否決向政府施壓屬錯誤&quot;&gt;呂撰求情信稱因本案失社工資格、明白否決向政府施壓屬錯誤&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續呈上呂親撰的7頁求情信，呂提及成為社工是他從小志向，但因本案令他失去註冊社工的資格。呂來自破碎家庭，童年悲慘、受貧苦和孤獨所困，其父母離婚後撫養權歸父親，其後寄居不同人家中生活，直至被領養才頭一次獲得關心和愛護，生活慢慢改善。呂其後努力向上考入大學，成為全職社工貢獻社區，亦是一名虔誠的基督徒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續引述呂指，案發時受誤導，參與否決預算案的謀劃，以向政府施壓回應訴求，但現時已知道是錯誤，他深感後悔，承諾不會再犯。陳又指，呂在首次提堂後獲得保釋，自保釋以來，他珍惜其自由並更盡力幫助有需要的人，強調呂來自這樣的背景，能努力向上，有所作為，是值得讚揚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;求情信稱參選望當權者回應民意無知相信行使否決權合法&quot;&gt;求情信稱參選望當權者回應民意、無知相信行使否決權合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《獨媒》取得呂智恆求情信（全文見文末），呂提到成年後幾經挫折實現夢想成為社工，但終成為被告，永遠失去社工資格。他童年在不同人家寄居、曾被迫做童工和失學，至中四被領養，獲養母無私的愛和包容，終獲城大社工系取錄，老師莫慶聯激勵他立志「以生命影響生命」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;呂指，2008年畢業後成為社工，服務邊青，至2014年逐漸不覺可幫到街頭青少年，因學生時代察覺和倡議過的社福界制度問題在入職多年後全無改善。呂2018年入讀中大修讀基督教研究文學碩士，望尋找改變社會的答案，至2019年發生反修例引起的民主運動，心痛多人輕生、失蹤，深感這代青年絕望感遠超他童年所受痛苦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;呂續指，2020年疫情初期派防疫物資，深感市民無力，望當權者可回應民意，並形容他參加初選為了由人民授權行使否決權，「以非常無奈和間接的方式罷免特首，希望當權者回應民意」，沒有從政經驗和法律專業知識的他，當時無知地相信議員行使否決權是合法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;呂指，自保釋後數年經常失眠和感到巨大壓力，他現已明白否決預算案對政權帶來衝擊和影響運作是錯誤想法，感到後悔抱歉。呂指保釋期間小心遵守保釋條件，珍惜平凡生活的時光，想到即將入獄增家人負擔，萬分痛苦和歉疚，日後定會想起曾服務的小學生、露宿者等，亦相信常與養母唱詩歌是日後最珍貴和暖心的回憶。呂最後指，最喜歡電視劇《秘密森林》的對白「請堅信一絲希望，勝過無數絕望」，他深知罪名嚴重，不敢低估刑期，但會心存盼望，望未來報答親恩和服務弱勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方本案阻嚇效果眾所周知-法庭現需判處療癒式刑罰&quot;&gt;辯方：本案阻嚇效果眾所周知 法庭現需判處「療癒式刑罰」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑指，呂十分善良，是一個好人，他是具天真理念的政治新人，對社區有深厚貢獻，望法庭判刑時能展示「憐憫」，令呂可盡快重投社會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳最後指，接受任何違反《國安法》的行為須判處阻嚇性刑罰，但本案的阻嚇性效果已是眾所周知，「我們現在需要的，是法庭判處『療癒式刑罰（healing sentence）』」，因所有被告心靈飽受創傷（spiritually broken），是時候療癒。陳重申，望法庭判處「療癒式刑罰」，讓被告可以從此創傷中復原（healed from this trauma），社會亦同樣需要復原。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所有被告求情完畢，呂智恆主動撤銷保釋，即時還柙，林景楠則繼續以原有條件保釋。法官陳慶偉表示，當有決定後會再通知各方判刑日期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VPrRRlO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（3日）續處理參選新東的呂智恆和林景楠求情。林景楠一方望法庭考慮他遲參選、無簽「墨落無悔」等，參與程度低而視為「其他參加者」，又指林錄取口供和成為控方證人，其證供有用，可獲50%減刑，並望為林索取社會服務令報告。法官庭上多次質疑，指林僅在證供提及出席沈旭暉主持的協調會議，但沈並非本案共謀者、亦無因此被捕；法庭在裁決時也完全無依賴林的證供。對於辯方望索社服令報告，法官亦指是不現實、不合理，拒絕辯方要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上又讀出林景楠親撰的求情信節錄，林提到候審時通過接觸不同觀點的資訊，明白當初參選是「非常幼稚及愚蠢」的行為，「中了其他別有用心的國家、團體和人的計謀」，又引述國家主席習近平七一講話，指深切反思後發現很多港人包括自己，一直受到海外勢力或網絡傳媒渲染，間接成為反中亂港一分子。林主動聯絡警方認罪，感謝控方讓他成為證人，讓他可把所知所聞一一供出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林最後真誠向中央、特區政府及所有受影響市民真誠道歉，望法庭讓他履行作為父親的責任，陪伴三個子女成長，及予他機會，重新投入中港泰三地，用實際行動抓住香港由治及興的機會，說好香港和國家故事，促進一帶一路，為香港和國家出力。罪成45名被告求情完畢，法官押後通知判刑日期。呂智恆撤銷保釋還柙，林景楠則准續保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方林景楠遲參選無簽墨落屬其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：林景楠遲參選、無簽「墨落」屬「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林景楠的大律師范凱傑認為，林屬於刑期分級制最低程度的「其他參加者」，指他並非組織者，不曾出席協調會議和初選記者會，也沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，是初選的「遲到者（latecomer）」，與大部分其他被告不同，他於6月尾才參加初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指林證供有用可獲減刑-官屢質疑&quot;&gt;辯方指林證供有用可獲減刑 官屢質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范續指，林對警方的協助，可根據《國安法》33條獲得減刑，並呈上林於2023年錄取的兩份無損權益口供，指林以控方證人身分作供，指證其他串謀者，其證供有用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷，指兩份證供主要談及林本人對初選的參與，問哪部分談及其他人參與。劉頴匡一度望向鄒家成點頭發笑。范指提到沈旭暉，惟李運騰指，沈並非本案共謀者，林景楠雖稱曾參與沈舉行的協調會議，但「那不是串謀的一部分，不是『35+計劃』的一部分」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nR2tBXb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 沈旭暉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范再指，林的證供亦指證其他串謀者，包括區諾軒和趙家賢。法官李運騰反問，有任何爭議區是組織者之一嗎？法官陳仲衡亦問，辯方是否說區諾軒和趙家賢認罪是因為林的證供？范否認。李運騰續指，林證供唯一提到區諾軒的地方，是林發現已錯過初選的報名日期，並因知道區和趙是組織者，故聯絡區望讓他可參與，獲區回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指林指證沈旭暉-惟認資料無致沈被捕&quot;&gt;辯方指林指證沈旭暉 惟認資料無致沈被捕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范同意，指林證供的有用性，在於談及參加者如何參與串謀和初選，並在法官追問下，再指林為警方提供情報（intelligence），提及沈旭暉的參與。惟法官李運騰再指，沈無被指控為本案共謀者，問此資料有否導致警方拘捕或任何事情發生，范答沒有，被告欄的林卓廷發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後說，「你看，你要求50%減刑，50%是很多」，法官李運騰亦指，困難是沈旭暉並非本案共謀者，辯方基本上是叫法庭就有關一宗懷疑的事件（suspected event）、而非林認罪的案件的資料而減刑。范指沒有補充，強調林庭上是就他真實所知而作供。林景楠聽到相關對答時，數度搖頭，又低頭望地下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林求情信受渲染成反中亂港一分子-參選乃中別有用心人士計謀&quot;&gt;林求情信：受渲染成反中亂港一分子 參選乃中別有用心人士計謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後讀出林求情信「由不認罪到認罪的轉變」下的內容（求情信節錄全文見文末），提到被捕後他一直未認清真相、不明白初選對社會的負面影響，但候審期間「通過接觸其他朋友不同觀點的資訊和評論」，明白到當初參選是「非常幼稚及愚蠢的行為」，只是令社會更撕裂和混亂，甚至造成危害國安的後果。林又指，認識到參選令特首可能下台，「其實是中了其他別有用心的國家、團體和人的計謀」，他作為「黃色經濟圈領頭者」亦深深悔疚和反省，認為自己要為社會撕裂負上責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林又引述國家主席習近平2022年七一講話，指「香港不能亂也亂不起」，林自言聽到此「呼喚」，深切反思後發現很多港人包括自己，「一直受到很多海外勢力或網絡傳媒的渲染，間接成為反中亂港的一分子。」林指因此他主動聯絡國安處認罪，感謝控方讓他成為證人，「讓我可以把我的所知所聞一一供出」，展現真誠認罪。辯方讀出求情信時，劉頴匡一直點頭，林景楠則一度低頭俯身。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方林成為證人對家人及生意構成巨大壓力&quot;&gt;辯方：林成為證人對家人及生意構成巨大壓力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，林景楠引述習近平2022年7月1日的講話，但在數個月後，於2023年1月才表示願成為控方證人。辯方同意，指求情信提及林為何如此遲認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范又指，在公眾知道林或會成為控方證人後，對其生意和家人構成巨大壓力，並呈上阿布泰被公眾破壞等新聞片段。李運騰追問有無證據林作供令他或家人面對風險，范指有，重申有公眾破壞其店舖，部分被捕及被控；林亦因安全考慮，安排家人搬到泰國居住，望法庭考慮林成為控方證人有重大的負面影響。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方林曾參與課程認識國安疫情進行慈善工作&quot;&gt;辯方：林曾參與課程認識國安、疫情進行慈善工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范續指，在林改變主意成為控方證人後，曾參與課程認識國安，希望知道中國公民在港的義務，以及他作為公民維護國安的責任。而在疫情期間，林景楠的公司阿布泰曾為港人和海外人士提供大量醫療物品和資源，望法庭考慮其良好品格、慈善工作而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林望陪伴三子女成長向中央特區政府道歉&quot;&gt;林望陪伴三子女成長、向中央特區政府道歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范續讀出求情信最後，提到林知道罪行非常嚴重，望法庭讓他履行作為父親的責任，照顧三位小朋友及家人，陪伴他們成長。他也望法庭予他機會，重新投入中港泰三地用實際行動抓住香港由治及興的機會，說好香港和國家故事，促進一帶一路，為香港和國家出力。他最後向中央和特區政府，尤其海關、警方和所有被他影響的市民朋友真誠道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，求情信顯示林對所有受他錯誤行為影響的人的真誠道歉，顯示他真誠的後悔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望索社服令報告-官明言拒絕&quot;&gt;辯方望索社服令報告 官明言拒絕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，不論現實與否，望法庭能考慮在判刑前，為林景楠索取社會服務令報告。法官陳仲衡即指，認為辯方應向法庭就判刑量，而非判刑的方式陳詞（“I think you should address us on the quantum of sentence, not the form of sentence.”）。范回應，明白或要向法庭就判刑量陳詞，但仍希望在法律的界線內，判刑越寬大越好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，認為辯方要求「有點不現實（a bit unrealistic）」，亦不是妥善運用公眾資源，又認為辯方有很大的難處說服法庭，索取社服令報告是妥當。法官陳慶偉也向范說：「要求一個過於寬鬆的刑罰，是對你當事人的損害。（“Asking for a too lenient sentence, is doing a disservice to your client.”）」林卓廷聞言再發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范指，望法庭考慮《國安法》22條，法官陳慶偉指他讀過很多次，知道「其他參加者」可拘役或者管制。法官陳仲衡問，辯方是否仍要求索社服令報告，范回應他的指示是，法官陳慶偉即身體傾前，手指着范大聲說：「讓我告訴你，Mr. Fan，那已被拒絕。（“Let me say to you, Mr. Fan, that is refused.”）」法官陳仲衡也說：「你在三位法官前作出一個如此不合理的要求，是三重不合理。（“An unreasonable request like the one you are making before a bench of 3 judges, triples the unreasonableness.”）」林卓廷聞言呵呵發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范欲繼續陳詞，法官李運騰表明，本案太嚴重，已清楚表明法庭不會傾向索取社服令報告。法官陳慶偉笑說：「他（李）很有禮貌，他說『傾向』」，並指自己剛處理入屋犯法（burglary）案，案例中只有最特殊的情況才會可判社服令，而「那是一個入屋犯法案，這不是一個入屋犯法案」，「不要要求不可能的事，拜託。（“Don’t ask for the impossible, please.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指林開審始認罪僅減20判詞無依賴林證供&quot;&gt;官指林開審始認罪僅減20%、判詞無依賴林證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;范最後指，認為林屬「其他參加者」的最低程度。法官陳慶偉指，林只是於開審當天才認罪，根據案例只能減刑20%。法官李運騰亦指，即使考慮林的證供有用，法庭仍有酌情權考慮是否降低其刑罰等級；但辯方會留意到，法庭在裁決理由完全沒有依賴林景楠的證供，辯方同意。雙方對答期間，林景楠一度低頭俯身良久。散庭後，他走到庭外角落，背對在場人士以手揹拭淚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;所有被告求情完畢，呂智恆主動撤銷保釋，即時還柙，林景楠則繼續以原有條件保釋。得悉呂的決定後，林景楠一度向呂微笑點頭。法官陳慶偉表示，當有決定後會再通知各方判刑日期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;庭上讀出的林景楠求情信節錄&quot;&gt;庭上讀出的林景楠求情信節錄：&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021年1月，因本案被捕後，我一直未認清真相，沒有意識到參加初選的嚴重性，不明白初選的舉行對社會帶來的嚴重負面影響。我在等候審訊期間，通過接觸其他朋友不同觀點的資訊和評論，透過反覆論證，明白到自己當初參加初選是非常幼稚及愚蠢的行為，其效果不會令香港這個社會變得更好，而只是會令到社會更加撕裂和混亂，甚至乎會造成危國家安全的後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我認識到我參與初選而最終可能會令到行政長官下台，其實是中了其他別有用心的國家、團體和人的計謀，我更加認識到作為一名商人，應該努力透過國家的支持和經濟聯繫，使香港的經濟更加繁榮和社會更加發展，而不是參與政治裡面，企圖令香港成為反中分子的基地。透過深切的自我反省，我意識到自2019年起，社會上的撕裂我確實要負上不少責任，因為我是黃色經濟圈的領頭者，我深深悔疚和反省。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2022年7月1日，國家主席習近平在七一講話中提到，「香港不能亂也亂不起，更深感香港發展不能再耽擱，要排除一切干擾聚精會神謀發展。香港居民，不管從事什麼職業、信奉什麼理念，只要真心擁護「一國兩制」方針，只要熱愛香港這個家園，只要遵守基本法和特別行政區法律，都是建設香港的積極力量，都可以出一分力、作一份貢獻。」簡單來說，就是團結一切可以團結的人，我正如聽到這個呼喚，深切反思過去所做的一切，發現很多香港人包括我自己，一直受到很多海外勢力或網絡傳媒的渲染，間接成為反中亂港的一分子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;因為以上的反省，所以我主動聯絡警方國安處希望認罪，因為認罪才是最真誠的認錯，讓我可以在日後繼續為社會、為國家作貢獻。我亦感謝控方讓我成為證人，讓我可以把我的所知所聞一一供出。雖然因為我在比較後期才參加此初選，參與程度較低，但我仍選擇把所知所聞一一說出，希望展現我真誠的認罪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我知道顛覆國家政權是非常嚴重的罪行，但我希望法庭能寬大考慮，讓我履行作為父親的責任，照顧三位小朋友及家人，陪伴他們成長。我希望法庭考慮我是初犯，我坦白承認罪行，及我在案中參與程度較低給予機會，讓我重新投入中港泰三地用實際行動抓住香港由治及興、疫情與世界接軌的機會，說好香港故事，說好國家故事，繼續促進一帶一路，為香港和國家出力。最後我希望在此求情信的結尾，向中央政府、特區政府，尤其是香港海關和香港警隊以及所有被我影響到的市民朋友真誠道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

Russia’s dirty bomb signaling in the fall of 2022 is an important reminder about the threat of nuclear escalation in regional conflicts involving U.S. partners or allies.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;The scare also highlights an enduring feature of nuclear crises: uncertainty about adversary intentions. To prepare for the next nuclear crisis and the uncertainty that it will entail, the United States should develop detailed plans for a wide range of nuclear contingences, including those short of nuclear use. A close examination of Russia’s dirty bomb signaling in October 2022 offers three principles for doing so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fall 2022, the United States faced what may have been its most dangerous nuclear crisis in decades. Confronted by intensifying Russian nuclear rhetoric and intercepted conversations about nuclear use in the Russian military, Western leaders were deeply worried about escalation risks. President Biden warned that Putin was “not joking . . . about the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons,” and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan asserted that the United States took the threat of nuclear use “deadly seriously.” Behind closed doors, the United States and its allies urgently planned for a Russian nuclear strike. Of particular concern were Russia’s dirty bomb claims. At the end of October, amid a string of battlefield setbacks, senior Russian military and political leaders began a coordinated messaging effort claiming that Ukraine planned to use a dirty bomb. U.S. officials worried that this narrative was an effort to establish a pretext for nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident illustrates a critical and unresolved challenge: nuclear crises are likely to continue, and the United States will be forced to respond to cryptic signals and escalatory rhetoric with imperfect information. Even today, the true purpose of Russia’s dirty bomb claims remains unclear. While Russian signaling may have been related to planned nuclear use, there are a variety of other plausible explanations, including that the narrative aimed to sway domestic audiences or reflected genuine Russian concerns. U.S. policymakers have faced uncertainty in past crises, but the ambiguity that they faced in October 2022 was fundamentally different. Whereas U.S. leaders have often broadly understood the adversary’s objectives and the connection between the adversary’s signaling and those objectives, in October 2022, U.S. leaders were unsure how the dirty bomb narrative connected to the Kremlin’s broader objectives in Ukraine or whether it was even intended as a nuclear signal. As tensions with nuclear rivals persist, the United States may face similarly ambiguous signaling in future crises over areas such as the Taiwan Strait, Korean Peninsula, or Eastern Europe. This uncertainty is increasingly likely due to U.S. adversaries’ growing reliance on nuclear threats, the sometimes confusing nature of their signaling, and the challenges that the United States faces in collecting intelligence about their decisionmaking. The United States should therefore prepare for future crises by developing plans for a wide range of nuclear contingencies, including those short of nuclear use. An analysis of the October 2022 crisis offers three guiding principles for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This incident illustrates a critical and unresolved challenge: nuclear crises are likely to continue, and the United States will be forced to respond to cryptic signals and escalatory rhetoric with imperfect information.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nuclear-signaling-in-the-ukraine-war&quot;&gt;Nuclear Signaling in the Ukraine War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Project on Nuclear Issues recently published a study cataloguing and analyzing Russian and NATO statements about nuclear weapons during the first 18 months of the war in Ukraine. The study found that Russia’s nuclear signaling initially focused on deterring direct Western intervention in Ukraine. Putin issued the first threat against Western intervention in his February 24 announcement of the “special military operation in Ukraine,” and he and other Kremlin officials echoed the threat in the following weeks. Russian officials often warned broadly against “interference” in the war and made repeated, ambiguous references to Russia’s nuclear doctrine writ large but were generally clear that direct Western intervention in Ukraine would likely prompt a nuclear response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian signaling changed in two important ways in the early fall of 2022. Beginning in September, Russian officials warned that Russia could use nuclear weapons to defend annexed Ukrainian territory. The motivation for these threats was unclear. Some analysts assessed that the Kremlin sought to deter Ukrainian counteroffensives, but this rhetoric instead may have been related to efforts to legitimize the annexation referendums that Putin announced on September 21. Also in September, Russian officials began warning about nuclear risks created by Western aid to Ukraine. Russian officials specifically targeted the U.S. supplying of long-range missiles to Ukraine, warning that the delivery of those weapons would cross a “red line” and make the United States a party to the conflict. Other officials cautioned more broadly against continued military aid for Ukraine and the risk such aid carried, namely direct conflict between the two nuclear powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;six-days-in-october&quot;&gt;Six Days in October&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian signaling took a dramatic shift in late October 2022. Russian state media reported that Ukraine was close to completing work on a dirty bomb, whose use would enable Ukraine to accuse Russia of using a nuclear weapon and thereby “trigger a powerful anti-Russian movement in the world aimed at undermining trust in Moscow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These accusations followed a series of Russian battlefield setbacks over the preceding two months. In late August, Ukraine launched an offensive to liberate Kherson Oblast, including Kherson City — the most populous and economically significant prize that Putin had captured in his invasion. This push made slow progress but put Russian forces on the west bank of the Dnipro River in an increasingly precarious position as the fall progressed. In early September, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise offensive in Kharkiv Oblast that made rapid gains, having caught Russian forces off guard. Beyond retaking territory — which Russia claimed as its own on September 30 — Ukraine’s push in the south threatened to trap approximately 25,000 Russian troops on the west bank of the Dnipro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Beyond retaking territory — which Russia claimed as its own on September 30 — Ukraine’s push in the south threatened to trap approximately 25,000 Russian troops on the west bank of the Dnipro.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By October 22, Ukrainian gains in Kharkiv had slowed and Russian forces had begun to withdraw across the Dnipro, though it remained unclear whether they would be able to complete the evacuation in good order. It was in this context that Kremlin officials began to warn about a Ukrainian dirty bomb. What follows is a brief chronology of these warnings from their introduction on October 23 to their conclusion on October 28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-23&quot;&gt;October 23&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 23, the same day that Russian state media first reported Ukraine’s dirty bomb plans, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu called his U.S., UK, French, and Turkish counterparts to discuss the alleged threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly following Shoigu’s calls, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France rejected Russia’s claims in a P3 foreign ministers statement: “Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia’s transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-24&quot;&gt;October 24&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, October 24, Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov called his U.S. and UK counterparts to discuss the alleged threat. Separately, the chairman of the lower house of the Duma posted on Telegram that Ukraine’s supporters were sponsors of nuclear terrorism. Russia’s UN ambassador wrote a letter to the UN secretary general warning that Russia would view Ukraine’s use of a dirty bomb as an act of “nuclear terrorism.” The head of Russia’s radiological, biological, and chemical defense forces, meanwhile, delivered a briefing in which he stated that Russian forces were preparing to operate in a radioactive environment. In response to the P3 statement the day prior, presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov insisted that the dirty bomb threat was real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western officials continued to reject Russian officials’ claims. State Department spokesperson Ned Price described the claims as a pretext for escalation, and NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg cautioned that Russian claims could signal preparations for a false flag attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-25&quot;&gt;October 25&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Western officials’ continued rejection of the dirty bomb narrative, Peskov and Russia’s ambassador to the United States reiterated Russia’s claims and criticized the West’s response to Russian warnings as “far from serious.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to a reporter’s question about whether Putin was preparing to use a dirty bomb, Biden warned that it would be an “incredibly serious mistake” to use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-26&quot;&gt;October 26&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin echoed the dirty bomb claims during an October 26 meeting of security and intelligence heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Earlier in the day, he had overseen Russia’s annual Grom nuclear drill, which simulated the delivery of a “massive” nuclear strike and involved the launch of an SLBM and an ICBM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same day, Shoigu called his Indian and Chinese counterparts to discuss the alleged dirty bomb threat. India’s defense minister, Rajnath Singh, warned Shoigu that neither side should resort to using nuclear or radiological weapons, since their use would violate “the basic tenets of humanity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking with reporters, Stoltenberg asserted that Russian leaders understood there would be “severe consequences” for nuclear use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-27&quot;&gt;October 27&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin reiterated his claims that Ukraine would use a bomb to accuse Russia of detonating a nuclear weapon at an October 27 meeting of the Valdai Club. At the same time, he asserted that Russia did not need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, saying “there is no sense in it for us, neither political nor military.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. secretary of defense Lloyd Austin, speaking at a press conference, explained that the United States was concerned about escalation in Ukraine and warned that nuclear use would be met with a “very significant response.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;october-28&quot;&gt;October 28&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s first deputy permanent representative to the United Nations — Dmitry Polyansky — issued the last explicit warning about a Ukrainian dirty bomb on October 28, asserting that Ukraine sought to use the bomb to trigger direct Western intervention in Ukraine. Russia’s warnings about an imminent Ukrainian dirty bomb attack then abruptly ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;denouement&quot;&gt;Denouement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next statement by a senior Russian official about nuclear risks came on November 1, when Dmitry Medvedev wrote on Telegram that Ukraine’s declared aim of liberating all of its occupied territory posed a threat to the existence of the Russian state. The following day the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement on preventing nuclear war, which reaffirmed Russia’s commitment to avoiding nuclear war and called on the five permanent members of the UN Security council to cease “encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction, which can lead to catastrophic consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces successfully completed their withdrawal from Kherson City on November 9. While Russian officials have occasionally referenced the possibility of Ukraine building a dirty bomb since October 28, these statements have lacked the urgency and coordination that characterized Russia’s October warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-nuclear-close-call&quot;&gt;A Nuclear Close Call?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While U.S. officials dismissed Russia’s dirty bomb claims as an effort to establish a pretext for nuclear use, they appeared uncertain of the narrative’s true purpose. Biden, for example, admitted on October 25 that he did not know the purpose of the narrative, saying “I’m not guaranteeing you that it’s a false flag operation yet. I don’t know.” Subsequent reporting about the crisis also pointed to confusion about the rationale for the narrative. The New York Times and CNN’s Jim Sciutto both wrote that some officials were concerned that the narrative could have been a pretext for nuclear use or as preparation for a false flag, suggesting that there was no consensus on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, one can identify at least five plausible explanations for Russia’s dirty bomb signaling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation for nuclear use:&lt;/strong&gt; Putin was considering or had already decided to use nuclear weapons in October 2022 and sought to use dirty bomb claims to establish a pretext.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coercive threat:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kremlin intended the dirty bomb narrative as a veiled nuclear threat to influence the behavior of Ukraine and its Western backers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincere belief:&lt;/strong&gt; Putin and Russian national security officials genuinely believed that Ukraine might use a dirty bomb and sought to deny Ukraine a pretext, generate international pressure against the threat, and turn global opinion against Ukraine and its Western supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domestic signaling:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kremlin sought to use the threat of a dirty bomb to instill fear in the Russian population and thereby boost support for the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distraction:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kremlin sought to use dirty bomb claims to distract from other military or political activity in which Russia was concurrently engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these explanations are mutually compatible and it is impossible to definitively determine which are relevant from open sources. Nonetheless, some explanations are stronger than others. The “preparation for nuclear use” and “sincere belief” explanations, for example, both align with much of the available evidence, including public statements and international outreach about a dirty bomb and Russia’s announcement of preparations to operate on a radioactive battlefield. The “coercive threat” explanation, on the other hand, is comparatively weaker; the dirty bomb narrative did not feature clear threats or demands and U.S. officials did not observe any unusual movements of Russia’s nuclear forces — behavior that one might expect if the Kremlin sought to credibly threaten nuclear escalation. While it is more difficult to assess the “distraction” and “domestic signaling” explanations from open sources, the latter has historical precedent. Putin has fabricated foreign threats to rally support for his wars in the past and had planned to do so to justify his invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crisis-management-under-uncertainty&quot;&gt;Crisis Management under Uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The October 2022 crisis underscores an enduring dilemma the United States is likely to face in future nuclear crises: how to make decisions about escalation and de-escalation based on ambiguous signals from adversaries. While uncertainty is not new for U.S. policymakers, in October 2022, the Biden administration fundamentally did not understand if or how the dirty bomb narrative related to the Kremlin’s broader objectives in Ukraine or if it was intended as a nuclear signal. The causes for this unusual degree of ambiguity are not fully clear, but heightened nuclear tensions and sustained Russian nuclear signaling in the weeks and months prior were important pieces of context that muddied the waters and raised questions about the purpose of subsequent Russian narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued tensions between the United States and Russia over Ukraine and the looming threat of conflicts in the Taiwan Strait and the Korean Peninsula point to the risk of another nuclear crisis in the coming years. Given the growing frequency with which key U.S. adversaries rattle the nuclear saber, the sometimes ambiguous nature of their signaling, and the difficulties that the United States faces in collecting intelligence about their decisionmaking, U.S. leaders should prepare to navigate future nuclear crises with limited understandings of adversary intentions and objectives. The context and specifics of future crises will differ but, as in October 2022, there will be a range of plausible explanations for adversary signaling. Given this, three principles apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Continued tensions between the United States and Russia over Ukraine and the looming threat of conflicts in the Taiwan Strait and the Korean Peninsula point to the risk of another nuclear crisis in the coming years.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beware-inadvertent-escalation&quot;&gt;Beware Inadvertent Escalation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When facing uncertainty about the motivations for adversary nuclear rhetoric or posturing, U.S. leaders should refrain from actions that the adversary may misinterpret and respond to with escalation. Measures that the United States has taken to demonstrate resolve in past crises, such as bomber patrols, alerts, and missile tests, can carry unseen risks when the adversary’s motivations are unknown. If, for example, an adversary’s nuclear signaling is driven by concerns about U.S. or allied intentions, they may interpret U.S. nuclear posturing as confirmation that that an attack is imminent. The United States’ response to Russia’s dirty bomb allegations consisted almost entirely of verbal statements and back-channel diplomacy, thus avoiding actions that could have provoked inadvertent escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-adversary-can-be-wrong&quot;&gt;The Adversary Can Be Wrong&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be tempting to assume the worst when faced with deep uncertainty about adversaries’ intentions. U.S. leaders should keep in mind that U.S. adversaries are fallible, and that their confusing behavior might be the product of faulty assumptions or poor information. The dirty bomb scare may have reflected sincere concern on the part of Russia’s leaders resulting from flawed intelligence; it is impossible to be sure. U.S. policymakers should resist the urge to interpret adversary rhetoric and posturing through the lens of worst-case thinking and should consider all possible explanations when weighing how to respond to ambiguous signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomacy-is-cheap&quot;&gt;Diplomacy Is Cheap&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building international pressure against nuclear use is a relatively cheap, risk-free tool to pressure adversaries to either de-escalate or clarify their signaling. The United States made good use of this tool during the October 2022 crisis, when it encouraged India and China to publicly oppose nuclear use in Ukraine. U.S. officials later asserted that Indian and Chinese pressure helped to deter Putin from using nuclear weapons. Going forward, diplomatic outreach to influential third parties should be a tool of first resort during periods of heightened nuclear risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparing-for-the-next-nuclear-crisis&quot;&gt;Preparing for the Next Nuclear Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To crystallize the lessons of the October 2022 crisis, the incoming administration should establish an interagency planning group — modeled after the Ukraine Tiger Team created in 2021 — to game out whole-of-government responses to a wide range of nuclear contingencies. The group should consider potential crises in both the Indo-Pacific and Eastern Europe, and should plan for scenarios short of nuclear use, including periods of acute nuclear tension and ambiguous adversary signaling. Further, the group should consider the challenges posed by opportunistic aggression and plan out responses to scenarios involving multiple simultaneous or successive nuclear crises across different theaters. Given that future nuclear crises will almost certainly involve allied forces, territory, or interests, it will be crucial to involve allies in the planning process. While the circumstances of future crises will vary and contingency plans developed today will inevitably lose relevance over time, a rigorous planning process may yield durable crisis management insights that can help future administrations avoid the planning crunch that the Biden administration faced in the fall of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

The shock represented a test not just of Europe’s energy sector but of the resilience of Europe’s democratic political system and market economies.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Europe’s strong response has demonstrated that an accelerated energy transition is possible amid strong political and economic headwinds when backed by a broad popular consensus for ambitious action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of Europe’s actions have been remarkable. The European Union has reckoned with the false promise of its long-standing energy interdependence with Russia, as the energy sector has been central to Putin’s consolidation of power inside of Russia and has been weaponized in the Kremlin’s engagement with neighboring countries. In 2022, Russian fossil fuels supplied 1 in 5 units of energy consumed in the European Union; in 2024, that figure fell to 1 in 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As imports of Russian fossil fuels fell precipitously after Russia’s invasion, EU members took ambitious steps to enhance domestic energy supply capacities and develop alternatives to Russian imports. Coal-fired power plants were temporarily revived, policies to phase out nuclear power were revisited, Norwegian piped gas flows into the European Union increased significantly, transatlantic coordination redirected liquified natural gas volumes toward Europe, and renewables were dramatically expanded. EU institutions were instrumental in overseeing a unified response and set the direction for its member states, from creating collective agreement on the need to decouple from Russian energy over time to setting targets for demand reduction and ensuring that Europe would not abandon its climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe emerged from the crisis as a stronger energy actor, challenges remain in areas spanning electricity market reform to hydrogen diplomacy to protecting critical undersea infrastructure. From a supply perspective, Europe has found a way to replace Russian gas. But this energy is largely coming from sources external to the European Union, and the costs of these alternative sources will be higher and therefore impact Europe’s economic competitiveness. Furthermore, as Europe accelerates its green transition, it must address the risk posed by increasing import dependencies in clean tech supply chains, particularly from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis spawned many lessons relevant for experts and policymakers in a variety of fields. Most of the lessons are positive. Europe’s democracies and markets proved resilient to shocks, Russia failed in its attempt to blackmail EU member states into ceding support for Ukraine, and the European Union proved its geopolitical mettle amid a potentially devastating crisis. However, the crisis also left a significant fiscal mark on European economies and, through price shock and inflationary effects, gave rise to more anti-establishment parties, many of which may seek to roll back aspects of the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 triggered an energy crisis in Europe unmatched in severity since the oil shock of the 1970s. The energy shock became a test not just of Europe’s energy sector but of Europe’s union and the resilience of its democratic political system, market economy, and free and open societies. How Europe responded to this crisis explains much about the European project, the energy transition, and the nature of energy security in a new era of profound geopolitical competition and upheaval. Europe has demonstrated that a rapid energy transition is possible in the face of an urgent need and when backed by strong political consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the more than two years since the start of the war, Europe’s energy mix and energy map have changed dramatically. Europe today appears not only more energy resilient than before the crisis, but also just as intent on achieving an energy transition that will be responsive to climate change and that will reduce its external dependencies and improve competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of Europe’s actions have been remarkable. The European Union has reduced Russian fossil fuel imports from $16 billion per month in early 2022 to around $1 billion per month by the end of 2023, with cuts to oil imports representing the main driver of the decline. In 2022, Russian fossil fuels supplied 1 in 5 units of energy consumed in the European Union; in 2024, that figure fell to 1 in 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Russia has decisively proven itself to be an unreliable supplier of energy, that will choose to weaponize its energy resources as a tool of political coercion. . . . Today we’re in an environment where Russia is never again going to be seen as a reliable supplier of energy. And where Europe’s transition away from Russian energy has progressed much faster than predicted and marks a really permanent shift in the international energy map.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-geoffrey-r-pyatt-us-assistant-secretary-for-energy-resources&quot;&gt;— Geoffrey R. Pyatt, U.S. Assistant Secretary for Energy Resources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that European leaders did everything right or that this transition was inexpensive. The loss of Russian supplies amid the war disproved decades of belief that interdependence would secure peace. Disbelief in Europe’s capacity to manage the crisis may also have prevented even bolder action against the Russian energy sector in the early stages of the war, blunting the effects on the Russian economy. Even today, Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) and piped gas are still part of Europe’s energy mix, and Europe remains dependent on Russia for nuclear fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massive fiscal outlays were deployed to keep industry afloat, particularly in Germany. According to Bruegel estimates, from the beginning of the crisis in September 2021 until June 2023, €651 billion was allocated and earmarked across European countries to shield consumers from rising energy costs. The loss of a relatively cheap and seemingly stable supply of Russian natural gas has significant implications for industrial competitiveness, and for the German economy in particular. Longer-term issues related to persistently elevated prices and the implications for the European Union’s competitiveness will still have to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There is no doubt that geopolitics and political stability is a prerequisite for energy security, and vice versa. This was a hard lesson we learned in Europe from the recent geopolitical and energy crises and came at high cost. It pushed us to reconsider the definition of security of supply.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, there were fears that the shock of energy costs would turn Europeans against supporting Ukraine; however, these were unfounded. As European households turned down their thermostats in the winter of 2022–23 and paid, on average, 14 percent more for electricity and 114 percent more for gas to heat their homes from the first half of 2021 to October 2022, they knew Russia was to blame for the crisis, and support for Ukraine remained high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European project has advanced in this crisis. European governments worked together through the European Union to adopt sanctions and construct a crisis energy plan. The European Union leveraged the resources it borrowed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic to help countries cope and established an effort to procure LNG on behalf of the bloc. As a result, the European Union is a much more prominent energy actor than before the crisis. The situation demonstrates not only that the European Union is forged in crisis but also that the union enables Europe to respond to crises much more powerfully and effectively than if countries operated independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transatlantic relations also strengthened as U.S.-EU cooperation on energy and sanctions significantly increased. U.S.-EU engagement and coordination in these sectors have become much more robust and have laid the groundwork for a stronger U.S.-EU relationship — a relationship that historically has been strained or limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report reviews Europe’s response to the energy shock following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Chapter 1 sets the stage by examining the European energy system and approach to energy security prior to the invasion. Chapter 2 outlines how Russia weaponized energy and details the challenges posed to Europe’s energy supply in 2022. Chapter 3 outlines Europe’s response to the crisis, including the steps it and its partners have taken, and its effort to decouple from Russian energy. Chapter 4 examines the postcrisis policy landscape and identifies current and future challenges for Europe. Chapter 5 offers some thoughts on lessons learned from the crisis. Chapter 6 provides some concluding thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link between energy and security has been at the heart of the European project since its inception after World War II. The creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952 — involving France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg — marked the first attempt at integrating European markets after the war. Coal and steel were the focus because these sectors were critical to waging war. Robert Schuman, the French foreign minister and the ECSC’s principal architect, noted that “the solidarity in production” from pooling coal and steel production would make “any war between France and Germany . . . not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible.” As a catalyst of European integration, energy is core to the conception of the European Union as a project that brought peace to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, while energy was an initial focus for European integration, it was largely pushed to the side as European integration marched forward through the decades. Although energy market integration was continuously discussed over the following decades, the focus for policymakers was squarely on the security of supply. That meant European energy integration made limited advances relative to the extensive economic and political integration Europe would experience; energy policy would remain the domain of Europe’s national governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not until the 1980s, when policymakers shifted their focus to forging a single European market, that European energy integration was considered. A 1988 European Commission working paper conceptualized the idea of a functioning internal energy market, recognizing the need to harmonize rules and technical norms, liberalize public procurement, and remove fiscal barriers such as diverging tax laws. However, the recommendations set forth in the working paper were met with widespread opposition, as they sought to uproot markets with entrenched incumbents enjoying both national and natural monopolies. Although the commission continued developing plans for greater energy integration and liberalization in the 1990s, once again no energy chapter was included in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which formed the European Union. Member states vetoed efforts to include energy in the treaty, wishing to retain control over their national energy policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following decades, the European Union took incremental steps to create an internal energy market. Between 1996 and 1998, the European Parliament passed its First Energy Package directives on the electricity and gas markets, which were weaker versions of the commission proposals that member states in the European Council had rejected. However, according to Joseph Dutton, “Nevertheless they substantially bolstered the moves towards an internal marketplace and attempted to remove ‘legal monopolies’ and obliged vertically integrated companies to grant third party access to networks.” Yet the range of transmission systems and lack of cross-border infrastructure linkages hindered formation of an internal European market. In the 2000s, environmental policy became much more of a focus, and the European Union continued to pass regulations to address friction in the internal market. In 2019, the European Union adopted its Fourth Energy Package, which strengthened the role of the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators in facilitating cross-border cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some progress, Europe entered the 2022 energy crisis, 50 years after the Middle East oil embargoes of the 1970s, far from achieving a true energy union. From a regulatory point of view, the energy sector had been liberalized by eliminating monopolies, implementing unbundling rules, and opening access to infrastructure to competitors. However, implementation of these rules often had limited success due to strong resistance. Legacy monopoly companies still had a dominant market position, and the development of interconnections, both gas and electricity, was in many cases insufficient to guarantee an integrated and functional cross-border market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-false-promise-of-energy-interdependence-with-russia&quot;&gt;The False Promise of Energy Interdependence with Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the main threat to European security was seemingly gone. Not only could Europeans enjoy a peace dividend and shrink their defense budgets, but engagement with Russia could seemingly strengthen Europe’s energy security as well. There was vast potential in the Russian energy sector, not only to strengthen links with Europe’s advanced economies but also to invest and modernize these Russian industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from Europe’s postwar experience, the hypothesis of change through trade (Wandel durch Handel) — mostly associated with German foreign policy — gave a strategic rationale for deepening European energy integration with Russia. EU leaders believed interdependence would bring trading partners closer to European values and practices. Thus, buying Russian energy and investing in the Russian energy sector not only were good for Europe economically but also would serve to keep Russia on the democratic path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flaws in the “change through trade” strategy became apparent well before Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The energy sector has been central to Putin’s Russia since he came to office in 2000; it was essential to his consolidation of power inside Russia and a key part of Russian foreign policy. Upon becoming president in 2000, Putin sought to exert control over the energy sector, leading to confrontations with Russian oligarchs such as the head of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was arrested after questioning the illiberalism of the Putin regime. Putin has personally selected the heads of Russian energy companies, such as Igor Sechin, CEO of Rosneft. There are numerous accounts of Putin demonstrating to Western officials and businesspeople his in-depth understanding of energy markets. For example, Daniel Yergin writes in The New Map that Putin “understood the power that came from Russia’s oil and gas. Western interlocutors would be consistently surprised by his detailed knowledge of the energy industry and energy markets and the fluency with which he discussed the intricacies — as much like a CEO, they would say, as a head of state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia repeatedly weaponized energy resources in its engagement with neighboring countries. Gazprom threatened to cut the supply of gas to Ukraine in 2005 when Ukraine refused to accept a fivefold price increase. Prior to Russia’s invasion of Georgia, disruptions in gas flows forced the Georgian government to ration supplies. In the week following Russia’s 2014 invasion of Crimea, Gazprom hiked the price of gas exports to Ukraine from $268.50 per thousand cubic meters (mcm) to $385.50 per mcm, and ultimately to $485.00 per mcm. Russia has also provided gas cost-free to the breakaway region of Transnistria in Moldova since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s energy blackmail of former Soviet countries failed to induce a serious reassessment of European energy security. On the one hand, Russia’s tactics were not seen as applicable to Europe given its market size. On the other hand, many European leaders and businesses struggled to see an alternative, especially since U.S. LNG exports to Europe were insignificant in volume, renewables were still largely aspirational, nuclear power suffered from deep negative connotations, and coal had stark climate ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s faith in mutual interdependence, however, failed to recognize that Putin’s Russia had consistently prioritized geopolitical advancement over the health of its economy. Yet Russia believed Europe’s priorities were the opposite: European leaders and societies would put their economic well-being ahead of geopolitics. The long-held Soviet-era perception of the decadent, capitalist West caring only about profit remains deeply rooted in the Kremlin today. As such, as Russian forces amassed on Ukraine’s borders, Putin likely believed he had leverage. Russia could absorb the economic and political hit caused by an energy shock, whereas European leaders could not; therefore, Europe’s response to the invasion would be performative and limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;development-of-european-gas-markets-and-integration-with-russia&quot;&gt;Development of European Gas Markets and Integration with Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has consistently been dependent on energy imports, particularly oil, petroleum products, and natural gas. The data shows that energy import dependency has grown since 1990 (see Figure 1). In 2021, 91.7 percent of EU energy demand for oil and petroleum products and 83.4 percent of demand for natural gas were covered by extra-EU imports. By 2021, a significant share of EU imports came from Russia, including 45 percent of total gas imports and nearly half of total coal imports. At that time, more than half of Russia’s oil exports were also directed to Europe, which accounted for about one-third of Europe’s total oil imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sPaQngp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the gas infrastructure connecting Russia to Europe has been the clearest symbol of Russia’s status as a fossil fuel superpower and its influence over Europe. The geopolitics of these gas pipelines has historically been complex for the European Union and its member states, given their diverging interests and outlooks as well as historical ties to Russia (the first pipelines date to the 1960s). After the Cold War, and thanks to an effective commercial diplomacy campaign, Gazprom established new infrastructure projects (TurkStream and Nord Stream), which made it possible to circumvent transit countries identified as problematic — mostly Ukraine and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No energy infrastructure project reflected this development better than the Nord Stream gas pipelines connecting western Russia with Germany via the Baltic Sea. Established by a consortium led by Gazprom and operational since 2011, Nord Stream 1 had a capacity of 55 billion cubic meters (bcm), equivalent to roughly a third of EU gas imports from Russia in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s first invasion of Ukraine occurred in March 2014 when it annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Despite these evolving security and geopolitical realities, Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, E.ON, OMV, and Engie reached a commercial agreement roughly a year later over Nord Stream 2, a second gas pipeline connecting Russia and Germany. However, extensive legal battles and U.S. sanctions beginning in 2019 significantly delayed construction of the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backers of the pipeline projects, which included the Russian government and high-profile German politicians from the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party argued that they would ensure stability of supply by connecting Europe with the world’s largest gas reserves in Russia while supporting the continent’s sustainability goals as a less carbon-intensive complement than coal to renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opponents, which included the United States, various environmental groups, several other German politicians, and many of the Eastern European countries most exposed to Russian aggression, claimed that the projects would lock in dependence on Russia, enable Russia to extort Ukraine, be harmful to marine ecosystems, and undermine Europe’s green transition. Despite attempts by supporters to frame the projects as a strictly commercial undertaking, opponents argued that an overreliance on Russian gas would leave Europe at the Kremlin’s mercy and susceptible to energy blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“You should probably underscore that Europe is not as uniform as we might often think. . . . There’s the UK versus EU, but there’s also the Western versus Eastern Europe, or the post-Soviet Europe, which in my view has seen energy security, from the perspective of dependence on Russia, very differently than the West.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-anna-mikulska-research-staff-member-institute-for-defense-analyses&quot;&gt;— Anna Mikulska, Research Staff Member, Institute for Defense Analyses&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nord Stream pipelines were thus largely a German story. Germany is the largest EU country in terms of the size of its population and economy. Its economic weight is disproportionate, representing a quarter of overall EU gross domestic product (GDP). While efforts were made (and sometimes are still made) to portray Nord Stream 2 as a European project, it was driven by German commercial, economic, and political interests. During a visit to St. Petersburg in November 2017, German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel affirmed German support for the project. He stated, “Now is a good time for us to intensify our economic cooperation. We’ve always known Russia as an especially reliable gas supplier.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the interconnected European gas network and markets meant that Russian natural gas could also make its way to France, the Netherlands, and other European states and influence their energy systems. The availability of low-priced supply made it easier for the Netherlands to close its Groningen gas field given local earthquake concerns. While the United States undertook a shale gas revolution, European gas production declined dramatically in the last decade, in large part due to the perceived stability and low cost of Russian supply. Private investment in European gas production made little sense given the economic headwinds of Russian gas and the political headwinds of climate policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Germany’s broader energy policies compounded the energy security risks of a strategic bet on Russian piped gas. Germany’s decision to phase out nuclear power stands out. While nuclear power supplied a quarter of Germany’s electricity demand a decade ago, today no nuclear power plants remain operational. Availability of cheap Russian gas enabled the economic feasibility of this nuclear phaseout as gas generation and renewables replaced lost nuclear generation capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The large contribution by nuclear power was controversial, as public support for it has eroded since the 1980s. By 2002, public pressure brought forth a law mandating the closure of Germany’s entire fleet of nuclear power plants. The 2011 Fukushima accident unleashed significant blowback on German chancellor Angela Merkel, until then a staunch supporter of nuclear power, and catalyzed previously stalled implementation of the 2002 law. For example, Merkel ally and long-time defender of atomic energy Stefan Mappus lost the state premier position as an incumbent in Baden-Württemberg, an otherwise conservative state, to a challenger from the Green Party. Three months later, the Bundestag agreed to phase out nuclear energy by 2022. Although the shutdown was delayed in October 2022 for several months due to energy security concerns related to the war in Ukraine, Germany’s last nuclear power plant disconnected from the electricity grid in April 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2020, Russian gas pipelines supplied 41.5 percent of total EU gas imports, with a dominant position in many captive markets through long-term contracts and situations of quasi-monopoly (see Figure 2). Gazprom’s influence also extended to the commercialization and storage of its gas on European soil. Through its subsidiaries (Gazprom Germania and Gazprom Marketing and Trading), it managed a dense network of underground gas storage facilities, distribution networks, and trading companies. In 2020, Gazprom Germania had total assets of €8.4 billion and equity of €2.2 billion. In particular, Gazprom Germania had the largest gas storage capacity in the European Union, with infrastructure in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and the Netherlands, which gave the company a dominant position in the EU gas market. Gazprom’s influence was not limited to energy. The company’s clout extended from politics to sports through funding and sponsorship, making it a recognizable brand to many European citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1j55ce3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has exerted significant diplomatic pressure on Germany and consistently framed the Nord Stream projects in geopolitical terms. In December 2019, U.S. president Donald Trump signed a law that would impose sanctions on any firm involved with helping Gazprom finish the pipeline into the European Union, describing the project as a “tool of coercion.” Even then, the U.S. Department of State highlighted the adverse implications for Ukraine, noting that Nord Stream 2 “would enable Russia to bypass Ukraine for gas transit to Europe, which would deprive Ukraine of substantial transit revenues and increase its vulnerability to Russian aggression.” However, critics of Washington’s approach often interpreted U.S. geopolitical pressure as partly a cynical effort to advance the U.S. LNG industry. The administration of U.S. president Joe Biden continued opposition to Russian gas. In March 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the pipeline as “a Russian geopolitical project intended to divide Europe and weaken European energy security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nord Stream 2 was one of the most prominent issues in Chancellor Merkel’s final visit to Washington in July 2021. On that visit, President Biden agreed not to sanction German companies participating in the project, stating, “Good friends can disagree . . . but by the time I became President, it was 90 percent completed. And imposing sanctions did not seem to make any sense.” This was seen as a major concession to the chancellor and drew significant political blowback from both sides of the aisle in Washington. By September 2021, the construction of Nord Stream 2 had been completed, awaiting only certification from German regulators to begin operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this was not simply a case of the dependence of Germany, Europe’s largest economy. Given its position in Europe, Germany was effectively imposing dependence on the rest of Europe. Eastern European countries, whose energy systems were built to integrate with Russia’s, were also heavily dependent on Russian energy supplies. Poland, one of the most vocal countries about the threat posed by Russia, received 46 percent of its natural gas, 64 percent of its oil, and 15 percent of its coal from Russia in 2022, according to the think tank Forum Energii. Latvia was 100 percent dependent on Russia for its natural gas supplies. Changing course in Europe’s broader energy strategy would become too costly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, as more than 100,000 Russian forces surrounded Ukraine in the autumn of 2021, Europe found itself utterly dependent on Russia for its energy security. For example, at the time Germany lacked any LNG import capacity. In 2022, Germany imported 55 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and with Nord Stream 2 set to open, that dependence was likely to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;precrisis-energy-transition-plans&quot;&gt;Precrisis Energy Transition Plans&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the decade before Russia’s invasion, European energy policy prioritized the energy transition over energy security considerations. In 2019, the European Commission unveiled the European Green Deal, organized around the goal of climate neutrality by 2050. The new climate strategy sought to transform the European Union into a “modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementation of the Green Deal’s ambitious climate objectives in the energy sector took the form of the Fit for 55 package presented by the European Commission in July 2021. The package translated into law the Green Deal’s goal of reducing EU-wide emissions by 55 percent by 2030. This package increased renewable energy targets, approved the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, and expanded the scope of the EU Emissions Trading System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conspicuously missing were provisions advancing energy security. Arriving just prior to the start of the crisis, these policies effectively demonstrated the EU policymaking community’s underweighting of energy security in favor of the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEBATES OVER NUCLEAR, GAS, AND COAL: PHASEOUTS AND GREEN TAXONOMY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electricity-generation resource mix naturally impacts policy considerations in both climate and energy security. However, precrisis European policy debates on the subject primarily revolved around climate. Policymakers generally favored renewable energy expansion in the form of wind and solar as the primary locus for energy investment and as the primary vehicle for Europe’s green transition. Implicit in this model was a large, albeit eventually declining, role for natural gas as a balancing resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the first half of 2021, as Russia was laying the groundwork for its invasion, European energy policymakers were engaged in a fierce political debate over the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities. This labeling system, commonly referred to as the “green taxonomy,” guides investors toward economic activities that are compatible with EU climate goals. Such labels are significant given that the European Union intends to mobilize at least €1 trillion in public and private sustainable investments over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many member states were staunchly opposed to nuclear power’s inclusion in the green taxonomy despite its zero-emissions profile. Austria and Luxembourg threatened legal action to block the commission’s proposal to include nuclear power. The German governing coalition was fractured on the issue: the Greens pushed heavily to reject nuclear power and sought to follow Austria’s example by also filing suit. The antinuclear position was opposed by France and other states heavily reliant on nuclear power. Meanwhile, Germany was keen to include natural gas in the taxonomy given the heavy role it plays in its energy system at present and over the long term as a balancing resource in a renewables-heavy grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This debate revealed that much of Europe, with German policymakers at the head of this coalition, did not value the ability of nuclear power to provide firm (nonintermittent) carbon-free electricity in place of natural gas–fired generation. It was believed that a renewables-heavy mix paired with natural gas was the optimal system design for Europe and did not consider the security and economic risks of reliance on Russia to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, well into the energy crisis, the European Parliament backed the inclusion of investments in gas and nuclear power plants in the green taxonomy. In the case of gas, this inclusion was predicated on quite strict emissions intensity standards and low- or no-carbon fuel (e.g., hydrogen) readiness. The move was widely seen as an attempt to placate both Germany’s attachment to natural gas as a transition technology and France’s view that nuclear should be classified as a green technology. In the end, no legal moves were taken to block this settlement; only a minority of countries, including Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, and Spain, voiced criticism at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The green taxonomy debate highlights the deep division in Europe over the role of nuclear power despite its emissions-free profile. In the years preceding the energy crisis, many member states laid out plans to phase out or reduce the share of nuclear energy in their electricity mix, with some even imposing bans on new nuclear generation. Broadly, precrisis Europe saw a limited role for nuclear power in the energy transition. Most notable, of course, was Germany’s long-running commitment to eliminate all nuclear power. Even France, the continent’s leader on nuclear energy, had been considering a cap on the contribution of nuclear energy to its electricity supply, a policy that would lead to early plant retirements and effectively stunt the build-out of new reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal-fired power, once the starting point for European integration, was broadly expected to be phased out of the European energy system. The Green Deal’s renewables deployment targets, coupled with the bloc’s price on carbon and tightening pollution regulations, have exerted economic pressure on coal power plants, forcing many to shut down. At the EU level, there are no direct mandates to phase out coal consumption, although many member states have established their own timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of June 2024, a total of 23 countries had announced their intent to phase out coal — with four of them (Austria, Belgium, Portugal, and Sweden) achieving the phaseout. France expected to see all of its coal plants close by the end of 2022, barring a loophole that would have allowed coal plants to burn a mix of coal and biomass to stay online. While 12 countries aimed to be coal-free before 2030, another seven countries had set their goals to phase out coal after 2030. The least ambitious targets were set by Bulgaria, which aimed to exit coal between 2038 and 2040, and Germany. Berlin’s goal of a coal exit by 2038 has been heavily criticized as “too weak” and deemed incompatible with the Paris Agreement by German civil society groups. In July 2021, Germany’s supreme court ruled that the government would have to strengthen its 2030 climate targets — including its coal exit — by the end of 2022. A few months after the ruling, the ascendant ruling coalition released a proposal to bring forward Germany’s coal exit to 2030. At the other end of the spectrum, some European countries (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Poland, Serbia, and Turkey) have not entertained a coal phaseout target at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preinvasion-gas-market-disruptions&quot;&gt;Preinvasion Gas Market Disruptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European energy crisis began in August 2021 with the first signs of Russian manipulation of natural gas. In August, Gazprom dramatically cut gas flows through the Yamal pipeline, which runs through Belarus and Poland, ostensibly due to a fire at a gas processing facility in western Siberia. Through 2021, Gazprom’s deliveries of natural gas remained at minimum levels despite the recovery of both gas demand and prices in the European Union following the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In another example of targeted supply restrictions, Gazprom booked only 4 percent of the additional guaranteed transit capacity Ukraine offered for September. With a return of healthy demand for gas, these supply limitations sent prices surging across European gas markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of its long-term contracts and its traditional role as a low-cost swing supplier allowed Gazprom to effectively manipulate the European gas market. Gazprom contracts were usually governed by a take-or-pay clause, which ensured very high compensation to the seller from the buyer if gas deliveries were not accepted as set out in the long-term agreement. These contracts offered both buyer and supplier a degree of discretion in the total volumes to be delivered, allowing a percentage of gas supplies to be adjusted according to circumstances, mainly demand and price outlooks. As the Covid-19 crisis faded in 2021, Russia consistently delivered the minimum volumes allowed in the long-term contracts, a legal maneuver that reduced supplies throughout the European Union and forced procurement from higher-priced import sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The throttling of gas flows into Europe through 2021 left analysts perplexed. A CNBC story from August 2021 ran with the headline “Russia Is Pumping A Lot Less Natural Gas to Europe All of Sudden — and It Is Not Clear Why.” Tom Marzec-Manser, the lead European gas analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, hypothesized that Russia was applying pressure on Europe to certify the Nord Stream 2 pipeline: “Gazprom is readying itself for starting Nord Stream 2 and it is hoping to exert an element of leverage in terms of trying to make sure that when all the regulatory t’s get crossed and i’s get dotted, that that process is as swift as possible. . . . If there is less gas around than normal and the price is high then it may streamline that process.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The German government also saw little reason for concern. A now declassified October 2021 top-secret security assessment of Nord Stream 2 by the German government found little risk of certifying the pipeline: “Overall, the assessment comes to the conclusion that the granting of certification [for Nord Stream 2] does not jeopardize the security of gas supply in Germany and the European Union.” It added that “for both the German and neighboring markets, the risk of serious impairments to supply security due to the failure of individual import supply infrastructures is very limited.” When assessing the chance that flows from the pipeline could give Russia leverage, it found that “gas deliveries from the Soviet Union and later from Russia to Germany have been reliable and contractual for decades, even in times of political tension.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gazprom initially claimed that the reduction in deliveries was due to technical reasons associated with drilling well closures sourced from the period of lower demand during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the systematic emptying of Gazprom-controlled gas storage facilities in Europe was, in retrospect, likely part of a geo-economic coercion strategy to prepare for the invasion of Ukraine. By exporting the minimum quantity of gas permitted by long-term contracts and suspending sales on the spot market, Russia placed the European market under significant duress, resulting in record-high pricing in August 2021. Furthermore, the natural gas price differential between the U.S. Henry Hub index and the European TTF index had already reached record highs (see Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2021, U.S. intelligence agencies sounded the alarm that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent. Russia had moved significant forces and sophisticated weaponry near its border with Ukraine. American analysts cited by the New York Times suggested that Putin saw the coming months as a unique window of opportunity, with rising gas prices making Europe more dependent on cheap Russian supplies and Merkel’s imminent departure from the chancellorship limiting the future pressure on Ukraine to make concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-invades&quot;&gt;Russia Invades&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 initiated the worst security crisis in Europe since World War II and indicated that the unusual gas market developments of 2021 were not merely due to commercial or engineering causes. The invasion caused a major economic and political upheaval in European capitals and elevated the security of Europe’s energy supply to the top of the political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just days after the invasion, German chancellor Olaf Scholz gave his now famous Zeitenwende speech, which not only called for a massive increase in German military spending but also suspended the certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipelines. Additionally, the United States and European Union responded quickly with surprisingly robust sanctions, which included the dramatic step of freezing Russian assets in the global financial system. In June 2022, the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs Task Force, comprising top finance and justice officials from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Commission, announced it had blocked $30 billion in assets belonging to Russian oligarchs and officials and immobilized $300 billion owned by the Russian central bank. Notably, no sanctions on Russian energy imports were included. Furthermore, Russian gas continued to flow into Europe via Nord Stream 1 and other pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the absence of energy market sanctions, the market feared that sanctions would come, and forward gas and power prices soared on March 7. Seeking to ease market impacts, European leaders quickly downplayed the likelihood of such a sanctions package. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte noted that cutting off Russian oil and gas supplies would be unsustainable for EU member states “because we need the supply and that is the uncomfortable truth.” Chancellor Scholz also vigorously pushed back on calls to ban imports of Russian gas and oil. While Berlin agreed to halt the Nord Stream 2 project following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Scholz emphasized that importing energy from Russia was an economic necessity. In a statement, the German leader noted, “At the moment, Europe’s supply of energy for heat generation, mobility, power supply and industry cannot be secured in any other way. It is therefore of essential importance for the provision of public services and the daily lives of our citizens.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Social Democratic Party’s junior coalition partner, the Green Party, supported Scholz’s position. In other words, fears of widespread economic calamity among many of Europe’s most powerful countries resulted in a cautious approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One quickly emergent issue for European policymakers was the difficulty in correctly assessing the impact of the crisis due to a lack of Europe-wide data. As Bruegel found, “Technical questions on the EU’s ability to survive without Russian natural gas and oil were clouded by an absence of data on the volumes and routes through which Russian fossil fuels were entering the EU.” European businesses were also sounding the alarm. A report from the Kiel Institute predicted a “sharp recession” if Germany were to cut itself off from Russian gas. German businesses reacted with horror at the prospect of a potential European embargo on Russian fossil fuels. At the end of March 2022, the head of German chemicals giant BASF asked rhetorically, “Do we knowingly want to destroy our entire economy?” There was a prevailing sense that the German economy might suffer a dramatic economic contraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several economists disputed these concerns in a prominent paper produced in the weeks after the invasion. They concluded that ending European purchases of Russian energy would entail “substantial but manageable” economic cost for the German economy. This assessment was prescient, as Russian pipeline gas flows would dramatically decline that summer due to sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. In a retrospective analysis, two of the original authors, Benjamin Moll and Moritz Schularick, and Bruegel senior fellow Georg Zachmann concluded, “The German economy successfully adapted to the cut-off of natural gas from Russia last year, suggesting that Germany could have moved more swiftly to sanction Russia after it invaded Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States was also wary of energy sanctions. A total embargo on Russian oil exports would likely lead to a surge in global oil prices, drive U.S. domestic gasoline prices up, and accelerate the inflationary pressure hampering the global economy. There was also clear concern among certain Central and Eastern European states, whose energy infrastructure was less integrated with their European neighbors and therefore more dependent on Russian energy. For example, when EU import bans on Russian coal, seaborne crude oil shipments, and refined oil products eventually went into effect in August 2022, December 2022, and February 2023, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia secured exemptions to certain oil products. Without these exemptions, reaching consensus at the European Union, which is required for sanctions, would have been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the European Union ended up passing two sanctions packages on February 23 and February 25, 2022, which focused on limiting technology transfers and disrupting the Russian financial system but did not directly target imports of Russian fossil fuels. The rationale behind these sanctions was to limit Russia’s access to funds derived from hydrocarbon sales while maintaining its supply to the European Union in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, the Kremlin announced in March 2022 that hostile countries would have to pay for gas in rubles in a two-phase payment system (euros and rubles) using Gazprombank. The European Commission opted for flexibility, allowing European companies to choose between continuing with their long-term contracts using this new mechanism or unilaterally rescinding them. As a result, many European utilities suspended their contracts, provoking a decrease in gas flows from Russia. In particular, Poland and Bulgaria refused to pay for imports in rubles, leading to the closure of the Yamal gas pipeline running through Poland to Germany and ceasing Russian exports of gas to Bulgaria, which was particularly dependent on Russian supplies. The Bulgarian economy was especially exposed to the energy shock given its heavy reliance on fossil fuels — specifically, coal for electricity generation and crude oil products for transportation. After the state-owned domestic gas supplier Bulgargaz refused to accept a rubles-based payment scheme, Gazprom unilaterally suspended deliveries in April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the summer of 2022, Gazprom increased its pressure on the EU gas market, intermittently reducing flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Again, Gazprom gave cover explanations, this time stating that technical disruptions to key equipment repairs were due to Western sanctions. By June, surging energy prices (Figure 4) were beginning to cause a cost-of-living crisis affecting people and businesses across the European Union. The economic impacts placed political pressure on European leaders. In a televised interview marking Bastille Day, French president Emmanuel Macron warned his constituents to prepare for a complete cutoff of Russian natural gas, advanced initiatives to diversify the French energy mix, and spoke of a national “sobriety plan” to conserve energy. German economy and climate minister Robert Habeck said in June 2022, “It’s a tense, serious situation. . . . It must be acknowledged that Putin is reducing the gas supply to Europe bit by bit, also to drive up the price, and we must respond with our measures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NORD STREAM SABOTAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 26, 2022, two underwater explosions damaged three of the four pipelines that constituted the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines off the Danish island of Bornholm (the latter was completed in 2021 but was not in operation). The sabotage, whose perpetrators have not yet been identified, left the infrastructure inoperable, closing the main gas supply line between Russia and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of evidence warranting conclusive attribution, two schools of thought have emerged pointing to either Russian- or Ukrainian-backed groups as the perpetrators. The circumstantial evidence in the immediate aftermath pointed toward the Kremlin. Russia’s Baltic fleet, capable of deploying divers and miniature submarines, is based in Kaliningrad, just 300 kilometers from the sabotaged pipelines. The incident occurred a day before a new pipeline was completed to connect Poland with Norwegian gas via Denmark in an effort to reduce Warsaw’s reliance on Russian gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another narrative that subsequently gained traction centers on Ukrainian involvement. Ukraine has carried out a number of dramatic intelligence operations since the war began, some of which have roiled Ukraine’s backers, such as the assassination of Russian television commentator Daria Dugina. Kyiv, which long opposed the pipelines, may have feared Russia could successfully blackmail Germany and others to reduce their support for Ukraine. In March 2023, German media carried a report that German police had traced a yacht thought to have been used to transport explosives to the sabotage site to two Ukrainian nationals. These reports aligned with New York Times reporting that U.S. intelligence officials suspected involvement by renegade pro-Ukrainian groups. Although German authorities are still investigating the explosions, Denmark’s and Sweden’s public prosecutors closed their inquiries into the explosions in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoever was responsible, the attack eliminated Russian gas flows to Germany, led to sharp increases in energy prices, and firmly demonstrated that Europe’s energy links to Russia could not be isolated from the broader geopolitical conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-perfect-storm-overlapping-crises-in-electricity-markets&quot;&gt;The Perfect Storm: Overlapping Crises in Electricity Markets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis in the European natural gas sector intersected with two incidental factors — a severe continental drought and the poor performance of the French nuclear fleet — to cause a matching crisis in the European electricity sector. Electricity markets saw prices reach historic levels, which devastated consumers, destabilized energy companies, and raised serious resource adequacy concerns. Heading into the winter of 2022–23, system planners and political leadership publicly warned of the risk of load shedding, a process by which consumers are intermittently disconnected to preserve overall system stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DROUGHT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, severe drought, characterized as the worst in 500 years, simultaneously affected the Mediterranean basin, Central Europe, and the Nordic countries. Lack of rainfall severely reduced the generation output of many hydroelectric dams, which represent roughly 16 percent of total European generation capacity. In 2021, these generation assets produced 805 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, representing 17 percent of all production; only gas-fired generation (26 percent) and nuclear-fired generation (23 percent) contributed a larger share. Drought conditions in 2022 caused hydroelectric generation to fall 15 percent year over year to only 687 TWh, the lowest level since 2011, despite the very strong financial incentive of record-breaking spot prices to produce at maximum capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drought further affected the electricity sector by reducing water levels in European rivers. The conditions restricted navigability by barge and, in some cases, interrupted delivery of fuel to coal-fired power plants on the Rhine, taking additional generation capacity out of the system. In France, low water levels caused restrictions on the discharge of cooling water by nuclear power plants, causing Électricité de France (EDF), the French nuclear operator, to take plants offline or reduce output. Eventually, this problem was partially mitigated when the relevant environmental agency granted waivers at the government’s behest on the basis of public necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FRENCH NUCLEAR OUTAGES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France possesses the largest nuclear power fleet in Europe by a wide margin: 61 gigawatts (GW) of production capacity spread out over 56 reactors, dwarfing the next-largest fleets in Ukraine (14 GW) and the United Kingdom (8 GW). This fleet typically supplies over 70 percent of France’s electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As gas and electric prices surged through early 2022, the French nuclear fleet was rocked by the discovery of widespread stress corrosion cracking. Problems similar to those initially identified at a single plant were soon discovered at numerous others, forcing EDF to take several plants offline. These events coincided with prescheduled and unavoidable 10-year maintenance outages. In total, an unprecedented number of nuclear reactors were taken offline just when the French and broader European electric grid needed them most. The nadir of French nuclear output occurred in July–August 2022, when only 18 TWh was generated out of a possible 45 TWh, a 40 percent capacity utilization rate. On an annual basis, 2022 was the worst performance in decades, with output falling over 22 percent versus 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DzEkdwk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although France typically exported electricity to its neighbors, the combination of drought and nuclear outages made it a net importer of electricity for the first time in 42 years. Rather than support supply deficits in neighboring nations such as Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom, it drew on power from these nations, exacerbating supply shortages and high prices in those countries. However, this result demonstrated the value of an integrated electricity system linked both physically with transmission capacity and commercially with liquid and dynamic market mechanisms. Such integration allows the sharing of generation resources, which improves overall system reliability and brings down the cost of achieving that reliability. Without this integration, France would likely have been forced into economically and socially painful cuts to electricity in the summer of 2022 and winter of 2022–23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HISTORIC PRICE VOLATILITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices in the European electricity market reached record highs through 2022. Drought and nuclear outages knocked low-priced baseload capacity out of the supply stack. The crisis in the gas market meant gas-fired generation capacity struggled to secure fuel. Plants that could secure fuel did so at exorbitant prices, which meant that the electricity they produced was offered on electricity markets at a steep premium. Additionally, carbon dioxide prices in the EU Emissions Trading System market traded to historic highs, reaching a peak of €100 per ton equivalent in February 2023. Higher carbon dioxide costs borne by fossil-fired generation (i.e., coal and gas) likewise translated into higher prices offered in electricity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hxdMSMN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7: France Becomes Net Importer of Electricity between 2021 and 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/european-electricity-review-2023/#supporting-material&quot;&gt;Dave Jones et al., European Electricity Review 2023 (London: Ember, January 2023)&lt;/a&gt;. Reproduced under CC-BY-SA 4.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of electricity markets is crucial for understanding how these factors translate into higher electricity prices. Electricity markets are settled on the margin: Generators offer their electricity into the market and are dispatched to meet demand in order of lowest to highest offer price, a process called merit order dispatch. The offer price of the last unit dispatched, the marginal unit, is the price received by all generators (supply) and the price paid by all buyers (demand). This price formation model is used in all restructured electricity markets around the world, most notably in U.S. electricity markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe has made substantial progress on deploying renewables that produce electricity at zero marginal cost and are therefore first in merit order dispatch. However, demand levels almost always reach beyond the generation output of renewables, causing merit order dispatch to move deeper into the supply stack and dispatch fossil-fired generation to balance supply with demand. Renewables are therefore rarely the marginal unit and therefore rarely set the market-clearing spot price. Nonetheless, they play a key role in reducing overall system costs by reducing how often and deep the market must go into the supply of high-priced fossil-fired generation to reach equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With large volumes of low-cost hydropower (first to be dispatched in the supply stack) and nuclear power out of the supply mix, gas-fired generation units priced at steep premiums set the margin in almost every country. Through this mechanism, the historically high price of natural gas translated directly into historically high prices for electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/elBhTVa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years before the crisis, average annual wholesale prices for most European countries were generally €30–€50 per megawatt-hour (MWh). By early 2022, electricity prices, tracking the movement in gas prices, had reached monthly averages of over €200 per MWh in most countries. Pricing surged higher through the summer as the combined effect of nuclear and hydroelectric underperformance drove increasing reliance on extremely high-priced gas generation. Increased power burn — or gas consumed by power plants to produce electricity — intensified pricing pressure in the gas market as buyers sought to fill gas storage facilities for the upcoming winter. This drove gas prices, and by extension electricity prices, ever higher through the summer. Peak pricing occurred in August, with most countries averaging well over €400 per MWh. Italy fared the worst, with a monthly average of €543 per MWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yearly averages for 2022 for most countries settled at triple the typical annual average of the recent past or more. The impact of such pricing on households, businesses, and the overall economy is enormous. A rough estimate serves to demonstrate the scale: In 2022, Germany consumed 540 TWh of electricity priced at an annual average price of €237 per MWh, representing an annual spend of €128 billion. Priced against the preceding five-year average of €35 per MWh, the same demand results in an annual spend of only €19 billion. Despite the introduction of various subsidy mechanisms, Greece’s electricity prices also spiked by 40 percent for industries and 24 percent for households in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gaj7JME.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magnitude of extreme pricing was not uniform. Nordic countries fared better because their power mixes relied less heavily on natural gas in favor of hydro and nuclear generation. Poland likewise has relatively low reliance on natural gas in favor of heavy reliance on coal-fired power. Portugal and Spain were notable exceptions because they introduced a gas price-capping mechanism, known as the Iberian exception, which the European Commission approved after tough discussions. This gas price cap limited the price of natural gas used for electricity generation to €40 per MWh, with the government compensating gas-fired power plants for the difference, thus successfully lowering overall electricity prices for consumers during 2022, despite indirectly increasing Spain’s gas consumption for power generation and, especially, electricity exports to France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European electricity demand historically peaks through the winter months. The winter of 2022–23 posed a worrisome risk for the overall reliability of the electric power system, and officials within the European Union, national governments, and grid operators all issued warnings on the risk of load shedding or, far worse, uncontrolled blackouts. One area where Europe was fortunate is that both the winters of 2022–23 and 2023–24 were relatively mild, enabling lower energy usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;energy-market-interventions&quot;&gt;Energy Market Interventions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imports of Russian gas into the European Union fell precipitously from 150 bcm in 2021 to 78 bcm in 2022 and then again to 42 bcm in 2023. To enable and respond to these changes in fuel imports, EU member states took a wide range of steps to enhance domestic energy supply capacities and seek alternatives to Russian imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS BRIEFLY TURN TO OLD COAL POWER PLANTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis led to a temporary reactivation of coal-fired power plants to provide resource diversity and additional capacity given that gas combined-cycle plants were heavily fuel constrained. According to a report by Ember, an estimated 13.5 GW of coal-fired plants were reactivated from recent retirement or otherwise placed on standby in supply reserve facilities, increasing the EU coal fleet by 12 percent. These units contributed to increased coal burning through the crisis. For the first time since 2015, coal-fired generation output increased year over year in 2021 and again in 2022, reaching 448 TWh compared to 352 TWh of output in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, due to fortuitous winter weather outcomes and effective policy intervention at the EU and national levels in other areas, these reactivated plants saw relatively marginal utilization. By the spring of 2023, the European Union had experienced an overstock of coal in its ports, which was resold to Asia and other emerging markets. In 2023, coal-fired power generation fell relative to 2022 and returned to its long-term pattern of decline and a new EU-era low of 335 TWh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS SEEK TO PRESERVE THEIR NUCLEAR POWER GENERATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with coal generation, the energy crisis forced policymakers to revisit nuclear power policy. In the short term, postponing imminent reactor shutdowns was an option for policymakers. In January 2023, Belgium opted to extend the life of two nuclear reactors slated to close in 2025 by 10 years, until 2035. In Germany, considerable debate over the status of three recently shuttered nuclear reactors and three others in operation but scheduled for closure did not ultimately lead to policy changes. In April 2023, Germany took its last three remaining nuclear power plants offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crisis impacts on the nuclear power sector will likely play out over the long term as countries plan investments that shape the overall direction of their generation resource mix. French nuclear policy is demonstrative. Precrisis plans proposed phasing down nuclear power’s contribution to the overall electricity mix from over 70 percent to below 50 percent — a policy that effectively eliminates new plant builds. Postcrisis French policy has inverted the 50 percent target from an upward limit to a minimum threshold, and the government has announced plans for a new reactor-building campaign. France has also organized a coalition of European countries interested in pursuing expanded nuclear power generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, nuclear power accounts for about a quarter of European energy, with about half of that coming from France. At present, France and Slovakia are the only European countries with nuclear reactors currently under construction. In March, Belgium hosted a Nuclear Energy Summit with 30 countries, a sign of the newfound political interest in nuclear power. Poland signed a $40 billion agreement with U.S. companies to construct two nuclear power plants, with three reactors each, the first opening in 2033. Polish and South Korean companies have also agreed to build additional nuclear plants in Poland. The Czech Republic is advancing plans to construct multiple new reactors for delivery in the mid-2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NORWEGIAN GAS STEPS UP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Norwegian piped gas flows into the European Union increased about 8 percent year over year. In 2023, Norway provided 109 bcm of natural gas from the Norwegian continental shelf to Europe. In December 2023, Norwegian gas deliveries provided 11.1 bcm (121.7 TWh) in one month, the largest amount ever provided to Europe in a single month. Norway now provides approximately 30 percent of EU natural gas and has become the largest EU gas supplier, with the United States second at approximately 19 percent. Norway has also replaced Russia’s leading role in providing gas to Germany. In 2021, Norway provided under 20 percent of Germany’s natural gas; in 2023, that figure stood at 48 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the European Union, Norway is a far more secure partner. Although Norway is not a member of the European Union, it is part of the European single market. Further, Norway is a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and is deeply embedded in the transatlantic efforts to counter Russian aggression. Substituting Russia for Norway as Europe’s dominant supplier indicates a significant improvement in European energy security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precrisis preference for Russian gas was based on price. Thus, the improvement in energy security comes at a cost, as Norwegian gas is structurally more expensive. The new equilibrium is therefore not without its detractors. Some European commentators have accused Norway of profiting off of the war and Europe’s economic pain. Europe’s newfound dependence on Norway and the Norwegian energy giant Equinor has created some market concern that any disruption, such as from maintenance needs, would lead to price spikes. As a Bloomberg report surmises, “So long as the bloc continues to depend heavily on fossil fuels, Norwegian hydrocarbons will be essential to keeping the lights on in Europe.” Other suppliers of piped gas, such as Algeria and Azerbaijan, have not seen a comparably significant increase in supply to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vi9tHk5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most surprising is a lack of concerted effort to increase Europe’s domestic gas production. Despite the ongoing crisis of gas supply and price, domestic gas production within the European Union has continued its downward trajectory. Between 2016 and 2023, EU gas production more than halved, primarily due to the natural depletion of fields and challenges related to political and social acceptance. Since the invasion of Ukraine, natural gas production in the European Union has experienced a significant decline of approximately 13 percent due to the May 2024 closure of the Dutch gas field in Groningen, the bloc’s major gas source. One positive indicator for supply is in Romania, which foresees a rise in gas production thanks to upcoming projects in the Black Sea. Denmark’s gas output is also expected to receive a boost with the delayed return of the Tyra field in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPE TURNS TO LNG, PARTICULARLY FROM THE UNITED STATES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary focus of transatlantic cooperation has been securing LNG volumes for Europe. A March 2022 U.S.-EU announcement featured prominent commitments by the United States to expand LNG exports to Europe to at least 50 bcm per year by 2030. The agreement started with a goal of achieving 15 bcm of increased exports in 2022, a target that was swiftly met and surpassed by September of that year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surge in U.S. LNG exports to Europe is stunning. In 2021, total U.S. LNG exports to Europe stood at 29 bcm; 2022 saw exports more than double to 70 bcm. These flows played a critical role for Europe as it sought to replace lost Russian pipeline volumes. In total, U.S. LNG grew to 15 percent of all EU gas imports in 2022. Policymakers and officials on both sides of the Atlantic have touted this result as a demonstration of the ongoing strategic partnership between Europe and the United States. In June 2022, in a joint statement on European energy security, President Biden and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, “While Russia has cut supplies of natural gas to several EU Member States, the United States and other producers have stepped up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In remarks at the North American Gas Forum in October 2023, U.S. assistant secretary for energy resources Geoffrey R. Pyatt noted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I travel around the world, especially in Europe, the message I always hear is hurray for American LNG producers. There is great appreciation for the role that American producers have played, especially in this period of Russia-caused disruption. From a strategic and foreign policy standpoint it’s a good thing that our export capacity, our liquefaction capacity is going to grow as much as it is over the next couple of years as we look out towards 2025, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lines of communication and coordination afforded by the task force were crucial in enabling ad hoc diplomatic efforts on energy matters. A notable example of this occurred in February 2022 when Japan agreed to divert LNG cargoes to Europe following determined diplomatic engagement with U.S. and EU officials. However, much of the result was independent of direct government action. The United States has no institutional mechanisms by which to direct LNG exports to specific markets, countries, or customers. Instead, decisions on long-term investment, production, and export destinations are market-informed and taken by private companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reduction and then abrupt cutoff in Russian pipeline volumes were, in effect, an exogenous, outward shift in the LNG demand curve and have resulted in a new, far higher equilibrium point for European LNG prices. This created the price signal, as reflected by the historic highs of the TTF European gas price index, for firms to redirect LNG shipments to the European market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. LNG export industry possesses unique flexibility to respond to price relative to the rest of the global LNG market. Most U.S. export volumes are sold through a free-on-board contract model that gives buyers ownership of cargoes at the export terminal and offers destination flexibility. This leaves buyers free to send cargo wherever they wish based on commercial considerations — typically the market that can command the highest price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These contracting structures have facilitated a shift from long-term point-to-point contracts toward a “portfolio player” model in which firms buy up a large pool of contracts for their own procurement needs and resell to whatever market commands the highest premiums. Portfolio players make up a growing share of U.S. supply deals and have played a key role in shifting LNG volumes to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortuitous market conditions have also created spare capacity and have made redirection of LNG volumes to Europe feasible. In China, slowed economic growth and Covid-19-related restrictions reduced energy demand, driving LNG imports 20 percent lower year over year and thereby freeing up over 20 bcm of LNG for other destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dramatic shift of volumes away from Asia to Europe highlights how the European energy crisis cascaded effects globally. From the global perspective, successful transatlantic partnerships to redirect LNG volumes are viewed less positively. The primary Asian gas price index, JKM, effectively traded at parity with the TTF European gas price index throughout the energy crisis (see Figure 4). Many Asian buyers of LNG, both private and government buyers, were exposed to price volatility and energy insecurity sourced ultimately from the European crisis. Lower-income countries such as Pakistan suffered from energy shortages even as Europe largely succeeded in averting such shortages. These outcomes undoubtedly have consequences for future energy strategy and wider geopolitical developments in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LNG Infrastructure Construction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most relevant measures to substitute Russian gas is the construction of new LNG terminals. The majority of these projects have involved the rapid and cost-effective construction of new floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs), totaling 16 projects, in addition to the expansions of 11 existing LNG terminals. Germany did not have any LNG terminals when the war erupted; it pushed through FSRU permitting and “onshore connections in record time,” with the first FSRU coming online in December 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NIlLxAC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 14: Existing and Planned EU LNG Infrastructure, 2021–27.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieefa.org/european-lng-tracker&quot;&gt;“European LNG Tracker,” Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, February 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rise in LNG imports positioned the European Union as the world’s largest LNG importer in 2023, ahead of other traditionally bigger importers such as China and Japan. One of the fears of this rapid development of LNG terminals is the risk of building overcapacity that is eventually not used, as happened on the Iberian Peninsula in recent decades. The disparity between Europe’s LNG capacity and demand is widening in a context of significant infrastructure expansions and LNG imports plateauing since late 2022. The utilization rate of Europe’s LNG terminals averaged 58 percent in early 2023, prompting questions about the necessity of further infrastructure expansion, projected until 2027. However, as noted by the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, around 80 percent of capacity additions between 2022 and 2024 were FSRUs, which allow for the repurposing or relocation of floating infrastructure at a reasonable cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are plans to establish four onshore conventional plants, with construction timelines scheduled between 2023 and 2027. Germany has been the main player in this expansion following the approval in record time of the LNG Acceleration Act, which involves the federal government in infrastructure development. This approach has marked a significant departure from prior policies, with the state actively engaging in project implementation, including direct involvement in financing and operational oversight. Most operators of the new Germany LNG plants are expected to switch to climate-neutral hydrogen by 2044 at the latest. But the exact timing, techno-economic feasibility, and adherence to these timetables remain to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qcy9fd0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Croatia, Greece, and Italy have also been very active in the construction and expansion of new LNG terminals and hope to serve as a gateway for gas to neighboring landlocked countries such as Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia. Two infrastructure initiatives stand out. First, the Vertical Corridor, presented in January 2024, will make it possible to transport natural gas from Greece and Bulgaria to Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. The pipeline is expected to extend to Moldova and underground storage facilities in Ukraine, increasing natural gas import and storage options for one of Gazprom’s remaining export markets in Europe. Both Greek and EU subsidies have enabled the construction of pipelines that span the country and connect to a new import terminal that will provide Central and Eastern Europe with gas for decades to come. Greece’s ambition to become a key European LNG import hub has been aided by forceful lobbying efforts from U.S. officials for European nations to use Greece’s new terminal and pipelines. Second, the Adriatica pipeline will allow Italy to reconfigure its gas flows, traditionally designed to go in a north-south direction. With this improved transmission network, Italy will be able to export gas entering from the south (i.e., from Algeria, Azerbaijan, and Libya), in addition to exporting LNG to northern neighbors, especially Austria and, subsequently, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPE DRAMATICALLY CURTAILS DEMAND&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the significant supply-side shocks, natural gas demand in the European Union declined by 55 bcm, or 13 percent, in 2022 — the steepest year-over-year fall in history. By March 2024, gas consumption in the European Union had decreased by 24 percent compared to March 2021. There was a robust public campaign to save electricity, encouraging Europeans to turn down thermostats, take shorter showers, and turn off nonessential lighting. The lights on the Eiffel Tower, for instance, were turned off at night. These efforts had considerable impact, as EU-wide electricity demand declined by 3.4 percent in 2023 compared to 2022 and was 6.4 percent lower than its pre-crisis level in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest decline in natural gas use was among the three main consumers: EU households to generate heat, the energy sector to generate electricity, and the industrial sector to manufacture final products such as ammonia, fuels, ceramics, and paper. Although gas demand in the electricity sector temporarily increased during 2022 due to the decline in nuclear and hydroelectric power, this trend reversed in 2023 thanks to a significant increase in renewables, lower electricity consumption, and improved nuclear and hydro output. The buildings sector experienced a reduction of almost 20 percent in the winters of 2022 and 2023, attributed to milder weather, behavioral changes in response to high prices, increased fuel poverty, efficiency improvements, and record heat pump installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the industrial sector, gas consumption has fallen by around 25 percent between 2021 and 2022, mainly due to reduced production and, to a lesser extent, fuel switching. Some factors, such as price-sensitive fuel switching in the refining sector or weather effects, are expected to be temporary. Others, such as increased renewable capacity, improved efficiency, the adoption of heat pumps, and permanent industrial plant closures, are structural and lead to lasting, sometimes undesired reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RENEWABLES DRAMATICALLY EXPAND AND INCREASE EUROPE’S RESILIENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s expansion of renewables prior to the crisis helped reduce the impact of the crisis and gave Europe greater energy resilience. Renewable energy played a considerable role in meeting shortfalls in the electricity sector from lower hydroelectric and nuclear output. Renewables output increased by 80 TWh year over year in 2022 and another 87 TWh in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, wind and solar represented 22 percent of EU electricity generation, overtaking natural gas for the first time. Solar capacity was rapidly deployed during the crisis, pushing installed capacity to 256 GW in 2023, a 56 percent increase versus 2021. Wind capacity also grew, albeit far slower than solar, even as the sector struggled with considerable supply chain and financial difficulties (Figure 16).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/n7LH8fw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 16: Rapid Renewables Deployment in the EU, 2018–23.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ember-climate.org/data/data-tools/data-explorer/&quot;&gt;“Electricity Data Explorer,” Ember Climate, June 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid deployment of renewables, primarily solar, has been fueled by record-high wholesale prices improving the financial attractiveness of renewables, by member state and commission efforts to ease permitting processes, and by the continuing fall in solar costs due to expanding Chinese solar manufacturing capacity. The development of distributed solar, especially rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems in households and businesses, has been one of the great social responses to the energy crisis, becoming a widespread phenomenon in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting aside trade challenges, the massive expansion of solar has created new internal challenges for electricity markets. In Germany, the expansion of solar has created price cannibalization “leading to destruction of solar hour prices and solar profitability,” a result that should lead to slower expansion, according to an SEB Research report. With installed solar capacity in Germany now over 82 GW, output on a typical sunny day far exceeds the average demand of roughly 52 GW. Spain is having a similar situation, where power is at times “almost free” due to solar production. For countries with deep solar penetration, the only conceivable path for continued expansion in the solar segment is matching investment in energy storage and transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biogas is a small, easily overlooked but significant area of renewable energy expansion. The anticipated increase in domestic biogas and biomethane production is projected to partially offset the decline in conventional gas production. Over the past decade and supported by generous subsidy packages, the European Union has witnessed a doubling in its production of biogas and biomethane, reaching approximately 19 bcm in 2022, which equates to around 6 percent of final EU gas consumption. The REPowerEU plan aims to achieve a combined volume of 35 bcm by 2030, nearly doubling current production levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EUROPEAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND MARKET INTEGRATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, European resilience has been greatly boosted by existing cross-border infrastructure networks and markets. Gaps in supply or infrastructure in one country can be offset by the capabilities of another — a result physically enabled by pipeline and electric transmission networks and commercially enabled by common market systems. For example, Germany did not possess any LNG import terminals until its first FSRU came online in December 2022. Before this, Germany was nonetheless able to access LNG supplies through shipments arriving at EU ports in countries such as the Netherlands. Europe benefited from the continued operation of infrastructure and markets because, on the whole, European countries refrained from hoarding energy, nationalizing energy supplies, or restricting outbound sales. This unity was matched on the demand side as Europeans collectively cut demand for gas and electricity in more or less similar ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We had some strong reserves in the form of gas which we could capitalize on. . . . We looked at how we could, first of all, handle our own needs and then how we could play a significant role in enabling neighboring countries to get out of this situation. . . . At the same time, renewables was where we doubled down.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-alexandros-paterakis-deputy-ceo-public-power-corporation-sa&quot;&gt;— Alexandros Paterakis, Deputy CEO, Public Power Corporation S.A.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was rapid movement to complete new interconnection projects, where possible, to create greater resilience. By May 2022, the Baltic states had enabled new interconnections with Poland. By September 2023, the Baltic Pipe was completed, connecting Poland to Norwegian gas supplies through Denmark, which was crucial for improving the energy security situation of the most exposed eastern EU members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;country-level-fiscal-and-regulatory-response&quot;&gt;Country-Level Fiscal and Regulatory Response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis and the increase in wholesale energy prices in Europe prompted governments to put in place measures to shield consumers from the direct impact of rising prices, protect strategic assets, and secure the energy supply. There were fears of a deep European recession as well as concerns about inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many European governments relied on fiscal spending to keep industries afloat and alleviate the costs to the public. According to a Bruegel report, the national fiscal policy responses to the energy crisis in the European Union reached €540 billion, of which €158 billion was earmarked by Germany alone. Separately, the United Kingdom provided €103 billion in fiscal support. The different fiscal capacities of member states within the European Union, both in terms of revenue levels and indebtedness, resulted in an overall unbalanced response that created tensions among member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank also found that the crisis contributed “to a deterioration in the current account balance of the euro area, from 2.2% of GDP in 2019 to –1.0% of GDP in 2022. Both deficit and surplus countries were affected.” This has limited Europe’s fiscal capacity to invest in defense, support Ukraine, and further fund the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these financial outlays demonstrate that European states had the fiscal and policymaking capacity to shield their economies from the worst effects of the crisis. As noted, both before the crisis and in the early stages, there was a widespread assumption that the loss of access to Russian natural gas would plunge the European Union into a deep recession. Some economists predicted a 10 percent decline in German output and the loss of 2–3 million jobs. Fiscal outlays, effective substitution to other energy suppliers, and demand reduction measures prevented a deep economic recession. Instead, as Moll, Schularick, and Zachmann concluded in a Brookings study in September 2023, “Overall, while the German economy is stagnating and faces substantial long-run headwinds, the direct economic costs of the end of Russian energy imports proved moderate and manageable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight other EU countries were more dependent on Russian energy than Germany in 2022, including Finland, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, and Slovakia Greece, for instance, spent about 5 percent of GDP, or about €10 billion, on energy support measures, with most of the funding directed at subsidizing household energy bills. Yet despite the price shock, Greece reduced its energy imports from Russia by more than 70 percent, much more than the EU average of 37 percent. Despite the costs and the price shock, industrial production grew by 2.3 percent in 2022, with the economy growing overall by nearly 6 percent. In the Netherlands, consumption of natural gas dropped by roughly 30 percent, but overall industrial output increased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the summer of 2021, European governments have implemented various policies aimed at alleviating the impact of rising prices on consumers and businesses, including temporary reductions in energy taxes for transport fuels, natural gas, and electricity; retail energy price caps; energy tariff regulations; and support programs for energy-intensive industries. Europe also experienced a wave of energy utility nationalization, including Russian-controlled companies such as Gazprom Germania (now SEFE) and those overly exposed to Russian energy supplies and market volatility and in need of a bailout, such as Uniper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Germany’s €200 billion aid package allowed large-scale consumers to apply for a gas block tariff and pay 70 percent of their gas use, calculated over the previous year’s consumption, at a subsidized cost of €0.70 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Additionally, governments made efforts to stabilize wholesale prices and ensure energy security by promoting energy savings and capping energy costs, particularly for wholesale electricity and gas. Some countries also attempted to reform energy markets, while windfall taxes targeted inframarginal power generators, crude refiners, and upstream producers in a temporary and exceptional manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries also implemented direct transfers, such as discounts at gas stations or vouchers — frequently for vulnerable households — often at high cost for a dubious return. One widespread practice, often by regional or local authorities, was to reduce public transport fares, encouraging the use of public transport instead of private vehicles as a fuel-saving measure. However, criticism arose due to the failure of many measures to specifically target vulnerable groups, instead focusing on mitigating social and political unrest. The prevalence of untargeted price-distorting measures contradicted the need to incentivize energy conservation and honor existing commitments to the energy transition and to curve fossil fuel subsidies. However, despite some of these measures, demand declined significantly in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the fiscal costs, the energy crisis further fueled inflation in Europe. The European Central Bank found that “high energy and commodity prices and supply bottlenecks have driven strong inflation in the euro area and higher inflation differentials between euro area countries.” Countries with greater dependence on Russian energy, such as Latvia, suffered inflation rates above 10 percent. Unlike the United States, where inflation was mainly demand driven, the supply shock in the European Union generated by the higher energy prices and the significant import dependency was responsible for the lion’s share of inflation in 2022–23. For example, headline inflation averaged 9.3 percent in Greece in 2022, driven largely by surging energy prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eu-policy-response&quot;&gt;EU Policy Response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine caught the European Union off guard. The EU institutions had largely focused on the climate dimensions of energy policy and not on the security of supply, which was seen as the responsibility of member states. Yet Russia’s invasion of Ukraine demanded a collective EU response. The European Union helped ensure a unified response and set direction for its member states, from creating collective agreement on the need to decouple from Russian energy to setting targets for demand reduction and ensuring that Europe would not abandon its climate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe demonstrated its unity in the Versailles declaration of March 11, 2022. Although the declaration was an informal and nonbinding document, it demonstrated the political will of European leaders to take a step forward and reinforce the bloc’s strategic autonomy, especially in three directions: bolstering defense capabilities, reducing energy dependencies, and building a more robust economic base. On the energy front, the declaration called on the European Commission to present REPowerEU, a plan to address the energy shock and ensure that the need to decouple from Russian energy would not undermine the climate ambitions embodied by the EU Green Deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REPowerEU, primarily a declaratory document of the European Commission, provides the states with the tools (e.g., budget and legislative mechanisms) to implement the proposals it contains. While some of the measures and targets set out in REPowerEU have subsequently been incorporated into the EU acquis (EU law), such as the 2030 renewable energy targets, others have been ignored or rendered obsolete, such as those related to imported renewable hydrogen. The REPowerEU budget was set at approximately €300 billion, with around 75 percent funded through loans from the Recovery and Resilience Facility (NextGenerationEU funds) and the remaining 25 percent coming from grants funded by the auctioning of additional Emissions Trading System allowances and other EU sources. Member states could access this funding by including REPowerEU measures in their national recovery and resilience plans, which the European Commission then evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REPowerEU outlined an ambitious strategy aimed at accelerating the deployment of renewable energy across power generation, industry, buildings, and transport sectors, and proposed raising the 2030 renewable energy target set under the Fit for 55 packages from 40 percent to 45 percent. These included a dedicated EU solar strategy to double solar PV capacity by 2025 and reach 600 GW by 2030, alongside the Solar Rooftops Initiative mandating installation of solar panels on new public, commercial, and residential buildings. REPowerEU also highlighted efforts to double the deployment rate of heat pumps, integrate geothermal and solar thermal energy into modernized heating systems, and streamline the permitting process for major renewable projects. Additionally, the commission aimed to establish a target of 20 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030, half of it to be imported, and launched a Biomethane Action Plan to boost production to 35 bcm by the same date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REPowerEU also catalyzed a legislative proposal to establish the minimum gas storage mandate. This storage mandate set the target for 80 percent filling by November 1, 2022, and 90 percent filling by subsequent winters. In addition, gas storage infrastructure is now considered critical infrastructure and is under scrutiny from EU authorities to avoid external interferences. The new gas storage regulation establishes coordinated gas refueling operations, including joint procurement, aggregation of orders and supplies, and optimization and improved transparency of gas infrastructure. REPowerEU proposed coordinated demand reduction strategies and a solidarity mechanism in the European Union in case of gas supply disruptions. It was accompanied by a recommendation for member states to take voluntary measures to maintain a collective reduction in gas demand of 15 percent, compared to average demand between April 2017 and March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the natural gas side, REPowerEU established a framework for collective procurement of non-Russian LNG, extending participation to all interested member states, as well as Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, and the Western Balkans. The idea behind this platform, which is already functioning, is to increase transparency in the EU gas market, complementing the existing hubs to bring as many gas consumers as possible closer to the wholesale market and attract new operators to the growing European LNG market. In particular, the platform hopes to increase the bargaining power of landlocked European countries, such as Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, in their process of energy diversification and access to import terminals in other member states. The European Union’s joint gas purchasing platform, AggregateEU, has shown some initial success in matching gas supply with demand, attracting significant participation from companies and suppliers in its first rounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, its overall effectiveness remains uncertain due to limited transparency on the contractual outcomes and prices achieved through the platform. While the initiative has facilitated connections between buyers and sellers, the added value over existing market mechanisms is questionable, as the current EU gas market already supports effective demand aggregation and access to LNG supplies for landlocked countries thanks to EU rules on third-party access to pipelines. Despite this, AggregateEU, originally designed as a temporary mechanism, is now a permanent facility incorporated into the EU gas and hydrogen package. Similar schemes are expected in the future to aggregate purchases of hydrogen and critical minerals at the EU level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transatlantic-cooperation&quot;&gt;Transatlantic Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the magnitude of the security and energy crisis Europe faced dawned on leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, they quickly initiated effective transatlantic cooperation on energy matters. Yet the energy dimension of the crisis meant that the United States needed to engage with the European Union as opposed to NATO. Relations between the United States and EU institutions have occasionally been fraught, and the United States has rarely prioritized them. Yet the crisis changed the dynamic, with the United States and European Union engaging extensively, especially on energy and sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A March 2022 joint U.S.-EU announcement established a new Task Force on European Energy Security. This grouping has since met 11 times and has been an effective vehicle for transatlantic communication and coordination on energy issues, enabled by high-level leadership and participation on both sides. Task force members include Björn Seibert, head of cabinet for the European Commission president; Amos Hochstein, U.S. senior adviser for energy security; Ditte Juul Jørgensen, European Commission director general for energy; and Sarah Ladislaw, special assistant to the president and senior director for climate and energy at the White House National Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force has enabled much more robust U.S.-EU engagement in relation to the energy dimension of this crisis. U.S. LNG has been a major topic of the task force, including discussing “global LNG markets and market projections, the regulatory environment and permitting outlook in the United States and the EU, the development of U.S. LNG export capacities, the reinforcement of EU LNG infrastructure, and the EU Energy Platform and Joint Purchasing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eu-sanctions-on-the-russian-energy-sector&quot;&gt;EU Sanctions on the Russian Energy Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has phased in sanctions on the Russian energy sector (Figure 17), seeking to minimize the negative impact on EU member states while still affecting Russian finances. EU law mandates that member states in the Council of the European Union unanimously approve sanctions, requiring the acquiescence of all EU states in order to come into force. The mandate has substantially limited the ambition of this instrument, holding back sanctions on Russian gas or nuclear fuel and requiring several country-specific exceptions when sanctioning crude oil or oil products. Sanctions have sought to reconcile national interests within the European Union and have run parallel to the unfolding war and the energy crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/u91j3Fo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 17: EU Sanctions on Russian Imports Evolution, 2022–24.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first round of sanctions focused on limiting the access of Russian banks to the international financial system and the transfer of technology to the Russian energy sector. Coal was the first Russian energy source that the European Union sanctioned. The ban on imports of all Russian coal was agreed to in April 2022 as part of the fifth package of sanctions against Russia, granting a four-month grace period for existing contracts. Coal sanctions were relatively easy to agree upon thanks to a high level of self-sufficiency in Europe (75 percent in 2021), the short-term nature of coal contracts (around 90 days), and the relative availability of alternative suppliers in the Atlantic basin (e.g., Colombia, South Africa, and the United States).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case for EU sanctions on Russian oil was more complicated. Sanctions on seaborne oil imports were agreed to in June 2022, with a six-month grace period and an opt-out provided for Bulgaria, exemplifying the complexities of negotiations in the Council of the European Union. At the time of the negotiations, Russian state-owned Lukoil’s refinery in Burgas, Bulgaria, was the largest industrial complex in the country, originally designed to process exclusively Ural-grade crude oil. Following sustained negotiations, Bulgaria obtained a “‘special derogation’ from the measure until the end of 2024 due to its ‘geographical exposure’” as a means to achieve unanimity in the council. The exception subsequently proved a loophole for sanctions evasion, and Bulgaria voluntarily withdrew from the exemption. Bulgaria is now seeking options to sell the Lukoil refinery to new owners willing to inject the investment necessary to allow the facility to process non-Russian crude varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian oil pipeline imports have also been temporarily exempted from EU sanctions. Central European countries, especially the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, citing their landlocked geography and the difficulties of switching their refineries to different crudes, obtained a temporary allowance for imports from the Druzhba pipeline. These countries, which continue to import Russian crude oil through this infrastructure, state that they will continue to do so in the medium term while building new import pipelines and upgrading their refining capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany and Poland agreed to eliminate their temporary exception and cease imports of Russian crude oil by pipeline on January 1, 2023. In exchange, the commission allowed Kazakhstan to export oil to Germany through Russian pipelines. Although this technically is a move to eliminate Russian crude imports, Kazakhstan’s oil, which must be supplied through the Russian transmission system, inevitably mixes with Russian oil, and Moscow receives oil transit fees. The temporary measure allows inland German refineries to operate at full capacity and avoid bottlenecks in the pipeline transportation system from the seaports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An embargo on Russian-refined products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, and kerosene) came into force in February 2023 and curbed EU imports of most Russian petroleum products. However, non-EU countries can import Russian oil, refine products, and export these to the European Union, in effect creating a loophole for indirect imports of Russian oil. The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air has called China, India, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates “laundromats” for Russian oil, importing larger quantities of crude oil since the EU embargo while also growing export volumes of diesel and jet fuel to the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to banning seaborne crude oil imports, the European Union has imposed several prohibitions regarding maritime services and access to its ports in relation to the oil trade between Russia and third countries. EU operators are barred from providing maritime services and insurance unless the trade adheres to the Group of Seven (G7) oil price cap. Vessels engaging in ship-to-ship transfers suspected of violating the Russian oil import ban or the G7 price cap are denied access to EU ports, as are vessels that manipulate or deactivate their navigation tracking systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These restrictions have not been applied to LNG shipping services and transport. European terminals are offering transshipment services to Russian gas tankers. From November to June, during the Arctic winter season, most Russian LNG coming from the Yamal region needs icebreakers to access international markets. To optimize the routes of these specialized vessels, the natural gas they transport is transferred to conventional LNG vessels, principally at the terminals of Zeebrugge in Belgium and Montoir-de-Bretagne in France, for subsequent export to non-European markets. The eleventh round of European sanctions on Russia included transshipments of petroleum and derivatives that did not comply with the maximum price stipulated by the G7, but it deliberately omitted transshipment of LNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPLAINING THE LACK OF NUCLEAR SANCTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the drop in oil and gas trade between the European Union and Russia, imports of nuclear fuel products have steadily increased since February 2022. The absence of sanctions may be explained by the European Union’s unique dependence on Russian nuclear fuel products and, secondly, by the limited impact that sanctions have had on Russia’s trade balance and the Kremlin’s budget. According to Eurostat, the European Union imported only €572 million of Russian nuclear-related products in 2022. The European Union has continued purchasing nuclear technology and fuel from Russia for the 19 Soviet-designed water-water energetic reactors (VVERs) operating in five member states: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, and Slovakia. Replacing Russian fuel is not a simple task: it is not an easily substituted commodity, and it requires adapting capacities in nuclear power plants and obtaining alternative suppliers in a very tight market. EU countries have increased Russian nuclear fuel deliveries from 314 tons of nuclear fuel in 2022 to 573 tons in 2023, a result that may be due to stockpiling in case of expanded conflict or supply disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hungary is the only member state without explicit plans to transition to alternative fuel suppliers. The rest are pursuing alternate suppliers. The Czech Republic is poised to begin receiving Western-manufactured nuclear fuel from Westinghouse and, potentially, Framatome starting in late 2024. Slovakia, through its nuclear plant operator Slovenské Elektrárne, aims to introduce Westinghouse fuel by 2027 following a licensing agreement, although a newly elected Russia-friendly government may negatively affect the implementation of these plans. Finland is preparing to shift its Loviisa reactor units to non-Russian fuel between 2027 and 2030, having engaged in discussions with Westinghouse about fuel supply even before the onset of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EXPLAINING THE LACK OF GAS SANCTIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of May 2024, the European Union has not imposed specific sanctions on Russian natural gas. While pipeline gas imports have fallen by four-fifths from 2019 levels following Russia’s weaponization of gas supplies, LNG imports from Russia remain above prewar levels. Sanctions on Russian gas have been a politically sensitive issue in Brussels. The unanimity required to impose sanctions is difficult to achieve due to the threat of further disruption of supplies disproportionately affecting countries most dependent on pipeline imports. Hungary’s opposition is an example of a significant obstacle to agreement in the Council of the European Union. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán has sought to engage and work with the Kremlin even after the invasion, reaching an agreement for the purchase of additional volumes of gas and the diversion of its Russian gas imports away from Ukrainian pipelines to the TurkStream pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its recent Regulation on Gas and Hydrogen Networks, the European Union has implemented a mechanism which allows member states to temporarily block Russian and Belarusian exporters from reserving infrastructural capacity for natural gas shipments via pipeline and LNG. This mechanism, which has to be implemented voluntarily at the state level, would allow European companies to terminate their contracts by invoking force majeure clauses and protect themselves against possible arbitration. Because this mechanism does not constitute an EU-wide ban or sanction, it circumvents the unanimity standard. While European commissioner for energy Kadri Simson has urged member states to use this mechanism, it is uncertain whether the mechanism will be implemented in a coordinated and effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe actively sought to decouple from Russian coal and oil, it did not collectively seek to decouple from Russian gas. Instead, Europe has been forced to scramble due to the collapse in supply. Europe has not sanctioned Russian gas, though it is now considering sanctioning LNG. The reduction in purchases of Russian natural gas has been mainly due to lower volumes shipped through Nord Stream (out of operation) and Yamal (closed due to the Kremlin’s requirement to make payments in rubles). The transit contract through Ukraine for Russian gas expires on December 31, 2024. Its future is unknown. Although Ukraine has announced its refusal to negotiate bilaterally with Gazprom, it has opened the door to possible contracted volumes on the spot market for interested European countries — mainly Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia. This uncertainty about the future of Ukrainian pipelines and the creation of a possible European mechanism to block Russian LNG imports should help to further reduce Russian gas imports in 2025 and 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-a-new-european-energy-security-strategy&quot;&gt;Toward a New European Energy Security Strategy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe came through the crisis, but challenges remain. From a supply perspective, Europe has found a way to replace Russian gas. But these are largely from sources external to the European Union, and the costs of these alternative sources are higher and will therefore impact Europe’s economic competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electricity-market-reform&quot;&gt;Electricity Market Reform&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electricity sector emerged from the 2022 energy crisis as a major locus of energy security considerations for policymakers. The surges in electricity pricing devastated consumers, both households and businesses, and cascaded shocks from the natural gas sector throughout the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status of marginal pricing sits at the center of the debate. During the crisis, numerous ad hoc interventions into the electricity market were proposed; some were implemented to reduce consumer exposure to spot prices set by marginal pricing. After the crisis, the sector emerged with newfound political relevance, which catalyzed widespread interest in reforming markets based on the lessons of 2022. Nonetheless, widespread consensus on the need for review and reform in the sector does not imply widespread agreement on the substance of that reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two key objectives appear in conflict. On one hand, reform seeks to limit the exposure of electricity consumers to volatile pricing sourced from gas-fired generation and their ability to benefit from the low prices of new renewable generation. This implies limiting consumer exposure to prices set via marginal pricing in the market. On the other hand, massive volumes of investment must be attracted to the sector to make continued progress on decarbonization. This includes investment in wind and solar generation, but expanded investment is of increasing importance in technologies such as battery storage and hydrogen-fired generation, which can help balance the intermittency of renewables. Broadly stated, price signals, free of regulatory risk and reflective of overall system scarcity, are the best way to attract private capital at scale. Furthermore, price signals are the crucial incentive for demand response programs, the expansion of which is a crucial objective for overall sectoral efficiency and managing the intermittency of renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We are moving from a fuel-based system to a technology based one, but this change is not happening overnight in the sense that you need to manage the risks and the complexities. . . . And as we are planning our transition to a technology-based system where materials, equipment, manufacturing capacity, critical raw materials are key in this sense, we . . . are trying both in terms of technologies and in terms of geographies (to find) complementarity that we can leverage if we operate in different systems. And of course, this has a big impact on the energy security of a . . . region like Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An initial package of reforms was proposed in March 2023, and following a sustained period of negotiations, the Council of the European Union approved a final package in March 2024. Overall, this package yielded considerable incremental reform while resisting more radical changes that sought to move away from a single marginal market clearing price determined by merit order dispatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package empowers EU member states to deploy fixed-price and fixed-term contracts, which can come in the form of power purchase agreements or contracts for differences (CFDs). Both contracts are already in use across EU member states to varying extents, but the new rules direct member states to make these contract arrangements available to consumers and project developers and, in particular, allow for contracts that cross national borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule also creates room for member states to deploy new capacity support mechanisms. In U.S. electricity markets such as PJM, capacity markets are a well-established mechanism to manage long-term resource adequacy. They create a second vector, independent of spot marginal pricing, by which funds can flow from consumers to generators organized around the principle of availability at periods of peak demand. Germany has proposed exactly such a mechanism to attract investment into the hydrogen-fired thermal power plants it needs to build to balance out renewables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty remains over how member states will interpret and implement the EU reform package. The proposal invokes various design principles, with which both capacity mechanisms and CFDs should comply. The exact technical limits of these principles and the enforcement of these limits remain to be seen and will determine the overall impact of the reform package. Overall, the package seeks a tenuous balance between further integration of a competitive European electricity market to the benefit of efficient decarbonization and the need to preserve member states’ ability to procure generation resources in line with their specific national strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;banking-on-hydrogen-the-eu-hydrogen-strategy-and-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Banking on Hydrogen: The EU Hydrogen Strategy and Diplomacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key to Europe’s energy security and climate ambitions are the development and deployment of green hydrogen. Hydrogen was already an essential component of the EU decarbonization strategy before Russia invaded Ukraine. However, it took on a renewed and more prominent role in EU energy plans as the bloc sought to diversify away from Russian fossil fuel resources after the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in previous chapters, REPowerEU was conceived at the height of the energy crisis to diversify the European Union away from Russian fossil fuels. By updating the Fit for 55 targets published only a year before, the initiative further galvanized the bloc’s clean energy ambitions. For hydrogen, it brought about two landmark changes. First, the European Union began targeting a market of 20 million tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030, doubling its initial commitment of 10 million tons produced by member states by importing 10 million tons from reliable suppliers across the globe. Second, support for low-carbon hydrogen derived from natural gas was tacitly phased out, and plans for government funding were scratched. This lack of support was a ramification of natural gas supply disruptions during the energy crisis jeopardizing hydrogen-dependent industries, such as ammonia producers and refining operations, as well as the premise that high gas prices made low-carbon hydrogen obsolete as a transitional stand-in for renewable hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To match the doubling of supply targets, demand targets for end-use sectors received a commensurate boost (Figure 18). Industry saw an increase in the share of renewable hydrogen consumption in the sector from 35 percent to 75 percent by 2030. Meanwhile, the transport sector nearly doubled its 2030 target for consumption of renewable fuels of nonbiological origin. The Hydrogen Valleys initiative also had its funds topped up in hopes of doubling the number of hydrogen valleys in the European Union by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bVr45c9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 18: Hydrogen Consumption 2030 Targets by End-Use Sector.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=SWD%3A2022%3A230%3AFIN&quot;&gt;“Commission Staff Working Document: Implementing the REPowerEU Action Plan: Investment Needs, Hydrogen Accelerator and Achieving the Bio-Methane Targets,” European Commission, May 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these objectives have faced substantial criticism due to the unrealistic targets on both the supply and demand sides. A recent report warns that the European Union is not on track to deploy enough renewables or electrolyzers to meet its production targets by 2030, while the outlook on imports is still uncertain. Meanwhile, consumption targets rely on unconsolidated end uses and lagging adoption in existing demand sectors. Industry executives have pointed out that the high cost of renewable hydrogen proves a major barrier to wider adoption, warranting a reassessment of initial targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SECURING SUPPLIES THROUGH HYDROGEN DIPLOMACY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already a core component in the EU hydrogen strategy, the international dimension has become central to achieving REPowerEU’s goal of importing up to 10 million tons of renewable hydrogen. Through so-called “green hydrogen partnerships,” the European Union will not only seek to meet its import quota while supporting clean energy project development in partner countries but also unlock the generational opportunity to rewire its energy partnerships and diversify its resource dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REPowerEU envisions the development of three hydrogen corridors via the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea, and through Ukraine, once conditions allow. This ambition has led the European Union through the development of strategic partnerships with Azerbaijan, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Namibia, Norway, and Oman, among others. The European Commission has also held talks with Saudi Arabia to increase energy cooperation, with hydrogen as a central pillar. On the transatlantic front, the European Union has already developed a hydrogen partnership with Canada and is looking to expand those partnerships into Latin America. Lastly, the United States is poised to become one of the leading renewable hydrogen markets, thanks to the incentives and tax credits contained within the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). In a bid to share this cornucopia, the Mission Possible Partnership is looking to spur U.S.-EU hydrogen trade opportunities by enabling Europe’s first shipment of clean hydrogen from the United States in 2026. All of these partnerships offer the European Union plenty of avenues for renewable hydrogen import supply diversification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-dependencies-risks-posed-by-clean-tech-supply-chains&quot;&gt;New Dependencies? Risks Posed by Clean Tech Supply Chains&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Europe seeks to further accelerate a clean transition that improves its overall energy security position, it faces new dilemmas in the domains of trade and economic security. The rapid expansion in renewable energy development has been characterized as merely shifting dependencies from Russia to China. As described by U.S. assistant secretary for energy resources Geoffrey R. Pyatt at the 2024 CSIS Energy Security and Geopolitics Conference, “We need to make sure that we don’t replace an era of dependence on Russian fossil fuels with dependence on critical minerals and critical mineral processing in the People’s Republic of China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new dependencies are real. Europe is 95 percent import dependent on China for solar PV panels. The European wind sector, which has for a long time been self-supplied, is coming under intense competitive pressure from Chinese firms and could be competed out of existence in the way German solar manufacturing was by Chinese firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actual and potential import dependencies pose challenges for policymakers. However, analytical clarity demands they be classified as trade or economic risks rather than energy security risks. Unlike gas or other fuel imports, there is very little risk to the short-term stability of the European energy system from a hypothetical interruption in access to Chinese solar panels. In short, Europe is currently trading reduced energy security risk for increased trade and economic risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of trade and the economic risks are complicated. The availability of ultra-low-cost (and increasingly cheaper) Chinese solar panels and wind turbines lowers the overall investment cost of Europe’s climate ambitions. The value here should not be overlooked given the massive fiscal outlays the energy crisis imposes; for the European Union, the efficient use of public funds and subsidy capacity are ever more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inversely, allowing Chinese imports to overwhelm and destroy the viability of European clean manufacturing companies has economic, social, and political costs. Expanding the manufacturing employment base associated with climate technologies to improve the overall standing of climate politics is the central political-economic thesis of the IRA and is a model with considerable support in Europe (especially in the European Commission). Allowing Chinese imports to displace extant industries and jobs is likely to cause political backlash that undermines EU climate ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Trying to define an industrial strategy in Europe of what we want to produce and how we want to produce it in this global competition between America and China . . . is a really hard thing to do [when you need] unanimous agreement among 27 EU member states. And in my mind, that’s the kind of shaping energy and climate question of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-ben-mcwilliams-affiliate-fellow-bruegel&quot;&gt;— Ben McWilliams, Affiliate Fellow, Bruegel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade and economic competition concerns extend beyond China. The IRA implemented subsidies for clean energy manufacturing and successfully attracted large volumes of private capital investment. These subsidies apply to countries that hold a free trade agreement with the United States (e.g., Canada and Mexico). Notably, the European Union lacks any such free trade agreements. Thus, European-based manufacturing cannot participate in these subsidies — most notably, the electric vehicle tax credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade and economic risks of clean energy supply chains extend past technology and into the domain of raw materials. Europe is structurally short of the minerals critical to most modern clean technology. For example, the European Union is solely dependent on one country for heavy rare-earth elements (100 percent supplied by China), boron (98 percent supplied by Turkey), and platinum (71 percent supplied by South Africa). Recognizing that the bloc will never be self-sufficient but should diversify its supply of critical raw materials, the European Council adopted the European Critical Raw Materials Act in March 2024. Again, the direct comparison to fuel dependencies is inappropriate and represents a trade and economic risk rather than an energy security risk. Although Europe has some domestic mining and processing capacity — notably in the Nordic states — it is heavily dependent on raw materials and, more extensively, on processed materials used as inputs in higher-value manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vector of risk arrives through expanded Chinese clean energy investments in Europe. On a recent trip to Europe, Chinese president Xi Jinping traveled to Hungary, where it was recently announced that China would be opening new battery factories. China appears to be cultivating Hungary as a bastion of support in the European Union in the hopes that it will shield China from potential joint EU measures, akin to the role Hungary has played vis-à-vis Russian sanctions. Hungary has frequently blocked EU statements condemning or opposing Chinese action. In this respect, although clean energy supply chains can help reduce European energy security risks, they invite considerable risks in the domain of trade policy and, perhaps more troubling, undermine Europe’s ability to form coherent foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-and-different-gas-risks&quot;&gt;New and Different Gas Risks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Russian gas “weapon” is unlikely to ever pose the energy security risk to Europe that it posed before the crisis. This holds true even though Russian gas continues to flow into the European market, albeit at greatly reduced volumes, through both pipelines and LNG imports. Commercial developments, infrastructure investments, and political commitments have structurally reduced European reliance on Russian gas, and volumes are unlikely to ever return to precrisis levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many businesses may be open to a return to Russian gas, political endorsement or support for this strategy by European policymakers today appears unlikely so long as Putin remains in the Kremlin. For Europe to reengage Russia as an energy supplier, major political change in Moscow or a favorable end to the war that preserves Ukraine’s path to Europe is likely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversification is the most reliable principle by which to measure energy security, as established most famously by British statesman Winston Churchill in 1920: “Safety and certainty in oil lie in variety and variety alone.” Today, the diversification of suppliers, import vectors, and regional exposure of natural gas imports has to some extent structurally improved European energy security. However, it would be naive and simplistic to think Europe is free of gas-derived energy security risks. Today, European exposure has shifted elsewhere. Norway’s leading role in European gas markets makes sabotage against Norwegian undersea infrastructure a risk; such an event, timed with winter or storage-filling season, could drive gas shortages and price spikes in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Europe continues to rely on imports from states in North Africa and the Middle East, which could easily present diplomatic complications and provide leverage against European objectives. While recent Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have demonstrated the vulnerabilities of sea lanes and LNG supply from the Persian Gulf, pipeline supply remains the most complex to manage. Gas from Algeria and Libya, accounting for more than 10 percent of EU imports, faces problems of flat or declining production, rapid growth in domestic consumption, and geopolitical risks. At least since the Arab Spring, the European Union has demonstrated profound limitations in influencing the Maghreb and building an attractive neighborhood narrative. In the case of the Southern Gas Corridor, Azerbaijan’s bellicose attitude in its conflict with Armenia presents a risk to EU interests and the defense of its principles in the Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Europe now relies heavily on energy imports from the United States. Although the recent approval pause of a U.S. LNG export terminal does very little to affect current LNG flows and may very well do little to affect future flows, the development highlights how LNG exports have become a pawn in domestic politics. A hypothetical future with a climate-ambitious president in the White House with control of Congress could easily see scaled-back U.S. LNG exports, a result European climate advocates likely will applaud even as it may hurt European energy security. The nature of shale gas, based on short-cycle projects, means that without constant upstream investment, production may plateau or decline, jeopardizing the viability of continued expansion of LNG exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Europe is structurally exposed to global LNG markets in a way it never was before the crisis. Developments anywhere in the world that affect global LNG markets will affect the price and availability of LNG for Europe. This new exposure demands new, sustained, and serious attention from European policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-new-connective-midstream-and-integrating-europes-energy-market&quot;&gt;Building New Connective Midstream and Integrating Europe’s Energy Market&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis has demonstrated the considerable reliability and efficiency value of integrated infrastructure and market networks. It also demonstrates how much further integration is possible and needed. The combined pressure of an ongoing energy decoupling from Russia and an accelerating energy transition requires Europe to invest in physical infrastructure — both electric transmission and pipeline networks — and advance the integrated market systems that extract maximum value out of these networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TRANSMISSION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric transmission played a crucial role in enabling European member states to avoid load-shedding situations through the summer of 2022 and the winter of 2022–23. Variable renewable energy (e.g., wind and solar) allows for reduced reliance on Russian gas in the power sector but requires greatly expanded intra- and intermember state transmission infrastructure to reduce curtailment rates and price cannibalization effects and allow for continued rapid deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We found ourselves in is this situation where suddenly NATO is having to police interconnector wires between different countries in Europe. . . . Managing the geopolitical complications of making a system where everybody has to have a certain amount of backup generation — and we’re going to utilize it strategically as an entity — [entails] data and physical challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-amy-myers-jaffe-research-professor-new-york-university&quot;&gt;— Amy Myers Jaffe, Research Professor, New York University&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 REPowerEU plan targets expanded electricity interconnection projects that cross member state boundaries and improve European electric integration. In November 2023, the European Commission proposed an action plan aimed at accelerating transmission project development and announced a list of 166 Projects of Common Interest (PCIs), 88 of which involved the electric system. The PCI designation grants projects considerable permitting advantages and makes them eligible for EU funding from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). Notable examples of projects underway include the France-Spain interconnection and the Baltic synchronization project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transmission projects, especially large, high-voltage interstate projects that deliver the most system value, are very costly and difficult to plan, permit, and build. Cross-border projects require difficult political coordination among member states and the ever-present challenge of social acceptability. Although planning and policy are improving and overall investment in grids is growing, research by Ember indicates that the grid investment plans of many European utilities fail to match member state renewable energy policy targets. Cost is the primary brake on expanded investment for both utilities and member states because the investment dollars are paid by rate payers who are already reeling from greatly elevated electricity prices. The CEF is funded at €5.84 billion through 2027, but the commission estimates €584 billion in investments are needed in the electric grid by 2030. The French-Spain interconnection project costs €2.8 billion alone, and Europe needs dozens of such projects if targets are to be met. In short, expanded funding at the EU level is likely necessary to achieve the European Commission interconnection target of 15 percent by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PIPELINES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fuels side, the considerable investment and expansion needed in pipeline networks pose a unique challenge. Many member states continue to rely on Russian piped oil and gas due to infrastructure constraints. Investment in new and expanded pipeline networks will help member states decouple further from Russia and improve overall European energy security and market stability. At the same time, if EU climate ambitions are to be realized, Europe must transition away from these fossil fuel networks. Right-sizing investment to achieve near- and medium-term energy security objectives without jeopardizing long-term climate targets is a difficult needle to thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis has compelled the European Union to quickly invest in new gas infrastructure — both import terminals and internal transport capacity. However, these investments come with risk of carbon lock-in, as existing infrastructure tends to be used, thus delaying European energy transition objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generally agreed-upon solution is in dual-use infrastructure: today’s gas infrastructure should be built such that it can be used for the hydrogen networks of tomorrow. Although reasonable in concept, the engineering in practice is more complicated. LNG terminals in particular face challenges related to adaptation to low-carbon gases, such as hydrogen or low-carbon ammonia. The technical and economic feasibility of such conversions is still at an exploratory stage, with significant uncertainties surrounding the costs and efficiency of the conversion processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In delivering a substitute for Russian fossil-gas, the European Union’s strategic bet on decarbonized hydrogen has clear geopolitical and energy security benefits alongside obvious climate benefits. But the development of a functional hydrogen market and industrial ecosystem requires dedicated infrastructure to connect production and consumption centers, similar to the expansive existing gas transportation network. EU transmission system operators have proposed a hydrogen backbone to repurpose existing infrastructure dedicated to natural gas and complement it with new hydrogen-specific pipelines and storage sites. A major challenge is the unknown scale, composition, and geographic distribution of future hydrogen production and consumption centers. Investment of public or private dollars is therefore difficult to justify. Some mega projects, such as H2med, connecting Barcelona to Marseille via an undersea pipeline, have already been criticized for their lack of economic realism, sheer technical difficulty, and weak climate credentials. The sum of technology and market uncertainty and member state policy coordination challenges means that development of a European hydrogen infrastructure network and market will likely take longer and be more costly than assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;protecting-critical-energy-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Protecting Critical Energy Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Nord Stream sabotage revealed the vulnerability of Europe’s critical energy infrastructure in the undersea domain. In October 2023, a group of undersea pipelines and telecom cables linking Finland to Estonia were also damaged and taken out of operation. In this case, the cause was identified as a Chinese ship dragging an anchor, although explicit motives have not been established. Europe is structurally exposed to hybrid threats such as these against the extensive undersea infrastructure networks in the Baltic and North Seas. Oil and gas pipelines are the traditional class of infrastructure in these waters. With the increased importance of Norwegian gas flows, the energy security imperative to protect these assets has grown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“One of the big lessons that came out of the energy crisis, and that still is coming, is that we did not have enough resilience in terms of our energy infrastructure. . . . Things could very easily come down. And that’s not energy security. . . . So, we need to build overcapacity. And to do that, we need to convince the private sector and insurers to keep building these assets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian ground forces have been depleted in Ukraine and Russia’s military industrial base has been stretched, the country’s capacity to inflict damage on European energy infrastructure remains intact. While Russia’s navy has been underfunded for years and consists largely of Soviet-era platforms, its underwater capacity continues to grow. Russia’s submarine program has been a noteworthy priority, exemplified by the Kremlin authorizing 13 new nuclear and conventional submarines since 2014. A CSIS report from 2023 notes, “Russia’s ability to target critical infrastructure short of war and impose economic costs to deter external intervention in regional conflicts is an important component to Moscow’s doctrine and thinking on escalation management.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the energy transition implies massive investment in offshore wind and undersea transmission in the Baltic, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Attacks on undersea electric transmission cables have not been observed to date but could create power grid disruptions that cascade failure across the network. Thus, the energy transition toward clean energy assets in many ways expands undersea critical infrastructure exposure. NATO has established a new operational group, the Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure, to manage these risks. Appropriate levels of risk management likely require increased funding, as Europe and NATO will need to procure more operational assets to expand coverage, including traditional surface fleet assets alongside new technologies such as sea drones, sensor networks, and the use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-transatlantic-energy-cooperation&quot;&gt;Expanding Transatlantic Energy Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy crisis has demonstrated the value of sustained transatlantic cooperation and coordination. During the crisis, European access to U.S. LNG was critical. After the crisis, Europe will remain reliant on U.S. LNG volumes over the medium term as it seeks to cement its energy decoupling from Russia. The U.S. LNG permitting pause has further demonstrated the value of established and close working relationships; policy decisions and impacts on both sides of the Atlantic can be accurately communicated and discussed, and diplomatic rifts can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of reliable partnerships in energy trade highlights the need and potential for greater U.S.-EU cooperation when it comes to broader clean technology and climate policy issues. Despite considerable U.S.-EU engagement in this area, there have been few breakthroughs. Sustained efforts to negotiate a green steel agreement have been unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passage of the IRA in the United States caused considerable diplomatic backlash in Europe, as it was felt that the policy unduly discriminated against European suppliers. The Biden administration has sought to soften the impact of the IRA on European suppliers, but there has been no movement on either side of the Atlantic toward a new U.S.-EU trade agreement despite the extensive engagement established through the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are major energy and climate issues that require transatlantic partnership. The implementation of the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will put in place tariffs on carbon-intensive imports into the European Union. The European Union and United States should consider this an opportunity to coordinate on carbon-linked trade. They would also benefit from close coordination on climate and trade policies focused on China, such as with regard to electric vehicles, batteries, or critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crisis spawned many lessons relevant for experts and policymakers in a variety of fields. Most of the lessons are positive. Europe has come out of the crisis more energy secure and has demonstrated the resilience and strength of its European project. However, the crisis left a significant fiscal mark on European economies and, through price shock and inflationary effects, gave rise to more antiestablishment parties, many of which seek to roll back aspects of the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Democracies and markets are resilient and durable and can survive shocks.&lt;/strong&gt; Europe showed tremendous strength and resilience in response to the energy shock. The energy shock became a test not just of Europe’s energy sector but also of Europe’s union and the resilience of its democratic political system, market economy, and free and open societies. Europe’s markets responded, creating incentives for action, and Europe’s allies and partners stepped up. In the face of strategic coercion, Europe took drastic action, leveraged its wealth and fiscal capacity, and demonstrated the resilience of its market-based economies. That response depended critically on the creativity of its democratic political system. Instead, a Eurobarometer survey from 2023 showed that 58 percent of EU citizens believed that the bloc should accelerate the green transition in view of the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The strength of the European Union and its ability to act should not be underestimated.&lt;/strong&gt; Heading into the crisis, all major actors underestimated the strength and resilience of the European Union, including Russia, the United States, and Europeans themselves. The bloc’s fiscal firepower could be mounted at scale, with speed, and with great effect. European fiscal capacity was leveraged just as it was during the Covid-19 pandemic to protect European consumers, businesses, and the European way of life. As a result, the European Union is a much more prominent energy actor than before the crisis, demonstrating that not only is the union forged in crisis, but it enables Europe to respond to crises much more powerfully and effectively than if countries operated independently. In that sense, the European Union is a source of Europe’s resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia failed in its attempt to blackmail EU member states.&lt;/strong&gt; Ultimately, Russia lost the energy war with Europe. Russia now has significant stranded gas assets, leading to significant losses for Gazprom. While Russia has benefited from high energy prices and has found ways to keep its oil on the market, it failed to leverage its dramatic reduction in gas flows into Europe before the Nord Stream explosions. Europe progressively increased its aid to Ukraine and expanded its sanctions efforts against Russia, including placing an embargo on Russian oil, which has had a more significant impact than the oil price cap mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. LNG was critical to mitigating the crisis and can play an important role in U.S. foreign policy.&lt;/strong&gt; The export of U.S. LNG filled the huge gap left by Russian natural gas supplies. In an era of great power competition in which energy can be weaponized, the ability of the United States to supply countries with LNG through market forces can reduce the ability of Russia or other autocratic states to use energy to coerce.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The market shock served to supercharge renewables deployment, particularly solar energy.&lt;/strong&gt; While the shift to LNG and alternative gas imports was central to maintaining energy security in the wake of the crisis, the expansion of renewables was equally remarkable and demonstrated that the rapid deployment and expansion of renewables is possible. However, there is also a need to simultaneously integrate and modernize grids, as well as expand storage to better cope with the intermittency of renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is economic urgency for Europe to accelerate the green transition.&lt;/strong&gt; The loss of access to lower-cost Russian piped natural gas in exchange for imported LNG has affected European economic competitiveness, with significant implications for Germany in particular. Thus, accelerating the energy transition for Europe is essential not just to meet climate goals or enhance Europe’s energy security but also to ensure its economic competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S.-EU partnership is vital and must be strengthened.&lt;/strong&gt; U.S.-EU engagement and coordination in these sectors have become much more robust and have laid the groundwork for a stronger U.S.-EU relationship. Historically, this relationship has been strained or limited. Different policy approaches to climate action, exemplified by the United States relying heavily on subsidies and the European Union pursuing a more balanced policy mix centered on carbon pricing, complicate the harmonization of transatlantic energy and climate policy. However, the importance of issues at the intersection of energy, climate, and trade will increase in the coming years, as the clean-tech revolution unfolds and becomes critical to the economic model of both blocs as well as to their wider geopolitical positioning vis-à-vis China. The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council is a promising forum for closer coordination but has so far failed to resolve tensions stemming from each side’s parochial interests on technology regulation and state aid rules. Finding policy alignment between the two blocs will thus continue to be a challenge but must be prioritized to achieve shared transatlantic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The crisis has added to Europe’s fiscal strains.&lt;/strong&gt; Massive fiscal outlays were deployed to keep industry afloat, particularly in Germany. The inflationary impacts of higher energy costs had a deeply negative impact on European households and the European economy. The European fiscal response, which came after the massive fiscal outlays in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, has created a more difficult fiscal environment for European policymakers that presently limits their freedom of action. For instance, the dramatic policy ambitions of the government under UK prime minister Liz Truss were strongly repudiated by markets, forcing a policy retreat and her eventual resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political backlash came primarily against incumbents rather than Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; In 2022, there were fears that the shock of energy costs would turn Europeans against supporting Ukraine. That did not happen, and support for Ukraine remained high. Nevertheless, although European publics were aware of the cause of the energy crisis, political leaders have felt blowback. Discontent with economic conditions had negative repercussions on policymakers across Europe; even if there was only limited initial political blowback, the energy crisis was not politically cost-free.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The rise of far-right parties ahead of the 2024 European parliamentary election and the surge in farmer protests railing against environmental policies suggest that European leaders have limited latitude for ambitious climate action. However, public polling figures paint a very different picture. A 2023 Eurobarometer survey indicated that 86 percent of respondents found it important to take initiative at the European level to limit the immediate impact of rising energy prices on consumers and companies during the prior year. In terms of future action, 86 percent thought that gas storage within the bloc should be padded to avoid the risk of shortages, 85 percent believed that the manufacturing of clean technologies should be boosted, and 79 percent believed that EU measures should aim at reducing energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy story that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has not ended. In the more than two years since the invasion, Europe has demonstrated its strength and resilience by emerging more energy secure, with the green transition relatively on course, and avoiding economic recession. But challenges still loom, as the rise in energy costs has created a systemic challenge for European industry and competitiveness. While European solidarity behind Ukraine has been maintained, and the threat of Russian energy extortion has been largely extinguished, the political fallout from the shock is still being felt. Anti-incumbent political sentiment remains high, leading to a surge in far-right parties. Opposition to Europe’s climate agenda has grown and will likely result in a new European Parliament that is less supportive of strong climate action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, Europe faces cross-cutting pressures. On the one hand, there is a strong economic need to increase Europe’s domestic energy supplies. For most European countries, aggressive deployment of renewables will be the most cost-effective course, balancing cost with climate ambition. But rising pressures could lead to backsliding. If high energy costs are blamed on the transition to low-carbon energy, they could inspire populist opposition to the “green agenda” and stall bolder action in the coming years. And the establishment of secure supply chains for clean energy technology remains a challenge, so that Europe does not swap one form of dependence for another.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;唯一罪成被告賴振邦求情：非主腦角色、僅提供協助&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IfSdgGM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴7名被告。陪審團上周四裁定6人罪名不成立，僅「無名小隊」賴振邦的交替罪「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立，他今（2日）於高等法院求情。辯方希望法庭接納賴並非本案主腦，他僅在某些方面提供協助。辯方又指，無證據證明賴知道爆炸品的重量。法官張慧玲根據裁決結果推斷，陪審團應未能肯定賴知道炸彈重20公斤，亦不接納彭軍壕稱賴有去華仁書院協助組裝炸彈，因此未能肯定賴知道炸彈的擺放位置。張官押後判刑，以待其餘認罪被告完成求情。為「污點證人」的黃振強將於本月26日求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;賴振邦（案發時29歲，現時33歲）被裁定屬交替罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;賴已還柙4年，他今身穿黑色西裝，由懲教押解出犯人欄，出庭時一度向旁聽親友揮手。被判無罪的張銘裕亦有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;賴由大律師是香媛及余承熹代表。控方讀出其經歷口供，指他於2020年1月17日被捕，19日獲准保釋，同年9月5日再因本案被捕。辯方透露，賴希望能夠在今日判刑，惟法官張慧玲指不會於今天判刑，因要待其餘認罪被告完成求情，預計會在10月判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴無參與小隊會議試爆亦非他負責操作&quot;&gt;辯方：賴無參與小隊會議、試爆亦非他負責操作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，罪成的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，與「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪絕對不相同，兩者在最高判刑上有分別。辯方指，希望法庭接納賴並非主腦，他只是在某些方面提供協助。他亦沒有參與小隊的會議，即使是在其工作室後樓梯進行的試爆，均是由策劃者吳智鴻負責攜帶炸藥以及操作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方未能證明賴知道爆炸品重量&quot;&gt;辯方：未能證明賴知道爆炸品重量&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指無證據證明賴知道爆炸品的重量。張官表示，根據裁決結果推斷，陪審團應該未能肯定賴知道炸彈重20公斤，亦不接納彭軍壕稱賴有去華仁書院協助組裝炸彈，因此未能肯定賴知道炸彈的擺放位置。陪審團只能肯定賴有份參與試槍，以及他是 Telegram 帳戶「接完紙鶴未？」的使用者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方賴為人孝順還柙期間進修增值&quot;&gt;辯方：賴為人孝順、還柙期間進修增值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後指，賴在獄中有寫求情信予法官，而賴的胞姊及家人亦有撰寫求情信。辯方表示，家人認為賴是一名孝順的兒子，他待人接物真誠友善，並樂於助人。賴在還柙期間並無放棄自己，更進修增值，希望出獄後成為有用的人。辯方亦指，稍後會補交與本案相關的案例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，被裁定《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，以及「串謀謀殺」罪不成立。賴振邦被裁定交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立。女被告劉佩凝的「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪亦不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（2日）處理最後一批被告、9名新界東初選參與者的求情，包括何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆及林景楠。庭外續現排隊旁聽人龍，有市民稱因721事件認識何桂藍，因此通宵排隊支持她，並稱讚何「硬淨」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，何桂藍的偶像黃耀明（明哥）今日亦有到庭旁聽，曾與她一同看達明一派演唱會、在何入獄後代她送花予明哥的友人Louis說：「會等佢出嚟，同佢一齊追返咁多樣嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;罪脫李予信第三度現身旁聽-望港人續關心法庭案&quot;&gt;罪脫李予信第三度現身旁聽 望港人續關心法庭案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;獲裁定罪脫、曾參與超區初選的李予信，今早再席排隊入席旁聽。他指關心法庭正審訊的案件已成其日常，望港人能繼續關心各法庭案件，並照顧好自己的心情，「我都係做緊呢樣嘢，係我嘅日常」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾代何桂藍送花予明哥-友人等佢出嚟一齊追返咁多樣嘢&quot;&gt;曾代何桂藍送花予明哥 友人：等佢出嚟一齊追返咁多樣嘢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis今早約七時半前來排隊旁聽。Louis早在數年前的學運已認識何桂藍，難忘2020年亦曾與其看達明一派演唱會，並一起送花；惟後來何因47人案被捕，到了2021年只有他獨自送足六場花。他說，「會等佢出嚟，同佢一齊追返咁多樣嘢」。另外，「慢必」陳志全為Louis相識超過十年的同志平權朋友，近年亦會與在獄中的劉頴匡交流流行曲歌詞心得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis說，今次並非首次前來旁聽，而前來旨在聽審，不一定是要與被告們見面，「心態反而係想聽返成個過程」，指雖然會有熱心人在網上作文字直播，但始終認為「自己聽到先係最真」。他留意到「長毛」梁國雄等人陳情時，也帶出不少訊息，他鼓勵香港人將訊息消化，再加以實踐，「去消化返啲message，喺今時今日、咁嘅環境下，仲有咩好做，多過係覺得佢好慘，或者好勁」，寄語香港人反思當下自己仍然可以做的事，「去諗返我哋嘅身位可以做到啲咩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;因721認識何桂藍-市民讚硬淨&quot;&gt;因721認識何桂藍 市民讚「硬淨」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;70後市民蘇太昨晚凌晨約12時到達法院外，希望能進入正庭聽審。她向《獨媒》表示，今日前來主要為支持何桂藍和鄒家成。她在721事件認識何桂藍，其後曾聽聞何在獄中過得很辛苦而感到心痛，欣賞她即使身陷牢獄，仍能在艱難時期堅持發聲，認為何是個很「硬淨」的女生。蘇太亦稱欣賞鄒家成敢於追求公義，慨嘆自己這代人享受了由年輕人背負重擔所得來的成果，故此希望「幫佢哋行未行完嘅路」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;呂智恆養母不在港-朋友代撐場&quot;&gt;呂智恆養母不在港 朋友代「撐場」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiffany約7時半來到，她是呂智恆養母Elsa的朋友，因Elsa目前不在港，她希望到場支持呂。她說自己一向有關心在囚人士，並有做一些支援工作，因此認識呂。她形容，呂是個執着公義的人，「這是優點也是缺點」，又指今次案件是對他的人生課題，希望他能應付這課題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;旁聽市民respect何桂藍仲可以咁講&quot;&gt;旁聽市民：respect何桂藍「仲可以咁講」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李先生則表示，特別記掛何桂藍，對她很「respect」，形容她早前在庭上作供是「難得囉，仲可以咁講」、在被告中很優秀（outstanding）。他認為被告「只係講返個truth（真相）咋嘛，truth is out there」，「雖然都知個outcome（結果）係咩，都要做」，至於如何詮釋則是法官的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在大學從事研究的李，曾與郭家麒共事，他上周來旁聽新西被告求情時，也在延伸庭看到何桂藍，認為她比想像中活躍、精神不錯。被問想對被告說什麼，李指「冇乜特別嘢，辛苦晒佢哋」。李今亦帶同「想和你到水塔上看星星」的黑色環保袋，他說平日也有用，非今天特別攜帶，但也覺得「幾有意思」：「就算你唔係咩，我都覺得你都想同你someone去水塔睇星星。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早上近8時，現場有旁聽人士起衝突，有市民指戴口罩的女士是「排隊黨」，高呼：「惠州新動力！逢一三五喺度排隊！」、「收錢知唔知可恥、有冇良心呀」，「排隊攞錢，食咗腸穿肚爛」，警員一度上前了解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃今日身穿黑色上衣，上面印有荷蘭阿姆斯特丹大學的字樣，何曾在該大學讀碩士課程。黃稱今日前來不止是支持何桂藍，亦是來支持「慢必」陳志全等人，「畀佢哋知道我哋仲喺度支持緊佢哋」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於何桂藍沒有求情，黃耀明說：「佢一路都係好堅持佢自己嘅立場，我希望佢可以繼續stay strong……（有無咩想同佢哋講？）我真係唔知點講，因為其實真係好艱難，我希望佢哋無論作出決定，佢哋都堅強地繼續落去。同埋希望佢哋平安。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】9名新界東初選參與者今日求情，其中包括前《立場新聞》記者何桂藍。她在獄中還柙三年半，今早表明不作求情，不過她仍有多名好友特意到法庭旁聽。前西貢區議員陳嘉琳說，想讓何知道「佢仲有好多朋友，佢啲朋友都會認真生活」，又相信她「直到呢一刻都冇後悔及願意為自己所做的事承擔」；前民陣召集人楊政賢則說，因從前接受何訪問而認識她，希望何知道自己很掛念她，亦「持續被佢inspire」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;對阿藍嚟講每一庭都好重要&quot;&gt;「對阿藍嚟講，每一庭都好重要」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳嘉琳今早9時左右到法院，特意穿上粉紅色衫，「Anson Lo（何的偶像）代表色嘛」。她說早前在何接受審訊期間亦有到場，當時沒有「排隊黨」，因此順利進入正庭，今日則可能要在延伸庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳嘉琳與何桂藍因初選認識，當時何參選新界東，而陳是時任西貢區議員，在何擺街站時會「幫吓手」。陳嘉琳說，過去都有定時探監，每月見何一次，指她每次上庭前都會「備戰狀態」，上個月見她時已經「好認真、有準備」：「有啲人可能覺得，呢啲程序嘢走完就算，但對阿藍嚟講，每一庭都好重要，因為一日個trial（審訊）未完，呢個運動未完。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;形容何有原則-作為朋友會認真生活&quot;&gt;形容何「有原則」 作為朋友會「認真生活」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;她又說，何的意志很強，相信她「直到呢一刻都冇後悔及願意為自己所做的事承擔」，「很值得appreciate」。至於今日到庭，陳說最主要是想她知道「佢仲有好多朋友（笑），佢啲朋友都會認真生活」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊政賢則曾接受何桂藍訪問，認識約十年：「可能再之前係網友，以前鍾意上網鬧交（笑）」。他對上一次見到何是她接受審訊時，形容她sharp（醒目）、很有原則和有強烈的人本精神：「對於佢寫嘅人同事都有好多關懷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成友人盼讓被告知我哋一路冇遺忘&quot;&gt;鄒家成友人：盼讓被告知「我哋一路冇遺忘」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成友人、作家「薯伯伯」與鄒相識近三年多，過去亦有採望和寫信給他，交流佛學想法。他形容鄒為人真誠，清晰知道自己的理念，並會用實踐方式進行修為：「而唔係得口講，而係有積極態度面對佢身處嘅環境。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒早前因七一案判刑，薯伯伯對上一次見他已是他判刑前。他覺得，初選案是香港歷史上關鍵的事，今日前來是想讓被告和大家都知道「有香港人在見證，我哋一路冇遺忘」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（2日）處理最後一批、新界東9名被告的求情。其中代表何桂藍的大律師Trevor Beel表示確認何的定罪紀錄，並指除此以外沒有求情。沒有律師代表的劉頴匡則自行陳詞，指他參選主要望為示威者發聲、否決預算案並非重點，亦認為35+並不可能，望法庭考慮他為「積極參與者」的低至中程度。劉現正就七一立會暴動案服刑，他指該案與初選案時間、背景和目標相近，望法庭考慮整體量刑原則而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉在庭上又讀出女友黃于喬撰寫的求情信，黃指以劉的天資和才能，本能走一條「正常」的路，但他選擇從政，是出於對社會關懷、對民主化追求、望為港貢獻，不料因本案身陷囹圄，「人生最黃金時期」於獄中渡過。黃指劉還柙3年多每日風雨不改探望，正因不認為他是「作奸犯科、偷呃拐騙」的罪犯，而是值得她繼續關心和付出的人。黃又指，劉過去未曾妄想顛覆國家，亦不再是當初天真的少年，不再妄想能投身政治改變社會，只盼盡快重獲自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，劉亦呈上親撰的求情信，提及真誠相信初選不違法，如果知道參加初選會入獄，他不會參加，而是選擇其他方式為社會變得更好而戰。劉又指服刑是懲罰他所愛的人，對女友感到愧疚，明白除政治外有很多其他方式貢獻社會，望法官能寛大處理，令他能盡快履行作為男友和香港公民的責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;9被告今求情-歌手黃耀明等旁聽&quot;&gt;9被告今求情 歌手黃耀明等旁聽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今處理求情的被告，包括經審訊後罪成的何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷，以及認罪的劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆及林景楠。至於同參選新東、經審訊後罪成的梁國雄及柯耀林，則已於上周完成求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。何桂藍由大律師Trevor Beel代表，楊岳橋由資深大律師蔡維邦代表，陳志全由大律師馬維騉代表，鄒家成由大律師陳世傑代表，林卓廷和呂智恆由大律師沈士文代表，范國威由大律師吳靄儀代表，林景楠由大律師范凱傑代表。劉頴匡則沒有律師代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/K8lCKYN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於約10時步入法庭，分成三排，由6名懲教看管。獲保釋的林景楠穿黑色西裝、戴黑色格仔領帶和深藍口罩，呂智恆穿淺藍色長袖裇衫。此前獲保釋、其後被裁罪成的陳志全戴眼鏡，穿黑色上衣。鄒家成則穿白色上衣、卡其色短袖外套。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其餘被告還柙逾3年半，劉頴匡穿深藍色西裝、打深藍色領帶，慢必陳志全穿深藍Polo上衣、黑西裝外套。林卓廷穿粉紅色裇衫、深藍色西裝外套，楊岳橋穿白裇衫、深藍色外套，不時翹手。范國威穿白裇衫、灰色西裝外套。何桂藍則穿白色背心，戴高的短馬尾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉頴匡女友Emilia、罪脫的李予信、歌手黃耀明、前立法會議員邵家臻、前西貢區議員陳嘉琳、社民連陳寶瑩等也有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表何桂藍的大律師Trevor Beel表示，確認何的定罪紀錄，除此以外沒有求情陳詞（other than that, we have no plea in mitigation）。何桂藍沒有特別反應，續低頭用電腦打字。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉親自求情-稱屬積極參與者中低程度&quot;&gt;劉親自求情 稱屬「積極參與者」中低程度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後沒有律師代表的劉頴匡親自以英文求情。他表示，採納法律代表早前呈交的書面陳詞，包括因及時認罪減刑三分一，今再就其參與程度等作補充。劉指，判詞清楚指出參與初選並非違法，違法的是無差別否決預算案的協議，認為法庭判刑時應集中於他推動否決預算案的參與，而非論壇發言等。劉並認為自己屬刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」，但並非最積極，而是屬中至低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱無轉發墨落抗爭派記者會無發言&quot;&gt;劉稱無轉發「墨落」、抗爭派記者會無發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉解釋，其名字出現在「墨落無悔」聲明，但與其他被告不同，他沒有在個人社交平台再轉發，亦無在選舉論壇提及。他指該聲明對其他候選人來說，是很好的機會強調否決財案的決心，如果他更加積極參與，應會在庭上質問其他人為何不簽署、以及轉發帖文，但他沒有這樣做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又指，即使他參與7月15日的抗爭派記者會，而會上有人提及對否決預算案的想法，他也沒有提出反對，但他在會上沒有說過任何一句話、沒有回答記者問題或就否決發言，大部分時間如背景般站在後面，唯一做的只是與其他人「攬頭攬頸」拍照。劉指，他當然同意否決預算案，亦曾簽署組織者準備的文件，因此屬積極參與者，但並非最積極。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱參選主要望為示威者發聲否決財案非重點&quot;&gt;劉稱參選主要望為示威者發聲、否決財案非重點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續引述在新東初選論壇的發言，提及自己因七一立會案身負暴動罪，但無怨無悔，望能用選票授權最有堅定意志的抗爭隊伍，向世界宣告「沒有暴動，只有暴政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉指，由此可見他參選的目的，是望進入立法會，為像他一樣被以暴動罪拘捕的示威者發聲，對他來說，否決預算案並非重點、也不重要。法官陳慶偉指，但特赦示威者是五大訴求之一，而要令政府回應的唯一方法，就是要以無差別否決預算案威脅政府。劉表示，認為五大訴求並不可能。法官李運騰總結，即劉同意參與無差別否決的協議，但否決並非他主要關注，劉確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡其後再問，如政府回應五大訴求，劉作為暴動案被告也會得益。劉指有可能會、也有可能不會，指不知道政府如何回應五大訴求；而且作為合理的人，他不期望政府會回應全部訴求，即使非常努力，可能最多只回應三數個，甚或一個也不回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱政府能dq不信35是可能&quot;&gt;劉稱政府能DQ、不信35+是可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續提到論壇被問及，為何選民要投票予可能坐監的他，他回答「完全唔覺得35+係一個切實嘅目標嚟」，相信是「天空樓閣」。劉指，其意思是如選民希望有人在議會否決預算案，就不要投選他，因他很有機會入獄，強調他在案發時，已明確表示自己不相信35+是可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指劉於今年就暴動案判刑，關注他何時認罪。劉指他現時沒有資料，但是在2020年初選論壇之後，他亦無預計會隔這麼久才判刑。法官李運騰追問他何時認罪、能否舉出年份，劉此時轉身望向同涉立會暴動案認罪的鄒家成，鄒發笑，其後笑着指向劉：「我2023，你唔知。」控方其後確認，劉是於2021年9月表示擬認罪，並於2023年5月認罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續指，否決計劃不可能實現，政府只需DQ一至兩個人，計劃便不可能。法官陳慶偉問為什麼，劉指因最樂觀的情況，也只能拿到35或36席。陳慶偉說，「戴耀廷不是這樣想（not according to D1）」，劉同意，但指他不同意戴，並說「戴耀廷是一個有趣的人，他總是能將客觀不可能的事，變成看起來有威脅性的事」，林卓廷、楊岳橋等被告發笑。陳慶偉說，但被告決定跟隨戴耀廷行事，劉回應，因他有自己的議程，認為參與計劃能幫助他實現。劉又說，本案涉及所有市民、特區甚至中央政府，當局有很多方法能阻礙他們成功，望法庭考慮情況特別，給予額外折扣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉指計劃公開-望給予額外扣減&quot;&gt;劉指計劃公開 望給予額外扣減&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，除非其案情很特別（extraordinary），否則不會額外扣減，舉例額運大量危險藥物，即使被攔截、計劃不能實現，但主腦被捕時，也不會因其計劃不可能而給予扣減。劉表示明白，但強調「從未聽過任何一個串謀是如此公開」，沒有毒販會舉行記者會說自己販毒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉另涉立會暴動案-望考慮整體量刑減刑&quot;&gt;劉另涉立會暴動案 望考慮整體量刑減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續確認，預計今年12月11日就暴動案服刑完畢。他承認在暴動案保釋期間干犯初選案，但指他是因涉暴動案，才選擇參與初選。劉解釋，涉暴動案保釋期間，他盡力信守對法庭的承諾，不去參與非法集會和暴力活動。但他當時仍想找方法追尋其信念如「五大訴求」，故考慮了最安全、合法的選擇，即戴耀廷提倡的35+計劃，指戴作為法律學者，表示這是最安全的計劃。劉說，他最終因對法律的無知而參選，望法庭即使因他保釋期間犯案而加刑，也不會加刑太多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續指，他所涉的兩宗案件，案發時間和背景相近，均源自2019年反修例運動，目標同樣是「五大訴求」；兩案亦同樣涉干預立法會的運作，只是方式不同，暴動案涉武力、本案則涉憲制手段，但如法官所指，手段暴力與否或非最重要。劉指，若非身負暴動案，「我可能根本不會站在這裡」，而他就暴動罪已被重判7年（認罪扣減後判監54個月20天），是同類最嚴重，望法庭能考慮「整體量刑原則（totality principle）」而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又指，因其暴動案刑期於12月會服畢，提議法庭可直接在現有刑期減刑。法官李運騰指，現時未知劉的刑期，但可能比他暴動的刑期更長，又指不是說能在劉另案服刑完畢前判刑，但法庭會有方法考慮該原則減刑。李又指，不會承諾考慮該原則，又指劉在保釋期間犯案，或抵銷因整體量刑原則而減去的刑期。劉表示明白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上讀黃求情信從政非為私利非作奸犯科偷呃拐騙罪犯&quot;&gt;庭上讀黃求情信：從政非為私利、非「作奸犯科、偷呃拐騙」罪犯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉最後表示，呈交了來自他本人、朋友、女友、傳道人、前僱主的求情信，同意以其過往紀錄，他或不被視為良好品格。劉續指，「有時最親近我們的人，可能比我們更了解我們自己、比我們更好觀察我們自己」，故他選擇讀出女友的求情信節錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉引述求情信，黃指她是一名性別議題倡議者，也是劉的女朋友，「2024年是我與劉相識的第10年」。黃指，在她眼中，劉是一個「聰明、能言善辯、具領導天賦、不斷渴求知識、思維敏銳、語言能力強、充滿好奇心嘅人」，在他以前，黃交往的男生「出身傳統名校、中產、規規矩矩」，但劉卻不一樣，他出身基層、其中學黃無聽過、「都唔係好靚仔」，「但他身上卻有一種不一樣嘅光芒」。說到「唔係好靚仔」時，劉表示他不同意（which I do not agree），庭上多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續引述求情信，指以劉頴匡的天資和才能，他本來絕對有能力走一條「正常」的路，成為律師或教師等專業人士，過安穩舒適的中產生活。但他有志從政非為一己私利，完全是出於對社會人⺠的關懷、對香港⺠主化的追求、望能為港貢獻其才能，卻不料因此捲入此案、身陷囹圄，「人生最黃金嘅時期都喺牢獄中渡過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續說，認識劉頴匡時19歲，現在已29歲，十年的關係中，有三年多隔著監獄高牆，要透過限時電話筒、隔着探訪室玻璃見面對話。「還押三年多，我每日風雨不改到收押所探佢，正正因為我認為佢唔係作奸犯科、偷呃拐騙嘅罪犯，係個值得我繼續關心同付出嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6C9kT2z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃于喬&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃指三年多來，香港改變很多，亦知道一直被收押的劉已得到莫大懲罰。他過去固然未曾妄想要顛覆國家，亦不再是當初天真的少年，不會再妄想能夠投身政治改變社會、不會再沾邊任何有可能被定性為危害國安的行為。黃指，只望劉能盡快重獲自由，透露劉獄中攻讀學位，也自學多種語言、運動強身健體，望離開監獄時「他已是更好、更強、更成熟的人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉最後說，認為無人能比女友更好地見證他的成長。黃聞言眼眶泛紅，並用手拭淚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉親撰求情信稱如知初選會入獄不會參加&quot;&gt;劉親撰求情信稱如知初選會入獄不會參加&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，劉亦向法庭呈上親撰的求情信，但無在庭上讀出。據《獨媒》記者取得的信件（英文全文如下），劉在信中提到很清楚因嚴重罪行面臨長期監禁，但對他來說仍然有點不真實，他一直被教導成為一個關心和參與社會的好公民，盡力做好自己的角色，但最後卻入獄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉又指，他並非在2019年社會不穩後才從政的機會主義者，自2013年已參與社區事務，他承認知悉並同意戴耀廷提出的計劃，但從非其競選活動重點，他真誠相信初選不違法，而且如果知道參加初選會入獄，他不會參加，而是選擇其他方式為社會變得更好而戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉指，他現時30歲，應是建立家庭和事業的黃金時代，但他在獄中3年，可能要服刑更多年。劉指這並非對他的懲罰，也是懲罰他所愛的人。他特別對一直照顧她的女友感到愧疚，又指獄中裝備自己，他明白除政治外有很多其他方式貢獻社會，望法官能寛大處理，令他能盡快履行作為男友和香港公民的責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（2日）處理最後一批、新界東9名被告的求情。大律師陳世傑庭上讀出鄒家成的求情信節錄。鄒的社交媒體發布信件全文，當中提到他在15歲時首次參與七一遊行，令他明白社會不公，他參政望為民發聲，實現真正民主化，雖從未信35+可能，但始終深信民主的價值，即使今天為爭民主而身陷囹圄，仍相信「為人民服務的民選政府」終有一天必將降臨香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，他由始至終無意違反《國安法》，亦想像不了參選本身已構成危害國安，《國安法》生效後他一度想退選，但自覺身為政治人物肩負對人民的責任而繼續，「我懼怕，倘若連參選人都臨陣退縮，香港只會被恐懼的情緒籠罩，公民社會一沉百踩。我不忍心退選，我無法離群眾而去」。鄒指他初心始終不變，依然相信民主與公羲、關懷弱者、望香港變得更好，獄中數年他努力讀書、修身修心，雖不知何時重獲自由，但盼出獄時能自豪說：「這些年我都沒有枉過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師陳世傑陳詞指，鄒屬於「積極參加者」，但他基於錯誤法律意見犯案；而鄒現正就立會暴動案服刑，望法庭避免判處壓毀性刑罰。陳最後又特別提到，本案被告是好人，只是不幸在錯誤的地點和時間出現，當中包括醫生、律師等，懷着良好意願參選、非為私利，並非真正意義上的罪犯，望法庭能法外開恩，「在這宗案，寬容是有必要的」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;七一遊行雨傘運動為關心社會契機-盼建更公義社會&quot;&gt;七一遊行、雨傘運動為關心社會契機 盼建更公義社會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑讀出鄒求情信部分內容。據《獨媒》取得的求情信（全文見文末），鄒家成指自己出身基層、一家七口靠綜緩渡日，15歲時照顧患病的父親，令他培養出對弱者的關懷和同理心。父親病逝後，他奮發圖強讀書，最終如願入讀大學修讀護理，準備日後成為護士，幫助社會上像其父親那樣無法自理的病者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同是15歲那年，鄒跟隨師兄首次參加七一遊行，自言「我深深為人們對公義的追求及對弱勢社群的關懷所震撼」，也覺醒到其家庭的困境是數十萬家庭共同面對的問題，現象背後是社會結構性不公。鄒形容，那次遊行成為他關心社會、積極參與公民事務的契機，「只要有能力，我就希望幫助弱勢，令香港成為一個更好、更公義的社會」，他之後每年也會參與遊行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，因着對社會的關懷，2014年雨傘運動亦不時抽空到場支持。有段時間，他每天放學便到金鐘由示威者搭建的自修室讀書、與其他人談及對香港未來的想像。鄒說，運動雖然失敗，未有爭取到港人渴求的民主政制，但卻更堅定他參與政治的決心，因為唯有建立到如美國前總統林肯所言真正「為人民服務的民選政府（government of the people, by the people, for the people）」，才有機會終結對弱者的壓迫、為社會帶來公義。而雨傘運動也令他相信透過公民參與，「我們的確有改變社會、推動公義的能力」。鄒直言：「這份信念，就是我當年參選的初衷，並無異心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;無意違反國安法基於對人民責任繼續參選&quot;&gt;無意違反《國安法》、基於對人民責任繼續參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續表示，他參政「就是希望為民發聲」，加強在野民主派在議會內的實力，制衡非民選的行政機關，為實現真正民主化帶來可能。他從未相信35+的可能性，但始終深信民主的價值，即使為爭民主而身陷囹圄，仍信「為人民服務的民選政府」終有一天必將降臨香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，「由始至終，我根本無意違反《國安法》，亦想像不了參選本身原來已構成危害國安。」《國安法》生效後他一度萌生退選念頭，驅使他繼續參選的，「是自覺身為政治人物所肩負對人民的責任」，「我懼怕，倘若連參選人都臨陣退縮，香港只會被恐懼的情緒籠罩，公民社會一沉百踩。我不忍心退選，我無法離群眾而去。」因此在刪去所有有機會被視為違反《國安法》的宣傳內容後繼續「與民同行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指今天的他與15歲相比，起了不少變化，但自言初心始終不變，「我依然相信民主與公羲，依然關懷弱者，依然希望香港能變得更加好，大家能過上更有尊嚴的生活。」鄒指在獄中的幾年，「努力讀書，努力修身，努力修心」，學習改善跟家人的關係，學習降伏憤怒與不滿，學習何為無條件的愛，「這一切，都只為貫徹15歲以來所走的道路，毋忘初心」。鄒最後說，不知道距離重獲人身自由還有多久，「我只盼在踏出監獄的一刻，能自豪地跟大家說：『這些年我都沒有枉過』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指鄒基於錯誤法律意見犯案-屬積極參加者&quot;&gt;辯方指鄒基於錯誤法律意見犯案 屬「積極參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑陳詞指，鄒家成被錯誤的法律意見所誤導、基於對法律的無知犯案，有人甚至說，戴耀廷作為一個法律學者，可能比律師有更好的法律意見，但《國安法》後對初選是否合法存有不確定性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳接納，法庭判刑時可參考刑期分級制，並可視鄒家成為刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」。陳指，鄒在案中非關鍵人物、可有可無，對計劃無真正幫助；他不迴避鄒發起「墨落無悔」聲明，但強調文件屬多餘（superfluous）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指鄒犯案時年輕不成熟&quot;&gt;辯方指鄒犯案時年輕、不成熟&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續提到鄒的背景，指形容他為激進是太過嚴苛和錯誤，認為鄒提倡香港民族理念，不應被視為加刑因素。陳又指，鄒並非提倡暴力對抗中國，只是對抗因殖民時代遺留下來的不公制度，望法庭考慮犯案時他只是20多歲，在2019年社會不穩下，作為「熱血青年」，不知道世界現實上如何運作，只以他所知的對錯向前衝如蠻牛（mad bull），但他並非為個人私利，而是為香港人的利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，考慮到鄒的愚蠢、不成熟、沒有足夠資訊（ill-informed），社會當時又經歷多人參與的示威，鄒很容易被社會的高漲情緒所蒙蔽，但他已得到了教訓。陳又指，鄒之所以在協調會議和社交平台大聲疾呼（vociferous），均顯示他對他所相信是對的事的決心和渴望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒另涉立會案-辯方指同出於對基本法不滿-望考慮整體情況減刑&quot;&gt;鄒另涉立會案 辯方指同出於對《基本法》不滿 望考慮整體情況減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，鄒雖因七一立會暴動案被捕，但於本案提控後，才於2021年3月就立會案提堂，並於2023年8月去信表示認罪。陳指，兩案性質均是政治，表達出鄒家成對《基本法》的不滿，鄒在立會案的行為包括撕毀《基本法》，因認為沒有妥當落實，以此表達他的沮喪，這亦是他參選的原因。陳又指，鄒於該案刑期逾5年，已服出代價，並預計於一年半內服刑完畢，望法庭考慮整體量刑原則而減刑，避免判處壓毀性（crushing effect）的刑罰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指本案被告是好人-寬容是有必要&quot;&gt;辯方指本案被告是好人 寬容是有必要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑最後指，經歷近120審訊、及過去一個月的求情，他希望說，「在正常情況下，本案被告是好人，只是不幸地在錯誤的地點和時間出現（In normal circumstances, these are good people, unfortunately, they found themselves in the wrong place, at the wrong time.）」。陳指，本案被告來自社會不同界別，具有重要和成功的地位，像是醫生、律師、航空業、衞生界、立法會議員、社工和有抱負的學生，他們懷着良好意願參與運動，非為私利，但突然全變成非法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳比喻，《國安法》生效時，被告就像在一架失控的車上，以其自身動力高速前進，所有人都需要面對很長的刑期，也對個人生活有很毀滅性的後果，不僅影響他們自己，也影響他們身邊的人。陳續說，這是他個人的看法，並望法庭考慮，「35+計劃」是由一班業餘人士（amateur）聚起來，嘗試如專業人士般行事，計劃若不是注定失敗、也只有很少機會實現，甚至可說是「蠢得可笑（farcical）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又說，除了首5名被告，沒有任何其他被告有資格停止「35+計劃」，只有組織者有資格和責任這樣做，但最後沒有這樣做。法官李運騰說，他們選擇「跳船（jump）」，陳同意，指他們只是自己跳船。陳又說，法官對處理嚴重罪犯有經驗，但本案被告不是真正意義上的罪犯，望法庭能法外開恩，「寬容是本案的關鍵，尤其在這宗案，寬容是有必要的（mercy is warrant）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒女友鄒正直善良身陷囹圄仍努力學習思考&quot;&gt;鄒女友：鄒正直善良、身陷囹圄仍努力學習思考&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦呈上鄒家成女友求情信（全文見文末）。據《獨媒》取得的信件，女友指與鄒相識三年多，鄒是她遇過「最正直善良、堅韌和有承擔的人」，她過去一年抑鬱症病發，鄒在探訪和書信靜心聆聽她的經歷，分擔其苦痛，即使被高牆阻隔，「我依然從他身上獲得沒間斷的正念，他成為我拼命活著、提升自己的一大動力」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;女友指，即使鄒身陷囹圄，但從不鬆懈，仍努力學習、保持思考，每天看書、讀報、唸經、打坐等，讀過的每本書都有筆跡和讀後感，信件很多關於對生命和學習的反思，亦依舊關心社會和世界，近至安達臣道塌天秤意外的遺孤，遠至加沙戰火中受苦的人民，都看見他們的苦痛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;女友鄒投身政治非為私利學佛盼實踐無條件的愛&quot;&gt;女友：鄒投身政治非為私利、學佛盼實踐無條件的愛&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;女友指，鄒2020年末起篤信佛教，在牆內一直專注修行，變得比以往更慈悲、強大，也學會從容地接受苦難、放下貪執和仇恨，鄒指當下最希望可以實踐「無條件的愛」，由伴侶出發，繼而愛家人、身邊的朋友，乃至理念不同的人。而鄒因無法從護理系學士畢業，望出獄後赴外國進修取得學位，彌補遺憾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;女友指，鄒投身政治從來並非為一己私利，僅是因為他無法離群眾而去、無法離自己心愛的城市而去，真誠盼着她終有一天變好。女友表示，感激這個美好的相遇，會繼續堅定地在路上陪鄒面對每個難關、互相扶持，一起成為更好的人，善良如初。她由衷希望鄒和他所愛的人能早日重聚，懇請法官能予他及早重啟人生的機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成求情信全文&quot;&gt;鄒家成求情信全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今日我希望向閣下分享我在15歲那年發生的兩件事情。它們對我的生命有著深刻的影響，能協助閣下更透徹地理解今日站在你們面前的第37被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首先是我父親的病逝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我出生自基層家庭。自我有記憶以來，父親一直惡病纏身。失去經濟支柱，我們一家七口很長一段時間只能依靠綜援度日。然而，由於他早年經常對其他家庭成員暴力相向，弄得家中永無寧日，即使後來他病情惡化要人院，家中除了母親之外也沒若麼人會去探望他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在我15歲那年的某一日，醫生批准他出院。踏進家門的一刻，看到昔日那個動不動就大發雷霆的家暴者，如今卻成了一個駝著背、瘦骨嶙峋、每走一步都相當吃力的老病人，我曾經內心對他的恨意頓時全消，只想讓眼前的人在生命最後的時光能過上更有尊嚴的生活。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;一方面是為了父親，另一方面也是為了分擔母親的辛勞，自那一天起，我每日放學便會幫忙照顧他，砌病床，分配菓物、餵食飯、幫忙洗澡…..大概就是這段日子，我漸漸培養出對弱者的關懷和同理心。只要尚有一絲餘力，我都希望盡我所能使他們少一點痛苦，過上更好一點的生活。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不久，他就病逝了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不再需要回家照顧父親，每日放學後我改到自修室讀書。發奮圖強，只為成為一個更有能力的人，幫助更多弱者。最終，我如願入讀大學，修讀護理，準備日後成為一名護士，幫助社會上無數像我父親當年那樣無法自理的病者。我還記得收到大學錄取通知的那一天，母親笑得特別燦爛。我知這，我正走在上對的這路。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一件對我影響深遠的事情是我首次的公民參與。15歲那年，在忙於照顧父親的期間，機緣巧合之下我跟隨一位中學師兄第一次參加「七一遊行」。在遊行隊伍中，縱使天氣炎熱、人群擠擁，我深深為人們對公義的追求及對弱勢社群的關懷所震憾。我覺醒到我家庭所面對的困境絕非我們一家七口獨有，而是數以十萬計家庭所共同面對的問題。現象背後，更是有著社會的結構性不公。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當時我年紀尚小，未懂得有條理地分析社會問題，更遑論是提出具建設性的解決方案。但那一次遊行卻成為了我關心社會，積極參與公民事務的契機。亦是在那一天開始，我對弱者的關懷更進一步拓展為對香港弱勢社群及被壓迫者的責任感。只要有能力，我就希望幫助弱勢，令香港成為一個更好、更公義的社會。自那天以後，每一年我都會參與遊行，風雨不改。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;亦因這份對社會的關懷，當香港在2014年爆發雨傘運動，即使忙於準備翌年的公開試，我也不時抽空到現場支持運動。有段時間，每天放學就身穿校服背著書包，走到金鐘由示威者搭建的自修室讀書，再與其他示威者聊天談著對香港未來的想像，就成了我每天的日常。就結果而言，運動是失敗的，我們未有爭取到香港人渴求的民主政制。但對我而言，這場運動卻是更加堅定了我參與政治的決心，因為唯有建立到如美國前總統林肯所言的一個真正「為人民服務的民選政府」(government of the people, by the people, for the people)，才有機會終結對弱者的壓迫，為社會帶來公義。更重要的是，這場運動使我相信透過公民參與，我們的確有改變社會、推動公義的能力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;這份信念，就是我當年參選的初衷，並無異心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如我作供時所說，我參政，就是希望為民發聲，加強在野民主派在議會內的實力，制衡非民選的行政機關，為實現真正民主化帶來可能。或許與其他人不同的是，我從未相信35+的可能性，但與不少香港人一樣，我始終深信民主的價值。即使今日我為爭取民主而身陷囹圄，但我仍然相信，這個「為人民服務的民選政府」終有一天必將降臨香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由始至終，我根本無意違反《國安法》，亦想像不了參選本身原來已構成危害國安。《國安法》生效之後，我一度萌生退選念頭，驅使我繼續競選的，是自覺身為政治人物所肩負對人民的責任。我懼怕，倘若連參選人都臨陣退縮，香港只會被恐懼的情緒籠罩，公民社會一沉百踩。我不忍心退選，我無法離群眾而去。於是，在刪去所有有機會被視為違反《國安法》的宣傳內容後，我決定重新上路，與民同行，走完最後一段初選之路。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今日的我跟15歲時相比，歷練固然多了，對自身及世界的理解也因此有了不少變化。但我的初心始終不變。我依然相信民主與公義，依然關懷弱者，依然希望香港能變得更加好，大家能過上更有尊嚴的生活。在獄中的這幾年，我努力讀書，努力修身，努力修心。我學習改善跟家人的關係，學習降伏憤怒與不滿，學習安忍，學習懺侮，學習和諧與平靜，學習慷慨，學習何為無條件的愛。這一切，都只為貫徹15歲以來所走的道路，毋忘初心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我不知這自己距離重獲人身自由還有多久，我只盼在踏出監獄的一刻，能自豪地跟大家說：「這些年我都沒有枉過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2024年7月15日&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成女友求情信全文&quot;&gt;鄒家成女友求情信全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本人與鄒家成相識三年多，並發展成情侶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成是我的伴侶，是我最好的朋友，也是我遇過最正直善良、堅韌、謙卑和有承擔的人。他富有同理心，善於感受他人之苦，也從不吝嗇對受苦的人的關懷，眼裡皆是眾生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;作為伴侶，他尊重我的每一個選擇，鼓勵並支持我出國進修、增值自己，期許我們再遇之時皆能成為更強大的人。他曾對我說：「我想和你一起面對內心和世界的挑戰。」而他說到做到。他在我人生最壞的日子穩穩地接住我一去年我的抑鬱症復發，他在探訪和書信中靜心聆聽我的經歷，分擔我的苦痛。他更鼓勵我偕他一起研讀佛教思想，學習修行。他願意包容我的不足，也時常提醒我要多作反思一一學習慈悲、安住正念、觀照內心、心存規律、活在當下，這都是我從他身上學會的事情。這段日子，儘管被高牆阻隔，但我依然從他身上獲得沒間斷的正念，他成為我拼命活著、提升自己的一大動力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;作為兒子，他為人顧家、孝順。他就讀中四那年，父親因病離世。而在其父患病臥床的那段日子，他為母親分擔作為照顧者的重擔一一洗澡、餵食飯、分配藥的份量，從而建立對護理的興趣。後來，他入讀香港都會大學護理系，立志成為一名護士。2021年還押期間，他申請保釋就是為了圓滿母親的心願—重尸難日卜在她面前戴著四方帽接過證書，走完一場畢業禮。保釋那段時間，他為家裡添置新傢俬，為自己安排好入獄的事宜，免讓家人操心。作為朋友，他博愛、慷慨、真誠待人。他時常關心朋友近況，善於將佛學思想套入生活，以自身經歷為朋友紓憂解困。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;家成身處牢獄已經三年。即使身陷囹圄，但他從不鬆懈，依然努力學習、保持思考，在泥濘中一步步前行。在獄中的日子，他堅持生活規律：每日看書、讀報紙、唸經、打坐、懺悔；每周做反思，總結學習目標、檢視進度。他著重自身改進，同時積極汲取及鑽研知識一一佛學、政治哲學、經濟、歷史、英語、寫作。他在監倉讀過的每本書，每頁都有筆跡，還有用間尺劃下重點的橫線；之後他會寫低十多頁筆記，再寫讀後感；有不理解的地方，他會把握每次探訪時間虛心向前輩請教。我們的信件中，很多也是關於他對生命和學習的反思，有時他更會向我分享閲讀感想，並邀請我給他反饋，不會放過每一個進步的機會。他依舊關心社會、關心世界：近至安達臣道塌天秤意外的遺孤，遠至加沙戰火中受苦的人民，他都能看見他們的苦痛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;三年前他因為官司纏身，最終無法以護理系學士身分畢業。他希望在出獄後能赴外國升學進修，取得一個自己心儀的學位，彌補當日的遺憾。而他在獄中勤於自學多種知識、專注鑽硏佛學，就是為離開監獄這一天做好準備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;家成由2020年末起篤信佛教，至今三年多。對他來說，佛是智慧、慈悲和力量。佛教中有一句話：「菩薩不住相布施，其福德不可思量」，他矢志以「無分別心」幫助別人，不計較付出和回報。身處牆內三年，他一直專注修行，變得比以往更慈悲、強大，也學會從容地接受苦難、放下貪執和仇恨。他告訴我，當下最希望的是可以實踐「無條件的愛」一一由伴侶出發，繼而愛家人，愛身邊的朋友，乃至愛理念不同的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;生於斯，長於斯。家成和很多年輕人一樣，於香港土生土長27年，與這片土地一起歷盡高低跌宕，也會關心社會時政。不同的是，他將自我實踐扣連社會公義，奮不顧身地站到浪尖上。他投身政治從來並非為一己私利，僅僅是因為他無法離群眾而去，無法離自己心愛的城市而去，真誠地盼著終有一天她能變得更好，這點並無因為時間流轉而改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我和鄒家成由相識到相戀，大部分相處時間都是隔著高牆、探訪室的玻璃，對話只能透過會計時倒數的電話筒，或需要等候多時的書信一一思念變得具體而殘酷。儘管如此，我依然感激這個美好的相遇。我會繼續堅定地在路上陪伴他面對每個難關、互相扶持彼此，在他出獄之時一起成為更好的人，善良如初。而我深信這天到來時，他擁有的會比失去的多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;愛別離苦，我由衷希望家成和他所愛的人能早日重聚，亦懇請法官能夠給予他及早重啟人生的機會，不要讓他失去希望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2024年7月9日&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zmWCVFP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（2日）處理最後一批、新界東9名被告的求情。其中楊岳橋由其師傅、資深大律師蔡維邦代表求情，指楊在90年代舉家移民加拿大，在當地大學畢業之後，便前往北京修讀法學碩士，因為熱愛中國文化和歷史。蔡指從立法會投票紀錄可見，楊並非主張阻撓議會運作的議員（obstructionist），並提到楊在較早階段表達認罪意向，其後在警方的邀請下提供證人口供，顯示楊完全的悔意。蔡庭上讀出楊親筆撰寫的求情信，稱作為一名大律師，為自己干犯刑事罪行而感到難堪，犯案是完全錯誤和不理智；他強調自己日後不會再涉足公共事務，沒有任何重犯機會。至於陳志全，其代表大律師馬維騉指他在本案參與程度低，過往是一名勤奮和盡責的立法會議員，在任期間積極地替性小眾利益發聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋求情稱赴北京升學因熱愛中國文化和歷史&quot;&gt;楊岳橋求情稱赴北京升學因熱愛中國文化和歷史&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前公民黨立法會議員楊岳橋由其師傅、資深大律師蔡維邦代表作求情。蔡指楊出生於1981年，現年43歲，他在90年代跟隨家人移民到加拿大，並於2002年在當地的大學畢業，之後赴北京大學升學，修讀法學碩士。就當時而言，相比起到西方國家如美國和英國，前往中國內地讀書並非20年前人們的優先選項，惟楊願意踏出安舒區，在北京研習憲法及行政法學，不是為了建立有價值的事業，而是因為對中國文化和歷史的熱愛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡指，事實上楊十分欣賞中國文化和藝術，每逢農曆新年都會替人寫揮春，而且品質不錯。楊回到香港後，繼續修畢法律專業證書（P.C.LL.）課程，其後於2009年成為大律師。他最終於2016年的立法會補選中當選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋求情稱非主張阻撓議會或激進派別&quot;&gt;楊岳橋求情稱非主張阻撓議會或激進派別&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡指，從立法會投票紀錄可見，楊並非主張阻撓議會運作的議員（obstructionist）。在2018年8月，他與時任立法會（資訊科技界）議員莫乃光到訪美國矽谷灣區考察，事後收到感謝信。蔡指楊相信香港政府具透明度和有效率，會使香港成為一個合適外國投資的城市，楊亦向國際宣傳香港，鼓勵美國機構駐守香港及投資，指香港有法治制度、實行普通法，香港會在數碼時代裡擔任電子產業的軸心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡續指，雖然楊作為政治人物，屬於泛民主派，但是他並非主張阻撓議會或激進派別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方透露楊曾提供證人口供予警方&quot;&gt;辯方透露楊曾提供證人口供予警方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡指，楊於2021年2月因本案還柙，他隨即在同年3月退出公民黨，並與黨友溝通指公民黨應該解散。楊日後不希望再涉足政治，只想做一個平凡公民，顯示他的重犯機會是零。在他過往擔任議員期間，他致力服務不同市民，即使在工餘時間也會協助不同社群解決法律疑難。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡強調，楊在較早階段表達認罪意向，是最大求情因素。其法律代表早於2021年9月去信律政司表達認罪意向，之後於同年11月向法庭表示會認罪。在2022年6月，楊在交付高院的聆訊中承認控罪，乃表示悔意的典型表現。蔡並提到，楊在警方的邀請下提供口供，雖然最終控方未有傳召他為證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，楊協助警方這項因素會被納入在認罪扣減之中。蔡則回應指，這顯示楊完全的悔意，並會用盡一切方法去協助警方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊岳橋親撰求情信對自己作為大律師干犯刑事罪行感到難堪&quot;&gt;楊岳橋親撰求情信：對自己作為大律師干犯刑事罪行感到難堪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡呈上由楊岳橋於今年8月16日親筆撰寫的求情信，他在信中表示，作為一名大律師，為自己干犯刑事罪行而感到難堪。他有機會在還柙期間回望自己的從政生涯，當初從政是為了使香港變得更好，惟盲目的反政府心態，導致當時的政治境況惡化。他又表示，很後悔未有及時從否決財政預算案的計劃抽身，而且自己的錯誤行為亦導致公民黨黨友加入這個錯誤和無望的計劃，相信案件為黨友的家人帶來焦慮和壓力，他為此感到抱歉，並強調自己犯案是完全錯誤和不理智。他強調自己日後不會再涉足公共事務，沒有任何重犯機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於蔡強調被告的參與程度應取決於他們在2020年7月1日之後的行為，法官李運騰則表示，雖然控罪時期乃由7月1日開始，但是楊在7月1日之前頗為積極參與「35+」計劃，這點辯方不能否認，而法庭可由此考慮楊意志堅決。辯方則指，在7月1日，即國安法生效之後，楊的參與行為就只有3項，包括在初選中投票、擺街站及提交立法會參選提名表格。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡又指，雖然楊岳橋在2020年3月已擔任公民黨黨魁，但是他在黨內仍然是年資較淺的立法會議員，所以崗位上只屬政黨的發言人，而不是黨內的主要推手。法官陳慶偉則明言，不會接受這方面的陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡總結指楊屬「積極參與者」，量刑起點應介乎3至10年的幅度，並且應該採用該幅度的中間點，冀法庭給予認罪的全數三分一扣減，亦希望能基於楊長期服務社群而給予進一步扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指陳志全參與程度低任議員期間積極地替性小眾利益發聲&quot;&gt;辯方指陳志全參與程度低、任議員期間積極地替性小眾利益發聲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉指，陳不是組織者或策劃者，僅屬於「積極參與者」，而且在國安法生效之前，陳在本案的參與程度已是相對低，他並沒有出席任何「35+」記者會，也沒有參與協調會議，在 WhatsApp 群組中，除了曾經回覆「thank you」之外，其餘時間都是「已讀不回」。在國安法生效之後，陳的參與程度更加低，他並沒有出席7月6日的民間論壇或7月15日的抗爭派記者會，僅進行自己的競選活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬指，在案發期間，陳志全任職立法會議員，並且以勤奮和盡責的態度履行職責，冀法庭基於此接受陳有良好品格。馬指，陳的妹妹和配偶均替他撰寫求情信，形容陳為孝子、關愛的兄長和有愛的伴侶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又指，從大量朋友的求情信可見，陳是一名勤奮的立法會議員，過往積極地替性小眾利益發聲，亦有前政府官員替他撰寫求情信，綜合以上，冀法庭酌情減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其他被告分別被安排在第一庭和第二庭觀看直播，在第一庭的被告包括：王百羽、伍健偉、岑子杰、岑敖暉、黃之鋒、梁晃維、吳政亨和馮達浚。在第二庭旁聽的被告包括余慧明、黃子悅、袁嘉蔚、黃碧雲和吳敏兒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今（2日）處理最後一批、新界東9名被告的求情。林卓廷一方指，林的參與程度屬最低，他無出席協調會議、其代表亦在會上反對否決，林無簽署「墨落無悔」聲明、無提過否決預算案，一直是傳統民主派，支持一國兩制、香港回歸中國，望法庭考慮他為判監3年以下的「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表范國威的大律師吳靄儀則強調，否決程序為《基本法》所容許，又指本案謀劃非常公開，加上政府有「大殺傷力武器」可DQ參選人，謀劃不可能實現，望法庭考慮情況特殊而減刑。吳又指，范獲西貢區議會前主席吳仕福、前立法局主席黃宏發撰求情信，讚揚他務實無私及對地區民生的貢獻，庭上並呈上范3年前為街坊所畫牛年年畫；范的女兒亦形容他是「最好的爸爸」。辯方指范望將一切抛諸腦後，專注家庭，望法庭視范為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」的較低程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林卓廷稱任內處理鉛水事件揭發圍標事件&quot;&gt;林卓廷稱任內處理鉛水事件、揭發圍標事件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷的沈士文指，林是一名傳統和典型的民主黨黨員，從其往績和控方證人區諾軒的證供可印證。林任職立法會議員期間，曾揭發私人屋苑工程圍標情況，推動「反圍標」運動，涉事沙田屋苑居民亦撰寫求情信，講述林引起公眾關注圍標的非法行為。後來《競爭法》立法，林在立法會也是推手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，林作為民主黨長期黨員，受到何俊仁邀請下擔任黨內秘書處職務，何亦有替林撰寫求情信。此外，民主黨前立法會議員張文光和劉慧卿，以及現正在海外留學的兒子，均有替林撰寫求情信。林的母親則讚揚林是孝子，經常到赤柱探訪兒子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈續指，林的參與程度可說是眾被告中最低，他對於達成協議無差別否決預算案沒有任何興趣，亦無親自出席任何新東協調會議，對於涉案計劃全程不熱衷，代表他出席會議的黨友亦在會上表明不認同否決預算案，導致新東在會議結束後並未就否決達成共識，是在首被告戴耀廷推動下才最終達成協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈又指，林無簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，也不曾於選舉單張和社交平台提及否決預算案，他亦不認同「攬炒」或解散立法會等主張。林在初選論壇受到激進派候選人的施壓時，更反問若政府在預算案中承諾向每名香港市民派3萬元，如何投反對票，可見他並非積極參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈指，林定罪是因搜出論壇筆記，以及時任民主黨主席胡志偉言論，以「共謀者原則」入罪，辯方尊重法庭的裁決，但必須強調林在本案的「串謀」中，角色非常輕微，認為林應屬「其他參加者」，即監禁3年以下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指林卓廷是傳統和典型的民主黨黨員-支持香港回歸中國和一國兩制&quot;&gt;辯方指林卓廷是傳統和典型的民主黨黨員 支持香港回歸中國和「一國兩制」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈強調，林是一名傳統和典型的民主黨黨員，從不激進，他跟從傳統民主派的立場，包括支持香港回歸中國和「一國兩制」的《基本法》概念，民主黨亦常與政府合作。而林自2016年起任立法會議員，紀錄顯示他非常勤奮，贊成的議案多於反對議案，指林無差別否決是與多年往績完全不符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈另交代林的定罪紀錄，林就2018年「一地兩檢」會議衝突案，承認一項妨礙正在執行職責的立法會人員罪，在2022年12月被判囚3周，已服刑完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳靄儀涉案謀劃公開政府可dq-不可能實現&quot;&gt;吳靄儀：涉案謀劃公開、政府可DQ 不可能實現&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表范國威的大律師吳靄儀，採納其他大狀的法律陳詞，認為本案並非顛覆國家政權罪最嚴重。吳又指，本案非常特殊，整個計劃非常公開、有大量文件記載（well-documented），令計劃埋下自我毀滅的種子。而被告雖稱否決權為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，但要達成的前提是有「35+」，然而行政機關也有「大殺傷力武器」去抗衡，選舉主任可以DQ參選人，本案31名參選被告中便有9人被DQ，計劃無可能實現。吳又指，即使有Plan B，該些參選人同樣會因其主張而被DQ；而政府最後也宣布押後選舉，被告根本無機會當選；即使立法會解散，特首也能批出短期撥款，法庭判詞提到的後果很難會出現。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 范國威&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，假若吳靄儀是正確，為何協調會議要討論替補機制、甚至有「Plan C」，吳重申，即使有Plan B、Plan C，政府也能DQ，或者他們根本無機會勝出；又指以否決預算案爭取五大訴求，政府拒絕回應，終致特首下台，是《基本法》允許的情況，「我們的憲制沒有那麼脆弱」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又指，根據《基本法》，即使立法會因否決預算案而解散，仍須經歷另一次選舉，否決同一份預算案，特首才須辭職，並指政府若選擇將同一份預算案呈上立法會、而不作任何改動是很奇怪，舉例若政府選擇派錢，新選出的立會有可能通過，相關程序的結果無法預視。吳重申，根據客觀事實，能否肯定同一班人會再當選、政府會提出原案、民主派會再否決該份預算案，均未可知，如法庭不能肯定謀劃會成功便應減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉主動提到，初選有逾61萬人投票，若謀劃不會成功，選民是否被騙：「你看，他們被承諾，投票可為香港政局帶來改變」，質疑被告若認為計劃不可能實現，是無向選民說出真相。吳指，難以知道所有選民投票的原因，並強調政府有責任維持穩定，對於謀劃公開、但政府容許投票發生而沒採取行動感到非常驚訝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳靄儀量刑時不應考慮國安法前行為-官明言拒納&quot;&gt;吳靄儀：量刑時不應考慮《國安法》前行為 官明言拒納&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳續指，被告於《國安法》生效前行為並不構成罪行，認為判刑時不能就《國安法》前的行為懲罰他們。法官李運騰指，人的思想不會一夜改變，除非有證據顯示被告的改變，否則被告《國安法》前的行為，可用作推論他《國安法》後的心態和參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳強調，《國安法》無追溯力，認為此前行為只可用來證明串謀存在、及被告是謀劃的參與者，但不能用來衡量其罪責，並因此而加刑。法官陳慶偉指，他不能接納這一點，早前求情亦已向代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明表達；又問吳是望法庭不考慮范國威《國安法》前哪一些行為。吳坦言，此爭論與范關係不太大，是原則的爭議，並指范在初選並非組織者或發起人，只是出席協調會議和參加初選，參與較低。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;范獲民建聯吳仕福前立法局主席黃宏發撰求情信&quot;&gt;范獲民建聯吳仕福、前立法局主席黃宏發撰求情信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳續談及范的個人背景，指他在美國修讀藝術，對政治感興趣，自2000年起擔任21年西貢區議員，並曾任立法會議員6年，指范非常務實，專注改善地區民生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又呈上民建聯西貢區議會前主席吳仕福的求情信，指范會議出席率顯示他的勤奮，他曾在區議會就區內事務推動超過300項議案。范又獲前立法局主席黃宏發撰求情信，指范十分務實、無私，為將軍澳區發展有很大貢獻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另呈上多封街坊和同事撰寫的求情信，形容范是很受歡迎的議員，為居民改善生活。吳又呈上一幅范於3年前牛年為街坊所畫的畫，街坊憶述當時天氣寒冷，范手指僵硬仍作畫，不想令街坊失望，辯方指顯示范希望為街坊帶來快樂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方范望將一切抛諸腦後&quot;&gt;辯方：范望將一切抛諸腦後&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又呈上范的母親、姐姐和女兒的求情信，范的女兒今年畢業，形容他為「每個女生所能渴求的最好的父親（the best father any girl can ask for）」，其母親亦讚他為好兒子，悉心照顧病重父親。吳指，范是「顧家的好男人（good family man）」、勤奮務實，望將本案一切抛諸腦後，與家人相處（keep himself to family），沒有重犯機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳強調，范無意違法，他受誤導而犯案，已感到非常後悔，望法庭考慮他為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」的較低程度，因及時認罪、有悔意、良好品格和公共服務而減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7名被告今求情完畢，餘下呂智恆和林景楠明天求情。散庭時，范國威向旁聽席以手指做心，又向律師雙手合十致謝。何桂藍則做出OK手勢，林卓廷則微笑舉起手掌。范國威、楊岳橋、陳志全申請明天不出庭獲批。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鍾雪瑩認藏槍囚7年4個月 官：接納為維繫與男友蘇緯軒關係而犯案&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZIy1Vlc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴7名被告。陪審團昨裁定6人罪脫，1人交替罪成。至於早前認罪的吳智鴻及鍾雪瑩，今（30日）於高等法院進行求情。吳押後再進一步求情，鍾則涉與在計劃中任槍手的男友蘇緯軒同住並藏有槍械，她承認「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪，被判囚7年4個月。法官張慧玲接納辯方指，鍾犯案是為了維繫與男友的情侶關係，而「今次犯案基本上係愛錯咗蘇緯軒」。張官考慮到無證據證明鍾使用槍械作非法用途，但肯定她必然知道男友躲藏是為逃避警方拘捕，故決定以10年監禁為量刑起點。無罪釋放的男被告張俊富及李家田今亦有到場旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳智鴻認串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸罪&quot;&gt;吳智鴻認「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;為12.8行動策劃者的吳智鴻（案發時24歲），承認「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪及「意圖危害生命而管有槍械或彈藥」罪；至於「串謀謀殺」罪則獲存檔法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方呈文件顯示吳品學兼優-官質疑小學幾優異都係假&quot;&gt;辯方呈文件顯示吳品學兼優 官質疑「小學幾優異都係假」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳身穿黑色西裝、戴眼鏡及紮馬尾，步出犯人欄，一度向旁聽親友點頭。吳由資深大律師謝志浩及大律師陳韋君代表。法官張慧玲表示，辯方沒有呈交「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪的案例，雖然大部分案例是英國，但原則上亦相同。張官要求辯方作出書面補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方呈上了吳的父母及未婚妻所撰寫的求情信。但張官不解為何辯方呈上一些與現時無關、遠至小學階段的信件，包括吳希望入讀香港華仁書院，並自行寫信予校長的文件。辯方解釋，希望反映吳是一名資優生，小學時品學兼優，父母對他有很大期望。張官指：「小學幾優異都係假」、「二十幾歲人，已經做緊嘢，講返小學做咩？」張官又批評辯方沒有篩選過文件便呈交予法庭。張官指將會押後再求情，以待辯方準備案例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾雪瑩認無牌管有槍械及彈藥罪&quot;&gt;鍾雪瑩認「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一被告鍾雪瑩（案發時29歲）承認「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪，案發時她為認罪被告兼污點證人蘇緯軒的女友。鍾身穿白色恤衫及灰色外套、戴眼鏡及紮馬尾，步出犯人欄。她自2020年10月被捕後還柙至今近4年。鍾由大律師陳永豪及陳濟洲代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;案情指鍾與男友兼槍手蘇緯軒同住-單位內有兩支槍&quot;&gt;案情指鍾與男友兼槍手蘇緯軒同住 單位內有兩支槍&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案情指，蘇被指派在12.8行動之中擔任槍手，射擊警務人員，他管有一支手槍、一支 AR15 長槍及大量彈藥。但最後串謀者被捕故行動夭折。蘇與鍾為情侶關係，他們於2019年12月16日帶同槍械遷入翠屏花園躲藏。直至20日，警方尾隨兩人離開翠屏花園，並將他們截停。當警長捉住蘇的右臂時，他突然轉身逃跑，同時在腰間拔出手槍上膛，向警長開一槍。警長及時按下蘇的右臂，子彈沒有打中。於21日，警方在搜屋時發現一支長槍裝上瞄準裝置、8個裝有逾200發彈藥的彈匣，以及防彈背心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警員其後亦拘捕鍾雪瑩，她在警誡下表示，自己任職設計師，陳玉龍於2019年8月介紹蘇予她認識。蘇因為與家人吵架而遷至藏身處，並叫鍾同住。蘇被捕後，鍾因驚慌故收拾東西離開，前往朋友「阿龍」的住所。她又指槍械屬於蘇，自己並不知道用途。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方求情若犯案是為維繫愛侶感情可行使酌情權&quot;&gt;辯方求情：若犯案是為維繫愛侶感情，可行使酌情權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方求情指，涉案槍械及彈藥並非由鍾購買，她只是跟隨男友，其角色被動，並非始作俑者。辯方又呈上案例指，若法庭接納犯罪是因維繫家人及愛侶的感情，或被他們利用，則可行使酌情權。辯方又指，沒有證據證明鍾直接接觸或使用涉案槍械作非法用途，亦未能證明她知道12.8行動，以及男友管有槍械的意圖。辯方又提及，雖然鍾在2018年因非法集結罪被判囚4星期，但希望法庭不要因此加刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方鍾還柙期間改過已經向善&quot;&gt;辯方：鍾還柙期間改過、已經向善&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，辯方指在獄中傳道的牧師對鍾的嘉許正面，鍾母則讚女兒孝順、有愛心及樂於助人。辯方總結指，鍾面對案件期間多次流淚並掙扎，更改過並進修充實自己，現時是「已經向善嘅鍾雪瑩」。張官卻認為，即使鍾在羈留期間向善，但判刑時仍然應該以控罪性質為重，並需要向社會大眾發出需要嚴懲的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，鍾被捕後被控「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪，於2021年一度被改控更嚴重的「意圖危害生命而管有槍械或彈藥」罪，當時她不認罪。最後與律政司認罪協商後，改為承認「無牌管有槍械及彈藥」罪。辯方希望法庭採納10年或以下的量刑起點，並給予25%減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾患混合焦慮抑鬱症-需到精神科覆診&quot;&gt;鍾患混合焦慮抑鬱症 需到精神科覆診&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官考慮約一小時後判刑，並讀出鍾的背景。鍾現時33歲，童年時期被欺負導致有抑鬱症狀，她於19歲時被戀人欺騙後，一度打算自殘。直至2014年她到屯門醫院精神科求醫，被診斷患適應障礙症。其後曾向私家醫生求醫，但經濟上未能負擔而放棄。鍾在羈留期間情緒低落，於2021年5月被診斷患混合焦慮抑鬱症，因此被安排繼續到精神科覆診，惟過往數月焦慮情況加劇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官接納為維繫關係而犯案-基本上係愛錯咗蘇緯軒&quot;&gt;官接納為維繫關係而犯案 「基本上係愛錯咗蘇緯軒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官判刑時表示，「明顯睇到你細個嘅經歷波動，唔係平穩。今次犯案基本上係愛錯咗蘇緯軒。」張官接納辯方指，鍾犯案為維繫與蘇緯軒的情侶關係，而鍾在羈留期間已嚐失去自由的滋味。張官指，欣賞鍾在求情信中沒有要求輕判，反而要求法庭判處她應得的懲罰。張官表示，控罪最高刑罰為14年監禁，犯案明顯對公眾及社會帶來很大危險，因此阻嚇性刑罰是無可避免。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官槍械非隨身攜帶無證據證明作非法用途&quot;&gt;官：槍械非隨身攜帶、無證據證明作非法用途&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官考慮案情時指，雖然涉案槍械彈藥並非隨身攜帶，但卻放在床下，沒有覆蓋和收好，有機會讓歹徒取得並使用。本案中沒有證據證明槍械已裝上子彈，亦無證據顯示鍾用作非法用途。但張官肯定鍾必然知道男友躲藏是為逃避警方拘捕，亦曾目睹他開槍射向警察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官考慮鍾真心悔改-減刑兩個月&quot;&gt;官考慮鍾真心悔改 減刑兩個月&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官決定以10年監禁為量刑起點。她指不會因鍾過往的非法集結案底而加刑，至於減刑方面則給予25%扣減，即判囚7年半。張官另考慮到鍾真心悔改、羈留期間有正面改變，以及重犯機會微，因此減刑兩個月，共判囚7年4個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conference report is based on the discussions which occurred during a one-day workshop held in September 2023 at RUSI’s headquarters in London, attended by a range of representatives from defence companies and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD). The purpose of the workshop was to identify early opportunities to set the conditions for integration across the joint force. The workshop examined where and how the MoD, the armed services and, especially, UK Strategic Command (StratCom) and its new Integration Design Authority (IDA) can achieve immediate results to galvanise the broader effort to deliver the stated aspiration of providing “integration as a service”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop focused on the questions of how different actors, both past and present, have approached the challenge of data integration, and sought to examine which transferable lessons might be drawn from precedents from both the world of defence and beyond it, in areas such as the financial sector. This report, based on the workshop and subsequent secondary literature review, examines the immediate steps that the MoD can take to set the conditions for a broader effort to achieve multi-domain integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key deduction from the day’s discussions was that if, as is likely to be the case, software-driven evolution will play an important role in determining how the joint force fights, perhaps to an even greater degree than hardware adaptation, then it will be of considerable importance that frontline commands (FLCs) are able to cohere capability at all stages, even as the software is continually adapted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was noted that traces of this change are already visible in operational theatres such as Ukraine, where software can and must be adapted on a six-weekly basis to stay ahead of adversary cyber- and electronic-warfare capabilities; this rate far exceeds that of hardware replacement or adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the joint force is to operate across domains, FLCs must pursue iterative change in a coordinated manner. Consequently, the specific focus of the workshop was on achieving common data standards within defence. The workshop and subsequent research relied on historical case studies from both the UK and other nations to identify the drivers of success and failure in integration efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day’s discussions also examined the development of civilian networks, which have succeeded through the existence of standards sufficiently broad to enable change but well defined enough to allow for interoperability. The lessons derived are applicable to other areas where integration and standardisation of capabilities across all services is a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings&quot;&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key findings surfaced from the day’s discussions, and reinforced by a review of secondary literature, are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is limited precedent for successful integration on a top-down basis. Moreover, success has often involved procedures which – by virtue of their secrecy – existed outside normal procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In several areas there are strong service- and defence-level incentives to collaborate, but no individual service owns responsibility for an outcome. This separates operational from financial risk. Helping resolve these “tragedy of the commons” areas would allow the IDA to work with, rather than against, the grain of service imperatives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A common set of foundational standards which FLCs can use to drive the process of integration could serve as a starting point. Data standards are a key part of the foundations. Achieving standards in one area can create functional spill-overs (where integration in one area makes it difficult to function without integration in other areas, leading to a cascading process that eventually requires no top-down supervision).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenge-of-integration&quot;&gt;The Challenge of Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was discussed at the workshop, a number of factors can pose challenges to the effective integration of capabilities across the joint force. Among them are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tendency towards feature creep – the expansion of an integration effort to include more tasks than can reasonably be accomplished, thereby increasing complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An over-emphasis on technical capabilities, as opposed to specifying the operational requirements that justify the costs and complexities inherent to integration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Non-adoption or partial adoption of standards once they are created.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standards that act as barriers to entry for new capabilities because of their complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, it was noted that these challenges have been prominent features of previous UK efforts at joint force integration, particularly the Network Enabled Capability (NEC) programme, which began in the 2000s. The challenges that the UK has faced with the adoption of the NEC are in certain respects emblematic of the issues one may expect to encounter. As pointed out by one of the participants, the NEC was a victim of the fact that FLCs were not involved in articulating operational use cases. Moreover, the programme was not closely aligned at the enterprise level. Ideally, it would have encompassed both the relationships between different acquisition lines and areas such as operator education. It was noted that because NEC-related programmes were not situated within an operational use case, the costs were harder to justify within individual services where the benefit was not as great as for others. As a result, when services had to make trade-offs between individual NEC capabilities (such as a cooperative engagement) and other lines of effort, NEC capabilities were often sacrificed, scaled back or only partially adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case studies discussed at the workshop, such as the US Air Force’s Airborne Battle Management System (ABMS) programme, illustrate another major risk that integration efforts face: feature creep. The programme, which began as a replacement for the E-8 JSTARS, morphed into a wider effort to deliver an internet of things. While this development was not problematic in itself, the fact that use cases were driven by programme executive offices led to uncoordinated feature creep and cost increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those instances where effective top-down integration was achieved, notably the US Navy’s NIFC-CA programme, it was enabled by two things. First, a clear single service chain of command within a well-defined mission set allowed the US Navy to control requirements and enforce them. Second, as observed by a workshop participant who was involved in the rollout of the programme, the heavy classification of the programme meant that decision-making was restricted to a small number of individuals who had the authority to make and enforce systems engineering trade-offs (even though, in many cases, the reasons for specific requirements were not communicated to those charged with implementing them). Narrowing the group responsible for making decisions made it possible to avoid feature creep. Once established, requirements were imposed on engineers with little room for consultation, given the classifications involved, while the decision-makers’ authority could not be challenged. It was noted at the workshop that the ability to develop stringent requirements and ensure their adoption without pushback was only possible because many existing procedures for procuring and integrating capability were circumvented in a programme which was subject to highly centralised (and specific) processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants discussed the fact that that these criteria will be difficult to achieve outside very specific contexts. So instead of integrating specific platforms, a different approach to integration might be taken – one that uses the authorities of bodies such as StratCom to solve emerging tragedies of the commons, over which no individual service has effective control or responsibility. Participants agreed that where StratCom can add value as the “strategic integrator” is not by solving specific integration challenges as an external part of the programme, but rather by creating toolkits that allow integration to be driven by MoD Finance and Military Capability (FMC) using existing management systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections describe working use cases which might become a basis for focused support to cross-service integration by StratCom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opportunities-to-enable-cross-service-integration&quot;&gt;Opportunities to Enable Cross-Service Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several solutions emerged from the day’s discussions. First, the IDA could provide a mechanism to cohere capability if it more systematically informed the Defence Capability Risk Assessment Register (DCAR) process. Although the IDA does not have budgetary authority, it can provide FMC with information about which capability gaps can be closed through integrating existing or likely capabilities and which require additional capacity rather than integration. Through the IDA and leveraging its responsibilities for Defence Digital, StratCom can generate an information base regarding data standards, which FMC can then use to insert requirements into specific programmes. This might be analogised to the way in which consultancy firms are used by governments to fill gaps in both expertise and capacity. With a staff drawn from across the services and the capacity (through the Permanent Joint Headquarters) to assess the operational use cases for individual service capabilities, StratCom can provide FMC with the information needed to inform decisions regarding data standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was discussed at the workshop, the importance of a feedback loop between StratCom and FMC will become greater in the medium term, as the demands of integration will increasingly affect hardware. Most concepts for distributed operations, such as DARPA’s “STITCHES” Initiative, introduce considerable requirements for processing power to enable network integration and the translation of data at the tactical edge. This will in turn introduce size and cost requirements on platforms which StratCom and FMC can only drive in tandem. A model which is initially applied to data- and software-led development can then serve as a microcosm for a more ambitious system which will be needed in a 10-year timeframe. The model can enable StratCom and FMC to develop the procedures needed to coordinate with each other and the FLCs, and can introduce the services to new practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-a-market-of-standards&quot;&gt;Creating a Market of Standards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, it was noted that delivering the integration identified above could be facilitated immediately by creating a market of common standards which services can opt into for specific functions. In this way, StratCom could set the stage for future integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, if software-led integration is a priority, flexible standards will be essential. This has been observed in civilian networks, which are able to maximize their effectiveness through a combination of relatively specific bearer standards and much more flexible standards for transport and middleware layers of a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also observed that there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that backwards integration with open source software is possible, with examples from the world of integrated air and missile defence particularly prominent. It is possible to define broad parameters within which messages must fit and to then rely on middleware to translate data across the different formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that not all tasks will require comparable levels of data standardisation. For tasks such as electronic warfare, for example, the requirements for rapid updating and the stringency of security requirements impose a need for well-defined standards, which limit the amount of time needed to translate data across formats. Similarly, a particularly stringent set of standards could be adopted by the FLCs to share F-35 data while they might select different standards for other functions. Conversely, in other cases, such as joint logistics, a more flexible set of standards might be applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key determinant of the degree to which standards are necessarily stringent will likely be the degree to which network compromise can be expected, as pointed out during discussions regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine. Where network compromise is highly likely (for example, because platforms will operate within reach of adversary electronic warfare capabilities), it will probably be the case that data will need to be packaged in ways that enable encryption while balancing the trade-offs involved between encryption and latency. As was discussed at the workshop, this will be of particular importance when a decision is made to exploit civilian bandwidth for certain functions – the relative lack of security of the network layer makes the security of the messaging layer all the more important. In other instances, compromise may be likely but accepted as the cost of scalability – for example, when commercial off-the-shelf UAVs are being incorporated into force structures. Finally, there are some instances where the security of a network against different modes of compromise is sufficiently robust that risk can be accepted at the level of data. One example is communications using millimetric wave frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both discussions during the workshop and existing research suggest that the experience of organisations such as the International Organization for Standardization lends itself to the argument that a diverse set of voluntary standards can be effective in allowing agents to select standards that are best suited to enabling their operations. Rather than driving the process, StratCom and the IDA could generate multiple options which can be relevant to specific multi-domain tasks, from which FLCs can jointly select based on cross-service consultation. By resolving the informational challenge of generating options, Stratcom can narrow the set of options from which services can choose and provide them with an incentive to choose from the options it provides by removing the requirement to generate standards by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conclusion reached by participants was that where StratCom might add value is through the provision of a typology of trade-offs. Data standards could be categorised on whether they are designed to allow access to multiple network types, reduce latency or increase security – mindful of the fact that one can typically only achieve at most two of these three ideals. FLCs could then justify trading off one priority against others based on the demands of a specific operational requirement. For example, if forward reconnaissance elements of the force are expected to operate in communications-denied or -disrupted environments, they might opt to trade latency for the ability to securely use multiple modes of communication. Levels of encryption sufficient to pass data along multiple types of networks with different levels of vulnerability to compromise necessarily impose demands in terms of the TTPs and the size of data packages, meaning a cost in latency which precludes certain things such as the frequent use of full video links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;case-study-distributed-tactical-ledgers&quot;&gt;Case Study: Distributed Tactical Ledgers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final part of the workshop was based on group discussions of potential use cases. One area where participants identified the potential to achieve “quick wins” was the development of a system comparable to those based around distributed ledgers that have emerged in the world of finance. The key points that emerged from discussions around this use case are outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any system that requires coordinated collective action requires agents to have information about each other’s whereabouts, capabilities and obligations. For example, if an air defence interception is to be performed on a collaborative basis that might involve an Army-operated GBAD system, an RAF combat aircraft and a ship, it will be necessary to know what capabilities are held on each platform, how well suited they are to the task of an interception and how valuable it would be for each platform to perform the interception as opposed to another function. In other words, ledgers of both capabilities and the value of using a given capability in a specific way would be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was discussed in the breakout sessions, awareness currently existing at the theatre level includes the Recognised Air Picture (RAP) at a Combined Air Operations Centre (CAOC). However, if envisioned concepts of distributed operations are to be achieved, this awareness and capacity for collaboration must be pushed to the edge. One prerequisite for this is a shared set of standards by which information about available cross-domain blue forces and tasking orders can be shared locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in the breakout sessions agreed that the ability to task capabilities in a decentralised manner would require, at a minimum, both the ability of units to communicate their availability to nearby units from across the force, and a basis on which tasking requests might be either accepted or rejected. In the civilian world, applications such as Uber accomplish this through the broadcasting of data by taxis and the use of a price mechanism. However, this model is not directly transferrable to a military context. The constant broadcasting of data represents a security risk, while decisions about what a platform is tasked to do typically reflect the allocation of resources to a task by a higher authority through, for example, an air tasking order. However, many emerging concepts of operations, such as Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) and Mosaic Warfare, presume a comparable dynamic recombination of assets, with systems sometimes being tasked to a zone rather than a specific function. In a military context, communications would likely need to be local rather than broadcasted, because broadcasting availability creates risk and would rely on directional transmissions which, in turn, create a requirement for blue force tracking which would be difficult to assure in GPS denied environments. The requirement for accurate blue force tracking stems from the fact that to share data safely, as F-35s have done with US Marine Corps HIMARS batteries in tests, systems need to use Link 16 on directional antennae rather than relying on omni-directional broadcasts, which would reveal their positions. Directional transmissions require an accurate understanding of the location of a receiving antenna, which has been achieved in tests but which would be difficult to deliver in conflict. The need for blue force tracking incentivises an effort to leverage multiple networks, but this must be balanced against the requirement for security. In effect, there is something of a trade-off between the flexibility of a system in terms of the network it uses and the data used. The more flexible a system is at the network level, the more stringent data standards must be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a system would necessitate a shift from mission command to mission definition at the edge, as operators would exercise control over not only how they executed preset missions but also which tasks they opted to support. For example, an aircraft over a part of the battlefield for the purpose of SEAD may face a choice between engaging a SAM or broadcasting data to enable another system such as a GMLRS to engage another target. This requires the pilot to know how valuable the alternative target is regarding the ground forces mission set as opposed to the SAM, which could be otherwise engaged as part of the SEAD mission. In effect, a military analogue to a pricing mechanism is necessary for multi-domain operations, but it must be secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coordination of capabilities will require network standards that are sufficiently flexible to enable the use of multiple pathways, as well as data standards that are stringent enough to allow for tasking requests to be communicated securely, since multiple networks of varying reliability are being used in the face of adversary compromise. Also, a mechanism for assessing whether the application of a system to a task is appropriate given the system’s availability would be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this task is both complex and a multi-level system engineering task, the full extent of which should be the basis for subsequent discussions a first step towards such a system might involve delivering:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A distributed cross-domain system for tracking blue forces and delivering tasking orders without communications to higher echelon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A distributed system for assigning value to tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system of distributed ledgers would at a minimum require shared standards for indexing data about locations, capabilities and values, as well as voting protocols to enable changes to locations and target values without systemic risk. There are multiple network types which can support such a system. Area-wide communications networks, including civilian systems such as Starlink, might represent one mode. Alternatively, each platform in an area can communicate locally to update peers on its position, enabling them to pass this data further on to platforms adjacent to them. This could enable data to be “daisy chained” between adjacent systems to allow for broad situational awareness to be achieved without the constant broadcasting of data. Local communication with adjacent nodes can be achieved with low wavelength communications frequencies that are less susceptible to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In certain instances and use cases, particularly where situational awareness is desirable over a broad area (for example, in the context of distributed operations in the maritime domain), it may be desirable to accept stringent standards of encryption as a means of utilising multiple network types. In other instances, for example within the land operating environment, the relative proximity of multiple units may allow for the use of mobile ad-hoc networks to enable the daisy chaining of data using less easily compromised modes of communication such as millimetre wave radios or tropospheric scatter – in turn allowing for more flexible data standards that allow lower latency and a lower requirement for operators to generate encryption keys. Security in this context is delivered by the network and not the data, and the relative simplicity of the data being transmitted (which allows for low latency) does not need to be lost due to a requirement for padding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as such a system does not exist, it can be directly shaped by central bodies in a way that creates a common good around which service-level lines of effort would adapt. Generating a set of differentiated data standards that might underpin such a system would be likely to secure service-level buy-in for several reasons. First, it simplifies the task of selecting standards for individual services. Second, such a system would not necessarily require services to immediately grapple with the intricacies of networking platforms to generate complete situational awareness. Rather, it would require the ability to receive and transmit simple data regarding the presence of friendly platforms and the value of any given adversary target across a shared indexing system. Third, a broad market of standards could allow different trade-offs to be weighed by services based on the tactical imperatives of one or more services in a specific context. Generally, the acceptance of standards tends to depend on the number of impositions that standards create. The more intricate a set of standards, the less likely it is that buy-in will be achieved. A flexible set of standards which is only restrictive on issues that directly pertain to security can circumvent this issue and, importantly, allow tasks to determine approaches. Because services can agree standards based on their appropriateness to a shared cross-service task, this can secure support, because the need for a given standard is rooted in an operational requirement rather than a top-down diktat. This bottom-up approach has characterised previous successful efforts at cross-service coordination, such as the 31 initiatives between the US Army and US Air Force which led to the emergence of AirLand Battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several deductions emerged from the discussions held as part of the workshop. Of greatest salience was the suggestion made throughout the day that, as it approaches the task of integrating the force, StratCom will benefit from an approach that builds from relatively modest goals, but with a clear sense of where it is heading. It must eventually achieve the following aims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish organisational procedures which allow it to determine integration requirements in light of operational demands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish a shared set of routines for coordinating with FMC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effort to establish shared data standards could serve as a starting point. Standards need not immediately impinge on service-level prerogatives regarding platform-level decisions and can be approached in a flexible way, as illustrated by voluntary standards markets. The tasks for which standards are sought might initially involve less stringent capabilities, such as a shared indexing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of a range of options can be of greater utility than the imposition of standards, not least because standards imposed by fiat are often opposed, and moreover tend to create perverse incentive structures. By contrast, the creation of an option set allows one or more services to explicitly weigh trade-offs and justify choices made in light of the trade-offs acceptable in the specific operational contexts in which the assets of more than one FLC interact. On the basis of the system and precedents set, StratCom and FMC could begin to articulate a more coherent system and division of labour, which could then be applied to more complex systems engineering challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tackling the relatively modest task of creating a flexible set of data standards and solving broad tragedies of the commons could, then, create the conditions for a more ambitious future approach to integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪，今（29日）下午於區域法院裁決，3名被告全部被判罪成。從早上起陸續有市民到法院地下排隊，當中有正在就讀新聞系的學生，她表示佩服鍾沛權在庭上「喺咁大壓力嘅情況下，都可以咁準確地講到覺得做新聞應該有的準則」，形容這些準則「好正常⋯⋯係學校學嘅嘢。」她表示至今仍會想入行，因學校的教育好像營造了一種希望，「覺得可能仲有啲空間可以做」，「未去到最壞吖，都仲有朋友一齊。」Annie認為，兩名被告是行內前輩，想跟他們說：「呢行仲會有人想做，唔係佢哋想像中咁灰。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立場博客薯伯伯亦有到場旁聽，他憶述自《立場》成立不久便任博客，編輯「冇任何篩選」，「你講得有紋有路，就寫成點都得」，嘆《立場》停運後，失去了渠道將大家相信的事情說出來。雖然有憂慮，但他不想完全不寫：「要諗點樣可以對得住自己、對得住自己嘅良心、對得住自己嘅讀者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;市民早上起到場排隊&quot;&gt;市民早上起到場排隊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;從早上起陸續有市民到法院地下排隊，約10時起已有40多人，當中大部份人為中年人士，在場記者向他們提問，惟他們均不願發言。期間有市民當眾指稱其中一名中年女士為「排隊黨蛇頭」，該中年女士隨即激動說：「你唔好喺度搞事呀！」、「2019年仲搞唔掂呀？」、「成個法院都俾你搞亂」、「搞屎棍！」經在場保安調停後才平息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;社運人士雷玉蓮、浸大政治及國際關係學系副教授陳家洛、中大政政學院副教授周保松、資深傳媒人區家麟、初選47人案罪脫被告李予信、前立法會議員邵家臻及多國領事等亦有到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新聞系學生稱尊重鍾沛權在壓力下仍在庭上準確說出新聞準則&quot;&gt;新聞系學生稱尊重鍾沛權在壓力下仍在庭上準確說出新聞準則&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就讀中大新聞系三年級的Annie和就讀法律系的Jamila一同到場排隊。其中Annie表示早上10時15分已開始排隊，她稱來旁聽是想「睇吓有冇排隊黨」，對於裁決結果，她笑稱：「唔係好敢諗，所以就索性唔諗。」她指以前認為《立場新聞》與其他媒體分別不大，「因為間間都係咁樣run」，而且「應該係咁樣run」，即是報導事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3年前得悉《立場》編輯被捕時，Annie坦言「冇諗過咁樣都係一條罪名」，她感到早前的審訊「好似一場戲」，認為專訪政治人物、海外人士和評論文章都是「無錯」，對於鍾沛權在庭上的辯護，「我覺得，好respect佢（鍾沛權）就算喺庭上，喺咁大壓力嘅情況下，都可以咁準確地講到覺得做新聞應該有的準則。」她形容這些準則「好正常⋯⋯係學校學嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新聞系學生想跟鍾沛權說呢行仲會有人想做非想像中灰&quot;&gt;新聞系學生想跟鍾沛權說「呢行仲會有人想做」、非想像中灰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;兩名被告於2021年12月被捕及起訴，Annie被問到為何於2022年仍然會選擇入讀新聞系，她解釋「新聞都有好多種」，除了政治外，亦有好多題材可以寫。她又指，學校的教育好像營造了一種希望，「啫係覺得可能仲有啲空間可以做」，加上有不少朋友，讓她感到「啫係都未去到最壞吖，都仲有朋友一齊。」她表示畢業後「應該會」入行，又指兩名被告算是行內的前輩，可能想多些後輩繼續入行，想跟他們說：「呢行仲會有人想做，唔係佢哋想像中咁灰⋯⋯可能佢都唔灰⋯⋯總之仲會有人做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前博客薯伯伯到場旁聽-憶立場無篩選&quot;&gt;前博客薯伯伯到場旁聽 憶《立場》無篩選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;立場前博客作者薯伯伯今也有到庭旁聽，他說，案件是首宗被控煽動的傳媒案件，關乎新聞和言論自由，故特別關注。薯伯伯憶述，於《立場新聞》成立不久便獲邀擔任博客，《立場》會轉載其文章，「除咗執錯字之外就冇任何嘅篩選，總之佢覺得你講得有紋有路，就話我哋想寫成點都得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他續說，以往以為《立場》有很多博客，總編鍾沛權未必太認識他，但傾談間發覺鍾也有看他的文章，「好意想不到佢會咁認真」，自案件後與鍾交流，亦感覺他為人「好正直、真誠」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;嘆失公共討論空間-惟仍繼續寫作&quot;&gt;嘆失公共討論空間 惟仍繼續寫作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;薯伯伯有旁聽立場案大部分審訊，感覺就像上新聞課堂。庭上得悉鍾曾因營運困難而停薪和減薪，「覺得佢好真誠對待自己嘅工作」，聽到他說言論自由就如「信仰」，亦是印證他過去與立場的交流。薯伯伯很記得，庭上控方曾問《立場》刊物為何有一頁是黃色，他覺得煽動「要搵其實點都可以搵到，一隻顏色都可以係煽動」，但他反問：「當我好真誠咁相信自己所寫嘅嘢，而認為咁樣寫出嚟係對成個社會都有好處嘅時候，咁點可能係煽動呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;薯伯伯說，審訊過程就像「見證住香港好美好嘅年代」，《立場》、《蘋果》等停運後，他有時看新聞，也忍不住想以前的人會怎樣報導。雖然傳媒空間收緊，但薯伯伯覺得仍有人很努力做記者工作，「唔覺得好冇希望」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;失去了《立場》的平台，薯伯伯坦言覺得失去了公共討論的空間——以往有《立場》，「將你嘅聲音帶比唔同人，令大家相信嘅事情比較有個渠道去講出嚟；而家冇咗《立場》之後，有時都硬係覺得缺失咗呢個渠道」。但薯伯伯仍繼續寫作，他坦言也會有憂慮，寫作時盡量不會太觸碰某些人的神經，但他又不想完全不寫：「要諗點樣可以對得住自己、對得住自己嘅良心、對得住自己嘅讀者」。薯伯伯望告訴二人，對他們「念茲在茲」，正如今天有不少人到場，「心裡面成日都諗住佢兩位」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;自由記者對只係做新聞仍被控感震驚&quot;&gt;自由記者對「只係做新聞」仍被控感震驚&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;自由身記者Carol說，對《立場》被控煽動感到很震驚，二人「只係做新聞啫」，卻要被捕被控，形容對媒體是很大衝擊，也是對整個行業的審訊。她一直有旁聽案件，認為鍾「好講到新聞專業做咩」，亦有很多啟發——「仲有人為自己嘅理念繼續堅持」，很仔細、不厭其煩地闡述自己想法。她笑言，雖然最後作用或不大，但這份記錄很重要，也是對公眾很好的教育。Carol認識鍾沛權、林紹桐多年，相信二人也已預計會罪成，知道舊煽動罪最高判刑兩年，她只希望二人可以「盡快出返嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪，自2022年10月開審，經歷56日審訊、裁決三度押後，今（29日）於區域法院裁決。國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定3名被告均罪名成立，鍾沛權聞判表現平靜。至於林紹桐則缺席聆訊，辯方稱已呈上醫療報告，感謝法官批准他不出庭。辯方其後讀出林紹桐的陳情書，資深大律師余若薇並指，鍾和林已分別還柙349日和313日，如考慮行為良好三分一扣減，相等於已服刑16.5個月及15個月，加上二人其後再遵守保釋條件至今逾一年半，望法庭能判處一個令二人毋須再服刑的刑期。案件押後至9月26日判刑，鍾沛權和林紹桐獲准原有條件保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;延後逾一小時開庭&quot;&gt;延後逾一小時開庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;身穿深藍色裇衫、卡其色褲的鍾沛權，今約12時半到場，於近2時半時步入被告欄內，不時望向旁聽席。林紹桐妻子亦有到場。案件原定今午2時半開庭，惟最終延後逾一小時，於3時38分才開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，法官郭偉健問林紹桐是否未能到庭，資深大律師余若薇確認，指已呈上醫療報告，感激法官批准林不出庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據記者觀察，正庭及延伸庭的座位均爆滿，社運人士雷玉蓮、浸大政治及國際關係學系副教授陳家洛、中大政政學院副教授周保松、資深傳媒人區家麟、初選47人案罪脫被告李予信、前立法會議員邵家臻及多國領事等均有到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由《國安法》指定法官郭偉健處理，控方代表為高級助理刑事檢控專員伍淑娟，辯方代表為資深大律師余若薇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;三度押後裁決-待快必上訴案結果&quot;&gt;三度押後裁決 待快必上訴案結果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾沛權及林紹桐於2021年12月29日被警方上門以「串謀發布煽動刊物」拘捕，隨即被帶上法庭提堂。二人不認罪，案件於2022年10月31日開審，為1997年後首宗傳媒被控煽動的審訊，原定審期20日，但最終歷時56日，橫跨近8個月，當中有36日為鍾沛權作供及接受盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件去年6月完成結案陳詞，原定10月4日裁決，其後改至11月15日，並因英國樞密院裁定煽動罪「隱含必要條件」為須有煽動暴力或動亂的意圖，改為當天再陳詞。法官郭偉健決定押後裁決，以待「快必」譚得志煽動案上訴結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上訴庭今年3月駁回譚得志的定罪及刑罰上訴，裁定煽動暴力意圖並非煽動罪必要元素，快必遂申請上訴至終院。案件期間再排期至4月29日裁決，再押後至今日，共三度押後，距開審已接近兩年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;終院本月14日批准譚得志就其中兩項法律議題上訴，包括《刑事罪行條例》下的煽動罪是否屬可公訴罪行，以及控方是否需要證明被告有意圖煽動暴力才能入罪。終極上訴聆訊定於明年1月10日進行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被控串謀發布煽動刊物&quot;&gt;被控串謀發布煽動刊物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被告依次為Best Pencil (Hong Kong) Limited、《立場》前總編輯鍾沛權（53歲）及前署任總編輯林紹桐（35歲），他們被控一項串謀發布及／或複製煽動刊物罪，指他們於2020年7月7日至2021年12月29日在香港，一同串謀和與其他人串謀發布及／或複製煽動刊物，即具以下意圖的刊物：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) 引起憎恨或藐視中央或香港特別行政區政府或激起對其離叛；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) 激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變其他在香港的依法制定的事項；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c) 引起對香港司法的憎恨、藐視或激起對其離叛；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d) 引起香港居民間的不滿或離叛；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e) 煽惑他人使用暴力；&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;f) 慫使他人不守法或不服從合法命令。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」案，自2022年10月開審，經歷56日審訊、裁決三度押後，今（29日）於區域法院裁決，國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定3名被告罪名成立。辯方呈上林紹桐和鍾沛權撰寫的陳情書，林提及新聞工作者效忠對象「只有是公眾，亦只能是公眾」，同事最後在巨大壓力下仍堅守崗位，「無愧於時代」，「曾經與這一群出類拔萃的新聞工作者並肩工作，是我的榮幸」，「新聞工作者捍衛新聞自由的唯一方式是報道⋯⋯而我只是行業的其中一人，剛巧成為被告。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾沛權則提到太太陳沛敏在2011年日本大地震採訪，面對危險仍不願提前撤退，「她這份對新聞工作的執着，我銘刻在心」。鍾指，《立場》前同事亦抱持相似信念，更多非新聞工作者的港人亦同樣堅持在各自崗位上實踐信念，「如實記錄和報道他們的故事和思想，是新聞工作者不可逃避的責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師余若薇陳詞指，兩人是新聞工作者，有責任報導社會狀況和不同意見，與其他煽動案宣洩政治言論不同。她又指，二人曾分別還柙349日和313日，相等於已服刑16.5個月及15個月，望法庭能判處一個令二人毋須再服刑的刑期。余又提到，二人在本案後已失去工作，林紹桐患嚴重疾病需接受化療，如入獄難以接受治療。案件押後至9月26日判刑，鍾沛權和林紹桐獲准以原有條件保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;延後逾一小時開庭-林紹桐因健康問題缺席&quot;&gt;延後逾一小時開庭 林紹桐因健康問題缺席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;身穿深藍色裇衫、卡其色褲的鍾沛權，今約12時半到場，於近2時半時步入被告欄內，不時望向旁聽席。林紹桐妻子亦有到場。案件原定今午2時半開庭，惟最終延後逾一小時，於3時38分才開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，法官郭偉健問林紹桐是否未能到庭，資深大律師余若薇確認，指已呈上醫療報告，感激法官批准林不出庭。法官裁定，3名被告全部罪名成立，鍾沛權聞判表現平靜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官郭偉健問，法庭今天批准林可缺席，但判刑當天，「第三被告一定要嚟法庭喇喎？」余若薇則指，希望林的身體健康可以回復，但是據她所知「目前佢個情況係幾嚴重吓」，而他的假期是直到9月中。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 《立場新聞》前署任總編輯 林紹桐（左）、前總編輯 鍾沛權（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另表示，將引用《國安法》實施細則，向《立場》母公司申請充公令，將再排期處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林紹桐陳情新聞工作者效忠對象只是公眾&quot;&gt;林紹桐陳情：新聞工作者效忠對象只是公眾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續指，兩名被告均準備了陳情書，不會庭上讀出鍾沛權的陳情，但會讀出林的陳情（兩人陳情書全文見文末）。其中林紹桐憶述，被捕後有警官探訪，形容「大家各為其主」，但他指，新聞工作者從無要效忠或擁護誰，「如果我們真的有效忠的對象，只有是公眾，亦只能是公眾。因為我們信奉新聞自由、言論自由，而唯有傳播思想的自由，才能保障每個人的自由。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林指自2010年入行，編輯自主空間日益狹窄，《立場》正是嘗試在港經營一個完全編輯自主的傳媒機構，而《立場》能生存七年，「我相信很大原因，是讀者希望看到的新聞，真正不受財團、金主、權力或黨派左右。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林指，即使最後新聞自由在半空墜落、在巨大壓力下，「同事依然堅守崗位，無愧於時代」，發掘差點被掩沒的真相、為無權和弱勢者發聲、盡可能記錄香港，留下歷史初稿，「曾經與這一群出類拔萃的新聞工作者並肩工作，是我的榮幸。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林最後說，案件關鍵是新聞自由、言論自由，新聞工作者不但要為自己報道負責，「若明知公眾有知情權，但刻意迴避不報道亦是失責」，「新聞工作者捍衛新聞自由的唯一方式是報道，正如今天仍然緊守崗位的每一位。而我只是行業的其中一人，剛巧成為被告。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾沛權港人堅持實踐信念-如實記錄是不可逃避責任&quot;&gt;鍾沛權：港人堅持實踐信念 如實記錄是不可逃避責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鍾沛權提交的陳情，提到太太陳沛敏在2011年日本大地震時，是其中一名最早赴現場採訪、亦是最後離開日本的其中一名香港記者，陳面對危險仍不願提前撤退，因認為若出現更大災難，記者更應留下採訪：「既然有機會身在現場、靠近現場，能夠見證、記錄、報道一場空前的人類災難，作為一名記者，她怎可以轉身離開？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾形容，陳對新聞工作的執着，令他銘刻在心，而他認識不少新聞工作者，包括《立場》前同事均抱持相似信念，更多並非新聞工作者的港人，同樣堅持在各自崗位上實踐信念，「更有人因為在乎社群裏眾人的自由和尊嚴，不惜付出失去一己自由的代價」。鍾最後說：「如實記錄和報道他們的故事和思想，是新聞工作者不可逃避的責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方與宣洩政治言論不同曾下架多篇文章&quot;&gt;辯方：與宣洩政治言論不同、曾下架多篇文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余若薇其後續陳詞，強調本案是首次有新聞工作者進行報導或刊登評論而被控煽動。她指與以往其他煽動案中，被告明知故犯、表達政治立場、具宣洩性不同，本案兩名被告均為新聞工作者，「佢哋嘅職責就係要報導」，有責任報導社會狀況和不同人士的意見和評論。余又指，雖然兩人知道報導或帶來抨擊、隱憂或批評，「但佢哋覺得有責任，記錄唔同嘅事同人，唔等於係知道佢犯罪、會被拉」，「知道有風險，係咪等於停止報導或自我審查呢？佢哋覺得應該堅持佢嘅理念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余望法庭判刑時，考慮二人工作性質，指「當時社會情況的確有呢啲聲音，佢報導呢啲聲音，係咪因為咁而被定罪？」余又指此類案件不多，世上很多新聞工作者很關注，望法庭考慮本案與渲洩政治言論有所不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余又指，《立場》自2014年成立至案發的7年，共發布逾十萬篇文章，其後已下架數萬篇文章；而涉案17篇文章中，警方拘捕時已有12篇下架，只餘5篇，望法庭特別考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方二人曾還柙多時-望判刑少於已還柙日子&quot;&gt;辯方：二人曾還柙多時 望判刑少於已還柙日子&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余續提到，鍾和林自2021年12月29日被捕，2022年10月開審後多次押後，因控方新呈大量文章，令「成個官司拖咗好多」，審訊歷時逾50日。余指二人已分別還柙349日和313日，原本如考慮行為良好三分一扣減，相等於已服刑16.5個月及15個月。惟因本案「拖好耐」，今年3月通過《維護國家安全條例》（23條）後，涉危害國安被定罪的囚犯，除非獲懲教署長信納減刑「不會不利國家安全」，否則未能獲三分一扣減，並適用於正進行的舊案，余稱以她所知「冇人有呢個三分一扣減」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;余指，本案最高刑罰兩年，二人如原獲三分一扣減，已服畢大部分刑期，但如再判入獄，料不會獲三分一扣減。余指，二人獲保釋後已遵守保釋條件至今逾一年半，如再入獄，對他們傷害更大，望法庭能判處一個令二人毋須再服刑的刑期，令新法例不會影響兩人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方二人被捕後失工作-林紹桐患病入獄難治療&quot;&gt;辯方：二人被捕後失工作 林紹桐患病入獄難治療&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就二人的個人情況，余若薇指鍾沛權自畢業曾短暫任職非政府組織後，一直從事新聞工作，但他自2021年12月《立場》停刊後，至今近3年均沒有任何工作和入息，對他是很大打擊，亦對其經濟狀況很大影響。而鍾的妻子、前《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏至今仍涉《蘋果日報》案還柙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於林紹桐，余指他患很嚴重罕有的病，腎功能減到很低，正接受化療，需經常入院做很多測試，如判入獄，相信很難接受現在所需的治療。余又指，林有妻子和一名年幼的女兒，本案後失去新聞工作，現時有做少量自由接案（freelance）但入息不多。余又指，林原獲一所外國著名大學取錄，並獲得獎學金，望出國深造，但因本案而失去機會，審訊對他是很大打擊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;押926判刑-二人續准保釋&quot;&gt;押9.26判刑 二人續准保釋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官郭偉健指，就編採方針，「我有我嘅裁決，可能嗰個考慮點，可能有啲唔同嘅睇法」，又指審訊時已有處理關於《立場》公信力和影響力、當時民情等議題，認為亦是令煽動罪嚴重的因素。法官將案件押後至9月26日判刑，期間林紹桐和鍾沛權獲准以原有條件保釋。鍾沛權於下午約5時步出區域法院，有市民高喊：「多謝《立場新聞》！多謝你哋！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;多國領事區家麟等旁聽&quot;&gt;多國領事、區家麟等旁聽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由《國安法》指定法官郭偉健處理，控方代表為高級助理刑事檢控專員伍淑娟，辯方代表為資深大律師余若薇。國安處總警司李桂華亦有到庭，坐在控方代表後方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據記者觀察，正庭及延伸庭的座位均爆滿，社運人士雷玉蓮、浸大政治及國際關係學系副教授陳家洛、中大政政學院副教授周保松、資深傳媒人區家麟、初選47人案罪脫被告李予信、前立法會議員邵家臻及多國領事等均有到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;立場新聞前署任總編輯林紹桐的求情信全文&quot;&gt;《立場新聞》前署任總編輯林紹桐的求情信全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我依然記得，在還押最初幾位警官循例來公務探訪，其中一位形容「大家各為其主」。我後悔沒有把握機會向警官解釋，新聞工作者從沒有要效忠誰、擁護誰，或者與誰為敵。而如果我們真的有效忠的對象，只有是公眾，亦只能是公眾。因為我們信奉新聞自由、言論自由，而唯有傳播思想的自由，才能保障每個人的自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我2010年加入傳媒行業，當時新聞業界已面臨各種隱憂，或明或暗的審查愈見頻密，編採室方針難逃老闆、財團及權力各種干預，編輯自主空間愈來愈狹窄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《立場新聞》是在如此背景下成立，參與《立場》的每一位抱着同一個理想，嘗試在香港經營一個完全編輯自主的傳媒機構。《立場》能夠生存七年，我相信很大原因，是讀者希望看到的新聞，真正不受財團、金主、權力或黨派左右。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;即使在最後的時間，新聞自由在半空墜落，在巨大壓力之下，同事依然堅守崗位，無愧於時代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我們發掘差點被掩沒的真相，即使困難重重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我們為無權者、弱勢和小眾發聲，即使面臨譴責攻擊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我們盡可能記錄香港，趁這些人與事消失之前，盡力留下歷史初稿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我們的自由在倒數，每一位同事都心知肚明；他們選擇留下，加緊步伐，用盡狹縫裡所有空間。由2020年7月（即控方指控煽動的案發開始）一直至今天，《立場》同事的報道先後獲得30多項新聞獎項及嘉許。曾經與這一群出類拔萃的新聞工作者並肩工作，是我的榮幸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;這宗案件的關鍵是新聞自由，是言論自由。新聞工作者不但要為自己的報道負責，若明知公眾有知情權，但刻意迴避不報道亦是失責。亦因如此，新聞工作者捍衛新聞自由的唯一方式是報道，正如今天仍然緊守崗位的每一位。而我只是行業的其中一人，剛巧成為被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林紹桐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;立場新聞前總編輯鍾沛權的求情信全文&quot;&gt;《立場新聞》前總編輯鍾沛權的求情信全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，這是我在這次審訊中的最後陳情，僅為自己作為一名香港公民及新聞工作者的「意圖」，再作一些簡短的背景補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011年3月日本發生東北大地震，我太太陳沛敏是其中一名最早飛赴現場採訪的香港記者。面對褔島核電廠意外迅速演變、惡化，加上餘震不斷，不少海外記者都因應風險難測而選擇提早撤離日本。她卻堅持留下，繼續想方設法前赴多個災難現場採訪，盡力做記錄、報道。她是當年最後離開日本的其中一名香港記者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當時有大量關於災難發展的壞消息和悲觀預測，甚至乎有說法稱日本部份地區有陸沉危機。她後來跟我談及那時候不願意提前撤退回港的一些想法：假如日本真的出現更大的災難，她不是更應該留下繼續採訪而非放棄報道嗎？既然有機會身在現場、靠近現場，能夠見證、記錄、報道一場空前的人類災難，作為一名記者，她怎可以轉身離開？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;她這份對新聞工作的執着，我銘刻在心，而她不是特殊的少數。我認識的不少香港新聞工作者，包括很多《立場新聞》前同事，在過去和現在都抱持相似的信念，決意留守新聞現場，見證和記載真實的故事，聆聽和記述紛紜的思想。我相信這些故事和思想，可以刺激、啟發人們思考，反映時代，塑造歷史。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我知道，有更多並非新聞工作者的香港人，同樣一直堅持在各自的崗位上實踐信念，通過各種形式和體裁，真誠地書寫、表達、創作，呼應時代的挑戰。他們當中更有人因為在乎社群裏眾人的自由和尊嚴，不惜付出失去一己自由的代價。如實記錄和報道他們的故事和思想，是新聞工作者不可逃避的責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾沛權&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hohy7q9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》兩位前總編輯鍾沛權和林紹桐，今日被判串謀發布煽動刊物罪名成立。記協發聲明，指案件明確反映香港新聞自由衰落。在裁決前，立場案亦已對香港新聞業界造成不可逆轉的傷害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;警方國安處是於2021年12月29日搜查《立場新聞》，並拘捕八名編採人員、董事及前董事，包括鍾沛權和林紹桐。《立場新聞》的6,100萬資產於搜查當日被警方凍結，《立場新聞》隨後宣布停運。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾沛權和林紹桐兩人在被捕翌日提堂，保釋申請被拒，還押近一年至2022年11月及12月才分別獲准保釋至今。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記協在今日立場案判決後發聲明，指案件明確反映香港新聞自由衰落。記協提到，政府今年年初將煽動罪的最高刑罰由兩年增至七年監禁，加劇新聞工作者的擔憂及深化寒蟬效應，對新聞自由構成更嚴重的傷害。加上近日有政府官員指媒體在專欄旁提示文章無煽動意圖並不能免責，而《明報》總編輯隨後致函專欄，呼籲撰文時需「知所分寸免危機降臨」，反映本港傳媒對煽動罪感到憂心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;記協認為，眾多事件反映本港新聞自由正嚴重倒退，表明強烈反對使用煽動罪、《港區國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》等法例，檢控按《基本法》行使其權利進行新聞工作的人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;近日，有政府官員指媒體在專欄旁提示文章無煽動意圖並不能為其免責，《明報》總編輯其後致函專欄作者，呼籲撰寫評論文章時需「知所分寸」，以免危機降臨，顯示香港傳媒對煽動罪感到憂心。港府日前也拒絕向外媒彭博記者發出工作簽證，此等事件足證香港新聞自由現狀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;連同《立場》一案，記協認為眾多事件均反映新聞自由正嚴重倒退。本會強烈反對使用煽動罪、港區國安法及23條《維護國家安全條例》等法例，檢控按《基本法》行使其權利進行新聞工作的人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/odSssLB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》涉嫌發布煽動性文章，前總編輯鍾沛權及署任總編輯林紹桐今日在區域法院，被裁定串謀發布煽動刊物罪名成立。對於法庭已就涉案文章裁定具煽動意圖，警方會否就撰寫文章的記者、博客作調查及進一步行動。國安處總警司李桂華表示，會視乎文章是否有煽動意圖：「就作者，同埋嗰啲負責寫嘅人士，我哋會睇睇一樣嘢，佢哋有無煽動意圖做呢一樣嘢，如果有嘅話，我哋會同律政處商量，究極適唔適合檢控嘅情況。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在鍾沛權步出法院後，李桂華就案件裁決見記者，他在開場中稱，控方在57日的審訊中展露不同證據，可見三名被告透過報道、博客及專訪，在2020年7月7曰至2021年12月9日期間，發布帶有煽動性的文章，當中包括污衊國安法及其執法行動、煽動離叛，散布分裂國家的訊息、鼓吹推翻政權、乞求外國向香港及中國政府進行施壓作制裁行動，更透過反政府議題推波助瀾，挑起公眾向中央及特區政府的仇恨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;重申自由非絕對-如涉國家安全可施加規限&quot;&gt;重申自由非絕對 如涉國家安全可施加規限&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李桂華特別提到，警方在2021年12月29日執法行動時：「有啲人不分青紅皂白，話我哋打壓新聞自由、言論自由嘅。」他表示，法庭判詞告訴外界，警方執法行動的理據，又引用《公民權利及政治權利國際公約》：「呢一類嘅自由並非絕對性嘅自由，如果遇到一啲國家安全，公共安全、公共安寧、公共秩序嘅情況，係可以施加一啲規限嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，李桂華亦不點名提到早前英國的示威，正因為假消息、煽動性消息在網上流傳，影響社會秩序、穩定，甚至影響國家安全：「其實呢啲事喺2019年、2020年，我哋都係歷歷在目。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李桂華非首次旁聽國安案有時間便聽審&quot;&gt;李桂華：非首次旁聽國安案、有時間便聽審&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《無綫新聞》記者關注，「屠龍案」6名被告經審訊後罪名不成立，及李桂華為何親自到區域法院旁聽：「點解你要親自嚟到區院呢度聽呢？係咪因為涉及一啲指控話，新聞自由你哋唔認同呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李桂華先強調，早前已有7名同案被告認罪，重申十分重視同類案件，呼籲公眾如有相關消息可報警：「呢個案件係一個好嚴重嘅案件嚟，真槍，甚至有長槍，有炸藥，佢嘅炸藥嘅份量可以造成好大嘅死傷，包括警務人員，或者係參與當時遊行嘅人，或者無辜嘅人士，又有一個非常之完整嘅計劃。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於是否因涉及《立場新聞》便首次旁聽，李桂華就稱並非首次聽審：「當然我唔能夠每日都嚟啦，但係如果呢啲咁嘅案件，我除咗我同事向我報告，睇一啲文件向我報告，我係非常之如果有時間嘅話，都會抽嚟聽一聽究竟案情係點。絕對唔係話我第一次聽國家安全有關嘅案件。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;裁決影響新聞自由-李桂華更好讓外界明白違法界線&quot;&gt;裁決影響新聞自由？ 李桂華：更好讓外界明白違法界線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一記者問及，坊間有聲音認為裁決影響新聞自由及言論自由，李桂華就稱「用好快嘅時間」看了裁決，認為可更好讓外界明白違法界線，即只要涉及煽動性物品便有機會干犯相關法律：「我哋唔係話，有咩題目唔報得，有咩案件唔報得，只不過佢選擇用一個煽動意圖去報道嘅做法，即係一個載體用嚟散播煽動意圖嘅訊息，呢個就唔做到，會受到法律制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;日本共同通訊社則問李桂華，今次裁決對外國媒體在香港採訪自由你影響。李桂華回應時稱：「唔應該分外國媒體、本港媒體，其實我哋嗰把呎、個法律都係用嗰一樣嚟。」他重申今次案件涉及煽動意圖，《刑事罪行條例》、《維護國家安全條例》均清楚列明，甚麼情況屬煽動情況：「大家返去睇一睇，一般人係唔會犯呢啲！」他表示，涉案的17篇文章的題目，「其他報章、其他媒體都有買㗎，點解佢偏偏係會被人拘捕呢？因為佢係用咗嚟做煽動意圖嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」案，今（29日）被國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定罪名成立。審訊期間控方邀請法庭考慮案發時的時代背景，社會氣氛仍然不穩、公眾容易受到煽動，並用了相當時間就此議題盤問鍾沛權。郭官在裁決理由書中處理相關議題，指在反修例示威爆發之前，有66%市民不贊成將香港人引渡到內地受審，顯示已經有約六成的市民對政府持有懷疑、不滿甚至不信任的態度。2019年區議會選舉非建制派取得大勝，惟郭官指此前發生了一連串暴力事件，但抗爭者派別依然大勝，反映市民「一切立場行先，目的至上，手段可以不理」，並肯定：「民粹年代當時已降臨香港。」他又指曾經參與抗議活動的市民都是有可能受到煽動的對象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;反送中初期六成市民不贊成修例-官當時已有對政府抱懷疑不滿和不信任&quot;&gt;反送中初期六成市民不贊成修例 官：當時已有對政府抱懷疑、不滿和不信任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊期間，控方邀請法庭考慮案發期間的社會情況，郭官表示有需要考慮公眾是否容易受到煽動，或當時是否出現了「一點火花就會引爆火藥庫（“a spark will explode a powder magazine”）」的時代背景。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官引述香港大學民意研究計劃的民意調查結果，顯示2019年5月底至6月初，有66%市民不贊成和強烈不贊成將香港人引渡到內地受審，指：「即使在反修例運動的最初期，已經有約六成的市民對政府持有懷疑、不滿甚至不信任的態度。」郭官又引用中大民意調查結果，指隨著反修例運動的持續發展，示威者的政治取向看來是越來越激進及反政府，本土派亦越來越壯大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區選前發生一連串暴力事件抗爭者派別依然大勝-官民粹年代已降臨香港&quot;&gt;區選前發生一連串暴力事件抗爭者派別依然大勝 官：民粹年代已降臨香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官又指，從辯方呈上的民意調查可見，「示威者的激進行為可以說是不受制約，因為他們的行為得到部份政黨及聲稱奉行『和理非』的大量市民的諒解甚至支持，包括提供精神上和物質上的支持，認為勇武示威者為他們發聲及爭取訴求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他指2019年區議會選舉中，非建制派取得大勝，在452個民選議席中，他們得到約57%的選票但取得389席，可是在投票前不足兩星期，已經發生示威者將活人縱火及掟磚擊斃人事件，又發生中大和理大的暴亂，堵塞交通大命脈，但抗爭者派別依然大勝。郭官指區選結果可以反映以往不同政見人士均會譴責暴力的情況已經改變，「一切立場行先，目的至上，手段可以不理。本席肯定，民粹年代當時已降臨香港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;市民支持重組警隊爭取民主政制改革-官針對中央及特區憲制秩序和地位&quot;&gt;市民支持重組警隊、爭取民主政制改革 官：針對中央及特區憲制秩序和地位&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，民調顯示隨著運動發展，示威者和市民愈來愈將焦點由個別事件轉移到一些根本和結構性議題，例如支持重組警隊、爭取民主政制改革，而不認為要求特首林鄭下台是很重要的運動目標，顯示示威者乃放眼於爭取政治制度的基本改變，「當示威者不是針對個別官員時，本席認為，他們就是針對著中央政府和香港特區的憲制秩序和地位而來。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JWzx2c5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官根據辯方所呈上的學術文章，由Clifford Stott教授聯同其他人撰寫的文章，顯示從2019年6月到2020年5月，在香港發生了1,000多次單獨的抗議活動，涉及超過1,400萬人次。郭官指即使這些人沒有參與任何暴力行動，他們必然是對警隊、特區政府或中央政府有著種種的不滿，即使在國安法實施之後，「他們都是有可能受到煽動的對象。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官又指，憑司法認知裁定，當時社會上出現了極為嚴重的撕裂，同一家人會因為政見不同而出現嚴重的分歧，甚至父母與子女分開居住。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2020年7月11至12日舉行的民主派初選，郭官指雖然政府官員早已提出這種選舉可能犯法，但仍然有約61萬人投票，顯示「仍然有大量不滿意甚至反對特區政府和中央政府的市民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Lm6uaLp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官流言被宣傳為事實-沒有人願意協助警方進行調查&quot;&gt;官：流言被宣傳為事實 沒有人願意協助警方進行調查&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官亦關注案發時屬「謠言或不願尋找真相的時代」，他指在這段政治氣氛極為熾熱的時期，社會上經常流傳一些沒有真憑實據的指控，例如指稱8.31太子站有人被警員打死、新屋嶺有人被性侵、兩名年青人（陳彥霖和周梓樂）的去世亦被扯到警方身上。「在提出和散播指控後，沒有人願意協助警方進行調查，但流言卻被宣傳為事實。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官又指，「爆眼少女」聲稱被警方的布袋彈打爆護目鏡導致一隻眼睛失明，「但她從來沒有證實是否真的失明，更採取一切法律程序阻止警方取得她的醫療報告。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官立場的公信力在網媒中排名第一-必然影響力大&quot;&gt;官：《立場》的公信力在網媒中排名第一 必然影響力大&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，從中大民調結果可見，網上新聞媒體是受訪者獲取運動資訊的最重要渠道，在2019年6至7月，超過八成受訪者表示「頗多」或「經常」透過《立場新聞》和《獨立媒體》等網上新聞媒體來接收有關運動的資訊；7月至12月，相關比例高達超過九成。郭官憑司法認知，裁斷現在年青人透過手機接收資訊遠較其他傳播方式為多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官又指，根據中大的媒體公信力調查，在10間網上新聞媒體之中，《立場》的公信力是排名第一，拋離排第二的《獨立媒體》。郭官認為，《立場》傳播的訊息必然影響力大，因為大部份年青人透過網上媒體接收資訊，而《立場》被視為在網媒中最有公信力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，據鍾沛權證供，《立場》結束的時候，臉書有130萬個like，追蹤者有160萬人，雖然鍾其後補充追蹤者可以包括針對《立場》的「網軍」，但毫無疑問《立場》的追蹤者是至少接近160萬人，成功地爭取讀者或聽眾進入它的頻道，「影響力極為龐大。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指雖國安法實施示威幾近絕跡-社會不穩定因素未完全消除&quot;&gt;官指雖國安法實施示威幾近絕跡 社會不穩定因素未完全消除&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指稱，在《國安法》生效之後，香港社會秩序已經回復正常，恐怖襲擊威脅亦維持於「中度」，與以往相同。鍾沛權亦在庭上供稱，《國安法》生效後，街頭示威活動幾近絕跡，政府亦擁有強大的資源、技術和意志，恐怖主義沒有機會在社會裡萌芽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過郭官指，雖然如此，中央和特區政府同時指出恢復秩序只是第一步，要維護國家安全和香港的穩定繁榮還有大量工作，「他們從來沒有說社會上的政治或其他不穩定因素已經完全消除。」郭官舉例2021年的七一梁健輝刺警案、「光城者」企圖製造爆炸品案和港大評議會通過致謝動議，可見社會表面回復公共秩序，但是隱藏著不少人反對《國安法》實施、對特區的憲政秩序和政治環境感到不滿，而且部份人選擇使用暴力來爭取他們的政治訴求或表達不滿，社會上亦有不少人贊同或美化使用非法暴力的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於恐怖襲擊威脅維持「中度」，郭官指原因是當時官方的評估是沒有情報顯示特區即將受襲，但受襲的風險一直存在。「本席尤其相信，類似七一刺警案的孤狼式襲擊，在它出現之前，警方難以掌握情報。」郭官最後不接納辯方所指社會經已回復平靜，或恐怖主義不可能在港萌芽或發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/roBubBC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指17篇涉案文章發布時-約三至五成市民不信任中央政府&quot;&gt;官指17篇涉案文章發布時 約三至五成市民不信任中央政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方呈上香港大學民意研究計劃就香港市民對中央政府的信任程度的調查結果，力陳社會氣氛並不是如控方所說的非常不穩定，而且中央政府並不是處於弱勢，即使社會出現些少批評，但也不會導致中央政府被人憎恨，更不會引起動亂。惟郭官認為辯方對民調數據分析出錯，指調查結果顯示某些時期，接近六成的香港市民不信任中央政府，「不管原因如何，亦不管原因是否有理，他們必然是對中央政府持有負面的看法。在這種心態下，他們自然容易接受任何針對中央政府的負面資訊和批評。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官認為：「當市民對政府缺乏信任時，他們往往更容易懷有偏見和負面的假設，可能會將不信任的情緒轉化為對政府的猜疑和指責，將政府正常或合理的行為解讀為可疑或有問題的行為，縱使他們沒有任何或任何確鑿的證據來支持他們的指控。」他亦指政府會極容易成為不實信息或謠言攻擊的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官亦根據港大民意調查結果和數據，以及相應的涉案文章發布時間，裁定《立場》發布17篇涉案文章時，約30.8%至57.6%的香港市民不信任中央政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」案，被裁定罪名成立。國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定，涉案17篇文章中，有11篇具有煽動意圖。涉案文章被分成四組，就涉民主派35+初選的文章，法官裁定何桂藍專訪、羅冠聰博客文章具煽動意圖，鄒家成、梁晃維專訪則不足證具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，何桂藍清楚知道《立場》專訪可宣揚其政治理念，文中提及「會用一切方式與中共周旋」等，顯示她極度仇恨、厭惡及藐視中央和特區政府，在案發時社會動盪、大量市民不滿政府下，其訪問引發讀者對中央和港府產生強烈敵意，不承認其合法性和權威，並製造恐懼，煽動「攬炒」特區。至於羅冠聰，官指他無提出任何客觀基礎下，指律政司檢控初選案為荒謬及濫權，完全漠視執法需要。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 何桂藍（左）、羅冠聰（中）、張崑陽（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另外兩篇專訪，法官指雖涉表述政治觀點，提及香港民族主義、指《國安法》是打壓工具等，但鄒家成專訪「主旨是批評其他民主派人士」，梁晃維專訪「主旨只在交代梁晃維參政之路」、「沒有特別抹黑或貶低某一方的言詞」，「整體考慮下」裁定不足證具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍專訪裁煽動引發讀者對政府強烈敵意製造恐懼煽動攬炒&quot;&gt;何桂藍專訪裁煽動：引發讀者對政府強烈敵意、製造恐懼煽動「攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就何桂藍專訪〈【立會選戰】專訪—除下記者證後，還有人與她同行嗎？〉，法官指何在訪問提倡與中央及特區政府在不同領域抗爭，而文章發布時初選即將舉行，何清楚知道透過《立場》替她做專訪，她可以將其政治理念宣揚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官續指，何在文中提及不再視議會為議政場所，而是抗爭陣地，又稱「會用一切方式與中共周旋」，而非尋求拉踞，可見她對中央採取「絕對的對抗性」態度，無任何妥協空間，顯示出她「極度仇恨、厭惡及藐視中央和特區政府或激起對其離叛」；而就何稱要「破中共set畀香港的局」，官指「局」無疑指香港憲制地位和秩序，何明顯不接納一國兩制及中央和港府的合法性和權威。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對何提到「中共打大力啲，或者香港變澳門」，官指她試圖利用人們對失去自由的恐懼和情緒化反應，相信和接納其主張；何又鼓吹「攬炒」，即不論付出什麼代價，只求傷害政府來達政治訴求。對何稱「那些覺得攬炒是消極的人，只是未意識到香港已經差到甚麼地步」，官指她製造恐懼，極力說服不同意「攬炒」者，令他們相信香港是完全無自由、不能正常生活的地方，意圖說服讀者唯一出路是「攬炒」、與中央和特區政府對抗。而何稱「香港人的抗爭必須繼續，唔可以停」，亦是煽惑人不合法改變在港制定的事項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官終指，案發時社會動盪、政治氣氛極熾熱、《國安法》剛頒布實施，大量市民不滿甚至反對政府，何的訪問會引發讀者對中央和特區政府產生強烈敵意，不承認它們的合法性和權威，煽動讀者「攬炒」特區，故裁定具煽動性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;羅冠聰博客裁煽動無客觀基礎指律政司檢控荒謬濫權&quot;&gt;羅冠聰博客裁煽動：無客觀基礎指律政司檢控荒謬濫權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就羅冠聰博客〈香港—美麗島〉，批評35+初選案審訊安排、形容檢控荒謬及濫用權力，官指從初選案判決可見，「該案執法及檢控行動合理合法」，認為文章在無提出任何客觀基礎下，指律政司提出檢控為荒謬及濫用權力，「完全漠視執法需要」，煽動罪的辯護理由不適用，在當時社會動盪及公眾情緒不穩下，文章對國安或公眾秩序安全造成潛在破壞，具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成專訪非煽動主旨批評其他民主派人士&quot;&gt;鄒家成專訪非煽動：主旨批評其他民主派人士&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就鄒家成專訪〈【專訪】由「無人識你喎」到新東初選出線 鄒家成：證明本土理念係有得贏〉，提及香港民族主義、表示不信任一國兩制及基本法、認為中央政府已「撕破面紗」等，惟官細閱後，認為雖涉鄒表述其政治觀點、提及對中央或特區政府的不滿，但訪問更多篇幅談及鄒對泛民的不滿，「主旨是批評其他民主派人士」，「整體考慮」下認為不足證具煽動意圖。官亦指，文章可見鄒是缺乏政治背景的素人，在不同陣營不是特別受歡迎、無政黨支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁晃維專訪非煽動主旨只在交代參政之路&quot;&gt;梁晃維專訪非煽動：主旨只在交代參政之路&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就梁晃維專訪〈【專訪】高歌《熱愛基本法》仍被DQ 梁晃維：可能連區議員都時日無多〉，批評中共和特區政府極權，並指《國安法》是打壓工具，又指35+目的是讓中央「黐線」，自己參選是為得到港人關注，藉此挑戰政權，撕破假象。官同指，文章涉梁表述其政治觀點，但「整體考慮」下，認為「其主旨只在交代梁晃維參政之路」、「沒有特別抹黑或貶低某一方的言詞」，加上文章發布時政府已宣布押後立法會選舉，梁更已被取消參選資格，無可能參選，裁定不足證具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定，涉案17篇文章中有11篇具煽動意圖。有關海外政治人物的5篇涉案文章，共有2篇被裁定具煽動意圖，郭官指羅冠聰的博客文章「煽動讀者的烈士情緒」，鼓勵讀者不顧後果地挑戰政府及中央；張崑陽的博客文章則形容中共為「邪惡軸心」，指責中央滿口謊言，殘害香港自治，以圖引起讀者對中央的憎恨，又將特區政府及中央的鎮壓行動演繹為中央「外強中乾的事實和狗急跳牆的心態」，以此激勵抗爭者。另外3篇分別專訪羅冠聰、梁頌恆和許智峯的文章，則被裁定不具煽動意圖，郭官指它們只涉及受訪者表述其政治觀點，交代離港後動向，沒有進一步鼓動他人行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;羅冠聰文章裁煽動教讀者如何保持戰意與中央及特區對抗&quot;&gt;羅冠聰文章裁煽動：教讀者如何保持戰意與中央及特區對抗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就羅冠聰的博客文章〈在亂世中堅強：低谷、幽暗與希冀〉，郭官指文章以歷史不同的例子，強調發生在香港的社會運動是為了從政權手上重奪自由，又強調強調社會運動源於當權者的權力過大，以致無權者被剝削至一個不能容忍的程度，才導致人民拼命的反抗，郭官認為：「作者在文章煽動讀者的烈士情緒，強調承受代價是社會運動的本質之一，鼓勵讀者不顧後果地挑戰政府及中央的管治。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，文章以足球比賽來比喻社會運動，「鼓勵讀者一天未完場，勝負也是尚未知曉」，又指民主運動自2019年起已全面進入曠日持久的模式，強調只需要堅持就能讓改變持續發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官認為，文章指抗爭者被無理打壓、被失蹤、侵犯、長年囚禁等，而沒有提任何客觀基礎，目的是以假消息散播憎恨及反政府情緒，並激勵在港抗爭者的士氣，要求他們全面進行曠日持久的抗爭。「整篇文章都是教導讀者如何保持戰意與中央及特區政府對抗，煽動讀者採取他建議的行動。」郭官裁定，在案發時期社會動盪及公眾情緒不穩下，文章內容對國家安全或公眾秩序及安全造成潛在破壞，意圖嚴重破壞中央或特區政府權威，故具有煽動意圖，即引起市民憎恨中央或香港政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張崑陽文章裁煽動無提客觀基礎下對中央或特區作謾駡&quot;&gt;張崑陽文章裁煽動：無提客觀基礎下對中央或特區作謾駡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就張崑陽的博客文章〈回應國安法通緝：歷史不留白 真理永世在人間〉，郭官指當中內容形容中共為邪惡軸心，指斥中央政府以物質力量逼迫追求公義的人，亦指責中央滿口謊言，殘害香港自治，以圖引起讀者對中央的憎恨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官又指，張崑陽將特區政府及中央的鎮壓行動演繹為中央「外強中乾的事實和狗急跳牆的心態」，以此激勵抗爭者；張亦相信過去的行動對中央構成了巨大的影響，以圖貶低香港政府及中央的管治威信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指張繼而鼓動香港人作出抗爭，引述文章段落：「相信任政權如何使用骯臟手段去打壓和貶低香港人所信仰的價值，但透過我們自身的行動和信念，我們仍然能夠把香港人追求民主和自由的故事流傳開去。強權壓不倒真理，真理不能夠被磨滅。歷史的意志定必帶領我們衝破極權的枷鎖，我深信人民最終會得勝而歸。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官裁定，案發當時社會動盪及公眾情緒不穩，文章在沒有提出任何客觀基礎下對中央或特區政府作出謾駡，內容對國家安全或公眾秩序及安全造成潛在破壞，意圖嚴重破壞中央或特區政府權威，具有煽動意圖，即引起憎恨中央或香港政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3海外政治人物專訪裁非煽動僅交代離港後動向沒鼓動他人跟隨&quot;&gt;3海外政治人物專訪裁非煽動：僅交代離港後動向、沒鼓動他人跟隨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就羅冠聰的專訪文章〈【倫敦專訪】一個流亡者，帶著愧疚展開新的戰鬥〉，郭官認為文章雖然涉及羅表述其政治主張，但重點在於交代其在英的生活，例如有愧疚感、擔心人身安全受威脅、生活忙碌，以及在中國外長王毅外訪期間，羅趕赴意大利及德國請願、狙擊王毅。整體考慮下，郭官認為文章集中討論羅冠聰在流亡後的經歷及心路歷程，認為證據不足以證明文章具有煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就許智峯的專訪文章〈舉家流亡海外 許智峯：最親的人安全在側，就放心向政權全面宣戰〉，內容提及許在保釋期間以公務外訪為由獲准離港，其後在社交媒體宣布流亡及退出民主黨，許表示不會和香港及家人切割，亦希望能在海外以打「國際線」維生。郭官認為文章雖然涉及許智峯表述其政治觀點，但重點在於交代離開香港的過程及之後的動向，整體考慮下，裁定證據不足以證明文章具有煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就梁頌恆的專訪文章〈逃亡美國 誓爭取金融制裁、救生艇計劃 梁頌恆：盼重返屬於港人的香港〉，他在訪問中質疑香港司法系統、提及爭取外國制裁香港，又對中央對香港的憲法地位表示質疑，提出只有兩國才有兩制等理念，亦表示不相信中共之下的地方會有民主的制度。惟郭官指梁沒有進一步鼓勵他人跟從他的想法，或鼓動他人行動，整體考慮下裁定證據不足以證明文章具有煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定，涉案17篇文章中有11篇具有煽動意圖。就涉中大暴動案及「惡意攻擊中央和政權」的文章，法官裁定中大衝突兩年專訪具煽動意圖。法官認為，「保護中大」絕對是「偽議題」，文章無提出客觀基礎下，指中大學術自由受威脅需保護，提供錯誤事實攻擊警方執法，並美化暴動者行為，塑造警方打壓學生的形象。法官又指，文章內片段比較校園2019年及兩年後景象，2019年時多個景象可見「光時」等標語，認為《立場》意圖重新展示抗爭口號標語，重燃已經冷卻的暴力抗爭，引起公眾對政府及警方憎恨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒幸彤獲頒發「中國傑出民主人士獎」的報道，法官指「細閱文章後，考慮到文章屬新聞報道」，裁定不足證具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;中大衝突兩年專訪裁屬煽動-官指警方行動非針對中大&quot;&gt;中大衝突兩年專訪裁屬煽動 官指警方行動非針對中大&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就〈【專訪】【中大衝突兩年】畢業生憶徒步前往護校 哀山城人文精神消逝〉，文中訪問兩名自稱中大校友H及A，提及2019年11月12日警方於中大執法，學術自由受威脅需保護，有學生及校友守護中大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，2019年11月11日，示威者從中大二號橋擲物到橋下公路和鐵路，罔顧汽車和列車會否受損、亦不埋市民人身安全會否受害，癱瘓主要交通幹道，連同其他地區堵路的示威者進行所謂「黎明行動」和「破曉行動」，製造「三罷」效果，作為逼使政府妥協的手段。官指，無疑警方行動不是針對中大或其師生，而是在二號橋危害公眾的示威者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官受訪者無交代真相無提示威者先進攻&quot;&gt;官：受訪者無交代真相、無提示威者先進攻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中提到記者A及教師H，當天返回中大，A稱看到防暴警從二號橋攻入中大，學生以樹木掩護及擲物反擊。法官指，從新聞片段可見，當時眾多示威者躲在大型垃圾車和水馬後，沿環迴東路向警員推進，導致警員發射催淚彈，官指A「沒有交代當時真相」，完全無提是示威者首先進攻，雙方拉鋸約15分鐘後警方才展開追捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文章指，夏鼎基運動場燒起烈火，催淚彈降落，學生在硝煙中跑，如上演災難片的「大逃亡」。官指新聞錄像可見警員確實向運動場發射催淚彈，場內也有不少示威者，但他們均戴上頭盔及空氣過濾器，並「見不到A所說的大逃亡景象」。新聞亦指運動場旁有汽車被焚，令警員不能前進，官相信這是警員向運動場發射催淚彈的原因，但A「沒有提及這個事實」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官看不到大逃亡景象受訪者看來怪罪警員&quot;&gt;官：看不到「大逃亡」景象、受訪者看來怪罪警員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A亦提到，聽到其中一名警員說「燒晒佢啦」，令她情緒崩潰。但官指據新聞片段，警員說此句時運動場仍未着火，而警員是說「燒哂佢啦，地下全部火水呀」，明顯是見到示威者在地上淋火水，故嘲笑他們說「燒晒佢啦」，並非建議警員火燒運動場。官又指，場內一跳高軟墊着火焚燒，但其火勢「看來對場內的人也沒有影響」，據報導亦由學生焚燒，既然警員說「燒晒佢啦」時軟墊仍未着火、又不是警員燒軟墊、運動場又完好無損，A無可能因聽到警員這樣說而情緒崩潰，因「這不可能是事實」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就A稱有玻璃樽在她面前爆開，行前後發現被腐蝕性液體弄傷，工作突然被中止，官指玻璃樽應是從示威者掟來，因防暴警無可能帶着腐蝕性液體的玻璃樽，「但看來她在怪罪警員令她工作停止。」官又指，二號橋屬於政府土地，警員在駐守時沒有進入中大的任何地方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官保護中大是偽議題&quot;&gt;官：保護中大是偽議題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;教師H則稱11月12日教書後，傍晚與朋友一起前往中大守護校園。官對其陳述是否真實有疑問，舉例H稱穿恤衫西褲、拿公事包，往中大途中有女士塞錢給他坐的士，質疑他已是教師、穿工作服帶公事包，「有女士會認為他需要錢坐的士嗎？」，又指他稱傍晚從沙田出發，晚上11時抵達中大是不吻合。官認為，H陳述的作用「就是挑動讀者的情緒，相信當晚有保護中大的必要」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官又指，當晚雙方大規模對抗後，警方離開，示威者重佔二橋並向橋下擲物，指這是他們衝擊警方防線的原因，「所謂保護中大，絕對是一個偽議題」；而中大事件於11月15日才完結，無證據警方任何期間干涉中大院校自主及學術自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官校方清除塗鴉-絕不可說成打壓言論自由&quot;&gt;官：校方清除塗鴉 絕不可說成打壓言論自由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章續指，二人兩年後重返中大，H稱當保安要求他進入校園時登記身分，他對學術淨土的幻想一下子被粉碎。惟官認為，「他的說話有點誇張」，指反修例運動後，因各大學曾涉示威，故2019年年尾已有很多大學包括中大設下登記身分程序，目的就是保護大學，而且「小小登記怎會令大學喪失學術自由開放的環境」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於中大內2019年的塗鴉、標語等全被清走，H指柏林圍牆一日未倒，也不會把他推倒，惟官指該些直幡、塗鴉等包括「五大訴求 缺一不可」、「香港人反抗」、「光復香港 時代革命」，大部分具港獨含義，大學無理由長時間保留，「這不是校方害怕政權，而是大學必須表明不鼓吹及不認同港獨。」官形容，校方是「受害人」，把這些損害清除、將校園回復舊觀，「絕對不可能被說為打壓言論自由或容不下學生的聲音。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官提供錯誤事實攻擊警方執法&quot;&gt;官：提供錯誤事實攻擊警方執法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，二人2021年11月於中大的見聞，難以證明中大的措施損害了校園出入和言論自由，及不讓學生發聲，H提到政權侵入校園的指稱亦必然不成立。而H稱教授沒了傳承人文精神的自由，也沒有證據，只是毫無根據的假設猜測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，文章在無提出任何客觀基礎下，指中大學術自由受到威脅需要保護，是「提供錯誤的事實以攻擊警方執法，並美化暴動者的行為」；文章亦忽略警方當時須處理發生於中大的暴動，「反之，文章塑造警方打壓學生的形象。」官又指，文章嵌入錄影片段，比較校園暴動當時及兩年後的景象，而暴動時多個景象可見「光復香港，時代革命」等抗爭口號標語。官認為，《立場》藉文章「意圖重新展示抗爭口號標語，重燃已經冷卻的暴力抗爭，引起公衆對特區政府及警方的憎恨」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒幸彤獲獎報道裁非煽動-官文章屬新聞報道&quot;&gt;鄒幸彤獲獎報道裁非煽動 官：文章屬新聞報道&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒幸彤獲頒發「中國傑出民主人士獎」的報導，引述其得獎感言，當中隱喻2019年修例事件所引起的執法行動及訂立《國安法》等政策，是中共極權打壓民主社會制度及法律、破壞自由、開放社會的行為。法官指，「細閱文章後，考慮到文章屬新聞報道」，裁定證據不足以證明具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定，涉案17篇文章中有11篇具有煽動意圖。就涉《國安法》相關執法行動及司法程序的文章，法官裁定陳沛敏、區家麟、羅冠聰共6篇博客文章均具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，6篇文章在沒有提出任何客觀基礎下，攻擊《國安法》等條文及相關執法檢控程序，引起憎恨政府和司法。其中區家麟〈穿官袍戴假髮演一台爛戲〉提及人大可隨時釋法，「識時務的國安法官」自會明了新時代之「公正」為何物，官批評「是不折不扣的藐視法庭行為」；〈「煽動」作為一種法律武器〉指法官被測試、訓練及無自主，官批「嚴重破壞司法正當性」。法官又指，〈災難現場〉完全罔顧《蘋果》高層非因傳媒身分被捕，而是涉勾結外國勢力，無基礎下攻擊執法；〈2020香港新詞〉聲稱一國兩制在2020已終結，亦是抹黑《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳沛敏文章，官批評以激烈煽情字眼攻擊政府，並將「快必」譚得志煽動案與另兩宗「不能互相比對」的案件相比，煽動公眾對政府仇恨；羅冠聰文章指導讀者以「非政治」組織聯絡及蔓延開去，煽動市民準備隨時再行動，削弱中央管治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳沛敏文章裁煽動以不能互相比對例子煽公眾對政府仇恨&quot;&gt;陳沛敏文章裁煽動：以不能互相比對例子煽公眾對政府仇恨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳沛敏博客文章〈這星期給香港人的通識題〉，提及譚得志因發表煽動文字被控、一名12歲女童違反限聚令被警圍捕、一名巴士司機在遊行現場響咹被以危險駕駛等拘捕，問讀者哪件事會引起其憎恨、藐視政府。官認為，文章主旨為攻擊譚得志案的執法及檢控，並利用另外兩案負面描述警方執法以加攻擊效果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官續指，陳顯然利用一般人憐愛和同情女童的心態，但譚得志的案件與其餘兩案不同，陳沒有說清楚，譚是多次在街頭散播煽動言論，三度被捕才被起訴。官指，另兩案均涉單一警方執法投訴，但譚得志是針對政權合法性和認受性作攻擊，以此相比「絕不恰當」：「作者顯然以不能互相比對的例子來煽動公眾對政府的仇恨。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官又指，陳無疑明示或暗示支持譚得志，及指拘捕譚構成不合理打壓，導致人們憎恨政府及執法機關，批評陳完全漠視警方須執法，沒有提出任何客觀基礎，便以激烈煽情字眼攻擊政府，如「政權殺快必儆香港人，紅線不斷收龍門不斷搬，反正誰大誰惡誰就可以指鹿為馬」，顯然抹黑政府、執法機關及法庭，裁定屬煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;羅冠聰文章裁煽動煽動市民做好準備隨時行動削中央管治&quot;&gt;羅冠聰文章裁煽動：煽動市民做好準備隨時行動、削中央管治&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就羅冠聰博客文章〈在國安法下的新常態，我們應如何反抗和思考〉，提及《國安法》讓與當權者合流的親建制人士「擁有濫用法律的話語，在各個體制中去進行思想以及言論壓制」，並舉例香島中學有學生因使用「光時」相片，遭校方記兩個大過、勒令停課一周，最終退學轉校。官指，該例子「顛倒是非黑白」，指羅抹黑《國安法》為打壓思想及言論自由的工具，完全不理會在學校散播港獨思想，是破壞香港特區在回歸後的憲制地位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官又指，《國安法》「將以往法律漏洞堵塞」，令老師可「不怕被人濫用言論自由作為武器，無所畏懼地教導誤入歧途的學生」，羅卻把老師說成與當權者同流合污，更散播恐懼指《國安法》下更多個體之間會互相監察，破壞人與人之間的信任及公民社會關係，並抹黑政府用《國安法》斷裂人與人之間的連結，再提出港人應如何反抗《國安法》管治。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官認為，文章對《國安法》的描述，「完全沒有客觀基礎，等同製造恐懼以作攻擊」，文章「更指導讀者低調以『非政治』組織聯絡、隱藏及蔓延開去」，目的「顯然是煽動香港市民做好準備隨時再行動，削弱中央管治以及擴闊對其戰線」，裁定屬煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2020香港新詞挑動附和追求港獨者情緒&quot;&gt;〈2020香港新詞〉：挑動、附和追求港獨者情緒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區家麟博客文章〈2020香港新詞〉，官指區「聲稱一國兩制在2020已經終結」，但《基本法》早訂明香港是中國不可分離的一部分，《國安法》的頒布，只不過是在反修例運動港獨風氣盛行、多人爭取外國協助後，重申中國主權，令中國主權不會受到侵害，加上《國安法》或任何條文也無提及影響兩制，區指2020年「一國兩制」確診是抹黑政府和《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就區提及「一個承諾的破滅」，官指顯然指全面直選特首和立法會承諾無落實，惟官指《基本法》只承諾港人高度自治，「全面直選當然視乎本地的情況」，「當香港有不少人要求中央完全不過問香港的事務時，這就等同獨立，這是不可能容許的」，因此區文章「只是挑動和附和那些仍然追求香港獨立的人的情緒」，而區對每個新詞的解釋「只是他在作出政治表述」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區稱「『國安』法律武器橫空出世，示範『要法律有法律』的時代」，官指此前香港完全無法律保障國安，而保護國安「當然是國家的事」，國家可授權特區自行立法、亦可由國家立法，2019年運動衍生的政治問題必須即時解決，《國安法》立法刻不容緩。官又指，區不可能不知，立法會在反修例運動期間「根本完全不能運作」，因泛民選出內會主席也用了半年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官終指，文章提及「一國兩制確診，插喉彌留」、「一個奇跡的崩壞」、「管治瘟疫」、「暴政之下，香港出現第一代政治犯」、「苛政猛於武肺」，是對憲制、中央及特區政府管治形容「極為負面」，又以「猙獰面目」形象化地抺黑中國外交官，並在無提出客觀基礎下，攻擊《國安法》以至司法系統，裁定屬煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;穿官袍戴假髮演一台爛戲不折不扣藐視法庭&quot;&gt;〈穿官袍戴假髮演一台爛戲〉：不折不扣藐視法庭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區家麟博客文章〈穿官袍戴假髮演一台爛戲〉，文章批評《國安法》適用範圍過闊，又批評指定法官制度，質疑法官是否可獨立公正地處理案件，並批評保釋條款和不設陪審團審訊。官逐點反駁，指「區家麟不是律師，當然他可以索取法律意見，更可以做研究」，但他從無指出《國安法》哪些條文與其他國家，包括普通法國家不同；官又指，只要區做研究或索取法律意見，就會了解條文「必須依照法例詮釋原則來訂定它的意思，並不容許執法機構濫權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官續引唐英傑案和黎智英案等，指法庭清楚說明保釋不涉有罪假設，外國亦有將可取保釋的舉證責任放在被告而不屬違憲，又指北愛爾蘭和英國也可不設陪審團，被裁不違人權法。官指，文章對《國安法》作出的控訴，「除了投訴外，沒有任何實質的理據」，連最低限度，《國安法》與其他國家法例相比，是否存有不尋常的條例也沒有指出，「本席相信是，他根本未能指出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對文章提「律政司司長追殺政敵，絕不手軟，可以覆核刑期，可以上訴再上訴」，官指這些程序本是香港法律一部份，非由《國安法》提供；就文章提「法律程序可有人大常委守尾門」，官指人大常委功能等同英國國會，當然有權在符合《基本法》情況下解釋法律。至於區稱，因人大常委可隨時說明和釋法，「識時務的國安法官們，自會明了新時代之『公正』為何物」，官指「這是不折不扣的藐視法庭行為」，強調所有法官都要跟着法官誓詞履行職務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官指文章在沒有提出任何客觀基礎下，指《國安法》令政府權力擴展至沒有邊界，被律政司利用打壓政敵，而法官又不能或不會獨立公正地處理案件。文章亦忽略頒布實施《國安法》的必要（見《5.28決定》），及類似法律及相關制度亦存在於西方民主國家，裁定屬煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;煽動作為一種法律武器無基礎下攻擊煽動罪打壓言論自由&quot;&gt;〈「煽動」作為一種法律武器〉：無基礎下攻擊煽動罪打壓言論自由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區家麟博客文章〈「煽動」作為一種法律武器〉，提到「喊一句『結束一黨專政』，就是指控你煽動的大好良機，寫在綱領上三十載行禮如儀，如今有可能變成顛覆」，「覺得冒犯的言論就視作煽動，再把冒犯言論等同煽動暴力、甚至等同煽動顛覆國家，然後把指控當作罪證，未審先囚」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官指區在文中對言論自由作出詮釋，然後根據他的定義批評有關煽動罪的法例和判決，認為文章在沒有提出任何客觀基礎下，攻擊《國安法》及《刑事罪行條例》有關煽動的條文為政權所濫用的法律武器，打壓言論自由。文章又指法官被測試、訓練及沒有自主，嚴重破壞香港司法正當性，裁定屬煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;災難現場無基礎下攻擊蘋果日報案執法檢控&quot;&gt;〈災難現場〉：無基礎下攻擊《蘋果日報》案執法檢控&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就區家麟博客文章〈災難現場〉，批評《國安法》下針對《蘋果日報》5名高層的執法及檢控行動。官指，區「完全罔顧陳沛敏及其他蘋果高層不是因為他們傳媒工作者的身份被拘捕，而是因為他們涉干犯危害國家安全罪，並且與外國或境外勢力勾結」，而區沒理由知道控方掌握何證據，亦不可能知《蘋果》高層做過什麼事，但《蘋果》東主黎智英與外國政要有聯絡，是一般大眾都知道的事，是否構成罪行法庭當然無需決定，但區「不可能斷言說警方的拘捕行動是完全沒有根據」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官又指，區在文章只是形容《蘋果》高層是「記者」，留在「災難現場」，「完全是沒有事實根據的比喻，其目的只是抹黑這次執法的行動。」而區稱「國安法下，我們正目睹一場災難，一場人權災難、法治災難」，亦全無根據。官指，區稱《國安法》下未審先囚，但陳沛敏2021年6月被捕後，仍獲准保釋，至正式檢控時控方才申請將她扣留，但區對這些現象「視而不見」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官指文章在沒有提出任何客觀基礎下，攻擊《國安法》於個別案件執行，包括攻擊律政司與法庭，裁定屬煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，在當時社會動盪、政治氣氛極為熾熱、大量市民不滿甚至反政府下，上述文章內容對國家安全或公眾秩序安全造成潛在破壞，意圖嚴重破壞中央或特區政府權威及香港司法，具有煽動意圖，即引起憎恨中央或香港政府、引起憎恨司法等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，法官郭偉健裁定涉案17篇文章中11篇具煽動意圖。就被告是否具犯罪意圖，鍾沛權供稱《立場》追求普世價值，但不是政治平台，只是履行傳媒責任。惟法官引述創刊辭提到「堅信我城的未來，應該由香港人自主」、「香港，是香港人的主場」等，批鍾稱《立場》對政治主張無立場「絕對是謊話」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判詞又引述《立場》就6.12、7.21和《國安法》的社論，認為引起仇警情緒、借題發揮指控或暗喻警黑勾結，官並指白衣人非「無差別襲擊」，社論塑造站內人士為「絕對的無辜者」並不持平。就鍾提「借來的地方」、「借來的時間」等，法官認為顯示他眷戀英國統治時代、不接受香港回歸；提「願我們萬眾一心，冒著炮火前行」亦無疑為示威者打氣，營運《立場》目的是與示威者一起抗爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官裁定，《立場》政治理念是「本土主義」，媒體路線是「支持及促進香港自主」，反修例期間成為抺黑和中傷中央及特區政府的工具。考慮到上述媒體路線，法官認為兩名被告審批涉案文章，是知悉並認同文章的煽動意圖，提供《立場》作發布平台，意圖煽動憎恨政府等，「無論如何，至少罔顧煽動後果」。法官亦裁定，蔡東豪提供資金營運《立場》，並邀請鍾沛權加入編輯，顯然是可控制《立場》運作，位置比鍾沛權高的「主腦」，與被告有協議持續發布煽動文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指僅17篇文被指煽動證無意圖-官控方無承認其他非煽動&quot;&gt;辯方指僅17篇文被指煽動、證無意圖 官：控方無承認其他非煽動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官裁定，涉案17篇文章中有11篇具有煽動意圖，繼而考慮被告是否知道文章具煽動意圖，及被告是否具犯罪意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾沛權作供時稱，他們只是履行傳媒責任，記錄時代呼聲，而《立場》不是政治平台，只是提供開放平台讓不同聲音都可以發表。辯方亦指，《立場》運作7年，發布逾十萬篇文章，單控罪期間也有兩萬篇，但受質疑文章只有17篇，控方未能指稱其他超過99.9%文章是煽動刊物。因此較合理推論，是鍾沛權和林紹桐一直無任何煽動意圖，只是做好傳媒角色，發布關乎公眾利益資訊及多元意見，涉案文章是多元意見中的「極少部份」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為陳詞「幫助不大」，指控方從無承認除了涉案文章，《立場》全部其他文章均非煽動刊物；而且控方是在審訊開始後，始知警方曾下載587篇而非30篇文章，但避免擴大檢控基礎對被告不公，才不依賴新披露文章作證據，不可能引伸至17篇以外文章均非煽動刊物的推論。官亦指，沒有證據確立，「《立場》的其他99.9%文章是否沒有包含煽動文章」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官裁主場結束因商業決定-非因打壓而非正常死亡&quot;&gt;官裁《主場》結束因商業決定 非因打壓而「非正常死亡」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官續據《立場》資金來源、股東政治背景、社論、發布文章、刊物、人事任命等，考慮被告是否具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官先指，鍾沛權供稱從開始營運至結束，《立場》運作都是跟隨創刊辭進行，辯方亦指創刊辭說明創辦和營運《立場》的協議，因此創刊辭為極具關鍵性證據，可顯示《立場》營運方針。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官續指從創刊辭可見，鍾沛權、余家輝和蔡東豪創辦《立場》，目的是繼承已結束的《主場新聞》。鍾供稱蔡因感到壓力及人身自由的威脅而結束《主場》，3人其後商議作信託安排，放棄股權利益和處置股份權利，將《立場》股權交由信託安排長期持有，望外界知道即使針對任何一名創辦人也無作用，因他們無權力結束此公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟郭官引述蔡東豪2014年結束《主場》時的帖文，提到他恐懼和誤判，每次往返內地也提心吊膽，認為蔡的恐懼「只是源自他的內心敏感，甚至想像」、「沒有事實根據」，「他聲稱的恐懼和擔心除了是他的感覺之外，沒有任何實質的事件發生過」。對創刊辭明言或暗喻，《主場》受打壓而「非正常死亡」，郭官亦指「這不是事實」，認為結束《主場》是蔡自主的商業決定，因《主場》兩年來從未達收支平衡、亦無廣告收入，「《主場》不是『非正常死亡』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，創刊辭明言或暗喻信託安排是為了抗拒外來打壓，法官同認為不是事實，指獲取創始資金和防止蔡東豪單方面結束《立場》才是原因。法官又裁定鍾沛權向法庭隱瞞信託受益人、即贊助人的身分，該部分證供不可信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;引創刊辭指立場主張本土主義不只守護普世價值-鍾稱無立場絕對是謊話&quot;&gt;引創刊辭指《立場》主張本土主義、不只守護普世價值 鍾稱無立場「絕對是謊話」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《立場》的立場，鍾沛權供稱，《立場》對最核心的普世價值有追求及堅持，但對政治主張「係冇一個立場嘅」。惟官指與《創刊辭》內容不吻合，引述當中提到「《立場》一如《主場》，以香港為本位，堅信我城的未來，應該由香港人自主」，認為已說明其立場，即「堅持的信念，就是香港未來由香港人自主」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官續指，《立場》成立於2014年12月，當時本土主義、民族論等與中國分離的理論在香港社會尤其大學界興起，加上雨傘運動剛失敗告終，作為「佔中十死士」之一的蔡東豪「做逃兵」，但又聲稱再做一次與《主場》相同路線的傳媒，《立場》為吸引讀者和支持者，絕對有必要向公眾說明其政治立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官續指，《立場》的立場「絕對不會只是守護普世價值」，引創刊辭稱「以《立場》為名，我們一如以往，敢於宣示立場、不掩飾、不廻避」，必然指《立場》某些信念非人人都持有，甚至可能引人反感。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又形容創刊辭最後一句是「重點中的重點」：「香港，是香港人的主場；守護主場，是我們絕不退讓的立場」，認為明顯指「香港是屬於香港人的地方，香港人擁有控制權和處於主導地位，可對所有事務作出決定，有絕對的權力和影響力，其他人在香港只是客人，對香港事務無權作決定」。而「不退讓」的對立一方，官認為必然是指對香港行使主權的中國，及執行香港特區憲制秩序和地位的中央和特區政府。法官指，此句以強烈語氣表達出《立場》政治主張，「就是排除中國由港人自主香港的本土主義」，認為《立場》在創刊辭將政治主張「闡述得清清楚楚」，鍾沛權證供中說《立場》對政治主張沒有立場，「絕對是謊話」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，從《立場》的成立、創刊辭內容及信託安排中信託受益人資料被刻意移走及隱瞞，肯定鍾沛權和蔡東豪等人，替不願意披露身分的金主營運《立場》，「目的就是支持和促進香港本土自主的本土主義」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官612社論塑造警隊濫權引起仇警情緒&quot;&gt;官：6.12社論塑造警隊濫權、引起仇警情緒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判詞續引由鍾沛權審批的《立場》多篇社論，證明鍾具煽動意圖。就2019年6月12日兩天後發表的社論〈為何我們「針對」警察〉，法官指《立場》當然可發布社論監察甚至批評警方，但必須考慮和分析所有透過誠實和合理努力可查證到的事實，再基於事實「誠實和道德地」表達意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，社論首段提「我們可以自豪地表明立場：我們『針對』警察」，認為並非純粹指出警隊錯處，而是加入情感、使用挑動情緒的字句，對警察展示敵意。社論續指，並非針對警察個人，而是警察作為全港唯一可合法對公眾使用武力的執法部隊，「他們的行為必須被最嚴格的標準審視，他們的權力必須受到監察」，原因包括警隊武力與示威者不平等、多次濫權濫捕但受懲處追究僅少數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官同意，警隊行使武力須有節制及受監察，但社論提出的理由「似是而非」，指「警隊和示威者不是進行體育競技，裝備差距是必然的」，又指有示威者掟磚，質疑《立場》以雙方武力懸殊替示威者提供開脫藉口，淡化及認可其非法行為。法官又指，警權不是不受制衡及監督，並以朱經緯案和七警案為例，指警員因濫權濫捕而負上刑責的案件「時有發生」；而社論離6.12僅兩天，當時會否有警員被起訴或接受紀律聆訊根本無人可預知，《立場》提出「濫權警員毋須或極少承擔後果」，只是散播沒有基礎的陳述，引起仇警情緒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，社論將個別警員在示威現場執行職務的犯錯，全部提升為警隊的系統性犯錯，但無提供證據，只是將警隊「塑造為一支濫用權力的執法隊伍」。官並指，6.12若不是有示威者衝擊防線，警方根本不會執法，「警方的人數遠遠不及示威者，沒有理由挑起事端」，批評《立場》將警方行動描述為替行政機關的任意莽為保駕護航，全無事實基礎，亦無基礎行政機關利用警隊推行暴政。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官白衣人非無差別襲擊721社論鼓吹制度更換&quot;&gt;官：白衣人非無差別襲擊、7.21社論鼓吹制度更換&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2019年7.21事件後兩天、由鍾沛權撰寫的社論〈記者遇襲事大　制度崩壞事更大〉，法官指文章一開始將警方在上環以催淚彈等射擊示威分子的畫面，與在元朗白衣暴徒襲擊市民的畫面放在一起，「容易令人聯想兩件事有關連，即警察和白衣暴徒都是向他人施擊，他們同一陣線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就鍾指白衣暴徒「無差別」襲擊市民，法官質疑基於什麼證供作此判斷，並指當時兩批人在站內互相咒罵和擲物，站內人曾向白衣人射水，其後站內人士走上月台，白衣人原本無追上，但因月台上有人向他們擲物，才引發白衣人跑上月台襲擊。法官指，「毫無疑問，白衣人的行為錯誤，犯下嚴重罪行，但他們不是『無差別』襲擊市民，而是與他們發生了一段時間口頭和動作糾紛的人，這些在站內的人因為他們的行為也必須承擔責任」，指社論將他們塑造為「絕對的無辜者」並不持平。法官又指，鍾絕對有權譴責暴徒襲擊記者，但《立場》其他文章從來無譴責示威者使用暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文中提到「不能忘記、默許、縱容以致促成配合這些暴行的制度崩壞」，鍾沛權作供時稱無提「警黑合謀」，只是想講「制度暴力」。但法官指鍾「不誠實」，指社論大篇幅說警方不行動、警方高層與懷疑行兇者勾肩搭背、「默許縱容以致配合黑勢力，借助他人之手，報復示威者」等，是指控或最低限度暗喻警察和黑社會分子勾結，又對警方用上嚴厲批評字眼「齒冷」、「萬死不足以蔽其辜」。法官認為，鍾將7.21事件「借題發揮」，並提出香港無民主制度致警暴出現、政府亦懶理，香港必須出現一個現時不具備的民主制度才可改變，是在「鼓吹制度的更換」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官使用借來的地方等用語-顯示鍾戀殖&quot;&gt;官：使用「借來的地方」等用語 顯示鍾戀殖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於2020年7月1日社論〈堅守每寸自由土壤　用盡每絲縫隙中的微光〉，法官認為是「散播恐慌」，指發布時《國安法》生效不足12小時，法例實質上如何執行他根本無從得知，當中對《國安法》可制止混亂及保障國安隻字不提，並將香港描繪為極權政府統治的地方、意指香港將完全喪失自由，認為鍾是質疑中央和特區政府合法性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，鍾不接納一國兩制憲制秩序，使用如「借來的地方」、「借來的時間」等英政府管治時形容香港的用語，顯示他「眷戀英國統治的時代」；而鍾提到「一河之隔，香港寶地，源自於大陸的差異，原始難得的自由，成為強國邊陲不滅的榮光」，亦顯示他根本不接受香港回歸中國。至於文末「願我們萬眾一心，冒著炮火前行，毋負此生」，法官指無疑鍾及《立場》替示威者打氣，並說明與他們一起行動，鍾繼續營運《立場》的目的，「就是與示威者一起抗爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 左起：林紹桐、鍾沛權（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官林紹桐稱望令讀者理解運動參與者-必然支持示威者&quot;&gt;官：林紹桐稱望令讀者理解運動參與者 必然支持示威者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於林紹桐的意圖，法官引述他2019年12月出席「網絡媒體高峰會」的發言，林提及做直播有很多武力場面，但不能反映背後原因，故會做訪問讓受訪者解釋，並稱無論做直播、即時或專題報導，也希望呈現趨近事實的情況，令讀者更理解運動及參與運動的人，從而有共同基礎去討論、評價、甚至參與運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，「毫無疑問，他（林）是要求觀眾不要因為示威者使用暴力或嚴重暴力而與示威者分割」，又指「明顯地，他是試圖要求觀眾諒解示威者使用武力」，並由此推論，「他本人的態度必然是支持示威者」，肯定林紹桐和《立場》的立場就是支持反修例和示威者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官遊行相片現港獨旗反映立誌主旨-推動本土主義力量&quot;&gt;官：遊行相片現港獨旗反映《立誌》主旨 推動本土主義力量&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於《立場》出版的實體刊物《立誌》，法官指封面首張相片是2019年6月9日遊行，有示威者舉「奪回香港」橫額及「香港獨立」旗幟，指相片出現在序言前，「位置突出」，可反映《立誌》主旨。官續指，《立誌》刊出2016旺角暴動案判囚7年的盧建民訪問，提及6.12事件是本土派2016旺角暴動的延續，鼓勵讀者長期抗爭，可見《立誌》除了是《立場》史冊，「亦是一本本土派的發展和傳承史冊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，《立誌》內梁繼平訪問談及7.1衝擊立法會，是以抗爭行動是「屬於每一人的共同體」來爭取群眾支持暴力抗爭。法官認為，《立誌》其實是一份「抗爭行動記錄」，「旨在紀錄推動本土派透過反修例運動，發展成爭取香港自主的本土主義力量」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官立場政治理念為本土主義-反修例期間成抹黑政府工具&quot;&gt;官：《立場》政治理念為「本土主義」 反修例期間成抹黑政府工具&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官終表示，從《立場》成立的背景、其《創刊辭》、三篇社論、實體刊物《立誌》，裁定「《立場》的政治理念是本土主義，其媒體路線為支持及促進香港自主，在反修例期間更成為抺黑和中傷中央及特區政府的工具」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官裁二人知悉並認同文章煽動意圖-以立場作平台煽動&quot;&gt;官裁二人知悉並認同文章煽動意圖 以《立場》作平台煽動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於發布文章是否具犯罪意圖，法官指鍾沛權作為《立場》總編輯，承認審批其中10篇被裁煽動文章，考慮到《立場》媒體路線，法官裁定鍾知悉並認同文章煽動意圖，提供《立場》作發布平台，煽動憎恨中央或香港政府、激起香港居民企圖不循合法途徑促致改變依法制定的事項、及憎恨司法，「至少罔顧煽動後果」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於餘下一篇中大衝突兩年專訪發布時，鍾沛權已離職，由林紹桐署任總編輯。法官相信鍾真是辭去總編一職，因他需更多時間探訪被扣留的妻子陳沛敏，但鍾「仍然關注着和對《立場》的運作提供意見」。法官並指，該篇專訪發布時嵌入片段重新展示抗爭口號標語，而警方去信投訴為「誤導偏頗」下林仍然堅持發布，加上《立場》媒體路線，及林曾以副總編輯身分出席網媒論壇高峰會，發言支持反修例運動，裁定林同樣知悉並認同文章煽動意圖，提供《立場》作發布平台，煽動憎恨中央或香港政府及憎恨司法，至少罔顧煽動後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於首被告《立場》母公司，即《立場》東主、承印人和出版人，法官指公司聘請鍾沛權及林紹桐為其制作及發布文章，當兩人在受僱工作範圍內發布這些文章，亦等同公司發布，兩人的意圖亦等同公司的意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官蔡東豪為位置比鍾沛權高主腦-與被告有協議發布煽動刊物&quot;&gt;官：蔡東豪為位置比鍾沛權高主腦 與被告有協議發布煽動刊物&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於被告間是否有串謀協議，法官指，蔡東豪提供資金營運《立場》、簽署鍾沛權僱傭合約、批准鍾加薪、批准調動資金予英國分社，鍾亦承認《立場》是蔡供他運作的平台，認為蔡東豪顯然是位置在鍾沛權之上，可控制《立場》運作的「另一主腦」。而鍾沛權及林紹桐被捕後，《立場》短時間內停止運作，法官「肯定是蔡東豪的決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，蔡東豪作為位置比鍾沛權高的主腦，唯一合理推論是他必然知道發布的內容；而鍾稱兩人在重要核心價值或大是大非事件上「立場相若」，鍾亦先在蔡營運的《主場新聞》任編輯，並獲蔡邀請擔任《立場》總編，一直任職至妻子被捕，蔡必然認同鍾就發布刊物所作的決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官裁定，唯一合理推論是蔡東豪代表《立場》母公司，與鍾沛權就《立場》發布刊物有所協議，持續發布煽動文章。法官又指，鍾離任總編後由林紹桐接手，必然得到蔡東豪同意批准，林在接手時加入上述串謀協議，因此裁定全部被告罪名成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官不會考慮讀者留言推論煽動性&quot;&gt;官：不會考慮讀者留言推論煽動性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就控方認為，讀者於《立場》社交平台留言反映文章煽動效果，官指《立場》容許留言在其網頁或社交平台展示，令讀者可以閱讀，相信《立場》可被視為「發布」這些留言。但由於本案煽動刊物是《立場》發布的文章，而非文章引發的留言，留言亦相信非被告作出，無證據他們認同、也沒有法例要求將不認同留言刪去，法官應自行決定涉案文章是否具煽動意圖，留言者對文章反應不可用作證明事實的證據，因此法庭不會考慮讀者留言以推論文章是否具煽動意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】《立場新聞》母公司、前總編輯鍾沛權及前署任總編輯林紹桐被控「串謀發布煽動刊物」罪成，國安法指定法官郭偉健裁定涉案17篇文章中，11篇具煽動意圖。本案為首宗涉傳媒被指煽動的審訊，就控方是否須證明被告具煽動意圖，郭官在2022年的「羊村繪本案」曾裁定被告須「蓄意煽動」才可入罪；惟他在本案推翻兩年前裁決，認為「不能有效維護國家安全」，並將犯罪意圖擴至「罔顧煽動後果」也可入罪，認為準則既可有效維護國安，亦可保障言論及出版自由權利。至於辯方就煽動罪合憲性的爭議，認為須證有實際國安風險等才能入罪，法官引譚得志煽動案上訴庭裁決駁回，指言論被裁定具煽動意圖，必然視為對國安造成潛在破壞而須制止，毋須再考慮實際國安風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方爭議條文字眼含糊-官上訴庭裁合憲&quot;&gt;辯方爭議條文字眼含糊 官：上訴庭裁合憲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊期間，控辯雙方有不同法律爭議，包括控方是否須證明有關刊物構成國家安全實際風險；發布煽動刊物罪所須的犯罪意圖；以及執行相稱性是否適用於本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方認為，煽動罪條文中「憎恨」、「藐視」、「離叛」、「不滿」等字眼，令煽動意圖定義含糊主觀，適用範圍過於廣泛及恣意，認為控方須證發布者及刊物具意圖煽動公眾騷亂或動亂，及犯罪行為對國家安全構成實際風險才能入罪，否則限制言論自由便變成不合理及不必要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官引譚得志煽動案上訴庭判詞，裁定字眼符合法律確定性原則，屬合憲；又指相關字眼不能憑空應用，須整體考慮案中實際情況，尤其顧及防止煽動言論對國安造成潛在破壞的罪行目的。官又引上訴庭指，煽動罪目標禁止的是意圖挑動公眾情緒，致產生「強烈」敵意及不滿等情緒，從而煽惑他人否定或質疑政權合法性，意圖「嚴重」破壞政府權威等言論，認為相關字眼「不是過於廣泛或恣意」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官矯正錯誤辯護理由-明顯不適用於無客觀基礎言論&quot;&gt;官：矯正錯誤辯護理由 明顯不適用於無客觀基礎言論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《刑事罪行條例》第9（2）條提供的辯護理由，即指出政府措施、憲制、法例或司法上的錯誤，目的在矯正錯誤，並不構成煽動意圖。法官認為，該條明顯不適用於無客觀事實基礎、意圖嚴重破壞中央或特區政府權威等的言論。而由於上訴庭在快必案已裁定，普通法煽動罪元素不適用於香港成文法煽動罪，故拒納辯方指，須證明刊物和發布者具意圖煽動公眾騷亂或動亂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官毋須考慮是否有實際風險&quot;&gt;官：毋須考慮是否有實際風險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方須否證明涉案行為對國家安全構成「實際風險」，郭官續引上訴庭指，維護國家安全須同時平衡保障言論及出版自由等基本權利，而構成罪行言論必須對國家安全、公眾秩序及安全造成潛在破壞。法官指，當言論被評定為具煽動意圖，必然已考慮相關實際情況，視為對國安造成潛在破壞，須要制止；加上所指意圖是嚴重破壞政府權威，而上訴庭亦指聽眾是否被挑動也沒有關係，因此只要刊物被裁具煽動意圖，便不須另外再考慮是否構成實際國安風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官推翻羊村裁決-裁發布者僅罔顧煽動後果亦可入罪&quot;&gt;官推翻「羊村」裁決 裁發布者僅「罔顧煽動後果」亦可入罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方是否須證明被告具煽動意圖，法官郭偉健在「羊村繪本案」中，裁定控方須證明發布者本身有煽動意圖，「蓄意煽動」（specific intent）才能入罪。控方不同意，認為發布者知道文章具煽動意圖，甚至不預期文章有煽動效果，亦可罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，「本席在過往案件作出的裁決沒有約束力」，他必須根據控辯陳詞和所有新增案例，就這個議題再次裁決。他引快必案的上訴庭裁決，提到煽動性言詞可導致煽動行為或活動，危害國安、公共秩序或安全，而訂立煽動罪目的是避免這種「潛在的不良後果」。在此情況下，郭認為自己早前在「羊村繪本案」的裁決，即發布者須蓄意煽動方可罪成，不能有效維護國家安全，因為即使發布者罔顧煽動後果，只要並非蓄意煽動，罪名便不成立，「有違其預防性質」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭官指，「經重新考慮後」，認為適當的平衡，是要求控方證明發布者在發布煽動刊物時蓄意煽動，或明知刊物具煽動意圖但仍罔顧後果將它發布，便可裁罪名成立，意味發布時「蓄意煽動、或罔顧煽動後果而明知犯險」，便需承擔罪責。法官認為，此準則「既可有效維護國家安全，亦同時可適當保障言論及出版自由等基本權利」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官言論評定對國安造成潛在破壞-定罪自然合憲&quot;&gt;官：言論評定對國安造成潛在破壞 定罪自然合憲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「執行相稱性」測試是否適用，法官重申當言論被評定為對國安造成潛在破壞，及意圖嚴重破壞政府權威而須制止，「定罪亦自然符合執行相稱性，不須另作考慮」；又指終院在8.18流水式集會案確認，當法庭應用合憲條文考慮被告是否有罪，不須另外考慮定罪是否符合執行相稱性原則。加上終院上訴委員會在處理譚得志上訴許可申請時，無就煽動罪條文違憲的論點批出上訴許可，因此裁定辯方憲制挑戰失敗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官法例無要求傳媒遵專業守則-危國安就會受限&quot;&gt;官：法例無要求傳媒遵專業守則 危國安就會受限&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方就新聞界職責及角色，引述英國廣播公司（BBC）、香港記者協會等專業守則，又列出歐洲人權法庭等案例，指傳媒有責任傳遞與公眾利益事項有關的資訊和觀點，否則新聞界便不能擔當監察政府的第四權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，在考慮傳媒發布言論時，唯一限制就是須遵守《香港人權法案》第16（3）條行使意見和發表的自由時，附有「特別責任和義務」，包括「保障國家安全或公共秩序，或公共衛生或風化」。法官指，香港法例無訂下法定要求，指令傳媒遵守哪個專業守則，亦無法例限制傳媒不能成為政治或倡議型平台，「但任何危害國家安全或公共秩序的言論或刊物就會受到限制」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;引歐洲人權判例指思想市場能被言論扭曲&quot;&gt;引歐洲人權判例指思想市場能被言論扭曲&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又特別提到辯方引用的歐洲人權法院判例，當中提到對新聞工作者的保障，受制於須真誠行事（acting in good faith），又強調驗證事實和保持公正的重要性，即使作出價值判斷也必須有足夠的事實基礎。法官並指，「值得注意的是，現代的宣傳不會倚靠整套謊言而是夾雜事實」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，就鍾沛權作供提及編採方針和原則，法庭不需裁定是否正確，只有一點要提出，就是鍾強調的「思想市場」理念「有它的限制」。法官續引述2024年一則歐洲人權法院判例Graham William Phillips v The Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs，提到言論自由對民主社會的貢獻，建基於一個有效民主的自由思想市場，而「該市場能被言論本身扭曲（That marketplace can be distorted by speech itself）」。該判詞又指，網絡上假帳戶、網軍、機械人（bots）等，可令真誠的自由言論淹沒，並隨獨裁者或權勢者等所想，由不誠實的論述取代。政治宣傳和假資訊，尤其在戰時，可侵蝕民主和國安，能損害民主社會的基石，亦是現代戰爭武器的重要一部分。法官未有就案例作進一步闡述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，陪審團今（29日）裁定6人就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪及「串謀謀殺」罪不成立，當中包括已還柙3年半的張俊富。但張於開審前承認「管有爆炸品」及「無牌管有槍械」共兩罪，法官張慧玲判囚18個月。辯方求情指，張自2021年3月起至今已還柙3年半，故希望法庭判即時獲釋的刑期。據了解，計算刑期後張可以即時獲釋。法庭明天將會處理認罪被告吳智鴻及鍾雪瑩的求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;案情指張俊富與黃振強將煙花放貨倉&quot;&gt;案情指張俊富與黃振強將煙花放貨倉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張俊富（案發時22歲）早前承認「管有爆炸品」及「無牌管有槍械」罪。案情指，張俊富於12月3日凌晨，曾經與黃振強取得兩箱煙花，並放置在荃灣貨倉。在他被捕後，警方於其住所檢取貨倉鎖匙，並前往搜查。最後發現有防彈板、兩盒煙花爆竹、4罐胡椒噴劑、10支伸縮棍、大量示威裝備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方求情已還柙3年半望法庭判即時獲釋刑期&quot;&gt;辯方求情：已還柙3年半、望法庭判即時獲釋刑期&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表張俊富的大律師李國輔求情指，張案發時22歲，現在27歲，自2021年3月起至今已還柙3年半，故希望法庭判即時獲釋的刑期。辯方又指，張乘搭快艇到內地水域被捕後，已服刑一段時間，送返港後再因妨礙司法公正罪判囚10個月。辯方認為法庭可考慮上述因素，以及張主動帶警察去搜查涉案地點，而給予更多扣減。辯方希望法庭就「管有爆炸品」罪判不多於2年，就「無牌管有槍械」罪以6個月為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官明顯作破壞之用不接納用作自衛&quot;&gt;官：明顯作破壞之用、不接納用作自衛&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲判刑時指，涉案的炮仗煙花可以令人燒傷，而且擺放在荃灣貨倉明顯打算作破壞之用，就「管有爆炸品」罪以20個月監禁量刑。至於涉案的胡椒噴劑，張官不接納辯方指作為自衛用途，明顯是與「屠龍」的示威行動有關，唯一合理推論是噴向警方，就「無牌管有槍械」罪以15個月為量刑起點。張官認為，張因乘搭快艇潛逃到內地才會被判監，因此是咎由自取，並非減刑因素。張官給予25%認罪扣減，「管有爆炸品」罪其中3個月分期，合共判囚18個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「管有爆炸品」罪指，張俊富於2019年12月3日至12月8日期間（包括首尾兩日），在荃灣致利工業大廈內一單位，明知而管有、保管或控制兩盒煙花。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「無牌管有槍械」罪指，張俊富於2019年12月8日，在同地無牌管有4個載有諾香草胺的噴罐（即胡椒噴劑）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，被裁定《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，以及「串謀謀殺」罪不成立。賴振邦被裁定交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪成立。女被告劉佩凝的「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪則不成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張俊富亦涉12港人案，在內地服刑7個月後返港，其後承認妨礙司法公正罪判囚10個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表張俊富的大律師李國輔今午求情指，張案發時22歲，現在27歲，自2021年3月起至今已還柙3年半，故希望法庭判即時獲釋的刑期。辯方又指，張乘搭快艇到內地水域被捕後，已服刑一段時間，送返港後再因妨礙司法公正罪判囚10個月。辯方認為法庭可考慮上述因素，以及張主動帶警察去搜查涉案地點，而給予更多扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Wagner Group ceasing to exist last year after the death of its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, it may seem that the threat from non-state actors on the battlefield in Ukraine has disappeared. However, while the most well-known group might have stopped its activities, Ukraine continues to attract various paramilitary groups, most of which hold far-right views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most notorious groups that is known for its involvement in Ukraine is Rusich, which has been actively involved in the conflict in Ukraine since 2014 and holds extreme right-wing, neo-Nazi beliefs. One of its leaders, Alexei Milchakov, became infamous not only for publicly and proudly calling himself a Nazi, but also for his penchant for sadistic violence after he made a video of himself killing and eating a puppy. It must be noted, however, that Rusich does not seem to be particularly popular among the Russian far right. Thus, Sergei Korotkih, one of the creators of the Russian National Socialist movement and an ally of Russia’s most infamous neo-Nazi, Maxim Martsinkevich (nicknamed Tesak), was quoted as saying that people like Milchakov are considered “losers” in the movement and see the war in Ukraine as an opportunity to gain traction on social media. This may be true, as the group’s social channels contain very little ideological content and the small amount that is available is mostly dedicated to the thrill of killing Ukrainian soldiers who, it appears, Rusich considers a second-class race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another far-right group is the Russian Imperial Movement (or specifically its military wing, the Imperial Legion) and its smaller affiliates, which consider themselves “nationalists”. They believe that Ukraine as a state should not exist and it is simply part of Russia; hence, they see their participation in the war as contributing to the unification of Russian territories, with the final goal of creating new Russian Empire with a monarch ruling it. The group’s social media is full of posts dedicated to explaining its views and justifying its involvement in Ukraine. It should be noted that despite its enthusiastic welcome of the war and active involvement, the group presents itself as an opposition to the Russian government. In its rhetoric, it appears to hope that its involvement will eventually help it achieve its strategic goal of changing the regime in Russia and seizing political power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, the so-called Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) has also gained a certain amount of fame as a Russian group fighting on Ukraine’s side. This group was founded in August 2022 by Denis Kapustin (now Nikitin), a Russian national from Germany. It is believed that Kapustin holds neo-Nazi views, and he has even been labelled as a “key figure in European extreme far-right circles” and “one of the most dangerous neo-Nazis in the region”. Another member of the movement, Alexei Levkin, used to be the head of neo-Nazi group Wotanjugend, and called Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik a hero. Several other members also have a history of expressing public support for extreme right-wing groups and terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nikitin himself, in an interview with PBS, said: “Islamisation, cultural Marxism, multiculturalism, I think all those – all those things are harmful. European culture is definitely endangered. I believe in things like the Great Replacement”. These and other comments made by Nikitin resonate with far-right ideology, which leaves no doubt as to his and his movement’s political views. It appears, however, from interviews with other members that the degree of acceptance of these views varies – some members say that they hold traditionalist views but do not agree with more extreme far-right ideas, and others have even argued that the image of RVC as being an extreme right group was created and promoted by their adversaries in Russia (the group is designated as a terrorist organisation in Russia). While this might be true, Russian neo-Nazis have expressed support for RVC on their social media (such as the Telegram channel “National Socialist”) and have even called for donations to help wounded RVC fighters receive medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It appears that despite the disappearance of the Wagner Group, Ukraine still remains an attractive target for various non-state actors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these, there are also two more groups supporting Ukraine – “Freedom of Russia Legion” and “Sibir Batalion” – however, there is not enough credible information to make firm conclusions about their ideological orientations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, it appears that despite the disappearance of the Wagner Group, Ukraine still remains an attractive target for various non-state actors, many of which hold extreme right-wing beliefs and are active on social media reporting about their activities and recruiting new members, as well as committing acts of violence. Their presence in the region is a reason for concern, as not only does it further aggravate the situation on the battlefield, but it also poses a security threat for Europe as these groups may attempt (as some already have) to move their activities beyond the borders of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（28日）踏入第82日審訊。3男6女陪審團昨（27日）早開始退庭商議8小時，仍未有結果，至今天繼續。陪審團提出3項問題，其中一項是，如達致不到有效裁決時，應該繼續討論，直至有人改變立場，還是尋求更多指引？法官張慧玲回答指，陪審團之間需互相借鑒及集思廣益，因此要考慮他人意見，並進行討論及辯論。有人最後可能會被說服並改變立場，亦有可能繼續堅持立場，但最重要是忠於自己的誓言，作出符合事實的裁決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陪審團問兩爆炸罪分別-官指涉恐怖主義罪需證明放公用場所及意圖致死&quot;&gt;陪審團問兩爆炸罪分別 官指涉恐怖主義罪需證明放公用場所及意圖致死&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陪審團提出了3項問題，並由法官張慧玲回答。首項問題為：「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪及作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，兩者的分別是否在知識上，對於「訂明標的」是否有認知？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官表示，「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪的元素，除了包括將炸彈放置在公用場所外，亦要有意圖導致他人死亡，必須滿足上述所有元素。而「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，則毋須考慮炸彈是否放置在指定地點，只需考慮是否有意圖通過爆炸造成相當可能危害他人生命。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陪審團問財產的嚴重損害定義-官指無定義要憑經驗決定&quot;&gt;陪審團問「財產的嚴重損害」定義 官指無定義、要憑經驗決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二項問題是，恐怖主義行為中「財產的嚴重損害」的定義是甚麼？張官表示，法例上沒有實質定義，陪審團需要運用其人生經驗及智慧決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陪審團問未能達有效裁決是否應繼續討論-官指需忠於自己誓言&quot;&gt;陪審團問未能達有效裁決是否應繼續討論 官指需忠於自己誓言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第三項問題是，如達致不到有效裁決時，應該繼續討論，直至有人改變立場，還是尋求更多指引？張官回答指，陪審團之間需互相借鑒及集思廣益，因此要考慮他人意見，並進行討論及辯論。有人最後可能會被說服並改變立場，亦有可能繼續堅持立場，但最重要是忠於自己的誓言，作出符合事實的裁決。若然最後未能達至最低要求的7比2裁決，陪審團可通知張官。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員涉與另一勇武小隊計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（28日）踏入第82日審訊。3男6女陪審團昨（27日）早開始退庭商議至今午達14小時。法官今早回答陪審團提出的3項問題，下午再回答另一問題。陪審團問到，經多番討論後，就其中兩條控罪未能達致有效裁決，即其中一位被告的交替控罪「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，以及「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，陪審團問是否交法官處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲指，陪審團現已商議達14小時，希望他們再用更多時間商議。若他們在法律問題上有疑問，或在證據上需要提醒，張官會盡量幫忙，但如果最後仍未能達致有效裁決，就可以告知張官，表示「唔係監你哋話一定要達到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;相隔約一小時後，陪審團再問，他們對恐怖主義行為中「財產嚴重損害」的定義未能達成共識，各人有不同定義，他們希望法官就財產損害的程度提供具體準則。張官表示，她不能提供指引，因這屬事實裁斷範疇，需要由陪審團自行決定是否屬於嚴重。張官希望他們繼續商議，嘗試達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vyKJhWw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】「法官閣下，我係伍健偉，本案被告，D28。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，昨天踏入求情第9天。參選新西、獲逾2萬票出線的伍健偉，沒有律師代表，選擇隔着被告欄的玻璃幕牆，向三位法官親自陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大約一個小時的陳情，身穿灰色西裝的伍健偉聲線響亮，不徐不疾地吐出一字一句。右手拿着筆記的他，不時望向旁聽席微笑，說到凝重處會抿嘴。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他說到參選原因——眼看有人犧牲自由甚至生命，他難以忍受自己毫不作為，「我有義務去繼承佢哋嘅信念」；他也相信政府是人民的僕人，港人應該亦值得擁有自由社會和民主制度。他又說，五大訴求合情合理，並非海市蜃樓的願望，他有責任為選民爭取；而當四年前61萬港人冒法律風險投票，作為代議士，「我哋有責任去保護支持我哋嘅香港市民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他於1995年9月6日出生。假若2020年9月6日的立法會選舉能如期舉行，他說當天的結果「可能會係我人生之中最榮幸收到嘅生日禮物」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在獄中近三年半，伍健偉說他願意為其行為負責，但不會為與選民共享的信念道歉：「我唔可以辜負人民嘅信任。」作為政治人物，他期許自己有承擔，竭盡所能留守到最後一刻，「我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落。」法官問他是否沒有悔意，他毫不猶䂊答：「冇錯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;展望將來，伍健偉打算放低政治人物身分，但仍望盡力貢獻社會——他覺得只要抱持自救互助的精神，記錄過去真相，活在真實當下，為未來做好真誠準備，「香港嘅未來，將會重拾光明，而香港人嘅理想，一定會實現。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;以下為伍健偉陳情全文和與法官的對答紀錄，由《獨媒》記者整理及謄寫，部分對答經刪節。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陽光底下的計劃&quot;&gt;陽光底下的計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我係伍健偉，本案被告，D28。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;喺我正式陳詞前，我想向之前代表我嘅資深大律師、大律師及律師團隊，感謝佢哋熱心同埋專業嘅服務。另外，我感恩社會各界對我哋嘅關心同埋支持，最後，我感激每一個愛我嘅人對我嘅付出同埋犧牲，（轉身向旁聽席躹躬）我祝福各位平安、健康。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就住控方對《國安法》入面「首要分子」同「罪行重大」嘅解讀，喺法律原則上，我冇咩補充，我相信法官、控方同埋一眾辯方律師喺法律原則上嘅議題處理得比我好好多。所以喺如何定義「首要分子」呢件事上，我冇咩想補充。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;正如我喺較早之前6月24日嘅陳詞，我認為喺本案裡面，我係一個「積極參與者」。不過控方指出「罪行重大」嘅係要考慮被告或者本案嘅一啲原則，就住嗰啲原則，我希望向法庭提供幾個觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第一點，法官閣下，本案「35+計劃」係一個喺陽光底下進行、眾所周知嘅計劃，我哋計劃裡面進行嘅手段同埋目的都係清晰、明確，而為人熟知嘅。我希望3位法官考慮嘅係，要達致我哋本案最終進入立法會無差別否決財政預算案呢件事，單靠我哋47個被告係冇可能完成。要進入立法會成為議員，係需要廣大嘅香港市民向我哋授權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而廣大市民對於願唔願意授權畀我哋進入立法會呢件事上，我認為其中一個背景，係7月《港區國安法》實施之後，有超過61萬香港市民喺7月11、12號參與咗我哋「35+計劃」嘅初選。法官閣下，毫無疑問，大家對於係咪違反《港區國安法》，喺當其時，對我而言，唔係一個絕對唔違法嘅情況。換句話說，參與投票嘅61萬市民，亦都係冒住犯上法律嘅風險，去進行嗰個嘅投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我作為一個民意嘅代表，除咗我有責任去遵守法律嘅義務之外，我嘅首要責任，係為選民去爭取佢哋嘅合理訴求。作為一個代議士，我哋有責任去保護支持我哋嘅香港市民，喺咁嘅情況下，希望法官喺考慮本案嘅罪行性質嘅時候，考慮各位被告佢哋之所以犯下本案嘅原因，並唔係出於個人嘅利益同埋私利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;合情合理的訴求&quot;&gt;合情合理的訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我想邀請法庭考慮第二點嘅係，法官閣下，我同意本案造成嘅後果可以引致一個憲政嘅危機，但係我唔同意呢個係一個憲政嘅災難。喺《基本法》下，第50、51、52條，本身其實已經有預計過發生相關嘅情況嘅時候，法律授權我哋嘅特區政府點樣去處理呢件事。當然，嚴重干預政府施政嘅效率係無可避免，但係喺《港區國安法》第22條裡面，我認為，各位被告充其量都係干犯咗第三條。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，「五大訴求」係一個合情、合理、無被法庭裁定違法嘅訴求，但係我想指出嘅係，五大訴求對於特區政府係「是不為也」，而非「不能為也」，至少「五大訴求」嘅第一項，撤回逃犯條訂條例，早在我哋7月之前已經係滿足咗。喺呢個情況下，我邀請法庭考慮嘅係，我哋唔係追求緊一個虛無飄渺、海市蜃樓嘅願望，香港市民就住五大訴求嘅每一個訴求⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官陳慶偉：今日是求情聆訊，不是讓你發表政見的場合⋯⋯如任何人想發表政治陳述，隨便，但不是在我的法庭內。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;和平理性非暴力的初選&quot;&gt;和平、理性、非暴力的初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;明白法官你嘅立場嘅（微笑）。至於第三點，就住我哋本案個性質係咪「罪行重大」，我希望法庭考慮嘅係，喺當其時嘅時空同背景⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官陳仲衡：若邀法庭考慮為「積極參加者」，無需就「罪行重大」陳詞。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;明白嘅法官（微笑），雖然我自己定位係積極參與者啫，但係假如三位法官唔同意嘅話，我都希望就住另外嗰兩個 category 作出一啲嘅回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過我第一部分嘅陳詞差唔多㗎喇（微笑）。正如我啱啱所講，我希望法官考慮當其時嘅背景，喺當其時，街頭嘅激烈衝突已經持續咗非常耐嘅時間，正如喺我嘅陳詞裡面所講，我唔希望有人受傷，唔希望有人被捕，更加唔希望再有人因為政治事件而犧牲佢哋嘅生命。所以，我選擇參與「35+」初選計劃，因為至少呢個手段雖然係違法，但呢個手段係和平、理性、非暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;無想過違法&quot;&gt;無想過違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：你在哪個階段意識到35+是違法？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我嘅認知係2021年1月6號我被拘捕嘅時候。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：你剛才說當時作為代議士，沒有選擇只能繼續，是否代表「35+計劃」進行時，已知道計劃可能違法？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我同意法官所講。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：即控罪期間已知計劃可能違法？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如果容讓我準確咁講，我對於參加「35+」初選有可能違法，係7月12號初選投票結束之後，我哋嘅政府官員，以及我唔記得係中聯辦定港澳辦喇 sorry，佢哋發出嘅聲明，大概係嗰啲嘅時段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：如指政府發聲明，時間是早於初選投票日。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，喺初選之前，我記得官員曾國衞先生有提出嘅，不過佢提出嘅係「可能」違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：他當然要這樣說，因為是否違法，是由法庭而非他來裁定，他最多只能講「可能」違法。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我作為一個市民嘅角度，我有理由相信政府係唔會任由罪案發生。容我舉一個例子，有一個人計劃揸車去打劫，佢有冇真係違法當然係由法庭去處理啦，而就算執法部門都只會通常回覆呢個行為可能係涉及違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但係如果呢件事係一個咁明確嘅違法罪行，我有理由相信政府嘅執法部門唔會容許成件事發生，發生完咗之後半年都冇進行任何嘅執法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：我只想知道你案發時的想法，警方何時拘捕是他們決定，不是我的關注。我的問題是，控罪期間，你是否知涉案協議可能違法？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，喺當其時，我對於喺財政預算案投否決，我並無得知，甚至認為有可能係違法。就住第一部分我嘅陳詞係咁多喇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（小休）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音&quot;&gt;暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，咁我就住個人背景開始陳詞。本人現齡28歲，現正喺監獄裡面修讀香港都會大學榮譽學士課程，未婚，係一個恨嫁嘅男人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（被告及旁聽席發笑）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我喺2021年2月28號被提控本案之前，無任何定罪記錄，喺2020至2021年期間，我透過選舉成為元朗區議會嘅議員，我喺2022年6月24日透過當時嘅代表律師，向法庭表達我嘅認罪意向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我承認串謀顛覆國家政權，我為我個人嘅過去一切嘅言行而負責。今日我想喺度向三位法官交代，我喺案發期間嘅想法同埋犯案嘅原因，希望三位法官可以給予我一定嘅耐性同埋包容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我喺1995年出世，自從1997年以來，香港涉及社會運動而被檢控嘅罪名、經審訊而裁定嘅刑罰，拾級而上，越發嚴苛，但係及後嘅社會運動，無論係參與嘅人數、時間、規模以及激烈嘅程度，仍然逐步擴大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我認為，每一場暴動都係人民無被聽見的聲音，如果我哋香港人民嘅合理訴求持續被漠視，矛盾同衝突必然會接腫而來。高壓統治、嚴刑峻法，充其量只能夠收一時之效，深層次嘅矛盾必需要尋求解決之道，社會先有可能復和、邁進、穩定、繁榮，否則難言長治久安，更加枉論由治及興。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;有義務繼承逝者信念&quot;&gt;有義務繼承逝者信念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我參與35+初選嘅原因，既有遠因，亦有近因。先講遠因，我個人嘅信念，相信政府係人民嘅僕人，而唔係統治者。我相信冇人願意被極權統治，我認為每一個人都希望生活喺一個可以追求夢想、免於恐懼嘅社會。作為一個香港人，我有一個理想，我認為大家應該擁有、亦都值得擁有自由、平等、包容嘅社會，有效維護人權、法治、公義嘅民主制度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，2019年係我參選嘅近因，當其時有三個因素促使我作出呢個決定。第一個係我對自由被侵蝕嘅恐懼；第二，係對政府傲慢嘅不滿；第三，亦都係最重要、最令我動容嘅原因，係我對離世生命嘅沉重悲痛，我完全唔希望有人受傷，無論佢哋嘅政治取態，我亦都唔希望有人被捕，更加難以忍受有人犧牲生命，但自己無動於衷、毫不作為。作為一個普通市民，我冇能力起死回生，我甚至冇辦法阻止佢哋付出自由同埋生命嘅代價，我冇完美嘅答案去解決如此巨大嘅問題，但係我有義務去繼承佢哋嘅信念。基於上述原因，我認為參與社會運動、地區嘅服務、投身政治，係我可以為呢個社會有所貢獻嘅行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，我喺2019年憑藉住4,371位選民對我嘅信任，而成為元朗區區議員；喺初選之中，憑藉住20,525位香港人，佢哋嘅支持而勝出初選。假若2020年9月6號立法會嘅選舉能夠如期順利舉辦，當日嘅結果，可能會係我人生之中最榮幸收到嘅生日禮物。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;成為一個代議士、一個香港民意嘅代表，我期許我自己嘅首要責任，係為民發聲、為民請命，我有責任去捍衛人民嘅權利，同埋佢哋嘅自由，努力爭取選民合情合理嘅訴求得以實現。即使機會係渺茫，即使我個人對於喺建制上尋求改革毫無信心，但我仍然會選擇承擔風險，尋求打破局面嘅機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：是什麼風險？你小休前說，當時不認為是違法。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;喺我被捕之前，我實在冇諗過會因為本案而入獄，但係並唔等於我認為成為一個代議士係唔會犯上任何嘅《國安法》，原因可能係因為我嘅政治言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：我不明白，你是說你當選後會做違法的事？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. 我嘅意思，係我認為即使我唔係成為一個立法會議員，但係喺《港區國安法》之下，我繼續參與政治活動或者社會運動，有好大嘅風險會觸犯相關嘅法律⋯⋯如果就本案「35+計劃」，成為一個立法會議員，喺議會無差別否決財政預算案，正如啱啱所重複，我冇諗過會因為呢件事而違法。但係另外一方面，我認為，我喺立法會議員以外嘅身分嘅行動，譬如，舉一個例⋯⋯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：不認為需舉例，只是就協議檢控，而非其他行為，你不用自證其罪。）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;不為信念道歉&quot;&gt;不為信念道歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;咁我繼續落去。法官閣下，距離我被捕之前，我冇任何一刻打算離開香港，我願意為我嘅行為負責，但係我唔會為我同選民所共享嘅信念同埋價值而道歉，我唔可以辜負人民嘅信任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：可理解為，你對做過的事沒有悔意？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（沉默片刻，神情凝重）正如我所講，我為我嘅所有言行而負責，我會承擔一切嘅代價。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官李運騰：那不是我的問題，我問的是，你是不是對你做過的事沒有悔意？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;（直視法官）無錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;作為一個政治人物，我期許我要有承擔，竭盡我所能，留守到最後一刻，所以我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;長夜終盡黎明將至&quot;&gt;長夜終盡，黎明將至&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官閣下，展望將來，我作為民意代表嘅任期已經完結，我打算放低政治人物嘅身分，但我仍然希望盡力留喺香港貢獻社會，即使我已經預視到困難係重重嘅，不過首先，一如時任嘅終審法官包致金先生所講：「There is no reason to leave if things are good, and if things are bad, there are more reason to stay.」我認為香港人同我只要抱持自救互助嘅精神、理性嘅思考，行公義、好憐憫，存謙卑的心，記錄過去嘅真相，活在真實嘅當下，為未來做好真誠嘅準備，香港嘅未來，將會重拾光明，而香港人嘅理想，一定會實現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後，法官閣下，二十世紀嘅完結，我哋向蘇聯同埋納粹作告別。失去足夠制衡嘅權力必然會自我膨脹，絕對嘅權力必定帶來絕對嘅腐敗。長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我感謝三位法官嘅包容同埋忍耐，本人謹此作結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;（法官陳慶偉：因為你遲認罪和沒有悔意，認罪扣減會遠少於其他被告，你有沒有話想說？）&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;冇嘅，法官，我完全明白嘅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（28日）續處理參選新西的吳敏兒、譚凱邦，和參選新東的柯耀林求情。代表前職工盟主席吳敏兒的資深大律師李志喜指，涉案串謀不涉武力，性質非顛覆罪最嚴重，而且參選人可被DQ，計劃不可能成功。她又指吳敏兒於初選落敗，屬「陪跑」，望法庭考慮她為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」。辯方又引述吳敏兒親撰的求情信，提及她2016年成為職工盟主席，參選僅望改善勞工法律，沒有意圖顛覆國家。她被捕始知涉違法，對此感到震驚，而職工盟已解散，她已與政治劃清界線，形容犯案是「人生最大的錯誤」，就此真誠致歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已完成求情的郭家麒、梁國雄及張可森今無到庭，其餘7人按男女分成上下兩排，由6名懲教人員隔坐。昨天綁馬尾的吳敏兒和黃子悅，今改為紮髻，黃亦改為穿有藍白色蕾絲領的黑色公主袖連衣裙。各被告向旁聽親友揮手、點頭，吳敏兒露齒微笑，黃子悅做心心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立法會議員劉慧卿、邵家臻，社民連曾健成等均有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方謀劃不涉武力法庭不應採納過高量刑起點&quot;&gt;辯方：謀劃不涉武力、法庭不應採納過高量刑起點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師李志喜為前職工盟主席吳敏兒求情。李表示，《國安法》第22條的刑期分級制僅針對顛覆的實質罪行，並不適用於本案的串謀控罪；但若法庭認為可作參考，辯方立場是本案的「非法手段」不涉武力或威脅使用武力，不應視為「罪行重大」，而法庭不應採納過高的量刑起點，否則便沒有空間處理其他更嚴重的罪行，例如造成人身傷亡、企圖綁架議員等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指謀劃不可能成功-官質疑是否求情理由&quot;&gt;辯方指謀劃不可能成功 官質疑是否求情理由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，本案的串謀特別，她從沒見過有串謀會徹底公開其計劃的內容，讓政府能採取措施將之扼殺於萌芽；而計劃的本質是選出最有機會勝出的參選人，在當時而言屬合法的政治活動。她續指，計劃的公開性已埋下「自我破壞的種子」、令其非常難以成功，參選人承諾否決，令選舉主任可取消其資格。她又指，選舉充滿變數，被告一旦當選可能陷入政治兩難，若預算案回應他們爭取十多年的訴求，他們未必會否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，初選有替補機制，有「Plan B」甚至「Plan C」，但李強調，要迫使特首下台，須經過解散立法會後重選，並否決同一份預算案兩次，涉案計劃在現實中不可能發生。陳慶偉笑說，視乎她問誰，如果是問戴耀廷，「他對計劃能成功頗為樂觀」；又以搶劫案為例，指判刑只考慮犯案手段和案情嚴重性，毋須考慮是否可能實現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰亦舉例，若有人想下毒謀殺他人，但出於化學知識的無知，其毒物不足以致命，「計劃的不可能，是否減輕意圖謀殺罪的嚴重性？」李志喜同意涉搶劫、危險藥物等罪要判處阻嚇性刑罰，法官李運騰反問，若阻嚇販毒等罪行重要，保護國家安全不也是同樣重要嗎？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指吳敏兒初選屬陪跑與政治劃清界線&quot;&gt;辯方指吳敏兒初選屬「陪跑」、與政治劃清界線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李志喜又指，《國安法》於6月30日才生效，計劃的公開、以及社會上有人說初選不違法，令被告認為並無違法。李又指吳敏兒沒有案底，反問「人們會否明知犯法仍繼續？」李運騰笑說：「對某些被告來說，可能」。李志喜指法庭是就個別被告情況判刑，李運騰回應不認為需談到那麼遠，因吳敏兒在最早階段已認罪，並非最激進的參選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李志喜同意，指吳於初選落敗，是新界西其中一個最不成功的候選人，在選舉論壇上也因反應太慢，沒有太多發言機會，同意法官李運騰形容為「陪跑（also-ran）」。李又指，初選落敗後，吳繼續工會工作，協助工人渡過疫情，與政治劃清界線，而職工盟亦已解散，她不會重犯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳敏兒稱干犯本案是人生最錯決定&quot;&gt;吳敏兒稱干犯本案是「人生最錯決定」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李志喜續讀出吳敏兒的求情信，吳提到自身經歷，她擔任空中服務員，並成立英航香港機艙服務員工會，關注職業安全和爭取權益，並於2016年當選職工盟主席，夢想有更好的勞工法律保障工人權益。李志喜指，吳或不如其他前立法會議員般直接服務社會，但她的人生也投入服務公眾，任職空中服務員對保障乘客安全很重要。低頭看文件的吳一度拿紙巾拭眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續引述吳指，她參選立法會的願景很簡單，只是希望推動社會進步，令工人能分享經濟成果，她從沒有意圖以任何方式顛覆國家。吳敏兒又指，被捕後才意識到干犯了《國安法》，對此感到震驚，強調自己不會明知而犯法。她承認所犯罪行非常嚴重，對犯案真誠致歉（genuinely sorry），「干犯本案肯定是我人生最大的錯誤」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望考慮為其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方望考慮為「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李重申，吳並非從一開始就刻意犯法，她深感後悔。惟法官陳慶偉指，能接納吳不大可能重犯、並非首要份子、本案不涉武力手段，但不認為能接納辯方稱吳無意違法。李志喜同意吳認罪，意味她承認有意圖犯案，但認為吳當時不知道違法，可構成減刑理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李終指，吳敏兒參與較輕，在初選落敗，望法庭考慮她為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」，並望法庭考慮吳敏兒家庭和個人健康狀況減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（28日）續處理參選新西的吳敏兒、譚凱邦，和參選新東的柯耀林求情。譚凱邦一方認為譚屬「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度，指前天文台台長林超英為譚撰求情信，肯定他對環保的付出；而譚決心不再重返政治，包括不再提倡環保議題。辯方又指，譚還柙期間受感染，手腳皮膚潰爛，望法庭能基於人道原因酌情減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林一方同倡柯為「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度，指柯溫和保守，參與程度較其他被告為低。不過法官質疑，他曾簽署「墨落無悔」、出席選舉論壇、派發選舉單張、聘請選舉經理，難言參與較他人少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第五批被告今完成求情，下周一（9月1日）將處理最後一批被告求情，為餘下9名新界東初選參與者：何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆及林景楠，料需時3天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;林超英撰求情信-肯定譚凱邦對環保議題付出&quot;&gt;林超英撰求情信 肯定譚凱邦對環保議題付出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表譚凱邦的大律師馬維騉指，譚熱衷環保議題，他獲前天文台台長林超英撰求情信，指認識譚多年，肯定他對環保議題的付出。譚亦獲妻子、中大退休教授、環保團體、區議會同事、馬灣居民等撰求情信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬指，譚一直視環保議題為首要議程，他參與初選目的並非顛覆政府，而是望進入議會，為環保發聲。馬又指，譚在初選屬「陪跑」，於新西初選得票最低，票數比排尾二的吳敏兒還要少一半，未能出線。翻查資料，吳敏兒獲10,860票，譚凱邦獲4,865票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指譚決心不會重返政治&quot;&gt;辯方指譚決心不會重返政治&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，辯方是說獲得最少票數的參選人，刑期應最輕？馬指不是，但指譚知名度低，即使初選採用替補機制也對他無影響。馬續指，望法庭考慮譚並非初選組織者或主要推手，參與程度低，屬「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度，加上他認罪獲三分一扣減，相信他很快會獲釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續指，譚曾任兩屆馬灣區議員，具良好品格，而譚在還柙期間修讀建築管理課程，顯示他決心不會重返政治，因他意識到如再向政府提倡環保議題，必然牽涉一定程度的政治。譚凱邦聞言點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指譚手腳皮膚潰爛-冀酌情減刑&quot;&gt;辯方指譚手腳皮膚潰爛 冀酌情減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬又指，譚還柙期間舌底曾出現腫囊，亦有皮膚問題，還柙期間受感染，望法庭考慮其健康問題增加他服刑苦楚，而額外減刑。法官陳慶偉閱讀譚2021年的醫療報告，指譚的病情不夠嚴重，馬指有今年4月的醫療記錄，但陳指那並非醫療報告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬續指，探望譚凱邦時，看到其手腳皮膚潰爛，情況「非常差（very bad）」，譚一度在被告欄內攤開雙手手掌展示，又提起右腳。陳慶偉說：「我們不是醫生，我們只看醫療報告」。馬表示可索取進一步醫療報告，並認為法庭可運用酌情權，基於人道理由作減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯耀林參與程度較他人低-官質疑&quot;&gt;辯方指柯耀林參與程度較他人低 官質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表柯耀林的大律師葉海琅指，柯在串謀的參與非常有限，其初選得票率低，不足1%，認為柯屬「其他參加者」或「積極參加者」較低程度。他又指，相較其他光譜的參選人，有出席記招、定期擺街站、發起「墨落無悔」，柯只是站在一邊，認為要做一些事來取得參選入場券。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉質疑，柯曾簽署「墨落無悔」、出席選舉論壇、派發選舉單張。葉回應，重點是柯的參與程度有多重。陳慶偉即說：「他當然有大力為選舉宣傳（heavily campaigned for the election）！他聘用了選舉經理⋯⋯你怎能說他的參與比其他人少？」法官李運騰亦指，柯或不是最激進的候選人，但不等於他罪責最輕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯溫和保守參與公共服務多年&quot;&gt;辯方指柯溫和保守、參與公共服務多年&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;葉續指，柯耀林專注民生議題，而非推翻政府，他具良好品格，參與公共服務多年，自2003年起三度當選區議員，2008年亦獲政府表揚就公共服務的貢獻。辯方強調，柯是非常溫和保守的政治人物，涉案屬「不幸」，他獲不同政治光譜的區議員撰寫求情信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又引柯的關姓友人求情信，二人相識逾20年，關指柯因想協助更多人而辭職參選區議員，並在他於內地中風時，立即協助安排他到港接受治療。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，各被告紛紛向旁聽席揮手，黃子悅單手放在面頰上做心形手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years have now passed since the humiliating retreat from Afghanistan. The UK has been fortunate that the US has borne the brunt of the opprobrium but, in truth, the Whitehall failure was equally shocking. In classic British tradition, the disaster is being rewritten as a Dunkirk-style “backs to the wall” triumph, with claims that the Taliban victory could not have been predicted. In fact, it was both predictable and predicted. There is little danger of lessons being learnt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 14 August 2024 the Taliban staged an impressive military parade at the former US air base at Bagram showing off the vast range of Western equipment that was left behind, including Black Hawk helicopters, MRAP mine-resistant vehicles, and Humvees. Far more serious are the thousands of semi-automatic weapons, millions of rounds of ammunition, artillery shells and (particularly) night-vision goggles that are now available to the many terrorist groups based in Afghanistan, some of which intend to destabilise neighbouring countries and further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) there is a sense of anticipation that David Lammy, the new foreign secretary, intends to make Afghan relations one of his flagship policies. Position papers are being prepared for meetings in early September.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lammy visited Afghanistan in June 2022 and alleged that “the UK government’s woeful lack of leadership that was so visible last year is continuing as it ignores the humanitarian catastrophe. Ministers must urgently set out a comprehensive strategy for engaging with Afghanistan…” In reality, there is no need for political contact to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, most of which is delivered by the UN and international NGOs. In 2022 the FCDO provided £286 million in aid to Afghanistan and co-hosted an international conference which raised a further $2.5 billion. The British HALO Trust continues to undertake its vital work of removing Improvised Explosive Devices, which killed dozens of civilians – mainly children – last year. Such aid must continue, even increase, because the Afghan people did not want or deserve a Taliban government foisted on them by a craven US negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official-level contact with the Taliban continues, with Robert Dixon – the British charge d’affaires – visiting Kabul regularly from Qatar. In a meeting with a senior Taliban official only two weeks ago, he was quoted as highlighting “London’s commitment to collaborating with [the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan] to enhance global relationships”. If correctly reported, this sounds like the first indication of a new policy in the offing. This may be the first real test of Lammy’s progressive realism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the absence of serious opposition to the Taliban and with no appetite to restart the cycle of armed insurgency, most countries have decided that quiet engagement is the answer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why should the UK engage with the Taliban? There are three reasons: to improve its understanding of the terrorist threat; to stop the harassment (and occasional killing) of those Afghans who served with British forces (such as the Triples); and to address the problem of migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should pause here to consider the Taliban of 2024. The much-trumpeted Taliban 2.0 was always a work of fiction, a press line cobbled together in Pakistan and swallowed whole by Western officials. The British Defence Chief at the time described the new Taliban as “country boys” who needed to be given space to show they were reasonable. However, the Taliban won the war against NATO, brought peace to the country and will likely be in power for a decade or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present there are two main wings of the Taliban. The most influential group is based in Kandahar under the Supreme Leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada. These Kandaharis espouse a fundamentalist interpretation of their role. “We were created to worship Allah and not to earn money or gain worldly honour” was Akhundzada’s recent riposte to the Taliban government in Kabul, which wants international recognition and economic progress to reduce unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it would be a mistake to see the Taliban government in Kabul as moderate in any conventional sense – although the Pakistanis refer to them as the “saner Taliban”. Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani is a terrorist of long standing. Only two months after the victory in August 2021, he celebrated suicide bombers and their families at an event in the Intercontinental Hotel. Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub, meanwhile, is the son of the former Taliban Emir (or Amir) who gave Osama bin Laden sanctuary in Afghanistan before 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai spoke out in favour of female education in December 2023, and his comments were but one indication of policy tensions within the Taliban. But, as in Iran, it is the word of the Amir (or Supreme Leader) that prevails. Taliban enthusiasm for outreach to the West is largely tactical, to alleviate the financial and economic chaos into which they have plunged their country. In particular, they are seeking the unfreezing of Afghan state assets held overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could the Kabulis overthrow the Kandaharis? In theory, yes – the blood-soaked Haqqanis alone have the capability. In practice, though, this is implausible. Akhundzada is the “Amir ul-Momineen” or Commander of the Faithful and is imbued with full religious authority. It would be a terrible crime from which the perpetrators would never recover. The best that the Kabulis can do is use the power of argument to secure small adjustments in policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Lammy and his FCDO officials should have no illusions about who they are dealing with. There is no chance that the Taliban will accord women their rightful place in society. At best, Whitehall can hope for small incremental steps on women, human rights and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although no country has yet recognised the Taliban as the official government of Afghanistan, there is a great deal of guile behind the scenes. Pakistan, Iran, Russia and China were all represented at the Bagram parade. A further 20 diplomatic missions in Kabul are now staffed, including those of Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and the five Central Asian Republics (CARs). In the absence of serious opposition to the Taliban and with no appetite to restart the cycle of armed insurgency, most countries have decided that quiet engagement is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, no-one is finding engagement easy. Pakistan, in spite of its decades of ill-considered support for the Afghan Taliban, has failed to obtain any cooperation against the TTP (often known as the Pakistan Taliban), which mounts terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. China has offered to include Afghanistan in its massive but ailing Belt and Road Initiative, but has not found sympathy for its request to hand over Uyghur militants. Even Qatar, which hosted a Taliban diplomatic mission when the group was fighting NATO forces, is finding that the Taliban prefer to deal with the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, London would demand full women’s rights and counterterrorist cooperation in return for installing Dixon in the UK’s embassy in Kabul. However, maximalist demands have no chance of being accepted. This is what happens when you lose a war. As a regional Islamist told the author: “Losers can’t be choosers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The central question is whether engagement can extract sufficient benefits to be worth the risk of being credibly accused of selling out on fundamental women’s rights&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what realistic measures could the UK require from Afghanistan before reopening its embassy in Kabul? There are four principal areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women:&lt;/strong&gt; A recent survey by the UN found that 64% of Afghan women felt unsafe leaving their homes (compared to 2% of men). Women’s safety is one area where the UK could push for change, as a first step towards other gradual improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terrorism:&lt;/strong&gt; There is clear evidence that the Taliban are fighting Islamic State Khorasan Province, and this is an area where the UK could benefit from cooperation. However, the Taliban are also playing host to a vast array of other terrorist groups and individuals – including Al-Qa’ida and the TTP as well as Balochis, Uyghurs, Uzbeks and Chechens – who will remain unmolested.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Triples:&lt;/strong&gt; There is still evidence that the Taliban are hunting down members of the British-trained and sponsored Special Forces units, 333 and 444. Any move towards engagement should require a full and monitored amnesty for the Triples, including assisted transfer to the UK if requested. This could lead to further cooperation on migration to the UK, preventing Afghans from having to resort to a perilous 4,000-mile journey followed by a Channel crossing at the mercy of predatory smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heroin:&lt;/strong&gt; 90% of heroin on UK streets comes from Afghanistan. The continuing Taliban prohibition on cultivation should be welcomed, although there is now Fentanyl to plug any gap in supply. The UK could work with the Taliban to explore alternative livelihoods for newly impoverished opium farmers, using the extensive work conducted in London during the 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this can be done in isolation. Afghanistan would provide an ideal subject for Lammy to collaborate with other countries, not just the G7 and the EU but India, Turkey, the Gulf states, the CARs and even China. There is a great deal of global unanimity on what is required from Afghanistan. The key is to leverage change but to demand conditionality at every stage. This is something that both Trump and Biden failed to do after the Doha Accords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central question is whether engagement can extract sufficient benefits to be worth the risk of being credibly accused of selling out on fundamental women’s rights. However, there is no point in pretending the Taliban do not exist. So, Lammy should proceed, but with extreme caution. If he gives too much in return for too little, he will become the latest of many generations of UK politicians to underestimate the political dangers of Afghanistan. The probability is that any hopes of genuine change will ultimately perish on the rocks of the Amir’s theocratic obduracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The readiness of the UK’s fleet of nuclear attack submarines (SSNs) has been a source of enduring concern over the previous half decade. With five Astute-class SSNs currently in service (less than half of what the UK had at the end of the Cold War), the Royal Navy fields fewer submarines than has been the case at any given time in recent history. Moreover, challenges with respect to maintenance, compounded by the priority accorded to ensuring that the UK’s continuous at sea deterrent remains operational, have resulted in periods during which the UK did not have an attack submarine at sea. In light of the growing threat posed by Russia’s Northern Fleet, ensuring the readiness of a capability which remains a key UK offer to NATO as an alliance member will be critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-balance-of-forces&quot;&gt;The Balance of Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition to maintain a commanding position in the undersea operating environment played a crucial role in the Cold War. During the early years of the Cold War, tracking Soviet SSNs as they attempted to break through the Greenland–Iceland–UK gap was vital to Allied efforts to ensure that US reinforcements could cross the Atlantic. In the 1980s, NATO’s approach shifted. In the context of a forward maritime strategy, the ability of NATO to menace Soviet ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) in their bastions was a key component of deterrence against the USSR, which was presumed to enjoy considerable advantages in Central Europe. The success of this approach was perhaps best illustrated by the fact that by the end of the Cold War, the commander of the Soviet Northern Fleet was compelled to request a trebling of his budget if the maritime component of Russia’s nuclear triad was to be adequately protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a rough symmetry in how Allied and Russian forces have evolved, with both sides undergoing quantitative reductions but qualitative improvements. The Russian Northern Fleet fields 13 active SSNs and guided missile submarines (SSGNs), a far cry from its heyday, but vessels such as the Yasen and improved Akula II and III are considerably quieter than their predecessors. Allied submarine fleets including the Royal Navy’s submarine flotilla have endured a comparable drop in capacity, with the Royal Navy fielding fewer than half as many submarines as it did in 1990, although the Astute is also considerably quieter and more capable than the Trafalgar class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major shift, however, is that the US SSN fleet will increasingly be focused on demands in the Indo-Pacific, where robust Chinese anti-access/area denial capabilities will put surface vessels at ever greater risk, but where US submarines still enjoy considerable advantages over the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s noisy SSNs and immature anti-submarine warfare assets. As the size of the US submarine fleet (which is already well short of the 66 boats the US navy requires to meet its commitments) shrinks during the late 2020s and reaches a low of 46 boats by 2030, it is not unlikely that the Pacific, where 60% of US submarines are typically deployed, will receive an ever larger portion of a temporarily smaller SSN fleet. Past 2026, the US navy expects to increase its build rate to three attack submarines per year, which should see it return to and then exceed its current strength by 2035, although the real effects of this regeneration of capability (if achieved) will be somewhat attenuated by the fact that the Chinese threat will not stand still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, this raises the possibility of short-term capability gaps emerging. In this context, the readiness of the Royal Navy’s submarines – which are, among other things, the only non-US Allied nuclear submarines that regularly perform under-ice operations – is both a national and an Alliance-level concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;With five Astute-class SSNs currently in service, the Royal Navy fields fewer submarines than has been the case at any given time in recent history&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be a mistake to assume that the Russian submarine fleet is ten feet tall. Of the 13 SSNs and SSGNs currently fielded by Russia’s Northern Fleet, only a handful can be described as truly modern. While the Russian Yasen and Yasen-M are competitive against Western submarines, four of the Northern Fleet’s SSNs are aged Sierra II and Victor III-class boats, and the fleet also fields two older (though still credible) Oscar-class SSGNs. The fleet’s Project 971M/I Akula-class submarines are slowly returning to readiness after a trough in capability during the last decade, with SSNs such as the K-328 Leopard and K-154 Tigr completing refits in the early 2020s. Even so, the number of project-improved Akulas at the fleet’s disposal in the next several years should hover around six, meaning that the fleet currently fields eight SSNs/SSGNs (six Akulas and two Yasen/Yasen-M) that are credible in a modern context. Although Russian practice has historically prioritised surge capacity over presence at sea (which is why the Soviet Navy only deployed 25% of its SSNs at any given time during the Cold War as opposed to the 66% which the US navy maintained), a very high readiness rate of 80% would imply six or so modern SSNs being available in Russia’s Northern Fleet in a crisis (though submarines could be moved to the north from the Pacific Fleet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will field more Yasen-class SSGNs by the end of this decade. While the lead boat of the class, the Severodvinsk, took 15 years to build, its successor the Kazan was constructed in eight years and accepted into service after 12, while the third and fourth submarines in the class (both allocated to the Pacific fleet) reached full operational capability in eight and nine years respectively. Two more boats were ordered in the first tranche of Yasen-class submarines to be built, and will likely enter service in 2024–25. In this period, the Northern Fleet’s complement of Yasen-class boats will increase from two to three (with three Yasen-class boats in the Northern and Pacific Fleets respectively). The Russian navy has commissioned a further six boats in the class which will likely enter service in the 2030s, assuming a comparable build rate. At present, there is some indication that the Yasen fleet appears to have been committed to the maintenance of a near year-round presence off the coast of the continental US – something which will likely require all four of the boats currently in service to maintain, and which will leave the fleet with limited surge capacity. One reason for this might be that the Russians are replicating the Soviet policy of delivering an “analogous response” to US missile deployments in Europe (which will occur from 2026 onwards) through the deployment of missile-equipped submarines to the Western Hemisphere. If this is the case, the ability of the Yasen fleet to surge multiple SSNs into the Atlantic will be limited until the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the 2030s, then, will represent a point of particular concern as a nadir in US capability coincides with the growth of the Yasen SSGN fleet as a consequence of investments being made now. Past the mid-2030s, both a recovery in US numbers and progress on SSN (R)/SSN AUKUS will (in the absence of delays) result in the rectification of this imbalance. While the situation in the Atlantic is not presently critical, it is vital that steps are taken to ensure that a window of vulnerability does not open in the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-more-out-of-astute&quot;&gt;Getting More Out of Astute&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be assumed that some of the issues plaguing the Royal Navy’s submarine readiness right now can be resolved at the speed of relevance if the threat is likely to become most acute at the end of the decade. To use one example, the lack of available docks at Devonport (which has forced a prioritisation of SSBN maintenance) should be resolved in the coming years, as 10 Dock at Devonport becomes available and 15 Dock is converted to service the Astute class. Furthermore, the floating docks being procured under the Additional Fleet Time Docking Capability (AFTDC) programme should help with the issue of readiness, although this programme is nascent and no date has been set yet for the tender. Finally, the Astute fleet will grow by two SSNs during the next few years. While still considerably smaller than the Russian Northern Fleet in numerical terms, the Royal Navy can, in conjunction with other European SSN operators such as the Marine Nationale, offset the effects of a relative reduction in US capacity and match a notional Russian force of 10–11 modern attack submarines which may be operated by the Northern Fleet in the early 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by no means a certainty, however, and the fate of programmes such as the AFTDC remains to be seen. Moreover, infrastructure investments will not entirely resolve some of the challenges highlighted by Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff Lieutenant General Rob Magowan, which include supply chain management and the availability of engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the question of availability will only be exacerbated by the rotational deployment of an Astute-class submarine to Perth beginning in 2027. To be sure, AUKUS is not necessarily a drag on capacity – investments in the UK’s submarine industrial base by Australia may be an important part of the solution to certain issues such as supply chain management. However, the timing of the rotational deployment bears considering, since this could coincide with the point at which the Russian submarine threat peaks. There may be competitive advantages to be gained in Europe from the deployment of submarines to the Pacific. To the extent that Russia (incorrectly) assesses AUKUS to be a full-fledged military alliance, it is likely to view any steps to delivering on it as a threat to the Russian Far East where, notably, half of the incoming batch of Yasen-class SSGNs will be based. As such, the strategic ambiguity of a rotational presence could play a role in fixing Russian assets away from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These opportunities notwithstanding, a more salient question for the Royal Navy may be the timing and form that its rotational commitment to Submarine Rotational Force West takes. One approach to how the rotational deployment might be conducted by partner states could conform to the logic of dynamic force employment articulated by former Secretary of Defence James Mattis, in which forces were expected to make short, irregular deployments geared towards an emphasis on readiness and operational uncertainty. If the deployment schedule of British and US SSNs was made shorter and larger in scale (with multiple SSNs on any deployment but for a shorter period), this could impose a degree of operational uncertainty on Russia while maintaining a regular drumbeat of visits to Australia for functions such as training and political signalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if a likely multi-year rotational forward presence is deemed politically vital to the success of AUKUS, the UK would do well to deliver its part of the commitment before 2030, which is when the threat in Europe will peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The period from 2025–35 will likely be one of maximal concern as the demand from the Indo-Pacific and a qualitative increase in the Russian threat converge&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to thinking about how longer-term commitments are managed and sequenced, the tasking of the Astute fleet could become more focused. For example, the role of SSNs as Tomahawk land attack missile (TLAM) launchers in support of expeditionary activity might reasonably be sacrificed given that this entails the use of a highly specialised platform for functions that can eventually be played by surface vessels, and draws on capacity in support of relatively peripheral missions. Until the Type 26 enters service, readiness for the contingent employment of limited stocks of TLAM outside Europe might be treated as a task to be effectively gapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, a greater emphasis might be placed on committing more resources to key activities such as ASW and exercises such as Ice Exercise, in which the Royal Navy and US Navy practice under-ice SSN operations (something no European partner other than the UK provide the US), even if this comes at the expense of other standing commitments (beyond nondiscretionary missions like protecting the deterrent). A more narrowly focused pattern of activity could help optimise a limited fleet for its core functions, which during the latter part of this decade and the first part of the next could in turn set the conditions for a more balanced pattern of activity towards the middle of the next decade and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the relative balance between the submarines of the Russian Northern Fleet and Allied capabilities can be influenced in certain ways. As mentioned, the rotational deployment of Yasen-class submarines in what appears to be an analogous response posture will rob Russia of surge capacity. Similar long-distance deployments as part of an analogous response approach might be incentivised by forward operations in the Barents Sea (which former commander of the Russian Navy Admiral Yevmenov discussed with some concern in the journal Morskoi Sbornik), or through live exercises simulating the firing of submarine-launched cruise missiles from forward positions (something which is viewed as a matter of concern since British missiles are viewed as a component of a much larger US prompt strike capability). These represent notional examples rather than concrete solutions, but the broader point is that the pattern of activity the submarine service should aim for is one in which short bursts of Allied activity stimulate much longer Russian deployments. While the number of hulls in the Russian Northern Fleet cannot be impacted, the number available to Russia at any time can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there are no simple fixes to the challenges that shortfalls in SSN numbers will pose. These shortfalls will not be acute until later in this decade, by which time the UK should have overcome some of its own short-term challenges. The period from 2025–35 will likely be one of maximal concern as the demand from the Indo-Pacific and a qualitative increase in the Russian threat converge. In this window, it will likely be vital to narrow the number of tasks performed by the Astute fleet as much as possible. Beyond this point, there will be greater room for the fleet to support longer-term goals, including those entailed under AUKUS.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;3男6女陪審團今早開始退庭商議&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GIGMWFr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員與另一勇武小隊涉計劃遊行期間放炸彈及開槍殺警。律政司首度以《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》起訴。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（27日）踏入第81日審訊。法官張慧玲已完成引導陪審團，3男6女陪審團今早約11時起退庭商議。張官指，陪審團需達至9比0或8比1或7比2的裁決；若達至6比3或5比4，並非法例上可接受的大比數，屆時她會作進一步指引。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官有人在串謀之後退出亦非答辯理由&quot;&gt;官：有人在串謀之後退出，亦非答辯理由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲第七日引導陪審團。她提及本案控罪的罪行元素。就「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪，「訂明標的」是指公用場所，即開放予公眾人士的地方，而本案目標地點為灣仔軒尼詩道，符合公用場所的定義。她又指，本案控罪屬串謀，控方需要證明兩人或以上達成非法協議，意圖用爆炸性裝置導致他人死亡或遭受身體嚴重傷害。至於串謀者可以用身體語言、手勢、姿勢或行動達成協議，不一定要用書面形式。當協議達成後，串謀就已經完成；若串謀者仍然維持至少兩人，串謀就繼續存在。如有人在串謀之後退出，亦非答辯理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官控方需證明有意圖加入協議並打算付諸實行&quot;&gt;官：控方需證明有意圖加入協議、並打算付諸實行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官表示，控方需要證明被告有意圖與控罪所指的串謀者加入協議，並打算由被告本人或其他串謀者付諸實行，但毋須最終有實行。張官重申，以下3個情況並不屬串謀一份子，包括：對協議不知情、知情但無意加入、假裝加入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官提到，吳智鴻為串謀的策劃者（Mastermind），他有最大的知情度。而根據控方立場，「屠龍」等成員則較遲加入，但張官表示毋須證明各被告在同一時間知道串謀，亦毋須證明各被告均曾接觸過所有串謀者，因此「屠龍」成員可以不認識吳智鴻一方的人，亦可以沒有互相聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於屬交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸」罪，張官指如果「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪不成立，陪審團就要考慮此罪是否成立。此罪主要涉及非法及惡意地，串謀藉爆炸品導致爆炸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「串謀謀殺」罪，張官指需要證明串謀者有意圖殺害他人，只是令對象身體受嚴重傷害並不足夠。就李家田被控的「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪，張官認為陪審團需考慮李的招認口供，即提及自己曾經管有手槍，是否在警方威逼利誘之下作出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官控方立場指投擲汽油彈亦屬恐怖主義行為&quot;&gt;官：控方立場指投擲汽油彈亦屬恐怖主義行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後就劉佩凝被控的「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，張官指需要證明被告提供或籌集財產是作恐怖主義行為，但毋須證明財產是否實際上被如此使用。而控方立場是投擲汽油彈亦屬恐怖主義行為。控方另指，劉負責在用作眾籌的「育龍」頻道上，發布「屠龍」的示威精華片段，她亦知道部分款項會給予負責用汽油彈的「魔法仔女」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官需達9比0或8比1或7比2裁決&quot;&gt;官：需達9比0或8比1或7比2裁決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官最後提醒，控方需要證明被告有罪，而被告則毋須證明自己無犯罪。她又指，陪審團需要達至9比0或8比1或7比2的裁決；若達至6比3或5比4，並非法例上可接受的大比數，屆時張官會作進一步指引。張官另指，若陪審團在退庭商議期間有疑問，可以書面形式交給她，她會與律師商討後回答問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陪審團退庭商議8小時後，仍未有結果，明早9時繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】民主派初選47人案今早繼續進行求情，包括新界西、新界東共8名被告。多年戰友「女長毛」雷玉蓮昨晚才知悉，便急忙請假前來西九龍裁判法院：「唔好令佢覺得孤單，等佢知我哋到咗。」蓮姐表示，長毛即使身陷囹圄，仍多次喚她要多探望戰友古思堯：「長毛撐得住！佢喺獄中都尚且記掛戰友。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;憶昔日行動-念長毛總為戰友行先&quot;&gt;憶昔日行動 念長毛總為戰友行先&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了一共參選新西的被告，根據司法網頁顯示，參與新東初選的梁國雄、柯耀林亦由今日起一併作求情。雷玉蓮今早便請假到法院支持戰友，她早前曾探望長毛，形容對方「撐得住」，並引用蘇東坡的詩句送予長毛：「稽首天中天，毫光放大千，八風吹不動，端坐紫金蓮，佢就係一個咁樣嘅人，無嘢打動得到佢。」她身穿印有蓮花的外衣，寓意47人出於污泥而不染：「所以我要著呢件衫支持佢哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蓮姐對記者談到一件事，多年前與長毛到位於中環下亞厘畢道的舊政府總部抗議，那年頭衝擊鐵馬「正常不過」：「嗰陣時吳恭劭都仲喺度⋯⋯嗰次好多警察，好危險，我哋最後無衝，我哋同警察鬥企。長毛將示威物品掛咗喺度就算，佢想確保所有人都安心。長毛好多時都諗咗人哋先，先諗自己。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;盼47人大步檻過-嘆舊日較少合照&quot;&gt;盼47人大步檻過 嘆舊日較少合照&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;談到47人案的求情即將進入尾聲，蓮姐最希望他們能大步檻過：「最緊要佢哋出到嚟，咩是是非非都唔重要。有啲人求情講甚麼東西，其他人講甚麼東西，每個人處境都唔同，我一個人食得幾多？但當你有家庭、有顧慮嘅時候，你諗嘅嘢都會多咗，你唔會自己都要為佢哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，蓮姐有點感慨地說，過往較少與梁國雄、古思堯合照，才發現「影相係咁重要」：「當長毛同阿古入咗去嘅時候，我睇返我哋好少合照，好似一張合照，因為以前成日見到，但世事無常。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了多年戰友，亦有社民連義工特地來支持長毛。盧先生今早乘坐頭班車，排隊等候進入法院，前來支持長毛。他表示自2012年接觸長毛，留意到社民連的理念與自己接近，便一直為社民連助選：「左翼、幫弱勢，又係為公義發聲，所以開始幫佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;談到與長毛相處最深刻的一件事，盧先生稱「好平常㗎咋喎」：「有一次喺中聯辦門口，警察噴胡椒噴霧，有個義工嘅，後生嘅，長毛一手攬佢埋嚟，用件褸遮住個頭。個義工無事，佢自己兜口兜面食影晒。」他形容長毛其實溫柔，並很照顧他人，而且亦講道理：「唔係出邊話佢市井，其實佢好博學，睇好多書。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;行政會議召集人葉劉淑儀早前接受外媒訪問，稱香港民主20年來的實驗失敗，相信在《基本法》第23條立法後，反對派將長時間不會重臨，更點名「長毛」和「癲狗」黃毓民之流不會再回來立法會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;知悉長毛獄中有情緒病-盼保重撐住&quot;&gt;知悉長毛獄中有情緒病 盼保重撐住&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧先生笑言政治一日都嫌長：「佢無錯嘅，可以將來見到嘅形勢都係咁，唔知㗎呢啲。黎智英都可能會出返嚟，佢講得太早。我哋梗係希望，你應承我哋嘅雙普選，2008年就應該有，你應該兌現，做到真正港人治港。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，盧先生表示知悉長毛在獄中有情緒病，而且頭部生瘡，「佢上庭成日𢲷個頭」：「保重、撐住，平安呀！嗯，入邊嘅人都係講呢啲。但我哋講啲咩說話對佢無作用，係要靠佢自己意志。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;柯耀林亦被安排在今日起作求情，去年曾任柯耀林mentee的阿偲，指與柯交流時，感覺他不太開心，嘆很多朋友已不在港，而柯初罪成還柙後仍「有講有笑」、鼓勵她，不過近來情況變差，「多咗亂諗嘢」。阿偲指，到場旁聽望給予柯耀林支持：「畀佢覺得，無論咩時候都有人陪住佢、撐住佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;我諗好多人都經歷緊呢樣嘢&quot;&gt;「我諗好多人都經歷緊呢樣嘢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;與上次凌晨時分專注電腦中足球賽事轉播、偶爾傳出歡呼聲相比，這次李予信自到場後便戴上耳機，神色凝重、沉默不語。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信分享最近的消遣讀物，指自己正在閱讀心理學相關、關於韌性培養的書籍，認為社會需要這樣的質素，學習如何正面處理逆境和創傷的感受，「我諗好多人都經歷緊呢樣嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦形容旁聽原因就像看這些書一樣，「我覺得係一個好重要嘅經歷嚟，好需要去正視我哋眼前現實發生嘅情況，同時間都要好好去回應過往嘅經歷，咁樣我哋先至有更加強韌嘅心態繼續喺未來走落去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】民主派初選47人案今早繼續作求情，被告之一伍健偉預料將親自求情。前元朗區議員林進今早繼續排隊，希望進入庭內旁聽。談到伍健偉的情況，林進對《獨媒》表示，對方還柙初時的狀態不太好，過去半年則「成功肥到」，心態上已有所調節，現已坦然面對困境：「佢話咪10年囉。我自己評估都係，要發生都發生咗，怨天尤人都改變唔到啲咩。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在去年10月，伍健偉選擇在案件開審前認罪，並表明會親自求情，他當時表示「希望我自己嘅人生由我自己掌握」。林進亦強調，伍健偉對於案件的裁決、刑期已有準備，沒有任何樂觀的猜想：「反而諗得差啲，個差啲都接受到嘅時候，就無乜嘢接受唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;自三年前被捕還押後，伍健偉每次出庭應訊，林進都會到場旁聽，又會到獄中探望對方。林進表示，每次探監都沒有傾談太多日常生活，反而是伍健偉關心朋友的近況：「嗰15分鐘都係講朋友嘅多，內容都係好實在，無咩閒話家常。」不過，林進指伍健偉仍然很關心香港，很關心朋友：「佢仲好有意志。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林進提到，伍健偉即使面對漫長的審訊，意志仍然非常堅定，稍後寸情的時候出「有說話想對香港人講」：「咁漫長嘅審訊，正常人坐監，意志都好容易磨蝕。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;憶伍健偉比樂觀仲樂觀-王逸戰到場旁聽仲喺度&quot;&gt;憶伍健偉「比樂觀仲樂觀」 王逸戰到場旁聽：仲喺度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前「賢學思政」召集人王逸戰亦有到場，他指自己是新界西選民，初選時曾與張可森、伍健偉、黃子悅擺街站，因較欣賞他們理念、望令更多人認識，王今亦特意到庭支持三人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;王逸戰苦笑，2020年與伍健偉擺街站，翌年伍因本案被捕還柙，至2022年自己也因煽動顛覆國家政權案入獄，在獄中與伍「玉帛相見」，至今天自己已出獄，伍「仍然喺入面」還柙候判。認識四年，王形容，伍是「比樂觀仲樂觀」、「真誠地樂觀」的人，每次見面也「笑笑口」，與四年前相比「冇乜改變」，「棱角、樂觀都仲喺度」。他又指，伍會很坦誠表達自己想法，覺得「既然行得呢一步，我有嘢想講就去講」，但王補充，伍不是魯莽，而是勇敢，會「三思而後行」，自己在外要做決定時，也會問伍的意見，認為可從他學習，伍會叫他小心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於張可森，王形容他幽默、有才華，笑言初次見面邀他拍攝搞笑片段，張也願意配合，比新聞上所見有血有肉、很真誠。張可森太太在他還柙期間誕下兒子，王嘆張無法如普通父親與孩子相處很可惜，亦不懂怎樣安慰，但覺得能到庭與張見面已是最好的表現。王亦很佩服黃子悅，指她「望落嬌滴滴」，但蘊藏的能量比他想像更大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問有什麼想跟三人說，王坦言「依一刻唔知可以講啲咩」，只想說：「仲喺度」。他說，今天到場主要望聽到被告的陳情，「我覺得我聽到已經心滿意足，我見到佢哋、出現喺呢個地方已經夠」。被告求情陳詞或有不同考量，王說作為過來人，明白他們的處境，會尊重他們說的話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】民主派初選47人案今早進行求情，包括多名新界西、新界東的被告。多名前職工盟成員今早到西九龍法院排隊，希望進入正庭陪伴被告之一的前職工盟主席吳敏兒。前執委吳惠靈對《獨媒》表示上星期曾到羅湖懲教所探望吳敏兒，指對方精神不錯：「佢有盼望嘅。好多嘢想同佢講，但探嘅時間有限，我成日話俾佢聽，見唔到我哋唔等如我哋唔喺度，太多人入唔到正庭，我哋會喺附近與你常在，大家都喺度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳惠靈曾任職工盟屬會學校非教員工會主席，但在參與屬會營後才認識吳敏兒更多，到出任執委後有更多合作：「佢好硬淨，由同英航flight，到今日一直都無變過。佢一直面對好多困難，包括工作上，家庭上嘅壓力，都係堅持做正確嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rz4hH5q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳惠靈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除此之外，吳惠靈曾兩度參選區議會選舉，她指吳敏兒曾攜同子女為其助選，十分熱心。她認為吳敏兒基層出身，為人細心、包容，在職工盟同事出現分歧的時候，亦會耐心地解釋，及與同事商討：「佢做主席係好恰當，有堅強嘅一面，亦都有人對人包容，每個層面都好理解。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳先生則是工黨兼前職工盟成員，同已認識吳敏兒多年。他今早6時到西九龍法院排隊，希望可以入庭旁聽，為吳敏兒送上支持：「點解嚟？佢正直囉，如果佢唔正直，我今日都唔坐喺度啦，仲坐幾個鐘頭？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，陳先生早前到羅湖懲教所探望吳敏兒：「有咩好講呀，宜家都唔需要啦，最緊要保重身體。」他透露吳敏兒狀態不錯，但對方在獲悉涉及國安法的案件，或未獲扣減三分一刑期：「聽到無得減三分一情緒低落啲，呢個肯定。健康各方面無問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（27日）處理第五批共10名被告求情，包括參選新西的8人，以及參選新東的梁國雄和柯耀林。代表張可森的大律師伍頴珊指，張屬「積極參加者」，現正於獄中修讀博士學位，他還柙期間父親離世，兒子亦出生、現時接近3歲，張對未能與妻子和兒子相處感到悲痛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上又讀出張親撰的求情信，提及在獄中的30歲生日作深刻反省，認為審議預算案是立法會議員的責任，關乎廣大市民生活，不應作為政治工具及藉此危害國安。張盼能盡快完成博士學位，不負家人期盼：「當事情告一段落後，我將會以家庭作為人生中心，投入全副精神照顧高堂，並且一如我妻愛我般愛我妻，與她協力養育兒子成人。」至於朱凱廸、梁國雄及黃子悅一方均採納書面陳詞，辯方指黃屬「積極參加者」，正就暴動案服刑，望法庭考慮整體量刑原則，部分刑期分期執行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;各被告精神不俗-郭家麒向旁聽席飛吻&quot;&gt;各被告精神不俗 郭家麒向旁聽席飛吻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今處理求情的10名被告，包括參選新西的朱凱廸、張可森、黃子悅、尹兆堅、郭家麒、吳敏兒、譚凱邦、伍健偉；及參選新東、經審訊後罪成的梁國雄和柯耀林。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於約10時步入法庭，男女被告分成上下兩排，由6名懲教看管。此前獲保釋、其後被裁罪成的柯耀林，戴眼鏡、穿淺綠色中袖裇衫，口袋服筆；去年主動撤銷保釋、正就理大暴動案服刑的黃子悅，去年剪的短髮已留長並紮成馬尾，她戴黑框眼鏡、穿黃綠色上衣，不時望向旁聽席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其餘被告均還柙近3年半，吳敏兒戴眼鏡、紮馬尾，穿粉紅色上衣和黑色外套，微笑向旁聽席點頭。一頭灰白頭髮、穿黑色西裝和打呔的郭家麒，精神不俗，頻向旁聽和律師席揮手和飛吻。尹兆堅穿黑色棒球外套，面形比還柙前略瘦，手指向旁聽席點頭、揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張可森穿灰色間條裇衫、黑色外套，向旁聽席點頭，身型和面型較還柙前胖。梁國雄身穿黑色哲古華拉上衣，一頭灰白短髮，不時低頭摸頭髮。朱凱廸穿藍色裇衫、黑色外套，譚凱邦穿間條白裇衫，沒有律師代表的伍健偉則穿灰色西裝外套、白色上衣，向旁聽席揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;罪脫的李予信、前荃灣區議員陳劍琴、前「天水連線」成員林進、「女長毛」雷玉蓮、前立法會議員劉慧卿、社民連陳寶瑩及黃浩銘等均有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方張可森屬積極參加者還柙期間父離世&quot;&gt;辯方：張可森屬「積極參加者」、還柙期間父離世&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表張可森的大律師伍頴珊認為，《國安法》22條下的刑期分級制並不適用於串謀罪，但法庭可作參考，並認為張屬刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍指，張還柙期間父親離世，張的兒子亦出生，現時接近3歲。伍指，張小時候父親經常不在，他難以見到父親，現在張自己也成為人父，他對未能與妻子和兒子相處感到悲痛（devastated），很希望能陪伴兒子，對於父親離世亦感到加倍後悔和悲傷。法官陳仲衡指，張父不幸離世在判刑考慮的比重不多，法庭較關注張的悔意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張撰求情信盼與妻養育兒子成人&quot;&gt;張撰求情信盼與妻養育兒子成人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續讀出張撰寫的求情信，提及：「在獄中的30歲生日，讓我得以冷靜思過，整理過去，理清思緒，如今的我明白到案中計劃一旦實行到底所衍生的嚴重性，並就此深刻反省。審議財政預算案，是基本法賦與立法會議員的責任，關乎廣大市民生活，不應作為政治工具，亦不應藉此危害國家安全。我也明白到當下的情況及懲處，是我必須學會承擔的後果，未來我希望能盡快完成博士學位，不負家人期盼，尤其是我妻。當事情告一段落後，我將會以家庭作為人生中心，投入全副精神照顧高堂，並且一如我妻愛我般愛我妻，與她協力養育兒子成人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍又指，張於2024年7月8日已取得博士候選人的資格，將會在還柙期間認真完成畢業論文，取得博士學位。據悉張正修讀香港中文大學文化研究博士學位。張伍又呈上多封求情信，張的大學老師對他有很高評價，其妻子、家人亦望法庭能輕判。伍指張沒有案底，重犯機會為零，望法庭能考慮其良好品格和悔意，減刑三分一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黃子悅屬積極參加-望考慮另涉暴動案減刑&quot;&gt;辯方指黃子悅屬「積極參加」 望考慮另涉暴動案減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黃子悅的大律師潘志明亦採納書面陳詞，指黃是本案最年輕的被告，屬刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」。潘續指，雖然黃在理大暴動案保釋期間犯案、兩案性質不同，但兩案均在2019至2020年期間發生，望法庭考慮「整體量刑原則（totality principle）」，部分刑期分期執行。潘又指，黃並非刻意干犯本案，她案發時曾稱否決是《基本法》下的合法權利，「35+」計劃亦由法律專業人士提倡，黃當時真誠誤信為合法，望法庭不要因此加刑太多。庭上並透露，黃就暴動案最快於2025年3月服刑完畢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今早處理新界西、新界東的8名候選人被告的求情。參選新界東、前立法會議員「長毛」梁國雄在陳情書中重申「權力歸於人民」，指這不但是其終生信守的理念，亦是從政的基礎，更是《中國憲法》對人民的莊嚴承諾。長毛表示，今天雖然成為階下囚，但絕無怨言，重申「堅信人民大於國家，人權高於政權」，並希望港人莫失莫忘、爭取民主及守護公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初選案原定今日起處理第五批，即參選新界西的8名被告求情。司法機構網頁昨日顯示，將一併處理參選新界東梁國雄、柯耀林的求情。梁國雄向法庭呈交陳情書，表示自70年代起參與政治運動和社會抗爭，是源於改變社會不公的願望，而爭取民主自由、實現社會主義，亦從沒放棄。他表示一路走來近50年，從黑髮變成白頭，長毛成為短毛，自由人淪為階下囚，均秉持該理念行事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;議會內外均進行抗爭-憾未能爭取全民退休保障&quot;&gt;議會內外均進行抗爭 憾未能爭取「全民退休保障」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;自2004年起，梁國雄曾連續四屆當選立法會議員，他表示無論是一介草民仰或議員，都是當仁不讓，透過制度內外進行各種抗爭，由示威遊行、議會拉布、司法抗爭，到五區總辭變相公投等，爭取政制民主和社會公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;長毛憶述在任立法會議員期間，已多次反對政府的《財政預算案》，以抗議當局重富輕貧，賤視貧苦大眾。他亦不忘重提爭取多年的「全民退休保障」，指政府在財政充裕、社會日漸高齡化時，卻拒絕在預算案中撥款設立，對未能推動當局改革，辜負全港160多萬長者，一直深以為憾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在陳情書中，長毛稱參與初選是因為多年切身體驗，明白必須在立法會中與志同道合者取得過半數議席，才能有足夠壓力令政府推行惠及民生的社會政策；而「五大訴求」中的實行行政長官及立法會雙普選，更是其多年身體力行的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;長毛最重要是持續弘揚抗爭不息的精神&quot;&gt;長毛：最重要是持續弘揚抗爭不息的精神&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;長毛重申無論是「35+」或「35-」，即議會過半與否，「我們不必寄望議會過半就能翻天覆地，亦不要因未能過半而感到灰心絕望」，認為最重要是持續弘揚抗爭不息的精神，爭取香港人最大的動員，共同改變不公不義的社會現狀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在陳情書尾聲，長毛表示已知悉法庭判其有罪的理由，但再次重申立法會議員否決《預算案》乃屬《基本法》早已訂明的憲制權力，《基本法》亦有處理「憲制危機」的程序，讓行政長官、政府官員和立法會議員一齊面對選民壓力，彼此作出適當的舉措和互動解決爭議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;反問為何不在首次否決時便改革-多名社民連成員旁聽支持&quot;&gt;反問為何不在首次否決時便改革 多名社民連成員旁聽支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;長毛認為，議員兩次行使否決權不但是民意依歸，更只是彰顯200萬遊行市民的民意，順從60萬初選投票者的民願。他認為，行政長官面臨下台的憲制危機，必須經歷兩次立法會選舉的民意授權，而既然否決《財政預算案》具全體人民授意，便反問行政長官：「為何不在立法會首度否決時順應民意，推行改革？」他最後強調，權力歸於人民是其終生信守的理念、從政的基礎，更是《中國憲法》對人民的莊嚴承諾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，社民連主席兼長毛妻子陳寶瑩，成員黃浩銘、曾健成及陳皓桓等，今早亦有到庭旁聽支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳情書全文&quot;&gt;陳情書全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　從我在70年代開始參與政治運動和社會抗爭，是一種出於改變社會不公的願望，爭取民主自由、實現社會主義，從沒放棄。一路走來近50年，黑髮變白頭，長毛成短毛，自由人淪為階下囚，我都是秉持這個理念行事。無論是一介草民還是立法會議員，我都是當仁不讓，透過制度內外各種抗爭，由示威遊行、議會拉布、司法抗爭，到五區總辭變相公投等，爭取政制民主和社會公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　我就任立法會議員時，已經多次反對政府的《財政預算案》，抗議政府重富輕貧，賤視貧苦大眾，尤其在財政充裕，社會日漸高齡化時，拒絕在《預算案》中撥款設立「全民退休保障制度」。我未能推動政府改革，辜負全港160多萬長者，一直深以為憾！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　我參與35+初選計劃，就是因為多年切身體驗，明白必須在立法會中與志同道合者取得過半數議席，才能有足夠壓力令政府推行惠及民生的社會政策。「五大訴求」中的實行行政長官及立法會雙普選，更是多年身體力行的目標；正如我所屬的組織社會民主連線在2020年6月的《決議文》所言：「我們不必寄望議會過半就能翻天覆地，亦不要因未能過半而感到灰心絕望」，無論是「35+」還是「35-」，最重要是持續弘揚抗爭不息的精神，爭取香港人最大的動員，共同改變不公不義的社會現狀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　我現在知悉法庭判我有罪的理由，我當初認為立法會議員否決《預算案》乃屬《基本法》早已訂明的憲制權力，《基本法》亦有處理「憲制危機」的程序，讓行政長官、政府官員和立法會議員一齊面對選民壓力，彼此作出適當的舉措和互動解決爭議。行政長官面臨下台的憲制危機，必須經歷兩次立法會選舉的民意授權，缺一不可！既然否決《預算案》有全體人民授意，行政長官為何不在立法會首度否決時順應民意，推行改革？若行政長官執迷不悟，仍然需要多一次人民授權，才會面對下台困局。因此，議員兩次行使否決權是民意依歸，只是彰顯200萬遊行市民民意，順從60萬初選投票者民願。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;　　「權力歸於人民」是我終生信守的理念，從政的基礎，更是《中國憲法》對人民的莊嚴承諾！今天我雖然成為階下囚，但我毋怨。我堅信人民大於國家，人權高於政權，惟願港人莫失莫忘，爭取民主，守護公義！&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ckiuhvB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image28&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（27日）處理參選新西的8人，及梁國雄、柯耀林的求情。其中前元朗區議員伍健偉沒有法律代表，親自陳情。他指暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音，高壓統治和嚴刑峻法只能收一時之效，他參與初選非為私利，而是不希望有人受傷、被捕，甚至犧牲生命。伍又指，初選手段「和平理性非暴力」，「五大訴求」亦合情合理、無被法庭裁定違法，政府是「不為」而非「不能」，惟法官打斷指並非表達政見場合。伍續指，他無打算離開香港，亦願為個人過去一切言行負責，但他不會為與選民所共享的信念和價值道歉，不可辜負人民信任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，伍健偉是否沒有悔意？伍答「無錯」，指作為政治人物，期許自己要有承擔、竭盡所能，留守到最後一刻，「所以我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落」。伍指未來打算放低政治人物身分，但仍望貢獻香港社會，認為港人只要抱持自救互助精神，活在真實的當下，理想定會實現，「長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。」法官陳慶偉最後指，由於伍較遲認罪和沒有悔意，減刑折扣明顯會較他人少，伍表示完全明白。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沒有律師代表的伍健偉自行陳詞，他身穿灰色西裝外套、白色襯衫，捧着文件走到被告欄前方，以咪高峰發言。伍先表示，已向法庭提交兩份手寫陳詞，並指：「喺我正式陳詞前，我想向之前代表我嘅資深大律師、大律師及律師團隊，感謝佢哋熱心同埋專業嘅服務。另外，我感恩社會各界對我哋嘅關心同埋支持。最後，我感激每一個愛我嘅人，對我嘅付出同埋犧牲，我祝福各位平安、健康。」說罷轉身向着旁聽席鞠躬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍初選陽光下進行逾61萬人投票-被告非為私利犯案&quot;&gt;伍：初選陽光下進行、逾61萬人投票 被告非為私利犯案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍健偉先就法律原則陳詞，他認為自己於本案屬刑期3至10年的「積極參加者」，但就控方對刑期10年以上的「首要分子或罪行重大」的詮釋，望提出數點讓法庭考慮。伍先指，「35+計劃」是在陽光底下進行、眾所周知的計劃，當中的手段和目的均清晰、明確和為人熟知。伍指，要達致進入立法會無差別否決財政預算案，「單靠我哋47個被告係冇可能完成」，他們要成為立法會議員，「係需要廣大嘅香港市民向我哋授權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續指，2020年7月《國安法》實施後，有超過61萬香港市民參與初選投票，他指毫無疑問，當時「唔係一個絕對唔違法嘅情況」，故61萬市民「係冒住犯上法律嘅風險」進行投票。伍續指，作為民意代表，除了有責任遵守法律義務，「我嘅首要責任，係為選民去爭取佢哋嘅合理訴求。作為一個代議士，我哋有責任去保護支持我哋嘅香港市民」，望法官考慮各被告犯下本案的原因，「並唔係出於個人嘅利益同埋私利。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;同意可引致憲政危機但非憲政災難&quot;&gt;同意可引致憲政危機、但非憲政災難&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍表示，他同意本案所造成的後果可引致「憲政危機」，但不同意是「憲政災難」，因《基本法》第50至52條已預計相關情況出現，法律授權政府如何處理。雖然無可避免嚴重干預政府施政效率，但他認為各被告充其量只是干犯《國安法》第22條第3項，即嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞特區政權機關依法履行職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍稱五大訴求合情合理政府不為非不能-官打斷促勿發政見&quot;&gt;伍稱五大訴求合情合理、政府「不為非不能」 官打斷促勿發政見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續說，五大訴求「係一個合情、合理、無被法庭裁定違法嘅訴求」，「五大訴求對於特區政府係不為也，而非不能為也」，因至少撤回逃犯條訂條例一項早於2020年7月前已滿足。伍望法庭考慮，「我哋唔係追求緊一個虛無飄渺、海市蜃樓嘅願望，香港市民就住五大訴求嘅每一個訴求⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官陳慶偉打斷，指今天是求情聆訊，「並不是讓你表達政見的場合」，他又指，從伍提交的信可理解其立場，「如任何人想發表政治陳述，隨便，但不是在我的法庭內。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍稱被捕後始知計劃違法&quot;&gt;伍稱被捕後始知計劃違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍微笑說「明白法官你嘅立場嘅」，續就性質是否「罪行重大」陳詞。法官陳仲衡指伍自視為「積極參加者」，無需就此陳詞，伍回應「雖然我自己定位係積極參與者啫」，但如法庭不同意，仍望作回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續指，案發時的背景，是街頭激烈衝突已持續非常長時間，「我唔希望有人受傷，唔希望有人被捕，更加唔希望再有人因為政治事件而犧牲佢哋嘅生命，所以我選擇參與35+初選計劃，因為至少呢個手段雖然係違法，但呢個手段係和平、理性、非暴力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，伍何時意識到計劃是違法？伍指是「2021年1月6號我被拘捕嘅時候」。李運騰追問，伍曾稱當時作為代議士只能繼續，是否代表案發時已知道計劃可能違法？伍同意，補充初選投票後，政府官員、中聯辦及港澳辦發聲明指初選可能違法。李運騰指，政府是於初選前已發聲明，又指時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞僅稱「可能」違法，因為是由法庭而非他裁定是否違法，曾最多只能說「可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍回應，作為市民，有理由相信政府不會任由罪案發生，「如果呢件事係一個咁明確嘅違法罪行，我有理由相信政府嘅執法部門唔會容許成件事發生，發生完咗之後半年都冇進行任何嘅執法。」李運騰指，警方執法程序非法庭考慮，法庭只關注案發時伍是否得知協議違法。伍再回應，當時對否決預算案「我並無得知，甚至認為有可能係違法」，法官陳仲衡指控罪非僅否決、而是無差別否決，伍指明白，但「不過都一樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音嚴刑峻法只能收一時之效&quot;&gt;伍：暴動是人民無被聽見的聲音、嚴刑峻法只能收一時之效&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍於小休後，續就個人背景陳詞。他以右手拿着手寫的求情信，表示現年28歲，正修讀都會大學榮譽學士課程，未婚，「係一個恨嫁嘅男人」，有被告和旁聽人士發笑。伍指，他被捕前沒有案底，2020年當選為元朗區議員，並於本案承認控罪：「法官閣下，我承認串謀顛覆國家政權，我為我個人過去一切嘅言行而負責」，而他欲交代犯案原因，望法官給予一定耐性及包容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續指，他於1995年出生，自1997年以來，香港涉社運被檢控的罪名及刑罰「拾級而上、越發嚴苛」，但及後社運的參與人數、時間、規模及激烈程度仍逐步擴大。伍認為，「每一場暴動都係人民無被聽見的聲音」，如香港人民訴求持續被漠視，矛盾和衝突必然接腫而來，「高壓統治、嚴刑峻法，充其量只能夠收一時之效」，深層次矛盾必須尋求解決之道，社會才可能復和邁進、穩定繁榮，「否則難言長治久安，更加枉論由治及興。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍參選因恐懼自由被侵蝕對離世生命沉重悲痛&quot;&gt;伍：參選因恐懼自由被侵蝕、對離世生命沉重悲痛&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍指，參與初選有遠因和近因，遠因是源於其個人信念，「相信政府係人民嘅僕人，而唔係統治者」，「作為一個香港人，我有一個理想，我認為大家應該擁有、亦都值得擁有自由、平等、包容嘅社會，有效維護人權、法治、公義嘅民主制度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續指，參選近因是2019年，當時他恐懼自由被侵蝕，對政府傲慢感不滿，而最令他動容的原因，是他「對離世生命嘅沉重悲痛」。伍指，他完全不希望有人受傷、被捕，更難以忍受有人犧牲生命，自己卻無動於衷、毫不作為。作為普通市民，他無能力起死回生，亦無法阻止他們付出自由和生命的代價，「但係我有義務去繼承佢哋嘅信念」，他認為參與社會運動、地區服務、投身政治，是可為社會貢獻的行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍代議士責任爭取選民訴求願承擔風險尋求破局機會&quot;&gt;伍：代議士責任爭取選民訴求、願承擔風險尋求破局機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍健偉指，他在2019年憑4,371名選民信任成為元朗區議員，初選亦憑20,525位港人支持勝出，如2020年立法會選舉順利舉辦，當天的結果「可能會係我人生之中最榮幸收到嘅生日禮物」。伍續指，成為一個代議士、一個香港民意的代表，「我期許我自己嘅首要責任，係為民發聲、為民請命，我有責任去捍衛人民嘅權利同埋自由，努力爭取選民合情合理嘅訴求得以實現，即使機會係渺茫，即使我個人對於喺建制上尋求改革毫無信心，但我仍然會選擇承擔風險，尋求打破局面嘅機會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問是什麼風險，伍指正如信中下一段所說，在被捕前，「我實在冇諗過會因為本案而入獄」，但不等於他認為成為代議士不會犯《國安法》——即使他無成為立法會議員，但在《國安法》下繼續參與政治或社運，也有很大風險犯法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍指無一刻打算離港-確認沒有悔意&quot;&gt;伍指無一刻打算離港 確認沒有悔意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍繼續陳詞，表示被捕前，「我冇任何一刻打算離開香港，我願意為我嘅行為負責，但係我唔會為我同選民所共享嘅信念同埋價值而道歉，我唔可以辜負人民嘅信任。」法官李運騰問，是否可理解伍健偉是對所作的事沒有悔意？伍沉默片刻，凝重說：「正如我所講，我為我嘅所有言行而負責，我會承擔一切嘅代價。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指那並非他的問題，再問伍對所作的事是否沒有悔意？伍直視法官說：「無錯。」伍續說：「作為一個政治人物，我期許我要有承擔，竭盡我所能，留守到最後一刻，所以我並唔後悔，我選擇留喺香港，我需要兌現我莊嚴嘅承諾，同香港人齊上齊落。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍稱打算放低政治人物身分-但仍望貢獻香港社會&quot;&gt;伍稱打算放低政治人物身分 但仍望貢獻香港社會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍續說展望將來，他作為民意代表的任期已完結，「我打算放低政治人物嘅身分，但我仍然希望，盡力留喺香港貢獻社會」，即使已預視到困難重重。法官李運騰打斷，指伍的說法可有不同解讀，他關注伍的重犯風險，望伍澄清「貢獻」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍指將會講到，並先指一如時任終審法官包致金所言，「There is no reason to leave if things are good, and if things are bad, there are more reasons to stay.」，「我認為香港人同我只要抱持自救互助嘅精神，理性嘅思考，行公義、好憐憫，存謙卑嘅心，記錄過去嘅真相，活在真實嘅當下，為未來做好真誠嘅準備，香港嘅未來，將會重拾光明，而香港人嘅理想，一定會實現。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;伍絕對權力必帶來絕對腐敗-信民主終再得勝&quot;&gt;伍：絕對權力必帶來絕對腐敗 信民主終再得勝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;伍最後指，二十世紀完結，人們向蘇聯和納粹作告別，「失去足夠制衡嘅權力必然會自我膨脹，絕對嘅權力必定帶來絕對嘅腐敗，長夜終盡，黎明將至，民主終將再次得勝。我感謝三位法官嘅包容同埋忍耐，本人謹此作結。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱因無悔意-認罪扣減會較他人少&quot;&gt;官稱因無悔意 認罪扣減會較他人少&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就伍健偉認罪的日期，羅天瑋助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋指，2022年10月伍健偉的律師代表去信表示擬認罪，伍於11月3日案件管理聆訊上再次確認，至2023年2月6日案件開審首天，伍於庭上認罪，並於同年10月5日聽取承認案情，確認伍是於案件交付高院後認罪、審訊訂定之前改認罪。法官李運騰指根據案例，最多只可獲25%減刑，法官陳慶偉並指，由於伍較遲認罪和沒有悔意，其認罪扣減會明顯比其他人為少（significantly less than other），問他有沒有話想說。伍回應：「冇嘅，法官，我完全明白嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（27日）處理參選新西的8人，及梁國雄、柯耀林的求情。尹兆堅一方指他投身公共服務近20年，曾成功爭取殘疾人士2元乘車優惠和長者生活津貼等，出獄後打算於國際人權組織「世界中央廚房」任職，亦獲3名前高官蕭偉強、羅致光及張炳良撰求情信，指他和平理性。惟法官關注尹過往有4次定罪紀錄，就其良好品格的求情理由能否「循環再用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭家麒一方亦指郭和平理性，獲前高官邱誠武及前議員石禮謙和張超雄撰求情信，張提到郭曾阻止示威者七一衝擊立法會大樓。辯方又指，郭在公民黨解散前已退黨，出獄後望繼續行醫，退出政治，沒有重犯機會，望法庭考慮他犯案完全與性格不符，採納「積極參加者」的較低量刑起點。法官質疑，本案串謀持續多月，郭必然對參選作詳細考慮，不認同他犯案是與性格不符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指尹投身公共服務近廿年-官關注求情理由能否循環再用&quot;&gt;辯方指尹投身公共服務近廿年 官關注求情理由能否「循環再用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立法會議員尹兆堅由大律師莫彥婷代表，莫指尹投身公共服務近20年，他於1994年成為註冊社工，自2004年起四度當選區議員，並於2016年當選立法會議員，服務不同公職。其中尹自2002年起設立殘疾人士爭取交通半費優惠聯席，10年後成功爭取殘疾人士2元乘車優惠，亦成功爭取長者生活津貼和拆除臨時房屋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，得悉尹的貢獻，但他曾有4次定罪紀錄，該些案件均已考慮其良好品格；法官李運騰亦關注，若其他案件已因尹的公共服務和良好品格而減刑，法庭是否能將相關理由「循環再用」。莫指，相關案件並未考慮尹的公共服務往績，明日會向法庭補充詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;尹獲3前高官撰求情信-讚和平理性&quot;&gt;尹獲3前高官撰求情信 讚和平理性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;尹兆堅亦獲兩名前勞工及福利局局長蕭偉強、羅致光，以及前運輸及房屋局局長張炳良撰求情信，蕭指尹熱心幫助弱勢，保障貧窮和殘疾人士等權益，雖然未必在所有議題上有共識，但對其可信及有禮印象深刻，相信他會兌現承諾。前黨友羅致光亦指，尹推動社會政策表現和平理性，二人就勞工福利政策有良好有效的交流。辯方指，求情信可顯示尹除公共服務外，為人和平，為政府提供建設性意見，望法庭作進一步扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，尹是出色的廚師，打算在出獄後，將烹飪技術應用在國際人權組織「世界廚房（World Kitchen）」。就案情而言，辯方指尹沒有簽署「墨落無悔」，沒有出席任何選舉論壇，作為民主動員委員，亦不曾參與任何會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;郭家麒撰求情信提公共服務經歷-官質疑無提就本案反思&quot;&gt;郭家麒撰求情信提公共服務經歷 官質疑無提就本案反思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立法會議員郭家麒由資深大律師蔡維邦代表，蔡求情指，郭於2021年9月已表示擬認罪，是最早一批表示認罪的被告，亦不爭議案情，顯示他具悔意。蔡又指，郭是有原則、願意奉獻、具同理心的人，「我做求情近25年，我可以說他是一個具良好品格的人而不面紅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡續讀出郭親撰的求情信，提到他出身草根家庭，八十年代成為醫生，任學生期間目睹多人因工業意外受傷，因而籌辦活動保障工人健康，並成立香港工人健康中心。辯方指，即使郭任職醫生，仍奉獻空餘時間促進弱勢的福祉，他自1994年至2007年任中西區區議員，2004年當選立法會議員，並獲委任為醫管局成員，沙士期間作出貢獻，並與不同官員合作，改善醫療服務。辯方又引郭指，他從無考慮「攬炒」，亦不支持「香港獨立」，任議員多年，目標是確保最邊緣社群獲得足夠資源和照顧。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，郭的長篇求情信提及其行醫和公共服務經歷，但沒有提及對本案行為的反思。蔡維邦指，對任何還柙超過3年的人來說，當然私下有反省，而郭在最早階段認罪亦反映他具備高度悔意，只是沒有在信中直接表達，不認為法庭應將折扣減少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kaJ076a.png&quot; alt=&quot;image35&quot; /&gt;
▲ 前立法會議員石禮謙&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;獲邱誠武石禮謙張超雄撰求情信-稱七一曾阻示威者衝立法會&quot;&gt;獲邱誠武、石禮謙、張超雄撰求情信 稱七一曾阻示威者衝立法會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡維邦又呈上多封求情信，包括兩名曾受助於郭的市民，有女士提到兒子患罕見面顎變形，需進行手術，等候十年卻被醫院取消，無助之際獲郭幫助和申請資助，成功進行手術；有女士亦指，曾因醫療事故失去初生女兒，郭積極跟進院方調查，堅定尋求公義，形容郭具同情心、毅力和尋求問責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭亦獲前運輸及房屋局副局長邱誠武、前立法會議員石禮謙及張超雄撰求情信，邱指二人常就房屋及交通等政策討論，郭一向是弱勢權益的捍衛者，雖與政府意見並非經常一致，但尊重他向政府問責，且二人在改善房屋、工業安全等議題上意見也一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蔡續指，2019年時，郭曾站出來着群眾冷靜，以避免進一步暴力發生，例如曾協助救護車進入警總，以幫助有醫療需要的人。張超雄亦指郭主張和平，在2019至2020年是調停者，例如七一立法會曾站在玻璃門前阻止示威者衝擊大樓，亦因而受傷；8月機場內時任環球時報記者付國豪被示威者綑綁和襲女十水手時，郭和張亦趕到現場阻止，被示威者數度推開。郭於11月理大被圍時，亦曾與一群校長進入學校，嘗試令年輕示威者冷靜，獲該些校長撰求情信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指郭已退黨無重犯機會-屬積極參加者較低程度&quot;&gt;辯方指郭已退黨、無重犯機會 屬「積極參加者」較低程度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方強調，郭為人和平理性，他於公民黨解散前已退黨，並決定退出政治，沒有重犯機會，服刑完畢後如獲醫務委員會允許，預期會繼續行醫，繼續幫助有需要病人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又認為，郭屬「積極參加者」，望法庭考慮他犯案完全與性格不符（out of character），具良好品格和公共服務，以刑期3至10年的較低程度為量刑起點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望考慮犯案與性格不符-官質疑&quot;&gt;辯方望考慮犯案與性格不符 官質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，郭必然對初選和如何當選作出詳細考慮，不認同郭犯案是與性格不符。辯方重申，郭的行為與他過往多年作為理性政治人物的行徑不同，又指就郭於2020年3月公民黨記者會的言論，當時其行為不可能是違法，不應因此加刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰亦質疑，與性格不符通常是一時衝動、受刺激而犯案，但本案串謀持續多月，被告有多次機會反思其行為，難以被說服此情況下，被告的參與是與性格不符，而且涉案串謀對香港穩定和安全性有很大影響。蔡同意，但重申郭行為與過往紀錄不符，望法庭考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;郭家麒一方求情完畢，案件明早續，將處理餘下兩名新西被告吳敏兒、譚凱邦，以及參選新東的柯耀林求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方為郭家麒申請明日不到庭獲批，散庭時，張可森舉手，並走近被告欄咪高峰，表示想申請明天毋須出席聆訊，梁國雄亦說：「我都係，我都係申請唔嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，郭家麒向旁聽席飛吻，又單手放頭上做心形手勢，並頻頻向旁聽席和律師致意和鞠躬。黃子悅亦向丈夫飛吻。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;法官引導陪審團：不能撇開2019年反修例運動背景&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/XDcpJaL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】2019年12月，「屠龍小隊」成員等涉計劃放炸彈及開槍殺警。6男1女否認「串謀謀殺」及「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」等罪，今（26日）踏入第80日審訊，法官張慧玲第六日引導陪審團。張官指，控方沒有直接的證供可證明各被告達成協議，並屬串謀者，大部分是依賴環境證供。而陪審團需要小心考慮環境證供，不能單憑推斷或臆測。控方於結案陳詞指，陪審團可考慮2019年的社會氛圍狀況，以推論本案的串謀；辯方卻不同意這個做法。張官今表示，不可能完全不考慮2019年的社會事件作為背景，反而要考慮相關背景，不能將其撇開，當時串謀者打算趁民陣遊行期間執行計劃，而「唔係就咁擺個炸彈喺街」。張官預計明天可讓陪審團退庭商議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官無直接證供證明被告達成協議主要依賴環境證供&quot;&gt;官：無直接證供證明被告達成協議、主要依賴環境證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官張慧玲第六日引導陪審團。她指，控方沒有直接的證供可證明各被告達成協議，並屬串謀者，大部分是依賴環境證供。在處理環境證供時，陪審團需要先考慮控方能否證明控罪的元素，之後再考慮各被告的情況。張官將上述兩項比喻為兩條線，陪審團需要考慮將他們加在一起後，能否成為一條有足夠力量的繩去支撐。張官同時提醒，需要小心謹慎考慮環境證供，不能單憑推斷或臆測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官引辯方指-單憑tg訊息不能證明被告參與串謀&quot;&gt;官引辯方指 單憑TG訊息不能證明被告參與串謀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官引述辯方立場指，沒有直接證供顯示各被告與串謀有關，實際上「屠龍」隊員並不知道行動內容及詳情，單憑 Telegram 訊息並不能證明他們為串謀一份子。張官亦指，陪審團需要小心衡量，污點證人黃振強是否如辯方所指，有動機虛構證供並冤枉其他被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控方依賴的「共同串謀者原則」，張官指部分證據為 Telegram 的群組及私訊的訊息，雖然被告並不在場，但陪審團要考慮被告的發言，是否為了令計劃可以付諸實行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官需考慮2019年反修例運動作為背景&quot;&gt;官：需考慮2019年反修例運動作為背景&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方曾於結案陳詞指，陪審團可考慮2019年的社會氛圍狀況，以推論本案的串謀；辯方卻不同意這個做法。張官今表示，不可能完全不考慮2019年的社會事件作為背景，反而需要考慮相關背景，不能將其撇開而憑空思考。她解釋指當時有很多人因反修例運動上街，這屬事實，而污點證人黃振強亦提及自己有參與示威。因此，張官認為不能用現時的社會情況去考慮，因必定與當時的環境有差別，當時串謀者打算趁民陣遊行期間執行計劃，而「唔係就咁擺個炸彈喺街」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪，張官指陪審團需要考慮控方所指向警方投擲汽油彈的行為，是否符合法例中的「恐怖主義行為」定義。控方主要依賴劉知悉「屠龍」的示威精華片段，並知道籌款是用作購買「火魔法」，即汽油彈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張官尚未完成引導，案件明（27日）續審，預計明天將會讓陪審團退庭商議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案共7名被告，其中6男即張俊富、張銘裕、嚴文謙、李家田、賴振邦及許湛榮，均否認《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》下的「串謀犯對訂明標的之爆炸」罪、作為交替控罪的「串謀導致相當可能會危害生命或對財產造成嚴重損害的爆炸罪」；以及「串謀謀殺」罪，對象為警務人員。李家田另否認「意圖危害生命而管有槍械及彈藥」罪。女子劉佩凝則否認「串謀提供或籌集財產以作出恐怖主義行為」罪。&lt;/p&gt;
