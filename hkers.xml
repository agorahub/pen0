&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly nine long months into Israel’s war on Gaza, few topics remain as controversial as Israel’s targeting mechanisms, especially the reported use of several AI systems in its processes. Following the initial reports on “Gospel”, I argued that such a model has a more limited role in the targeting cycle. However, later reporting on models like “Lavender” challenged many assumptions, and raised further concerns about AI in Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) decision-making roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless the IDF permits full access to its systems, we cannot fully gauge the veracity of reported claims, including the +972 Mag’s reporting, the facts of which remain contentious. In light of continued disagreement on the actual capabilities and roles of these systems, it is crucial to understand the many considerations of the targeting process and the many points of failure inherent in such a cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is neither an evaluation of the IDF’s legal targeting standards, an assessment of its operational efficacy in achieving war aims, nor a simple criticism of the staggering human cost imposed by the IDF upon the Gazan population. Instead, this piece outlines broadly how targeting cycles operate, including the critical points where technology could limit or expand civilian deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will focus on procedures surrounding air-based targeted killings and dynamic strikes, to differentiate from fire support for ground forces. While targeting shares many of its aspects across military branches, it should be noted that IDF procedures, including targeting, are believed to differ across sectors and commanders in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intelligence-gathering-and-processing&quot;&gt;Intelligence Gathering and Processing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Gaza, Israel maintains one of the densest intelligence networks of any modern conflict zone, which has been built up since its occupation of the Strip. Gazan militants lack any real air defences, permitting crewed and uncrewed aircraft (both Israeli and non-Israeli) to perform near-constant surveillance, producing droves of electronic and communication intelligence. Other forms of intelligence collection include imaging from satellites, ground troops relaying operational information, and a variety of intelligence from Western governments. Combined with Palestinian data archives from decades of surveillance, the IDF possesses as close to perfect intelligence as possible in a modern combat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer quantity of Israel’s intelligence could cripple its ability to translate data into actionable insights. Raw data from cameras, radar, phone data and other sensors must be sorted, cleaned and delegated to the appropriate places for “exploitation”. “Cleaning” this data manually would be impossible, so to minimise the number of human analysts and avoid fatigue-induced errors, AI is typically involved at this stage. Machine learning (ML) models can use pattern recognition to identify potentially relevant information from raw feeds, including persons or objects of interest, vehicle movements, or even rocket launches. The intel is typically translated into common formats which can be combined to present a holistic view of the battlespace for an analyst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the quantity of intelligence is positively correlated with accuracy and certainty in decision-making, an intelligence-sifting system which processes far greater quantities of data than a human analyst would reduce unintended casualties in the targeting cycle. However, this is only possible with a reliable system that avoids frequent false positives (hallucinations) while simultaneously not missing relevant intelligence (errors). The model would also likely exhibit the biases of the humans who created, trained and trialled the system, bottlenecking the intelligence that can be used at future stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Theoretically, the processing power of machine learning could empower analysts to make decisions with much higher accuracy, combining intelligence to provide a rigorous depiction of the potential target&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine-tuning to avoid these inaccuracies would occur during the model’s training, but occasional mistakes are inevitable in any such system. Yet there has been no indication of processes to correct the model while in operational use (see below). Meanwhile, the +972 Mag’s reporting claims that Lavender’s apparent 10% misidentification rate is considered tolerable by the IDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intelligence-analysis&quot;&gt;Intelligence Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the cleaned data is aggregated, an analyst will search for actionable intelligence, either tracking previously banked targets or looking for specifically identifiable ones. Satellite images of weaponry/equipment, enemy faces in video feeds, and the location of specific radio signatures are all examples of intelligence that can lead to target creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis models would parse the cleaned data to recognise specific identifiers comparable to the processing systems, albeit with greater specialisation. Analysis might involve several models, each focused on a certain type of analysis, such as spectrum analysis, face recognition, vehicle/weapon identification or voice recognition, while machine outputs could range from basic intelligence profiles to actionable targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a binary selection, models would provide a likelihood of positive identification, which could be summarised as “X model identified X militant with a certainty of X%”. ML excels at this form of probabilistic pattern recognition and could ideally make the targeting process more transparent and accurate. However, these benefits hinge solely on how a potential model is employed. Even if the certainty is outputted for analysts (a simple matter for a model), the analyst and commander must understand how and why the model produced both the target and the certainty. Unless the certainty is near 100% for a given target (and hopefully even then), positive identification should be corroborated by other intelligence mediums, such as phone signals or human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the IDF likely has a threshold for determining whether a strike is warranted. With high-fidelity systems, a high threshold for identification would reduce the risk of civilian deaths due to target misidentification, while a low threshold could result in an effectively indiscriminate campaign against a population. This is arguably the point where human involvement is most important. Theoretically, the processing power of ML could empower analysts to make decisions with much higher accuracy, combining their various ML-enabled intelligence reports to provide a rigorous depiction of the potential target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigative reporting has cast doubt upon the image of a human-centred targeting process. According to these claims, human involvement is only a cursory check, lasting under a minute. The reasons for such a hurried, shallow review are likely a mix of automation bias, pressure to create/approve quantities of targets, and old-fashioned analyst fatigue. Similar considerations around errors, hallucinations, data quality and bias from the “processing” stage also apply for machine analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF’s response claims that such a system is limited to intelligence management tools more akin to sophisticated intelligence-cleaning models, which output mere correlations in the data. Even if they are not using a target creation system (which would still reasonably fall under the category of “ecision support system”), analysts would need to understand how these tools autonomously collate intelligence on suspected militants, as well as the reliability of their correlational mechanisms. Still, the sheer number of targets struck by the IDF lends weight to the argument that humans are not fully creating, or at least thoroughly analysing, each target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operational-planning&quot;&gt;Operational Planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon the identification of a target, it is either added to a target bank to be monitored and struck at a later time, or sent up the chain of command for strike planning and approval. When choosing the most appropriate means for a strike, timing and location selections require the balancing of target vulnerability with risk to families or bystanders. Delivery platforms comprise crewed and uncrewed aircraft launching air-to-ground munitions, although planners would ideally choose from a variety of means, including ground-based fires or pinpoint raids using small arms. Acceptable limits on these factors are predefined as rules of engagement (ROE) for a specific operation or set of operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ROE are often less stringent for dynamic strikes against targets of opportunity – typically those presenting an imminent threat and/or a limited window of opportunity. These strikes are not preplanned and are instead identified and struck in real time, reducing the time for collateral death estimates (CDE). The IDF apparently began shifting towards more dynamic strikes as it exhausted its previously banked targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When responding to criticism over civilian deaths from strikes, the IDF typically cites the use of “precision munitions”. However, precision does not equate to discrimination. A munition’s precision is simply its likelihood of hitting its intended target, so a precision munition is a guided bomb, rocket or shell with a high likelihood of striking its target. The controversial 2,000 GBU-31 bombs are precise when outfitted with the JDAM guidance kit, with the decrease in required munitions translating to less destruction, but this does not mean that strikes are discriminate. A discriminate strike is one that only hits the intended target. While it is extraordinarily difficult to conduct a strike in an urban environment with a 0% chance of collateral damage, the choice of a GBU-31 (or even the 1,000 lb GBU-32 or various 500 lb bombs) indicates intentional indiscrimination – the 900 kg munition has a lethal radius of hundreds of metres, and can create a crater several metres deep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Munition selection also depends on the availability of different munitions. Despite their greater payload and therefore less discriminate nature, large, air-dropped munitions are typically the first choice of munition due to their price point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key to understanding the IDF’s operational planning is the value it places upon the lives of its soldiers relative to Palestinian civilians. Especially compared to US and allied militaries, the IDF appears to be willing to inflict immense cost upon civilians to reduce the risk to its soldiers. The preference for air strikes over ground, even at the risk of increased collateral damage, is driven by decades of Palestinian dehumanisation, combined with intense domestic pressure to protect Israel’s conscripted population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains unknown whether the IDF’s ML systems are used during the operational planning stage or during dynamic targeting. In theory, systems could incorporate ROE to predict a strike’s impact for an analyst, akin to the reporting on Lavender and “Fire Factory”. The IDF also claim that the models generate CDE, the accuracy of which – given the sophistication of Israeli intelligence – there is no reason to doubt, regardless of whether it is generated by a human expert or a machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a model for operational planning would provide the user with the ability to visualise the civilian impact of different munition and location choices faster than humanly possible, which – when combined with proper Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) adherence – would lower civilian deaths or cause the cancellation of a strike altogether. In this manner, the model would not be treated as a replacement for a human analyst, but as an operational planning tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legal-considerations-and-commander-approval&quot;&gt;Legal Considerations and Commander Approval&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece seeks to sidestep the many legal debates about both Israel’s right to respond militarily and its wider conduct in the war, instead focusing on the considerations surrounding a single strike. During the operational planning and command approval stages, legal considerations about a strike determine compliance with LOAC. The legality of any individual strike (given jus ad bellum) rests mainly on the concept of proportionality. Given proportionality’s subjective nature, the legality of killing civilians remains a contested concept in LOAC, demonstrating the tension between legality and morality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides proportionality, an attacker must undertake “feasible measures to minimise harm to civilians” when undertaking strikes against enemy targets. Historically, the IDF often undertook several types of warnings prior to its strikes to get civilians out of harm’s way. Even besides the mixed success of these measures, they cannot obfuscate the high rate of civilian deaths per strike compared to other conflicts. This highlights the lack of numerous other feasible precautions, such as the operational considerations in munition selection and timing discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the case of the IDF, it seems clear that it has used AI systems not to refine targeting, but to expand and expedite its target cycle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every state – including the “most moral army in the world” – must abide by LOAC, regardless of an enemy’s violations of international law. Additionally, the embedding of an insurgent force within a population is not a new phenomenon and does not absolve the IDF of its LOAC commitments. The presence of human shields or hostages does not change the fact that these are civilians, who must be treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how Israel applies these legal considerations in its targeting cycle. Traditionally, a legal advisor (a Military Advocate General’s Corps officer [MAG] in the IDF) is consulted during operational planning, but given the sheer quantity of airstrikes conducted – especially at the beginning of the war – the likelihood that a judge advocate rigorously examined every single strike is low. Consequently, “legal advising” might merely comprise checking “yes” or “no” to decide whether the predicted deaths are consistent with “acceptable” rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claim in the +972 Mag’s reporting thus begins to look more likely, with commanders relying on a “predetermined and fixed collateral damage degree” rather than in-depth proportionality assessments for each strike. These are values given to commanders indicating the maximum “acceptable” number of civilians who can be killed as collateral in a strike. A commander can exceed this number for a high-value target only with approval from higher levels of command. The number differs depending on the target; for example, it is allegedly 15–20 civilians per “low-ranking militant” and over 100 civilians for a more senior commander. The use of a discrete value has precedent, such as the US’s “non-combatant casualty cut-off value” in Iraq and Afghanistan, although it remains controversial due to the subjective valuation of some lives over others and the high discrepancy between the number of civilian deaths considered tolerable by Western militaries and the IDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the questions about if and how models generate collateral estimates, all other responsibility at this stage rests on human actors. Any programming of LOAC into the models is unlikely due both to the complex, often abstract reasoning required as well as the continued misgivings about military AI from the legal community. Instead, a commander must understand the logic and evidence behind any strike recommendations, regardless of whether they are created by an analyst or model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;post-operation-assessment&quot;&gt;Post-Operation Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any strike or operation requires a post-mortem to understand what went right and what went wrong. Battle damage assessments determine whether the strike was successful at eliminating the target, while analysts conduct collateral damage assessments to ensure greater civilian protection in future strikes (assuming they are directed at only ostensibly military targets). Autonomous models could perform some of these tasks, parsing intelligence about the strike to provide insights to commanders and analysts. These insights, whether produced by man or machine, should then be fed into models at the “processing” and “analysis” stages of the cycle, creating a feedback loop. Absent this “on-the-job-training”, not only will a model never improve beyond its starting capability, with its biases and errors repeated ad infinitum, but it could potentially worsen as model drift increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there has been no indication that the IDF has been attempting to learn lessons from its strikes. It is fairly easy to verify deaths from specific strikes using reports from journalists in Gaza and the Ministry of Heath, not to mention the IDF’s continuous surveillance of the besieged territory. With the continued large-scale killing of innocents, one may be forgiven for assuming that either the IDF does not recognise these deaths as errors, or it is simply indifferent. The +972 Mag’s report even claims that damage assessments were abolished for junior militants. Although the rate of civilian deaths during the war has slowed relative to the first months of the war, this has been mainly as a result of international pressure, rather than humanitarian concern from the IDF. Any desire to review procedures only appears when the Israeli government faces a heavy backlash from its dwindling number of allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of AI in the targeting process is not inherently inhumane, but this depends entirely on how models are trained, tested and employed. In the case of the IDF, it seems clear that it has used systems not to refine targeting, but to expand and expedite its target cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If true, this would indicate, at best, a carelessness and recklessness from the IDF, placing speed of target generation above discrimination and the preservation of civilian life. At worst, such a target selection process constitutes a systematic devaluation of Palestinian lives, which could be reasonably considered collective punishment. Ultimately, while technology can change the speed or scale of military action, any accuracy or discrimination failures in the targeting cycle must be blamed solely on human choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mLy6Z1s.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（3日）續處理6名港島初選參與者的求情。代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀表示，彭基於對新法無知而犯案，他在《國安法》後已通知民主動力移除政綱，誤以為足以確保不違法；而彭具持續的愛國聯繫、熱心服務國家，曾推廣年輕人到大灣區創業，被捕後又受僱於「香港基本法基金會」，推廣《基本法》、維護國家安全，犯案是與其良好品格相違。惟法官拒納彭有撤回政綱，並質疑彭初選時以極端激進言辭反對政府和國家，被捕後改為到推廣基本法的組織工作，其行為不一致、只是另一投機之舉，彭或是「一個偽裝成愛國者的機會主義者」；法官又質疑，辯方求情明顯與法庭裁決、以及彭在初選的形象相違，明言難以接納。基本法基金會秘書長侯叔祺也有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二批被告今完成求情，本周五（7月5日）將處理第三批被告求情，為6名九龍東初選參與者：黃之鋒、譚文豪、李嘉達、譚得志、胡志偉及施德來，料需時2天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選港島區初選的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、鄭達鴻、徐子見、楊雪盈昨完成求情，法庭今處理彭卓棋的求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨已完成求情的鄭達鴻和徐子見兩人，今沒有到庭，其餘4人分成兩排就坐，向旁聽席微笑揮手。昨天紮髻的楊雪盈今束低馬尾，昨繫領帶的梁晃維今則無戴領帶，其餘各人裝束打扮與昨天大致一樣。佔中「大黃伯」、前立法會議員梁繼昌、前民陣召集人陳皓桓、社運人士曾健成等均有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指彭為機會主義者服務國家&quot;&gt;辯方指彭為「機會主義者」服務國家&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表彭的大律師盧敏儀表示，其立場與書面陳詞一致。法官陳仲衡引述辯方陳詞，提及彭卓棋是「機會主義者」，把握每個機會為國家服務，陳質疑法庭在判詞形容彭是「機會主義者」，意思非如辯方所指（“… that’s not what we mean”）。盧表示明白，但強調她對於所說的很認真（“I mean everything I said.”）。翻查判詞，法官指彭是是個投機取巧及不可信的證人，作出對自己有利的說法（“opportunistic and incredible witness who gave self-serving evidence”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方彭基於對新法無知犯案&quot;&gt;辯方：彭基於對新法無知犯案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀表示，彭是基於對法律的無知犯案，解釋《國安法》是新法例，在通過前沒有任何公眾諮詢和醞釀、也無時間讓公眾了解和調整其行為，不是普通的法例。法官陳慶偉指法例由全國人大通過，當然不是普通法例，但指其時為2019至2020年，本港幾乎不可能通過任何法例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧續指，彭卓棋沒有案底，案發時僅約25至26歲，沒有政治聯繫，誤信當時所做的行為，包括通知民主動力移除政綱，已足以確保他沒有觸犯《國安法》。惟法官李運騰質疑，彭其後派發撕掉的政綱，又發布手持爛單張握拳的相片，姿勢像是抗議，法庭不接納彭有撤回他此前立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指彭已移除政綱-官質疑屬抗議拒納有撤回立場&quot;&gt;辯方指彭已移除政綱 官質疑屬抗議、拒納有撤回立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀補充，彭曾到初選票站確保政綱被移除，又從新聞得悉有愛國者稱初選不違法，錯誤以為其行為已足以表示他已退出「35+計劃」。惟法官陳慶偉表明不能接納這點，並指彭大可退出初選。盧同意那更理想，但指彭參選只是望服務人民，惟陳慶偉再指，彭並非如辯方所說的「天真」，提到區諾軒供稱與戴耀廷在初選前接觸彭時，彭關注投電子抑或實體票，可見彭一開始已對計劃感興趣，亦「完全知道他參與的是什麼」；而《國安法》後，他又發布撕掉選舉單張的相片作為抗議，其握拳姿勢是「對抗多於順從」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀指，彭是被攝影師要求做出該姿勢，法官陳慶偉指情況或許是那樣，「但誰是老闆？他是老闆！他應該告知攝影師他想呈現怎樣的形象！」盧續指，彭作為想參與初選「試水溫」的人，若發布這樣的相片猶如「政治自殺」，惟陳慶偉指當時正是要「鬥黃」。盧續指，彭在《國安法》改為發布實用資訊，他沒有出席任何組織者舉行的記者會，已做出明確行為顯示他誤以為所做的足夠避免犯法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指彭受僱基本法基金會續維護國安-官質疑屬投機&quot;&gt;辯方指彭受僱基本法基金會續維護國安 官質疑屬投機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧敏儀續指，彭的家人、太太和弟弟，以及香港基本法基金會秘書長侯叔祺今也有到庭支持。法官陳仲衡指，彭自2022年5月後受僱於基本法基金會，問辯方陳詞是否指他犯案後「悔過（repent）」，抑或他一直都是愛國者。盧一度同意前者，陳仲衡即追問那彭為何不認罪？盧其後指聽錯問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問，辯方能否澄清本輪求情陳詞，是顯示彭有悔意、顯示他有更生，還是什麼？又問他現時受僱情況與判刑有何關係。盧指，《國安法》目的是維護國家安全，如被告有進行維護國家安全的行為，應屬求情因素；又指彭被聘為「基本法學生中心」會長，基金會不會隨意聘請任何人，他們對彭有觀察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，那是彭案發後的行為，如何協助說服法庭減刑；陳慶偉亦指，盧形容其當事人為「機會主義者」，這或是他另一次投機。法官陳仲衡補充指，是「一個偽裝成愛國者的機會主義者（an opportunist masquerading as a patriot）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方呈求情信-官質疑與裁決相違彭為人不一致&quot;&gt;辯方呈求情信 官質疑與裁決相違、彭為人不一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧指她不能同意，李運騰續指如辯方立場是彭已經改變，不大可能重犯，他可以理解，但除此以外不認為其受僱情況與判刑有關。盧續補充，彭參與基金會工作，更顯他的堅決和投入。惟李即指，彭卓棋先是推廣大灣區創業，至初選時用極端激進言辭反對政府甚至國家，被捕後卻再次改變，改為到推廣《基本法》的組織工作，「除了指他事實上就是一名機會主義者，我們如何能看出你當事人的行為是一致？」（“How can we see any consistency in the behaviour of your client, apart from saying that he is in fact an opportunist?”）法官陳仲衡亦指，對彭在選舉期間所說的話「記憶猶新（fresh in our mind）」，法庭已拒納他解釋自己僅在說「選舉語言」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧續指，彭曾創立「香港青年創業聯盟」，盡其所能協助年輕人到大灣區創業，可見他有良好品格；又引述多封求情信，來自已認識彭多年的朋友、老師、同事等，顯示他一直推廣大灣區創業，有社工亦指他為弱勢社群和年輕人轉介工作，其性格並非突然改變。惟李運騰再指，法庭已裁定彭有意圖顛覆國家政權，求情信呈現彭不同的形象、與裁決相違，質疑可給予多少比重；又指串謀歷時不短，即使辯方指彭一時誤入歧途，法庭也難以被說服。盧指她完全接納法庭裁決，求情信是顯示彭犯案與本性不符。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指彭具持續愛國聯繫-官明言難以接納&quot;&gt;辯方指彭具持續愛國聯繫 官明言難以接納&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續主動引述，盧在書面陳詞形容彭「有持續的愛國聯繫，具能力和熱情服務國家（continuous patriotic affiliation and his ability and enthusiasm to serve the state in Hong Kong）」，李運騰指似乎是描述一個與初選時完全不同的彭卓棋，與法庭所見完全不同。盧指，涉案言行已經作出，它們全部屬錯誤。李運騰即問：「如果他犯案與本性不符，那你最好告訴我們，他當時為何說出那些話、做出那些事？」盧敏儀回應指彭有「服務的抱負」，李運騰反問：「服務誰？服務他自己？」盧指是服務香港和國家，惟李再指：「很坦白地說，我們很難接受。」盧同意，但指「我不能扭曲我所理解的」，李再笑着反問：「你是在說我們扭曲證據嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;盧重申，求情信反映彭的真實性格，望法庭考慮彭任區議員所參與的公共服務，及他推廣大灣區創業，被捕後又參與維護國家安全、推廣一國兩制和《基本法》而減刑。法官李運騰最後指，能看出盧非常盡力幫助被告，盧則重申，無論是書面或口頭陳詞的每個字都是真誠，望法庭考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，彭卓棋和梁晃維向旁聽席揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。袁嘉蔚由資深大律師祁志代表，梁晃維由資深大律師彭耀鴻代表，鄭達鴻由資深大律師潘熙、大律師黃宇逸代表，徐子見由大律師黃雅斌代表，楊雪盈由大律師張耀良代表，彭卓棋由大律師盧敏儀代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今日（2日）開始處理第二批被告、6名港島初選參與者的求情，包括認罪的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、徐子見，及受審後罪成的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈及彭卓棋，預計需時2天。不少被告的朋友到庭旁聽，其中梁晃維中學班主任讚揚梁秉承中學校訓「修己善群」，「無論認唔認罪都好，歷史都會判佢無罪」；楊雪盈友人指楊是十分願意協助的區議員，望傳承她的精神；徐子見友人讚揚他是「好有心嘅議員」，望讓他知道「我哋仲存在」，「我哋仲 support 緊佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 《獨媒》記者今早約6時到達西九龍裁判法院，法庭門外已有逾50名市民排隊等候，當中有約40名市民戴帽、口罩和耳機等，部分背對行人路和低頭而坐，記者上前問何時到達、旁聽什麼案件均沒有回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;排頭位的是法庭旁聽常客「姨婆」，她與姨甥孫於昨晚10時30分已到達法院門外。早前涉「小彤群抽會」煽動案被捕的李盈姿昨晚現身銅鑼灣，今早則約清晨4時到達西九龍法院外，她向記者指今日6名求情被告都相當年青，認為各被告均無做錯，並稱：「香港人仲係撐佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁晃維中學班主任梁秉承中學校訓修己善群&quot;&gt;梁晃維中學班主任：梁秉承中學校訓「修己善群」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;現年約50歲的前教師林先生，在清晨約3時已經到達法院外位置。林先生稱過去多年一直有留意社運發展，「去到呢個時刻都會撐佢哋。」他續向記者指，梁晃維就讀伊利沙伯中學時，自己曾任其班主任，笑言：「最初佢好純㗎，後來無諗到佢咁勇」，他大讚梁讀書時期成績優異，秉承伊利沙伯中學「修己善群」校訓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;多名被告還柙超過三年「未判先審」，林先生不時都會到荔枝角收押所探望對方，他指梁晃維現時精神狀態不錯。他最後再道，梁由被補到審訊，已達成其自己的目標，「無論認唔認罪都好，歷史都會判佢無罪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊雪盈友人會傳承佢嘅精神&quot;&gt;楊雪盈友人：會傳承佢嘅精神&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G小姐（化名）向《獨媒》表示，為了支持被告之一楊雪盈，今早約7時到達法院排隊。G小姐稱，自己於2017年一次遊行中認識楊雪盈，稱當時有社區規劃上問題，並指「好多人接觸過自己社區嘅區議員，都係完全問唔到」。正當無從入手之際，便「膽粗粗」向楊詢問意見，而楊亦願意和十分落力協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eACTcMZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ G小姐&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G小姐續指，每逢旁聽該案時都會穿着綠色衫，今日亦特意身穿綠色連身長裙，「因為佢（楊雪盈）話如果支持佢就着綠色衫啦。」楊雪盈還柙逾一個月，她就對楊身體狀況表示憂慮，擔心其身體會逐漸瘦弱，「好擔心佢愈來愈瘦，因為佢本身都好瘦㗎喇。」被問到有什麼說話向楊雪盈說，她就稱：「我會繼續喺我嘅崗位努力，傳承佢嘅精神。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;徐子見友人我哋仲存在&quot;&gt;徐子見友人：我哋仲存在&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前東區區議員徐子見的朋友蘋果（化名），今特意乘頭班車前來旁聽，約7時許到達。她表示於2014年雨傘運動期間認識徐子見，認為徐是「好落力、好畀心機做好區務嘅一個區議員」，即使其他區的市民找他幫忙，也會落手落腳努力做好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;蘋果坦言，對徐子見因參選而被捕有點可惜，但認為以現在時勢，即使他當時無參加初選，「都做唔到啲乜嘢」，故不會太過感慨，因「始終係佢嘅選擇」。徐子見選擇認罪，首提堂起還柙至今逾3年4個月，蘋果說有不時探望徐，形容他精神和身體狀態也不錯，今天到場是希望「show 吓我嘅存在畀佢睇，我哋仲 support 緊佢」、「我哋仲存在」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;某被告藝術班學生到場支持-稱其開朗正面&quot;&gt;某被告藝術班學生到場支持 稱其開朗正面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中一名被告的藝術班學生阿輝，今早6時半到法庭外排隊，他稱讚該名被告為人正面、開朗，不時鼓勵學生。阿輝續向《獨媒》表示，今日希望到場支持47人，他對案件橫跨數年感到無奈，多名被告還柙已久仍未有判決，故今日希望到場旁聽，令被告知道仍然有人支持自己，「其實都無了期咁樣好似咁，又冇咩可以做到，唯一可以做到就係精神上支持佢哋，嚟到都希望畀佢見到我哋，咁佢都知道我哋仍然支持佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，共45人罪成，今（2日）開始處理第二批被告、6名港島初選參與者的求情，包括認罪的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、徐子見，及受審後罪成的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈及彭卓棋，預計需時2天。代表袁嘉蔚的資深大律師祁志先進行求情，他認為顛覆罪的刑期分級制不適用於本案，而涉案謀劃「天真」、「註定失敗」，法庭不應基於猜測的嚴重後果、而應按被告實際參與判刑，而袁在報名參選後已被DQ，謀劃對國安造成很少甚至沒有危害。祁志又形容，袁是有理想的年輕女子，一生為人善良，對社會有抱負，並透露袁嘉蔚最近在獄中與另一人結婚，望及早服刑完畢，開始組織家庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被告精神不俗-由6懲教看守&quot;&gt;被告精神不俗 由6懲教看守&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。袁嘉蔚由資深大律師祁志代表，梁晃維由資深大律師彭耀鴻代表，鄭達鴻由資深大律師潘熙、大律師黃宇逸代表，徐子見由大律師黃雅斌代表，楊雪盈由大律師張耀良代表，彭卓棋由大律師盧敏儀代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於約10時步入法庭，此前獲保釋、罪成後須還柙的3人，鄭達鴻身穿深灰色西裝，較裁決日略為消瘦，精神不俗，微笑向律師和旁聽席揮手。啡色頭髮的楊雪盈紮髻，穿淺綠色背心連身裙、米白色通花外套，向旁聽席飛吻和微笑。在裁決日剷了光頭的彭卓棋，頭髮長了少許，身穿白色上衣、深藍色西裝外套，拉下口罩與旁聽席說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於已還柙至今逾3年4個月的另外3人，梁晃維戴黑框眼鏡，穿灰色西裝外套、繫黑白斜紋間條領帶。頭髮灰白的徐子見戴口罩，穿白色長袖裇衫，向旁聽席揮手，不時摸頭髮，又做OK手勢。袁嘉蔚則戴黑框眼鏡、穿黑色連身裙，束劉海和綁馬尾，早休後披上淺啡色外套。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;與戴耀廷5人求情時由約10名懲教人員分隔、各被告分坐在被告欄不同位置不同，今只有6名懲教在被告欄內，男女被告分成上下兩排就坐，梁晃維、鄭達鴻和彭卓棋之間更沒有懲教相隔。前立法會議員邵家臻、前東區區議員韋少力、大律師吳靄儀等都有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;罪成被告則分成兩個延伸庭觀看直播，二號法庭為吳敏兒、黃碧雲、余慧明和黃子悅4人，一號法庭為黃之鋒、劉頴匡、譚凱邦、馮達浚、施德來、伍健偉、吳政亨7人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方若考慮刑期分級制判刑為走後門&quot;&gt;辯方：若考慮刑期分級制判刑為「走後門」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表袁嘉蔚的資深大律師祁志先陳詞。與戴耀廷一方一樣，祁志認為本案是以串謀罪、而非國安法控罪定罪，認為顛覆罪的刑期分級制並不適用，法庭判刑時應以普通法原則，根據《刑事罪行條例》第159C條，按被告參與程度、罪行嚴重性判刑。法官陳仲衡和李運騰提及，即使分級制不適用，也可用作參考，惟祁志指，若判刑時考慮不適用的成文法例是「走後門」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方謀劃註定失敗-法庭不應基於猜測後果判刑&quot;&gt;辯方：謀劃註定失敗 法庭不應基於猜測後果判刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志續指，涉案謀劃本質上有缺陷（essentially flawed）、註定失敗（doomed to fail），政府或會DQ被告，而被告能否否決預算案，取決於立法會選舉結果，被告除地區直選外，亦須在功能組別取得大多數。即使他們成功否決預算案，選民會否再次投選同一人、被告會否履行承諾，均屬未知數（uncertainty）。祁志認為，法庭不應基於猜測（speculation）、假設性和不能證明會發生的嚴重後果判刑，而只應基於被告實際參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iRtb9qT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 袁嘉蔚（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉一度指，但戴耀廷不是這樣想，他相信他的計劃會成功。惟祁志反問，「戴耀廷被證明錯過多少次？」，重申法庭不能肯定謀劃會成功，若法庭以戴耀廷的想法、而非袁嘉蔚的參與及真誠相信謀劃是合法來判刑，那不可能是正確。祁志又引馬俊文和呂世瑜案，指判刑時須考慮實際後果、潛在風險和影響，惟政府最終延後選舉，本案謀劃沒有發生，只有很少實際的破壞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志又指，本案涉及以合法手段否決預算案，被告行為在《國安法》前屬合法，法庭判刑時不應考慮；而在《國安法》後，袁嘉蔚報名參選後也被DQ，涉案串謀短暫，只歷時29日，對國家安全只有很少甚至沒有危害。法官李運騰指，但被告有想好DQ的應對計劃，祁志則形容，計劃「天真」，強調本案並非「令人髮指（heinous）」的罪行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方本案行為屬顛覆罪最輕微&quot;&gt;辯方：本案行為屬顛覆罪最輕微&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志續引《國安法》第22條，指顛覆罪下列明4項顛覆行為，除本案所涉的「嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能」，還包括推翻和破壞中國憲法所確立的中國根本制度、推翻中央或香港特區政權機關，以及攻擊、破壞特區政權機關履職場所及設施，致使其無法正常履行職能。祁志認為，相較之下，本案所涉行為是4種行為之中罪責最輕微，因不涉中國根本制度及實際攻擊致政權機關「無法正常履行職能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就袁嘉蔚的罪責，祁志指袁的參與程度較低，她曾參加選舉論壇，望參選取得合法權力，但其後已被DQ，沒有重犯機會。祁志又指，《國安法》目的在防範和制止危害國安罪行，而本案法律程序已帶出阻嚇訊息，本港已感受到《國安法》的影響；考慮到袁已還柙3年半，法庭判刑時可寬大處理、施以仁慈，給予被告個人背景求情因素更多比重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方袁一生為人善良對社會有抱負&quot;&gt;辯方：袁一生為人善良、對社會有抱負&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就袁的個人背景，祁志形容袁是一名有理想的年輕女子（idealistic young woman），正如本案不少被告出身中產或勞工階層，並努力令自己變得更好，他們是「我們的同事，我們的孩子，我們的大人，我們的人民」，並非一般罪犯，他們相信其行為是合法。祁志續指，袁畢業於城大，主修中文及歷史，其後到南區的田灣做社區工作和任區議員，她一生一直都是善良的人，樂於助人，在獄中更因善良而惹上麻煩，而她對社會的抱負和善良的「回報」，卻可能是4至5年刑期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方披露袁最近獄中與另一人結婚&quot;&gt;辯方披露袁最近獄中與另一人結婚&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;祁志續提到，袁的人生因為被還柙而被改寫，如今「正在更生（rehabilitation）的路上」，若再判更重的刑期會毀掉她的更生進度。祁志又指，袁最近在獄中與另一人結婚，袁不希望在庭上披露男方的身份，但二人希望及早服刑完畢，開始組織家庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/20bICcX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，共45人罪成，今（2日）開始處理第二批被告、6名港島初選參與者的求情，包括認罪的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、徐子見，及受審後罪成的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈及彭卓棋。代表梁晃維的資深大律師彭耀鴻指，梁屬「積極參加者」且參與有限，他犯案是出於好意，望以合法手段令特首回應民意。辯方庭上讀出梁晃維親撰的求情信節錄，梁提及生於九七一代如「被詛咒的孩子」，每個人生新階段都會遇上香港的重大事件，如沙士、雨傘運動、反修例運動和疫情，深感與香港同悲同喜、命運緊緊相連。梁又指，香港自2019年面對困境，許多人感到迷失，「但我從來沒有對香港或香港人失去信心」，憑着對這片土地的熱愛，及前人承傳下來的精神，他相信香港定能繼續逆風而行，且「只要我還活着，締造更美好的香港永遠都會是我的終生抱負」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方墨落於國安法前發起-僅重申已達成共識&quot;&gt;辯方：「墨落」於國安法前發起 僅重申已達成共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;袁嘉蔚一方今早完成求情後，由梁晃維及鄭達鴻一方陳詞。代表梁晃維的資深大律師彭耀鴻表示，梁晃維是「墨落無悔」聲明書發起人之一，但聲明於《國安法》生效前發布，只是重申已達成的共識，法庭不應考慮。法官陳慶偉指，聲明雖於《國安法》生效前發起，但其後沒有撤回。彭同意，但指那沒有加重太多梁的參與。陳慶偉又向彭確認，梁曾出席抗爭派記者會，指會將此納入考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 左起：袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、鄭達鴻（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方梁晃維為積極參加者-但國安法後參與有限&quot;&gt;辯方：梁晃維為「積極參加者」 但國安法後參與有限&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭續指，梁晃維被DQ後，沒有再找 Plan B，亦表明不會這樣做。法官陳慶偉問有何證據，法官陳仲衡則指，梁曾解釋不找 Plan B 的原因，是因難以找到有共同政治理念又沒有觸及「紅線」的候選人，指不是他不想，而是他找不到 Plan B。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭續指，梁並非「首要分子」，他沒有組織或計劃涉案謀劃，只是參與者。辯方同意梁是「積極參加者」（量刑為3至10年），但強調他在《國安法》後的行為非常有限，只曾出席競選街站、出席抗爭派記者會等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指梁晃維誤信計劃合法-官質疑&quot;&gt;辯方指梁晃維誤信計劃合法 官質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭耀鴻續強調，梁晃維並非蓄意不尊重法律。法官陳慶偉打斷指，但梁晃維認為戴耀廷太過溫和，因此才發起「墨落無悔」；又質疑梁並非因對法律無知而犯案，梁與袁嘉蔚的情況有點不同，梁比袁做得更多。法官李運騰則舉例，有部分候選人或對法律無知，真誠相信戴耀廷稱計劃合法；但有其他候選人或是頑固的激進或極端分子（diehard radicals or extremists），無論《國安法》有否落實也會繼續，並公然違抗法律。李指針對後者，對法律無知並非求情因素。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 袁嘉蔚（左）、梁晃維（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭同意，但引述梁晃維曾稱，「無論我哋係對政府嘅提案定財政預算案投下反對票，呢個都係我哋作為代議士一個合法嘅權利，唔代表佢係一個非法嘅初選」，指梁當時相信否決是合法。惟法官陳慶偉搖頭，指辯方說法須有更多證據支持。彭重申，梁當時相信所做的是正確，望法庭定下量刑起點時考慮本案嚴重性，即謀劃原本設計是使用合法手段，非公然違法，及被告對法律無知；其後再考慮梁及時認罪，給予三分一扣減。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方梁具良好動機-望以合法手段令特首更聽民意&quot;&gt;辯方：梁具良好動機 望以合法手段令特首更聽民意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於梁晃維的個人背景，彭耀鴻指，梁不僅沒有案底，而且根據其家人、相識的人所撰的求情，他是一個有愛心的年輕人，會照顧流浪動物，而從他在大學學生會、區議員等參與，可見他真誠承諾服務社區。彭又指，本案顛覆非常獨特，被告犯案非為個人私利，而是出於良好動機，尋求以他們認為合法的手段帶來改變，令特首更加回應民意；謀劃極不可能成功，但他們不是要破壞，而是望爭取好的結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭續引述梁的求情信，他明白自己作出違法行為，須承擔責任，而他在過去數年反省，承認案發時部分言行不成熟，對很多人造成傷害，望就此道歉。梁又指，自首提堂後還柙的3年間，他嘗試適應獄中生活，學會處理孤獨，並於獄中度過24至27歲生日，自言感到「迷惘」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;梁晃維求情信從未失對港人信心相信香港能逆風而行&quot;&gt;梁晃維求情信：從未失對港人信心、相信香港能逆風而行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭最後讀出梁求情信最後兩段，梁提到參選立法會時使用「休戚與共，長風破浪」為口號，這並非適合用於遊行集會的感性口號，而是結合他個人對香港的感受和抱負。梁提到，自己在香港主權移交那年出生，他那一代人常被戲稱為「被詛咒的孩子（the cursed children）」，每逢踏入人生新階段都會遇上香港大事——幼稚園畢業遇上「沙士」、小學畢業時是豬流感、中學畢業遇上雨傘運動、大學畢業又遇上反修例運動和疫情，梁自言在與香港同悲同喜的同時，「我深感我的命運與香港緊緊相連。」（“I deeply feel that my fate is deeply tied with Hong Kong.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁指，香港是他成長的地方，是他各種經歷的舞台、是他珍視的價值的搖籃，「我發現我無法輕易切斷與香港的連繫，也無法容忍作為旁觀者。」梁續指，無論未來的人生如何，「我會繼續與香港休戚與共」，為其成功喝采、為其衰落沮喪。梁又指，2019年以來，香港面對複雜和困難的處境，許多人對這個城市的未來感到迷失，「然而，我從來沒有對香港或香港人失去信心。」梁最後指，「憑我們對這片土地的熱愛，以及前人所承傳下來的精神，我相信香港能繼續逆風而行，克服當前挑戰和未知困難。只要我還活着，締造更美好的香港永遠都會是我的終生抱負。」（“As long as I am alive, building a better Hong Kong will always be my lifelong aspiration.”）（梁求情信節錄見文末）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁晃維一方早上完成求情，梁表現平靜，散庭時向旁聽席揮手，又做心形和OK手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年立法會選舉中，我用了「休戚與共，長風破浪」作為口號，這並非適合用於遊行集會的感性口號，而是結合我個人對香港的感受和抱負。作為生於香港主權移交那年的人，我這一代人常被戲稱為「被詛咒的孩子」，每逢我們踏入人生新階段，香港都會面對疫情或重大事件——幼稚園畢業遇上「沙士」、小學畢業時是「豬流感」、中學畢業遇上雨傘運動、大學畢業又遇上反修例運動和世紀疫情。在與香港同悲同喜的過程中，我深深感覺到我的命運與香港緊緊相連。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;香港是我成長的地方，是我各種經歷的舞台、是我珍視的價值的搖籃。我發現我無法輕易切斷與香港的連繫，也無法容忍作為一名旁觀者。無論我將來的人生如何，我會繼續與香港休戚與共——為其成功喝采、為其衰落沮喪。2019年以來，香港面對複雜和困難的處境，許多人對我城的未來感到迷失，然而，我從來沒有對香港或香港人失去信心。憑藉我們對這片土地的熱愛，以及前人所承傳下來的精神，我相信香港能繼續逆風而行，克服當前挑戰和其他未知困難。只要我還活着，締造更美好的香港永遠都會是我的終生抱負。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2020 Legislative Council election, I used the slogan “sharing weal and woe, braving the winds and tides”. It is not an emotional slogan fit for chanting at rallies or marches. It combines my personal feelings and aspirations for Hong Kong. As someone born in the year of the handover, our generation is often humorously referred to as the “cursed children.” Every time we stepped into a new stage of life, Hong Kong was hit by an epidemic or some significant events - SARS at kindergarten graduation; swine flu at primary school graduation; the Umbrella Movement in high school; when we entered into society after graduating from university, there were the anti-extradition movement and the pandemic of the century. In this process of sharing Hong Kong’s joy and grief, I deeply feel that my fate is tightly linked with Hong Kong’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong is where I grew up; it’s the stage for all kinds of experiences and the cradle of values that I hold dear. I realise that I cannot easily sever ties with Hong Kong nor tolerate being a bystander here. No matter what kind of life I live in the future, I will continue to share weal and woe with Hong Kong - cheering for its successes and feeling downcast about its decline. Since 2019, Hong Kong has been facing complex and difficult situations, many people feel lost about our city’s future. However, I have never lost faith in Hong Kong or its people. With our love for this land and the spirit inherited from our predecessors, I believe Hong Kong will be able to brave the strong winds, overcoming current challenges and other unknown difficulties. As long as I am alive, building a better Hong Kong will always be my lifelong aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，今（2日）處理第二批被告、6名港島初選參與者的求情，包括認罪的袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、徐子見，及受審後罪成的鄭達鴻、楊雪盈及彭卓棋。就鄭達鴻、徐子見及楊雪盈3人，辯方指他們案中參與程度低，應歸為「其他參加者」，判監3年以下。其中楊雪盈一方呈上32封求情信，讚揚她對社區和藝術文化的貢獻等；楊又親撰求情信，自言無黨無派，誤信初選合法才參加，誤墮法網「實在愚蠢」。辯方指楊毫不激進，有良好動機，參選只望令社區變得更好，望法庭以「新角度」審視，惟法官陳慶偉一度質疑辯方是指楊不應被定罪、反映楊沒有悔意，又指辯方似是上訴而非求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;徐子見一方透露其父親在他還柙期間離世，徐並親撰求情信稱明白罪行嚴重性，望對受影響的人深切道歉。鄭達鴻一方則指他只是跟從黨立場，他參選後已被DQ，其後宣布退黨、自願停用社交媒體、無再參與政治事務，他誤信初選合法才犯案，沒有重犯機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方楊雪盈屬其他參加者-呈藝文界等32封求情信&quot;&gt;辯方：楊雪盈屬「其他參加者」 呈藝文界等32封求情信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;袁嘉蔚及梁晃維一方完成求情後，由鄭達鴻、徐子見及楊雪盈一方陳詞。辯方認為三人均屬「其他參加者」，量刑起點不應超過3年。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表楊雪盈的大律師張耀良，認為楊屬罪責最低的參與者之一，為「其他參加者」；又指雖然法官裁決時依賴從楊搜得的文件將她定罪，但該些文件尚未發布，仍有機會修改，沒有進一步證據顯示她屬「積極參與」。張呈上32封求情信，來自楊本人、家人、朋友、同事、街坊，亦包括前南區區議會副主席司馬文、香港戲劇協會會長馮祿德、藝術發展局前委員張秉權等，顯示楊的多個面向，包括樂善好施、熱心文藝、服務社區，亦參與動物保護、文化保育、表演藝術等，當中沒有一封求情信形容楊是「政客」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中司馬文表示2015年認識楊，二人理念一致，認為不是要推翻而是要加強管治，並望改善香港生活質素，尤其是城市規劃和環保方面。司馬文又形容，楊為溫和民主派，對她的熱情、願意學習維繫社區關係的經驗感到印象深刻，二人任區議員時曾在環境保育等合作。張秉權則指楊本性和善、絕不好鬥，只是跟隨當時的時勢而行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良又引述求情信，指許多人曾受過楊的幫助，例如楊曾邀請單親家長與孩子到她家暫住、給予新移民金錢援助，又曾幫助其他人照顧寵物。有大坑街坊則提到，曾看過很多區議員當選後失蹤，但楊當選後情況改變，讚揚楊全心服務社區，不為政治利益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;楊撰求情信稱以為初選合法-愚蠢誤墮法網&quot;&gt;楊撰求情信稱以為初選合法 愚蠢誤墮法網&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良強調，楊雪盈毫不激進、沒有政治聯繫，她對政府不關心她所關注的議題感不滿，相信如能當選立法會議員，便能有助推動她所提倡的政策，這也是她參與初選的唯一原因。張又指，雖然楊被搜得的文件提及否決預算案，但她與其他人有不同的議程，是望令社區變得更好，望法庭能將她與其他人區分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6jyIwmv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
▲ 楊雪盈（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張續引述楊所撰的求情信，楊自言出身基層，在香港土生土長，熱愛社會服務、醉心文藝，2015年以此為志當選區議員，得到機會服務弱勢社群、推動動物和文化保育等，形容為社會貢獻是她一生夢寐以求的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊又認為，可就社區問題與政府磋商，落實更好方案，舉例曾成功推動活化閒置用地擴建動物拯救中心、保留香港唯一龍窯「青山龍窯」、改變工廈用途讓藝術家進駐等，均證明政府樂意接受她的意見，是對社會有正面效益的溫和路線。楊自言，自己一直無黨無派，默默為社區貢獻，沒有參與激烈政治行為，參選單純望將上述議題和初心帶去立法會跟進。楊又指，一直以為初選無牴觸《國安法》才愚昧加入，當時新法剛實施，她對法例了解不足，誤墮法網，「現在想來實在愚蠢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方望法庭以新角度審視-官質疑無悔意拒納無意圖傷害政權&quot;&gt;辯方望法庭以新角度審視 官質疑無悔意、拒納無意圖傷害政權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張耀良續指，望法庭聽取求情後，能以一個新角度（new light）審視楊的案情。法官陳慶偉問何謂「新角度」，法官李運騰亦指「我們不能違反我們的事實裁斷」，張解釋是指楊參選立法會，只是望推動其社會政治議程。法官陳仲衡續指已裁定楊具犯案意圖，法官陳慶偉則問，「你是說你的當事人不應被裁定有罪嗎？」，張否認，指他是作求情陳詞。惟陳慶偉即高聲指：「對我來說，你似乎不是在求情，而是提出上訴理據」。張澄清，楊是有良好動機，但採用了錯誤的方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後再次質疑，根據辯方陳詞，楊雪盈是否對其行為沒有悔意（not sorry for what she did）？張耀良回應指她在求情信已表示對發生的事感抱歉，惟陳慶偉再質疑那並非反映她有悔意（remorse）。張再稱，楊在求情信已表達得很清楚，惟陳再反駁，楊表達得很清楚是一回事，「但你的求情似乎是往相反的方向作出」，「她的求情很清楚，但對我來說，你似乎並不接受！」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰最終問及，辯方求情重點，是否為她有良好品格、出色的公共服務、出於良好動機犯案，張耀良確認。法官陳仲衡並補充，法庭不會接納楊自言「我從不曾意圖傷害政權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方鄭達鴻屬其他參加者被dq後退黨&quot;&gt;辯方：鄭達鴻屬「其他參加者」、被DQ後退黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄭達鴻的資深大律師潘熙指，本案罪行嚴重，但鄭的角色相對輕微，他只是跟從公民黨立場，曾在討論謀劃的階段表達不同意，《國安法》生效後修改政綱，報名參選後亦被DQ，其後沒有再參與「35+計劃」，在串謀再沒有角色。潘又指，鄭於2020年12月發文宣布退黨，不再參與政治；而涉案謀劃不涉武力或威脅使用武力，最終也沒有實現，無對政權造成實際傷害，鄭屬「其他參加者」，應判監3年以下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7scp8fN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄭達鴻（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又形容，鄭一直希望成為立法會議員，他參與涉案謀劃並非為個人私利，而是望服務公眾及改善基層生活。不過法官李運騰指，若被告是為私利犯案，或屬加刑因素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方任多年區議員-參選望改善基層生活&quot;&gt;辯方：任多年區議員 參選望改善基層生活&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就鄭的個人背景，潘熙表示鄭達鴻現年36歲，他曾修讀法律博士（JD）和法學專業證書（PCLL），望幫助街坊，並曾任8年丹拿區議員，望法庭考慮他曾參與多年公共服務，具正面良好品格而減刑。潘熙又呈上7封求情信，來自鄭本人、家人、朋友、支持者等，鄭求情信解釋其心路歷程，提到被捕後沒有再使用社交媒體，也沒有再向其他人發訊息。法官陳仲衡一度問，不能使用社交媒體是否其保釋條件，辯方否認，指其保釋條件僅包括不可發放危害國安的訊息，鄭是自願刪除FB專頁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方誤信計劃合法無重犯機會&quot;&gt;辯方：誤信計劃合法、無重犯機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;潘又指，《國安法》是新的法律，雖然對法律無知不是辯護理由，但鄭曾供稱公民黨三度諮詢戴耀廷的意見，獲回覆稱初選合法，鄭亦曾自行研究《基本法》條文，湯家驊也受訪稱初選不違法。潘指法庭評估鄭的罪責時，應考慮他是因對《國安法》欠缺理解，誤信法律意見而犯案，而非刻意不遵從（willful disregard）。潘最後指，鄭沒有重犯的機會，他被捕後已辭任區議員、無再使用社交媒體和參與任何政治事務，望考慮他犯案時間短、誤信計劃合法等，給予這個年輕人一次機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KN0mBm9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方徐子見無政治聯繫-屬其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：徐子見無政治聯繫 屬「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表徐子見的大律師黃雅斌表示，根據《刑事罪行條例》第159C條串謀罪罰則，法庭有廣闊酌情權根據案情量刑。黃認為，徐屬「其他參加者」，並指串謀中部分參與者是知名人士，由強大的政黨支持，向其他人施壓參與初選，甚至有「三投三不投」運動，指候選人若不參與初選便是「懦夫」；惟徐是獨立候選人，無參與上述活動，其罪責屬最低。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方徐還柙期間父離世撰求情信致歉&quot;&gt;辯方：徐還柙期間父離世、撰求情信致歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續求情指，徐現年56歲，於香港出生和長大，他最近離婚，育有一名26歲兒子，其母親89歲，父親則於2023年、徐還柙期間離世。黃指，徐患有慢性病，引致嚴重痛楚，法官李運騰關注辯方是否指其病情會令徐服刑時承受更多苦楚，黃僅指其皮膚的狀況惡化，無披露更多詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續指，徐是政治素人，沒有任何政治聯繫，從沒有表達激進政治理念，於2014至2015年因健康和家庭出狀況才開始參政，服務社區令他找到人生意義。辯方呈上多封由街坊所撰的求情信，提到徐曾免費維修輪椅和電器、免費剪髮、探望露宿者和長者、為少數族裔義教中文、颱風後協助清除障礙物、處理鼠患等，疫情期間又響應政府呼籲，鼓勵長者接種疫苗。黃形容，徐是「行動派（a man of action）」、是聆聽者，而不只是空談理念的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rnz5cxW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image18&quot; /&gt;
▲ 徐子見（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃又引述徐子見親撰求情信，徐提到明白所犯罪行的嚴重性，自知不能逃避罪責，而他未能為社會作出貢獻，反而帶來極為負面的影響，望對受影響的人深切道歉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5名被告今完成求情，明早將由代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀進行求情。散庭時，梁晃維向旁聽席揮手，又雙手放頭做大心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More individuals and organisations in the UK and globally are becoming victims of ransomware. However, little is known about their experiences. This paper sheds light on the victim experience and identifies several key factors that typically shape such experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors are context-specific and can either improve or worsen the victim experience. They include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing of an incident&lt;/strong&gt;, which may happen after a victim has increased their cyber security measures or at an already stressful time for an organisation, such as the beginning of a school year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level of preparation&lt;/strong&gt; in the form of strong cyber security measures and contingency plans explicitly tailored to respond to a cyber incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human factors&lt;/strong&gt;, such as the workplace environment and pre-existing dynamics which are often reinforced during an incident. Good levels of unity can bring staff together during a moment of crisis, but a lack of leadership or a blame culture are likely to aggravate the harm experienced during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engagement with third-party service providers&lt;/strong&gt;, such as those providing technical incident response or legal services, can alleviate the negative aspects of the victim experience by providing critical legal, technical or other help. However, they may aggravate the harm by providing poor services or losing valuable time in responding to the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A successful &lt;strong&gt;communications campaign&lt;/strong&gt; is highly context and victim specific. It must include external and internal communications with staff members not part of the immediate response to ensure a good workplace culture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For support, many victims turn to public sector institutions such as law enforcement. Expectations for technical support and expertise from law enforcement are generally low, but victims feel especially unsupported where phone calls are not returned and there is no engagement or feedback loop. The National Cyber Security Centre enjoys a better reputation. However, there is widespread uncertainty about its role and the thresholds that must be met for it to provide support. This poses a reputational risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how ransomware attacks are personally felt by victims and what factors aggravate or alleviate the harm they experience is key for policymakers seeking to implement measures to minimise harm as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary-of-recommendations&quot;&gt;Summary of Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While ransomware causes many kinds of harm, mitigating the psychological impact of ransomware attacks needs to be at the centre of the support given to (potential) victims preparing for and responding to a ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Third-party service providers also need to recognise that efforts mitigating the psychological impact of ransomware attacks are critical to improving victims’ experience. They must therefore form part of their technical, legal or other services.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Public policy on ransomware must centre on measures that mitigate victims’ harm. This includes acknowledging and mitigating the psychological impact on victims, for example through counselling, compensation or time off in lieu.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Victims should aim for the right balance of discretion and transparency within their external and internal communications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Third-party service providers should actively enable information sharing, subject to the consent of parties, among past, current and potential victims through their networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Law enforcement and intelligence agencies should establish a positive feedback loop that shares success stories and notifies victims when the information they share has been successfully used for intelligence and law enforcement activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Government authorities need to clarify the tasks of relevant public institutions and their role in the ransomware response, including who can receive support and under what circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given year-on-year increases in the frequency of incidents, the resourcing of the Information Commissioner’s Office should be routinely assessed to enable timely assessments of ransomware breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When staff at Hackney Council encountered outages of its IT systems in October 2020, it quickly became evident that the council was facing a cyber attack. But the employees did not know that they would be dealing with its effects for years. Those who experience a ransomware attack experience a crisis, possibly even an existential threat for an attacked organisation and its staff. For those involved, it represents a low point in their professional and possibly even private lives, with consequences that are felt far beyond the immediate response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Hackney Council, staff members had to improvise while their access to data and technology was disrupted, working long hours to compensate for the technical problems. Meanwhile, more than 250,000 residents living in the borough faced disruptions and delays to critical council services, including housing benefits, social care, council tax and business rates. Years after the incident, the repercussions were still being felt. These insights are based on unusually detailed public reporting of the aftermath of Hackney Council’s ransomware incident. However, they still provide few details on the actual victim experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff and residents of Hackney Council are, of course, not the only ones affected by ransomware attacks. Ransomware criminals continue to target businesses of all sizes, as well as schools, healthcare providers, universities, charities and government entities. Prominent examples of 2023 ransomware victims in the UK include Royal Mail, an NHS trust and the outsourcing firm Capita, which handles the British Army’s recruitment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the mid-2010s, ransomware has emerged as one of the most harmful forms of cyber-criminal activity for organisations. Ransomware operators encrypt files or systems, demanding a ransom payment in return for a private key to decrypt the affected data. Increasingly, ransomware operators also exfiltrate victims’ data and threaten to leak it on the darknet unless a ransom is paid. For an organisation and its employees this can be an extremely stressful, high-pressure incident that causes a wide range of harm to individuals, organisations and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although more individuals and organisations are becoming victims of ransomware attacks, little is known about the victim experience. Reporting often focuses on financial implications or technical details. In contrast, this paper sheds light on how organisations and their staff experience a ransomware attack. It offers a particular focus on the specific factors that – for better or worse – influence this experience. These factors include: the scale and timing of the incident; the size of the victim organisation; the level of preparation undertaken by the victim organisation prior to the ransomware event; the nature of the existing workplace culture; and the experience of dealing with third parties that form part of the ransomware response ecosystem, including the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and law enforcement; the role of communication; and the role of transparency and information sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering such detailed insights into the victims’ experiences of a ransomware attack gives policymakers, cyber security professionals and practitioners in the ransomware response ecosystem key knowledge. This is pivotal when designing effective response plans and policy measures and conducting incident response. It is also essential for providing personalised support to any victims. The research findings for this paper also inform any organisation or individual preparing for a possible ransomware attack or other cyber incident of what challenges they might face and how they can prepare for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure&quot;&gt;Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is structured as follows. Chapter I draws findings from, and identifies research gaps in, existing research, reporting and data that build an understanding of the victim experience. Chapter II summarises the findings from the original research to identify the factors that influence the ransomware victim experience, including: the scale and timing of the incident; the size of the victim organisation; the level of preparation undertaken by the victim organisation prior to the ransomware event; the nature of the existing workplace culture; and the experience of dealing with third parties that form part of the ransomware response ecosystem. The third-party organisations included in the analysis are those that were seen as most significant by interviewees and workshop participants. These are lawyers, insurance providers, incident responders, ransom negotiators and public relations firms. Chapter III analyses the role of public sector bodies, including local and regional police, the NCSC, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The paper concludes with a range of policy recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is part of a series of research publications resulting from a 12-month research project, “Ransomware Harms and the Victim Experience”, conducted by RUSI and the University of Kent. The project is funded by the UK’s NCSC and the Research Institute for Sociotechnical Cyber Security. Its aim is to understand the wide range of harm caused by ransomware attacks to individuals, organisations and society at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research project focuses on the question: How is a ransomware attack experienced by victims, and what factors aggravate or reduce the negative experience(s)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collection and analysis for this paper entailed a literature review, semi-structured interviews and workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Literature Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project started with a literature review of publicly available sources on ransomware harm and ransomware victims. It included a non-systematic review of publicly available academic and grey literature, including surveys and reports produced by stakeholders of the ransomware ecosystem. The initial literature review was conducted in August and September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Semi-Structured Interviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary dataset for the paper is based on 42 semi-structured online interviews with both victims of ransomware attacks and subject-matter experts from across the ransomware ecosystem, including individuals from the insurance industry, government, law enforcement and incident responders. An overview of the background of interviewees is provided in Tables 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees from ransomware victim organisations included both IT and non-IT staff. The scope of the interviews included personnel at a ransomed organisation; the research team did not interview wider knock-on victims (for example, those in supply chains or clients). Non-victim interviewees were selected for their breadth and depth of experience that involved multiple ransomware incidents spanning several years. Interviewees were predominantly from the UK, although a limited number were based in the US or other countries in Western Europe. Interviews were conducted between November 2022 and March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All interview data was anonymised to allow individuals to speak openly about potentially sensitive issues. The research team then analysed the interview transcripts using a thematic analysis approach,which involved generating codes that reoccurred in interviews and identifying themes that provided insight into the research questions. The analysis was conducted using NVIVO. An anonymised coding system based on Tables 1 and 2 is used to refer to interview data in the footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workshops&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team conducted two online workshops with key stakeholders from the UK government, the insurance and cyber security industries, lawyers and law enforcement. They were held in November 2022 and February 2023. Attendees included a mix of interviewees and new participants, using contacts established during the interview phase. The first workshop was used for data gathering. The second workshop was used to validate the research findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research project has been based on a large data corpus, drawing on interviews with ransomware victims and stakeholders from the ecosystem who support ransomware victims. Data collection therefore relied on the voluntary participation of ransomware victims and their support ecosystem. Understandably, victims of ransomware are often hesitant or unwilling to speak of their experience. The authors note the possibility of some participatory selection bias; for instance, ransomware victim interviewees who were willing to voluntarily give up their time to speak to the research team may also have been more likely to reach out to law enforcement or report to the ICO. It is also possible that ransomware victims who were willing to describe their experiences in a voluntary research setting may also have been less likely to have paid a negotiated ransom. Additionally, the majority of interviewees were UK-based; it is possible that geographic and, especially, cultural contexts affect ransomware experiences. The findings from this research therefore cannot be said to represent a universal ransomware experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the findings of this project provide insights from a “snapshot” of the ransomware victim experience across a particular timeframe, with interviews ending in March 2023. As highlighted from this project’s data corpus, ransomware victims’ experiences are not the same; there is substantial variability that depends on internal and external factors. As ransomware is a dynamic threat that continues to evolve, it is important that researchers continue to engage with victims of ransomware to further build the understanding of how the experiences of future victims can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-existing-insights-on-the-ransomware-victim-experience&quot;&gt;I. Existing Insights on the Ransomware Victim Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each ransomware incident is unique, although collectively ransomware experiences have much in common. A ransomware attack will typically follow a set of stages involving an initial attempt to access an IT estate, a successful breach, followed by further access across the network. The attackers will then seek to gain greater privileges, identify their desired sections of the network, exfiltrate data (if they are exfiltrating) and deliver their encryption payload (if they are encrypting). The attackers will then typically either use a splash screen or otherwise make contact with the victim to encourage them to commence discussions about ransom payment. As a general timeline, once a ransomware victim notices that they have been breached and/or have been contacted by the ransomware operators, there generally follows an immediate crisis period – which could last days or weeks – during which they seek to contain the attackers’ access, restore core systems and assess what data may have been exfiltrated. During this time, the organisation may or may not be able to operate normal functions. This core crisis period is followed by a gradual or staggered transition to normal operations. Victims of ransomware will often draw on the support of a range of third-party services, including but not limited to: cyber insurers; incident responders; ransom negotiators; lawyers; public relations services; and law enforcement or national cyber authorities (such as the NCSC in the UK). The roles that these services can play in influencing the ransomware victim’s experiences are explored later in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some understanding of “typical” ransomware victim experiences can be acquired through news reports and existing analyses of mostly objective factors, such as the financial and temporal impact of an attack. A novel study by Nandita Pattnaik and others drew on public reporting relating to a range of ransomware incidents to identify the scale and depth of harms to the victim organisation(s). More broadly, media attention focuses on the scale and scope of contemporary criminal ransomware activity, and the significant disruption that can be caused to organisations. An example of a widely reported ransomware incident is the DarkSide attack against Colonial Pipeline, a US gas supplier, in May 2021. As a result of the incident, the company switched off its pipeline systems for six daysand reportedly paid the attackers $4.4 million. Other attacks may be more prolonged. In October 2020 in the UK, Hackney Council was attacked by the Pysa ransomware group, which encrypted systems and exfiltrated sensitive data. A range of the council’s services, including critical services such as housing benefit and social care services, were not fully operable for roughly a year. In October 2022, it was reported that the cost of Hackney Council’s recovery effort in the prior financial year exceeded £12 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports on ransomware attacks often depend on the information released either by a victim organisation or their legal representatives, or possibly the attackers themselves. For example, in January 2022 the British convenience food manufacturer, KP Snacks, was attacked by the Conti ransomware group. The attack became publicly known on 2 February, after the firm sent a letter to its distributors notifying them of a cyber attack. The Conti group darknet leak page shared examples of sensitive employee data – including birth certificates and credit card statements – and the group allegedly gave KP Snacks five days to pay a demanded ransom to prevent more proprietary data from being leaked. It is not clear what was the value of the ransom, whether it was paid, and how prolonged the impact within the company was. In such instances, insights into the victim experience are highly limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other reports have assessed a range of ransomware attacks in aggregation to quantify average ransomware impacts. Expense and downtime can be used as broad measures of victim harms and/or experience. For example, the most recent annual Sophos State of Ransomware report identified that the average ransom payment had reached more than $1.5 million (the median was $400,000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety-seven percent of victims were reportedly able to regain access to their data, with backups the most common recovery method (70%), while 46% of victims elected to pay the ransom for a decryption key. The average overall recovery cost for victim organisations was reported to be $1.82 million. Drawing on Kovrr’s cyber incident database, a 2022 report by Check Point Research identified that the average “attack duration” was 9.9 days in 2021. However, while providing valuable information, these statistics reduce the victim to an abstract number and statistical event and do not account for the deeply personal experience a victim goes through when their organisation has been affected by a ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide further insights into the victim experience beyond these initial metrics, academics and researchers conducted surveys and interviews with ransomware victims. This approach can enable more in-depth understanding and analysis of a given ransomware event. The ethical frameworks governing academic research may also provide assurances to ransomware victims, for example regarding anonymisation and data handling, which give the victims confidence to speak. This could include research into events that are not reported in-depth publicly. Leah Zhang-Kennedy and others focused on a ransomware incident at a US university, surveying 150 students and faculty members and interviewing 30 individuals to gain a range of perspectives about a single incident. Harry Harvey and others and Jane Y Zhao and others have conducted studies that have drawn insights from interviews with medical staff at healthcare organisations subject to ransomware, identifying the impact the incidents had on colleagues’ provision of care, and their emotional toll. A 2020 study by Lena Yuryna Connolly and others drew on original interviews with IT and security managers from 10 organisations to identify attack characteristics including ransom value and the nature of lost data. A study by the UK’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp;amp; Sport drew on interviews involving 10 victim organisations that had experienced a range of ransomware or non-ransomware cyber breaches – with two employees from each – to develop case studies, exploring each organisation’s context and the impact of their cyber breach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a rule of thumb, wider news reporting and annual summaries of ransomware attacks primarily focus on financial impacts or offer technical insights on how they were conducted. These are invaluable as a means of providing insight into the occurrence of ransomware and general trends and it is vital that journalists, private companies, governments and NGOs continue to publish frequently. However, the experiences of the individuals in the midst of the event are rarely discussed in reports and summaries. The interview-based research for this paper is an approach that can bring individuals and their experiences to the fore. Ransomware is a dynamic threat that has continued to change over time with, for example, new attack modalities, the emergence of ransomware-as-a-service and altered negotiation strategies. As such, academics, the wider public and policymakers must conduct further research to develop an understanding of the multi-faceted immediate, mid-term and long-term ransomware victim experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-factors-affecting-the-victim-experience&quot;&gt;II. Factors Affecting the Victim Experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaining new understanding of what it is like to experience a ransomware incident helps policymakers to design policy interventions. Such interventions can explicitly consider evidence that demonstrates where harm occurs as well as what can alleviate the negative aspects of such experiences. Understanding the victim experience is an essential requirement to design effective policy interventions that counter victims’ harm. This chapter illustrates what victims experience and what factors alleviate or elevate the harm caused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is structured around several key themes that impact the victim experience and that were identified based on the interview data and workshops: the scale and timing of the incident; the size of the victim organisation; the level of preparation undertaken by the victim organisation prior to the ransomware event; the nature of the existing workplace culture; the experience dealing with third parties; the role of communications; and the role of transparency and information sharing. Figure 1 illustrates how the various elements interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-scale-timing-and-context-of-the-incident&quot;&gt;The Scale, Timing and Context of the Incident&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The victim experience naturally depends on the scale and technical impact of the incident: the percentage and type of data encrypted, locked or exfiltrated might vary. A victim in the education sector, for example, found that all email servers and backups were encrypted but their database was not affected. Other interviewees experienced breaches that resulted in the encryption of core company systems, creating significant business interruption and organisation-wide disruption. The nature of the exfiltrated data may have a significant influence on the victim experience, especially where it involves the compromise of sensitive data. In other instances, the threat actors either did not exfiltrate data or siphone data that was of little material concern to the victim organisation. An interviewee from the education sector recalled their relief when the threat actors only threatened to release generic invoices rather than sensitive student data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HAQDo0e.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Factors Shaping the Ransomware Victim Experience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing of an incident further influences the damage to victims and their ability to successfully respond to the attack. Many cybercriminals are known to time their attacks to inflict the maximum harm on victims. This increases the pressure to pay ransoms. For example, an attacker may launch attacks against the education sector at the beginning of a term or during exam periods. Additionally, prominent ransomware criminals are typically located in different time zones from their victims, naturally facilitating “out-of-office attacks”. Several interviewees reported that they were made aware of a successful breach during the night or while on annual leave. A common, although not universal, perspective was that the first tangible signs of a spreading encryption payload were the takedown of monitored on-site health and safety systems, including fire alarms and CCTV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 pandemic substantially shaped the external context for many victims. Some interviewees found that pandemic-related IT and work-from-home practices had made them more resilient, as much data had been moved to the cloud and people were accustomed to remote working or learning. For an interviewee in local government, the pandemic tested skills that were similarly required in responding to the attack – it was therefore a useful point of reference. Others found that the pandemic and their ransomware incident had a cumulative negative impact on themselves or their colleagues. For example, for one victim, pandemic-related practices had already cost staff much energy and resources and the incident thus came at a time when “people were already [at] rock bottom in terms of morale and resilience”. New working patterns established during the pandemic also made one victim’s IT estate more vulnerable as many devices were no longer switched off regularly due to remote working and did not therefore automatically update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the timing of an incident may, or may not, also coincide with internal procedures – this has an impact on how harmful the experience is for victims. While it might seem odd to speak of an “ideally timed” ransomware incident, timing can reduce possible negative experiences. For example, several victims reported that their incidents hit just after they had made payroll. Had they been unable to pay their employees, the harm for those individuals as well as the victim organisation would have been greater. Another victim experienced fortunate timing as the attack hit them several months after the organisation had run cyber exercises that resulted in hiring experts trained in responding to cyber incidents. As noted above, others had recently moved their systems to the cloud, ensuring access after the ransomware breach, thus alleviating some of the harm. In other cases, victims felt that the timing of the ransomware incident was particularly bad, with their breach occurring at a time of low budgets or acutely low staff morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much an organisation depends on its IT infrastructure or how time-sensitive its business is may also influence the degree of harm and disruption that the organisation and/or its staff experience. Victims operating in acutely time-sensitive client-facing contexts may lose contracts if they are unable to resume operations within a matter of days. In such contexts, the high stakes of an acutely time-sensitive incident response elevate pressure on colleagues handling the response effort. On the other hand, other interviewees reported that they had the (relative) luxury of time in their recovery effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing, scale and context of the ransomware attack are therefore significant factors influencing the harm caused to and the fallout experienced by an organisation and its staff. Policymakers, business leaders and practitioners thus need to consider that while victims share similar experiences, individual circumstances and the extent of the attack heavily influence how much a victim is affected. These factors also contribute to how personally a ransomware incident is felt by its victims, a sentiment that was repeated throughout this research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;size-of-organisation&quot;&gt;Size of Organisation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of a company can also influence the extent of the impact in a ransomware attack. This has also been confirmed in other reports. While larger companies typically operate a more expansive IT estate – which may include layers of end-of-life software – such organisations are likely to offset associated risks through their access to greater cash reserves either to pay a ransom and/or afford third-party help. They might also have a designated IT team, incident responders or lawyers on retainer and generally have greater experience in crisis management. This makes larger companies more resilient and less dependent on publicly available resources and expertise. Smaller companies or sole traders, however, may lack designated IT staff, the resources or the experience to successfully manage a ransomware attack. As a result, a ransomware attack can be significant, if not existential to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are often more dependent on public resources and expertise. One interviewee who provides third-party services said that the impact on lives is particularly prevalent for very small business, for example where a couple are in business together and all their assets and income depend on that business. The interviewee found that “the existential threat for a business that’s much smaller is significant”. An interview with a micro-SME victim suggested that without the financial support and access to expertise provided through a cyber insurance policy, the firm would have ceased to trade and the business owner would have needed to sell their home. Additional pressure may arise for small business owners for whom their livelihoods and those of their employees are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While limited in its insights on small business owners, the interview data raises questions about the impact of a company’s size on the harm experienced by ransomware victims. This has also been addressed in public reports, such as the news reports on the ransomware attack against hospitality and casino giant MGM Resorts. Such reports have questioned whether the company was “too rich to ransomware”, arguing that the impact was lower because of its large size. In contrast, other studies underline the disproportionate effect that is felt by small business owners or sole traders who become ransomware victims. While individuals working in large or small organisations may experience similar harm, such as psychological, on an individual level organisational size matters in terms of the financial harm and potential existential risk an organisation faces. Policymakers must consider that, to limit the harm felt by ransomware victims, organisations of different sizes might require different types and levels of government support in responding to ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;level-of-preparation&quot;&gt;Level of Preparation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An organisation’s level of preparation prior to the incident is a significant factor determining the harm that a victim experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The existence and suitability of business continuity plans, for example, was repeatedly cited throughout the research project. The general assumption is that when an organisation has a “good resilience strategy, they can put in place a recovery process that would take days as opposed to weeks” and that such measures would allow them to resume services and thereby “minimise impact to the individual consumers”. While many interviewees stressed the importance of preparation to limit the harm ransomware attacks cause, this research project also found that many doubted the suitability of existing business continuity plans to respond to a ransomware attack. Business continuity plans for flooding or fire emergencies have little in common with those setting up response mechanisms to a ransomware or other cyber incident. As a victim in the education sector described: “people always have … business continuity plans … but actually they tend to go out of the window”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business continuity plans for incidents other than ransomware or IT outages often presume that IT systems, such as email, continue to function and can be used to facilitate the crisis response. In practice, however, it is often the case that “There is no email. There is no Excel. Think pencil. Think paper”. Another interviewee noted that for “traditional”, more routine crises, they would typically bring in contractors to resolve the issue and pay them through the invoicing system, which was no longer possible during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific preparation for a cyber incident, by pre-emptively increasing “resilience”, can help alleviate the harm victims experience. Business continuity plans need to be tailored, while retaining sufficient flexibility to adapt to variables such as the threat actor, attack modality, severity and scale of encryption or exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to prepare is by identifying essential systems for core organisational functionality. This guides the victim to set priorities for their incident response. A victim in the education sector, for example, stressed the importance of the student portals to enable students to study for exams. An incident responder recalled their experience of supporting a manufacturer, who insisted that their canteen facility must be restored as an urgent priority in the interests of maintaining staff morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to prepare is by running scenario tests, as undertaken by a victim in the engineering sector, who subsequently hired additional staff as a result of the exercise, whom they described as “absolutely critical” in the response to the ransomware incident the company experienced a few months later. A ransomware specialist mentioned pre-drafted communications and legal statements as a proactive way to successfully prepare for a ransomware attack. Several interviewees stressed that the ransomware business continuity documents themselves should be stored offline in analogue format to ensure access is possible following an encryption event. Policymakers and those trying to raise awareness and preparation levels among potential victims must thus continue to stress the importance of cyber-specific preparation that takes into account the unique features of a cyber incident instead of relying on generic contingency plans that are unsuitable in a digitalised context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific preparation for a cyber incident is tightly linked to the overall level of cyber hygiene and cyber awareness a victim organisation may have prior to the incident. As one interviewee from the technology sector pointed out, preparatory measures are “far more effective than just leaning in after the incident”. Particularly in the public sector, however, digitalisation has been a lengthy process. One victim described how in their institution they had to recover server-by-server as the integration between devices and data flows were “a nightmare”. Similarly, another victim from the education sector described how, at an earlier point, they used technology, but that they had “not paid enough attention to the kind of infrastructure and the security” that was needed. In hindsight, they said that they should not have been running old systems and ought to have allocated the budget “to do it properly”. However, this has financial implications. In the private sector, there are also examples of missing cyber security measures. An interviewee from the technology sector, for example, admitted that “probably there were things that we knew we should improve but because we were so busy we didn’t do them”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may include the availability and quality of backups, particularly ones that are offline. An external counsel described a situation where there are no viable backups as the “worst case”. They stressed that such a difficult situation may be business critical and lead victims to consider paying the ransom where attempts to recover the data from other sources are unsuccessful. Furthermore, good detection capabilities may enable a victim to identify the attack early and take measures to mitigate further harm or even disrupt the attacker. Such damage limitation can significantly reduce the severity of the overall incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a good awareness of the amount and kind of data an organisation stores helps it to react to the incident. One interviewee from law enforcement pointed out that many organisations do not “really realise how sensitive some of the data is that they hold”. They added that smaller organisations, as well as those from the public sector, are particularly impacted by ransomware attacks due to the type of data they hold. The interviewee gave an example of a law firm holding data on victims of sexual offences and people being accused of being sex offenders. As a consequence, “each individual person within that dataset became quite vulnerable quite quickly … because their names should never be released”. Similarly, an interviewee with third-party experience from the insurance sector found that unnecessarily holding a lot of personal data would be a factor that aggravates the victim experience, while good data management practices such as deleting data they no longer need or should not have can reduce that risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General cyber security hygiene, good data privacy practice and specific cyber incident preparation can alleviate the harm experienced. Policymakers and public institutions must continue to raise awareness of such measures, particularly for small and micro-enterprises. When determining budgets for often tightly resourced public service providers, policymakers must allocate a budget for digitalisation and modernisation that goes beyond purchasing new technological equipment and considers the implementation and continued evaluation and adaption of cyber security standards. This also means that it is necessary to invest in adequate training or hiring dedicated IT staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pre-existing-workplace-culture&quot;&gt;Pre-Existing Workplace Culture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview data highlights the importance of the pre-existing workplace culture in aggravating or limiting ransomware harm. A ransomware attack is likely to intensify existing sentiment within and between teams. As one interviewee stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the stronger [the] culture you have, the more coherent, the more resilient that business will be to something like this happening … whereas internally, if you already have a poor culture, you have people that are quite disgruntled, then for whatever those reasons might be, you’re particularly vulnerable to this having a disproportionate effect on morale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interviewee, from a local government organisation, confirmed that the attack “definitely exacerbated areas where there were tensions anyway”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interviewee went as far as stating that a good workplace culture has a greater impact on the ransomware victim experience than “a really well-prepared tech system”, as morale and culture cannot be replaced but may have a disproportionate impact on people’s resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decisive factor is the overall atmosphere and level of cooperation among co-workers. A victim in the education sector spoke of a “real good spirit” among the team in response to the attack: people even wanted to help and unexpectedly came into the office, bringing cookies and cake. In this example, the interviewee stated that the ransomware attack brought the team really “close to each other in the end” and such bonds have continued to benefit the team spirit. Similarly, another interviewee in the education sector referred to an experience that strengthened the ethos at work like a “wartime spirit. Everybody pulled together”. A similar observation was made by participants from the local government sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees linked the two themes of organisational preparation and pre-existing workplace culture. This identified the need for a clear allocation of jobs and responsibilities. Where tasks were clearly attributed, victims experienced less chaos and seemed to better stay on top of the incident, an important factor contributing to the maintenance of morale and the reduction of harm. It also helps to avoid duplication of efforts, which can be especially costly when hired third parties are involved. Additionally, the allocation of tasks should be accompanied by situational awareness; this reinforces the utility of pre-incident wargaming. An incident responder highlighted that chief information security officers (CISOs) and data protection officers were acutely at risk of being overwhelmed. They recalled a typical case where the CISO was “this one guy in the middle, who was the fundamental access point for all of the activity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allocation of jobs is closely linked to the reaction of, and leadership from, senior management and the board. Their role can help to alleviate harm or add additional burden. A victim in the technology sector felt that “we were ill equipped at senior leadership level to deal with this”, particularly regarding job allocation. An incident responder went as far as to say that the technical response to an incident is the easy part and that, instead, leadership rather than technical expertise is the overriding factor. A ransomware specialist explained that “one thing that makes [the experience] better is a strong CEO leadership or a strong senior board leadership, making a decision right at the beginning how they’re gonna deal with this and taking responsibility”. For example, the board may take additional action to support the incident response team. One interviewee explained how the chairman provided an additional office freezer for ice-cream, which was intended to be gentle on the stomach during late-night working. Conversely, the coordinator of a ransomware response at a charity organisation resented that senior management did not offer use of an existing apartment in the office building for rest and food consumption. In their case, the combination of lack of sleep, poor nutrition and excessive consumption of caffeine necessitated a visit to A&amp;amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extreme exertion that may be required to recover from ransomware – especially for IT staff – supports the organisation but may degrade the wellbeing of staff through sleep deprivation, physical inactivity, poor nutrition and strained relationships. As the primary interest of the board or trustees often remains the financial impact on an organisation, there is a risk of overlooking the physiological and psychological impact the ransomware attack might have on individuals. As an indication of a common trend, one IT expert in the charity sector stressed that they would have liked to see more support from senior management, for example with respect to looking after the health of the core team responding to the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not isolated to the ransomware crisis itself and can include a post-ransomware workplace legacy. One victim described how, after the incident had been resolved, they had to work harder and took longer to do tasks due to additional fail-safes, for example when manually creating reports that were normally done automatically. They added that they felt that “nobody cared that we were working harder” as the bottom line was the core concern. Messaging from senior leadership can also influence staff morale and the working environment during and after a ransomware event. Particularly where cyber awareness is low, board members or trustees might engage in a culture of blame, for example by accusing the IT team of failing to do its job. One victim described how there was no clear messaging from leadership, for example on communication about the incident. Given the lack of cyber awareness among senior staff members, IT staff also, at times, find themselves “leading the charge”, as a victim in the charity sector explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the role of senior management might be proactive and supportive, realising that a ransomware attack is not just an IT problem. In these cases, senior management can prevent burnout of team members, making sure to rotate staff and providing them with time off. In local government, for example, staff of a victim organisation were given extra holidays and paid time off once the immediate response was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This highlights that responding to a ransomware attack must be thought of as a marathon, not a sprint. Many interviewees and, particularly, incident responders and external counsels stressed this point. Some of them highlighted that one of the first things they do is advise on the need to rotate staff and prevent burnout. This is true for staff at the victim organisation, but equally applies to third parties, such as incident responders. Such responders run a high risk of burnout and therefore need to rotate between incidents or have leave provided to limit the stress they experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general workplace culture is therefore a critical factor that determines how victims perceive a ransomware incident. While policymakers and cyber security professionals cannot have an impact on workplace culture, they can stress the important role that it plays in preparing for, and responding to, incidents. This includes drawing attention to the critical role of senior management and board members in managing the ransomware incident. Awareness and educational training must highlight the positive effects that stem from a clear division of tasks and vision for the response. Furthermore, awareness campaigns and best-practice guidance can outline practical examples of how to provide support for the core response team and avoid a culture of blame. Boards and senior management must also be cyber aware – this is a key aspect of an existing work culture that can contribute to alleviating the ransomware harm. New legal obligations and/or training of boards and senior management can achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;paying-or-not-paying-a-ransom-demand&quot;&gt;Paying (or Not Paying) a Ransom Demand&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees frequently spoke of the influence of ransom payments on the victim experience. The project team interviewed individuals from both ransom-paying and non-paying victim organisations. Only a minority of victim organisations who took part in the interviews paid ransoms. Two interviewees noted that their organisation made a ransom payment because it was the most efficient solution to decrypt affected systems in an acutely time-sensitive context. Another interviewee noted that their organisation had paid a ransom because they were very keen to dissuade the threat actors from releasing sensitive exfiltrated data. While the overall number of ransom-payers is limited relative to the number of interviewees, there are nonetheless significant insights that can be gleaned from the role that ransom payment (or non-payment) has in influencing the ransomware victim experience. Importantly, apart from select government or law enforcement interviews, interviewees were typically not directly asked about the morality of ransom payments or whether ransom payments should be permitted or prohibited. Rather, the focus was on the experience of paying (or not paying) a ransom and how this positively or negatively impacted the victim’s journey through a ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cases above, the payment of the ransom significantly alleviated the harms experienced. Payment of the ransom meant, for example, that students were able to complete their exams in the usual way. This would not have been possible if the victim, who came from the European education sector, had sought to restore systems without a decryption key. For a victim working in the technology sector, the ransom payment was the only viable option to keep the company afloat. For the outsourcing firm, the payment of the ransom meant that, at least at the time of writing, the threat actors had not released exfiltrated data. While anecdotal, these case studies highlight that, in some situations, the payment of a demanded or negotiated ransom can significantly alleviate harms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, however, important to note that interview data also highlighted that a ransom payment is not a silver bullet. A ransomware negotiator noted that in their experience, all ransomware operators will eventually “go rogue”. For example, they may re-extort from the same victim after a ransom payment has been made, they may not deliver operable decryption keys, or they may renege on promises and release or sell exfiltrated data. Other studies have confirmed such outcomes, finding that a high percentage of victims who pay are victimised again. Similarly, studies report that not everyone paying a ransom actually recovers their data. In this light, whether a ransom payment successfully alleviates the harm that is experienced depends on the good faith of the ransomware operators and the technical efficacy of their malware (and decryption keys).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is important to note that the payment of a ransom does not absolve a victim organisation of its obligations to report the incident to the ICO; the breach has still occurred. The compounding of reputational risk was cited as a concern. Non-paying victims noted that there was a stigma attached to paying organised criminals a ransom and noted that had they made a payment, it would have adversely affected their relationship with clients or other stakeholders. The logistics of making the ransom payment, including accessing large quantities of Bitcoin, can also be challenging. One ransom payer recalled that the process of multiple bank authorisation checks to purchase increments of Bitcoin was arduous and compounded their stress. It is worth noting that UK banks have increasingly prohibited customer access to cryptocurrency exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision on whether to pay a ransom weighed heavily on victims. Of course, paying a ransom is also a financial decision (see Figure 2), but whether to pay a ransom also raises other considerations for victims. An interviewee from a victim organisation that elected to pay a ransom noted that the decision-making was difficult and stressful for the executive board. A ransomware specialist noted that victim organisations that agonise over whether to pay a ransom prolong the initial (and most stressful) crisis phase of the ransomware event. Conversely, those that quickly ruled out a ransom payment were able to focus their energy on the rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The payment of a demanded or negotiated ransom can thus both positively and negatively influence the ransomware victim experience. Preparedness is important. This should include delegating decisions to individuals to make payment decisions. Organisational leadership must also bear in mind that the payment of a ransom does not guarantee restoration of access to encrypted files or systems, nor the deletion of exfiltrated data. It is also important that organisations adhere to local regulations on reporting and sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experience of Dealing with Third Parties in the Ransomware Response Ecosystem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section looks at some of the third parties a ransomware victim might typically be in contact with when reacting to a ransomware attack and further explores the degree to which these interactions influence the victim experience. Given the key role of law enforcement and other public sector service providers, Chapter III is dedicated to their impact on the victim experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How organisations interact with third parties in the ransomware ecosystem is an essential component of the victim experience. Some victims have a very positive experience in their engagement with external parties. One victim in the private sector stressed that “we were really looked after”. Others gave less credit to external parties and stressed that, ultimately, they were alone in the experience. The interview data confirms that the interaction with third parties is an important factor for the victim experience. As a ransomware specialist phrased it: “harm does get amplified if [victims] don’t have good advice”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the key third parties and their services are highlighted in Figure 3 and explored in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lawyers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many victims acknowledged that legal advice on the repercussions of a ransomware attack is necessary, particularly on the implications of the data breach and potential lawsuits that might cause further harm. Increasingly, however, lawyers are consulted at the very beginning of an incident and subsequently manage relationships with all parties involved. One victim said lawyers helped with the risk assessment for exfiltrated data, particularly to assess the scope of potential lawsuits coming from those whose data has been exfiltrated. However, as lawyers are often tasked with avoiding potential further harms, their positive impact may be less tangible for victims. Additionally, lawyers typically work to protect the organisation as a single entity, rather than the individuals connected to it. Here, again, the interview data may speak to a dichotomy between the success and failure of the organisation and the real-time experiences of staff at the organisation. Some victims conveyed a negative experience dealing with lawyers, primarily stressing that the involvement of a legal team often meant that lawyers limited communications and information sharing about the incident – including as a precaution due to perceived legal risks. A victim in the education sector confirmed that the legal team was “really tight on what we could and couldn’t say”. This meant that they could only communicate that there was a cyber attack, but not a ransomware attack, which “made things hard at times”. One victim also felt that restrictions imposed by the legal team prevented them from sharing information, for example sharing technical indicators with the NCSC. Others also reported that they were unable to share information, and therefore were unable to warn colleagues in other institutions. This led to feelings of guilt when a later attack against an acquaintance might have been prevented had a warning been shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hrV3HMM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Examples of Private Sector Third Parties Offering Victims Services and Support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of legal wraparound on the ability of victims to share their experiences was also noticed by an interviewee from law enforcement. They stated that they “definitely found it hard to engage with organisations freely once a law firm becomes involved”. While they respected the lawyer’s prerogative to act in the best interest of their clients, the law enforcement interviewee nevertheless felt that it impacted their ability to “respond effectively”, for example, because they cannot take down an exfiltrated dataset if they do not know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers therefore reduce the harm to individuals and organisations in less tangible ways, for example by preventing future lawsuits. However, their concern over the legal implications stemming from oversharing information limits information and knowledge exchange. Their requirements to tightly control information are therefore perceived to potentially contribute to strained experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insurance Providers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most organisations do not have cyber insurance, interviewees from organisations that did were overwhelmingly positive about their interactions with cyber insurance providers. Interviewees credited their coordinating function and their ability to convene appropriate external service providers at speed. For example, one victim was “amazed at the scale and quality of support that was very quickly in place”. Another victim confirmed the central role of their insurance provider in the steering process, stating that without that service the start of recovery would have been delayed and taken a lot longer. Similarly, another victim confirmed that without insurance they would not have known how to find the right experts and would have taken much more valuable time to do so, describing having cyber insurance as “absolutely pivotal”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data confirms the central role of insurance providers in coordinating the ransomware response and correlates with similar findings from prior research. There were two core benefits. First, access to a support network: “it’s the expertise and the people and how quickly you can assemble the team”. The value of cyber insurance in helping to manage the response is particularly important for smaller organisations given they are much less likely to have incident response or legal services on a retainer. Second, insurance provides access to a financial cushion: for example, one interviewee described the benefit of cyber insurance as allowing the company to respond to the attack without concerns over cost. Another victim, the director of a micro-SME, found that having insurance “saved everything”, and that without it “it would have been totals”, including the need to sell their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support and experience of insurance providers might also alleviate some of the stress and mental harm experienced by victims. One victim added that they were impressed that the insurers “were completely unflappable. They stood behind us straight away”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incident Responders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees painted a mixed picture with respect to the impact of incident responders. They were generally perceived as providing critical work limiting the – often technical – harm that victims experienced. This is especially true for organisations that do not have in-house IT teams with experience of handling ransomware incidents. Such organisations may feel that they are out of their depth in dealing with a ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the context of external incident response support matters. One incident responder confirmed that in the past six months they were the second firm to be called to a case for roughly 50% of their ransomware cases. Some incident responders may not be well-aligned with the IT infrastructure of the victim organisation; in one cited example, an incident responder required several days to patch the client’s IT systems so that it could connect to the response firm’s forensic software. Other incident responders might lack the experience that can be acquired from handling high caseloads to result in the most efficient and effective path. An incident responder concluded that they had “seen some awful, awful aftermaths of either bad breach counsel, bad PR [and] even bad recovery”. Comments such as these stressed that third parties, including incident responders, can aggravate the harm victims experience when they provide a poor service, increasing the victim’s operational downtime and potentially forcing victims to reach out to a second incident responder for an expedited resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While primarily focused on technical response and recovery, incident responders may also alleviate the harm by providing mental wellbeing support. In part, this comes through the core service provided. This may include providing rapid access to professionals who have experience with ransomware incidents and who offer reassurance to victims. Other interviewees highlighted that some incident response firms had created add-on counselling services for their clients. An incident responder suggested that roughly 20% of clients had taken up a recently formed counselling service, and they confirmed that the service had been well received. This service was “air-gapped” from the technical incident response activity and was provided by a specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from specialist counselling services, providing ad hoc mental wellbeing support can pose a challenge for incident providers, who are often hired for technical, rather than soft, skills. They often lack counselling qualifications. One interviewee confirmed that “in crisis management, you’re a bit of a grief counsellor”. Another interviewee described that they have worked with emotional clients who – although thankful in the end – were very angry, requiring the team of incident responders to be “on their tiptoes straight away”. This was reported as being especially the case when victims have a history of mental health difficulties. The success or failure of a business may also be closely entwined with an individual’s personal life, as with a micro-SME. In these instances, the incident responder described how they needed to shift to coaching more vulnerable individuals through an issue. In addition, they might help with writing the technical side of ICO reports, improving victims’ ability to effectively communicate to the ICO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incident responders thus play a critical role in limiting the technical harms that victims experience. However, they can also increase harm where their efforts are unsuccessful. Furthermore, hiring incident responders is often expensive, adding to the financial harm that victims experience. Such costs pose significant challenges for small companies or publicly funded organisations already working with a tight budget, such as schools or local councils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Negotiators&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview data highlighted that contracted specialist negotiators can be a useful service that improves the experience of the victim organisation. Unlike the victim, who is likely to be in the midst of their first engagement with ransomware operatives, specialist negotiators have extensive experience of communicating with various ransomware operatives. They understand how to approach the operatives to either negotiate a lower ransom payment or acquire as much information from the operatives as possible. Conversely, direct negotiations between the victim and the attacker can introduce additional risk. A negotiator described how the “worst thing” a victim organisation can do is open discussions with the attackers at an executive level: attackers are likely to exploit this by ratcheting up pressure and insisting on demands for a high ransom. Interviewed ransomware victims noted that their contracted specialist negotiators would typically pretend to be a more junior member of the victim organisation, for example a secretary. This enabled the negotiator to feign technical ignorance and, importantly, insist that they needed to check with superiors before making any decisions or offers, potentially increasing negotiation leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a trend that may closely mirror the earlier professionalisation of traditional kidnap and ransom services, threat actors likely know they are speaking to contracted specialists, rather than the victims themselves. However, there are still positive aspects of drawing on the services of negotiators. Notwithstanding general increases in the value of demanded cyber ransoms, there are some indications that threat actors and contracted negotiators are normalising a process and dialogue that sees ransoms haggled down by an “industry standard” of roughly 40%. Contracting negotiation services may therefore lower the ransom payment and overall incident costs. A prominent public example of ransomware negotiation comes from Royal Mail, which succeeded in stalling for time through negotiations. Royal Mail seemingly used the extended timelines to obtain proof of data theft from the criminals in order to implement technical measures that enabled the return of some of its operations by bypassing the encrypted systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specialist negotiators can also provide victims with advice about the ransomware criminals: for example, whether offered decryption keys are likely to be viable, or whether operatives’ claims about deletion of exfiltrated data are credible. This provides valuable insight when a victim organisation is seriously considering making a ransom payment. Negotiators can also use their experience to identify irregularities: for example, when the normalised dialogue referred to above is not taking place. A victim described how their negotiating service noticed that their threat actors seemed inexperienced. Thanks to the services of the negotiating firm, the victim organisation was able to exploit the threat actors’ inexperience by offering a low-ball payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PR Firms and Media Relations Teams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many victims hire external PR support to ensure good communication throughout the incident and its aftermath. Some interviewees said that external communications services were helpful in guiding external communications and drafting statements. One victim described their communications service as “excellent”. Others, however, were less content. A victim in the education sector stated that the PR team engaged was not specialised in their sector and was therefore unable to comprehend the needs of a higher education customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PR firms are often primarily hired to deal with media relations. Like many engagements with other third parties, interactions with media are a double-edged sword for the victim experience, as they serve as an amplifier of good or bad communications. While some companies, particularly Norsk Hydro, were cited as organisations that benefited from wider media attention, many victims remain sceptical of media reporting and are reluctant to engage with media representatives. One external counsel even spoke about an incident where the company sought “a complete injunction against any publication of any information concerning the incident, so there could be no media reporting” to ensure there were no reputational consequences. This was regarded among interviewees as a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, it is the fear of further – reputational or other – harm that overshadows victims’ perspective on the role of media. One victim referred to a case where media coverage led to additional harm. They explained how, after the incident spread on the news, they experienced a “massive increase in … general denial of service attacks, people trying to get in the front door”. An insurance expert went as far as saying “if there’s any press interest … , that’s never good” – especially for smaller businesses not used to being in the spotlight, as was the case for an individual who had a photographer appear at their house. Further concern related to media coverage causing additional long-term harm, given that once the information is online it often remains publicly accessible long after the incident and can therefore also be read by new clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privately hired third-party service providers therefore significantly impact the victim’s experience. They are a powerful factor that can improve the victim experience if the relevant services are provided swiftly and are effective. However, if third-party service providers are unable to provide such positive impact, for example because they are inexperienced in a ransomware setting, fail to deliver adequate technical support, or provide advice that is not tailored to a victim’s specific situation, they may significantly contribute to the harm a victim experiences. Policymakers must therefore recognise the key role that private sector services play in the ransomware response and the victim experience. Initiatives setting out recommended incident-response services make it easier for victims to find a service that is more likely to provide services that lessen the harm experienced. Policymakers must also consider how ransomware victims, such as schools or councils, that often cannot afford the response services examined here or might not have cyber insurance, can have access to services that alleviate their harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;internal-and-external-communications&quot;&gt;Internal and External Communications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communications are a critical element determining the victim experience and can either alleviate or aggravate the harm that a ransomware attack causes. Of course, communication can be interrupted on a technical level during an incident, for example because email servers are down or because employees’ phone numbers are not accessible. This section does not address these practical concerns but focuses on communications from a strategic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;External Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External communication is often the main concern of victim organisations, particularly how to communicate with customers or stakeholders, as well as students or parents. Interviews generally pointed to the relevance of sector-specific and context-tailored communications and victims’ reluctance to be transparent in their external communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communicating a narrative of victimhood may also have a positive impact. This was the case for a victim in the education sector whose communications team managed communications, including on open social media. There, reactions entailed “a neutral to positive sentiment”, because “people saw us as a victim, which always helps because people sympathise with victims”. Interviews also highlighted that external communication is particularly challenging for those employees who are not part of the immediate response team. While they might not have comprehensive insights themselves, they are often the ones who must communicate with clients or customers in the aftermath of the incident. One interviewee spoke of “difficult conversations people had to have with their customers when they weren’t allowed to say anything”, which they described as “very stressful”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To limit their harm, victims must strike the right balance between over- and under-communication. This is a highly context-specific task. On the one hand, a classic mistake is “over communication and not thought through communication”, both to customers as well as in fulfilment of legal notifications. This can actually make the situation worse when the victim who wants to get the message out does not understand the wider implications. Too little communication, on the other hand, can cause additional harm, as the example of the 2023 Capita ransomware attack has demonstrated, where the victim was heavily criticised for insufficient communication. Interview data included a victim in the public sector who regretted not communicating more openly with residents to explain the gravity of the situation in more detail, which in turn led to frustration from their side. Another victim described that they “were so petrified” that their ransomware attack would be disclosed to clients that they did not communicate openly, instead referring to it as a “cyber incident”. However, employees were able to correctly guess what the incident entailed. This communication strategy led to a credibility gap, according to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striking the balance between over- and under-communication is often difficult for victims. This is especially the case when operating with limited time to fulfil noticing requirements, or where legal advisers or PR experts are telling them to limit communications and transparency, or when they fear that sharing too much information will result in further harm. This was, for example, the case for an interviewee who described the careful consideration that was needed in communications due to stock market rules. In some instances, even government ministers have told councils not to go public with the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internal Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interviews stressed that internal communications had an important impact on the victim’s experience. Internal communication is a key tool to keep up morale and improve the effectiveness of the response. A victim from the education sector stated that “keeping people in the loop about what’s happening was a key factor in reassuring people that we would come through it”. Interviewees pointed out that internal communication is especially relevant to ensure that those employees who are not part of the inner circle that is responding to the incident are included and aware of what is going on. Likewise, where such communication is weak, they might feel excluded. This led one victim to regret not including earlier those not directly involved, for example by giving them advance notice of when they would be involved again. An interviewee in the technology sector identified the importance of better internal communications as one of their key lessons from the incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When internal communication was poor, “it affected morale very quickly”, as one victim from the professional services sector explained. For them, internal communications “were not optimal” as the organisation handled internal questions poorly. In this instance, the poor communication led to “very worried staff and eventually that became public as well”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal communication includes communications with contracted third parties. It may also require victims to engage with other co-workers with whom they may not ordinarily work. Communicating during the incident can be difficult as it requires engagement with a wide range of stakeholders, varying in technical expertise and seniority. One victim described “flipping between different types of conversations” as “challenging”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviews also addressed challenges communicating technical problems to a non-technical audience. One IT staff member in the charity sector described the difficulties that they experienced in communicating what was happening to senior management whose members lacked technical knowledge. This staff member did not want to undersell the gravity of the situation, but equally did not want to overburden the other party. They also felt there was a risk that senior management could think the IT team was incompetent based on these communications. Similar observations were also true for incident responders, who might also have to brief CEOs of large companies, people with whom they would not normally interact without months of preparation, but now had to brief under considerable pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a victim in the financial services sector felt that as boards “will only talk in money”, it was not sufficient to state that their team was performing poorly. Instead, they developed a cost model that described costs incurred – due to ill team members or the need to hire contractors or onboard new staff – to gain the board’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal and external communications therefore have a strong influence on the victim experience. Striking the right balance between over- and under-communication can alleviate the victim’s harm; failing to do so can aggravate it. While communication strategies are highly context- and victim-specific, policymakers and practitioners must be aware of their potential impact and promote the importance of a good external and internal communication strategy. A strong internal communication strategy is particularly important as it risks being overlooked in current approaches to incident response and planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transparency-and-information-sharing&quot;&gt;Transparency and Information Sharing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of transparency and information sharing was a recurring theme throughout the interviews. The importance of getting good advice from external parties, previous victims or the public sector stood in contrast to the limited transparency and secrecy that occurs in practice. Secrecy about the incident often results from feelings of shame or fear of reputational and subsequent financial harm. However, the advice of third parties such as lawyers and PR specialists can make victims even less likely to share their experience. This is the case when they are counselled against sharing too much information as it might be used against the victim in subsequent legal proceedings. Interviewees critically discussed the role of lawyers and legal privilege in this context. While many victims confirmed they were given legal advice not to share information, some experts did not see legal privilege as stopping victims from sharing information in all circumstances. One legal expert stressed that while they cannot share information about individual clients, general comments and anonymised information can nevertheless provide valuable insights on best practice, without legal risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of transparency among victims was repeatedly raised during the research for this paper. For example, one victim reported feeling isolated during the incident after they were told not to share their experience. During the interviews, it became evident that victims found it helpful to talk about their experience, either in the interview itself or in other forums they previously explored. One victim stated that they “found it quite useful just to talk to you and other people, in a candid open approach … I found that useful, and I think it might help people”. This again links to the limited attention paid to the psychological impact and the individual’s experience of a ransomware attack in corporate cultures that provide little opportunity to process the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is not just the individual victim that would benefit from greater transparency. More information exchange among victims and potential victims is a meaningful way to share best practices. One victim described the challenging situation that they faced when they wanted to warn a colleague and friend in another education institute, so that they could block IP addresses and take other enhanced security measures. However, legal advice prohibited the victim from sharing this information. Similarly, another victim in the public sector stressed the importance of sharing their experience to raise awareness among other public sector institutions, especially to challenge over-confident assumptions that they would not be impacted by an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing information among victims offers unique insights: for example, as a reminder to others that they will make it through the incident. Victims might also provide recommendations for sector-specific best practices or be able to offer empathy on a deeper level. One victim described that they read ransomware reports prior to experiencing an attack themselves. However, it was more of an intellectual exercise, whereas after the incident, reading the reports made them “feel a lot of sympathy for the companies that are currently trying to navigate their way through these issues”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While interviewees broadly agreed that greater transparency was desirable, there was little agreement on the mechanisms to share information. Suggestions that government bodies such as the NCSC should encourage greater transparency or set up an exchange platform were met with mixed reactions. Some interviewees pointed out that any institutionalised approach would deter victims from sharing openly. There was a preference for a peer-supported group, but questions remained as to its exact structure and feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information sharing to enhance understanding of best practices and the desire for greater transparency among victims therefore stands in contrast to the secrecy that often surrounds ransomware attacks. While the benefits of more information sharing are clear, enabling such practices requires a forum where victims feel safe to share their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-influence-of-regulators&quot;&gt;The Influence of Regulators&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engagements with regulators have a significant impact on the victim experience. In the UK, a ransomware victim ought to report their incident to law enforcement, but they are not obliged to do so. If, however, the ransomware incident has affected personal data, the victim must report it to the ICO within 72 hours of first becoming aware of the event. The ICO safeguards data subjects who are affected by the exposure of their personal data. It is obliged to ensure that organisations – including those on whom ransomware has an impact – comply with mandatory data compliance. Framing the data subject as the victim-to-protect has important implications for interactions between the victim organisation (and its staff, who may also be data subjects), their third-party support and data regulators. This paper therefore does not provide a complete assessment of ICO activities but focuses instead on how ransomware victims perceive the ICO and its work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, a third of cyber cases reported to the ICO related to ransomware, possibly creating the most comprehensive database of UK ransomware victims. Interviewees were keen to share their experiences of engaging with the ICO during and after their ransomware incidents. Such engagement was repeatedly identified as a critical factor that aggravated the victim experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overriding complaint made about the “ICO experience” was the time taken for investigations. A range of factors determine the time taken to investigate. For example, they can include: an organisation’s ability to provide information; workloads during the Covid-19 pandemic; or funding models. In some instances, the time needed to engage with the ICO vastly exceeded almost all other remediation aspects of a ransomware event, barring data subject litigation. Another victim expressed frustration that a fresh request for information from the ICO asked “basic” questions that had already been comprehensively answered in a previous response. The engagement with the ICO was likely to last for months, but could extend to a year or more. An interviewee from an education organisation affected by ransomware noted that their case with the ICO was still ongoing two years after the incident. A legal practitioner with experience of supporting ransomware cases noted that they suspected that funding and/or staffing issues were causing this. Reporting has previously suggested that under-resourcing may be an ongoing issue, although the ICO’s annual reports highlight a significant increase in staffing from 2020/21 to 2022/23. Additionally, given that the ransomware victim experiences included in this project’s data corpus partially occur at the same time as various Covid-19 restrictions, it is possible that altered working practices contributed to some delays or the perception of delays in processing times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the suggested delay in reaching “closure” from a ransomware event was a source of frustration, stress and upset for victims. Victims referred to a “Sword of Damocles” effect: they were unsure whether the ICO was going to fine or censure them. The process of engaging with the ICO was also described as laborious. A victim from the education sector, for example, described being “bombarded” with letters and felt victimised. A response to ICO letters would beget further letters requesting detailed information from the IT team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As indicated earlier, the ICO has a mandate to investigate data compliance practices. That said, there was a significant trend: interviewees widely noted that their experience with the ICO added further harm at an already difficult time. For some, the protracted timelines made it difficult for them to move on after other aspects of the incident had already been finalised. However, it must be noted that while most experiences with the ICO were negative, some interviewees reported more positive experiences. For instance, the coordinator of an IT ransomware response at a charity organisation noted that while there was a wait for the ICO response in their case, they felt that the response was supportive and understanding. While the reports and interviews took time, they found the overall experience to be “less terrifying” than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conduct of those reporting to the ICO may also potentially have a bearing on experiences. An IT director from the education sector noted that they proactively kept the ICO up to date on the investigation and remediation processes; they believed their transparent and forthcoming approach smoothed their engagement with the ICO and facilitated an ideal outcome. A digital forensics and incident response interviewee noted that victim organisations – or those supporting them – need to have a clear picture of what data the organisation holds and which data subjects are affected; if a written response to the ICO did not provide all the information legally required, it was likely that the exchange of letters would be lengthier. The coordinator of an IT response at a multinational engineering firm noted that they sent a courtesy email to the ICO before they notified the stock market of their incident, but that because of the nature of their incident, there was no follow-up or investigation. There were also suggestions that organisations should not rush to make a report to the ICO before they have a clear understanding of what has occurred, and that ideally they should seek guidance from an experienced external counsel before making a submission. A legal practitioner noted that, despite their guidance, it was not uncommon for stakeholders at a client victim organisation to “panic overnight” in the first day or two of an incident and clumsily report to the ICO, causing additional avoidable pain in the ensuing months. This is a tricky balancing act, particularly given the 72-hour deadline for notifying the ICO following awareness of a breach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it should be emphasised that the ICO has an important role in protecting the data rights of UK data subjects. Where a ransomware event impacts data subjects, they too are victims of the ransomware. Interviewees noted that the ICO was a necessary part of the UK’s regulatory system and that it was right that it should follow due process and work to drive positive transparency in organisations. Ultimately, the data corpus indicated that there is a balance that should be struck between empathising with organisations that receive a ransom note as victims of serious international organised crime and using regulatory pressure to encourage the adoption of stringent personal data-protection practices. While the purpose of the ICO may be apt, changes that can improve the victim experience may be possible. Those that can, wherever possible, reduce the prolonged stress and uncertainty are especially important. Victims also should not need to resubmit identical evidence or information when a prior comprehensive reply has already taken place. At the same time, victim organisations should be advised that they can submit a brief initial report within the 72-hour limit, and therefore avoid submitting a more detailed report in haste during the opening phase of an extremely stressful crisis situation. Here, the support of experienced external counsel may be particularly useful to coordinate a measured or cautious initial submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-role-of-government-the-ncsc-and-law-enforcement&quot;&gt;III. The Role of Government, the NCSC and Law Enforcement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter sets out the role of the public sector support and engagement network ecosystem. Findings are based on interview discussions on the support victims receive from local police, regional organised crime units (ROCUs), the NCSC and the NCA, as well as the engagements victims have with the ICO. The analysis does not cover the capacity of government and law enforcement bodies to bring ransomware operators to justice. Rather, it draws insights on the nature, scale and impact of public sector support for ransomware victims. Specifically, the focus is on the degree to which this support ecosystem improves and/or exacerbates a victim’s experiences during a ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BR1dadI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: Types of Support Provided to Ransomware Victims, by Organisation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;types-of-support&quot;&gt;Types of Support&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police, NCA, NCSC and ICO may support ransomware victims in a variety of ways. Table 3 provides an indicative list of support categories. Note, pre- and post-breach notifications may most commonly relate to “Protect” notifications that law enforcement may issue to organisations after receiving intelligence about a current or likely breach. “Passive” crisis management support refers to activity such as sitting in on teleconference calls between victim personnel and colleagues from their third-party incident response firm. Conversely, “active” crisis management refers to on-the-ground remediation support, which may include technical remediation of affected systems. As highlighted in the next section, active crisis management is less commonly provided than its passive equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-ncsc-and-law-enforcement-support-is-allocated&quot;&gt;How NCSC and Law Enforcement Support is Allocated&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview data highlighted that the makeup of the support ecosystem is likely to vary depending on the context of an individual victim. The NCSC’s cyber incident framework provides an indication, ranging from Category 1 (national cyber emergency) to Category 6 (localised incident). A direct victim experiencing a Category 6 incident is likely to find that their incident is supported by local police. At Category 4 or above, the NCSC may become involved, with a greater likelihood of NCSC coordination/lead at Category 3 and above. As the incident framework articulates, the assessment is, in part, driven by the likely impact of an incident on societal or governmental functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, an SME providing a vital service that experienced a disruptive ransomware incident could therefore receive NCSC support. There is a degree of fluidity with the support ecosystem, but this equally leads to a sense of uncertainty as to who can expect NCSC support and under what circumstances. A ransomware victim may find that the level of support aligns with, exceeds or does not meet their expectations. An incident responder described their view that UK law enforcement was “more hands off … [they’re] advising and taking details, and then waiting for the victim to provide additional information at a suitable time”. In some limited cases, victims may be able to draw on NCSC/GCHQ technical remediation support, although this service is constrained by resource availability. A government interviewee described how they were not resourced to compete with the private sector, noting that “[Microsoft, Google, Mandiant,] the budgets of these organisations outweigh anything I’ve got … [our] challenge is to work out how to … sit alongside and complement appropriately what exists out there … we need to be realistic. The national resource is targeted at nationally significant incidents”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law enforcement engagement during a typical ransomware victim experience is likely to start with a submission to Action Fraud. Victims who call the national emergency number will probably be redirected to Action Fraud, unless they are particularly high profile. The victim enters text describing the nature of their incident into the Action Fraud submission page. From here, the case is reviewed and triaged; an SME, for example, may be supported by local police, whereas a larger organisation with a regional significance, such as a large university, may be supported by a regional organised crime unit (ROCU). It is also possible for some organisations to be directed to the police after being in contact with the NCA. The victim of ransomware can anticipate that the local or regional police will gather data about the incident, in part to support a regional or national profile of cybercrime trends. The victim may also receive support from law enforcement sources, for example guidance on external communications with stakeholders, or suggestions regarding post-incident “aftercare”, such as vulnerability assessments or cyber exercises. Figure 4 summarises the interactions that are possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processes are not, however, uniform and victim experiences may vary significantly even within a single jurisdiction such as England. On paper, while most victims should contact Action Fraud as a first port of call, there are circumstances where this step may be bypassed. A supplier of critical national infrastructure (CNI), for instance, could bypass Action Fraud altogether and instead report directly to the NCSC. It is also possible that the NCSC and the NCA may draw on intelligence to proactively reach out to a high-significance victim that has avoided reporting their incident. The length of time during which a ransomware victim can expect to liaise with law enforcement can also vary significantly, ranging from weeks to months. It is also worth noting that victims of ransomware may also avoid engagement with the NCSC or law enforcement altogether. All ransomware victims interviewed for this project had engaged with law enforcement in some way. This may reflect the bias of voluntary participation research; individuals who were willing to share their experiences with the research team may be more likely to engage with law enforcement. However, wider reporting suggests several reasons for avoiding law enforcement engagement. These include perceived reputational risks and the fear that law enforcement forensics may interfere with a restoration effort. Additionally, victims may fear that law enforcement, once involved, might find other things of interest beyond the ransomware incident to which they do not want to draw attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/r8mfXs0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: How UK Ransomware Victims Interact with Public Bodies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the sensitivity of a ransomware incident and the desire to control external communications, victims may fear that engagement with law enforcement might increase possible negative exposure. This might include, for example, details of the incident appearing in the press. Additionally, the pressure to restore business operations and move on from the incident means that victims may be concerned that law enforcement agencies will want to take copies of impacted sections of an IT estate for forensic investigation, possibly stalling recovery efforts. This latter point – investigation versus recovery – is a potentially important area of contention. The interests of the individual victim organisation (an effective recovery as soon as possible) may run counter to the interests of wider society (understanding the nature of the ransomware threat). Counter-ransomware successes such as the February 2024 NCA-led takedown operation against LockBit benefit from maximum access to intelligence within the UK and among international law enforcement partners. Furthermore, counter-ransomware initiatives may also stem a ransomware group’s activity and thereby reduce future harm. Existing and new victims may also benefit from seized decryption keys being shared by law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-impact-of-police-support-perspectives-from-victims-and-stakeholders&quot;&gt;The Impact of Police Support: Perspectives from Victims and Stakeholders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M any interviewees were keen to share their experiences of their interactions with law enforcement services during and after their ransomware incident. Given the nature of the distribution of response – with the NCSC liaising with select cases – victims were much more likely to have experience of dealing with local or regional police. This section draws on insights from victims’ assessments of the efficacy of police in dealing with ransomware incidents. The analysis also draws on the perspectives of stakeholders from the ransomware support ecosystem, such as incident responders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Findings in this section need to be seen in their appropriate context: law enforcement services operate with limited resources, and ransomware victims are likely to be under severe stress during their incidents. With these circumstances in mind, the findings are nevertheless useful for policymakers and law enforcement stakeholders. For example, it may be possible to identify areas where tweaks to law enforcement practices for ransomware incidents may have a substantial positive effect on the typical victim experience. While it may not be possible to bring perpetrators to swift justice, law enforcement plays an important role as a public sector support system for victims, and as a collator of regional and national data on the ransomware threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the data corpus, negative perceptions about the role of law enforcement were widespread. A victim from a large multinational firm in the engineering sector noted that they “didn’t see the point” of reporting to law enforcement, citing the lack of a valuable return, during a crisis, and the concern that the police would request data for forensics investigations. Nonetheless, they were quick to add that they had proactively given intelligence to the NCSC and the NCA. A victim from a law firm recalled how they spoke with a cyber specialist from the police who appeared knowledgeable and initially suggested that help may be available to restore systems, but this help did not materialise after a follow-up and the victim was left with the perception that they were on “their own”. The victim cited their cyber insurance as the most valuable source of support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The director of a micro-SME compared two cases of police engagement: one on the ransomware attack against their business; and the other on the theft of their car. Within days, the car was identified and retrieved by police before it could leave the UK for illicit international resale; but no support was forthcoming for the ransomware incident. Multiple victims from the technology sector relayed their view that the police were ill-equipped and/or unable to support them during their incidents. One noted that, from their particular experience, they were left feeling that the police were not familiar with the terms “IP address” or “VPN”, indicating a significant lack of expertise. The policing “skills and resourcing gap” between analogue and digital crime response capability featured prominently in a recent report by the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy. Additionally, an inspection report had previously identified that ROCUs were competing with one another for a limited pool of skilled personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees highlighted that, in some instances, the creation of a crime number may be the extent of police engagement or support. While some victims will receive a visit from the police, others will not. Some victims may not receive any follow-up. More generally, it was notable that there is a degree of inconsistency in law enforcement’s engagement with ransomware victims. Concerningly, there were indications of a “postcode lottery”. While caveating that their experience may be anecdotal, an incident responder described how: “if you are based near Leicester and you report to Action Fraud, it’s going to make it to [the] NCA and they are then going to speak to the local constabulary and you’re actually going to get some kind of support. But if you’re somewhere else, it’s way less likely”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, not all experiences were negative. A victim from the education sector described their police cyber unit as “super supportive … they were excellent, absolutely excellent”. An external counsel interviewee noted that while there continued to be a lack of understanding about the nature of the ransomware victim experience – and the needs of an organisation that has been affected by ransomware – there was an increasing “uptick” in interest among victims to report incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-existing expectations were a critical factor when assessing law enforcement’s support. If a victim’s expectations were low, they were less likely to be disappointed when significant support was not forthcoming. This speaks to an important point: evaluations of the “efficacy” of law enforcement’s engagement with ransomware victims will depend on their understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the police in dealing with international cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given limited resources, the police cannot serve as public sector incident response for ransomware. Interviews emphasised that the incident response ecosystem is almost entirely run by the private sector. However, the data corpus also highlighted a growing role of the UK police as a collector and disseminator of intelligence about ransomware threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of police in ransomware response is, however, not necessarily clear to victims. As law enforcement’s ransomware threat landscape purview develops, there may be more opportunities to clarify the role and contributions of law enforcement. One way to do so is by reinforcing a positive feedback loop. An incident responder described how their perception had changed; previously, they saw the benefit of client engagement with law enforcement as “zero”, but their view was changing after law enforcement had proactively reached out to some clients to let them know that their IT estate was being maliciously accessed by threat actors. Unfortunately, this occurred after the ransomware payload had already been delivered, but the responder viewed the proactive contact with clients as a positive reinforcement for encouraging future client reporting to law enforcement. A similar experience was shared by an external counsel interviewee, who noted that while most engagements with law enforcement were “intelligence gathering” exercises, they had personal experience of a “handful” of cases where the police joined calls and provided updates on the victim’s data exfiltration, drawing on dark-web monitoring. This was regarded by the external counsel as a very helpful development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A law enforcement practitioner noted that, from their experience, ransomware victims typically reported because they “feel like they should”, rather than doing so out of anticipation of in-person support. Another interviewee – a legal practitioner with experience of supporting ransomware victims – highlighted a sense of pragmatism in their approach to engaging with law enforcement. They noted that while they were cautious about the level of information that they would share, there had never been “any detriment” to their engagement with law enforcement and that they were collectively united in the interest of fighting against ransomware. They suggested there were “myths” about the role of law enforcement that may be unhelpfully distorting perceptions of what help is or is not available. A positive feedback loop – in cases where victims have previously shared information with law enforcement – would therefore have an impact by showing victims how such information was used and how it contributed to successful law enforcement activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data suggests that context affects whether the extent of law enforcement engagement can aggravate or reduce the negative experiences of ransomware victims. A range of factors may influence this, including the nature of the victim organisation, its location (including at a county level) and the victim’s expectations. While some victims may welcome an arm’s-length response from law enforcement, others may want more active support, even if this is only an empathetic ear during a time of crisis. This reinforces the utility of an initial phone call or site visit from law enforcement, which can be used to understand a victim’s needs and provide clarity about expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-impact-of-ncsc-and-nca-support-perspectives-from-victims-and-stakeholders&quot;&gt;The Impact of NCSC and NCA Support: Perspectives from Victims and Stakeholders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewees were also keen to share their perspectives on the perceived efficacy of the NCSC and the NCA in relation to the ransomware victim experience. The functions of the NCSC and the NCA are distinct. However, an interesting finding from the data corpus was that victims reported similarities in their experiences of engaging with the two bodies. It was reported that both agencies had roles in background coordination or oversight in certain ransomware incidents. Some ransomware cases drew the support of one agency while others triggered the involvement of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On paper, the incident response framework referred to earlier in this paper partially clarifies the trigger points for NCSC and/or NCA involvement: for example, an incident in Categories 1–4 is likely to warrant some form of NCSC involvement. In practice, however, there was confusion about whether a victim can anticipate NCSC or NCA involvement and the degree of support that may be offered. A government workshop participant indicated that this may be intentional: “if I’m honest, we have used … a degree of ambiguity, and didn’t want to be overly prescriptive on who we wouldn’t support. Which I totally get can be frustrating, but … the desire on our side was to ensure that nobody ruled themselves out in coming forward”. Sensitivity about supply chains means that exceptions, caveats and reactivity were important in determining who can access higher levels of government support. For example, even when a victim is technically not part of CNI, their unique and important position in a supply chain might warrant NCSC or NCA support, as the impacts may be similar. Flexibility in how cases are triaged is necessary to manage limited resources and capacity. In the National Security Strategy Joint Committee report, it was recommended that the NCSC and the NCA be sufficiently funded to provide full-recovery support for all public sector ransomware victims. However, there may be some apprehension about providing the funding necessary for this level of service, particularly given the costs of competing with private sector incident response salaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some incident responders work with the NCSC and/or the NCA on almost all their cases due to the size of their typical clients. However, other interviewees reported frustration with the ambiguity surrounding the involvement of the two agencies. They urged that more clarity be provided on the circumstances in which the NCSC in particular becomes involved. Again, expectations on the timeline and level of support were important factors. An interviewee from a government body (with a significant societal purview) described how they informed central government immediately after the ransomware took effect, but did not get a response for seven days and brought on board private support. After this time had elapsed and public pressure mounted, NCSC personnel came on-site and worked 12-hour shifts alongside the organisation’s IT staff. As a further indication of inconsistent practices, another government body with a significant societal purview received “boots-on-the-ground” support from the NCA and a large incident response firm, with regular calls also including the NCSC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A victim from the technology sector noted that their initial impression after engaging with law enforcement was that the NCA would “own” the coordination of their response throughout the incident, but that, possibly due to resourcing constraints,– the response was, in effect, passed to the local police force. The victim expressed frustration on two fronts: first, the lack of engagement; and second, the lack of clarity about why the NCA withdrew from the case. It was also noted that information sharing with the NCSC and the NCA can feel like a “one-way street”, where agencies absorb threat and incident intelligence but infrequently share feedback or their own intelligence. The NCSC has also been described as “tactically focused”: predominantly interested in the core incident. A victim who kept the NCSC abreast of their incident remediation and shared intelligence thought that it would have been useful for an NCSC representative to have spoken with members of their executive group after the incident. According to them, this would have helped to relay the seriousness of the event to the business’s decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More positively, both the NCSC and the NCA were reported to be “trusted parties” when engaging with victims; victims can approach either body without fear that the government body would share information with the ICO or leak information to the press. An interviewee from a victim organisation that has a CNI-related purview spoke highly of the NCSC’s role as a trusted coordinating authority and found their role as a single point of contact to be useful. Both the NCA and the NCSC were also able, in some circumstances, to discreetly liaise with international law enforcement to arrange for the takedown of exfiltrated data. The February 2024 NCA-led operation that successfully seized LockBit servers included exfiltrated data (including data from those who had paid ransoms for deletion of exfiltrated data) and more than 1,000 decryption keys earmarked for victims. This publicly announced hack-back was internationally acclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some interviewees specifically appreciated the laissez-faire nature of NCSC engagement, believing that the victim’s own IT team and hired expertise were best placed to remediate the ransomware incident and achieve the best outcomes for the organisation. In part, this approach is pragmatic: the NCSC’s incident management team is small, and the agency is not able to compete with the private sector, both in terms of capacity and salaries offered to its staff. It was also suggested that as the NCSC is the public-facing element of a signals intelligence agency, it may not be particularly well placed to serve as an emergency service for most incidents. Ultimately, while the NCSC may serve as an actor-of-last-resort in select cases, it cannot take on this function for many victims. Instead, the NCSC was framed as a source of information and guidance for organisations. It offers a wide range of guidance that organisations can draw on, before and after an incident. This guidance generally received praise from interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, the data indicates that, broadly, the NCSC and the NCA have built reputations as trusted partners in coordinating ransomware incidents, particularly those that have a significant societal impact. Interviewees were also generally understanding of the resource constraints that the NCSC and the NCA face and that their active involvement in an incident remediation process must be rationed. This may temper expectations. There were, however, notable exceptions. Some victims felt that they should have received more active government support during their incident. This was particularly prominent in the education sector, which is not included in the UK government’s list of 13 CNI sectors. This may reflect a grey area between organisations that feel that they have a societally significant role, but which, according to the data, may not qualify for support. At the same time, ambiguity from the NCSC and the NCA may serve a useful purpose. How these considerations are balanced should be guided by the goal of minimising harms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in this chapter, the influence of law enforcement on the victim experience reflects the fact that the enforcement “lag” is incorporated. There are significant structural and judicial impediments to law enforcement’s capacity to bring most ransomware operators to justice. However, law enforcement and regulators can play a role in either alleviating or exacerbating the ransomware victim experience. This chapter has identified a range of practices that can either improve or worsen the victim experience across the full timeline of a ransomware incident. This analysis recognises key nuances and the important role of the wider context. However, the analysis also highlighted important areas of divergence in support between, for example, different police forces. The NCSC’s informal policy of remaining ambiguous about the circumstances that attract its involvement may warrant refinement over time. Additionally, expectation management, clarity of communication and the use of feedback loops appear to be common underlying challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ransomware incidents are deliberately designed to be high-impact events for victim organisations and their personnel. The criminals who code and deploy ransomware seek to cause calibrated harm – or the threat of imminent future harm – against their victims to encourage the payment of a ransom. Whether an attack comes in the form of an encryption or exfiltration event, or both, the attackers exploit an organisation’s reliance on its data and data systems. While a ransomware event is invariably a negative experience for victims, a range of factors can make it relatively “better” or “worse”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on original semi-structured interviews with ransomware victims and expert stakeholders who work with ransomware victims, this paper has identified a range of factors that can influence how harms are experienced. These include factors that are internal to the organisation, such as the level of preparedness and the organisational culture before and after the incident, as well as decisions that are made during the crisis and recovery phases. The overall influencing factors also include those that are external to the organisation, for example, the behaviour of the ransomware threat actors. As the paper has identified, additional external factors include the role(s) performed by third parties such as incident response services, lawyers and public entities (including law enforcement and regulators).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, prevention of the incident is the optimal outcome. However, ransomware is very prevalent and can have a severe impact for any organisation. It is, therefore, necessary to also focus on “resilience”: the ability to reduce impact and maximise recovery after a breach. This paper’s analysis of the internal and external factors may be used to inform ongoing efforts to increase organisational resilience against ransomware breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the analysis and findings, the paper proposes a range of cross-stakeholder recommendations that are based on the combined findings of this paper and an earlier RUSI paper on ransomware harms. That paper categorised first-, second- and third-order harms from ransomware incidents. This paper draws on the same original interview and workshop data corpus that informed the first paper. These recommendations focus on ways to alleviate the victim’s harm. To acknowledge the range of actors who can take measures to mitigate victims’ harms, these recommendations provide suggestions to victim organisations, third-party service providers and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-victims-and-victim-organisations&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Victims and Victim Organisations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 1: (Potential) victims, including those who do not think they will become a victim of a ransomware attack, must continue to improve cyber-specific incident preparation and general cyber hygiene measures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All organisations must consider themselves potential victims of ransomware attacks and must therefore continue to improve their cyber security and cyber hygiene measures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Despite continued awareness campaigns, cyber security is still, all too often, a low priority for many organisations. This is especially the case for public service providers such as schools, and small and micro-businesses. The interview data has shown that good cyber hygiene and cyber security measures can significantly alleviate the harm victims experience. These include good data hygiene and an awareness that any organisation can become the victim of a ransomware attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Organisations should develop cyber-specific contingency plans to prepare for a potential attack and run simulations of cyber incidents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The interview data has further confirmed that while some organisations have contingency plans, they are largely irrelevant or unsuitable if they are not cyber specific. Cyber-specific incident preparation can also include running exercises simulating a ransomware or other cyber incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 2: (Potential) victims who are preparing for and responding to a ransomware incident must recognise the importance of mitigating the psychological impact of ransomware attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychological impacts affect victims in various ways. They are often overlooked, both in the public discourse and among organisations that fall victim to a ransomware attack. Underlying health conditions and the exact role an individual plays within an organisation’s ransomware response can significantly influence their exposure to harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When preparing for an incident, organisations and cyber security professionals must identify and implement measures to mitigate the psychological impact on individuals directly or indirectly affected by the ransomware attack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This includes “soft” measures such as normalising discussions about the impact of workload and stress on mental health, as well as cultivating a supportive workplace culture. It also includes specific plans such as budgeting for mental health support and creating rotating schedules and a division of labour to avoid over-reliance on select individuals. Preparation must also view ransomware response as a marathon, not a sprint, and resources must be allocated carefully. Understandably, even with preparation, victim organisations may not necessarily be accustomed to the toll of ransomware incidents. Here, experienced external support can be instructive. Stakeholders in the incident response ecosystem can proactively offer bespoke pastoral support to personnel at victim organisations. As highlighted in this paper, there is anecdotal evidence that some incident response firms are offering a separate confidential service to clients to meet this need.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During incident response, measures must be taken to avoid burnout and systematic overwork of individuals. Offering opportunities for victims to talk about their experience can further mitigate the impact of psychological harm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Line managers should be sensitive to colleagues’ workloads and the psychological, physical and other harm the ransomware attack has on both the organisation and its staff members. While a ransomware incident will always remain an exceptionally stressful period for a victim organisation, flexibility is required to adjust to staff members’ mental health. Special attention needs to be paid to members of core IT teams, whose pivotal role in the technical elements of the initial remediation and the workload (and responsibility) they have during the incident exposes them to aggravating factors. This is set out in greater detail in the first of RUSI’s two papers. When over-reliance is unavoidable, annual leave or discretionary time off should be considered, once an immediate crisis period ends. A victim organisation can further offer counselling or therapy for affected staff or, at the minimum, an informal place to talk about their experience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When reflecting on the lessons learned after an incident, senior management must acknowledge the personal implications of the ransomware attack and should communicate this within their organisations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Staff members are aware that a ransomware incident is a moment of crisis and, as such, any response has its flaws. However, several interviewees indicated that they were not looking to senior management for silver-bullet solutions. Instead, they wanted an acknowledgement of the personal implications that the ransomware attack had for them. For example, one internal report mentioned during the interviews included a post-incident analysis that focused on the financial impact the ransomware attack had on the organisation. It did not, however, speak of the personal toll it caused and the personal dedication and sacrifices it demanded of employees responding to the attack. Acknowledgment of how personally the attack is felt by staff members is a relatively easy, but meaningful, step that senior management and line managers can take to mitigate frustration and ensure good morale among their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 3: Victims should try to turn their experience into a lesson learned for others and, where possible, communicate with other victims or potential victims in their ecosystem. This can help with personal closure and to raise awareness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper confirms that, for many victims, a ransomware incident is a stressful and potentially dark period in their life, making it hard to talk about their experience. However, the data has also demonstrated the value of talking about the experience, whether it is for personal closure or to provide critical insights to members of their ecosystem and sector to help them better prepare for a ransomware attack. Close communication with lawyers, PR advisers and senior management can help victims gain confidence in making decisions on the kind of information they can share. Victims can also signal their willingness to engage with other victims to their third-party service providers. This would allow such providers to act as networkers for those victims in the midst of a ransomware incident so that they gain the benefit of previous victims’ insights. Finally, regional or sectoral organisations, such as business associations, can offer platforms for victims to meaningfully connect or speak to their peers, providing valuable insights and contributing to raising awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 4: Victims should realise the importance of reaching the right balance of discretion and transparency within their external and internal communications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research for this paper has demonstrated how the right amount of communication and transparency can have a positive impact on the victim experience. It has also underlined that ransomware attacks occur in unique circumstances and that their impact has substantial personal impact. Given the features of each case, it is not possible to provide general advice for victims on how to run their (external) communications during and after a ransomware attack. A victim’s external communication strategy is a highly context-dependent balancing act that seeks to avoid both under- and over-communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the research has clearly stressed the importance of an internal communication strategy. Many victims, however, prioritise or only focus on external communication strategies. To retain morale within the affected organisation and to ensure that the staff members not directly working on the ransomware response do not feel left out, victims should establish regular and transparent communication with the wider organisation. This includes a recognition of the personal toll the ransomware incident has for many staff members (see above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-private-sector-service-providers&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Private Sector Service Providers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 5: Third-party service providers must recognise the importance of efforts that mitigate the psychological impact of ransomware attacks and these must form part of their technical, legal or other services to improve victims’ experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third-party service providers must understand the central role of psychological harm in the victim experience and adjust their performance to consider the individual and psychological needs of a victim.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Third-party service providers, such as incident responders and lawyers, offer highly specialised support to victims. While they may excel in their respective disciplines, they are often insufficiently trained in navigating communications with victims going through such a stressful incident for the first time. Organisations offering these services should provide training for their staff on how to offer both professional services as well as communicate in a considerate way to victims.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber insurance policies should provide coverage for mental health counselling during and after incidents, and insurers should add recommended counselling services to their panels of pre-approved vendors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Third-party service providers cannot and should not be expected to offer counselling that goes beyond their professional obligations or capability. Instead, service providers such as incident responders should consider recruiting specific staff for their soft social skills, possibly including bespoke counselling staff, therapists, councillors and social workers who can support victims in additional ways.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 6: With the consent of the clients, third-party service providers should actively enable information sharing between past, current and potential victims through their networks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third-party service providers should use their networks to actively encourage victims to share their experience with current and potential victims.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Third-party service providers see a large number of ransomware incidents unfold. This makes them highly experienced and puts them in a great position to network between past, current and potential victims. However, it can also mean that what might seem like a uniquely challenging situation to a first-time victim might be the bread and butter of a third-party service provider. Such providers should therefore encourage current and potential victims to talk to former victims who can offer peer insights from the perspective of someone who has gone through similar situations, providing empathetic and tailored support. This is a unique perspective that third-party service providers cannot offer: while they might have worked on many cases, they typically have not been a victim themselves. The research for this paper indicates that many members of the ransomware ecosystem rated these informal transparency and information sharing measures as highly impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When providing advice to victims on the degree of information sharing they can conduct, third-party service providers should not just take into account the interests of the victim organisation, such as mitigating legal or reputational risks. Instead, they should balance them against the psychological impacts on victims that might occur by preventing transparency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are instances when service providers have good reasons to advise a victim to restrict their information sharing or the degree of transparency in communications about their situation to external parties. However, interviews have illuminated that such advice might drive victims into isolation even though they often benefit from sharing their experience. Assessments of third-party service providers differed on whether restricting information sharing – and to what extent – is necessary, with some pointing out that general information sharing is not a problem from a legal perspective. Third-party service providers should therefore carefully balance their advice given to victims on restricting information sharing, taking into account not just the interests of the victim organisation as a whole (such as reputational or legal risks) but also the impact such advice can have on affected staff members and their mental wellbeing. A constructive approach finding a context-specific, carefully balanced solution is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-for-policymakers-and-public-institutions&quot;&gt;Recommendations for Policymakers and Public Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 7: Public policy on ransomware must centre on measures that mitigate victims’ harm. This includes acknowledging and mitigating the psychological impact on victims.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any guidance that is shared on how to prepare for, manage and respond to a ransomware attack must include best practices for mitigating the psychological harm, such as managing burnout and stress, as well as offering counselling services where appropriate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The NCSC’s guidance on incident management or identifying relevant teams and roles supporting incident management, for example, do not include specific reference to softer measures to be taken to improve the victim’s experience and mitigate psychological impact. The NCSC has targeted guidance on “putting staff welfare at the heart of incident response”. However, greater value is achieved when mental health considerations are woven into guidance on preparation and incident-response plans at all levels. This would serve an important function in protecting IT teams and incident responders from adverse mental health impacts, as well as promote awareness and/or recognition from the board and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More public funding is needed for further free mental health services, including therapy tailored to individuals affected by ransomware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While some public funding for counselling and therapy is already available, long waiting lists for mental health support indicate that demand is significantly higher than supply. The Action Fraud website refers to victim support provided by the charity Victim Support, primarily funded by the Police and Crime Commissioners, which now includes specific guidance for cybercrime victims and freely provides victim support tools and services, such as helplines and online tools and practices. Enquiries further found that the way to access victim support remained unclear and that gaps in its provision led to “loss of trust between victims and the systems in place”. While these findings related to fraud, the authors have found that they are also true for a ransomware context.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 8: Public guidance to prepare and respond to an incident is already available and helpful, but must be easier to filter, including for quality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Improve search functions of the NCSC list of guides.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Increased awareness, further research and wider coverage of ransomware incidents over the past few years has led to an extensive, yet decentralised, repository of publicly available information, for example in the form of statistics and advice on best practices. This is generally laudable, especially when sources provide practical information that is widely and freely available. There is now a need to filter this information in a central dataset. While many interviewees were aware of the NCSC’s guidance and commended its utility for ransomware preparedness and recovery, interviewees also found that it is generally difficult to filter for relevant information online, including within the NCSC repository of guides. For example, it might be more intuitive for victims to filter information according to “before”, “during” and “after” the incident than it may be to filter for certain authors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establish a “Guide of Guides”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Interviewees and workshop participants discussed the option of a “guide of guides” as a centralised repository including both NCSC-approved and NCSC-issued information. This would allow users to rely on a wider range of sources and to filter relevant information, for example, according to sector-specific advice. A “guide of guides” would also filter advice in advance of an attack, during an incident or on the ransomware landscape more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 9: Policymakers need to encourage transparency and information exchange by setting up informal safe space forums.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite awareness campaigns about reporting incidents and information sharing, a lack of exchange and transparency still dominates the victim experience. This is highly regrettable, not just from a data-gathering perspective. Further transparency could not only improve statistics and insights into ransomware attacks but also improve the victim experience. When victims share their experience, potential victims can learn from their best practices and avoid their mistakes. Additionally, victims may also feel less isolated and may mentally benefit from sharing the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a well-connected entity, the NCSC must continue to act as an informal networker between past and potential victims and must encourage transparency and information sharing among a wide range of stakeholders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In practice, victims are not incentivised to be transparent. This is especially the case in official or highly formal channels, as concerns over reputational harm or legal consequences outweigh the incentives to openly contribute to knowledge exchange. To counter these concerns, policymakers should encourage informal safe spaces where victims can anonymously share threat intelligence, best practices and other advice. The status of the NCSC as a “trusted partner” may support it as a coordinator of feed-forward forums.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greater promotion and expansion of NCSC trust groups is needed, and greater informality should be encouraged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While some trust groups for specific sectors are already convened under the NCSC, victims were largely unaware of them. Furthermore, it is challenging for policymakers to encourage informal transparency as efforts will likely be seen as formal places for information sharing, making victims fear that any information may be leaked or used against them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 10: Establish a positive feedback loop that shares success stories and notifies victims where the information they shared is successfully used for intelligence and law enforcement activities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase transparency and reporting to the NCSC and law enforcement, policymakers should also focus on developing a positive feedback loop with victims that report. This should include sharing success stories of law enforcement activity directly with victims to illustrate their contributions. For example, where a victim organisation has contributed data that leads to a successful arrest, reclamation of ransom payments or prevention of further ransomware breaches against other organisations, this should be shared with the organisation in question to provide closure and endorsement, notwithstanding necessary redactions or anonymisation. Equally, where law enforcement and other public agencies manage to successfully disrupt cybercriminals, greater publicity of these success stories would further encourage support and enhance the reputation of law enforcement, generating further support and trust from wider society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 11: Government authorities need to clarify the tasks of relevant public institutions and their role in the ransomware response.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NCSC should provide more clarity on when and how it can support victims.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The ransomware response ecosystem is complex and involves many actors from the public and private sectors. However, the interview data illustrated that such engagement is often challenging for victims, who are uncertain where to turn for assistance, to which organisations they should report incidents and what support they can expect from authorities, and how they interact with one another. Duplication of efforts when engaging with authorities often comes at a time of extreme stress for victims, who have little incentive to engage with authorities when they do not expect anything in return. Greater transparency on the relevant actors, the support they provide and coordination among different authorities would streamline communication efforts, manage expectations for engagements and, ultimately, encourage victims to report and provide information to public authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additionally, the NCSC may consider providing tangible (if hypothetical) examples about differing organisations in various ransomware or cyber breach scenarios, identifying which ones would receive what support, and why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While the public perception of the NCSC’s coordination role on ransomware is generally positive, the lack of transparency on the trigger points for NCSC support was criticised. Some ambiguity about the NCSC’s exact involvement may be desirable to maintain the flexibility to adjust to certain incidents or allocate resources more freely. But such ambiguity must be balanced against the need for expectation management and to avoid reputational damage to the NCSC. It is particularly important for the NCSC to set out its role in incident response and what it considers when deciding on whether to get involved in a given incident either directly or as a coordinator. Furthermore, victims require clarification on what kind of support they can expect from the NCSC. Better expectation management in relation to victims and the wider public ensures credibility of the NCSC and encourages victims to report their ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 12: Police must assume their important role as an accessible face of authority in the ransomware response ecosystem, even where their ability to act is limited.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lack of resources and training currently makes local police units ill-equipped to contribute to responses. While it is unrealistic to expect law enforcement to provide emergency service technical response, it is nonetheless the case that local or regional police units provide the face of public authority for victims of ransomware. The experience, detailed earlier in this paper, of the micro-business director whose vehicle was stolen after their ransomware incident, was telling. The exceedingly efficient response to the “analogue” or traditional crime was juxtaposed starkly against the immaterial response to the ransomware incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Victims of a serious ransomware breach must be offered telephone and/or on-site contact from a law enforcement body within a reasonable timeframe of the victim’s initial report to Action Fraud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The interview and workshop data highlighted a wide disparity in the experience of ransomware victims, with indications that there may be a de facto “postcode lottery”. In some instances, ransomware victims have seemingly been given a disservice: for instance, when they reported a ransomware incident through Action Fraud but were never contacted by police. Arguably, all genuine ransomware cases should prompt a call and/or offer of a site visit from the police. The ransomware victims interviewed for this project felt – passionately – that they were undeserved victims of serious transnational organised crime. Additional distress was often caused by the fact that the attackers were perceived as remote and “faceless”. Local or regional police do not need to be faceless. When offered, a perceptible presence or gesture from local or regional police provides victims with a form of recognition of the crime that they have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is not only about public relations; it is an important step in improving the feedback loop. Whether the initial contact with police is positive or negative has an important bearing on the likelihood that a victim engages further with local or regional police during and after an incident. Ongoing or intermittent engagement enables greater opportunities for information to flow in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation 13: The ICO should continue to work towards timely assessments of ransomware breaches to avoid further harm to victims.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent “long-tail” negative experiences cited by ransomware victims was their ongoing engagement with the ICO. Victims routinely engaged in an ongoing exchange of letters with the ICO for months or years after the core elements of their ransomware recovery were complete. As previously noted, the ICO provides a vital service in overseeing compliance with data protection regulations, with a focus on protection of individuals’ personal data. Given the potential scale and depth of data exposure implicated by a ransomware event, it is important that the ICO scrutinises organisations. However, there may be a balance to be struck between the promotion of regulatory compliance and exacerbating a (possible) crisis situation for the ransomed organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The resourcing of the ICO should continue to be assessed, to maximise the efficient triage, assessment and completion of investigations, enabling timely closure and/ or accountability for organisations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The authors of this paper do not determine where this balance lies. However, organisations that were victims of ransomware spoke firmly of their negative experiences of engagement with the ICO. Given that the ICO follows a mandate outlined in legislation, this suggests that legislators may want to reflect on whether the ICO’s approach to censuring victims of cybercrime strikes the correct balance. Additionally, the data corpus highlighted instances when stress was unnecessarily and avoidably exacerbated for ransomware victims. This was the case for a victim who was asked questions that had already been comprehensively responded to in a previous written response. If staffing or process issues contribute to such errors, stakeholders may need to consider whether the funding arrangements for the ICO are adequate to meet its task. It should be noted that the ICO has acknowledged the scale of this challenge and has outlined its ongoing efforts to meet it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

New satellite imagery offers an unprecedented look at four active sites in Cuba most likely to be supporting China’s efforts to spy on the United States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ambitions to expand its global intelligence-gathering capabilities have drawn it to the doorstep of the United States. In a striking revelation last year, Biden administration officials disclosed that China has access to multiple spy facilities in Cuba. While China’s activities on the island remain shrouded in secrecy, satellite imagery analyzed by CSIS provides the latest and most comprehensive assessment of where China is most likely operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0vg6b7H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sitting less than 100 miles south of Florida, Cuba is well positioned to keep watch on sensitive communications and activities in the region, including those of the U.S. military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Azn9o5H.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The southeastern seaboard of the United States brims with military bases, combatant command headquarters, space launch centers, and military testing sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/N5Javf1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cuba has a long history of hosting foreign espionage operations targeting the United States. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union operated its largest overseas intelligence site at the Lourdes Signals Intelligence Complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rumors of China snooping from the island have simmered for decades. The issue resurfaced in mid-2023 amid media reports of a Chinese “spy base” near Havana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PILgD7V.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Satellite imagery and open-source information assessed by CSIS offers an unprecedented look at four active sites in Cuba capable of conducting electronic surveillance operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These four sites are among the most likely locations supporting China’s efforts to spy on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signals intelligence (SIGINT) is a core element of modern spycraft. Intercepting signals transmitted by both civilian and military actors can provide countries with valuable information about their adversaries, competitors, and allies alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting SIGINT is a complex task that requires specialized equipment, namely antennas, optimized for the signal characteristics of their targets. The size, number, orientation, and layout of these antennas determine their capabilities and function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basics-of-beamforming&quot;&gt;Basics of Beamforming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Wr1zXUB.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A single isotropic antenna receives signals from all directions, providing a wide coverage area but limiting its ability to focus the signal’s direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3ll3bz7.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two antennas can be synchronized to create a stronger, focused beam that reduces interference. This is called “beamforming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mM1zMkv.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Beamforming can be further refined with more antennas. Adjusting the phase and amplitude of signals at each antenna allows for precise control over the beam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zWyJ5mc.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Organizing the antennas into a grid allows for steering the beam without the need to physically move the antennas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antennas arranged in a configuration known as a circularly disposed antenna array (CDAA) allow for 360-degree beamforming capability. CDAAs are highly effective at determining the origin and direction of incoming high-frequency signals and were commonly used by both the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AVRjQyu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other types of antennas are also used for SIGINT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish antennas can focus radio waves into a narrow beam, making them effective for communicating with satellites far from the earth, as well as intercepting and collecting signals from a variety of sources. Radar antennas emit and receive radio waves to track physical objects, such as ships, aircraft, and missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geography impacts the effectiveness of SIGINT. Over long distances, radio signals can become difficult to isolate from surrounding signal traffic. Radar transmissions generally require a direct “line of sight” to the target, leading to limitations caused by the curvature of the Earth and other physical obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuba’s proximity to the southern United States and the Caribbean makes it a prime location for collecting SIGINT on the region. For Beijing, having access to SIGINT capabilities in Cuba would open a significant intelligence window inaccessible from within Chinese territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-following-four-sigint-sites-in-cuba-are-strategically-located-to-spy-on-the-united-states&quot;&gt;The following four SIGINT sites in Cuba are strategically located to spy on the United States.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/odIS7hp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nestled in the hills overlooking the capital city of Havana is the largest active Cuban SIGINT site reviewed by CSIS. Located near Bejucal, the complex gained notoriety during the Cold War for housing Soviet nuclear weapons in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For decades, Bejucal has been subject to suspicion for its possible ties to Chinese intelligence activity, including in English and Spanish-language media reporting, U.S. congressional testimony, and unclassified government documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It even featured in the 2016 U.S. presidential primary debates, when Florida senator Marco Rubio called on Havana to “[kick] out this Chinese listening station in Bejucal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Satellite imagery from March 2024 reveals that the area has undergone major updates over the past decade — a clear indication of an evolving mission set. This includes the construction of a mysterious new radome that may contain a radar or ELINT system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;el-salao&quot;&gt;El Salao&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;20-01916n-75444849w&quot;&gt;20° 0’19.16”N 75°44’48.49”W&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/56BOCGx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the opposite side of the island is a new SIGINT complex that has previously gone unreported. There have been numerous unverifiable sources asserting that China has operated a large antenna field in the country’s far eastern province of Santiago de Cuba since 1999. Access to such an outpost would provide China with a highly strategic vantage point near Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, a key U.S. military base in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;CSIS analyzed satellite imagery covering 2,900 square kilometers of the province but did not find such a facility. However, CSIS did uncover a significant new SIGINT collection site under construction just east of the city of Santiago de Cuba, near a neighborhood called El Salao. The structure, whose construction began in 2021, appears to be a large CDAA with a projected diameter of 130 to 200 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once operational, this CDAA will serve as a powerful tool for enhancing air and maritime domain awareness in the region, where the U.S. military and its international partners operate regularly. Some CDAAs of this approximate size are reportedly able to track signals anywhere from 3,000 to 8,000 nautical miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sites like these were a staple of SIGINT during the Cold War. As hostilities between the two superpowers faded and new technologies emerged, Russia and the United States decommissioned or abandoned most of their CDAAs. China, however, has been actively building major new CDAAs, including on its militarized outposts on Mischief Reef and Subi Reef in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wajay&quot;&gt;Wajay&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-02763n-82251348w&quot;&gt;23° 0’27.63”N 82°25’13.48”W&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gsllVmG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Less than 10 kilometers north of Bejucal lies a smaller facility known as Wajay. The presence of security fencing and two guard posts strongly suggests that the site is intended for military or other sensitive activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The compound has gradually expanded over the past 20 years, growing from just one antenna and several small buildings in 2002 to a robust complex today. It now hosts 12 antennas of various sizes and orientations, significant operations and support facilities, and even a small solar farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Unsubstantiated rumors suggest that China played a role in either the site’s construction or its modernization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No dish antennas are visible here, suggesting its purpose is primarily terrestrial signal interception and transmission. However, the variety of antennas present is a clear indication that Wajay is responsible for a reasonably complex SIGINT mission set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;calabazar&quot;&gt;Calabazar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-04887n-82195891w&quot;&gt;23° 0’48.87”N 82°19’58.91”W&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fwk5nHn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Close by, a small Cuban military complex (which is associated with the name of the nearby town of Calabazar in declassified U.S. government documents) bears the hallmarks of SIGINT operations. Over a dozen dish antennas of varying sizes are scattered throughout the secured location alongside two visible pole antenna arrays. As is often the case with military intelligence installations, the number, location, and orientation of the antennas have shifted considerably over time, likely adjusting to changes in the site’s mission set. The newest dish was installed in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without access to classified materials, pinpointing the specific targets of these assets is nearly impossible. Nonetheless, the growth of space-monitoring equipment at sites like Bejucal and Calabazar is notable given that Cuba lacks its own satellites or space program. While it could operate downlink capabilities to access satellite data for a range of applications, the types of space-tracking capabilities observed are likely intended to monitor the activities of other nations (like the United States) with a presence in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even limited access to this equipment would provide China a far greater ability to monitor and communicate with its own space assets passing above the other side of the globe. Like the United States, Russia, and Europe, China operates a global network of ground stations from which it can conduct telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&amp;amp;C) on its satellites and spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has historically lacked access to ground stations in North America. Accessing installations in Cuba could help close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuban facilities would also provide the ability to monitor radio traffic and potentially intercept data delivered by U.S. satellites as they pass over highly sensitive military sites across the southern United States. Florida alone is home to the major space-launch complex at Cape Canaveral, the headquarters of both the U.S. Southern Command and Central Command, and multiple submarine and other bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-bases-and-installations-in-florida&quot;&gt;Key Bases and Installations in Florida&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/URDrFWz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting data on activities like military exercises, missile tests, rocket launches, and submarine maneuvers would allow China to develop a more sophisticated picture of U.S. military practices. While modern military communications are highly encrypted — meaning the contents of the messages and data are hidden — information on the frequency, origin, direction, and pace of communications traffic can provide significant intelligence value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other types of data can be collected with less concern for encryption. Notably, ELINT and radar systems, like the one possibly installed at Bejucal in recent years, are within range to monitor rocket launches from Cape Canaveral and NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studying these launches — particularly those of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy reusable first-stage booster rocket systems — is likely of keen interest to China as it attempts to catch up to U.S. leadership in space launch technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intercepting the flow of commercial communications through vital economic centers across the southern United States could provide a treasure trove of data less restricted by encryption. The region hosts major research and manufacturing centers for industries such as aerospace, electronics, biotechnology, and other key strategic sectors prioritized by Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6wgg31o.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has clear political and ideological motivations to keep afloat one of the world’s few remaining Communist Party–led governments. Yet its interests there are also clearly strategic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ambitions to expand its overseas military presence are well documented, and Cuba provides an attractive foothold for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the Caribbean. An unclassified assessment by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence released in February 2024 lists Cuba as one of several countries where China is looking to establish military installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuba is currently embroiled in its worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, and Havana is in desperate need of external assistance. China has emerged as a critical lifeline, providing billions in debt relief and direct assistance in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-cuba-military-ties&quot;&gt;China-Cuba Military Ties&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UkWMl0r.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing-tied firms are also deeply embedded in Cuba’s technology sector. Chinese tech giants Huawei and ZTE — both blacklisted by the U.S. government over espionage risks — now form the backbone of Cuba’s telecommunications infrastructure. Frequent technical exchanges between Cuban and Chinese state-backed universities and technology firms likewise facilitate technology transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA and Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) have maintained regular high-level exchanges since 1999. Most recently, in April 2024 the FAR’s most senior political leader met with a top PLA official in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is no official arms trade between the countries, China has been implicated in illicit weapons transfers to Cuba. Most notably, in 2015 a Chinese civilian-flagged cargo vessel carrying explosives and munitions bound for Cuba was intercepted by Colombian police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed information about China’s presence in Cuba is scarce, and decades of speculation have made it difficult to decipher reality from rumors. Yet there are growing signs that China’s economic and political leverage may be opening doors for its military and intelligence services in Cuba. Even if China does not have direct access to facilities there, the data collected by Cuban counterparts could be readily shared with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuba’s revival as a key player in U.S. strategic competition should raise concerns in Washington and beyond. While China is unlikely to seek to establish major offensive capabilities on the island in the short term, the gradual expansion of its presence there will remain an enduring concern for policymakers in the United States and its regional partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, the Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI convened a roundtable discussion with 23 stakeholders from the public and private sectors in Europe. The event was part of RUSI’s work to raise awareness on key challenges for sanctions implementation through the European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (Euro SIFMANet), funded by the National Endowment for Democracy. The discussion centred on outlining the scope of Russian sanctions evasion activity in the virtual asset industry, as well as jurisdictional vulnerabilities that can enhance exposure to this threat, and practical steps to mitigate the risk. This conference report represents the findings discussed in the roundtable discussion. None of the discussions from the event are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opening question considered the extent to which virtual assets are being used as part of sanctions evasion strategies. Roundtable participants agreed that when comparing the current level of sanctions evasion by the Russian government within the virtual asset industry to circumvention through traditional financial institutions, the virtual asset industry is not currently a priority for transferring funds. However, the threat of sanctions on traditional financial institutions may trigger the Russian government to redirect its focus to the virtual asset industry in order to move funds, and thus coalition countries should be exploring and anticipating such activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US, for example, restricted Russian circumvention networks in 2023 when the Biden administration announced an executive order on “Taking Additional Steps with Respect to the Russian Federation’s Harmful Activities”. This executive order authorised the US Department of the Treasury to designate a foreign financial institution that has “conducted or facilitated any significant transaction or transactions for or on behalf of any person designated” for “such sectors as may be determined to support Russia’s military-industrial base”. As a result, the risk appetite of banks, particularly in China and Türkiye, may alter, resulting in their restricting support for the movement of funds on behalf of the Russian government. With these limitations in place, the Russian government may change its operations for financial transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last three years, multiple Russian-based virtual asset companies have fallen under US sanctions. This report frequently reflects upon one of these companies, known as Garantex, as the operations of this exchange dominated the roundtable discussion. In April 2022, the US designated Garantex, operating out of Moscow, on account of its “operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy”. This exchange, according to roundtable participants, continues to operate through regulatory arbitrage – that is to say, exploiting gaps in different countries’ regulations – as the international community has failed to anticipate the adaptations in sanctions circumvention techniques. There is, therefore, a critical need to identify the scope of threats and vulnerabilities related to the virtual asset industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assessing-the-scale-of-risk&quot;&gt;Assessing the Scale of Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching question of the roundtable discussion centred on whether state sponsorship of virtual asset activity is present. In the case of Garantex, the US Department of the Treasury notes that the transaction record tied to the exchange depicts the facilitation of nearly $6 million in transactions for the Russian ransomware as a service (RaaS) group Conti, and approximately $2.6 million from a darknet market known as Hydra. As noted, despite US sanctions, Garantex continues to operate by deploying different laundering methods to obscure the source of funds. However, it is not known whether such virtual asset activity can be attributed to the Russian government or oligarchs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully understand the extent of Russia’s potential circumvention activity, the international community also needs to consider the available channels for Russia’s use of virtual assets to purchase dual-use components. To carry out this process, the Russian government or third-party individuals operating on behalf of the state would most likely need to convert virtual assets to fiat currency, as there are limited suppliers that would accept virtual assets as a legitimate form of payment. Subsequently, virtual assets would be one component in the broader sanctions evasion activity of the Russian government and therefore, the integration of this avenue within traditional circumvention techniques needs evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding the threat, one roundtable participant noted that malign actors tend to rely on the same platforms and facilitators. As shown by blockchain analytic data, North Korean actors have used Garantex to obscure the origins of criminal proceeds. If an attribution is uncovered, to any degree, of Russian state sponsorship of the Moscow-based exchange, financial evidence could further confirm UN sanctions violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-concerns-for-russian-virtual-asset-focused-sanctions-evasion&quot;&gt;Key Concerns for Russian Virtual Asset-Focused Sanctions Evasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual asset-focused activity linked to potential Russian sanctions evasion includes the use of stablecoins, regulatory arbitrage, credit settlement in virtual assets, and virtual asset mining. This section outlines these avenues according to the roundtable discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stablecoins&quot;&gt;Stablecoins&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stablecoins – digital tokens that are pegged to an asset, generally fiat currency – are trending to be the preferred option for sanctions evasion, due to the lack of price fluctuation when compared to other prominent tokens. Furthermore, sanctioned entities have a greater incentive to use stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, as the US dollar still represents the primary reserve currency on an international scale, and accessing this currency through traditional means poses a challenge for such actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of this adaptation by sanctioned entities, however, is that the international community may have options to respond to the evasion due to the underlying design of features linked to the tokens. For example, Tether, a company that issues the stablecoin USDT, works with law enforcement to freeze illicit actor-linked assets. However, in regard to sanctions circumvention, this process is dependent on verifying the activity, and attribution of the individual behind the virtual asset address poses a challenge. In addition, roundtable participants noted that this solution is not always feasible. This limitation occurs if the jurisdiction where investigations take place does not have the appropriate legal provisions to enable law enforcement to carry out the freezing process in partnership with Tether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;relocation-to-other-jurisdictions&quot;&gt;Relocation to Other Jurisdictions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, Russian-based businesses have relocated to other jurisdictions, including Georgia, the UAE and Turkey. The virtual asset industry is not excluded from this movement. According to participants, Garantex moved activities to Georgia in an attempt to continue operations. However, roundtable participants noted that business operations of the exchange may be impacted, as in June 2023, the National Bank of Georgia announced the approval of a rule requiring registration of virtual asset service providers (VASPs). According to this rule, fit and proper criteria for administrators and significant share owners of the entity are required for VASPs, as well as anti-money laundering/counterterrorist financing requirements. These measures may result in the movement of Garantex once again, to a neighbouring jurisdiction that has yet to implement regulations for the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with forming shell companies in neighbouring jurisdictions, Garantex also, according to participants, produces new virtual asset addresses within a five-day period to move funds, and effectively operates as a nested exchange – a company that takes advantage of larger exchanges to service its customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;credit-settlement-in-virtual-assets&quot;&gt;Credit Settlement in Virtual Assets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants first discussed the use of virtual assets for credit settlement by the Russian government. In March 2024, Russian Federal Law No. 45-FZ, which made amendments to Federal Law No. 259-FZ on digital financial assets and digital currency, included a supplement stating that “digital financial assets may be used as a consideration under foreign trade agreements (contracts) concluded between residents and non-residents, which provide for the transfer of goods, the performance of work, the provision of services, the transfer of information and the results of intellectual activity”. Nonetheless, the definition of a digital financial asset within the legislation may not include virtual assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Federal Law No. 259-FZ, digital financial assets include digital rights “to demand the transfer of emissive securities that are provided for by the decision on the issue of digital financial assets … the issue, accounting, and circulation of which are possible only by making entries in the information system on the basis of a distributed ledger, as well as into other information systems”. A Russian-based news source argues that, despite the mention of digital ledger, a definition under which blockchain technology falls, the definition excludes cryptoassets, including Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part of this discussion involved the current activity within Russia regarding the use of virtual assets in credit settlement. In the event that sanctions evasion through this process occurs, Russia can use virtual assets as a method of credit settlement in a similar way to Iran. In January 2022, the head of Iran’s Trade Development Organization noted that virtual assets can act as a form of guarantee for small and medium-sized businesses that work with counterparts in other countries. Virtual assets, according to local news reports, would provide mutual guarantees and transfer the issuer’s credit to the importer of the goods into Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least one fintech service in Russia, B-crypto, promotes its specialisation in cross-border settlements in virtual assets. B-crypto supports Rosbank, a Russian credit institution, with conducting pilot transactions for corporate and private clients. According to a Russian news source, the process for cross-border settlements by B-crypto involves the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A Russian company that needs to pay for imported goods or services in virtual assets must provide for the token type and indicate its virtual asset address in the contract with the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A foreign supplier then issues an invoice for payment to the Russian company with a description of the goods and services, the amount in virtual assets and the address of the virtual asset wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When the parties sign a contract, the Russian customer deposits fiat money for the purchase of virtual assets into his account in Rosbank and submits an application. The funds are then transferred to B-crypto, which buys crypto in “friendly countries” and sends it to a foreign supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US designated Russian fintech service B-crypto in March 2024 for “operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;virtual-asset-mining-to-generate-revenue&quot;&gt;Virtual Asset Mining to Generate Revenue&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants identified that Russia could use natural resources to generate revenue through virtual asset mining. This process, first demonstrated by Iran, incorporates the use of cheap oil and natural gas as energy for virtual asset mining. Through the mining process, miners receive newly minted tokens that represent value on the blockchain that is not tied to previous transactions. In Iran, miners receiving the funds, according to the country’s licensing regime, are required to send funds to the central bank. These funds then support credit settlement for importing goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2022, the US sanctioned BitRiver, a company that hosts mining equipment for customers. In return for hosting the equipment, the client pays for the energy consumption and machine maintenance. According to the US Treasury, BitRiver helped Russia to “monetize its natural resources”. One participant identified that the underlying risk of generating newly minted virtual assets is that a VASP may not identify the source of funds as high risk, meaning that an individual can exchange the funds for fiat currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of undisputed Russian territory, this process is carried out by Russian individuals in illegally annexed and occupied territories. In these areas, the Russian government provides subsidised energy to keep the territory operational. Some of this energy, depending on the territory, is then fed into virtual asset mining operations to generate revenue that is free of any indication of sanctions evasion activity, and can be used to fund procurement or other illicit international Russian activity. Participants also noted that there is a potential exposure to this threat in Africa due to the presence of the Wagner Group and cheap electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a risk of virtual asset mining pools being used as a laundering mechanism. Notably, B-crypto, the fintech service in Russia, claims on its website to have “access to the largest mining pools”. Participants noted that when monitoring virtual asset mining activity, stakeholders can identify where the nodes are located and determine an estimation on the level of revenue generation, but error exists in the case of a miner using a virtual private network to obfuscate their location. To resolve this challenge, the private and public sectors need to identify where the newly minted coins are sent. Notably, in the past, new coins were perceived as more valuable, as they had less exposure to potential crimes given their brand new nature. As of 2024, this perception has changed considerably, and now new coins are seen as a risk by some VASPs. However, there is still a possibility for miners to try to develop a legitimate transaction history prior to the funds reaching a VASP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable deficiency is the lack of attention applied by jurisdictions to virtual asset mining. Virtual asset mining companies often do not fall under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) definition of a VASP due to the lack of custody of the client’s funds. As a result, some jurisdictions do not consider related risks while conducting a sectoral virtual asset risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;public-sector-challenges-and-responses&quot;&gt;Public Sector Challenges and Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulators of the industry need to understand how to identify and tackle sanctions evasion in the virtual asset industry. The roundtable participants discussed three topics in this regard: vulnerabilities that exacerbate exposure to Russian sanctions evasion activity; challenges around virtual asset regulation and enforcement; and lack of training and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When outlining general vulnerabilities that increase jurisdictional exposure to Russian sanctions evasion, participants identified that these factors include, but are not limited to: the ease of immigration for Russian nationals to that jurisdiction; the level of Russian language in the population; and lack of enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable participants then discussed challenges around virtual asset regulation and enforcement. One concern raised by participants was the pressure applied to jurisdictions by the FATF to quickly implement regulation for the virtual asset industry. The short timeline for a jurisdiction to implement the related requirements in order to avoid censure and greylisting has resulted in inefficient regulation favouring form over substance, without consideration of associated risks. Jurisdictions need to be cautious about this process and ensure that they pass legislation that they can enforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In relation to enforcement, authorities still have difficulty identifying VASPs that are operating illegally. To compound this challenge, participants said that company formation agents set up by Russian individuals are facilitating the relocation of high-risk VASPs. Along with this movement, participants noted that some high-risk VASPs have started to use obscure names for their companies to mask their involvement in virtual assets and evade oversight by designated authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges around suspicious transaction reports (STRs) also persist. The designated authority for receiving STRs in high-risk jurisdictions needs training to understand how to identify and analyse sanctions evasion activity in the virtual asset industry. However, this challenge is exacerbated if the quality of the STRs submitted by VASPs is low. Supervisors therefore need to ensure that the reports submitted by VASPs are meeting expectations and that feedback is provided to the VASP industry on how to meet those expectations. Participants noted that in some cases, VASPs dump information from blockchain analytics tools into an STR, overloading the designated authority receiving the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the roundtable discussion resulted in a question on how jurisdictions should identify which blockchain analytics tool to purchase in order to investigate suspicious activity. Each blockchain analytics company uses publicly available information on transactions and analyses it through company-specific methods, which the companies do not share, in order to keep a competitive edge. Along with separate methodologies, companies may have different data coverage and data available within their product. However, it may not be feasible for authorities in certain jurisdictions to purchase more than one tool to access the full scope of information, and therefore, investigations may be limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-sector-challenges-and-responses&quot;&gt;Private Sector Challenges and Responses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion outlined challenges and responses for blockchain analytics companies, financial institutions and VASPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blockchain-analytics-companies&quot;&gt;Blockchain Analytics Companies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants said that illicit actors have attempted to gain access to credible blockchain analytics tools in order to monitor attribution and the level of visibility of their illicit activity. To restrict access that bad actors have to their platforms, blockchain analytics providers should conduct robust know-your-customer measures and due diligence on their customers. One participant highlighted their experience of an entity connected with sanctions evasion that had attempted to gain access to a blockchain analytics tool in order to gather information. To combat this risk and strengthen their sanctions compliance, participants noted that some blockchain analytics providers have denied access to their tools for individuals located in Russia or indirectly linked to Russia, and for entities where the ultimate beneficial ownership is tied to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-institutions&quot;&gt;Financial Institutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To procure dual-use items, the Russian government or third-party individuals operating on behalf of the Russian state would most likely need to convert virtual assets to fiat currency. Therefore, financial institutions will still act as gatekeepers for restricting sanctions circumvention. To develop trust and verification for banking VASPs, some financial institutions use blockchain analytics tools. These tools can support financial institutions with identifying risk, as some include additional information on VASPs and their specific exposure to financial crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;virtual-asset-service-providers&quot;&gt;Virtual Asset Service Providers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For VASPs, a challenge can be linked to the fact that when the US Office of Foreign Assets Control lists a virtual asset address on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list, there are other unidentified addresses tied to the sanctioned address. Identifying these virtual asset addresses requires blockchain analytics tools or extensive time to uncover the unidentified addresses manually. Therefore, identifying addresses associated with the sanctioned virtual asset address takes significant resources for less mature VASPs without access to blockchain analytics tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-insights-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Key Insights and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion resulted in the following observations that international stakeholders should consider in order to restrict Russian sanctions evasion in the virtual asset industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Despite US sanctions, the virtual asset exchange Garantex still continues to operate.&lt;/strong&gt; Garantex continues operations by forming shell companies and registering in neighbouring jurisdictions, as well as producing new virtual asset addresses within a five-day period to move funds for operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The public and private sectors need to coordinate to increase the speed of response to sanctions evasion activity in the virtual asset industry.&lt;/strong&gt; It is important that VASPs are included in public-private partnerships as they are often not invited to participate. This limitation stems from the fact that such partnerships are built on a circle of trust so that information can be shared. These forums initially developed with commercial banks that have an innate distrust of VASPs, hence the latter’s exclusion. A key development that may begin to address this perception of VASPs in Europe is the introduction – and implementation – of the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding should be provided by governments to train supervising authorities within jurisdictions neighbouring Russia on how to analyse virtual asset-related STRs.&lt;/strong&gt; The process of training designated authorities on analysing STRs should provide awareness on Russian sanctions evasion typologies and ensure that there is access to the necessary resources for investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blockchain analytics providers should ensure that they closely review customers attempting to gain access to their tools.&lt;/strong&gt; Illicit actors have attempted to access blockchain analytics tools in order to monitor attributions and the level of visibility into their activities. To restrict this threat, blockchain analytics providers should consider conducting know-your-customer measures on new clients, along with due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jurisdictions need to ensure that they pass virtual asset legislation that they can enforce.&lt;/strong&gt; The short timeline for a jurisdiction to implement FATF requirements related to virtual assets – and thus avoid the risk of public censure by the FATF – has resulted in inefficient regulation without consideration of associated risks. Jurisdictions therefore need to take a comprehensive approach when developing regulation for the virtual asset industry to ensure that enforcement is feasible, and should avoid prioritising form over substance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The FATF should assess the risk posed by virtual asset mining companies falling outside its current definition of a VASP.&lt;/strong&gt; Virtual asset mining companies often do not fall under the FATF definition of a VASP due to the lack of custody of clients funds. As a result, some jurisdictions do not consider related risks while conducting a sectoral virtual asset risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the roundtable discussion identified a range of areas of vulnerability connected with the potential use of virtual assets and related infrastructure to facilitate Russia’s circumvention of both financial sanctions and procurement restrictions on high-priority items. While this may not currently be a central element of Russia’s sanctions evasion strategy, Ukraine’s allies need to ensure that, as Western sanctions on Russia tighten, the virtual asset community is equipped for what will inevitably be a growing front in the Kremlin’s sanctions evasion activity.&lt;/p&gt;

With the West in danger of losing out to Russian and Chinese influence, it is urgent to reassess what it can offer the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following more than a month of protests, on 3 May 2024, the speaker of Georgia’s parliament signed off a controversial law on “transparency on foreign influence”, better known as “the Russian law”. The new legislation obliges all non-profit and media organisations that are receiving more than 20% of funding from abroad to register as entities pursuing foreign interests. The Georgian government insists that the law does not intend to crack down on critical voices but rather ensures transparency of funding. Yet, tens of thousands of protesters as well as the president of Georgia argue that the foreign agents law resembles Russian legislation introduced in 2012 and used against dissent. Many believe that the government will weaponise the law ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled in October 2024 in order to suppress media and watchdogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;georgias-european-future-at-stake&quot;&gt;Georgia’s European Future at Stake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backlash over the foreign agents law indicates that Georgia’s current political crisis is not just about the protection of civil liberties and independent media, but has broader geopolitical implications. Once a champion of democracy in the region, Georgia’s European future is now much more uncertain. The ruling Georgian Dream party is increasingly employing anti-Western rhetoric and claiming that Western funds are in some cases being used to encourage regime change in Georgia. The ruling party’s officials have gone as far as spreading conspiracy theories regarding the alleged existence of a “Global War Party” that is pushing for a repeat of the Ukraine scenario in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia, which has remained consistently pro-European and pro-Western over the last two decades with over 89% of citizens favouring EU integration, has never experienced such a swift rise in anti-Western narratives. Ironically, this official mood swing is taking place at a time when Georgia has finally become an EU candidate country, with the prospect of opening accession talks with Brussels in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The turbulence in Georgia is a reminder to the EU of how state policy can drastically shift during the protracted waiting periods for European candidacy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of recent developments and the country’s democratic backsliding, Georgia’s EU integration process is likely to be officially paused, as indicated by a number of EU officials. According to EU High Representative Josep Borrell, the foreign agents law is “incompatible with European values”. On 24 June 2024, following a Foreign Affairs Council meeting where political developments in Georgia were discussed, Borrell clearly reiterated that unless the Georgian government changes its course of action, Georgia will not progress on the EU path. Moreover, in response to the foreign agents law, the EU is considering downgrading diplomatic relations with Georgia and freezing financial aid to the government. Yet, the law is only one example out of a set of divisive laws that the Georgian government has adopted or intends to adopt soon, making the country’s EU integration dream even more distant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Georgian parliament bypassed the presidential veto over the so-called “offshore law” which intends to encourage asset transfers from offshore accounts to Georgia through exemption on taxation until 2028. The law threatens to make Georgia a target of money laundering activities, especially from sanctioned individuals. On 4 May 2024, just a day after the foreign agents law was finally approved, the ruling party brought another piece of legislation forward targeting LGBT propaganda. This initiative comes from the same anti-Western playbook, with the government accusing Western partners of using local NGOs to spread LGBT propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the unwillingness of the government to listen to tens of thousands of protesters tirelessly rallying in the streets of Tbilisi to protect Georgia’s European future, much remains uncertain in the run-up to this year’s elections. The government of Georgia has been increasingly looking for alternative strategic partners such as China, emphasising the economic benefits of bringing Chinese investment into the country. Recently, the Georgian government announced that a Chinese consortium had won the much anticipated major strategic Anaklia deep sea port project. Yet, given overwhelming support for Georgia’s EU integration, it does not appear that Georgians see China as an alternative to the West and the billions of dollars of investment that Western countries, particularly the US and the EU, have made in democracy-building efforts in Georgia. Thus, the stakes could not be higher for the upcoming 2024 parliamentary elections, which will largely be about a choice over Georgia’s foreign policy trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-the-west-respond&quot;&gt;How Can the West Respond?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turbulence in Georgia is a reminder to the EU of how state policy can drastically shift during the protracted waiting periods for European candidacy, particularly when reinforced by rival authoritarian states interfering in domestic politics through disinformation, corruption and hard power coercion. Moreover, for the West as a whole, it is a stark warning that promises of integration are no longer enough to incentivise cooperation amid lucrative Chinese economic incentives in the form of development projects and with Russia waging potent disinformation campaigns that are effectively distorting public opinion towards Western values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tug-of-war between the West and the rest is particularly noticeable in Georgia and the wider former Soviet Union (FSU). The South Caucasus and Central Asia stand at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, and influence in these regions is key to accessing Eurasia, with the Middle Corridor developing into one of the fastest growing inter-state trade networks. Naturally, this has caught the interest of both the East and the West, with both looking to expand into Russia’s former sphere of interest. However, Western expansion is currently restricted by several factors. First, Russia’s geographic position and historic economic links within these regions still incentivises cooperation. Second, the amount of money that China is willing to throw at development projects within the FSU dwarfs what the West has offered so far. Third, there is growing evidence of state capture in several states in the FSU, such as Georgian Dream’s increasing control over Georgian institutions and media with the aim of limiting external influence from unwelcome parties, which now include the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the fact remains that with Russia embroiled in Ukraine, the West has an opportunity to get its foot in the door in the FSU. Currently, the momentum is negligible, as exemplified by UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron’s visit to Central Asia, culminating with a commitment of £50 million for “assistance” to the region. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to Uzbekistan saw over £300 million invested in the construction of a nuclear plant, a far more concrete contribution that will pay much larger political and economic dividends in the future. Similarly, France’s supply of military equipment to Armenia has done far more to influence the South Caucasus than the many years of EU “peacekeeping” along the Armenia–Azerbaijan border. If the West wants to increase its influence in the FSU, it must focus on what tangible benefits it can provide and be prepared to foot the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The sooner multipolarity in the region is embraced, the more quickly Western foreign policy can begin to compete with expanding Russian and Chinese influence&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the emerging multipolarity of the FSU, there are clear limits to the effectiveness of current EU integration policy. Decades of waiting for approval has empowered individuals with vested interests to extend their influence in domestic politics, while allowing authoritarian powers the time to sway opinion through development projects, economic investment, and disinformation campaigns. Now is the time for a policy reassessment to understand what the EU can tangibly offer these regions that can compete with Russia and China’s authoritarian advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Georgia’s drastic policy shift threatens to further destabilise the geopolitical balance in the South Caucasus. What was once a hub of pro-Western democracy has been swayed by the allure of populism, likely amplified by the geopolitical interests of Russia and China. Despite Georgian Dream’s legislative crackdown, many in Georgia still hold European aspirations, setting the scene for what will be a critical election for the future of Georgia later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity for the West to demonstrate its worth in the South Caucasus and the wider FSU. Geographic proximity, existing economic links, and an authoritarian focus on development projects mean that there is little that Western powers can do to incentivise these states to completely sever ties with Russia and China. The sooner multipolarity in the region is embraced, the more quickly Western foreign policy can begin to compete with expanding Russian and Chinese influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e4ATGpN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，共45人罪成。被控方指為組織者的戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及吳政亨5人，今（26日）續求情。代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明力陳，涉案謀劃在《國安法》生效後才違法，法庭判刑時不應考慮此前行為；又指戴雖曾具領導角色，但《國安法》後已非主腦，他不會參選立法會，也無法控制其他人行為。不過法官拒絕接納，法官陳慶偉並指，肯定戴耀廷沒有退出謀劃，指他是立法會選舉延期後，唯一一名繼續參加謀劃的組織者被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方並呈上由港大法律學院講座教授陳弘毅、和首席講師張達明等撰寫的求情信，表揚戴對港大及社會的貢獻；又力陳「非暴力」是戴一生堅信的信念，他真誠誤信否決預算案沒有違法，甚至「誤導了自己」，但他做這些事非為個人利益，而是出於畢生對法治和民主的堅定決心。不過法官陳慶偉質疑，戴耀廷指初選不違法，或是游說其他人繼續參與初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成等3人獲安排正庭旁聽&quot;&gt;鄒家成等3人獲安排正庭旁聽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。戴耀廷由資深大律師黃繼明代表，趙家賢由大律師利琛代表，區諾軒和鍾錦麟由大律師陳慕賢代表，吳政亨由大律師石書銘代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;求情5人於近10時進入法庭。吳政亨與親友做手勢，又豎起拇指。昨日有戴眼鏡的戴耀廷，今早則除下了眼鏡，看到旁聽親友時微笑揮手。區諾軒入庭時向旁聽席鞠躬，鍾錦麟向律師揮手。區諾軒、趙家賢和鍾錦麟與昨日一樣，坐在被告欄離旁聽席最遠的位置，與其他被告分隔。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於昨日在延伸庭看直播的譚凱邦、劉頴匡、鄒家成3人，則同獲安排在正庭就坐，鄒入庭後向旁聽席聳肩，並與譚和劉不住交談。其餘列席認罪被告繼續被帶到兩個延伸庭觀看直播，黃之鋒、余慧明、袁嘉蔚、吳敏兒、何桂藍、黃碧雲、黃子悅7人在二號法庭；施德來、彭卓棋、鄭達鴻、伍健瑋、梁晃維、馮達浚6人在一號法庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方法庭不應懲罰國安法前行為&quot;&gt;辯方：法庭不應懲罰《國安法》前行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明今繼續陳詞。黃強調，戴耀廷在2020年7月1日《國安法》生效前的行為絕非違法，雖然他曾被不少人批評，但這並非道德或政治的法庭，法庭判刑時不應考慮，否則是懲罰戴的合法行為，等同賦予《國安法》追溯力。法官陳慶偉指，但本案屬持續罪行；黃同意，但強調被告的協議因《國安法》才變成違法，其罪責只在於《國安法》生效後仍沒有停止。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續舉例，若他以一年時間計劃打劫，其後再與另兩名法官達成協議落實，辯方認為判刑時不用考慮他此前的計劃？法官陳慶偉補充，假設陳仲衡一直在腦海中計劃，並曾將其意圖寫在紙上，最終3名法官達成協議，那張紙能否成為證據？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃認為並非正確類比，因打劫一直都是違法行為，但否決預算案本來並非刑事罪行、也不是民事過失，只是在《國安法》下才非法。他又強調，普通法下，除非法律禁止，否則所有行為均是合法，若被告《國安法》此前的行為真有違法，肯定政府會採取行動。法官李運騰續指，控方並沒有指控被告在7月1日前違法，否則控罪日期會提前。辯方重申，法庭不應懲罰戴耀廷以往合法行為。陳慶偉則再引打劫例子，指是懲罰長久以來有預謀的串謀（very lengthy and premeditated plan），黃稱不肯定是否正確，陳則表示，肯定那是正確的做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指正在找謀劃背後的黑武士&quot;&gt;官指正在找謀劃背後的「黑武士」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，涉案計劃的規模是判刑的考慮因素，法官衡量計劃規模時，能否只審視《國安法》生效後、而非生效前的行為？黃繼明指，初選本身不違法，違法的是被告協議達成的行為，即無差別否決預算案，而該部分與戴無關，他根本不會參選，亦無法控制或指揮其他人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡即以電影《星球大戰》角色作比喻，指「35+計劃」是尋找進入立法會無差別否決預算案的35名「白兵（stormtroopers）」，而「我們正在嘗試找出謀劃背後的黑武士（Darth Vader）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方國安法後戴耀廷已非主腦&quot;&gt;辯方：《國安法》後戴耀廷已非主腦&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃繼明續指，《國安法》後，戴耀廷已非涉案謀劃的主腦、也不能再控制該謀劃，法官陳慶偉遂問，那是誰在7月1日後負責（in charge），是否區諾軒？他並指，因本案組織者只有戴和區兩人，換言之辯方是指控區諾軒。鄒家成和劉頴匡等一度望向區諾軒發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡又指，若辯方說戴耀廷在初選沒有任何角色，他7月中根本不需要宣布「休息」，黃指他的確不需要，只是作「交代」。惟法官陳慶偉明言，不接受戴在7月1日之後沒有任何角色；法官李運騰亦指，據趙家賢證供，戴在8月時仍提出望民主動力捐約100萬元予香港民研，以收集市民對否決預算案的意見。法官陳仲衡亦提出，有「三投三不投」計劃，此時譚凱邦、鄒家成和劉頴匡均大笑，吳政亨則無奈苦笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃澄清，不是指戴完全沒有角色，並接納戴7月1日前在謀劃是領導角色，但他7月1日後已不再是組織者，沒有打算進入立法會否決財案，也不能控制或指揮其他人如此做，是否參選和否決全然是其他人的決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納戴耀廷國安法後角色輕微&quot;&gt;官拒納戴耀廷《國安法》後角色輕微&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉在早休後，表示法庭不接納辯方指，戴耀廷2020年7月1日前的行為，與決定其罪責無關；亦不接納辯方指戴在7月1日後於本案只有很少或沒有角色。法庭亦無需辯方再就內地法律文件是否適用陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方呈陳弘毅張達明等求情信-指戴主張非暴力畢生追求民主法治&quot;&gt;辯方呈陳弘毅、張達明等求情信 指戴主張非暴力、畢生追求民主法治&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就戴的個人情況陳詞。辯方呈上港大法律學院講座教授陳弘毅、港大法律學院講座首席講師張達明、蘇穎智牧師及戴耀廷本人的求情信。其中陳和張讚揚戴對港大和法律界的貢獻，指戴是最高質素的法律學者，曾發布多篇有關法律的文章，不僅獲很多教學獎項，亦曾於2001年因其推動基本法及人權教育，獲政府頒授榮譽勳章。蘇牧師則指戴是基督徒，對教會有重要貢獻，亦關注警方與學生之間的衝突。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，戴一直主張非暴力，他真誠錯誤相信（genuine mistaken belief）運用否決權在《國安法》下並非違法，而他做這些事並非為任何個人利益，而是出於畢生對法治和民主、尤其是普選的堅定決心，而戴現時已知道其手段是錯誤。黃又指，非暴力是戴耀廷一生「堅定、堅定、堅定」的信念（“… non-violence has been a firm, firm, firm belief of D1 all his life.”）。法官陳仲衡指，控方本案已清楚表明串謀不涉暴力，這不是一個問題（non-issue）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方戴真誠誤信無違法或誤導了自己-官質疑&quot;&gt;辯方：戴真誠誤信無違法、或誤導了自己 官質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃繼明又引不同新聞，指案發時不同法律學者和社會人士，包括政府、湯家驊、葉劉淑儀、陳弘毅等，均無明確表明初選或否決預算案屬違法。法官陳仲衡質疑，《國安法》剛實施，無人能肯定地說某些行為是否違法。黃回應，若有人計劃在立法會放炸彈，肯定每人都能說是違反《國安法》；但本案情況正是不確定有否違法，戴當時真誠相信是合法並非不合理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續主動提到〈真攬炒十步〉一文，指迫使特首辭職只是第七步，問辯方是否記得第八至十步。翻查資料，相關步驟提及《國安法》適用香港後，街頭抗爭變激烈和出現血腥鎮壓，港人發動「三罷」令社會陷入停頓等。黃指文章是在《國安法》前寫成，只涉運用憲制權力；惟陳慶偉不同意，指文章談及暴動和示威，超出運用憲制權力。黃回應那從來並非謀劃一部分，戴亦無因此被控；而戴終其一生從沒有提倡暴力，暴力並非他的意圖、亦與本案無關，不應納入考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指，其意思不是會將此納入加刑因素，只是認為辯方不能說戴耀廷是完全無辜、擁有真誠錯誤的想法；又指戴在《國安法》生效後曾強調在普通法下違法，因他知道《國安法》是由中國制定。陳遂說，「我可能是錯的」，但指戴耀廷這樣說，或是游說其他人繼續參與初選。黃強調，戴當時是以法律學者，而非共謀者或謀劃組織者的身分發言。法官陳仲衡指，若然如此，為何戴在《國安法》後向所有參加者指不提否決每個議案？陳慶偉亦指，其他參與者或認為某程度被戴誤導。黃回應，戴「可能自己誤導了自己」，強調他當時真誠相信是違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方攬炒十步僅博弈理論-不代表一定發生&quot;&gt;辯方：「攬炒十步」僅博弈理論 不代表一定發生&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後引戴耀廷的求情信，提及「攬炒十步」只是博弈理論（game theory），屬假設的情況、非預測未來的「水晶球」，事實不一定會按照他所指的逐步發生，強調戴一直也沒有提倡暴力，若因此指他提倡或鼓勵暴力，是對他不公。法官陳慶偉則指，判詞明言戴是望推翻一國兩制，辯方說法與裁決相違。副刑事檢控專員萬德豪其後亦補充，戴認罪案情承認撰寫〈真攬炒十步〉一文，以引發血腥鎮壓和外國制裁，目的明顯顛覆政權和癱瘓政府運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指肯定戴無退出-是唯一一名繼續參加謀劃的組織者&quot;&gt;官指肯定戴無退出 是唯一一名繼續參加謀劃的組織者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃繼明續指，在中聯辦譴責初選或違法後，戴耀廷重新評估情況並於7月15日選擇退出。陳慶偉即指他沒有退出，僅說會「休息」，而且他繼續與區諾軒和趙家賢談及有關民調的事。黃指，戴仍是被動角色，並非「首要分子」和「積極參加者」。惟陳慶偉指，認為戴耀廷是立法會選舉延期後，唯一一名繼續參加謀劃的組織者被告，又認為「他可能沒有之前那樣積極參與，但他肯定沒有退出」。黃指，戴決定退出，不代表他不會見任何人，他仍要處理眾籌資金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡又質疑，戴是35+的設計者，辯方說戴宣布退出初選，為何他退出時沒有建議其他參與者一同退出？黃重申，就算戴曾是主要組織者，《國安法》後也如「共產」般，不比其他人有更大話語權。但法官則質疑，戴當時態度似乎是「我退出，但如你們想繼續，隨便」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉最後指，辯方提倡的部分論點並不被法庭接納，或需召開紐頓聆訊處理，黃表示並非挑戰任何法庭裁斷，如有不一致的地方，辯方會接受法庭裁斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指涉暴力推翻政府等方屬重行罪大&quot;&gt;辯方指涉暴力推翻政府等方屬「重行罪大」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就本案量刑，辯方認為不屬「罪行重大」，指本案不涉任何暴力行為，被告僅運用當時認為合法的憲制權力，亦有證據非民主派對否決預算案是否違法存疑。黃指，戴耀廷並非為了私利，而是爭取《基本法》訂明的普選，即使謀劃成功，亦不致推翻政府、全盤陷入混亂，因《基本法》有機制解決，最終交由選民決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，或許罪行不是最嚴重，但不代表不屬「重行罪大」。黃則回應，顛覆罪設三級刑期，認為涉暴力推翻政府、造成徹底混亂等情況，才屬「首要分子或罪行重大」的情況，本案情況不足以構成最重罪責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃指，其他量刑因素，包括戴耀廷及時認罪，可扣減三分一。針對23條生效後，除非懲教信納「不會不利國家安全」，否則國安法囚犯不得獲行為良好三分一扣減，法官李運騰則指，法庭判刑時不會考慮懲教署的評估。黃亦確認，戴是涉佔領中環串謀公眾妨擾案保釋候上訴期間干犯本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃繼明於早上完成陳詞，為戴申請下午及餘下的求情聆訊不出庭，獲法官批准。散庭時，鄒家成與戴耀廷交談，戴搖頭，戴其後隔着玻璃與律師交談，做OK手勢，其後徑直步入囚室。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，共45人罪成。被控方指為組織者的戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及吳政亨5人，今（26日）續求情。3名從犯證人區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟先後求情，辯方基於區和鍾認罪和協助控方案情，主張減刑一半。法官李運騰指，辯方或會指沒有區的證供，控方案情甚至不能成立，並問辯方會否要求更多扣減，區諾軒做交叉手勢，辯方亦稱無相關指示、區非「超級金手指」，但最終同意倡減刑50至60%。趙家賢一方則指趙盡所能協助控方，最多可獲「超級金手指」的66%減刑，法官表明不同意，質疑只適用於需承受風險作供的人，趙終改為要求減刑40%至55%。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒求減刑一半-官問要否增加減刑幅度&quot;&gt;區諾軒求減刑一半 官問要否增加減刑幅度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表戴耀廷的代表大律師黃繼明上午陳詞完畢，下午先由代表區諾軒和鍾錦麟的陳慕賢陳詞。陳指，區諾軒在《國安法》後曾採取數項措施減輕犯罪情況，包括於中聯辦譴責初選或違法後，曾嘗試與官員對話，並於2020年7月15日在 Facebook 發文宣布退出初選，區亦曾與戴耀廷等人討論，最終成功游說趙家賢於翌日退出。辯方指，由於已沒有組織者，即使其他參與者繼續推動串謀，行為亦不會有效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則指，初選於7月11至12日投票，區於7月15日退出，組織者當時已沒有什麼進一步工作可以做。辯方回應，隨著組織者退出「35+計劃」，計劃便不具合法性。李再指，抗爭派被告7月15日在無組織者下舉行記者會，辯方指區當時已退出，不會進一步陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續同意，主要減刑因素是區及時認罪，及協助控方案情，亦同意依賴區當時相信謀劃不違法。法官李運騰直言，辯方或許會說「沒有區的協助，控方案情甚至不可能成立」。官再追問，區就《國安法》刑期分級制是否適用於本案有何立場，辯方表示態度中立，但同意若有助區會採納。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指區非超級金手指&quot;&gt;辯方指區非「超級金手指」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉追問，區諾軒一方是否要求法庭給予一半刑期扣減，陳慕賢確認。法官李運騰問，認罪及協助控方作供一般可減刑一半，辯方會要求更多扣減嗎？陳否認，區諾軒亦在位置上雙手打交叉示意。李指這似乎與區的指示不一致，問辯方需否向坐在被告欄的區索取指示，陳其後表示，「那我可能要求減刑60%」，區諾軒笑着搖頭，延伸庭被告亦不禁發笑，議論紛紛。法官李運騰指辯方需提供基礎，陳慶偉則打趣問，「為何不減刑90%？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，若被告屬「超級金手指（Supergrass）」，可減刑三分之二，辯方是指區為「超級金手指」嗎？辯方指留待法庭考慮，陳慶偉着她今晚想想。不過臨散庭前，陳慕賢更改說法，望法庭採用呂世瑜案所訂下的量刑5步驟，並基於《國安法》33條，降低區的刑期等級，而若該條文不適用，則按普通法原則減刑50%至60%。陳並指沒有獲指示區屬「超級金手指」，她說罷轉身望向區，區用力點頭，又雙手抱拳。區的求情約十數分鐘。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鍾錦麟同要求減刑50-官明言證供相較區諾軒沒那麼有用&quot;&gt;鍾錦麟同要求減刑50% 官明言證供相較區諾軒沒那麼有用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鍾錦麟同樣由大律師陳慕賢代表，求情約6分鐘完成。法官陳慶偉明言，認為鍾的證供沒有區諾軒的證供那麼有用。陳解釋，這是由於鍾的參與程度有限，但他已盡所能協助控方，其證供亦加強了控方案情，因此要求法庭減刑一半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後再次提到，區諾軒和鍾錦麟均已盡力（done everything they could do），法官陳慶偉指那並非好的論點，指減刑是基於證供是否有用，而非被告是否盡力。李運騰又再稱，辯方或說「沒有區諾軒的證供，控方基本上不會有他們的案情（“Without his evidence, prosecution simply does not have his case.”）」。正庭被告欄傳來「yes」，區諾軒則向法官和鄒家成雙手打交叉，又一度與鄒家成隔空交談，並不住搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢一度要求減刑三分二&quot;&gt;趙家賢一度要求減刑三分二&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表第三被告趙家賢的大律師利琛，則要求法庭考慮趙盡所能為控方提供資料，屬「超級金手指」，可減刑66%。法官陳慶偉聞言即指趙不是，李運騰亦指，不單只要在庭上作供，還要承受個人風險才屬「超級金手指」，而趙不屬這情況。辯方遂改為要求減刑40至55%。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，作為民主動力召集人的趙家賢於2020年5月才受邀加入初選計劃，直至7月16日退出，並只是負責協助初選行政和執行的工作，例如草擬提名表格、設立票站等。辯方亦認為《國安法》第33條適用，指趙於7月中已退出，並上庭作供，為控方提供新而有用的資訊，符合「揭發他人犯罪行為」，認為法庭可歸納趙為「積極參與者」中較高的量刑，再作減刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2NY8Qfi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 趙家賢（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭李運騰問到，辯方會否依賴趙真誠誤信當時行為並非違法，辯方指趙供稱他在較後期階段加入初選，承認對「攬炒」等概念知情，會接受法庭對其罪責的判斷。法官陳慶偉則指，有證供稱趙於較早階段加入初選，他在謀劃的參與不如辯方聲稱的短，利琛表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;趙家賢求情提及2019年太古城遭咬耳-法官質疑與案無關&quot;&gt;趙家賢求情提及2019年太古城遭咬耳 法官質疑與案無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡其後主動表示，辯方的求情陳詞提及趙於2019年在太古城受襲一事，問辯方有何用意。翻查資料，趙當時被咬掉耳朵。辯方解釋，望指出趙多年來為溫和民主派，而他在事件遭受嚴重身體傷害，身心皆受創。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰質疑趙的受害人創傷報告可以如何協助求情。辯方指是顯示趙自2019年經歷多重困難。李官打斷稱與本案無關，辯方指只是想向法庭交代一般背景。李再問辯方是否想基於趙身體狀況令他坐監承受更多苦楚，而要求法庭減刑，辯方否認。趙的求情陳詞歷時約13分鐘。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/D771Zkf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，共45人罪成。被控方指為組織者的戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及吳政亨5人，今（26日）續求情。代表吳政亨的大律師石書銘表示，吳在本案僅輔助角色，他從未倡否決預算案，亦真誠相信戴耀廷稱否決預算案不違法，屬判監3年以下的「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又於庭上讀出吳政亨親撰的英文求情信，吳稱一直堅信自由民主原則，認為社會分歧需通過文明民主方式處理，而公平公正選舉最能有效防止暴政出現。吳一直對民主陣營持續內鬥痛心，認為處理的最佳方法是初選，因此對初選「無限嚮往」，亦立下決心要盡一分力，發起「三投三不投」聯署。吳自言在整個初選中，從頭到尾都是一個「局外人」，故當控方指控他是本案組織者時「我感到非常驚訝」，並強調由始至終「我支持初選從來都僅是為了初選本身」，與承諾否決預算案無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5人今完成求情，下周二（7月2日）將處理第二批被告求情，為6名港島初選參與者：袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、鄭達鴻、徐子見、楊雪盈及彭卓棋，料需時2天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方吳政亨非組織者從未倡否決預算案&quot;&gt;辯方：吳政亨非組織者、從未倡否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟今相繼完成陳詞，最後一位求情為吳政亨。代表吳的大律師石書銘指，雖然控方指稱吳為組織者之一，但隨着案中證據披露（transpire），可見吳不僅不是「組織者」，甚至不是「積極參與者」。石指，吳從一開始就是自行發起「三投三不投」計劃，過程中除了戴耀廷外沒有與其他被告溝通，其角色僅屬輔助（auxillary）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LAZlXmZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳政亨（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石又指，與其他被告不同，吳從未提倡否決預算案，其關注點從來在於初選及爭取35+，甚至曾於電郵表示拒絕將否決預算案納入「三投三不投」；即使法庭裁定戴耀廷曾與吳政亨溝通，判刑時亦不能假設二人討論的深入程度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，吳政亨至少對涉案串謀知情，石同意，但重申不能確定他的參與程度。法官陳慶偉即指，吳政亨曾花大量金錢在《蘋果日報》登頭版廣告宣傳初選，法官李運騰亦指，吳是望確保「35+」成功。石回應，15萬元廣告費算合理，而且當時社會熱切討論否決預算案，但吳的廣告只是呼籲投票予支持初選的候選人，吳的關注點仍是在初選，並止於希望35+成功，而非進一步無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳求情信堅信自由民主原則權力互相制衡&quot;&gt;吳求情信：堅信自由民主原則、權力互相制衡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續讀出吳的求情信英文版本，當中吳稱自13歲隨家人移民至澳洲，先後於當地的新南威爾斯大學獲得理學學士（主修數學）及商學碩士（主修精算）學位，並自言：「於成長過程中，我不算太熱衷政治」，但是他一直堅信自由民主原則，亦確信權力互相制衡的社會價值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2zxyrW2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳政亨（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳認為，需要通過文明及民主方式去處理社會內部的分歧，由於「權力使人腐敗，絕對權力則使人絕對腐敗」，他相信定期舉行公平公正的選舉，最能有效制衡權力，減少權力成為暴政的可能性，所以他支持香港的民主運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳香港選舉制度對民主派不利-需妥善處理內部矛盾&quot;&gt;吳：香港選舉制度對民主派不利 需妥善處理內部矛盾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳指，如民主派能在特首選舉獲勝，配合取得立法會過半數議席，就可以組建一個真正的執政聯盟，取得管治權。可是民主派面對巨大的障礙，因香港的選舉制度對民主派極為不利，導致他們過去未能憑藉選票優勢，贏得上述兩場選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳又指，一直為民主陣營內的持續鬥爭痛心，認為須妥善處理民主派的內部矛盾，而最佳方法是通過文明而民主的程序去解決，亦即是通過民主派的內部初選，因此他對初選產生「無限嚮往」，亦立下決心，「必須為實現這夢想盡一分力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳自言無名氏-對控方指控為組織者感驚訝&quot;&gt;吳自言「無名氏」 對控方指控為組織者感驚訝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳表示，儘管他「在政圈內是一個完完全全的無名氏」，但是他相信自己有權利和義務去為初選出一分力，因此發起「三投三不投」聯署。吳自言：「在整個初選過程中，從頭到尾我都是一個局外人」，包括沒有參與組織「35+計劃」、沒有參與協調會議，亦沒有在初選中參選。「因此，當控方指控我是本案的組織者之一時，我感到非常驚訝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;吳表示，由始至終，他支持初選，與承諾否決財政預算案與否並無關係，「我支持初選從來都僅是為了初選本身，與其他事宜無關」。他最後稱：「我相信法治是自由民主制度不可或缺的一部份，只有當合理的法例被制定，而這些法例被尊重和公正地執行，一個社會才有繁榮的希望。」（求情信英文全文及中文翻譯見文末）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方不能怪責吳政亨信戴耀廷稱初選合法&quot;&gt;辯方：不能怪責吳政亨信戴耀廷稱初選合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石書銘續表示，從吳政亨的公開發言和電郵，他只是「局外人」，因其個人想法而發起「三投三不投」和推動初選，並像很多同案被告一樣，依賴戴耀廷指初選和否決財案不違法的分析，愚蠢地沒有意識到《國安法》的嚴重性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石續指，《國安法》是非常新的罪行，有人對此或持保守立場，有人則較有希望，「但我們當時都是在嘗試在黑暗中找到出路，包括吳政亨。」他又指，法律意見可能是錯誤，吳政亨亦要為此承受責任，但不能怪責吳政亨或其他被告，當時相信一名顯然具資格提供意見的人，正如律師不能怪責當事人依賴自己取得最終可能錯誤的法律意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，無論如何，吳政亨冒了犯法的風險，便須承擔後果，石同意，指因此吳坐在法官席前候判，只是希望法庭寬大處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方吳政亨為其他參加者&quot;&gt;辯方：吳政亨為「其他參加者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石續指，望法庭考慮吳真誠誤信謀劃為合法而作出減刑，並指吳在刑期三級制下屬「其他參加者」。石又引顛覆罪的條文，列明顛覆行為包括推翻中國根本制度、推翻中央或香港特區政權機關等，認為相關行為才算「罪行重大」，而本案則涉非暴力手段。法官陳仲衡一度指，非暴力手段可以比暴力手段更有效，惟石認為也要考慮後果，本案所涉嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞政權機關履行職能的行為，或不涉人命傷亡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;石總結，吳雖對涉案串謀知情，但沒有參與協調會議或實際參與組織謀劃，亦沒有參選，更不會投票否決預算案，望法庭裁定他最多只是「其他參加者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳政亨求情信英文全文&quot;&gt;吳政亨求情信英文全文：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the trial I was referred to as D5 and also my alias Lee Bak Loh. I wish to tell the Court who I am, what brought me into this arena of civil and political participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born in Hong Kong in the year 1978, and migrated to Australia with my parents at the age of 13. While I was there, I graduated with the Bachelor of Science (majoring in Mathematics) and the Master of Commerce (majoring in Actuarial Studies) degrees, both from the University of New South Wales (UNSW). After graduation, I entered the financial industry. I worked in the industry, first in Australia and later in Hong Kong, for more than a decade. At no point in my life did I have affiliation with any political parties, nor did I run in any elections. I have no previous criminal records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I was never too engaged in the world of politics, as I rarely had strong opinions regarding the specifics of policies one way or another. However, I have always strongly believed in the principles of liberal democracy, and the values of checks and balances in a society. Because in any community, there will always be differences in opinions among its members, and that these differences often need to be resolved before the said community can florish. It is much preferable if these differences were resolved through civilised and democratic means, rather than through violence or oppressions. Also, because “Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely”, I believe that the holding of fair and regular elections provides the best counter balance against a power potentially becoming tyrannical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is for these reasons that I support the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, as I believe their cause of striving for democracy a noble one, and also a sensible one for the continued development of this city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was obvious to me that if the pro-democracy camp could obtain a majority in the LegCo and achieved a peaceful transfer of legislative power, it would be a huge step forward for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. This would mean that for any ordinary government bill, after examining its contents, the pro-democracy camp could choose to accept or reject it as they saw fit. This in itself would be an awesome power that they never possessed in the HKSAR’s history. If the pro-democracy camp could manage to win the Chief Executive Election as well alongside a majority in the LegCo, they could then secure a true governing coalition, and this could change the democratic landscape in Hong Kong for good, and I believe for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although clearly, there were huge obstacles to overcome before the pro-democracy camp could win either of these two elections. For one, the Hong Kong electoral system significantly disadvantaged the pro-democracy camp, and this was obviously the main reason why they could not translate their dominance in the popular votes into winning either of these two elections in the past. Yet, I thought the pro-democracy camp as a whole shouldered part of the blame as well. For too long, I had been dismayed at the continuous infighting within the pro-democracy camp, which contributed to their repeated underperformances in the elections. For the movement to proceed forward, these internal differences needed to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I explained earlier, I thought the best way to resolve such differences would be through a civilised and democratic process, and this meant a primary election within the pro-democracy camp. Once the internal differences were suitably dealt with, and unity was achieved, I thought much was possible afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was through this reasoning that I developed a passion for such a primary election. It was also clear to me that such primary election for the LegCo General Election would be very difficult to bring to fruition, evidenced by the fact that such primary election had never been successfully held in Hong Kong before the material time. I endeavoured to do my utmost to help make this pipedream into a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was, however, a glaring problem in my quest: I was a nobody in the political world. I had absolutely no name recognition among the public, nor among the political operators. This was made obvious by the fact that none of my co-defendants who gave evidence in Court knew who I was when asked. It was highly unlikely that I could make much of an impact in my endeavour. Yet, part of the beauty about democracy is that, in an election, no matter what a person’s status is, the person’s vote still counts as one vote, no more, no less. It is the voter’s right and possibly even the voter’s duty, to contribute a vote towards the total vote count, no matter how limited that contribution might be. Similarly, even though I was a complete outsider to the political world, I considered it my right, and possibly even my duty, to do something to increase the chance of a successful primary election, even if my contribution were going to be infinitesimal. It was with this mindset, that I launched the “Say No to Primary Dodgers” Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the whole process, I remained an outsider. As the Court had judged and I agreed, I did not take part in the organisation of this “Project 35+”, or any of the coordination meetings, and that I was not a candidate. That’s why I was so surprised when the prosecution accused me of being one of the organisers in this case. My relationship with D1 Prof. Benny Tai was actually more akin to the one that a lobbying group had with a policy maker, in which the lobbying effort was largely ignored. One of my main advocacies was for the participants to treat the Primary Election’s results as final, eg, since they could only realistically target three seats in the Kowloon East Constituency, in my opinion, they should allow only three primary victors there. Instead, the organisers insisted on allowing five victors in the said constituency, and planned to have a second race based on opinion polls right before the General Election. This, in my opinion, would defeat the whole purpose of having a primary election in the first place. I made repeated protestations about this to the organisers and the candidates (including the public letter forwarded by D1 to the candidates on the 20th May 2020), yet I was unable to change anything on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that among my advocacies, asking the candidates to promise to veto the Budget was never one of them. In fact, such notion never entered my mind until it became an issue in the public sphere, and it was most definitely not my original reason for supporting a primary election and launching my Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have explained earlier, I considered the benefits of the pro-democracy camp achieving a majority in the LegCo quite obvious by itself, so I never thought this additional condition was necessary, nor did I think it was even desirable to a certain extent. Since I feared that this issue would be a potentially divisive one among the pro-democracy candidates, and one that could threaten the success of a primary election being held. While I expressed delight when I thought that the candidates had reached a consensus, I explicitly stated that the exact wordings of the consensus didn’t matter. Because what delighted me was the fact that they managed to reach a consensus, which allowed a primary to go ahead, rather than the contents of the consensus themselves. It was also why, when later on I realised that some candidates had refused to sign a promise to veto the Budget, contradicting a previous claim that all of them would sign such promise, I urged people to put that issue aside and to focus on completing the primary first. Because all along, my support for a primary election never hinged on whether it was attached with a promise to veto the Budget or not. My support for a primary election had always been for itself, and itself only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, it should be noted that I had done my utmost to ensure my Campaign complied with the laws, whether they be the Election (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance, the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance, or any others. I believe that the rule of law is an essential part of any liberal democracy. It is only when reasonable laws are enacted, and that these laws are respected and justly enforced, that a society can hope to prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I urge the Court to consider the aforementioned factors when determining my sentencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;求情信中文翻譯全文轉載自吳政亨李伯盧關注組&quot;&gt;求情信中文翻譯全文（轉載自吳政亨（李伯盧）關注組）：&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在整個審訊中，我被稱為第五被告或李伯盧(我的筆名)。我希望告訴法庭我的個人背景，以及我如何踏進公民和政治運動這個領域。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我於1978年在香港出生，13歲時隨父母移民澳洲。我在當地的新南威爾斯大學(UNSW)獲得理學學士（主修數學）及商學碩士（主修精算）學位。畢業後，我投身金融行業，並先後在澳洲及香港金融機構工作超過十年。我一生中從未與任何政黨有政治聯繫，亦從未於任何選舉參與競選。我以前没有任何案底。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於成長過程中，我不算太熱衷政治，因為我對政策的細節很少持強烈意見。然而，我一直堅信自由民主原則，亦確信權力互相制衡的社會價值，因為無論在任何體制中，成員總會在某些議題上持不同意見，而通常需要先處理這些分歧，才能使該群體得以蓬勃發展。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我認為，通過文明及民主方式去處理這些分歧，總好過以暴力或鎮壓手段去解決。而由於「權力使人腐敗，絕對權力則使人絕對腐敗」，我相信定期舉行公平公正的選舉，最能有效制衡權力，減少權力成為暴政的可能性。正因如此，我支持香港的民主運動，因我相信他們對民主的追求是一個高尚目標，同時，為著這城市的持續發展，它(對民主的追求)亦是一個理性的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對我而言，明顯地，若然民主陣營能夠在立法會選舉中取得過半議席，並實現立法權力的和平轉移，這將會是香港民主運動的一大進步。這意味在任何一般政府議案上，民主陣營在審查其內容後，可以按他們的判斷選擇通過或否決該議案。這是民主陣營在香港特別行政區史上，從未擁有過的重大權力。如果民主陣營能在行政長官選舉上同時獲勝，配合立法會內的過半議席，就可以組建一個真正的執政聯盟，取得管治權。這將對香港的民主格局產生永久性影響，我亦相信這將會是正面的影響。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;然而，在民主陣營能夠贏得兩項選舉其中任何一項之前，顯然還有巨大的障礙需要克服。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首先，香港的選舉制度對民主陣營極為不利，這絕對是民主陣營過去未能憑藉選票優勢，贏得這兩場選舉的最主要原因。但我認為民主陣營總體來說，亦需為他們的落敗承擔某程度上的責任。
在過去一段太長的時間，我都一直為民主陣營內的持續內鬥痛心，這內鬥一直令民主陣營在選舉上，屢屢無法發揮最佳表現。而為了香港民主運動的前景，這些內部矛盾必須妥善處理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如前所述，我認為處理這內部矛盾的最佳方法是通過文明而民主的程序去解決，亦即是通過民主陣營的內部初選。當這些內部矛盾得到妥善處理，而民主陣營內一眾人士能齊心向前，我認為再困難的目標都有達成的可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;基於這個心路歷程，我對以上所形容的初選產生無限嚮往。但我亦明白，針對立法會大選的全民主陣營初選極難實行，觀乎在案發之前，此類初選從未能成功舉辦過，它的難度由此可見一斑。於是我立下決心，必須為實現這夢想盡一分力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;然而，即使我希望出一分力，也要面對一個明顯的障礙—我在政圈內是一個完完全全的無名氏。無論在公眾層面、政圈中人眼中，我都沒有任何知名度。從本案所有上庭作供的同案被告作證時，被問及有關本人的事情，都表示在案發時不認識我，這明顯地證明了上述說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;以我的身份，對於在實現初選的過程中，能夠產生任何實質影響力的機會極微。不過，民主的其中一個可敬之處，就是在選舉中，無論投票者的身位地位如何，那一票都是算作一票，不多也不少。即使每一票的實質影響力有限，每一個選民都有權利，甚或可能是有義務，去貢獻這神聖一票。同樣地，儘管我在政治世界中完全是局外人，可以做到的是多麼的微不足道，我相信我有權利，甚至可能是我有義務，去為初選出一分力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而我正正是抱着如此信念去發起「三投三不投」聯署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在整個初選過程中，從頭到尾我都是一個局外人。正如法庭判詞所指、而我亦同意，我沒有參予組織「35+計劃」、沒有參予協調會議，亦沒有在初選中參選。因此，當控方指控我是本案的組織者之一時，我感到非常驚訝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我與第一被告戴耀庭教授的關係，實際上更像一個被無視的遊說團體與決策組織的關係。我其中一個主要倡議是「應將初選結果視為最終結果」。以九龍東選區為例，由於民主陣營在大選時，實際上最多只可望獲得三席，因此我認為初選時該區只應有三個優勝名單。可是，組織者堅持允許該選區有五個優勝名單，並計劃在大選前再以民調作第二輪競賽。對我而言，這做法與初選的意義背道而馳，我為此多次向組織者及參選人提出抗議（包括第一被告於2020年5月20日向參選人轉發的公開信），但我無法在此帶出任何改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;值得注意的是，在我的倡議中，要求參選人承諾否決財政預案從來都不是其中之一。說實在，在這成為公眾議題之前，我根本從來沒有這個想法，這亦絕對不是我當初支持初選及發起聯署的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;正如前文所說，我認為民主陣營獲得立去會過半議席，本身已是足夠明顯的好處，所以我從沒有想過需要更多額外條件。在某程度上，我甚至不認為這額外條件可取。因為我害怕這議題可能會在民主陣營參選人當中引發爭議，從而威脅到初選的實現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當我認為參選人同意「共同綱領」時，我表示高興，但亦有明確表明我認為「協調成功」四字已是大快人心，根本無需看細節。因為令我高興的是參選人終於達到共識，令初選能夠順利舉行，而不是共識的內容本身。這亦解釋了當我之後得知「某些初選參選人拒絕簽署承諾否決財政預算案」，發現與之前「所有參選人都願意簽署」這一說法有所出入時，我懇求大家將這爭議放一旁，希望大家先聚焦於完成初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;因為由始至終，我支持初選從來無關承諾否決財政預算案與否—我支持初選從來都僅是為了初選本身，與其他事宜無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;最後值得留意的是，我一直盡我所能去確保「三投三不投」團隊遵守所有法律，無論是《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》、《預防及控制疾病條例》或其他任何法律。我相信法治是自由民主制度不可或缺的一部份。只有當合理的法例被制定，而這些法例被尊重和公正地執行，一個社會才有繁榮的希望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;我懇求法庭於決定本人刑期時考慮以上所述因素。&lt;/p&gt;

But what security role should Washington seek from its European allies in the region?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has long sought to focus Europe’s attention on the rising challenge posed by China in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. This effort began with a social media post before the administration even took office, when incoming national security advisor Jake Sullivan expressed concern over an EU-China investment agreement in December 2020. A few months later, Secretary of State Antony Blinken mentioned China 11 times in a speech at NATO headquarters about efforts to shape American alliances; he mentioned Russia only four. On a range of fronts and through multiple vehicles, including the Group of Seven (G7), Washington has worked with European and Indo-Pacific partners to build an agenda to reduce critical dependencies on China and build the capacity to resist economic coercion. However, despite Washington’s pressure on Europe to focus on China’s economic challenge, it has been less clear what the United States seeks from Europe militarily in the Indo-Pacific region — other than “more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. engagement has been effective in aligning European perspectives and approaches to the region. China is now a major focus of transatlantic discussions and European countries have prioritized developing a common approach. Although the shift is uneven, from London to Berlin to Rome most European capitals are adopting a tougher approach to managing the economic relationship with China — as shown by the European Union’s ongoing investigations into potential Chinese dumping of electric vehicles, medical devices, and solar panels. European countries are also deepening engagement with Indo-Pacific partners on issues related to economic security. Japan and the European Union are cooperating to promote supply chain resilience in critical sectors like semiconductors, for example, in a shared effort to reduce dependence on China — a dialogue that is more advanced than it is with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the picture is less clear on defense and security issues, with little consensus or focus on how Europe should deepen its engagement with countries in the Indo-Pacific. The leaders of several close U.S. allies and partners in the region — Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea — have begun regular participation in the annual NATO summit, a significant development pushed by the Biden administration. But the ultimate purpose of this engagement remains unclear, and other steps — such as the purported plans to establish a NATO office in Tokyo in 2023 — have proven controversial and were opposed by several member states. The United Kingdom, through the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United States and the Global Combat Aircraft Program (GCAP) with Japan, has stepped up engagement with Indo-Pacific partners. Yet other instances of defense engagement by European countries in the region have been mostly ad hoc and symbolic, such as the passing exercises with Asian partners through the European Union’s Operation ATALANTA, including with the Pakistani navy in June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This picture of unfocused engagement and occasional mixed messages begs the question: What security role should the United States seek for Europe in the Indo-Pacific? Can European partners make a meaningful contribution to deterrence and contingency response in the region, and if so, how? Are the potential benefits of enhanced engagement worth the cost, given the ongoing war in Ukraine and the security needs of Europe? And more broadly, how should Europe engage the Indo-Pacific on defense and security issues?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report aims to address these questions. It finds that Europe has a significant interest in upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific and can contribute to regional security in targeted ways. The deepening cooperation and engagement between Moscow and Beijing underscores that security in Europe and the Indo-Pacific are linked — a reality that South Korea and Japan have clearly recognized through their strong support for Ukraine. In principle, a deeper European role in Indo-Pacific security would therefore be a welcome development and should be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Europe’s role in the region in the near term is constrained by its limited military means and by the direct and intensifying challenge posed by Russia. Europe’s priority should therefore be to ensure its own security in the face of the Russian threat, and to build the capacity to enable the United States to shift focus and respond effectively in the event of a military contingency or crisis with China. The driving focus of European defense planning and procurement should be ensuring that Europeans can provide more for their own security at a time when U.S. military capabilities are needed elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the need for Europe to focus on ensuring its own security does not make countries in the region irrelevant to security in the Indo-Pacific. Indeed, in addition to Europe’s extensive economic and diplomatic ties, European countries — particularly the United Kingdom and France — have important military resources, including space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and cyber capabilities, that can supplement those of the United States and Indo-Pacific allies on the margins. A revived European defense industrial base could provide a vital boost to global defense materiel production and increase the credibility of U.S. alliances globally. European arms sales and security assistance could also directly support capacity building among allies and partners in the region. Finally, the maintenance of a European defense presence in the region, however modest and if employed with purpose, can reinforce international law and send an important signal to China about the potential costs of aggression, particularly if that presence is linked to the European Union’s economic strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The driving focus of European defense planning and procurement should be ensuring that Europeans can provide more for their own security at a time when U.S. military capabilities are needed elsewhere.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the longer term, the United States should seek to provide pathways for an expanded European role. European rearmament is underway, meaning that where Europe is today does not reflect where it will be in 5 to 10 years. Thus, Europe may be able to contribute much more over time to Indo-Pacific security, as its capacity grows and if the Russian threat recedes. The United States should keep this in mind when considering its longer-term defense planning in the Indo-Pacific and should seek to shape European defense planning and transatlantic defense industrial engagement with an eye toward a potentially larger role in the Indo-Pacific over time. In short, encouraging and incorporating a greater European defense role in the Indo-Pacific should be part of a longer-term strategy toward the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report will first outline Europe’s strategic dilemma, in which it must balance significant interests in a stable Indo-Pacific with the imperative of deterring a revanchist and aggressive Russia on its eastern flank. It will describe the view from the Indo-Pacific, in which a broad demand for more European defense engagement is tempered by a desire to avoid dividing the region into blocs. The report will then explore the potential vehicles for Europe’s military engagement with the Indo-Pacific region and how these relate to U.S. regional interests. Finally, it will provide recommendations for what the United States should seek from its European allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-links&quot;&gt;Economic Links&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s stake in a free and open Indo-Pacific is vast, and a conflict over Taiwan or in the South China Sea would directly impact its security and prosperity. The EU market is roughly equivalent in size to the United States or China, making it a key economic partner with countries throughout the region. Around 40 percent of the European Union’s foreign trade passes through the South China Sea, for example. Between 2011 and 2021, imports from the Indo-Pacific to the European Union increased 64 percent, from €515 billion (about $474 billion) to €844 billion ($776 billion), while exports grew 44 percent, from €407 billion ($374 billion) to €583 billion ($536 billion). The European Union is also the largest investor in the region, which includes four of the bloc’s top global trading partners: China, Japan, South Korea, and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, any action taken by China to seize control of Taiwan or to threaten international maritime traffic in the South China Sea would directly affect European citizens in the region. The Indo-Pacific is home to millions of European citizens, including 1.8 million French and at least 1.7 million British across the region and more than 30,000 Europeans living in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is keenly aware of the importance of Europe’s market and has consistently sought to undermine efforts within the European Union to forge a common trade and economic policy toward China. As such, China has worked to cultivate relations with individual European countries, most notably Germany, Europe’s economic powerhouse, and Italy, which initially signed on to the Belt and Road Initiative before recently withdrawing. China has also sought to create a new multilateral form of engagement with both EU and non-EU countries in Eastern Europe, called the 17+1, which was a deliberate effort to divide Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, China has sought to target European countries pursuing policies at odds with Beijing’s interests. For example, China imposed severe import restrictions on goods from Lithuania after the Baltic country withdrew from the 17+1 grouping and allowed Taiwan to establish a new trade office in Vilnius. After the Netherlands joined with the United States to restrict exports of high-end semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, Beijing imposed export controls on critical minerals that are crucial to the European Union’s digital and green transitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union, with the authority to negotiate trade deals, regulate its single market, and impose sanctions, has recently taken the lead in forging a more collective European strategy toward China. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has championed a “de-risking” approach to mitigate critical dependencies and supply chain vulnerabilities, while avoiding the economic damage of a more comprehensive decoupling of trade ties. More broadly, the 2021 EU Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific aims at a free and open Indo-Pacific for all while building strong and lasting partnerships in areas including security and defense, ocean governance, and the green transition. To protect individual EU countries vulnerable to economic coercion, Brussels also created a new anti-coercion instrument that could allow the European Union to impose trade restrictions, such as higher import tariffs or limited access to EU public tenders. The European Union also passed a Critical Raw Materials Act specifically to reduce its reliance on China for key inputs to Europe’s manufacturing base for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other green goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-ties&quot;&gt;Defense Ties&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Militarily, European countries have significant capabilities that in theory could be valuable in the event of an Indo-Pacific contingency. For example, European countries collectively possess 116 large naval surface combatants and 66 submarines as of 2021. Despite significant gaps compared to its U.S. ally, European forces also possess air enabling capabilities, including roughly 35 command and control (C2) platforms, about 150 air-to-air refueling aircraft, a few dozen reconnaissance aircraft, and roughly 200 uncrewed aerial vehicles. European states collectively possess sizeable fleets of fifth-generation fighter jets, which could augment American air power. Europe’s defense industrial capacity is also ramping up following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two European countries, France and the United Kingdom, operate regularly in the Indo-Pacific region and maintain significant capabilities there. France has long been Europe’s most prominent actor in the region, through its overseas territories, permanent forces in both the Indian and Pacific oceans, regular multipurpose deployments, and strong cooperation and arms sales with strategic partners, including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, and Singapore. France has 7,000 permanently stationed personnel (4,100 across the United Arab Emirates, Djibouti, and La Réunion and Mayotte Islands in the Indian Ocean and 2,900 across New Caledonia and French Polynesia in the Pacific Ocean) with substantial capabilities, including fighter jets, surveillance frigates, and tactical transport aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom also plays a significant role in the region. As then foreign secretary Boris Johnson declared in 2016: “Britain is back east of Suez.” Although the United Kingdom’s current military assets in the region are limited, London has prioritized engagement with the region through several long-term military agreements. Its participation in the AUKUS initiative will see it increase its military role, such as through presence in the Submarine Rotational Force-West out of Australia. Additionally, during then defense secretary Ben Wallace’s visit to Japan in 2021, the United Kingdom announced that it would permanently deploy two patrol vessels to the region, now hosted in Singapore. This followed the deployment of a carrier strike group to the region led by the HMS Queen Elizabeth which included U.S. and Dutch warships, designed to demonstrate freedom of navigation rights under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The deployment included joint exercises with Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Singapore under the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) established in 1971. Britain also concluded a Reciprocal Access Agreement with Japan in 2023 and has committed to a regular trilateral exercise with Japan and the United States beginning in 2025. And as noted, the United Kingdom is working with Italy and Japan under the GCAP program to develop a sixth-generation stealth fighter jet by 2035. For both France and the United Kingdom, European security remains the priority focus — but both have stepped up in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, a broader range of European countries has undertaken episodic long-distance deployments in the area. Following the release of the European Union’s 2021 Indo-Pacific strategy, Germany and the Netherlands deployed military vessels to the region for the first time. German defense minister Boris Pistorius described the Indo-Pacific as “the most strategically important region on Earth,” in which “decisions about freedom, peace, and prosperity in the world are made.” Aircraft from Germany, France, and Spain — together representing the trinational Future Combat Air System, expected to reach full operational capacity by 2040 — will depart on a major exercise tour across the Asia-Pacific in mid-2024 to deepen ties with regional partners. Italy is also ramping up its Indo-Pacific engagement, with plans to send its carrier strike group to the Rim of the Pacific exercise in June–July 2024. These deployments send a message by the participants that they reject China’s maritime claims, they are committed to upholding UNCLOS, and there will be costs to future aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this increased military activity by European states sends a useful message to Beijing, what does it say about Europe’s potential role in a regional contingency? Some scholars contend that European states have critical capabilities that could be brought to bear in the defense of Taiwan and should be the focus of concrete military planning. For example, Luis Simón, Daniel Fiott, and Octavian Manea argue that “Europeans can play a strategically meaningful military contribution in the Indo-Pacific, both in peacetime and wartime. The subsurface domain would be particularly critical in any Indo-Pacific contingency, and the combined UK and French subsurface nuclear (SSN) force would constitute around 15–20 percent of the U.S. one, and far above anything U.S. regional allies may be in a position to bring to bear within the next decade at least.” After China carried out live-fire exercises surrounding Taiwan in July 2022, Admiral Pierre Vandier, former head of the French navy, noted that “against the Chinese navy, we will win if we fight together, in coalition” during a hearing in the French parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet U.S. military leaders planning and preparing for a possible conflict over Taiwan are focused almost exclusively on the role of allies who would be close to the fight. Although South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the Philippines would all be directly impacted by a conflict, the degree to which Washington can rely on even them to support U.S. military operations remains open to question. This uncertainty complicates U.S. military planning in a region that lacks a multilateral alliance structure with a unified chain of command. Attempting to comprehensively incorporate European partners, whose willingness and ability to contribute is even less certain, into U.S. military planning for a conflict over Taiwan has therefore not been a U.S. priority. In sum, Europe’s growing defense engagement in the region is useful from a messaging standpoint but will do little to reinforce deterrence or contribute if it remains episodic and unconnected to concrete contingency planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In sum, Europe’s growing defense engagement in the region is useful from a messaging standpoint but will do little to reinforce deterrence or contribute if it remains episodic and unconnected to concrete contingency planning.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-view-from-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;The View from the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their part, all major U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific are pursuing deeper security engagement with European partners, as part of a larger strategy that acknowledges the linkages between security in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s December 2022 National Defense Strategy, for example, states, “With partners like the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy, Japan will mutually reinforce involvement in global security issues as well as challenges in Europe and Indo-Pacific.” In an opinion piece published in 2023, then foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi wrote, “Japan will fundamentally reinforce its defense capabilities and strengthen cooperation with NATO and other like-minded countries, in order to shore up and defend the free and open international order based on the rule of law.” The European Union also maintains a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Japan that spans a wide range of economic and security issues and is arguably the most comprehensive of all European partnerships with Indo-Pacific countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Seoul, the government of President Yoon Suk Yeol has sought to build ties with NATO in part as a response to the UN Security Council’s inability to address North Korean provocations in the face of obstruction by China and Russia since early 2022. Facing this deadlock, South Korea seeks new global governance institutions and partners to address the growing threats from Pyongyang. South Korea’s national security strategy, released in April 2023, states, “The European Union (EU) and European countries share universal values with the Republic of Korea, [and] . . . the Yoon Suk Yeol administration seeks to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with Europe on global issues and build a value-based diplomatic partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia demonstrates a similar approach. Its 2023 Defence Strategic Review notes, “We must also enhance . . . engagements with the E.U., its member countries, and NATO.” The strong support to Ukraine offered by Japan, South Korea, and Australia was aimed at strengthening relations with Europe, with the expectation that Europe would provide similar support in the face of aggression in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, U.S. partners in the Indo-Pacific are at times ambivalent about the proper role of European partners in the region’s security and the best means to operationalize that role. While U.S allies have embraced a closer relationship with NATO outside the region, countries in Southeast Asia and among the Pacific Islands are wary of strengthening formal arrangements that could signal a region dividing into blocs — a sentiment China has actively sought to promote. In response to media reports that NATO was considering opening an office in Tokyo — an initiative that fizzled in the face of backlash from France and in the region — China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson asserted, “NATO’s attempt to make eastward inroads into the Asia-Pacific will inevitably undermine regional peace and stability. The countries and people in this region are on high alert against this and firmly oppose any words or actions designed to bring military blocs into this region and stoke division and confrontation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However far-fetched, these arguments have resonance in parts of the region. In a May 2022 interview, then Singaporean prime minister Lee Hsien Loong commented, “Countries in Asia, many of them enjoy good ties with China, as well as with the US and the US’ treaty allies. . . . I think that is a better configuration than one where countries are divided along a line and one bloc confronts another.” He added, “That is the history in Europe, but it has not been the history in Asia. And I think it is better that it remains not.” In response to the reports about the possibility of a NATO office in Tokyo, an Indonesian diplomat wrote, “NATO has little to contribute toward stability in the Asia-Pacific region . . . bringing NATO to Asia will do more harm than good.” Participants from multiple countries in a CSIS study group voiced similar caution about the downside of deeper NATO engagement in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, while many Indo-Pacific partners — particularly U.S. treaty allies — in principle welcome deeper European defense and security engagement in the region and are pursuing their own deeper ties with NATO, how and where that engagement is executed, and through what structures, matters. This ambivalence serves to reinforce a key point: the concrete benefits to Indo-Pacific security of deeper European engagement — through strategic messaging, contingency planning, or capacity building — must outweigh the downside risk of playing into Chinese narratives on the “NATO-ization” of Asia, particularly in light of the need for Europe to sustain a focus on the security challenge posed by Russia in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The concrete benefits to Indo-Pacific security of deeper European engagement — through strategic messaging, contingency planning, or capacity building — must outweigh the downside risk of playing into Chinese narratives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-bear-in-the-room-what-would-russia-do&quot;&gt;The Bear in the Room: What Would Russia Do?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dilemma for Europe is that while it does have military capacity that can contribute to deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and can be helpful at the margins in responding to aggression, it also faces a revanchist and irredentist threat from Russia. While Russian president Vladmir Putin will not remain in office indefinitely, as long as Russian foreign policy adheres to its anti-Western and revisionist outlook, Europe will have to remain on guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow would likely see Chinese military aggression as creating opportunities for Russia to exploit. Sino-Russian relations may fall short of an established alliance. But Chinese support for Russia, while perhaps less than what Russia initially hoped for — particularly in terms of direct military assistance — has proven vital to Russia’s war effort by reviving and ramping up Russia’s defense industry. In the event of a conflict over Taiwan, China would have a military interest in encouraging opportunistic aggression from Russia to create dilemmas for the United States in Europe and stretch U.S. forces. Moreover, the Kremlin would be eager to see a U.S. military defeat in the Indo-Pacific and would likely want to challenge or threaten Europe’s security architecture. Moscow is also willing to take risks in its deployment of military force, as demonstrated not just by its invasion of Ukraine, but also in its intervention in Syria, its use of a chemical weapon to assassinate Russian dissidents on UK soil, and the proliferation of Russian “private military contractors” in Africa to support anti-Western military leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the event of a conflict over Taiwan, China would have a military interest in encouraging opportunistic aggression from Russia to create dilemmas for the United States in Europe and stretch U.S. forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the potential for Russia to directly threaten European security and NATO would likely increase significantly in the event of a conflict in the Indo-Pacific. For example, in this scenario Russia might be more willing to gamble that the United States would be unable to respond decisively to a lightning attack on the Baltics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;us-overstretched&quot;&gt;U.S. Overstretched?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing debate about whether global demands on the U.S. military are overstretching its capabilities, particularly in responding to a conflict over Taiwan. While it is beyond the scope of this report to fully address this debate, it is fair to assume that a potential conflict with China over Taiwan would be all-consuming for the United States. China’s military buildup, including its modern rocket forces, space and cyber capabilities, advanced naval combatants, and large numbers of advanced fighter, bomber, and uncrewed aircraft would pose a major challenge to the United States and its Indo-Pacific allies. The United States would need to guard against the risk of opportunistic aggression within the region as well, as North Korea could seek to exploit a conflict over Taiwan to advance its interests on the Korean Peninsula. Europe and NATO should assume any conflict with China would stretch American military capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States would undoubtedly pull significant military assets out of the European theater to support a major campaign to defend Taiwan. These would likely include aircraft carriers operated by the U.S. Sixth Fleet headquartered at Naval Support Activity Naples and enabling capabilities such as airborne C2 and air-to-air refueling — where Europe lags far behind the United States. Moreover, the war in Ukraine has revealed both the massive quantity of munitions needed in a conventional conflict and Europe’s shockingly limited stockpiles. An Indo-Pacific contingency would consume vast quantities of U.S. munitions and defense materiel to the detriment of Europe, as the United States would be either unable or unwilling to supply considerable munitions to the European forces. As an example, a recent CSIS study found that the United States would likely consume the entirety of its inventory of Long-Range Anti-ship Missiles (LRASM) in a week during a conflict over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;An Indo-Pacific contingency would consume vast quantities of U.S. munitions and defense materiel to the detriment of Europe, as the United States would be either unable or unwilling to supply considerable munitions to the European forces.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia could seek to take advantage of the shift in U.S. posture. Thus, the prospect of the United States pulling assets out of the European theater makes European participation in an Indo-Pacific contingency potentially challenging given the renewed threat posed by Russia on Europe’s eastern flank and Europe’s limited capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-ii&quot;&gt;Part II&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;objectives-for-european-defense-engagement-in-the-indo-pacific&quot;&gt;Objectives for European Defense Engagement in the Indo-Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main contribution Europe could make to Indo-Pacific security in the short to medium term, given the continuing threat posed by Russia, is to alleviate the demands on U.S. forces by strengthening Europe’s own capacity for its defense at home. This will require significant resources and a change in emphasis of European procurement efforts and in how the United States approaches NATO and European security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while Europe’s military focus should be on NATO’s area of responsibility, that does not preclude a European contribution to the Indo-Pacific, particularly over the medium to long term. If Russia is deterred from military action and distracted and consumed by the war in Ukraine, or should a less anti-Western government emerge in Moscow, that may free up important European resources for the Indo-Pacific. As such, while the near-term focus of U.S. efforts should be on encouraging Europeans to build forces to deter Russia, the United States should not preclude European involvement in an Indo-Pacific contingency and should engage European partners in a discussion of requirements during a crisis. Furthermore, over the longer term, a Europe rearmed with capable and ready forces may be able to significantly contribute to security in the Indo-Pacific. That means the United States should seek to deepen European defense engagement with the region and expand the connections of European defense partners with the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) in Hawaii. These efforts should be undertaken bilaterally or with small groups of European partners — and not through NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;europes-core-military-role-cover-the-flanks&quot;&gt;Europe’s Core Military Role: Cover the Flanks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world of rapidly growing Chinese military power in the Indo-Pacific and a proximate Russian threat in Europe, some geographic division of labor between the United States and its European allies is inevitable. Rather than avoid discussion of this reality, the United States and its European allies should acknowledge and explicitly plan for it. Doing so does not mean that the United States should focus solely on security in the Indo-Pacific; the United States can and should sustain a central role in European security for the foreseeable future, even as it dedicates increasing resources to the potential threat posed by China. Nevertheless, it is time for the United States and Europe to engage in a frank dialogue about priorities and trade-offs in U.S. force posture globally, and to prepare European partners for the need to sustain deterrence under conditions that involve a smaller U.S. presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is time for the United States and Europe to engage in a frank dialogue about priorities and trade-offs in U.S. force posture globally, and to prepare European partners for the need to sustain deterrence under conditions that involve a smaller U.S. presence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Washington should press Europe to prepare to deter Russia with less U.S. support.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States has not been frank with its NATO allies about the impact a war in the Indo-Pacific would have on its presence in Europe. The force planning construct underpinning the United States’ 2022 National Defense Strategy assumes a military that is sized to prevail in conflict against a peer competitor — with China identified as the pacing challenge — while employing “a range of risk mitigation efforts” to deter opportunistic aggression elsewhere. However, these statements remained largely undefined, and the reality is that a conflict with China would almost certainly precipitate major adjustments in U.S. force posture globally, including in Europe. The inclination of U.S. officials is to reassure NATO allies of its steadfast commitment to their security, regardless of global conditions, but doing so evades a necessary discussion of how a conflict in Asia would inevitably impact U.S. presence in Europe. In fact, an Indo-Pacific contingency greatly increases the potential for Russian aggression in Europe. This is the scenario that NATO and Europe need to prepare for — one in which Europeans are required to defend themselves while the United States is focused elsewhere. NATO planning must begin to consider the realistic possibility of opportunistic aggression by Russia in the event of a conflict over Taiwan or on the Korean Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States should clarify to NATO allies the impact an Indo-Pacific contingency would have on the European theater.&lt;/strong&gt; Requirements for U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific depend on the scenario, but a significant draw on a range of capabilities — particularly air, naval, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets — would seem nearly certain. It is critical that the United States attempt to give some clarity to NATO in order to provide direction to European procurement and planning efforts. As a general principle, the United States should take steps to be more transparent with European and Indo-Pacific allies about joint strategic planning and information sharing to live up to its commitment to make allies and partners a “center of gravity” in its 2022 National Defense Strategy. This will require a far more forward-leaning approach to information sharing on contingency planning than exists today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;European defense spending should focus on addressing potential gaps left by the United States.&lt;/strong&gt; Defense spending by EU member states increased by 6 percent in 2022 compared to the previous year, reaching a record €240 billion ($260 billion). But European countries are not concentrating their efforts on procuring capabilities that can help mitigate the gaps that would be left by the United States in the event of a crisis elsewhere. U.S. engagement should encourage them to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Europe should help secure sea lanes of communication and key maritime choke points.&lt;/strong&gt; As the United States surges naval assets to the Indo-Pacific, Europe could help fill the gap. Simón, Fiott, and Manea argue, “Europeans can contribute by securing the sea lanes of communications in the Indian Ocean, which would be important in an Indo-Pacific contingency, but also in other important areas like space and ammunition, as well as investing in a common pool of inter-theater capabilities.” For instance, five European countries have military bases in Djibouti, as do the United States and China. Securing the entry point into the Indian Ocean from the Red Sea would be an allied priority and could be a focus for European militaries. Additionally, European naval forces could help deter opportunistic aggression from Iran and help ensure trade continues to flow from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;europeanindo-pacific-security-defense-cooperation-and-engagement&quot;&gt;European–Indo-Pacific Security, Defense Cooperation, and Engagement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as NATO and European states should focus on preparing to defend the continent with less U.S. support, there remain meaningful ways that they can contribute to deterrence and stability in the Indo-Pacific — and over the long term, the potential for significant contribution to security in the region is very real. European engagement in the Indo-Pacific should be targeted, and for the most part executed outside a NATO framework. As such, the United States should consider the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep NATO out of the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; The downside of direct NATO engagement in the Indo-Pacific probably outweighs the benefits. The more than 30 members of NATO hold widely different views of China, a fact that would undermine the alliance’s ability to forge a meaningful agenda for the region. NATO engagement also risks playing into Chinese narratives regarding purported U.S. efforts to divide the world into competing blocs. With the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Europe’s security situation and NATO’s focus has reverted to its original raison d’etre, protecting Europe and deterring Russia. This is where it should remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, bring the Indo-Pacific to NATO instead.&lt;/strong&gt; On the other hand, the growing engagement of Indo-Pacific allies with NATO in Europe should be welcomed and expanded. The attendance of the IP4 countries at NATO summits (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea) has demonstrated solidarity with Ukraine and support for European security. Indo-Pacific engagement with NATO could be a vehicle for valuable information sharing and exchange on Chinese and Russian threats and help to narrow gaps in perceptions across regions. It could facilitate increased coordination and set common standards for weapons production, such as munitions that could then be used interchangeably among countries. NATO can also provide important lessons learned on opportunities and challenges of coalition warfighting. Engagement could be expanded beyond the IP4 to include other likeminded allies and partners in the region, such as the Philippines and Singapore — should they express interest in joining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on building deeper and denser partnerships between Europe and the Indo-Pacific at the bilateral or “minilateral” level.&lt;/strong&gt; Europe’s direct military engagement with the Indo-Pacific should be primarily done by individual European states. Thus, the United States should support expanded bilateral military-to-military and political-to-military engagement between European and Asian partners and expand efforts to engage and incorporate willing partners into defense planning. Instead of seeking to develop a formal multilateral structure for this engagement, such as a European “Quad” to engage the existing Indo-Pacific Quad (consisting of the United States, Japan, India, and Australia), the United States should encourage more organic cooperation. For instance, along the sidelines of the annual Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, European defense officials could arrange a structured dialogue with their Indo-Pacific counterparts, with or without U.S. participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand coordination and engagement between Europe and INDOPACOM.&lt;/strong&gt; Incorporating a more significant role for Europe militarily in the Indo-Pacific necessitates a greater presence in Hawaii at INDOPACOM. Having a broad and robust global coalition of allies and partners committed to promoting regional stability and potentially joining the war-fighting effort has clear benefits. But a broad coalition can also add complications. Given the stakes of a war in the Indo-Pacific, the emphasis of U.S. war planners will be on what added military value can be brought to bear, as opposed to the diplomatic or optical value of having a large coalition. The United States should focus its engagement on a small subset of European partners who can make a meaningful military contribution during a conflict — in particular the United Kingdom and France — and work to define operational contributions during peacetime and contingencies. However, the United States should not preclude other allies and partners from contributing, especially as European defense capabilities expand in the years ahead. The United States should insist that European countries that wish to engage are prepared to bring real military capabilities and commitments to the table, even if small. Today the only European partners with liaison officers at INDOPACOM are the United Kingdom and France; several others, including Nordic states, have expressed interest. This interest should be encouraged, provided it is accompanied by a willingness to commit resources, however small, to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States should focus its engagement on a small subset of European partners who can make a meaningful military contribution during a conflict — in particular the United Kingdom and France — and work to define operational contributions during peacetime and contingencies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster engagement between states on the Baltic and South China Seas.&lt;/strong&gt; The Baltic and South China Seas have similar operating environments, with relatively shallow bodies of water neighboring revisionist powers who assert unlawful claims, engage in unsafe operational behavior, and threaten maritime neighbors. Nordic navies and coast guards could provide security and capacity-building assistance to the navies and coast guards of maritime Southeast Asia, such as training and equipment transfers. For example, the United States has provided coast guard cutters to Vietnam and the Philippines, which have been refurbished and become important naval vessels; it should encourage states on the Baltic Sea to offer similar capacity-building and training initiatives. Sweden has already participated in such a program through the European Union’s Capacity Building Mission in Somalia, donating vessels to the Somaliland Coast Guard and providing training and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote the development of an EU naval mission in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; Europe’s naval presence in the region is useful in signaling to China that it is not just the United States that is concerned about a free and open Indo-Pacific. But Europe’s naval presence could send a stronger signal if it were more tightly linked to the European Union’s economic clout; after all, it is Brussels that will respond economically in a crisis, as it is responsible for the single market and therefore sanctions. A major purpose of freedom of navigation operations is to convey to China that Europe is both engaged in the region and concerned about Chinese behavior, meaning that action against Taiwan or international shipping will prompt a European response. Since this response is likely to be primarily economic in nature, meaning it would be an EU competency, it makes sense for the European Union to expand its naval efforts into the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union has a track record of conducting naval operations in response to regional security threats. These include Operation ATALANTA to counter piracy off the coast of Somalia and the Horn of Africa and Operation IRINI in the Mediterranean to enforce a UN arms embargo to Libya. More recently, the European Union has launched a security and defense partnership with four coastal states by the Gulf of Guinea to mitigate pressure exerted by terrorist groups in the region. To protect cargo ships under attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, the European Union also launched a naval mission in the Red Sea in early 2024, with up to seven member states providing ships or planes. Finally, the European Union’s Coordinated Maritime Presences (CMP) tool enables the bloc to act as one militarily in areas of interest. This is essentially a way to work around the European Union’s inability to operate a formal naval command by establishing a maritime surveillance arm to coordinate air and naval assets, achieving the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union should focus on forging a more cohesive and integrated European approach to the region. This means linking Europe’s significant economic clout and its primary lever to impose costs against China — sanctions — with its diplomatic and military efforts and signaling in the region. The EU role would be to manage and coordinate Europe’s naval presence. For example, regional EU missions could serve as the anchor for a pan-European naval attaché or even as a liaison office for maritime operators. Having EU-flagged vessels traverse the region may also expand the number of EU countries willing to participate, as operating under an EU flag provides more protection against Chinese economic retaliation. Additionally, the European Union has the benefit of being a relatively new actor, without much of the historic baggage of the United States, NATO, or indeed many EU member states with a colonial past. As Eve Fitriani found in a Carnegie Europe paper examining Indonesia’s views of the European Union, “Compared with other major powers, the EU is seen more positively in the eyes of Indonesians, who prefer the EU as an international partner over the United States, China, or Russia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage European partners to use regional deployments to directly challenge unlawful Chinese maritime claims.&lt;/strong&gt; The periodic naval deployments of several European countries over the last few years — including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy — sent an important message to the region about Europe’s stake in Indo-Pacific security, but the military value of such activities is limited. Given that their frequency is unlikely to change significantly, Washington should urge its European partners to define a clear operational purpose for such deployments. In addition to providing opportunities for ad hoc training and exercises, these deployments should be used to advance the larger effort to push back on excessive Chinese maritime claims and uphold international law. Specifically, in coordination with INDOPACOM, European navies could conduct transits of the Taiwan Strait — as the UK navy has done — or conduct freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea to contest specific Chinese maritime claims in the region. Simple “presence operations” are not enough: European navies should be prepared to directly challenge China’s unlawful claims, to reinforce the message that China’s actions are a global issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevate the U.S.-EU Security and Defense dialogue.&lt;/strong&gt; The establishment of the U.S.-EU Security and Defense dialogue was met with considerable opposition inside the U.S. government. The dialogue has now been formed and has proved useful; however, the engagement is conducted at the deputy assistant secretary level on both sides. Given the potential utility of EU naval missions, the importance of the European Union’s voice in upholding international agreements such as UNCLOS, the development of significant EU-funded security assistance programs, and growing EU investment in defense, the dialogue should be elevated to an assistant secretary level and should include an official on both sides responsible for Indo-Pacific security affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage the European Union to speak out more forcefully on Indo-Pacific issues.&lt;/strong&gt; Washington should encourage the European Union and European countries to speak out more forcefully when China violates international law and norms. For instance, China is routinely violating UNCLOS, to which European countries are signatories and can speak on with authority. The EU delegation to the Philippines in Manila put out a joint statement on UNCLOS and Chinese violations; this should be common practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage defense industrial cooperation between Europe and the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; There is growing defense industrial engagement between Europe and the Indo-Pacific. For instance, Poland has bought large quantities of Korean-made equipment, including tanks and artillery. Additionally, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan have joined together to produce a next-generation fighter jet under the GCAP program. This sort of collaboration may create stronger competitors to U.S. industry and at times further disrupt Europe’s already fragmented defense industrial base. Yet the United States should encourage these types of defense industrial engagements, which significantly strengthen ties and can help network U.S. allies and partners. They will increase industrial capacity globally and make Europe and Indo-Pacific partners feel more vested in the security situation in each other’s regions. For example, France’s extensive arms-sales relationship with India has helped strengthen ties between Paris and New Delhi. AUKUS has contributed to the United Kingdom’s Indo-Pacific tilt and provides perhaps the most prominent example of industrial cooperation between Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Additional partners, in Europe or the Indo-Pacific, should be brought in to collaborate on AUKUS Pillar Two as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote NATO standardization of armaments to boost capacity for partners.&lt;/strong&gt; European defense production is ramping up in response to Ukraine, and this capacity could help augment U.S. production in a conflict. For instance, Europe can boost U.S. defense industrial capacity particularly when it comes to munitions, such as 155-millimeter artillery, and more sophisticated precision-guided munitions, such as Storm Shadow. However, that requires the defense industry to ensure U.S. weapons platforms can use such munitions interchangeably. Thus, the United States should prioritize ensuring a higher level of NATO standardization of munitions, because it has direct implications for the United States if it wants to tap into European defense production. The United States should also seek to encourage broader standardization among its allies — both in Europe and Asia. Thus, NATO could seek to include the armaments directors of the IP4 countries in many of its discussions and meetings to ensure broader standardization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage Europe to become a security assistance provider to the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/strong&gt; EU assistance could be directed toward countries that complement U.S. engagement or have needs that go beyond what existing U.S. and other allied assistance can provide. Presently, European assistance efforts are limited by both decades of underinvestment in defense and the need to support Ukraine. Nevertheless, Europe may in the coming years increase its capacity to transfer weapons to Indo-Pacific partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, prior to the Ukraine war, the European Union created the European Peace Facility (EPF), a security assistance fund that can provide weapons to partners. The EPF is now being used largely to support Ukraine and has seen its budget dramatically increase to €17 billion ($18.5 billion) for use between 2021 and 2027. While Ukraine has been its overwhelming focus, the EPF was developed with the objective of aiding developing countries outside of Europe, much like the State or Defense Department’s security assistance fund. While the original budget for the fund is far less than U.S. security assistance programs, the fund’s budget before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was projected to be roughly €850 million ($1 billion) per year. The United States should engage with the European Union on this fund and encourage funding for the Indo-Pacific, and coordinate in identifying priority capabilities and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Europe is engaged in a significant force modernization, which may lead in the coming years to the retirement of systems excess to requirements. Much of these systems will likely head to Ukraine, but there may be opportunities in the maritime domain. Lastly, Europe may also have significant spare production capacity in the coming years. As it ramps up to support Ukraine and rebuild its stockpiles, it may have significant overcapacity in future years that could be used to support and build ties with certain Indo-Pacific partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s support for Russia in the invasion of Ukraine underscores the reality that security in the Indo-Pacific and in Europe are linked. U.S. alliances in Europe and the Indo-Pacific can therefore no longer be managed as separate entities, with contingency planning undertaken in isolation and without regard to trade-offs and the possible interplay of conflict across theaters. In the near term, U.S. policy should focus on ensuring that NATO and European allies can sustain deterrence in Europe with a reduced U.S. role. Europe’s role in Indo-Pacific security by necessity should therefore remain small and focused on discrete areas where concrete contributions are possible. Over the longer term, Washington should open a pathway for a European contribution to Indo-Pacific security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s international partners have been seeking to curtail Russian defence production through the sanctioning of Russian-affiliated individuals and entities and the disruption of Russian sanctions circumvention and covert procurement of military components on the international market since 2014. This effort accelerated after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Despite a considerable amount of government effort, it has so far failed to have a material impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure to limit Russian defence production is not inevitable. Russia is highly dependent on access to raw materials, machine tooling and components for its weapons that it must source from abroad, often from NATO member states. Failure to adequately choke Russia’s access to critical foreign-origin materials and components to date has arisen from three primary causes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Governments have been overly reactive, rather than proactive, in disrupting Russian procurement networks. These efforts have therefore persistently been too slow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Governments have tried to conduct the relevant work at too high a classification, with the ability to scale actions to disrupt Russian procurement hindered by the challenges imposed on sharing time-sensitive targeting data between multiple law enforcement entities and the private sector, on which sanctions enforcement relies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Governments have also been slow to grant permission for interventions that collectively could have made a difference, because many officials and policymakers have maintained unrealistic expectations on how to measure effect. Rather than preventing Russian weapons reaching the front, efforts can degrade the reliability of systems, reduce the volume produced, or increase the price, imposing difficult trade-off decisions on Russia’s military over the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing these shortcomings in efforts to counter Russian military production requires the collaboration of a coalition of contributing states. These states should form an intelligence fusion centre, premised on building a common recognised target picture of the Russian defence industry, and drawing on unclassified and declassified materials. This should form the basis for identifying key bottlenecks and opportunities for disruption, communicating these opportunities to the private sector, and then synchronising and sequencing enforcement action to maximise the disruptive effect on Russian industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visibility among participating official bodies of the unclassified synchronisation matrix should also enable observer countries to synchronise unilateral covert actions to expand these effects and reach parts of the Russian industrial processes that sit beyond what is reachable by overt methods. A recognised common target picture and shared synchronisation matrix should also enable deconfliction of actions between Ukraine’s international partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology guiding this effort should be to identify the key classes of Russian weapons, to identify each step in the process of supply, production and distribution, and to target it end to end, so that lags, shortages and loss of key capabilities afflict Russian defence production. The broad target categories that should be mapped and assessed include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;People: procurement agents, couriers, financiers, lawyers, engineers and machinists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tooling: machine tools, spare parts and software.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Components and materials: nitrocellulose, microelectronics, metals, fibres and fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enablers: revenue, ships, corporate structures, insurance mechanisms and warehousing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s international partners have committed to enabling Ukraine to preserve its sovereignty in the face of sustained Russian aggression. NATO has also adopted a new deterrence posture in anticipation of a major and sustained threat from Russia in the event that Moscow’s campaign in Ukraine succeeds. The outcome of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the credibility of NATO’s deterrence are, in the first instance, a consequence of the balance of conventional forces between NATO and Russia. Since NATO’s industrial base is critical to sustaining Ukraine, it is ultimately NATO’s production as compared to Russia’s that underpins deterrence. One line of effort critical to succeeding in enabling either Ukraine’s survival or NATO’s security is to expand the defence production capacity of NATO members. The other side of the net assessment, however, is the level of Russia’s military–industrial production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s defence industries are far from self-sufficient. All of Russia’s complex weapons are dependent on microelectronics manufactured by NATO members and other states, including South Korea, Japan, Switzerland and Taiwan. A significant proportion of Russia’s machine tooling is procured from companies outside Russia. Access to many of the raw materials necessary for explosive energetics production and fabrication is shaped by international supply. Given that access to these components plays an important role in determining the output of Russian industry, it is in the interests of those supporting Ukraine or contributing to NATO’s deterrence to explore how they can constrain, diminish or disrupt Russia’s military production. The delivery of European security must in part be based on the disarmament of Russia. It is not feasible to fully disarm Russia via such means. Nevertheless, the volume of key weapons systems available can be reduced. The reliability of systems can be degraded. The robustness of Russian planning assumptions about supply can be challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noting the importance of degrading Russian military production, several countries have taken deliberate repeated steps to try to harmonise efforts to limit seepage of components made in their countries, or manufactured abroad, to Russia. This has largely revolved around the adoption of export restrictions related to Russia and a regular drumbeat of updates to sanctions lists, the interdiction and seizure of identified shipments, and the prosecution of a limited number of individuals. There has also been a systematic effort to identify and disseminate information about the breadth of Russia’s dependence on access to these components, such as the publication in the UK, the US, the EU and Japan of the Common High Priority Items List. As will be detailed hereafter, most of these efforts have been manifestly ineffective. There may well be covert activities carried out by states that have disrupted Russian industry, but the expansion of Russian production of war material speaks for itself to demonstrate that any such efforts have been insufficient. The volume of components reaching the Russian defence industry has consistently met the requirement, and Russia has increased the production of key platforms and systems throughout the war. There are multiple reasons for this, but at its core, the failure to transform intent into effect is a result of a lack of methodologically rigorous targeting, coordination and collaboration, both within and between governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the stakes, and the failure that has characterised these efforts to date, this paper endeavours to map what is required to have a tangible impact on Russia’s defence industries. The purpose of the paper is to provide a methodology for target and effect selection and synchronisation to constrain Russian defence production. This is informed by the systemic study of Russia’s weaponry, its production dependencies and access points, and the tools available to deliver effects through those action points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has three chapters. Chapter I examines the problems that have bedevilled recent attempts to curtail Russia’s defence production. Chapter II takes a case study of a weapons system to map out the relevant dependencies in its production. Chapter III outlines a methodology for how those dependencies can be exploited to disrupt the production of key weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper considers efforts to disrupt the Russian defence industry globally. Officials in various states may protest at some of the loopholes discussed, or limitations in approaches to sanctions enforcement, on the basis that they are aware of these issues and have taken steps to mitigate them. This paper is not an audit of each country’s approach, but rather assesses the aggregate effectiveness of what is a global system. Thus, while some of the criticisms made in this paper may not apply to all countries mentioned in the paper, where the criticisms are applicable to the practice of some countries endeavouring to disrupt Russia’s defence industries, the likelihood is that that country can be used as a route for sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-why-a-methodology-is-needed-assessing-the-causes-of-failure&quot;&gt;I. Why a Methodology is Needed: Assessing the Causes of Failure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level of dependence on foreign-supplied components in the Russian defence industries was significant prior to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s most modern tanks rolled into Ukraine equipped with French-made thermal sights, while their bodies had been cut by exquisite machine tooling manufactured across Europe, the US and Taiwan. Its cruise and ballistic missiles struck Ukrainian cities guided by field-programmable gate arrays manufactured in the US. Russia’s artillery hammered Ukrainian soldiers in their defensive positions with explosive payloads manufactured from German nitrocellulose, and supported by UAVs critically dependent on Dutch pressure sensors and bespoke servo motors made by a South Korean-owned factory in the Philippines. Russian air defences denied Ukraine access to its skies thanks to oscillators acquired from a British company prior to the invasion, while Russian electronic warfare and signals intelligence systems used crystals supplied by Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before assessing the impact of efforts by Ukraine’s partners to limit ongoing access to these components and materials since the invasion, it is important to briefly outline these measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately following Russia’s full-scale invasion, the EU, the US and the UK immobilised the assets of Russia’s central bank held overseas, with much ongoing discussion as to whether they can be seized. Alongside these measures, many countries began a process of sanctioning Russian nationals and corporate entities associated with Russian politicians and officials. Sanctions caused assets to be frozen, and anyone doing business with these individuals or entities risked also becoming sanctioned, thus isolating the targets from the financial systems and trade that touched the economies of sanctioning states. Trade in key categories was also prohibited for certain industries, with the threat of sanctions against those facilitating such transactions as outlined in US Executive Order 14066, issued on 8 March 2022. Given the significance of private businesses functioning as wallets for the Russian state, a heavy emphasis was also placed on freezing the assets and holdings of Russian oligarchs. After it became apparent that Russian weaponry was heavily dependent on components that were not previously subject to export controls, restrictions on the goods that could be shipped to Russia increased, as reflected by the Common High Priority Items List. These sanctions regimes were initially highly patchy, but have become more comprehensive and aggressive over time. Further US Executive Orders, such as 14114, issued on 22 December 2023, have endeavoured to close further avenues for financing Russian illicit procurement. Over time, sanctions packages have become more focused and comprehensive in targeting networks, reflecting a growing understanding of how the Russian defence industry functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial efforts across governments were often sporadic and siloed. There was also a significant gap between the rhetorical messaging around sanctions, the actual rate at which governments were able to sanction Russian entities, and the enforcement necessary to make sanctions have a tangible effect. In some countries, a capacity shortage redirected the same teams from counterterrorist finance to counter-Russia efforts. In others, it simply took time to build both cross-government teams and awareness of efforts by different departments of state. International cooperation has slowly expanded but remains messy. Enforcement has also begun to accelerate. The arrest and prosecution of individuals from the Netherlands to New York demonstrates that enforcement is happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One challenge has been raising awareness among industry actors about how they are manipulated by Russian front companies, and how they can guard against this. Beginning in summer 2022, the US and others began significant efforts at capacity building and liaising with industry to endeavour to tackle upstream flows of goods to Russia. Further, there has undoubtedly been a significant volume of covert activity aimed at disrupting supply chains, as has been the case in almost all previous major conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet Russian defence production – still dependent on Western components – continues to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessing-the-extent-of-failure&quot;&gt;Assessing the Extent of Failure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An assessment of Russian production demonstrates that, despite all the above measures, efforts to curtail the Russian defence industry have thus far in aggregate failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian artillery – the backbone of its battlefield successes – consumes vast quantities of ammunition. Nevertheless, at the beginning of 2022, Russian industry was producing a mere 250,000 rounds of 152 mm ammunition per year. By the beginning of 2023, it had increased production to 1 million rounds per year. Over the course of 2023, Russian production of 152 mm shells rose further, so that the country expects to manufacture 1.325 million rounds in 2024. Meanwhile, 122 mm artillery ammunition increased to an expected output of 800,000 rounds over 2024. The production of multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) started from a much lower base, but has increased at a faster rate. In 2023, Russian 122 mm Grad production was just 33,000 rounds, but in 2024, production is on track to exceed 500,000 rounds. Similarly, 220 mm Uragan rocket production was just 2,800 rounds in 2023, but is on track to reach 17,000 rounds in 2024, with a similar rate of increase anticipated into 2025. This prioritisation of MLRS production is intended to compensate for shortages of replacement barrels in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Russia has set about refilling and restoring the approximately 20% of its pre-war munitions stockpile that was severely degraded. Combined with munitions orders from Iran, Belarus, Syria and North Korea – also heavily sanctioned – Russian overall munitions availability is likely to remain steady at 4 million munitions for 2024 and 2025. Despite efforts to curb this increase among Ukraine’s international partners, Russia has continued to be able to import nitrocellulose from Germany, Türkiye and Taiwan, and other precursors for explosive energetics from around the world, to sustain this rapid expansion of its munitions production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar story can be told about Russia’s manufacture of long-range missiles. One of the cruise missiles most widely employed by Russian forces during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has been the Kh-101. In 2021, prior to the full-scale invasion, the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) had a target of producing 350 of these missiles per year. Actual production was just 56 missiles. In 2022, the Russian MoD set a target of producing 460 Kh-101s per year. By 2023, actual production had reached 420 Kh-101s per year, not only dwarfing pre-war production, but also closing the gap between Russia’s ambitions and its outputs. At the beginning of 2023, Russia had approximately 50 9M723 ballistic missiles left in stock. Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia produced approximately six of these missiles per month. Production has since more than tripled, such that, despite using Iskanders throughout 2023, Russia began 2024 with 180 9M723 and 9M727 in stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shahed-136 production, meanwhile, has similarly expanded drastically. Original Iranian production rates were close to 40 per month. Between Russia and Iran, current production of these munitions has surpassed 250 per month. Given that all these munitions are critically dependent on US- and foreign-origin microelectronics, these figures clearly demonstrate that sanctions and other measures have entirely failed to slow production. Indeed, in some instances, access to specific components has increased. When the Russian military began to drop aerial bombs with UMPK glide kits, they were guided by Kometa-M satellite navigation modules using antennae from the Irish company Taoglas. Despite these components being identified early in 2023, Russia has not only significantly increased production of Kometa-M, now using it across a number of UAVs including Geran-2s, but has also developed an eight-antennae array for the UMPK, doubling the number of Taoglas antennae used per system. The Russian MoD assesses that the impact of Western sanctions on production of key weapons systems has been to impose a 30% increase in the price of microelectronic components. This is not trivial, but it is also manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture of Russian armoured vehicle production is distorted by the volume of equipment that the Russians can withdraw from storage and refurbish. For example, Russia is producing approximately 1,500 tanks and 3,000 other armoured fighting vehicles in 2024 and is set to produce a similar number in 2025. Approximately 85% of these are vehicles refurbished from storage. Nevertheless, the number of newly produced vehicles has also been rising. For example, the Kurganmashzavod plant produced 100 BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles during Q1 2023. In Q2, this rose to 108 vehicles. In Q3, 120 BMP-3s rolled off the production line and in Q4, 135 were produced. This increase may seem modest, but it shows that Russia is steadily expanding production capacity. In some cases, this is achieved by cutting corners and reprioritising. For example, in 2023, Russia produced 728 Tigr-M, a rate that is anticipated to fall to 721 in 2024, while the level of environmental protection from chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats on the vehicle is being reduced. This frees up capacity elsewhere. There is also some substitution away from components sourced from the US and Europe. Refurbished tanks, for example, had used Catherine thermal sights made by Thales before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Refurbished tanks today are instead fitted with Chinese- or Belarusian-supplied tank sights, which are less capable, but adequate. Here, therefore, there has been some successful import substitution. Ultimately, however, the refocusing on capability requires changes to machine tools, and large volumes of these continue to flow to Russia from the US, Europe, Taiwan and further afield, along with the software updates to run them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, despite the diligent efforts of many civil servants, backed by the political will to disrupt Russia’s military–industrial output, there is little to show for it. The question arises as to why efforts so far have proven so ineffective. This may in part be answered with reference to the initially chaotic approach to building the sanctions architecture, with the presumption that it will become more effective over time. However, this paper argues that there are also long-term, systemic challenges in how governments are approaching the issue. The remainder of this chapter suggests that there are three structural problems in how governments approach the issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being reactive rather than proactive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over-classifying information and thus not fully empowering the private sector charged with implementing sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Having unrealistic expectations of success that warp targeting. Understanding these causes of failure is critical if an effective methodology is to be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reactive-rather-than-proactive&quot;&gt;Reactive Rather Than Proactive&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, there was a scramble in Western capitals to sanction Russian entities. After the initial sanctioning of big names and low-hanging fruit, a more deliberate search for Russians who actually mattered for the war effort commenced. This led, in April 2022, to the sanctioning of Vladimir Yevtushenkov, who owned Sistema, a large Russian corporation involved in a wide range of defence-related enterprises, including the production of radar, long-range missile complexes and UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the rapid sanctioning of Yevtushenkov and his Russian holdings, Sistema continued to function and to do significant volumes of business within Europe to sustain its work for the Russian MoD. It did this through a range of front companies. In Switzerland, Serbian national Ivan Kokeza founded ERSO Energy Solutions AG, an apparent affiliate of Yevtushenkov’s ERSO Holding JSC, likely to provide funds for Yevtushenkov’s structure outside the sanctions net. In 2021, ERSO Energy Solutions and Kokeza were listed as shareholders in Electrozavod Group, alongside several Sistema subsidiaries. Meanwhile, Waldemar Reuswich, a German with a history of engaging in controversial Russian-linked business schemes, began a round of company registrations across Europe, including taking over control of entities previously linked to Sistema, such as Segezha Packaging in Denmark. At the same time, Reuswich’s Swiss Precision Holding AG was also listed as a shareholder in Electrozavod. Similar holding companies and fronts appear to have been established in Luxembourg and Ireland. Yevtushenkov meanwhile transferred shares in Sistema to his son Felix, while his daughter continued to run a firm in the UK until she was sanctioned in April 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of these structures for avoiding sanctions and enabling Sistema to continue to obtain critical components and raw materials were presented to the British authorities in early 2023. As one of the officials who received the information put it, “we were very grateful. We looked into these people, and it turned out they were a thoroughly rotten set”. Actions were taken, and some of Sistema’s more ambitious schemes were disrupted. The irony of this was that while British officials were pleased with their success, so were the Russians. Russia had succeeded in continuing to obtain what it needed for almost a year after the invasion. The network of front companies was discovered, but this simply caused Russia to move on to the next scheme. In fact, Russian planning documents drawn up weeks after the invasion of Ukraine highlight how post-facto sanctions were anticipated and not seen as a setback. For the Russians, failure meant the breaking up of a scheme before materiel got through, not its discovery after it entered Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the failure to prevent Sistema’s circumvention of sanctions was, and is, that many official bodies targeting these entities have entirely the wrong mindset about how to use the tools at their disposal and in whose hands those tools should be placed. While the US has a long history of using sanctions against state adversaries such as Iran, many European states have neither had the capacity nor the inclination to approach sanctions from the point of view of economic warfare, instead treating them as regulatory instruments or as measures to limit proliferation to terrorist groups. Where there were dedicated teams both designing and implementing sanctions in Europe, most were focused on counterterrorism. Where nation states were targeted, there was more interest in the political message sent by sanctions than in their practical effect. Even in the US, where the architecture for economic warfare exists, permissions to act were less forthcoming, and mechanisms for planning sanctions and enforcement with allies and partners were limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike terrorists, Russia can function at scale. It is notable how unsuccessful comparable attempts have been to tackle sanctions evasion by Iran, a much less capable actor than Russia. It is therefore essential that those crafting and enforcing sanctions and export controls do not see the imposition of these mechanisms as the end of the process, but rather the beginning. Imposing these restrictions simply creates the legal basis to move against entities and the people facilitating the activity, but the adversary will immediately begin to shift to using alternative structures. Enforcers must, therefore, proactively use intelligence to anticipate what the new structures will be, target them pre-emptively when they are being used to conspire to violate export controls and sanctions (rather than when they have already successfully done so), and arrest those running these front companies at a pace that genuinely slows the speed of Russia’s reaction. Rather than being a reactive tool, enforced when Russia succeeds in illegally importing Western components, sanctions must be used as a weapon to proactively hunt those who assist Russia, and to neutralise them before they succeed in exporting technologies. Those in the private sector in allied countries that manufacture and export these components must also be proactively engaged to understand the extent to which their components are being procured by the Russian war machine. Most importantly, this needs to be done across Ukraine’s partners, rather than in siloes within each state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proactive approach is entirely possible to implement. The Yevtushenkov network used obvious individuals with links to his companies before the full-scale invasion to evade the effect of sanctions. The individuals involved could have been identified before even Yevtushenkov was sanctioned. But this would have required someone to ask the question. The information existed in the import, export and company registration information of the states that eventually moved against Yevtushenkov’s network. But this information was not exploited because of a lack of official curiosity to retrieve it. Until the machinery of government begins to think offensively and proactively, Russia will continue to be one step ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;over-classification&quot;&gt;Over-Classification&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for Ukraine has been heavily dependent on those who hold stockpiles of Soviet-legacy equipment, from fighter jets to air defence systems. Many of these countries are NATO members. Greece operates S-300 and Tor. Finland operated Buk. Other pieces of Russian equipment were obtained by Ukraine’s international partners in Syria and Libya, such as when the US seized a Pantsir-1 air defence system. Ukraine’s international partners had to maintain these systems, and were therefore aware that they contained a significant number of non-Russian components. Ukraine has been pointing out the dependence on foreign-origin components in Orlan-10 since 2018. The extent of Russian dependence on Western components was therefore not a revelation to Ukraine’s international partners when Ukraine began publishing images of foreign-origin chips in Russian weapons systems in April 2022. It was, however, news to Western ministers, who quickly started demanding something be done about it. The curious thing is that, despite the issue being understood in detail by Western defence establishments for decades, no plan was immediately available to exploit this vulnerability in Russia’s defence industries at the beginning of the war. Despite knowledge of the extent of dependence sitting in government, and there being viable means to explain how that knowledge was obtained without exposing sources and methods, it was not briefed and exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of classification within many governments – while critical to a range of functions – is a major problem in scaling action against Russia’s military–industrial complex. During the War on Terror, two trends in intelligence contributed to the emergence of this problem. First, the need to find terrorists among a large civilian population drove investment in powerful analytical tools. The tendency towards “need to know” that had created many lateral compartments in the intelligence community gave way to “need to share”, and the development of all-source intelligence fusion. The result is that, within most governments, the experts able to analyse large data sets and the tools they need to do their job are hosted on Above Secret systems. During the War on Terror, most action was either undertaken by the military directly, or was small in scale. Thus, the intelligence community could either provide target packs (information sufficient for the planning and execution of an action) to the military, or specific declassification could be undertaken for law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem when tackling an adversary like Russia is that enforcement action, if it is to have a measurable impact on production, must be executed at scale and across multiple jurisdictions, to include the private sector producers of critical components. Most of this action must be undertaken by law enforcement, and, to have the permissions to act, law enforcement must have evidence. In reality, most of the underlying intelligence necessary to build target packs aimed at the Russian defence industry is low-grade information. Most of the evidence necessary to obtain warrants for law enforcement is available in unclassified business records. The scale at which Russia operates means that much of its activity cannot be concealed except insofar as it can disappear into the noise of the general volume of business transactions. Much of it is commercially available and does not rely on covert collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, because the analytical tools sit on Above Secret systems, the data is ingested into these systems for analysis. Any product subsequently created using the data in combination with limited volumes of Above Secret-origin information receives an Above Secret classification. The release of Above Secret information to foreign law enforcement with sufficient explanation of sourcing to stand up in court as the basis for a warrant – for example – is a painstaking task. Declassification requires a review of exactly what is being declassified, what risk this poses to sources and methods, and how the information is subsequently attributed. This is necessary because of the ease with which the release of Above Secret information could pose a threat to life for sources or undermine ongoing intelligence collection by revealing the capabilities of national technical means. What it also means, however, is that target packs cannot be declassified at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wider ongoing revolution in intelligence that offers a way round this problem. Open source intelligence allows for the harnessing of publicly accessible data to build an unclassified, robust evidence base for target packs. This can be shared freely between governments. Pioneers such as investigative journalism group Bellingcat have demonstrated how commercial systems can be used to reconstruct what would previously have only been available through national technical means. This is recognised by the intelligence community. As General Jim Hockenhull observed when head of UK Defence Intelligence, the majority of collection could now be of open source information, with closed sources filling the gaps. This process of reconstructing evidence outside secure environments is being used by governments, but few have the capacity of expertise to do this at scale both inside and outside secure environments. This has had detrimental effects on efforts to disrupt Russia’s defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Russia’s procurement of Nvidia microelectronics for use in image processing on its military UAVs was carried out by an individual named Igor Ievlev. It is a matter of public record that Ievlev is a graduate of the Cherepovets Military Institute of Radioelectronics, where he specialised as an engineer in radio communications. Now named the Military University of Radio Electronics, the institute is reportedly a training establishment for officers of the GRU (Russian military intelligence), including those who specialise in the procurement of critical technologies for weapons and military equipment. Ievlev made purchases from Nvidia partners who sold their chips to him directly. Although Ievlev’s history was known to Western governments, this information was not public, so companies had no ability to screen their millions of customers for those that might raise concerns. The result was that, despite information being publicly available, a likely GRU officer could directly procure sensitive Western microelectronics and ship them to Russia to directly support its arms industry. Western officials could subsequently use the trade data to show that a crime had been committed and close the channel. But getting ahead of the problem at the scale necessary to have an effect requires analysis to be conducted at a lower level of classification and for information to be made as accessible as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This not only facilitates coordination of law enforcement across jurisdictions, but also means that companies cannot plead ignorance when they sell to Russian front companies. This shifts the burden of proof, and thus the legal risk, creating a deterrent effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unrealistic-expectations&quot;&gt;Unrealistic Expectations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third major government structure problem is the way in which many of Ukraine’s international partners have sought to impact Russia’s defence industry, which has largely driven a cycle of inflated expectations, followed by a sense of futility when those expectations are not realised. Many official concepts in the years preceding Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine tried to push the idea of smart power over hard power: the precise use of capabilities in order to have disproportionate effects. In the UK, this has undoubtedly been driven by diminishing capacity to operate at scale. In the US, it has arguably been driven by the threat of stretch, as challengers emerge in three separate theatres. The desire to be clever shaped a response to the Russian defence industry that emphasised which specific components would have the greatest impact if they were denied. While in and of itself an interesting question, this framing demonstrated a misunderstanding of the problem. The desire was to go after components that would prevent Russia from building key systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all components are equal, and some were more susceptible to disruption and more important for the capabilities being targeted. Generally, however, there is no exhaust port on the Russian death star. The loss of a critical component will tend to lead to the alteration of the production sequence until a new supply of the component can be found, or it is substituted with an inferior component. This will impose cost and delays, and often impact the reliability of the system when it enters Russian service. But it does not stop the system being made. Two interesting examples highlight this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Shahed-136 UAVs began to hit Ukraine, it was noted that they had servo motors that manipulated their control surfaces which were built in the Philippines by South Korean-owned company HiTec. Pressure was subsequently put on HiTec to stop manufacturing the product. But this did not stop the Russians and Iranians from building Shahed-136s. Ukrainian observers noted that the original servo motors were swapped for Chinese ones, and that these were of inferior quality, causing some Shahed-136s to crash and limiting the acuteness of manoeuvres the aircraft could perform, simplifying its interception by air defence. As a result, Russia must launch more Shahed-136s to deliver the same effect, and has less assurance that it will be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good example is how Russia has responded to limitations in accessing sufficient quantities of explosive energetics. Many factories continued to fulfil orders but filled shells with less hexogen (Russian military-grade explosive). Others provided rounds with fewer charges. Eventually, Russia began to import nitrocellulose with a lower level of enrichment, thus reducing the explosive energy of the charges with which it would eventually fill its ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact at the front was therefore counterintuitive. The Russians had to fire more rounds to achieve the same level of effect or had to use higher-echelon capabilities to conduct counterbattery fire because the lower echelon systems lacked the range. Thus, the immediate effect was to increase the volume and calibre of Russian fires. The impact on consumption and therefore endurance of the Russian artillery was significant until the problem could be resolved. If the cost of producing key systems can be raised sufficiently, it will not prevent Russia from making munitions. But it will reduce how long Russia can sustain the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very few historical examples where economic efforts have decisively prevented the manufacture of a capability. The Third Reich was exceptionally effective at finding alternatives as its industries were destroyed or disrupted by blockade and bombing. However, the attritional effect of measures targeting defence industries, whether in terms of cost, opportunity cost, or reliability and performance, is significant. Another important point is that any intervention will be time limited in its effect. However, sequences of disruptions can leave a system functioning in an extremely inefficient manner. The cumulative effect of restructuring can be more significant than the direct effect of a given intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why properly assessing the impact of interventions is important is that unless the right metrics are briefed, interventions are unlikely to achieve approval from policymakers. If policymakers expect to be given options to bring production of a Russian system to a standstill and none of the options provided meet that threshold, it may be that none of them will receive the green light. No single operation is likely to justify itself in terms of the risks and resources involved versus the impact. However, a package of interventions over time can have a disproportionately disruptive impact. Setting the right policy expectations is, therefore, critical if permissions are to be forthcoming at a scale that has impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-the-vulnerability-of-russias-supply-chains&quot;&gt;II. The Vulnerability of Russia’s Supply Chains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the level of effort expended in sanctioning entities connected with Russia as compared with the limited effects achieved, there are some who argue that it is a fruitless endeavour. This argument can be countered when examining the Russian military–industrial enterprise and the extent of the threat surface against which Ukraine and its international partners can operate. This chapter seeks to demonstrate the level of vulnerability by offering a detailed case study of a Russian defence enterprise and its vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case study is the Zala Aero Group, a now-sanctioned Russian UAV manufacturer partially owned by Kalashnikov Concern, a subsidiary of the Rostec Group defence conglomerate. Zala Aero Group’s and its subsidiaries’ supply chains span the US, Europe and East Asia. Documents and trade data show that Zala Aero Group leans on dozens of Russian companies to procure foreign items to manufacture UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;zala-aero-groups-significance&quot;&gt;Zala Aero Group’s Significance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has seen an unprecedented increase in the use of UAVs as integral pieces of the reconnaissance-fires complex. One-way attack drones are increasingly used to facilitate rapid strikes against targets. The sophistication of these drones ranges from off-the-shelf first person-view models rigged with explosives to purpose-built loitering munitions with increasingly advanced sensor suites. Zala Aero Group is one of the leading companies in Russia that can design and produce UAVs and loitering munitions, offering an all-in-one reconnaissance-strike package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zala’s Lancet-3 is one of Russia’s most effective loitering munitions, responsible for disabling or destroying hundreds of Ukrainian weapons platforms since mid-2022. As a result, Russia’s defence industry has placed significant emphasis on expanding production. In May 2023, Zala Aero Group’s corporate owner announced the creation of a “Division of Special Machines” to expand the output of these systems, stating that the company expects to increase production of UAVs several-fold in 2024. In parallel, Russia’s Ministry of Industry and Trade has drafted a strategy for the coordinated development of UAVs until 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zala Aero Group has begun ramping up UAV production, including of Lancet-3s, by purchasing shopping malls and converting them into manufacturing plants. In February 2024, one such plant caught fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company’s aspirations also include the development of more advanced loitering munitions that use AI to create lethal autonomous weapon systems. Such an expansion will require Zala Aero Group to tap into international supply chains to acquire the requisite technology to build and field these systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;zala-aero-groups-procurement-networks&quot;&gt;Zala Aero Group’s Procurement Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From January 2022 to May 2023, Zala Aero Group paid dozens of Russian companies millions of roubles for various “products”. Many of these companies are vendors, distributors and importers of the components and tools required to produce UAVs. Often, these companies’ websites advertise such items – including those produced abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade data confirms that these companies import large quantities of foreign goods, including those manufactured by Western companies. Sanctions following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine do not appear to have hindered these companies’ ability to import dual-use, export-controlled items which, in some cases, have seen an increase in imports since February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest recipient of Zala Aero Group’s payments was Aeroscan LLC, which uses UAVs for geospatial surveying and topographical mapping. Aeroscan’s owner, Nikita Zakharov, is the son of Zala Aero Group’s founder and majority shareholder, Aleksandr Zakharov, and has appeared at several public events with the Zala Aero Group, even helping to purchase a shopping centre that was later converted into a UAV factory. Aeroscan has Russian government contracts to conduct maintenance on Zala Aero Group’s UAVs for government departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aeroscan remitted more than RUB 2.3 billion to Zala Aero Group from January 2022 to May 2023, and Zala Aero Group remitted more than RUB 2.5 billion to Aeroscan. Like Zala Aero Group, Aeroscan has not imported any items used to produce UAVs, except for a single $8,000 shipment of gas analysers in January 2022. However, Aeroscan did make payments from January 2022 to May 2023 to Russian companies that import and distribute items for UAV production. Zala Aero Group also paid several of the same companies that import these goods. Aeroscan appears, therefore, to be procuring dual-use components and technologies for Zala Aero Group. Zala Aero Group’s suppliers’ trade data shows they have procured large amounts of materials and tools used to assemble UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;microelectronics&quot;&gt;Microelectronics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zala Aero Group’s UAVs contain dozens of microelectronics: the KUB-BLA contains at least 11 components, and the Lancet-3 at least 27. Almost all the microelectronics were designed by semiconductor companies in the US and Europe. At least three in the KUB-BLA and five in the Lancet-3 are dual use and subject to export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zn8BRnF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Western-Made Components Inside the Zala Lancet-3.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated using documents and photographs seen by RUSI. ECCN = Export Control Classification Number.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From January 2022 to May 2023, Zala Aero Group and Aeroscan paid millions of roubles to Russian microelectronics importers, many of which are now sanctioned by the US and the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some UAVs contain export-controlled Nvidia microchips in an apparent attempt to improve their sensor suites and, in the case of the Lancet-3, create an autonomous weapons system immune to jamming. One specific Moscow-based microelectronics importer, ID Solution, is likely to be the key supplier of these Nvidia modules to Zala Aero Group and responsible for more than 90% of the Nvidia imports into Russia since the invasion began. From March 2022 to December 2023, ID Solution imported more than $14 million in microchips and related items to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cameras&quot;&gt;Cameras&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ID Solution also imported thousands of cameras, including ones compatible with Nvidia modules, and high-spec electro-optical cameras produced by Sony Corporation and South Korea’s Wonwoo Engineering. Zala Aero Group and Aeroscan also paid other Russian companies that import cameras and specialise in digital surveillance systems. One of these companies received nearly RUB 200 million from January 2022 to May 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;batteries&quot;&gt;Batteries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAVs require a constant supply of lithium-ion batteries, particularly for loitering munitions, when such batteries are unretrievable. One company that has likely supplied Zala Aero Group with lithium-ion batteries has partnership agreements with more than 25 electronic component and battery manufacturers. Before the war, this company’s annual imports were valued at only a few thousand dollars. In 2023, however, the company imported more than $730,000 in lithium-ion batteries from Chinese companies. While some batteries were labelled as produced by Chinese brands, their model numbers revealed that they were produced by Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;motors&quot;&gt;Motors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAVs require various motors to operate. Lightweight UAVs and loitering munitions use AC motors with air blades to generate propulsion and lift. Servo motors manipulate control surfaces for balance and direction of travel, and stepper motors can stabilise and rotate gimbal-mounted cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several of Zala Aero Group’s and Aeroscan’s Russian customers import these types of motors, despite not appearing to specialise in supplying these products. One such company was paid more than RUB 1.4 billion by Zala Aero Group and has imported millions of dollars in AC motors from Chinese companies. Another company also imported thousands of stepper motors from Chinese companies from March to December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While intended for radio-controlled aircraft models, servo motors are also crucial components used in UAVs, and have been found in UAVs used by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (AFRF). One Russian company imported 3,400 servo motors from HiTec RCD Philippines in December 2021. Between October 2023 and December 2023, ID Solution also imported at least 400 HiTec RCD servo motors. HiTec RCD servo motors have been found in the Shahed-136/Geran-2 loitering munitions used by the AFRF in Ukraine, as well as in loitering munitions built and fielded by Houthi rebels in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;carbon-fibres-and-polymers&quot;&gt;Carbon Fibres and Polymers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-performance UAVs, such as those produced by Zala Aero Group, often use carbon fibre and similar composite materials, as these allow UAVs to be more agile, lightweight and durable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From March 2022 to December 2023, one likely supplier of such composite materials to Zala Aero Group imported $5.6 million in acrylic polymers, epoxy resins, fibreglass fabrics and liquid polyesters. The supplier’s largest composite materials supplier is an Estonian company that exported synthetic materials with defence and aerospace applications produced by European companies, meaning that European materials are likely to be in a range of Russian UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;machine-tools-and-injection-moulding-machines&quot;&gt;Machine Tools and Injection Moulding Machines&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers such as Zala Aero Group also require sophisticated machine tools and robot arms to produce UAVs. Russian state media, while visiting one of Zala Aero Group’s converted shopping centre factories, showed various foreign machine tools used to manufacture Lancet-3s. These were manufactured by Hyundai, DN Solutions and Fanuc Machines. Additionally, Zala Aero Group uses plastic injection moulding machines purchased from Japan to synthesise components it can no longer import, including propeller blades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zala Aero Group and Aeroscan have paid several Russian importers and distributors of machine tools and injection moulding machines, one of which claims to supply industrial equipment to several sanctioned Russian defence conglomerates. This distributor has historically imported machine tools from various European manufacturers. Another Russian company imported more than $22.2 million in machine tools and spare parts from March 2022 to December 2023, primarily from one Hong Kong company. The types of machine tools imported include those used by Zala Aero Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a third Russian company that received more than RUB 24 million from Aeroscan imported more than $4.2 million in injection moulding machines and related parts from March 2022 to December 2023. These shipments included $3 million in injection moulding machines and spare parts produced by Japan Steel Works, the same brand as that used by Zala Aero Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;triaging-points-of-vulnerability&quot;&gt;Triaging Points of Vulnerability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Russia’s efforts to reduce its dependence on foreign materials for its war machine, its scramble to increase production following its invasion of Ukraine shows that it is still highly reliant on international supply chains. While sanctions and the will of companies to cut business ties with Russia impacted the country’s imports in the first few months of the war, procurement networks have adapted significantly. Trade patterns show that shipments to Russia are now routed through third countries that are friendlier to Russia, are more permissive of dubious trade flows, or have porous export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zala Aero Group’s procurement flows underscore why Ukraine and its allies must change tactics in relation to disrupting Russia’s defence supply chains, by targeting the flows of specific items or technologies, instead of focusing sanctions action on the most obvious entities and individuals facilitating these networks. When targeting individuals and entities, it would be more impactful to prioritise those actors facilitating the procurement of these specific materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s procurement of more advanced materials requires individuals outside of Russia to facilitate this procurement. For example, several owners and shareholders of Russian microelectronics importers are graduates and affiliates of military radioelectronic institutes, and many would appear to have extensive academic knowledge of microelectronics. The proactive detection, investigation and prosecution of these individuals and those who assist them are critical to disrupting Russia’s defence supply chains, which usually start within the jurisdiction of states with an interest in limiting Russian military–industrial output. This is especially relevant for individuals procuring European-made materials exported directly from the EU to Russia, as Western allies have greater purview in these jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ynkfVSO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Russian Military–Industrial Complex Sequential Target Categories.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies such as Zala Aero Group require a constant supply of specific components and materials to sustain UAV production, and these same materials are used across all Russian military-grade UAVs. Stemming the flow of these components would have more significant ramifications for Zala Aero Group’s production cycle than targeting the company and its leadership alone. Procurement networks, instead of merely having to reorganise through unsanctioned companies connected to unsanctioned individuals, would also have to source completely new materials, at great expense in terms of funding, time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Targeting the supply of industrial equipment like machine tools, milling machines, lathes and injection moulding machines is equally imperative. Russian defence manufacturers rely on and will continue to need additional industrial equipment – along with regular maintenance and access to spare parts – to expand production. Although Russia has gradually imported larger quantities of Chinese machine tools, it also continues to source these tools from companies in the US, Europe, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Targeting this supply would force these networks to prioritise analogous components and tools of lower quality, or unreliable counterfeits, increasing the chance of failure and degrading the overall effectiveness of Russian systems in Ukraine. The integration of new components and tools is also an arduous, time- and labour-intensive process, as replacements are tested and certified for battlefield use. This is particularly important as Zala Aero Group seeks to improve its UAVs with more advanced technologies – including AI capabilities – which would be difficult to replace adequately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-a-methodology-of-effects&quot;&gt;III. A Methodology of Effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous chapters have outlined the extent to which existing approaches to disrupting Russia’s defence industry have failed. In Chapter I the causes of failure were identified as: a reactive approach taken by governments; over-classification resulting in siloed and exclusive actions taken at too small a scale; and unrealistic expectations of what can be achieved. Chapter II demonstrated that the effort to disrupt Russia’s defence industries is far from futile, given the large threat surface against which Ukraine’s international partners can operate. This chapter therefore proposes an approach to targeting and synchronisation of actions to deliver relevant effects at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-a-recognised-common-target-picture&quot;&gt;Building a Recognised Common Target Picture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamental to scaling the disruption of Russia’s defence industry is ensuring that the various bodies involved – intelligence, customs, law enforcement, sanctions units, financial institutions, industry and militaries – have a detailed understanding of the target and how it is functioning. Moreover, this picture must be accessible to the relevant bodies, in multiple countries, with as little latency as possible. The effective interdiction of a shipment may well require that a purchase traced from Country A is flagged to law enforcement in Country B before it is exported to Country C, and that a warrant is issued and relevant action taken immediately. The foundational requirement for such a rapid process to succeed is for states to have a shared picture of Russia’s industrial system, and to agree that this picture is sufficient to form the basis for planning actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework for building a recognised common target picture (RCTP) of Russia’s defence industry should be a confidential but unclassified data fusion centre hosted by one state as a framework nation, and with liaison officers from a coalition of willing states. Which country acts as the framework nation is clearly a matter for negotiation. The core of this fusion centre should be a network map of Russian procurement channels and manufacturing systems, databases of associated corporate entities and individuals, and financial flows. The fusion centre must have the full range of commercially available analytical tools, and participating states should enable access to import and export data, transaction records, company records and other relevant databases from participating countries. Using investigative powers, states should also request trace data from financial institutions and make it available to the fusion centre. In some cases, ingesting these data sets may be periodic or may be subject to access requests. This should therefore be managed by participating analysts from contributing countries. Each country is also likely to have a significant volume of commercial trade data and company records obtained through technical collection. While individual records from these sets may be sensitive insofar as they reveal points of access, in aggregate, these data sets are often very low-level intelligence because they have so many potential points of origin. To that end, analysts from participating states with security clearances should be able to assess what their countries hold at Secret and Above Secret classifications away from the fusion centre and, understanding the gaps in the fused picture, be able to request the declassification and sharing of key data sets. In many cases, this may simply be the sharing of prompts taken from collection – names of individuals or specific companies – that can be flagged to the analysts at the fusion centre to target when trawling publicly available information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most important effects that can be delivered by the team managing the RCTP is the ability to publish an approved subscriber database that key industry partners can log in to to screen their customers and get greater insight into their downstream supply chains. The existence of such a database could remove the legal protection of pleading ignorance, shifting the legal jeopardy onto suppliers and thereby creating a deterrent effect against turning a blind eye to profitable orders for products to dubious clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one group of analysts is focused on maintaining an accurate picture of where Russia is procuring material, where it is going, what it is being used for, and who is involved in obtaining it, two additional teams are also necessary. The first is a team responsible for assessing opportunities to disrupt. The basis for this should be to analyse dependency within the system and to evaluate the resilience of the system to interference at each stage. The result is comparable with a road map showing congestion, which must also indicate where intervention can have the greatest effect. The broad target categories that should be mapped and assessed include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People&lt;/strong&gt;: procurement agents, couriers, financiers, lawyers, engineers and machinists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooling&lt;/strong&gt;: machine tools, spare parts and software.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Components and materials&lt;/strong&gt;: nitrocellulose, microelectronics, metals, fibres and fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enablers&lt;/strong&gt;: revenue, ships, corporate structures, insurance mechanisms and warehousing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third team of analysts should be tasked with producing target packs, mainly on request by participating countries, to package parts of the RCTP to be presented to courts, policymakers and others to authorise interventions or to release the target pack to non-participating countries for the purpose of diplomacy. This team needs to understand the legal frameworks of participating states, so that fused data can be turned into actionable information. Another function of this team should be to allow participating states to observe the activities being prepared by others. A challenge that has confronted Ukraine’s international partners so far has been deconfliction. With activities at higher classification or in compartments, and without mechanisms for deconfliction, shipments that one state allowed to pass in order to gather data on who would redirect it have been stopped by a different state. Multiple states have also wasted time and energy trying to act against the same shipment. By having a multinational team building these packs, it becomes possible for deconfliction issues to be flagged and addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance of the framework nation is that it should control the security cell and access to the fusion centre. The work of the fusion cell should be based on confidentiality – as is the case with law enforcement – rather than classification. To that end, the framework nation should be able to exclude analysts if they breach confidentiality. The sensitive element of the fusion centre’s work is its relationship with planned actions, rather than the RCTP itself. There is a precedent for such an approach. The counter-piracy command-and-control centres in Singapore and the Bab al-Mandab, for example, necessarily involved participating states which needed a common operating picture to deconflict their activities, but which were also competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that such a structure will be too easily penetrated by Russia. To a large extent, as long as there is latency in Russia’s access to certain materials, this will not disrupt enforcement and is not overly problematic. It is also clear that these problems are manageable. The support effort for Ukraine, coordinating the delivery of material from a large number of countries, is a good example of how operations can remain sufficiently secure to enable the mission while being largely unclassified but with specific elements of the effort managed at higher classification. Many of the countries supporting Ukraine are not Five Eyes states, or even NATO members, and Ukraine itself is acknowledged to be a penetrated bureaucracy that must have sight of shipments. In spite of this, Russia has so far failed to interdict shipments. The security issues are real, but they can be managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;synchronising-and-layering-effects&quot;&gt;Synchronising and Layering Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While states will hold information at higher classification that will be withheld from an RCTP, the most sensitive element of the work of the fusion centre is planning interventions to impact Russia’s defence industry. The identification of key target sets by the fusion centre should form the basis for minilateral or unilateral effects planning, with the level of classification appropriate to the participants involved. Nevertheless, if effects are going to scale, then most will be unclassified and implemented by various branches of the participating states’ official bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a targeting board were convened to assess options against an identified procurement network, it would become possible for participating states to propose actions to disrupt the procurement that collectively leave very few reversionary options for Russia. Synchronising effects thereby allows amplification of impact. Where there are gaps in interventions that different countries have proposed, this can become the area of focus for unilateral measures planned at higher classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iwKhqMC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: A Typical Russian Procurement Network.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, consider the following procurement scheme. A Russian dual national is financed to purchase US microelectronics via a front company and ship them to Germany, where they will be driven to another country in the Schengen Area, exported to another front company in Türkiye, and then be mislabelled and shipped to Russia. The finance for the operation might be provided by a Russian gold shipment converted to cash in the UAE under the auspices of a front company and thereafter made available to the procurement agent. A single action – such as interdicting the shipment – might disrupt it, but if the procurement agent is not detained and is warned off by the seizure, they can simply restart the process using an alternative front company. If sanctions are applied against the importing company in Türkiye, a different one can simply be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/b9PVlax.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: How Coordinated Multi-Jurisdictional Actions Can Disrupt a Russian Procurement Scheme Across Multiple Points.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the sanctioning of the Turkish company, the raiding of the procurement officer’s home, and the media publication of the abuse of Turkish customs regulation can be synchronised, it is difficult for an alternative route to be set up quickly. If, at the same time, the flight carrying the gold can be denied overflight rights and so delayed, and the company converting the gold to capital sanctioned simultaneously, the funds may not be available to pursue an alternative avenue of supply. This of course requires collaboration between several countries. It also becomes possible for other states to be in a position to add friction to Russia’s activities as required. This could mean getting Russian actors excluded from a flight, for example, so that they are stuck in a jurisdiction where they can be detained while the other actions are taken. If we imagine, therefore, a synchronisation chart showing the steps for the Russian procurement and manufacture of a system along one axis, and the measures being lined up by the participating states to simultaneously disrupt each stage, then the cost to Russia will be high. Procurement agents and other enablers are less replaceable than front companies. And, of course, pooling evidence gathered during seizures to the fusion centre to refine the RCTP allows for the cycle to be accelerated and the impact of each intervention magnified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is necessary to consider the impact of not only actions taken in parallel, but also those taken in sequence. The prevention of a large shipment reaching a Russian factory may have a fairly limited impact on production. The factory may use stockpiled components to get itself over the stop in supply while alternative procurement channels are established. Alternatively, the stockpile may be used to allow engineers to work out a substitute Chinese component – albeit potentially reducing reliability – so that output can continue even if the part does not become available. However, suppose the disruption of a supply route is staggered with the subsequent disruption of the financing of supply routes, and that the actions against the alternative supply route are worked out in advance. Suppose then that once the engineers have become satisfied with a substitute component, there is disruption to the functioning of their machine tooling. While they are resolving the issue with the tooling, production is disrupted so that supplies of other materials begin to accumulate in storage at the factory. But as they are close to resolving the supply issue, the Ukrainian military uses one-way attack UAVs to destroy or damage a significant quantity of the stockpiled material. This kind of sequencing, such that production remains continuously off balance, inefficient and disrupted, is likely to have a far wider impact on output – both quantitative and qualitative – than any single action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of effect that is needed against Russia’s defence industry, and the lead roles of both law enforcement in taking enforcement action, and private sector manufacturers and exporters in ensuring integrity in their supply chains, mean that the bulk of activities must be conducted in the confidential but unclassified space. There are discrete actions, however, reaching targets beyond legal jurisdiction, that some participating countries may wish to pursue using covert means where planning must be classified. Furthermore, different participating members may have quite different risk tolerances for what they are prepared to do unilaterally. Ukraine, for example, has no qualms about conducting kinetic operations. This is a problem that Western states have managed before. The US, for example, could collaborate with Israel on its efforts to constrain Iran’s nuclear programme without participating in Israel’s assassination programme targeting Iranian nuclear scientists. Nevertheless, the question arises as to how the synchronisation process can function at the unclassified, the minilaterally classified and the unilaterally classified level. There is the risk, of course, that if multiple countries endeavour to conduct covert activities targeting the gaps in the synchronisation chart, that the effort could become fratricidal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layering of overt, covert and clandestine effects is achievable by participating states having an outline of the overt synchronisation matrix. There may also be occasional participants given observer status to the RCTP as a basis for their collaboration on effect delivery. Nevertheless, it becomes possible for states to work minilaterally or unilaterally away from the fusion centre to plan and execute effects, and to deconflict with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area for consideration is where the intent of a covert operation is to spike a Russian procurement process rather than to deny it. This could involve taking the money of Russian procurement agents and then failing to supply the goods, or providing microelectronics that are defective. If synchronised with disinformation suggesting that a procurement agent is defrauding their employer, these kinds of techniques can result in Russian enablers being targeted even if they are beyond the jurisdiction of the participating states. Attacking trust and confidence in Russian procurement processes is valuable because it forces validation mechanisms and frictions into all operations. However, to carry out such actions it becomes necessary for states to avoid having the fusion centre coordinating interdiction of the related shipments. A system of red flags – preventing interdiction of specific shipments – brings with it both the risk that the Russians are tipped off, and the potential for participating states to undermine the process by red-flagging actual targets. These issues can be managed, however, as they are similar to some of the methods used by law enforcement to target drug cartels. Again, minilateral explanation can enable appropriate handling of such opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The metrics of success for operations targeting Russia’s defence industry will be harder to measure in open sources. The relevant metrics are: reduced production output of key weapons systems; reduced reliability of key weapons systems; or increased cost of production. The volume of weapons being fired is a poor and methodologically challenging proxy for any of these variables. Although they will correlate over time, there is often a considerable lag between disruption to production and shifts in use at the front. This makes it difficult to attribute cause and effect. The problem is that the metrics must necessarily derive from inside Russia’s defence industry and are therefore likely to only be accessible via covert collection. How, therefore, can the fusion centre assess its impact?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some respects, participating states will only continue to support the endeavour if they see a return on investment. That they each conduct damage assessments using their own collection capabilities therefore provides those funding the effort with internal validation of impact. This kind of data is often available from relatively low-level collection. Individually, the sourcing is highly sensitive, but once aggregated, it becomes difficult to attribute it to a source. To that end, it should be possible for participating states to declassify aggregated assessments relating to these metrics periodically, at intervals that allow for meaningful changes to be picked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia can be stopped in Ukraine, the prospects for European security will immeasurably improve. If Russia achieves its objectives in Ukraine, the credibility of NATO’s conventional deterrence posture becomes critical to the security of Europe. In either case, the industrial capacity of NATO states is important in ensuring that Ukraine can continue to fight or that NATO’s forces are ready to deter. The strain, however, can be lessened by reducing Russia’s capacity to arm and equip its forces. The extensive dependence of Russia’s defence industry on international supply chains makes it vulnerable to disruption. Thus far, however, Ukraine’s international partners have failed to significantly curb Russian defence production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has sought to identify the cause of this failure. Ultimately, it has concluded that Ukraine’s international partners have been reactive rather than proactive in targeting Russian defence industries; have suffered from the over-classification of relatively low-level intelligence and have thus failed to properly empower the manufacturers of the goods they are trying to disrupt; and have had policy frameworks orientated around unrealistic expectations of what can be achieved. Despite this, the exposure of Russia’s defence industry to international efforts at disruption was shown to be considerable. There are multiple stages throughout the production process where intervention, both overt and covert, can cause delay, degradation in quality, or a serious increase in cost to Russia’s arms production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology proposed for increasing the effectiveness of efforts at disarming Russia is threefold:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is necessary to have an unclassified and therefore releasable RCTP of Russia’s defence industry, with mechanisms for sharing target packs among participating countries that fit with those countries’ legal requirements for authorising interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is necessary to synchronise and layer effects, spanning multinational overt action, minilateral covert action and unilateral clandestine action, to cause Russia’s defence industry to be maximally disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is necessary that states use intelligence collection to assess impact and then aggregate the collected data to reduce the sensitivity of their conclusions, enabling these to be shared to refine the targeting process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two years of largely ineffectual and poorly cohered efforts, the time to act is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今日（25日）開始求情，首批求情被告為被控方指為初選組織者的5人，包括認罪的戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟，以及被裁定罪成的吳政亨，預計需時3天。他們均自首提堂起還柙，至今逾3年3個月。其中沒有作供、也沒有旁聽的戴耀廷，將自2022年9月案件管理聆訊後首度在法庭公開露面。有曾與戴耀廷一起助選的市民到場，她指對方正喝下「苦杯」，而真理未必短時間被看見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;姨婆直落旁聽-晚上不適需回家取藥&quot;&gt;「姨婆」直落旁聽 晚上不適需回家取藥&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《獨媒》記者昨晚11時半到達西九龍裁判法院，約10人正通宵輪候領取正庭籌號，有警員在場檢查身份證。法庭旁聽常客「姨婆」昨晚6時許已攜同其姨甥孫到場，她昨日已連續旁聽鄒幸彤案和屠龍小隊案，「直落」晚上到西九龍裁判法院通宵排隊。6月4日與姨甥孫在銅鑼灣被警方拘捕的她，事後感身體不適被送往醫院治理。通宵排隊的她身體亦難免不勝負荷，迫於無奈於凌晨3時半乘的士回家取藥。及後她堅持折返西九龍法院繼續排隊，又拿出「佔中三子」之一陳健民的「活得磊落真誠」簽名布說，自己毋忘初心，幾辛苦也要來，取藥亦不例外。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;64歲的阿偉說，自己通宵排隊是因為希望見到戴耀廷教授一眼。他認為他作為法律學者，不會無故犯法，有他的理由，「一個識法律嘅人唔會無端端犯法。」他指自己尊重法庭裁決，但不會認同。阿偉曾經歷過坐牢，指夏天的監獄熱得像火爐，而法庭外還有風可以撥涼，「人哋三年喎，（通宵排隊）捱一晚半晚，我覺得值得。」他想對戴耀廷說，要堅持下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;涉「小彤群抽案」保釋中的李盈姿亦有通宵排隊，指今日求情是「歷史的見證」。上個月初選案裁決時，她保釋並梳洗後，凌晨四點到西九龍法院旁聽，目睹以前「排隊黨」，因此今次通宵排隊「唔想畀排隊黨霸咗啲位。」李稱，現場有很多蚊，但都要堅持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同通宵排隊的64歲的黃先生，指已有多年未見過戴耀廷，指他已經辛苦了多年，希望可以為他打氣，且求情時能夠聽到他的心聲，「佢一開始已經認罪，想知佢嘅心路歷程，好似預咗做犧牲者。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;清晨五時許，有其他人陸續加入排隊隊伍。現場多次落起驟雨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;修讀歷史的何小姐攜帶了一本歷史書題為《毛澤東之後的中國》，在排隊時閱讀，她在早上六時前到場，2019年自己曾與戴耀廷一起助選譚爾培參選大埔區議會西貢北選區，且均為基督徒，因而結識，而譚最終亦獲勝。她表示戴耀廷愛好和平，是一個很和平的人，對他的遭遇感到無奈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何小姐指以基督徒的說法，認為戴耀廷正在飲一個「苦杯」並承受。她又以捷克宗教改革家胡斯為例，指他反對捷克教會腐敗，最終被火燒死，教廷在其死後500多年才道歉，指有時候一些真理未必能在短時間中被看見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoe 同樣為了支持戴耀廷而六點前排隊等候，指自己非常敬重戴耀廷，支持對方多年來所投身和提倡的東西。自己真心認同戴耀廷的出發點是愛與和平，亦都相信他並非煽動或離間任何人，認為他在初選案中只是表達了認為可行的方案，並預留一個很大空間讓其他人選擇是否參與，公開發表文章只是闡釋自己的觀念，「到最後有幾多人會同佢一樣，行喺呢一條路上面，其實佢控制唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zoe 估計，戴耀廷在審訊期間未發表觀點，或已認為自己想說的說話已經說完，留待公眾表達如何看待他以及他的理念。她期待戴耀廷求情間，能夠聆聽他的發言，不過戴或只會陳述自己的理念，不會以求情的嚮導為自己發言。Zoe 希望，戴耀廷可知道有公眾其實有認真思考他的理念，而作出一些獨立的選擇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案罪成的45名被告，分成六批求情，首批為被控方指為初選組織者的5人，包括認罪的戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟4人；及發起「三投三不投」、被裁定罪成的吳政亨，預計需時3天。前立法會議員邵家臻今晨8時許到場，指初選案被告不乏「舊同事、老拍檔，好多都係我好尊敬嘅人」，從眾人被捕到被囚，「陪咗佢哋行咁多年」，到今天進行陳情「冇理由唔喺度」，「見到佢就見啦，聽到佢就聽啦，都希望畀佢哋見到我哋，畀佢知道其實都好多人喺唔同崗位關心緊佢哋」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;邵說，「唔敢諗」各被告會說些什麼，指作為在囚者，他們面對歷史、面對法庭，思考會複雜很多，故不會對他們的說話有很多預設，「只係想見吓佢哋，畀佢見吓我哋，同埋聽到佢哋把聲，咁就好好㗎喇」，並想向47人說：「不要怕，我們有彼此。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nZcavSo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷自2022年9月後未再公開於法庭露面，曾探望他的邵家臻說，戴已適應監房生活，有自己的生活節奏和安排，像是何時讀報、寫作、祈禱、靈修等，戴常說規律令他心靈平靜、心定，以面對不斷變化的世界，邵形容「呢個係佢教我嘅功課」。戴耀廷將於7月12日迎來60歲生日，邵憶起有年他因收到太多生日卡被鎖，苦笑「個世界我哋真係唔係好認識點解會係咁」，他又說，「我哋嘅心意已經畀左佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案罪成的45名被告，今（25日）起於西九龍法院（暫代高院）分成六批求情，首批為被控方指為組織者的5人，包括戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及吳政亨，3人還柙至今逾3年3個月。其中戴耀廷自2022年9月案件管理聆訊後，首度在法庭公開露面，他頭髮灰白，神情輕鬆，頻頻向太太和旁聽人士微笑點頭，又展露笑容揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《國安法》第22條採用三級刑期分級制，「首要分子或罪行重大」可囚10年至終身監禁。控方同意各被告可按參與程度採用不同刑期等級，區諾軒等以從犯證人身分作供亦可獲減刑，但說組織者不屬「首要分子」是有違常理。法官陳慶偉一度問，控方指稱哪些被告為「首要分子」、「積極參加者」和「其他參加者」，控方表示難以回答。法官指控方必然有立場，若法庭裁定戴耀廷為最高刑期3年的「其他參加者」，肯定控方會立即提出上訴，戴聞言大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方引內地刑法的釋義及實用指南詮釋「首要分子」定義，法官李運騰亦關注終院明言不考慮與《國安法》無關的內地法律，控方做法是「走後門」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被告由10懲教分開就坐-戴耀廷神情輕鬆&quot;&gt;被告由10懲教分開就坐 戴耀廷神情輕鬆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，控方代表為副刑事檢控專員萬德豪、周天行、助理刑事檢控專員羅天瑋。戴耀廷由資深大律師黃繼明代表，趙家賢由大律師利琛代表，區諾軒和鍾錦麟由大律師陳慕賢代表，吳政亨由大律師石書銘代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已還柙至今逾3年3個月的5人，今早約10時步入法庭，由10名懲教人員隔開，分成三行就坐。其中吳政亨坐在最上排、離公眾席最近的位置，戴耀廷則坐在中間一排、位處欄內較中央，至於任從犯證人的區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟則坐在離公眾席最遠的位置，區坐最上排、趙坐中間、鍾坐最前排，各人與戴和吳相隔約5至10米距離，並由懲教隔開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;自2022年9月未有在法庭露面、下月踏入60歲的戴耀廷，一頭灰白頭髮、戴幼框眼鏡，身穿白色上衣、黑色西裝外套入庭，不少旁聽人士站起興奮向他揮手。戴精神不俗、神情輕鬆，頻頻向旁聽席微笑點頭，又向律師揮手。戴黑框眼鏡、穿藍色襯衫的區諾軒，微微仰頭向旁聽席四處張望，並向親友咧起牙齒。趙家賢穿黑色運動外套，身型消瘦；鍾錦麟則穿黑色西裝、戴口罩，向律師雙手抱拳。穿白色有領襯衫、黑色外套的吳政亨，亦向親友做口型和手勢溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;資深大律師石永泰、大律師吳靄儀、前立法會議員邵家臻等均有到庭。至於同案其他罪成被告分成兩個延伸庭收看直播，其中二號法庭共有余慧明、吳敏兒、袁嘉蔚、何桂藍、鄒家成、譚凱邦及劉頴匡7人。鄒及劉向旁聽人士揮手及微笑。劉的女友 Emilia 亦有到庭。至於一號法庭則有施德來、彭卓棋、鄭達鴻、伍健偉、梁晃維、馮達浚6人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方國安法最低刑期適用於串謀罪&quot;&gt;控方：《國安法》最低刑期適用於串謀罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案被告被控串謀顛覆國家政權，根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方副刑事檢控專員萬德豪先作陳詞。他認為《國安法》第22條的刑期分級制及最低刑期，均適用於串謀罪。他解釋，《刑事罪行條例》第159C條有關串謀罪的罰則，列明可處的刑罰須與有關實質罪行的嚴重程度（gravity）相稱，而根據相關立法文件，條文用意是要令串謀罪的判刑與有關實質罪行一致（in line）。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 控方副刑事檢控專員 萬德豪&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指，《國安法》第22條設立最低刑期，其立法原意清晰，明顯因該嚴重罪行有廣泛社會關注，要判處阻嚇性的刑罰。而由於串謀罪判刑須與實質罪行的嚴重程度相稱，因此就串謀罪條文的唯一解讀，就是《國安法》的刑期分級制和最低刑期同樣適用。法官李運騰一度質疑，控方未必是唯一正確的解讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指，雖然《刑事罪行條例》立法的1996年，《國安法》尚未出現，但立法者當時肯定已預想有類似情況出現，才提及須與罪行的嚴重程度相稱。李運騰一度問，控方能否舉例1996年時，本港有什麼其他罪行設最低刑期，又指控方就條文的詮釋也有限度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方確認視乎參與程度劃分刑期等級&quot;&gt;控方確認視乎參與程度劃分刑期等級&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問及控方對涉同一串謀的被告，判刑時是否採用同一刑期等級的立場，萬德豪確認刑期等級視乎各被告的參與程度及在串謀的角色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續引述辯方陳詞，認為「首要分子」應是指當選進入立法會投票否決預算案的參與者，至於「35+計劃」組織者則不屬「首要分子」。惟萬德豪指說法不可接受、違反常理，認為組織者發起整個串謀，必然是首要分子。他又舉例，若有人買兇殺人，若說這個主腦並非首要分子，不可能是正確，因「沒有主腦，就不會有刺殺」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方引內地刑法詮釋-官質疑走後門&quot;&gt;控方引內地刑法詮釋 官質疑「走後門」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「首要分子」的定義，萬德豪指內地刑法第105條提到的「首要分子」，與《國安法》第22條的「首要分子」類同，而根據《中華人民共和國刑法》釋義及實用指南，「首要分子」是牽涉組織罪行的犯罪者，可以是組織者或領導者。不過法官李運騰質疑，本港法庭有多大程度可以依賴內地法律，並指根據呂世瑜案，終院指《港區國安法》須與維護國家安全的全國性法律銜接，而不是與無關的內地法律銜接，並問控方所引用的內地刑法是否與《港區國安法》相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方堅稱法庭可以接納透過內地刑法來理解《港區國安法》，因為兩者使用相同字眼。惟李運騰質疑，控方所引條文是適用於所有內地刑法的一般原則，而非有關國安法的特定法律，問控方引入終院所排除的內地法律，是否「走後門」。控方否認，重申相關法律和字眼相近，是以具邏輯的方式去詮釋內地法律，因此能應用於本案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問控方如何分類被告參與程度-控方指非常困難&quot;&gt;官問控方如何分類被告參與程度 控方指非常困難&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後要求控方指出，指稱哪些被告為「首要分子」、「積極參加者」和「其他參加者」，並指毋須即時回答。萬德豪指這是非常難以回答的問題，陳慶偉隨即表示：「當然我會問困難的問題！」，在延伸庭的劉頴匡及吳敏兒聞後大笑。萬續指問題令控方陷入困難的位置，因需要考慮所有因素再決定判刑。但陳慶偉指控方必然有立場，舉例辯方指戴耀廷應屬「其他參加者」，相信控方不會接受，坐在萬德豪旁、代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明即反問「為何不能」，多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬回應，認為一個領導者應是首要分子。陳慶偉續指，若法庭將戴裁定為最高刑期3年的「其他參加者」，「我肯定你會立即提出上訴。」戴聞言哈哈大笑，延伸庭的譚凱邦、劉頴匡、吳敏兒、袁嘉蔚及余慧明亦大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方同意從犯證人作供可減刑&quot;&gt;控方同意從犯證人作供可減刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬其後指，認為負責組織謀劃的被告應為「首要分子或罪行重大」，有積極參與角色的被告則是「積極參加者」，若不屬上述兩者，則為「其他參加者」。而法庭量刑時，可首先判斷被告屬哪一刑期等級，其後考慮該等級中的量刑起點，再考慮相關加刑或減刑因素，包括被告是否符合《國安法》第33條中，「揭發他人犯罪行為」或「提供重要線索以偵破其他案件」的減刑條件。法官問，任從犯證人的區諾軒和趙家賢，是否屬於「揭發他人犯罪行為」，控方確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續質疑，條例字眼為「揭發」，但本案被告並非報案，而是審訊期間在庭上作供。控方回應「揭發」是籠統（general）的說法，而庭上作供亦算是「揭發」的一種，屬提供協助。戴耀廷聞後點頭。控方續指，若法庭裁定被告符合條例的求情因素，則要考慮給予「從輕處罰」還是「減輕處罰」。前者是在等級中給予較輕刑期，後者則是降低等級。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，吳政亨高舉拳頭，戴耀廷則伸直右手微笑揮動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」案，共45人罪成。被控方指為組織者的戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟及吳政亨5人，今（25日）開始求情。代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明表示，本案是以串謀罪、而非《國安法》罪行定罪，故顛覆罪的刑期分級制並不適用。黃並指，戴耀廷真誠相信「35+計劃」合法，以非暴力手段，運用憲制權力爭取普選；而他在《國安法》生效後角色有限，他不會投票否決預算案、亦無法控制或指揮其他人，並非「首要分子」，建議法庭以3年監禁為量刑起點，考慮戴認罪扣減至2年。黃並指，有人或認為建議「太有野心甚至大膽」，但相關刑期實屬合適。法官李運騰一度笑言，辯方說法的確「有點大膽」，法官陳慶偉聞言大笑。法官陳仲衡亦一度問，若戴耀廷為「其他參加者」，那誰是「首要分子」和「積極參加者」？陳慶偉再次大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方被告就串謀罪定罪-國安法刑期分級制不適用&quot;&gt;辯方：被告就串謀罪定罪 國安法刑期分級制不適用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早就量刑原則完成陳詞後，由代表戴耀廷的資深大律師黃繼明陳詞。根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃繼明表示，被告是就《刑事罪行條例》下的串謀罪被定罪，而不是就《國安法》罪行定罪；《國安法》的量刑可用作參考，但刑期分級制和最低刑期並不適用，法庭量刑時唯一考慮，應是《刑事罪行條例》第159C條有關串謀罪的罰則，而相關罰則沒有列明最低刑期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今早提到，認為2020年生效的《國安法》刑期分級制，適用於1996年增補的《刑事罪行條例》串謀罪罰則。黃質疑控方如何能將《國安法》套用至24年前的條文、並聲稱這一直是該條文的立法原意，形容做法「荒謬」；又指正確的做法，應是事後再立法，像今年3月生效的《維護國家安全條例》第109條，列明有關《國安法》罪行罰則的條文，亦適用於串謀罪的罰則。惟黃強調，該條文沒有追溯力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方國安法減刑因素屬一般因素&quot;&gt;辯方：國安法減刑因素屬一般因素&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃又指，串謀罪罰則無提及最低刑期，就最嚴重的謀殺罪，亦只列明「可」就串謀罪判終身監禁，控方不能指最低刑期適用。黃又追溯條文立法歷史，指立法原意是打破原有串謀罪判刑的7年上限，令法庭有更大自由和酌情權根據實質罪行的嚴重性量刑，而非反過來限制法庭量刑的最低刑期。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，辯方認為最低刑期不適用於串謀罪，那《國安法》第33條有關自動放棄犯罪等可減刑的條文，是否同樣不適用？黃回應，作為非國安法案件，毋須使用第33條，因條文提到的減刑因素亦屬一般減刑因素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷一方倡以3年為量刑起點-官指有點大膽&quot;&gt;戴耀廷一方倡以3年為量刑起點 官指「有點大膽」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續表示，戴2020年7月1日《國安法》生效後，真誠相信計劃並非違法，認為法庭應採納3年監禁為量刑起點，考慮及時認罪等因素，扣減至2年。延伸庭有被告聞後互相討論，亦有人面露笑容。黃續指，有人或會認為2年的建議「太有野心甚至大膽」（too ambitious or even audacious），但辯方認為考慮相關法律原則和戴的個人情況，這是合適的刑期。法官陳仲衡指戴並非首次犯案，黃強調並非指戴沒有案底。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰其後一度笑言，正如辯方所言，辯方主張戴耀廷屬「其他參加者」的說法「有點大膽（a bit bold）」，法官陳慶偉大笑，戴耀廷亦微笑。黃繼明指，他不會就此道歉，強調自己並非輕易作出相關陳詞，「我認為我有權作出此陳詞，以恰當履行我的職責——不只是對我的當事人，而是對法庭。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指涉案言行國安法前合法-判刑不應考慮&quot;&gt;辯方指涉案言行《國安法》前合法 判刑不應考慮&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃續指，本案控罪日期自2020年7月1日開始，法庭判刑時不應考慮戴耀廷此前的言行；而戴此後的角色亦相對有限。法官李運騰指，雖然7月1日前的行為並非刑事罪行，但不代表與判刑不相關，形容是讓法庭考慮罪行嚴重性的「社會背景」（social setting）。法官陳仲衡亦指判詞已清楚裁定，無差別否決預算案並非恰當履行立法會議員職責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃回應，相關行為只是在《國安法》生效後才違法，若法庭予以考慮，是以戴在《國安法》生效前的言行懲罰他，這不能是正確。黃續反指，相關「社會背景」，就是戴耀廷與他人尋求以非暴力手段，運用憲制權力爭取《基本法》訂明的普選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，辯方是否不接受串謀是持續罪行？黃同意是持續罪行，但指協議於7月1日才一夜由合法變為非法，而控罪的嚴重性，應只是在於被告在《國安法》後愚蠢地沒有退出。陳慶偉續指，戴耀廷「不僅沒有停止，而是繼續」。黃承認戴在《國安法》生效後決定繼續進行串謀，爭取35+和否決權，至7月15日才退出，這也是他認罪的原因，但強調不能以他此前的言行判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方戴不能控制或指揮他人非首要份子&quot;&gt;辯方：戴不能控制或指揮他人、非首要份子&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡其後問，若辯方指戴耀廷為「其他參加者」，那本案誰是「首要分子」和「積極參加者」？陳慶偉再次大笑。法官李運騰亦指，基本上每個被告也說自己並非「首要分子」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/p77Udgm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image19&quot; /&gt;
▲ 法官 陳仲衡（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃繼明回應，本案涉以無差別否決預算案的「非法手段」顛覆政權，反問一個不會使用這非法手段、亦無法控制或指示其他人這樣做的人，如何是「首要分子」？他又指，本案有別於主腦買兇殺人，因在該情況，主腦能控制和聘用那名殺手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，不要忘記戴在7月6日和9日的訪問。根據判詞，戴會上提到「35+計劃」目標是取得立會過半並否決預算案。黃回應，戴是以法律學者、而非共謀者的身分發言，而相關片段正顯示他真誠相信初選和否決預算案是合法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷一方未完成求情，明天繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;45罪成被告明起求情 首批為被指組織者 戴耀廷、區諾軒等5人&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CxoEHgv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名組織及參與初選的民主派被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，31人認罪，不認罪16人中有14人被裁定罪成。45名罪成被告將於明（25日）日至8月5日起，分成6批求情。首批求情被告為被控方指為初選組織者的5人，包括認罪的戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟；及被裁定罪成的吳政亨，預計需時3天。他們均自首提堂起還柙，至今逾3年3個月，其中沒有作供、也沒有旁聽的戴耀廷，將自2022年9月案件管理聆訊後首度在法庭公開露面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據判詞，法官指戴耀廷為「35+計劃」大腦及主要推手；區諾軒負責聯絡和協調，在協助戴達到目標上扮演了關鍵角色，但作供時嘗試與戴劃清界線；民主動力趙家賢和鍾錦麟協助初選安排和後勤工作。至於發起「三投三不投」的吳政亨，法官指即使該運動可能是他自發，但肯定他已與戴耀廷有協議實行謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁，而揭發他人犯罪行為者可獲得減刑。料控辯雙方將會就被告是否採用同一刑期等級、是否屬首要分子等陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷被指為計劃大腦及主要推手-2022年後未露面&quot;&gt;戴耀廷被指為計劃大腦及主要推手 2022年後未露面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;首批求情的被告，為被指為初選組織者的戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟、吳政亨5人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中戴耀廷於2022年6月的交付程序認罪，自同年9月出席案件管理聆訊後，未有再到庭旁聽審訊。根據法官判詞，戴耀廷是「35+計劃」大腦及主要推手，首先提出立會過半的構想，並提倡運用否決權作手段，迫使特首對五大訴求讓步，又多次撰文提倡「攬炒」，目標是推翻香港政治制度。法官又指，戴出席了所有協調會議，對每區進展全盤掌握，並游說參與者跟隨其理念和目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指區諾軒予人感覺圖劃清界線&quot;&gt;官指區諾軒予人感覺圖劃清界線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於區諾軒、趙家賢和鍾錦麟3人為從犯證人，根據《國安法》第33條，他們或因揭發他人犯罪行為等而獲額外減刑。針對區諾軒，法官指他是「35+計劃」兩名組織者之一，負責聯絡和協調，他一直知道戴耀廷的目標，並在協助戴達到目標上，扮演了重要和關鍵的角色，但其後退出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指區作供時，予人感覺想一定程度與戴耀廷劃清界線，並縮短其參與的時間。法官又引述被問到戴耀廷是否騎劫「35+計劃」時，區回答要視乎個別參與者，法官指認為這是來自一名資深政客在指證曾與他站在同一陣線的人時，一個非常官腔的回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指民動負責初選安排後勤-未裁趙家賢可信性&quot;&gt;官指民動負責初選安排、後勤 未裁趙家賢可信性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於民主動力正副召集人趙家賢及鍾錦麟，判詞較少着墨，但提及戴耀廷和區諾軒邀請二人協助初選的安排和後勤工作，而戴於2020年2月與兩人會面，趙家賢和民動總幹事黎敬輝曾出席首次地區協調會議。趙家賢作供時，與區諾軒就協調會議情況的說法有出入，亦與鍾錦麟就民動何時加入初選有分歧，被何桂藍一方質疑可信性，不過判詞未有就此作出裁斷，並同時援引區諾軒和趙家賢就協調會議的證供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指吳政亨與戴有協議實行謀劃&quot;&gt;官指吳政亨與戴有協議實行謀劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;唯一受審後被裁定罪成、被指為「組織者」的吳政亨，被指發起「三投三不投」推動初選。法官在判詞指，吳與戴耀廷就初選事宜頻繁交流，即使「三投三不投」可能是吳自行發起，但他並非單獨行事，肯定吳在《國安法》前，已與戴同意推行涉案謀劃並有意實施。雖然其他參加者不知道吳的參與，但吳知道有其他候選人，並採取行動確保只有初選勝出者才能參與立法會選舉，吳與戴之間的協議，跟戴和其他人之間的協議是相同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;刑期三級制-官指示就是否採同一等級陳詞&quot;&gt;刑期三級制 官指示就是否採同一等級陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據悉，法庭6月初向控辯雙方發指示，指由於《國安法》下顛覆國家政權罪設有3級刑期等級，而本案被告被裁定為同一串謀的一分子，要求雙方就多項議題陳詞，包括所有被告應否採用同一刑期等級；如否，為何不同被告應採用不同等級；以及如採用不同等級，個別被告應採用哪個等級、建議量刑起點為多少、有何求情因素，以及有否任何符合《國安法》第33條的求情因素，包括自動放棄犯罪、自動投案及揭發他人犯罪行為等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;14人被裁罪成-認罪被告待審後一併判刑&quot;&gt;14人被裁罪成 認罪被告待審後一併判刑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案所有被告於2022年7月完成交付至高院的程序，先後共31人認罪。認罪被告同年9至11月進行案件管理聆訊，只有區諾軒和鍾錦麟望審訊後判刑，趙家賢則與控方達成協議，將在裁決後判刑，另有17名擬認罪被告表示望審前判刑。不過法官最終拒絕被告申請，決定擬認罪被告於審後才一併判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於16名不認罪被告，案件去年2月開審，12月完成結案陳詞，審訊歷時118日。案件5月30日裁決，當中除劉偉聰、李予信2人外，其餘14人均被裁定罪成，須即時還柙。律政司就劉偉聰的無罪裁決提出上訴，沒有就李予信的無罪裁決提出上訴，罪成被告則分成6批求情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rrslEnV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;16人不認罪-31人認罪&quot;&gt;16人不認罪 31人認罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案16名不認罪被告為：鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄、柯耀林、李予信、余慧明及吳政亨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪的31人，包括：戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟、袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、徐子見、岑子杰、毛孟靜、馮達浚、劉澤鋒、黃之鋒、譚文豪、李嘉達、譚得志、胡志偉、朱凱廸、張可森、黃子悅、尹兆堅、郭家麒、吳敏兒、譚凱邦、劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆、岑敖暉、王百羽、伍健偉及林景楠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當中僅呂智恆、林景楠和黃子悅獲保釋，惟黃另涉理大衝突案，承認暴動判囚37個月。其餘被告均還柙至今逾3年3個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somalia faces a “crucial” – arguably existential – year as political and security deadlines start to converge. Referencing advances made in mid-2022, President Hassan Sheikh Mohammed (HSM) declared plans in August 2023 to liberate the country from the militant group al-Shabaab within five months. Speaking at RUSI in November, he revised the timeframe to late 2024, a date subsequently amended again to April 2025. But with a phased drawdown of the African Union’s Transitional Mission (ATMIS) set to conclude in December, the feasibility of these latest claims seems tenuous. The same issues haunting a decades-long process of state-building have sapped momentum from the current offensive, with elite conflict undermining confidence in the federal government’s (FGS) ability to deliver, and state-level elections and constitutional disputes exacerbating political divisions. These problems were further complicated when, on New Year’s Day, Somaliland’s breakaway administration announced a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Ethiopia, the fallout of which continues to preoccupy Mogadishu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, faltering progress raises important questions. Clan-led, locally organised resistance to al-Shabaab had previously been cited as the missing ingredient in counterinsurgency efforts. The diminishing returns of recent years may now test such assumptions, (re)exposing the need for a coherent settlement if military advances are to become a sustainable basis for consolidated governance. With only six months left on ATMIS’s mandate, international attention drawn to emergencies in other parts of the world, and political turmoil in Mogadishu, HSM’s strategic aspirations are at risk of floundering only two years into his second term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spent-optimism&quot;&gt;Spent Optimism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HSM began his second stint at the helm in May 2022. Early indications suggested that reconciliation would be a priority, repairing ties with external donors and Somalia’s various federal member states (FMSs) after the controversial tenure of his predecessor, President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed (“Farmaajo”). Dealing with al-Shabaab was seen as a subsidiary of these wider efforts, reflected in HSM’s tacit acknowledgement of the need for a negotiated solution. However, the initial focus on political unanimity quickly gave way to military exigency as, in June 2022, Hawiye clan-members – weary of jihadist extortion, aid appropriation, and forced conscription – launched an extraordinary campaign of resistance across Galgaduud and Hiraan. Keen to leverage local resentment, the federal government in Mogadishu started to provide support – including weapons and ammunition – laying the groundwork for a fresh offensive in August. Under a rubric of “total war”, the new president threw his full weight behind the push, supplementing kinetic operations with a concerted effort to counter al-Shabaab’s ideology and revenue streams, both by clamping down on companies paying the group’s taxes and by systematically targeting false bank and money-transfer accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With air support provided by Turkey and the US, accompanied by the logistical backing of ATMIS, these approaches yielded remarkable gains. Reinforced by the Somali National Army (SNA), Hawiye militiamen – referred to as “Macawiisley” for the sarongs that many wear – took control of settlements across Central Somalia, with more than 215 locations reportedly “liberated”. By November 2022, international commentators were suggesting that the offensive could bring an end to al-Shabaab altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successes were billed as a turning point in Somalia’s bid to defeat the group, a shift to relying on local anti-Shabaab sentiment rather than foreign forces. However, any optimism was relatively short lived. Attempts to galvanise clan support beyond areas where the resistance had first started proved difficult, and militants began to conduct high-casualty retaliatory attacks. Most concerningly, it was clear that the SNA and Macawiisley were struggling to keep hold of newly reclaimed territories and protect civilians, leaving communities susceptible to al-Shabaab blackmail and taxation. Clans suffered significant losses and various elders sought to reconcile with the group, agreeing “peace deals” in exchange for safety. Momentum began to slow in early 2023, and the offensive was effectively put on hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is no indication that the government has learned from previous mistakes, including hasty and uncoordinated military movements, political infighting and a failure to deliver services to those in newly “liberated” areas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions subsequently turned to a second phase, referred to as Operation Black Lion. With “frontline states” (Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti) pledging additional military support, it had been suggested that operations would expand into southern Somalia, where al-Shabaab are comparatively well entrenched and enjoy broader support. In March 2023, HSM announced the offensive’s resumption. However, the focus remained on Galgaduud and Hiraan, largely due to the initial failure to consolidate early gains. To date, there has been little-to-no progress in Jubaland or South-West State, where political divisions and local demographics present significant obstacles. The proposed involvement of frontline states has all but been forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking to galvanise the support of clans and resurrect the offensive, the president spent considerable time on the frontline, visiting Mahas in Hiiraan and Adan Yabal in Middle Shabelle, and basing himself out of Galmudug’s Dhusamareb for three months. But operations in late 2023 were not nearly as successful as those in the second half of 2022. In August, the government experienced significant setbacks. Militants routed the SNA in Osweyne, Galmudug, and troops were withdrawn from several other locations, including El Dheer, Gal’ad, Budbud and Masagaway. The defence minister was criticised for exposing an inexperienced unit at Osweyne, and concerns were raised around the impact of endemic corruption on the army’s combat capabilities. Some sources also claim that regional leaders like Ahmed Mohamed Islam (Madobe) in Jubaland hesitated before joining the offensive, in part because of a lack of belief in the government’s ability to reinforce local efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By late 2023, a “Super El Niño” brought operations to a standstill once again as the country grappled with flooding and its dire humanitarian consequences. By the time the rains subsided, HSM had become preoccupied with two other existential challenges to Somalia’s state-building process. First, an agreement between Hargeisa and Addis Ababa – which would reportedly provide Ethiopia with access to the sea in exchange for recognition of Somaliland’s independence – presents a significant challenge to Somalia’s sovereignty. Second, efforts to rush through major constitutional changes have been met by fierce opposition and renewed divisions between the federal government and FMS leaders (in April, Puntland declared it was cutting formal ties with Mogadishu and has since strengthened relations with Ethiopia).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As recently as 17 April 2024, the government still insisted that al-Shabaab would be defeated “by 2025”. Such repeated declarations are unrealistic and risk further undermining faith in the FGS. The reality is that there has been little evidence of any substantial gains in recent months, civilians continue to be displaced by violence, and morale among SNA troops remains low. Moreover, amid growing donor fatigue, there is no indication that the government has learned from previous mistakes, including hasty and uncoordinated military movements, political infighting and a failure to deliver services to those in newly “liberated” areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, buoyed by an increase in local support following the deal between Addis and Hargeisa, al-Shabaab attacks continue apace across the country. The group stepped up the frequency of its operations over the recently concluded Ramadan period, particularly in Mogadishu, while also consolidating its control of adjacent areas across Middle and Lower Shabelle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Mogadishu’s response to the MoU has entrenched fears for Somalia’s security once African Union forces depart. In early June, the National Security Advisor declared that Ethiopian troops would not be part of any post-ATMIS arrangement. The announcement came as a shock to many. The Ethiopians – both as part of ATMIS and present on a unilateral basis – play an essential role in efforts against al-Shabaab. While Mogadishu was perhaps seeking to capitalise on anti-Ethiopian sentiment in some parts of the country, the move has undermined fragile reparations between the FGS and the FMSs, particularly South-West State and Jubaland which rely on the Ethiopians to keep al-Shabaab at bay. It is unclear how Mogadishu will sustain any offensive operations without the support of Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intractable-problems&quot;&gt;Intractable Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite “more progress in [2022] than…in the previous five years”, any genuine appraisal of HSM’s military timeframes must therefore fall back on a familiar script of delays, inefficacy and missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the days of mass desertion have passed, and commendable improvements are being made, the SNA arguably remains less a national army than a “strategically deployed brand”, a “Fabergé” confection of militiamen beset by graft, amateurism and a clan-centric disposition. The security sector development plan endorsed back in December may be encouraging, as is the lofty aspiration of training 40,000 law enforcement personnel across the regional and federal level. But after more than $1 billion in external assistance, there is no getting away from the fact that Somalia still resembles a fragmented, highly congested “security arena”. Delineating between army, police, militia and bandit continues to be difficult, with an “informal economy of clans, conflict [and] entrepreneurialism” driving the pursuit of profit and power. As a result, institutional affiliations are often secondary to the rentier logic of a thriving political marketplace, one enabled (or actively encouraged) by poorly coordinated donor funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, the challenge – as with Operation Badbaado I and II in 2019–21 and the Gulwade Plan of 2014 – is not so much the recapturing as the holding of territory. Yes, there is improvement: community sensitivities are increasingly baked into stabilisation programmes from the outset, and internationally backed schemes are pushing for quicker delivery, greater contextual specificity, and better expectation management. But after years of inefficiency, or outright criminality, there is scant public confidence in the reliability of federal troops. Instead, garrison operations have been regularly delegated to elite units like Somalia’s Danab Brigade or Turkish-trained Gorgor Commandos – counterterrorism outfits with little experience in, or resourcing for, local policing. This both hampers SNA force-generation (sapping manpower from any new offensive) and risks squandering much-needed technical expertise as specialist battalions are attritted by excessive demands. Unfortunately, the impending departure of African Union peacekeepers (and European financiers) will only further accentuate these difficulties. Speaking to the Economist in October, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Ali Mohamed Omar conceded: “we don’t have the [men necessary] to hold on to…positions that will be vacated by ATMIS”. Members of the security services expressed similar concerns: “we are not ready to face [al-Shabaab] alone”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these strategic and military issues stem from wider political problems. Rifts over land expropriation, displacement, the creation of “mono-clan” districts and enclave cities, and enduring patterns of “ethno-hegemony” have fed violence since the late 1980s. At the same time, long-standing rivalries between different tiers of government have left the Somali state akin to a “disassembled patchwork of public authorities and political entrepreneurs”, lacking any real capacity or inclination to standardise policy. In this context, al-Shabaab is the most pronounced but far from the only symptom of a more complex conflict ecosystem, one reducing various iterations of Western “state-building” – often an embellished synonym for top-down technocracy – to propping up shell structures starved of any legitimacy or local relevance. Many criticised Farmaajo’s “security first, everything else afterwards” approach for being too reductive, ignoring the socio-economic, political and humanitarian crises that drive militancy in the first place. But having prioritised temporary clan coalitions above broad-based reconciliation, HSM arguably fell into a similar trap by conflating anti-Shabaab sentimentality with FGS support. These dynamics are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Somalia’s powerbrokers and their international partners need deadlines fitted around a credible plan, and not the other way around&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unresolved tensions quickly waylaid progress across Hiiraan, for instance, as Governor Ali Jayte Osman (a prominent figure in Macawiisley regional networks) fell out with President Ali Gudlawe of Hirshabelle over revenue disbursements once al-Shabaab had been cleared, “souring” the government’s ties to several sub-clans. As Daisy Muibu, a security expert, likewise describes, Hawiye-majority army units clashed with EU/UN-trained Darwish policemen over tax collection and checkpoint control in South-West State, reflecting the inherent fragility of recovery efforts as inter-communal rivalries, resource competition, and historical grievances impede cooperation between ostensibly “allied” forces. The latest political disputes and constitutional changes have escalated this friction further. Complaints are mounting over delayed state elections, and sittings of the National Consultative Council – a coordination body – remain ad hoc at best, and boycotted at worst. Following Puntland’s protest over the expansion of HSM’s executive powers and replacement of Somalia’s clan-based [s]electorate with universal suffrage, not only does the FGS’s proposed timeline for military victory look doubtful, but the country’s sovereign integrity also appears increasingly precarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-same-tough-questions&quot;&gt;The Same Tough Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lifting of a decades-long arms embargo in December 2023 can help modernise the SNA, improving mechanisation, morale and mobility. Five additional Danab training centres will similarly scale up Somalia’s security capabilities, and debt relief could provide a financial lifeline for development and economic investment, especially if the World Bank can delay a transition from grants to loans. But in the absence of a convincing peace dividend, wider social contract, or robust policing, many residents may continue to see al-Shabaab governance as a safer, more expedient bet. Militant courts are regularly considered the preferred avenue for civil arbitration, even among some Somali officials, and the group’s taxmen continue to extort businesses, clan elders, civil servants and NGOs across FGS-held areas. In Kismayo alone, companies previously shelled out “between $300–$600 monthly depending on their size”, amounting to around $6 million a year. Though al-Shabaab’s reach was briefly tempered in the early months of the offensive, they seem to have rebounded in full force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenging these perceptions requires a comprehensive political settlement, one that is unlikely to be delivered via federal fiat. This raises difficult questions. Some experts envisage a “type of Somali statehood that is much more horizontal, organised around alliances between major trading states which will have to bargain resources and power-sharing [among] themselves”. Others reject this premise entirely, with many donors and FGS leaders pushing for an increasingly centralised polity. Whatever the compromise, a workable arrangement needs genuine buy-in from a sufficient cross-section of Somali society, which in turn requires dialogue and deal-making. HSM’s priorities in the early months of his tenure were correct, as regional analysts like Aden Abdi and Alexander Ramsbotham argue: reconciliation cannot be dismissed as an “appendix or afterthought”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of political consensus has immediate implications. The achievements of 2022 are considered by many to vindicate a locally owned, clan-led strategy, with Mogadishu empowering Darwish and Macawiisley forces – groups benefiting from legitimacy among their host communities – rather than relying exclusively on an unpopular, partisan and functionally lacklustre army. Despite numerous imperfections, such an approach can start to offer comparatively effective security provision, and appears to currently be the only realistic pathway for doing so. However, it is unlikely to succeed unless nested within a wider political framework, one that combines security with predictability, opportunity, sustainable social development, and peacebuilding. Without these ingredients, the experiment will likely yield diminishing returns, as clans see less and less reason to collaborate with federal authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, a negative feedback loop is not inevitable. Though lost momentum today risks reduced support tomorrow, progress is not just a product of military action. Gains require engagement and dialogue, coherence and political consensus which local and national stakeholders can see, believe and invest in. This takes time, money and political capital, and cannot simply be willed away or ignored in an effort to accommodate donor schedules. Nor can individual achievements – lifting the arms embargo, passing the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries completion point or gaining a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council – substitute for a clear strategy. Somalia’s powerbrokers and their international partners need deadlines fitted around a credible plan, and not the other way around; anything less could turn stagnation into outright regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azerbaijan’s success in Karabakh has sealed President Ilham Aliyev’s legacy, finally drawing him out of his father’s shadow. Yet, amid the celebration of reunification, the population is beginning to refocus on domestic issues, namely the repression of political opposition and media freedoms by the state. Azerbaijan’s rapid rise in geopolitical influence places it in a dominant negotiating position over Armenia. However, months after they began, peace talks are still meandering in the preliminary stages. Ultimately, peace does not suit Aliyev, and the West should be cautious about repeating the same mistakes that it made with Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three decades, Azerbaijan finds itself without a foreign military presence within its borders, symbolising its emergence as an independent global actor pursuing its own interests. Now a rising power within the region, Azerbaijan is poised to leverage its position as a bridge between the West and Central Asia, bolstered by increased European imports of Azerbaijani fossil fuels. Through an emerging multi-vector foreign policy, Azerbaijan is cautiously balancing relations between the West and Russia. However, Aliyev’s increasing military spending and irredentist state rhetoric underscore potential territorial ambitions, which should send a clear warning signal to the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;does-azerbaijan-need-peace&quot;&gt;Does Azerbaijan Need Peace?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peace process between Armenia and Azerbaijan has been a stagnant one. Border skirmishes, domestic unrest, and a long-held mutual distrust have impeded prospects of peace. Yet, the recent transfer of four villages from Armenia’s Northeastern Tavush province to Azerbaijan is a decisive move in delineating the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, as well as a crucial positive step towards a sustainable peace agreement after three decades of war. Despite this progress, there is a clear imbalance in the momentum emanating from Yerevan and Baku, with the latter clearly much more languid in its efforts. Despite Armenian concessions, Azerbaijan still occupies internationally recognised Armenian territory and, after the flight of 120,000 Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh, has set about bulldozing Armenian settlements within the region, including the destruction of churches and monuments. Baku is well aware of its military dominance within this dyadic relationship, and this confidence has led to prolonged peace negotiations which are frequently stalled by Azerbaijan’s strategic manoeuvring. For example, the issue of the Zangezur corridor – a proposed transit route for Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhichevan – has transformed from a suggestion to an outright demand before a peace deal can be agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the significant historical grievances between them, difficult concessions will need to be made by both sides. However, further increasing the concessions forced upon Armenia could exacerbate domestic protests, which are already destabilising this young democracy. This situation heightens the threat of Armenian populist movements, as evidenced by Arch-Bishop Bagrat Galstanyan’s “Tavush for the homeland” campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Aliyev’s increasing military spending and irredentist state rhetoric underscore potential territorial ambitions, which should send a clear warning signal to the West&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the status quo suits Azerbaijan’s interests, enabling it to continue to extract concessions from Armenia without an urgent need for a definitive peace settlement, as long as its unchallenged regional dominance continues. Following Aliyev’s landslide election victory, he finds himself at the pinnacle of his political career. With the successful operation in Karabakh under his leadership, he has effectively emerged from his father’s shadow, securing his legacy as an Azerbaijani national hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while Aliyev basks in his geopolitical triumph, domestic challenges remain prevalent. Press freedoms are increasingly restricted, with complete state control of domestic media, harassment and detainment of independent journalists, and a foreign agent law seemingly inspired by Russia’s oppressive media strategy. Political dissidents and oppositional civil society are blackmailed, arrested and tortured, with any challenge to Aliyev’s rule quickly stifled. It is important not to forget that Aliyev’s 92.12% win in the February elections was achieved through total media control and boycotts by the political opposition. While Azerbaijan’s economy has soared over the last decade, it remains dependent on fossil fuel exports, with increasing regional wealth disparity between Baku and other provinces, impacting educational standards among the rich and poor. Azerbaijan’s Dutch disease has previously led to rapid inflation, with little having been done to rectify the situation, save for a number of renewable energy projects aimed at increasing gas exports. Meanwhile, Aliyev continues to put an emphasis on greater militarisation, increasing defence and national security spending to 17.4% of the state’s budget. Now that Karabakh is unequivocally Azerbaijani and Armenia is looking to ameliorate relations, Azerbaijani society can finally refocus its attention on domestic concerns, and with this, even Aliyev’s manufactured support may struggle in the face of public discontent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both states suffer from irredentist elements within their constitutions, Azerbaijan’s military strength and authoritarian governance represents a much more pressing concern for regional stability. The concept of “Western Azerbaijan” – the idea that further Armenian territory historically belongs to Azerbaijan – has been utilised within the Azerbaijani parliament, with Aliyev also known to include this rhetoric in his speeches. Exploiting nationalist tendencies is a tried and tested method used by authoritarian states to divert the population’s attention away from the failings of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar manner to the Argentine military junta and the Falklands, or Vladimir Putin and the annexation of Crimea, one can expect to see Aliyev using this conflict to shore up his domestic political support when it ultimately begins to slide, as well as a clear trend towards exploiting ingrained anti-Armenian sentiments within Azerbaijani society. By fostering animosity towards Armenia, Aliyev will effectively consolidate power with minimal internal dissent. Aliyev’s political stronghold benefits from the current situation; Armenia is a convenient scapegoat, and the prospects of a sustainable peace agreement remain rocky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West appears to only be paying nominal attention. Yet not only is this issue playing out in Europe’s backyard, but it represents a microcosm of the rising global struggle between democracy and authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;treading-on-the-same-rake&quot;&gt;Treading on the Same Rake?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is a stark reminder of the threat posed by authoritarian regimes to Western security. While Azerbaijan’s policies may not directly threaten the West, its equidistant approach between Russia and Western powers raises significant concerns. As the West deepens its economic ties with yet another authoritarian state, the mirroring of errors made over the last decade is obvious, with the West indirectly financing another authoritarian state’s military ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the West escalate its dependence on Azerbaijani fossil fuels, it risks a recurrence of the Ukraine scenario, with Armenia paying the price for Western negligence. The ongoing tension between democracy and authoritarianism may require morals to take a backseat, but the West’s inconsistent adherence to its proclaimed values is exacerbating its global image problem. The consolidation of authoritarian power in the South Caucasus further erodes the foundational principles of the West, posing a direct challenge to its core values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As the West deepens its economic ties with yet another authoritarian state, the mirroring of errors made over the last decade is obvious&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By overlooking the risks associated with increasing economic support for another militarising authoritarian state, the West is demonstrating a failure to learn from repeated examples of authoritarian aggression. Despite Azerbaijan’s displays of concern over the threat of sanctions, the West has yet to fully leverage its economic weight to incentivise stability in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises a pertinent question over the future of Western rules-based ideals: do current geopolitical tensions require a pragmatic adaptation, or is supporting democracy in an increasingly authoritarian world a cornerstone of the liberal international order? Regardless of the decision that it comes to, if the West is to survive multipolarity, its stance must be clear and consistent. Peace is beneficial for the South Caucasus, but it may not suit its most powerful politician. The chances of conflict remain high in the region as long as the West fails to learn from its mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is facing a challenge to its global leadership in science and technology that is more serious than any it has confronted since gaining that position after World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the relatively short span of two decades, China has emerged as a formidable rival, mounting a concerted drive to dominate key technology-intensive sectors and increasingly matching or exceeding the United States in resources committed. At the same time, the U.S. Congress is bogged down in protracted struggles over public spending and the role of government that have engulfed needed investments in science, research, development, and education — the foundation of U.S. economic strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. private sector remains more innovative than its Chinese competitors, but its efforts are focused on developing consumer-oriented products. Meanwhile, the centralized Chinese system concentrates sustained, long-term government support in technology areas that have direct security-related implications — namely, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information science, and semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China technology rivalry, with its inherent asymmetries, has manifest strategic implications that can ultimately determine the outcome of a potential military confrontation, should one come about. Moreover, as U.S. technology leadership declines, the risks of economic and military challenges will rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited appreciation of the nature of this rivalry with China was recently underscored by the failure of the U.S. Congress to appropriate the funds previously authorized for the largest part of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, while simultaneously cutting the budgets of key federal science and technology agencies for fiscal year 2024. This is all the more disappointing, not to say alarming, given that the same week, China announced a 10 percent increase in its already significant levels of public spending on research and development (R&amp;amp;D).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;foundational-funding-for-chips-and-science-on-hold&quot;&gt;Foundational Funding for CHIPS and Science on Hold&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a major shift in U.S. policy, in August 2022 Congress passed the CHIPS and Science Act (“CHIPS Act”), which authorized and appropriated nearly $52 billion in federal investments to promote the creation and expansion of semiconductor manufacturing capacity and microelectronics R&amp;amp;D on U.S. soil. The act also authorized tax credits initially valued (pre-passage) by the Congressional Budget Office at $46 billion through 2031 for investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcoming this legislation, the White House said it “will boost American semiconductor research, development and production,” ensuring U.S. leadership in this foundational technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a concrete manifestation of the program, in March 2024 the Commerce Department announced $8.5 billion in federal grants for U.S. chipmaker Intel Corporation, to be augmented by $11 billion in concessional loans to support the company’s creation of new chipmaking capacity in the United States. That came one month after the administration announced a $1.5 billion grant for foundational chips to GlobalFoundries. Since March, the process has accelerated, with awards of $6.4 billion to Samsung, $6.6 billion to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), and $6.14 billion to Micron Technology for advanced DRAM (memory chip) production in the United States. These grants have unquestionably contributed to a massive surge in U.S.-based investments in semiconductor production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the $39 billion to support chip manufacturing, the CHIPS Act authorized a far larger expenditure of $174 billion for investment in the science, engineering, R&amp;amp;D, education, and workforce development that will underpin future advances in chip design and manufacturing, with the goal of assuring future U.S. leadership in this critical enabling industry. The principal federal recipients of these funds are to be the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Economic Development Administration (EDA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the funds allocated to chip manufacturing, however, these funds were authorized but not appropriated by Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FY 2024 congressional appropriation did not deliver on the CHIPS Act authorizations for science. Under the CHIPS Act, the NSF was to receive $81 billion over five years, doubling its budget by FY 2027, starting with $15.6 billion in FY 2024. Instead, in the FY 2024 budget, the NSF will receive just $9 billion, 42 percent of the CHIPS Act target, compounded by an 8 percent cut in its current budget. Commenting on these reductions, an NSF spokesperson observed that “it is difficult to place this in the context of the rapid, large-scale science investments by our competitors such as China with the express purpose of outcompeting the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FY 2024 budget also features additional funding cuts funding to NIST and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). And looking forward, President Joe Biden’s proposed budget for FY 2025 calls for programmatic increases for NSF and NIST, but not at the levels envisioned by the CHIPS Act, in a retreat from the goals set out in the act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is very little in the CHIPS Act benefiting the U.S. semiconductor design industry, which has recently lost major markets in China as a result of tightened U.S. export controls on chip technology to that country. U.S. design firms are not eligible for direct federal funding or investment tax credits under the act, yet they are a major source of competitive strength for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the failure to follow through on the promises of the CHIPS Act is not new. Much of the America COMPETES Act of 2007, which also authorized funding for the NSF and other federal science agencies, was never implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the current climate of geopolitical competition with China, a similar failure to fund the CHIPS Act provisions would represent a serious miscalculation. In the words of Matt Hourihan, a science specialist at the Federation of American Scientists, cuts “to agencies like NSF and NIST are frankly unconscionable in an era when we should be enhancing support for U.S. scientists and engineers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-innovation-drive&quot;&gt;China’s Innovation Drive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when science and innovation underpin both competitiveness and national strength, the comparisons with Chinese efforts are disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past two decades, wavering and erratic U.S. public support for science and technology stand in stark contrast with the massive and sustained Chinese effort to boost its innovation capabilities. In the 2010s, funding for R&amp;amp;D in the United States fell in real terms as federal spending was reduced across most categories. While these cuts satisfied short-term domestic political concerns, losses in R&amp;amp;D funding are not easily made up, and the effects endure. Emerging indicators suggest that China is closing the innovation gap with the United States, a development that should command the attention of U.S. policymakers and the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, the NSF released a report showing that while the United States still leads the world in R&amp;amp;D spending, with $806 billion in gross expenditures in 2021, China was close behind, at $668 billion. As recently as 2009, U.S. R&amp;amp;D outlays were more than double those of China (Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSF noted that with respect to indicators of global science, technology, and innovation (STI) capabilities, such as science and engineering (S&amp;amp;E) research publications, patents, and knowledge and technology intensive (KTI) industry output, “China has significantly increased its share of global STI capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is now the top producer of S&amp;amp;E publications and international patents and has the largest value-added KTI manufacturing output, at $2.4 trillion in 2021, versus the United States’ $1.4 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has long led the world in doctorate degrees awarded each year in the S&amp;amp;E field (Figure 2). However, in 2020 China, with nearly 43,400 degrees, surpassed the United States, with around 41,700. While China’s larger population clearly impacts comparisons, China nonetheless far surpasses the United States in first university degrees — which are essentially equivalent U.S. bachelor’s degrees — in S&amp;amp;E fields, graduating two million in 2020, more than double the 900,000 in the United States. In the case of degrees, patents, and publications, qualitative differences may be significant, but the scale of China’s aggregated indicators are worth noting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) national security think tank, in a 2023 analysis of research trends in 23 strategic knowledge-intensive sectors related to Australian national defense, found that China led advanced technological research in 80 percent of the sectors. ASPI found that state-led investment allowed China to surpass the United States, Europe, and Japan in areas including hypersonic, sonar, advanced underwater communications, post-quantum cryptography, and underwater drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A January 2023 study by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a U.S.-based think tank, found that “based on key indicators of innovation and advanced-industry performance, China has surpassed the United States in total innovation output.” Among the study’s key findings were that China is threatening U.S. and allied market share in advanced, high-value-added, and national security-critical industries. China is evolving “from an imitator to an innovator,” it said, and has demonstrated the capacity for world leadership in several advanced technologies, including supercomputers and high-speed rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study on Chinese innovation published by Cambridge University Press in 2023 characterized China as an emerging “juggernaut in science, technology and innovation,” citing a number of factors. According to the study, by 2021 China was spending double its 2015 R&amp;amp;D expenditure and 56 times the amount it spent in 1995, the year the government proposed a development strategy of “rejuvenating the nation with science, technology and education” (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GdgQroq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study also found that China has the largest talent pool in the world: in 2020, the number of total undergraduate degrees awarded in China was 7.97 million, with graduate degrees totaling some 662,450 and doctorates 66,175.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study of China’s innovation policies published by Oxford University Press observed that “in absolute values, such as R&amp;amp;D expenditure and the number of researchers, patents, and publications, China is now ranked first or second in the world.” The study added, “Examples of its scientific and technological prowess include the development of the world’s fastest supercomputer, China’s first single-aisle jet aircraft, high speed rail networks, fifth-generation (5G) communications networks, and a demonstrated ability to land a spaceship on Mars, along with a plethora of world-leading innovations in the digital economy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned previously, the United States continues to outspend China in gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;amp;D (GERD), although by a narrowing margin. The United States also outspends China in GERD as a percentage of GDP, spending 3.5 percent in 2021 compared to China’s 2.4 percent. However, these differences should not be grounds for complacency. It is notable that China’s R&amp;amp;D allocation differs from that of the United States, with a greater proportion of spending focused on applied research and development and more limited efforts on basic research which, through legitimate and illegitimate means, can be acquired from U.S. sources (Figure 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hY7KYOK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, U.S. R&amp;amp;D spending is spread out over a vast array of commercially oriented themes and industries, while Chinese investments are concentrated in several dozen strategically important high-tech sectors. Most of these sectors have defense-related implications and are focused not on the pursuit of breakthrough innovations but on the dominance of those sectors through more efficient manufacturing and commercialization of recent innovations, most commonly drawn from R&amp;amp;D initially conducted outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china&quot;&gt;China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Unprecedented Degree of Government Engagement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While government policy measures have played a key role in the development of high-tech industries in the United States, Europe, and East Asia, “the Chinese case offers a rare and unprecedented opportunity to examine state-led innovation as few other countries have intervened so systematically and invasively in their national innovation systems,” the Cambridge University Press study noted. In the United States, perennial internecine battles over the federal budget have led to continuing uncertainty over the scale and scope of the government’s innovation policies. In contrast, China’s government has pursued a consistent, long-range technology development effort for nearly two decades, albeit with adaptive adjustments for shocks such as the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the imposition of stringent technology export controls by the United States and its allies in and after 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-medium-and-long-term-plan&quot;&gt;The Medium and Long-Term Plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2006, the Chinese government promulgated its “Medium and Long-Term Plan (MLP) for the Development of Science and Technology (2006–2020),” which the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative described in 2018 as “the seminal document articulating China’s long-term technology development strategy.” The MLP featured a panoply of government measures to promote the development of “key fields and priority subjects,” including fiscal and tax measures, preferential government procurement, and “absorption” of imported technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MLP introduced the concept of “indigenous innovation,” defined as “enhancing original innovation through co-innovation and re-innovation based on the assimilation of imported technologies.” The concept of indigenous innovation has been carried forward in subsequent Chinese industrial developmental measures to the present day. However, indigenous is perhaps a misnomer. The 2018 study by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which looked at China’s misappropriation of U.S. technology, offered extensive evidence of that assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixteen “mega projects” were created in 2006 pursuant to the MLP to “help China master the core technologies of various strategic industries, driving the indigenous innovation effort.” According to one source, the government planned to invest $100 billion in these projects between 2006 and 2020. The megaprojects were tasked with the “assimilation and absorption” of technologies imported from outside China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MLP is a well-focused, well-funded, long-term effort supported by the Chinese government’s 11th, 12th, and 13th Five-Year Plans (2006–2020) for economic development. In addition, between 2006 and 2008, central government agencies published 79 innovation policies designed to implement the MLP, including sector-specific plans for key industries like semiconductors and renewable energy equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;made-in-china-2025&quot;&gt;Made in China 2025&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the continuity of these plans, in May 2015 the Chinese government announced its Made in China 2025 strategy, a 10-year, $300 billion plan for promoting manufacturing that “brought together all existing policies across related fields, some of the ‘strategic emerging industries,’ and targeted priorities in automation, IT, robotics, AI, and much more under one umbrella.” The Made in China 2025 strategy remains “consistent with the goal of ‘indigenous innovation.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also a remarkably ambitious strategy. With a goal of achieving global dominance in key technologies, it sets market share targets for designated industries and seeks to localize supply chains for those industries. China has set a target of being able to provide 70 percent of the key materials and components from domestic sources by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding for the strategy is equally ambitious. A prodigious volume of central and regional government funds flowed through many channels to participating firms in the form of equity investments, loans from government financial institutions, and huge public/private investment funds. Reflecting the government’s long-term commitment, China also established R&amp;amp;D centers across the country to develop priority technologies and support their commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, China has launched new large-scale “mega” or “high end” thematic R&amp;amp;D projects — described as “large scale infrastructures and expensive funding initiatives in strategic industries and frontier technologies” — continuing a policy tool introduced under the 2006 MLP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also set targets for achieving “green” and “smart” manufacturing in the key sectors, incorporating digital technologies in the effort, with the government designating “pilot demonstration projects” across the country to facilitate dissemination of newly developed technologies. These indigenous investments are complemented by government-supported investment funds that acquired foreign firms possessing technologies deemed to be supportive of China’s development effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;significant-economic-impact&quot;&gt;Significant Economic Impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s actions have proven effective and have even generated notable successes. As Professor Shirley Ze Yu, a political economist at Harvard’s Kennedy School, observed in March 2024, “Made in China 2025 is an exceptionally successful industrial strategy.” She went on to note, “In six years, China’s smartphone manufacturing surpassed 50 percent of the global market share. In eight years, China’s solar, wind and lithium battery production all rose to global dominance.” Although the Made in China 2025 strategy was initially “grossly underestimated,” it is now “considered in the West, especially in the United States, as a master plan for China to secure dominance in global technology, connected with the expansion of its global influence using the Belt and Road Initiative.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-innovation-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;China’s Innovation Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this progress, the widespread view that China’s bid for global technological leadership is relentless and unstoppable has its share of skeptics, and in fact the recent record of innovation successes masks systemic weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reliance-on-foreign-research&quot;&gt;Reliance on Foreign Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s total R&amp;amp;D spending, based on 2019 figures, allocates only around 6 percent of total outlays to basic research and 11 percent to applied research, compared with 16.6 percent and 19.2 percent, respectively, for the United States (Figure 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder is allocated to “experimental development” — that is, according to the NSF’s definition, “drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience and producing additional knowledge, which is directed to producing new products or processes or to improving existing products or processes.” Underfunding of basic and applied R&amp;amp;D presumes the continued ability to absorb foreign technology and manufacture products based on it. China’s R&amp;amp;D overspending on development at the expense of basic and applied research “may jeopardize the long-term prospect of the country’s scientific, economic, and social development,” scholars have found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the indigenous innovation approach, drawing upon the fruits of foreign research, may have enabled China to escape the consequences of its underdeveloped basic and applied research efforts. As the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), a European think tank specializing in China, observed in March 2024, “Most of the [technology] successes China can point to have some degree of foreign inspiration. Digital giants in search, e-commerce, ride hailing and social networking started by translating U.S. models to Chinese contexts.” MERICS went on to point out, “In hardware sectors like solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, smart phones, and commercial drones, Chinese overseas returnees and local entrepreneurs gained global market share by building on ideas and components pioneered elsewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AxTjM0s.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: R&amp;amp;D Expenditure by Type, United States and China, 2019.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Deitz and Freyman, The State of U.S. Science and Engineering 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as recent events have underscored, China’s degree of access to foreign technology, especially at the cutting edge, will not necessarily continue. The Biden administration is reportedly considering blacklisting Chinese semiconductor firms linked to Huawei Technologies and imposing sanctions on Chinese memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, “access to core components and technology is a prerequisite for China’s advancement in emerging industries,” MERICS scholars wrote in 2019. “Chinese tech firms have already gotten into serious trouble when cut off from access to chips or other high-tech components from abroad, as U.S. measures towards companies like ZTE and Huawei have proved.” The recent imposition of more stringent export controls on semiconductors, quantum computing, and AI technology by the United States and its allies has underscored this vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;encumbrances-of-government-involvement&quot;&gt;Encumbrances of Government Involvement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Chinese government’s deep involvement in innovation is often cited as a source of strength, it is also problematic. The 2023 ITIF study, which warns of China’s growing prowess in this regard, acknowledges that “state involvement in the Chinese economy will almost certainly hinder productivity growth.” But it is important to keep in mind that China is not seeking to maximize efficiency; rather, it strives to dominate strategic sectors with national security implications, and it is willing to spend heavily to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Chinese scientists sometimes complain that as they seek funding, they are “encumbered by arduous red tape,” while their peers are “becoming obsessed with recognition,” undermining the nation’s drive for innovation and technological self-sufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in August 2023, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology decreed that all mobile app providers must submit their business details to the government or face punishment, a move that Chinese software developers said will “stifle local innovation and hinder access to advances created overseas.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limited-freedom-to-think-and-associate&quot;&gt;Limited Freedom to Think and Associate&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China is graduating more students in S&amp;amp;E fields, it remains uncertain whether sheer numbers will be sufficient to move China ahead in innovation. One recent analysis observed that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;while innovation has been elevated to a very high status in China, and on the surface Chinese researchers are encouraged to think outside the box, equally important are the other ingredients of a true innovation culture, namely, autonomy, free access to the flow of information and especially dissent, both scientific and political, which at present are not adequately applauded or tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;growing-friction-with-trading-partners&quot;&gt;Growing Friction with Trading Partners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huang Yiping, dean of Peking University’s National School of Development, warned recently that China’s massive investments in high-tech manufacturing sectors could lead to overcapacity and friction with China’s trading partners, noting that the United States and Europe were moving to decouple their supply chains from China and invest in increased domestic production. “If it really turns into a relatively common wave of trade protectionism against Chinese products, it may actually be detrimental to our next stage of development, especially in innovation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet while it is true that China’s innovation system has weaknesses and vulnerabilities, China can point to spectacular achievements during the past decade in numerous technology-intensive fields. In virtually every case, China got its foothold through acquisition and adaptation of foundational foreign technology. But it has gone on to develop and improve manufacturing capability, frequently surpassing its foreign counterparts in quality and efficiency and eventually achieving a dominant global market position. As a 2023 study pointed out, “While the development of novel products and processes is obviously an important aspect of innovation, effective commercialization is at least as important.” And successful commercialization is essential for the revenue to fund the R&amp;amp;D to drive the next wave of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-growing-challenge-in-strategic-sectors&quot;&gt;A Growing Challenge in Strategic Sectors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, CSIS published a major study of the new controls imposed by the United States and its allies on technology exports to China, whose coauthors included William A. Reinsch, formerly in charge of U.S. export controls at the Department of Commerce. Although the study’s focus was on export controls, it concluded by stating that “the important question is not how to hold China back [through controls], as the U.S. capability for doing that is limited, but rather how to stay ahead. A strategy for that lies in the various U.S. policy initiatives enacted in the past two years, most notably the CHIPS Act, but that alone will be insufficient to achieve long-term U.S. strategic objectives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, the policies adopted amid much fanfare to address this existential competition are effectively stalled. The “science” portion of the CHIPS Act — the principal longer-term scientific promotion measure of the current administration — remains unfunded, a circumstance that may well continue for the foreseeable future. Congress, instead of dramatically expanding funding for federal science agencies, as in the Sputnik era, is reducing it. This is not an abstract problem. A survey of three critical cross-cutting foundational technologies that will enable many strategic technology sectors essential for U.S. national defense capabilities — AI, quantum technology, and semiconductors — indicates that while the United States may still lead in all three, China is rapidly closing the technology gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;Artificial Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is the development of computer systems to perform tasks and exercise cognitive functions that usually require human intelligence, such as decisionmaking, pattern recognition, problem solving, “learning” from available data, and translation of languages. It is rapidly being deployed across a broad range of human endeavors, transforming economies and societies. A high-stakes AI race, reminiscent of the U.S.-Soviet race to the moon in the 1960s, is emerging between the United States and China. Unlike the race to the moon, however, the race for AI has no short-term finish line. On the contrary, it involves competition across national innovation ecosystems including universities, small and large companies, and government funding and policy support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China recognizes this is a long-term contest and is taking a long-term view, with investments commensurate with the stakes. For example, in 2017 China’s State Council released its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan, which set 2030 as a target date by which China will achieve global leadership in AI, turn AI into a $150 billion domestic industry, and be the world leader in developing ethical norms and standards for AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WHAT ARE THE STAKES IN THE AI RACE?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy experts increasingly recognize the importance of AI in the context of national defense. AI can make multiple decisions and enable actions with a speed and performance level that, in the future, is expected to exceed the capabilities of human operators. “As AI does not get fatigued, does not forget, and has no emotional fluctuation, AI is expected to be able to help commanders make decisions by processing large quantities of data quickly and accurately,” the Japanese National Institute of Defense Studies said in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) was formed in 2018 to assess AI, machine learning (ML), and related technologies as they may affect U.S. national security and defense, and to make recommendations to the president and Congress. The commission released its final report in March 2021, which concluded that the United States “is not prepared to defend or compete in the AI era. . . . This is the tough reality that we must face,” in the words of Chair Eric Schmidt, former chief executive of Google, and Vice Chair Bob Work, a former deputy secretary of defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NCSAI warned that “for the first time since World War II, America’s technological predominance — the backbone of its economic and military power — is under threat. China possesses the might, talent, and ambition to surpass the United States as the world’s leader in AI in the next decade if current trends do not change.” The commission said that “our armed forces’ competitive military-technical advantage could be lost within the next decade if they do not accelerate the adoption of AI across their missions.” It also emphasized the potential consequences, asserting that “defending against AI-capable adversaries operating at machine speeds without employing AI is an invitation to disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NCSAI noted that while the U.S. private sector was making dramatic strides in AI, “commercial agendas are dictating the future of AI, and concentrating heavily in one discipline: machine learning (ML).” It added, “Despite promising moves, government funding has lagged behind the performative potential of the field, limiting its ability to shape research toward the public good and support progress across a range of AI disciplines. As a result, the [U.S.] AI innovation environment rests on a narrowing foundation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the NSCAI’s report was released three years ago, recent comments by industry and government experts indicate that the commission’s basic findings with respect to the national security dimensions of AI remain sound. This is reflected in both the scale of Chinese investments and their focus, which prioritize AI-related research in defense applications instead of consumer services such as the ChatGPT chatbot: Alexandr Wang, the founder of Scale AI, said in 2023 that while China’s People’s Liberation Army is spending between 1 and 2 percent of its annual budget on AI, the Pentagon is spending between 0.1 and 0.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-2023, Work, the former deputy defense secretary, commented that in “marginal terms, we’re flat and the Chinese are outspending us. This is why China is so different. In the past we’ve always been able to outspend our competitors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Horowitz said in a January 2024 interview that “the [AI] adoption capacity of the Department is improving . . . but we have more work to do, frankly, as we’ve been very public in stating.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PAYOFFS FOR CHINA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is making great strides in developing defense-related applications of AI. The 2023 ASPI assessment of research trends in 23 critical technology areas concluded that in six key thematic areas relevant to AI and autonomy, China already leads in three (Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9jrgfQH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense (DOD) is beginning to respond to the AI challenge. In 2022, Brookings released a study of all federal AI-related contracts in the preceding five years, and the next year it released a follow-up study covering August 2022 to August 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a five-year period from 2017 to 2022, it found a total of 472 AI-related federal contracts. In just the one-year span from 2022 to 2023, there were 489. The potential value of federal awards for AI research grew 1,200 percent in the 2022–23 period, to $4.6 billion, from $355 million over the preceding five-year period, primarily driven by the DOD (Figure 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cjLdCCE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Comparing Potential Value and Contract Counts, Past vs. New Contracts.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-evolution-of-artificial-intelligence-ai-spending-by-the-u-s-government/&quot;&gt;Jacob Larson et al., The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Spending by the U.S. Government (Washington, DC: Brookings, March 26, 2024)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as reported in Time, the Pentagon questioned the Brookings analysis, stating that DOD requested $874 million for AI research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&amp;amp;E) in FY 2022 and $1.8 billion in FY 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, the U.S. defense establishment is clearly increasing its commitment to AI, although whether this will match China’s effort is unclear. In its November 2023 strategy to promote the adoption of AI by the armed forces, the Pentagon’s stated goal was to “help accelerate the speed of commanders’ decisions and improve the quality and accuracy of those decisions, which can be decisive in deterring a fight and in winning a fight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deputy Secretary of Defense Horowitz disclosed in his January 2024 interview that with a program dubbed the Replicator Initiative, the Pentagon expects to be able to “field in the multiple thousands attritable autonomous systems in the next 18 to 24 months. . . . We’re on track to achieve that goal.” This could mean the deployment of thousands or tens of thousands of low-cost autonomous units for use in swarms which, from a cost standpoint, the United States could “afford to lose.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Turek, deputy director of the Information Innovation Directorate at the DOD’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), said at a March 2024 CSIS event that about 70 percent of all DARPA initiatives now have some form of AI, machine learning, and autonomy associated with them, with the broad goal of “preventing or creating strategic surprise.” He noted that technology firms like Microsoft, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google were all participating in a DARPA program and were providing access to state-of-the-art models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite such developments, as former deputy secretary of defense Work said in mid-2023, while the Pentagon is increasing its R&amp;amp;D spending on AI, it is not doing so at a pace sufficient to close the gap with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CREATING AN INSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration is creating an institutional architecture for the application of AI throughout the federal system. In October 2023, the administration released an executive order on AI that emphasizes safety, governance, and the establishment of standards and consumer protections; sets up task forces and advisory committees; and requires specific actions by big tech companies and federal agencies, including the promulgation of guidelines. The administration is requesting $3 billion for federal agencies’ use of AI in its FY 2025 budget and $300 million to increase agency funds for AI to address risks and advance AI’s use for the public good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The budget allocates $32 million to a National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot, which will provide AI researchers with the computational tools they need to conduct AI research. Federal agencies would get $70 million to establish chief AI officers (CAIO) to promote the use of AI and manage its risks. Meanwhile, an “AI talent surge,” aimed at boosting the federal talent pool with AI expertise, is allocated $32 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these measures will undoubtedly facilitate the application of AI in the federal agencies, they appear to be primarily focused on safety measures, consumer protection, and safeguards against abuses of AI. They are not focused on the strategic AI competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI CHALLENGES FOR CHINA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its gains in AI, China faces obstacles in its effort to capture world leadership in the field by 2030. While the government has been a critical actor in promoting the development of AI, its authoritarian character is, at times, counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2023, Chinese authorities proposed regulations for generative AI, requiring that all images and text must align with the “core values of socialism” and must not undermine state authority or national unity. At that time several Chinese companies had already launched chatbots but found it impossible to compete with U.S.-based OpenAI’s ChatGPT in part because of the many restrictions imposed by the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major U.S. advantage is that the private sector is investing heavily. According to the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered AI’s 2024 annual report, the United States leads China in private sector investment in AI by an enormous margin, with $67.2 billion invested in 2023 compared with $7.8 billion by China. U.S.-based “big data” companies like Meta, Google, and Microsoft are pouring large sums of money into AI research. The United States is also spawning AI start-ups at over three times the rate of China. OpenAI, a U.S. nonprofit AI research organization, launched ChatGPT in 2022 powered by a large language model, and it became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently imposed Western export controls are limiting China’s access to the leading-edge chips that are essential to drive advanced AI systems. China is unlikely to be able to produce such chips in volume by itself for a number of years, although Huawei’s recent announcement of seven-nanometer technology in its latest smartphone is a troubling sign for U.S. policymakers. Still, Paul Scharre, director of studies at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), noted that if the Western controls work as intended, “Chinese AI developers will remain boxed out of that supply chain, working with less powerful chips, and thus a year or two behind the cutting edge as AI continues its rapid advance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These controls can be effective in delaying China’s progress in AI. According to numerous industry experts, “Even as the country [China] races to build generative A.I., Chinese companies are relying almost entirely on underlying systems from the United States,” and China lags behind the United States by a year and may be falling further behind in generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China faces obstacles in developing large language models, such as the relatively lower quality of data from Mandarin-language internet sources versus English and strong competition from Google’s Gemini and ChatGPT, but is apparently finding workarounds. In March 2024, the Department of Justice indicted a Chinese national and former Google AI software developer for allegedly stealing 500 files of confidential code that the company uses for its supercomputing data centers to train large language models. The indictment alleged that the researcher concurrently went to work for Google rivals in China. Indeed, a hidden Chinese competitive advantage in AI and other high-tech sectors is its large-scale state-supported theft of Western intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-information-science&quot;&gt;Quantum Information Science&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum information science (QIS) employs principles derived from quantum science to achieve new and potentially revolutionary capabilities in communications, computing, sensing, and encryption/decryption. Quantum information technology has rapidly moved from pioneering theoretical work by U.S. scientists to the emergence and pursuit of practical applications in the United States, China, and Europe. Many of these applications will have major impacts on national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, quantum computers may soon be able to decrypt information stored on encrypted systems, which, according to a 2022 Biden administration National Security Memorandum, could “jeopardize civilian and military communications systems, undermine supervisory and control systems for critical infrastructure, and defeat security protocols for most Internet-based financial transactions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other uses, application of quantum concepts to sensors could enable the detection of concealed underground structures, submarines, and nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum-based communications systems could ensure secure communications that could not be breached by adversaries. And quantum accelerometers could be used for navigation when GPS is not available, including underwater and underground situations and scenarios in which GPS has been knocked out by adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE U.S. NATIONAL QUANTUM INITIATIVE ACT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a major positive step to address this challenge, the National Quantum Initiative Act (NQIA) of 2018 established a coordinated federal program to promote quantum R&amp;amp;D to ensure U.S. economic and national security. The act authorized federal agencies to establish consortia and research centers to enable QIS R&amp;amp;D and required the coordination of QIS programs across the federal government and in conjunction with academia and industry. The NQIA was authorized for five years and is up for reauthorization in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reauthorization of the act is crucial. As a principal analyst at UK-based data analytics firm GlobalData observed, “If reauthorization fails, it will damage the U.S.’s position in the global quantum race.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant QIS developmental efforts are ongoing at over a dozen federal agencies including NIST, DOD, DOE, NASA, and within the intelligence community. DOD’s QIS developmental efforts have been under way for years and are implemented pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act. Since 2023, DARPA has been pursuing Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) to determine whether revolutionary approaches to QIS can reach utility scale more rapidly than conventional wisdom predicts. There are multiple paths to pursue. These opportunities were recognized in the increased spending authorized in the science portion of the CHIPS Act for quantum research at NSF, NIST, and DOE, but as noted above, the necessary funds have not been appropriated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A GROWING COMPETITIVE THREAT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the United States and China stand in comparative terms in QIS is subjective and difficult to assess, particularly given that the research efforts that are under way are frequently not transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2022 RAND Corporation study concluded that the United States led the world in most, but not all, quantum technologies. In 2022, GlobalData concluded that the United States led China in quantum technology by about five years, but two years later, in 2024, the same firm concluded that the two countries were “nearly equal.” Underscoring this assessment, in May 2024, research teams in China, the United States, and the Netherlands independently reported simultaneous breakthroughs that could eventually enable the creation of “nearly unhackable” quantum-based internet services. The 2023 Australian ASPI survey of critical technologies found that of four quantum-related research domains, China led in three: quantum sensors, quantum communications, and post-quantum technologies. The United States leads in one defense-related field, quantum computing. In the three fields led by China, that country is producing more S&amp;amp;E papers and has the foremost research organizations in the world, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Science and Technology of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a 2023 study by the Wilson Center, “opacity reigns in China’s public and private financing for quantum technologies.” The same can be said, to a degree, about U.S. outlays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government has committed to spend $15 billion in developing QIS between 2024 and 2028, but the extent to which it will actually do so has been questioned. In the United States, the government has reportedly committed $3 billion to various quantum projects, another $1.2 billion to the National Quantum Initiative, and possibly additional outlays in the DOD’s mostly classified “black budget.” Although U.S. public outlays are smaller than China’s, as a recent CSIS study observes, “The United States has begun to mitigate its investment gap with China by teaming up with key allies leading global QIS innovation on research and development efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS, YET VULNERABILITIES REMAIN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent anecdotal reports out of China underscore both its achievements in quantum technology and some of its vulnerabilities. In October 2023, Chinese scientists announced that the country’s latest quantum computer, the JiuZhang 3, had solved a highly complex mathematical problem in a millionth of a second, more than 20 billion years faster than the world’s fastest supercomputer could solve the same problem. In January 2024, a Chinese quantum computer company, Origin Quantum — founded by scientists from the University of Science and Technology of China — unveiled a “China independent-developed state-of-the-art quantum computer” dubbed Origin Wukong (Monkey King) which was open for access by users around the world. Within 10 days, the computer had performed 33,871 quantum computing tasks for global users. “No other nation funds more R&amp;amp;D for [quantum] communications than China,” the Wilson Center study noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese research institutes are reportedly creating a quantum communications network using satellites in low and medium-to-high Earth orbits. The network would utilize quantum technology for encryption and secure transmission of data and communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, Guo Guoping — a quantum physicist, cofounder of Origin Quantum, and leading figure in China’s quantum promotional effort — warned that China was dependent on Western countries, mainly the United States, the Netherlands, and Finland, for dilution refrigerators, which are used to create the ultra-low temperatures required by quantum computing. Guo also noted that China lagged behind the West in industrial applications of quantum computing, citing high costs and inadequate market demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;semiconductors&quot;&gt;Semiconductors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All major U.S. defense platforms, domestic infrastructures, and technology-intensive products and industries are based on semiconductor chips, the basic building blocks of digital technology. AI systems, for example, “operate on a foundation of interconnected computer hardware driven by cutting-edge semiconductor devices.” The U.S. semiconductor design industry leads the world, representing a crucial U.S. asset in the strategic competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CHIPS Act of 2022 was intended to address twin U.S. vulnerabilities in the chip manufacturing sector that were revealed by the Covid-19 pandemic — most notably the shortfall of U.S. production capacity needed to supply the needs of domestic industry and the U.S. military, and the fact that U.S. chipmakers trail Taiwan and South Korea in their ability to make chips at the most advanced nodes. At present, the United States is dependent upon chipmaking facilities in Taiwan, which makes 90 percent of the most advanced chips, and South Korea for these devices. Taiwan, of course, faces significant levels of geopolitical risk but also seismological ones: the island suffered several earthquakes in April 2024 alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a necessary ramp up, CHIPS Act funds are now being awarded to firms to expand both leading-edge and foundational semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the United States. Moreover, the U.S. government, in conjunction with key allies, is enforcing new and more stringent controls on exports of chips and chip manufacturing technology to China, especially on tools and devices necessary to support advances in AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has responded by redoubling its commitment to developing its own semiconductor technology through domestic innovation. At the end of 2022, the Chinese government was reportedly planning to spend 1 trillion yuan ($143 billion) over the next five years to support its semiconductor industry, more than the United States and the European Union combined. In 2014, China established the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (the “Big Fund”) to support investments in the domestic semiconductor industry, comprised of government, quasi-public, and private funds. By 2019, the Big Fund had raised 204 billion yuan (28 billion USD). In May 2024, China launched a new phase of this effort with a registered capital of $47.5 billion to support investments in China’s semiconductor value chain, including production capacity, equipment, materials, and advanced packaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is rapidly expanding its production capacity for higher node chips, sometimes called “foundational” semiconductors. These chips account for most current applications worldwide — and Chinese firms may come to dominate that market segment to the detriment of U.S.-based chipmakers, including those currently investing in new facilities with support from the CHIPS Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment, the U.S.-based semiconductor design industry leads all other countries, including China, by virtually any measure of international competitiveness. Advanced artificial intelligence chips designed by the U.S. fabless firm Nvidia account for over 80 percent of the market and “underpin all of the most advanced AI systems.” Nvidia reportedly holds a 92 percent global market share in data center graphics processing units (GPUs). But in June 2024, a Huawei executive stated that the company’s Ascend 910B AI chip can deliver 80 percent of the efficiency of an Nvidia A100 when training large language models, and, “in some other tests, the Ascend can beat the A100 by 20 percent.” The United States has a number of world-leading integrated device makers (IDMs) that design and manufacture their own chips, such as Intel Corporation and Texas Instruments. Intel is reportedly pursuing the astonishing goal of incorporating 1 trillion transistors on a single processor package by 2030, about 10 times the current number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, U.S.-based firms dominate crucial upstream chip design sectors such as electronic design automation (EDA) tools and IP blocks, which enable faster and less expensive chip designs. Loss of access to these enabling technologies as a result of Western export controls is proving disruptive to China’s AI sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts regard China’s prospects for achieving technological leadership in semiconductors through its own efforts as impossible, while others see it as inevitable. If a loss of leadership in semiconductor design did occur, it would be a strategic calamity of monumental proportions for the United States, with a more far-reaching impact than the offshore movement of chipmaking that has been unfolding since the 1990s. Once lost, such leadership would be difficult to recapture. And as the 2021 NSCAI report warned, “If a potential adversary bests the United States in semiconductors over the long term or suddenly cuts off U.S. access to cutting-edge chips entirely, it could gain the upper hand in every domain of warfare.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that reason, in addition to building out domestic chipmaking capacity, U.S. policymakers should be sensitive to the health and competitive standing relative to China of the domestic chip design industry, with an eye to preserving and even increasing U.S. leadership. The United States cannot be complacent about its current leadership. In that regard, in 2022 the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group warned that the U.S. chip design industry’s global market share has been eroding as design firms face challenges such as rising costs, labor shortages, and exclusion from important foreign markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is crucially important to understand that AI, QIS, and semiconductors are increasingly interrelated and mutually supporting fields. Over time, the advances in these domains may transform both national economic capabilities and the strategic balance. The interdependencies are powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI systems run on advanced chips, and AI software is increasingly being deployed to design those chips. Researchers are identifying composite materials that could integrate quantum devices into semiconductor technology, making chips “significantly more powerful.” Semiconductor technology is in turn being used to fabricate qubits, the basic building blocks of quantum computers. AI systems based on quantum processing could “be millions of times faster than the fastest microchip computers today,” experts say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chips, AI, and QIS will therefore not only advance all twenty-first-century technology-intensive industries but also drive, enhance, and possibly disrupt each other. Chinese authorities understand this competition and are dedicating massive amounts of funding toward capturing the benefits of these transformative technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the stakes of this competition, it is jarring that in the space of just a few days in March 2024, the United States both failed to fund the science portion of the CHIPS Act and implemented budget cuts for key federal science agencies. Meanwhile, the Chinese government increased planned R&amp;amp;D spending by 10 percent. China has pledged to “harness the entire nation’s resources to speed homegrown breakthroughs, reaffirming what it sees as a central priority to become self-reliant in spheres from AI to chipmaking and ultimately wrest technological supremacy from the West,” experts say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sudip Parikh, chief executive of the nonprofit American Association for the Advancement of Science, warned that the race for leadership in key technologies like AI, quantum, and fusion would have long-term strategic implications: “Once you lose the lead in that kind of a race, the benefits accrue to whoever’s in the lead, and they’ve been accruing to us for the last 75 years. They will begin to accrue somewhere else.” U.S. policymakers need to recognize that danger and make the investments needed to secure the nation’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

It is facing an astute insurrectionist campaign. This continued resistance to occupation will play an important role in undermining the sustainability of the Russian war effort.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important rule: go unnoticed. You need to blend into the crowd. Dress inconspicuously; don’t swear; walk on the inside of the pavement; prepare an alibi; use public transport during rush hour; be punctual — if someone is two minutes late to meet you, they may have been captured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the basic code of conduct for Ukrainian underground fighters, as set out by the National Resistance Center of Ukraine — the Ukrainian government’s online resource to support the patriotic resistance under Russian occupation. This partisan movement comprises many thousands of Ukrainians and covers all manner of activities, from distributing yellow ribbons to assassinating Russian secret policemen. Their stories are as harrowing as they are heroic. For instance, in occupied Tokmak, Zaporizhzhia Region, Maksym Makhrinov’s final breath was an explosive statement of resistance. Confronted by Russian forces who had uncovered his partisan work for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Makhrinov blew himself up, taking two Russian soldiers with him. But what led Makhrinov to this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following report is an effort to provide indicative answers to this question. It is based on extensive fieldwork in Ukraine since 2022, largely in the de-occupied territories. It includes 63 interviews, 50 of which are with people who had been under occupation, 17 with individuals involved in violent or nonviolent resistance, and 7 with officials in the security services responsible for handling and helping ongoing resistance. As such, the report makes no claims to be representative; it does, however, also draw from a literature review of relevant sources, such as Ukrainian Telegram channels of resistance networks and offers of support; Ukrainian reports on this topic from organizations such as OPORA, Prometheus, Eastern Variant, Eastern Human Rights Group, and the National Resistance Center; and interviews with experts specializing in this field. For the purposes of safety and anonymization, the names of most interviewees have been changed and locations are kept deliberately vague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this report is to provide insights into the importance of the resistance, its impact on the sustainability of Russia’s war and occupation, the reality of conducting resistance, and the personal stories of some of those involved. Resistance here is defined as any act that deliberately challenges or impedes the Russian war aim as defined by Vladimir Putin: to destroy Ukrainian sovereignty and identity. Amid ongoing discussions of negotiations and dwindling resilience in the West to support Ukraine, the report will also provide information about the reality of Russia’s occupation and Ukrainians’ struggle against it. If Western policymakers intend to abandon Ukraine to its fate, they have a responsibility to acknowledge what that fate entails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if Western support for Ukraine does prove more resilient, this report provides recommendations and insights into how the resistance can support the Ukrainian war effort, as well as ways to aid the resistance — from boosting morale to providing material assistance. As the involvement of civilian efforts across the West to support Ukraine has been considerable, a number of recommendations are also aimed more generally at interested organizations and individuals who would like to support, morally or otherwise, the Ukrainian resistance against the Russian occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;occupied-territories&quot;&gt;Occupied Territories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Situation on the Ground&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To appropriately contextualize the impact, tenor, and ramifications of Ukrainian resistance against Russian occupation, a foundational understanding of the prevailing conditions is essential. Investigations into the situation within these territories highlight egregious human rights abuses perpetrated by the Russian Federation — the abduction of children, torture, extrajudicial killings, indoctrination, pervasive homelessness and poverty, and systematic resource extraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrently, the Russian Ministry of Defense has invested in building new military infrastructure in occupied regions. This militarization extends beyond the presence of military installations; it involves a comprehensive reorientation of local industries to support military logistics, the construction of essential supply networks, and educational reforms designed to instill a pro-military ethos among residents. This strategy aims to transform the occupied territories into a militarized zone, acting as a buffer and demarcation line that underscores the Russian government’s intentions toward the remaining unoccupied Ukrainian territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of civilian infrastructure in the occupied Ukrainian territories is conspicuously absent, as evidenced by the lack of reconstruction efforts in devastated cities such as Popasna, Volnovakha, Bakhmut, and Soledar. Forced mobilization of locals, exploitation of natural resources, and neglect of civil infrastructure development have precipitated a humanitarian crisis. In June 2023, the Russian government’s allocation of 2.9 billion rubles — significantly less than the planned 3.7 billion rubles — for industrial development in these territories reflects Russia’s reduced commitment to reviving local industries, further exacerbating the unsustainable nature of its occupation model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Socially, interviewees report that the occupation has fractured community bonds, increased substance abuse, and fueled desires for vengeance against collaborators and Russian forces. The emergence of new social hierarchies, such as the privileged status of (some) collaborators and the disintegration of prewar moral and social orders, poses significant threats to the long-term cohesion of these communities. The demographic situation is critical. In the temporarily occupied parts of Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts, the healthcare system has deteriorated significantly due to the departure of medical professionals; occupation administration statistics indicate that 1 in every 81 newborns dies. From 2018 to 2022, the birth rate in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic decreased by 46.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian occupiers have exacerbated the current demographic decline through policies that include the shutdown of industrial enterprises and the degradation of healthcare services. In many places, the lack of workers has rendered it impossible to sustain essential services, such as water supply and infrastructure repair; this has prompted directives from the Kremlin to recruit Russian citizens and migrant workers to populate the occupied regions, an approach that is also part of a broader movement of settler colonialism and ethnic cleansing in the occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategies deployed in the occupied territories demonstrate a profound disregard for the wellbeing of the local population, particularly Ukrainians. This includes the conscription of locals into so-called forward detachments, effectively using them as human shields. Those captured are subsequently abandoned and relegated to second-class status — as demonstrated by a recent video appeal to Putin from POWs from the Donetsk and Luhansk Republics (DNR/LNR) who are upset they are being excluded from prisoner swaps, with only “proper” Russians being exchanged. Aside from a few lucky collaborators, the only individuals leading normal lives in the occupied territories are Russian nationals who have relocated to these “new territories.” Interviewees comprising former and current residents of the occupied territories report that any semblance of normality is largely a facade, masking ongoing human rights abuses such as disappearances and torture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The selective imposition of normality has led to a system that resembles apartheid between Russian and Ukrainian citizens, heavily enforced by the mandatory acquisition of Russian passports. The enforcement of Russian passport acquisition renders daily life and access to essential services contingent upon compliance with the occupiers’ demands, serving as an indirect punishment for those resisting the imposition of a Russian identity. For instance, emergency services and property transactions are inaccessible without a Russian passport; an interviewed individual recounted an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim her property near Donetsk due to her refusal to accept a Russian passport. Workers’ wages may also be withheld if they refuse to take a passport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The selective imposition of normality has led to a system that resembles apartheid between Russian and Ukrainian citizens, heavily enforced by the mandatory acquisition of Russian passports.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Russia’s strategy has extended to the systemic restructuring of local governance; as a rule, only Russian citizens who have not previously worked in Ukraine are appointed to senior law enforcement positions within the occupied territories. This policy underscores the Kremlin’s intent to sever any preexisting local ties to Ukrainian governance and assert control, albeit at arms’ length. The Ukrainian Cyber Resistance recently acquired the messages of the deputy director of the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service, in which it was revealed that he refuses to communicate directly with subordinates in the occupied territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions. Instead, he orders the heads of the department in the Rostov region and Crimea to work as intermediaries, underscoring a hierarchical enforcement structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these measures, the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation permitted residents of the occupied territories to vote in 2023 using any form of identification, including Ukrainian passports. This policy was part of a broader strategy to compile comprehensive voter lists, indirectly serving as a population census, with data subsequently integrated into Russian federal systems. The demographic shifts in these regions are stark; in Melitopol alone, the population halved post-invasion — somewhat offset by the nearly 100,000 Russian nationals relocating to the city, further illustrating a deliberate strategy of ethnic cleansing and demographic manipulation by Russian authorities. Such strategies are coupled with severe restrictions on communication and mobility, particularly in areas near the front line, contributing to a climate of intense surveillance and suppression of dissent. This oppressive environment has eroded community bonds and trust, with residents living under constant fear of betrayal or coercion, reminiscent of Soviet-era tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rigorous system for monitoring and quelling dissent has been progressively intensified. Measures include eavesdropping on communications, the widespread installation of surveillance cameras, and the establishment of an informant network within communities. Access to external information sources is significantly constrained in the temporarily occupied territories, particularly in areas close to the front line, such as Lysychansk, Sievierodonetsk, Rubizhne, and Kreminna. These cities experience substantial disruptions in internet and mobile communication services, which are restricted by occupation authorities due to concerns that local residents might transmit sensitive information to the Ukrainian Armed Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere of control extends to acts of intimidation and harassment, which the occupying forces perpetrate with apparent impunity. For instance, social media platforms like Telegram reveal frequent discussions among residents of occupied Mariupol and Luhansk about vehicular accidents caused by inebriated or reckless Russian soldiers. A particularly distressing incident occurred in Luhansk, where a Russian tank ran over a woman at a pedestrian crossing in broad daylight, eliciting no public reaction — a stark indicator of the societal desensitization that has occurred under prolonged Russian occupation. Such everyday harassment is particularly targeted at young and attractive women: as one interviewee noted, “All of the girls stopped taking care of themselves, the women go around in ugly clothes, it didn’t used to be like that, women had their hair, their nails (done).” When asked whether this was due to the economic situation, the interlocutor explained that it was in order to not draw the attention of occupiers, “especially the Chechens.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been numerous reported cases of Russian forces, including but far from limited to Chechens, sexually assaulting and raping women. A veteran soldier, actively involved in the de-occupied territories, recounted harrowing accounts of elderly women in villages who had suffered sexual assault. He told stories of wives being raped before their husbands, who were then killed after being forced to witness the crime, and of young attractive women being kidnapped as sex slaves for senior Russian officers. During interviews with villagers who had lived under occupation in the Kharkiv region, the majority of the worst cases, including the gang rape of an elderly woman in a village not far from the border with Donetsk region, happened during the initial invasion. However, rape and sexual violence — primarily toward women but also toward men in Russian custody — are a systematic part of the occupation and of the general feeling of impunity that the occupying soldiers enjoy or, as this report will show, presume they can enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ukrainian-resistance-at-a-glance&quot;&gt;The Ukrainian Resistance at a Glance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the escalating atrocities associated with Russia’s unpredictable and intensifying occupation, it is understandable that a considerable number of individuals might be compelled to resist, despite the profound risks associated with such actions. The context of the occupation — marked by its brutality and the existential threat it poses to Ukrainian identity and autonomy — naturally fosters various forms of resistance. Four distinct types of resistance emerge through research:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Resistance:&lt;/strong&gt; This form involves actions that are personal and confined to a close circle of trusted individuals. Examples include reading Ukrainian literature, speaking Ukrainian within the household, sending children to the neighbors so they are seen to be leaving home for school but do not actually attend school, and refusing to take a Russian passport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Nonlethal Resistance:&lt;/strong&gt; These activities are overt but nonviolent, aimed at bolstering community morale and asserting Ukrainian presence. They include posting flyers, displaying Ukrainian symbols in public spaces, participating in memorial acts like placing candles in windows to commemorate the Holodomor, and engaging in symbolic resistance such as the Yellow Ribbon and Zla Mavka movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Lethal Resistance:&lt;/strong&gt; This category involves direct contributions to military efforts, such as transmitting coordinates of Russian forces to Ukrainian Special Operations Forces and monitoring the movements of Russian soldiers to facilitate targeted actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Lethal Resistance:&lt;/strong&gt; The most overt and dangerous form, this type of resistance includes acts such as assassinating Russian occupation personnel and their collaborators and sabotaging occupation infrastructure, as seen in operations by groups like ATESH and SROK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary focus of this paper will be on the lethal forms of resistance. These actions, though less frequently discussed and more challenging to document, play a critical role in the broader resistance movement. However, the study will also address nonlethal resistance, highlighting its significance in sustaining public spirit, fostering a sense of community, and boosting the morale of those engaged in direct combat, as well as the Ukrainian Armed Forces committed to liberating their territory. This analysis aims to understand the diverse profiles of individuals who participate in both lethal and nonlethal resistance, exploring their motivations, the risks they face, and the impact of their actions on the occupation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEMOGRAPHICS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resistance movement in Ukraine’s occupied territories comprises a diverse demographic, although it predominantly involves younger participants. This younger cohort’s engagement is often attributed to a combination of factors: greater physical capability, a sense of invincibility, and, importantly, a stronger national identity coupled with less nostalgia for the Soviet Union era, as indicated by opinion polls. While men are more commonly engaged in active violent resistance, women play substantial roles in both nonviolent and violent actions. For instance, in the Zla Mavka group based in Melitopol, over a hundred women participate in direct actions, though the network extends far beyond this number. The movement has seen significant growth, particularly during the winter months when new members from Luhansk and Donetsk began to emerge, despite previous isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable aspect of the resistance is the participation from Crimea, an area previously thought to be subdued after years of occupation. Reports indicate that a large number of women from Crimea have joined the resistance, demonstrating a readiness to oppose the occupation robustly. Women have also been instrumental in more covert forms of resistance — such as poisoning the food and drink offered to Russian soldiers, exploiting the occupiers’ presumptions of local hospitality. In an interview with the author, one ATESH commander explained the varied makeup of their resistance movement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of people and everyone is different but I will try to generalize as objectively as possible. We have men and women among our agents. Most of them are under 40. The majority of them are married but far from all of them have children. There are very few people in our movement who originally sympathized with Russia. Those few who did change their minds are not involved in sabotage operations but they do help with all sorts of information. On the other hand, we have a different situation with agents located in the Russian Federation. February 2022 changed the worldview of a lot of people. Such a large-scale war and the Putin regime’s crimes forced Russians to cooperate with the ATESH movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The socioeconomic profile of the resistance is primarily composed of middle and lower-class individuals. Many of the wealthiest Ukrainians fled the country early in the full-scale invasion, having the resources to do so. In contrast, those from less affluent backgrounds — including some of the most marginalized groups, such as prisoners — have contributed significantly to the resistance efforts. For example, detainees in the Kherson pretrial detention center managed to transmit coordinates of enemy missiles and machinery using a covertly held phone, enabling precise Ukrainian Armed Forces strikes on Russian command centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A notable aspect of the resistance is the participation from Crimea, an area previously thought to be subdued after years of occupation. Reports indicate that a large number of women from Crimea have joined the resistance, demonstrating a readiness to oppose the occupation robustly.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demographic diversity within the resistance highlights a widespread national commitment across different strata of society, challenging the occupation through various forms of resistance that leverage the unique capabilities and circumstances of its members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LANGUAGE, LOCATION, AND CULTURAL IDENTITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many resistance movements operate in Russian-speaking areas but conduct their activities in Ukrainian, as there is a lower likelihood of occupiers understanding the language. The use of the Ukrainian language in resistance activities, especially those involving information dissemination and education, also serves as a tool of cultural resistance and identity affirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting, however, that despite language differences, there is no significant division between Russian-speaking and Ukrainian-speaking individuals in terms of their opposition to the occupiers. Linguistic preference does not correlate with political allegiance; just as speaking English does not imply that an Irishman supports British reinvasion, speaking Russian does not mean a Ukrainian desires Russian occupation. In Kharkiv, for example, predominantly Russian-speaking defenders initially confronted the Russian “liberators” with significant resistance. Notably, the Azov Assault Brigade and the Kraken Special Division, units particularly reviled by the Kremlin, consist overwhelmingly of Russian speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the assumption that residents in territories that were occupied following the 2014 invasion are less resistant than those in other cities does not always hold. For instance, Alchevsk in the Luhansk region, occupied by Russian forces in 2014, has experienced persistent hardships under occupation — including frequent water shortages, unstable mobile communications, and inadequate postal services — all of which have contributed to profound anger with the occupation. In an interview with the Eastern Variant network, a local Ukrainian partisan from Alchevsk conveyed the communal exhaustion with the ongoing deprivation and highlighted significant local resistance actions, such as the sabotage of enemy locations and ammunition depots:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of course, the main problem in Alchevsk is water supply. It often happens that one of the areas does not have water for four to five days. Discussions arise almost weekly: either a water pipe has burst, the sewage smells across the street, or there has been no water for four days. Besides, the city often has very poor connectivity. Mobile internet was only allowed after the new year. . . . Even local Russian patriots realize that the occupiers have taken 10 years of their lives while not doing anything significant or centralized. Has life gotten better? Not at all. People have lost time, and that’s the most important thing. The occupiers closely monitor Alchevsk. Russians do not trust the local authorities entirely and always keep them under control, placing people from Russia. There are still people with a pro-Ukrainian stance in the city, especially noticeable in 2022 when almost all enemy locations and ammunition depots in Alchevsk were blown up, thanks to local partisans. Alchevsk is Ukraine. Alchevsk is waiting to return home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occupational challenges have persisted in parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions since 2014, with the situation worsening after the full-scale invasion in 2022. From the very start, there has been forced mobilization, and local LNR and DNR forces receive inferior treatment compared to Russian soldiers. Further, the dissatisfaction among the collaborator ruling class with the Kremlin’s personnel policies has led to instances of noncompliance and outright sabotage, as evidenced in Horlivka, where new mobilization rounds were refused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author’s interviews with those living or having lived under LNR and DNR occupation often revealed conflicts between local “People’s Militia” units and Russian forces, driven by deep-seated differences. The cancellation of LPR and DPR passports, replaced with Russian passports, restricted residents’ ability to cross into Ukrainian-controlled territory, exacerbating tensions. Furthermore, the continuous arrests and detentions of pro-Ukrainian locals have intensified animosity toward Russian law enforcement representatives among the detainees’ families. To consolidate control, the Kremlin has significantly strengthened its law enforcement presence in the occupied territories, establishing an extensive network of Russian military and security forces, especially the National Guard and FSB (Russia’s domestic intelligence agency) counterintelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MOTIVATIONS AND BACKGROUND&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From interviews with past and current members of the resistance, as well as potential recruits, it is evident that these individuals are characterized by resourcefulness, courage, and resilience. Often creative and slightly anarchic, they tend not to adhere strictly to directives, even when associated with intelligence agencies. The challenging circumstances of ongoing resistance have further honed their ingenuity, compelling them to become highly adaptive and continuously develop new tactics to persist in their activities under intense surveillance and oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resistance members who engaged with the author expressed a spectrum of political beliefs, ranging from left-wing to right-wing ideologies. However, a common thread among them was a robust commitment to sovereignty and freedom, which they interpreted in practical rather than abstract terms. Motivated by a sense of basic human dignity, they articulated sentiments such as: “I refuse to live like a serf in my own home[town/land]” and “This is my country; why should I just hand it over to [Russians]?” In this context, concepts like sovereignty and freedom are understood literally — as the right not to be dragged into a basement and tortured, or the right to not have someone take your apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motivations of resistance members vary, often depending on the nature of their involvement. Those engaged in violent acts of resistance, such as sabotage and assassination, are typically the most patriotic and ideologically driven. These individuals often chose to stay behind in occupied areas to fight. For instance, one Ukrainian serviceman interviewed for this report shared how he was instructed in late 2021 to remain and coordinate resistance activities in the event of occupation. He and his colleagues replicated training schools for resistance under occupation, drawing on both local knowledge and external support — sometimes from Western intelligence agencies, though the applicability of the latter’s methods received mixed reviews from interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these “anticipatory” resisters, who are often linked formally or informally with Ukrainian Military Intelligence (HUR), their motivations are deeply entwined with a sense of historical destiny. Common sentiments among these fighters include a determination to end centuries-long struggles against Russian domination, referencing historical atrocities and genocides, such as the Holodomor, as well as Russian efforts to erase Ukrainian identity. These sentiments are prevalent across much of the Ukrainian resistance, with many viewing the conflict as a genocidal attempt to destroy the Ukrainian nation. The millennial generation, in particular, expresses frustration with their parents’ generation for not doing more to secure Ukraine’s defense post–Soviet Union. This historical perspective is also prominent in Ukrainian media coverage of the resistance, reinforcing the narrative of finality and self-defense: fighting now so future generations won’t have to. This is exemplified by initiatives like HUR’s Military TV Resistance Movement project launched on June 2, 2022, which featured a series of informational films to educate and motivate citizens to defend their lives and homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resistance includes many trained professionals, such as the types of operatives who planned to stay behind — the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces, military intelligence, and certain special divisions. For example, the Kraken special division has been known to operate in Russian-controlled territories with considerable success, although it also sometimes sees losses. However, there are also many in the resistance who were not initially prepared for such roles but found themselves compelled by circumstances. For instance, the Sumy volunteer group, or “SUD,” was composed largely of local volunteers and yet they played a critical role in defending their city when official military presence was scant. This group, which grew to about 900 people, was pivotal in organizing local defense and maintaining order during the initial stages of the invasion. People continue to join the resistance, largely operating in small cells with minimal connection to other members. As one ATESH fighter explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People get in touch with us by contacting one of the coordinators of our Telegram channel. Or via personal contacts. The coordination of agents is generally carried out over secure messaging apps or some other different channel, depending on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those who are not professionals or trained operatives, the motivations for joining the resistance are complex and varied. For some, it might be a response to direct impacts of the occupation, such as loss of property, restrictions on freedoms, or personal harm. The “sister regions” program implemented by Russia, which sees a Russian region invest in an occupied area and then receive rights to flood markets with local products, is one example that fueled resentment and resistance. By displacing local goods with more expensive Russian products, this program not only altered the economic landscape but also deepened the sense that this was an occupation purely in the interests of the occupiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sexual violence and other forms of abuse by Russian forces also serve as potent motivators for resistance. The horrific acts committed against both men and women have galvanized many to take up arms or support the resistance in any way they can. The fear and indignity experienced by victims and witnesses have in many cases been translated into a fierce determination to resist. This complex amalgam of historical grievances, personal experiences of injustice and abuse, and a profound commitment to national sovereignty and cultural preservation are fueling a resilient and adaptive movement determined to oppose Russian occupation and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This complex amalgam of historical grievances, personal experiences of injustice and abuse, and a profound commitment to national sovereignty and cultural preservation are fueling a resilient and adaptive movement determined to oppose Russian occupation and influence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;forms-of-resistance&quot;&gt;Forms of Resistance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In wars like Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty, the distinctions between soldiers, civilians, and resistance fighters often become indistinct, as a broad segment of the population engages in the struggle for national survival. As previously discussed, the separation between violent and nonviolent resistance is somewhat artificial, given that each type supports and sustains the other, creating a symbiotic relationship of mutual reliance. In the words of one ATESH commander, speaking to the author:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Non-violent resistance is incredibly important too. We also conduct forms of non-violent resistance, like agitational events in Russian and occupied Ukrainian cities. Our “ATESH civilian strength” activists put up our flyers across cities and this demonstrates our presence among the population. People feel a sense of support, that people who think like them are living next door. We also take revenge on drivers who support Russia’s criminal war. We destroy or paint over cars with ZOV symbols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that some members of the resistance consciously choose to avoid involvement in violent or lethal actions, driven either by personal convictions or a strategic desire to preserve their lives. To understand the full scope of the resistance, it is crucial to delineate and examine the specific acts that contribute to the broader resistance movement. Such an analysis not only highlights the varied nature of resistance activities but also helps in understanding the dynamic interplay between different forms of resistance and their collective impact on Ukraine’s struggle for autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nonviolent-resistance&quot;&gt;Nonviolent Resistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBLIC ACTS OF DEFIANCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include acts of civil disobedience, such as refusing to comply with the occupiers’ demands or participating in organized protests and demonstrations to challenge the authority and legitimacy of the occupying forces. For example, the Zla Mavka group based in Melitopol has created and distributed fake rubles with Ukrainian symbols and messages to remind the occupiers that they are in Ukraine, not Russia. This initiative represents a creative form of psychological resistance, using humor and art to assert Ukrainian identity and sovereignty. Another prominent example is the Yellow Ribbon movement, which involves Ukrainian citizens discreetly displaying yellow ribbons as a sign of solidarity and covert defiance against Russian forces. The choice of yellow, along with blue, represents the colors of the Ukrainian national flag, signaling a quiet yet powerful affirmation of national identity and opposition to the occupiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form of resistance is significant because it allows for broad participation from the public, including those who may not be able to engage in more direct or violent forms of resistance. By adopting such symbols, individuals communicate their support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and their resistance to the occupation in a manner that is relatively safe yet impactful. This method is particularly effective in fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose among the population, reinforcing the resilience of the community in the face of foreign aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INFORMATION AND CULTURAL INITIATIVES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter the occupiers’ narrative and propaganda, the resistance works hard to disseminate accurate information about the situation in the occupied territories. For instance, online bots like Resistance.Bot enable reporting on repairs to communication lines, allowing the Ukrainian underground to prevent occupiers from restricting internet access. For younger inhabitants of the occupied territories, the use of the internet and social media — especially Telegram — plays a crucial role in organizing, communicating, and raising awareness about the occupation, thus enabling the spread of information, mobilization of support, and coordination of activities without the need for direct confrontation. Telegram and increasingly Signal are also the way that violent resistance groups recruit new members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other efforts encompass activities by journalists, activists, and ordinary citizens aimed at documenting abuses, reporting on the actual conditions under occupation, and debunking falsehoods spread by the occupiers. This includes the production and distribution of materials, such as newspapers and leaflets, with pro-Ukrainian content to combat occupier narratives and bolster public morale. The production of physical products is especially important given that the occupation forces primarily target their propaganda at older demographics, for whom the main source of information is television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;YOUTH INDOCTRINATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engaging in cultural and educational activities that promote Ukrainian identity and resist Russian cultural assimilation represents another facet of nonviolent resistance. This may include organizing Ukrainian language classes, cultural events, and discussions that reinforce the community’s identity and resilience against efforts to suppress it. For this report, the author spoke to several university professors in free Ukraine who provide online classes to students of high school and university age who are located in the occupied territories. These classes are discreet, with students joining anonymously using false names and with their cameras off to ensure their safety. However, the students often join group classes and are reluctant to take up the offer of separate classes, away from their fellow students, as to them maintaining their connection to a broader Ukrainian community is a much-needed “form of psychological sustenance under the oppressive conditions of occupation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent BBC report highlighted a schoolteacher who left occupied Melitopol but continues to teach her former students who were left behind. In her case, she prioritizes psychological support and cultural education over traditional subjects, recognizing the significant emotional and psychological impact of the occupation on the children. In the occupied territories themselves, the author was told of numerous efforts to create safe spaces for Ukrainian education — from language to literature — for the children. Originally this was possible under the guise of religious or other forms of gatherings, but since the pseudo-referenda in autumn 2022, this has become much more difficult. The risks associated with these educational efforts are substantial, as any sign of dissent can lead to severe repercussions, including potential forced conscription of the students’ parents into the Russian military. However, these initiatives are critical in countering Russian propaganda and Russia’s extensive cultural and educational indoctrination efforts. By keeping children and older students connected to their Ukrainian roots and realities, these teachers and professors maintain a sense of identity and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE RESISTANCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other efforts involve resisting through legal and administrative means, such as refusing to recognize the legality of the occupiers’ authorities, not participating in their organized events or elections, and maintaining loyalty to the Ukrainian government. This type of resistance challenges the occupiers’ attempts to legitimize their control and governance over the occupied territories. Despite the efforts at forced passportization, a large number of Ukrainians have resisted, with the National Resistance Centre, using Russian state statistics, claiming that at least 60 percent of Ukrainians have refused passports and 80 percent have refused to put Russian license plates on their cars, as required by law. One interviewee from an area occupied since 2014 who is unable to leave due to caring responsibilities explained to the author: “I won’t take a Russian passport. [My friends in Ukraine] tell me I should, that it is safer but if I do, then who will be here to greet our boys when they liberate us? Where will all the Ukrainians be? I will greet [our boys] as a Ukrainian.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;violent-resistance&quot;&gt;Violent Resistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Types of violent resistance in the occupied territories include direct attacks and sabotage operations against Russian forces and infrastructure, as well as coordinated efforts with Ukrainian Armed Forces for targeted assaults on enemy positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RECONNAISSANCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to educating the public on the situation, countering misinformation, and maintaining morale among the Ukrainian population, various digital platforms have been crucial for coordinating immediate resistance activities. For example, during the occupation of the Kharkiv region, local civilian defense forces, in cooperation with intelligence agencies, established a Signal chat across the region that allowed them to track the movements of the occupiers, often via hastily taken photos from the windows of basements in occupied villages. The chat was set up within the first day of the invasion. This was thanks to the Ukrainian history of self-organization and a certain level of social trust, as well as preparation. The mayor of Derhachi spoke to the author of his own involvement in clandestine networks that enabled the liberation of his home village, Ruska Lozova, strategically placed on the Kharkiv-Belgorod highway. The mayor’s broad network of friends and family provided information on the movements of Russians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one occasion, the sharing of encrypted information over social networks and chats led to civilians informing the armed forces that a nearby factory had been taken by the Russians and was being used by them to store military equipment and tanks. Once this information had been verified, the choice was taken by intelligence forces to destroy this site. As the Russians were holding Ukrainian civilians as human shields, this was an especially fraught choice for those involved; however, the risk to the general population of Ukraine’s second-largest city meant that it was a choice the intelligence operative involved felt he had to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer the occupation continued, however, the less useful such chats became. For example, by August the Kharkiv region chat was largely dead, as the risks became too high with the enhanced occupation regime. Thankfully for the residents of the Kharkiv region, their liberation came soon after. However, the challenges of disseminating information have not halted resistance efforts. Resistance groups such as ATESH continue to provide intelligence on air defenses, depots, military bases, and soldiers’ movements. Journalists have also played a crucial role; for instance, journalists from the online news source Eastern Variant established a hotline for residents of occupied and frontline territories. This provided a secure channel for information sharing, seeking assistance, and accessing a network of specialists. Eastern Variant also launched an online school of civic journalism to teach non-journalists how to safely transmit information, expanding the impact of grassroots information efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support is not unidirectional; for instance, the “In the Eyes of Partisans” fundraiser, initiated by the Center for National Resistance in 2023, helped purchase drones used to adjust attacks on Russian forces. The resistance’s logistical challenges include acquiring and distributing inexpensive but effective smartphones for communication and coordination, with many such efforts described as grassroots initiatives relying on a network of trusted contacts. There are numerous organizations to support the resistance and general horizontal networking that assists, for example, in getting telephones to the occupied territories. Partisan operations burn through a lot of phones (each phone has to be destroyed after being used to send coordinates). The phones used tend to be inexpensive ($100) but still need to have basic smartphone functions. Two individuals involved in this process described their sourcing as a grassroots effort, asking trusted friends to help; they said the hardest element was the transient nature of support, which poses strategic challenges for resistance operations, highlighting the need for continuous, reliable assistance to the occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SABOTAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been a significant number of sabotage activities in the occupied territories, many of them psychological as well as physical. For instance, in Melitopol, the resistance movement SROK has engaged in marking the residences of Russian occupiers in the city. Specifically, apartments that Russian military and police personnel have commandeered are marked with “200,” a reference to Cargo 200, the Russian military slang term for dead soldiers. This marking tactic is intended to disrupt the occupiers’ sense of security and destabilize their operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resistance also targets key infrastructure to disrupt Russian logistical and administrative control in the occupied territories. Notably, the railway system in these regions has been declared autonomous and named the “Railways of Novorossiya,” ostensibly to evade international sanctions aimed at Russian Railways. This entity is not integrated into the broader Russian railway network and is overseen by the Federal Agency for Railway Transport (Roszheldor). Strategic efforts by Ukrainian partisans have focused on sabotaging these rail lines, which are critical for transporting military supplies and looted goods, such as grain and metal, from Crimea to mainland Ukraine. On October 13, 2023, and again on December 15, Melitopol partisans successfully detonated devices on trains that were transporting ammunition, fuel, and stolen resources between Crimea and Dniprorudne. These acts resulted in substantial damage to the railway infrastructure and severely disrupted Russian logistical operations. Following these incidents, Russian forces and administrative personnel intensified security measures and launched extensive searches for the partisans, who have, in this case, evaded capture and remained active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DIRECT ACTION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the initial full-scale invasion, in many soon-to-be-occupied cities, territorial defense units swiftly transitioned into partisans operating behind enemy lines. An example of this proactive resistance occurred at the battles for the Antonivskyi Bridge near Kherson, where partisans impeded the occupiers’ movements by barricading roads with concrete blocks and trees. Under intense conditions — lacking ammunition and close mortar fire — the partisan leader orchestrated a strategic retreat, ensuring the safety of his unit. Russian forces possessed comprehensive lists of all members of the territorial defense, including personal details such as names and addresses, meaning they had to flee once they could. In an interview with the author, one soldier who fought in the territorial defense of Melitopol recounted his harrowing experience of escaping surrounded cities, navigating through potentially mined fields, leaving behind injured comrades, and enduring severe frostbite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a published story on Kherson, another soldier remembers disguising himself as a homeless person to avoid suspicion. Many of the soldier’s comrades stayed behind until the last minute in order to coordinate with commanders to identify and transmit the locations of enemy equipment and personnel. This intelligence gathering was crucial for directing accurate strikes against Russian military assets, but in many cases cost the soldiers their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the cases above, there is often a combination of reconnaissance and direct action. For example, while the ATESH movement mainly appears to provide logistical information, partisan activists also claim to have carried out violent attacks, including killing 30 Russian soldiers in a military hospital and setting off a car-bomb attack in Russian-occupied Kherson. In another blurring of roles, there are also crossovers into occupied territory by Ukrainian special divisions. The Bratstvo Ukrainian special division, for example, has conducted operations in Crimea, while others work in different parts of the occupied territories or provide support. For example, Kraken has provided support to Russian units fighting on the side of the Ukrainian Armed Forces — like Legion Svobody, the RDK, and Vostok battalion — in raids into Russia, as well as to Ichkerian units; these units fight on the side of the Ukrainian Armed Forces “for the liberation of their countries from Vladimir Putin’s regime,” in the words of Legion Svobody’s leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are also raids into occupied Ukrainian territory, much of which remain secret and classified but a few of which have been made public. One HUR special unit conducted a night raid in the area of Nova Kakhovka on January 23, 2023. The raid was possible thanks to cooperation with local partisans and satellite imagery that identified the exact location of the Russian forward command post, which the reconnaissance forces destroyed with grenade launcher fire. The raid also gave the Ukrainian special forces comprehensive data on the number, composition, and locations of enemy reserves. While the so-called Surovikin line of reinforced defensive lines has made such raids very difficult now, they were very common during the initial months of the invasion; for example, in the village of Shestakove, there was a crossing point where people could come and go between the occupied territories and the gray zone, then pass through into the free territories (e.g., Chuhuiv). This was a space, albeit a very dangerous one, for saboteurs to cross into the occupied territories and collect information from villagers or set traps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most astonishing of all actions are those direct attacks that involve self-sacrifice — as in the example of Maksym Makhrinov, mentioned at the beginning of this report, who blew himself up and took two Russian soldiers with him. In a similar vein, in December 2023, members of a Ukrainian partisan group called the Crimean Combat Seagulls poisoned and killed 24 Russian soldiers after lacing their vodka with arsenic and strychnine, despite knowing that there was a high risk they would be caught, tortured, and even executed. Similarly, there have been reports from Bakhchysarai, Crimea, of Ukrainian partisans killing Russian soldiers by lacing pies and alcohol with arsenic and rat poison. There have also been reports and claims of mass poisonings of Russian troops elsewhere, from Melitopol to Mariupol. Often, attractive young women are involved in these types of actions, and, in the words of one Ukrainian intelligence operative interviewed by the author: “They are very brave but they don’t live very long afterwards. They disappear into the basements, or if they are lucky some general takes them for a bit [for forced sex].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the cases above, partisans’ direct action is overwhelmingly targeted at Russian military or security forces. The author’s own monitoring of Russian and Ukrainian Telegram channels covering the occupied territories identified over 73 reported deaths of Russian soldiers, police officers, and occupation officials at the hands of partisan movements between December 2023 and January 2024 alone. The true number is likely much higher. Moreover, this figure does not include the vastly more numerous deaths of Russian occupying forces from targeted strikes carried out on the basis of intelligence provided by the underground resistance. For example, in February 2024, a Ukrainian strike on a bakery in the occupied eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk killed three Russian occupation officials; in April, Ukraine used Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied by Britain to target the Luhansk military command base for the Russian army — a severe blow to Russia’s efforts to take more of the region, given the micromanagement of the armed operations there, and something that would not have been possible without the involvement of partisans on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Russian occupiers, the resistance also targets those collaborators who actively implement and facilitate the occupation. For example, on April 1, 2024, partisans likely assassinated Valeriy Chaika, who went over to the enemy in 2022 and took on the position of deputy head of the “Center for the Maintenance of Educational Organizations,” in which role he implemented Russia’s indoctrination system for Ukrainian children. On February 10, 2024, partisans appear to have assassinated Oleksandr Hallii in Berdyansk. Before the full-scale war, Hallii was involved in waste processing and selling tobacco products, but afterwards he helped the Russians to expropriate the homes and businesses of Ukrainian residents. Hallii fits a rather typical portrait of collaborators in the occupied territories — but Ukrainian partisans have more egregious traitors in their sights, as with the assassination of Ilya Kiva, a former Ukrainian MP and Russian agent, in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Implications and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-risk-of-being-caught&quot;&gt;The Risk of Being Caught&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone knew that the police station had become the torture chamber, they wanted you to know. I would cross the street not to walk too close to it.” The performative terror so characteristic of the Putin regime in Russia has acquired an even grislier turn in the occupied territories, as reflected in the words of this former resident of the occupied territories. Across all Russian-occupied towns and cities in Ukraine, torture chambers run by the FSB function in plain sight, as a demonstrative form of intimidation. There are legion reports of sexualized torture (e.g., electric shocks attached to genitalia), the removal of fingernails, rape, and mutilation. Any Ukrainian caught helping the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces or undertaking violent resistance is unlikely to live for very long — although, given the conditions in the torture chambers, they may not want to live for very long. There are detailed lists of torture chambers across the occupied territories, the happenings in which deserve far greater media attention but are sadly predictable; they were described in detail in Stanislav Aseyev’s recounting of his time in a DNR torture camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The performative terror so characteristic of the Putin regime in Russia has acquired an even grislier turn in the occupied territories, as reflected in the words of this former resident. Across all Russian-occupied towns and cities in Ukraine, torture chambers function in plain sight, as a demonstrative form of intimidation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of resistance activities, the occupying forces frequently deploy disinformation campaigns to distract from their inability to prevent such actions. Often, they attempt to link resistance efforts to Western influences, as seen in fabricated news claiming that the “British Council” was attempting to recruit residents on the western bank of Kherson. According to Russian allegations, British intelligence was using cultural engagements as a cover for espionage activities, collecting data on Russian military deployments and occupier equipment. These accusations escalated following a series of successful strikes by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the region, leading to propaganda that painted all cultural exchanges as intelligence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian efforts to dismantle the resistance also include crudely executed schemes aimed at ensnaring partisans. For instance, a Telegram channel named “Volya” threatened to destroy schools in Mariupol, purporting to represent an anarcho-Ukrainian underground movement. This was a calculated provocation designed to identify active and potential members of the resistance, framing them as criminals and miscreants within the Russian-controlled narrative. Speaking to the author, one ATESH commander explained how the FSB try to infiltrate their network:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Russians constantly try to penetrate our network. The FSB are especially interested in us. We maintain our security by verifying potential agents and putting them through a screening process. We give them a number of tasks to complete and then once the potential agent has completed the tasks we give them something a bit trickier. From the results of the tasks we can evaluate their work and their trustworthiness, which trained people help us to do. We can also evaluate how the agent communicates, whether they are suspicious. Normally FSB agents who want to infiltrate us try to find out about our locations, how exactly our network works, and they try to get into physical contact with representatives of the ATESH movement. This system helps us to screen [them] out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some areas are experiencing a spate of resistance activity, such as Luhansk, where the resistance is trying to pick up the slack from exhausted forces in the 31st Brigade attempting to resist Russia’s efforts to “fulfill its strategic aims of reaching the administrative borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.” In the words of the commander of the 31st Brigade, responsible for this area, his troops “will keep on fighting, they have no other choice but they are tired of course and the lack of support can be felt on the ground and in their heads.” As the resistance try to help as they can, the occupiers have sought to significantly limit their internet access in order to limit communication between partisans and the Ukrainian Armed Forces, such as by installing wired internet which can only be accessed after identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-importance-of-resistance&quot;&gt;The Importance of Resistance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On D-Day, the allies knew the location of the Nazi defenses thanks to the French resistance. This is just one of the many factors — from the weather to technological advances — that contributed to Operation Overlord’s success. Ukrainian resistance groups have played pivotal roles in similar, albeit smaller, operations, significantly aiding the Ukrainian Armed Forces in liberating villages near Kharkiv and throughout the region. Should Ukraine acquire sufficient weaponry to launch further counteroffensives, the Ukrainian resistance will undoubtedly have its own D-Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, partisans have been instrumental in collecting and transmitting intelligence about the locations of enemy equipment and personnel, enabling the Ukrainian Armed Forces to execute precise strikes against Russian military assets. They support military operations by providing essential intelligence, engaging in sabotage to disrupt enemy logistics and command structures, and creating favorable conditions for Ukrainian military initiatives. This not only impacts the operational capabilities of the occupiers but also exposes critical weaknesses, such as the inadequacy of Russian air defenses in occupied territories. The attacks on Crimea, in particular, have carried substantial geopolitical weight and have bolstered Ukrainian morale, countering Putin’s narratives of Russian might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the actions of the Ukrainian resistance debunk Russian propaganda claims of a welcoming occupied populace and pose challenging questions for the liberal Russian opposition in exile. While some Russians are supporting the Crimean resistance movements, the stark contrast between the vigorous resistance within Ukraine and the lack of any large-scale significant opposition within Russia itself raises critical questions about the authenticity and effectiveness of anti-war sentiments in Russia. The repressive regime in the occupied territories far exceeds that within Russia’s borders — and it is only getting worse. On the other hand, the need to constantly increase the numbers of Russian national guard, FSB, and other security personnel points to the challenges occupiers face in policing resistance activities in the occupied territories. This ongoing resistance stretches Russian resources thin, diverts attention from frontline engagements to internal security, and exacerbates the challenges of sustaining the occupation, further demoralizing the Russian mobilization effort as the local population remains overtly hostile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the suffocating weight of the Russian occupation, Ukrainian men and women continue to identify, intimidate, and assassinate Russian occupiers on a daily basis. As a result, Russia does not have full control over the temporarily occupied territories. It is facing a sustained, well-trained, and astute insurrectionist campaign. This continued resilience and resistance to occupation will play an ever more important role in undermining the sustainability of the Russian war effort. The integration of civilians into the resistance efforts, forming underground networks that provide logistical and intelligence support, underscores the comprehensive nature of the Ukrainian fight. It is imperative that the international community recognizes these regions not as lost causes but as active participants in Ukraine’s ongoing war of liberation. The heroic feats of the Ukrainian resistance deserve to be covered — and Western audiences deserve to read about them. Otherwise, they will develop a flawed understanding of the war and what might be an acceptable, or practical, way to resolve it. It is easier to justify giving up hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women, and children to the arbitrary rule of torturers and executioners if you can pretend that there is no alternative, nobody there is fighting back, and the residents have come around to Russian rule, perhaps even welcomed it. As this report shows, that justification is not true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The heroic feats of the Ukrainian resistance deserve to be covered — and Western audiences deserve to read about them.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;civil-and-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Civil and Policy Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting the Ukrainian resistance is crucial for those committed to thwarting Russian ambitions in the region. The resistance has demonstrated remarkable resilience and effectiveness under extremely challenging conditions. However, these groups require continued moral and financial support to sustain their efforts. Recognizing and amplifying their struggle in media, government discussions, and public discourse is vital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In thinking of ways the West can support the Ukrainian resistance, the author asked resistance fighters past and present to offer their own recommendations. It goes without saying that they all asked first and foremost for more military support to the Ukrainian Armed Forces to help liberate their territories. As such, what follows is selection of their answers that specifically related to the resistance movement. The following recommendations outline realistic actions that can be supported by policymakers and the general public to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of Ukrainian resistance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Information and Perception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhancing the visibility of the resistance’s activities is crucial. There needs to be a significant increase in English-language coverage, possibly through translations of comprehensive reports by Ukrainian media and greater sharing of English-language Ukrainian sources such as the National Resistance Centre. Russian opposition publications like Verstka and Important Stories also produce important reports on the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;One Ukrainian research organization heavily involved in the occupied territories expressed a desire for more support from Russian colleagues in the form of data. For both security and political reasons, such cooperation with Russian anti-war organizations should be mediated through a Western, or neutral, intermediary organization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the words of one ATESH fighter: “We need informational support, so that as many people as possible find out about our struggle. That helps us to recruit new potential agents.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Technological Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensuring the operational continuity of trusted local media outlets in exile is vital. For instance, during its occupation, the local news site Obrii 1909 in Izyum was able, with the help of Western technical support, to unblock its website and then to disseminate crucial information from journalists within and outside the area, bolstering community spirit during critical times.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Facilitating reconnaissance activities that lighten the load on partisans is essential. Civilian and open-source intelligence (OSINT) communities play a pivotal role in gathering and disseminating actionable intelligence, and the Ukrainian communities involved in this space would be grateful for more assistance from Western colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Innovative technological solutions can aid nonviolent resistance. For example, language learning apps could create mirror sites for the Ukrainian language, serving as a tool for cultural preservation and resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. General Fundraising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Public fundraising initiatives like “In the Eyes of Partisans” deserve broad support. Individuals can contribute financially to organizations that supply the resistance with essential equipment like drones and communication devices. Nongovernmental organizations can form partnerships with entities like the National Resistance Centre and the Ukraine Security and Cooperation Centre’s Free Ukraine Fund, which supports the resistance with nonlethal equipment and delivers funding to Ukrainian domestic arms producers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In addition to U.S. support already provided, European countries should provide dedicated funding for special divisions, such as Kraken, and the Special Operations Forces, as well as military intelligence, who form and/or support the resistance. This is especially important given that while special divisions carry out targeted and difficult work, they receive less priority in resource allocation from the Ukrainian Armed Forces, impacting their operational capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Intelligence Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s allies should increase the sharing of satellite imagery to identify coordinates to destroy occupation infrastructure. For example, this could include undermining critical infrastructure used by the occupiers, such as the railway line from Rostov to Dzhankoi, which is crucial for Russian military logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A number of collaborators are reported to be currently living in the European Union, having escaped the Ukrainian liberation via Russia. Ukraine is currently preparing Interpol requests for their extradition, but European countries should proactively identify these individuals and, if there is legally a case to do so, return them to Ukraine to face justice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even small measures, like donating telephones for the resistance or helping to increase public awareness of the resilience of the Ukrainian underground, make a real difference in the desperate conditions of the occupied territories. In the words of one active resistance fighter: “We are grateful to any international and Ukrainian media that bring attention to our activities. It is a great help from their side and an honor for us.” It is important to stress that small acts can have large consequences in these circumstances and that individuals supportive of Ukraine do not feel overwhelmed by the scale of the Russian occupation. After all, Ukrainian partisans continue to believe in their own agency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our faith in liberation is the cornerstone of our struggle. Our actions, every single successful act of sabotage brings victory closer and we understand that perfectly. Every one of us imagines victory day in their own way. For some of us, it will be a massive party, for others a huge demonstration with Ukrainian symbols everywhere, for others still an unbelievable sense of relief. And for the rest, we will just quietly remember all our dead comrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the United States and other countries increasingly engage in multidomain competition with China, it is critical to start from a clear-eyed understanding of China’s human capital and Beijing’s strategy for nurturing national talent. Investments in higher education, strategic STEM sectors, and military talent demonstrate key areas in which Beijing is focusing on cultivating human capital. However, China must overcome significant obstacles to innovate as it faces substantial demographic pressures, socio-economic inequalities, and challenges to attracting and retaining top talent both domestically and internationally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the World Bank, human capital “consists of the knowledge, skills, and health that people invest in and accumulate throughout their lives, enabling them to realize their potential as productive members of society.” Investments in human capital are a major driver of growth for modern economies and the foundation of national capacity to support key technology industries and unlock new scientific discoveries. China’s ability to cultivate, attract, and retain human capital — or as Beijing more commonly puts it, national “talent” — will shape its competitiveness vis-à-vis the United States as a global power and impact the future of innovation and talent on the world stage. As Chinese leader Xi Jinping has stated, “talent is a strategic resource to achieve national revitalization and win the initiative in international competition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s massive population provides a foundational advantage in the supply of talent. The country’s rapid economic growth in recent decades can be directly linked to its mobilization of human capital, as China’s shift from an agrarian base to more productive industry and services sectors was enabled by a growing share of the population attaining higher education levels and entering the workforce. However, the government’s strict population control policies, which until 2016 restricted the majority of Chinese families to only having one child, left China with a rapidly aging population and declining workforce. China’s population shrank for the first time in over half a century in 2022 and fell by over two million in 2023. Birth rates have declined precipitously in recent years, from 13.6 per 1,000 people in 2016 to just 6.4 in 2023. One recent study published in The Lancet predicts that China’s population could decline by nearly 50 percent by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Mc4G1Qm.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s human capital challenges are not merely numerical. Xi Jinping sees “original” and “disruptive” technological innovation and self-reliance as critical to China’s future development and security. Yet as Beijing seeks to move national industries up the value chain in manufacturing, technology, and services, demand for high-skilled labor is outpacing supply. China thus faces an acute skills shortage. For example, according to the “Manufacturing Talent Development Planning Guide” released by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Services, China will face a talent demand gap of nearly 30 million workers by 2025 in 10 key focus areas for China’s manufacturing industry — such as robotics and semiconductors — or a 48 percent shortage of skilled workers to meet demand. Moreover, persistent inequalities in education and career opportunities for rural populations, including over two-thirds of China’s youth, limit the country’s future supply of talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/alqmtNN.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief aims to provide a clear-eyed overview of the Chinese government’s national strategy for cultivating talent and the challenges that China’s national planners confront in their efforts to do so. First, the brief discusses foundational constraints in China’s human capital and how the government is attempting to address them. Next, it examines efforts to create talent pipelines for strategic skill sets in higher education, science and technology industries, and the military. Finally, it explores China’s prospects for attracting and retaining talent across international borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;foundational-constraints-in-chinas-human-capital-environment&quot;&gt;Foundational Constraints in China’s Human Capital Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability of an individual to one day enter a enter lab, research institute, or corporate boardroom is impacted by government investments and regulations, societal norms, and access to opportunities that can either promote or limit that individual’s potential. In China’s domestic context, urban-rural inequities in education and mobility, policies that restrict and repress ethnic minorities, and evolving social norms represent several key constraints on China’s ability to fully tap into national talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;urban-rural-inequality&quot;&gt;Urban-Rural Inequality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inequality between urban and rural populations in China presents a critical challenge to the country’s economic productivity and opportunities to develop human capital. As wages rise and Beijing promotes higher-value industries that require high-skilled workers, China could face major issues of structural unemployment for low-skilled workers concentrated in rural areas. Other countries that have escaped the “middle-income trap,” such as Taiwan and South Korea, tended to have higher levels of secondary education that helped transition the workforce from manufacturing to higher-value-added work. In China, low high school graduation rates, pervasive early childhood development challenges, and urban-rural divides codified in regulations such as the hukou system could limit the country’s transition to a high-skilled workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BiWH8nv.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;early-childhood-development&quot;&gt;Early Childhood Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While discussions of human capital may first conjure images of PhD graduates or high-skilled tech workers, a growing field of academic study recognizes that human capital cultivation begins in childhood. As 90 percent of a person’s brain development happens by the age of five, research shows that healthy early childhood development is linked to positive long-term outcomes in health, educational attainment, future earnings, and employment — all key aspects for a strong national human capital environment. Since the 18th Party Congress in 2012, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has considered children a strategic component of creating a national “talent foundation” and has accordingly undertaken national planning to address issues of early childhood development and primary education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, early childhood development still presents challenges for China. In particular, urban-rural inequality in China negatively impacts early childhood development in rural areas, evident in studies of health issues and measures of cognitive development, such as the Bayley Test. In terms of children’s health, scholars estimate that 60 percent of elementary school children in rural China are affected by anemia, untreated vision problems, or intestinal worms, all of which negatively impact their ability to learn at a critical age. Studies of developmental delays among infants and toddlers in China show that around 50 percent of rural children exhibit cognitive delays, language delays, and socio-emotional delays in early childhood. For older children of elementary and junior-high age, rates of developmental delays continue to be around 40 percent. Because of the outsized importance of the first few years of life on the development of fundamental cognitive, socio-emotional, and other abilities, low levels of cognitive development at this stage have profound effects later in life and can include behavioral problems, lower academic achievement, and decreased lifetime income. To address the root of these inequalities, prominent scholars have suggested that interventions to support childhood nutrition and cognitive development in rural areas could prove highly effective. Given that over two-thirds of China’s children come from rural areas, early childhood development is a critical issue not only for ameliorating urban-rural inequality but also for the country’s overall economic future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;secondary-education&quot;&gt;Secondary Education&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 70 years, China dramatically expanded the reach of its education system, increasing the national literacy rate from about 20 percent in 1949 to nearly 100 percent in 2021. However, the country’s education system still faces deep-seated challenges in cultivating a high-skilled workforce. Compared to other middle-income countries, China’s high school graduation rate is low. One OECD report estimates that in 2022, as little as 36.6 percent of China’s workforce aged 25–64 years old had finished high school, a graduation rate much lower than most middle-income countries, including Mexico (44 percent), South Africa (50 percent), Malaysia (50 percent), and the Indonesia (43 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/26Dl5y5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“As China’s development shifts from factor-driven to innovation-driven, talents become the first resource for development. To fully stimulate and release the talent dividend, the development of Chinese talent undertakings must shift from prioritizing quantity and scale to prioritizing quality and level.” – Shang Qianming&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For students that do complete their secondary education, future career and skill development opportunities can be limited by China’s rigid national examination system. Higher education options for Chinese high schoolers are largely determined by their performance on the “gaokao,” the high-pressure national standardized college entrance exam that acts as the single primary factor in college admission. Gaokao scores are weighed much more strongly in determining whether a student is admitted to a university than U.S. college entrance exams such as the SAT, making it extremely difficult for aspiring university students to overcome a bad gaokao score through performance on other scales such as a high GPA or extracurriculars. Designed to offer equal opportunity for students across China, and with societal roots that trace back to the imperial examination system, the gaokao also puts intense social pressure on young students and greatly limits academic options for those who perform poorly. Students who score lower on the tests can only attend programs that likely lack the alumni networks or name recognition needed to give graduates a boost in China’s competitive job market. Indeed, according to a 2017 joint study by researchers from Tsinghua University and UC San Diego, students from China’s more prestigious universities earned 30 to 40 percent more on average compared with their peers who went to lower-tier institutions, a difference that can be ascribed to better career support, networks, and name recognition by potential employers. The prestige of the gaokao also limits the national development of vocational schools, which are separate from the exam system. This lowers the quality and amount of financial resources, infrastructure, and educational personnel these schools receive and thereby reduces pathways for young people to build successful careers beyond the route of doing well on a single test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hukou-system-and-domestic-mobility&quot;&gt;The Hukou System and Domestic Mobility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the magnitude of urban-rural inequalities cannot be attributed to a single regulatory system, examining China’s household registration system demonstrates how urban-rural divisions are codified in regulations that limit mobility for rural workers, thus constraining China’s ability to move workers to where their skills could be most productively applied. Adopted in the 1950s, the “hukou” system broadly divides rural and urban citizens. In effect, the system limits access to public goods for rural migrants to China’s cities, causing a host of issues for China’s internal migrants, including limiting access to urban public education, limiting access to healthcare services in cities, and discriminating against rural hukou holders in the labor market. Overall, the hukou system controls the rate of rural-to-urban migration as part of a national effort to limit risk of social instability, which generates a drag on total national economic productivity and worsens rural-urban inequality. According to a 2015 survey by the Institute of Sociology, about 80 percent of China’s students attending vocational colleges came from rural backgrounds, whereas the majority of students at top “elite” universities came from urban backgrounds (65 percent). Meanwhile, rural students made up the majority of students in “ordinary” second- and third- tier universities (56 percent), relegating many rural youths to jobs with lower salaries, fewer benefits, and less stability. This inequality in access to educational resources only hardens rural-urban inequality as the disparity is passed from older generations to younger ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shortcomings of the hukou system are not lost on Chinese policymakers, and both the central government and local authorities are pushing forward reform. In 2014, Beijing launched the National New-type Urbanization Plan (2014–2020), which aimed to facilitate rural migrants’ transition to urban residents. In 2021, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced plans to relax hukou restrictions in most cities, while Hainan, Shanghai, and Hangzhou also announced relaxations on living or house-buying restrictions. Though it is too early to assess the results of the hukou reforms, the success of past efforts has been mixed. One central goal of 2014’s National New-type Urbanization Plan was to lessen the gap between social benefits enjoyed by urban versus rural hukou holders in cities, but data show that the gap has instead widened. On the other hand, research on firms exposed to hukou reform shows higher levels of labor market flexibility in cities with hukou reform. In short, though the government is taking steps to improve the hukou system, piecemeal efforts will continue to inhibit productivity and human capital development in China until there is free labor mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“Starting from the equalization of access to basic public services to implement a redistributive policy with Chinese characteristics, we can also maintain social mobility and expand the sharing of economic development in order to continuously improve the well-being of residents. The special challenge facing China is that the more ample mobility and integration of labor are hampered by the delay in the reform of the household registration system.” – Cai Feng&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ethnic-inequality-and-minority-policy&quot;&gt;Ethnic Inequality and Minority Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on social stability at the root of the hukou system also extends to government policies toward ethnic minorities. More than 91 percent of China’s population is Han Chinese, while the remainder of China’s population identifies as an ethnic minority. Significant socioeconomic inequalities between minority groups and the Han majority limit both individual opportunity for social mobility and overall national economic productivity. Studies have found that minorities are paid lower wages on average and that gaps in educational attainment play into the income gap between Han and minority groups, particularly in rural areas. As China seeks to increase the skill level of its workforce, limits on the potential of the 125 million people who identify as ethnic minorities constrain the country’s overall ability to fully utilize its human capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Chinese leadership’s ethnic minority policy emphasizes assimilation, stability, and anti-terror work as top priorities. Mass human rights abuses in Xinjiang demonstrate Beijing’s willingness to promote an increasingly repressive regime in the name of fighting terrorism and separatism, regardless of the human cost. Chinese ethnic policy varies by ethnicity and region, but by Beijing’s logic, the common thread running through all 55 of China’s ethnic minorities is their proper place as willing members in a “Chinese national family,” as defined by Xi. While official rhetoric emphasizes the benefits assimilation can bring to ethnic minority populations, it often downplays or ignores problems of cultural loss or rights abuses, as well as the social and economic costs of interethnic divisions within China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limits-on-the-innovation-environment&quot;&gt;Limits on the Innovation Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the policy systems and social support nets that form the basis of a strong human capital environment, social factors such as norms and popular movements can play an important role in both promoting and limiting potential. From the unique entrepreneurship culture generated in innovation hubs such as Silicon Valley to the impact of racial and economic obstacles in inhibiting innovation, sociocultural factors can both incubate innovation and create barriers for talent around the world. In China, the impacts of gender discrimination in the workplace and a new movement advocating detachment from a competitive workplace culture illustrate how social forces and trends in popular culture can limit China’s ability to fully utilize its human capital resources. Meanwhile, both the unique makeup of China’s state-centric economy and political backlash against prominent entrepreneurs indicate that the country’s environment may be trending in the direction of restricting entrepreneurial potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the impact of social movements on human capital utilization can be found in the recent popularity of the “lying flat” movement, which calls for relinquishing the stresses and ambitions of modern life. In April 2021, an online post titled “Lying Flat Is Justice” went viral in China, prompting a flurry of online discussion on the virtues of resigning from one’s job or otherwise eschewing the competitive work culture common in many tech and other high-skilled careers. While it is difficult to measure the real impact of the “lying flat” movement in prompting Chinese workers to withdraw from the workplace, survey data shows that discontent with competitive work culture is widely felt among China’s white-collar workers. In a 2019 employment trends report produced by Zhaopin, a leading career development consultancy, 80 percent of surveyed respondents said that “respect for employees” is the most important factor in corporate culture, while over 50 percent reported feeling that they needed to be on-call 24/7. Zhaopin’s 2020 employment trends report highlighted a lack of trust between employees and employers, with only 10 percent of workers surveyed reporting that they trust their employer. With an already shrinking workforce, China’s growth model can ill-afford burnout and disillusionment limiting the economic contributions of existing workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concrete impact of social issues on economic growth is also evident in data on gender discrimination in China’s workforce. A combination of policy and societal factors has increased barriers for women in the workforce, resulting in a rising gender gap in labor force participation rates in China. For example, while many major economies have seen the workforce gender gaps close in recent decades, China’s grew from 9.4 percent in 1994 to 14.1 percent in 2020. Policy changes such as declining numbers of state-supported childcare facilities and social factors such as bias in hiring contribute to this growing gap, resulting in underutilization of China’s female workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s entrepreneurship environment is another area in which economic and social structures may limit innovation. In an economy that stresses the central role of the government, many accomplished young Chinese graduates consider working in the state sector as their ideal job. In a sample survey conducted between 2010 and 2015 of over 30,000 college graduates from 90 colleges in China, 62.5 percent marked the government or state sector as their preferred employer. Such jobs offer safety and security that often is attractive to urban college graduates. However, the dynamism and productivity of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) tends to be lower than that of private companies. As more top talent flows to the state sector, it likely will have a dampening effect on China’s economic dynamism. While measuring lost entrepreneurial potential is difficult, research on the employment choices of accomplished college graduates does suggest a trend of top students being diverted from private sector entrepreneurship to the state sector. Along with economic incentives to enter the state sector, social pressures may also discourage would-be entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particularly since Alibaba founder Jack Ma’s fall from grace in 2020, many international commentators have lamented the end of an era of relative openness for bold entrepreneurs in China amid an increasingly restrictive atmosphere for the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;developing-strategic-talent-pipelines&quot;&gt;Developing Strategic Talent Pipelines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above sections discussed ways in which regulatory, demographic, and normative constraints on China’s human capital environment limit the country’s aggregate ability to develop and utilize human capital. The broad impact of these constraints can be difficult to measure, particularly at the level of specific strategic industries. A more direct line between talent cultivation and national policy priorities can be seen in government-led efforts to create domestic talent pipelines for strategic skill sets in STEM, critical technology sectors, and military expertise. Outcomes in STEM PhD growth, cultivation of artificial intelligence (AI) curricula, advances in military education, and increasing research and development (R&amp;amp;D) spending demonstrate areas where government policies are shaping the national human capital to increase in-demand skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;talent-pipelines-in-higher-education&quot;&gt;Talent Pipelines in Higher Education&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing investment in the higher education system has driven research productivity at top Chinese universities and boosted their global rankings. Between 2012 and 2021, China’s Ministry of Education increased spending on higher education from $24 billion to $47 billion. Along with helping to grow the international stature of top Chinese universities (between 2010 and 2020, the number of Chinese universities listed in the top 500 on at least one global ranking more than tripled), rising investment in higher education creates pathways to promote specific in-demand skill sets, particularly in STEM. China’s growing capacity to cultivate high-level STEM expertise is evident in the increasing number of STEM doctorates produced by Chinese universities each year. By 2025, Chinese universities are projected to produce more than 77,000 STEM PhD graduates per year, more than double the 2010 level of about 34,000 STEM PhD graduates. In comparison, the United States is projected to graduate only approximately 40,000 STEM PhD students in 2025, a figure that includes over 16,000 international students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with increasing investment in the country’s higher education system, policymakers are instituting targeted programs to create university talent pipelines for specific skill sets such as cybersecurity, semiconductor manufacturing, and AI expertise. For example, Beijing launched a program to certify World-Class Cybersecurity Schools in 2017, which sets standards across certified schools for education in cybersecurity and allows government bodies to direct what coursework and skill development is integrated into university coursework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, growth in STEM PhDs and Chinese university rankings may not capture the full picture of the quality of China’s higher education. One study on critical thinking and STEM skills comparing Chinese students to peers from the United States, Russia, and India found that STEM undergraduates in China actually saw critical thinking and STEM skill levels decline over four years in college, a phenomenon that scholars posit may be linked to institutional weaknesses in curricula and university program design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;science-and-technology&quot;&gt;Science and Technology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China aims to become a scientific and technological powerhouse by 2049. In furtherance of this goal, Beijing has directed significant resources and support for initiatives designed to attract and ensure talent cultivation in the fields of science and technology. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, $430 billion, or 2.54 percent of China’s GDP, was invested in R&amp;amp;D by the government in 2022, an increase of 10.1 percent from the previous year. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States allocated $720 billion to R&amp;amp;D in 2020. This makes China the second-largest spender on R&amp;amp;D in the world. China’s R&amp;amp;D input in 2020 consisted of around 6 percent in basic research, 11 percent in applied research, and 83 percent in experimental research. In comparison, the United States spent 15 percent of its R&amp;amp;D input on basic research, 20 percent on applied research, and 65 percent on experimental research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uKLajZW.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4O1X6qc.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These investments have yielded results. In the 2023 World Intellectual Property Organization’s Global Innovation Index, China ranked twelfth overall, moving up two places since 2020. The country also ranked fourth in knowledge and technology outputs, just behind the United States. China also sourced the most peer-reviewed papers. While U.S. articles traditionally comprised most of the top 1 percent of the world’s most highly cited articles, studies have found that Chinese research ranked as high as or higher than U.S. work in the top 1 percent of scientific studies in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a top-down approach to innovation coupled with growing R&amp;amp;D investments is no guarantee of success. According to Fitch Ratings, 49 percent of China’s corporate 2020 R&amp;amp;D spending came from SOEs. But compared to private companies, SOEs have been shown to have lower rates of efficiency per dollar in terms of patent output. Government allocations have been found to have crowding-out effects on private investments in Chinese R&amp;amp;D. A study by Boeing has shown a reduction of around 6.5 percent in private R&amp;amp;D investments in Chinese large to medium enterprises (LMEs) with each standard deviation of government R&amp;amp;D subsidies invested in LMEs. Government-directed R&amp;amp;D also has produced inefficient allocation of resources, following a pattern that has been evident in countries with state-guided scientific development models, tracing back to the former Soviet Union and Japan. Notably, an uptick in R&amp;amp;D subsidies has also correlated with an increase in the misallocation of funds by some of the recipients, which diminishes the return on investment of China’s R&amp;amp;D inputs. Furthermore, while Chinese research-intensive universities and firms have gained in international reputation, they still might not be enticing enough to attract the top talents among China’s diaspora given that China’s higher education institutions are not as well-known as other global knowledge production peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;military-talent-programs&quot;&gt;Military Talent Programs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“Xi Jinping pointed out that we need to reach deep to address prominent issues and problems constraining China’s military talent work, and press ahead in a coordinated way with reform and innovation in identifying, pooling, cultivating and appointing talent.” – Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since taking power in 2012, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has pushed sweeping reforms to modernize the country’s military, including through the enhancement of the military’s human capital expertise to ensure higher levels of competency and readiness. The Sixth Plenum Resolution of the 19th Party Congress (a plenum being the annual national meeting of the top officials in the CCP for each generation of the Party Congress) called for strengthening the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with the recruitment and training of more knowledgeable recruits and proficient talent. This had the objective of establishing a “military education policy for the New Era” (as proclaimed by Xi Jinping regarding China’s goals of modernization and development at the CCP’s 19th National Congress in October 2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bvPU66S.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, the Central Military Commission issued an order to enhance and modernize the country’s military talent through improving the military’s capacity and combat readiness. This statement framed the recruitment of talent as critical to the composition of the PLA by ensuring that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“. . . the barrel of the gun is always in the hands of people who are loyal and reliable to the party, will strengthen the party’s overall leadership of talent work, implement the party’s organizational line in the new era, implement the responsibility system of the chairman of the military commission, adhere to the political training and inspection of talents, and unswervingly ensure a pure selection and employment of political ecology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from requiring political adherence to CCP ideology — which some military analysts regard as hampering military effectiveness by taking time away from training to focus on the study of Marxist-Leninism and party policy lines — the government has emphasized the implementation of strong technical capabilities in the training of military personnel with the goal to, as Xi emphasizes, “make fighting and winning wars the starting point and objective of talent work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to supply this expertise, China’s military has promoted incentives to recruit more educated personnel and improve human capital in the ranks, including through financial bonuses and programs to attract university graduates to enroll as officers. Indeed, one of the major weaknesses in the PLA’s human capital has been a perceived inability to attract educated recruits as wages have risen in coastal urban areas and major cities, which has made the civilian economy more appealing for young Chinese than serving in the PLA. In order to retain talented staff, the PLA offered a pay increase starting in 2017 for qualified officers which would be drawn from defense budgets that continued to grow by more than 8 percent a year. The PLA also seeks to streamline its recruitment toward a more balanced force with less emphasis on army recruitment and more focus on recruiting talent into other military branches, including the People’s Liberation Army Navy and the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, as well as training and integrating joint force operation capabilities between these branches. These efforts are being followed by new forms of training and military education. The PLA also restructured its professional military education program to increase the quality and competence of PLA personnel by updating curricular changes focusing on emerging fields such as information technology, aerospace, and computer sciences. For Beijing, these reforms in human capital recruitment and training are critical for China’s ability to field a modernized, world-class military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attracting-and-retaining-talent&quot;&gt;Attracting and Retaining Talent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s ability to retain domestic talent and attract foreign experts is another key dimension to enhancing national competitiveness. After decades of experiencing “brain-drain” of top talent leaving China to work in the United States and elsewhere, China is trying to reverse the flow to achieve “brain gain” from the rest of the world. Government efforts to incentivize foreign-educated citizens to either return to China or remain in China are well documented in “talent programs.” Immigration may seem unnecessary for a country home to nearly 20 percent of the global population, a “national condition” that opponents within China have cited in arguments against immigration. However, the ability to attract international talent can be critical for flexibility in plugging skills shortages and creating a diverse environment for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;talent-programs&quot;&gt;Talent Programs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cultivation of expertise and knowledge from China’s citizens has been vital to Xi Jinping’s vision of “sharpening China’s competitive edge in human resources.” Through over 200 talent-recruitment initiatives — including the controversial Thousand Talents program and the Young Thousand Talents Program — Beijing has sought to retain Chinese tertiary education students and skilled workers through economic incentives while also making the country an attractive source for academic collaboration and professional expertise from abroad. By 2018, the Thousand Talents program had attracted nearly 7,000 experts to work in Chinese academia and institutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programs designed to retain homegrown expertise and incentivize overseas Chinese students, researchers, and experts to return to the country have become a key focus of Western discourse on China’s talent strategy. Western analysis of these government-sponsored programs often focuses on their roles in industrial espionage and hollowing out of industries. News stories on China’s talent programs have often focused on indictments of talent program awardees accused of making false statements about their ties to China or stealing intellectual property from Western research facilities. But overemphasizing alleged criminal cases in discourse on talent programs can have a chilling effect on scientific and academic advancement in the United States and obscure the bigger picture of talent programs as part of China’s efforts to bolster its domestic talent base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the role of acquiring expertise abroad, the success of talent programs provides insight on the elements of China’s work environment that act as either incentives or deterrents for would-be returnees. Research on efforts by Chinese government institutions, universities, and scientific organizations to attract returnee scholars underlines that beyond monetary and status incentives, non-material aspects of a research environment play an important role in attracting back returnees, such as research climate and academic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another hurdle for many foreign and returnee talents coming to China is the country’s circumscribed digital environment. In the context of the global information economy, ready access to the internet is critical to a country’s competitiveness, as open internet access allows individuals to exchange new ideas and integrate breakthroughs elsewhere to accelerate their own research. However, these restrictions have adversely impacted the ability of China’s researchers and academics to access key online resources for information, such as Google Scholar and Springer Nature, not to mention key sources of daily news about global developments, such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;immigration&quot;&gt;Immigration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immigration impacts a country’s ability to draw top international experts and bridge the gap in skills shortages in domestic populations, representing a key component of overall human capital competitiveness. In Xi’s own words, “China’s development needs the participation of world talents.” But with a legal framework that offers few pathways to permanent residence and with international migrants constituting only 0.1 percent of China’s total population, the country’s restrictive immigration system is a limiting factor in its access to global talent. Immigration governance reform under the Xi administration has indicated room for change in both legal frameworks and domestic perspectives on immigration. However, immigration controls since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic point to an increasingly closed system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2010s saw increased momentum for reform to China’s immigration system: the State Council described the permanent resident system as an important part of the country’s human capital strategy in 2016; Xi touted the strategic wisdom of “gathering talents from all over the world” to the 19th Party Congress; and Beijing established the nation’s first national migration agency in 2018. At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, momentum shifted away from economic-minded immigration reform. Instead, border authorities turned their focus to preventing coronavirus outbreaks, a move that fell in line with broader policy trends that prioritize security and centralization over economic growth in areas that involve international exchange. Though foreign travel to China has resumed since the end of the country’s zero-Covid policy, China’s foreign population today is severely diminished from 2019 levels, and many businesses are accelerating efforts to localize high-skill jobs rather than relying on international talent to fill key roles in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The different aspects of China’s human capital outlined in this report all link back to China’s ambitions to become a leader across multiple categories of national competitiveness. Chinese policymakers have both sizable advantages and considerable challenges in realizing the country’s ambitions. Through the statements of senior leaders and the policies that accompany them, the Chinese government clearly recognizes that the advancement of the country’s human capital resources will be pivotal to securing China’s future economic and geopolitical potential. As with other national priorities, China’s leaders likely will act with speed to concentrate significant focus and resources on elevating the productivity and innovative capacity of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s growing ability to attract expertise and nurture its human capital ecosystem will have important implications for U.S. policymakers and the American public alike. The more success China achieves in improving the quality of its workforce, the faster the country will innovate and the more nationally competitive China will become on the world stage. With four times the population of the United States, China does not need to match America in per capita productivity to surpass the United States economically. It merely needs to close the gap. Since the United States cannot match China in terms of quantity, it will face an even greater premium to preserve its qualitative edge in workforce talent in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global competition will force the United States to adopt new combatant command designs optimized for gray zone competition and security cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt; These new commands will better integrate gender dynamics and analyze human terrain and competing influence networks to gain access, deny benefits, impose costs, and reassure partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The integrated deterrence doctrine will drive the U.S. military to combine cyber, space, and electronic warfare and other information-related capabilities into a new multidomain strategic command.&lt;/strong&gt; The command will support integrated planning, provide a larger menu of options for conventional and nuclear deterrence, and synchronize multidomain effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There will be fewer combatant commands but more combined joint interagency task forces scaled to meet emerging challenges.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States will check authoritarian advances globally by better synchronizing instruments of power and creating new command and control architectures to align authorities and partners against missions globally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every two years, a ritual takes over the Pentagon. A mix of service priorities, presidential prerogatives, defense ideas, and congressional intrigue combine in a cauldron called the Unified Command Plan (UCP). The classified document specifies functional and geographic responsibilities and uses this division to assign missions, planning, training, and operational responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the ritual takes place in the “Puzzle Palace” today, the authors have decided to join the ranks of pundits new and old with ideas for revising the UCP — but with a twist. They have refined a large language model (LLM) with over 600 authoritative texts on topics ranging from military history and international relations theory to competitive strategy and deterrence into nine datasets to explore alternative blueprints for the U.S. military. Two insights have emerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the tendency to create new commands may have reached its limit and potentially undermines calls for integrated deterrence and better synchronization of effects across domains, the U.S. government, and the U.S. network of partners and allies. For example, in this study, the LLM — across multiple iterations — kept generating UCP designs optimized for long-term competition with China that merged cyber, space, and electronic warfare capabilities into a unified command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the current U.S. blueprint for projecting power and influence struggles in day-to-day competition and integrating development assistance, security cooperation, and economic measures in a holistic manner. The LLM consistently generated alternative UCP designs organized around this central idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net result is a series of options the authors hope will help the civil servants and military professionals who have the Sisyphean task of aligning the structure of the Department of Defense (DOD) with the reality of twenty-first-century great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-wrong-with-the-ucp&quot;&gt;What’s Wrong with the UCP?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critiques of the UCP focus either on specific issues and geographic seams or on larger bureaucratic challenges associated with the design of the national security enterprise. In fact, War on the Rocks has been a hotbed for debates about the right types of commands to address the changing character of war and evolving strategic challenges. Authors have debated U.S. Space Command, building a future warfare command, and geographic designs that are better aligned with the prevailing demand signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A risk-averse culture and bureaucracy haunt these debates. Combatant commands appear as bloated proconsuls because they try to compensate for a misaligned national security enterprise. Organizationally, the U.S. government struggles to reconcile maps between the Department of State (DOS) and DOD because the perception of the world is shaped by theater and global campaign plans. Out of desperation, many stakeholders therefore turn to the National Security Council (NSC) to synchronize interagency activities. However, statutorily speaking, the NSC is a coordinating body to untangle the differences across the federal government rather than policymaking to align campaign plans. The net result is strategy as cacophony and an inherent dilemma where unity of effort should reside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue is proponency, a fancy term that describes the advocacy of people sitting at senior decisionmaking tables and, crucially, their priorities. Proponency is a key aspect of defense politics that plays out in UCP revisions, among other places. The higher the rank of the person in charge of a particular issue set, region, or capability, the easier it will be to argue for budget shares. In 2019, concerns about insufficient advocacy for the space mission within the DOD led to a proponency overcompensation in the form of the near-simultaneous creation of the Space Force and U.S. Space Command. In 1986, the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act ensured that operational commanders and service chiefs had a clear division of roles and responsibilities in order to prevent further U.S. military fiascos. Needless to say, focusing a service chief and a four-star commander on the same mission set runs counter to the organizational design of the Pentagon and could create greater risk of future military fiascos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem with proponency dominating the command structure is that there are only so many senior decisionmaking tables, but the list of issues the department grapples with is enormous and grows every day. There is an inherent mismatch between what is important and who gets to decide what to do about things that are deemed important — not to mention the fact that every four-star leader is supported by a galaxy of subordinate general and flag officers. The issue has led at least one former secretary of defense to complain of “brass creep,” or an inflated number of officers with stars on their shoulders running the U.S. military without solving enduring strategic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these concerns, like most bureaucratic processes, the result tends to create winners and losers while leaving both equally unhappy. With a two-year update cycle prone to parochial infighting over budgets and authorities, change tends to take the form of addition over optimization. It is easier to satisfice and add structure than it is to realign or reduce the number of combatant commands. This puts a premium on growth that may be suboptimal and reinforces a tendency for service-level interests over a unified joint or combined approach to modern operational art and campaigning. Furthermore, competing ideas, parochial interests, veto players, and the enduring quest for turf and money plague open dialogue. The net result is diminishing returns and a span of control issues that inflate the number of four-star generals and staffs running the U.S. military without solving enduring strategic challenges. As staffs become bloated, command structures grow unwieldy, and defense budgets balloon, roles and missions expand without a corresponding increase in either security or strategic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-answer-a-strategy-question-tailor-a-model&quot;&gt;To Answer a Strategy Question, Tailor a Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze options for UCP reform, the authors worked with the CSIS Futures Lab and Scale AI to build datasets optimized for retrieval augmented generation — a technique for refining how large models weight documents to generate text. This technique is particularly useful for overcoming the inherent limitations LLMs face when addressing specialized questions and context-dependent domains. Applied to national security, these models can help support campaign planning, wargaming, and studying escalation dynamics (Table 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QgFzmka.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Training Datasets.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Futures Lab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the authors had the model summarize common criticisms of the UCP to provide a baseline leveraging 119 prior studies of UCP reform. Of note, much of the criticism matched the prevailing debate, which is not a surprise since LLMs excel at basic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the authors used this baseline to explore alternative UCP reform options weighted against different combinations of datasets to, in essence, force productive hallucinations and novel insights. These datasets included 70 documents on Chinese military doctrine and competitive strategy; 205 documents on deterrence theory, military history, and operational art; and 232 document excerpts on international relations cutting across multiple theoretical schools of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rI57Vmi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Model Threads.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these datasets, the authors asked the model (1) to create an illustrative scenario depicting global competition between the United States and China and (2) to recommend a new set of combatant and functional commands based on the scenario that ensures the United States is sufficiently aligned to counter the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors ran this sequence four times to explore where the model returns converged and where they diverged (Figure 1). In model one — “The Hunt for Asymmetries” — the authors used concepts from competitive strategy and assessments of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) military strategy to analyze UCP rewrite options. In model two — “The Rational Past as Prologue” — the authors used deterrence theory, military history, and concepts from bargaining theory to analyze UCP rewrite options. In model three — “Anarchy Shapes All Decisionmaking” — the authors used texts on realism from international relations theory. Last, in model four — “Stories Guide the Art of the Possible” — the authors used a mix of social constructivism and critical perspectives to analyze UCP rewrite options. Below the authors summarize the results from each iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, to help visualize and describe the alternative strategic logics, the research team tailored prompts to produce stylized paintings using the Midjourney AI Pro art generator. To create a common reference point, the team combined international relations theory references with prompts requesting the LLM to produce a “painting in the style of Norman Rockwell.” The use of this famous American artist situates the visual logic in classic portrayals of American nostalgia, a deliberate effort to show alternatives to the Cold War history of the UCP for a new era of great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hunt-for-asymmetries&quot;&gt;The Hunt for Asymmetries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thread focused on using net assessment and documents on Chinese military strategy to assess the UCP. The thread depicted an outsize role for U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) supported by existing regional commands — consistent with current approaches to global integration — and a host of new functional commands. The thread discussed the need to organize roles and missions around an evolving assessment of regional military balances relative to force posture. It also discussed the need to evaluate military balance and force posture in a search for asymmetry. In other words, net assessment should drive competitive strategy and alteration of assigned forces within the existing UCP structure and the current global integration framework, placing USINDOPACOM as the global coordinating authority for competition with China, supported by regional and functional commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thread sought to expand the number and type of functional commands required to support long-term competition with China. First, it expanded U.S. Cyber Command to include a larger role in technology policy and research, development, testing, and engineering. In addition to coordinating cyber offense and defense activities, the thread detailed new responsibilities for protecting U.S. technology from Chinese cyber theft and focusing investments in advanced military technology, currently overseen by the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering as well as service-level entities. Second, the model discussed the need for a new functional command focused on coordinating intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities globally, with an eye toward countering Chinese battle networks and developing indicators and warnings on military capabilities and troop deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the tailored LLM suggested the United States should, through the UCP, get its act together when it comes to nonmilitary aspects of national security policy. First, the model discussed the need for a new functional command focused on economic security. The interagency command would counter Chinese economic strategies harmful to U.S. interests, counter economic coercion against partners and allies, and coordinate interagency measures addressing issues such as trade imbalances, intellectual property protection, and other economic security concerns like the labor market. Second, the model proposed new structures dedicated to human assistance and disaster relief to promote stability and enhance the reputation of the United States in regions where China is expanding its influence. These new soft power approaches are intended to appeal to the hearts and minds that China has courted in the past or is actively courting. Examples include countries in the Belt and Road Initiative or regions like Africa and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the discussion is consistent with the large body of debates on interagency reform and past tendencies to expand, vice optimize, the UCP to solve evolving strategy challenges. What is interesting, however, is the model’s conclusion that integrating civilian-military effects into an operational and operational-level command structure is necessary to gain a long-term advantage against the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-rational-past-as-prologue&quot;&gt;The Rational Past as Prologue&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second model combined documents on deterrence, military history, and operational art. Of note, the scenario the model returned anchored global competition around a potential crisis in the South China Sea, drawing on principles from deterrence theory more than from operational art or military history. Most of the output discussed using diplomacy alongside demonstrations of military capability with only a limited discussion of combined arms and lines of operation. In other words, escalation management loomed larger than gaining a near-term decisive military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the model envisioned competition with China as global and cutting across multiple domains in an effort to support a cost-imposition strategy. The scenario discussed using security cooperation in Africa to counter Chinese access and diplomacy to counter growing Chinese influence in Eastern Europe. The scenario discussed working with partners and the private sector to make it more difficult for China to gain an advantage in space and cyberspace. Last, the scenario focused on diplomacy and economic sanctions as the main effort, seeking to signal to China the risks of continued escalation. According to the model, these combined lines of effort created a more synchronized approach to strategy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All these activities have a constant backdrop of political diplomacy, economic negotiations, and information campaigns to create a comprehensive response strategy. These strategies collectively work towards deterring China from aggressive action and work to maintain the balance of power in line with international rules and norms. This kind of strategizing effectively uses the UCP and its multiple combatant commands, integrating operational art and deterrence theory on a global scale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this strategy, the model recommended the following changes to the UCP. First, it advocated consolidating existing combatant command structures. U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) would be merged to form a new Eurasian Command to better link global competition with Russia and China outside of USINDOPACOM. The same logic applied to U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) and U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM). The model recommended a new Americas command merging the two to better prioritize countering China’s growing influence in South America. The model also recommended merging several of the functional commands, including the U.S. Cyber Command and U.S. Space Command, to better synchronize multidomain operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the model recommended an operational command structure similar to the net assessment thread (“The Hunt for Asymmetries”) to make economic competition a central pillar of national strategy. Of note, the model saw the primary role of the functional command as coordinating interagency activities to counter the Belt and Road Initiative and Beijing’s economic priorities. The model identified the need to coordinate nonmilitary forms of power with traditional military roles and missions to manage long-term competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;anarchy-shapes-all-decisionmaking&quot;&gt;Anarchy Shapes All Decisionmaking&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When weighted with realist texts, the model focused more on how best to manage escalation regardless of the structure of combatant commands alongside the need to better integrate different agencies and instruments of power. Specifically, the model highlighted war control — a PLA concept for controlling the pace and intensity of escalation — as providing the United States an opportunity to take a measured approach to maximizing its security. Second, the model saw the future of integrated deterrence less in technology and more in how well the United States integrates multiple instruments of power and works alongside partners and allies. Last, the model saw the future as a global struggle and highlighted the need for the United States to focus on maintaining favorable regional balances of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stories-guide-the-art-of-the-possible&quot;&gt;Stories Guide the Art of the Possible&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When weighted with constructivist and critical theory texts, the model prioritized norms, power dynamics, and underlying narratives. This focus meant the analysis of UCP options prioritized shaping stories and how people perceive the word over regional balances of power. The model focused on a new global engagement command with elements similar to those discussed in the operational art and deterrence theory iterations, albeit based on different assumptions. Modern competition was seen as a war over ideas. In this logic, the United States needs to address not just China’s current actions but also the wider power dynamics and structural issues at play in foreign policy and how they collide in stories, propaganda, and global influence campaigns. The model assessed that these responses could involve challenging dominant narratives around sovereignty, power, and security but should avoid imposing Western-centric narratives and norms in diplomatic initiatives. Like previous threads, the insights support new, novel structures linked to coordinating nonmilitary instruments of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-options-to-explore&quot;&gt;Policy Options to Explore&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all statistical models are incomplete, some are useful, and generative artificial intelligence (AI) is no different. The ideas that emerged from this experiment suggest three options worth further deliberation for rewriting the UCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhance-command-structure-for-global-engagement-and-competition&quot;&gt;Enhance Command Structure for Global Engagement and Competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the threads, the generative model highlighted a need to better organize the DOD — if not the entire national security enterprise — for competition short of war. These campaigns would combine traditional security cooperation activity with new efforts to protect U.S. technology and economic access. Better still, this realignment could help better connect competition and contingency planning, a perennial challenge in the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge in the current UCP design is that the authorities for these activities are divided between multiple government agencies that do not have similar regional planning frameworks (e.g., DOS and DOD). Furthermore, these activities are not strictly military, making them outside the purvey of geographic combatant commands. Getting better synchronization, therefore, would likely require deeper debate about how to design a national security system that currently contrasts DOD efforts to manage regional security challenges with the country-specific orientation of the DOS. That is a tall order and one likely to involve Congress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near term, military planners should consider using the UCP to task each combatant command to stand up interagency joint task forces for competition. This standing task force would enact current theater and global competition plans but serve as a focal point for better coordinating with other agency activities. In the absence of new authorities, a large amount of the task force’s time would be used to establish interagency awareness and develop a common understanding of the range of ongoing programs and activities in the region and how best to align competition planning with them. This interagency awareness over time could evolve to inform national security coordination through the NSC and augment experiments with battle networks currently ongoing through the Global Information Dominance Experiments (GIDE) managed by the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;merge-space-cyber-and-information-effects&quot;&gt;Merge Space, Cyber, and Information Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the threads, an approach to military strategy emerged that stands in stark contrast to the last decade of UCP rewrites. Rather than continue to create new functional commands, the model proposed fusing them into a single command somewhat similar to the recently disbanded PLA Strategic Support Force. In some respects, such an entity could even be folded back into U.S. Strategic Command for a one-stop shop for deterrence and setting conditions for modern war fighting. The operative question is what the DOD gains from creating multiple functional commands instead of streamlining and rationalizing them into new entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UCP rewrite team could consider incremental options, such as focusing on global competition. For example, it could experiment with establishing a sub–unified command in each geographic command focused on integrating space, cyber, and information effects into ongoing operations. While interesting, this incremental approach would likely create duplicate structures and would not address the pull to create four-star headquarters for each new domain alongside new services. Clearly, modern competition and war fighting require the ability to integrate multiple domains. Therefore, assigning roles and missions with this unity of effort in mind should drive UCP reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-regions-fewer-components&quot;&gt;New Regions, Fewer Components&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, the model suggested realigning existing geographic combatant command boundaries. The model played with new seams for global competition with China, including an Americas Command merging USSOUTHCOM and USNORTHCOM and a Eurasia Command merging USEUCOM and CENTCOM. This logic is similar to that of earlier experiments during the Cold War that went as far as creating one command for overseas forces and another for those in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left unsaid by the model was that merging existing geographic combatant command boundaries could produce cost savings and provide a model for even more radical reductions. For example, are service component commands truly necessary? In both his planning guidance and subsequent comments, General Berger, the 38th commandant of the Marine Corps, expressed concerns about a lack of naval integration that inadvertently emerged as a result of the Goldwater-Nichols Act. Maybe it is time to reduce the number of service components at each combatant command, if not eliminate them outright, since service headquarters can coordinate directly to assign forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current team working on the UCP could explore opportunities to reduce the number of headquarters and build structures that better align with the shape of global competition with the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-back-to-the-ritual&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Back to the Ritual&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UCP rewrites are both an opportunity and a bureaucratic conundrum for those who oversee the ritual. Wasting that opportunity, despite the painful debates that need to occur, would abdicate professional responsibility both for those in the fight and for those watching from the outside but still dedicating themselves to national security reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contributions of this report are illustrative, not conclusive. The series of LLMs tailored with key documents highlight big ideas but nothing especially new. For years, national security practitioners have known the current design of the U.S. national security enterprise is broken. The UCP is just one part of that larger Cold War–era bureaucracy in need of a reboot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The models reiterate the need to rethink functional and geographic command structures alongside their roles and missions. If nothing else, there are significant cost savings to be had from merging commands as well as rethinking the current map. Staffers in the bureaucratic fight over the next UCP must at least answer the question, Why shouldn’t the United States merge the U.S. Space and Cyber Commands? More interesting is the need to imagine new ways of integrating military and nonmilitary power to manage long-term competition with the CCP. Again, ongoing dialogue inside the Pentagon should at least consider an Americas and Eurasia Command and, more importantly, what command structures would best support managing nonmilitary competition with China globally and bridging interagency divides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the models, many of these ideas need not take the form of entirely new four-star commands. Rather, new interagency joint task forces — including novel approaches like Joint Task Force Ares, used to combat the Islamic State and subordinate unified commands — offer flexible structures for managing a complex, multidomain, multi-instrument global competition. Even more radical would be using a congressional commission to explore rewriting key authorities and legal code linked to how the United States organizes for national defense and long-term competition. Regardless of what form the next UCP takes, the process of building it should ask hard questions and demand more than answers forged by bureaucratic path dependence, satisficing, and proponency. The world is too dangerous to avoid hard choices; just ask our large-language model.&lt;/p&gt;

As donor fatigue sets in and aid dwindles, stakeholders must grapple with how to address the country’s critical humanitarian needs without legitimizing the Taliban’s rule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan has largely disappeared from the news, but it remains at the center of one of the world’s most persistent, severe, and complex humanitarian crises. Almost three years after the Taliban retook power in August 2021, Afghanistan has achieved a moderate degree of stability but remains in a highly precarious position. Taliban leaders inherited tremendous macroeconomic problems when they assumed control of the country. Before the collapse of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, foreign aid was equivalent to 40 percent of the nation’s GDP and financed over half of the government’s $6 billion annual budget and 75 to 80 percent of total public expenditures. The sudden regime change was followed by the abrupt withdrawal of all international aid, plunging the country into economic free fall and precipitating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shock to Afghanistan’s economy was compounded by immediate diplomatic and financial isolation. Consistent with long-standing U.S. and UN sanctions against Taliban leaders, many of whom were named to key cabinet positions, the United States and Europe froze nearly $9.5 billion of Afghanistan’s external reserves, leaving the Afghan central bank, Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), deprived of assets and cut off from the global financial system. This resulted in an acute liquidity crisis, the cessation of normal financial transactions with foreign banks, and the immobilization of the country’s commercial banking sector. In order to protect some of the frozen funds from being claimed as damages by family members of September 11 victims, who had won a $7 billion default judgment against the Taliban in 2011, the Biden administration diverted $3.5 billion of these assets to establish the Swiss-based Fund for the Afghan People, or Afghan Fund, with the intention of using targeted disbursements to support Afghanistan’s macroeconomic and financial stability. As of 2024, however, the fund remains untapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multidimensional crises facing Afghanistan present a dilemma for the international community. An underlying assumption is that the Taliban will remain in power for at least the immediate future, which will require workarounds and tough compromises if the plight of Afghanistan’s people is to be alleviated to any degree. The large-scale influx of humanitarian aid since the end of 2021 has come largely in the form of physical shipments of U.S. dollars, delivered under the coordination of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to various UN agencies and UN-partnered international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) operating on the ground. The funds are used to pay staff salaries and procure food and supplies, including covering the costs of imports. As of this year, UN cash shipments remain a critical lifeline for an estimated 23.7 million people at risk in a nation of 41 million. The country’s modest degree of economic stabilization since 2021 is in large part owed to the weekly inflow of these donor funds, which have totaled more than $2.9 billion since the Taliban takeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although international assistance has prevented a further deterioration of conditions and helped stave off an even greater humanitarian disaster, the stability of the Afghan economy and the welfare of the Afghan people remain extremely tenuous. Afghanistan is one of the poorest and least developed nations in the world, ranked 182 out of 193 countries and territories on the Human Development Index. The initial economic collapse in 2021 has hardened into a state of chronic economic weakness: after weathering a 27 percent contraction in GDP between 2021 and 2023, the Afghan economy is now hovering in “no-growth territory,” propped up by foreign aid and highly vulnerable to shocks. According to the World Bank’s most recent Afghanistan Welfare Monitoring Survey, the unemployment rate among surveyed households was close to 20 percent as of April–June 2023, and there is “no reason to believe that more recent trends will be any better.” The loss of more than 700,000 jobs has been felt most acutely in Afghanistan’s cities, but Afghans in rural areas have been struggling to cope with floods, droughts, and earthquakes, as well as the devastating toll of the Taliban’s 2022 ban on the cultivation of opium poppy, Afghanistan’s most important agricultural product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Afghan population is also facing economy-wide price deflation, currency shortages, weakened purchasing power, outbreaks of disease, damage to critical infrastructure, and the deterioration of basic public services. Afghans have limited access to shelter, education, healthcare, electricity, food, clean water, and sanitation systems, and roughly 6.3 million are internally displaced — the second-highest number in the world after Syria. Reports for 2024 by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) estimate that 15.8 million Afghans are experiencing acute food insecurity, 22.1 million require protection assistance, and 8.7 million children need education support. Pakistan’s decision to expel an estimated 1.3 million Afghan refugees in late 2023 added to the country’s burden, as approximately 515,000 Afghans have reentered the country between September 2023 and February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s crackdown on individual freedoms — particularly those of women and girls — has worsened the countrywide crisis and interfered with the humanitarian response. The imposition of restrictions on female education, employment, dress, and freedom of movement and the segregation of men and women in public life have crippled humanitarian operations, obstructing access to essential services while raising the cost of their delivery. According to the 2023 annual U.S. Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Afghanistan, the Taliban regime’s restrictions extend to the exercise of free speech, the right to protest, and aspects of the Shia minority’s right to religious observance. Moreover, some former members of the Islamic Republic’s government and security forces have faced disappearance, imprisonment, and extrajudicial killings. Unmoved by sanctions or international pressure, the Taliban’s flagrant disregard for human rights poses a tremendous operational and moral challenge for donors and humanitarian actors, who struggle between providing lifesaving assistance despite the Taliban’s edicts or withholding funds and services in protest despite the impact on civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compounding these challenges is the rapid decline in international support for Afghanistan in the context of growing donor fatigue. As other global crises draw the attention of the donor community, the plight of Afghanistan is fading increasingly into the background despite the country’s enormous needs. OCHA’s 2023 Humanitarian Needs Response Plan (HNRP) sought an initial budget of $4.6 billion — its highest-ever humanitarian funding appeal for a single country. This figure was later scaled down to $3.2 billion, a reduction attributable not to improved conditions but to severe shortfalls in funding. The staggering funding gap for the 2023 HNRP — which fell $2.96 billion short of the original budget and $1.59 billion short of the revised budget — does not bode well for the 2024 HNRP’s $3.1 billion funding target. As human rights violations and corruption concerns have become harder to ignore, heavyweight donors including the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and the Asian Development Bank have begun to sour on aid commitments. In 2023, the United Kingdom cut its Afghan aid budget by 76 percent, while Germany slashed its contributions by 93 percent. Even the United States — which appropriated upward of $2.5 billion for assistance to Afghanistan between October 2021 and September 2023 — has reduced its financial support, which dropped from $1.26 billion in 2022 to $377 million in 2023. As of May 9, 2024, the 2024 HNRP is only 15.9 percent funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relations with Afghanistan are now at an impasse. The international community continues to resist deeper engagement due to mounting concerns about rights protection, adherence to international law, and financial transparency. Meanwhile, the Taliban continue to appeal for political, diplomatic, and economic normalization without showing any intention of addressing the issues of concern to foreign donors, instead “framing calls by Western leaders to uphold international norms as the latest episode in a long history of interference and intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central challenge is finding a politically palatable middle ground between two bleak alternatives — engaging with the Taliban to assist the Afghan people or isolating Afghanistan and abandoning its vulnerable population. Given that isolation has been tried in the past to little effect, many have urged the West to avoid falling back on old strategies, which are unlikely to move a “pariah regime” that has proved defiant in the face of international condemnation. As the United States and its allies attempt to find the right balance between support for the population and pressure on the regime, they have to temper their economic punishments for the Taliban’s “increasingly flagrant human rights abuses” to mitigate the suffering of the Afghan people and prevent the country from tipping closer to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The central challenge is finding a politically palatable middle ground between two bleak alternatives — engaging with the Taliban to assist the Afghan people or isolating Afghanistan and abandoning its vulnerable population.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a situation with no good options or easy decisions, the international community is struggling to find a viable path forward. There is a general consensus that ordinary Afghans should not be forgotten but that the current humanitarian-dominated assistance regime is unsustainable. If international aid is to continue and evolve as needed, there are five interrelated and overlapping issues that stakeholders will need to grapple with as they debate what form that aid should take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;promoting-the-rights-of-women-and-girls&quot;&gt;Promoting the Rights of Women and Girls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant barriers to large-scale international donor assistance for Afghanistan — and to shifting from humanitarian aid to development aid in particular — is the deteriorating circumstances of Afghan women and girls. To the extent that Afghanistan does appear in the news, it is because of the Taliban’s draconian applications of sharia law — which include barbaric punishments for “moral crimes,” such as public stoning for adultery — and the enactment of a harsh set of measures that oppress women and girls to a degree tolerated nowhere else on earth. Since 2021, the Taliban’s repressive policies have included prohibiting female education beyond the sixth grade, barring women from civil service and NGO work, mandating the wearing of burkas, and requiring that women be accompanied by a mahram (a male relative guardian) in public. These edicts are not only egregious human rights violations but also major hindrances to the country’s long-term socioeconomic development. Estimates suggest that the de facto exclusion of women from public life will exacerbate the country’s “brain drain” — the flight of educated Afghans — and cost Afghanistan’s economy up to 5 percent of its GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the international community is in unanimous agreement that Afghanistan’s economic development hinges on the reinstatement of women’s rights, donors and stakeholders have been divided over the implications of human rights concerns for the continuation and expansion of international assistance programs in the country. Women and girls have been disproportionately affected by Afghanistan’s economic collapse and Taliban rule in virtually every dimension, making women and girls especially reliant on the continued delivery of direct humanitarian assistance and small-scale, private-sector development projects. Significant numbers of Western donors and humanitarian actors temporarily ceased, paused, or scaled down their operations as a mark of outrage, and some continue to advocate stricter conditionalities for any future or additional aid. Others have argued that the threat of further isolation is not a pragmatic or moral approach to alleviating the humanitarian crisis and reducing the burden on Afghanistan’s women. As the Taliban have doubled down on gender-based discrimination, donor strategies have sought to prioritize women and girls in the provision of essential services and development assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As foreign cash flows decline and assistance programs begin to emphasize the mobilization of the local private sector to meet humanitarian needs, targeted development assistance could be a more crucial lifeline for women, who experience higher rates of unemployment, face greater operational challenges as business owners, and have more difficulty accessing humanitarian relief. Ongoing World Bank and USAID programs have centered women in many project activities, rolling out educational courses, skills development programs, and targeted microfinance plans for women. Donors have also supported efforts to leverage the digital economy to provide women with alternative means of economic empowerment, the scaling up of which will depend on investments in digital public infrastructure and digital literacy programs. All these initiatives risk running afoul of the Taliban authorities, who have reportedly refused to renew business licenses for female entrepreneurs and may yet impose new policy restrictions on women’s participation in economic activities. Humanitarian actors are ultimately forced to walk a fine line between flouting the regime’s policies and attempting to work within them. Although more defiant approaches may be too out of touch with political reality to be effective, more pragmatic proposals, such as incentivizing the employment of women in the private sector by providing funds for segregated office spaces, are controversial for their perceived accommodation of the Taliban’s restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no perfect options for protecting the rights and opportunities of women and girls in a context of humanitarian crisis and oppressive policies that UN officials have equated with “gender apartheid.” The international community must remain committed to supporting Afghan women and girls while recognizing that meaningful assistance will require a delicate balance of engagement, pressure, and humanitarian aid. Without progress on women’s rights and inclusion, the Taliban risk jeopardizing Western donors’ willingness to provide development assistance or eventual diplomatic recognition, both of which will be vital to Afghanistan’s ability to secure large-scale investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;right-sizing-un-cash-shipments-and-humanitarian-aid&quot;&gt;Right-Sizing UN Cash Shipments and Humanitarian Aid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With donor funds drying up, two particularly urgent, related concerns are (1) Afghanistan’s extreme reliance on foreign aid, which long predates the current humanitarian crisis, and (2) the issues associated with UN cash shipments, which were introduced as a temporary expedient but have persisted for well over two years. Worldwide, most humanitarian aid is intended as a temporary stopgap, allowing humanitarian actors to address the immediate needs of the population while buying time for more meaningful, long-term stabilization. Likewise, emergency cash shipments are not a lasting substitute for a functional banking sector and sustainable economic growth, and this form of aid financing is not normally allocated in ways that promote the development of effective governing institutions or the construction of the basic infrastructure needed to deliver healthcare, education, and vital human services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of Afghanistan, the problems associated with long-term foreign aid dependence are particularly acute — and given the severity of the present humanitarian crisis and the country’s enormous structural problems, the risk of inertia is inordinately high. Humanitarian interventions alone cannot improve the situation for affected Afghans, leaving the population stuck in a cycle of repeated, protracted crises. The constraints related to the sanctions regime and international isolation have only exacerbated the Afghan economy’s weakness and the population’s reliance on international assistance. At the same time, large-scale humanitarian aid has allowed the Taliban to abdicate their responsibility to meet the needs of the Afghan people, effectively outsourcing the country’s social safety net to UN agencies and a handful of other international NGOs. With respect to the use of cash shipments, the weekly inflow of $40 million may have initially relieved pressure on Afghanistan’s moribund banking sector, but the money now stands in the way of the financial system’s revival. Although cash shipments have helped stabilize the local currency, an additional consequence is the Taliban regime’s accumulation of a large supply of U.S. dollars. The ban on the use of U.S. dollars in local transactions has required humanitarian agencies to exchange dollars for afghanis to fund their operations; because the local currency is in short supply, this has resulted in many private banks using UN-supplied dollars to purchase afghanis from the Taliban-controlled DAB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For donors, the risks, costs, and inefficiencies associated with regular cash shipments have become intolerable as a long-term assistance strategy — not least because the shipments can give the problematic appearance of “paying the Taliban,” undermining international statements of principles. This approach to aid financing incurs “substantial costs at every stage of the process,” including the conversion of European currencies into U.S. dollars, air shipment costs, security costs, bank fees, administrative overheads, and so on. Donors also have limited visibility over the administration and deployment of UN funds; with no reliable government structures in place, UN estimates of humanitarian needs have been issued without sufficient public accounting of the sources of data or the effectiveness, reliability, or presence of third-party monitoring and verification. Most UN assessments “grossly oversimplify” the population’s needs and the allocation of donor funds, providing an aggregate figure for the entire nation that fails to capture the enormous variations in need by area, demographic, and economic sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although UN agencies may be inclined to maintain the status quo for reasons of convenience, stakeholders are beginning to disfavor the use of cash shipments as the primary mode of aid financing. All donors have an interest in mitigating risks, countering waste, and avoiding the negative optics associated with the Taliban regime indirectly benefiting from foreign aid flows. However, while many are beginning to endorse the use of digital cash transfers and monitored private bank transactions, wariness of the sanctions regime and long-standing concerns about the security of the Afghan banking sector, notably the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing, may still obstruct more practical approaches to delivering aid funds. As donors become more opposed to cash shipments and less generous in their aid commitments, the failure to find alternative financing may grind humanitarian operations to a halt at great expense to the population. Despite reasonable concerns about foreign assistance relieving pressure on the state to the Taliban’s benefit, that group’s reliance on aid to avoid its duties does not mean that it would prioritize the welfare of the Afghan people if the money were withdrawn. Meanwhile, UN and NGO officials have emphasized that the population’s needs have reached a scale beyond what aid agencies alone are capable of managing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;All donors have an interest in mitigating risks, countering waste, and avoiding the negative optics associated with the Taliban regime indirectly benefiting from foreign aid flows.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to these issues, some have urged a move away from “humanitarian business as usual,” with the goal of phasing out cash shipments on a gradual and predictable basis, retooling large-scale foreign humanitarian aid, and replacing the current model of foreign support with more traditional development assistance geared to increase the Afghan economy’s self-sufficiency. Humanitarian aid funds are dwindling at an alarming rate, falling from $3.8 billion in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2023, “with further declines expected in 2024.” Moving forward, international assistance strategies must find a way to both smooth the macroeconomic impact of declining aid and deploy increasingly limited resources in a more targeted and cost-effective way. This could include improving coordination between agencies, reducing the size of UN administrative overheads, making more use of the Afghan private sector for aid delivery, and prioritizing basic healthcare and food assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;promoting-financial-transparency&quot;&gt;Promoting Financial Transparency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Western donors assess how to gradually scale down cash shipments and shift to more basic development aid, a related consideration is the problem of financial transparency, which pertains to both suspected “leakages” of foreign aid funds and the black box of the Taliban budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the scope of humanitarian needs and the level of foreign aid being channeled into the country, the misappropriation of aid funds has been a consistent concern among donor governments. Humanitarian operations have not been exempt from Taliban interference, as is the case in any country receiving large amounts of such aid. According to a January 2024 report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), the Taliban have siphoned or benefited from a considerable amount of humanitarian aid. Reported tactics include infiltrating UN-partnered NGOs to access their aid budgets; imposing taxes and “security” fees on humanitarian workers; directing aid agencies to serve Taliban officials and family members; and taxing Afghan aid recipients at high rates, in some cases amounting to 60 to 100 percent of the aid received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Taliban regime exaggerates the success of its anticorruption measures, its high-profile campaign claiming to eliminate the corruption that plagued the Islamic Republic government has resulted in some notable improvements. The tightening of border and customs controls has allowed for more aggressive taxation of imports and stricter regulation of the country’s vast informal economy. These measures and the dismantling of many unofficial road checkpoints — notorious sites of extortion in the Islamic Republic, used by both insurgents and state police — are “consistent with reports from Afghan traders” about the decline in corruption. Nonetheless, other reports have highlighted the persistence of illicit economies, including drug and arms trafficking, the regime’s financial linkages with al Qaeda affiliates, and the capture of state resources by Taliban leaders, who have continued previous governments’ practices of relying on patronage networks to maintain their authority. According to a February 2024 study, the Taliban regime can be termed a theocratic authoritarian “kleptocracy” due to its use of public funds, diverted humanitarian assistance, informal and illicit profits, and extensive taxation network to consolidate control over the country’s resources for the use of Taliban leaders and their cadres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite recent efforts to demonstrate fiscal responsibility, the Taliban regime ultimately lacks any meaningful or structural financial transparency — particularly in the area of expenditures. There is no public accounting of what the regime spends on its security forces, intelligence apparatus, and prisons vis-à-vis public services such as food, healthcare, and education. Nor are there criteria for awarding government contracts, property sales, or licenses, and the lack of external accountability mechanisms prevents transparency in procurement. The World Bank reported that the government raised $2.2 billion in revenue in 2022, 60 percent of which is estimated to have been generated through aggressive tax and customs collection, achieved in part through violence, harassment, and the threat of license suspensions and asset seizures. The World Bank’s Afghanistan Development Update reported that the government raised $2.9 billion in revenue in 2023 — a 9 percent increase from the previous year but not necessarily indicative of long-term fiscal sustainability. The primary sources of revenue growth were increases in import volume and associated border tax revenues, which may only exacerbate Afghanistan’s dependence on imports at the expense of domestic economic growth, as well as one-time nontax revenues, such as vehicle registration fees, passport issuances, and royalties, which are not reliable sources of recurring incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside more pressing concerns about Taliban gender policies and human rights violations, reports of state kleptocracy and concerns about fiscal transparency are also threats to both the continued flow of international humanitarian aid and the prospect of future development projects. Major stakeholders need assurances against the duplication of spending and the misappropriation of funds, which depend on oversight mechanisms including audits and impact assessments. The reputational risks associated with documented aid leakages to the Taliban — particularly alongside evidence of Taliban linkages with terrorist organizations — also jeopardize foreign cash inflows. Allegations of aid diversion in various SIGAR reports prompted U.S. senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) to introduce a bill in March to withhold all U.S. funding for UNAMA pending assurances that U.S. taxpayer dollars are not funding the Taliban and — by extension — terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short of suspending aid funding for Afghanistan, the international community has few options for resolving either issue. Some current forms of aid embezzlement can be mitigated with more secure financial transfers and more robust third-party monitoring, but Western donors’ ability to pressure Kabul on its fiscal transparency is more limited. The scale of tax revenues and the regime’s evident disregard for the well-being of Afghan citizens have helped insulate the Taliban from the traditional methods by which rogue regimes are subjected to international pressure, namely sanctions and isolation. Given the shortcomings of the current approach, stakeholders must get more creative and pragmatic. A certain level of contact with governing authorities is unavoidable — rather than making aid flows contingent on total insulation from the Taliban, donors have to assess what level of “spillage” can be tolerated in exchange for economic and humanitarian progress while also tightening the delivery, allocation, and management of aid. In terms of exploring economic development strategies, donors must incentivize the Taliban authorities to be more transparent, particularly about the proportion of spending on their security apparatus versus on the social and humanitarian needs of the population. The Taliban administration’s demonstrated interest in pursuing infrastructure projects and attracting foreign investment indicates that the regime is committed to developing the Afghan economy. But ambitious development projects are unlikely to come to fruition through opaque deals that circumvent international standards and bear hidden risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;import-substitution-and-private-sector-development&quot;&gt;Import Substitution and Private-Sector Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As direct cash transfers and humanitarian aid are scaled down, complementary engagement and investment in Afghanistan’s economy must be scaled up. Reviving Afghanistan’s private sector and enhancing local economic resilience will be critical for the country’s economic stability and long-term recovery in the absence of regular cash flows and humanitarian assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan’s current economic state is the result of a lethal combination of long-term dysfunction and acute crisis. Decades of conflict and large international aid inflows have trapped the country in a state of chronic underdevelopment, leaving the economy heavily dependent on a huge basket of imports that are affordable only through external support. The Afghan financial system never fully recovered from the 2010–11 near collapse of the Kabul Bank — “at the time a critically important institution in Afghanistan’s banking system” — following revelations of massive fraud and embezzlement. Endemic corruption and persistent instability have also made for a hostile business climate and a weak private sector, made even weaker by the recent liquidity crunch. According to the World Bank’s 2023 Private Sector Rapid Survey, roughly half of Afghanistan’s businesses are struggling to operate at full capacity, and most cite disruptions in financial services as their main constraint. The country’s financial paralysis stems in part from widespread misconceptions about the scope of the sanctions regime, resulting in overcompliance and other de-risking measures at the expense of business activity, commercial financing, and cross-border trade. Barriers to economic growth have been exacerbated by the Taliban’s regressive policies and economic missteps, which include prohibitive restrictions on women in the workforce, an “unguided and mandatory shift to Islamic banking,” a burdensome taxation regime that stifles entrepreneurial incentives, and the ban on opium poppies, costing rural households over $1 billion in annual income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circumstances are unlikely to change significantly in the short term, but there are several things that donors can do to mitigate the severity of the economic crisis while minimizing contact with the Taliban. One recommendation is for donors to promote import substitution, which would entail revving up domestic production to capture key import markets, with the ultimate objective of creating jobs, increasing economic resilience, and improving Afghanistan’s balance of trade in areas where competitive advantages exist. Afghanistan currently relies on foreign aid to import a wide range of goods — worth approximately $6 billion to $8 billion per year — that can instead be produced domestically, including food, textiles, cement, and hydrocarbons. By emphasizing local procurement, the United Nations and donor aid agencies can reduce aid costs and reorient a core aspect of the humanitarian response around the development of Afghanistan’s own resources and private sector. Significantly, the Taliban regime appears to recognize the importance of import substitution, having contracted three sizable cement projects — two with Afghan companies and one with a Qatari investor — to break Afghanistan’s costly reliance on neighboring countries for a product that may ultimately have export potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jump-starting private-sector development will require more concerted efforts to clarify the parameters of the sanctions regime. There are no comprehensive sanctions in place against the country of Afghanistan — instead, the United Nations and the United States have imposed targeted sanctions against a number of individuals and organizations. The UN Security Council Resolution 2615 and the U.S. General License 20, which were issued in order to facilitate normal aid-related and commercial financial transactions, explicitly state that current sanctions exempt humanitarian activities and permit most commercial and financial transactions. These include the payment of taxes and fees to government agencies, which are not sanctioned as institutions even if they are led by sanctioned individuals. Despite this, the attitudes of most U.S. and other Western banks toward financial transactions involving Afghanistan have not changed. Clearer sanctions guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department in areas in which confusion persists can help ensure that the Afghan private sector as well as Western and regional firms and banks are aware of the exemptions and safeguards that allow for continued trade and commercial activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting the revival of Afghanistan’s banking sector is equally critical for ensuring smooth payments to facilitate trade, aid, remittances, and financing. Moving away from UN cash shipments will offer an opportunity to further develop and expand alternative payment methods as well as strengthen Afghan banks and their international connections, but this shift will depend on fostering greater trust in Afghanistan’s financial system. The resumption of normal financial transactions will require increases in third-party monitoring to ensure compliance with internationally recognized Anti–Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) standards and policies. Given that DAB lacks the institutional capacity and political autonomy necessary to credibly monitor financial transactions, either the World Bank or a qualified private accounting firm commissioned by the Afghan Fund could provide AML/CFT oversight in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of increased engagement from the World Bank, the revival of the banking sector could also enable more direct support to vetted Afghan businesses through microfinancing plans and other innovative financing tools, which can be used to promote import substitution and increase exports. The Afghan Fund might also be mobilized to that end — a portion of its funds could be diverted to some of Afghanistan’s private commercial banks to provide liquidity for private-sector lending and financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-world-bank-and-development-assistance&quot;&gt;The World Bank and Development Assistance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, the World Bank Board of Executive Directors endorsed a revision of the bank’s approach to assisting the people of Afghanistan, taking the first significant steps toward a development-based international assistance strategy since the 2022 suspension of previous projects. The bank’s “Approach 3.0” will deploy funds from the International Development Association through grants to UN agencies and NGOs to finance private-sector activities, boost employment opportunities, and facilitate private-sector participation in aid delivery. The board also gave the green light for direct engagement with senior officials at Afghan economic institutions, enhancing the bank’s ability to produce technical assessments, provide rigorous third-party monitoring, engage in knowledge sharing, and potentially open dialogues on macroeconomic policy and fiscal management. Most notable is the revival of the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000) after a two-year suspension. The $1.2 billion regional infrastructure project, undertaken in collaboration with the publicly owned Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherikat (DABS), will transport clean energy “between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan and from Tajikistan to Pakistan and Afghanistan.” The project’s “ring-fenced” funding will ensure that payments and revenues are managed beyond the control of Taliban authorities. Although there were many reasons why this particular project was the first to be revived, CASA-1000 could be a trial balloon for future Western-backed development projects. Given the enormous gaps in Afghanistan’s critical infrastructure and the total paralysis of its financial system, the direct involvement of a credible, trusted international financial institution such as the World Bank is essential to restoring trust in the banking sector and removing barriers to development financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The erosion of foreign aid has underscored the urgency of resuming development assistance, and there has been a growing international consensus on the necessity of increased engagement. Nonetheless, the bank’s decision to engage in development projects without attaching political conditionalities on Taliban authorities — a consequence of barring direct technical assistance or support to sanctioned individuals and entities — may raise political concerns about inadvertently legitimizing or strengthening the Taliban’s rule and reducing the international community’s leverage to push for reforms. A number of international actors and former Afghan officials supported the previous suspension of development projects as a way to hold the regime accountable for its objectionable policies. Some, including politicians in donor countries wary of the optics of “working with the Taliban,” may be similarly apprehensive that the resumption of development assistance in the context of recent Taliban policies against women could convey a message of impunity, making the regime less receptive to concessions on human rights, political reforms, and financial transparency. In light of the Taliban’s current human rights record, which has withstood immense international pressure, those in favor of increasing engagement have argued that the welfare of the population cannot be held hostage to an unlikely moderation in Taliban policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approach 3.0 represents a carefully calibrated strategy that reckons with the challenges of the current political reality and balances the pressing needs of the Afghan people with the long-term goal of promoting inclusive growth and social change in Afghanistan. Circumstances in Afghanistan call for greater nuance than is typically possible at the international level; navigating this difficult landscape requires the international community to leverage the flexibility of the sanctions regime to promote sustainable economic development through a policy of principled, limited engagement. This approach must prioritize initiatives that directly benefit the Afghan population while maintaining pressure on the Taliban to improve their human rights record, embrace political reforms, and enhance financial transparency. By undertaking projects such as CASA-1000, which has the potential to enhance regional connectivity and stimulate economic growth, the international community can demonstrate its commitment to the welfare of the Afghan people while avoiding actions that would signal a normalization of diplomatic and economic relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This approach must prioritize initiatives that directly benefit the Afghan population while maintaining pressure on the Taliban to improve their human rights record, embrace political reforms, and enhance financial transparency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of Approach 3.0, there is ongoing interest by China and other regional nations in investment in the country. Afghanistan possesses a wealth of largely untapped petroleum deposits and mineral reserves that have become the focus of Taliban aspirations for economic self-sufficiency. Taliban leaders have been courting foreign investors for a variety of mining, irrigation, and infrastructure projects, recently announcing their intention to join China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Deepening ties with China include a $540 million contract with the Xinjiang Central Asia Petroleum and Gas Company for oil and gas exploration, in addition to interest from other Chinese firms in mineral extraction, power generation, cement production, and digital public infrastructure projects. Although any prospective foreign investments would help address cash flow shortages, the intervention of authoritarian actors raises serious concerns about the country’s development trajectory. Given the Taliban’s pursuit of economic growth through raw mineral exports, the absence of accountability, supervision, community engagement, and independent oversight could result in asymmetric development that primarily advantages Taliban leaders, prevents the broader society from benefiting from the country’s natural resources, and further insulates the regime from human rights–related pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign donors, civil society actors, Afghanistan stakeholders, UN officials, and Afghanistan’s neighbors have found themselves at odds over how to move forward in Afghanistan. Some are urging the international community to hold a firm, consistent line on human rights and refuse to engage with the Taliban on moral grounds. Others are emphasizing the severity of the humanitarian crisis and calling for a pragmatic, phased approach to engagement in order to ensure the continued delivery of essential services and remove some of the obstacles preventing progress on sustainable socioeconomic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan’s long-term economic development will ultimately require political and policy choices that the Taliban appear unwilling to make. No country can move up the development ladder if 50 percent of the population is categorically excluded from public life — but the Taliban’s track record and ideological zeal suggest that the regime is unlikely to moderate its policies against women in the near term. Enhancing Afghanistan’s economic self-sufficiency, then, will hinge on the question of when and how international actors can better address the needs of the population without providing an impermissible level of support — however indirectly — to the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Afghan people need long-term sustainable solutions that include not only increased humanitarian assistance but also greater economic stability, the resumption of international development assistance, and a viable private sector–led economy. With the welfare of ordinary Afghans on the line, stakeholders will have to reckon with what imperfect options remain if both engagement and disengagement are deemed unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

The UN Security Council is frozen by geopolitical rivalry and two wars. Other institutions such as the G20 and World Trade Organization (WTO) are underperforming.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Time does not allow for building a new governance institution — but requires the “bending” of existing ones to meet the moment. This CSIS report speaks to the global need to elevate the Group of Seven (G7), a bloc of industrialized democracies — the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union — to foster a more stable and predictable world order. The report offers recommendations on reimagining the future G7 as a critical institution of global governance, focused on agenda setting, institutionalization, and membership of the body.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the last half-decade, G7 leadership summits have identified nine global priorities: (1) the Indo-Pacific; (2) economic resilience and security; (3) food security; (4) digital competitiveness; (5) climate; (6) Ukraine; (7) sustainable development; (8) disarmament and non-proliferation; and (9) labor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The G7’s scope has expanded, but its representation of the global economy and population has declined, highlighting the need for reform to enhance capabilities and legitimacy without sacrificing the G7’s trademark informality, trust, and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The G7 should create an informal “troika” of the previous, current, and next G7 hosts to manage a consensus-based approach to agenda setting. This ensures consistency and follow-through on issues from one host to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The G7 should expand membership to include Australia and South Korea. They bring significant capabilities to the nine priorities identified by G7 leaders, are like-minded partners, and display the trust and reliability required of G7 members. These two countries perform as well, if not better than, current G7 members in the nine priority issue areas. They also address Europe’s overrepresentation and Asia’s severe underrepresentation in the group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The G7 might recognize other high-performing actors (e.g., Spain) as dialogue partners or associate members. The G7 should also consider consolidation of the European Council and European Commission into one seat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The G7 should establish a formal leader-level outreach mechanism to the Global South and middle-power economies to demonstrate inclusivity and confer legitimacy on the body as a global governance institution. The outreach partners should include the African Union, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, the G20, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the current G7, a decade old in its practices and membership, has performed admirably, the pace of change engendered by new disruptive technologies and old geopolitical rivalries now requires innovation beyond comfort for some. Inaction precipitates a vacuum that may be filled with forms of rule that are less desirable and even dangerous. The recommendations contained in this report are necessary pre-requisites for the incarnation of tomorrow’s G7 global governance mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-world-in-turmoil&quot;&gt;A WORLD IN TURMOIL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time of global turmoil when traditional institutions of global governance are underperforming, the Group of Seven (G7), a bloc of industrialized democracies which includes the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, is needed now more than ever to foster a more stable and predictable world order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This CSIS report offers recommendations to empower a future G7 as a critical institution of global governance. The work presented here is a non-partisan and collaborative effort of CSIS expertise on Asia, Europe, sustainable development, and economics. The authors sought advice and critical input from almost three dozen former G7 point persons — so-called sherpas, sous-sherpas, and yaks — and representatives of the G7, European, and Asian diplomatic communities. This report does not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of these participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international system is changing at a pace not seen since the end of World War II. In the geostrategic space, wars in Europe and the Middle East, cohesion among a bloc of autocratic powers, and heightened proliferation threaten a new Cold War and pose major challenges to the peaceful status quo. At the same time, emerging and critical global issues such as artificial intelligence (AI), resilient supply chains, advances in synthetic biology, pandemic preparedness, and sustainable development demand new standards and norms, as well as cooperative and sustained action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current architecture of global governance is ill-suited to meet these challenges and opportunities. The United Nations, particularly the UN Security Council (UNSC), has failed to address human rights abuses, anti-democratic behavior, and aggression globally. The G20, once a stabilizing force that helped address the 1997 Asian liquidity crisis and the 2007–08 global financial crisis, is now hamstrung by geopolitical rivalry. The WTO, established to uphold rules and norms for the global trading system, has expanded membership to more than 160 countries, making it difficult to make decisions or enact the reforms necessary to regulate the current trade landscape. Changes in the operative space of the international system have led large emerging and middle powers to organize a proliferation of ad hoc groupings, including the Quad, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, AUKUS, U.S.-Japan-Korea trilateralism, and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Others, such as the BRICS partnerships, are also growing in membership and seeking to diminish their dependency on the U.S. dollar. Likewise, the G20 has welcomed the African Union to its ranks. Though these minilaterals allow new forums for marginalized voices, they are not yet in a position to set new rules of the road or replace institutions such as the UNSC or WTO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with these potentially existential issues will require a level of trust and capability, as well as a track record of working together. It will take real conversations among leaders, not a set of talking points or a lowest-common-denominator joint statement to produce solutions that are lacking in these larger groupings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to devise a new institution would take decades, with no promise of success. The current pace of change in world affairs requires a “bending” of existing institutions to meet the challenges of global governance. As a grouping of like-minded, advanced industrialized democracies, the G7 is the only institution today that can step into this role. But this requires a reimagination of the G7 not of the past two decades but of the next two, that can find solutions to global problems, capitalize on future opportunities, and engage with critical voices from emerging and middle-power economies. This report offers recommendations focused on agenda setting, institutionalization, and membership of the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-global-role-of-the-g7&quot;&gt;THE GLOBAL ROLE OF THE G7&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G7 leaders have come a long way since their initial gathering in 1975 to address the oil shock and to coordinate monetary policies. In the past few years, the G7 leaders’ statements have taken on a more urgent, expansive, and unified tone as the world has grappled with a range of existential issues, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, multiple financial crises, climate change, supply chain resilience, and wars in Ukraine and Gaza. In the past few years, it has become clear that the significant global challenges today have created demands for the G7 to actively execute across its expansive domain of responsibilities. Table 1 lists the top nine global priority issues of the G7 leaders over the past half-decade, derived from text analysis of G7 leaders’ statements between 2018 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no denying that G7 leaders are willing to shoulder global responsibilities to meet the demands of a new era. Yet at the same time, the G7 commands a smaller portion of the global constituency. Even as the G7’s agenda has grown global, its representation as a share of the world’s population and global economy has declined over time, raising questions about its legitimacy outside of advanced industrialized democracies. At the same time, global challenges highlight the need for other capable countries to step up and help shoulder the burden of an expanded agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This confluence of necessities — the need for the G7’s expanded scope, the need for effective institutions of global governance on the international stage, and the need for more inclusive representation of actors to manage the global challenges ranging from war to pandemics to the AI race — requires the G7 to “bend” and embrace a set of reforms to meet the moment. Reform and reimagination of the G7 will have to be done in a way to maintain the pieces that make it an effective and special grouping but allow it to effectuate its expanded scope and be an effective leadership organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-1&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATION 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;create-a-consensus-based-approach-for-g7-agenda-setting&quot;&gt;Create a Consensus-Based Approach for G7 Agenda Setting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the G7 has been an informal grouping. Former sherpas praise the informality as contributing to the grouping’s flexibility, nimbleness, frank consultative process, and ability to act quickly on issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside, however, is that informality leads to inefficiency around agenda setting and discontinuity from presidency to presidency. For example, the 2023 Hiroshima G7 statement laid out an ambitious global agenda for member countries ranging from AI norms to cyber defenses to economic security, but the agenda for the 2024 Apulia G7 meeting, chaired by Italy, largely ignored these issues and has turned to migration from North Africa. While both sets of issues are important, the discontinuity in the agenda-setting function is suboptimal. It conveys confusing signals to the international community, precipitates a lack of follow-through, and exacerbates a lack of oversight on announced commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create an informal “troika” of past, current, and upcoming G7 hosts to complement the work of individual country secretariats.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While respecting the privilege of the host country to shape the annual agenda, the informal troika’s main focus would be to ensure the continuity of core issues, including economic security, emerging technology, China, and Ukraine. These issues may change over time as they are resolved or as new challenges arise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build a task force structure for key, pressing issues to ensure continuity and follow-through.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Task force-like structures, in the form of working groups, expert groups, and other such forums, already exist within the G7, but these could be repurposed in a way to ensure (1) completion of commitments from previous G7 presidencies; and (2) the tracking of agenda items for follow-on work in the next G7 presidency. Since approximately 2010, the G7 has had in place a mechanism to track accountability for G7 commitments to global development, but no such mechanism to track accountability for other political and economic commitments exists. This could be accomplished through explicit task forces, which could change focus and composition as needed. For example, G7 governments could explicitly agree to sunset task forces after a set number of years, and G7 members could also introduce new task forces to address emerging challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider a bifurcated agenda process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This process would include two to three items that are core interests to the greater G7 and one to two items of critical importance to the host. The agenda could be determined by the G7 “troika” — consisting of the current G7 president alongside the countries holding the most recent and the upcoming G7 presidency — with input from other G7 countries through existing consultation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-2&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATION 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;expand-the-g7-to-include-australia-and-south-korea&quot;&gt;Expand the G7 to Include Australia and South Korea&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current composition of the G7, now a decade old, represents a declining portion of the world’s population and global economy. Moreover, changes in the G7’s membership have been part of the organization’s identity as it has evolved over time to meet different challenges (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing membership is not without controversy. Some former sherpas see it as a potential slippery slope where the G7’s effectiveness is sacrificed for the desire for greater inclusiveness and representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two factors, however, weigh in favor of expansion. First, the extent to which the G7 members have enlarged the scope of their responsibilities requires new players with critical capabilities to fulfill the mission. Second, the G7’s current membership is disproportionately dominated by Europe (six out of nine seats, including the European Council and European Commission); has only one country to represent the whole of Asia; and excludes any voice representing the developing world. This composition is ill-suited for a reimagined G7 to play the role of the preeminent institution of global governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and South Korea fall in the “sweet spot” of expanded G7 membership and enhanced effectiveness. Former sherpas argued that any new members must support the G7’s mission, share its political values, be responsible stewards of the international economy, and have the capabilities, commitment, and, importantly, the trust of the other G7 members. Australia and South Korea, respectively the 12th- and 13th-largest economies in the world, easily meet this bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trust and Responsibility: Both Australia and South Korea have demonstrated records as trustworthy and responsible public goods providers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The two U.S. allies have fought on the side of democracy and a rules-based order in every major war since World War I and the Korean War, respectively. They have been exemplary leaders in contending with challenges that preoccupy the G7 leaders. Today, Australia has stood up like no other to unfair economic coercion by China, and it is instrumental to the critical mineral resiliency of the industrialized democracies. South Korea is a major provider of economic and indirect military assistance to Ukraine, and it is a critical player in protecting emerging technology supply chains. Both have demonstrated a leadership role in a host of global issues prioritized by the G7 (Figure 4). Both have been constructive members of the G20, demonstrating strong cooperation with the United States across administrations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Performance: Australia and South Korea are outperforming some current G7 members in areas deemed critical to G7 leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Former sherpas noted that any new members must enhance, not detract from, the effectiveness of the G7. At the outset of the G4/5, the original members had outsized influence and economic prowess, but that is not the case today. New members should be more representative of the type of advanced and industrialized economies of the future to be fit to deal with those challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Figures 5 and 6 show how Australia and South Korea are outperforming several current members on the nine priorities identified by the G7 over the last half-decade of leaders’ statements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Representation and Values: Australia and South Korea “balance out” the non-European composition of industrialized democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A reimagined G7 should be more representative of the world as it is and will be, not as it was. The current G7 is Eurocentric and has only one Asian nation representing the entire region. As Figure 2 shows, and as suggested in the performance criteria, the G7’s share of the world economy and population is declining, calling into question how its members could speak for markets larger than them in terms of GDP or population size. Australia and South Korea would bring representation for two advanced countries in the Indo-Pacific region, with the latter demonstrating significant advancements in the economies of the future, including computing, AI, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Recognize other high-performing actors.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The metrics in Figure 6 show that other European countries, such as Spain, perform respectably in the nine priority areas identified by G7 leaders and could be considered as regular dialogue partners. The G7 should consolidate representation from the European Council and European Commission, which now occupy two seats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-3&quot;&gt;RECOMMENDATION 3&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;establish-a-formal-g7-outreach-mechanism&quot;&gt;Establish a Formal G7 Outreach Mechanism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any expansion of the G7, whether to a G9 or beyond, will be met with staunch criticism by some within and outside of the body. Outreach to the so-called Global South, and emerging and middle-power economies, is necessary if a reimagined G7 were to truly fulfill the role of becoming the preeminent global governance institution. The tradition of consultation with developing countries might be institutionalized as an official consultation by the annual G7 president and foreign or finance ministers, as well as both before and after the convening of the leaders’ meeting. This would ensure linkages with developing economies, demonstrate inclusivity, and confer more credibility and legitimacy on the G7. The issue areas in the near term should focus on pursuing development and climate goals, implementing new norms and standards (e.g., AI and emerging technologies), and strategic signaling and shaping, particularly with respect to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. This outreach should be extended to the African Union, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, the G20, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These organizations and countries represent voices from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Islamic world, ensuring better communication but also limiting the size of the G7 to ensure the optimal equilibrium in maintaining the G7’s effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of disruption brought on by new emerging technologies as well as old geopolitical rivalries and territorial aggression presages that the world of tomorrow will not look like the world of today. Current institutions have proven incapable of carving out a path forward that capitalizes on the opportunities created by disruption and also guards against the erosion or even usurping of the core values, norms, and ethics of the rules-based order established after World War II. A confluence of forces has made it incumbent upon a reimagined G7 to fill the leadership void. While the current G7, now a decade old in its practices and membership, has performed admirably, the pace of change now cresting requires innovation beyond what may seem comfortable to some. Inaction, moreover, precipitates a vacuum that others may seek to fill with less desirable and even dangerous forms of rule. The recommendations contained in this report are by no means comprehensive, but they are necessary prerequisites for the incarnation of tomorrow’s G7 as the preeminent institution of global governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the attempts of the West and especially the US to avoid further escalation in the Russo-Ukrainian war, Russia is not going to abandon its original plans to destroy Ukraine and is making all possible efforts to achieve this goal. Even colossal losses in personnel and military equipment have not forced Moscow to abandon its goal (as of May 2024, Russian losses amounted to over 500,000 servicemen, over 7,000 tanks, over 14,000 armoured combat vehicles, over 13,000 artillery systems, hundreds of aircraft and helicopters, and dozens of warships). The number of Russian troops located on the territory of Ukraine has increased from 140,000 that participated in the invasion in February 2022 to almost 650,000, with over 2,500 tanks, over 5,000 armoured combat vehicles, and over 3,500 artillery systems. This figure does not include Russian units carrying out aggression against Ukraine from the territory of Russia itself, in particular from the territory of the Bryansk and Belgorod regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current operation against Kharkiv alone, which was launched by the Russians in May 2024, about 50,000 troops are involved. Fortunately, the Russian operation has not yet been very successful, and has already turned into another large battle for a small Ukrainian town, this time the town of Vovchansk, which is located on the border with Russia. Even so, an attempted new offensive against Kharkiv – Ukraine’s second-largest city with a population of over 1.4 million, located only 30 km from the Russian border – and a possible attack on Sumy, another regional centre 20 km from the border, is undoubtedly a significant escalation, and requires a rethinking of approaches to the war with Russia, both for Ukraine and its allies. Trying to win a war with Russia at the expense of only a symmetrical mass increase is a flawed strategy, given that Russia has a larger number of human reserves (about 30 million people in Russia, compared to about 8 million people in Ukraine), significant stockpiles of weapons and military equipment inherited from the USSR or built by 2022, as well as a developed defence-industrial complex and a powerful mining industry that satisfies its needs for a significant amount of strategic materials. Undoubtedly, Russian models are inferior to Western ones in quality, but Russia is clearly winning the competition with the West in the mass and cheap production of weapons and military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In such a situation, when achieving a simple numerical advantage over the enemy is impossible, the main priority of the joint efforts of Ukraine and its international partners should be to increase the military effectiveness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). Full military effectiveness in this context should be understood as the ability to achieve maximum combat power at the expense of resources that are available not only physically, but also politically, and so it is important to focus not only on tactical and operational effectiveness, but also strategic and political effectiveness. Combat power, in turn, is the ability to inflict damage on the enemy in the amount necessary to achieve the goals of the war, while at the same time limiting the damage that the enemy can inflict in response. To assess the current state of the military effectiveness of the AFU, the methodology proposed by Allan Millet, Williamson Murray and Kenneth Watman in 1986 – if adapted to today’s conditions – remains extremely helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia’s latest offensive against Kharkiv is undoubtedly a significant escalation, and requires a rethinking of approaches to the war both for Ukraine and its allies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political effectiveness of a military organisation consists of its ability to receive financial support, the provision of weapons and military equipment, and the replenishment of human forces in the volume and quality necessary to eliminate existing threats. For the AFU, this means first of all the ability to convince Ukraine’s international partners both to increase military-technical assistance and to lift restrictions on the supply of certain weapons to Ukraine, as well as restrictions on how they can be used. The political effectiveness of the AFU remains insufficient, as Ukraine’s defence needs are currently only partially met. Since decisions on increasing aid and increasing investment in the defence industry are made by the political leadership of partner countries, which mostly do not have professional military expertise, it is extremely important to involve representatives of the armed forces of these countries in the assessment of Ukraine’s needs in order to confirm the validity of such requests. At the same time, the provision of Ukraine’s defence needs cannot depend exclusively on Western aid. Increasing the political effectiveness of the AFU requires the Ukrainian military to convince the government of Ukraine of the need for unpopular decisions related to mobilisation, as well as searching for new ways of obtaining weapons that would involve direct financial obligations on Ukraine’s part, such as, for example, lend-lease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic effectiveness of a military organisation comprises its ability to achieve national goals determined by the political leadership through the use of military force. The calculation of the necessary resources also depends on these goals. The AFU are in an extremely difficult situation, as the political leaderships of both Ukraine and its partner countries see these goals in different ways, which negatively affects the ability of the AFU to develop and implement a military strategy aimed at achieving them. The leadership of Ukraine aims to liberate the country’s entire territory. Such a goal is undeniably fair and rational, but it ignores the fact that the liberation of territory does not necessarily mean the end of the war. Since neither Ukraine nor its partners are aiming for the complete defeat and occupation of Russia, even after the liberation of all of Ukraine’s territories, Russia will retain the ability to continue aggression against Ukraine, to conduct military operations from its territory, and to launch missile and bomb attacks on civilian infrastructure. The political leadership of Ukraine’s partner countries, in particular the US, ideally wants to force Russia into negotiations, at which point a decision will be made to end hostilities, but the issue of the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of Ukraine will not be discussed. Such a goal, despite the fact that it seems more achievable, also does not create the conditions for long-term peace, and will be viewed by Russia as a tactical respite which can be used to restore and build capabilities and plan a new phase of aggression, as was the case with the Minsk agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obvious that ending the war with Russia requires reaching such a moment when the aggressor has no ability or desire to continue it and is forced to withdraw troops from the territory of Ukraine with or without concluding a new peace agreement (as happened with the US in Vietnam in 1972 , or with the Soviet Union in Central Europe in the early 1990s). Accordingly, bringing Russia to a state of inability/unwillingness to continue the war should be the basis of a grand strategy that encompasses all means available to Ukraine and its partners, including non-military ones. The military strategy, as the most important part of the grand strategy, should in turn be aimed at inflicting unacceptable damage on Russia through the use of the AFU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size and structure of the AFU, as well as the volumes and types of weapons and military equipment needed, must be calculated in accordance with such a military strategy. The industrial base, production capabilities, and access to strategic materials necessary for the production of weapons are an integral part of strategic effectiveness and require significant improvement. When planning a military strategy, maximum effectiveness can be achieved by identifying the enemy’s critical vulnerabilities and directing efforts towards their exploitation. Ukraine’s asymmetric naval strategy, which has already made it possible to destroy several dozen Russian ships with relatively cheap naval drones and forced the Russian Navy to significantly reduce its operations in the Black Sea, is a brilliant example of such an approach. NATO has historically had and still maintains air superiority over Russia, so increasing the aviation capabilities of the Air Force of Ukraine at the expense of a significant number of Western systems would be a completely logical and achievable step in the short term. NATO has at its disposal a large number of such systems, as well as air-to-air missiles, and could provide these systems to Ukraine, even temporarily. The number of pilots of the Air Force of Ukraine who have already been trained to pilot these systems is not an obstacle in this case, since among the foreigners (including citizens of countries that are not members of NATO) who have shown a readiness to join the International Legion of the AFU, there are many former pilots with such experience. These individuals could combine combat sorties with instructor work for a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operational effectiveness in the conditions of modern large-scale warfare, characterised by a high level of innovation, requires the leadership of the AFU to be able to identify and implement useful technologies extremely quickly, as well as to change operational concepts and doctrines taking into account constant technological changes, finding ways to combine old and new platforms in a combined arms battle. In modern warfare, the side that is able to adapt to these changes more quickly has a tremendous advantage. Such adaptability also requires a readiness on the part of military leaders for personal discomfort associated with the need to abandon old methods, approaches and even systems that have lost their relevance in modern conditions. Operational concepts must be developed in order to achieve the military strategy and meet its requirements. The same flexibility and willingness to quickly adapt to new challenges is also necessary for Ukraine’s partners. This concerns, first of all, their ability to quickly improve military equipment not only because Ukraine needs it, but also because the security of the partners themselves depends on its improvement. The current pace of this improvement is completely unsatisfactory, and the approaches to identifying and eliminating the shortcomings of such systems require a complete revision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The lack of a strategy for victory will turn this war into a war of attrition for Ukraine, which completely coincides with Russian interests&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactical effectiveness, the improvement of which is given the most attention, is the last in this list and should be fully subordinated to the logic of the general military strategy and operational concepts aimed at its achievement. Otherwise, the conflict between tactics and strategy usually leads to strategic rather than tactical inefficiencies. In addition, tactics must take into account the presence or absence of operational capabilities. This problem is particularly noticeable in the development and training of Ukrainian military personnel. For example, the training of Ukrainian ground units in 2023 was largely focused on practicing assault actions as part of small groups, rather than on offensive operations as part of large units during a breakthrough of the enemy’s deep defence, which did not correspond to the original plans for the counteroffensive. The training programme carried out by Ukraine’s Western partners was also overly concerned for a long time with actions in the conditions of the stabilisation phase of the war, which is an integral part of expeditionary operations but does not make any sense when liberating one’s own territories. Moreover, such training causes military personnel to develop reflexes that may even be harmful in the context of a major conventional war. In general, the tactical training of the AFU does not fully take into account the nature of the current confrontation, and is also not sufficiently aimed at exploiting the enemy’s weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the biggest obstacle to improving the effectiveness of the AFU is the lack of a clear and agreed-upon grand strategy for winning the war by Ukraine and its partners, as well as a military strategy, which is an integral component of this. This is due, first of all, to a lack of clear political goals accepted by all of Ukraine’s partners, which would ensure not only the liberation of its territory, but also long-term security in Europe. In the absence of such goals, a grand strategy and a general military strategy for victory in this war, the planning of individual operations, the assessment and provision of the needs of the AFU, the development of training programmes and preparation, and the introduction of new tactical techniques can at best support Ukraine’s ability to conduct the war, but not to win it. The lack of a strategy for victory will turn this war into a war of attrition for Ukraine, which completely coincides with Russian interests.&lt;/p&gt;

To implement it, allies committed to take various measures to strengthen their deterrence and defense at the 2022 Madrid Summit.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;As NATO leaders gather in Washington for the alliance’s 75th anniversary summit, this paper takes stock of allied efforts to strengthen collective defense. It finds they have made substantial progress on defense spending, forward defense, high-readiness forces, command and control, collective defense exercises, and integrating Finland and Sweden — achievements which should be recognized in Washington. However, while NATO might be ready for war, the question remains whether it is ready to fight — and thereby deter — a protracted war. To meet this goal, allies still need to spend more, boost industrial capacity, address critical capability gaps, and bolster national resilience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Si vis pacem, para bellum. If you want peace, prepare for war. If the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) did not already have a motto — animus in consulendo liber, “in discussion a free mind” — this Latin adage would fit the alliance’s purpose quite well. The phrase conveys a piece of timeless deterrence logic: preparing for war might be the best way of averting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, NATO adopted a new “back to the future” strategic concept which returned Russia to its Cold War status of adversary and put deterrence and defense back at the heart of alliance strategy. NATO revealed the concept at the 2022 Madrid Summit alongside a wide range of commitments which NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg described as amounting to a “fundamental shift to our deterrence and defence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In less than a month, NATO leaders will gather in Washington for the alliance’s 75th anniversary summit. Ahead of that historic meeting, this paper takes stock of the progress NATO allies have made in implementing the commitments made two years ago in Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper comprises three sections. The first briefly recaps NATO’s efforts to strengthen defense and deterrence since 2014 and considers Russia’s current threat to NATO. The second assesses the progress made by NATO allies in implementing their Madrid commitments to strengthen deterrence and defense across the nine issue areas described in the Madrid Summit Declaration. The final section uses this assessment to gauge whether NATO is ready for war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-road-to-washington&quot;&gt;The Road to Washington&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s journey toward stronger deterrence and defense began at the 2014 Wales Summit where allies responded to Russia’s annexation of Crimea by making long-term commitments to raise defense spending above 2 percent of GDP. Their near-term focus was on adapting NATO’s force posture. This started with the 2014 Readiness Action Plan, followed by establishing four Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) multinational battlegroups in the east in 2016. In 2018, the NATO Readiness Initiative improved the state of NATO’s high-readiness forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the 2022 Strategic Concept garnered public attention, another NATO concept agreed upon in 2020 was already quietly revolutionizing deterrence and defense: the Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area (DDA) concept. The DDA focuses on “force employment to deter and defend today.” Following Russia’s 2022 invasion, NATO activated its defense plans, making 40,000 troops — plus air, naval, and other assets — available to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). Four new EFP missions followed, alongside a strengthened maritime posture, air policing, air defense, and multinational exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO planning was further transformed at last year’s Vilnius summit with the unveiling of new defense plans, another product of the DDA. “The DDA family of plans,” as SACEUR, U.S. general Christopher G. Cavoli, describes them, include three regional plans (covering northern, central, and southern Europe) alongside domain-specific plans (for land, air, maritime, cyber, and space forces) as well as plans for logistics and sustainment. As one recent analysis suggests: “None of this would have been possible without the DDA.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ready-for-war&quot;&gt;Ready for War?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s actions in Ukraine confirmed the fears of many that Vladimir Putin would seek to continue the Stalinist subjugation of Russia’s near abroad. The war suggests that the worst-case thinking about Russia’s “maximum intentions” that historically guided NATO’s planning is warranted for the foreseeable future. Putin’s apparent propensity for aggression, risk taking, and strategic miscalculation makes him a dangerous adversary — and a difficult one to deter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has seen staggering losses in Ukraine but has “almost completely reconstituted militarily” to pre-war levels thanks to national mobilization and a war economy supported by China, Iran, and North Korea. Beyond Ukraine, Russia is making nuclear threats against NATO and stepping up hybrid threats across Europe. Several European leaders have warned that Russia could attack NATO allies within three, four, five, or eight years. Not only is China helping Russia’s military reconstitute, but the prospect of coordinated aggression between Moscow and Beijing has many implications for NATO — the most serious being the implications for U.S. force posture in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, what kind of war should NATO prepare for? Perhaps the most stressing scenario is a rapid territory seizure by Russian forces in the Baltic region. Variations of this scenario have been described, wargamed, and analyzed in recent years, almost becoming cliché, but it should not be dismissed. In military planning jargon, it is the “most likely” and “most dangerous” course of action for Russia to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is the likeliest scenario for any Russian conventional attack on NATO because the local force balance drastically favors Russia. This does not mean it is likely — a lot of things would have to go badly for Russia to consider this a good option — just that it might be the most likely NATO-Russia war scenario. Despite all the warnings from NATO leaders, the jury is still out on whether (and why) Russia would invade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequences mean NATO planners must be prepared, as this kind of invasion risks nuclear escalation and is hard to reverse. Any NATO operation to regain lost ground would require establishing air superiority and control of the Baltic Sea before massing a significant local ground force. Even with NATO assurances, this situation is sufficiently threatening under Russian doctrine for Moscow to deploy non-strategic nuclear weapons for coercive or military purposes — forcing NATO to threaten nuclear use to compel withdrawal and reestablish deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why Baltic officials describe the best strategy as “repel, don’t expel.” It is also why NATO’s new strategic concept returned deterrence by denial and forward defense to the core of alliance strategy. As with the Cold War, deterrence by punishment — which relies primarily on the “sword” of U.S., UK, and French strategic nuclear forces — will continue to do most of the heavy lifting to deter the most serious threats to NATO allies. But just like in the Cold War, NATO allies will increasingly rely on forward-based “shield” forces to strengthen conventional deterrence and defense. This paper focuses on the commitments made by NATO allies in Madrid to do just this. The next section analyzes these commitments in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-madrid-to-washington-assessing-commitments-by-nato-allies-to-strengthen-deterrence-and-defense&quot;&gt;From Madrid to Washington: Assessing Commitments by NATO Allies to Strengthen Deterrence and Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-spending&quot;&gt;Defense Spending&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We reaffirm our commitment to the Defence Investment Pledge in its entirety. We will build on that pledge and decide next year on subsequent commitments beyond 2024&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-madrid-summit-declaration&quot;&gt;— Madrid Summit Declaration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Defense Investment Pledge (DIP) required allies to invest at least 2 percent of GDP on defense — and at least 20 percent of that on modernization — by 2024. Last year in Vilnius, allies agreed that 2 percent would become “a minimum.” While in Wales only three allies met the target, this year 18 are projected to do so. NATO estimates that this year will be the first where European NATO allies invest 2 percent of their combined GDP. As Figure 1 shows, European allies have increased their investment by around a third since 2014, to a total of $380 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PAf6lxd.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent announcements on spending included Norway’s “historic boost” to its spending, which will double over the next 12 years. The UK government recently announced a “fully funded plan” to reach 2.5 percent by 2030 — an extra £75 billion ($96 billion). Meanwhile, despite announcing an additional funded CAD 8.1 billion ($5.9 billion) by 2030, Canada would still fall short at 1.76 percent of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite solid progress on defense spending since Madrid, three important questions remain for NATO allies. The first is whether the “2 percent as a minimum” target agreed to in Vilnius is enough to maintain a positive trajectory and deliver the capabilities required for a strong forward defense. The second is what they are spending money on. European allies need to address their known capability gaps and remove their reliance on the United States to conduct high-end collective defense missions. The final question is how the money is being spent. European allies have been spending more but cooperating less, making defense more expensive and inefficient than it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;forward-defense-forces&quot;&gt;Forward Defense Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Allies have committed to deploy additional robust in-place combat-ready forces on our eastern flank, to be scaled up from the existing battle groups to brigade-size units where and when required . . . [including] establishing division-level structures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-madrid-summit-declaration-1&quot;&gt;— Madrid Summit Declaration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main component of NATO’s revitalized forward defense is the eight EFP missions, including multinational forces from several allies led by a framework nation. The status of each mission is set out below, based on the latest available data. This analysis highlights progress against the two new Madrid commitments: to scale up each mission to “brigade-size units” (up to 5,000 personnel) and to establish “division-level structures.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/U4QIKfc.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO forward defense forces are also deployed in the air and at sea. Last year, NATO’s strengthened Air Policing mission conducted over 300 intercepts of Russian aircraft in Baltic airspace. Allied air forces also increased contributions to Air Policing and Air Shielding (air and missile defense). At sea, allied Standing Naval Forces came under SACEUR’s command for the first time in 2022, while a French navy carrier strike group operated under NATO command in the Mediterranean — another first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant progress has been made to enhance NATO’s forward defense. Since Madrid, allies have proven the combat readiness of all eight EFP missions with battlegroup-level certification exercises. Four of the eight missions have been exercised at the brigade level to rehearse rapid reinforcement in a crisis. Meanwhile, all eight missions are integrated into NATO’s command structure at the division level. EFP Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland have plans to integrate with new national division-level structures. Meanwhile, NATO allies have strengthened existing missions in the air and at sea. However, only two EFP missions are planning to permanently scale up to brigade size. This is because the Madrid agreement leaves the decision to scale up to the host, framework, and contributing nations. The question remains as to whether even brigade-size missions would be sufficient to deter by denial, given the local force imbalance in Russia’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nato-force-model&quot;&gt;NATO Force Model&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We welcome the initial offers by Allies to NATO’s new force model, which will strengthen and modernise the NATO Force Structure and will resource our new generation of military plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-madrid-summit-declaration-2&quot;&gt;— Madrid Summit Declaration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Madrid, allies agreed to transition to a new force model by 2023. The aim of the New NATO Force Model (NFM) is to boost deterrence and defense by providing a much larger pool of forces available to deploy quickly in a crisis. The NFM replaced the 40,000 strong NATO Response Force (NRF). As Figure 2 below shows, it contains three tiers of forces held at graduated readiness, from 10 to 180 days (the NRF’s readiness time was 15 days). The NFM presaged the regional plans agreed to a year later in Vilnius, stating forces “will be pre-assigned to specific plans.” The NFM also provides the high-readiness forces required for the new Allied Reaction Force, to which NATO will transitioned in mid-2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KaqiGH6.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detailed allied contributions to the NFM remain classified, but public announcements suggest progress. Germany agreed to contribute 30,000 troops and a combination of 85 ships and aircraft mobilizable in 30 days (Tier 2). The United Kingdom offered combat aircraft, ships, aircraft carriers, and “brigade-sized land forces.” The United States has also placed much of its 80,000 strong forces in Europe under NATO command, the most connected it has been to NATO structures in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges remain regarding force generation and sustainment. Last year, NATO Military Committee leaders acknowledged the remaining work to meet 300,000 but emphasized the importance of knowing what is missing. Additionally, experts such as John R. Deni of the U.S. Army War College have raised concerns about readiness. Recruitment and retention challenges in Europe and the United States undermine readiness, while demand for enablers and logistics personnel is going up. Deni notes that NATO has established readiness verification processes for Tier 1 and Tier 2 forces, but these have revealed shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authorities for SACEUR to activate and deploy NFM forces pre-crisis will be essential for delivering the DDA. As SACEUR confirmed, these authorities support “NATO’s ability to execute its plans and helps influence Allies to contribute their own forces.” Yet, allies are not always willing to grant NATO commanders the “transfer of authority” required for optimization and efficiency. This also highlights the significance of aligning NFM force composition with the regional plans, potentially different from the forces allies typically provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command-structure&quot;&gt;Command Structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Allies have committed to . . . enhanced command and control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-madrid-summit-declaration-3&quot;&gt;— Madrid Summit Declaration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO has steadily adapted its command structure since Madrid, vital for the implementation and execution of the regional plans. The NFM’s scale also underscores the need for an updated and modernized structure. Figure 3 shows critical command and control (C2) nodes and how they relate to NATO’s regional plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4knnsr5.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New headquarters include Headquarters Multinational Division North (MND N) in Ādaži, Latvia, which became fully operational in July 2023. In March 2024, Headquarters Multinational Division Northeast (HQ MND-NE) in Elbląg, Poland, followed suit. Both have a key role in coordinating EFP missions. In September 2023, the NATO Rapid Deployable Corps Italy (NRDC-ITA) became the interim headquarters of the Allied Reaction Force (ARF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The addition of Finland and Sweden to NATO also required new C2 arrangements. JFC Norfolk (JFCNF), NATO’s newest strategic command, which oversees the northwest Europe regional plan (see Figure 3), became fully operational in July 2021 but significantly changed following Finland and Sweden’s accession, when a political consensus formed across the Nordic nations to gather under JFCNF. To meet this reconfiguration, the JFCNF is being upscaled, with full integration planned for 2025. The JFCNF demonstrated its readiness by taking command of Steadfast Defender for one month while the exercise was in its area of responsibility. A new corps-level land component command has been proposed in Mikkeli, Finland (about 140 km from the Russian border), likely vital for the JFCNF’s C2 infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If created, Mikkeli would take the number of corps-level commands to the 11 deemed necessary by NATO to deliver on regional plans. Streamlining NATO’s C2 structures is crucial for robust deterrence and defense. Agile commands such as the German DEU MARFOR, capable of rapid scalability in crises or supporting DDA activities, are essential. Prioritizing C2 adaptation and exercising should address this need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;integrate-finland-and-sweden&quot;&gt;Integrate Finland and Sweden&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We reaffirm our commitment to NATO’s Open Door Policy. Today, we have decided to invite Finland and Sweden to become members of NATO and agreed to sign the Accession Protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-madrid-summit-declaration-4&quot;&gt;— Madrid Summit Declaration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most notable NATO achievement since the Madrid Summit has been Finland and Sweden joining as full NATO members. Following their formal invitation and after nearly two years of political drama, Ankara and Budapest eventually dropped their objections after extracting concessions from various allies, including the United States. This sent a resounding political signal to Moscow and added serious deterrent power to NATO’s ranks, gaining two highly capable members with the ability to severely constrain Russia’s freedom of maneuver in the Baltic Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of fully integrating Finland and Sweden into NATO is ongoing, but substantial progress has been made. The integration is helped by the deep military cooperation between the two countries and NATO prior to accession. Both were Enhanced Opportunities Partners (under the Partnership Interoperability Initiative) which assessed Finland and Sweden as more interoperable with NATO than some existing allies. The integration of the “formidable” air power of the Nordic countries has been developing for decades, as the recent integration of Finnish and Swedish air forces into NATO illustrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several challenges remain to fully integrate Finland and Sweden. These include developing adequate command structure arrangements, adjusting the regional plans and DDA, and taking account of both nations’ requirements for defense across domains, including logistics. Analysis suggests the critical role here of the United States and United Kingdom, given that the United States recently signed Nordic defense cooperation agreements and the United Kingdom leads the Joint Expeditionary Force, which has integrated Finnish and Swedish forces on operations for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;collective-defense-exercises&quot;&gt;Collective Defense Exercises&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will enhance our collective defense exercises to be prepared for high intensity and multi-domain operations and ensure reinforcement of any ally on short notice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-madrid-summit-declaration-5&quot;&gt;— Madrid Summit Declaration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO has significantly delivered since Madrid on its promise to refocus its exercise program on collective defense. The recent Steadfast Defender was the largest NATO exercise since the Cold War, featuring 90,000 personnel from all allies across all domains. It included maritime and amphibious drills in the High North and multi-domain exercises across Europe, with a focus on military mobility. Steadfast Defender has been an important tool to test and validate other major lines of effort such as the NFM and regional plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s exercise program has focused on multi-domain operations. In the air, Germany hosted and led its largest edition of Air Defender, while Vigilant Falcon tested Baltic air policing this May. At sea, Neptune Strike 2024 included five carrier strike groups in the Mediterranean, and Dynamic Mongoose focused on anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare. The 2023 Baltops exercise was the first with Finland participating as an ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newest domains, cyber and space, were also tested. NATO held its dedicated space exercise Vulcan Guard in April. The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia, hosted the world’s largest cyber defense exercise, Locked Shields, last year. In June, the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Exercise will test interoperability across all domains and NATO C2 systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-industry&quot;&gt;Defense Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To have the necessary capabilities, the Alliance requires a strong and capable defence industry, with resilient supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-vilnius-communiqué&quot;&gt;— Vilnius Communiqué&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war in Ukraine revealed the critical state of NATO’s defense industrial base, as allies seek to supply Ukraine with munitions and replenish their stocks. At Vilnius, allies urged the removal of barriers to defense trade and investment among themselves to bolster resiliency. The Defence Production Action Plan (DPAP) was unveiled, “leveraging the Alliance’s role as a convener, standard-setter, requirement setter and aggregator, and delivery enabler.” Highlighted DPAP priority areas include aggregating demand across allies to accelerate joint procurement, increasing production capacity, and enhancing allied interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varying progress has been evident in demand aggregation, interoperability, and procurement coordination and collaboration. Since July 2023, the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) has awarded contracts for munitions, joint procurement of Patriot missiles, and artillery shells. In addition, allies have improved multinational capability cooperation, evident in NATO’s MRTT-C air fleet achieving initial operational capability. As Figure 4 shows, traditional European producers have increased trade within Europe, but Poland’s all-source importation strategy has significantly boosted arms trade for the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synchronization efforts between the European Union and NATO could enhance NATO deterrence and defense, should such efforts be pursued. The European Union has allocated over €500 million ($544 million) to ramp up ammunition production and has provided aid to Ukraine through the European Peace Facility. Additionally, its first ever Defense Industrial Strategy (EDIS) was released this year, with the aim to boost capacity and intra-European collaboration. While some have seen EDIS as in competition with DPAP on standard setting, officials affirm that they are not in competition with each other. The European Union and NATO share the goal of increasing readiness, making enhanced coordination between them essential to avoid duplication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jFafUn4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, significant defense industrial production challenges remain. Despite clear demand signals, barriers inhibiting production acceleration and NATO-EU tensions persist. Orders form only one input in the production equation, and delivery delays fail to convert into weapons stocks in reliable timeframes. Figure 4 shows incremental progress but demonstrates that longstanding pathologies hobbling European production are not easily overcome. To ensure NATO readiness, the United States should prioritize multilateral munitions production with member states over bilateral efforts. The European Union’s anticipated increased role raises NATO concerns, but it could positively transform the transatlantic defense industrial base, contingent on EU funding capacity. To effectively leverage NATO collective investments and build production capacity, the alliance would benefit from greater defense industrial integration and consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defense-capabilities&quot;&gt;Defense Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Investing in our defence and key capabilities is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-madrid-summit-declaration-6&quot;&gt;— Madrid Summit Declaration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s cumulative capabilities far exceed Russia’s — even excluding the United States. This is shown below in Table 2, which uses two examples of critical capabilities to make the comparison. Two years of war in Ukraine have taken their toll on Russia’s armed forces, as its fleet of active main battle tanks has diminished by 41 percent since 2022 and active personnel have fallen by nearly 20 percent despite partial national mobilization. Moreover, non-U.S. NATO can field more modern equipment than Russia. Approximately 71 percent of non-U.S. NATO’s combat aircraft fleet was produced or modernized after 1990, compared to 53 percent of Russia’s inventory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/H2JAe5C.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this advantage does not necessarily translate to the battlefield. NATO faces significant capability gaps and readiness challenges which undermine conventional deterrence. Allies may have more advanced combat aircraft, but they have struggled with magazine depth. During NATO’s 2011 air operations in Libya, non-U.S. NATO members began running out of precision munitions within a month — and this was a comparatively minor operation compared to defending the Baltics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s issues go beyond airpower. According to a study by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the number of combat battalions, in-service main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored reconnaissance vehicles, and self-propelled artillery in European armies has remained static or fallen between 2014 and 2023. More broadly, European nations are carrying significant gaps in naval forces, air enablers, air defense, and “battle-decisive ammunition” (artillery munitions and missiles). Any major combat operation in Europe would rely on U.S. forces to make up for European shortfalls in the land, maritime, and air forces required to deliver a range of warfighting missions. These issues have not yet been addressed by the significant increases in defense investment by NATO allies since 2014. NATO allies clearly face an important conversion challenge in translating their wealth into combat capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilience&quot;&gt;Resilience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Resilience is a national responsibility and a collective commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-madrid-summit-declaration-7&quot;&gt;— Madrid Summit Declaration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience — incorporating military capacity, civil preparedness, and emergency planning — was NATO’s first line of defense against the Soviet Union. The same is true again today. Since Madrid, allies have launched several new initiatives to enhance resilience. In October 2022, NATO established a Resilience Committee which met twice prior to Vilnius. In March 2023, the NATO-EU Task Force on the Resilience of Critical Infrastructure was established to examine four key sectors: energy, transport, digital infrastructure, and space. Its final report in June 2023 recommended 14 actions to leverage NATO-EU cooperation on critical infrastructure. This was picked up at the Vilnius Summit in July, when NATO launched a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Underwater Infrastructure within NATO’s Allied Maritime Command. The summit communiqué also emphasized societal resilience, health systems, supply chains, and energy security. Allies also agreed to resilience objectives and a new baseline for allied resilience planning — which remains a national responsibility, guided by NATO authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience is a complex issue that demands persistence, investment, and cooperation, requiring a more coordinated and collective approach. Building on progress to date, NATO’s Resilience Committee should consider new ideas such as a NATO resilience fund, a resilience advisory group, and a NATO-wide Security Risk Assessment (NSRA) to identify key resilience risks. The European Union’s renewed focus on resilience and the unique levers it possesses — from financial instruments to regulatory powers — make it well placed to act boldly, in continued close cooperation with NATO. These efforts also boost allies’ responses to generational challenges in NATO’s Strategic Concept, such as green energy and the digital transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enhancing military resilience through NATO is not enough; each ally must confront the societal challenge of war preparedness based on its own strategic culture. New allies Finland and Sweden offer a new wave of expertise based on their advanced approaches to whole-of-society resilience and civil preparedness. Above all, NATO allies must find the “will to fight,” which — as Ukraine has shown — remains the foundation of defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-nato-ready-for-war&quot;&gt;Is NATO Ready for War?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detailed assessments above are summarized in Table 3 and discussed below. A simple rating of “on track” or “off track” is used because the commitments made by NATO allies in Madrid were not scheduled for completion in Washington. As one analysis put it: “the alliance’s journey toward stronger defense and deterrence has only just begun.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WTRupt2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this assessment tell us about NATO’s readiness for war? The answer to this question depends on the kind of war that emerges from any crisis. It seems clear that NATO is ready to “fight tonight.” The transition to the DDA and the regional plans adopted in Vilnius have driven a step change in the scale of NATO’s forces which are combat ready, deployed forward, and under SACEUR’s direct command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding to eight EFP missions and reinforcing air and maritime presence has empowered NATO to swiftly assemble a significant fighting force along the eastern front in crises, fostering a cultural shift among allies. Meanwhile, NATO’s C2 has evolved quickly and demonstrated readiness through large-scale exercises. The NFM has led to a revolution in apportioning high-readiness national forces to NATO at a scale 10 times greater than before. Above all, NATO has successfully integrated Finland and Sweden, adding significant air, naval, and land combat power and removing any uncertainty over their contribution to an Article 5 scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a closer look at the longer-term measures agreed upon in Madrid reveals a slightly different question: NATO might be ready for war, but is it ready for protracted war? Any permutation of a serious Russia-NATO conflict that does not end quickly will become a clash of not just armies, but societies. This becomes a competition in resilience and preparedness, industrial capacity and supply chains, magazine depth, logistics, mass, resources, and especially the “will to fight.” The halting progress and ongoing challenges to increase defense spending, transform defense industrial capacity, address critical capability gaps, and bolster national resilience — all required to strengthen deterrence and defense — must be acknowledged, addressed, and overcome. As SACEUR Cavoli recently clarified, the key question for NATO is not about Russian reconstitution per se, but relative to the alliance’s own deterrence and defense reconstitution. As Clausewitz reminds us in his “two wrestlers” metaphor, all strategy is dynamic and relative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reconstituting their forces, NATO allies face the perennial challenge of balancing the “iron triangle” of trade-offs between readiness, modernization, and force structure. For NATO, this might be adjusted as shown in Figure 5. In essence, allies must balance short-term force increases (“fight tonight”) and long-term modernization efforts (“fight tomorrow”), all while preparing for protraction. For example, compare Poland’s efforts to soon field the biggest army in Europe with the United Kingdom’s focus on becoming a “Science and Tech Superpower” by 2030. This trade-off is neither new nor binary, but the nature of the Russian threat makes it critical. The answer will depend on the judgment of NATO allies as to when Russia might be able and willing to attack. The diverse range of assessments and inherent uncertainty of this task make it challenging, but NATO’s war readiness will depend on the type of conflict that arises. It seems clear that NATO is ready to “fight tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ALAsfJx.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final question raised by this analysis is the paradigm within which NATO allies are planning to meet their Madrid commitments. The 2022 Strategic Concept put forward defense back on NATO’s agenda, but for all its qualities, allied forward presence is “still a tripwire.” Even if the Madrid commitments were fulfilled completely, NATO’s forward presence would likely still fall short of the denial standard required to make a Russian fait accompli untenable. The strategy would then be “expel, not repel,” when the reverse is far preferable. The alliance would be placing all of its eggs in the basket of nuclear deterrence, with all the catastrophic associated risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As NATO leaders gather in Washington this summer, they should celebrate their significant progress in fulfilling the commitments made in Madrid to bolster allied deterrence and defense. They should also push for improvements in key areas underpinning NATO’s readiness for a protracted war: defense spending, industrial capacity, critical capability gaps, and national resilience. Furthermore, they should reconsider whether the level of ambition they set in Madrid is high enough. In the Cold War, NATO’s strategy rested just as much on a robust forward defense “shield” as it did on its “sword” of nuclear deterrence. Times have changed, but not that much. Si vis pacem, para bellum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies surrounding the lithium-ion battery (LIB) supply chain lie at the intersection of trade, climate, and national security considerations. The LIB supply chain spans the globe, and yet some critical inputs are only produced in a handful of countries — in particular China, which is dominant at several key stages of the technology’s production. The Biden administration appears to have three central, yet misaligned, objectives regarding the LIB supply chain: de-risking away from China’s dominance, reshoring manufacturing capabilities, and accelerating the green transition. To spur the technology’s production and deployment, the United States must undertake several economic and trade policy changes to address gaps in its current approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-ion battery (LIB) supply chains encapsulate the profound shift in trade, economic, and climate policy underway in the United States and abroad. Policymakers are conflating national security considerations with climate and trade policies and appear determined to bolster supply chains via reshoring and nearshoring the production of critical items — including those necessary to achieve climate goals. The LIB supply chain spans the globe, but crucial inputs and processing capabilities are centralized in a handful of countries. This dual dynamic of dispersion and concentration renders the global supply chain susceptible to geopolitical disruptions and shifts in trade relationships. Exacerbating this issue is China’s dominance in lithium-ion manufacturing, including in the processing of most mineral inputs and key end uses such as electric vehicles (EVs) — as well as its position as an economic competitor and a long-term strategic threat to U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration appears to have three central U.S. objectives. The first is de-risking away from China’s current dominance over manufacturing key goods, such as the lithium-ion battery, given these items’ importance to economic competitiveness and security. The second is bringing manufacturing back to the United States. The country’s sector has gradually lost out to foreign competitors, costing the nation jobs and resilience in exchange for efficiency and competitive prices. The third is accelerating away from hydrocarbons to cut carbon emissions and mitigate the potentially catastrophic effects of global warming, in accordance with U.S. multilateral commitments. The policy dilemma is that the first two goals are not compatible with the third. The United States appears to have decided to pursue the first two at the expense of the third, as this paper will discuss. If the United States wants to accelerate its carbon reduction goals, then changes in policy will be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De-risking away from China’s dominance, bringing manufacturing back to U.S. shores, and accelerating the green transition are three goals inherently at odds. Liberalizing trade with the China would enable U.S. manufacturers to significantly scale up operations by accessing lower-cost inputs and give consumers access to cheap goods critical to achieving decarbonization goals. However, it would negate de-risking efforts. Focusing on bringing manufacturing back to the United States would boost job growth and de-risk supply chains, but it would deflect attention away from building sustainable and advantageous trade relationships with prospective nearshoring partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effective U.S. LIB production and deployment strategy requires several policy changes. This project aims to shed light on current shortcomings in the U.S. approach and provide recommendations related to different stages of the LIB supply chain. This paper, the last in a series of three, outlines the final steps in producing a lithium-ion battery. The first brief examines the technical steps and policy challenges involved in processing and defining critical minerals and raw materials in a battery. The second brief builds upon these findings by describing the use of these minerals and materials to create cathode and anode active battery materials and other components. This final piece concludes by outlining the LIB supply chain and the assembly of battery cells into modules, which are packed and sold to manufacturers of different end products, including EVs, solar power backup storage, consumer technology products, and emergency power backup systems. This analysis then examines trade and economic policy challenges that hinder the production and deployment of lithium-ion batteries and their end products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-battery-production&quot;&gt;Final Battery Production&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once individual components such as cathodes and anodes are turned into functioning battery cells, manufacturers combine individual battery cells into sets called battery modules. These modules are then assembled to create a battery pack, which, after testing, is fit for commercial use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;modules&quot;&gt;Modules&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A battery module is created through the attachment and connection of multiple battery cells. The surfaces of the battery cells are cleaned, and the battery cells are checked for leaks. If no such openings are found, an adhesive is used to ensure the batteries stick to the end plates. The cells are then stacked side by side, and the end plates are connected using either a wiring harness or a metallic strip designed for high current distribution. Lastly, a cover is put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While individual battery cells could serve as the foundation for battery packs, a pack of battery cells immediately becomes unusable if a single cell breaks down. To negate this flaw, modules are used as an intermediate step. Modules also have greater structural integrity and vibration resistance than a set of battery cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;battery-packs&quot;&gt;Battery Packs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a set of modules has been assembled, they may be connected to form a battery pack. A single battery pack may require different numbers of modules or cells to function depending on its intended use, and it may require a battery management system to evaluate the charge level and service life of the pack. The system uses battery-monitoring units to assess the safety and performance of individual cells within a pack, thereby increasing battery longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-end-uses&quot;&gt;Key End Uses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lithium-ion battery is becoming a ubiquitous input for several goods critical to the U.S. economy. These end uses are set to accelerate the green transition and enhance the U.S. energy security landscape. They will transform the landscape of consumer electronics and revolutionize transportation. In short, the sectors for which lithium-ion batteries are destined hold tremendous importance. Chief among them are solar panels, emergency power backup systems, EVs, and consumer technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The lithium-ion battery is becoming a ubiquitous input for several goods critical to the U.S. economy. These end uses are set to accelerate the green transition and enhance the U.S. energy security landscape.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;solar-panels&quot;&gt;Solar Panels&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solar panel in its most basic form is a collection of photovoltaic cells that absorb energy from sunlight and transform it into electricity. Over the past few years, these devices have become exponentially more prevalent. In 2023, the United States generated 238,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from solar power, an increase of roughly 800 percent since 2014. While these panels can generate electricity only in sunlight, they use lithium-ion batteries to store excess power accumulated during the day for use at night and on cloudy days, allowing for uninterrupted flow of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These batteries must be connected to solar panels to charge and store excess electricity. This connection is achieved using charge controllers to adjust the voltage and current to ensure the battery is not damaged. The lithium battery pack is plugged into the charge controller, which is then connected to the solar panels via single-contact electrical (MC4) connectors. While lithium-ion batteries are roughly 10 times more expensive than lead-acid batteries (the main alternative battery type for solar batteries), they make up for this cost difference by being 20–30 percent more efficient and lasting roughly 10 times longer. As a result, lithium-ion technology accounted for 90 percent of the installed power and energy capacity of battery storage in the United States in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;emergency-power-backup-systems&quot;&gt;Emergency Power Backup Systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing adoption of renewable energy creates additional challenges for grid operators. Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, generate electricity based on the availability of their respective resources. Consequently, grid operators must effectively manage electricity supply to ensure reliability, as these sources are inherently intermittent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As countries prioritize integrating renewable energy into their grids, adoption requires the immediate purchasing of electricity generated from renewable sources. However, renewable energy plants often generate surplus electricity beyond current demand. While traditional fossil fuel and thermal power plants can be shut down during periods of low demand to conserve fuel, the intermittent nature of wind and solar energy means that simply shutting them off is seldom a viable option. This surplus electricity has spurred the development of grid energy storage systems to store and manage excess energy efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-ion batteries serve as a versatile backup power solution and are not limited to the solar energy domain. They can be connected to wind turbines and generators as well as the electric grid. In all of these cases, lithium-ion batteries store excess energy for later use that would otherwise be wasted. These systems may be divided into two subcategories: Behind-the-meter systems are generally geared toward individual consumers and small businesses and are meant to allow for emergency power storage or continuous power use from an energy source. Front-of-the-meter systems, in contrast, are larger, made up of a greater number of battery packs, and link directly to the power grid. Utilities and large firms often use them as a means to address network congestion or to alleviate demand for new power lines. These systems are then installed at the distribution substation level, where power is transformed from medium to low voltage and sent to individual households. Front-of-meter systems allow for excess power to be returned to other distribution centers, or these systems may simply serve as storage for a planned or unplanned outage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the existing electricity storage technologies — such as pumped hydro, compressed air, flywheels, or vanadium redox flow batteries — lithium-ion batteries have the advantages of fast response rate, high energy density, good energy efficiency, and reasonable life cycle. Substantial growth is anticipated in the United States for both types of storage systems. U.S. cumulative installed battery storage capacity, which stands at roughly 17 GWh, is expected to increase to 50 GWh by 2025. Overall, solar power alone is also predicted to see large increases in adoption and will represent roughly 7 percent of total energy generation in 2025. As a result, global demand for battery storage systems is set to increase by 30 percent annually. By 2030, these storage systems will account for roughly 700 GWh of global demand, a figure equal to the total global demand for batteries in all industries as of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electric-vehicles&quot;&gt;Electric Vehicles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EV sector accounted for 80 percent of global LIB demand in 2023, or roughly 800 GWh. EVs are distinguished from conventional cars by the presence of an underpan, or the area below the car where the batteries are stored. Commercial and public transport EVs may have multiple battery packs located in the front or back or even on the roof of the vehicle. The battery pack, which is generally made up of six modules, each of which has 12 cells, is connected to an inverter that converts the power supply from AC to DC. In turn, the inverter is connected to an electric motor that powers the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recyclability, fast charging speed, and long life cycle of these batteries have spurred a boom in global demand for both EV batteries and the vehicles they power. Global demand for batteries from the EV sector has increased by 470 percent since 2020, when demand from the EV sector stood at 175 GWh. While these increases have been significant, LIB demand is forecasted to increase to 4.1 terawatt-hours (TWh) in the EV sector by 2030, and EVs are set to account for 40 percent of global auto sales by 2030 — an amount equal to 40 million EVs as well as an additional 20 million hybrids sold per annum. The average EV releases only 150 grams of greenhouse gas per mile (accounting for the power generation necessary to charge EVs), roughly 230 grams per mile less than the average conventional vehicle. This significant difference means replacing 40 million conventional vehicles with EVs will decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 395 billion pounds per annum — a critical step in achieving U.S. decarbonization goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;consumer-technology&quot;&gt;Consumer Technology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lightweight nature of lithium-ion batteries and their relatively long battery life and lifetime longevity make them ideal power sources for portable electronic devices such as laptops and digital watches. Lithium-ion batteries may also be found in cell phones, cameras, and tablets, as well as home appliances such as wireless vacuum cleaners; they are present in certain mobility products, such as scooters and hoverboards. The energy density and long lifetime of these batteries ensure that the electronics that rely on them are replaced far less often. Given their ubiquity, lithium-ion batteries will be essential to replacing internal combustion engines, not only in cars but also in boats, further reducing pollution and harm to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high energy density of these batteries renders them far superior to previous battery technologies, such as nickel cadmium (NiCd) and nickel metal hydride, especially in contexts where a smaller battery may allow for adding more hardware to a device. Rather than include modules, many devices use individual cells, ranging from three for mobile phone batteries to six in laptop batteries. The LIB market is rapidly expanding, and its total value is projected to increase by 14.5 percent per year, from $4.9 billion as of 2022 to $18.8 billion as of 2032.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trade-and-domestic-manufacturing-challenges&quot;&gt;Trade and Domestic Manufacturing Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several trade and economy policy gaps are hindering LIB deployment, as well as the production of LIB-powered end uses — ultimately affecting the Biden administration’s stated goal of accelerating U.S. decarbonization. Altogether, these gaps reveal that policymakers have not adopted a unified approach to strengthen the technology’s supply chain. Instead, reshoring and de-risking policies are hindering progress, and existing permitting and infrastructure defects further exacerbate the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Policymakers have not adopted a unified approach to strengthen the technology’s supply chain. Instead, reshoring and de-risking policies are hindering progress, and existing permitting and infrastructure defects further exacerbate the issue.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chief issue with LIB production is not supply shortages; rather, global production capacity vastly outmatches demand. As the United States intensifies its initiatives to bring back the LIB supply chain within its borders, it is becoming apparent that demand shortages may pose significant challenges for nations aiming to develop their homegrown industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to BloombergNEF, demand for lithium-ion batteries in EVs and stationary storage reached approximately 950 GWh last year. However, global manufacturing capacity exceeded this by more than double, reaching close to 2,600 GWh. China’s battery production in 2023 alone matched worldwide demand. The United States is not the sole player aiming to expand its slice of the global battery market through tax incentives and domestic content requirements. Canada is keeping pace with U.S. incentives, and European countries, India, and other regions are also providing subsidies to bolster their battery sectors. This indicates that the oversupply situation is poised to worsen before any signs of improvement emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;barriers-to-growing-demand&quot;&gt;Barriers to Growing Demand&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States must overcome significant foreign trade and domestic economic challenges related to increasing demand for LIB-powered goods. In the case of EVs, there is an evident alternative — internal combustion engines, which still present several advantages. Chief among these advantages is purchase cost. EVs are still more expensive than their gasoline-powered counterparts, primarily due to expensive battery technology. The large charge required to provide a minimum range for most owners requires a costly manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are remaining issues with charger incompatibility that work to dampen consumer demand: the type of plug, power requirements, and app can all vary significantly, sometimes preventing EV owners from effectively using available infrastructure. Related to this problem is the relative lack of charging infrastructure. Today, most electric car and van charging relies on private chargers, mainly at the driver’s residence. Public and workplace charging stations are increasingly valuable for those living in multiple-unit habitations where charger availability could be limited. The stock of workplace chargers is expected to increase about eightfold by 2030 across the scenarios, while the number of public chargers is forecasted to increase around fivefold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 30D Tax Credit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) 30D tax credit aims to address the potential demand shortages caused, in part, by the issues mentioned. The credit, which incentivizes consumers to acquire EVs by providing a tax break of up to $7,500, and the guardrails around it have become emblematic of the anchoring of the current U.S. climate approach in nearshoring and reshoring through industrial policy. To be eligible for the credit, vehicles must undergo final assembly in North America. In addition, to receive half of the credit ($3,750), at least half of the battery components must be manufactured or assembled in North America. That requirement increased to 60 percent in 2024 and will gradually increase to 100 percent by 2029. To qualify for the other half of the credit ($3,750), the battery must contain a certain percentage of critical minerals produced in the United States or a country with which the United States has a free trade agreement. That percentage requirement likewise increased to 50 percent in 2024 and will reach 80 percent by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The percentage-based content requirements required more detailed final rulemaking. After considering public feedback in response to the proposed rules, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released final guidance regarding taxpayer and vehicle eligibility for the new and previously owned clean vehicle credit, as well as critical minerals, battery components requirements, and Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules are part of a compliance review process of critical mineral and battery input requirements, along with FEOC restrictions, which started in the summer of 2024. The Internal Revenue Service conducts the up-front review, assisted by the U.S. Department of Energy. In addition, the Department of the Treasury has announced a novel “Traced Qualifying Value Test,” which requires manufacturers to perform a thorough supply chain review to assess the value-added percentage for extraction, processing, and recycling, which will be key in determining the value of the qualifying critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FEOC restriction final rules make the accounting requirements for relevant critical minerals contained in a battery cell permanent, though they also note that some materials are untraceable. The guidance has generally remained the way it was originally proposed in late 2023: an EV containing battery components manufactured or assembled by an FEOC — defined as an entity that is “owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a government of a foreign country that is a covered nation” (China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea) — does not qualify. This definition includes entities that are “headquartered, incorporated or performing relevant activities in a covered nation, if 25 percent or more of its voting rights, board seats or equity interest are held by the government of a covered nation, or if the entity is effectively controlled by an FEOC through a license or contract with that FEOC.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The credit’s strict requirements slash the number of EV models eligible for the tax incentives. In 2023, Stanford University’s Institute for Economic Policy Research determined that only 11 EV models qualified for the credit under the IRA. Even after the law’s provisions were modified in January 2023, the total number of eligible EVs remained constant at 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the first report of this series notes, the leasing loophole — which presents a gap in the 30D tax credit’s friendshoring and household income requirements — has allowed consumption of EVs to continue to rise despite the IRA’s restrictive intent. Nevertheless, the guardrails around EV restrictions are undoubtedly curtailing their deployment, placing critical impediments on a key technology to achieve U.S. decarbonization goals. By curbing demand through limits around vehicle choices, guardrails around 30D prioritize de-risking from Chinese inputs and spurring domestic manufacturing over accelerating EV adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the guardrails around the IRA tax credits — including 30D — may well violate U.S. commitments to multilateral trade rules. World Trade Organization (WTO) rules are designed to ensure a level playing field of competition in the global marketplace. The act’s use of local content requirements — which make tax credits for EV and battery manufacturing accessible to purchasers of cars only if significant portions of the items are obtained or manufactured within the United States or its free trade agreement allies — have the potential to distort the global green technology market. China has already notified the WTO of its intent to invoke the organization’s dispute settlement procedures regarding the impact of the IRA tax incentives; despite the country’s trade rules violations, it may prevail in this dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trade-and-economic-challenges-against-setting-up-a-viable-domestic-landscape&quot;&gt;Trade and Economic Challenges against Setting Up a Viable Domestic Landscape&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. prioritization of reshoring over friendshoring is unlikely to be effective, as the current domestic landscape is not favorable to rapid LIB deployment; it will therefore hinder the country’s ability to lessen dependence on China. In addition, because domestic conditions in the United States are not yet capable of adequately taking on a reshoring agenda, the U.S. green transition will likely be hobbled. As the United States imposes additional trade barriers to promote domestic production, it is increasingly oversaturating a homegrown market that cannot achieve decarbonization goals or significantly scale up manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trade Barriers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaps in U.S. trade policy also drive up the costs of LIB production and deployment in the United States, as well as the manufacturing and deployment costs of key LIB-powered products — worsening issues related to demand. In addition to lowering content requirements around state-led investments, the United States can improve access to this key decarbonization technology by pursuing free trade policies. The benefits of lower barriers in a broad swath of goods would support LIB production. For instance, the levying of high and broad tariffs on imports and exports has disrupted the chemical value chain and the industries that rely on it, including green technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gaps in U.S. trade policy also drive up the costs of LIB production and deployment in the United States, as well as the manufacturing and deployment costs of key LIB-powered products.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current U.S. most-favored nation (MFN) rates for lithium-ion battery products still impose barriers on the ability to procure these goods. Primary cells and primary batteries, as well as their parts, still face a 2.7 percent rate. Likewise, the rate is approximately 4 percent for critical minerals and 5 percent for magnets. Trade agreements with allies which eliminate these MFN rates would enhance the ability of U.S. companies to acquire products from markets other than China at more competitive costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most evident example of U.S. trade barriers negatively affecting the country’s access to LIB inputs is the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods. In May 2024, the Biden administration announced a significant extension of tariffs on Chinese goods, including some affecting the LIB supply chain. As part of this review, tariffs will increase, particularly in industries such as clean technology, EVs, semiconductors, steel, and aluminum, which have been prioritized by President Biden’s industrial policy. For instance, Chinese EVs will now face a 100 percent tariff, while tariffs on solar cells and semiconductors will double to 50 percent. Additionally, certain steel, aluminum, battery, and medical glove products will see tariffs rise to 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HWOUUdh.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the original 301 tariffs were implemented, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative established a process that permitted private parties to seek exclusion from the tariffs for specific products. Each request underwent individual assessment. The agency outlined its criteria for decisionmaking, taking into account (1) the product’s availability from non-Chinese suppliers, (2) efforts made by importers to procure the product domestically or from other nations, (3) the potential significant economic impact on the importer or other U.S. interests due to Section 301 tariffs imposition on the specific product, and (4) the strategic significance of the product in initiatives such as Made in China 2025 or similar Chinese industrial programs. The exemption process provides a potential road map to reduce the additional costs these tariffs may impose on supporting LIB and LIB end-use development in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. barriers encapsulate the inherent contradiction of imposing additional restrictions on trade with China, which include several goods key to enabling the green transition, while enacting policies to accelerate decarbonization. The new tariffs broadly do not affect products currently being imported in large quantities — in part, due to previous tariffs. However, they further undercut the United States’ ability to use China’s comparative advantages in producing green technologies and reduce the chances of both nations cooperating to address climate issues. In addition, China’s inevitable retaliation to the tariffs may cause further supply chain disruptions; China may, for instance, cut off supplies of key minerals, harass Western companies operating in China, or impose retaliatory tariffs that burden U.S. exporters in critical sectors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, such barriers hinder the effectiveness of the United States’ efforts to switch to renewables through reshoring capabilities and diversifying away from China. The latest imposition of tariffs reinforces this dynamic. The tariffs also encapsulate the misalignment of U.S. decarbonization policies: they were imposed just as the U.S. Department of the Treasury released final rules on the clean vehicle provisions of the IRA which provide additional flexibility in minerals and battery sourcing. The two developments, at odds with each other, show the Biden administration’s inability to adopt a unified in approach in spurring the green transition.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4 id=&quot;identifying-friendshoring-partners&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Identifying Friendshoring Partners&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Identifying friendshoring partners — instead of simply supporting onshoring policies — should be a critical part of the U.S. drive to secure the lithium-ion supply chain. These partners will help the country more efficiently acquire the inputs it needs to strengthen its domestic manufacturing capabilities while diversifying away from China’s dominance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan: A handful of major battery makers exist in Japan, including Panasonic, Mitsubishi, and Toshiba. Additionally, Japanese companies such as Asahi Kasei, Toray Industries, and Sumitomo Metal Mining lead in the manufacturing of separators and positive electrode materials. In mid-2022, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry revealed an industrial strategy aiming to boost the capacity of Japanese manufacturers to 600 GWh globally by 2030, equivalent to 14.4 million units of standard EV batteries, and to achieve a domestic production capacity of EV and energy storage batteries of 150 GWh by 2030.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;South Korea: South Korean battery manufacturers currently hold 37 percent of the market share, with companies such as LG Chemicals, SK, and Samsung leading the charge, placing the country in a formidable position to enhance the diversification of battery supply chains. Seoul has long been proactive in implementing targeted industrial policies for the battery sector. Under the leadership of President Yoon Suk Yeol, ambitious targets have been set for the battery industry, aiming to capture 40 percent of the global market share by 2030. To support this goal, the Yoon administration plans to expand investment tax credits — increasing them from 8 percent to 15 percent for large companies and from 16 percent to 25 percent for small and medium-sized enterprises — while also broadening the scope of credits to include mineral processing. These measures, initially set to expire in 2024, have been extended until 2025.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;European Union: European LIB manufacturers are striving to localize production and adhere to EU regulations while safeguarding their supply chains against geopolitical disruptions. The region aims to establish approximately 50 gigafactories within the next decade to bolster its battery supply chain and meet production targets. Momentum is building in Europe, with several prototype and full-scale battery plants underway. The Volkswagen Group’s battery division, PowerCo, is constructing two gigafactories in Salzgitter, Germany, and near Valencia, Spain. Automotive Cells Company (ACC), backed by Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz, and TotalEnergies, has inaugurated the first of three planned European battery gigafactories in Douvrin, France. Initially, this gigafactory boasts a production line capacity of 13 gigawatt-hours (GWh), set to increase to 40 GWh by 2030. With the capability to manufacture 56,000 battery cells per day, or over 2.4 million battery modules annually, it will support the production of 200,000 to 300,000 EVs each year.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;United Kingdom: In late November 2023, the UK Department for Business and Trade revealed the country’s battery strategy alongside its Advanced Manufacturing Plan. The strategy entails a governmental pledge of over $2.5 billion in capital and research and development (R&amp;amp;D) investment. This funding aims to bolster the manufacturing and advancement of zero-emission vehicles, batteries, and associated supply chains until 2030. To attain this goal, the UK battery strategy adopts a threefold approach. The initial component aims to enhance the nation’s R&amp;amp;D capabilities by creating batteries superior to current models. To achieve this, the strategy fosters innovation, provides financial support for scaling up, and establishes safety and product standards. The second aspect involves fortifying the battery supply chain, including endeavors such as accessing new markets, expediting energy grid connections, and revising planning and permitting procedures. Lastly, the strategy aims to sustain the sector by pinpointing necessary skills, minimizing trade obstacles, and channeling investments into a circular economy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;These are just four examples of potential partners with which the United States could more closely collaborate to friendshore the lithium-ion supply chain. In some countries, such as the South Korea, the dominant landscape and new industrial plan make the nation a reliable partner for a significant portion of the supply chain. In other instances, the United States could identify the comparative advantages of prospective partners. For instance, the United Kingdom has a competitive R&amp;amp;D landscape, which recent investments will bolster. Southeast Asia is expected to be an important hub for electric two-wheeled vehicles — in addition to its significant critical minerals processing and refining capabilities. In any case, collaborating with these nations, instead of relying on the currently inadequate U.S. domestic landscape, will be critical to strengthening the LIB supply chain.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inadequate Chemistry Permitting Process&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several chemistry changes could improve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries, especially with regard to anodes. For instance, silicon could be used to replace all or some of the graphite to make the battery lighter and enhance its energy density, mitigating two key issues with LIB deployment as well as U.S. exposure to China’s dominance over global graphite production, which China could leverage in an escalation of trade tensions. Furthermore, additional LIB battery chemistry choices would present several advantages. First, critical mineral prices can have an impact on the chemistry choice. Given price volatility, a greater range of battery chemistry choices would enhance the market’s competitiveness and protect it against unforeseen shocks. Issues with critical mineral supplies could stem from black swan events unrelated to geopolitics, such as a natural disaster. However, given China’s hold over minerals and materials processing and refining — as well as the willingness of the government under President Xi Jinping to leverage export curbs to serve China’s foreign policy interests — expanding battery chemistry choices would also shield U.S. manufacturers and consumers from overdependence on Chinese inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, novel chemistry technologies must be brought swiftly to the market to be competitive. In addition, given current U.S. nearshoring and onshoring goals, it would be in the United States’ interests to foster a regulatory landscape that encourages additional diverse domestic chemistry manufacturing capabilities. However, current barriers concerning the review of new chemicals for commercial uses do not allow for timely deployment. In some cases, backlogs can result in unexplained regulatory approval delays of two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a study on permitting processes for clean technology deployment. When significant delays occurred, the GAO found the primary causes were usually insufficient funds and staff at permitting agencies. Addressing issues and delays in permitting requires retaining and expanding agency expertise and staffing in permitting and environmental review, providing clarity and guidance on necessary steps and information submissions during the permitting process, and enhancing interagency coordination and cooperation. However, setting up these additional capabilities may take time. U.S. permitting agencies may be better served by first setting up a fast-track process for permitting requests concerning green technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;alternative-lithium-ion-battery-technologies&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Alternative Lithium-Ion Battery Technologies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the world heavily relies on lithium-ion batteries as a source of energy for EVs, consumer appliances, and emergency backup systems, alternatives to this technology exist. These alternatives, when fully developed, could help the United States diversify its green energy portfolio and deliver performance and safety advantages to lithium-ion technology.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sodium-ion batteries: Probably the most promising of these novel battery types is sodium-ion batteries. As their name suggests, these batteries rely on sodium rather than lithium as the core ingredient for the electrolyte solution and the cathode. Extraction of the core ingredients in these batteries is very cost competitive, as sodium is roughly 1,000 times more prevalent in the Earth’s crust than lithium. In addition, these batteries use low-cost materials for cathodes, such as aluminum rather than copper foil. Advocates of a transition to sodium-ion batteries also argue that they are safer to transport, as they can be discharged to zero volts in transit, mitigating the risk of flammability.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;However, critics point to the fact that sodium-ion batteries currently have an energy range of only 140–160 watt-hours per kilogram (wh/kg) — far lower than the energy range of lithium-ion batteries (150–220 wh/kg). A vehicle running on current sodium-ion battery technology would therefore have to be charged far more often than a lithium battery, limiting the marketability of this technology. Sodium-ion batteries are also limited in terms of battery life: they last only 5,000 charging cycles, while the average lithium battery can bear 8,000–10,000 charging cycles. Nevertheless, these batteries could serve as a source of power for fleets of cheap EVs that operate over short-to-medium distances. Perceiving this opportunity, Chinese firm Jiangling Motors Group (JMG) recently released the first generation of electric cars powered by sodium-ion batteries in January 2024. These vehicles cost just $8,000 and are roughly 10 percent cheaper than the lithium-powered cars JMG sells. In short, sodium-ion batteries remain a strong contender, especially in the energy storage sector.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Lithium-sulfur batteries: Lithium-sulfur batteries use sulfur in the cathode and lithium in the anode. Extraction of core material for these batteries is less resource-intensive and relatively sustainable compared to lithium-ion batteries since sulfur is a by-product of natural gas processing and oil refining. While these batteries have nine times the energy density of lithium-ion batteries, they suffer from poor chargeability and face functionality issues after only 50 charging cycles. Still, businesses are hoping to commercialize the technology. In 2020, for instance, LG Energy Solutions piloted a drone that used the battery, and the company now aims to mass produce these batteries by 2027.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Solid-state batteries: Solid-state batteries rely on solid rather than liquid or aqueous electrolytes, common in traditional batteries. Two prevalent types of solid electrolytes are inorganic solid electrolytes, which use oxides and sulfides, and solid polymers, which use polymer salts. Solid-state batteries have a lower risk of battery failure than lithium-ion batteries. They are also more energy dense and have a faster charging cycle. However, they are more expensive to produce than lithium- or sodium-ion batteries. Due to high manufacturing costs, these batteries are used only in wearable electronics and home security devices. Nonetheless, researchers at Colorado-based Solid Power have designed sulfide electrolyte batteries that have twice the energy density of lithium-ion batteries. The firm aims to power 800,000 EVs per year with this technology by 2028.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A number of alternative chemistries are available to complement lithium-ion batteries in the push toward deploying renewable energy. Liquid metal and zinc-ion batteries also present attractive alternatives. As long as the shift toward electrification, the energy transition, and other battery-dependent markets continues to drive the need for energy storage, emerging technologies capable of alleviating the strains on associated material supply chains can provide invaluable benefits. This necessity becomes particularly pronounced as the spectrum of scenarios requiring energy storage expands within a swiftly electrifying energy landscape. The increasing diversity of applications presents an opportunity to investigate how novel technological solutions can effectively broaden or diminish mineral inputs to mitigate supply risks. In doing so, advancements in battery technology may also enhance performance and reduce costs compared to the dominant lithium-ion batteries currently available in the market.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inadequate Grid Capacity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the enactment of the IRA, energy specialists have advocated for regulatory adjustments to address grid issues. These adjustments include expediting permits for transmission line installation and facilitating the connection of new power plants to the grid. A report from Princeton University in 2022 revealed that over 80 percent of the IRA’s emissions reduction goals could be jeopardized if the expansion of transmission infrastructure does not accelerate beyond the current annual rate of approximately 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, the grid has suffered from underinvestment, making it challenging to authorize improvements that would place greater burdens on the grid. Concurrently, demand for electricity is escalating at a rate surpassing initial projections. A growing number of sectors and goods, such as smart appliances, data centers, and EVs, will require additional U.S. capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) assessed during a December 2023 webcast that U.S. power grids are anticipated to confront heightened vulnerability in the forthcoming years. This vulnerability arises from the dual factors of escalating peak demand and the retirement of aging generators. NERC depicted a problematic outlook for certain power markets in the United States, foreseeing capacity shortages due to the accelerated growth in demand propelled by widespread electrification, outpacing the pace of new generation capacity additions and the retirement of outdated facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployment of lithium-ion batteries will require a nationwide infrastructure that can withstand rapid electrification. Yet assessments of current U.S. grid capabilities show the grid is vastly unprepared to accommodate a broad switch to LIB-powered goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production of lithium-ion batteries and deployment of end uses face several challenges. The United States is currently prioritizing reshoring lithium-ion production capabilities over the green transition. This will slow down the country’s shift to renewables and hinder the United States’ ability to meet multilateral commitments. If the Biden administration wants to rectify this, a whole-of-government policy should be enacted. For starters, the United States should undertake the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize trade agreements to enable the green transition.&lt;/strong&gt; To accelerate LIB deployment, the Biden administration should focus on taking down barriers to trade on inputs for lithium-ion batteries, as well as the batteries themselves, between the United States and its allies. Eliminating MFN tariffs on goods related to lithium-ion batteries should be a high-priority item for nations with long-term environmental ambitions. One way to achieve that would be for the Biden administration to initiate negotiations for a non-MFN plurilateral specifically focused on batteries and their inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconsider barriers limiting the import of green technologies and their inputs.&lt;/strong&gt; High and broad tariffs on imports and exports have disrupted the LIB supply chain and the industries that rely on it — including green technologies. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative should take green transition priorities into account when it considers exemptions to tariffs, including the Section 301 tariffs on a broad swath of Chinese goods. For instance, the items critical to LIB manufacturing could be granted exemptions to support decarbonization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish an effective fast-track process for permitting the production of key green transition technologies.&lt;/strong&gt; An efficient Environemntal Protection Agency permitting process is critical to supporting the production and commercialization of green technologies. Current backlogs are hindering long-term U.S. environmental goals. Projects to produce items key to the green transition such as lithium-ion batteries — or inputs to these goods, such as developing alternative chemistries — should be placed on a fast-track permitting process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design future climate and infrastructure investments to renew funding for grid improvements.&lt;/strong&gt; The grid faces capacity shortages as demand surges, outpacing the rate of new generation capacity additions and the retirement of obsolete facilities. Past underinvestment has made authorizing improvements difficult. Simultaneously, electricity demand is escalating beyond initial forecasts, primarily driven by the proliferation of data centers and the expanding electrification of various economic sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s conflation of reshoring and de-risking objectives with the green transition has limited the country’s ability to decarbonize. The clean vehicle tax credit, for instance, hinders the act’s potential to spur demand for EVs by curbing critical minerals sourcing and final assembly options. In turn, shutting down economic partners’ opportunities to contribute to the U.S. decarbonization process harms the U.S. goal of strengthening critical supply chains through diversification. Moreover, embedding national security considerations in U.S. state-led investments further limits manufacturers of key goods such as lithium-ion batteries, given China’s dominance over green technology supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These contradictions are present at every level of the LIB supply chain, as outlined by the first two papers in this project. At the upstream end, U.S. failure to negotiate additional critical minerals agreements has hindered manufacturers’ ability to source eligible minerals and has exacerbated bitterness over IRA local content requirements, as discussed in the first two papers. Further along the supply chain, U.S. efforts to reshore cathode and anode active battery materials production have already run into debilitating workforce shortages. On the downstream end, tax incentives to spur demand for EVs — a key LIB end use — are also proving too restrictive to qualify a sufficient number of existing cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, policies based on reshoring are set to encounter shortcomings in the U.S. economy’s capabilities, which is already true when it comes to LIB manufacturing. For instance, the government’s permitting process and the nation’s electric grid infrastructure are overwhelmed. A readjustment of trade policies that favors fostering robust relationships with economic allies over reshoring, gradual de-risking policies over hasty decoupling, and state-led investments without geographic requirements, which may violate multilateral trade rules, will help usher in a carbon-neutral economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian F-16s will be challenged to independently create conditions for a much-desired breakthrough in the war with Russia. But with the right strategy, doctrinal approach, logistical support, and training, F-16s could provide a critical advance in enhancing Ukraine’s border defense and establishing localized air superiority, significantly bolstering Ukraine’s position on the ground. The underwhelming 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive, combined with finite Western materiel support, prompts the question: what role can Ukrainian F-16s play in 2024?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than a year marked by significant military maneuvers, 2024 may become a rebuilding period for both Ukraine and Russia. As in a rebuilding phase in sports, recently trained Ukrainian F-16 pilots will likely showcase periods of excellence while gaining vital experience that could lay the groundwork for lasting advantages over Russian forces. Consequently, the authors expect the impact of giving Ukraine F-16s in 2024 to be primarily strategic, offering long-term benefits rather than immediate tactical gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first section of this brief describes the strategic implications of giving F-16s to Ukraine. The next section describes the challenges expected during F-16 integration and their potential tactical influence on the battlefield in 2024. Finally, the authors offer a set of short- and long-term recommendations that policymakers can incorporate to complement the political aims of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)’s strategy to support Ukraine’s war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-i-strategic-impacts&quot;&gt;Part I: Strategic Impacts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opponents of the free world fear the airpower of the United States and its allies.&lt;/strong&gt; These air forces have been purposely built to strike strategic targets, counter the power of great armies and navies, and defend sovereign territory. They have been highly successful over the past 80 years. A significant portion of the power of these air forces comes from the technological superiority they possess over their adversaries, in addition to the might of their combined size across the alliance. The F-16 is the most prolific Western fourth-generation fighter jet produced, with thousands still in active service and highly upgraded versions still in production. Furthermore, as the mainstay of NATO air forces for decades, and with its impressive combat record, giving Ukraine such an iconic jet sends a strong message of U.S. and NATO commitment to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The capabilities of the F-16 enable Ukraine to hold more Russian targets at risk and, in turn, gain more leverage in the war and at the negotiation table.&lt;/strong&gt; To create a strategic “fleet in being” that Russia must respect, the size of the F-16 fleet matters. NATO countries have committed 65 F-16s to Ukraine. However, more are needed to give the Ukrainian Air Force more power to affect the ground war. As a simple starting point, NATO should be willing to replace all of Ukraine’s Soviet-era fighters with F-16s or equivalent NATO-standard aircraft and dramatically expand the size of Ukraine’s fighter fleet beyond pre-2022 strengths. Some estimates suggest that the size of Ukraine’s fighter fleet was only 69 aircraft in March 2023. By NATO standards, that number of aircraft may make up no more than three fighter squadrons (with 18 aircraft per squadron). Ukraine needs close to 12 fighter squadrons to achieve the air support needed for the war on the ground, with four squadrons primarily responsible for each core mission set: (1) suppression of enemy air defenses, (2) air interdiction, and (3) defensive counter air. This aim would require 216 F-16s, with 18 aircraft in each squadron. Additionally, NATO should have a reserve of F-16s available for resupply on demand, proportional to historical combat loss rates.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The well-known conventional strengths of the F-16 fit neatly within the core mission sets Ukraine needs to execute. Ukraine can leverage these advantages while placing the Russian forces in its territory at a disadvantage. Additionally, F-16s can carry a significant variety of weapons in the U.S. Air Force (USAF) inventory that are supported by an active and expanding industry. Alternatively, F-16s could increase the potency of Ukraine’s interdiction campaign in the Black Sea, further degrading the effectiveness of Russia’s Black Sea fleet or threatening the flow of sanctioned trade to and from Russian ports in the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The quantity of targets Ukraine can hold at risk with F-16s is a function of (1) the overall quantity of F-16s Ukraine receives, (2) the type and quantity of weapons it receives, (3) U.S. and NATO employment restrictions placed on Ukraine (i.e., restricting employment beyond Ukraine’s borders), (4) the fusion of intelligence between NATO and Ukrainian sources, (5) the proficiency of the pilots and support personnel that can optimize F-16 effectiveness, and (6) the air strategy Ukraine chooses to use for its F-16s (primarily for air defense or offensive missions such as strategic attack or interdiction of fielded forces and Russian logistics).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Additionally, giving Ukraine F-16s presents NATO and the United States with a unique opportunity to gather intelligence on the potency of allied aircraft and weapons against Russian and Iranian equipment and tactics. This could be leveraged as an opportunity to gather strategic intelligence as Russia reacts to the introduction of the F-16 and follow-on security packages of logistical support for use with the aircraft. With collaboration between Ukraine and NATO, these insights can inform NATO’s leaders of the viability of the alliance’s strategy and tactics in certain domains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giving F-16s to Ukraine is a significant step forward to further integrate the country into the U.S. and European economic and defense ecosystem, which will increase Ukraine’s strength in the long term.&lt;/strong&gt; Assuming the belligerent countries have equal will to fight, attritional wars are typically won by the side with the greatest economic and industrial strength and the greatest ability to manifest those strengths on the battlefield through more equipment, people, and ammunition. In The Wages of Destruction, Adam Tooze asserts that the economic and material strengths of the Allies in World War II overwhelmed Germany’s capacity to field enough equipment and people to resist the persistent assault over the long term. In 2020, the Ukrainian economy was about 9.5 times smaller than Russia’s ($155.5 billion compared to $1.5 trillion), and the Ukrainian population was 3.5 times smaller than Russia’s. For economies with equivalent levels of industrialization, industrial capacity roughly follows the measurements of gross domestic product and population.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Sustainment and reconstitution of warfighting formations, including aviation, is a challenge for Ukraine. Before the Russian invasion, Ukraine’s military used equipment mostly from the former Soviet Union, and many of the supply chains to repair or replace the equipment and its ammunition needs no longer exist or are controlled by Russia. Over time, these Soviet relics have lost their effectiveness as damage and shortages in parts and ammunition render them unfit for combat. The situation cannot support a positive outcome for Ukraine in a long attritional war. Therefore, supplying Ukraine with NATO or U.S. standard equipment is critical to sustain Ukrainian efforts because those weapon systems and Ukrainian operational needs can be integrated into U.S. and NATO supply chains. Over time, Ukraine would become more systemically integrated with NATO.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The U.S. resupply of Israel during the Yom Kippur War of 1973 shows how commonality of equipment becomes a strategic asset in sustaining forces during attritional wars.&lt;/strong&gt; The lessons from the Yom Kippur War should inform NATO decisionmakers of the value of supplying the Ukrainian Air Force with F-16s. During the war, a coalition of Arab countries led by Egypt strategically surprised Israel, leaving it little time to prepare for the invasion. Israel’s military doctrine called for preemptive air strikes similar to those it had used during the 1967 war to offset its quantitative disadvantages in personnel and equipment vis-à-vis its adversaries. However, U.S. national security advisor Henry Kissinger made clear that U.S. support was contingent on Israel receiving the first blow. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) plan and strategy depended upon preemptive strikes. When the option for a preemptive strike disappeared, Israel lost a significant advantage. The IAF paid dearly: it lost 15 percent of its total combat aircraft (60 aircraft) in less than 24 hours and about 35 percent of its total combat aircraft by the war’s end — catastrophic losses for any air force in such a short period. By the end of the first week of the war, Israel was in bad shape and gravely needed a resupply of ammunition, tanks, and aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Luckily, the IAF had modernized most of its fleet prior to the war with U.S.-made A-4 Skyhawks and F-4 Phantoms, also flown by the USAF and U.S. Navy (USN). Israeli prime minister Golda Meir asked the United States for assistance, which kicked off a large resupply effort, including Operation Nickel Grass, in which the United States provided Israel with large numbers of 155 mm howitzers, M-60 and M-48 main battle tanks, and 100 USAF F-4s and 36 USN A-4s to reconstitute the IAF inventory. Consequently, the resupply efforts by the United States to Israel outpaced those of the Soviet Union to the Arab coalition, allowing Israel to change the balance of the war enough to secure a negotiated settlement about 10 days after the first U.S. resupply.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, while F-16s alone will not provide air superiority, they are a vital component of this goal.&lt;/strong&gt; For more than 100 years, militaries have known air superiority is essential to the success of any conventional ground campaign, but World War II was the first time the technology and capacity of mass production existed at the degree necessary to demonstrate the merits of air superiority. Examples include the Germans during the Blitz of 1939–40, the UK Royal Air Force and U.S. Army Air Forces’ air campaign in Europe in 1944–45, Israel’s victory in the Six-Day War of 1967, and the swift U.S. defeat of Iraq in Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. In each case, casualties for the ground forces operating under air superiority were relatively low compared to those of their counterparts fighting without air superiority. Additionally, the tempo of ground campaigns improved significantly compared to the ground campaigns of World War I, in which each ground force maintained relative parity with others in terms of technology and the size of its army.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Per the USAF Air Force Doctrine Publication 3-01, control of the air is among the top priorities of the joint force and is classified into three categories: (1) air parity, (2) air superiority, and (3) air supremacy. The air war in Ukraine over the past two years is best classified as one of air parity, where no force controls the air for its own ends or faces significant interference. According to U.S. Air Force doctrine, air superiority is the “degree of control of the air by one force that permits the conduct of its operations at a given time and place without prohibitive interference from air and missile threats. Air superiority may be localized in space (horizontally and vertically) and in time, or it may be broad and enduring.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Air supremacy results when one side is incapable of effective air interference in the operating area, which the United States has generally enjoyed in conflicts over the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Today, each side of the war in Ukraine has a relatively robust air defense capability such that each can deny air superiority to the other. The missing component of air superiority for Ukraine is an offensive air capability, which the F-16s will begin to provide. Therefore, ground forces find themselves locked in relatively static battles of attrition, unable to create the conditions for a decisive maneuver campaign that could change the trajectory of the war. The robust Russian Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) makes establishing air superiority over the entire occupied territory a difficult feat. However, the Ukrainian Air Force can focus on establishing localized air superiority over limited areas for limited times. Such localized air superiority would be coordinated with Ukrainian land offensives to support a breakthrough operation and would be most effective with combined arms operations. Giving F-16s to Ukraine is an essential move toward establishing air superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Gaining air superiority enables the land component to bypass or maneuver through enemy forces and obstacle belts. Trench warfare exists on both sides because neither side has air superiority. However, trenches cannot stand up to the constant bombardment and might of 500–2,000-pound bombs, as demonstrated by the U.S. coalition in Operation Desert Storm, in which an air war lasting more than 40 days pulverized the Iraqi military to such a degree that it surrendered less than 100 hours after the start of the ground invasion. Likewise, tanks, artillery, and armored vehicles will succumb to cluster bombs, Maverick missiles, and 500–2,000-pound bombs. With air superiority, Ukraine’s F-16s can bring these effects to the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-ii-f-16-integration-challenges-and-tactical-influence-in-2024&quot;&gt;Part II: F-16 Integration Challenges and Tactical Influence in 2024&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukrainian Ground Forces has showcased its adeptness in assimilating cutting-edge Western weaponry into its arsenal with remarkable efficacy. Within its artillery corps, the Ukrainian Ground Forces phased out antiquated Soviet systems, replacing them with the technologically advanced M142 High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and accompanying munitions supplied by the United States. Following a three-week training regimen for M142 operators and maintainers, Ukrainian forces learned effective tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), enabling them to proficiently target Russian ammunition and fuel depots, bases, command and control nodes, and critical resupply infrastructure. While Ukrainian troops were familiar with various rocket launchers, HIMARS represents a substantial leap forward compared to Ukraine’s previous reliance on organic BM-30 Smerch and BM-27 Uragan systems, boasting superior capabilities including extended range, improved precision, enhanced mobility, and a faster rate of fire. While Ukraine’s successful integration of HIMARS presents tactical and operational challenges for Russia, mastering the integration of F-16s into the war strategy to produce impacts of a similar magnitude will be a formidable endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It will be years before the Ukrainian Air Force has enough experience to execute combat missions effectively. However, if supplied with the proper air-to-ground munitions, they will quickly be able to execute long-range strikes (air interdiction).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be years before the Ukrainian Air Force has enough experience to execute combat missions effectively. However, if supplied with the proper air-to-ground munitions, they will quickly be able to execute long-range strikes (air interdiction). Training a proficient F-16 pilot takes a long time. For instance, the training timeline for USAF fighter pilots, from initial flight training to certification as a combat-qualified wingman, spans three to four years. Furthermore, the total training duration extends to four to five years when factoring in leadership training essential for executing formations of fighter tactics in combat. While Ukrainian fighter pilots already possess basic airmanship skills, adapting to an aircraft with a fundamentally different cockpit interface and instrument layout, designed around a different concept of human factors engineering, requires an alternative way of thinking. This reality means experienced fighter pilots will also need time to transition effectively. Furthermore, their flying experience with Soviet-era fighter aircraft will not necessarily translate to the fly-by-wire controls and design of the F-16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kd9Tsgh.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully leverage the capabilities of the F-16, Ukrainian fighter pilots must become familiar with battle-proven TTPs honed over the past four decades. To make a significant combat impact, Ukrainian F-16 pilots must excel in three mission sets: offensive counter air/air interdiction (OCA/AI), offensive counter air/air operations–suppression of enemy air defenses (OCA/AO-SEAD), and defensive counter air (DCA). These mission sets will allow the Ukrainian Air Force to maximize the combat capabilities of the F-16 while not exposing them to higher combat losses executing more complex combat missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukraine must start flying combat sorties and build experience immediately.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning and applying Western TTPs proficiently will likely take Ukrainian fighter pilots over a year. As a historical reference, the United States delivered the first F-16s to Israel in 1980. Eleven months later, the IAF flew the new platform on a daring and successful air strike against an Iraqi nuclear weapons production plant. The IAF, despite the advantages of combat and Western tactics experience, chose to wait almost a year before employing the F-16. It takes time and experience to build the proficiency needed to employ a complex fighter effectively. Ukraine must start flying combat sorties and build experience immediately. Therefore, it will be difficult to measure the significant battlefield impacts of the F-16s until 2025, and expectations should be managed accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine must be able to organically maintain and repair the F-16s. One crucial lesson learned throughout U.S. military operations in Afghanistan was the vital role host-nation service members, rather than contractors, play in aircraft maintenance and repair. In Afghanistan, contractors predominantly handled maintenance support. Following the order to withdraw, their departure led to a significant decrease in mission-capable combat-ready aircraft. Similarly, the time, training, and experience required to cultivate proficient F-16 pilots are equally essential for developing competent F-16 maintainers. On average, it takes approximately five to eight years of on-the-job experience and rigorous certification (known in the USAF as “7-level” certification) to ensure the resident knowledge necessary for maintaining these aircraft. While not all maintainers are certified with “7-level” proficiency, the mid and upper levels of leadership, and their expertise, are essential to effective maintenance operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians must embrace a military culture in which all recommendations or voices are heard, specifically from the junior ranks. Ukraine’s impressive performance early in the war, and during the Kharkiv and Kherson counteroffensives, demonstrated its will and fighting ability. To capitalize on this fighting spirit, Ukraine must adopt NATO’s method to improve pilot performance and proficiency — specifically, a somewhat scientific and rigorous debrief of each flight. Reviewing the data recorded from each flight (“watching the tapes”) is crucial to this learning process. All aircrew are debriefed regardless of rank. Pride and ego must be sidelined to improve combat effectiveness and save lives. Furthermore, accurate battle damage assessment (BDA) should be reported back through the planning channels to maximize the efficiency of airpower by assigning strikes only to essential targets. Finally, this method of debriefing and the BDA feedback loop improve pilots’ rate of learning and the effectiveness of all air operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ukrainians must embrace a military culture in which all recommendations or voices are heard, specifically from the junior ranks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor doctrine presents a potential obstacle to maximizing the effectiveness of the F-16. Doctrine is a collection of best practices used to accomplish military objectives or effects. Ukraine should establish desired effects or objectives and then combine combat experience with Western TTPs to develop best practices. Rather than simply apply NATO or U.S. airpower doctrine, which is built around a robust command and control and resupply network, Ukrainians should own their doctrine while continuously improving it to confront the challenges from Russia on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once introduced on the battlefield, F-16s will increase the Ukrainian Air Force’s air-to-air capabilities. Leveraging its combat-proven radar, coupled with variants of the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, Ukraine will extend its maximum air-to-air engagement range up to 180 km. This is an appreciable engagement range improvement compared to Ukraine’s Soviet-era MiG-29 and Su-27 fighter aircraft. Additionally, Ukrainian F-16s can more effectively disrupt Russian close air support missions across contested battlefields. During the summer of 2023, Russian helicopters impeded and delayed the Ukrainian counteroffensive. With the introduction of the F-16, these helicopters will become vulnerable and less effective in supporting Russian defensive or offensive operations. Lastly, expect Ukrainian F-16s to suppress the long-range glide bombs tactics Russian fighters have adeptly used around Kharkiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The F-16 can improve Ukraine’s layered air defense, contributing to detection and elimination of incoming drones and missiles.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the F-16 can improve Ukraine’s layered air defense, contributing to detection and elimination of incoming drones and missiles. The recent successful defense of Israel against the Iranian assault of over 300 drones and missiles highlights the significance of this capability, as USAF F-15Es shot down over 70 drones. However, the effectiveness of this approach hinges significantly on the interoperability of Ukrainian doctrine and technological systems. In the short term, while Russian IADSs remain intact, the battlefield conditions will make close air support too risky for Ukrainian F-16s. Instead, the Ukrainian Air Force should incorporate the F-16 as another platform capable of long-range strikes with the British Storm Shadow or French SCALP. Ukraine has already received ground-launched small-diameter bomb (SBD) launchers and should likewise be given the air-launched versions for its F-16s. Dropping SDBs from F-16s would complicate the Russian air defense, provide more opportunities for successful long-range fires, and enable targeting time-sensitive targets similar to the HIMARS — and at a far more economical rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-iii-short--and-long-term-recommendations-to-capitalize-on-the-f-16s-advantages&quot;&gt;Part III: Short- and Long-Term Recommendations to Capitalize on the F-16’s Advantages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;short-term-recommendations-in-2024&quot;&gt;Short-Term Recommendations (in 2024)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To assist in the quality of learning, NATO should embed fighter pilots with Ukrainian Air Force units to aid with debriefing, learning, and mission planning, or set up virtual options for video footage review.&lt;/strong&gt; In February 2024, French president Emmanuel Macron opened the door to Western nations sending their troops to Ukraine, stating, “Nothing should be excluded.” Should future policy allow, NATO fighter pilots should aid Ukrainian aircrew and train them to review the tapes on every training or combat sortie to find lessons learned and improve tactics, techniques, and procedures. This tape review must be incorporated into the battle rhythm of Ukrainian fighter pilots. This will reinforce a culture of learning and ensure pilots provide and receive constructive feedback from every rank. Tape reviews increase tactical effectiveness and minimize losses. During review, learning is best achieved when individuals with the most expertise or proficiency lead the debrief, even if they do not hold the highest rank. Examples of this culture of debriefing may be found in the fighter and bomber units of the USAF and USN as well as within NATO air forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and NATO should authorize the use of cluster bomb munitions, GBU-39B SDBs, and Storm Shadow or SCALP missiles with the F-16s.&lt;/strong&gt; Specifically, the Cluster Bomb Unit (CBU)–87/89 and smart bomb equivalents (CBU-103/105) are most relevant for military targets in this context. A specific set of guidelines or restrictions on how the munitions may be used could be attached to the authorization of the weapons to minimize the risk of collateral damage. These weapons would aid in defending Ukrainian territory if Russia gains momentum toward a breakout on the battlefield. Cluster bomb munitions degrade and destroy large concentrations of personnel or equipment with fewer aircraft or strikes, while the SDB, Storm Shadow, and SCALP munitions can strike targets at great distances, improving the survivability of the employing aircraft. In 2023, Russia used attack helicopters with success to blunt the Ukrainian counteroffensive. If Russia can muster a breakout situation, it will require a concentration of personnel and equipment that cluster munitions are well suited to counter. Additionally, it is essential to include longer-range variants of the AIM-120 AMRAAM in the ammunition package. Enhanced air-to-air capabilities will bolster Ukraine’s capacity to deter Russia’s deployment of glide bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States and NATO should set up a permanent training rotation program for Ukrainian F-16 aircrew and maintainers.&lt;/strong&gt; After six months of combat, aircrew and maintainers should rotate to Ramstein Air Base for debriefing and the opportunity to rest and recuperate (R&amp;amp;R). After R&amp;amp;R, they should be allowed to refine their skill sets on a high-quality training range such as the Nevada Test and Training Range before returning to Ukraine for combat. The USAF and USN put their aircrew and maintainers through predeployment flying exercises to improve combat effectiveness, and these programs could be leveraged to provide Ukrainian units with a similar experience. For example, the USN saw dramatic improvements in combat effectiveness following the stand-up of the Navy Top Gun program during the Vietnam War, as evidenced by a 600 percent improvement to its aerial kill-to-loss ratio from Rolling Thunder (1968) to Linebacker (1972). The USAF had equivalent improvements to its combat effectiveness after the creation of Red Flag in 1975, in which the Air Force kill ratio hovered around 2:1 throughout the Vietnam War. In contrast, the USAF achieved 31 kills without a single loss in direct air-to-air combat in Desert Storm. Vastly improved training and doctrine account for a significant portion of the dramatic improvement to each service’s combat effectiveness. Following this logic, dedicating a unit at Nellis Air Force Base or another NATO base to orchestrate housing and training for Ukrainian aircrew and maintainers would make this initiative more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NATO should commit more F-16s in the next couple of months to bring its total commitment to at least 90.&lt;/strong&gt; This would allow Ukraine to convert five squadrons to F-16s (18 jets per squadron) using similar operations, maintenance, and sustainment practices as NATO units. For planning purposes, each additional set of 18 like-model F-16s would equate to another unit’s worth of aircraft. Since operational planning assigns missions and tasks to tactical units, the United States could help the Ukrainian Air Force by sending appropriately sized packages that can be seamlessly integrated into operations for improved efficiency. These numbers are the minimum needed and exclude aircraft needed for pipeline training and attrition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine should prioritize converting its units to F-16s based on criteria that will maximize the combat capability the F-16 brings to the Ukrainian Air Force in as little time as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; The authors recommend three actions to aid in this decision. First, prioritize the units that most need fighter aircraft and that are most capable of meeting the needs of Ukraine’s air strategy with the proper amount of aircraft and equipment. With these criteria, the equipment is the limiting factor — not the number of qualified people. Second, choose the unit currently assigned a mission that is the most similar to the anticipated role of the F-16 to capitalize on the culture, experience, and expertise ingrained in the people of the unit. Finally, access to higher-quality infrastructure and logistics will minimize the time aircraft sit grounded awaiting repairs or maintenance between missions. Therefore, picking a unit that already operates in a location with these features and remains beyond the range of most Russian air attacks will also aid Ukraine in reaping the dividends of the aircraft’s capabilities sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;long-term-recommendations-beyond-2024&quot;&gt;Long-Term Recommendations (Beyond 2024)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To substantially increase Ukraine’s chances of victory, NATO should give Ukraine the equipment it needs to establish air superiority within its national borders.&lt;/strong&gt; Providing F-16s is a step in the right direction toward this goal, but more equipment is needed. The authors estimate Ukraine needs 12 fighter squadrons of F-16s to significantly improve its position in the war. With 18 jets per squadron, this requires 216 F-16s on the front lines, and more should be placed in a reserve that can replace losses. Much has been written about the necessity of air superiority to support successful land campaigns. The remaining recommendations address helping Ukraine establish localized air superiority first, with broad and enduring air superiority as the eventual aim, to enable airpower’s subsequent use to support the land war.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should U.S. and NATO political commitments allow, establish a NATO-Ukraine undergraduate pilot training (UPT) exchange program similar to programs for NATO pilots through USAF UPT bases.&lt;/strong&gt; Alternatively, the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training Program could be modified to include Ukrainian pilots for a similar purpose but could also invest in building strategic relationships, with a multitude of NATO pilots going through the same program. Capturing Ukrainian talent early in their flying careers and training them with NATO methods and doctrine offers the greatest return on investment in the long term. This will result in a generational change of air doctrine that will take several years to bear fruit and, hence, a long-term strategic impact on integrating Ukraine into NATO methods.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more impact on Ukraine’s strategy, the United States and NATO should consider minimal restrictions on how Ukraine uses its F-16s.&lt;/strong&gt; The recent loosening of restrictions on munitions from the United States and other partners needs to continue with the inclusion of the F-16. Strikes should not be confined to Ukrainian territory. Ukraine may need to use its air force to interdict Russian logistics and forces or for strategic attack. Additionally, the Ukrainian Air Force may need other systems to strike IADSs positioned in Russian territory, beyond the operational range of Ukraine’s weaponry, to facilitate F-16 strikes. Such options may entail operations beyond Ukraine’s borders. Additionally, restricting the use of F-16s to attacks within Ukraine’s borders may result in a longer conflict such as the one the United States experienced throughout the Vietnam War until Operation Linebacker II, coupled with key diplomatic efforts led by the administration of U.S. president Richard Nixon, aggressively applied direct pressure to the leadership of North Vietnam. If Western support for Ukraine wavers, a longer conflict of attrition will favor Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States should flood the Ukrainian Air Force with F-16s and other aircraft by incorporating decommissioned U.S. aircraft from the boneyard or those divested from its force structure.&lt;/strong&gt; This recommendation is not novel; it echoes CSIS senior fellow Ben Jensen’s proposal in a Wall Street Journal commentary dated August 9, 2023. His insights remain pertinent and could be even more impactful today. Coupled with the ongoing manpower shortages facing Ukrainian forces, bolstering the Ukrainian Air Force’s capabilities is imperative. Introducing EA-6Bs, A-10s, C-12 Hurons, AH-1s, UH-1s, and MQ-8 Fire Scout helicopters would substantially augment Ukraine’s airpower. Leveraging existing artificial intelligence technology could transform many of these platforms into unmanned vehicles capable of complementing manned aircraft operations. This capability was demonstrated recently with the Air Force secretary riding in the front seat of a pilotless F-16 flight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not impose U.S. doctrine or methods of warfare onto the Ukrainian Air Force.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States has a lot of experience, but the Western way of war may not fit Ukraine’s methods or needs at this time. The U.S. role must be to impart hard-learned lessons, tried-and-true TTPs, and the capabilities and limitations of the F-16. Adaptation and understanding of the local realities and motivations is crucial to the success of a military strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure Ukraine can maintain and repair the F-16s.&lt;/strong&gt; Effective maintenance and robust supply support are indispensable for preserving the operational readiness of military equipment. To secure the sustained operational lifespan of fixed-wing platforms, a vigorous and ongoing training pipeline must run in parallel with pilot training, alongside the modernization of maintenance personnel. Furthermore, F-16 maintenance teams should establish direct connections to experts (utilizing telemaintenance), facilitating the swift access required to support combat-ready fighters in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Ukraine faces a critical juncture as its manpower, supplies, and ammunition reserves dwindle, providing an opportunity for Russia to seize momentum and exploit the West’s waning support. Adding the F-16 to the Ukrainian Armed Forces will assist in stalling Russia’s potential counteroffensive and further integrating Ukraine into the U.S. and European economic and defense ecosystem. This move also provides better sustainment of Ukraine’s air power, improves the security of its airspace, and increases Ukraine’s ability to hold more Russian targets at risk. It will take time to observe how Ukrainian F-16s affect combat operations. However, localized air superiority, followed by broad and enduring air superiority, should be the long-term goal, which will require more aircraft. Now is the time to ensure short- and long-term adjustments are made to partnership capacity in order for F-16s to play a critical role in 2024 and beyond. At the policy level, when addressing Ukraine’s capabilities and capacity, the United States must decide what type of Ukrainian armed force it wants to support. Is it a Ukraine that can defend, deter, or defeat Russia? Regardless of wanted outcomes, Ukraine needs more aircraft, and it needs them now.&lt;/p&gt;

Moldova is pursuing institutional reforms and alignment with the West while staring down the barrel of Russian aggression. Consolidated progress depends on five near-term factors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, a stark manifestation of post–Cold War tensions, has had a dramatic impact on Europe’s security and political landscape. Moldova, a small country sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, is at a historic crossroads. With a pro-Western government in power and a highly capable president at its helm, Moldova is poised for European integration but imperiled by its historic linkages with Russia and its proximity to the ongoing war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ukraine defends itself against a full-fledged Russian military invasion, Moldova is confronting a parallel Russian “hybrid war” that aims to destabilize the regime of President Maia Sandu and torpedo the country’s prospective alignment with the West. The political futures of both countries are now intertwined: Moldova’s independence will ultimately rely on Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russia’s kinetic aggression, and Ukraine’s chances of victory and post-war stability increase with the assurance of a resilient and reliable partner in Moldova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Moldova’s independence will ultimately rely on Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russia’s kinetic aggression, and Ukraine’s chances of victory and post-war stability increase with the assurance of a resilient and reliable partner in Moldova.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this context in mind, Moldova’s near-term fate will be determined by five factors: (1) whether the United States continues to provide assistance to Ukraine and Moldova, (2) whether Ukraine manages to hold off Russian forces on the battlefield, (3) whether Sandu is reelected this fall, (4) whether Moldova’s reform agenda and economic opening with the European Union continue to progress, and (5) whether Moldova is able to handle a slow-motion energy crisis coming in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the time for the West to “go big” on Moldova as an extension of its support for Ukraine’s war effort and the liberal democratic principles that underpin it. U.S. policymakers should view Moldova’s current pro-Ukrainian government and path to economic resilience as critical to Ukraine’s success in the war, given that the alternative — a pro-Russian or corrupt Moldovan leader — could thwart Moldova’s aspirations of Western alignment, leave Ukraine cornered, and ultimately dim Kyiv’s prospects for survival. As an end goal, Moldova should aspire for the success of Estonia — another post-Soviet state of relatively equal size, which is nonetheless four times richer, free of any dependency on Russian energy, a member of both the European Union and NATO, and home to a thriving democracy with a developed market economy and a firm handle on corruption. A bright future for Moldova is within reach, but it cannot get there without sustained international support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moldova is a landlocked country of approximately 2.5 million people, bordered by Ukraine to the east and Romania to the west. As a contested region once claimed by both the Ottoman and Russian Empires, the historically Romanian-speaking territory spent more than 100 years under Russian imperial rule between the early nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. After briefly uniting with neighboring Romanian-speaking territories under Greater Romania (1920–40), it was reannexed by the Soviet Union under the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviets and Nazi Germany and spent the next 51 years as a Soviet socialist republic. When Moldova gained its independence following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, “strong gravitational pulls from Romania and Russia” opened deep social divisions that continue to define the country’s major political fault lines. Moldova’s economic ties with Russia and the presence of a significant Russian-speaking minority have worked to Moscow’s advantage, but the resurgence of nationalism among the Romanian-speaking majority — 1 million of whom now carry Romanian passports — generated a powerful Moldovan-Romanian reunification movement that has clashed with Soviet nostalgia. Languishing in geopolitical uncertainty between Russia and Europe, the country has struggled to navigate its post-Soviet transition and failed to establish robust, functioning institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2024, Moldova is the second-poorest country in Europe after Ukraine, with a current GDP per capita of $7,490. In comparison, Estonia’s current GDP per capita is $31,850. Moldova’s economic potential has been stifled by institutional weakness, political dysfunction, endemic corruption, and Russian interference, which have long blocked its path to EU membership and pushed as many as 1 million Moldovans to emigrate in search of better opportunities abroad. Russian pressure campaigns have further boxed the country in, using Moldova’s dependencies as a lever to keep the country within the Kremlin’s sphere of influence. Internal divisions within Moldova have been an additional source of Russian influence and obstacle to reform: pro-Russian sentiments have felled all previous Western-leaning governing coalitions and remain politically salient in the autonomous Gagauzia region as well as in the breakaway region of Transnistria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Two watershed events have recently shifted the winds in favor of Moldova’s European integration and transformation into a free-market economy: the election of pro-Western Sandu as president in 2020 and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two watershed events have recently shifted the winds in favor of Moldova’s European integration and transformation into a free-market economy: the election of pro-Western Sandu as president in 2020 and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Sandu, a Harvard graduate and former World Bank staffer, is widely considered to be the strongest leader in Moldova’s 30-year history. Her Eurocentric vision and record of uncompromising integrity have put Moldova on a clear path toward democratic accountability and economic prosperity. Sandu’s Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) has launched an aggressive and ambitious reform agenda. This agenda is aimed at bringing the country’s institutions in line with those of the European Union, with a particular focus on overhauling the judiciary and rooting out corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Moldovan government has also supported Ukraine without formally renouncing the country’s constitutionally enshrined neutrality. It has responded to the invasion by condemning the Kremlin’s aggression, imposing unofficial sanctions on Russia, and cracking down on Russian media manipulation. Moldova has also accepted more Ukrainian refugees per capita than any other country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether Moldova maintains its trajectory of rapid growth or slows significantly will depend on the next six months. Sandu’s government has achieved a degree of progress unique in the country’s history, but this momentum cannot be sustained without greater Western engagement. As the Moldovan government grapples with Russian-incited political turmoil, the slow pace of institutional reform, and the economic shocks associated with the war in Ukraine and the decoupling of Moldova’s economy and energy grid from Russia, the country’s path to EU accession may get derailed. Moldova’s future will ultimately turn on the results of the November election and upcoming referendum on EU accession, the resilience of its new energy supply, and the steadfastness of the West’s support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sandu’s government has achieved a degree of progress unique in the country’s history, but this momentum cannot be sustained without greater Western engagement.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-the-united-states-continue-aiding-ukraine-and-moldova&quot;&gt;Will the United States Continue Aiding Ukraine and Moldova?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than nine months after U.S. president Joe Biden first requested supplemental aid for Ukraine’s armed forces, Congress passed a $95.3 billion foreign aid bill in late April that included $61 billion for Ukraine and an additional $25 million for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to support the recovery of reclaimed Ukrainian territory and assist resilience efforts in Moldova. The earmarking of aid for Moldova reflects an awareness of the two countries’ interdependence in the conflict; given Ukraine’s frosty relationship with its other neighbors, strengthening Moldova is critical not only for Ukrainian port access but also for the advantages of a friendly neighbor with shared ambitions of Western alignment. Although it was a major victory, the long-overdue passage of the bill underscored the fragility of U.S. support for Ukraine. After breezing through the Democrat-controlled Senate with a 70 percent vote in favor, the legislation faced a much chillier reception in the Republican-controlled House, leaving Ukraine and Moldova in dangerous suspense while an emboldened Russia began revving up its air assaults and testing for weak spots along the front line. The stated reasons for the delay included a growing wariness of Ukrainian corruption and increased opposition to subsidizing foreign conflicts with taxpayer dollars, with a strong contingent of hard-right Republicans being the major obstacle. Republicans insisted on a number of “important innovations” to the bill, including options to provide loans rather than grants, use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine, and ramp up U.S. natural gas exports to squeeze Russia’s budget revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vm4qg4H.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concerns that held up this most recent aid package may still derail future assistance efforts. Ukraine will require steadfast U.S. backing for the remainder of the conflict and for the country’s reconstruction, but the current appetite for such support in Congress is low. Without greater efforts to mobilize a higher level of engagement and political support for Ukraine, this $61 billion aid deal will “almost certainly [be] the last package of such magnitude.” The uncertainties associated with the potential outcomes of the U.S. presidential and congressional elections this November exacerbate the challenge of building a favorable consensus on Ukraine. With both chambers of Congress expected to flip and majorities likely to remain slim, the leadership and composition of key congressional committees will shift, leaving support for Ukraine at the mercy of new partisan logjams. The implications of a possible change in administration present another hurdle. Former president Donald Trump — the presumptive Republican nominee — has said that any additional assistance to Ukraine would be made conditional on issuing aid in the form of a loan and greater burden sharing, namely the requirement that NATO members divert 2 percent of their budgets toward defense. If Western allies fail to step up, a Trump administration could attribute a future cessation of or reduction in U.S. support for Ukraine to European countries’ inability or unwillingness to meet their defense commitments. Experts have warned that there is “no substitute” for Washington’s military and financial firepower — as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky stressed in early April, Ukraine “will lose the war” if Congress shuts off the tap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-ukraine-manage-to-hold-off-russian-forces-on-the-battlefield&quot;&gt;Will Ukraine Manage to Hold Off Russian Forces on the Battlefield?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years after Russia’s full-scale invasion captured nearly a quarter of the country, the stakes could not be higher for Kyiv. After a string of victories in 2022, the Ukrainian military now finds itself dug in, outgunned, and outnumbered against a larger and more powerful opponent. As the war enters its third year, Kyiv is facing critical shortages of manpower, ammunition, and money amid intense attacks on the country’s energy infrastructure. Defense experts widely predicted that the conflict was headed for a stalemate after the Ukrainian military’s much-anticipated summer counteroffensive failed to yield any breakthroughs in 2023. That projection now appears optimistic: Russian forces seized the embattled city of Avdiivka in mid-February, and the Kremlin continues to mobilize Russia’s defense industry to maintain momentum on the front lines. New reports suggest that Russian forces “may soon be able to fire 5,000 artillery rounds a day,” while their Ukrainian counterparts have been able to meet only 10 percent of their ammunition needs. Although the long-awaited approval of additional U.S. aid will help relieve pressure on the Ukrainian military, significant damage has already been done to Ukraine’s war effort. The dynamics of the war have changed dramatically in the past nine months, and growing concerns about Ukraine’s military strategy and overall chances of victory are contributing to waning support for Ukraine in Congress. Even if Kyiv embraces a more defensive long-term strategy, Ukraine’s need for help remains open-ended — and it remains uncertain whether Washington or Brussels will heed the call moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential collapse of Ukraine’s war effort has significant implications for Moldova as one of the probable next targets of Russian military adventurism against former Soviet states. Just as the Kremlin began planting narratives to justify the 2014 invasion of Crimea during its 2008 invasion of Georgia, Russia’s criticism of Moldova’s “Western capture” represents “the telegraphing of foreign policy goals that have in the past been chased with Russian aggression.” Moldova, which ranks 144th out of 145 analyzed countries in military strength globally, is within direct missile and drone range of the Ukrainian conflict. Odessa is only an 111-mile drive from the Moldovan capital of Chisinau, closer together than Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. Transnistria provides an obvious corridor for a Russian invasion, particularly given the presence of roughly 1,500 Russian soldiers in the region. Russian president Vladimir Putin has spoken openly about reaching Transnistria through Ukraine, meaning that a break in the Ukrainian lines would leave Moldova defenseless. Without foreign aid, Ukraine’s front line will crumble and take Moldova with it — putting Russian troops right on the border of NATO and the European Union, a development that is not in the interests of the United States or its partners and allies. In the meantime, the recent sale of French airspace monitoring systems to Moldova and Estonia’s efforts to support Moldova’s cyber defense capabilities provide examples of ways in which the West can help Moldova modernize its military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Without foreign aid, Ukraine’s front line will crumble and take Moldova with it — putting Russian troops right on the border of NATO and the European Union, a development that is not in the interests of the United States or its partners and allies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-president-sandu-win-reelection-this-fall&quot;&gt;Will President Sandu Win Reelection This Fall?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moldova is set to hold presidential elections on October 20, 2024. There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic about Sandu’s chances of reelection: the president’s approval rating reportedly increased from 40 percent in 2022 to 46 percent in 2023, and current polls put her ahead of the opposition candidate Igor Dodon, the leader of the pro-Russian Party of Socialists. At the same time, the electoral margins appear worryingly thin compared with 2020. A December 2023 poll shows Sandu leading the presidential race 30 percent to 24 percent over Dodon, who has gained 8 percentage points since September. Yet although she is projected to win the first round, Sandu is projected to lose the second — not only to Dodon (35 percent to 46 percent) but also to the next-highest-ranking opposition candidate, Ion Ceban (34 percent to 42 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is especially precarious in light of Russia’s disruption of previous elections and the uncovering of a Kremlin-backed coup plot in early 2023. The stakes of this election virtually guarantee Russian destabilization efforts, either to rig the results in Dodon’s favor or, in the case of a PAS victory, to discredit the electoral outcome. Moldovan authorities and independent media investigators have exposed the extent of Russia’s interference campaign, which includes cyberattacks, weaponized disinformation, and Russian-sponsored public protests. The “unprecedented levels of Russian interference” in Moldova’s recent local elections can be considered a test run for larger-scale disruption efforts this fall. The information war within Moldova ultimately favors Russia, not Moldova. Since the country’s independence, Moldovan institutions have been weak — victims of Russian undermining, plundering by oligarchs, and the brain drain of mass emigration. These challenges have weakened the pro-reform government’s ability to counter malign narratives. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that many of Moldova’s native Russian speakers look to Russian sources for their news. Even though the Kremlin-backed news channels were banned in Moldova in mid-2022, the replacement of these networks with more balanced Russian-language programming has been slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-moldovas-economic-opening-with-the-european-union-and-reform-agenda-continue-to-progress&quot;&gt;Will Moldova’s Economic Opening with the European Union and Reform Agenda Continue to Progress?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the outcome of the upcoming presidential election, Moldova’s near-term future hinges on its ongoing economic opening with the European Union and its ability to execute the requisite reforms that will keep the country on track for EU accession. By all accounts, Moldova’s progress toward European integration is the one area in which Sandu and the PAS have seen “unmitigated success,” but the slow pace of institutional reforms has left the public agitated. The high hopes that followed the PAS’s initial victory have now been offset by several years of turbulence. Since 2020, Moldovan society has been rocked by the Covid-19 pandemic, an energy crisis, an influx of Ukrainian refugees, supply chain disruptions, and the loss of traditional markets. Taken together, these challenges have overshadowed the government’s comparatively subtle steps toward long-term development. Like Ukraine, Moldova’s path to EU membership is steep, requiring major administrative, political, judicial, and economic reforms, as well as the alignment of domestic laws and standards with those of the European Union. These major structural changes will take time to crystallize; as growing pains test public patience and put pressure on Sandu, the country’s visible rapprochement with the European Union has become her strongest source of political capital. Sandu’s pledge to make Moldova “a full member of the European family by 2030” appears more in reach than ever: although Moldova remains in an “early stage” of the reform process, the European Commission’s approval of the country’s liberal trajectory prompted the European Council to open formal accession negotiations with both Moldova and Ukraine on December 14, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If domestic reforms and deeper economic engagement with Europe continue to move forward without further disruptions, Moldova’s entry into the European Union by 2030 might be possible. Russian subversion efforts have not managed to dim public support for the bloc: recent polls conducted by the International Republican Institute (IRI) found that 63 percent of Moldova’s population pins the country’s future on EU membership, and 67 percent ranks the European Union as Moldova’s most important economic partner. Forty-two percent of adults also believe that Moldova is moving in the right direction — a 14-point increase from IRI’s 2022 poll and the highest it has been in nearly a decade. Given the divisions within Moldovan society and the volatility of its political landscape, Sandu has moved to capitalize on favorable winds by announcing a referendum on EU accession this November. By focusing the government’s efforts on her most popular issue, Sandu is more likely to assuage those whose support for EU integration outweighs any current dissatisfaction with the PAS. One of the reasons that polling on EU membership is higher than PAS favorability is the fact that many Russian speakers, including some of Transnistria’s leaders and business elite, stand to benefit from European integration and are supportive of deeper EU-Moldovan relations. In light of Moldovan ambivalence toward Russia and the risks of a pro-Russian backlash, the European Union can support Moldova’s trajectory by prioritizing accession talks, extending support for ongoing reforms, and making additional efforts to strengthen EU-Moldovan trade, thereby offering the population a preview of the advantages of EU membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-moldova-handle-a-slow-motion-energy-crisis-coming-in-december-2024&quot;&gt;Will Moldova Handle a Slow-Motion Energy Crisis Coming in December 2024?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, Moldova sourced 100 percent of its energy from Russian gas delivered through Ukraine to Transnistria, the site of the country’s only power plant. Although Transnistria received the gas for free, with associated revenues constituting the bulk of the region’s income, Russia billed the Moldovan government for the costs. This arrangement gave Russia an annual opportunity to strong-arm Moldova for concessions by dangling the threat of price hikes and throttled gas supplies. The unbundling of Moldova’s energy sector became a top government priority after the invasion of Ukraine, which plunged Moldova into its worst energy crisis since its independence. Last fall, the government broke Moldova’s dependence on Russian gas by drawing on a pipeline running through Romania, and it also conducted an audit that disproved the country’s debt to Russian energy giant Gazprom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts have dashed Russia’s “gas blackmail” in all but one area: 70 percent of Moldova’s electricity still comes from the Russian gas-powered plant in Transnistria. While the path toward long-term energy independence — including the development of renewable energy alternatives — will take time, more immediate efforts can be made to accelerate Moldova’s integration into the European energy grid through projects such as the EU-backed construction of new electric transmission lines between Moldova and Romania. Current initiatives will need to accelerate before the year’s end: Russia’s contract with Ukraine to transport gas via pipelines in Ukrainian territory will expire on December 31, 2024, and failure to replace it could trigger a second energy crisis and mass emigration. Furthermore, because Transnistria will no longer be receiving heavily subsidized Russian gas, the potential collapse of the region’s economy risks leaving Moldova with another refugee crisis that it is ill equipped to handle, as Transnistria’s residents pour over the banks of the Nistru river in search of opportunities. The international community must make every effort to ensure the operability of new electricity networks, help Romania increase its electricity production, and support Moldova’s own domestic capacity. This planning and negotiation must include Transnistria, both in negotiation with Transnistrian leaders to continue using the region’s electrical plant with gas supplied from non-Russian sources and in ensuring that there is a plan to help support the Transnistrian economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Western investments in both Ukraine and Moldova over the next several months have an enormous potential for return — a democratic and prosperous Moldova supports a free and open Eastern Europe, and Moldova’s pro-Western government offers a strategic opportunity to usher a country deprived of democracy into the European fold and create a template for good governance in the region. The end state for Moldova is a flourishing democracy with a strong GDP, resilient institutions, energy independence, full EU membership, and the protection of regional security partnerships with Romania and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-the-future&quot;&gt;In the future…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;States will integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) into their national security enterprises to gain decision advantages over their rivals.&lt;/strong&gt; The question will not be if a web of algorithms extends across the military, intelligence community, and foreign policy decisionmaking institutions, but how lines of code interact with the human clash of wills at the heart of strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New technology will change the character but not the nature of statecraft and strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; States will still combine diplomacy, economic coercion, and influence campaigns with threats of military force to signal rivals and reassure allies. Human decisionmaking, while augmented by algorithms, remains central to strategy formation and crisis management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information about AI/ML capabilities will influence how states manage escalation.&lt;/strong&gt; Escalation risks will continue to emerge from how warfighting changes the balance of information available to update models and support human decisionmaking. Intelligence gaps on adversary algorithms increase the likelihood of escalation but only once states have crossed the Rubicon and fight beneath the nuclear threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will the adoption of AI/ML across a state’s national security enterprise affect crisis decisionmaking? For example, what would the Cuban Missile Crisis look like at machine speed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond current policy debates, congressional testimony, new strategies, and a drive to identify, test, and evaluate standards, there is a fundamental question of how computer algorithms will shape crisis interactions between nuclear powers. Further, will refined AI/ML models pull people back from the brink or push them over the edge during crises that are as much about fear and emotion as they are rational decisionmaking? How will humans and machines interact during a crisis between nuclear powers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This edition of On Future War uses a series of wargames as an experiment to analyze how players with 10 or more years of national security experience approach crisis decisionmaking given variable levels of knowledge about a rival great power’s level of AI/ML integration across its national security enterprise.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, the CSIS Futures Lab held a series of crisis simulations in early 2023 analyzing how AI/ML will shape the future of deterrence. The games — designed as a randomized control trial — explored human uncertainty regarding a rival great power’s level of AI/ML integration and how this factor affected strategic stability during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two major findings emerged. First, across the simulations, varying levels of AI/ML capabilities had no observable effect on strategy and a general trend of trying to combine multiple instruments of power when responding to a crisis. While data science and the use of AI/ML to augment statecraft will almost certainly be a defining feature of the near future, there appear to be constants of strategy that will survive the emergence of such new technologies. Diplomacy, economic coercion, and influence campaigns will survive even as machines collect and process more information and help shape national security decisionmaking. AI/ML will augment but not fundamentally change strategy. That said, there is an urgent need to start training national security professionals to understand what AI/ML is and is not, as well as how it can support human decisionmaking during foreign policy crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, how nations fight in the shadow of nuclear weapons will change as states selectively target the battle networks of their rivals. Even though the perceived risk of escalation is not likely to be affected by the balance of AI/ML capabilities, the criteria used to select flexible response options will change. States will need to balance countering adversary algorithms with ensuring that they do not blind an adversary and risk triggering a “dead-hand” — a fast and automated system developed by the Soviet Union to launch nuclear weapons — escalation spiral. This need to strike the right balance in military targeting will put a new premium on intelligence collection that maps how rival states employ AI/ML capabilities at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. It could also change how states approach arms control, with a new emphasis on understanding where and how AI/ML capabilities augment crisis decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deterrence-battle-networks-and-aiml&quot;&gt;Deterrence, Battle Networks, and AI/ML&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern deterrence literature focuses on how states bargain, short of war, through threats and commitments. These signals change how each side calculates the costs and benefits of going to war, implying that the less information each side has about the balance of capabilities and resolve, the harder it becomes to encourage restraint. Signaling and communication play a central role in how states seek to manipulate risk to deny an adversary an advantage, including incentives for seeking a fait accompli by military force. Even literature that stresses the psychological and cultural antecedents that shape how foreign policy leaders approach crisis diplomacy share this emphasis on the central role of information. Rational calculations break down based on past information (i.e., how beliefs shape expectations) and flawed weighting (e.g., bias and prospect theory).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In modern military planning and operations, information is managed through battle networks. The ability to conduct long-range precision strikes and track adversary troop movements all rests on aggregating and analyzing data. This logic is a foundation for the Coalition Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) network, which is designed to push and pull data across distributed networks of sensors and shooters connected by faster communication, processing, and decision layers informed by AI/ML. The network is the new theory of victory at the center of the new Joint Warfighting Concept, which prioritizes synchronizing multidomain effects in time and space. For this reason, information is now a key component of military power and, by proxy, a state’s ability to bargain with a rival. The more information a state can process, assisted by algorithms, the more likely it is to identify windows of opportunity and risk as well as align ends, ways, and means to gain a relative advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, most of the emerging literature on AI/ML and the future of war focuses more on risk and ethical considerations than bargaining advantages. First, multiple accounts claim that AI/ML will create new risks, including “flash wars,” and are likely to produce destabilizing effects along multiple vectors. The thinking goes that the new era of great power competition will be marked by an “indelicate balance of terror” as Russia, China, and the United States race to acquire technological game changers. To the extent that AI/ML alters military power, it could affect how states perceive the balance of power. As perceptions about power and influence change, it could trigger inadvertent escalation risks. Inside the bureaucracy, defense planners could rely on brittle and black-boxed AI/ML recommendations that create new forms of strategic instability. At the tactical level, the speed of autonomous weapons systems could lead to inadvertent escalation while also undermining signaling commitment during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two issues with these claims. First, arguments about the destabilizing role of AI/ML have yet to be explored beyond literature reviews, alternative scenarios, and illustrative wargames designed more for gaining perspective than for evaluating strategy. In other words, hypotheses about risk and escalation have not been tested. Second, accounts about emerging technology and inadvertent escalation often discount the role of increased information in reducing tensions. To the extent that algorithms applied across a battle network help reduce uncertainty, they are likely to support deterrence. You can never lift the fog of war, but you can make weather forecasts and describe what is known, unknown, and unknowable. This alternative logic sits at the foundation of the “wargame as an experiment” the CSIS Futures Lab constructed to analyze how AI/ML could affect strategic stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;would-you-like-to-play-a-game&quot;&gt;Would You Like to Play a Game?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the CSIS Futures Lab conducted two tabletop exercises exploring a crisis scenario involving AI/ML’s effect on strategic decisionmaking. The tabletop exercise focused on a crisis involving a third-party state between two rivals, each of which had nuclear weapons and a second-strike capability. The rival states in the exercise were abstracted to remove bias about current rivalries that define the international system, thus reducing, but not eliminating, the risk of confounding factors skewing gameplay. As a result, players made choices about how to respond to a crisis and which elements of a rival state’s battle network (i.e., CJADC2) to target. The games consisted of 29 individual players, each with over 10 years of national security experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Players all had at least 10 years of national security experience&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Players randomly assigned into different treatment groups&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Three rounds of crisis interactions, moving from competition to the early stages of a military conflict&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game design adapted an earlier tabletop exercise used to study modern competition and cyber escalation dynamics known as Corcyra. This game put players in a fictional scenario involving a crisis standoff between two nuclear rivals: Green State and Purple State over a small state, Orange State. Green State and Orange State are treaty allies. Purple State and Orange State have a maritime territorial dispute. Players, assuming the role of Green State, make decisions about the best mix of flexible deterrent (competition) and flexible response options as the crisis unfolds. The game scenario — involving a territorial dispute, enduring rivalry, and alliance networks — built in dynamics associated with escalation to focus on low-probability, high-consequence foreign policy events. The use of fake countries seeks to make players less likely to introduce bias in the results based on prior beliefs about current powers such as the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unknown to the players, Purple State’s moves and decisions were predetermined to walk players up the escalation ladder, a technique known in the wargame community as a 1.5-sided design. This game design captures the uncertainty and interactive complexity (i.e., reaction, counteraction) of two-sided games but better supports capturing and coding observations about player preferences and assessments of risks and opportunities. Applied to Corcyra, a 1.5-sided game design enabled the CSIS Futures Lab to collect data on how players made decisions about competition and conventional conflict in the shadow of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the game proceeded, players were randomly assigned into two different treatment groups and led into different rooms with a facilitator. Each group was given an identical game packet that included an overview of the crisis and military balance between Green State and Purple State as well as the standing policy objectives for Green State to deter Purple State’s actions against its treaty allies while limiting the risk of a broader war (i.e., extended general deterrent). The only difference between the two groups was in the intelligence estimate of the extent of Purple State’s AI/ML capabilities in relation to Green State. As seen in Table 1, this difference meant that everything was constant (e.g., military balance, policy objectives, and Purple State’s actions across the game) except for the knowledge the players received about their rival’s level of AI/ML capabilities. This design reflects a factorial vignette survey, controlling for whether AI/ML capability is known or unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the game, each group (i.e., Treatment A and B) responded to a set of adversary escalation vignettes. Unknown to the participants was that each subsequent move would see their rival escalate and move up the escalation ladder to ensure a more dynamic interplay between current decisionmaking and maintaining sufficient forces and options for future interactions. The design also ensured that players were forced to confront the threat of conventional strikes on the nuclear enterprise and the limited use of nuclear weapons in a counterforce role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/V6FPvbW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Excerpts from the Corcyra Game Packets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first round of the game dealt with flexible deterrent options and crisis response. Afterwards, each group received a brief about a crisis — between their treaty ally (Orange State) and nuclear rival (Purple State) — and each player (Green State) was asked to craft a response using multiple instruments of power (e.g., diplomatic, informational, military, and economic) by picking three options from a menu of 24 preapproved flexible deterrent options. Each instrument of power had six response options based on the implied level of escalation. This design allowed the CSIS Futures Lab to see if varying levels of AI/ML capabilities had an effect on how players approached competition and campaigning as part of a larger deterrent posture. Specifically, it allowed the research team to test how the capability affected overall competition strategy and escalation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second round began with a limited military strike by Purple State on Orange State. Players were briefed that Purple State conducted a series of limited strikes on an airfield and naval base in Orange State. Orange State intercepted 50 percent of the cruise missiles in the attack, but the remaining 20 — fired from a mix of Purple State aircraft and naval warships — damaged an Orange State frigate, downed two maritime patrol aircraft, and destroyed an ammunition depot. Initial reports suggested that as many as 20 Orange State military personnel were killed in action, with another 30 wounded. There were also four Green State military advisers working on the base at the time who were killed in the attack. The attacks coincided with widespread reports of global positioning system (GPS) denial, jamming, and cyber intrusions in both Orange State and Green State. Purple State said the attack was limited to the military facility Orange State had used in past provocations, but it vows broader attacks if Orange State or Green State responds. In this manner, Purple State’s conventional military response reflected core concepts in modern military theory about multidomain operations, joint firepower strikes, and sixth-generation warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After receiving this intelligence update, players were asked to nominate flexible response options. First, the players had to recommend which of the military responses from the menu of 24 options they recommended in response to a limited military strike by Purple State on Orange State. Players also had to specify which layer of Purple State’s battle network they wanted to affect through their recommended response: sensing, processing, communicating, decision, or effectors. This game design limited the range of options open to players to support statistical analysis and comparison between the two treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third round examined if players adjusted their military response options to conventional strikes on their nuclear enterprise. Players were briefed that Purple State conducted a series of conventional strikes against Orange State and Green State. In Orange State, the strikes targeted major military facilities and even the Orange State leadership (both military and civilian) with a mix of cruise missiles, loitering munitions, and special operations forces (SOF) raids. The attacks included striking Green State intelligence satellites and major early-warning radars as well as key airfields where Green State keeps the majority of its strike and bomber aircraft squadrons. The mass precision conventional strikes — launched largely by a mix of long-range strike and bomber aircraft and submarines — also targeted key port facilities in Green State used to reload vertical launch cells and support Green State submarine forces. Orange State lost over 30 percent of its military combat power and 50 percent of its civilian critical infrastructure related to water treatment, energy, and telecommunications. Its leaders survived the decapitation strikes but are enacting continuity of government protocols. Green State has suffered 10 percent attrition in its air and naval forces. Purple State has threatened that it may be forced to expand strikes, to include using nuclear weapons, if Green State conducts additional military strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-the-game-revealed-about-the-future-of-deterrence&quot;&gt;What the Game Revealed about the Future of Deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;flexible-deterrent-options&quot;&gt;Flexible Deterrent Options&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the game, each player had three options from any category (i.e., diplomatic, informational, military, or economic) to choose. Table 2 summarizes how frequently each player selected flexible response options linked to different instruments of power during the initial crisis response (i.e., Round 1). Analyzing these choices provides a window into how players with at least 10 years of national security experience approached the “ways” of crisis management toward the “end” of reestablishing deterrence. If AI/ML is inherently more escalation prone, one would expect to see a statistically significant difference between the treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatments. The balance of AI/ML capabilities did not alter how players approached their competitive strategy and crisis management. Across the treatments, players developed an integrated approach, often choosing multiple instruments of power to pressure their rival, as opposed to focusing on a strictly military response. No player in either treatment used only a singular instrument of power, such as only responding with military options. On the contrary, over 60 percent of players in each treatment selected multiple instruments of power. In other words, the level of AI/ML capabilities between rivals did not directly alter early-stage crisis response and the development of flexible deterrent options designed to stabilize the situation and reestablish deterrence. This finding runs contrary to perspectives that see AI/ML as inherently escalatory and risk prone. While AI/ML will augment multiple analytical processes from the tactical to the strategic level, national security leaders will still make critical decisions and seek ways to slow down and manage a crisis. The risk is likely more in how people interact with algorithms during a crisis than in the use of data science and machine learning to analyze information and intelligence. AI/ML does not pose risks on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/WhstiFg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Selected Deterrent Options&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During discussions in Round 1 for Treatment A (AI/ML Capabilities Known), players focused more on strategy as it relates to shaping human decisionmaking. In the first round, participants were divided over whether Purple State’s actions were hostile or not but conceded that Purple State was attempting to signal that Green State’s actions in the region were unwarranted. Of note, this focus on signaling was more about human intention than algorithmic assessments. The players generally saw the crisis as about human leaders in rival states seeking advantage through national security bureaucracies augmented by AI/ML capabilities. In their discussions, humans were in the loop and focused on finding ways to de-escalate the crisis without signaling weakness. The discussion was less about how algorithms might skew information and more about how to have direct communication and clear messages passed through diplomats to other human leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic drove the players to focus on developing the situation through diplomatic outreach while increasing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets in the region. Although participants agreed upon the utility of diplomacy as a response to the crisis, they diverged in their opinion on whether the efforts should publicly call for de-escalation or privately use third parties or influence campaigns to warn Purple State’s elites about further escalation. Group members widely supported increasing ISR assets in the region to provide early warning of future Purple State military deployments and increase protection of friendly communications and intelligence-collection assets. Additionally, group members sought to privately share intelligence with allies in the region. Again, AI/ML was less a focal point than a method to gain better situational awareness and identify the best mechanisms for crisis communication with the rival state (i.e., private, public, or third-party). People, more than machines, were central to crisis management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where AI/ML did enter the discussion was with respect to how the rival battle networks with high degrees of automation could misperceive the deployment of additional ISR capabilities during a crisis. Although participants strongly believed that this action was essential, they recognized the possibility that Purple State’s AI/ML augmented strategic warning systems may not be able to interpret the difference between signaling resolve or deliberate escalation. At the same time, they thought the direct communication channels should augment this risk and that most algorithmic applications analyzing the deployment of ISR assets would be more probabilistic than deterministic, thinking in terms of conditional probabilities about escalation risks rather than jumping to the conclusion that war was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put differently, since all AI/ML is based on learning patterns from data or rules-based logic, the underlying patterns of past ISR deployments would likely make the system — even absent a human — unlikely to predict a low-probability event (i.e., war) when there are other more common options associated with a ubiquitous event such as increasing intelligence. If anything, the reverse would be more likely. Since wars and even militarized crises are rare events, an AI/ML algorithm — depending on the training data and parameters — would treat them as such absent human intervention. This does not mean there is a zero probability of “flash wars” and misreading the situation. Rather, the point is that given the low number of wars and militarized crises between states, there are few patterns, and there will almost certainly be a human in the loop. No senior national security leader is likely to cede all decisionmaking to an algorithm in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment B saw a similar discussion between players that focused on using multiple instruments of power and identifying de-escalation opportunities. Of note, it also saw more diplomatic outreach, with players wanting to ensure they could cut through the uncertainty about Purple State’s AI/ML capabilities through direct and indirect diplomatic engagements and crisis communication. In Treatment B, concern about the strengths and limitations of an unknown AI/ML capability in Purple State had a significant impact on group decisionmaking. Group members desired a mutual understanding of Green State and Purple State’s AI/ML capabilities, believing that greater clarity over the balance and use of AI/ML capabilities between rivals would lead to stability, rather than the current instability they faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This focus led participants to recommend deploying ISR capabilities to identify how and if Purple State was using AI-assisted ISR that might misread their intentions. Some players expressed concern about whether the use of ISR would undermine their efforts at de-escalation. Players suggested that if Purple State detected increased deployment of collection and early-warning assets, they would feel pressured to deploy military forces to prevent the appearance of a capability gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, players believed that deploying additional ISR was worth the potential escalation risk because it was essential to analyze adversary actions as they unfolded. These groups sought to combine diplomatic, flexible deterrent options such as third-party mediation and redeployment of naval and aviation assets away from Purple State to signal a desire to de-escalate. In other words, national security professionals wanted to ensure there was a check on algorithmic reasoning during a crisis and were willing to deploy assets to that end and even slow down operations to buy time and space for diplomacy and clear signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reasoning runs counter to claims that AI triggers a security dilemma that leads to inadvertent escalation. In international relations, a security dilemma is a situation where efforts by one state to increase its security cause rival states to experience more insecurity. The concept is used to explain why states find themselves pulled into arms races, crisis escalation, and war. The security dilemma can become especially acute based, among other things, on new technologies that make it difficult to assess whether offensive or defensive military capabilities create strategic advantage. As a result, one would expect to see the emergence of AI/ML capabilities trigger a security dilemma and inadvertent escalation. Rival states would opt for more severe crisis response options in their selection of flexible deterrent options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, this dynamic did not emerge in the crisis simulations based on player discussions and statistical analysis. Players could select from a menu of 24 crisis response options varying by magnitude across each of the instruments of power. Using this magnitude, the CSIS Futures Lab could analyze whether there was more or less coercive pressure applied across the treatments. As can be seen in Table 3, there was no statistically significant difference in the magnitudes across the two treatments. The balance of AI/ML capabilities did not affect how rival states approached crisis management and competitive strategy. Based on discussions, players searched for ways to escape the security dilemma through diplomatic outreach and intelligence across both treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the average escalation level between the two treatments is not different, there appear to be inverse preferences for weak signaling and crisis probing that players adopted to manage crisis escalation. Table 3 below shows the levels of escalation magnitude, ranging from 1 (“low”) to 6 (“high”), that players opted for when they selected diplomatic, information, military, and economic instruments of power to signal their rival and shape the crisis. Lower magnitude signals (1) — which were predominantly diplomatic and intelligence activities — were more than twice as likely in Treatment A (10) than in B (4). Players assessed that AI/ML-enabled battle networks would detect weak signals and help support a defensive posture while searching for a crisis off-ramp. Inversely, in Treatment B (AI/ML Capabilities Unknown), players adopted more of probing strategy using mid-range signaling (i.e., level 3 escalation magnitude) to test adversary capabilities and resolve. In Treatment A (AI/ML Capabilities Known), only 36 percent (14) of the responses fell in this range while Treatment B (AI/ML Capabilities Unknown) saw 60 percent (23). This finding implies that the balance of knowledge about AI/ML capabilities could alter escalation dynamics in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/R2zmJge.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: Contingency Table Escalation Magnitude&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;battle-networks&quot;&gt;Battle Networks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the second round, players found themselves confronting a series of limited strikes by a rival state. In the third round, the situation escalated to theater-wide conventional strikes to evaluate how players shifted their military strategy. In these rounds, players recommended how best to attack their rival state’s battle network in terms of the optimal layer to target: sensor, communications, processing, decision, or effects. If the balance of AI/ML capabilities affects military operations, one would expect to see targeting differences across the treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet,there was no statistically significant difference across the treatments in relation to battle network targeting preferences. As seen in the contingency table below, targeting preferences varied across the treatments, but not as much as expected. In treatments where AI/ML capabilities were known and balanced, players preferred to try and target the processing and decisionmaking layers in an effort to deny the other side tempo and a decisionmaking advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9dBT491.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 4: Battle Network Targeting Preferences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Player discussions drew out the logic behind the difference. When AI/ML was known, players discussed how targeting the decision layer could be a pathway to slow down a crisis and give humans a chance to respond and degrade the ability of a rival to retaliate at machine speed. At the same time, they wanted to limit targeting the processing layer. Players discussed how this layer, which consists of large data hubs, is a new form of critical infrastructure that is often co-located with energy and telecommunications infrastructure to support powering computers and distributing information. Hitting this layer could pull a rival state deeper into an escalation spiral due to concerns about civilian deaths and counter-value targeting. As a result, they discussed how best to target the decision layer, including introducing new forms of flexible deterrent and response options designed to spoof and confuse AI/ML applications that help senior leaders analyze a crisis. The goal was to gain an information advantage and use it for leverage without triggering inadvertent escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When AI/ML was unknown, participants opted to target effectors (e.g., conventional weapons) because it was assessed as the highest payoff target given uncertainty about adversary decisionmaking capabilities. In the absence of knowledge about the depth of AI/ML in a rival state’s battle network, players opted to change the correlation of forces in terms of neutralizing military capabilities capable of launching a retaliatory strike. Although players debated the use of cyber capabilities to degrade Purple State’s military capabilities, players wanted a kinetic strike because it was a visible signal, could be quickly executed, and could target a limited range of proportional targets to demonstrate resolve to the international community without significant escalation risk. This insight impliesaneed to rethink aspects of military targeting in an era almost certain to be defined by increasingly sophisticated AI/ML applications supporting crisis decisionmaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;escalation-risks&quot;&gt;Escalation Risks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite valid concerns about AI/ML and nuclear escalation, there were no statistically significant differences between the treatments in relation to how players assessed the risk. This finding is based on comparing assessments of nuclear escalation risks for Treatment A (AI/ML Capabilities Known) and B (AI/ML Capabilities Unknown). In each round, players selected how likely their flexible response option was to trigger nuclear escalation by picking a number from 1 to 6 with the following values: (1) no risk, (2) risk of limited conventional military confrontation, (3) risk of conventional strikes to degrade nuclear enterprise, (4) risk of limited nuclear attack, (5) risk of large-scale nuclear attack against nuclear enterprise, and (6) risk of large-scale nuclear attack against civilian targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Round 2, when players had to recommend a flexible military response option to counter a rival state, there was no statistically significant difference in their risk assessment. In both games, players assessed the risk as a rival state responding with nonnuclear, limited conventional retaliatory strikes. When AI/ML capabilities were unknown, it created a unique discussion about escalation dynamics. Some players expressed concern that targeting the communication layer in a battle network could lead bad algorithms to get even worse. Absent new information, a rival state’s AI/ML models would be more prone to provide bad or at least outdated advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Round 3, when players had to respond to widespread conventional military strikes, there was also no statistically significant difference in players’ risk assessment. Across both treatments, players saw an increased risk of a retaliatory conventional strike on their nuclear enterprise. When AI/ML capabilities were known, players expressed more concern about a limited nuclear strike and how to best understand the algorithms their rival integrated across the national security enterprise at the tactical, operational, and strategic level. More than technological advantage, players assessed that the key to understanding future AI/ML escalation risks during a nuclear crisis rests in mapping how algorithms inform decisionmaking at echelon. This requirement to understand the range of AI/ML systems augmenting a national security enterprise creates entirely new intelligence requirements critical to early warning and arms control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a statistically significant difference between the treatments with respect to conventional escalation. This finding (Table 5 below) is based on comparing which military response option players opted for in Round 3 in response to widespread conventional strikes. Treatment A (AI/ML Capabilities Known) players took a more measured response and conducted limited strikes on their rival’s military designed to manage escalation risk. During game discussions, players brought up the idea that they were signaling both the rival human leaders and their algorithms, trying to preserve the possibility of an off-ramp. Alternatively, in Treatment B (AI/ML Capabilities Unknown), players took a more aggressive, decisive response but still beneath the nuclear threshold. The findings are more nuanced than what the numbers tell. During the counteraction phase, participants were united in their belief that Green and Purple States were now in a state of war. All players assessed Purple State as “hostile” and considered “crisis escalation imminent.” Since players knew crisis escalation was imminent, they struggled to find an effective response that would signal resolve and commitment to their treaty ally Orange State that would not trigger strategic escalation. Treatment B players argued that “escalating to de-escalate” would be the most viable strategy to ensure a crisis would not lead to greater hostilities. For Treatment B, unknown AI/ML capabilities meant that Green State players were aware of the existence of Purple State’s AI/ML capabilities, yet they did not understand how these systems were being integrated into their decisionmaking process. The “escalate to de-escalate” approach of the Treatment B players was designed to offset the intelligence asymmetry gap with a stronger conventional military response. This finding suggests that a priority intelligence requirement in future crises will be the depth and extent of AI/ML systems across a rival state’s national security enterprise and operational battle networks. It also suggests a possible new form of inadvertent escalation risk associated with testing a rival’s capabilities to reduce uncertainty. This finding has significant implications for thinking about the future of arms control and how to approach national intelligence requirement generation optimized for an algorithmic future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings from these crisis simulations point to recommendations that the United States and its network of partners and allies should consider as they build interoperable battle networks where AI/ML supports decisionmaking at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Embrace experimentation and an agile mindset.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national security community needs to stop worrying about Skynet, alongside other technology-related threat inflation, and start building applications that help people navigate the massive volume of information that is already overwhelming staff and decisionmakers during a crisis. There is a need for more experiments designed to calibrate how best to integrate AI/ML into national security decisionmaking that build on established efforts such as the Global Information Dominance Exercise (GIDE). These exercises connect combatant commands and test their ability to work along a seamless battle network moderated by AI/ML (i.e., human-on-the-loop) during a crisis and the transition to conflict. Each GIDE helps the larger Department of Defense think about how to support modern campaigning consistent with emerging doctrine, including the Joint Warfighting Concept and Joint Concept for Competing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs to expand the GIDE series and examine crisis response from an interagency and coalition perspective. These experiments should map how different executive agencies — from the Department of State to the Department of the Treasury — approach crisis management, with an eye toward enabling better decisionmaking through aggregating and analyzing data. Starting simple with a clear understanding of how each agency approaches flexible deterrent options and how these options are evaluated in the National Security Council will provide insight into where and how to best augment strategy formation and crisis response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Engage in campaign analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constant in war is the fight for information and how commanders employ reconnaissance and security operations alongside collecting intelligence to gain situational awareness, anticipate change, and seek advantage. That fight for information will take place along complex battle networks managed by AI/ML applications, creating a need for new concepts of maneuver, security, and surprise. How a state protects its battle network while degrading its rivals could well become the true decisive operation for a future campaign and an entirely new form of schwerpunkt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense needs to expand modern campaign analysis to explore how to fight a network. These studies should combine historical campaign insights with wargames, modeling, and strategic analysis, with an eye toward balancing military advantage with escalation dynamics. The studies should evaluate existing processes such as joint planning and joint targeting methodologies to see if they are still viable in campaigns characterized by competing battle networks. It is highly likely that the net result will be new processes and methods that both accelerate tempo and keep a careful eye on escalation risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. From open skies to open algorithms, start a broader dialogue about twenty-first-century arms control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a need to start thinking about what arms control looks like in the AI era. Managing weapons inventory may prove less valuable to the future of deterrence than establishing norms, regimes, and treaties governing military actions that target the decision and processing layers of modern battle networks in rival nuclear states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a crisis where software at echelon is searching for efficiencies to accelerate decisionmaking, there is a risk that senior leaders find themselves pulled into escalation traps. This pull could be accelerated by attacks on key systems associated with early warning and intelligence. The sooner states work together to map the risks and build in commonly understood guardrails, the lower the probability of inadvertent or accidental escalation between nuclear rivals. These efforts should include Track 2 and Track 3 tabletop exercises and dialogues that inform how rival states approach crisis management. For example, it would be better to have officials from the United States and China discuss how multi-domain strike networks and automation affect escalation dynamics before a crisis in the Taiwan Strait rather than after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the use of AI/ML capabilities in national security is almost certain to increase in the coming years, there needs to be a larger debate about if and how any information technology augments strategic and military decisionmaking. The stakes are too high to walk blindly into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the national security community needs to accelerate its experimentation with how to integrate AI/ML into modern battle networks, with an eye toward better understanding crisis decisionmaking, campaigning, and arms control. It is not enough to optimize joint targeting and how fast the military can sense, make sense, and gain an advantage. The new world will require rethinking military staff organizations little changed since Napoleon and legacy national security bureaucratic design and planning processes. It will require thinking about how best to support human decisionmaking given a flood of information still subject to uncertainty, fog, and friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the findings here that AI/ML is as likely to play a stabilizing role as it is a destabilizing role, there is a still a risk that the world’s nuclear states inadvertently code their way to Armageddon. As a result, it is important to challenge the findings and acknowledge the limitations of the study. First, the observations are still limited and could be subject to confounding effects caused by age, gender, and each player’s type of national security experience. Future efforts should increase the full range of participants. Second, the results need more observations to analyze not just the balance of known versus unknown AI/ML capabilities, but also if risk perception and escalation change based on a larger number of treatments addressing different AI/ML levels (e.g., “no AI/ML capability,” “more AI/ML capability,” etc.). Last, experts tend to get things wrong and may not see change. Future research should open the experiment up to a wider range of participants and compare how perceptions in the general public compare to those of experts. In the ideal case, these games would also involve more non-U.S. players.&lt;/p&gt;

However, Russia is now firmly the weaker partner in the relationship, with China exploiting the Kremlin’s situation for its own ends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 29 May, US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell spoke to NATO representatives in Brussels on the seriousness of Chinese-Russian relations. His words underscore the true nature of the “no-limits” arrangement between Beijing and Moscow. It is not a partnership of convenience, but a concerted effort to shift the geopolitical centre of gravity towards Asia. While the West often talks about “bleeding Russia dry” through the conflict in Ukraine, Campbell warns that it risks suffering a similar drawn-out death. China does not represent a voice of reason in Russia’s ear as has been suggested by some Western leaders, but has a vested interest in destabilising the West and distracting it from Beijing’s own objectives in the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing political, economic, and social burdens stemming from the invasion of Ukraine have kneecapped Russian agency in the international arena. As the divide between Russia and the West grows, the Kremlin is increasingly focusing its attention on China, with ties between the two states growing ever stronger. In defiance of the West, Russia characterises its relationship with China as an alliance between two great civilisations. However, as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to China has highlighted, Moscow is increasingly finding itself a pawn of China’s geopolitical aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid increasing geopolitical turbulence, the concept of multipolarity is becoming acknowledged as a global trend. Russia and China have been quick to label themselves as key players in this emerging world order, and have collectively strived towards the formation of a bloc that is set to rival Western hegemony. At a glance, the relationship appears natural: two rising authoritarian powers are joining forces to challenge the prevailing order. Yet upon delving deeper into the relationship’s dynamics, Russia’s commitment to its war on Ukraine, its stagnating economy, and its search for support extraneous to the West have led to its foreign policy objectives becoming slowly subsumed into China’s vision of the future international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-new-world-order&quot;&gt;The New World Order&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geopolitical constraints provide Russia and China with a plethora of reasons to band together. Their distrust of Western hegemony, authoritarian governments, and similar political ambitions have nurtured relations between Moscow and Beijing for the last political generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their recent press conference, both states agreed that civilisational differences shape spheres of influence; that international institutions are polarised against their interests, requiring shifts in structure to accommodate “new realities”; and that there is no place for military alliances in the Asia-Pacific region. Noticeably, the conversation focused on the developing trade partnership between the two states, with comments on external affairs remaining limited in detail. In comparison to Putin’s usual damning rhetoric on the collective West, the restraint within this meeting is a sign of the true dynamics of the situation – namely, that they are shaped primarily by Chinese interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cooperation-over-competition&quot;&gt;Cooperation over Competition?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite exorbitant bilateral proclamations of partnership, dynamics between the two states remain cautious, partly as a result of historical tensions. Putin’s reference to Russia and China remaining “brothers forever” seems to skip over the Treaty of Peking (1860), the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang (1934) and nuclear posturing during the Sino-Soviet split, to name a few “breaks” in their historical relationship. These memories are still fresh in the minds of much of the Chinese population, including scholars who note an incongruence between Russian and Chinese visions of a new world order. Despite the friendly veneer, distrust remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia’s refocused economy means it has no ability to provide incentives for greater integration within its historical sphere of influence in the face of Chinese economic competition&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Russia’s economy concentrated on supporting the war effort in Ukraine, its exports have become focused on shipping fossil fuels and other raw materials to Eastern partners. Meanwhile, imports from China now cover a diverse field of industrial and consumer goods, providing essential resources to sustain both Russia’s economy and the conflict in Ukraine. This asymmetrical balance is forecasted to increase over the coming years as Russia struggles to survive on its war economy, and consequently, China will become an ever more important lifeline for the Russian state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/B7FwpbK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/60uJ7y3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Chinese-Russian Trade Complexity.&lt;/strong&gt; Variance in export complexity suggests that Russia has become a Chinese petrol station, while China provides necessities for Russia’s struggling war economy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-country/chn/partner/rus?depthSelector=HS2Depth&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This imbalance has precipitated unusual geopolitical concessions from Russia. The Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), Russia’s customs union – initially conceived in part to limit Chinese influence in Russia’s historical sphere of influence – contains several states operating a multi-vector foreign policy, including investment from China’s global development project, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Putin’s comments at the 2023 Eurasian Economic Forum supporting the pairing of the EAEU and BRI demonstrate both a concession in terms of Russia’s dominance over Eurasia and an acceptance of the nature of relations with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development and investment have become the dominant tools for building influence in Eurasia; in this context, Russia’s economic integration with former Soviet states offers only limited influence over its neighbours. Its refocused economy means it has no ability to provide incentives for greater integration within its historical sphere of influence in the face of Chinese economic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Russia finds itself increasingly reliant on a partner with historical grievances as well as ambitions in its own backyard. If Russia continues to stagnate, it must either make further concessions regarding its geopolitical position within Eurasia, or risk severing its life support mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-excessive-optimism&quot;&gt;Russia’s Excessive Optimism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s recent visit to China, the first since his fifth inauguration as president, highlighted Russia’s strategic dependence upon its neighbour. In the opening address by the two countries’ leaders, one could see an incongruence in the rhetoric surrounding the state of Sino-Russian relations. Putin’s reference to collaboration reaching unprecedented levels was met with lukewarm compliments from Chinese President Xi Jinping about the level of cooperation, indicating a desire for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These comments exemplify Russia and China’s positions. Ultimately, Russia needs China far more than China needs Russia. The relationship hardly extends beyond the transactional, with strict limitations on bilateral cooperation on projects that do not favour Chinese interests. During Putin’s visit, aspirations for a second gas pipeline linking the two states were dashed by yet another unenthusiastic response from Beijing. While Russia still has use for China, there are clear limits to how far China will cooperate with the Kremlin’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9ttmIWg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Average Russian Oil Exports by Country and Region, 2021-2023 (million barrels per day).&lt;/strong&gt; Russia’s growing reliance on China and other Asian partners to mitigate Western sanctions on Russian exports. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/average-russian-oil-exports-by-country-and-region-2021-2023&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ukrainian-question&quot;&gt;The Ukrainian Question&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victory in Ukraine has become integral to the continuation of Putin’s reign, and consequently, the progress of the Russian invasion now dictates every facet of Russian domestic and foreign policy. This opens the door to external exploitation. China, along with other Asian states, have profited from cheap Russian oil; Central Asian states have transformed into crucial transport hubs for goods to and from Russia; and the supply of goods now underproduced within Russia’s war economy is driving increased exports from the East. The longer Russia’s attention is focused on Ukraine, the longer Russia’s neighbours will profit from its increased reliance on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China will happily tolerate a conflict in Ukraine, even going as far to prop up Russia’s military economy, but this does not denote an equal partnership or a friendship&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while China continues to seek a “political solution” to the conflict in Ukraine, it seems more than happy to put up with a protracted conflict. China has typically remained neutral on external matters, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has presented Beijing with a narrow path through which it can prioritise its interests without suffering secondary sanctions from the West. On the surface, Beijing is fostering a growing trade relationship with Russia in a very particular manner, through the export of components with both civilian and military applications such as machine tools, satellite equipment, and drone technology – enough to turn a nice profit and maintain the status quo in the conflict, without overtly support Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Campbell’s words suggest that China is providing much greater support in terms of materiel to help reconstitute Russian forces, kept out of sight to avoid Western retaliation. Ultimately, this situation seems likely, and Russia’s aggressive revanchism in Ukraine serves as an exemplary case study of the limits of Western resolve. Meanwhile, Xi’s Taiwanese ambitions loom large; with an ever narrowing window of opportunity for military action, China will likely be analysing its Russian guinea pig while propping it up just enough to continue to drain Western military and political resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, China will happily tolerate a conflict in Ukraine, even going as far to prop up Russia’s military economy, but this does not denote an equal partnership or a friendship. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine suits a very particular purpose for China, distracting and draining the West. As long as this status quo continues, we can expect China to keep exploiting Russia’s position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sino-Russian relations are strengthening in the political, economic, and military domains, posing a direct threat to Western security interests. The long-term dynamics of this relationship suggest a purely transactional approach, with China exploiting Russia’s economic weaknesses. However, the war in Ukraine also presents an opportunity for China to bleed Western resolve, drain NATO resources, and distract attention from Beijing’s interests in the Indo-Pacific. Ultimately, Putin, through his dreams of Russian revanchism, has transformed Russia into a tool for its ambitious and unreliable Eastern neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;

As policymakers grapple with the “two-near-peer” challenge, a crucial question remains: How should the United States mitigate the risk of opportunistic aggression?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;foreword&quot;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the ongoing war in Ukraine, growing conflicts in the Middle East, and potential for war with China or North Korea, the United States and its allies are facing an enormously complex geopolitical landscape — one further complicated by the changing ways in which adversaries are leveraging nuclear weapons. As the risk of a large-scale conflict increases, particularly with China or Russia but also with North Korea, so too does the potential for nuclear weapons to be used, meaning each individual conflict carries increased risks of nuclear use. At the same time, increased cooperation among China, Russia, and North Korea makes it more likely U.S. adversaries could coordinate or take advantage of potential conflicts with the United States or its allies, increasing the likelihood U.S. forces will have to fight a two-theater or two-front war. Without sufficient conventional forces to deter conflicts from breaking out in the first place, the United States may be forced to rely more heavily on nuclear weapons to deter or respond to aggression on a second front, whether Washington intends to or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these dynamics increase the risk that nuclear weapons will be used in a future conflict — an outcome the United States has tried to avoid for more than 75 years. Managing these challenges requires deeper interoperability with U.S. allies, a clear prioritization of U.S. resources, and a willingness to make tough decisions about where to accept risk. It also requires a better understanding of how opportunistic aggression — or the possibility a second adversary could confront the United States and its allies while they are already engaged in a conflict elsewhere — would complicate U.S. and combined force planning in new and unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI) at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) convened an inaugural Mid-Career Cadre Task Force on Understanding Opportunistic Aggression in the Twenty-First Century. This effort was designed to showcase the exceptional talent and expertise of members from the Mid-Career Cadre and generate new insights on one of the central challenges associated with deterring two nuclear peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report should serve as a wake-up call for senior leaders. War is not inevitable, but if it occurs, the United States and its allies will face very real constraints on how they can deter and respond to aggression on a second front. Such scenarios could place significant demands on U.S. nuclear forces in a way that many policymakers today do not appear to appreciate. Understanding what decisions senior leaders might be asked to make in certain scenarios and what forces might be available — or not — could have a significant impact on future planning, resourcing, and policy decisions. Toward this end, the task force identified several recommendations that deserve serious consideration and action, from establishing a statutory nuclear policy council to developing an engagement plan for discussing opportunistic aggression scenarios with U.S. allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot underestimate the enormity of the challenges the United States is facing or the difficulty of the decisions senior leaders must make now and in the coming years. CSIS and PONI are grateful for the task force’s time and energy on this important issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;task-force-introduction-and-overview&quot;&gt;Task Force Introduction and Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-questions-and-scope&quot;&gt;Key Questions and Scope&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States faces an increasingly contested strategic environment that raises significant, unanswered questions about the role nuclear weapons will play in U.S. national security strategy going forward, and the forces that will be required to deter — and, if necessary, defeat — adversaries. For the first time in its history, the United States must contend with not one but two major nuclear powers. This poses several challenges, chief among them how the United States and its allies might confront simultaneous or sequential high-end conflicts with multiple nuclear-armed adversaries. As policymakers grapple with the “two-near-peer” challenge, a crucial question remains: How should the United States mitigate the risk of opportunistic aggression?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore these issues and generate new thinking on a central issue affecting future nuclear strategy and posture, the Project on Nuclear Issues (PONI) at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) launched the Mid-Career Cadre Task Force on Understanding Opportunistic Aggression in the Twenty-First Century. For the purposes of this report, opportunistic aggression refers to the use of force against the United States or its allies while they are already engaged in a conflict. The task force differentiates between opportunistic aggression and the broader concept of opportunism. While opportunistic states could take advantage of a distracted United States in many ways (e.g., economic actions), actions that fall short of launching an attack are not opportunistic aggression and deserve attention elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group, comprising mid-career experts from both governmental and nongovernmental organizations, represents a diversity of views and backgrounds. Through a series of four multiday intensive workshops in the first half of 2023, the task force explored how the United States and its allies can best deter opportunistic aggression; what, if any, changes to force structure and posture are needed to address the two-near-peer problem; and how planning for opportunistic aggression scenarios in the future might affect extended deterrence commitments, strategic stability, and arms control efforts. Discussions centered on four overarching questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What challenges does opportunistic aggression create for the United States and its allies?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the United States is engaged in a conventional conflict against a nuclear-armed adversary in one theater, how might that affect U.S. planning and force posture in a second theater, and what role might nuclear weapons play in each contingency?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What are the implications for U.S. allies, and how might this affect extended deterrence commitments in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does the United States need to be prepared to fight two simultaneous nuclear wars? How might this affect arms control and strategic stability efforts?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is the culmination of the group’s effort to outline key findings and recommendations for policymakers to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force focused primarily on the implications for U.S. nuclear strategy and forces. It did not focus on what specific steps the United States and its allies might take to strengthen conventional deterrence and defense in both the European and Indo-Pacific theaters, nor did it seek to engage in the growing debate on whether and how U.S. support to Ukraine affects the military’s ability to wage a potential conflict against China — a subset of the broader challenges posed by opportunistic aggression. Strengthening conventional deterrence and nonnuclear planning and operations, as well as the broader U.S. defense industrial base, is critical, but the specific parameters for doing so are outside the scope of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary-of-findings-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;Summary of Findings and Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterring and potentially responding to two separate conflicts or contingencies presents unique challenges, depending on who initiates or takes advantage of a conflict. The task force determined that understanding the specific resource conservation and distribution challenges the United States and its allies might face, as well as the reduced response capability and insufficient resource challenges certain scenarios might bring about, will be critical to identifying and better preparing for the most consequential opportunistic aggression scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Understanding the specific resource conservation and distribution challenges the United States and its allies might face, as well as the reduced response capability and insufficient resource challenges certain scenarios might bring about, will be critical to identifying and better preparing for the most consequential opportunistic aggression scenarios.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding when a leader might initiate aggression or use nuclear weapons — and what might deter them from doing so — is one of the most difficult intelligence requirements. Assessing how a leader’s calculations might shift if the United States and its allies are already engaged in a conflict elsewhere complicates this matter significantly. The task force identified four key factors in determining the likelihood a state will opportunistically initiate an aggressive action while the United States is already involved in a conflict. An adversary’s perception of a significant change in U.S. and allied capabilities, will, or alliance strength could lead an adversary to determine that there is an opportunity to initiate aggression to achieve its objectives. Changes or failures in signaling could also lead to this conclusion. Improving collection on and assessment of these dynamics will be essential and will allow the United States and its allies not only to better anticipate when opportunistic aggression might occur but also to provide a critical baseline for better tailoring deterrence strategies and understanding how those strategies might interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In analyzing the wide range of possible opportunistic aggression scenarios the United States might face, the task force concluded the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers appear unaware of the risks they are accepting in regard to opportunistic aggression and the demands certain scenarios could place on U.S. nuclear forces in the impending two-nuclear-peer threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Opportunistic aggression could create unique challenges for U.S. nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Current planning for opportunistic aggression scenarios is insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is insufficient awareness of how threats in one theater might affect U.S. allies’ security interests in a separate theater and the ability of the United States to meet its extended deterrence obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is not clear whether the necessary processes and structures are in place to make difficult and informed prioritization decisions across the nuclear enterprise and broader defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, the task force recommends the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers and senior leaders should review intelligence priorities to ensure adequate intelligence collection and assessment on what factors might influence the likelihood a leader will initiate aggression if the United States is already involved in a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should work with the administration to establish a statutory Nuclear Policy Council to serve as a bridge between operational and acquisition-focused decisions and broader National Security Council–led interagency deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense (DOD) should prioritize war games, tabletop exercises (TTXs), and scenario-based discussions that focus on opportunistic aggression scenarios and facilitate interagency, allied, and outside expert participation, where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Departments of State and Defense should develop an engagement plan for allies to empower more detailed and transparent conversations on opportunistic aggression scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The executive branch and Congress should address critical conventional shortfalls and work with allies to devise complementary investment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Departments and agencies should prioritize nuclear deterrence education for senior leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOD and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) should diversify U.S. nuclear forces to ensure the president has a full range of options if deterrence fails in one or more theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policymakers should accept calculated risks and ensure the necessary processes and structures are in place to make difficult prioritization decisions. They should also allow the advanced development communities within DOD laboratories and NNSA national laboratories to experiment more aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;force-planning-and-the-challenges-of-a-two-front-war&quot;&gt;Force Planning and the Challenges of a Two-Front War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in its history, the United States must contend with not one but two major power rivals with nuclear weapons. As policymakers grapple with how to manage this two-near-peer or tripolar deterrence challenge, a key question is how the United States should approach the prospect of opportunistic aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) points out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Opportunistic aggression could create deterrence challenges. Should we find ourselves in a large-scale military confrontation with a major power or regional adversary, the Joint Force will need to be postured with military capabilities — including nuclear weapons — that can deter and defeat other actors who may seek to take advantage of this scenario to engage in opportunistic aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, the NPR and National Defense Strategy (NDS) outline a broad force planning construct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To deter opportunistic aggression elsewhere, while the United States is involved in an all-domain conflict, the Department will employ a range of risk mitigation efforts rooted in integrated deterrence. These include coordination with and contributions of Allies and partners, deterrent effects of U.S. nuclear posture, and leveraging posture and capabilities not solely engaged in the primary warfight — for example, cyber and space. Additionally, the Joint Force will be shaped to ensure the ability to respond to small-scale, short-duration crises without substantially impairing high-end warfighting readiness, and to conduct campaigning activities that improve our position and reinforce deterrence while limiting or disrupting competitor activities that seriously affect U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is little evidence the United States is prepared for such scenarios. Due to policy and strategy decisions made years ago in very different security environments, today’s Joint Force is not sized or shaped to address two simultaneous or sequential high-end conflicts borne out of opportunistic aggression scenarios. In addition, the United States already struggles to fully integrate with allies when preparing for a single crisis or conflict, let alone work through the implications for U.S. allies if large elements of U.S. conventional forces are tied up in a separate theater and the United States is forced to rely more heavily on its nuclear forces and allies to confront a second aggressor. Addressing these challenges requires policymakers to first understand what risks they are accepting today and in the future as a result of strategy and force structure decisions made years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion that the United States needs to be prepared to prosecute two simultaneous conflicts is not a novel concept. After the Cold War, the United States could fight regional wars in places like Iraq and Afghanistan while maintaining sufficient capabilities to deter military adventurism by other adversaries. In fact, multiple presidential administrations reaffirmed that the United States must be able to prevail in two simultaneous (or near simultaneous) conflicts, including President George H. W. Bush in his Base Force concept and President Barack Obama in his defense strategy. But a decade ago, experts and officials often discussed two-war force sizing in the context of two simultaneous medium-sized or regional conflicts. In 2014, then secretary of defense Chuck Hagel asserted that U.S. forces, provided they were funded at the levels called for by the administration’s pending budget request, would be “capable of simultaneously defending the homeland; conducting sustained, distributed counterterrorist operations; and in multiple regions, deterring aggression and assuring allies through forward presence and engagement.” He went on to state that if deterrence should fail, “U.S. forces could defeat a regional adversary in a large-scale multi-phased campaign and deny the objectives of — or impose unacceptable costs on — another aggressor in another region.” Soon, however, the growing threat from China changed this thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the NDS adopted what was functionally a one-war force-sizing construct and recommended only modest increases in force capacity. This approach recognized the reality of what it would take to execute a high-end war against a large nuclear-armed adversary such as China or Russia but arguably created operational and strategic vulnerabilities. As noted by the 2018 NDS Commission,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Department has largely abandoned the longstanding “two-war” construct for a “one major war” sizing and shaping construct. In the event of a large-scale conflict with Russia or China, the United States may not have sufficient remaining resources to deter other adversaries in one — let alone two — other theaters by denying them the ability to accomplish their objectives without relying on nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This warning largely went unnoticed, however, in part because it seemed unlikely the United States would be forced to confront simultaneous conflicts. Moreover, the United States intended to rely on its allies’ growing conventional capabilities and increased burden sharing to offset some of the risks a two-theater or two-front war might entail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as this report details, the changing geopolitical environment, the presence of two powerful nuclear-armed adversaries, the growing threat from states like North Korea, and the increased cooperation among those states means that it may be infeasible to conventionally deter one adversary while committing sufficient conventional capabilities to fight and win against the other — let alone fight and win against both simultaneously. This has significant implications for U.S. nuclear forces as well as for U.S. extended deterrence guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing major-power opportunistic aggression in a second theater requires understanding what a large-scale conventional conflict (or conflicts) might involve and how such a conflict would constrain U.S. ability to flow forces and support logistics into a second theater or area of operations if a second adversary initiated aggression on a separate front. It also likely requires some combination of greater optimization of U.S. and allied conventional force structures, increased allied force contributions, improved industrial base efforts to reconstitute critical conventional capability deficiencies as well as the nuclear enterprise, and improved U.S. theater nuclear capabilities and integration. Deconflicting and prioritizing these efforts will be essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opportunistic-aggression-in-the-current-strategic-environment&quot;&gt;Opportunistic Aggression in the Current Strategic Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next decade may be among the most strategically challenging in U.S. history. Facing the prospect of two near-peer competitors for the first time in the nuclear era, the United States continues to maintain significant global commitments. These include managing a complex network of alliances, including promises to protect these allies against aggression and potentially use U.S. nuclear weapons to defend them. While the Joint Force remains the most capable conventional military organization on the planet, this complex strategic picture entails myriad contingencies that could require the United States to commit or expend some or nearly all of its nonnuclear capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States were to commit a significant portion of its conventional forces to a war, it would necessarily reduce the strength of its conventional deterrent against other adversaries, who might take advantage of perceived U.S. weakness or distraction. For instance, a series of 24 war games conducted by CSIS indicated that the United States would likely flow a significant portion of its forces to the Pacific in the event of a conflict with China over Taiwan. And even if the United States, Taiwan, and Japan were successful in repelling a Chinese invasion, the United States would likely still lose “dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and tens of thousands of servicemembers.” The United States would also likely run out of long-range precision-guided munitions in less than one week during a Taiwan contingency. Amid such hostilities, the ability to respond to aggression in another theater — by Russia, for instance — could be sharply curtailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If the United States were to commit a significant portion of its conventional forces to a war, it would necessarily reduce the strength of its conventional deterrent against other adversaries, who might take advantage of perceived U.S. weakness or distraction.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stockpile shortages resulting from U.S. support for Ukraine have amplified concerns about the state of the U.S. industrial base. These forecasted and current shortages raise serious questions about the speed with which the U.S. defense industry can replenish depleted stockpiles, what stocks would be available to respond to a crisis or conflict in a second theater, and the ability of the United States to provide allies with indirect aid while fighting a major war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While opportunistic aggression is not a new concern — both the 2018 and 2022 NDSs identify deterring opportunistic aggression as a priority for the Joint Force — the question remains: How can the United States deter other adversaries from striking when it is already committed to a conflict, and what implications might this have for U.S. nuclear forces if deterrence fails?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two-nuclear-peer problem and the increasing partnership between China and Russia (as well as North Korea) compounds the risk of opportunistic aggression. Not only is conventional deterrence increasingly challenged, but changes in how nuclear-armed adversaries are integrating nuclear coercion and potential use into their theories of victory present unique operational dilemmas for the United States and its allies. Russia’s growing reliance on nuclear weapons amid its conventional losses in the war in Ukraine, China’s unprecedented expansion and diversification of its nuclear forces, and the continued risk of North Korean nuclear use all pose unique deterrence challenges. But the United States cannot deal with these threats in isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recently released report of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States took note of this problem in its findings: “The new partnership between Russian and Chinese leaders poses qualitatively new threats of potential opportunistic aggression and/or the risk of future cooperative two-theater aggression.” Indeed, cooperation on military matters between China and Russia — as well as North Korea — has expanded significantly in recent years, particularly since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Even if these adversaries do not formalize their alignment through treaties or deliberately coordinate aggression against the United States, their growing ties complicate U.S. defense planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the most overt signs of growing cooperation, Russia and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) have significantly expanded their joint military activities. Since 2018, the PRC has regularly sent forces to participate in Russia’s annual district-level exercises, which focus on high-intensity conventional war fighting, often against fictional opponents that resemble the United States and its allies. Russia and the PRC have also expanded cooperation between their air forces: the Russian and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) air forces conducted their first joint bomber patrol in 2019 and have since continued these patrols, often flying through Korean and Japanese air-defense identification zones. The Russian and PRC navies have engaged in joint exercises since 2012, including an exercise in the Baltic Sea in 2017 and, most recently, an exercise in the Sea of Japan in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond military exercises, Russia and the PRC are reportedly increasing ties between their nuclear industries and programs. In early 2023, Western media reported that Rosatom — Russia’s state-run nuclear energy corporation — was supplying the PRC with thousands of kilograms of highly enriched uranium to fuel fast breeder reactors. U.S. officials believe these reactors will produce weapons-grade plutonium for the PRC’s nuclear weapons program. Although the precise motivations for this cooperation are unclear, the deal is a further sign of growing military cooperation between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also strengthened its ties with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Russian and DPRK officials have made visits to Pyongyang and Moscow, and the Kremlin has reportedly purchased millions of artillery shells and rockets from the DPRK to support its war effort in Ukraine. The DPRK has also provided Russia with ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine. In return, Russia is assisting the DPRK’s efforts to develop and launch military satellites, though the precise nature and impact of this assistance is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways these growing ties could complicate and stress U.S. planning. When detailing plausible conflict scenarios associated with the two-near-peer problem, a study group through the Center for Global Security Research (CGSR) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory highlighted that an adversary taking advantage of U.S. engagement in one theater (via crisis or war) may instigate opportunistic aggression in a second region or even pose a joint aggression threat. The report notes multiple possible permutations of opportunistic aggression, with dynamics likely to be context specific. Conflicts could result from inadvertent or coincidental actions, or via actions undertaken by one of the two parties involved in the first conflict. In other words, opportunistic aggression will not play out in predictable or identical pathways but, rather, could be sequential, uncoordinated, coordinated, or even the result of an alliance between the two aggressors. Notably, an adversary may act as though it is preparing to initiate a crisis or conflict, even if it does not intend to do so, merely to complicate U.S. force planning and draw U.S. forces away from a surprise attack by the other adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States must be prepared for such scenarios. As the recent Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States makes clear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The objectives of U.S. strategy must include effective deterrence and defeat of simultaneous Russian and Chinese aggression in Europe and Asia using conventional forces. If the United States and its Allies and partners do not field sufficient conventional forces to achieve this objective, U.S. strategy would need to be altered to increase reliance on nuclear weapons to deter or counter opportunistic aggression in the other theater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the prospect of a two-front war against Russia and China is a worst-case scenario for opportunistic aggression, it is not the only concerning scenario. Other regional actors such as North Korea or Iran could prove difficult to deter if the United States were to find itself fighting either of its peer competitors. Conversely, if the United States found itself in a war against a minor power, even a limited conflict could impose significant resource constraints on the Joint Force that might create windows of opportunity for a peer competitor state. As a recent Atlantic Council study concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;US thinking about war in East Asia often neglects the possibility that the United States would have to fight the PRC and North Korea simultaneously rather than separately. Furthermore, conventional wisdom in the United States underestimates the risk that either the PRC or North Korea would resort to a limited nuclear strike in the event of a conflict in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing these issues requires a more detailed understanding of how U.S. and allied resources might be constrained in various opportunistic aggression scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resource-challenges-and-opportunistic-aggression&quot;&gt;Resource Challenges and Opportunistic Aggression&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges that opportunistic aggression presents are myriad. However, certain configurations of adversaries are more likely to present challenges than others. Whether the first or second adversary is a nuclear peer matters for whether the United States must conserve or reallocate resources and how much it might be forced to rely on nuclear weapons in its strategy. While U.S. conventional capabilities are likely sufficient to deter most adversaries in peacetime, the prospect of opportunistic aggression is a reminder that the U.S. conventional deterrent might be significantly degraded by even a brief high-intensity conflict. This creates four primary challenges: resource conservation, resource distribution, reduced response capability, and insufficient resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource conservation challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; First, in the event of a war with a non-peer state, the United States would face a resource conservation challenge. For example, the Joint Force might be called upon to reserve a significant portion of critical resources (e.g., Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles [LRASMs]) to preserve the conventional deterrent against a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan. Committing (and consuming) high-end or low-density conventional capabilities would diminish U.S. capacity to respond to additional threats. While the NDS appears to acknowledge this dynamic, in practice, combatant commanders will almost certainly push for any and all resources to respond to extant crises, which makes a decision to conserve or withhold certain assets both politically and operationally challenging. Failure to make such a decision, however, could leave the United States with fewer nonnuclear capabilities to deter or respond to aggression on a second front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource distribution challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; If a second non-peer adversary took advantage of a perceived weakness to engage in opportunistic aggression, the challenge would deepen. In addition to the resource conservation challenge, the United States would face a resource distribution challenge. Capabilities would need to be diverted to the new conflict while maintaining an effective deterrent against adventurism by other actors, especially peer competitors. This might require the United States to adopt riskier strategies to end the non-peer conflicts quickly, accept suboptimal conflict outcomes, rely more heavily on allies, or, if subsequent aggressors are nuclear-armed states, rely more on nuclear weapons to deter further opportunistic aggression. Such a scenario could also force the United States to revisit its policy regarding the employment of nuclear threats or operations against Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)–compliant states to provide more flexibility as threats evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1gs0V0g.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1. Resource Challenges and Opportunistic Aggression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced response capability challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; By contrast, if the initial adversary were a nuclear peer (i.e., Russia or China), opportunistic aggression would pose a different set of challenges. The United States could not afford to reserve significant capabilities in a high-intensity conventional conflict against a peer and would therefore face a reduced response capability challenge in the event of opportunistic aggression by a non-peer adversary. The United States might be limited in its ability to fulfill commitments to allies or might be forced to adopt a more hands-off strategy against the new aggressor to help hold the line, perhaps following the model of current U.S. support for Ukraine. With its conventional forces committed to fighting one peer competitor, the United States may need to lean heavily on its nuclear arsenal to deter the other from entering the fray or taking independent action against U.S. or allied interests. It may also be forced to rely more heavily on allied capabilities and will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insufficient resources challenge:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, if both the initial adversary and the opportunistic aggressor are nuclear peers, the United States would confront an insufficient resources challenge. Lacking the conventional capabilities to fight and win against two near-peer adversaries simultaneously, the United States would either need to back down (in either or both conflicts) or face the prospect of fighting a conventionally superior adversary in one or both theaters, depending on resource allocation. This strategy would likely require the greatest reliance on nuclear weapons and result in the greatest likelihood of U.S. first use, as the United States might need to employ tactical nuclear weapons to offset conventional weaknesses. Table 1 outlines the four configurations of adversary types and the associated challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the peer/non-peer status of the initial and opportunistic aggressors helps inform the nature of the challenge, the task force recognizes that opportunistic aggression may take many forms. Although the authors limit the definition of opportunistic aggression to military action against the United States or its allies, different types of attacks, depending on their nature and target, would require different and proportionate responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope and scale of a U.S. response to opportunistic aggression would also be informed by the nature of the conflict. In accordance with the threat posed to U.S. interests and in keeping with the law of proportionality, the United States is unlikely to respond to a minor conventional incursion with a nuclear strike. Similarly, it is unlikely to defer a response to a case of nuclear use against an ally, even if the United States is already embroiled in a peer conflict. While this report primarily focuses on conventional crises that have the potential to escalate to nuclear use, the task force notes that it is possible a crisis might start with nuclear use — for example, a North Korean nuclear attack on a U.S. ally intended to swiftly achieve capitulation, or even a Chinese or Russian demonstration strike to show resolve and deter U.S. intervention. Such crises would put even greater demands on U.S. conventional and nuclear capabilities in order to successfully restore deterrence and manage (de)escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;factors-that-influence-opportunistic-aggression&quot;&gt;Factors That Influence Opportunistic Aggression&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force identified four key factors in determining the likelihood a state will opportunistically initiate an aggressive action while the United States is involved in a first conflict. These factors are capability, will, alliance strength, and signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capability.&lt;/strong&gt; An adversary who believes that U.S. capabilities have been so compromised by an initial conflict that the United States could not meaningfully respond to new aggression will demand more, be less willing to compromise, and be more likely to resort to force if its demands are not met. The timing and scale of the initial conflict will determine the extent of this problem. Adversaries are very likely to scale the aggressiveness of their actions based on the severity and visibility of U.S. losses. However, an adversary may be emboldened even if the Joint Force is seeing success on the battlefield if that success has exhausted high-end limited resources like precision-guided munitions or long-range fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will.&lt;/strong&gt; Similarly, an adversary who believes the United States lacks the will to risk involvement in a secondary conflict may be emboldened to act. The appearance of war weariness in an administration or the U.S. public would send a message that the United States would rather concede than engage in additional conflict. Adversaries would also take cues from the length of the initial conflict, as wars that stalemate and drag on for years are more likely to lose public support over time. Widespread antiwar activism or a rise in populist ideas of isolationism could also signal a waning interest in continued or expanded fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alliance strength.&lt;/strong&gt; Opportunistic aggression may not be targeted at the U.S. homeland. Aggressors may view a distracted United States as an opportunity to attack a U.S. ally with potentially fewer repercussions than during peacetime. This factor is exacerbated if U.S. alliance commitments appear to wane as a result of the initial conflict. This might take the form of public statements by the U.S. administration questioning the strength, necessity, or fairness of an alliance, but even the reallocation of resources could send the message, perhaps unintentionally, that the United States has deemphasized an alliance. For example, if the United States pulled capabilities from South Korea to respond to a Taiwan contingency, North Korea might perceive both a weakening of U.S. capabilities on the peninsula and, if done against the protest of the South Korean government, a weakening of the U.S.–Republic of Korea alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signaling.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to the message sent by changes in capabilities, will, and alliance strength, changes in or failures of U.S. signaling might encourage or discourage opportunistic aggression. How Washington handles strategic communications and signaling geared toward other potential aggressors could be critical in shaping perceptions of whether the United States is vulnerable to an attack on a second front. The ability to effectively communicate consequences and distinguish escalation control signals aimed at one adversary from deterrence signals aimed at a second adversary could also shape an adversary’s perceptions of whether the United States is likely to respond in a second theater or on a second front. Escalation dynamics and signals could therefore have a significant impact on an adversary’s thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;when-deterring-opportunistic-aggression-fails&quot;&gt;When Deterring Opportunistic Aggression Fails&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the challenges of responding to opportunistic aggression, the United States should aim to deter adversaries from opening a second front whenever possible. Maintaining a high level of conventional and nuclear readiness, demonstrating the will to fight, showing strong commitment to allies, and engaging in unambiguous messaging should all contribute to effective deterrence. Should deterrence fail, however, the United States may face the difficult prospect of trying to manage escalation and keep a conventional conflict conventional in one theater while simultaneously relying on the threat (or even employment) of nuclear weapons in a second theater. If, in such a scenario, the United States were forced to employ nuclear weapons — for example, if the United States has just used tactical nuclear weapons to stop a Chinese invasion of Taiwan or respond to a crisis on the Korean peninsula — it would be extraordinarily difficult to argue that Russia should not use tactical nuclear weapons in the face of conventional defeat. The challenge of concurrently managing intra- and inter-conflict deterrence is therefore both understudied and undertheorized but increasingly relevant in a two-near-peer world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The challenge of concurrently managing intra- and inter-conflict deterrence is therefore both understudied and undertheorized but increasingly relevant in a two-near-peer world.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;findings-and-conclusions&quot;&gt;Findings and Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force identified five broad findings over the course of its deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-findings&quot;&gt;Policy Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Policymakers appear unaware of the risks that they are accepting in regard to opportunistic aggression and the demands that certain scenarios could place on U.S. nuclear forces in the impending two-nuclear-peer threat environment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming current spending rates and force constructs remain relatively constant, policymakers will be accepting future risks, whether or not those risks are identified and understood. As a result, in the event of future opportunistic aggression, it is unlikely policymakers will have the number of options they assume will be available to them. Significant changes or decisions related to conventional force generation can take years to implement and, once operational, often reflect a security environment from prior years. As such, if U.S. policymakers and decisionmakers do not take action now, they may be forced to rely on nuclear weapons to compensate for shortfalls in conventional capabilities in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat of opportunistic aggression may challenge the current U.S. policy of “reducing reliance on nuclear weapons.” In fact, if changes are not made, the current force posture and structure may well require the United States to rely more on nuclear weapons in a second theater or on a second front in the event of a future opportunistic aggression scenario. This threat demands policymakers to address the disconnect between extant policy and current capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;capability-findings&quot;&gt;Capability Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Opportunistic aggression could create unique challenges for U.S. nuclear forces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed, if the United States and its allies are engaged in a major conventional conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary, the United States may be forced to rely more on nuclear weapons to deter and potentially respond to aggression in a second theater or on a second front. If an adversary perceives a benefit to threatening nuclear escalation in one or both conflicts, it will present even greater challenges for the current U.S. nuclear force posture. Thus, while current capabilities may provide sufficient deterrence in the near term, the current nuclear force structure is insufficient, given current U.S. nuclear strategy, to respond to conflicts with two near peers or in two theaters simultaneously if deterrence fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the current mix of U.S. nuclear capabilities is insufficient in its versatility to proactively deter and retroactively respond to opportunistic aggression in a second theater or second area of operations. The nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM-N) program will help fill certain gaps in nuclear capabilities that are not easily met through any other current or developing option. However, the development and fielding timelines within the nuclear enterprise today do not support closing that gap within the next 10 years. This leaves a significant challenge in the Indo-Pacific theater, where regional nuclear capabilities could play an outsize role in an opportunistic aggression scenario, especially in terms of deterring Chinese or North Korean coercion or escalation. Responding to opportunistic aggression in the Indo-Pacific region after a conflict has already broken out elsewhere — that is, dealing with a second crisis or conflict — would further exacerbate this gap given the lack of forward-deployed nuclear assets in the region and the demand that would already be placed on certain capabilities given the initial conflict. Introducing greater diversity and versatility in modernized nuclear systems, as well as additional options for the extant U.S. stockpile, would provide more credible response options for dealing with acts of opportunistic aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;planning-findings&quot;&gt;Planning Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Current planning for opportunistic aggression scenarios may be insufficient.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combatant commanders must prepare for various opportunistic aggression contingencies, including scenarios that require them to coordinate forces and plans (including deterrence strategies and operations) in new and different ways across multiple geographic combatant commands, including United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). This requires a comprehensive understanding of the forces available — conventional, nonnuclear, and nuclear, including nuclear support assets — and a better process for testing plans and assumptions if the assumed or preferred level of forces is not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this type of planning is limited given the current planning approach. Despite the focus the 2022 NPR places on integrated deterrence, nuclear planning is often segregated rather than integrated within the DOD. Because nuclear plans are segregated by a combatant command (CCMD), geographic combatant commanders plan and execute conventional operations, while nuclear planning is largely relegated to USSTRATCOM. This separation stems from force design: most combatant commands do not have the necessary skill sets and personnel to conduct nuclear planning. Those skill sets mostly reside in USSTRATCOM, though there are some positive changes in United States Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) — for instance, as the Air Force attempts to bolster its deterrence posture for strategic competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More detailed and realistic planning is also hindered by the reticence of the DOD — and the U.S. government as a whole — to talk about nuclear planning and operations. Policymakers may need to “think the unthinkable” when it comes to opportunistic aggression, especially for scenarios involving possible low-yield nuclear use. Geographic combatant commanders (GCCs) need to prepare for the possibility that low-yield nuclear use in one theater or situation would affect force flows and decisionmaking in another theater, especially as it pertains to deterrence operations with nuclear forces. Would more or different nuclear assets be needed in one region to maintain deterrence or reestablish it? How might nuclear use change force flows and operations for the conventional side in either theater? Reluctance to work through these difficult issues ahead of time stifles planning and could encourage adversaries to exploit perceived gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;extended-deterrence-and-alliance-management-findings&quot;&gt;Extended Deterrence and Alliance Management Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. There is insufficient awareness of how threats in one theater might affect the security interests of U.S. allies in a separate theater and the ability of the United States to meet its extended deterrence obligations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. allies are understandably focused on potential crises and conflicts on their territory or in their own backyard. Although the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) began to consider the impact of China’s rise on the security of the alliance in 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine derailed many of these discussions. The United States must lead difficult — but critical — conversations with allies regarding the threat of opportunistic aggression to better prepare for such contingencies. While existing dialogues and formats could enable such conversations, current forums are insufficient or lack the candor needed. Opportunistic aggression will likely require the United States to rely more heavily on allies to respond simultaneously in two theaters. In advance of such an extreme circumstance and in a precrisis setting, the United States can work with allies and partners now to define requirements while balancing assurance concerns. There will be different implications and asks for each ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States must lead difficult — but critical — conversations with allies regarding the threat of opportunistic aggression to better prepare for such contingencies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if large elements of U.S. forces are tied up in the Indo-Pacific theater and the United States is forced to flow certain assets out of the European theater, NATO allies need to understand the potential implications. Likewise, the United Kingdom and France, in particular, may need to be prepared to respond to queries about whether there are specific, credible actions they could take to reinforce the alliance’s nuclear posture and readiness in the absence of a more visible presence of U.S. assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. It is not clear the necessary processes and structures are in place to make difficult — and informed — prioritization decisions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritization of the nation’s resources to account for the possibility of opportunistic aggression is needed. Not addressing U.S. force posture to accommodate the most likely opportunistic aggression scenarios could make such scenarios more likely due to an adversary perceiving a weakness in U.S. military strength. The U.S. defense industrial base — both in terms of its production capacity and workforce — likely cannot quickly accommodate major changes in U.S. military force posture to account for the risk of opportunistic aggression. The U.S. military’s budget is stretched in many ways, and significant adjustments have proved difficult in the past and will likely be difficult in the future. These challenges point to the need for prioritization when considering how to mobilize the defense industrial base to address this problem. But it is not clear the necessary processes and decisionmaking structures are in place across services and departments for making informed resourcing decisions — not just for the nuclear enterprise but also across the broader defense industrial base. Congress and the executive branch need to address this gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Review intelligence priorities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding when a leader might choose to initiate aggression or use nuclear weapons — and what specifically might deter them from doing so — is already one of the most difficult intelligence priorities. Assessing how a leader’s calculations might shift if the United States and its allies were already engaged in a conflict elsewhere complicates this matter significantly. Policymakers should review current intelligence priorities to ensure the intelligence community is also considering what factors might influence the likelihood a state will opportunistically initiate aggression while the United States is already involved in a conflict. Improving collection on and assessment of these dynamics not only will allow the United States and its allies to better anticipate when opportunistic aggression might occur but will also provide a critical baseline for better tailoring deterrence strategies and understanding how those strategies might interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Establish a Nuclear Policy Council.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force recommends creating a senior interagency group with statutory authorities to more consistently and over longer periods review deterrence policy and ensure planning is congruent with nuclear policymaking in a dynamic threat environment. This group would serve as the interagency policy counterpart to the existing DOD-NNSA Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC), which oversees the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile management process and ensures alignment between DOD delivery systems and NNSA warheads. The new group would serve as a bridge between the NWC and higher-level National Security Council–led policy discussions. Among the many benefits of such a standing group, continuity is the most crucial advantage. Rather than wait for the NPR process to take place every several years, a policy-focused council would ensure ongoing long-term analysis without undercutting an administration’s ability to conduct independent reviews at its discretion. The council could also more closely track operational considerations and how policy translates to planning, resourcing, and programming decisions, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Prioritize war games, TTXs, and scenario-based discussions that focus on opportunistic aggression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the DOD conducts numerous war games each year, the vast majority of them are limited to conventional operations. To further complicate the issue, the DOD does not maintain an annual war game in which an adversary employs limited nuclear weapons or in which a second adversary launches an attack during an existing regional conflict. Limited nuclear use and opportunistic aggression scenarios are often addressed only in localized exploratory TTXs, resulting in shortfalls across the DOD in understanding theater-level strategy and escalation management approaches for scenarios in which an adversary uses limited nuclear attacks or U.S. forces must also contend with opportunistic aggression from a nuclear adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War games and TTXs that focus on a range of opportunistic aggression scenarios could help senior leaders, combatant commands, and planners understand challenges and resource constraints, as well as force management limitations. However, these cannot just be games led and attended by USSTRATCOM; interagency and senior administration officials outside of the DOD should also be included. This can help senior leaders feel more comfortable making decisions in resource- constrained environments and better understand the trade-offs and potential opportunity costs of certain capability investments. Running through scenarios with allies and diversifying the participant base can also improve understanding of the potential constraints. Unclassified games outside of official channels can also help increase the overall understanding of these challenges and provide a platform for engaging key allies on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Develop an engagement plan for allies to empower more detailed and transparent conversations on opportunistic aggression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs to develop an engagement plan for deepening planning and consultations with allies on opportunistic aggression scenarios. Opportunistic aggression scenarios need to be on the agenda with allies in existing dialogue structures. These could be added as an agenda item or incorporated into scenario-based discussions or TTXs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open and honest conversations with allies could improve understanding of what might be asked of them in certain scenarios. To do this effectively, the United States must take the lead on normalizing theoretical conversations with allies while managing perceptions of assurances. Hypothetical conversations will enable allies to better understand the threat environment, limitations on U.S. capabilities, and the kind of burden sharing that will be expected or necessary. This discussion could occur via existing mechanisms and channels, or it could be a wider effort that the DOD and the State Department co-lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Prioritize nuclear deterrence education for senior leadership.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD does not sufficiently educate Joint Force leaders on nuclear issues. This gap in knowledge stems from a lack of standardization and mandatory instruction on nuclear issues across professional military education (PME). Many Joint Force officers receive little to no exposure to nuclear issues, including effects, policy, deterrence theory, escalation management, and opportunistic aggression, unless taken as an elective. In fact, when a leader becomes a senior flag officer, it may be the first time they are exposed to nuclear planning and operational concepts. This needs to change. Officers need exposure to these issues much earlier in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers and planners also need deeper expertise on both nuclear issues and planning for conventional conflicts. In the diplomatic realm, policymakers leading consultations and conversations with allies often lack detailed understanding of nuclear (and conventional) planning and operational concepts, making it difficult to have frank conversations about what might be needed, by whom, and when. Further, senior leaders and political appointees need better exposure to how integrated planning, including nuclear planning, is undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Diversify U.S. nuclear forces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policymakers should strive to diversify U.S. nuclear forces through investments in new capabilities, possibly in smaller numbers. This would provide the president with a broader range of credible options, particularly if an adversary threatens limited nuclear attacks. Strategic deterrence is, and should remain, the primary mission of the U.S. nuclear force, and the triad is essential to the success of that mission. Nonetheless, nuclear capabilities with the following attributes will likely contribute significantly to U.S. ability to deter opportunistic aggression prior to it occurring in a second theater, or aid in restoring deterrence should it fail or if limited nuclear use occurs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;survivability (ability to penetrate enemy air defenses and maneuver)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;persistent presence&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;lower yield&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;responsive and effective across a spectrum of targets&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These capabilities should also serve certain objectives, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;regional assurance&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;operational flexibility&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;deterrence (both prior to conflict and within it)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task force concludes that sea-launched weapons with these attributes are likely the best option to meet the opportunistic aggression threat posed by China in the Indo-Pacific and may also serve other roles in a European theater depending on the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Address critical conventional shortfalls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of opportunistic aggression is increased by conventional shortfalls in key capabilities, including long-range fires, precision-guided munitions, and heavy airlift and refueling. While current stockpiles may be sufficient to achieve victory in a single brief war, the war in Ukraine demonstrates the difficult task of replacing expended munitions and destroyed platforms in sustained high-intensity conflict. The United States and its allies must acquire enough of these key capabilities to fight and win one war while maintaining a sufficient conventional deterrent to prevent a second. To do so, officials should solidify a clear division of labor and investment strategies with allies. Building the defense industrial base and workforce capacity both in the United States and within allied nations to support shifting force structure plans will be key. The United States must rely on allied nations to fill the conventional weapons gaps they are capable of filling, such as lower-end munitions to support the war in Ukraine. That is not to say that allied nations should always have the role of low-end munitions production. But this is a near-term ask, and division of labor can help fill key gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Accept calculated risks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A viable strategy for addressing the four resource challenges posed by opportunistic aggression, previously described in this report, is not to simply build more but to build different. The key decision here is determining how the United States is committing itself to engage in a simultaneous two-conflict scenario and where it is willing to accept risk. U.S. nuclear modernization efforts are largely focused on one-for-one replacement programs, which will put new versions of extant weapons in the triad into service. The main lines of effort of the nuclear modernization program should continue as planned, but the authors advocate for increasing diversity in the modernized triad, in terms of both of baseline and regional deterrence capabilities. This may drive hard decisions to reprioritize some modernization programs that offer the same deterrent benefit as the weapons they are replacing. The United States should be willing to accept calculated risks in limited circumstances to free up resources for the development and fielding of systems that offer greater nuclear force diversity. This requires improved processes and structures to make difficult — and informed — prioritization decisions across both the nuclear enterprise and the broader defense industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers should also shift their cultural mindsets and become more risk tolerant — from both a technological perspective and a political perspective — and allow the advanced development communities at DOD laboratories and NNSA national laboratories to experiment more aggressively. This means lowering the barrier to starting and canceling new weapons programs. The national laboratories should be encouraged to experiment and explore various options for the U.S. nuclear stockpile, even when those experiments do not lead to an established weapon in the stockpile every time. Given the trajectory of the global security environment, new technologies could provide policymakers with more flexible options to meet U.S. national objectives — if U.S. scientific and technical communities are permitted to do so. Policymakers should be willing to accept calculated risks to expand opportunities, including the risk of capability failure. The ability to more easily start and cancel programs and embrace truly flexible acquisition strategies would allow U.S. nuclear posture to better adjust to military needs and be more responsive to both positive and negative changes in the security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearshoring the lithium-ion battery supply chain requires substantial policy efforts at every stage. Upstream inputs, such as critical minerals sourcing and processing, are concentrated in a few nations. Although many more countries engage in midstream and downstream processing of critical resources, access to this end of the supply chain is becoming less secure for U.S. manufacturers because of uncertainty in the domestic and geopolitical spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commensurate to the breadth of the challenges is the importance of overcoming them. An adequate, predictable supply of lithium-ion batteries, as well as the supply chain and raw materials, is essential to reaching green transition goals in the United States. These batteries power key products that enable a sustainable, large-scale switch away from fossil fuels essential to long-term environmental goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calls to accelerate the shift to renewables are accompanied by other goals and legislation that have a significant impact on the direction of U.S. economic and trade policy. Recognizing China’s dominance over the supply of several goods critical to U.S. prosperity and security, policymakers say they intend to spur de-risking of these supply chains by diversifying import sources away from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), as well as creating redundancies to protect against potential unforeseen shocks such as pandemics. Policymakers’ de-risking agenda goes hand in hand with government measures designed to bring production of critical goods back to the United States. They perceive renewing U.S. domestic manufacturing capabilities as a geostrategic shield as well as the pathway to creating more profitable and equitable opportunities for workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress and the administration under President Joe Biden have thus undertaken several policies to simultaneously tackle three objectives that will transform the landscape of U.S. lithium-ion battery production, among other sectors. These policies aim to drastically quicken the pace of the U.S. green transition, reshore production capabilities in critical sectors, and diversify away from the PRC’s dominance in these key areas. While these three goals may all be critical to U.S. economic security in the long term, actions that enable the latter two could hamper achievement of the first. Unfortunately, measures aimed at securing the lithium-ion battery supply chain through industrial policy packages that emphasize reshoring threaten to hinder U.S. consumers’ access to this technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief, the second in a series of three, builds upon the first’s findings on refining and processing and examines the production of active materials — the next step of the lithium-ion battery supply chain. The paper first outlines the technical steps necessary for active materials production — namely, mixing, coating, calendaring, and slitting, as well as production of the separator and electrolytes. It then describes current U.S. capabilities at this stage of the supply chain relative to the global market, considering the country’s nearshoring and onshoring ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the brief addresses the Biden administration’s incentives, such as tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and grants programs enabled by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). It continues with an examination of different regulations and their potential impact on the ability of lithium-ion battery input manufacturers to scale up their capabilities in the face of growing demand. Lastly, the report unpacks recent policy recommendations from Congress relevant to lithium-ion battery nearshoring considerations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;manufacturing-a-battery-cell&quot;&gt;Manufacturing a Battery Cell&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;active-materials-production&quot;&gt;Active Materials Production&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical steps.&lt;/strong&gt; After mining or extracting the raw minerals and materials — typically, lithium, cobalt, manganese, nickel, and graphite — processors and refiners purify them. The materials are then used to create cathode and anode active battery materials, which are commonly referred to as the midstream portion of the lithium-ion battery supply chain. Noteworthily, the active material production stage requires complex processes and advanced technologies and chemistries, meaning there are few producers and significant technical barriers to entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the first paper of this series, a lithium-ion battery usually includes multiple lithium-ion cells, which function as interconnected building blocks. A lithium-ion cell is chiefly made up of an anode, a cathode, a separator, and an electrolyte. The anode is the negative electrode in a cell, whereas the positive side is the cathode. During charging, the lithium ions move from the cathode, through the separator, to the anode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cathode component of the lithium-ion battery may comprise various formulations, chemistries, and crystalline structures. Metal oxides like cobalt, nickel, manganese, aluminum, iron, and phosphate, among others, make up the formulations and chemistries known as the cathode active materials (CAMs). Binders and cognitive additives such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are also critical to the battery’s performance, especially for safer and longer-range applications. As mentioned in the first paper of this series, graphite is paramount to anodes, though industry is searching for ways to use alternative materials such as silicon or lithium given that they present opportunities for higher energy density and power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of converting a set of refined and purified critical minerals into functional components of electrodes — namely, a positively charged cathode and a negatively charged anode — may be divided into five key steps. These are mixing, coating, calendaring, slitting, and electrode making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mixing.&lt;/em&gt; The active materials of the cathode, lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt, are dry blended in a planetary vacuum mixer. The active material of the anode is blended to ensure it approaches a viscous consistency. The anode and cathode materials are blended separately to ensure they do not react with one another. A solvent is added to both mixes to increase viscosity, which is critical as the viscosity, density, and solid content of the slurry affect battery longevity and performance. An additional key concern in the mixing process is air quality: controls on moisture level can limit air particles or impurities that contaminate the electrode slurry, but if moisture is not controlled, then the nickel is likely to corrode. Adding phosphoric acid or another solvent can also prevent corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coating.&lt;/em&gt; Coating broadly describes the process of applying the separate aluminum-cathode and copper-anode slurries onto metal foils. Once poured, the slurries are dried via an internal heater that operates between 70°C and 150°C. While warmer temperatures lead to lower production costs, there is a negative effect on the performance and overall longevity of the battery. Coating and drying are achieved via a slot die coater, which disperses the slurry through gaps onto moving metal foil. Once the slurry is dispersed, air flotation drying is used to evaporate any added solvents and provoke the sedimentation of particles, which is critical to battery performance. The newfound metal coating successfully protects the slurry from corrosion and damage. Both drying temperature and the speed at which drying occurs affect the distribution of slurry in each electrode. Generally, drying at room temperature, while slower, creates a more uniform dried slurry, thereby increasing the quality and longevity of the electrode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Calendaring.&lt;/em&gt; Calendaring occurs through compression of the coated electrodes onto collector metal foils. This improves the energy density of the battery and further controls for dust and humidity within the electrode. This compression to a point of even thickness and density of the dried slurry increases performance. A roller calendar is used during this stage. Generally, higher calendaring pressure increases the energy density of a given battery, thereby increasing battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slitting and electrode making.&lt;/em&gt; A roller slitting machine then cuts the coated electrode into several slices. An electrode-making machine welds and cuts the electrode, and the anode, cathode, and separator are either stacked or wound into a spiral, depending on the type of battery. The machine clearly marks each side as “+ve” or “–ve,” and the electrolyte fluid (a lithium salt solution) is injected into the battery cylinder or pouch. The battery cell is then sealed and thus ready for use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Separator production.&lt;/em&gt; Separators may be manufactured via a dry or wet process. Regardless, they are made of either polypropylene or polyethylene (types of plastic). In the dry process, either plastic type is pushed through a machine to create a thin sheet. The sheet is then heated until the plastic melts. This step controls the size and alignment of the tiny crystal structures within the sheet that allow lithium ions to pass through once the battery is functional. The sheet is then stretched again to create a set of additional slit-like holes. The stretching occurs until the sheet has a porosity of roughly 40 percent. The wet process, in contrast, involves mixing softening agents that can turn polymers into plastics once heat is applied. The heated mixture is pushed out of a machine to form a sheet, which is stretched until a network of pores is present. The softening agent is then washed out, leaving a porous surface that allows lithium ions through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrolyte solution production.&lt;/em&gt; Electrolytes enable the conductivity of lithium-ion batteries by allowing for the movement of ions from the cathode to the anode when the battery is charging and from the anode to the cathode when the battery is in use. Electrolyte solutions are made up of soluble salts, acids, and other bases in a liquid format. When these solutions are mixed with various carbonates, such as vinylene carbonate, conductivity can increase, leading to improved battery performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;current-us-capabilities&quot;&gt;Current U.S. Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands, China dominates the active materials production portion of the lithium battery supply chain. In addition, South Korea and Japan have significant capacity. The United States finds itself a distant fourth, a position where it is likely to remain for 10 years despite significant investment. As of 2022, China produced roughly 90 percent of anodes and lithium electrolyte solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also produces 70 percent of cathodes, 74 percent of separators, 82 percent of electrolytes, and 85 percent of anodes. Japan, a secondary player in the industry, produces 14 percent of cathodes, 11 percent of anodes, 31 percent of separators, and 19 percent of electrode solutions. South Korea manufactures 15 percent of the world’s cathodes and 3 percent of anodes. The United States occupies a far more modest role in the supply chain than its peers in East Asia, responsible for roughly 7 percent of battery production. It imports most components, such as cathodes and anodes, from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One factor that hampers onshoring efforts in the United States is the high cost of production. Whereas the average lithium ferrophosphate cell factory in China costs $650 million to build, it costs roughly $865 million to build a similar facility in the United States or Europe due to differences in labor costs and supporting facilities. This difference in cost has created a global status quo that has favored, and will continue to favor, Chinese hegemony over the midstream. While the United States is predicted to see battery production increase to roughly 1.2 terawatt-hours (TWh) by 2030, corresponding increases in Chinese production will ensure most global battery production continues to occur in China. By 2030 the United States is set to produce 0.8 million metric tons of cathodes per annum, though demand will stand at 1.3 million metric tons. Domestic anode supply will also stand at roughly 500,000 metric tons per annum, with demand hovering at 700,000 metric tons. These shortfalls will therefore drive the importation of cell components, such as cathodes and anodes, for locally produced batteries. Nonetheless, domestic demand for battery cells in the 2030s will likely outstrip the supply of battery active materials despite increases in domestic manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s dominance over commodities critical to the lithium-ion battery supply chain — along with the PRC’s internal demand for lithium-ion battery products, chief among them electric vehicles (EVs) — has a marked effect on the global prices of these commodities. In recent years, an annual doubling of Chinese demand for EVs has caused prices of key minerals and battery components to remain elevated. While demand is still increasing as of 2023, the rate of increase has slowed to only 30 percent. Analysts predict this leveling off of demand will continue in the coming years and that the era of annual doubling has ended.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This reduction in demand has led to a 50 percent decrease in nickel futures since December 2022 and an 80 percent decrease in lithium carbonate prices. The oversupply of critical minerals resulting from the relative drop in Chinese demand is further exacerbated by the fact that nations that produce critical minerals used in EVs — such as those in the Lithium Triangle (Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia) and Indonesia, which produces nickel — have drastically increased their investment in mines in the hope that demand would continue to double annually for the coming few years. To that end, annual lithium production increased by 23 percent worldwide in 2023, while nickel output grew by 10 percent, according to U.S. Geological Survey estimates.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In response to this decrease in prices, China’s government is planning to increase the size of its strategic stockpiles of cobalt by buying up 3,000 tons of privately owned cobalt from producers to add to the nation’s commodity stockpile. China added 5,000 tons of cobalt to its stockpile in July, representing another opportunity to take advantage of low cobalt prices, which have decreased by 60 percent since May 2022 due to rising supplies from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Indonesia. These stockpiles are being expanded to protect domestic producers and military manufacturers from supply and price shocks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While S&amp;amp;P Global projects that commodity prices will stabilize in the coming years, existing price volatility poses a challenge for new firms entering the industry. Firms that are profitable while commodity prices are low, for example, may be forced to shut down prematurely if prices of lithium carbonate spike. Both nascent and long-standing firms therefore require some protection from the ebbs and flows of the market.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;To that end, China acts to protect its domestic battery industry from external shocks by enforcing export license requirements on graphite, which is regarded as the most critical mineral for battery anodes. Given the market for graphite is expected to triple in the next five years and that China produces more than 90 percent of spherical graphite — the type primarily used in batteries — export licensing efforts give China leverage over the price and global supply of both graphite and anodes. Adoption of the export license requirement comes on the heels of an August 2023 rule that requires export licenses for rare earth elements gallium and germanium, which are both primarily used in semiconductors, though they have applications in EVs as well. For instance, gallium nitride can handle a lot of power without generating heat, making it ideal for onboard chargers and inverters. The new export license requirement led to a sharp increase of 25 percent in gallium prices, which has remained constant since. More critically, these curbs highlight China’s willingness to use export license requirements as a means to control the supply and price of key minerals in the supply chains of electric appliance components.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This export licensing effort serves two PRC objectives. The first is a means of geopolitical leverage, especially against nations that have tense relations with China despite significant trade, such as the United States. The second is an attempt to boost the competitiveness of China’s domestic high-value industries. To that end, Beijing increased the number of restrictions on critical raw materials needed for electric cars and renewable energy, such as lithium, cobalt, and manganese, by a factor of nine between 2009 and 2020.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recycling&quot;&gt;Recycling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the demand for lithium-ion batteries continues to grow, efficient recycling methods become increasingly relevant. The minerals and raw materials involved in producing a lithium-ion battery can be scarce and costly to extract and refine. Recycling lithium-ion batteries is therefore less energy intensive than producing new batteries from raw minerals. A thriving recycling industry enables lithium-ion battery manufacturers to bypass the challenges of the upstream stages of the supply chain and closes the loop of the circular economy by enabling additional cell production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their easily separable and durable components, traditional lead-acid batteries are relatively simple to recycle. Over 90 percent of lead-acid batteries are recycled as a result. The recycling process for lithium-ion batteries, however, is substantially more complex since lithium is highly reactive (flammable). Typically, devices that contain lithium-ion batteries are collected by the original retailers, an e-waste collector, or a business that specializes in collecting used electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battery packs are sorted and shipped to collection and processing facilities. Some packs are designated for repair or reuse. Those that are not undergo a process called shredding, through which the battery is chopped into pieces, creating a “black mass” — granular material made up of the dismembered cathodes and anodes of batteries. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), there are currently no industry standards defining the exact components of black mass from which valuable metals like cobalt and nickel are extracted. The shredding and extraction processes require a relatively high amount of energy, decreasing the extracted components’ value and creating some disincentives for reprocessing. Additionally, the lack of common regulations or standards for EV battery recycling, particularly advanced chemical processes for recycling as well as restrictions on the trade of used batteries, serve as additional limiting incentives for reprocessing and recycling efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to these issues, the U.S. Department of Energy has devoted $62 million in funding set forth in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law toward efforts that entice consumers to engage in battery recycling and improve the overall economic viability of private recycling efforts. Examples of these investments include $14.4 million in student education and outreach programs that will strengthen collection efforts for end-of-life electronics and $40 million toward projects that generate “greater market demand for recycling consumer electronics batteries” through cost-savings approaches within the preprocessing and sorting sectors. Government and private sector efforts to establish battery drop-off programs also received $7.2 million in funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;promoting-active-materials-production&quot;&gt;Promoting Active Materials Production&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key to U.S. economic security is the assurance that critical goods — among which lithium-ion batteries are included given their importance to the green transition — have resilient and secure supply chains. The lithium-ion battery supply chain is currently dominated by countries of concern and a just-in-time model that can withstand neither geopolitical fragmentation nor black swan economic shocks. In particular, U.S. dependence on PRC inputs reflects a long-term risk to national security that should be addressed. U.S. economic partners and allies are currently in a better position to satisfy demand for active materials: nearshoring and friendshoring efforts therefore represent a necessary step toward countering such dependence. Another important piece of the puzzle is to promote domestic production. The Biden administration and Congress have leveraged several policy tools to spur the latter, such as tax incentives, grants, and loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The lithium-ion battery supply chain is currently dominated by countries of concern and a just-in-time model that can withstand neither geopolitical fragmentation nor black swan economic shocks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;biden-administration-policies&quot;&gt;Biden Administration Policies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tax incentives.&lt;/strong&gt; Current tax incentives included in recent industrial policy packages — chief among them the IRA — aim to provide a launchpad for domestic manufacturers. They are meant to spur production of multiple goods necessary to the green transition, including the active materials production stage of the lithium-ion battery supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to producing electrode materials, such as anodes and cathodes, the IRA’s 45X advanced manufacturing production tax credit (PTC) is a boon for U.S. manufacturers. With eligible materials receiving a credit of 10 percent of the cost of production, the PTC is designed to support development of the active materials production stage of the supply chain. The tax credit applies to both equipment and minerals produced in the United States and sold between December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2032. Further, the produced equipment must be sold to an unrelated party as part of the taxpayer’s trade or business. There is a credit amount phaseout beginning in 2030 for only the manufactured components, but credits for critical minerals will expire without phasing out over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the effectiveness of this tax credit is somewhat limited as it applies to specific production costs only. It does not cover direct or indirect material costs, nor does it include expenses related to the extraction, production, or acquisition of raw materials. These exclusions limit the overall utility of the credit in boosting domestic production of electrode active materials and instead ensure that it is only an impetus for production for firms at the margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another supply-side incentive the IRA provides is the 48C investment credit, awarded by the Department of Treasury in partnership with the Department of Energy. It awards credits of up to 30 percent of capital investment, provided the relevant project satisfies wage and apprenticeship requirements. This incentive has more regulatory barriers than the 45X credit, as project developers must apply to the Department of Energy and receive a decision from the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, total financing for the investment credit is capped at $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 48C investment credit is geared toward bridging the gap between the required capital expenditures to develop factories in the United States and China. According to Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, the capital expenditure intensity in the United States averages around $90 million per gigawatt-hour (GWh), about a third higher than the $60 million per GWh capital expenditure required in the PRC. China clearly maintains the dominant position in access to raw materials, processing capabilities, and active materials production. Nevertheless, the investment credit helps enhance U.S. competitiveness. U.S. gigafactory capacity in the pipeline through 2030 has increased by roughly 70 percent, from around 700 GWh in July 2022 (before the IRA) to just over 1.2 TWh in July 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grants and loans.&lt;/strong&gt; While the United States is currently not a major player in refining and active material assembly, significant amounts of onshore capacity are expected to come online in the coming years. Spurred by government-backed loans and private investments totaling $1.6 billion, firms such as Our Next Energy are set to begin producing 20 GWh of cathode materials and battery cells in a Michigan plant set to come online in late 2024. Plans for the gigafactory were announced in October 2022, giving it an ambitious timeline of roughly two years between the announcement of additional capacity and that capacity coming online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two-to-three-year timeline also applies to gigafactory projects that Redwood Materials, Tesla, and Gotion are currently pursuing. These factories, which will focus on cathode production, anode manufacturing, and lithium refining, respectively, will collectively amount to 200 GWh in capacity once operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the rollout of these gigafactories is already experiencing some setbacks. Ford announced it would pause development of a 35 GWh plant worth $3.5 billion in Michigan. Delays in battery cell factories coming online arise largely due to shortages in skilled labor, efficiency limitations, and unforeseen price increases for active materials. In recent years, pricing hurdles were driven by a surge in lithium carbonate prices from roughly $6 per kilogram in 2020 to $70 per kilogram in November of 2022. Since cathode active materials represent roughly 50 percent of total manufacturing costs for battery cells, such increases have placed barriers to entry on expanding battery cell manufacturing capacity. Yet in the last two years, these increases have largely reversed, and prices have plummeted back to $14.50 per kilogram. While this value is almost three times higher than in 2020, the effect of pricing concerns on gigafactory rollout is far more modest than it was in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, U.S. workers may lack the necessary manufacturing experience, effectively ensuring that even when plants and gigafactories come online, they will not produce active materials with high efficiency. Gigafactory construction requires a set of competencies related to “equipment maintenance [and] troubleshooting production” not widely available within the U.S. workforce. Additionally, once factories have begun producing materials and finished cells, they also face assembly line staff shortages, as the U.S. workforce is largely trained in internal combustion engine manufacturing rather than in battery production. Ohio, for instance, has 58,000 open roles related to EV manufacturing. Aside from competencies, another cause of this labor shortage is the relatively low compensation levels compared to the broader automotive sector. The starting wage at a GM battery cell plant in Ohio is $16.50 an hour, while the average assembly line worker at a United Auto Workers plant makes roughly $28 an hour. While lower wages serve as a hedge against active material price increases, they also ensure labor shortages going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial production yields for battery cell lines among new entrants to the sector in the United States are often as low as 50 percent. As shown by the Center on Global Energy Policy, projections through 2032 clearly show North America will have the gigafactories to satisfy cell demand but will not have the local supply of cathodes and anodes to construct those cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s EPA sees lithium-ion battery recycling and repurposing as a means of domesticating this lithium-ion battery supply chain, particularly since U.S. lithium reserves make up just 4 percent of the world total. In the near term, the EPA seeks to take the following steps to encourage these processes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Foster the design of battery packs for ease of second use and recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish successful methods for collecting, sorting, transporting, and processing recycled lithium-ion battery materials, with a focus on reducing costs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase recovery rates of key materials such as cobalt, lithium, nickel, and graphite.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop processing technologies to reintroduce these materials into the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop methodologies for proper sorting, testing, and balancing for second-use applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish federal recycling policies to promote collection, reuse, and recycling of lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IIJA grant disbursement notes that the focus of the funding is primarily on lithium processing, with nickel and graphite processors also receiving some grant money. The IIJA guidebook provides a comprehensive overview of all IIJA programs and grants, including several focused on active materials production and battery recycling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battery Manufacturing and Recycling Grants ($3 billion total)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battery and Critical Mineral Recycling ($125 million total)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lithium-Ion Recycling Prize ($10 million total)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Battery Recycling Best Practices ($10 million total)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electric Drive Vehicle Battery Recycling and Second Life Applications ($200 million total)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Energy also announced $192 million in funding in June 2023 to expand battery recycling research and development, calling the investments “essential” to the advancement of a domestic supply chain of critical materials for the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Biden administration’s investments in recycling capabilities may face similar roadblocks as the active materials production hubs. In October 2023, Li-Cycle Holdings Corp., which was set to receive significant backing from the Biden administration, saw its share price cut by almost 50 percent after announcing it would pause construction on a lithium-ion battery recycling plant. Li-Cycle assessed that it was facing escalating costs in attempting to operationalize its fabrication plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While battery recycling is a relatively new market in North America, more mature firms abroad are also encountering issues. In the PRC, for instance, there are too many recyclers and not enough materials to go around, making many businesses’ operations currently untenable. It may take several years for recycling to become a viable industry in the United States: there are still relatively few EVs on the road, and other electronics that contain lithium-ion batteries are challenging to collect and too few in number to meet the needs of budding lithium-ion battery demand. Thus, the sector may encounter losses before becoming sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;congressional-considerations&quot;&gt;Congressional Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report by the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, released in December 2023, offers some insight into the bipartisan ad hoc committee’s thinking on diversifying the lithium-ion battery supply chain. The report’s recommendations may be split into two categories: those that pertain to critical minerals and those that pertain to battery manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to critical minerals, the committee’s report recommends enacting legislation to “encourage sectoral agreements with key trading partners and allies with strong rules of origin and high standards on critical minerals,” in addition to sourcing critical minerals and materials domestically and from friendly nations. This demonstrated openness to ensuring U.S. partners and allies become a stronger part of the country’s critical minerals supply chain, instead of solely focusing on onshoring, could enable lithium-ion battery manufacturers to scale up their production capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the report recommends incentives with domestic content requirement guardrails that partially defeat the friendshoring purpose of the overarching recommendations. Limiting the sourcing of necessary minerals and materials to U.S. production in part negates the diversification objectives in these tax credits. The enhanced recycling measures the report recommends — such as requiring the Defense Logistics Agency Strategic Material Recovery and Reuse Program to pilot a recovery program to extract strategic and critical materials from end-of-life government hard disk drives — would likely not make up, in time or amount, for the production capabilities of U.S. partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report’s recommendations about batteries pose a similar issue, as its proposals largely emphasize the need to “encourage a domestic battery recycling industry.” Ramping up recycling efforts could help the U.S. lithium-ion battery industry become self-sufficient as more batteries are retired, while limiting incentives to domestic efforts would curtail U.S. access to additional lithium-ion battery materials. In addition, recycling is a technically challenging, labor-intensive process. Given the difficulties, it would not wholly replace production of original active materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, coordinating the ramping up of recycling operations with economic partners and allies who are also aiming to enhance their capabilities in this sector would enable more effective diversification results. U.S. efforts are not occurring in isolation: the EU lithium-ion battery recycling market is set to increase to 130 GWh, or 700 kilotons, by 2030. In addition, the EU market is set to expand again, threefold, by 2040 to 2,100 kilotons. Japan and South Korea are also aiming to expand their battery recycling industries. For instance, key Japanese firms have collaborated with the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, a state-owned energy research agency, to develop technology that increases their capacity to extract recyclable materials from used batteries. This initiative is set to enable a recycling ratio of 70 percent for lithium, 95 percent for nickel, and 95 percent for cobalt by 2030. South Korea is also investing some 40 trillion won ($30 billion) to facilitate recycling efforts and second-life applications for used battery components. A U.S. strategy that prioritizes working with partners who are also investing in their own capabilities would improve the likelihood of successful diversification away from China and an effective transition to renewables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second stage of the lithium-ion battery supply chain examined in this paper — active materials production destined for cathodes and anodes — poses challenges to current onshoring policies. It demands physical capital and labor to accomplish technical work. Active materials production involves several steps — namely, mixing, coating, calendaring, slitting, and electrode making — in addition to producing the separator and electrolyte solution key to the functioning of a lithium-ion battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, China largely dominates this portion of the lithium battery supply chain, followed by South Korea and Japan. China’s dominance is strengthened by its sway over the production of inputs higher up the supply chain, as well as its strong influence over the global prices of key commodities. The United States is also limited by higher costs in penetrating the market, given its relative dearth of operational manufacturing capabilities and challenges in obtaining workers, which stem both from more robust labor standards and the lack of a sufficiently trained workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policies that emphasize onshoring capabilities in the active materials production stage of the lithium-ion battery supply chain are already confronted with the limitations of U.S. capacity. Projects launched by grants and loans under the IIJA and IRA are facing various hurdles, such as inadequacies in the domestic labor market as well as difficulties in making a nascent recycling industry profitable. These barriers are in part self-imposed by restrictions around domestic content requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Policies that emphasize onshoring capabilities in the active materials production stage of the lithium-ion battery supply chain are already confronted with the limitations of U.S. capacity.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, current congressional considerations and recommendations on providing the sector with additional launchpads also turn largely inward, hindering the green transition and impeding the country’s ability to successfully diversify away from Chinese manufacturing dominance. Given that other large players at this stage — namely, Japan and South Korea — are valuable partners in achieving long-term U.S. geostrategic objectives, U.S. policymakers should revisit the limitations set on incentives designed to spur active materials production. In addition, the United States should recognize that foreign direct investment from partners and allies has played an essential role in stimulating the domestic battery sector. Further efforts should be made to deepen ties with these nations and encourage additional investment. Ideally, policymakers should turn to negotiating plurilateral agreements with major players to secure this stage of the battery manufacturing supply chain. More ambitious agreements would enable partners to coordinate industrial policy efforts, enhance information sharing for research and development efforts in the field to improve manufacturing efficiency, and eliminate trade barriers in critical goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business community is currently engaged in reassessing the risk of doing business with the PRC given potential supply chain resiliency risks. In light of current geopolitical tensions, private entities now are striving to create redundancies in supply sources to mitigate the consequences of large-scale shocks on current choke points. The United States, along with economic partners and allies, is also moving to de-risk supply chains, but the cornerstone of the Biden administration strategy is to spur domestic production anchored by industrial policy initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts overlap with the push to spur a green transition, for which the lithium-ion battery is a key technology. However, if diversifying supply chains away from China occurs too soon, achieving enough domestic capabilities to effectively spur the green transition in the United States will not be possible. Likewise, a diversification strategy that does not consider the benefits of nearshoring will prove lengthy and costly. In addition, the United States should develop an effective materials management policy that incentivizes development of additional supply chains and regulatory cooperation with like-minded countries. This policy should be pursued in a manner that does not hamper domestic manufacturers from investing or commercializing products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the United States is pursuing three goals: accelerating the transition to renewables; reshoring production capabilities in key sectors, which include several items necessary to the green transition; and diversifying away from China in these critical areas. Policies that prioritize one of these goals get in the way of the other two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, nearshoring and friendshoring considerations lead to questions of what it means to be “near” and a “friend.” In addition, lithium-ion batteries are the current bedrock of a transition to renewables, but there are numerous research projects underway aiming to find more efficient alternatives. The final paper of this series will discuss both of these issues, in addition to describing policy challenges surrounding the final stage of the lithium-ion battery supply chain — the assembly of battery cells into modules, packed and sold to manufacturers of various end products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late March 2024, the Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI, with the support of Copenhagen-based policy centre Think Tank EUROPA, hosted a roundtable in Copenhagen. The roundtable, along with a series of one-on-one meetings, discussed the state of sanctions implementation and enforcement in Denmark. None of the discussions in the event are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gatherings included representatives from national authorities with sanctions-related competences, as well as sanctions and compliance experts from financial institutions and Danish industrial groups, compliance experts from leading law firms, representatives from the industry group Danish Shipping, and other advisers. These included, among others, representatives from the Danish Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs; the Danish Customs Agency (DCA); the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark (MFA); the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority; the National Special Crime Unit; and other relevant agencies. This event is part of the in-country engagements conducted by the CFS-led European Sanctions and the Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), supported by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;denmarks-decentralised-sanctions-implementation&quot;&gt;Denmark’s Decentralised Sanctions Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable began with a discussion of the division of authority and responsibility for sanctions in Denmark, and the significant adaptations required since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation considered Denmark’s preparedness for the Russia sanctions following the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) fourth round of mutual evaluations, the scope of which included implementation of targeted financial sanctions. Denmark’s mutual evaluation report was concluded in 2017 and its subsequent follow-up process ended in 2021, which a government representative at the roundtable said had helped the country to prepare for expanded sanctions. They noted that Denmark was evaluated as “partially compliant” for Recommendation 7 related to targeted financial sanctions for proliferation financing, but was upgraded to “largely compliant” in the follow-up report in 2021. Addressing these gaps had, a representative said, helped the country’s preparations, but it had not been possible to prepare fully for the sanctioning of a country with which the EU as a whole had such significant economic ties, compared to jurisdictions that are subject to sanctions regimes covered by the FATF Standards and have been for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denmark has more than 25 authorities with some role in or oversight of sanctions responsibility – relatively higher than other member states where SIFMANet has held similar roundtables. The MFA is the authority with overall responsibility for coordinating the sanctions policy of the Danish government. Since 2022, the Danish “EU-Special Committee on Sanctions” and taskforces have expanded to include additional government bodies, ranging from utilities to cultural ministries. Government representatives highlighted the enhanced coordination that had been put into practice in Denmark. Steps included the establishment of a central sanctions coordinator team, vested in a newly established economic security unit in the MFA, and new intra-governmental procedures, as well as a governmental taskforce to counter circumvention, with participation from relevant national Danish authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although government representatives said that this coordination between a wider group had improved effectiveness, dividing responsibility for implementation and guidance across numerous national competent authorities may also increase the risk of fragmentation in approach. This was underscored by comments from private sector participants, who said that there had been “inter-agency problems on who’s responsible for what”. One participant said that some questions had “circled for some time” as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lacking-national-guidance-on-eu-regulations&quot;&gt;Lacking National Guidance on EU Regulations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One source of frustration expressed by private sector participants at the roundtable was the Danish government’s reluctance to interpret European law and regulations or provide answers to specific questions, given that the debate had taken place in Brussels. One participant said that while interpretation of Danish law would take into account written remarks about the law, no such written remarks are provided for EU law and, they said, “we can only look at what the law says”. This representative also said the Danish government’s role was to provide guidance, “not counselling”. Other government representatives said they had provided as much guidance as possible, but that the scale of requests had been unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector participants were frustrated with this position. They agreed that they found the EU FAQs helpful, but insisted these should be expanded further. While they appreciated the guidance that had been shared by the Danish government, they said it was both too limited and too slow. One representative of a Danish maritime industry group said that they had sent 75 to 100 requests to Danish authorities and had not yet received a clear response. Another participant, from a law firm, said the process was time-consuming and that it “can be difficult to get answers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, some participants said that, over time, they had stopped seeking formal clarification on the sanctions, because of concerns about privacy in the event of freedom of information requests being made to the government. One participant said they preferred to liaise through informal discussions. A business association representative also said companies had stopped seeking clarification on other matters for fear of receiving an answer that blocked a particular transaction. Overall, some private sector participants expressed their frustration that their community continued to have more experience and expertise in sanctions implementation than the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-sector-information-sharing&quot;&gt;Private Sector Information Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these obstacles, a business association representative said there was an overall positive public–private dialogue, and a general perception that Danish business wants to do right thing. Participants from both public and private sectors reiterated several times the importance of trust in the business environment, and a government representative said they were highly aware of companies’ willingness to comply, as well as the public support for their doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another positive aspect highlighted was sharing information within the private sector, with more experienced companies sharing tools and information with smaller businesses, in order to support their compliance with the regulations. This was seen as an important support for business, given the “huge gap in compliance readiness” that a business association representative noticed among smaller companies. One participant from a multinational company said this information-sharing practice had been much more widespread in Denmark than in other European member states, an assertion supported by SIFMANet visits to other EU member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government-led efforts include not only the establishment of sanctions taskforces among authorities, but also substantial outreach to the private sector. This outreach included a notification that Danish authorities sent to over 1,500 companies containing information on their sanctions obligations and encouraging them to get in touch and ask for support. In addition, the Danish Business Authority has sent out targeted letters in relation to circumvention, including compliance guidance, to approximately 200 economic operators. Danish authorities had an existing relationship with obliged entities, but the government decided to engage with all companies, given the expansive nature of the Russia sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;misalignment-between-banks-and-corporates&quot;&gt;Misalignment Between Banks and Corporates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the corporate sector, including industrial and shipping companies, expressed frustration with the banking sector, which they said had taken an overly narrow approach to allowing certain transactions – beyond what was required by the law. One participant said it was as if “every taxi driver had to ask clients what they were doing before accepting their fare”. A bank representative said the requirement to comply on the product side had fundamentally changed how financial institutions approach sanctions risk, while another participant said that they now viewed certain types of business activities as high risk, where these would not have been before 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another participant, from a business association, said that several of their members had completed all compliance steps required for a certain transaction, but the banks had still refused to allow it. However, a representative from a bank said that non-US companies “need to step up”. They referred to the risks highlighted in the December 2023 amendments to US Executive Order 14024, which strengthened the US’ ability to sanction financial institutions facilitating and funding supplies to the Russian military–industrial complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, representatives from corporates also acknowledged that there was a lack of regulation of that sector, compared to the financial industry. There is no specific “know your customer” requirement for much of Danish industry, which meant that it was challenging to convince boards to allocate resources to sanctions compliance. Meanwhile, banks now demand more compliance procedures, and have higher standards for their corporate clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, participants from both banks and corporates cited a perception that the strictness of their compliance was harming their competitiveness compared to their European peers. They said this was a “significant” concern. Representatives of the shipping industry said that the country as a whole was now a “risk-poor environment”, with many shipping companies taking overly conservative approaches to international business, resulting in a negative impact on both that industry and the business environment overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area that was highlighted several times was product classification. Given the dominance of the shipping and trade sectors in Denmark, classification was a significant issue, with participants highlighting the difficulties of getting a classification on tariff codes from customs and a dual-use designation decision. Some participants agreed that there continued to be public sector resourcing issues relating to the EU sanctions over the critical goods and technologies listed under Annex VII of Council Regulation (EU) 833/2014. However, another participant mentioned that the DCA can provide Binding Tariff Information decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enforcement-and-the-shadow-of-the-dan-bunkering-case&quot;&gt;Enforcement and the Shadow of the Dan-Bunkering Case&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion then turned to the topic of enforcement, and numerous participants referred to the case of Dan-Bunkering, which was prosecuted in Denmark in 2021 for shipping $101 million in jet fuel to Syria from Kaliningrad. This case was seen by several participants as a model of enforcement. However, a representative of a business association said this represented a specific case, in which a business “wilfully turned a blind eye” to government guidance. In this way, they said, the Dan-Bunkering case was not representative of Danish business practices. Nevertheless, the experience clearly cast a shadow across public and private sector alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procedural questions of how investigations were initiated were also discussed, with prosecutors highlighting that many cases began with administrative infractions, escalating into cooperation between police and competent authorities. This procedure, another government representative said, had been set up after the Dan-Bunkering case, which had provided many opportunities to clarify procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from the Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs said many investigations began with the relevant Danish authority conducting a review of the news media for negative reports or requesting documents from exporters to identify suspicious information. This information was then evaluated for potential indications of misconduct before the authority decided whether to escalate the matter to police (and potentially onwards to prosecutors). Since 2022, Danish authorities have evaluated 140 potential breaches, they said, and there were around 40 open cases. So far, six matters had been reported to police. At the same time, a customs representative said there were other steps before any potential breaches were reported, including a hearing on customs declarations, and so there was “a lot of enforcement going on behind the scenes” before any case is reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants said these statistics highlighted the difficulty of comparing enforcement between different EU member states, with no centralised reporting of enforcement from the EU’s Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union. A participant from a business association said these figures were also likely to be much higher than the number of actual criminal cases, since many issues related to goods that were unintentionally misdeclared, due to the aforementioned classification difficulties, rather than deliberate evasion or circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this point from the business association, the customs representative responded that, in the majority of cases relating to possible breaches of import and export prohibitions, the DCA will go through several steps ahead of any potential filing of a police report. This includes a consultation process with the responsible party (usually the declarer), in which they are informed that the customs declaration is in possible breach of sanctions. The party will then be able to provide documentation for potential misdeclarations, so that the declaration can be corrected. Only if the responsible party is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient documentation that their goods are not in violation of sanctions will a police report be filed. Therefore, they argued, the figure is unlikely to be inflated by “unintentional misdeclarations” and similar declaration-related mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, participants discussed Denmark’s criminal enforcement regime for sanctions breaches, which requires proof of negligence or intent. Some participants found Denmark to have relatively high standards for criminal enforcement, and advocated for civil enforcement or other mechanisms with lower standards for deployment. Private sector representatives added that they would welcome a civil enforcement regime in Denmark, as this would allow voluntary self-disclosures and more dialogue between the public and private sectors, allowing companies to “come clean” if they have inadvertently breached sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, other participants said that widening enforcement action could damage the collaborative and cooperative nature of the public–private dialogue as well as the dialogue between private sector actors. They instead urged the government to publish findings from its investigations and reviews, even those that do not reach the standards for a criminal prosecution, as these would allow companies to learn from issues other entities have faced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danish authorities and the private sector clearly reiterated their commitment to implementing and enforcing sanctions within Denmark at this roundtable. One particularly positive aspect of this was the commitment to information sharing in the private sector, both within business associations and between peers within industry. The roundtable discussions also demonstrated open and frank dialogue regarding the need for more guidance and support from the public sector, and authorities’ receptivity to these messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government’s ability to provide guidance and clear responses to queries appeared to be hampered by the spread of sanctions implementation responsibility across a large number of national competent authorities, to the degree that private sector actors complained of questions “circling” among various agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the Danish authorities’ limitation on providing guidance on EU regulation, beyond what is stated in the wording and FAQs as adopted in Brussels, also poses practical difficulties and raised frustration within the private sector. Business representatives urged the government to share more information on its interpretations, including potentially on anonymised determinations by customs and other authorities in pre-enforcement investigations and analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions also highlighted the potential gap in enforcement for sanctions breaches that occur due to conduct that falls below Denmark’s criminal standard. This may create a gap between Danish enforcement practice and that of other member states. At the same time, Danish business perceived its own practice as overly compliant, in comparison to other EU member states, raising concerns about Denmark’s competitiveness. Further alignment with other member states would address such concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, like many EU member states, Denmark has discovered that the key to successful sanctions implementation starts with coordination across the wide range of agencies and departments that find themselves involved in the Russia sanctions regime. It has also discovered that investment in relations with the private sector – the frontline of implementation – is critical if the country is to play its part in restricting the funding, and particularly the resourcing, of Russia’s illegal war of aggression in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（5日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第89日審訊。控方播放餘下的影片和錄音，其中一段錄音為《蘋果》英文版會議錄音，有與會者提出集中做內地維權新聞等，並做一些《南華早報》不會做的新聞。黎認同：「啫係做番真實嘅新聞。」他亦提議多做一些較有人情味的新聞，並以講述疫情期間武漢情況的《方方日記》為例。預料控方於下周二完成控方案情；黎智英一方將有中段陳詞，要求法庭裁定3項控罪表證不成立。控辯雙方將提交書面陳詞，並暫定於7月9日續審，以在庭上作口頭陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英手機內影片發自羅傑斯和裴倫德&quot;&gt;黎智英手機內影片發自羅傑斯和裴倫德&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續播放於黎智英手機 WhatsApp 或 Twitter 發現的影片，部份影片的傳送人為「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）或「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC）創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中一段影片為2020年8月19日時任美國總統特朗普出席記者會，其後黎在 Twitter 轉發該影片。有記者問到特朗普對於港府拘捕黎智英有什麼回應。特朗普表示聽說黎是一個「勇敢的人（brave man）」和「很棒的人（wonderful gentleman）」，他指美國會投放大量資金在香港，資助和促進美國與香港之間的貿易。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上播蘋果英文版會議錄音-與會者主張集中內地維權新聞&quot;&gt;庭上播《蘋果》英文版會議錄音 與會者主張集中內地維權新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一段錄音是由黎智英傳送給時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏，顯示黎智英與《蘋果》員工開會討論英文版方針。黎提到翻譯《方方日記》及轉載，該書講述作家方方在疫情期間身處武漢的經歷，惟另一人指有版權問題要處理，黎則提議只抽書本一小部份轉載。另有人提出集中做內地維權新聞、訪問大學教授等，做一些《南華早報》不會做的新聞。黎認同：「啫係做番真實嘅新聞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;會議談及邀請專欄作家替《蘋果》英文版撰文，黎提及邀請「沈月」，而中國組同事則提醒該作者名稱叫「呂月」而非「沈月」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有人歸納英文版新聞可以分兩個範疇，一是有關自由、民主、人權；二是有關香港企業被「染紅」、被內地企業收購的新聞。黎指其私人助手 Mark Simon 正在邀請外國政治人物訂閱英文版，中國組則負責搜尋新聞題材，主要集中內地人權對香港的影響，以及邀請作者撰寫評論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張劍虹提議加入諷刺大陸嘅漫畫&quot;&gt;張劍虹提議加入「諷刺大陸嘅漫畫」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;英文版主管方面，黎明言不覺得林和立勝任，因他年紀大，他需要比較年輕、有活力的人擔任統籌，例如專欄作家馮睎乾，惟不知道馮對內地新聞是否熟悉。黎亦提議多做一些較有人情味的新聞，並再次以《方方日記》為例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹亦是與會者之一，他提出英文版加入「諷刺大陸嘅漫畫」，除了硬新聞之外，每日連載政治漫畫也不會浪費版位。有人提議邀請政治漫畫家尊子，惟不肯定他有否留意中國內地新聞，需要先聯絡他商討。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上播放語音訊息-黎智英邀李兆富等人提供帖文內容-例如美國人有興趣的話題&quot;&gt;庭上播放語音訊息 黎智英邀李兆富等人提供帖文內容 例如美國人有興趣的話題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2020年5月2日黎智英向李兆富（Simon Lee，筆名「利世民」）傳送一則語音訊息，李當時回覆：「我會與他們商討。」庭上播放該段語音訊息，黎指他剛剛開設 Twitter 個人帳戶，預料會有很多人追蹤，所以希望李兆富邀請盧峯（馮偉光）和桑普等人，每日提供一些短文或寫文章時的想法，以及美國人有興趣的話題，以供黎在 Twitter 上發表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;料控方下周二完成案情-黎智英一方將作中段陳詞&quot;&gt;料控方下周二完成案情 黎智英一方將作中段陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示即將完成控方案情，經控辯雙方商討，案件押後至下周二（6月11日）續審，以待處理翻譯文本事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英一方將有中段陳詞，要求法庭裁定3項控罪表證不成立；代表「蘋果日報有限公司」、「蘋果日報印刷有限公司」及「蘋果互聯網有限公司」的大律師王國豪則表示不會有中段陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;經控辯雙方商討，黎一方須於6月18日向法庭提交書面中段陳詞，控方則須於6月25日提交陳詞，之後黎一方須於7月2日提交回應控方的書面陳詞。至於聽取口頭陳詞的聆訊日子，法官杜麗冰提出7月9日，法官李運騰補充，因為他們還有其他工作在身。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，本案是首次由3名法官組成的合議庭聽取中段陳詞，關注傳媒能否報導中段陳詞內容。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行則指過往已出現過在3名法官席前作中段陳詞的案件。翻查報導，唐英傑案和初選案均有中段陳詞，並且控辯雙方陳詞獲傳媒報導。&lt;/p&gt;

The accords are the bedrock of the region’s security architecture, but owing to Israel’s war on Gaza and its moves at the border between Gaza and Egypt, the relationship between Cairo and Tel Aviv has reached its lowest point in decades. What kind of state are Egyptian-Israeli relations in, and how might this impact the future?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Jonathan Eyal (&lt;strong&gt;JE&lt;/strong&gt;) asked RUSI Senior Associate Fellow H A Hellyer (&lt;strong&gt;HH&lt;/strong&gt;) about the significance of these events.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE&lt;/strong&gt;: Camp David was a historic peace treaty between Cairo and Tel Aviv, and laid down the groundwork for a new regional security arrangement for the region in general, and Egypt and Israel in particular. Are we seeing that security arrangement unravel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HH&lt;/strong&gt;: The Camp David Accords had a number of annexes attached to them. One of these describes several different zones; Sinai is divided into three zones (A, B and C), and then there is “Zone D” which is along the border between Gaza and Egypt, on the Gazan side. Article 2/D of Annex 1 is very clear about what type of Israeli military forces are allowed to exist in that zone, which was later described as the “Philadelphi Corridor”. There’s no question that when the Israelis moved tanks into the Corridor on 7 May and took over the Rafah border crossing, they violated that article, and they’ve done much more since then. Last week, Tel Aviv declared that it had taken over the entire corridor, again violating the terms of the Camp David Accords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should be clear-eyed about this: Israel’s moves are seriously endangering the region’s security architecture, and many analysts – myself included – have warned over the past eight months that reckless escalatory behaviour will put all under the “law of unintended consequences”. If we’re frank, Israel’s moves over the past eight months have been incredibly reckless and have raised the likelihood of conflict breaking out across the region – between Israel and Iran, Israel and Lebanon, and now Israel and Egypt. It’s a testament to the region that we haven’t seen all-out war break out, despite these kinds of moves; it shows how little appetite there is for widespread conflict. But I think Tel Aviv is pushing the envelope hard, and it’s difficult to imagine there won’t be consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE&lt;/strong&gt;: Are you saying Egypt might pull out of Camp David?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HH&lt;/strong&gt;: No, I think Cairo continues to place great value on the treaty, and will be looking for other ways to express its rejection of Tel Aviv’s moves. As recently as 2 June, when Israel, the US and Egypt convened to discuss the issue, Cairo reiterated its demand that the Israelis withdraw from the Rafah border crossing. This is why, for example, Egypt announced it would join South Africa’s case at the International Court of Justice against Israel, and Cairo refused to coordinate with the Israelis on usage of the Rafah border crossing, clearly seeing such coordination as recognising the legitimacy of the Israel Defense Forces’ (IDF) presence there. Cairo may be pointing to the fact there are seven other border crossings, also completely under Israel’s control; several of them have been permanently closed by the Israelis, such as Karni and Sufa, but could be opened in order to provide aid relief to Palestinians in Gaza. Moreover, Israel’s official spokesperson, David Mencer, said to journalists that Israel had asked Egypt to open up so that Palestinians who wanted to flee to Sinai could do so, but that the request had been declined. There’s widespread concern in Cairo that Israel will take any opportunity to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza and displace them to Sinai, if it can do so; such admissions by Israel’s officials do not help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Israel’s moves over the past eight months have been incredibly reckless and have raised the likelihood of conflict breaking out across the region&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are other things to be concerned about, as Israel continues to engage in more reckless behaviour. A recent clash near the Rafah border crossing led to the death of an Egyptian soldier; Israeli media itself reported that the clash resulted from an Israeli provocation, designed to test Egypt’s reaction. Even without such moves, the risk assessment is serious; Israeli forces along the border in Rafah are seen by the Egyptians not only as violating the peace treaty, but also as part of an occupying power in occupied territory – which is also how London, the EU, the UN and most governments see Israel in Gaza. Egyptian soldiers on the border are no doubt impacted by that; they are seeing an occupying power in Gaza, right on their doorstep, where they know it’s not supposed to be, and they also know that nearby, that same army is engaged in massive hostilities against Palestinians in Rafah. Those soldiers see the same news reports that you and I see, and know that the UN and various agencies are reporting all manners of suffering as a result of the IDF operation. This time, the clash resulted in the death of one soldier; what happens next time, considering everything else that is going on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE&lt;/strong&gt;: OK, so things are rocky. But we have a normalisation of political relations between Egypt and Israel going back more than four decades. We also have a more recent set of normalisations between Israel and Arab states in terms of the Abraham Accords, and a new deal being proposed that would normalise relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. How does that impact Egypt, as it was the first to normalise, which gave it a certain leverage in terms of relations with Western powers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HH&lt;/strong&gt;: There are a few things to mention here; the first is that the Biden administration has invested tremendous energy in expanding the Abraham Accords. Indeed, many analysts characterised Biden’s Middle East policy as prioritising extending those accords, and very little else. Incredibly, despite the massively destructive conflict of the past eight months, the administration has still directed a lot of its limited bandwidth towards efforts to normalise Israel’s political relationship with Saudi Arabia. There’s a lot to unpack there, but I’m not convinced it will succeed, because Tel Aviv has already said it won’t accede to the fairly minimalist demands that Saudi Arabia has, which are all about fulfilling certain UN Security Council resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, there were also concerns expressed in 2020, when the Abraham Accords were signed, in terms of what they might do to Cairo’s geopolitical standing. The talk at the time was that they would decrease Cairo’s – and also Amman’s – importance in the region, because now there were other Arab states that had relations with Israel. But the truth is, whenever a crisis emerges involving Israel, the world still calls on Cairo and Amman, and moreso on Cairo. None of that has changed; they don’t call on Abu Dhabi, Manama or anywhere else in the same way. Cairo in particular has relationships not only with the Israelis, but with pretty much every major Palestinian faction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, my assessment of the Saudi-Israeli normalisation deal remains the same – I’m not sure we’ll be seeing that anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Whenever a crisis emerges involving Israel, the world still calls on Cairo and Amman, and moreso on Cairo. They don’t call on Abu Dhabi, Manama or anywhere else in the same way&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JE&lt;/strong&gt;: Perhaps, but the normalisation deal is all about the “day after”, and Biden’s plan put a lot of focus on trying to see beyond the current hostilities. What’s Egypt’s role in that regard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HH&lt;/strong&gt;: There are a lot of scenarios being discussed for Gaza following the end of hostilities. The problem is, most of them have been vetoed by the Israelis, so it becomes rather academic and abstract to even discuss them without addressing the elephant in the room, which is Israel’s occupation of Gaza, along with its military presence therein. Even the Israelis have found themselves in rather awkward situations due to this; Netanyahu announced in early May that the Emiratis could be involved in governing Gaza following the war, only to be met with a very public denunciation of the idea by the Emirati foreign minister. The stumbling block, including for Abu Dhabi – irrespective of the Abraham Accords – was the Israeli occupation, and the absence of a Palestinian government with “integrity, competence and independence”, which would then have the capacity to invite the UAE to assist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not only Arab states that reject “providing cover for the Israeli presence in the Gaza Strip”, as the Emiratis put it; I don’t think any country or multilateral organisation is interested in assisting in governing Gaza, without a clear commitment from the Israelis that they are leaving. Otherwise, such a presence would simply be interpreted as being Israel’s police force in the Gaza Strip – and thus quite likely targeted as part of the occupation. I’m not sure anyone would willingly take on that role; Cairo certainly won’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think if Biden is successful in getting a permanent ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal of troops, as well as a commitment to allow a track towards a Palestinian state that includes Gaza, then yes, Egypt could probably be convinced to deploy troops as part of a broader and temporary international force, similar to KFOR in Kosovo, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s a lot of “ifs”. The irony of all of this is that it is actually quite clear what a workable plan in Gaza entails, and it has been for decades. The question has always been: is the international community in general, and the US in particular, going to use its leverage to push such a workable plan forward? So far, the answer has been a firm “no” – and the Israelis know it.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the move did not necessarily signal an end to the substantial private trade and investment relationship between the two countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Argentina’s economic crisis deepened under President Fernandez, most of China’s high-profile infrastructure projects in Argentina became paralyzed over financing and other questions. Such projects included an $8 billion nuclear reactor at Argentina’s Atucha III complex, two dams on the Santa Cruz River, work on the Belgrano Cargas rail system, dredging of the Paraguay and Paraná Rivers to support the continued operation of the hidrovía (waterway), and problems in approving a Chinese port project near Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before the election of President Milei in November 2023, China had deepening difficulties in Argentina, including the cancellation of Argentina’s purchase of China’s JF17/FC-1 fighters in favor of U.S.-produced F-16 fighters. China also had replaced its dynamic Spanish-speaking ambassador and military attaché with a new ambassador, Wang Wei, who spoke mainly Italian, and a new attaché whose second language was Portuguese, not Spanish. Argentine China experts perceived that the PRC was informally downgrading the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Argentine foreign minister Diana Mondino’s cordial, professional approach toward the PRC and her assurances of Argentina’s continued interest in transparent commercial and diplomatic relations with China, relations continued to deteriorate. The PRC suspended a $6.5 billion bank credit that it had extended to the outgoing government, and its banks have reportedly put on hold credit for major investment projects in the country. In addition to the PRC’s reaction to President Milei’s remarks about China, the PRC was also reportedly offended by Taiwanese government representatives’ attendance at an academic event with Mondino involving Kung Guo Wei, a visiting professor from Taipei’s famous Tamkang University, before Mondino became foreign minister. Nevertheless, PRC-Argentina commercial relations are significant and, arguably, poised to deepen under President Milei’s government, driven by the likely turnaround of the Argentine economy and projects by private businesspersons and provincial and local-level politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trade&quot;&gt;Trade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina-China bilateral trade has grown substantially since the PRC entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, though, as with many countries of the region, Argentine purchases of Chinese products and services have grown far greater than PRC purchases from Argentina. Argentine exports to the PRC grew approximately eightfold, from $1.09 billion in 2002 to $7.93 billion in 2022, while Argentine imports from China grew over 53-fold, from $330 million in 2002 to $17.5 billion in 2022. Argentina’s main exports to the PRC were agricultural goods, led by soybeans, beef, and barley, while Argentina imported an array of higher value-added manufactured goods and services from China, including telephones and computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentine exports of agricultural goods, as well as lithium and other minerals, are poised to expand in the coming years as the Argentine economy recovers. Argentine consumption of Chinese electronics, cars, and other manufactured goods and services is also poised to grow, bolstered, ironically, by the relatively laissez-faire posture of President Milei toward commercial matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some reasons for optimism regarding overall trade growth, the realization of value added is likely to be lopsided in China’s favor, reflecting Argentina’s limited knowledge of the PRC as a market and the limited ability of the Argentine government to help its businesspeople consummate profitable deals there. In off-the-record interviews with an Argentine China expert, the author learned that although Argentina has diplomatic offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Canton, and Hong Kong, it has centers for commercial promotion only in Shanghai and Chengdu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite some reasons for optimism regarding overall trade growth, the realization of value added is likely to be lopsided in China’s favor, reflecting Argentina’s limited knowledge of the PRC as a market and the limited ability of the Argentine government to help its businesspeople.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;political-relations&quot;&gt;Political Relations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the Milei government, the PRC consistently put Argentina in the highest ranks of diplomatic partnerships it possesses. In 2004, the PRC recognized Argentina as one of three strategic partners in the region, and in 2014 it upgraded the relationship to a “comprehensive strategic partnership.” Consistent with this high level of relationship, the PRC tried to get Argentina to set up a ministerial-level committee to facilitate coordination across sectors, such as the COSBAN in Brazil and the High-Level Mixed Commission in Venezuela. But, according to an Argentine China expert, the Argentine Peronist government could not facilitate the required coordination between the Foreign and Commerce Ministries and other required government agencies, and the effort to create such a committee was ultimately set aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2022, the Fernandez government joined the PRC Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during a state visit to Beijing tied to the Winter Olympics held there. Fernandez was one of two Latin American presidents to attend the BRI’s 10th-anniversary celebration in October 2023. The PRC reportedly is concerned that the Fernandez government could withdraw Argentina from the BRI, however, just as it turned down membership in BRICS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Argentina also applied and was accepted to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, but the country reportedly never paid the $7.5 million membership quota and has not attended any board meetings or otherwise participated in the affairs of the bank. According to Argentine sinologists, the new Milei government appointed a respected career diplomat, Marcelo Suárez Salvia, to represent Argentina in the PRC, though he has not served in Asia and does not speak any Asian languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;petroleum&quot;&gt;Petroleum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) is the controlling partner in Bridas and, with British Petroleum, the Pan American Energy–Axion consortium. Together, the ventures give CNOOC substantial petroleum operations in Argentina. Bridas — in which the Bulgheronis, one of Argentina’s wealthiest families, also have an important stake — is the key operator of the Vaca Muerta shale gas deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mining-sector&quot;&gt;Mining Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mining sector, PRC-based companies have long had a presence in traditional operations, albeit with difficulties involving relations with local communities and government licensing. The most significant Chinese conventional mining project in the country is the Veladero gold mine, in which PRC-based Shandong Gold purchased a $960 million (50 percent) stake in 2017. Other Chinese-owned mines include Campana Mahuida, owned by China Metallurgical Corporation and shut down in 2009 due to problems with the local community; Sierra Grande, shut down in 2016 over low minerals prices; and a gold mine in La Rioja owned by Chinese conglomerate Hanaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the lithium sector, PRC-based companies have made major advances in recent years, courting Argentine provincial governments, which make key decisions about licensing and regulation. Chinese lithium projects in Argentina include Pozuelos and Pastos Grandes, acquired by China’s Ganfeng through its $962 million purchase of Lithea Inc. in 2022. Ganfeng also owns and is developing the Mariana salt flats in Salta and Cauchari-Olaroz in Jujuy, a joint venture with Canada’s Lithium Americas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese carmaker Chery and minor partner Gotion proposed a $400 million investment in an electric vehicle plant also in Jujuy, though with the country’s economic difficulties, plans have not yet moved forward. In nearby Catamarca Province, the Chinese mining giant Zijin operates the Tres Quebradas lithium field and has proposed the construction of a plant for refining lithium and manufacturing cathodes for lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agriculture&quot;&gt;Agriculture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agrologistics companies Nidera and Noble, owned by China Oilseeds and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO), have a substantial presence in Argentina, with a substantial part of their business coming from supplying agricultural goods to their parent organization COFCO. COFCO purchases for the Chinese market, giving it an advantage in competing with non-Chinese agrologistics firms such as ADM, Bunge, Dreyfuss, and Cargill. Nidera has a plant in Rosario, which suffered a high-profile explosion in 2017. It also has storage facilities in Santa Fe and Cordoba for grains, which may have some processing capabilities. There are also Chinese-owned agricultural facilities in Chaco and Tucuman, among other locations. The PRC-based company Syngenta, owned by ChemChina since 2017, has a presence in Argentina and has sought a new law for transgenic seeds to use its genetically modified organism technology in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, during the prior government, to meet growing Chinese demand for pork, PRC-based investors had proposed $3.7 billion in investments in slaughterhouses and other pork production facilities in the country. The project became the focus of protests by environmentalists and animal rights activists, who objected to the inhumane conditions the animals were allegedly raised in. To the consternation of the Chinese, President Fernandez became involved in the dispute on the side of the protesters, including allowing himself to be photographed at one of the protests near signs that were highly derogatory toward the Chinese. The position of Fernandez effectively stopped the project from going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;electricity-sector&quot;&gt;Electricity Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Jujuy Province, a consortium led by PowerChina is currently working on the fourth phase of the Cauchari photovoltaic array, the largest solar park in Argentina and the region. The plan, according to Argentine China experts, is to leverage the project not only to power mining and other operations in the region but also to support an ecosystem of green energy facilities. PowerChina and other PRC-based firms have also been involved in the Loma Blanca wind farm and other wind projects in Neuquén and Santa Cruz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in Santa Cruz, PowerChina leads a consortium for the construction of two hydroelectric facilities on the Santa Cruz River — the Jorge Cepernic and Nestor Kirchner facilities — though progress on the project has been delayed over regulatory and environmental, as well as financing, issues. As noted, the construction of a nuclear pressurized water reactor by the Chinese Gezhouba Group in the Atucha complex, initially agreed to during the presidency of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, also continues to be stuck over the insistence by the fiscally imperiled prior Argentine government that the Chinese finance 100 percent of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PowerChina was also involved in the long-delayed Chihuido hydroelectric project, which Russia originally pursued, though neither had success in taking the project forward. PowerChina further attempted, unsuccessfully, to sell steel tubing for the construction of a gas pipeline connecting the Vaca Muerta shale gas field to Buenos Aires, but the Alberto Fernandez government chose to award the contract to the favored but much more expensive Argentine supplier Techint. According to an Argentine China expert interviewed for this project, because of the poor outcome of several PowerChina projects, CEO Tu Shuiping reportedly resigned and left for the PRC, with many of the company’s projects in Argentina remaining stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transportation-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Transportation Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past 15 years, PRC-based companies have pursued multiple train and highway infrastructure projects in Argentina, albeit with considerable delays and difficulties. The most significant of these projects are track modernization and the provision of new engines and rolling stock for the Belgrano Cargas railroad, key to moving freight within Argentina and connecting it to the ports of neighboring countries. Although work on various segments of Belgrano Cargas have been completed, work became stuck at the end of the Fernandez administration over a series of disputes, including the Chinese insisting they import their own railroad ties instead of using locally available quebracho, an Argentine hardwood. The Chinese also completed work on the Red Line (Line B) of the Buenos Aires metro (Subte), though the extension to the Buenos Aires (Ezeiza) International Airport and work on the Cordoba metro never went forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina and China explored work on tunnels through mountain passes connecting Argentina and Chile via highway, including the Agua Negra tunnel at the latitude of Buenos Aires and Santiago and a route further to the north through the Argentine province of Salta. Perhaps the most controversial Chinese infrastructure project has been the proposed construction of the $500 million multiuse Rio Grande commercial port at the tip of Antarctica in Tierra del Fuego. The area has been of interest to Chinese investors since the early 2000s when a PRC-based group explored building a petrochemical plant and maritime export terminal for urea fertilizer in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential ability of the Chinese military to surreptitiously use the port during times of war to observe and possibly inhibit transits through the Straits of Magellan or the Drake Passage has drawn attention to the project as a security concern, even obligating the governor of Ushuaia to contract a media consultant to help deal with the controversy. As of the time of this writing, the project was seen as unlikely to receive the federal approval required by the port and navigable rivers organization within the Ministry of Economy to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Digital Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2001, PRC-based companies such as Huawei and ZTE — and today Xiaomi — have played a leading role in Argentina’s telecommunications infrastructure. By 2021, Huawei had over 500 employees in the country. Such Chinese firms are important suppliers to Argentina’s telecommunications providers, including Claro, Movistar, and Personal (which is part of Grupo Clarín). The latter relies heavily on Huawei equipment. Huawei is also a significant cloud services provider in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since 2001, PRC-based companies such as Huawei and ZTE — and today Xiaomi — have played a leading role in Argentina’s telecommunications infrastructure.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outgoing Fernandez government had planned an accelerated auction of the country’s 5G bandwidth in September 2023 to raise needed funds for the government (an estimated $1 billion in royalty payments, according to Argentine China experts interviewed for this project). Companies using Huawei 5G equipment were poised to win, but the government could not conduct the bid in time, and its status with the new government remains uncertain. In Argentina, as in other countries, Huawei has a scholarship program, Seeds of the Future, to strengthen its base of tech employees in the region by bringing technically talented youth to the PRC for three months to a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the surveillance systems domain, ZTE is the key supplier for a $30 million smart cities project in Jujuy, where the PRC depends on local government support to access the province’s lithium. In addition, the Chinese firm Hikvision is a key provider of surveillance cameras in the country, including for corporate and home security systems, as well as for traffic cameras in towns and neighborhoods like Vicente Lopez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in other parts of Latin America, customs scanners in Ezeiza International Airport, first purchased in 2016, are supplied by the PRC-based company Nuctec. With respect to taxi services, as in other parts of Latin America such as Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil, the Chinese taxi company DiDi is present in the country, with a particular focus on mototaxi and delivery services. However, competitors Uber and Cabify are more dominant in local markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;banking-and-finance&quot;&gt;Banking and Finance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three Chinese banks currently operate in Argentina. Hong Kong Shanghai Bank of China and International Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) are licensed to conduct branch banking operations in the country. ICBC entered the country following a 2012 approval by Argentine authorities of its controlling interest in the locally licensed Standard Bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), with offices in the Buenos Aires district of Puerto Madero, primarily conducts representational banking for Chinese companies tied to the currency swap and business in the PRC. According to an Argentine China expert interviewed for this project, the Agricultural Bank of China also has explored establishing a presence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the PBOC, Argentina and China have an $18.5 billion currency swap arrangement. It was set up to facilitate the clearance of transactions for imports and exports between the two countries in order to avoid using U.S. dollars as the clearing mechanism. They also agreed to expand the agreement by $5 billion. The interest rate secured for the new portion of the swap, according to an Argentine China expert, was the 3.5 percent benchmark Hong Kong interest rate plus an additional 3.5 percent. The rate is considered high but still in the range of commercial norms. Under the Fernandez government, $5 billion of the swap was activated to support trade between the two countries. In addition, Argentina may have used its access to the renminbi to pay part of its installment payments to the International Monetary Fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When President Milei took office, the Chinese reportedly asked the incoming government if it wished to activate part of the currency swap line to facilitate trade, but the Milei government reportedly declined, Argentine China experts say. Shortly after, the PRC also canceled the new $6.5 billion portion of its swap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pharmaceutical-sector&quot;&gt;Pharmaceutical Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the early phases of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese company Sinopharm conducted Phase 3 trials in Argentina, among other countries, and partnered with a local laboratory, Richmond Laboratories, for assembling and distributing its vaccine in Argentina. Because of the poor performance of the Chinese vaccine, however, the demand for the Sinopharm vaccine dried up once higher-efficacy Western messenger RNA vaccines came online. According to Argentine China experts, Sinopharm could not reach an agreement to produce its vaccine in Argentina or branch into other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, an Argentine laboratory, Bagó, had a production facility in the PRC for the production of aftosa vaccines for animals. In off-the-record interviews with Argentine China experts interviewed for this project, they expressed that although there was interest in leveraging the partnership to bring Chinese pharmaceutical capabilities to Argentina, as with Sinopharm, nothing came of the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;media-influence&quot;&gt;Media Influence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in other parts of the region, the PRC has courted the Argentine media, including purchasing advertising supplements in important papers such as Clarín and La Nación. Grupo Clarín also has important business interests with the PRC, including its telecommunications firm Personal, which is the principal user of Chinese equipment in the country and the pioneer for Huawei’s entry into the Argentine market for 5G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intellectual-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Intellectual Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina, like most Latin American countries, has relatively limited China knowledge within its universities and think tanks. Nevertheless, its knowledge base and human connections have grown in recent years and are better than in many other parts of Latin America. Argentina’s most respected China studies centers include those at the Catholic University of Argentina (UCA), Universidad Nacional de la Plata (one of the country’s oldest China and Asia studies programs, with the China Center currently under Maria Francesca Staiano), Universidad Nacional de Tres de Febrero, and Universidad Nacional de Lanús, at which Argentina’s passionately Sinophile ambassador to the PRC, Sabino Vaca Narvaja, formerly taught. As in the United States, leading Argentine think tanks, such as the Argentine Council for International Relations, have China studies programs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argentina currently has three Confucius Institutes in public universities, in keeping with Chinese tradition. The oldest, at Universidad Nacional de la Plata, was established in the 1980s, followed by Universidad de Buenos Aires and, most recently, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, set up in 2020. Universidad Católica de Salta has also explored setting up a Confucius Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to China-focused Argentines interviewed for this work, the number of PRC-paid trips for Argentines to study or attend forums in China has reportedly decreased from the golden age of the 2010s, with restrictions on interactions and travel for Argentines increased. Beyond PRC-sponsored education institutions and scholarships, the Sino-Argentine Chamber of Commerce is an important referent for Argentine businesses doing business in the PRC or with Chinese companies. The president of the chamber is Sergio Spadone, son of one of Argentina’s pioneers of doing business with China, and the executive director is Alejandra Conconi. In addition, former head of the chamber Ernesto Taboada now operates a small, separate organization, the Argentine-China Council, after a falling out with the chamber, which he formerly headed, according to an Argentine China expert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;provincial-and-local-engagement&quot;&gt;Provincial and Local Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As elsewhere in the region, the PRC is particularly engaged at the provincial and local levels in Argentina, including in investment projects, the gifting of trips for local officials to the PRC, and in arrangements with local universities. These engagements include a technology and resources agreement with the National University of Jujuy, an agreement with Alibaba, agreements with PowerChina, and a $30 million contract for ZTE to install cameras and a provincial response and control system in the province, among other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond PRC initiatives within the Argentine provinces and with their leaders, Chinese provinces have pursued national-level representation in Argentina. According to an Argentine China expert, Hunan, Canton, and Szechuan Provinces all have representative offices in Buenos Aires but not in the Argentine provinces with which they have sister-province relations. As in Brazil under President Jair Bolsonaro, PRC engagement with Argentine local and provincial-level governments is likely to expand as a complement to a less amenable atmosphere for pursuing agreements at the national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prc-space-sector-presence-in-argentina&quot;&gt;PRC Space Sector Presence in Argentina&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been widely publicized, in 2012, the PRC signed a $300 million agreement with the Fernandez de Kirchner government, serving as the basis for the construction and operation of a deep space radar facility in a remote part of Neuquén. The facility is operated by China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control, part of the Chinese Strategic Support Force of the People’s Liberation Army. The Argentine government has only an intermittent presence at the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, since the signing of a 1989 cooperation agreement, the Chinese have operated space telescopes at the Felix Aguilar Astronomical Observatory in San Juan, constructing a satellite laser ranging station at the site in 2006. The PRC is currently constructing a 40-meter space telescope, the China Argentina Radio Telescope, at the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rio Gallegos, in the south of the country, the Chinese firm Emposat has plans to build a space tracking facility with four to six antennae. The site, if approved, would complement the Chinese polar space capabilities provided by its Antarctic research facilities at Zhongshan and Inexpressible Island, Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC has explored sales and gifts of arms and other equipment to Argentina’s police and military, though those appeared to have been decreasing at the end of the prior government and have not gone forward under the Milei administration. During the Fernandez de Kirchner administration, Argentina began exploring the purchase of Chinese 8x8 armored personnel carriers for the Cruz del Sur multinational peacekeeping brigade, which it formed with Chile, as well as P-18 offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) similar to those the PRC sold to Trinidad and Tobago and FC-1 interceptor aircraft. After purchasing four WMZ-551s for evaluation for $2.6 million, Argentina decided against the purchase of more of the vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the center-right administration of Mauricio Macri (2015–19), Argentina decided to buy French patrol boats, obviating the need for Chinese OPVs. Purchase of the Chinese FC-1 received serious consideration under the leftist Peronist government of Alberto Fernandez, including due to significant efforts by the Chinese, who saw an opportunity to introduce the fighter into the region more broadly through Argentina and who went so far as to cut the offer price by 40 percent in an attempt to win the contract, according to off-the-record interviews with Argentine security experts. The Chinese were reportedly even exploring assembly of the aircraft in Argentina in a facility of the national defense industry manufacturer FADEA for export to other parts of the region. The Chinese may have also had an additional source of leverage through Francisco Taiana, son of then minister of defense Jorge Taiana, who had received considerable access to China to write a book on the country, among other activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, however, there were serious questions about quality and maintainability, particularly because the Chinese did not use the fighter themselves. According to Argentine security experts, the Argentine evaluation team could not speak with the Pakistani pilots who had flown the FC-1s. Because the planes used a Russian-made engine, the availability of parts became uncertain in the context of Russia’s war against Ukraine and associated Western sanctions. In the final months of the Fernandez government, Argentina chose to buy U.S. F-16s from Denmark rather than the Chinese fighter. Beyond these weapons purchases, Argentina also received a donation of four armored vehicles and security cameras from the PRC in conjunction with the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, though there were no further gifts after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In professional military interactions, the Argentine National War College (NWC) has regularly sent an officer to a six-month command and general staff course in the PRC, as well as sending officials to shorter courses. According to an Argentine security expert, the Argentine NWC, as recently as 2020, also hosted a student from the People’s Liberation Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese National Police also maintains a presence in the PRC embassy in Argentina to support Argentine authorities in combatting Chinese-organized crime in the country. During the prior Fernandez de Kirchner government, the PRC brought in a larger presence to help the Argentine government combat the Chinese triad Pi Xue, which had grown significantly in the greater Buenos Aires area and was extorting Chinese shopkeepers. Argentine security experts note that while the reported level of extortion and other activity by Pi Xue is now much lower, the Chinese national presence in the PRC embassy in Buenos Aires continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in other parts of the region, the Chinese government appears to operate unofficial Chinese police stations in the country, ostensibly to assist but also to pressure Chinese nationals living in Argentina, leveraging relatives living in China. According to Argentine security experts, local authorities have identified at least two such facilities in the neighborhoods of San Martin and Tres de Febrero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the domain of private security, China Overseas Security Group (COSG) has an office in Buenos Aires whose address, according to reports by security experts interviewed for this project, is that of the local law firm that registered it, Wilson Rae. COSG continues to advertise on its website a search for a country manager position dating to the 2019 G20 meeting in the city, though it does not have a visible presence in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As in other parts of the region, the Chinese government appears to operate unofficial Chinese police stations in the country, ostensibly to assist but also to pressure Chinese nationals living in Argentina, leveraging relatives living in China.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Argentine-China commercial relationship is broad and substantial and will likely continue under the Milei administration, particularly in high-priority sectors such as lithium, renewable energy, and digital sectors. PRC purchases of Argentine agricultural products and other commodities and Chinese sales of a broad range of goods and services to the Argentine economy will probably continue at a significant level, though lack of political will on the Argentine side and lack of financing on the Chinese side may restrict agreements of a more political or military nature and large infrastructure projects whose business case is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in Brazil under the China-skeptical Bolsonaro regime, PRC engagements at the provincial level in Argentina may flourish compared to those at the national level, where political skepticism toward the PRC is greater. The success of the Milei government in turning around the Argentine economy will also impact its ability to engage commercially with the PRC and take new projects forward. Whatever the trajectory, the underlying economic logic between the two countries means the future of the Argentina-PRC relationship is likely to be better than some in the PRC fear and will present an opportunity for Washington to work with the Milei administration to define what a transparent, balanced relationship should look like between Argentina and a range of countries, including China, other Asian partners, the European Union, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has significantly increased pressure on Taiwan in recent years, stoking fears that tensions could erupt into outright conflict. Much attention has been paid to the threat of an invasion, but Beijing has options besides invading to coerce, punish, or annex Taiwan. One major step China could take is a “gray zone” quarantine led not by its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) but by its coast guard and other law enforcement forces. Rather than sealing off the island, a quarantine would aim to demonstrate China’s ability to exert control over Taiwan. A quarantine is more feasible for China and more likely than an invasion or blockade in the near term; it also presents unique challenges in terms of how Taiwan and the international community can respond. This brief explores two hypothetical maritime quarantine scenarios that are informed by in-depth research, tabletop exercises, private consultations, and expert surveys conducted by the CSIS China Power Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has significantly increased pressure on Taiwan in recent years. China’s military frequently flies aircraft within the island’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and across the Taiwan Strait median line. In August 2022 and April 2023, China escalated in response to U.S.-Taiwan political engagements by staging unprecedented large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. China has also deployed its navy and coast guard in increasing numbers around Taiwan and its outlying islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-Strait tensions further intensified in the wake of William Lai’s inauguration as Taiwan’s president on May 20, 2024. Three days after Lai delivered his inauguration address, China commenced two days of large-scale military exercises surrounding Taiwan, called “Joint Sword-2024A,” and accompanied them with “comprehensive law enforcement operations” (综合执法演练) involving China’s coast guard. Chinese officials stated that the drills were intended to “serve as a strong punishment for the separatist acts of ‘Taiwan independence’ forces and a stern warning against the interference and provocation by external forces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Chinese escalations against Taiwan are raising concerns that Beijing could take even more significant steps to “punish” and coerce Taiwan going forward. One major action China could take against Taiwan is a gray zone quarantine of the island. Quarantine scenarios have received far less attention than other contingencies, such as an invasion, but a quarantine is likelier in the near term and therefore warrants increased scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-quarantine&quot;&gt;What Is a Quarantine?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term quarantine is sometimes used interchangeably with “blockade.” However, this report differentiates between the two, defining a quarantine as a law enforcement–led operation to control maritime or air traffic within a specific area while a blockade is foremost military in nature. A quarantine would entail China’s coast guard and other forces conducting gray zone operations intended to stay below the threshold of an armed conflict. Thus, the military would play a supporting role — not a leading role — in such operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political and operational goals of a quarantine are not to completely seal Taiwan off from the world but to impose a system of controls over the island’s maritime and/or air commerce. In a quarantine, key necessities like food and medicine could continue to flow into Taiwan, enabling China to assert that its law enforcement operation is imposing no hardship. A quarantine could target the delivery of specific goods, such as shipments of U.S. weapons to Taiwan, but such a move would risk provoking a more direct U.S. response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key goal of the quarantine approach is to obtain compliance from international companies and other countries to demonstrate China’s power over Taiwan. This is similar, in some respects, to China’s 2013 declaration of an ADIZ over much of the East China Sea. Many airlines, including U.S. companies, complied with Beijing’s demands then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarantine of Taiwan could involve a change of Chinese domestic policy to establish new rules or requirements for regulating trade or traffic into Taiwan, or it could simply involve Chinese law enforcement forces stepping up activities against Taiwan on the basis of existing laws. Thus, a quarantine would focus on forcing compliance with Chinese rules and strengthening China’s asserted sovereignty claims over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to law enforcement–led quarantines, this brief defines a blockade as a military-led operation. China’s PLA would be leading a blockade by encircling parts or all of Taiwan, while forces such as the coast guard and maritime militia play a supporting role. More intense versions of a blockade could involve missile strikes against Taiwan as well as mining of waters around Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blockade would, by nature, involve much more escalatory operations than a quarantine. A quarantine would not intentionally involve the use of kinetic force to attack targets, though it is possible that escalation could lead to an exchange of kinetic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no publicly available doctrinal writings on how exactly China could execute a quarantine. However, China has conducted several maneuvers and exercises that are indicative of how it can use law enforcement operations to assert control over traffic to Taiwan and complicate Taiwan’s maritime environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2022, when then speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, China’s Maritime Safety Administration (MSA) deployed a large patrol vessel, the Haixun 06, to conduct operations off the coast of China’s Fujian Province and in the Taiwan Strait for the first time. In April 2023, after Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen transited through the United States, the Haixun 06 deployed again. This time, it sailed farther into the Taiwan Strait, and the Fujian Province MSA announced that the vessel would carry out “on-site inspections” of vessels, though there were no reports that inspections occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, China increased coast guard patrols near Taiwan’s outlying Kinmen Islands after an incident there. In February 2024, a Taiwan coast guard vessel chased and collided with a Chinese vessel that Taiwan asserts was illegally fishing near Kinmen. The incident resulted in the death of two crew members. China responded by increasing coast guard patrols near what Taiwan calls “restricted” and “prohibited” waters around Kinmen. At one point, Chinese coast guard personnel boarded a Taiwan-owned tourist boat to check its licenses and paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid this uptick in activity around Kinmen, China conducted a series of combat activities in which naval and air forces from the PLA Eastern Theater Command conducted drills jointly with the China Coast Guard (CCG). Chinese official outlets described the exercises as simulating “emergency scenarios” and focusing on enhancing forces’ “interoperability and joint strike capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China again stepped up the involvement of the CCG in May 2024 during its latest round of large-scale exercises around Taiwan. Alongside the PLA exercises, the CCG conducted its own operations around two of Taiwan’s outlying islands. On the same day that the PLA exercises started, the Fujian Province Coast Guard launched a “comprehensive law enforcement exercise” in waters around Wuqiu and Dongyin “to test its joint patrol, rapid reaction and emergency response capabilities.” The CCG indicated that its patrol vessels came as close as 2.8 nautical miles from Wuqiu’s islands and as close as 3.1 nautical miles from Dongyin, marking the first time CCG vessels have entered waters there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IW7hrxm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to patrolling around Taiwan’s outlying islands, four CCG vessels sailed east of Taiwan and another three sailed southwest of Taiwan near the southern entrance of the Taiwan Strait. As part of the exercises east of Taiwan, videos released by official Chinese outlets showed multiple CCG ships encircling a target vessel and spraying water cannons, though the vessel appeared to be Chinese-flagged, and the video did not show the water cannons actually hitting the vessel. This represents a marked increase in intensity compared to previous CCG activities around Taiwan, and it is the latest and clearest indication that China is preparing its law enforcement and military forces to operate together in the context of a Taiwan Strait crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-china-might-quarantine-taiwan&quot;&gt;Why China Might Quarantine Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarantine of Taiwan would represent a substantial escalation of coercion against the island, but it offers China several distinct advantages. First, a quarantine allows China to impose greater political and administrative control over Taiwan. China’s efforts to restrict air or maritime traffic to the island could allow Beijing to assert its sovereignty claims and demonstrate that Taiwan does not have control over its own claimed sovereign space. This could undermine Taipei’s ability to self-govern and erode the Taiwan public’s confidence in Taiwan’s military and coast guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China could use a quarantine to intervene in Taiwan’s domestic politics by imposing economic costs on the island. If the disruptions stemming from a quarantine are sustained for a lengthy period, elements within Taiwan’s society could leverage this to portray Taiwan’s leaders as ineffective. This could either lead to a loss of public support for Taipei or increase political pressure on Taiwan’s leaders to negotiate or improve relations with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, a quarantine is more limited in scope than a blockade or other large military operations. A quarantine led by China’s coast guard is not a declaration of war against Taiwan. Because a quarantine is not overtly PLA-led, there is a lower risk that escalation will lead to direct military confrontation. If the quarantine is cast as a law enforcement operation, China can easily announce the end of the operation and claim its objectives were met. Relatedly, China could choose to target only certain types of products, or the quarantine could be scaled to cover all air and maritime flows to Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China successfully conducts a limited quarantine, it would set a political precedent and establish a new normal of Chinese activity, setting the stage for it to carry out more expansive operations in the future. The unprecedented scale and complexity of a quarantine operation would also provide a valuable opportunity for Chinese law enforcement, maritime militia, and the PLA to train and test their capabilities and identify weaknesses for subsequent operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, a quarantine could have impact without full and sustained implementation. Although China has significant capabilities to use law enforcement and other assets to physically disrupt trade to Taiwan, it may only need to demonstrate intent and some capability for the quarantine to be effective. The announcement of a change in Chinese policy — or the beginning of law enforcement actions — is likely to have a chilling effect on the willingness of businesses to invest or operate in Taiwan. Similarly, demonstrated Chinese willingness to search and seize only a handful of commercial ships could have an outsized deterrent impact and discourage similar transgressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many commercial airlines and shipping companies are likely to comply with Chinese pronouncements. Even if some shipping companies do not comply with quarantine regulations, adherence by most of them would significantly strengthen China’s narrative that it has control over Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China’s use of the coast guard and civilian law enforcement complicates the ability of the United States and regional actors to respond. A quarantine does not require closing off or restricting international traffic through the Taiwan Strait — an action that other countries could use as a justification to intervene to assist Taiwan and defend international legal rights to freedom of navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also does not have sufficient coast guard forces forward deployed to the Indo-Pacific to respond in kind. The United States could lean on other forward-deployed forces, including air and maritime assets, to help Taiwan respond, but it is likely to be cautious to avoid the optics of using “gray-hulled” U.S. Navy vessels to confront “white-hulled” CCG vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent survey of experts from the United States and Taiwan, the China Power Project found that most are skeptical of U.S. and allied willingness to intervene in a quarantine. Only 13 percent of surveyed U.S. experts and 9 percent of Taiwan experts were “completely confident” that the United States would intervene militarily to defend Taiwan from a quarantine. An even smaller percentage had confidence that allies and partners would support a U.S.-led multinational military intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-ability-to-quarantine-taiwan&quot;&gt;China’s Ability to Quarantine Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarantine would be an immense and unprecedented undertaking for China, requiring it to overcome complex logistics hurdles and jointly command law enforcement, maritime militia, and military forces. Nevertheless, China has immense capabilities at its disposal that would enable it to conduct a quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 150 oceangoing vessels and more than 400 smaller vessels at its disposal, the CCG is the largest coast guard in the world. The CCG is a quasi-military organization that reports to China’s highest military authority, the Central Military Commission. Many CCG ships were transferred from the navy and still carry some military-grade weapons, such as 76 mm cannons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s coast guard would be at a major quantitative and qualitative disadvantage. It has just 10 oceangoing ships and approximately 160 smaller vessels. These vessels are responsible for protecting the over 300 harbors and ports on Taiwan’s coast and for law enforcement activity within 24 nautical miles of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cRv69To.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s MSA, which is the primary non–coast guard civilian agency responsible for maritime security and navigation, would work alongside the CCG to lead a quarantine. The MSA’s fleet consists of at least three dozen oceangoing vessels and hundreds of smaller patrol craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the CCG, China also possesses a large maritime militia: a force of organized, trained, and armed personnel aboard fishing vessels and other craft. These vessels operate under the official guise of commercial fishing activity, but in actuality, they work in tandem with China’s law enforcement and under the shadow of the PLA to support Chinese maritime operations. Because the maritime militia is not officially a law enforcement or military entity, it is challenging for other countries to respond to its activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little information about the full size of the maritime militia, but some estimate that it consists of more than 100 large vessels and as many as 3,000 smaller vessels. The lion’s share of the maritime militia is concentrated in the South China Sea, where militia vessels often swarm by the dozens or hundreds to defend China’s territorial claims in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how many Chinese maritime militia operate near the Taiwan Strait, but those that would be involved in a Taiwan contingency may be based at ports in China’s Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shandong Provinces. Meanwhile, Taiwan does not have an equivalently large force similar to China’s maritime militia. This means Taiwan would largely need to lean on its coast guard to respond to militia activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China’s military forces also significantly overshadow Taiwan’s. As of 2023, the PLA Navy comprises a battle force of over 370 vessels, many of which are based in areas close to the Taiwan Strait. The PLA Air Force and Navy also boast thousands of aircraft, which support China’s ability to project power and conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) around Taiwan. If the situation around Taiwan goes kinetic, Taiwan would face a much larger force than its own, limiting its ability to effectively respond to aggressive Chinese activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hlP4Pdz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-role-of-geography&quot;&gt;The Role of Geography&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geography is a major factor at play in a quarantine scenario. At its narrowest point, the Taiwan Strait is only about 130 km (81 miles) wide, meaning China does not have to deploy forces at long distances from China’s own shores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to Taiwan’s exposure is the fact that the island has only a handful of major international ports. Most of the busiest ports — including Kaohsiung, Taichung, Taipei, Keelung, and Mailiao — are also the closest to mainland China. There are two less-busy ports — Hualien and Su’ao — on Taiwan’s east coast, as well as additional smaller harbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Port of Kaohsiung stands out among these. In 2022, an estimated 57 percent of Taiwan’s maritime trade entered through the Port of Kaohsiung, making it an indispensable commercial hub for the island. It is by far Taiwan’s busiest port for containerized goods and oil, and the nearby Yung-An Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Terminal is Taiwan’s largest facility for importing LNG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Lj5oHvG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this means it is easier for Chinese forces to reach Taiwan’s most important shipping ports. In fact, if China can effectively control traffic into just one port, Kaohsiung, it can achieve significant influence over what gets into Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-china-could-implement-a-quarantine&quot;&gt;How China Could Implement a Quarantine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scenarios outlined below are only two examples of potential maritime quarantines. There are many other conceivable approaches China could take, but these scenarios align with activities and capabilities China has demonstrated through past operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-1-limited-maritime-quarantine&quot;&gt;Scenario 1: Limited Maritime Quarantine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first scenario, Beijing leverages its law enforcement forces to conduct a limited maritime quarantine of some of Taiwan’s ports. This is not aimed at choking off Taiwan’s access to trade, but a gray zone operation to achieve more limited — but still significant — objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dn93XhE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Days or weeks before the start of quarantine operations, China readies maritime law enforcement forces within its coast guard and MSA. Beijing also mobilizes portions of its military and calls up maritime militia fishing vessels in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China begins by publicly announcing “enhanced customs inspection rules.” It avoids using terms like “quarantine” or “blockade” to describe its actions. In order to enter Taiwan, all cargo and tanker vessels must file advance customs declarations with relevant Chinese authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese law enforcement vessels will be authorized to board vessels, conduct on-site inspections, question personnel, and undertake other measures against noncompliant ships. Chinese authorities also threaten fines and market access restrictions for companies flouting the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quarantine is set to enter into force 48 hours after announcement. This allows China time to deploy forces into position after they have been mobilized. It also allows shipping companies with vessels in transit warning time to comply, lending some credibility to China’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities do not announce a specific location for the inspections, but they intend to target the Port of Kaohsiung, Taiwan’s busiest port. China positions more than 10 law enforcement patrol vessels off the coast of Kaohsiung. China also deploys a smaller contingent of law enforcement vessels within the Taiwan Strait off the coast of other major ports at Taichung and Taipei. About 48 hours after the initial announcement, Chinese authorities issue notices that enforcement is beginning and that its patrol ships will stop noncompliant vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vessels intrude into Taiwan’s 24-nautical-mile contiguous zone and occasionally approach the 12-nautical-mile territorial seas boundary. This is symbolically important since China does not recognize Taiwan’s claims to these boundaries. During large-scale military exercises around Taiwan in April 2023, several PLA vessels intruded into Taiwan’s contiguous zone in a maneuver intended to delegitimize Taiwan’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting these law enforcement vessels are approximately 20 maritime militia fishing vessels extending along Taiwan’s contiguous zone. These maritime militia vessels are not authorized to conduct boarding or search operations against commercial vessels. Instead, they fill in gaps in ISR and complicate Taiwan’s maritime domain awareness by swarming in certain areas. China could deploy significantly more militia forces — as it has done in the South China Sea — but the militia forces are not as well trained as the coast guard, and Beijing may worry about their discipline and ability to face off against Taiwan’s coast guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this quarantine is ostensibly a law enforcement operation, the military plays a key supporting role. China’s navy deploys five surface action groups (SAGs) to encircle Taiwan from a distance. Each SAG comprises three to six ships — including destroyers, frigates, support vessels, and covertly deployed attack submarines — for a total of nearly 30 warships. They are primarily meant to deter intervention by foreign coast guard or military forces and to respond if Taiwan’s navy escalates or attempts to escort vessels into the island. They also provide ISR, extending China’s air and maritime domain awareness farther into the Pacific, helping Beijing monitor U.S., Japanese, or other movements. In addition to naval operations, the PLA constantly flies sorties of manned and unmanned aircraft around Taiwan to monitor traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1l4Jaic.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing does not need universal compliance with the customs rules in order to claim success. Compliance by around 75 percent of shipping companies would be a considerable success for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese-flagged shipping vessels — which account for a significant share of the total traffic — universally comply with Chinese authorities, and Beijing permits them to enter Taiwan’s ports. Beijing counts on most foreign shipping companies complying with the “enhanced customs rules” to avoid reprisals, but several companies headquartered in Taiwan, the United States, and certain other countries publicly oppose and disregard the rules. Over the course of one week, Chinese law enforcement vessels only stop and search one or two vessels in total and focus solely on Taiwan-owned vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China meets relatively limited pushback and most companies comply with Chinese customs rules, China begins to draw down operations after about one week. However, a considerable law enforcement and military presence persists around Taiwan in the weeks that follow — an indication of the new normal China has established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scenario-2-full-maritime-quarantine&quot;&gt;Scenario 2: Full Maritime Quarantine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is a significantly scaled-up version of the first scenario. Like the first scenario, China declares new “enhanced customs inspection rules” that will require advance notice with Chinese authorities to ship goods into Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e7JbzZM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, however, China publicly announces a quarantine area covering the entire island of Taiwan. The zone extends 24 nautical miles from Taiwan’s territorial baseline, matching with Taiwan’s claimed contiguous zone. This is intended to delegitimize the contiguous zone and demonstrate China’s willingness and capability to impose its will in an area ostensibly under Taipei’s jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities announce that the inspection regime will go into effect 48 hours after declaration. China will require the shipper of any cargo destined for Taiwan to file advance notice with Chinese customs and law enforcement officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China again deploys law enforcement vessels to lead the quarantine, but this time it sends a much larger overall contingent. The greatest concentration, consisting of more than 10 coast guard and maritime safety vessels, is positioned off the coast of Kaohsiung. It also deploys a dozen vessels off the west coast ports of Taipei and Taichung and sends nine near the northern Port of Keelung — Taiwan’s second-busiest import hub. Finally, it sends another six to the smaller eastern ports of Hualien and Su’ao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This deployment of more than three dozen law enforcement vessels amounts to an unprecedentedly large maritime operation for China. It would constitute approximately one-fourth of China’s oceangoing CCG and MSA fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly 40 maritime militia vessels also swarm Taiwan’s coastal waters, along the contiguous zone, to fill in gaps between law enforcement vessels. As in the limited quarantine scenario, the maritime militia vessels do not participate in conducting boarding and inspecting activities. They focus primarily on conducting ISR for China and complicating Taiwan’s maritime domain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in the limited quarantine scenario, China’s navy deploys five SAGs to extend China’s ISR, intimidate Taiwan, and deter U.S. and other forces that may try to intervene. PLA aircraft also fly regular sorties to conduct ISR around Taiwan. This time, China supplements its naval deployment by positioning the Shandong aircraft carrier and its strike group southeast of Taiwan. It launches frequent sorties of J-15 fighters east of Taiwan, repeating operations that the PLA exercised in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qbrTy2f.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, China is much more active in terms of boarding and searching vessels. Chinese forces stop at least one or two vessels per day for the period of the quarantine, focusing mostly on Taiwan-flagged ships. There also appear to be inspections of vessels belonging to some of the dozen countries that still maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese forces seize several noncompliant ships and impound them at nearby ports within China. Commercial vessels that have filed the appropriate paperwork and had their requests approved are allowed into Taiwan. However, due to heightened uncertainty about the nature of China’s enforcement, many shipping companies choose to delay their shipments, causing a significant and noticeable decline of merchandise trade into Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the operation stretches into multiple days, Chinese ships and personnel need to be rotated. After the large initial deployment, China can fluctuate the number of forces depending on factors like capacity, the level of compliance with the quarantine, Beijing’s desired intensity, and U.S. military posturing, if any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These operations continue at varying levels for over two weeks before beginning to wind down. However, a significant CCG and PLA presence continues to operate indefinitely around Taiwan at a greater level than before the quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both these maritime scenarios, Beijing’s goal is not to hermetically seal off Taiwan. Instead, these campaigns are designed to punish Taiwan, assert Beijing’s claimed sovereignty over the island, test the response from international shipping companies, and put significant pressure on Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China has the capabilities to successfully execute these and other quarantine variations, these would require operations that are far more complex than anything China has demonstrated to date. Such moves would carry significant risk for China, and its success would depend to a large degree on how Taiwan, the United States, and others respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if successfully implemented, there are limits to what a quarantine can achieve. If Beijing’s goal is to inflict enough pain to force Taiwan’s surrender, China would need to move beyond the gray zone into overt military action. A military blockade would be a key option for China if it seeks to forcefully unify Taiwan without launching an all-out invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【蘋果案】黎智英指新冠肺炎致人命經濟損失 料美國人民會支持對中國實施制裁懲罰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（4日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第88日審訊。昨日辯方指黎身體不適及發抖，至今日黎如期出庭應訊。控方繼續播放國安法生效前黎智英受訪片段，在2020年6月與美國神父 Robert Sirico 的對談中，黎指經過新冠肺炎疫情之後，西方國家不再信任中國，並以審慎的態度與中國貿易；而且中國經濟變得衰弱，對美國來說是一個好時機去改變中國，乃至拯救全世界。黎又指新冠疫情導致很多美國人喪失親友、企業倒閉和蒙受金錢損失等等，他們對於中國忿忿不平，必定會支持時任美國總統特朗普制裁中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英對談節目稱初來香港感受到自由-八九民運後創辦壹週刊雜誌&quot;&gt;黎智英對談節目稱初來香港感受到自由 八九民運後創辦《壹週刊》雜誌&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨日辯方指黎身體不適及發抖，法官指黎需要送院作進一步檢查，遂押後至今日續審。今日黎如期出庭應訊，辯方指黎感覺比昨天好轉，因此審訊繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放2020年6月18日美國智庫 Acton Institute 的節目影片，當中黎智英與美國神父 Robert Sirico 對談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎憶述他年輕時初到香港，看到早餐有很多選擇，感到這個地方有自由、深受感動，雖然晚上要在工廠留宿，但他感到日子過得十分開心，因為感到這裡享有自由，獲得所有機會去證明自己、奮鬥、成就他想做的事。黎在工廠打工，期間自學英語，後來因為懂得英語而獲得機會晉升至推銷員。1969年，黎再獲得機會赴美國工作，當時正值胡士托音樂節舉行，後來演變成暴動，黎指他當時正在前往紐約，惟路途被截斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直至27歲，黎成立自己的小型工廠，後來工廠規模變大，黎亦創立了成衣品牌「佐丹奴」。1989年北京爆發民運，黎全力支持，六四鎮壓之後他去信譴責李鵬，之後開始被中國打壓，被禁止在中國經營門市，黎因而被迫賣出「佐丹奴」，轉做傳媒生意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;八九民運之後，黎創辦《壹週刊》雜誌，並打正旗號作為一個反對中共的雜誌，黎形容業務非常成功。他指當時所有人都自我審查、不敢得罪中共，而他在那時創辦雜誌，是一個很好的時機去填補市場的空白。黎其後創辦香港《蘋果日報》，成為香港最大報紙之一，後來再創辦台灣《蘋果日報》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指很多主教替中國說好話-只有陳日君敢於與中國唱反調&quot;&gt;黎智英指很多主教替中國說好話 只有陳日君敢於與中國唱反調&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;談到天主教徒身份，黎指其太太對他影響甚大，因為太太是一名虔誠的天主教徒，每逢星期日，黎與太太一同前往教堂，直至1997年黎皈依天主教。他表示從來不是以一種「為了社會或為了其他人」的心態而去爭取民主自由，而是他覺得自己應該去做，便去做，有時可能做得對，有時亦可能做錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到何時認識天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機，黎指當他皈依天主教的時候，陳日君仍是一名主教，由於二人追求自由的理念一致，所以多年來是好友。黎引述陳曾說過「梵蒂岡出賣了地下教會」，使陳十分傷心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指很多主教都親中國、不時替中國說好話，甚至有的羅馬天主教會的樞機主教立場保守，希望避免得罪中國，唯一敢於與中國唱反調的樞機是陳日君。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，香港人的價值觀與西方一致，惟中國有著截然不同的價值觀，當中國以截然不同的價值觀與外界進行貿易來往時，世界將永無寧日。黎又指，當中國愈來愈富裕的時候，他們並不會愈來愈接近西方價值，反而會愈來愈不同，甚至想轉過來改變西方。他形容習近平是「人類史上最極端的獨裁者」，想帶領中國變回毛澤東時代，甚至懂得利用科技來監控人民。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指疫情令美國人蒙受損失-若特朗普推制裁會支持&quot;&gt;黎智英指疫情令美國人蒙受損失 若特朗普推制裁會支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎形容美國是唯一「救星」，他提到經過新冠肺炎疫情之後，西方國家不再信任中國，並以審慎的態度與中國貿易；而且中國經濟變得衰弱，對於時任美國總統特朗普來說，這是一個好時機去改變中國，乃至拯救全世界。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，若然特朗普推行一連串的制裁和懲罰措施，他會得到很多來自美國人民的支持，因為新冠疫情導致很多美國人喪失親友、企業倒閉和蒙受金錢損失等等，他們對於中國忿忿不平，必定會支持制裁中國。黎形容這是一個絕妙的方式去促使中國改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方接著播放黎智英whatsapp搜獲影片-大部份為羅傑斯發言片段不涉黎&quot;&gt;控方接著播放黎智英WhatsApp搜獲影片 大部份為羅傑斯發言片段、不涉黎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後播放多段由黎智英 WhatsApp 接收的影片，大部份為「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）的受訪和公開發言片段。播片前，法官李運騰質疑影片不涉及黎智英，控方有什麼基礎播放這些影片，又指影片是在海外拍攝，可以怎樣協助控方舉證。控方代表、高級檢控官徐倩姿則指，這些影片是在黎智英的 WhatsApp 發現，能夠顯示黎對影片內容知情，而且影片內容能夠讓法庭了解案發時的背景。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2019年7月19日，羅傑斯向黎智英傳送一段《大紀元時報》節目「美國思想領袖」（American Thought Leader）片段。當時反修例運動已爆發，羅傑斯在節目中指香港在97年主權移交以後，自由逐漸被侵蝕，而政府推動《逃犯條例》修訂，該草案容許政府將所有「眼中釘」從有法治的香港，去到沒有法治、只有「以法治國」（rule by law）的中國，不少香港人視草案為「最後一根稻草」，若修訂草案通過，中港之間的「防火牆」將會消失，形容這是主權移交22年以來最差的時候。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到近年中國情況，羅傑斯指中國對基督教教堂、法輪功和西藏進行打壓，沒有宗教自由，難以理解為何一個主張「真、善、忍」的信仰系統，會遭受中國當局如此殘酷的回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅傑斯又稱，不知名人士曾寄送恐嚇信給他的鄰居和家人，要求羅傑斯停止繼續發聲。在一次公開場合中，有義工遭受襲擊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅傑斯指，中國問題不僅限於中國內的人權和自由問題，如今更已對外國構成了威脅。他形容香港站在戰線前沿，因香港作為國際金融中心，也是亞洲最開放的城市之一，如果失去香港則後果不堪設想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;羅傑斯英國有責任帶頭呼籲制裁中國&quot;&gt;羅傑斯：英國有責任帶頭呼籲制裁中國&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另播放羅傑斯在2019年12月9日於倫敦「國際人權日」的發言、同月呼籲劍橋大學撤銷前特首林鄭月娥榮譽院士名銜的行動發言，以及2020年3月5日的受訪片段。羅傑斯指懂得區分「反中」與「反中共」是很重要，他18歲時曾到中國居住6個月，在當地認識了不少內地朋友，他強調在文化和朋友的層面上很喜歡中國。至於前特首林鄭月娥，羅傑斯指她不願聆聽6月9日一百萬上街市民的聲音，也不願聆聽6月16日二百萬上街市民的聲音，因此不值得擁有榮譽院士名銜。另外，在2019年11月25日的影片中，羅傑斯指英國有責任帶頭呼籲制裁中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，控方表示尚餘6小時影片需要播放。&lt;/p&gt;

The paper analyses how the EU is using arguments linked to upholding values and appealing to the interests of third countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diplomacy and strategic communications are key to making sanctions effective. Tackling the challenge of sanctions circumvention requires the cooperation of non-sanctioning (or third) countries, and sanctions diplomacy plays an important role in persuading them to cooperate. This paper offers a data-driven analysis of the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions against Russia, showing that the EU relies mostly on addressing interests (such as EU accession and economic interests) and framing support for sanctions as economically or politically desirable for third countries. To a lesser degree, values also play a role in the EU’s outreach, mostly in relation to protecting the principles of international law. This is in line with EU foreign policy’s broader shift to focusing more on interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of sanctions circumvention, EU sanctions diplomacy applies a “stick and carrot” approach to both warn third countries of the potential negative impact on their economies if they allow such activities, and praise the efforts of countries that pledge to tackle circumvention. This communication implies that becoming a platform for circumvention can lead to reputational damage, resulting in fewer investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the EU takes a different communication approach towards EU candidates than towards other third countries. Regarding the wider set of third countries, the EU generally accepts their wish not to align on sanctions, and only aims to compel them to tackle circumvention. On the other hand, EU candidate countries are reminded of their commitment to align with the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy as part of the accession process, including alignment on sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On values, the EU links cooperation on sanctions to defending the values of international law, offering third countries an opportunity to frame their support for sanctions as a way to help uphold the principles of international law, rather than framing them as explicit measures against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU should focus on tracking policy developments in third countries, following their pledges to tackle circumvention, and adjust EU sanctions diplomacy accordingly. The EU should also resort more strongly to highlighting the requirement for EU candidate countries to align with sanctions. For other third countries, the EU should offer framings that highlight international norms and explore different options, such as environmental concerns surrounding Russia’s shadow fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2022, the EU and its allies have adopted a series of sanctions to respond to Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. A key challenge of making these restrictive measures effective is the tackling of circumvention, as redirecting trade of sanctioned goods through third countries can diminish the impact of sanctions. However, beyond stricter enforcement within the EU, this also requires the cooperation of non-sanctioning countries, as taking action to hinder circumvention through their territory is their sovereign choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper examines the following question: How does the EU use strategic communications to persuade third countries to cooperate on sanctions? The paper analyses how the EU is using arguments linked to upholding values (supporting sanctions to protect the values of international law) and appealing to third countries’ interests (such as EU accession and economic interests) in its strategic communications on sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU has taken several steps to close loopholes and strengthen the role of sanctions diplomacy – in other words, diplomatic efforts “to persuade [third] countries to follow suit”. As the paper demonstrates, however, in the case of the EU, sanctions diplomacy has been used not only to persuade countries to follow suit, but also to incentivise third countries to address circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 12th sanctions package of the EU, adopted in December 2023, has strengthened its anti-circumvention measures, which were already put at the top of the agenda in the 11th sanctions package in June 2023. Furthermore, the 13th package, adopted in February 2024, listed several companies in third countries that have been involved in sanctions circumvention. The EU’s diplomatic efforts to tackle sanctions evasion have also been supported by the appointment of the International Special Envoy for the Implementation of EU Sanctions (EU sanctions envoy) at the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, several third countries have been expressing their reservations about and even opposition to sanctions. Latin American countries reportedly advocated for omitting mentions of support for Ukraine from the July 2023 EU-CELAC summit declaration. South Africa claimed sanctions against Russia were causing collateral damage to “bystander countries”. India has been denying criticisms that the country would be facilitating sanctions circumvention by reselling refined Russian oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments underline the need for constructive dialogue between the sanctions senders and third countries. They also highlight the importance of the public element of the EU’s sanctions diplomacy, namely the EU’s strategic communications as a “goal-directed communication activity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research on the perceived challenges of the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions has been relatively sparse. Nevertheless, existing literature contends that the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions have been driven by values rather than interests. This also led to the suggestion that the EU should reformulate its sanctions diplomacy “with more focus on the interests of states in joining the collective sanctions against Russia”. This paper argues that the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions have been focusing on interest-based arguments, in line with a shift towards highlighting interests in the EU’s foreign policy, as discussed in Chapter I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is comprised of three chapters. Chapter I examines the role of sanctions diplomacy, the factors influencing third countries’ approaches to sanctions, and the EU’s shifting foreign policy, which form the context of the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions. Chapter II breaks down the communications strategies of EU officials in relation to Russia sanctions using a data-driven approach including an expert survey and word frequency analysis. Chapter III interprets the results and examines how the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions have balanced values- and interest-based communications in relation to the countries visited by the EU sanctions envoy. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations on how the EU can optimise its strategic communications on sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is based on a review of speeches, press conferences and interviews: strategic communications that create expectations ahead of meetings between the EU and third countries, and frame outcomes after such meetings. The paper analyses the communications outputs of two key EU representatives: the EU sanctions envoy, David O’Sullivan; and the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission (EU HR/VP) Josep Borrell. The analysis looked at EU communications issued between February and September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definitions of strategic communications and public diplomacy are not universally accepted. For Philip M Taylor, public diplomacy is one of the four pillars of strategic communications, while for Michael Vlahos, “public diplomacy” and “strategic communications” are synonymous. According to Guy J Golan and Sung-Un Yang, public diplomacy is the “management of communication” among diplomatic actors which have an objective of reaching foreign publics to promote national interest. However, for Nicholas J Cull, strategic communications is just one of many terms that describe what is essentially “conducting foreign policy by engaging foreign publics”. For Ali Fisher, strategic communications is the “telling” end of the spectrum of public diplomacy, messaging directly to foreign audiences. As this paper examines the EU’s direct messaging to foreign audiences through press releases, blogs and media interviews, it relies on Fisher’s definition, and employs the term “strategic communications”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the wider category of third countries targeted by strategic communications, the paper focuses on countries where the EU sanctions envoy has led negotiations. Within this group of countries, the paper examines six countries (out of nine) in which the EU sanctions envoy and third country officials communicated publicly around the negotiations: Armenia; Georgia; Kazakhstan; Kyrgyzstan; Serbia; and Uzbekistan. Three of the nine countries had to be omitted from the analysis as no public statements could be identified on the EU sanctions envoy’s visits to the following jurisdictions: Türkiye; Pakistan; and the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review relied on desk-based research to retrieve the relevant communications materials and compile an analysis of academic literature. In its analysis of communications of relevant EU officials, the paper relies as much as is feasible on direct quotes, and not on reporters’ interpretations or descriptions. This ensures that only the language directly attributable to the EU officials is analysed, with the exception of Armenia and Serbia, for which the analysis sources did not reveal direct quotes by the EU sanctions envoy; the paper therefore uses secondary sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper introduces the typology of “values-based” and “interest-based” communications, building on international relations and public diplomacy literature. For the purposes of this paper, “interest-based” communications focus on appealing to strategic interests, including political, military, economic and trade. “Values-based” communications focus on culture, values and ideals (political, economic and social systems), which can create an enabling environment for national interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodology is inspired by Gry Espedal and colleagues’ book on researching values, with a special focus on Arild Wæraas’s chapter on making values emerge from texts and Benedicte Maria Tveter Kivle and Gry Espedal’s chapter on identifying values through discourse analysis. Furthermore, Paul Baker provides valuable insights on employing frequency analysis and using occurrences in discourse analysis. The paper’s methodology builds on two key approaches: the term “frequency analysis” as used by Steven Louis Pike; and Francis A Beer, Barry J Balleck and Ricardo Real P Sousa’s classification of idealist and realist vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the use of frequency analysis, Kathleen Ahrens found that “narrowly focused corpora are suitable for identifying different viewpoints through an examination of lexical frequency patterns”. Pike used frequency analysis to research the narrative-driven shifts in US public diplomacy messaging and strategy. According to Baker, discourse analysis can point to “patterns in language (both frequent and rare) which must then be interpreted in order to suggest the existence of discourses”. To identify the main framings used by the EU to compel third countries to cooperate on sanctions, the paper builds on a frequency analysis of terms (collocations) used in EU sanctions communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the main analysis, the author worked with 23 texts (10,921 words) published between February and September 2023 (see Annex). The texts were published online, on EU institutional websites, on governmental websites in Armenia and Serbia, and through media outlets in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mine the most often-used terms, the statistical programme “r” was used, which can be used to measure term and document frequency and the co-occurrence of words, among other things. This allows for the calculation of possible collocations, which, according to Andreas Niekler and Gregor Wiedemann, “comprise two (or more) semantically related [words] … which form a distinct new sense”. Two terms, if they occur “significantly more often as direct neighbours as expected by chance”, can be treated as collocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most-often used collocations were listed in a survey which asked respondents to assign each collocation a score from 1 (values-based) to 7 (interest-based), based on their perception. This Likert scale allowed respondents to express the nuances of the level to which they perceived that collocations were falling towards a more values-based approach (scores 1–3), or a more interest-based approach (scores 5–7), or whether the collocations were neither explicitly values- nor interest-based (score 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey was completed during January 2024 by 15 members of the European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), experts who have worked on sanctions within the framework of the network and focus on international relations studies. They represent think tanks from the UK and eight EU member states: Czechia; France; Germany; Hungary; Latvia; Lithuania; Poland; and Sweden. This covers perceptions from across different regions of the EU and the UK, thereby attempting to reflect geographic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey presented the respondents with the topic of the paper, a description of the corpus and the definition of values- and interest-based communications as described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-and-limitations&quot;&gt;Challenges and Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key challenges for the research included the sample size of texts that could be analysed, as the sample is limited by the number of countries that the EU sanctions envoy has visited and where public communications were part of the envoy’s visit. Furthermore, sources being in the third countries’ languages posed a challenge, which was surmountable through the use of online translation tools, cross-checking against dictionaries and translation applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge was developing a list of concepts to be used in the analysis to better understand the mode of communication (values-based or interest-based) employed by the EU in its sanctions diplomacy. The “coding” or classification through experts in the field of international relations from across the EU and the UK allowed for minimal cultural bias and an independent assessment of the terms employed in EU strategic communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-eu-sanctions-communications-towards-third-countries&quot;&gt;I. EU Sanctions Communications Towards Third Countries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU has consistently used strategic communications as part of its sanctions diplomacy towards third countries, aimed at reinforcing its sanctions policy. This is critical, as “active non-cooperation by [third] countries can sabotage the effort by providing offsetting assistance to the targeted regime”. This shows that third countries’ positioning in the dispute between the sanctions sender (EU) and the target (Russia) is highly relevant for the efficacy of sanctions, with “multilateral” sanctions deemed more successful than “unilateral” sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthening sanctions diplomacy efforts, the EU appointed David O’Sullivan as sanctions envoy in December 2022. The role of sanctions diplomacy was further reinforced by the 11th package of sanctions, adopted on 23 June 2023, which set out a multi-step approach to tackling sanctions circumvention, starting with the strengthening of “bilateral and multilateral cooperation through diplomatic engagement with, and the provision of increased technical assistance to, the third countries in question”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the first round of diplomatic efforts yields no results, the EU can employ targeted proportionate measures aimed solely at depriving Russia of strategic resources. If this approach still fails to deliver results, the EU pursues re-engagement with the relevant third country. However, if these diplomatic efforts to tackle circumvention still fall short, the EU can adopt exceptional last-resort measures, including the restriction of sale, supply, transfer or export of sensitive dual-use goods and technology to the third country. At the time of writing, the EU has not yet resorted to the use of such last-resort measures for a third country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;eu-strategic-communications-to-third-countries&quot;&gt;EU Strategic Communications to Third Countries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going beyond tackling circumvention, the EU has also been attempting to incentivise certain third countries to align with its sanctions policies. Alignment has no legal definition, but in diplomacy, it is used to signal a third country’s public willingness to adopt sanctions similar to those of the EU. Between February and September 2023, the EU offered the opportunity for 14 non-EU countries to align with EU sanctions, and those which did were listed in declarations and statements issued by the EU HR/VP. While these declarations and statements are not legally binding, they offer a way for the EU to communicate the international support for its sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EU Candidate Countries, EEA Member Countries and Eastern Partnership Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sanctions form part of the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), candidate countries are formally required to progressively align with those sanctions, reaching full alignment prior to accession. This expectation of candidate countries was also expressed in the European Council conclusions of 24 June 2022. However, as the evidence shows, not all candidate countries have been aligning themselves with the EU sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU’s attempts to see countries join its sanctions efforts are most successful in its immediate neighbourhood, specifically among certain EU candidate countries and European Economic Area (EEA) countries. The declarations and statements by the EU HR/VP on the “alignment of certain countries” show that from February 2022 to September 2023, EU candidate countries Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Ukraine, and EEA members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway have been consistently aligning themselves with EU sanctions. The candidate countries Georgia (potential candidate country until December 2023), Moldova (candidate country since June 2023) and Serbia were listed in certain declarations, while candidate country Türkiye and Eastern Partnership countries Armenia and Azerbaijan were not listed in any declarations regarding the alignment on sanctions against Russia between February 2022 and September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EU Partner Countries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While certain regional partners of the EU are not invited to join the declarations on alignment, they still communicate their adherence to the sanctions policy on Russia. Switzerland, for example, has issued its own announcements on its alignment with EU sanctions packages, without joining the EU HR/VP’s declarations. In the case of the 10th sanctions package, this “room for manoeuvre” was used in the Swiss Federal Council’s announcement to highlight that while the country was implementing the package, it also “introduce[d] a new means of safeguarding Swiss economic interests in specific cases”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For third countries, the alignment with EU sanctions depends both on a political evaluation of adopting the sanctions as a national foreign policy measure and on the political consequences of expressing public support for the EU’s sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;factors-influencing-third-countries-approaches-to-eu-sanctions&quot;&gt;Factors Influencing Third Countries’ Approaches to EU Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines the factors that third countries take into consideration when deciding whether to support sanctions regimes. This can offer valuable insights into the factors that can also determine the success of the EU’s sanctions communications towards third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research for this paper demonstrates that the economic links between the third country and the sanctioned country play a key role. For countries with close economic ties to Russia, sanctions present high costs and incentives to bust sanctions and provide indirect access to the sanctioned economy. Countries that are more economically dependent on Russia could therefore have limited means to implement sanctions, especially where social and economic groups have vested financial interests in continuing trade with the sanctioned country and lobby against sanctions implementation. Similarly, countries close to Russia in a vulnerable financial situation may fear economic disruption from the implementation of sanctions. Furthermore, the geopolitical orientation of third countries can also influence their decision on whether to support sanctions regimes. Another approach has been to look at the role of commercial and other actors in third countries, as “sanctions imposed against a target can make trade more profitable for a third party, presenting commercial opportunities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of Georgia showcases the interplay of several elements of the factors described above. The country did not decide to adhere to the sanctions against Russia, but introduced certain restrictive measures, particularly in the financial sphere. For Georgia, Russia is the third-largest trade partner, and the EU’s share, while it is still the main trade partner, is decreasing. The circumvention challenge in Georgia is further complicated due to its trade with the Eurasian Economic Union, which is used by Russia to conceal the destination of trade flows. Furthermore, Georgia is economically benefiting from the inflow of Russian citizens and capital to the country. These factors, among others, contribute to Georgia’s complex approach to sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the efforts of the EU to incentivise third countries to join its sanctions policies and the considerations influencing third countries’ choice of whether to support sanctions, it is important to analyse the type of goals EU sanctions diplomacy can attempt to achieve. Returning to the challenge of tackling circumvention, another avenue is for the EU to incentivise third countries to commit to tackling evasion through their territory, without asking them to align themselves with the EU’s sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-eus-shifting-foreign-policy-and-strategic-communications&quot;&gt;The EU’s Shifting Foreign Policy and Strategic Communications&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the EU’s approach to foreign policy and strategic communications is fundamental for a more comprehensive study of the EU’s sanctions policy. The EU’s foreign policy has been analysed, to a limited extent, through the prism of discourse analysis, finding that its foreign policy and identity are articulated by referencing liberal values. Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union presents these as the values that the Union is meant to defend and further internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the role of the EU’s public diplomacy and strategic communications, it has been noted that while the European External Action Service (EEAS) should be key to helping “ethical Europe” grow, it should also provide a keen sense of strategic direction and interests. The EU has been described in the literature as a “normative power”, as it “was constructed on a normative basis, [which] predisposes it to act in a normative way in world politics”. However, the 2016 EU Global Strategy set out the “principled pragmatism” approach, which considers the combination of interests and values as a guiding principle of the EU’s external action. The focus on interests was reinforced in the 2022 EU Strategic Compass, in which Borrell stated that the EU has to learn lessons from recent crises, including “finally getting serious about threats to our strategic interests that we have been aware of but not always acted upon”. The shift in the EU’s strategic communications to interests is also in line with the view of Allan Rosas, who highlighted that “sanctions should not be seen as value imperialism … as the Union is taking them to pursue not only its values but also its interests”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-expert-perception-of-eu-sanctions-communications-on-the-values-interest-spectrum&quot;&gt;II. Expert Perception of EU Sanctions Communications on the Values-Interest Spectrum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the role of the EU’s sanctions communications as a foreign policy tool, the paper assesses them along the values-interests spectrum. To this purpose, the paper examined the speeches, interviews and other communications outputs of the EU sanctions envoy and the EU HR/VP from February to September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the communications led to identifying the most frequently used pairings of two words in communications outputs, or “collocations”. Using the statistical programme “r”, the analysis computed 395 collocations using the “quanteda.textstats” package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme identifies collocation candidates based on the co-occurrence of patterns of words. The programme takes out the most frequently used word fillers or “stop words”, including “of”, “to” and “but”, which therefore do not appear in the 395 collocations that were computed. Of those, 116 collocations occurred three or more times and 279 collocations occurred two times across the 23 texts analysed. To focus only on collocations that occur a significant number of times across the 23 texts, the paper does not consider the 279 collocations that occurred only twice in EU communications. This process led to the reduction of the number of collocations to 25 and four synonyms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next in the analysis, the collocations were to be categorised on the values-interest spectrum. Respondents completed the survey asking them to assign each collocation a score from 1 (values-based) to 7 (interest-based) based on their perception, reflecting the subjective judgement of each anonymous respondent. The responses were recorded anonymously and exported to Excel. The analysis used the rounded median of the responses to avoid the result being skewed by outliers. Table 1 shows the rounded median of the survey’s ratings and the number of times the collocation occurred in the 23 texts analysed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Most-Often Used Collocations in EU Sanctions Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a better understanding of where the collocations lie on the values-interest spectrum, the results are summarised in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/l2NVZzq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Collocations on the Values-Interest Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 plots both the number and the occurrence of collocations in each of the seven categories along the values-interest spectrum, ranging from strongly values-based to strongly interest-based. The number of collocations (dots) shows how many of the terms were perceived to fall into each of the seven categories by the expert respondents to the survey. The occurrence of collocations falling into each category (bars) shows how many times the terms appeared across the analysed texts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 demonstrates that interest-based collocations occurred significantly more often (91 times in total, including both weakly and moderately interest-based collocations) than values-based terms (17 times in total, including both weakly and moderately values-based collocations) or terms that were perceived as neither values- nor interest-based (16 times). The 11 moderately interest-based collocations occurred 60 times across the 23 texts analysed, making them the most commonly occurring terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of analysis demonstrate that the EU’s strategic communications on sanctions strongly rely on interest-based terms. However, values and particularly the norms of international law also play a role in its communications – this is examined in more detail in Chapter III. Furthermore, the EU also employs terms that are neither values- not interest-based among the most-occurred terms in the analysed communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-balance-between-values--and-interest-based-eu-communications-on-sanctions&quot;&gt;III. The Balance Between Values- and Interest-Based EU Communications on Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of the survey demonstrate the complexity of the EU’s sanctions diplomacy. While collocations that are perceived as interest-based by experts occur more often in quotes by O’Sullivan and Borrell, the use of values-based communication adds a nuance to the picture and raises the following questions. How are the collocations used in EU communications? How can they be interpreted in the context of the EU officials’ declarations? What do they divulge about the EU’s sanctions diplomacy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preventing-circumvention-targeting-third-countries-interests&quot;&gt;Preventing Circumvention: Targeting Third Countries’ Interests&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collocations related to circumvention and evasion have a central importance in EU sanctions diplomacy, playing a particular role in conveying a message targeting the interests of third countries. The EU is warning third countries that allowing their territories to be used for circumvention could damage their economies. Conversely, third countries’ efforts to tackle circumvention are met with praise in EU communications, setting a clear expectation for third countries. The circumvention- and evasion-related collocations were perceived to be moderately interest-based by the expert respondents to the survey, further confirming the role of these expressions in appealing to the interests of both the EU and third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Platform [for] circumvention” was a particularly often used expression, with 10 occurrences. It was used to point out a threat and underline how becoming a platform for circumvention would go against the interest of third countries. O’Sullivan underlined the importance of the reputational damage that ensues when a country is proven to be a platform for sanctions circumvention, noting that “it will have a chilling effect on the companies of other countries. They no longer want to work with a country that helps them circumvent sanctions”. This was a clear message to third countries, highlighting the fact that allowing for circumvention will damage their investment prospects. In Georgia, the government’s efforts were highlighted by O’Sullivan in June 2023, who noted that the “Georgian authorities are taking very seriously the issue of not allowing this country to be used as a platform for circumvention”, noting that the country has put in place export-controlling measures on the most sensitive battlefield products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing the challenge of “platform [for] circumvention” was also used to describe the very focus of the mission of O’Sullivan, who declared that “cooperating and engaging in a dialogue with third countries that could be used as a platform for circumvention is vital”. The expression was also used when describing the expectation of EU sanctions diplomacy, with O’Sullivan declaring about third countries that “what they usually say is that they don’t want to align with EU sanctions, but at the same time they don’t wish to be a platform for circumvention or evasion of sanctions, and therefore they will cooperate with us in trying to prevent that”. However, there are differences between the expectations towards EU candidate countries and non-candidate countries, as demonstrated below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the expressions “circumvent sanctions” and “circumvention [of] sanctions” occurred exceptionally often in EU sanctions communications – in total, 13 times in the texts analysed – and those expressions were perceived as moderately interest-based. They fulfilled a similar role to the expression “platform [for] circumvention” in EU communications, warning of the negative impact of allowing circumvention, and praising efforts to tackle it. O’Sullivan focused on the former when he declared that “we are particularly concerned if there’s any circumvention of the sanctions on these [battlefield] products. This has led us to visit a range of countries in the last few months”. In Uzbekistan, for example, O’Sullivan used circumvention in the context of commending the country’s assurances on being against having its territory used for sanctions circumvention, while “respect[ing] Uzbekistan’s desire to remain neutral [in Russia’s war against Ukraine]”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two expressions linked to evasion, “sanction evasion” and “evade sanction”, occurred seven times in total, placing them among the most-often used collocations in the analysed texts. They were used in the same way as expressions mentioning circumvention, focusing on warning and praising third countries. O’Sullivan highlighted that “our legal powers now enable us to sanction an entity in a non-EU country that is aiding a European company to evade sanctions”. As a positive assessment, he underlined that, for Georgia, “there are various ways in which people can try to evade sanctions, whether that’s at customs points or false declarations. And the Georgian authorities have put in place, as I say very impressive measures of trying to monitor this and make sure that it doesn’t happen”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;beyond-tackling-circumvention-addressing-implementation-and-alignment&quot;&gt;Beyond Tackling Circumvention: Addressing Implementation and Alignment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU communications addressed the options beyond tackling circumvention through third countries, including the questions of implementation, adoption and alignment on sanctions. These play an especially important role in the difference between the EU’s communications towards EU candidate countries and its communication towards other third countries. EU candidate countries are formally required to progressively align with the EU’s CFSP, which includes sanctions. A full alignment on sanctions needs to be reached prior to accession. This provides the EU with a tool to use regarding EU candidate countries to appeal to their political and economic interests in pursuing the EU accession process successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU sanctions communications used three key collocations to describe how far countries potentially could go in supporting EU sanctions. On one hand, these expressions offered a way to remind EU candidate countries of their commitments. On the other, they offered a way to demonstrate that in most third countries, the EU is not asking for alignment, but only for help in tackling circumvention. These can be seen as a “compromise offer” by the EU to non-candidate countries, highlighting that while it could ask for more efforts, it is accepting tackling circumvention as a commendable policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terms used for communicating these interests are the weakly interest-based terms “implement sanctions”, along with its synonym “sanctions implementation” (among the most-used terms, occurred eight times) and “impose sanctions” (six times) and the moderately interest-based term “align sanctions” (four times).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking about his country visits, O’Sullivan highlighted that in the cases of EU candidate countries, “the context is always different of course in … Serbia and Türkiye … candidates for accession to the European Union, so there is actually potentially an obligation on them to align with our sanctions”. In the same statement, he also underlined that non-candidate countries, such as countries in central Asia or certain countries in the Caucasus, have no obligation to align with EU sanctions. This point was repeated by Borrell in September 2023, noting that “we expect our partner countries and, in particular those who aspire to become members, to align with our foreign policy decisions”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU’s relationship with candidate and potential candidate countries demonstrates that the issues of implementation, adoption and alignment on sanctions can be used to appeal to EU candidate countries’ interests on joining the EU. It also allows the EU to express disapproval of certain policies, including engaging with sanctioned entities. In September 2023, Borrell noted that the EU regretted the Georgian government’s decision to resume flights to and from Russia and allow sanctioned individuals to enter the country, highlighting that “these decisions go against EU’s policy and international efforts to isolate Russia internationally due to its illegal war”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;naming-the-war-stopping-russias-war-machine&quot;&gt;Naming the War: Stopping Russia’s War Machine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU has countered Moscow’s continuous refusal to call the war in Ukraine by its name, referring to it as a “special military operation”, by clearly referencing “the war” and Russia’s “war machine” in its communications. The terms “war machine” and “invasion [of] Ukraine” were perceived as neither values- nor interest-based and are therefore seen as more descriptive expressions by the expert respondents to the survey. However, the importance of these terms is signalled by the number of times they occurred (“war machine” seven times and “invasion [of] Ukraine” six). They offer a clear way for the EU to steer third countries towards using the same framing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expression “war machine” was primarily used to describe the “Russian war machine” as a concept. It was employed to underline that most third countries do not wish to contribute to fuelling the Russian war machine, while remaining neutral in the conflict. In general, the aim of the EU’s restrictive measures is described in terms of “crippling Russia’s war machine”, targeting both the material and financial means of the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentioning the “invasion [of] Ukraine” fulfilled a similar role in the EU’s sanctions diplomacy. While “war machine” was used in relation to the aim of sanctions, “invasion [of] Ukraine” was used in the context of describing the reason for the sanctions being put in place. O’Sullivan noted that the EU’s most important message is that “we oppose Russia’s invasion of Ukraine”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;appealing-to-values-the-role-of-international-law&quot;&gt;Appealing to Values: The Role of International Law&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the results of the analysis show that the EU predominantly communicated by addressing interests, its sanctions diplomacy also contains an important element of values-based communications, focusing primarily on international law. Three values-based collocations, “UN Charter”, “war crime” and “international law”, were used to appeal to the values of international law. These terms were used both to remind third countries of the importance of upholding these principles and to praise third countries’ cooperation by specifically referring to international law. By linking the cooperation on sanctions to international norms, the EU offers an opportunity for third countries to frame any support for tackling circumvention as a positive effort to strengthen the norms of international law. This can be an attractive framing for third countries that have close geopolitical or economic ties to Russia and might be reluctant to communicate cooperating on these measures explicitly as steps against Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borrell noted that he “appreciated the ‘principled position of Kazakhstan based on respect for the UN Charter and the territorial integrity of all UN members, including Ukraine’”. He also highlighted that the EU is asking “all countries … to stand on the side of the principles and values of the UN charter and international law”. This demonstrates the EU’s expectation of third countries to support its sanctions efforts not only because it is in their economic interest, as the use of circumvention-related expressions shows above, but also because it is essential for upholding the norms and values of international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underlining this approach, O’Sullivan summarised the EU’s message as “we believe that Putin’s actions are completely contrary to the UN charter, it is a war crime” and noted that “in the case of Russia, we are dealing with a particularly egregious breach of international law”. Similarly, Borrell noted that “what is happening in Ukraine is a blatant violation of the UN Charter and the international rules-based order”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Support Ukraine” and its synonym “Ukraine support” were perceived as the most strongly values-based terms among the 25 collocations analysed, with six occurrences in total. The term was primarily used to express that the EU is “supporting Ukraine, and we will support Ukraine for as long as it takes”, framing it as a goal of the EU’s sanctions policy, linking the support for the EU’s sanctions to supporting Ukraine. This can differ from the approach of highlighting international law, as it links the support for sanctions more explicitly to supporting Ukraine, not just international law in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU strategic communications on sanctions rely heavily on addressing economic and political interests. As the results of the data-driven analysis show, the most-often occurring terms in EU communications are perceived to target political and economic interests. Only a minority of terms appeals to values, mostly related to international law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s use of data analytics and an expert survey on perceptions offer a unique contribution to the discussion on EU sanctions communications, allowing for a more structured analysis along the values-interest spectrum. This data-driven approach provides a more informed understanding of EU communications and formulates more targeted and evidence-based recommendations on how to improve EU sanctions diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper presents the following findings and recommendations to EU policymakers and diplomats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-eu-sanctions-communications-overwhelmingly-rely-on-appealing-to-interests&quot;&gt;1. EU sanctions communications overwhelmingly rely on appealing to interests.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU tends to frame support for tackling sanctions circumvention as an economic interest of third countries. It employs a “stick-and-carrot” approach – the stick is a warning to third countries of the potential negative economic consequences and reputational damage of allowing circumvention, which can lead to fewer investments, while the carrot is the EU’s praise of the efforts of third countries which pledge to tackle circumvention through their territory, which can help bolster their reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The EU should hold third countries to their promises.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “carrot” of positive reputation through the EU’s praise can only be credible if the EU revises its communications consistently. As the EU can strengthen third countries’ reputations by praising their efforts, the EU also needs to withdraw its praise in public communications when third countries do not enact effective and enforceable policies. The EU needs to adapt this communication by expressing either continued praise if third countries indeed implement and enforce the announced anti-circumvention policies or change course and highlight shortcomings when the announced policies do not become reality or are not enforced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The EU should not fear using its economic power to compel countries to tackle sanctions circumvention.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU needs to continue warning countries of the negative impact of allowing sanctions circumvention and use the designation of third country companies as a credible threat. The “stick” of warning third countries of the consequences of allowing circumvention only works if the negative impact is demonstrated credibly, including through the listing of third country companies that facilitate sanctions circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-the-eu-communicates-different-expectations-for-eu-candidate-countries-and-other-third-countries&quot;&gt;2. The EU communicates different expectations for EU candidate countries and other third countries.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries on the path to join the EU are formally required to progressively align with the EU’s CFSP, including sanctions, reaching full alignment prior to accession. This expectation is expressed in references to imposing, implementing and aligning with EU sanctions communications, which are among the most-often used terms. Non-candidate countries have no obligation to align with the EU’s sanctions regime, and consequently, the EU communicates their efforts to address circumvention as a sufficient policy step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The EU should continue to use accession as a motivation for EU candidate countries to ensure they align with EU sanctions against Russia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU should make more explicit reference to the accession process in its communications to make EU candidate countries move forward with their alignment on sanctions against Russia. The communications around accession negotiations and other meetings of EU officials with EU candidate countries should be used as a platform to remind EU candidate countries of the clear incentive to adopt EU sanctions and signal their commitment to the accession process. This needs to be highlighted in public communications in the candidate countries, informing the public of this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;3-the-eu-uses-the-referencing-of-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-in-eu-sanctions-diplomacy-as-a-tool-to-counter-russias-narrative-in-third-countries&quot;&gt;3. The EU uses the referencing of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in EU sanctions diplomacy as a tool to counter Russia’s narrative in third countries.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU uses the referencing of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in neither a values-based nor interest-based manner. However, it can serve as a tool to counter Russian narratives in third countries which have a high degree of political and economic ties to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The EU should continue to use all available forums to counter Russia’s narratives, including press conferences and other public statements from the EU sanctions envoy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU sanctions envoy regularly visits countries with different degrees of ties to Russia, where the EU’s messages might not get the desired visibility. These visits can offer an opportunity to highlight the EU’s narrative and counter Russia’s disinformation. By giving interviews and being featured in the press, EU officials can create more visibility for the EU’s narratives in third countries, therefore the EU sanctions envoy and other officials should use all channels at their disposal to engage with the media during their in-country visits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;4-while-values-play-a-less-important-role-than-interests-in-the-eus-sanctions-communications-the-communications-employ-a-valuable-framing-tool-related-to-international-law&quot;&gt;4. While values play a less important role than interests in the EU’s sanctions communications, the communications employ a valuable framing tool related to international law.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU addresses values mainly by referring to international law and linking the support for sanctions to strengthening these values. The EU HR/VP has explicitly commended the “principled position of Kazakhstan based on respect for the UN Charter” and, in this context, acknowledged Kazakhstan’s “efforts to ensure its territory is not used to circumvent European and international sanctions against Russia”, which demonstrates the impact of values in EU strategic communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The EU should continue to use the values of international law in its strategic communications, which would help third countries to frame their efforts against circumvention.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU should reinforce its focus on the values of the UN Charter as it can offer an opportunity to third countries to frame their anti-circumvention policies as a contribution to upholding the principles of international law. This could be especially useful in third countries that have close geopolitical or economic ties with Russia. In these countries, a framing referring to strengthening international law might be more attractive than a more explicit framing of anti-circumvention policies as measures directed against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;5-eu-sanctions-communications-could-explore-an-environmental-framing&quot;&gt;5. EU sanctions communications could explore an environmental framing.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain dimensions that were not addressed in EU strategic sanctions communications analysed for this paper, including Russia’s “shadow fleet”, mostly made up of uninsured old ships that transport oil to evade the oil price cap. The shadow fleet therefore presents a real environmental threat that could affect any of the littoral countries along the fleet’s routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation: The EU should explore referencing the environmental threat posed by Russia’s sanctions circumvention by sea in its strategic communications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would offer another incentive for third countries to support the EU’s sanctions efforts by tackling circumvention. Similar to the values of international law, environmental framing would allow third countries to frame their efforts to collaborate on tackling sanctions circumvention as a response to environmental concerns, rather than a measure directed more explicitly against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（3日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第87日審訊。控方打算繼續播放黎智英在《國安法》生效之前的受訪片段，惟辯方指黎身體不適，明顯可見正在「打冷顫」，又指昨晚黎見了醫生，惟只獲處方止痛藥。法官杜麗冰提議安排黎送院接受檢查，並且今天不應在黎缺席下續審，遂押後至明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻表示不幸地有一個壞消息要報告法庭，因黎智英身體不適，現時明顯地可見被告欄內的他正在「打冷顫」，又指昨晚黎見了醫生，惟只獲處方止痛藥（Panadol）。庭上所見，黎能夠自行步入及步出被告欄，他今天身穿啡色大褸上庭，而非平日所穿的普通外套。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰聽罷指，黎需要送院接受進一步身體檢查，不認為今天的審訊要在黎不在場下繼續，又表示理解黎有相當年紀及最近天氣不佳。杜官指示辯方律師在今日下午4時再了解情況及醫生意見，並且通知法庭。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行則表示會與懲教人員和警方溝通以作出安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎一度在被告欄內與律師團隊溝通，其後彭耀鴻向法官轉述黎智英擔心自己浪費在座所有人的時間。法官杜麗冰則稱沒有問題，最重要是黎在感到舒服的情況下才能繼續審訊，最終押後案件至明日不早於上午11時續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overnight on 30 May, media reporting claimed that US President Joe Biden had apparently relaxed restrictions on the use of US weapons against targets in Russia. This followed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky voicing his frustration at the continued existence of such limitations. The issue has been given extra relevance by Russian forces based in Belgorod launching a new operation around Kharkiv, and has been taken up by the NATO Secretary-General and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Journalists and analysts have been left to parse the meaning and phrasing of every (ambiguous) sentence uttered by Western politicians on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-ukrainian-operations-and-existing-constraints&quot;&gt;Current Ukrainian Operations and Existing Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start point, on which everyone seems to be in agreement, is that it is both legitimate and legal for Ukraine to attack military targets on Russian territory. It is defending itself against a Russian attack and can respond under Article 51 of the UN Charter, having been engaged in an International Armed Conflict since 2014. Provided it acts in accordance with International Humanitarian Law, it has a wide range of targets from which to choose, including oil and fuel production facilities which, while they may have a civilian function, are also contributing to the Russian war machine – so-called “dual use facilities”. Added to this would be the airbases for long-range Russian bombers that have been launching strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure and other civilian targets; military production facilities; ammunition dumps and storage facilities for other materiel; and a variety of military bases including the Russian ports for the Black Sea Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suggestion of caveats first appeared with the provision of sophisticated and mostly longer-range weapons that arrived in mid-2022 and early 2023, from multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) like the US HIMARS and UK M270, to cruise missiles like the UK Storm Shadow and French SCALP. Biden stated at the time that HIMARS would not be used against targets in Russia, and it later emerged that technical alterations had been made to ensure this was not possible. Meanwhile, UK statements on the use of Storm Shadow heavily emphasised its use inside Ukraine (including areas illegally annexed by Russia, like Crimea), mirroring apparent restrictions on the use of UK M270. The overriding concern in these early debates was the risk of escalation involved in any Russian response to the provision of more sophisticated and more threatening weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Removing restrictions on HIMARS and other MLRS systems, as well as Ukrainian artillery firing Western-supplied ammunition, would allow Ukraine to strike massing Russian forces and conduct counter-battery fire against artillery situated just over the border&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That debate continues to rage, with the benefit of two years’ observations on Russian rhetoric and actions, including strikes against Ukrainian civilian targets and growing suggestions of a Russian sabotage campaign inside Europe. But alongside the serious consideration of managing this escalation (or calling Russia’s bluff) should be a discussion on the military utility of – and possible targets for – such weapons. Ukraine is already running a deep strike campaign using drones against a range of targets, occasionally hitting Moscow itself, but more frequently striking refineries and production facilities. These attacks reduce supplies going directly to Russian forces, and also cut revenue used to fund the war. In addition, a campaign against bomber airfields has destroyed both long-range bombers and smaller fighter-bombers. Some of these attacks have used drones and have taken place at extreme ranges of over 1,000 miles, but there also appears to be an element of infiltration and ground sabotage against bases and rail links, including some over 3,000 miles from Ukraine. Finally, Ukraine’s use of both air and maritime drones against the Black Sea Fleet has sunk a number of ships and even threatened the port at Novorossiysk. What, then, would other weapons add?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-value-of-deep-strike&quot;&gt;The Value of Deep Strike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that the types of targets and the defences around them work against the drone programme. First, the drones used by Ukraine tend to be slow and have limited payloads. They use sheer numbers to get through to targets, and although they have very long ranges – it can be hard, especially in the face of Russian air defences – to get sufficient numbers through to cause major and long-lasting damage, especially against hardened targets or those under cover. Flight time can vary, but for long-distance targets is sufficient to give the Russians early warning, which necessitates Ukrainian mass or much closer (and riskier) infiltration operations. For the long-distance and relatively predictable targets, this may be enough, but Ukraine needs firepower that it can bring to bear rapidly and with little warning. This is where ATACMS – with multiple variants – comes into play, and it could provide a valuable weapon for striking airbases hosting both fighter-bombers and attack helicopters, as well as rear-area logistics and ammunition dumps. Depending on which variants have been provided, both cluster and unitary warheads have ranges of up to 190 miles, providing a threat to static locations, such as in Belgorod, Voronezh, Kursk and maybe even Lipetsk oblasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer-range air defence systems could also play a role, albeit with some significant risks involved. Russian bombers mostly launch their cruise missiles within Russian airspace, so the launching aircraft are outside the ranges of systems like IRIS-T (15 miles) or point defence like Starstreak (5 miles). The same is true of some aircraft launching glide bombs, which are currently being used to devastating effect both on civilian areas and Ukrainian forces on the front line. Some can be released from 25 miles away; in the north this can be done from Russia. They are almost impossible to intercept, and this can only be achieved at great cost with expensive missiles used for multiple incoming bombs. Ideally, launch aircraft would be caught on the ground, but as a fallback, a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system like Patriot – with a range of around 100 miles (depending on the target) – could be pushed closer to the front line to shoot down Russian aircraft before release. So-called “SAMbushes” involve removing launchers from around infrastructure and putting them at greater risk of attack, but pose a challenge to Russian aircraft which currently fire from airspace where they believe themselves to be safe. There is some doubt over the extent to which this represents a “strike” on Russian “territory”, but media reporting suggests there has been disquiet over the use of German systems, which at least indicates the expectation of some kind of existing constraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new development which raises the question of a potentially unintended constraint being rendered nonsensical by changes on the ground is the Russian assault towards Kharkiv and the massing of forces over the border from Sumy. Up until now, the “close” fight has largely been conducted unambiguously on Ukrainian territory. In the case of Kharkiv, the proximity to the border means that Russian assault forces have been able to mass and assemble inside Belgorod, and artillery fire from within Russia can reach Ukrainian forces along the front. Removing restrictions on “standard” HIMARS and other MLRS systems, as well as standard Ukrainian tube artillery firing Western-supplied 152mm and 155mm ammunition, would allow the Ukrainians to at least strike massing Russian forces and conduct counter-battery fire against artillery situated just over the border. In the case of HIMARS it would allow the Ukrainians to out-range the equivalent Russian guns (although reporting has indicated there is effective Russian interference with guided projectiles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The lesson of the past 18 months is that the deep battle complements fighting close-in and along the front line, but is not a substitute for it&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps surprising by their absence from this priority list are the Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles. While these would be useful for arms dumps, command locations and logistics targets with protection against drones, their (publicly-acknowledged) range of around 160 miles means that the launch point for the Ukrainian aircraft carrying them comes uncomfortably close to Russian air defences if the target is deep within Russia. For this reason, both have been used on targets much closer to the front line, including in and around Crimea. The provision of German Taurus, with a slightly larger warhead and a range up around 300 miles, could make striking deeper targets in Russia much more feasible, or bring additional firepower to bear on targets further south around Crimea, including the Kerch Bridge, where Russian air defences have already been degraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keeping-the-russians-guessing&quot;&gt;Keeping the Russians Guessing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth concluding with an acknowledgement of the military benefits of ambiguity and what a change in policy would not achieve. The public Western position around the use of such weapons has been hugely variable; UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron, for example, did not explicitly say UK-supplied weapons could be used in Russia, and many of the recent statements of support have been generic. Beyond the question of escalation management, it would be prudent to keep Russia guessing about what sophisticated weapons may or may not be used against its forces, because this poses dilemmas about what mix of air defence systems to deploy and what level of dispersal or early-warning systems may be necessary. We can assume that Storm Shadow (for example) has not yet been fired against a Russian target as no components have emerged from debris, but the potential exists if the right tone is struck. It may also be the case that, behind the scenes, some constraints have already been lifted. At sea, the UK has retrospectively claimed credit for the use of maritime drones against the Black Sea Fleet. Given the UK’s role, alongside others, in providing support to Ukrainian drone programmes, it is possible that a number of countries have already provided components for weapons that have struck Russian targets. The ambiguity over this support not only evades questions of escalation, but also provides few clues for Russia that would allow it to prepare countermeasures until after such weapons can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;larger-challenges-remain&quot;&gt;Larger Challenges Remain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, caution should be taken not to see a change in policy as a panacea for Ukraine’s current challenges. The successful campaign against Russian energy infrastructure has not forced Russia to reassess its campaign overall. The long-range bomber force has had to disperse and has reduced its strike capabilities, but has not ended attacks on civilian infrastructure. The decimation of the Black Sea Fleet has reopened exports from Odesa, but made little contribution to the ability of 2023’s counteroffensive to retake lost territory. And strikes on arms dumps behind the front lines and sabotage within Russia have reduced the flow of materiel going to the Russian army, but not to the extent that it has had to fall back. The lesson of the past 18 months is that the deep battle complements fighting close-in and along the front line, but is not a substitute for it. Striking forces across the border from Kharkiv will provide some immediate relief to Ukrainian forces and be of significant tactical benefit; in doctrinal terms, this is a “close battle” that happens to straddle the border with Russia. Overall, the challenges for Ukraine in 2024 and potential answers remain the same as before this decision: resupply of equipment and ammunition, recruitment and training of personnel, and effective defences to prevent or slow down Russian ground advances. Deep strike is not a silver bullet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MIMMbsp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名組織及參與初選的民主派，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16名不認罪被告中，劉偉聰、李予信2人罪名不成立，其餘14人則罪名成立。本案指控被告串謀以「非法手段」，取得立法會過半議席後無差別否決財政預算案，迫使特首解散立法會及辭職。辯方提出多項法律爭議，包括控罪中的「非法手段」應僅限於武力相關及刑事罪行，又認為被告否決預算案不構成濫權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官於長達337頁的判詞一一反駁，指《國安法》目的是防範及制止危害國安罪行，而立法會運作可被武力以外的手段癱瘓，例如網絡攻擊立會系統、生化或放射性物質攻擊議員，批評辯方狹窄詮釋會造成法律漏洞，是「荒謬、不合邏輯且有違《國安法》的目的」。法官亦認為，「非法手段」不限於刑事罪行，亦可涵蓋「違憲」行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，立法會議員集體肩負憲制責任，需據預算案利弊作審核和通過，雖然立法會不應「自動及機械式地」通過政府議案，但大多數議員蓄意無差別否決預算案，明顯是違反《基本法》下的議員職權；而議員藉此迫政府回應五大訴求，亦違反擁護《基本法》的規定，構成濫權。法官又指，控方指控被告無差別否決預算案造成的「憲制危機」，令政府不能推出新政策等，必然構成「嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能」，足以構成「顛覆國家政權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方曾爭議被告案發時相信「35+」不可能，惟法庭認為只屬「事實上不可能」，而非「法律上不可能」，該罪行客觀上不可能成功，不構成辯護理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kBxDRoF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被指以非法手段犯案&quot;&gt;被指以「非法手段」犯案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、陳仲衡、李運騰頒下的337判詞，主要處理法律爭議、整體案情、及各被告案情，本文處理法律爭議一部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方於本案指稱各被告達成協議參與一項謀劃，即串謀取得立會過半後，無差別否決預算案，迫使特首解散立法會及辭職。控方指控，被告違反《國安法》第22條，任何人組織、策劃、實施或參與實施「以武力、威脅使用武力或者其他非法手段」旨在顛覆國家政權行為，即屬犯罪，當中第3項「嚴重干擾、阻撓或破壞香港特區政權機關依法履行職能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納非法手段僅限武力-稱非武力可癱立會詮釋致法律漏洞&quot;&gt;官拒納「非法手段」僅限武力 稱非武力可癱立會、詮釋致法律漏洞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「非法手段」的定義，辯方爭議，根據「同類原則（Ejusdem Generis）」，控罪中的「非法手段」，應限於「使用武力或威脅使用武力」的非法手段，惟法庭不接納。法庭指，《國安法》首要目的是維護國家安全，而根據全國人大常委2020年5月22日作出的「說明」，鼓吹港獨自決、侮辱國旗國徽、煽動公衆仇恨、及癱瘓政府管治和立法會運作等「非暴力」行為，均可令國家安全受到破壞，《國安法》正是在此背景下制定；而全國人大5月28日通過制定《國安法》的「決定」，也指出要防範、制止及懲治「任何」分裂國家、顛覆國家政權等嚴重危害國安的行為和活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭認為，5.22說明和5.28決定提及「任何」活動，非單指武力相關的活動，因此辯方將「非法手段」狹義詮釋為限制於武力相關，是「荒謬、不合邏輯且有違《國安法》的目的」。法庭指，不難預計，立法會運作可被「武力或威脅使用武力」以外不同方式、形式或方法癱瘓，例如針對資訊科技、通訊和能源系統的網絡攻擊，能令立法會完全停止運作；立法會議員和職員，也可受到生化或放射性物質的攻擊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭又指，若就「非法手段」採用狹義詮釋，則以非暴力手段如放火、放毒氣及散播病原體等攻擊政府設施，即使與武力手段造成同等後果，甚至更為嚴重，在《國安法》下也不會被懲治。辯方曾稱可以恐怖活動罪處理，惟法庭指兩者目的非常不同，除非將「非法手段」的意思擴至「極限」（breaking point），否則辯方詮釋會造成法律漏洞（lacuna）及荒謬，會過份地限制《國安法》的範圍，亦因此減低其用作維護國安的有效性，有違立法目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納非法手段僅限刑事罪行-稱可涵蓋違憲行為&quot;&gt;官拒納「非法手段」僅限刑事罪行 稱可涵蓋違憲行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦爭議，「非法手段」應限於刑事罪行，否則會令《國安法》22條範圍過於廣泛和有欠肯定。法庭同樣不接納，認為此詮釋同樣有違《國安法》立法目的。法庭指，立法會運作能被不屬刑事罪行的手段癱瘓，亦「不能想像任何旨在顛覆國家政權的行為或活動，不論其形式及方法，可被視為可接受和可容忍」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭又指，如條文僅限於指刑事罪行，全國人大立法時可列明「刑事手段（criminal means）」，惟最終使用較一般（generic）的字眼，明顯與辯方陳詞相反，指辯方解讀不僅令第22條過份複雜、甚至多餘，亦是要求控方在罪行中證明罪行（prove a crime with a crime），嚴重減低第22條防範和制止危害國安罪行的有效性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭續指，《國安法》中出現了5次「非法」字眼，認為「非法」一詞足夠廣闊，可涵蓋違反憲法（unconstitutional）、違反法律的行為，或其他不跟隨正當程序（not following the proper procedure）而屬一般意義上「非法」的行為；但若採用辯方解讀，則會導致「非法」在《國安法》條文內有不同意思，令條文內部不一致。考慮到《國安法》目的是建立健全維護國安的法律制度和執行機制，及防範顛覆國家政權，因此「非法手段」不限於刑事行為及刑事罪行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於民事過失是否足以構成非法手段，法庭認為無需就此事表達肯定意見，指在本案中，法庭只須指出違反《基本法》是否足以構成非法手段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官毋須證被告知手段屬非法&quot;&gt;官：毋須證被告知手段屬「非法」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於辯方爭議，被告或真誠誤信戴耀廷提倡的手段屬合法，控方須證明被告知悉行為屬非法。法庭也不接納，認為條文中的「非法」只是形容罪行中的犯罪行為（actus reus），而非犯罪意圖（mens rea），就如與13歲以下女童發生性行為罪行，亦無須證明被告案發時知道其行為是非法，否則被告可基於對法律的無知提出辯解。法庭認為，控方無須證明被告知道有關手段屬「非法手段」，但須證明被告作出行為時具意圖「顛覆國家政權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官嚴重干擾破壞政權機關履行職能-足構成顛覆國家政權&quot;&gt;官：嚴重干擾破壞政權機關履行職能 足構成「顛覆國家政權」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;針對控罪提及「旨在顛覆國家政權」，辯方爭議，「顛覆國家政權」沒有清晰定義。法庭認為應按立法目的詮釋，將《辭海》中「政權」的定義，以及《釋義及通則條例》和《基本法》中就「國家」和「權、權力」的定義，應用在《國安法》，認為「國家政權」意指特區政府的各種權力，及政府不同組織例如政府部門所履行的職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「顛覆」，法庭援引《辭海》及《牛津英語辭典》，當中「顛覆」指「顛倒，倒翻，傾敗」、「干擾（disturb）或推翻（overthrow）」、「弱化或破壞（weakening or destruction）」國家或政府等。法庭又引5.22說明，提到各樣針對政府的敵對行為，令香港國安風險「日益突顯」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭認為，考慮到「顛覆」的通常及字面涵義、導致《國安法》制定的社會背景，以及法庭對「國家政權」的理解，認為《國安法》第22條所指「嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能」的行為，足以構成「顛覆國家政權」的行為；而意圖作出相關行為的人，亦必然意圖顛覆國家政權，形容《國安法》第22條是一條「自我定義（self-defining）」的條文，意味意圖干犯條文下行為的人，便會構成顛覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官無差別否決迫政府回應五大訴求-明顯違基本法構成濫權&quot;&gt;官：無差別否決迫政府回應五大訴求 明顯違《基本法》、構成濫權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭就「非法手段」及「顛覆國家政權」的定義作出了其詮釋，那到底被告本案被指無差別否決預算案、濫用《基本法》第73條下的議員職權，是否構成「非法手段」、「顛覆國家政權」？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《基本法》第73條，立法會職權為「根據政府的提案，審核、通過財政預算」。法庭指根據《基本法》第48條、62條及73條，是由政府編制財政預算案，立法會審核，再由行政長官簽署後報中央人民政府備案。法庭認為，立法會議員「顯然集體肩負憲制責任，在需要時依據財政預算案的利弊，對之審核和通過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭續指，雖然立法會不被期望亦不應「自動及機械式地」通過政府提出的議案，但大多數議員蓄意拒絕按預算案的內容與利弊作審核，明顯是違反《基本法》第73條及《國安法》第3條；而如大多數議員計劃無差別否決預算案，以迫使政府答應他們的政治議程，那便會構成濫權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就辯方爭議被告擁有議會特權，法庭不認為適用於本案，指控方是指控被告在當選立法會議員前已達成協議，他們並未享有任何特權；而被告行為違反《基本法》，議會特權明顯不會涵蓋這些公開表明意圖違反憲制責任的立法會議員。法庭又強調，無論如何，議會特權並非絕對特權，又指《國安法》第3條賦予行政、立法及司法機關責任防範、制止和懲治危害國安行為，「有見及此，法庭看不出審訊一宗如本案，即涉及顛覆國家政權指控的案件時，為何不能審視背後的動機或意圖」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官2021年釋義修訂助本案詮釋何謂濫權&quot;&gt;官：2021年《釋義》修訂助本案詮釋何謂「濫權」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭又指，《基本法》第104條要求立法會議員必須宣誓擁護《基本法》，以及宣誓效忠香港特區。雖然政府在2021年5月才於《釋義及通則條例》新增第3AA條，列明「不屬」擁護《基本法》及效忠香港特區的行為，包括「無差別地反對特區政府提出的議案」，意圖要脅或推翻政府等，但法庭認為修例並非新增法例，只是令現行條文更加清晰、鞏固和更清楚解釋以往原則，法庭認為該條文對於本案詮釋什麼構成「濫權」提供了支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭續指，因此無差別否決政府提出的預算案或公共開支，以迫使政府回應五大訴求，一直（all along）都違反《基本法》第73條和104條內擁護《基本法》的規定，「若此等行為具有嚴重破壞政府或行政長官權力和權威的意圖，更不在話下」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官無差別否決必嚴重破壞政權機關履行職能&quot;&gt;官：無差別否決必嚴重破壞政權機關履行職能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就被告被控的串謀罪，法官指，控方須證明被告同意與至少一名共謀者，串謀作出一連串行為，並干犯《國安法》第22條的罪行；而本案所指的行為，就是在2020年立法會選舉取得立會過半，無差別否決預算案，以迫使特首回應五大訴求，特首若拒絕就須解散立法會，並須按《基本法》的機制辭職。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而法庭認為，被告懷涉案犯罪意圖，無差別否決預算案，造成控方指控的「憲制危機」，以迫使特首回應五大訴求，是必然導致「嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞香港特別行政區政權機關依法履行職能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續解釋，就辯方根據《基本法》第50至52條，爭議立法會否決預算案後，特首仍可申請臨時撥款、政府亦可再提出另一個預算案；法官認為若被告協議不按預算案優劣否決，迫使政府回應五大訴求，則不可能批准臨時撥款申請，亦會不顧議案優劣否決第二份預算案。至於特首在立法會被解散時，可按上一財政年度的開支標準批准臨時短期撥款，法官指這代表政府不能推出任何新政策或為改善人民生活增加開支，會嚴重破壞或阻撓特區政權機關履行職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官35不可能非辯護理由&quot;&gt;官：35+不可能非辯護理由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭續指，辯方曾爭議被告案發時相信「35+」不可能，因政府或DQ民主派，或未能在功能組別取得足夠議席，惟法庭認為，此議題只是「事實上不可能」（factual impossibility），而非「法律上不可能」（legal impossibility），考慮到控罪的所有元素，該罪行客觀上不可能成功，不會構成辯護理由，該串謀仍可被納入罪行。不過法庭補充，控方除了須證明被告有意無差別否決，亦要證明他們有意顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xkJvwuJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名組織及參與初選的民主派，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16名不認罪被告中，劉偉聰、李予信2人罪名不成立，其餘14人則罪名成立。就本案事實爭議，法官裁定，戴耀廷是「35+計劃」大腦及主要推手，首先提出立會過半的構想，並提倡運用否決權作手段，迫使特首對五大訴求讓步，若不回應就須辭職；惟法官指，五大訴求實際上不可能，戴終極目標是推翻現行政治制度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，公民黨最初未有決定，但其後改變立場，於3月召記招表明否決所有政府議案，涉案串謀協議最早於2020年3月已存在；其後戴繼續游說協調會議參與者跟隨其理念和目標，並向所有人發協議文件，聲明運用否決權。法官指，所有協調會議參與者均清楚知道計劃目標，而曾對否決權有保留的社民連、民主黨其後也改變立場，在初選提名期結束前，運用否決權已成絕大部分參選人達成的共識。至戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議後，鄒家成等人發起的「墨落無悔」聲明，進一步證明各區已就運用否決權達成協議，並加強參選人基本決心，以宣揚戴的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被指以非法手段犯案-1&quot;&gt;被指以「非法手段」犯案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由3名國安法指定法官陳慶偉、陳仲衡、李運騰頒下的337頁判詞，主要處理法律爭議、整體案情、及各被告案情，本文處理整體案情一部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方於本案指稱各被告達成協議參與一項謀劃，即串謀取得立會過半後，無差別否決預算案，迫使特首解散立法會及辭職，違反《國安法》第22條顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判詞指，就本案的事實裁定，關乎案發時是否有控方指稱的串謀協議存在；以及如有，被告對謀劃是否知情、是否謀劃一分子，及有否意圖顛覆國家政權，並以該意圖參與謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官戴耀廷首先構想爭立會過半&quot;&gt;官：戴耀廷首先構想爭立會過半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就串謀的起始，法官指無爭議在立法會贏取過半數議席的構想，是源於戴耀廷。他2019年12月在《蘋果日報》發表〈立會奪半、走向真普選重要一步〉一文，其想法引起泛民主派的注意；而2019年區選大勝後，民主派開始探討2020年立會選舉取得過半數議席的方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判詞指，2020年1月數名民主派人物的飯局，探討設立協調機制以免浪費選票，戴較堅持舉行初選，構想出「35+計劃」，戴會上亦提及否決預算案和製造「大殺傷力憲制武器」。戴耀廷與區諾軒其後一同籌備計劃，會見不同政黨和人士，判詞形容計劃有兩名組織者，戴作為大腦，區負責協調聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官協議最早於2020年3月存在&quot;&gt;官：協議最早於2020年3月存在&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;判詞指，二人先與公民黨會面，該黨當時尚有猶豫，但於3月25日的記者會完全改變取態，時任黨魁楊岳橋稱若特首不回應五大訴求，「以後每一個法案、財政撥款申請、財委會撥款申請，我哋都會否決，呢個亦都係一個莊嚴嘅承諾」，又指望達成35+，一同否決預算案。法官認為毫無疑問，至少楊岳橋、或譚文豪、郭家麒當天已成為協議一分子，涉案協議最早於2020年3月已存在，否則就是同年6月9日的初選記者會開始。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官35計劃終極目標推翻現行政治制度&quot;&gt;官：「35+計劃」終極目標推翻現行政治制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，戴發表多篇文章宣傳「35+計劃」、及行使否決權作為手段迫使特首對五大訴求讓步，包括〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉及〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉。2020年3及4月時，「35+計劃」的終極目標和用意已非常清晰，戴亦已向公眾表明，就是要利用涉案謀劃破壞、摧毀或推翻香港特區根據《基本法》和「一國兩制」原則，所建立的現行政治制度及體制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官爭立會過半只是手段非目標&quot;&gt;官：爭立會過半只是手段非目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，控方證人區諾軒強調辦初選初心只是爭取立會過半，而「攬炒」則是否決預算案致政府停擺，惟法官不接納，認為基於戴耀廷清楚表明的終極目標，區會知道「35+計劃」就是第一步（starting point），會引起連鎖反應。法官又指，爭取立會過半「只是手段，不是目標」，而區一直知道戴「35+計劃」的目標，不單是取得立會過半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官運用否決權成絕大部分人共識&quot;&gt;官：運用否決權成絕大部分人共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就涉案協議是否存在，控方於本案依賴協調會議及不同文件舉證。法官指，戴出席了所有協調會議，「的確是『35+計劃』的大腦和主要推手」，並信納戴耀廷曾向所有協調會議參與者發放有關「35+計劃」文件，當中列明只有認同五大訴求的人能參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，無爭議各區協調會議後，共有4個項目達成共識，包括辦初選、辦選舉論壇、目標議席數目及替補機制；而它們全屬正式選舉前的實際流程安排、「非政治性」，與如何達成「五大訴求，缺一不可」無甚關係，純粹是盡量增加民主派立會議員數目的機制、與上述「手段」相關。雖然當中不包括「運用否決權」，但法官認為協調過程絕非止於協調會議；又肯定「目標」應是戴耀廷和參與者關心的更重要議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，戴耀廷當然知道不是所有人認同否決預算案，但他繼續努力推廣對他至為重要的理念，毫無疑問，在所有協調會議結束直至提名期完結前，除少數仍有保留及無參與初選的人士外，「運用否決權」已成為絕大部分（vast majority）參選人達成的共識。雖然部分政黨如社民連和民主黨曾表達保留或反對，但他們不知何故（somehow）決定改變立場，戴耀廷亦繼續游說參與者跟隨他的理念和目標。根據所有 WhatsApp 訊息，沒有被告曾明確反對運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官信戴曾向所有人發協議聲明運用否決權&quot;&gt;官：信戴曾向所有人發協議、聲明運用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就協調機制文件，雖然除施德來外的作供被告均稱無收過，但法官指，考慮到戴耀廷曾索取所有協調會議參與者的電話號碼，無理由該文件不會被派發，信納戴在每次會議後均準備摘要並向所有參與者發放。法官又指，在所有由戴製備的協調機制文件中，均清楚說明初選的作用及目的，參與者聲明一旦當選，會「積極運用」或會「運用」《基本法》賦予立法會的權力否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官墨落無悔顯示已達協議否決加強參選人決心&quot;&gt;官：「墨落無悔」顯示已達協議否決、加強參選人決心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，6月9日初選記者會前，戴耀廷曾向所有組織者發訊息，指經過3個月的協調，泛民主派終於達成協議；而戴在當天記者會宣布不要求參選人簽署協議，因不想製造更多人被DQ的風險。法官認為，若協調會議只就上述4項達成共識，看不出有任何理由足以成為DQ的風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，當戴聲明不要求簽署協議時，鄒家成、梁晃維及張可森決定製作「非官方」協議，肯定組織者的決定令較進取的參與人，即使不至於不滿和憤怒，也難免失望。誠如鄒家成所稱，其財政資源緊絀，沒有主流政黨支援，對他來說，抗爭意志及初選敗選者承諾不參選正式選舉，至為重要，法庭肯定上述3人發起「墨落無悔」聲明起源於此。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，聲明內容與各區最終協議相似，無疑是對戴稱毋須簽聲明的回應；而3人曾受訪稱對戴決定失望，若協調會議無就運用否決權達成共識，懷疑3人不會有如此大反應。法官又指，其他被告其後簽署聲明，更進一步支持所有選區已就運用否決權達成協議，而「墨落無悔」與協調協議互相補足，前者是附加機制（additional mechanism），進一步加強參選人宣揚戴耀廷目標的基本決心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官所有參與者均清楚知道計劃目標&quot;&gt;官：所有參與者均清楚知道計劃目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就所有參選被告均提交的提名表格，法官指，戴耀廷非常小心，提名表格僅列出「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」。區諾軒曾稱如有人問及「目標」是什麼，會答是共同綱領，但無人問及，法官認為，所有協調會議參與者均清楚知道（knew perfectly well）計劃目標是什麼。按金收據同樣列明，如違反共識將不發還按金，法官指，可見組織者強調除非該人同意他們的意圖和理念，否則不應前來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，透過參與協調會議、聽戴耀廷說話、收到協調文件、簽署「墨落無悔」和提名表格，所有參與者均知道運用否決權及其目標，所有參與者均成為謀劃的一分子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官戴國安法後稱參選人達協議否決共謀者原則適用&quot;&gt;官：戴《國安法》後稱參選人達協議否決、「共謀者原則」適用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，《國安法》生效後，戴在2020年7月的記者會上提到，「35+計劃」其中一個目標是取得立會過半，運用權力否決預算案，亦提到解散立法會。而在初選後的7月13日記招，戴指參選人將遵守已達成的協議，及承諾運用權力否決預算案；翌日再發帖稱參選人已在協調會議達成否決預算案的協議。法庭認為，「共謀者原則」適用，戴所說的話可用來指證所有被告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官五大訴求實際上不可能&quot;&gt;官：五大訴求實際上不可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;立法會正式選舉最終因疫情延期，法官指若「35+計劃」得以進行，被告意圖造成的後果，是迫使特首對五大訴求讓步，若不回應就得辭職。法官認為不應忽視的是，口號不只是「五大訴求」，而是「五大訴求，缺一不可」，即五項訴求必須俱全；而要求特首下台一直都是訴求之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，五大訴求實際上是不可能的追求，正如區諾軒所指，即使最容易達成的訴求，即成立獨立調查委員會，亦於2019年被時任特首拒絕；而直至現在，除撤回逃犯條例修訂草案外，其他訴求皆不獲回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官戴推想特首下台並非如辯方稱空洞&quot;&gt;官：戴推想特首下台並非如辯方稱空洞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，否決預算案一次本身，並不能達到戴耀廷計劃的終極目標，亦難以形容為「大殺傷力武器」；因此當戴提及否決預算案概念時，毫無疑問他指的是《基本法》第50至52條中整體否決權力及其後果，即解散立法會及特首辭職。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，運用否決權僅為手段，特首因預算案否決兩次後別無他選須辭職，因此戴推想的「攬炒十步」，引申至特首下台的第七步，當中想法「或許並非如辯方所說般空洞（hollow）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官無差別否決造成憲制危機&quot;&gt;官：無差別否決造成憲制危機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，即使特首選擇不解散立法會，但過半民主派仍會否決任何臨時撥款；而即使《基本法》容許特首在立法會被解散時，按上一財政年度開支標準批准臨時短期撥款，這亦代表政府執行任何新政策都必遭嚴重阻礙、基本上都要煞停，「政府及特首的權力和權威會被大大破壞」。法庭套用區諾軒的說法，指這會造成香港的「憲制危機」。&lt;/p&gt;

In Syria, however, its presence has long since evaporated. What went wrong?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wagner Group, a private military company (PMC) funded by the Russian state, deployed to Syria in 2015 and spent six years there. Its role in the country’s conflict was most clearly highlighted by the Battle of Khasham in February 2018, during which a mixed force of Wagnerite mercenaries and Syrian militiamen tried to seize control of an oil field from the US army and its allied militias. The Wagnerites and their allies were badly bruised by a thorough US air and artillery bombardment, and the incident was seen as very puzzling at a time when US-Russian deconflicting arrangements were still fully operational. In fact, the key question about the incident is whether the Russian command in Syria was aware of the Wagnerite plan or not. Wagner’s boss Yevgeny Prigozhin alleged that the Russian command knew, while the latter denied knowledge – hence claims by Prigozhin and his supporters that already at that time a jealous Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) was trying to undermine Wagner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prigozhin’s claims can be interpreted as evidence of friction with the MoD, dating back to the early years of the Wagner Group. The narrative that emerges from both Syrian government and Russian government sources indicates, however, that until 2023, things were not so bad. Even after Prigozhin’s mutiny and subsequent death, Russian diplomatic and military sources rated Russia’s experience with mercenaries in Syria as quite positive. Syrian diplomatic, military and oil and gas industry sources were also adamant that the Russian authorities always defended Wagner against Syrian criticism and blocked Syrian attempts to take existing contracts, especially in the oil and gas sector, away from the group. It was only after the mutiny that the Russian authorities lifted their protection of Wagner and converged with the Syrians in terms of getting Wagnerites to leave the company or indeed the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said this, Syrian sources all agree that they never had the impression that the Russian authorities were involved in Wagner’s expansion beyond the private military business and into oil and gas and related industries. The sources might, of course, have been unaware of Wagner’s arrangements with the Russian authorities, but it seems clear that Prigozhin was not sharing the bulk of his profits with the Kremlin authorities, other than paying some taxes in Russia. Given the shadowy nature of the business, one suspects that the taxes paid were a relatively small amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syrian views of Wagner and its operations in their country are not entirely negative. Wagner’s operations as a commando or shock force were seen as useful, given the shortage of aggressive, combat capable units in the Syrian armed forces and the unwillingness of the Russian MoD to commit regular Russian forces. Syrian businessmen who worked with Prigozhin were also generally happy about the collaboration: the extraordinary profits made by not paying taxes or customs were shared with Syrian business partners, who today describe that time as a bonanza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Wagner’s role in reclaiming control over Syrian oil and gas fields legitimised the exceptionally favourable conditions under which it was able to operate them afterwards&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a period, Prigozhin also took care of keeping the political elites happy. The Assad family was rewarded by contracting companies it controls, for example. Over time, however, the jealousy of the Syrian economic and political elite grew, not least because the oil and gas sector is one of only a few ways to make any money in Syria. Prigozhin, perhaps reassured by the protection he enjoyed from the Russian authorities, did not feel he had to distribute Wagner’s profits beyond a narrow number of Syrian business partners and the minister of oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial justification for Wagner’s entry into the oil and gas sector was of course that it played a key role in reclaiming control over the fields. This legitimised the exceptionally favourable conditions under which Wagner was able to operate them afterwards. By June 2020, however, with the war effectively over, both Syrian powerbrokers, who were not receiving their share, and Syrian officials, who were not seeing any gains for a Syrian state struggling to raise enough revenue to sustain itself, grew critical of Wagner and its privileges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a stark contrast here with the situation that emerged in Mali after Wagner’s 2023 mutiny. In Mali, the Russian government tried to take the contract with the Malian government away from Wagner, but Bamako objected and insisted on keeping Wagner in the country. In the end, a compromise was worked out where 80% of the old contract stayed with Wagner. The Malian government did not want Russian PMC Redut, which is in fact a branch of the MoD, to take over from Wagner. It assessed that Wagner would be a more pliable tool in its hands than Redut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Syria, not only did the government not object to the Russian government’s plans to expel Wagner from the country, but it actively endorsed them. As in Mali, however, the government showed little interest in an expansion of the role of Redut (which already operated in the country in parallel with Wagner). The Russian authorities are still trying to “sell” an expanded Redut role to the Syrians, but the lengthy negotiations demonstrate a distinct lack of enthusiasm on the Syrian side, which would rather do without any Russian private military or security involvement in the oil and gas sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is clear that by and large Russia was never in a position to offer full, pervasive and long-term protection for Wagner across the geographic range of its operations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to suggest that Wagner might only be replaceable by the likes of Redut to a limited extent, because customers do not want the Russian government to have too much say over how mercenaries are used. There are other reasons, too, as to why Wagner is hard to replace. According to senior staff of both Russian and Syrian companies previously operating under Wagner, once the Russian MoD took control of Wagner’s operations in the oil and gas sector, the profitability collapsed. This is not a matter of technical or managerial competence, because the staff have changed little, but of the shadowy business skills that were Prigozhin’s own turf. The Syrian authorities are now demanding that Russian companies in Syria pay taxes and customs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paradox of the Wagner modus operandi in Syria was that it worked because of Prigozhin’s ability to break every rule, but it failed for the same reason. Prigozhin’s “wild capitalist” model was always bound to generate resistance, jealousies and criticism. Only by relying on the protection of the Russian state, which had huge leverage over the Syrian elite in 2015–20, could Prigozhin’s system work. Now the question is whether that model – assuming his son Pavel intends to continue with it – can operate autonomously and still turn out a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Syria, the Prigozhin model was acceptable as long as the situation of extreme crisis allowed for little or no alternatives. Such a situation cannot last forever – it must evolve in one direction or another. Even if the model appears to be still viable for now in Mali and Central Africa, it is clear that by and large Russia was never in a position to offer full, pervasive and long-term protection for Wagner across the geographic range of its operations. Indeed, beyond Syria, the presence of the Russian state alongside Wagner deployments was always much thinner, and typically limited to diplomatic and technical support. This is a key difference between Prigozhin’s business model and that of, say, the British East India Company. Both models are/were driven by extreme rapaciousness, but the East India Company relied on a comparatively much greater ability of the British state to back up the Company’s “investments”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Prigozhin’s model was only really viable for relatively short burst of very intensive profit making. It might well have been designed with that in mind: in Syria, according to sources within Wagner’s financial operation, the organisation earned a war chest that continues to fund Wagner adventures elsewhere. As a venture capitalist, Prigozhin appears to have assumed that several of his operations would result in losses, but expected a few immensely successful ones to cover that and still leave a hefty profit, which might well have been the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the most dramatic types of democratic backsliding, such as coups d’etat, have been on the decline in Latin America, democratic backsliding, in a more insidious way, has taken its place in the form of executive aggrandizement. Executive aggrandizement, according to scholar Nancy Bermeo, is when the executive branch weakens checks and balances by enacting institutional changes that hamper the ability of the opposition to challenge executive preferences. Heads of state who partake in executive aggrandizement are typically electorally popular and therefore justify these changes as carrying out the people’s mandate. Such aggrandizement aims to secure one’s political position and enable the implementation of a political agenda with minimal pushback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case studies of executive aggrandizement in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) include Ecuador’s Rafael Correa from 2007 to 2017, but more recently Mexico has many wondering whether the United States’ neighbor to the south will be effective in insulating its democratic institutions from this trend. The research in this report relies on Bermeo’s definition of executive aggrandizement and creates 16 indicators based on actions that the executive can take to suppress legislative and judicial bodies while simultaneously targeting other institutional sources of accountability, such as a free and independent press, civil society groups, and civilian oversight over defense and security bodies. Of the 16 indicators the authors lay out, Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (colloquially known as AMLO) has exhibited 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-case-of-mexico&quot;&gt;The Case of Mexico&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico has had a tumultuous and complicated history in terms of the abuse of power. The 1917 constitution, crafted to benefit the political elite at the time, provided presidents with “meta-constitutional” and “anti-constitutional” privileges granting them the ability to select and remove elected politicians from office, maintain tight control over financial resources, and directly intervene in the administrative and financial affairs of local and state governments. This led to the exertion of unitary party control by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which heavily concentrated power in the executive branch. To correct this abuse of power, reforms in the 1980s decentralized power by expanding Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies and implementing proportional representation. Additionally, the reforms mandated the creation of the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) — the precursor to the National Electoral Institute (INE) created in 2014 — which was in charge of overseeing and regulating the electoral process. These changes ensured competition in congressional seats and empowered the supreme court to challenge unconstitutional abuses of power. The reforms are credited with Mexico’s multiparty democracy and the historic win of the National Action Party (PAN) in the 2000 general election, followed by a second victory in 2006 and the unprecedented victory of AMLO, the first presidential candidate of the National Regeneration Movement (Morena), in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;amlos-historic-presidency&quot;&gt;AMLO’s Historic Presidency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout his 2018 campaign, then candidate AMLO promised to bring Mexico into its “Fourth Transformation,” aimed at ending corruption, growing the economy, reducing violence, building infrastructure, and expanding social programs designed to reduce poverty and inequality. This follows three historic transformations: Mexico’s War of Independence, the Reform War, and the Mexican Revolution. AMLO’s historic election stood out as the most recent demonstration of the people’s discontent with the status quo of the economy and high levels of corruption, as he became the latest leftist leader in Latin America to be elected on a platform of social reforms seeking to eradicate poverty and inequality, similar to Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and later Colombia’s Gustavo Petro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close to the end of his six-year term, an assessment of AMLO’s policies — measuring their impacts not only on the political, economic, and security situations in Mexico but also on its democratic institutions — suggests that Mexico “appears far more battered and bruised than the Mexico AMLO took the reins of in 2018.” AMLO politicized the office of the attorney general, attempted to curtail the INE’s budget, and has continued to militarize Mexico’s security forces, following in the steps of his predecessors. AMLO sees himself, not Mexico’s congress, as the direct and sole manifestation of the will of the people, and his disregard for checks and balances is troubling. The following sections seek to quantify AMLO’s efforts to centralize power and assess the impacts of these efforts on Mexico’s democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;evaluating-amlos-administration-and-democratic-backsliding-in-mexico&quot;&gt;Evaluating AMLO’s Administration and Democratic Backsliding in Mexico&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Bermeo’s work as a guide, the authors have examined four dimensions of democratic backsliding to assess the situation in Mexico: (1) executive influence over the electoral system, (2) executive influence over the judicial branch, (3) executive encroachment on national and civilian security, and (4) executive undermining of established political liberties. Each dimension contains four indicators that illustrate the different ways in which the executive branch can influence other branches, alter institutions, and centralize power. All dimensions and indicators are highlighted in Table 1, where a checkmark (✓) indicates that AMLO has exhibited this behavior and an x (X) means he has not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Dimensions and Indicators of Democratic Backsliding in Mexico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-influence-over-the-electoral-system&quot;&gt;Executive Influence over the Electoral System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO has consistently voiced his opposition to the INE, an entity which he blames for losing the 2006 and 2012 presidential elections, and he has sought, through budgetary reforms, to significantly reduce the INE’s presence throughout the country. The president has also violated electoral laws by using his platform to campaign for other party members. Of the four indicators in this dimension, AMLO exhibited executive aggrandizement in three: manipulating budget allocations for the electoral system, restricting voter access, and hampering electoral procedures. AMLO has not attempted to place political appointees in positions responsible for electoral oversight, making it the only indicator in this dimension for which there is no evidence of democratic backsliding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;budget-manipulation-related-to-electoral-oversight&quot;&gt;Budget Manipulation Related to Electoral Oversight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO has weakened the electoral system by reducing the INE’s budget by 3.5 billion pesos ($209.6 million). This has affected not only the INE’s staff but also its ability to set up, monitor, protect, and regulate federal, state, and local elections. AMLO declined to provide additional funding to the INE during the 2021 Mexican midterm elections, which significantly delayed results; he has spoken about removing the institute altogether; and he has called for the INE’s director, Lorenzo Córdova, to resign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restriction-of-voter-access&quot;&gt;Restriction of Voter Access&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, a national referendum asking Mexicans whether to investigate former presidents for corruption had a 7 percent voter turnout. Some observers credit such low voter turnout to a reduction in polling stations, which went from the 104,667 originally planned to 56,465, due to budgetary constraints. The referendum, pushed in part by AMLO himself, was estimated to cost around 500 million pesos (around $29 million), equivalent to a third of the INE’s budget that year. Similarly, a referendum seeking to put AMLO’s recall on the ballot in 2022 cost the INE 1.5 billion pesos (around $89 million) and yielded a mere 17 percent voter turnout, potentially due to a reduced number of polling stations. NGOs and domestic organizations criticized both referenda as political exercises by AMLO to increase his popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hampering-of-electoral-procedures&quot;&gt;Hampering of Electoral Procedures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO has also frequently used the presidential platform and podium to publicly and openly campaign for fellow Morena party members while also verbally attacking candidates from other political parties, which is in direct contradiction to the principles stated in the Mexican constitution. Overall, AMLO has not been supportive of the country’s electoral infrastructure, and he has failed to provide additional security and support for poll workers amid Covid-19 and the high rates of violence in many states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-influence-over-the-judicial-branch&quot;&gt;Executive Influence over the Judicial Branch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his campaign promises of accountability and transparency, AMLO has hampered the judicial system for his political benefit and weakened Mexico’s checks and balances in the process. Throughout his term, AMLO has politicized and weaponized the federal judicial system with politically driven investigations and prosecutions. He has made politicized appointments to the supreme court, harassed judges, and threatened political figures with incarceration. AMLO’s actions to advance his personal and political interests have weakened the rule of law and tainted the judicial system with allegations of impunity and widespread corruption. In this dimension, AMLO has exhibited executive aggrandizement in all four indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;appointment-of-ideologically-aligned-or-loyal-judges&quot;&gt;Appointment of Ideologically Aligned or Loyal Judges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO has appointed 4 of the 11 current supreme court justices during his presidency: Loretta Ortiz Ahlf, Juan Luis González Alcántara Carrancá, Yasmín Esquivel Mossa, and Ana Margarita Ríos Farjat. Ortiz Ahlf, before becoming a minister of the supreme court, was a congresswoman for the Labour Party (PT), Morena’s ally in the Mexican legislature. Although she was appointed by López Obrador, Ortiz Ahlf did recuse herself from the hearing on Mexico’s Electricity Industry Law and was prevented from sitting in the corruption case against AMLO’s brother due to concerns over conflicts of interest. In contrast, Esquivel Mossa, a supreme court justice since 2019, granted AMLO’s attorney general a suspension through which she prevented the delivery of the investigation file on his brother to the electoral authorities due to concerns related to human rights violations of his data (AMLO himself would later infringe on these same laws by doxing a New York Times journalist, and when questioned, he argued the law doesn’t apply to the president).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;use-of-executive-decrees-to-restrict-judicial-oversight-of-the-presidency&quot;&gt;Use of Executive Decrees to Restrict Judicial Oversight of the Presidency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of Mexico’s most recent presidents, AMLO has used executive decrees on the widest range of topics. AMLO has recently proposed constitutional reforms that, if passed, would give the executive branch control of the wages, evaluations, and promotion tracks of all judges — even those in the supreme court. The Mexican Bar Association, the Stanford Law School Rule of Law Impact Lab, and the Inter-American Dialogue’s Rule of Law Program strongly condemned the proposed reforms as a threat to judicial independence in a report released this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;blockage-of-investigations&quot;&gt;Blockage of Investigations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the campaign trail, AMLO promised to bring to justice public officials who have relations with drug cartels. However, during his administration, he refused to open an investigation into the former secretary of national defense under Enrique Peña Nieto, Salvador Cienfuegos, who is known to have received bribes from the H-2 Cartel. Additionally, AMLO, who was initially eager to investigate the truth of the Iguala mass kidnapping in 2014, has instead allowed multiple investigations under the “truth commission” he created to stall. AMLO has therefore shielded key military officers from being held accountable and has been criticized by the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts for hampering domestic and international efforts to uncover connections between government officials, cartels, and the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;harassment-or-removal-of-judges&quot;&gt;Harassment or Removal of Judges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and the international community have harshly criticized AMLO for using the attorney general’s office to harass and prosecute political opponents. For example, the López Obrador administration’s Financial Intelligence Unit allegedly harassed former supreme court justice Eduardo Medina Mora, leading to his subsequent resignation. After Mora’s resignation, AMLO filled the vacancy with his desired appointee, Margarita Ríos Farjat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-encroachment-on-national-and-civilian-security&quot;&gt;Executive Encroachment on National and Civilian Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO has rhetorically adopted a policy of nonviolence toward Mexico’s diversified criminal groups, a policy he dubbed abrazos no balazos (“hugs not bullets”). In actuality, however, he has continued to militarize the security forces and has vested them with expanded powers. A 2021 report by the Center for Investigations and Economics (CIDE) found that between 2006 and 2021 more than 245 governmental functions had been transferred from civilian authorities to the Mexican armed forces. Furthermore, the creation of the national guard, accompanied by a refusal to transfer the body to civilian control, heralds what experts have called “new militarism,” that is, the normalization of expanded roles of the military and of the handover of civil matters to the military. Lastly, while a 2023 investigation revealed that Mexico was the first country to use Pegasus spyware during the Peña Nieto administration, there is little evidence to suggest that AMLO has significantly expanded the surveillance capabilities of the state. Based on this assessment, AMLO has exhibited executive aggrandizement in three out of four indicators in this dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;transfer-of-resources-to-the-military&quot;&gt;Transfer of Resources to the Military&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While an increase in the national security budgets is a common policy decision, especially amid security crises, the López Obrador administration has transferred functions that typically fall under the purview of other government departments to the military and, in particular, to the newly minted national guard. According to reports, AMLO has transferred 15 state companies, and arguably their proceeds, to military management, including Mexico City’s two airports, a new airline, and the new Tren Maya. Throughout his presidency, López Obrador has approved the expansion of the military’s budget by 150 percent, primarily to absorb the costs of such projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expansion-of-institutional-impunity&quot;&gt;Expansion of Institutional Impunity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO has sought to expand the role of the military in Mexico without providing safeguards to prevent the abuse of power. In 2020, Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero, with the president’s backing, proposed a judicial reform plan that would allow suspects to be detained without charges for up to 40 days and would decrease the number of judges needed to monitor defendants’ rights. While AMLO later withdrew his support for the plan, his administration has failed to implement crucial accountability mechanisms under the Organic Law of the Attorney General of the Republic. Manero has allowed the expedited appointment of legal officials and experts without the approval of congress and civilian committees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;militarization-of-civilian-security-forces&quot;&gt;Militarization of Civilian Security Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though AMLO initially claimed he would not use the military under his administration, he has deployed the military to drug-related operations and civilian security tasks since 2019, including for supporting the construction of certain projects, securing ports of entry, building banks to disperse social programs to the elderly and the poor, stopping illegal immigrants, policing large public areas, guiding traffic, and dispersing demonstrations. Furthermore, AMLO has resisted calls to hand over control of the national guard to a civilian. It is currently under the jurisdiction of the Secretariat of Security and Civil Protection despite earlier attempts to transfer it to the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national guard has been widely condemned for its use of tear gas on innocent protesters and asylum seekers from Guatemala. To make matters worse, between January 1 and August 17, 2022, the National Human Rights Commission (CDNH) registered around 32 complaints of torture and 94 complaints of arbitrary detention, 43 of which were against the national guard. Moreover, over the same time period, the CDNH received an additional 120 complaints of inhumane treatment that were committed by the national guard and other related government entities, including the Secretariat of Security, the attorney general’s office, SEDENA, and the National Migration Institute. In 2020, the CDNH also received complaints about forced disappearances, inhumane treatment, and arbitrary detention. In April 2020, photos circulated on social media of members of the national guard eating with cartel members, and a video surfaced in early May that year of the national guard extorting citizens in Sonora, further augmenting concerns about the force’s abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-undermining-of-established-political-liberties&quot;&gt;Executive Undermining of Established Political Liberties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO not only has failed to protect journalists but also has attacked the press and independent organizations and defunded independent agencies that seek to protect civil liberties. AMLO has also sponsored and promoted laws that harshly repress demonstrations and has routinely used the national guard to repress civilian protests. Overall, AMLO has contradicted himself in declaring himself a champion of the people while simultaneously being punitive toward citizens and civil society. In this dimension, AMLO has exhibited executive aggrandizement in all four indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;attacks-on-the-media&quot;&gt;Attacks on the Media&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO’s presidency has been characterized by the establishment of a daily press briefing, also known as the “Mañanera,” an hours-long daily briefing that the president has instituted in the name of transparency. However, AMLO most often uses this platform to respond to negative coverage of his administration, oftentimes by attacking or doxing journalists who publish negative stories about him. During his six-year term, he disclosed the income of journalist Carlos Loret de Mola and the phone number of New York Times reporter Natalie Kitroeff, and has referred to journalists as “thugs,” putting journalists in acute danger. Mexico has been one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, including active warzones, with around 37 journalists killed during AMLO’s term alone. With little political appetite for extended protections, journalists continue to suffer not only verbal attacks by the president but also physical violence with no end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;encroachment-on-civilian-privacy-through-surveillance&quot;&gt;Encroachment on Civilian Privacy through Surveillance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a report by the New York Times, Mexico was the first country to deploy Pegasus, during the Calderón administration. While AMLO has also openly criticized the use of spyware by the Calderón administration, there is no evidence that he is has stopped its use. In fact, during his six-year term, the armed forces deployed the software on human rights defender, Raymundo Ramos, accusing him of seeking to “discredit the armed forces.” Raymundo was in fact, investigating an unlawful killing by the military that took place in Nuevo Laredo when his phone was infected. Two other cases, both undertaken by the armed forces, are salient during AMLO’s presidency: the surveillance of Alejandro Encinas, Mexico’s undersecretary for human rights, and constant monitoring of over 15 feminist groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interference-with-political-actors-and-others-in-opposition&quot;&gt;Interference with Political Actors and Others in Opposition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the Mexican presidential election, AMLO has continuously attacked candidate Xóchitl Gálvez, thus breaking with long-standing tradition of Mexican presidents not commenting on candidates in the presidential race. AMLO has also used his attorney general’s office to threaten to incarcerate more than two dozen professors and scientists for alleged money laundering and organized crime charges, which were quickly shot down in court due to a lack of evidence. AMLO has also used lower federal courts and tax authorities as well as financial crime units to harass political opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;repression-of-protests-and-demonstrations&quot;&gt;Repression of Protests and Demonstrations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMLO, ironically, became popular for protesting Pemex operations in the early years of his political career. Now, AMLO is supportive of punitive laws that increase pretrial detention and tougher penalties for those who are arrested during protests and demonstrations. In July 2019, AMLO and Morena Party members proposed legislation that would permit prison sentences of up to 20 years for obstructing access to business and 13 years for blocking progress on public works projects. AMLO has also used the national guard to disperse crowds and protests, an institution that in its young tenure has already faced complaints of excessive use of force, abuse, and even torture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-uncertain-future-for-mexico&quot;&gt;An Uncertain Future for Mexico&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 5, 2024, Mexico’s Constitution Day, AMLO proposed 20 new political changes, 18 of which require changes to the constitution, with the remaining two seen as legal reforms. Key changes include a reduction in the number of seats in Mexico’s national legislature, and a reform to elect judges by popular vote. While the proposed reforms are currently being reviewed in the lower house of congress, it is important to note that AMLO’s party, Morena, does not have the necessary two-thirds majority in both chambers to pass them. Many fear that, should Morena win a supermajority in both houses and the presidency, AMLO’s legacy of executive aggrandizement and democratic backsliding will continue even after he leaves office. Considering Latin America’s history of democratic backsliding through executive aggrandizement, the question of how countries can best safeguard institutions and maintain checks and balances is one Mexico must grapple with should it wish to continue to be considered a robust democracy in the hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案將於今（5月30日）早裁決，有市民在西九龍裁判法院外通宵排隊。據《獨媒》現場觀察，晚上11時半已有逾35人在庭外排隊。排在隊伍較前位置有被告劉偉聰的朋友，不久前出獄的他認為有需要到場旁聽，又表示「呢啲共業嚟，一齊承受」。「女長毛」雷玉蓮則帶同平安包到場，希望各被告能「平安大吉，大步檻過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，由隊伍中段開始，近30名排隊人士均戴上口罩及帽，部分人背向街道而坐。記者上前逐一詢問有關排隊目的、聽審內容、是否「有錢收」等，惟他們均拒絕回答記者提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;兩人與劉偉聰相識-望為47人打氣&quot;&gt;兩人與劉偉聰相識 望為47人打氣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳先生（化名）昨晚約8時半已到達現場，是被告劉偉聰的朋友，稱放工後便到場排隊。他表示有傳訊息給劉表達關心，考慮到今日可能是最後機會看到被告，希望到場為他們打氣，並拍下被告的照片，「始終在公在私都想送佢一程，可能真係聽日 bye bye。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳先生上月剛出獄，坦言擔心會被警員監視，但認為裁決需要到場旁聽。他表示在獄中一直有留意47人案的消息，「咁嘅時勢冇擔心，呢啲共業嚟，一齊承受。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳先生在現場偶遇同樣剛出獄的朋友加入隊伍。該名朋友表示知道有關案件內容，關注3名指定法官理解案件的邏輯，以及他們如何回應辯方的論點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同樣是劉偉聰朋友的 Mark 同樣排在隊伍較前。Mark 指，看到審訊過程覺得生氣、無奈，「因為嬲，心唔舒服，傷心」，所以來支持被告，希望最好「聽日一齊走呀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「女長毛」雷玉蓮因擔心排隊黨再度出現，所以昨晚約9時帶同平安包和平安飾物到場。她笑言，希望能過法庭安檢，令庭上讓被告看到，祝願「平安大吉，大步檻過」。蓮姐稱之前因工作而無法旁聽，但認為判決很重要，所以今次請假兩天到場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;雷玉蓮亦表示，對每一位被告都十分留意，包括戰友「長毛」梁國雄。她認為今次案件很大規模，如何判決都會引起社會很多關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;外號「姨婆」的69歲旁聽師昨日下午6時許已擺放折凳在隊頭。她表示常常旁聽47人案審訊，形容被告何桂藍供詞「非常銳利」。她又指，最近的英國《國安法》案件容許所有被告保釋，相比之下香港令人感覺「肉酸」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今早迎來裁決，日前被指涉嫌利用「某個將至的敏感日子」前持續發布煽動帖文，違反《維護國家安全條例》，於本周二被捕的牙醫李盈姿，在昨晚約11時獲准保釋後，梳洗過後，今早約4時到庭外排隊等候聽審，「橫掂都無瞓，就不如出嚟啦，同埋都想報吓平安、見吓大家。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李盈姿認為，初選47人案無實質證據指控，「好唔公平、好離譜。」她預計能入正庭聽審，但如若有親友需要輪候籌，會不介意讓出。她坦言對裁決不感樂觀，寄語各人「我們喺外面等你哋」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《獨媒》通宵在庭外守候，日出之後排隊人數明顯增加，而且多是身穿「街坊裝」，有身穿黑「莊tee」的排隊校媒成員被警員查身份證。截至早上7時半，已有約70人在排隊等候聽審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信好友作為朋友盡一份力有得陪就陪&quot;&gt;李予信好友：作為朋友盡一份力，有得陪就陪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中一名被告李予信的朋友 Stanley，今早6時便到場排隊。他提及李在被檢控後，仍有不時曝光，「佢從一而終咁實踐自由意志，呢點我係 respect 嘅。」他自言已做好心理準備，「無理由我哋喺出面仲預備得差過佢」，希望能陪對方一同面對，「作為朋友都盡一份力，有得陪就陪。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;有曾排隊聽審學生今早自發到場派糧食&quot;&gt;有曾排隊聽審學生今早自發到場派糧食&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;家在法院附近的港大法律系二年級生 Keith（化名），坦言「做到嘅真係無乜」，但因在去年2月亦曾排隊聽審。他指排隊人士會感肚餓，故今早清晨帶同食水及餅乾等食糧到場，派發予通宵等候的排隊人士。他稱一直有了解案情，認為辯方「拗嘅有point」，惟最終判決仍取決於法院，估計辯方勝算機會較微。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/U6YmoEw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;科大編委成員 Richard 今早亦有到場排隊，坦言對裁決不感樂觀。他打算報道案件，以引起學生關注。身穿科大編委的「莊tee」的 Richard，在接受訪問期間一度有警員上前打斷，被要求查其身份證。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信的朋友 Wendy 昨凌晨3時半已到場排隊，打算進入正庭親身鼓勵李，「起碼可以真人望到佢」，但未知能否拿飛進入正庭。Wendy 表示以泰然及平穩的態度面對裁決，並會與李共同面對結果，因兩人相信堅持理念是最重要。Wendy 表示，裁決前兩人分別撰寫信件給對方，以表達內心說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wendy 認為，李的信念堅定，即使面對制肘仍然在不同方面追求進步，並對李的所有決定有信心及會支持。她認為最重要的是清楚自己所追求的。Wendy 指，在審訊期間面對着更多挑戰，她一早已經預計結果，會為不同情況作好準備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「獵人書店」店長黃文萱於約早上8時到場排隊，表示想親身見證裁決，亦想「陪下大家」。她指審訊過程漫長，現時心情複雜，對於結果不太樂觀，只希望能還被告公義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前立法會議員邵家臻亦到場，他表示對結果「唔敢樂觀」，不停提醒自己要沉着面對結果、控罪、判刑、或往後日子。被問到有什麼想跟47人說，邵僅表示：「唔使怕，我哋有彼此。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選47人案今早裁決，一眾獲准保釋的被告今早先後到達法西九龍法院。被告之一、本身是大律師的劉偉聰，他在進入法庭前接受傳媒訪問，他對記者表示：「多謝大家關心，希望大家繼續關注，後會有期。」社民連定今早在法院外示威，但主席陳寶瑩及成員曾健成等人，卻在請願前遭警方帶至遠離法院的行人路調查。陳寶瑩認為警方做法不能接受，稱今早原定只有四名成員簡單表達意見，卻遭剝奪權利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聆訊今早10時開始，李予信最早到達，他在8時58分便到達法庭，他穿上老虎圖案的藍色恤衫，並配戴了金鏈，特地在法院門外停下讓記者拍照。另一被告柯耀林則在9時01分到達。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其他被告及後陸續進入法院，鄭達鴻與女友手拖手進入法庭，劉偉聰在進入法庭前對記者表示：「多謝大家關心，希望大家繼續關注，後會有期。」曾因旺角騷亂案入獄的盧建民亦有到場，他更特地為劉偉聰拍照，後者曾擔任盧建民的代表律師。施德來亦與妻子拖手抵達，何啟明則向記者揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早上約8時30分，一名身穿深藍風衣、黑色衫褲、攜黑色袋的女士在西九龍法院大樓地下，被約5至6名警員截查，搜查其隨身物品。她向記者表示，昨晚到場時排在隊伍頭10人以內，惟在步入法庭時便手勢後，隨即被警員帶到法院大樓地下近升降機位置截查。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;她指警員向她稱「你都知而家敏感日子，無謂要上頭做嘢，呢啲嘢唔好講喇」，另有國安警員口頭警誡她剛才行為已涉意圖煽動，如有相同情況會立即拘捕。警員其後要求她直接離開法院重新排隊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名組織及參與初選的民主派，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（30日）於西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）裁決。3名國安法指定法官今早裁定，16名不認罪被告中，劉偉聰、李予信2人罪名不成立，其餘14人，包括鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、黃碧雲、施德來、何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄、柯耀林、余慧明及吳政亨，均罪名成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示，擬按《刑事訴訟程序條例》第81DB，提出上訴，並要求法庭維持二人保釋狀態直至下午2時半再開庭。其餘罪成被告則須即時還柙。該條例為政府去年修訂，就沒有陪審團的高院國安案，若有被告罪脫，律政司可「緊接」提出擬上訴，法庭可應申請，命令無罪被告還柙或准予保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信聞判後表現平靜，微微戚眉和搖頭望向女友。劉偉聰獲悉結果後與律師相擁痛哭。柯耀林聞結果後「O嘴」驚訝，鄒家成則平靜望向旁聽人士。鄭達鴻一直望向旁聽親友。彭卓棋向李予信舉拇指，李點頭回應。梁國雄用手摸頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信步出被告欄時右手撫胸向其他被告點頭，劉偉聰步出庭時，獲旁聽人士握手祝願，並著他保重。劉的親友與他擁抱時不禁落淚，但劉未就結果發表感受。他只是說：「多謝大家關心，繼續關心其他人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;罪成被告均須還柙，離開時林卓廷向親友微笑，彭卓棋飛吻和揮手，鄒家成揮手，柯耀林舉交叉手勢。有旁聽親友見被告被押走時拭淚。黃碧雲透過玻璃向親友微笑揮手。楊雪盈步入囚室時向父親說：「睇住啲貓呀爸爸，你同貓都要平安呀！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;各被告於9時45分起陸續進入被告欄，欄內氣氛頗為輕鬆，黃碧雲與柯耀林交談一會，楊雪盈則向親友微笑後步入，又在欄內雙手放頭做兔仔手勢。李予信一度向女友揮手及舉出拳頭手勢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於還柙中的被告，何桂藍束起頭髮、手持文件出庭。林卓廷穿西裝出庭，鄒家成向公眾揮手。旁聽人士站起揮手時，法庭職員大喊：「麻煩公眾人士唔好揮手！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;開庭前，各被告在庭外與親友道別，劉偉聰搭着陳志全肩膊，有朋友上前與劉握手說：「我哋晏啲去飲嘢」，劉微笑不語；鄭達鴻與其代表大律師潘熙握手，又與彭卓棋交談。楊雪盈則與親友相擁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰表示自己並非焦點-冀公眾關注其他人&quot;&gt;劉偉聰表示自己並非焦點 冀公眾關注其他人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰步出庭時，獲旁聽人士握手祝願，並著他保重。劉的親友與他擁抱時不禁落淚，但劉未就結果發表感受。他只是說：「多謝大家關心，繼續關心其他人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉步出法院時被記者包圍，警方隨即阻止記者，並由數名警員「護送」劉過馬路。劉向記者指，自己並非是日裁決的焦點，他冀公眾繼續關注其他人，以及詳細閱讀判詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信離開法庭時表示「多謝大家關心」，他指因現時律政司表示可能會上訴，所以現階段「唔可以 comment 任何嘢」，心情「都係一樣，冇乜特別」，被問得悉其他被告罪成的感受，他神情凝重指：「大家明白，我都好難講太多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信向記者豎起拇指，又右手輕拍胸口。多名記者上前包圍拍攝，警方隨即陪同李離開，逾20名警員一度築起人鏈阻隔記者，又拉着記者背包要求移開。李向記者表示，「我講嘅嘢唔多，多謝大家咁多年嘅關心，我哋係睇到同感受到大家嘅愛。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到會否擔心律政司上訴需即時還押，李僅回應現階段不能評論或表達意見，他指現時心情平和，只想與家人見面：「我宜家只係想同屋企人飲下茶，因為我仲未見到屋企人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;胡志偉聞畢裁決後，神色凝重；梁晃維、伍健偉、李嘉達、馮達浚四人則低頭交談；黃之鋒不時望向觀眾席。除了徐子見外，其餘七人離開時均有向觀眾席揮手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官今早宣布裁決結果後，押後至下午再開庭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;下午開庭前，罪脫的李予信坐在被告欄外，劉偉聰則繼續坐在律師席。至於罪成的14被告，各人精神不俗，林卓廷向公眾席微笑點頭，並向親友做手勢，示意「我OK」；黃碧雲、何啟明均微笑揮手；楊雪盈束了低馬尾，向親友點頭和展露燦爛微笑，又做心形手勢；施德來穿上風衣，雙手合十抱拳。陳志全戴上了眼鏡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，刑事檢控專員楊美琪表示，擬根據《刑事訴訟程序條例》第81DB條，就兩名無罪被告以「案件呈述」方式上訴，並望維持二人原有的保釋條件，以待上訴。劉偉聰沒有反對，代表李予信的大律師關文渭則表示反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭陳詞後，法庭押後考慮，終下令二人續准以原有條件繼續保釋，包括不得離港，不得直接或間接以任何方式發放或作出任何可能被視為危害國安的言論和行為等，但警署報到次數則由每周一次減為一個月一次，李予信亦獲撤銷人事擔保10萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;暫定625求情&quot;&gt;暫定6.25求情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續宣布，就本案求情暫定於6月25日開始進行，求情陳詞不可多於20頁，需於求情前14天呈交。代表彭卓棋的大律師盧敏儀其後為彭申請保釋候判遭拒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告當中，只有劉偉聰及李予信罪脫。就劉偉聰，法官指他並沒有在競選活動中，主張否決預算案及迫使政府回應五大訴求。而就劉早前稱無簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，法官認為，即使劉的名字出現在聲明中，但不能確定是他親自簽署，或是授權他人簽署；亦接受劉稱，他發現自己名字出現在聲明時，處於進退兩難的局面，若然他將名字刪除或作出澄清，在當時的政治氣氛而言，等同於「政治自殺」。法官認為，無法從證據獲得唯一合理的推論，來指出劉同意涉案謀劃，亦不肯定他在任何階段有顛覆國家政權的意圖，因此裁定他罪脫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官劉沒有在政綱提及否決財案&quot;&gt;官：劉沒有在政綱提及否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官於判詞指，實際上劉並沒有在選舉政綱或競選活動中，主張否決預算案及迫使政府回應五大訴求，因此有理由懷疑劉是否同意無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官不能確定劉親自簽聲明或授權他人&quot;&gt;官：不能確定劉親自簽聲明或授權他人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉早前稱並非他親自簽署「墨落無悔」聲明。法官認為，即使劉的名字出現在聲明中，但不能確定是他親自簽署，或是授權他人簽署。雖然控方認為，劉未能就為何名字會在聲明出現作出令人相信的解釋，但法官肯定，若然劉的員工因知道他將會參選故將其名字貼在聲明裏，而員工卻表示不知誰負責，那劉就只能作出上述解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官接受劉所稱，他發現自己名字出現在聲明時，處於進退兩難（catch-22）的局面。若然他將名字刪除或作出澄清，在當時的政治氣氛而言，就等同於「政治自殺」。劉並沒有將聲明張貼在自己 Facebook，亦無在選舉工程中運用聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在選舉論壇上，劉問何啟明為何首先簽署聲明，但法官同意他這樣問，是希望對方能夠在論壇上顯示大放異彩；而這個提問確實沒有透露出劉對聲明的立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官接受劉稱沒有使用fb-員工負責專頁及初選群組&quot;&gt;官接受劉稱沒有使用FB 員工負責專頁及初選群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官接受劉所指，他並非 Facebook 用戶，而關於區議會工作的專頁是由其員工操作。對於劉表示只會在工作時使用 Facebook，法官看不出有何不合理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦接受劉所指，他並非 WhatsApp 使用者，他只會用 iMessage，但法官指，這不代表他沒有留意到其義工屬於九西 WhatsApp 群組一員。法官續指，能夠確定劉有透過義工等人收到初選的協調文件，並已閱讀內容，但該義工並沒有在群組直接提及「五大訴求」或否決預算案，只是問及初選安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官接受劉參與首次九西協調會議後，並沒有再留意大部分與初選有關的後勤更新。法官亦接受劉所指，他沒有閱讀《蘋果日報》、戴耀廷的文章或 Facebook 帖文、或其他泛民參選人的最新發展。劉在參與初選前，並沒有充分理由去留意相關資訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，無法從證據獲得唯一合理的推論，劉同意涉案謀劃，亦不肯定他在任何階段有顛覆國家政權的意圖，因此裁定他罪脫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告當中，只有劉偉聰及李予信罪脫。就李予信，法官接納他是黨內新人和低級成員，直至2020年5月底仍無意參與初選，也沒有參與超區協調會議，是在6月13日才被公民黨徵召出選；而公民黨於6月11日簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，但李當時尚未參選，法官接納他對公民黨內部討論應否簽署不知情，控方未能證明他同意作為聲明的聯署人。法官又指，李在論壇或 Facebook 均沒有提及利用否決權迫政府回應「五大訴求」，無法確定李是謀劃的一份子，亦不能肯定他有意圖顛覆國家政權，因此裁定他罪脫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官接納李中途才獲公民黨徵召參與初選&quot;&gt;官接納李中途才獲公民黨「徵召」參與初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李予信一方爭議，即使他曾經參與涉案協議，但在《國安法》生效前已經退出。就李予信參與初選的時間，法官接納，李沒有參加公民黨記招前的籌備會議，對此一無所知，亦沒有人將細節告知他。法官亦接納，直至2020年5月底，李亦無意參與初選，也沒有參與戴耀廷等人舉辦的協調會議。而李是在2020年6月初公民黨開始「徵召機制」後，才表示對出選有興趣。直至2020年6月13日，他因6.12一周年示威案獲保釋後，在公民黨副主席賴仁彪要求下才參與初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官公民黨簽署墨落無悔聲明時-李尚未參選&quot;&gt;官：公民黨簽署「墨落無悔」聲明時 李尚未參選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，區諾軒稱李曾出席5月協調會的說法並不可靠，因當時李尚未成為候選人，他亦不會收到戴耀廷發送的協調文件。法官又指，公民黨於2020年6月11日簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，但李尚未參選，接納他與公民黨簽聲明一事無關，對公民黨就聲明的內部討論不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指李作為黨員必然同意聲明-官論點沒有說服力&quot;&gt;控方指李作為黨員必然同意聲明 官：論點沒有說服力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就控方強調，李必然知道公民黨認同聲明，因此他作為黨的一份子，必然也會同意。惟法官反駁，上述論點沒有說服力，相反，法官認為控方未能證明李同意作為聲明的聯署人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官李沒有提及否決或五大訴求&quot;&gt;官：李沒有提及「否決」或「五大訴求」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，雖然李在提名表格上簽署，當中同意並支持謀劃，但他沒有出席唯一一次的協調會議。另外，即使李於3月在 Facebook 上轉發公民黨關於「議會過半 反制政府」的帖文，但他當時尚未成為候選人。法官又指，沒有足夠證據證明，李事先知道公民黨其他代表將在記者會上發表甚麼言論，李就否決權方面亦沒有發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方強調，另一成員鄭達鴻在6月23日在 Facebook 表示，將與其他成員使用否決財案等手段，以實現五大訴求。而李是鄭專頁的追蹤者之一，因此他會同意其言論。然而，法官不認為上述推論是強而有力，因為選擇追蹤 Facebook 可出於多種原因。法官留意到，李即使與鄭參與同一街站活動，但他卻沒有在 Facebook 帖文提及「否決」或「五大訴求」的相關字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官李明顯採用公民黨所有候選人的範本&quot;&gt;官：李明顯採用公民黨所有候選人的範本&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，李的政綱明顯是基於公民黨所有候選人使用的範本，而李較遲才參與初選的競選活動。對於李是否有選擇，還是只可採用其他人的範本，法官抱有保留態度。另外，當李看過《國安法》後，他立即通知黨員停止派發舊單張，並設計一款沒有提及「五大訴求」的新單張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官也留意到，李在選舉論壇中並沒有提及利用否決權迫使政府回應「五大訴求」。法官指，由於李是黨內新人，在公民黨的地位較低；若他無法獲得黨的支持，就別無選擇，只能退出選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官最後指，無法確定李是謀劃的一份子，亦不能肯定他有意圖顛覆國家政權，因此裁定他罪脫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告當中，自行發起「三投三不投」、並非初選候選人的吳政亨，被判罪成。法官指，吳與戴耀廷就初選事宜頻繁交流，即使「三投三不投」可能是吳自行發起，但他並非單獨行事，肯定吳在《國安法》前，已與戴同意推行涉案謀劃並有意實施。法官又指，雖然其他參加者不知道吳的參與，但吳知道有其他候選人，亦知道他做的事情已超出與戴的往來範圍，他自願並有意確保只有初選勝出者才能參與立法會選舉，協助民主派取得大多數議席，否決預算案迫特首回應五大訴求，令特首下台。法官認為，吳與戴之間的協議，跟戴和其他人之間的協議是相同；而吳擁抱「攬炒」概念，《國安法》生效後仍繼續懷有顛覆政權的意圖，因此裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9VsFhFT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image34&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官吳無出席會議-但知道及同意運用否決權&quot;&gt;官：吳無出席會議 但知道及同意運用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;審訊期間透露，吳政亨曾發起「三投三不投」，他並非初選的候選人，並選擇不作供。法官指，吳清楚知道35+計劃的目標，是要運用否決權，迫使特首回應「五大訴求」，雖然他沒有出席任何協調會議、也不是候選人，但證據顯示他清楚知道五個地方選區的協議中，包含「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權，因他曾在 Facebook 發布相關帖文。此外，吳在訪問中明確表示知道民主黨沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，顯示他知道聲明內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為吳是同意涉案謀劃，並逐一列出原因，包括吳並不反對否決所有議案這個想法；雖然他提及在初選與「墨落無悔」聲明之間，會選擇前者，但不代表他不同意涉案謀劃，這只顯示他認為取得35+是可行策略的基礎。此外，吳得悉選區協調會議有共識「會運用」或「會積極運用」否決權後，形容這是「好消息」；他又對於有人願意簽署「墨落無悔」聲明表示高興。法官認為，若然吳不同意聲明，就不會覺得高興。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;吳發文同意攬炒官不能詮釋為選舉言論&quot;&gt;吳發文同意「攬炒」官：不能詮釋為「選舉言論」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，警方在吳政亨的電腦上發現他用筆名「李伯盧」撰寫的文章，當中提及「在中共這強大敵人面前，我們不單要做『攬炒行動者』……要議會攬炒，首要條件是人數過半，35+」。法官認為由此可見，吳同意那些擁抱「攬炒」概念的人，即若政府拒絕回應訴求，就會破壞其職能。而吳和其他擁抱「攬炒」的人，兩者分別只在於優先順序及策略。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，吳在網上將中共形容為「不擇手段的對手」，並呼籲選民抵抗及戰鬥；他亦強調初選目的是「踢走共產黨」。另外，吳轉發文章並同意戴耀廷所說，取得立法會多數議席後，需運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，考慮上述證據後，發現吳在網上的言論，不能單單以「選舉言論」來解釋。唯一合理推論是吳實際上同意民主派一旦進入立法會，就會履行謀劃並採取行動對抗政府及共產黨。至於吳在訪問中聲稱對否決預算案等保持中立的說法，僅是未經盤問的開脫性言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，只要吳同意戴耀廷懷有必要意圖進行謀劃，控方即可證明對吳的指控。若上述能夠被證明，那麼其他共謀者是否知道吳的參與，則不重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，吳與戴除了在案發期間使用 WhatsApp 頻繁溝通初選事宜外，還有電話交流及親身會面。吳對於戴為香港的付出表示感謝，並提出會盡力幫忙，又表達希望初選能夠成功。其後，吳向戴發出宣傳初選的文件，戴回應指兩人想法很接近。直至5月，雖然吳沒有參與任何協調會議，但戴仍然向吳匯報會上內容。吳又告知戴自己將會撰寫公開信件，呼籲選民不要投票予未能遵守協議的候選人，最後吳將草稿傳給戴，並獲其同意及使用。直至《國安法》頒佈後，吳告知戴他已放置頭版廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，吳一直了解並同意謀劃，唯一合理推論是他並非單獨行事。即使「三投三不投」的計劃可能是吳自行發起，但能夠確定的是，吳在2020年7月1日即《國安法》實施前，已經與戴有協議實行涉案謀劃，其後繼續提供積極幫助。而儘管35+計劃其他參加者並不知道吳的參與，但吳知道還有其他候選人參與，亦知道他做的事情已超出與戴的往來範圍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，吳自願並有意圖，繼續採取行動確保只有初選勝出者才能參與立法會選舉，協助民主派取得大多數議席；又指毫無疑問，吳知道謀劃目標是否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應「五大訴求」。法官肯定吳有意實施謀劃，並充分意識到謀劃結果是兩次解散立法會、令特首下台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;基於上述，法官認為吳與戴之間的協議，跟戴和其他人之間的協議是相同；而吳擁抱「攬炒」概念，懷有顛覆意圖。法官並指，不論是《國安法》生效前後，吳亦屬協議一份子；即使在《國安法》生效後，吳仍對與戴執行謀劃的協議知情，繼續懷有顛覆政權的意圖，並執行謀劃中屬於他自己的部分。法官考慮上述因素後，裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告當中，共有14人罪成，部分被告任立法會議員多年，包括民主黨的黃碧雲及林卓廷、社民連的梁國雄。法官指，以他們任立法會議員及政治人物的豐富經驗，其中黃碧雲一定知道政府永遠不會同意落實「五大訴求」，而上述被告亦會知道否決財政預算案將帶來嚴重後果，令政府運作癱瘓。而雖然黃碧雲及梁國雄在初選中落敗，並沒有參選，但兩人仍表明支持獲勝團隊爭取35+。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃曾派代表出席兩次協調會議，當中戴耀廷提及〈真攬炒十步〉一文。警方在黃的電腦內，找到九西的最終協調文件，因此法官確信黃當時收到並曾閱讀文件，文件內列明當選者將否決財政預算案。另外，電腦內亦有民主黨的帖文截圖，內容表示民主黨會尊重及遵守協調機制。法官相信，黃提交提名表格的時候，必定注意到民主黨會遵守協議。此外，黃屬於九西訊息發佈區的成員之一，因此可以肯定黃知道計劃目的包括無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官黃任議員經驗豐富必然知道政府不會同意五大訴求&quot;&gt;官：黃任議員經驗豐富、必然知道政府不會同意「五大訴求」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，黃與組織者同意推行相關謀劃，根據她的行為言論，以及提交報名表格時，她已經成為謀劃的參與者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，以黃擔任立法會議員的經驗，以及作為經驗豐富（seasoned）的政治人物，她一定知道政府永遠不會同意「五大訴求」；故如果取得35+，勝選者必然會因政府堅拒屈服於威脅（never yield to their threat），而無差別否決預算案，因此肯定立法解散和特首下台，是黃意圖導致的結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，黃必然知道，預期政府無法或拒絕回應五大訴求，只是用作否決預算案的藉口。以黃的議會經驗，她亦必定知道無差別否決預算案會引發憲制危機，令政府運作陷入癱瘓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黃在選舉論壇表明採納民主黨立場-官非受壓之言&quot;&gt;黃在選舉論壇表明採納民主黨立場 官：非受壓之言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃曾在選舉論壇上表示，如戴耀廷認為需簽協議，民主黨願意簽；又指時任民主黨主席胡志偉和所有議員，會用盡憲制裡所有權力，包括否決預算案，以爭取五大訴求。法官肯定，黃的言論反映其真實立場，而非受其他參選者壓力之下所說的話；亦認為其立場與胡的提倡呼應，顯示她採納了民主黨的立場，即過半後無差別否決預算案。而且黃的言論與組織者在《國安法》後的說法是吻合的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在《國安法》生效後，胡志偉曾在論壇表明所有參選人均會運用否決權，迫使政府回應五大訴求。雖然黃不在場，但法官認為在「共謀者原則」下，相關言論可用來指證黃。而法官肯定於案發期間，在運用否決權的議題上，黃跟胡持相同立場，即會無差別否決預算案，迫使政府回應五大訴求。即使在《國安法》後，黃亦繼續在 Facebook 發布相關帖文。法官確信黃有意推行謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃最終在初選中落敗，她與林卓廷、胡志偉、尹兆堅及其他黨友一同召記招，表明不會參選，但仍會支持獲勝團隊爭取35+。黃並呼籲進入議會的民主派團結，以落實「五大訴求」。法官指，她在落敗後仍然與其他黨員保持團結一致立場，黃在《國安法》生效後仍然是謀劃的一份子。考慮到黃有顛覆政權意圖，並藉參加初選意圖執行謀劃，故裁定她罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一民主黨成員林卓廷，他亦選擇不作供。證據顯示，林沒有出席其參選的新界東選區任何協調會議，只是由莊榮輝代表出席，但林仍可透過群組接收協調文件。法官裁定，林已經了解35+計劃的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林曾經參與選舉論壇，在其辯論筆記可見，他提到民主黨前主席李柱銘反對「攬炒」，而林認為其意見不正確，法官認為顯示林與主席胡志偉同樣認為政權需要付出代價。筆記又提及「胡志偉一再公開回應話會積極運用。況且，其實我立法會四年沒有贊成過財政預算案」；又指不簽署聲明是基於對戴耀廷的尊重，「在會上都有講過如果戴教授真係有份嘢，我哋承諾咗會簽。」不過筆記沒有提及否決財案，因當時預算案還未出台，但法官指無可抗拒推論是林打算無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方力陳，沒有證據顯示筆記由林作出。但法官不同意，因筆記是在林的住所被發現，而且林在論壇中的回答，與筆記內容大致相同。法官指筆記是林為出席論壇而準備的，內容代表了他的信念、認知及立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官林必定知道否決財案負面後果&quot;&gt;官：林必定知道否決財案負面後果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;綜合上述原因，法官認為林充分了解計劃的目的是否決財案，他亦知道和同意民主黨就否決預算案上的立場，而林指願意簽署由戴耀廷發起的聲明，這顯示他對於否決預算案沒有問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;林最終在初選中獲勝，並提交了立法會選舉的表格。而在初選後林和黃碧雲也在場的記者會上，胡志偉表明過半目的是迫使政府回應「五大訴求」，這進一步支持林在《國安法》後繼續參與計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官並提到，以林作為立法會議員的經驗，他必然知道否決預算案會對政府履行職能造成嚴重負面後果。而林雖在論壇筆記提及過往4年從未支持預算案，但「他過往提出任何原因，並非本案審訊的重點」，法官肯定林將無差別否決預算案，因此裁定罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官梁國雄轉發fb帖文提否決財案-肯定知悉目標&quot;&gt;官：梁國雄轉發FB帖文提否決財案 肯定知悉目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;社民連的梁國雄選擇不作供。證據顯示，梁沒有出席新界東任何協調會議，而是由社民連副秘書長陳寶瑩代為出席。在第二次協調會議前，社民連主席黃浩銘致電區諾軒，要求他不要向任何人承諾否決財案。會上鄒家成提出要運用否決權，但陳寶瑩對此表達不同意，戴耀廷最後提議「積極運用」。由於這個議題引起激烈討論，因此法官相信社民連包括梁會關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官留意到，社民連的立場發生變化，他們在5月〈爭奪全面否決權持續不斷抗暴政 — 社會民主連線回應當前香港政治形勢變化的決議文〉提及，有人主張爭取過半議席，以取得全面否決權，而社民連必須審時度勢，檢討過往的立場，共同對抗中共暴政。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而梁國雄曾於 Facebook 轉發社民連帖文，提到無論35+或35-，泛民主派都應否決預算案以令政府回應五大訴求，法官肯定，梁收到協調文件，亦完全知道謀劃的目標，是取得立會過半後運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官過去否決原因非重點&quot;&gt;官：過去否決原因非重點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，梁在提交提名表格時，同時附上「五大訴求，缺一不可，抵抗惡法，您我同行」的競選政綱。梁提到，人大常委會以政治逼害為目的，篩走涉危害國家安全的候選人，並強調35+和否決權的重要性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁在論壇表示自己沒有簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，只是因為聲明重複了35+計劃的目標，又指他過往曾否決財案，對於再次實行並沒有問題。法官認為，梁作為資深政治人物，肯定會知道過半數議員持續否決對政府運作帶來的嚴重後果。他過去或有很多原因、或沒有原因否決，但不是本案的重點，法庭關注2020年的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;梁最終在初選中落敗，他轉發社民連發表的聲明，表示自己不會參選，但會繼續支持35+。法官考慮上述因素，裁定他有顛覆政權的意圖而罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ba8wfSf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image43&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告之中，3名「抗爭派」何桂藍、鄒家成和余慧明均被裁定罪成。法官形容，何桂藍是「擁有最激進政見的參與者之一」，何參選是望將香港現行制度「連根拔起」、反對「一國兩制」，無疑意圖令特區陷入完全停頓並「破局」。至於發起「墨落無悔」的鄒家成，法官指他較激進、不接受中央對港主權，而他作為本土抗爭派，無疑入立法會是要以任何方法對抗政府或建制派，推翻現有政府。至於余慧明，法官指她參選目的是透過「破局」為政治制度帶來巨變，拒信她稱願意與政府談判；又指無疑若政府拒絕答應其訴求，余會連同其他民主派無差別否決預算案，破壞政府權力和合法性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就鄒家成發起「墨落無悔」，當中提及否決預算案，法官認為是填補戴耀廷稱毋須簽署協議的空白，反映各區均達成的共識，拒納鄒稱聲明與協議文件相似是「純粹巧合」。而就岑敖暉等在抗爭派記者會提否決預算案，法官指何桂藍無提出反對，正因他們說出她心中所想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍是新東參選人，她選擇作供。何曾出席所有新東協調會議，法官指戴耀廷有何的電話號碼，無疑會向她發出新東協調文件，認為何有收到，亦完全知悉文件提及「會運用」否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何供稱，曾期望就參與者達成的協議簽署並公開，但最終該文件無出現，因此認為就運用否決權無達成共識。法官接納沒有任何簽署的共識，但認為以何對協議的態度，若組織者未能提供任何書面文件，例如新東協議，難以相信她無向組織者跟進；又留意到何在法庭上，曾數次因某些說話或事情明顯不符她理解或指示，而提出反對，認為何在法庭的證供不可信也不可靠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，何當時沒有投訴，實因她滿意所收到的協議文件內容；何聲稱是單一議題候選人，望將反修例運動精神帶入選舉，文件上「會運用」否決權條款正好反映此點。法官認為，何清楚知道謀劃目標及協議存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納參選僅為鼓勵投票-實望入議會破局&quot;&gt;官拒納參選僅為鼓勵投票 實望入議會「破局」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何供稱參選只想鼓勵人投票以得到最大票數，令外界不會忽視，法官不接納是她參選的唯一理由。法官指，何不曾在競選集會、論壇、訪問、競選單張提及相關看法，亦從未聽過何向公眾提及，立法會取得35+、迫使政府答應五大訴求是不實際或不可能。相反，她曾稱要爭取立會過半，逼出北京不能接受的局面，又指議會不再是議事殿堂、是抗爭陣地，要文攻武鬥等，共同主題是運用權力否決預算案、反對政府及進行抗爭，認為她在法庭的證供與其帖文不一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，何實希望實現行政長官及立法會雙普選，正如她反覆表示現行制度失能、無法為港人服務，她真正想要的是一個全新的政治制度及架構，而為了達成此點，她想獲得高票數進入立會抗爭、「破局」，令外界注意。法官認為，何最終提交提名表格參與初選，可證她是謀劃的一分子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍最終勝出初選，並發文稱最重要是利用立會選舉製造政治張力及觸發憲政危機。法官指，無疑何所指的與戴耀廷提倡的一樣，並與她庭上稱35+不可能完全相反。法官指，若她向選民稱參選目標是取得多票數，認真懷疑她會否仍首位勝出；又指取得高票數但無立會過半，並不會直接觸發憲制危機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍於7月15日出席抗爭派記者會，法官指岑敖暉會上提倡運用否決權癱瘓議會、會拒絕通過預算案，但何沒有提出反對；又指從片段可見，岑在回答應否否決預算案時，曾轉向何的方向，二人亦曾於競選活動一同出現，又共用選舉單張。同樣地，王百羽會上稱「其實我哋嗰個最大公因數就一定係堅決反對《財政預算案》，如果五大訴求冇落實的話」，但何事後無提出反對，供稱認為無需要，惟法官認為，何沒有投訴是因他們正正說出何心中所想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在8月4日於《洛杉磯時報》發文，表示反對派過半便會對北京造成惡夢，因可否決政府所有議案。法官認為，何在整個計劃的立場非常一致，無疑何不僅想破壞政府機能，亦想破壞政府的合法性。法官重申，雖然何供稱35+不可能、參選是望鼓勵投票，但她所做和所說的並不這樣反映。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官最後指，從何桂藍的言行可見，她是擁有最激進政見的參與者之一，希望能將香港現行政治架構及制度「連根拔起」（uproot），並反對「一國兩制」原則，可能她是那些會形容戴耀廷為不激進和不進步的人。法官認為，毫無疑問她參與謀劃的意圖，就是要嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞特區政權機關依法履行職能，旨在顛覆國家政權，令特區陷入完全停頓（complete halt），望其「破局」主張會發生，因此裁定她罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成案發時是新東參選人，他選擇作供。鄒曾出席所有新東協調會議，但就第二次會議情況，法官不接納鄒稱是戴耀廷先提議「會積極運用」否決權，鄒才建議改用「會運用」；而是接納區諾軒說法，會前社民連副主席黃浩銘曾着區不要答應否決預算案，認為是鄒與社民連的爭論後，戴才提議以「積極運用」迎合不同意見。而「會運用」這個較確定的立場，最終在協調文件採納。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，鄒會後曾就不禮貌向戴道歉，戴向他索取電話號碼，戴沒理由不會向他發送協調文件，故肯定鄒有收到。而文件提及會運用否決權、其後亦可見於「墨落無悔」，故鄒清楚知道謀劃存在、其目標是否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納墨落無悔與協議相似純粹巧合鄒是填補戴的空白&quot;&gt;官：拒納「墨落無悔」與協議相似純粹巧合、鄒是填補戴的空白&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成與梁晃維、張可森3人，在戴耀廷表示為免增DQ風險而毋須簽聲明後，發起「墨落無悔」聲明。法官認為，3人來自3個選區，但聲明提及「已取得共識的共同綱領」、「最大公因數」，認為合乎邏輯的推論，是當中運用否決權兩點聲明，是五區協調會議均達成的共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，就辦初選、論壇、目標議席、替補機制4項共識，不具爭議性、亦非政治性，如真屬共同綱領，沒什麼阻止戴要求參選人簽署。法官拒納鄒指「共同綱領」僅指會上討論過的事項，指「墨落無悔」若非代表已達成的共識，3人無需花一個下午準備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，隨着更多人簽署「墨落」，鄒甚至製作 Google 文件讓他人簽署，認為鄒不僅發起聯署，更是聲明的監護人（custodian and guardian）。法官不接納鄒稱，「墨落」與最終協議文件字眼相似，是「純粹巧合」，考慮到製作日期、字眼相似，「墨落」明顯是用來填補戴耀廷留下的空白，裁定鄒不可信也不可靠。而3人其後要求組織者回應，訊息亦清楚提及否決預算案的目標。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官鄒不接受中央對港主權&quot;&gt;官：鄒不接受中央對港主權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，鄒的競選口號為「拒絕殖民，民族抗暴」，亦曾於參選宣言形容香港被中國「殖民」，「說這個帖文的內容為激進，是說得保守了。」鄒又曾發文提到「同殖民者設計嘅議會制度攬炒到底」，雖然鄒稱要守護本土價值，但法官認為他實際上是不接受中央政府對香港的主權。法官亦認為，鄒庭上稱會以「五大訴求」作為唯一優先標準審視預算案、從無想過癱瘓政府，與其FB帖文非常不同，法庭拒絕接納。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，從鄒的言行，他提交提名表格參選時，已是謀劃一分子。而鄒稱一直認為35+不可能，卻選擇繼續參選，明顯他一直都是和戴耀廷一樣，對「35+計劃」樂觀和有信心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官鄒較激進-參選為推翻現行政治制度&quot;&gt;官：鄒較激進 參選為推翻現行政治制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，明顯鄒抱有較為激進的理念或立場，他認為五大訴求有壓倒性民意支持、合法合理，自視為本土派、願景是確立香港民族地位。法官相信他會用盡所有方法迫使政府回應五大訴求，亦因此拒納他稱入議會後不會用武力、只會自衛。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，作為本土抗爭派，毫無疑問鄒家成入立法會的目的，是以任何方法對抗建制派或政府，他參加初選的意圖清晰，就是作為推翻現有政府和政治架構的第一步。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒最終勝出初選並出席抗爭派記者會，岑敖暉會上稱會否決預算案，法官拒納鄒稱不同意岑的說法，並認為毫無疑問鄒參選目的與戴耀廷一致，就是要破壞和推翻現行政治制度，無疑鄒有意圖顛覆香港政府，因此裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官余慧明知悉及同意謀劃參選目的為政治制度帶來巨變&quot;&gt;官：余慧明知悉及同意謀劃、參選目的為政治制度帶來巨變&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於參選衞生服務界、時任醫管局員工陣線主席余慧明，法官認為有充份證據顯示她知悉及同意涉案謀劃，包括她簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，以及競選材料。法官指，毫無疑問，余參加「35+計劃」的目的，是要透過「破局」，為政治制度帶來「巨變（sea change）」，例如余3月曾發表〈踏上這攬炒旅途〉，提到「要破局，必須由制度上的變革開始，甚至把制度推倒重來也在所不惜」；同年8月又受訪稱若真要作出改變，「攬炒」是手段，望「破局而立新」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官余有意圖顛覆國家政權-不信願與政府談判&quot;&gt;官：余有意圖顛覆國家政權 不信願與政府談判&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦指，毫無疑問地，余有意圖嚴重干擾及阻礙政府職能，以達致新的政治制度，即是她所提及的「破局」，裁定她有意圖顛覆國家政權。其中余4月〈攬炒的時代革新意義〉曾稱，「全面否決所有政府提出的議案，藉此觸法基本法第五十條，令特首宣布解散立法會，製造憲政危機」；又曾受訪稱：「一定要用任何方法去推翻而家呢個政權、呢個政府，先可以做到一個改變。」而余盤問時沒有否認她有說過上述的話，僅稱訪問不夠仔細。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，基於余在不同場合的公開說法、及其選舉材料，不接受余庭上稱願意與政府談判和作出讓步；相反，毫無疑問地，若政府拒絕答應余的政治訴求，她有意圖連同他人運用否決權，嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞政權機關，意圖顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 余慧明（左）、岑敖暉（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於余稱她不認為自己意圖所做的事是違法，法官不接納她當時真誠地相信透過無差別否決財案、故意導致「憲政危機」是合法的。無論如何，即使她真的如此相信，也不能構成合理辯解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官余視政府為極權無意與之談判&quot;&gt;官：余視政府為「極權」、無意與之談判&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《國安法》生效後，余曾受訪稱議會是「抗爭戰場」、要將抗爭意志帶入議會、不會為了當選而選擇暫時隱藏「攬炒」、「抗爭」等信念，又形容政府是「極權」；余亦曾於FB發文，指：「抗爭派參與選舉，早就下定決心無論議會內外都要用盡一切手段令暴政付出沈重代價⋯⋯極權面前，我地要團結一致，我地休戚與共。一息尚存，抗爭到底！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，上述並非純綷余所稱的「談判策略」；相反，余視政府為「極權」，並無意與之談判。法官肯定余會將她所說的付諸實行，即在立法會連同其他民主派，無差別否決預算案，以圖破壞政府的權力和合法性；並深信《國安法》生效之後，余的想法也沒有改變。雖然余無參加過任何協調會議，但法庭信納《國安法》前被告已達成協議推行謀劃，而余是一分子，遂裁定罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告當中，共有14人罪成。罪成的民協施德來、何啟明及人民力量陳志全均稱，理解「墨落無悔」聲明沒有綑綁候選人須運用否決權，他們可自行選擇是否運用；但法官認為該解讀難以置信、荒謬，認為聲明字眼簡單直接，被告簽署是意圖無差別否決預算案。就施德來和何啟明稱認為否決權是《基本法》賦予，是與政府談判落實五大訴求的籌碼，法官亦指以二人從政經驗，肯定知道政府永遠不會接受「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，施德來於論壇多次提否決預算案，與其證供相反，其言行亦違背他稱認同民協的「維護中國主權」原則。而同為民協的何啟明指與施德來沒有統一立場，法官不接納，反指若兩人立場不一並發表不同言論，只會引起「政治災難」。至於陳志全街站提到否決預算案，解釋語氣較重，惟法官認為他是淡化自己參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來稱聲明無綑綁用否決權-官指解釋難以置信&quot;&gt;施德來稱聲明無綑綁用否決權 官指解釋難以置信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案發時為民協主席的施德來，在初選中落敗，因此沒有參選。施作供時強調，理解「35+計劃」及「墨落無悔」聲明均沒有綑綁參選人使用否決權，他們可自行決定是否使用。法官認為其解釋令人難以置信，故不接納，認為聲明清晰表達簽署目的是展示抗爭意志，如果就運用否決權一點無約束力，毫不合理。法官又舉例反駁，指施在 Facebook 帖文表示已簽聲明，並承諾會運用立法會權力，包括否決預算案。這顯示他明顯知道聲明具約束力，因此才承諾簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施視否決權為籌碼-官指必知政府不會接受五大訴求&quot;&gt;施視否決權為籌碼 官指必知政府不會接受五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施亦供稱，認為否決權是《基本法》賦予的權力，視否決財案只屬「籌碼」，是迫特首回應「五大訴求」並解決社會矛盾的策略。惟法官指，施作為民協主席，及以其任區議員及從政的經驗，必然知道政府永遠不會接受「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施強調認同民協原則維護中國主權-官言行已違背&quot;&gt;施強調認同民協原則維護中國主權 官：言行已違背&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就施強調無意否決財政預算案，會考慮及討論預算案的優劣才決定，又指自己認同民協堅持的原則，包括維護中國主權及「一國兩制」、改善民生及服務基層等，他認為與政府維持工作關係非常重要，一旦當選將會和政府談判及溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官指，施曾在選舉論壇上表明會兩次否決預算案、與政府沒有談判的餘地，又在FB帖文、選舉單張等多個場合表示會否決預算案，與其庭上證供相反，法官拒納他稱無意否決，亦不接納只是「選舉策略」。法官認為，施的言行，顯示他已違背民協秉持的價值觀，包括維護中國主權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦拒納施稱會與政府談判，指施望透過稱否決預算案而爭取選民支持，亦會繼續保持民協進步的立場和新形象，若他收回承諾，就與「政治自殺」無異。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，《國安法》後，施仍在選舉論壇稱要「全面攬炒」、仍無撤回「墨落無悔」帖文，而他初選落敗後無參選，但仍發文要求獲勝的候選人達到35+。法官肯定，施與組織者一致同意，將會無差別否決財案，並相信他會實行，而施在《國安法》後仍然參與，具意圖顛覆，因此罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明理解墨落可選擇用什麼權-官批解讀荒謬&quot;&gt;何啟明理解「墨落」可選擇用什麼權 官批解讀荒謬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案發時為民協副主席的何啟明，最終在初選中獲勝，並有參選。法官認為，何了解「35+計劃」的目標，是要否決財政預算案。何供稱以其理解，否決權是《基本法》所賦予，又認為「墨落無悔」聲明沒有綑綁否決，參選人可自行選擇運用哪一項《基本法》權力。法官認為其解讀「荒謬（absurd）」，又認為如聲明只是陳述明顯的事（state the obvious），即議員可運用《基本法》賦予的權力，是多餘（otiose）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又反駁指，若參選人能自行選擇運用什麼權力，將會很難達致大多數，集體向政府討價還價。而何稱會用任何《基本法》權力迫使政府回應五大訴求，但不會運用否決權，是與聲明的字面意思和脈絡相反。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指何啟明證供不合理認為民協就否決有統一立場&quot;&gt;官指何啟明證供不合理、認為民協就否決有統一立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官批評何是不可靠證人，其證供不合理。法官不接納何所指，他與民協主席施德來在初選事宜上沒有溝通，而且沒有統一立場。雖然兩人的選區不同，但不會導致兩人缺乏溝通；而且運用否決權是大家都關心的話題，法官認為兩個競選團隊之間無溝通是不合理，相反他們更需要互相協調。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PJ6SuOx.png&quot; alt=&quot;image51&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何啟明（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，根據施所稱當時民協是一個小政黨，亦逐漸被邊緣化，因此對兩人來說，最重要是需在選舉中至少得到一議席，亦即至少其中一人在初選中獲勝。法官認為兩個團隊採取不同競選策略是有違常理，因為若兩人在否決權上立場不統一，並發表不同言論，對民協而言只會是政治災難。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官確信兩人就選舉策略曾進行協調，並需確保在公開場合發表的言論是一致，包括否決財案，兩人必需有一致防線以抵禦預期中候選人會作出的攻擊。對於何表示他與施採取不同的選舉策略，法官認為這與何曾表明支持「墨落無悔」聲明的說法不相符，何不單止簽署聲明，更在轉發聲明時提及施的名字，這顯示兩人之間存在協調，在運用否決權上有統一立場，即會無差別否決財案。法官拒絕接納何所稱，民協核心小組沒有討論過否決權，同時不接納他稱成員可以自行決定有關立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦拒絕接納何表示不知道「35+計劃」的目標，因協調會議上張崑陽和戴耀廷曾討論否決權，但何沒有提出反對。何供稱覺得「35+」可在立法會產生制衡，與政府談判以實現「五大訴求」，但法官不接納其說法，因憑着何在政治領域上的經驗，肯定他知道政府永遠不會接受「五大訴求」，這只是用作否決預算案的藉口；而若真的否決也會令政府運作癱瘓。法官進一步指，何曾在選舉小冊子中表示獲得否決權才可以實現訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，若何理解共同綱領只是區諾軒所指的4點，而不包括否決權，那他在論壇上被問到為何首先簽署聲明時，就不會回答指香港人希望見證民主派達致35+。何之所以簽署，是完全同意無差別否決財案。在《國安法》生效後，何並沒有在 Facebook 上收回對聲明的支持，他仍堅持初選目標之一是展現民主派團結對抗政權的決心。何在初選獲勝後，即宣布參選並表明自己會站在立法會前線對抗政權。法官相信何知道無差別否決財案是不合法，這構成濫用權力。最後裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指人民力量同意民主派之間有共同政治理念&quot;&gt;官指人民力量同意民主派之間有共同政治理念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案發時為人民力量主席的陳志全選擇作供。他沒有出席任何新界東協調會議，只是派代表出席，事後對方向陳匯報。陳得知會上談及否決權，他們將字眼由「運用」改為「積極運用」，但陳認為兩者沒有太大分別。法官認為，即使陳沒有出席會議，但他仍充分了解計劃會運用否決權。雖然陳不同意自己會無差別使用否決權，但他承認有閱讀戴關於〈真攬炒十步〉的文章，因此他必然了解計劃目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提及人民力量過往拒絕參與民主派任何初選，但今次他們同意參與，是基於一個條件，即民主派候選人之間必須有共同政治行動綱領。人民力量在 Facebook 重申，如各方要舉行初選的話，他們應該制定共同的政治行動，以對政府作出制衡。法官確信人民力量同意民主陣營的政治理念，即運用否決權。另外，人民力量曾在 Facebook 轉發「墨落無悔」聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官陳淡化對計劃了解和參與&quot;&gt;官：陳淡化對計劃了解和參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳強調，雖然他簽署聲明，但內文沒有提及將所有候選人綑綁為同一立場，即運用否決權。法官並不接納此說法，因內文簡單直接，亦正是共同政治行動綱領，即陳參選的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳於街站曾提否決預算案，陳庭上稱語氣較重，是「隨口噏」，法官拒絕接納，認為陳採用的字眼和語氣與他此前一致，認為陳只是在庭上淡化自己對計劃的了解和參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EDQe91z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image52&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，人民力量副主席譚得志曾在論壇上表明會否決預算案，法官認為二人以相同政綱參選；而初選前一天，兩人亦在宣傳片提及否決預算案、解散立法會及迫特首下台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳在初選中獲勝，並提交提名表，同時附上「抗爭到底」的宣傳單張。陳其後收到選舉主任提問，但法官指其回答迴避問題、遠非誠實（evasive and far from frank），只是避免被DQ。法官確信陳知道計劃目的，繼續參加是顛覆政權，故裁定罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yOztZiF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image53&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告之中，時任灣仔區議會主席楊雪盈被裁定罪成。沒有作供的楊，無在FB發布「墨落無悔」聲明，但名字出現在其他人帖文，法官認為在無相反證據下，唯一合理推論是她知悉聲明內容，亦是強烈證據她同意及有意推動涉案謀劃；又指她雖無將否決預算案與五大訴求綑綁，但考慮到她不同場合提及爭取過半落實五大訴求的決心、對謀劃的認知和作為區議員的經驗，無可抗拒推論是她意圖聯同其他民主派，無差別否決預算案，並知道會嚴重破壞政府職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同被裁定罪成的區政聯盟柯耀林，法官拒信其選舉助理證供，認為柯對涉案謀劃完全知情，而他曾發文表示立法會不再是討論政治事務的場所，無可抗拒推論是他不會審核任何預算案；加上柯認為政治制度腐敗，簽署「墨落無悔」不足為奇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官楊雪盈fb無發布墨落-惟無相反證據下推論知悉內容&quot;&gt;官：楊雪盈FB無發布「墨落」 惟無相反證據下推論知悉內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;楊雪盈是港島參選人，沒有作供。3次港島協調會議中，楊派代表出席首次，並親身出席之後兩次，其辦公室電腦被搜到「35+立會過半計劃 民主派港島協調機制（初稿）」，提及「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，迫使特首回應「五大訴求」。法官指，在沒有其他相反的證據下，唯一合理推論是楊知道「運用」或「積極運用」否決權，是「35+計劃」的重要元素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;雖然楊雪盈無在FB發布「墨落無悔」帖文，但其名字出現在其他聯署人的帖文上，法官再次指，在沒有其他相反證據下，唯一合理推論是她知悉「墨落無悔」的內容，及知悉其他參選人支持該聲明，而她對「墨落」的贊同，是強烈證據她同意及有意推動涉案謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，《國安法》後，楊與戴耀廷等出席7月9日記者會，戴會上稱35+目標是爭取立法會控制權，行使憲制權力要求政府問責。法官認為，楊當時必然知悉，「35+計劃」目標是取得立會過半，迫政府回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官電腦文件指政府不公-一定會否決財案&quot;&gt;官：電腦文件指政府不公 「一定會」否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續引述楊的參選宣言，提及「五大訴求、議會過半是我們共同呼喚的將來……」；而從其電腦搜獲的文件，問及是否一定會否決預算案時，提及「是。政府多年來提出的財政預算案，都是由上而下，幫唔到真正有需要既人……提出預算案既政府亦唔係直選，整個過程本身就唔公義。看不到非民選的政府，會提出符合香港人利益的財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，相關文件是為楊初選準備的「統一口徑（lines to take）」或論壇筆記，楊知悉並同意。雖然楊沒有政治聯繫，亦沒有將否決預算案與五大訴求綑綁，但上述文件提及她「一定會否決」預算案，因政府不公，不會提出符合港人利益的預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，「知悉」不等於「同意」或「協議」，但考慮到楊在不同場合及文件提及協助民主派立會過半，以落實五大訴求的決心，以及她對謀劃目標的認知、作為區議員的經驗，無可抗拒推論是她意圖聯同其他民主派，在立法會無差別否決預算案，亦知道如預算案否決，會造成嚴重干擾、阻撓和破壞政府職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官落選後fb帖文-證意圖按協議及墨落行事&quot;&gt;官：落選後FB帖文 證意圖按協議及「墨落」行事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續引楊雪盈在初選落選後的帖文，提及得票不足，「我一定會尊重選民的決定，遵守初選協定，跟從民主派協調的安排」，又指「希望大家一定要在未來的正式選舉中，給各位初選勝出的代表，投下支持的一票！民主派能團結地在議會發揮最大的抗爭力量，難道不是我們共同的願望嗎？」法官認為，帖文不單與港島區協調協議一致，亦證明楊意圖按協議及「墨落無悔」行事；楊亦知道她支持的其他候選人，同樣意圖無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方證人趙家賢曾稱，就戴耀廷提否決預算案，楊曾向他稱「咪由佢講吓囉」，認為議員入立會後也是自主行事。惟法官不給予任何比重，認為相關陳述是「混合式陳述」，亦沒有楊的證供支持，無可抗拒推論是她意圖顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，在沒有楊的解釋下，肯定她是謀劃的一分子，意圖顛覆國家政權。法庭無忘記楊於2020年7月底報名參選立法會正式選舉，明顯違反協調協議及「墨落無悔」，惟法官指，那是在區諾軒和趙家賢宣布退出初選後發生。法庭不會揣測楊是否「靈童」，但無論如何，楊報名參選的行為，並無影響法官裁定她案發時知道並同意參與謀劃，因此裁定她罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指柯耀林選舉經理陳展浚非誠實可靠-認為柯有關注初選動態&quot;&gt;官指柯耀林選舉經理陳展浚非誠實可靠 認為柯有關注初選動態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於參選新東的區政聯盟柯耀林選擇不作供，只是傳召其選舉經理陳展浚作供。法官裁定陳並非誠實可靠證人，其證供與真相有差距。陳表示柯工作繁忙，故沒有密切關注政治動態的習慣，但法官不接納，指柯活躍於政壇多年。法官亦對陳稱柯閱報時只會留意其物業管理工作方面的廣告感懷疑，認為陳證供嘗試令柯與初選保持距離，但實際上柯非常留意最近的政治動態，亦密切關注戴耀廷說的話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官亦指，由於初選涉及大量資金，約30至50萬，因此柯肯定會密切關注組織者的一言一行，因一旦組織者作出政治方向或後勤安排的改變，都會影響其選舉策略、財政資源及成功機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳表示無收到組織者的文件-官批評不合邏輯&quot;&gt;陳表示無收到組織者的文件 官批評不合邏輯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳展浚表示自己沒有出席協調會議，但法官認為他也是嘗試讓自己與初選保持距離。對於陳表示沒有收到協調文件，法官批評是不合邏輯及令人難以置信，因戴耀廷有柯的聯絡電話。法官肯定柯有收到文件，知道當中提及運用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對陳指組織者有責任通知協調會議內容，法官批評說法荒謬，指陳只是嘗試描述柯對謀劃的認知有限；就陳稱留意到柯沒有將戴儲存為聯絡人，法官亦質疑他並非一個如此注意細節的人。法官亦不相信陳聲稱沒有看過戴的文章、及戴在初選記者會上說的話，因若屬實，陳作為選舉經理的任務便是失敗。法官因此裁定柯對謀劃完全知情，清楚知道案發時有協議取得立會過半。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官柯認為政治制度腐敗-簽署墨落無悔不足為奇&quot;&gt;官：柯認為政治制度腐敗 簽署「墨落無悔」不足為奇&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官留意到，柯曾發文指立法會不再是討論政治事務的場所，無可抗拒的推論是他不會審核任何預算案和政府議案。柯亦提及民主派取得35+後，會獲得主導權，又表明會團結抗爭力量，支持抗爭陣營對抗敵人，並肯定自己會參與協調。法官指，柯覺得當時的政治制度已經腐敗，柯因此簽署「墨落無悔」聲明也不足為奇，而他支持聲明，是因聲明反映了他對協調會議上達成共識的理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，柯發文向選民表明自己堅決抵抗的立場，又表示即使可能入獄亦不會退縮。法官確信他參與謀劃，意圖嚴重干擾、阻撓及破壞政府履行職能。柯亦在選舉政綱中表示，香港人不能再以被動態度對抗極權。法官認為，在他提交提名表時，他已經是謀劃一份子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指柯政綱提出項目需用財案撥款-官拒接納&quot;&gt;辯方指柯政綱提出項目需用財案撥款 官拒接納&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方力陳，柯在政綱中提及的項目需用到財政預算案的撥款，因此他不會無差別否決。法官不同意說法，因他在選舉單張中表明暴政鎮壓越趨加劇，高壓殖民統治會令香港人抗爭更加激烈；而香港人需要勇於抵抗的立法會議員。法官認為他對「殖民統治」的看法與鄒家成相近。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，柯列出的政治議程沒有細節，法官指很難判斷屬於過往工作還是當選後的追求，即使是後者，這些項目也可以在當時政治體制被取代之後繼續執行。法官認為，柯參與初選及立法會選舉的意圖顯而易見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官柯無表示不支持攬炒-任議員必知否決財案後果&quot;&gt;官：柯無表示不支持「攬炒」 任議員必知否決財案後果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦強調，柯與不支持「攬炒」的參選人劉凱文聯合宣傳，因此他並無顛覆意圖。法官不同意，因柯沒有在選舉單張中表示不支持「攬炒」，而劉受訪時亦曾表示以香港的政治局勢而言，「攬炒」是必然的結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官相信，柯作為經驗豐富的區議員，深知持續否決財案會對政府履行職能上造成嚴重負面後果。而他初選落敗後呼籲選民繼續支持其他勝出者，法官認為他是呼籲他人繼續支持謀劃，具意圖顛覆政府，因此裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】初選案16名不認罪被告之中，公民黨鄭達鴻被裁定罪成，其黨友李予信則罪脫。鄭曾供稱反對黨否決預算案，惟法官指，他在公民黨記者會上無提反對、而是舉牌，可強烈推論他決定遵循黨魁楊岳橋表達的黨立場；而他不同場合的公開發言亦顯示他忠於黨立場，為獲黨支持參選，打算跟隨更激進的路線，當選後無差別否決預算案。法官不同意鄭僅盲目背誦黨路線，認為他不會拿自己政治前途冒險，採取與黨魁相違的立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同被裁定罪成的彭卓棋，法官指其政網表明必須運用否決權，否決所有不公義議案。法官不接納彭在論壇表示不惜癱瘓政府等，只是發表「選舉語言」，認為他是「投機取巧」及不可信的證人，作出對自己有利的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官鄭達鴻必知公民黨同意戴謀劃很多候選人同意用否決權&quot;&gt;官：鄭達鴻必知公民黨同意戴謀劃、很多候選人同意用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;公民黨鄭達鴻是港島參選人，審訊時有作供。法官接納控方證人區諾軒稱，2020年2月戴耀廷與包括梁家傑的公民黨成員見面，鄭曾參與公民黨記者會前的籌備會議，譚文豪提議該黨帶頭以否決權為籌碼爭取五大訴求。而在3月25日記者會上，梁家傑表示支持民主派協調，達致議會過半，楊岳橋及譚文豪亦承諾公民黨會否決財政預算案，要求落實五大訴求，相關說法與戴耀廷文章吻合，無疑他們所指的是戴提出的「35+計劃」。法官又指，鄭電腦內有戴文章〈齊上齊落 目標35+〉截圖，提倡取得足夠議席否決預算案，認為不可抗拒的推論是鄭在3月底必定留意到，至少上述的公民黨成員，同意公民黨應該參與戴的計劃，更重要的是，他們同意推行該謀劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，鄭參與了港島協調會議，並留意到有人提出使用否決權的議題，接納區諾軒指只有司馬文表達反對。至於6月的「墨落無悔」聲明，鄭表示有與黨員商討是否簽署，而鄭電腦內亦有相關文件，顯示聲明獲公民黨及其他人贊同，鄭在6月初必然留意到很多候選人已表達同意使用否決權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官若公民黨無共同訊息召記招是違背常識&quot;&gt;官：若公民黨無共同訊息召記招是違背常識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭達鴻供稱，曾在籌備會議和公民黨討論是否簽署「墨落無悔」聲明時，表達不同意，不過其意見不獲接納；又指記者會上楊岳橋等3人表達的意見，並非所有出席記者會人士的統一立場，至少郭家麒和郭榮鏗有不同意見，他同意後兩者說法。惟法官指，如公民黨沒有共同訊息傳達而召記者會，是違背常識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又引郭榮鏗會上提及，提倡運用包括否決預算案的權力；郭家麒則指市民要求五大訴求很清楚，無論任何人當選都要要求政府回應，又指如撥款胡亂增加警察開支，有責任反映，直至政府交出合理的預算案。法官認為，郭家麒判斷預算案是否合理的標準，是政府會否正面回應五大訴求，而發言者說法的差異，只是重點不同，但實質內容一樣，不接納鄭達鴻稱會上各人表達的訊息不一致，亦不接納鄭如此相信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官不同意鄭僅盲目背誦公民黨路線&quot;&gt;官不同意鄭僅盲目背誦公民黨路線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄭又供稱，若然當選會申請公民黨豁免機制，不跟從黨就預算案的立場投票，並會審視預算案的優劣，不會無差別投反對票。惟法官認為，鄭記者會上沒有對楊岳橋等人的意見表達不同意，反而站在他們身後，高舉「35+議會過半實現五大訴求」標語牌。法官認為，無論鄭在籌備會議說過什麼，強烈推論他在3月25日已決定遵循梁家傑和楊岳橋表達的黨立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，鄭之後的言行進一步強化了上述推論，包括電台節目表示「共同目標就係撼動個政權去用35 plus」，而戴耀廷要求不簽聲明是想有「走棧位」，但有人想繼續有共同願望，因此有聯署，而公民黨已簽署。法官不接納鄭的言論只是盲目背誦公民黨的路線，指明顯他承認候選人有共同目標撼動政權，亦同意公民黨簽署「墨落無悔」。法官亦拒絕接納鄭指公民黨以黨名義簽署能提供彈性，認為說法不合邏輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官又指，鄭曾在公民黨街站稱民主派要團結力爭35+，可以在立法會否決預算案，為香港人爭取落實五大訴求，認為其說法不僅是「選舉修辭」；而鄭提交初選提名表格時，政綱提及「以關鍵否決權促使政府落實『五大訴求』」，雖然是基於公民黨統一範本，但認為鄭作出的承諾令他日後難以獲黨豁免。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官公開發言顯示忠於公民黨否決立場&quot;&gt;官：公開發言顯示忠於公民黨否決立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，鄭FB帖文曾稱會否決預算案逼特首下台，從而爭取五大訴求，法官認為不論帖文是否由鄭本人撰寫，他不可能對帖文不知情；而鄭選舉論壇上也提及要否決預算案。就鄭有份參與拍攝的公民黨初選宣傳短片中，楊岳橋曾稱會否決預算案，法官亦不接納鄭稱別無選擇拍攝，指他明顯可以選擇，而他選擇遵從黨的路線，以得到支持參選，實現成為立法會議員的夢想，不接納他會採取與黨魁「莊嚴承諾」相違的立場，拿自己的政治前途冒險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，鄭公開發言顯示他忠於（committed to）公民黨否決預算案的立場，裁定鄭於3月已同意謀劃，並為獲黨支持參選，打算跟隨更激進的路線，即當選後無差別否決預算案。而就區諾軒還柙時曾寫信予鄭指他被公民黨「連累」，法官不給予任何比重，認為區諾軒不能代表鄭的想法說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官拒納公民黨國安法後改變立場&quot;&gt;官：拒納公民黨《國安法》後改變立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就鄭供稱，《國安法》後公民黨曾修改政綱，法官認為當中仍提及「否決財政預算案，迫使政府落實五大訴求」，與《國安法》前單張無分別。而公民黨用「以言入罪 無字政綱」代替初選政綱，惟法官認為，一個合理的人會解讀口號為對《國安法》的抗議，無從顯示公民黨改變否決預算案，迫政府回應五大訴求的立場，又認為公民黨的修改只為減少候選人被DQ的風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官不接納鄭達鴻認為35+不可能，認為他被DQ後退黨，只因對黨的不滿及夢想破碎；他清楚知道「35+計劃」目標，並意圖跟隨黨的否決路線。法官又指，以鄭作為區議員及其政治經驗，必然知道政府不會接受「五大訴求，缺一不可」；加上其法律背景，他肯定知道推行謀劃意味解散立法會兩次，最終特首下台。考慮到他在《國安法》後持續參與初選，唯一合理推論是他意圖顛覆國家政權，因此裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官彭卓棋選舉單張印戴攬炒十步-清楚知道計劃目標&quot;&gt;官：彭卓棋選舉單張印戴「攬炒十步」 清楚知道計劃目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭卓棋是港島參選人，他不屬任何政黨，於審訊時選擇作供。法官接納區諾軒提及，他和戴耀廷曾於2020年2至3月與彭會面，但彭不關心立會過半或否決權，只關心選票方式，因會影響其勝算。而彭有出席首次港島區協調會議，會上有人提出使用否決權的議題，不過各方尚未就「運用」或「積極運用」字眼達成協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭的電腦內有選舉單張草稿，標題為「共同協調人民奪權 齊上齊落對抗極權」，首頁提到民主派35+願景是提倡否決財案，迫當權者回應五大訴求，單張背面印有戴耀廷的「攬炒十步」時間表。法官因此確信，彭清楚知道戴耀廷提倡利用「35+計劃」取得立會過半，否決預算案，迫政府答應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官彭政綱表明會否決所有不公義議案&quot;&gt;官：彭政綱表明會否決所有「不公義」議案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續指，彭在政綱表明必須運用否決權，「否決所有不公義議案（包括財政預算案）……迫使當權回應『五大訴求』……阻撓不公議會進行」；又提到「『35+』是選舉主軸，以『議會抗爭攬炒』迫使政府回應『五大訴求』，這是沒有妥協的空間」、「不論是純政治表態的議案還是具約束力的議案，我們也不應該放過任何一個機會去展示抗爭意志」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，彭是表達對抗政府的堅定決心，他將「35+計劃」、「立法會抗爭」、「攬炒」及「五大訴求」連結一起，又指立法會「腐爛」現象持續已久，與他指預算案及立法會程序「不公」的說法相呼應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭稱有意大灣區創業-官指與反政府無矛盾&quot;&gt;彭稱有意大灣區創業 官指與反政府無矛盾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官指，雖然彭稱有興趣探索大灣區商機，並協助年輕企業家利用政府資助作相關事情，但不接納辯方所指，基於上述利益，彭不大可能有意圖與他人否決財案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官舉例反駁，彭在政綱中就經濟改革表明要「推倒既有經濟結構」，主張「先拆除，後重建」，因此彭一方面推動創業，一方面持反對政府的政治理念，兩者並無必然衝突。法官認為，考慮到選舉單張及彭的教育程度，他必然意識到常人會理解其政綱的意思，是當選後會否決財案迫使政府回應五大訴求，這亦是他想傳達的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;再者，彭曾經簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，並且在選舉論壇上表明：「我哋嘅敵人就係共產黨，我哋入到議會不惜以肢體抗爭、癱瘓政府、否決財政預算案，亦會用議員身位支援街頭抗爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官彭作供投機取巧不可信&quot;&gt;官：彭作供「投機取巧」、不可信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官認為，觀察彭在庭上作供，認為他是個「投機取巧」及不可信的證人，作出對自己有利的說法。法官亦不接納他聲稱自己僅發表「選舉語言」，實際上無意執行。法官又指，彭明顯將政府及共產黨刻劃成「敵人」，表明不公義的預算案必須被否決，亦無意與他一再形容為「暴政」的政府談判，唯一合理推論是他完全贊同「35+計劃」的目標，意圖嚴重破壞政府和政權的合法性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就彭卓棋稱《國安法》後曾撕爛單張，以示放棄政綱，法官也不接納，指彭從未公開宣布放棄政綱，單張仍可見反抗政府的訊息，認為彭稱沒有政綱下參選不是講真話。相反，法官認為彭派發撕爛單張的行為，是含蓄地向公眾傳達反抗政府的決心。考慮上述因素後，法官裁定他罪成。&lt;/p&gt;

But even with the best intentions, fast-paced adoption and implementation of AI in the public sector will involve significant challenges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widespread adoption of AI technologies comes with much promise. In the public sector in particular, AI integration has the potential to bring greater efficiency, for example by speeding up administrative services, thereby saving taxpayer money and offering better services to citizens. On a more macro level, AI integration in the public sector – civilian and military alike – is also supposed to secure an economic and military advantage to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government already envisages widespread adoption of AI, and is encouraging civil servants to familiarise themselves with generative AI at work, for instance. The Cabinet Office is currently running a trial for an AI-powered chatbot, intended to make an interactive document analysis tool accessible to all civil servants. However, while the aim is for all government departments to use AI and support the wider goal of becoming a “global AI superpower”, in practice, many hurdles arise for the adoption of AI by the public sector. These range from the lack of skills and training in day-to-day engagement with AI technologies to a lack of flexible procurement and technical leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;knowledge-and-skills-in-the-private-sector&quot;&gt;Knowledge and Skills in the Private Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key challenge the public sector faces is that much of the knowledge and experience around AI development, research and application currently lies in the private sector, whose deep pockets drive R&amp;amp;D and attract much sought-after talent. No public spending commitments come close to the budgets of the private sector – compare the UK’s £900 million commitment to build a supercomputer to the $35 billion committed by AWS to data centres in Virginia. Of course, many consultancies offer well paid advice to public sector entities on how to navigate this challenge. But it takes more and especially different kinds of partnerships with the private sector to enable greater information and knowledge exchange between public and private organisations. Such partnerships are needed not only to enable the public sector to reap the benefits of AI but also to design effective regulation and governance to mitigate any risks that arise. The National Cyber Security Centre’s Industry 100 scheme, through which public institutions host cyber security experts from the private sector for one day a week or month, is a laudable model that could be replicated in an AI context. This would allow the public sector to benefit from private-sector expertise while the private sector can access a greater network and gain insights into the government’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-from-defence-procurement&quot;&gt;Learning from Defence Procurement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges also arise given the public sector’s slow procurement of AI technologies. The Ministry of Defence (MoD), for example, spent £25 billion with UK industry in 2022/23. Yet industry has long complained about the MoD as a customer, and these complaints extend to its procurement of AI. The MoD published its strategy for exploiting AI (the “Defence Artificial Intelligence Strategy”) in 2022, but has since faced criticism for failing to sufficiently detail how it will become “the world’s most effective, efficient, trusted and influential Defence organisation for our size [in terms of AI]”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A greater range of partnerships are needed not only to enable the public sector to reap the benefits of AI but also to design effective regulation and governance to mitigate any risks that arise&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies, both large and small, have not received clear demand signals on the MoD’s operational objectives, hindering the deployment of successful AI in defence. Besides a lack of clarity on priorities and requirements (which, granted, the Defence AI Centre hopes to rectify), uncertainty persists over how to integrate AI with existing systems. The MoD contains a myriad of “architectural standards, patterns and interfaces”, thereby limiting data accessibility (the lifeblood of AI functionality) and AI integration into decision-making, analysis and training processes. Similarly, the rather disparate efforts at AI procurement across a host of defence entities – from front-line commands to the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory – inhibit AI’s efficiency benefits. The Integration Design Authority (IDA) will alleviate some of these frictions by incorporating a level of AI oversight into its efforts; however, it cannot bear sole responsibility for this task, as the IDA was created to facilitate integration across the whole of Defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, most of the AI innovation occurs in smaller firms and start-ups, especially small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), while many of the MoD’s procurement processes are overwhelmingly oriented towards the largest defence contractors – the so-called “defence primes”. The regulatory framework requires experience of navigating the complex MoD bureaucracy as well as sufficient capital to sustain one’s firm through the long process. SMEs often have neither the £25,000 monthly revenue stream to stay afloat, nor the decades of organisational knowledge about the MoD’s security and classification protocols: their choice is either to fail or to pivot away from the MoD to easier customers. Ongoing efforts to shorten innovation cycles include the new “Integrated Procurement Model” with a focus on software-oriented procurement, which requires maintaining a stronger relationship with companies in order to ensure constant, iterative updates. To secure the best technological advantage, MoD and wider public procurement need to become more agile to include smaller companies that provide cutting-edge technology, even if not at scale yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changing-the-public-sector-career-mindset&quot;&gt;Changing the Public Sector Career Mindset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoD at least has an AI strategy; 76% of government departments don’t, even though over a third of surveyed government departments questioned on the use of AI by the public sector are already deploying AI. Declaring the aim to become a global AI superpower is perhaps an ambitious target, but it is by no means sufficient in terms of setting useful guidance and vision for government departments. The UK’s public sector needs more tangible goals to work towards. This means identifying in more concrete terms what being an “AI superpower” looks like in the next 3, 5, 10 and 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Only when its people support the government’s aim of being an AI superpower will the UK be able to turn ambition into reality&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting out and implementing such a vision needs credible leadership at all levels and in all government departments. Yet the career civil servants and generalists who often fill these positions can easily lack the technological understanding and vision that a technician from the private sector, or even a specialist within the public sector, might offer. Thus, external hiring needs to become more agile to offer private-sector tech visionaries and specialists the opportunity to come into the public sector on a senior level and for a shorter timeframe than is currently the case, while still benefitting from full integration and trust from public sector colleagues. Similarly, technology experts already working within the public sector must be able to be promoted to leadership positions, not only to offer their expertise on new levels but also to show that a long-lasting technology career within the public service is possible. Only by hiring and retaining adequate technology leadership will the public sector be able to successfully roll out AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;navigating-the-talent-terrain&quot;&gt;Navigating the Talent Terrain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically focused leaders are crucial for planning and envisioning strategies, but are entirely reliant upon the skills held within government departments to enact their policies. Unfortunately, the National Audit Office’s autumn 2023 survey of government bodies found that 70% of respondents described a lack of skills as a barrier to AI adoption. Difficulties in hiring and retaining individuals with the necessary skills to develop and deploy AI have intensified in recent years, exacerbated by uncompetitive salaries relative to the private sector (which faces its own skills shortage). Every entity of the UK government needs greater expertise in machine learning, data management and cloud computing, along with a broader spectrum of software skills and lawyers trained in AI ethics and the corresponding legal compliance. Yet the demand for skills must extend beyond experts. Non-technical employees must familiarise themselves with simple data processes while understanding the function of their organisation’s models in order to trust the outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government is demonstrating its commitment to equipping younger generations with the skills for a data-driven world. But this investment is geared towards the long-term upskilling of the UK economy and does not mitigate the current shortcomings of an under-skilled civil service. Currently, the government is filling this gap with “contractors, agency workers, and temporary staff”, who comprise a third of “digital and data professionals”. Despite the government commitment to reduce reliance upon temporary workers in order to cut costs, the lead time on large-scale upskilling indicates that the government will need to continue to buy in skills before developed skills have matured. This transition must be accelerated by including data skills as part of on-the-job learning for all civil service roles, providing a boost in digital literacy without more major expenditure in formal training. Similarly, personnel management must become more porous to permit expertise to flow out of and back into government with ease. Flexible career paths between the public and private sectors are needed to ensure that private-sector knowledge, ideas and skills can be brought into government at no additional cost to the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-people-challenge-as-much-as-a-technology-one&quot;&gt;A People Challenge as Much as a Technology One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much can be debated about what the right aim is for a grand AI strategy, how the public sector can procure AI technologies and who has the vision and leadership to work towards AI implementation in the public sector. Most importantly, however, the UK cannot become an AI superpower unless the ambition is reflected in wider society. This includes early access to learning opportunities and safe engagement to try out human-machine teaming, as well as a clear signal of job opportunities rather than threats to the labour market. Critically, it also requires strong engagement with ethical concerns and other risks that need to be addressed to meaningfully assure the responsible use of AI. Only when its people support the government’s aim of being an AI superpower will the UK be able to turn ambition into reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While international media attention is currently diverted to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the question of whether to engage with the Taliban’s de facto government remains a contentious topic actively deliberated in Western diplomatic circles. Rather than examining the merits of engaging (or not) with the Taliban, this Emerging Insights paper highlights the Taliban’s perceptions, agendas and modes of operation in order to gain a better understanding of how to move forward with the question of future engagement with the Taliban. The paper is specifically aimed at informing Western policymakers and is not intended to cover the wider spectrum of the Taliban’s perceptions of the external world, nor does it aim to analyse the group’s foreign policymaking. Thus, notwithstanding their undoubted importance, the paper does not cover the Taliban’s relations with Afghanistan’s neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is informed by recent research on the Taliban’s more than two years in government, supported by tens of meetings and interviews with Taliban officials and leaders, dating from well before August 2021 and up to the present day. Identities and all data emerging from these exchanges are either anonymised or unattributed, as specific sources cannot be identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper has two main sections. The first section discusses the Taliban’s perception of Western countries and the second outlines the Taliban agenda towards Western countries. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications for Western powers of engaging with the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-the-taliban-perception-of-the-west&quot;&gt;UNDERSTANDING THE TALIBAN PERCEPTION OF THE WEST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resentment-and-suspicion&quot;&gt;RESENTMENT AND SUSPICION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than two years of diplomatic negotiations and exchanges, the Taliban are sceptical about the value of engaging with the West. “We have had open discussion with many political figures over the past two years, diplomats and UN officials, but we see little progress as a result”, says one senior Taliban member. Still, this does not mean that the Taliban have given up on building bridges with the West – not yet. The Taliban recognises the Doha agreement of February 2020 as the main document regulating their relations with the US and by extension all Western countries, as the agreement refers to “the United States, its allies, and the Coalition”. Disagreements over the implementation of that agreement fuel Taliban distrust of the US and its allies – as well as US distrust of the Taliban. The US has repeatedly accused the Taliban of not having fully implemented the terms of the agreement, in particular with regard to their handling of groups linked to Al-Qaeda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Doha agreement was rather imprecisely worded, asking the Taliban not to allow “any of its members, other individuals or groups, including al-Qa’ida, to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies”, to “prevent them from recruiting, training, and fundraising” and not to “host them” (note that the term “ally” lends itself to conflicting interpretations). It also asked the Taliban to “send a clear message that those who pose a threat to the security of the United States and its allies have no place in Afghanistan” and to “instruct members of the … Taliban not to cooperate with groups or individuals threatening the security of the United States and its allies”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly, the US State Department is silent on whether the agreement still stands. The State Department has been vocal about the Taliban’s treatment of women and other rights issues, while gradually becoming more positive about the Taliban’s handling of foreign jihadists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban responded that, according to the Doha agreement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US was supposed to “initiate an administrative review of current U.S. sanctions and the rewards list against members of the … Taliban with the goal of removing these sanctions by August 27, 2020”, and that this did not happen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US was further supposed to “start diplomatic engagement with other members of the United Nations Security Council and Afghanistan to remove members of the … Taliban from the sanctions list with the aim of achieving this objective by May 29, 2020”, and that this did not happen either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The US also committed to “refrain from the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan or intervening in its domestic affairs”. The Taliban claim is that the US is continually putting pressure on them on these matters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban also argue that the freezing of National Bank funds violates the spirit of the Doha agreement, as does the fact that the US continues to fly drones over Afghanistan. Sources were keen to stress this point, and claimed that leaders in the Taliban felt intimidated by the continuous drone surveillance, which some of them took as a sign of US bad faith. Some leaders argue that this unfriendly behaviour plays into the hands of hardliners opposed to engaging with the West, pushing pragmatists to prioritise internal Taliban unity over efforts to marginalise the hardliners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a degree of defensiveness in evidence here, and there are other, perhaps more important, reasons why the hardliners gradually gained influence from September 2021, it is at least plausible that the more threatened the Taliban feel, and the more distrust towards Western countries there is within their ranks, the easier it will be for Taliban hostile to engaging with Western countries to impose their line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than 20 years of war, the Taliban’s distrust of Western countries (and vice versa) comes as no surprise. But it is, nonetheless, one factor contributing to why Afghanistan’s de facto government has so far shown little to no interest in responding to calls by foreign governments and institutions for policy change – with the assumption being that such governments and institutions cannot be trusted to reward Taliban concessions in any substantial way. The Taliban maintain that the centrality of Sharia Law to their system of governance is non-negotiable, and they also have their own ways of determining which interpretation of Sharia Law applies in a given case, with the prime authority in the field resting with the Taliban’s Amir, Haibatullah Akhundzada (who is the leader of the Taliban movement but does not have a formal role in the Taliban government).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One noteworthy example of how Taliban distrust can have the effect of harming the Taliban themselves is the recent failure of the so-called “Doha II” meeting of 18 February 2024, when special envoys for Afghanistan gathered to discuss the report prepared by UN Special Coordinator Feridun Sinirlioğlu. Although the intention was to map a path towards the normalisation of relations, the Taliban interpreted the recommendation to appoint a UN special envoy for Afghanistan as an attempt to humiliate them. They also took exception to civil society representatives seemingly being accorded the same status as the Taliban at the meeting. Then, when it emerged that the UN Secretary-General would not chair the meeting with the Taliban, they took it as a snub (notwithstanding that Antonio Guterres could not meet the unrecognised de facto government in any case). Attempts to find an approach acceptable to the Taliban failed after the UN’s final proposal arrived too late for the Taliban’s slow policymaking arrangements, which required it to make the rounds between Kabul and Kandahar, gaining the acceptance of all the Taliban’s heavyweights. The end result was that the Taliban did not attend the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sensitivities-about-criticism&quot;&gt;SENSITIVITIES ABOUT CRITICISM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban are especially proud of what they view as having achieved stability in Afghanistan and ending the very long war that began in 1978. State collapse, feared by many, has been averted and the Taliban have undoubtedly proven able to provide basic security. They consider this the main source of legitimacy of the new regime. Ordinary Afghans, they say, now enjoy the freedom to move around the country without risking their lives. “Many people have been able to visit their home villages for the first time in decades”, said one member. The Taliban also express irritation that among foreign diplomats there has either been no acknowledgement of their achievement of what they describe as the “neutralisation of the IS-K [Islamic State in Khorasan] threat” without external help, or, if the achievement is acknowledged, it is immediately undermined by what they see as a litany of complaints about the Taliban’s lack of respect for the rights of minorities and women. It seems clear that in the expectations of many Taliban, the group’s role in containing IS-K and averting state collapse should offset the other concerns of Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taliban leaders and officials say that they appreciate receiving advice, but remark that “there is a big difference between advice given by your enemy and advice given by a friend”, implying that Western countries are not “friends”. These words from another senior member of the Taliban show how the distrust for Western countries is apparent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What we don’t appreciate is when the West and in particular the US occupies the moral higher ground and start[s] issuing advice to the IEA [Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan] on issues of human rights and freedoms – as if we don’t see and hear about their practices in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world – look what is going on in Gaza as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban also harbour resentment about public criticism in the diplomatic arena:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you advise someone with good faith, the advice and the way it is delivered must be peaceful and preferably confidential. One does it to receive reward from Allah and not to score goals or humiliate the other side. However, if the advice is public and confrontational, then the Taliban movement considers it offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s extreme sensitivity to public criticism is hardly unique – most governments would be sensitive – but theirs is likely reinforced by the sense of insecurity derived from their lack of diplomatic training and relative lack of experience in navigating the diplomatic arena. An additional factor, perhaps even more important, is that in the constant intra-Taliban tussle over competing foreign policy lines, Taliban interlocutors with Western countries feel humiliated by external criticism, which they believe undermines them in the eyes of their more sceptical colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the Taliban are often thirsty for Western appreciation. The July to October 2023 World Bank reports, for example, were greatly appreciated by some Taliban for their positive assessment of the financial and economic trends in Afghanistan. This illustrates how the Taliban – particularly the pragmatists among them – value acknowledgement and commendations. They interpreted the reports as a sign of political appreciation and as a rare piece of evidence of external appreciation that they can show to their more isolationist colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diverging foreign policy views among the Taliban could explain why, at a surface level, the Taliban have appeared resistant to taking advice from any source, Western or otherwise, public or private. Individual Taliban leaders and groups within the Taliban are reported by their colleagues to be willing to listen to advice from different sources – Qatar, the UAE, China or even in some cases the CIA – but contradictory pieces of advice tend to offset each another, resulting in little movement in policy terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-the-taliban-think-they-need-to-engage-with-the-west&quot;&gt;WHY THE TALIBAN THINK THEY NEED TO ENGAGE WITH THE WEST&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban tend to deny courting external support, while at the same time seeking it in certain circumstances. For example, senior Taliban contacted for this paper say that the main reason for the April 2022 ban on the cultivation, production and trade of drugs was awareness of the devastation that hard drugs were bringing to Afghanistan itself, as well as the fact that Sharia Law bans the consumption of narcotics. However, the desire for external support is evident when they suggest, to one of the authors but also to foreign diplomats, that help in dealing with the large quantity of drug addicts in the country and providing alternative livelihoods to opium farmers would be welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban also argue that consolidating an improved security situation depends on “improving people’s livelihoods and in particular new employment opportunities for young men from rural areas”, as a senior figure put it to one of the authors. The need for economic progress in Afghanistan is one of the main rationales for external engagement in the eyes of the Taliban. However, there is little readiness to accept trade-offs that might include what many Taliban consider external interference in their internal decision-making. The Taliban are, nevertheless, beginning to implement plans to open Afghanistan’s mining sector to investment, not least to encourage Western investment to counterbalance the expected heavy Chinese investment in the Afghan economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-talibans-agenda&quot;&gt;THE TALIBAN’S AGENDA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taliban-rigidities-and-some-evolution&quot;&gt;TALIBAN RIGIDITIES AND SOME EVOLUTION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no question that the Taliban suffer from multiple rigidities in their policymaking. Some of these may be “ideological rigidities”, either genuine ones embedded in the Taliban’s origins, or ones rooted in the fear of being overtaken by more extreme groups. Others may have more to do with power struggles and internal competition among groups and leaders. Others still may be understood simply as a demonstration of sovereignty, a result of the Taliban’s desire to show that they are in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Taliban pragmatists and modernists claim that the suspension of women’s and girls’ education, in high schools in September 2021 and in universities in December 2022, is the result of pressures from a minority group of ultra-conservative leaders, mostly concentrated in Kandahar, who genuinely believe that previous arrangements were not compliant with Sharia Law, and who have the support of the Amir. This is despite the fact that the policy is rather unpopular, even among Taliban themselves. Many Taliban officials say they do not take very seriously the view of figures such as Justice Minister Abdul Hakim Haqqani, who believe that jihad (intended as “mobilisation for struggle”) should continue until the establishment of a fully Islamic order – that is, a system of government very rigidly based on an institutionalised version of the Taliban’s understanding of Islam. For them, the jihad ended the moment Kabul fell in August 2021. However, even these Taliban justify the implementation of such policies with another ideological statement: that revolt against the “legitimate Amir” without “legitimate justification” (which can only be the Amir’s disbelief in Allah) is not permissible under Sharia Law. The Amir must, therefore, be obeyed even when he is “unjust”. Importantly, obedience to the Amir is also seen as key to the Taliban’s unity and, as one member explains, “our success rests on staying united”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other areas, Taliban have claimed that some policy decisions were dictated less by their own convictions than by the desire to counter propaganda claims from IS-K that the Taliban have sold out to the West. This could of course be an excuse to justify policy shifts that many Taliban officials might find it difficult to justify otherwise, such as the suspension of women’s rights to education. There are, nonetheless, cases where this perceived vulnerability might have genuinely contributed to reshaping policy. In interviews with low-level officials of the Taliban Emirate in 2021–23, the Taliban clearly appeared to be concerned about some of their disgruntled members being attracted to IS-K. One example of this potentially having influenced policy is the decision to fully apply Sharia Law in criminal matters and the growing rigidity shown towards the Shia community from summer 2023 onwards, as Taliban failure to implement Sharia Law and the group’s courteous relations with the Shia community had been two key points of IS-K propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessing the role of ideology in Taliban policymaking also requires consideration of the issue of intra-Taliban competition. While there are certainly many ultra-conservative ulema (senior clerics) within the Taliban, it is far from clear that the Amir is ideologically aligned with them. His record in 2016–21 was eminently pragmatic – see, for example, his willingness to accept Russian support for the Taliban in 2016, at the peak of the Russian intervention in Syria, despite widespread opposition within the leadership. This raises the issue of to what extent the Amir may be using the fatwas of his ulema to undermine those Taliban leaders who try to bypass his authority, including by reaching out to Western diplomats without his consent (as happened repeatedly in 2021–22). It is worth noting that, typically, suspensions of girls’ education rights came within days of meetings between Taliban officials and Western diplomats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever is driving these rigidities, they are primarily endogenous factors that have had a major impact on how the Taliban interact with the rest of the world, even though they primarily concern the Emirate’s internal affairs. Evolution, or softening, is not impossible, however. The Taliban’s cautious approach towards foreign jihadists based in Afghanistan is an example. In the face of obvious IS-K attempts to attract foreign jihadists away from the Taliban, the Emirate was unwilling to put more than moderate pressure on the Pakistanis of the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), despite very strong demands from Islamabad. The reason appears clear: the TTP’s thousands of fighters could destabilise eastern Afghanistan if they allied with IS-K. However, the Emirate placed the much smaller Uighur and Uzbek jihadist contingents under strict surveillance and then forced them to relocate, estimating that the damage caused by defections to IS-K would be limited, and aiming to win praise from Beijing and Tashkent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other examples. In September 2023, the Taliban responded to an incident in Sweden in which the Qur’an was burned by freezing all Swedish aid activities. One Taliban member commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It may not have been sanctioned by the government, [but] the only option for us is to sanction all Swedish activities. Having done that, we have done our very best to protect the property and personnel of Swedish aid organisations in the country, but we cannot go against the will of the Afghan people who feel badly hurt as a result of [this incident].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, however, the Taliban have taken care not to be seen as promoting mobilisation in favour of Hamas in Gaza, for example, despite the issue being strongly felt by many within their ranks. This can probably be read as a signal to the West. Overall, the impression is of a Taliban leadership that is juggling its political capital, combining a rigid approach on some ideological issues related to internal affairs with considerable pragmatism on other issues, especially those related to the prospects of economic growth. They appear to have judged that dropping any kind of support for jihadist movements abroad will not hurt or impact them much, except in the case of the TTP in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, moreover, that despite their rigidities the Taliban do have a track record of sometimes responding positively to lobbying from NGOs, tribal and local elders, and even neighbouring countries – although at the centre, the rigidities appear harder to negotiate. Low-profile, discreet messaging appears to be more effective in influencing Taliban policymaking, while public statements, threats and ultimatums are generally rejected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;taliban-understandings-of-inclusion&quot;&gt;TALIBAN UNDERSTANDINGS OF INCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater inclusion of a variety of ethnic, religious and political groups in the Taliban government is a key demand not only of Western countries, but also of most neighbouring countries. When the Taliban are asked about inclusion today, they defend themselves by noting that their critics did not seem concerned with inclusion when the Taliban were entirely purged from the state apparatus in 2001. In comparison, they argue, the Taliban’s de facto government has at least retained most officials from the previous regime, such that the ministerial machinery mostly continues to function in the same way as before. In fact, junior officials were largely retained, while senior-level managers have been replaced, which leaves the issue of inclusiveness to a large extent unaddressed. The Taliban say that they are even retaining officials once linked to parties opposed to the Taliban, and that they make every effort to pay the salaries of officials on time (albeit at a considerably reduced rate), while many members of the Taliban themselves experience major delays. There is evidence that civilian officials do get paid, while, according to interviews, salaries to Taliban in the armed forces are often paid irregularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to specific communities, Taliban perceptions often represent an obstacle to a more inclusive government. The Taliban are dismissive about the possibility of ethnic tensions, both within Afghanistan and among the Taliban themselves. Sources quoted Interior Minister Serajuddin Haqqani’s assessment that “there are no racial and linguistic prejudices in the nation and the Islamic Emirate will not allow anyone to do this. People should be assured that there is full unity between the ethnic groups of Afghanistan”. Taliban with whom the authors met claimed to have recently defused conflict between Kuchi nomads and Hazara settlers in Behsud in Wardak province, and noted that they had recently invited Shia leaders, such as two of the most prominent leaders of Shia parties, Karim Khalili and Haji Mohaqeq, to return to Afghanistan. They seemed oblivious to the worsening of relations with the Shia community following clashes during Ashura observances in summer 2023, and to deteriorating relations between Pashtuns on one side and Uzbeks and Tajiks on the other, including among the Taliban themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the Taliban consider any debate about the system of government to be settled. In their view, the Islamic Emirate – an authoritarian system with the Taliban movement at its centre – is the solution, and the so-called “hybrid system”, bringing together elements of the 1990s Emirate and the Islamic Republic or even the monarchy (which was abolished in 1973) – which was still being discussed in the weeks following the Taliban takeover – is no longer under consideration. In reality, however, the Emirate system remains poorly defined, especially with regard to the distribution of powers and governance. Nevertheless, the firmly held belief is that the Islamic Emirate system “served the Taliban well during two decades of war” and, in the words of one contact, the pragmatists find it “difficult to convince leaders that something else might be more suitable for peacetime”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External demands to revisit this issue are considered interference in the internal affairs of the de facto government and are rejected. The Taliban acknowledge that lack of inclusiveness is still a problem, both in private and – more obliquely – in public. But they deny that there is any wish or intent on the part of the Taliban to discriminate against any particular ethnic group. Further, they intend to resolve this lack of inclusiveness in their own way: by incorporating individuals from different communities and rejecting the inclusion of organised groups. Actors such as former president Hamid Karzai and former CEO Dr Abdullah, who have been lobbying for greater political inclusiveness in Kabul, appear marginalised today. Political parties that were promised government positions immediately following the Taliban takeover, such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s Hizb-i Islami, had all but lost hope by October 2022. As of January 2024, there was only a handful of non-Taliban individuals at the top levels of government. An exact head count is difficult, as some avowedly non-Taliban individuals may have entertained discreet relations with the Taliban in the past, as is alleged in relation to Minister of Commerce Nooruddin Azizi and the minister of health, Qalandar Ibad. There are also five deputy ministers with no confirmed links to the Taliban: Sheikh Madar Ali Karimi Bamyani (urban development and land), Abdul Latif Nazari (economy), Hassan Ghiasi (health), Mohammad Azim Sultanzada and Mohammad Bashir (commerce).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seeking-acceptance-as-an-authoritarian-problem-solver&quot;&gt;SEEKING ACCEPTANCE AS AN AUTHORITARIAN “PROBLEM SOLVER”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taliban are aware that much of the wider region is ruled by authoritarian governments. Hence it is likely that they feel there is no particular reason for their own authoritarian regime not to be accepted too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Taliban sources argue that their success in stabilising the Afghan economy derives from their “power to assert sovereignty” against local, factional, sectarian and tribal/ethnic interests. One example of this assertion of sovereignty, a senior figure explained, is the ban on the use of other currencies for trade within Afghanistan. The Taliban also point to their success in banning the production of drugs, including methamphetamine, as a sign of their ability to act as a result of their “assertion of sovereignty”. In other words, the Taliban believe they have demonstrated that their strong-handed approach works in their operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the conservatives and the pragmatists is that in the latter’s view, the Taliban will in practice need to tackle particular issues, such as gender discrimination and inclusiveness – at least to some degree – before achieving full international acceptance, gaining diplomatic recognition and obtaining external aid. The conservatives, on the other hand, believe that to gain international acceptance, the Taliban simply need to demonstrate staying power and the ability to keep Afghanistan together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-implications-for-engagement&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR ENGAGEMENT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attitudes of Western countries towards engaging with the Taliban’s de facto government of Afghanistan vary, although a majority of governments now appear to favour some level of engagement, while staying away from formal recognition. Those governments favouring engagement must contend with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s notions about the West, and the context of mutual distrust and mutual flawed perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Taliban’s determination to retain the Emirate model of government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diverging strategic views among Taliban leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distrust and misperceptions are inevitable after 20 years of war. One such misperception is about the degree to which the Taliban are being “ideological”. Some of what is usually viewed as ideological rigidity are in fact political tactics, which derive from the Taliban’s insecurity or from their internal power struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more substantial and probably more long-term issue is the fact that the Taliban have seemingly given up altogether on political inclusion, which remains a key demand of most Western and neighbouring countries. Similarly, the Taliban do not even try to portray themselves as anything other than authoritarian, and they make it clear that this is not going to change. Therefore, even if in future engagement is unlocked by progress on female education, this engagement will remain limited – especially compared to the billions of dollars of development aid Afghanistan received before 2021 – and so any impact will only be seen in the medium and long term, and will be diluted over time. Another hard reality, however, is that any collapse of the state in Afghanistan, or a deepening economic crisis, would drive hundreds of thousands more Afghans to migrate or seek asylum westwards. This raises the question of how wise it is for European countries to delay engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some positive signalling could be useful to keep doors open and to strengthen the position of those Taliban pragmatists who believe that good relations with Western countries are important for the de facto government. Without such positive signalling, the pragmatists would be left empty handed and condemned to gradual marginalisation. Even small steps could begin a virtuous cycle. For example, helping to address issues such as the refusal of international banks to process payments to and from Afghanistan would involve very little engagement and have disproportionate positive impact, enabling investment into the country. Projects aimed at encouraging or facilitating private investment could similarly improve the diplomatic environment, without necessarily undermining Western demands concerning rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting test is the recent decision of the World Bank to unlock development funds for Afghanistan. The Taliban see this as a potential confidence-building measure. The question is whether Taliban policymakers in Kabul would then be able and willing to reciprocate, at least with some small, symbolic gesture, once funds began gradually translating into projects on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth adding that at the Doha II meeting in February 2024, China, Russia and Iran all supported the Taliban’s rejection of the proposal for a special envoy to Afghanistan, clearly expecting to gain from the failed take-off of Taliban–West relations. It is not clear to what extent Western countries are concerned about the possibility of Afghanistan falling into the orbit of these neighbours, but if they are, this would be one more reason not to delay engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方播國安法生效前片段 黎智英明言會悼念六四&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ud0qopy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（29日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第86日審訊。控方播放黎智英在《國安法》生效之前的受訪片段。在2020年6月的《蘋果日報》宣傳片中，黎智英提及現時年輕人對於中國事務有很大抽離感，更遑論悼念六四，但是黎明言會出來悼念六四，因為如果不滿《國安法》的時候，參與六四集會便是一種表達方式。此外，黎接受外媒訪問時形容特朗普是守信用的人，希望特朗普能對中國實施嚴厲的制裁。他認為美國最有效的制裁措施是凍結中國高級官員的外地銀行戶口，因為他們有很多不光彩的錢（corrupted money）儲存在美國和歐洲的銀行戶口裡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英美國的道德權威是很大籌碼-應以強硬態度對付中共&quot;&gt;黎智英：美國的道德權威是很大籌碼 應以強硬態度對付中共&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放黎智英於2019年7月10日出席美國「保衛民主基金」論壇的片段，黎指很多人會說要與中國進行貿易，不要得罪中國，但是黎認為這種想法完全錯誤和愚蠢。如果中國想有貿易的話，美國的道德權威是很大的籌碼，可以用來與中國談判，對付中共態度應該強硬而非軟弱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎談及與時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧會面，黎憶述他向蓬佩奧說香港人正在為與美國相同的價值抗爭，並且正在敵陣抗爭，需要美國的支持，所以黎籲蓬佩奧和時任美國副總統彭斯：「看！說些鼓勵香港人的說話吧！尤其是年輕人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英籲外國就香港示威發聲表達同情&quot;&gt;黎智英籲外國就香港示威發聲、表達同情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上播放2019年7月15日的《霍士新聞》片段，黎智英受訪時指，如果《逃犯條例》修訂通過，政府便可以把任何人送往中國內地坐監，這亦會削弱香港的法治，如果沒有了法治，香港便會失去國際金融中心地位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指香港有很多年輕人正在前線抗爭，呼籲外國就香港的示威發聲，以及表達同情，亦可以派議員到港，使年輕人知道外國人在支持他們。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在8月再次接受《霍士新聞》訪問，他形容習近平是「人類歷史上最強的獨裁者」，因他利用科技和人臉識別技術來監控人民，被當局針對的人可以被禁止開銀行戶口或前往公眾地方，這是不好的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指美國可以做很多事向中國施壓，要求中國改變，例如停止向中國輸出技術。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指國安法將催毀香港自由希望特朗普能對中國實施嚴厲的制裁&quot;&gt;黎智英指國安法將催毀香港自由、希望特朗普能對中國實施嚴厲的制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在《國安法》生效之前，黎智英接受《彭博》訪問時指，特朗普說過如果香港實施《國安法》，「他會認真地做一些事」；黎表示他不知道特朗普對中國實施制裁會有多嚴厲，但是他促請美國實施制裁。黎形容特朗普是守信用的人，希望特朗普能對中國實施嚴厲的制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎表示，他認為美國最有效的制裁措施是凍結中國高級官員的外地銀行戶口，因為他們有很多不光彩的錢（corrupted money）儲存在美國和歐洲的銀行戶口裡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主持人問《國安法》來臨，黎智英最擔心什麼。黎則指擔心「我們要失去這裡的傳媒」，無論寫什麼東西都會被指控煽動、顛覆國家。黎又擔心所有香港人失去自由，他們只能選擇移民離開，又或者留下及反抗，香港人沒有其他選擇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，《國安法》將會催毀所有英國殖民地時期留下來的遺產，包括各項自由，他認為全世界應該採取任何行動去制止中國，不能坐以待斃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英明言會悼念六四是一種反抗&quot;&gt;黎智英明言會悼念六四：是一種反抗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另播放2020年6月2日的《蘋果日報》宣傳片，當中黎智英指現時年輕人對於中國的事有很大抽離感，更遑論悼念六四，但是黎明言會出來悼念六四，因為如果不滿《國安法》的時候，參與六四集會便是一種表達方式。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在另一段《蘋果日報》宣傳片中，黎以英語說訂閱對於一間自由和獨立的傳媒而言是很重要，籲美國人支持，愈多美國人訂閱的話，便能夠減低中國打壓《蘋果》的機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英不認為美國會出賣香港特朗普會以一連串制裁作為選舉策略&quot;&gt;黎智英不認為美國會出賣香港、特朗普會以一連串制裁作為選舉策略&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月10日的《自由亞洲電台》片段中，黎智英受訪時指《國安法》即將來臨，移民、將資金轉移至外國等成為了香港人之間的熱門話題。他指如果美國能對中國實施實際和完整制裁的話，有可能就算人大通過《國安法》，香港也不會執行，又或者《國安法》條文可能減弱、「唔會做到咁辣」，因此得到美國和特朗普的支持是很重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎認為，特朗普會以一連串的制裁作為連任美國總統的選舉策略，從而爭取人民的共鳴和支持，所以黎稱暫時是樂觀的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;節目主持人問黎，很多人指美國只是利用香港，美國會否出賣香港。黎則表示，不覺得自由民主的社會會出賣與她價值觀相同的香港，而且中美冷戰不會是一年、兩年的事，而是十年、二十年的事，亦是意識形態之戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又表示他不會離開香港，因他的一切包括家人、同事、生意等都是這個地方給予他的，所以他打算留下來至最後一刻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;16人不認罪 明日裁決&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Xi5nOjI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47名組織及參與初選的民主派，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，經歷118日審訊，將於明日（30日）在西九龍裁判法院（暫代高院）裁決。距離61萬人投票的民主派初選近4年，法庭明將就控方指控被告串謀取得立會過半後，無差別否決預算案，迫使特首解散立法會及辭職，意圖顛覆國家政權，作出裁定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;根據《國安法》第22條，一旦顛覆國家政權罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判監10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下，故法官就被告參與程度及角色的裁定，將會影響判刑。值得留意的是，政府去年修例，就沒有陪審團的高院國安案，若有被告罪脫，律政司可緊接提出擬上訴，法庭可應申請，命令無罪被告還柙或准予保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案目前共34人還柙，其中32人已還柙至今逾3年2個月，料裁決後罪成被告將與認罪被告另外擇日一併求情及判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;正庭延伸庭共設410公眾席&quot;&gt;正庭、延伸庭共設410公眾席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天早上10時於西九龍法院3號法庭進行聆訊，司法機構表示，將於明天早上9時15分派發合共410張公眾席入庭籌，其中正庭有43席，另外4個設有聆訊直播的法庭及延伸區域，則有367席，另設約100張後備籌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6人不准保釋-4人還柙逾1180日&quot;&gt;6人不准保釋 4人還柙逾1,180日&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案16名不認罪被告為：鄭達鴻、楊雪盈、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、黃碧雲、施德來、何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄、柯耀林、李予信、余慧明及吳政亨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其中6人正在還柙，當中何桂藍、林卓廷、梁國雄和吳政亨4人，至裁決日已還柙逾3年2個月、逾1,180日；至於鄒家成和余慧明一度獲准保釋，但因違反保釋條件而遭撤銷擔保，已分別還柙逾2年9個月及2年7個月，逾970日及950日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;爭議無差別否決是否非法手段被告有否達協議&quot;&gt;爭議無差別否決是否「非法手段」、被告有否達協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案由指定法官陳慶偉、李運騰及陳仲衡審理，是《國安法》後最大規模的案件，亦是「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪首案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;本案指控被告串謀取得立會過半後，無差別否決預算案，迫使特首解散立法會及辭職，意圖顛覆國家政權。控辯雙方爭議無差別否決預算案是否構成控罪中的「非法手段」，及被告有否達成協議無差別否決、是否串謀一分子、及是否有意圖顛覆國家政權等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;刑期三級制-最高可囚終身&quot;&gt;刑期三級制 最高可囚終身&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16名不認罪被告中，僅發起「三投三不投」的吳政亨被視為組織者，其餘則為參與者。根據《國安法》第22條，一旦罪成，「首要分子或罪行重大」可判處10年以上至終身監禁；「積極參加者」可判監3至10年；「其他參加者」則判監3年以下、拘役或者管制。因此法官就被告參與程度及角色的裁決，將會影響判刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;律政司可緊接提擬上訴申罪脫被告還柙&quot;&gt;律政司可緊接提擬上訴、申罪脫被告還柙&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;值得留意的是，被告即使獲裁定無罪，律政司亦可緊接提出擬上訴，法庭可應申請將無罪被告羈押。政府去年修訂《刑事訴訟程序條例》，針對高等法院原訟庭沒有陪審團、由3名指定法官審理的國安案件，法例列明如法官就被告作出無罪裁決，律政司司長可「緊接」通知法庭擬提出上訴，法庭則可應律政司司長的申請，命令將該被告羈留扣押，以待上訴庭作出裁定，或准予該被告保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法例亦列明，法庭處理保釋申請時，受限於《國安法》第42條的保釋門檻，意味除非法官有充足理由相信，被告不會繼續實施危害國安的行為，否則不得准予保釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;首提堂至開審歷時近兩年-審訊118天&quot;&gt;首提堂至開審歷時近兩年 審訊118天&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民主派初選於2020年7月舉行，其後立法會選舉延期一年，47人於2021年1月6日被以「顛覆國家政權」罪拘捕，同年2月28日被要求提早報到，被落案起訴「串謀顛覆國家政權」。47人於3月1日首度提堂，經歷6次提訊日及多次提堂後於2022年7月正式交付高院，當中共31人認罪，包括組織者戴耀廷和區諾軒，另16人不認罪受審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件今年2月6日於西九龍法院開審，原定審期90天，最終歷時近10個月、審訊118天，於同年12月4日完成結案陳詞。當中控方案情花了共58日，被指為組織者的區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟以控方證人身分作供44天，認罪的林景楠亦應辯方要求被傳召作盤問。此外，控方傳召在新西協調會議拍片的匿名證人X先生作供，及應辯方要求傳召6名警員及1名選舉主任作盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後以6日處理「共謀者原則」爭議及被告申請毋須答辯的中段陳詞，法官裁定該原則不適用於《國安法》前的言行，及所有被告表證成立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方案情則用了51日，不認罪的16人，除吳政亨、楊雪盈、黃碧雲、林卓廷、梁國雄和柯耀林6人外，其餘10人：鄭達鴻、彭卓棋、何啟明、劉偉聰、施德來、何桂藍、陳志全、鄒家成、李予信、余慧明均有出庭作供，至於吳政亨及柯耀林則傳召辯方證人。案件最後以3天完成結案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;31人認罪&quot;&gt;31人認罪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於認罪的31人，包括：戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、鍾錦麟、袁嘉蔚、梁晃維、徐子見、岑子杰、毛孟靜、馮達浚、劉澤鋒、黃之鋒、譚文豪、李嘉達、譚得志、胡志偉、朱凱廸、張可森、黃子悅、尹兆堅、郭家麒、吳敏兒、譚凱邦、劉頴匡、楊岳橋、范國威、呂智恆、岑敖暉、王百羽、伍健偉及林景楠。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;認罪被告中，僅呂智恆、林景楠和黃子悅獲保釋，惟黃另涉理大衝突案，承認暴動判囚37個月。其餘被告均還柙至今逾3年2個月。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英指自由經濟本來無分「黃藍」 但黃色經濟圈會隨政府鎮壓而繼續存在&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xfMIeqs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（28日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第85日審訊。在辯方要求下，庭上播放多段黎智英直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段。有觀眾問黎以生意人的角度來看，黃色經濟圈是否可行。黎認為當香港愈來愈被鎮壓，黃色經濟圈便會一直存在，而且愈來愈重要；又指自由經濟本來並無分「黃藍」，但是黃色經濟圈這個「畸型的經濟」會因為政府的鎮壓而繼續存在。黎另指「警隊已經坐大到無法無天」，認為中共的鎮壓政策如果不改變，警隊的形象也不會改變，愈來愈猖狂、愈坐大，這是無法改變的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指外界對香港的關注是救星&quot;&gt;黎智英指外界對香港的關注是「救星」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年11月29日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目中，黎智英表示，他自己愈身陷險境，便愈能有效地引起外界對香港的關注，並形容「這是我們的救星（saving grace）」，因為香港實在太細小，不足以對抗中國這個巨人。黎又表示，他不能夠退縮，他必需繼續，使其他人也跟著繼續。「如果我退縮，他們也會退縮，那我們便會完蛋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有觀眾問黎，香港未來會否變成「一國一制」，如果會的話怎麼辦、香港還有什麼價值。黎指香港的公務員和傳媒自由度轉差，他認為「一國一制就要嚟㗎喇，但唔代表我哋要跪喺度接受佢，我哋一定要企喺度」，並且保衛香港的法治和自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一名觀眾談及警隊，黎則回應指「警隊已經坐大到無法無天」，最近不時出現警察犯罪的新聞，又指警隊的權力愈大，內部文化便會愈腐敗、愈猖狂。他認為中共的鎮壓政策要改變，否則警隊的形象不會改變，愈來愈猖狂、愈坐大，這是無法改變的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指自由經濟本來無分黃藍-但黃色經濟圈會因為政府的鎮壓而繼續存在&quot;&gt;黎智英指自由經濟本來無分「黃藍」 但黃色經濟圈會因為政府的鎮壓而繼續存在&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另有觀眾問黎以生意人的角度，黃色經濟圈是否可行。黎指，只要打壓存在，黃色經濟圈便會繼續存在；但是如果打壓停止，黃藍之間的衝突便會解決。黎認為黃色經濟圈會持續存在，因為當香港愈來愈被鎮壓，黃色經濟圈便會一直存在，而且愈來愈重要，除非香港有一國兩制和法治。黎又指，自由經濟本來並無分「黃藍」，但是黃色經濟圈這個「畸型的經濟」會因為政府的鎮壓而繼續存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指美國與中國貿易時應考慮中國人權法治狀況&quot;&gt;黎智英指美國與中國貿易時應考慮中國人權法治狀況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年12月1日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目中，美國學者 Dan Blumenthal 指中共獨裁統治不只影響中國，更會波及全世界。黎智英回應指，獨裁政權的特質之一，是它們內部愈弱、愈多內部問題，便需要在外面樹立更多敵人，來維持自己的統治地位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，拜登政府應該察覺到，美國需要以強硬而非柔弱的手腕去處理中國問題。他認為當美國與中國有貿易往來的時候，美國應該以中國改善人權、法治等作為先決條件，以及在貿易中連繫香港和新疆維吾爾族的問題。如果外國容許中國的經濟不斷發展，但同時容許中國堅持其價值觀，「我們便會完蛋。」他希望外國能持續改變中國，使中國民主化。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指若習近平繼續執政-香港或變成中國城市比新疆更大鑊&quot;&gt;黎智英指若習近平繼續執政 香港或變成中國城市、比新疆更「大鑊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在觀眾提問環節中，有觀眾問香港會否被同化，成為與中國差不多的城市。黎表示，如果沒有一個奇蹟出現，而習近平繼續做一個「永遠的主席」，「我哋就仆街㗎喇，我哋就冇機會保持到特殊嘅地位。」黎指屆時香港不但變成中國一個城市，「可能我哋變成咗新疆都唔定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎續指，香港人的價值觀對中國而言很危險，如果這些價值觀瀰漫到中國，使中國人知道這些價值觀，對中共政權來說是非常危險。黎又指新疆穆斯林的價值觀只是宗教層面，然而香港人的價值觀對中共來說更加危險，香港未來有可能成為與中國差不多的城市，甚或乎「比新疆更大鑊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有年輕觀眾表示正在考慮赴澳洲發展，問黎智英意見。黎表示，如果對方能夠適應澳洲的生活的話，他應該留在澳洲定居。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另有觀眾問黎智英作為一名天主教徒，有什麼說話想跟時任特首林鄭說。黎說，希望林鄭可以多些祈禱和多些聆聽上帝的話語，這對她自己和香港而言都是好事，因為林鄭顯然地沒有聆聽到上帝的聲音。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英在國安法下行事必須非常小心-當局可能會利用任何材料來控告&quot;&gt;黎智英：在《國安法》下行事必須非常小心 當局可能會利用任何材料來控告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播放2020年12月1日的《霍士新聞》片段，黎智英受訪指他們正在控告《大公報》，又指《大公報》是中共的喉舌。他提到自己身負3宗案件，在《國安法》下行事必須非常小心，因為當局可能會利用任何材料來控告他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在訪問中亦批評《國安法》凌駕《基本法》和普通法。香港要保持國際金融中心地位，需要得到商人的信任，背後需要有法治，但是在「人治」下金融中心地位不能存在。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另播放2020年12月1日《霍士新聞》訪問美軍前副參謀長 Jack Keane 的片段。惟法官李素蘭指，在這影片中看不到黎智英。控方指影片純粹想顯示 Jack Keane 的立場。法官李運騰質疑，看不到這影片與本案的關係，黎與 Jack Keane 的對談影片過去在庭上已經播放過，從中亦可知道 Jack Keane 的立場。法官杜麗冰則指控方可在結案陳詞中處理相關議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 29 May, South Africans will go to the polls in what is likely to be the country’s most important election since the advent of a non-racial democracy in 1994. It could be the moment when the country shifts from one-party dominance to coalition rule of one or another stripe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This election occurs amid a backdrop of low economic growth, rising unemployment (which in its broad definition affects 42% of South Africa’s 61 million people, nearly half of whom survive meagre state welfare) and rampant criminality. For some it is a chance to remind the African National Congress (ANC) – Africa’s oldest liberation movement – why it is in power, and how the majority of South Africans now believe it is the ANC, and not apartheid, that is to blame for the country’s woes. Much was expected from Cyril Ramaphosa when he took over from Jacob Zuma as president in 2017, supposedly bringing down the curtain on the era of “state capture” and rampant corruption which had cost the country by Ramaphosa’s own admission over R500 billion, or $28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this result, several things will have to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one thing, participation in South Africa’s democracy is weakening, and even this “watershed” election might not fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A yawning chasm of apathy has opened up in South Africa over the last three democratic decades. Fewer and fewer adults of voting age are participating in formal politics; youth registration is abysmally low, just as unemployment among this cohort is shockingly high at over 60%. This pattern of non-participation has grown as the government’s capacity to deliver has diminished and corruption has risen. It is fuelled by a deep cynicism, a view that “voting won’t change anything”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing illustrates this better than the fact that more South Africans voted in the national election of 1994 – some 19,533,498 – than 25 years later in 2019, when only 17,672,851 cast their ballots, despite the population growing by 18 million in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 30 years, only one of the arms of democratic government, the judiciary, has done its job reasonably well, holding the line against Zuma’s blatant attempts to run roughshod over independent institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the judicial role has not been the perfect story. The weakness – and politicization – of the judicial system must bear its share of the blame for the establishment of a culture of impunity. The failure to prosecute those identified as corrupt by the Zondo Commission’s investigation into the era of state capture has happened on its watch. Perhaps this is unsurprising given that Ramaphosa served as Zuma’s deputy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the judiciary has comparatively held firm, the legislature and especially the Executive manifestly has failed to deliver on the democratic promise. Dominated by the government, parliament was admonished for closing ranks on Zuma and it would later cover up for his successor, Ramaphosa, putting aside recommendations by its own commission that there be an investigation into the mysterious appearance of tens of thousands of US dollars in Ramaphosa’s couch. Just as there have been dark spots in the judiciary’s record, however, there have been bright spots for parliament given its role in continuing to highlight – amid some theatre – Zuma’s malfeasance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is more. The Executive has presided over infrastructural decay and a vast network of crooked contracts, the latter laid bare in excruciating detail by the Zondo Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For some the election is a chance to remind the ANC why it is in power, and how the majority of South Africans now believe it is the ANC, and not apartheid, that is to blame for the country’s woes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of moving to strengthen and grow South Africa’s democracy and democratic participation, the Executive has apparently been happy to see the last of disgruntled voters and instead opted for apathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in another alarming development, it has begun to turn its back on the democratic world in favour of a potpourri of dictatorships, autocracies and theocracies with abysmal human rights records and a penchant for imprisoning and murdering critics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When South Africa joined BRICS, it become one of three democratic countries – Brazil and India being the other two – in an organisation dominated by Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet when the opportunity came for South Africa to lead the expansion of BRICS at the 2023 summit held in Sandton, Johannesburg, what did it do? It overlooked Africa’s two largest democracies – Nigeria and Kenya – and instead chose to extend BRICS to Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Ethiopia and Egypt, none of which can remotely be described as democratic – thus turning the body from a forum for enhanced trade and cheaper debt into one antagonistic towards democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an alarming sign that democracy is no longer the loadstar of South Africa, which nowadays prefers the company of autocrats. New friends have included Iran’s hardline former president, Ebrahim Raisi – the first leader Pretoria consulted after the 7 October terror assault on Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Raisi died in a helicopter crash earlier this month, Ramaphosa said of a man labelled the “Butcher of Tehran”: “This is an extraordinary, unthinkable tragedy that has claimed a remarkable leader of a nation with whom South Africa enjoys strong bilateral relations”. There was not even a fig leaf such as “although we may have disagreed about democracy”, nor any mention of the thousands imprisoned and executed under Iran’s violent theocratic regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there is a threat not only in terms of the deterioration of South Africa’s already ineffective governance, but worsening policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are those on the ballot paper such as the MK Party, led by former president Zuma and ranked third in most polls, which are openly in favour of the repeal of the constitution. Others want it to be amended and limited in scope. Some of these parties might end up as minor partners in a new coalition government should the ANC choose to continue its populist trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lends itself to four scenarios around the twin-tracks of policy and governance, which we have mapped out in “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly – Scenarios for South Africa’s Uncertain Future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first – the “Good” scenario – is the only one which provides light at the end of the tunnel, and centres on the formation of a centrist pact built on the opposition’s Multi-Party Charter and the pragmatic parts of the ANC, which together could command as much as 75% of the vote according to the latest surveys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is worth asking whether 2024 could be South Africa’s last democratic election, given all the signs: authoritarian friendships, shady funding, leadership impunity, rising violent crime and scant regard for parliamentary niceties&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The realisation of this scenario would require South Africa’s establishment to swallow some humble pie, as well as the emergence of the much-talked about but hitherto invisible “good ANC” which would place the majority of South Africans – and not just an increasingly out-of-touch elite fascinated with power and its tantalising economic proceeds – at the centre of policy and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this scenario is part of the way to being achieved thanks to key provinces. It seems certain – or as certain as one can be ahead of elections – that coalitions will run Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, which together with the Western Cape comprise nearly two-thirds of South Africa’s GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This provincial dimension may be just the segue needed to broker a wider national deal that puts the country first. And it is just such a deal that could save the Ramaphosa presidency from a legacy of disappointing indecision and governance failure that may otherwise end in a catastrophic tilt to the populist promise of redistribution. Of course, this “Good” arrangement comes with dangers – not least the danger of the ANC swallowing up the opposition once it has got its breath back, just as Robert Mugabe’s ZANU-PF weakened the opposition MDC in Zimbabwe after their 2009 unity government leading to a major slide in its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But overall, this is the only coalition alternative offering an improvement in governance and policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second – the “Bad” scenario – comes in the form of an “Animal Farm” nightmare, where the ANC hooks up with populists who want the constitution and/or private ownership of anything to be scrapped. The ANC, in combination with either the EFF or the MK Party – or either of the latter’s mutant offshoots – would see a rapid descent into populism. Ramaphosa’s trademark dithering would pave the way for these populist forces to seize the public agenda and push him around. In this scenario, for tourists coming for a cheap holiday or businesspeople seeking a quick flip, South Africa “won’t seem such a bad place” – save for those actually living and working there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is more likely than most think. The ANC has already flirted with abandoning private property rights; it has launched a R1 trillion National Health Insurance scheme without any funding plan, and there are several powerful members of its leadership who openly desire this outcome. In this scenario it is worth asking whether 2024 could be South Africa’s last democratic election, given all the signs: authoritarian friendships, shady funding, leadership impunity, rising violent crime and scant regard for parliamentary niceties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’ll never happen to us” and “we’re too big to fail” are among the famous last words of many other regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third, “Ugly” scenario can be summed up as more of the same, with the ANC squeaking over the line at just over 50% of the vote and then continuing with the status quo ante. This would mean the prospect of little reform in the human and institutional software required for a modern economy, given the inherent loss of rent, while managing a weak fiscus as the effects of its unsubtle pivot to populism in the form of the signing into law of the National Health Insurance scheme take hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final scenario – the “Fistful of Cents” – would see the ANC fall below 50% but with sufficient votes to form a coalition with one or two smaller parties, possibly including the PA or the IFP. While policy can be expected to remain much the same, this scenario could only lead to even worse governance given the inevitably highly transactional relationships that are likely to be reached with smaller parties, resulting in only limited reform at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When South Africans go to the polls, they will be celebrating three decades of democracy. But they will also be carrying a responsibility to protect that democracy, before voting itself becomes a charade.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英指中國視香港人為異族 有如對待新疆穆斯林方式&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CwrqiZR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（27日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第84日審訊。在辯方要求下，庭上播放多段黎智英直播節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」片段。黎智英與前港督彭定康對談之中，黎指：「我們要對抗中國，如果我們不改變她的話，以中國的經濟實力，我們便會被改變。」如果不對抗中國的話，世界將永無寧日。黎又指國家主席習近平將香港視為異族地區（alien area），視香港人為異族（alien），正如中國對待新疆穆斯林的方式，因為香港人所擁抱的價值，包括民主、自由和人權等，對中共而言是非常危險的，香港將變成與新疆一樣的城市。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指如果不對抗中國-世界將永無寧日&quot;&gt;黎智英指如果不對抗中國 世界將永無寧日&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年11月13日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目中，嘉賓前港督彭定康指中共是香港自由民主的威脅，如果想中國改變的話，要持續為香港勇敢走出來。彭定康指中國的思考方式與西方國家不同，他憶述在任時與時任國務院港澳辦主任魯平溝通的過程中，發覺魯平不明白為何需要「法治」（rule of law），中國認為只需要「以法治國」（rule by law），然而法治是民主社會的基石。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英提到中國對人民施予洗腦，顯示中國治國方式過時，並且想為所欲為。黎指：「我們要對抗中國，如果我們不改變她的話，以中國的經濟實力，我們便會被改變。」他又指，如果不對抗中國的話，世界將永無寧日。黎指中國並不是一個孤島，她需要面向世界，而外國需要堅持他們的價值，並逐漸地改變中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指習近平視香港人為異族-香港將變成新疆一樣的城市&quot;&gt;黎智英指習近平視香港人為異族 香港將變成新疆一樣的城市&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有觀眾問黎認為聯合國可以怎樣幫助香港。黎表示對於聯合國不感到樂觀，因為很多國家都站在中國那一邊。他反而認為日本和印度等民主國家將會與香港走在一起及支持香港，惟對於聯合國則不樂觀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎批評習近平只想將自己個人形象凌駕在中國之上，另將香港視為異族地區（alien area），視香港人為異族（alien），一如中國對待新疆穆斯林的方式，因為香港人所擁抱的價值，包括民主、自由和人權等，對中共而言是非常危險的。黎指香港將變成與新疆一樣的城市，因為中共對待香港人就像對待新疆穆斯林般。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英稱面臨風險越大-越能吸引外界對香港關注&quot;&gt;黎智英稱面臨風險越大 越能吸引外界對香港關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年11月19日的節目中，主持人問黎為何仍身處香港，「這個人是否瘋了？」黎則表示，他現時離開不到，因護照被扣留；但即使有機會離開，他也選擇不離開，因為當他面臨的風險越大，便越能有效地吸引外界對香港的關注，形容這是他一生中最好的時候。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎提到新上任的美國總統拜登對於中國採取「多邊主義」手法，多個國家一同應對中國，但是整體立場便會削弱，所以黎不相信「多邊主義」。就拜登而言，他認為單一國家未必能夠能付中國這個巨人，所以黎相信拜登未來會繼續採用「多邊主義」，但是他相信特朗普時代訂下的對華政策方針不會輕易改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有觀眾問國際社會可以做什麼。黎智英表示，國際的支援是很重要，現時市民不能上街遊行，立法會失去多元聲音，「香港可以講係喺窒息之中」，所以新聞減少，如果沒有新聞的話，「如果呢個世界忘記咗我哋呢，我哋就會好大鑊㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英指習近平比毛澤東更危險-因現今中國是強大競爭對手&quot;&gt;黎智英指習近平比毛澤東更危險 因現今中國是強大競爭對手&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另播放2020年11月20日的節目片段，當日嘉賓為以色列前副總理 Nathan Sharansky。黎表示，他被安排有如此的身位去做「如此美妙的事情」，他的人生並不是關乎自己，而是關乎更加多的人，當其他人見到他不退縮的時候，其他人便不會退縮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2020年11月26日的節目，嘉賓為美國退休軍官 Jack Keane。黎指習近平比毛澤東更加危險，因毛澤東時代的中國十分貧窮，但是現在中國經濟起飛，是一個強大的競爭對手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎問 Jack Keane 對於拜登的「多邊主義」手法有什麼觀點，各國都有自己的主張，便會沖淡或削弱了整體的立場，美國對於中國便會不夠強硬。Jack Keane 則指就算採取「多邊主義」手法，美國也應該擔任世界秩序的領袖，在各國間作主導角色。他又指在疫情期間外國想與中國合作，避免造成不必要的緊張，他理解這種做法，但是個人不認同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎問 Jack Keane，香港可以如何引起拜登政府的關注。Jack Keane 則指：「你的聲音和其他人的聲音都很重要。」他指美國需要了解世界正在發生什麼事，並需要力量和道德勇氣持續下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審，控方將繼續播放影片。除了辯方要求播放的片段之外，控方擬播放多17段片段，部份涵蓋《國安法》未生效的時段，由於5月30及31日因初選案而不會開庭，預料需播放影片至下星期。&lt;/p&gt;
