&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme included high-level speakers from more than 20 countries and covered topics including international law and norms, responsible use and development of tools and technologies – including AI – and the responsibility of states in conducting and responding to cyber operations and incidents. The event was part of RUSI’s ongoing Global Partnership for Responsible Cyber Behaviour (GP-RCB) work. This initiative is dedicated to mapping practical understandings of responsible cyber behaviour (RCB) by conducting evidence-based research and connecting experts from different sectors and regions to reflect the diversity of views on the topic. Except for keynote speakers and the final discussion, we have not attributed panel speakers’ remarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction-a-global-perspective-on-rcb&quot;&gt;Introduction: A Global Perspective on RCB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an increasingly volatile and interconnected global landscape, malicious activities within cyberspace present an ever-growing threat to international stability and security. From cybercrime and the misuse of emerging technologies to the proliferation of commercial hacking tools and state-sanctioned cyber operations, the challenge is multifaceted. Over the past two decades, governments worldwide have engaged in multilateral negotiations to develop norms that guide RCB. While progress has been made – as reflected in the 11 non-binding norms on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace reaffirmed by UN members in 2021 – difficulties remain in achieving international consensus on how responsibility is understood and operationalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an environment where influence and control lie beyond the sole purview of government authorities, a comprehensive, whole-of-society approach to RCB is necessary. This entails fostering cross-regional dialogue and multistakeholder collaboration to advance diverse, transparent and inclusive understandings of responsibility. This includes the need to widen global conversations on RCB to stakeholders beyond the state, in ways that reflect the many nuances of how and where responsibility is enacted. Key dimensions of this relate to how responsibility is understood internationally, domestically and operationally across different cultural, political and geographical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To promote debate and help foster a collective understanding of responsibility in cyberspace, the GP-RCB is focused on mapping practical understandings of RCB by conducting and delivering evidence-based research. It does this by connecting experts from different sectors and regions to reflect upon the diversity of views on the topic, providing an international platform that brings together more than 80 scholars, experts, think tanks and other academic institutions for dialogue, debate and research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inaugural Securing Cyberspace Conference, organised by RUSI and the GP-RCB, took place on 9 October 2024 at 61 Whitehall in London, convening global experts from academia, industry, government and civil society to explore challenges under the theme “Responsible Cyber Behaviour in Practice: A Global View”. Marking the first anniversary of the GP-RCB, the conference underscored the importance of diverse, inclusive dialogue in shaping the future of cyberspace governance. It aimed to bridge regional perspectives by connecting the research community, showcasing ongoing research, and facilitating insight on what RCB looks like across different operational contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-special-message-from-izumi-nakamitsu&quot;&gt;A Special Message from Izumi Nakamitsu&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the conference, RUSI received a “special message” from UN Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu that underscored the urgency of advancing global dialogues on RCB. In her message, Nakamitsu emphasised the importance of perseverance in face of geopolitical challenges, remarking that “Some may be tempted to conclude that the circumstances of the moment are not conducive to progress, but, in fact, it is precisely in moments like these that we must redouble our efforts in support of the framework for responsible state behaviour in the use of ICTs [Information and Communication Technologies].” The statement resonated with the overarching theme of SC2024, which saw experts address the complexities of advancing RCB in a world where political tensions and culturally divergent understandings of responsibility persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-conference-programme&quot;&gt;The Conference Programme&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference was made up of a mix of session formats. Following a ministerial opening, SC2024 began with two panels: one reflecting on the viability of multilateralism in advancing international cyber security commitments in an increasingly tense geopolitical context; and the other on state responsibility in the development of capabilities and conduct of cyber operations. Panel discussions were followed by workshops covering three dimensions of responsibility: international, domestic and operational. During the workshops, participants engaged with thought leadership, diverse perspectives and cross-sectoral collaboration to map diverse and practice-based understandings of RCB. The conference closed with a panel on innovative research and critical perspectives on ensuring RCB, which highlighted evolving work by GP-RCB researchers, and a “fireside chat” reflection on how to connect the discussion on responsible AI with cyber security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-uk-view-of-rcb&quot;&gt;A UK View of RCB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Doughty MP, minister of state for Europe, North America and Overseas Territories in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, delivered the new government’s first speech on cyber security at SC2024. Doughty emphasised the critical importance of enhancing cyber security and fostering collaborative partnerships across UK sectors. He noted that “there is no national security, no economic security without cyber security”, underscoring the essential links between robust cyber measures and national stability. Acknowledging the increasing reliance on digital infrastructure in areas such as banking, healthcare and defence, the minister emphasised that, as “the stakes are higher than ever”, a unified response from all stakeholders is imperative, to counteract the escalating threats posed by state actors and criminal organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his address, the minister identified three key themes guiding the government’s approach to RCB: the necessity of partnerships; a commitment to RCB, including principles of transparency, inclusion and accountability; and the importance of a whole-of-society approach. He drew parallels with the successful collaboration that resulted in the cracking of the Enigma code during the Second World War, stating that “it’s only through solid, respectful, mutual, beneficial partnerships that we can fight back”, and emphasising how today’s cyber threats require unity. The minister underscored the need for transparency to build trust and facilitate cooperation, reflecting the UK’s aim of advancing responsibility through a holistic approach, fostering innovation, supporting underrepresented groups in technology, and engaging with global partners to combat cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;panel-1-fragmentation-or-like-mindedness-rethinking-rcb-in-the-age-of-minilateralism&quot;&gt;Panel 1: Fragmentation or Like-mindedness? Rethinking RCB in the Age of Minilateralism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UN negotiations on responsible state behaviour have provided an important framework for thinking about the applicability of international law in cyberspace, as well as creating a corpus of non-binding norms that can inform customary state practice. Notwithstanding such developments, current geopolitical divides and the elevation of cyber security within national security agendas have created a tense and protracted environment for the future of UN dialogues on this matter. In contrast to these larger forums, initiatives such as the Hiroshima Dialogue, the International Counter Ransomware Initiative and others have focused instead on promoting space for discussions of specific themes, and offering platforms for dialogue of the like-minded. In view of this, SC2024 invited government representatives and international experts to critically reflect on fragmentation and like-mindedness in global cyber security governance, specifically addressing the question of whether concrete discussions on RCB remain viable in an age of minilateralism – that is, in an age in which governments have sought to tackle international problems and pursue mutual goals in smaller groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-new-diplomatic-strategy&quot;&gt;A New Diplomatic Strategy?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel opened with a keynote address by James Lewis, Senior Vice President at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which focused on the evolving diplomatic cyber landscape, particularly in the context of great power competition. Lewis argued that the era of international cooperation on cyber norms, which “peaked” in 2015, has ended, with global relations now driven by rivalry among major powers such as the US, China and Russia. This shift, according to Lewis, means that “responsible state behaviour must be balanced against the realities of competition”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lewis emphasised that the fragmentation of the international system, driven by geopolitical realignments, has heightened tensions and disrupted progress on collaborative frameworks for cyberspace. He pointed to the absence of structured dialogues between major powers as a critical factor exacerbating this fragmentation. “There are no regular negotiations or agreed framework for talks between the United States and China, much less with Russia, as was the case in the Cold War,” he remarked, underscoring the challenges this poses for fostering stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical takeaway from Lewis’s keynote was the importance of governments creating new engagement strategies to manage the growing risks in cyberspace and its governance. Lewis advocated for a new democratic diplomatic strategy that accepts fragmentation but focuses on creating accountability and engagement strategies with both neutral and adversarial states. As he noted, “fragmentation, while unavoidable, can be managed to reduce the chance of conflict and to lay the foundation for a more secure future”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;panel-discussion&quot;&gt;Panel Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent panellists focused on providing insights into the different elements that shape governments’ decisions and incentives to engage in discussions on RCB. While panellists recognised the importance of multilateralism in fostering an inclusive platform where global voices can be heard – a sentiment embodied by institutions like the UN’s Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) – such frameworks also faced the criticism that they were slow and at risk of creating echo chambers. Specifically, one panellist raised the issue of there being a “bloc mentality” in multilateral fora, an issue that had prompted countries such as Brazil to not only call for confidence-building measures across political divides in the OEWG, but also support the establishment of a permanent mechanism for regular institutional dialogue on cyber security in the UN. This view echoed broader concerns that, without a unified approach, disparate initiatives between great powers could fracture global cyber governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minilateralism, on the other hand, was highlighted as indispensable for operationalising cyber security initiatives in diverse cultural and geographic regions. A panellist drew on Switzerland’s participation in the Pall Mall Process to counter the proliferation of commercially available cyber intrusion tools as an example of how smaller, focused coalitions can complement broader multilateral discussions. Panellists recognised that these coalitions allow for quicker action and sharper focus, especially in contexts where geopolitical divides slow down multilateral efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The African context added further nuance to the global conversation, with one participant highlighting how, despite African states recognising the value of multilateral platforms, there is growing sentiment that these forums often overlook regional priorities. The panellist specifically identified the need for a “Common African Position” on cyber norms, as a reflection of the continent’s desire for its priorities to be acknowledged, something that the rigid voting structures of international organisations often undermine. Similar conclusions were drawn by a panellist focused on RCB in the Indo-Pacific, which has seen India – in the absence of a pan-regional organisation in its vicinity – participate in various minilateral engagements including the Quad and the I2U2 Group. The panellist specifically identified geopolitical polarisation as a factor driving India’s foreign policy towards minilateral engagements, where a lack of understanding or sense of cooperation between major powers inhibits efforts towards global consensus building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than seeing these frameworks as being in competition, the panel recognised that they are mutually reinforcing: multilateralism provides the foundation for discussion and consensus building, while minilateralism drives practical outcomes. The added difficulty in this process, noted in the panel discussion, is the reconciliation of domestic responsibility with discussions at the international level. Emerging from the panel discussion was a reflection about the different levers of control and accountability that states have been trying to employ in attempting to enact responsibility amid growing fragmentation. This includes questions of how and when governments employ dual-use surveillance capabilities – such as the Intellexa Alliance capabilities proliferated across the EU – to legitimately address organised crime and other national security threats. An example of good practice, as highlighted by one participant, is the Swiss Act on Private Security Services Provided Abroad, adopted in 2013, which requires that companies intending to provide such services from Switzerland notify the relevant domestic authorities in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the panellists noted, the global cyber diplomatic landscape is marked by both multilateralism and minilateralism, with increasing geopolitical tensions amplifying the relevance of both global and regional frameworks to shaping RCB. The discussion concluded that the key will be in harmonising these frameworks to create a resilient and adaptable global cyber governance architecture, ensuring that wider conversations remain inclusive and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;panel-2-responsible-use-of-cyber-capabilities&quot;&gt;Panel 2: Responsible Use of Cyber Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and use of cyber capabilities have become an integral part of cyber statecraft. Countries have devised specific organisations (cyber forces and cyber commands), sought to pass legislation to enhance the reach of cyber operations, and allocated more government funding to acquiring cyber tools to support a suite of strategic/operational objectives. The second panel of the day therefore brought together a group of researchers and experts to discuss how states have sought to reconcile state responsibility with the development of capabilities for conducting offensive cyber operations, as well as the core elements that should guide states’ use, acquisition and development of such tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;keynote-address-the-dilemmas-of-responsible-cyber-partnerships&quot;&gt;Keynote Address: The Dilemmas of Responsible Cyber Partnerships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This second panel was opened by investigative journalist Kim Zetter, whose keynote focused on the ethical and strategic dilemmas faced by liberal democracies in building and maintaining responsible cyber partnerships. Reflecting on the nearly 15 years since the discovery of the US-Israeli computer worm Stuxnet, Zetter highlighted the essential role of cyber capabilities in national security and foreign policy, while underscoring the lack of transparency involved. This relates to not only how states decide to deploy cyber tools to achieve their own objectives, but also what safeguards are in place to prevent their misuse by partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zetter raised critical questions about the international push for “responsibility” in cyber operations, questioning whose definition of responsibility prevails in a fragmented global landscape. She pointed out that while the US and its allies often condemn as irresponsible acts such as economic espionage, other states – notably China – see no distinction “between espionage for national security purposes and espionage to support the communist party’s socio-economic goals”. This divergence complicates efforts to establish shared norms, because – as Zetter noted – “nations that argue about the need for cyber norms are often reluctant to sign into agreements that would hamper their options for deploying capabilities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another central theme in Zetter’s address was the challenge of shared responsibility when liberal democracies assist partners in developing cyber capabilities. She pointed out that while the US and its allies frequently provide training and resources to other states, they often lack control over how these partners deploy their newfound capabilities. In challenging the audience to consider the ethical implications of providing capabilities to allies who may employ them in ways that diverge from democratic norms, Zetter asked whether “democratic states that design offensive cyber tools – and develop the skills and techniques for using them – have the right to dictate how other nations that they give them to use them”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zetter highlighted how wider national political interests can indirectly lead democracies to endorse surveillance practices that they would deem unacceptable at home. In her view, Israel’s granting of an export licence for the NSO Group’s Pegasus software to the UAE in the 2010s – a transaction that is widely viewed as having contributed to the UAE’s recognition of Israel’s sovereignty in 2020 – is an example of this. Zetter concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, when we talk about what kinds of operations we engage in that go too far, we also have to talk about what concessions we are willing to make that support the cyber operations of other nations. Where do we draw the limits of acceptable cyber behaviour for ourselves, and for those whose activities we enable and therefore tacitly endorse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;panel-discussion-1&quot;&gt;Panel Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel brought together experts to discuss how governments reconcile the use of offensive cyber capabilities with international norms and legal obligations. Central to discussions were the tensions between transparency, oversight and operational security, highlighting the growing complexity of defining “responsibility” in the development and use of cyber capabilities. The following themes were raised by panellists as they reflected upon how to define responsible use of cyber capabilities, and addressed the key elements that should guide states’ development of cyber tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transparency as a Cornerstone of Responsible Cyber Operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panellists agreed that transparency is essential to the responsible use of offensive capabilities. One participant noted how a significant shift has occurred in recent years. The use of such capabilities used often to be veiled in secrecy. The declassification in 2019 of the US cyber operation “Glowing Symphony” against Islamic State was cited as a pivotal moment of change, where a transparency initiative gave the international community a granular, detailed account of a state-conducted cyber operation for the first time. Marking a departure from the hyperbolic discourse surrounding the destructive potential of cyber actions, this type of openness – while challenging, owing to the need for operational security – was viewed by participants as crucial to building international confidence in states’ cyber behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Measuring the Effects of Cyber Operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panellists also addressed the difficulties of measuring the effects of cyber operations, particularly in assessing unintended consequences. The complexity of cyber operations, combined with the often-blurred lines between state and non-state actors, complicates the evaluation of their impact. One panellist emphasised the importance of clearly defining “effects” of cyber actions in both operational and legal contexts to ensure accountability and adherence to international norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Role of International Law and Due Diligence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel acknowledged the importance of international law in governing state behaviour in cyberspace, while also recognising its limitations. There was consensus that while international law provides a foundational framework, its application remains more rhetorical than practical. A critical challenge highlighted was the lack of harmonised principles for accountability and attribution across the international community. The panel called for states to engage in the development of rigorous due diligence, both legally and operationally, to ensure that cyber actions remain within the bounds of international legal standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsibility to Act&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panellists also discussed how government inaction in cyberspace – as distinct from widespread worries relating to government action and offensiveness – can constitute a form of irresponsibility. The most capable states, some panellists argued, have an obligation to take initiative, to be persistently engaged, and to contest malicious cyber activity. By doing so, states help shape the norms and rules that govern cyberspace over time. This approach challenges the traditional defensive postures that many states have adopted, where responsibility is seen as primarily reactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-workshops-a-three-layered-approach-to-unpacking-rcb&quot;&gt;The Workshops: A Three-layered Approach to Unpacking RCB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reflect upon responsibility through different conceptual lenses and contexts, participants in SC2024 were given the opportunity to deep dive into their respective fields of expertise across three separate workshops. These workshops aimed to provide participants with a platform to inform the future GP-RCB international research agenda by engaging with thought leadership, diverse perspectives and cross-sectoral collaboration. Based on the core themes and reflections that the GP-RCB had identified in its first year of unpacking framings of responsibility, the workshops were divided into a three-layered approach to responsibility: the international, domestic and operational levels of governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;track-1-international--the-road-ahead-for-un-cyber-negotiations-post-2025&quot;&gt;Track 1: International – The Road Ahead for UN Cyber Negotiations Post 2025&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the second OEWG mandate concludes in 2025, the future of UN cyber negotiations faces considerable uncertainty. This workshop invited participants to reflect on challenges and opportunities for sustaining international dialogue on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Discussions explored geopolitical divides, proposals for post-2025 frameworks, and the role of multistakeholder collaboration in shaping effective governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OEWG Challenges and Limitations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions began by reflecting on the OEWG’s role as a platform for state dialogue on responsible behaviour in cyberspace. While participants acknowledged its contributions to maintaining discussions, they also identified a heavy focus on procedural aspects, rather than on achieving tangible outcomes. A recurring critique was the insufficient attention given to integrating international humanitarian law into discussions; participants argued that this gap limits the OEWG’s effectiveness in addressing pressing cyber-governance challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposals for Post-2025 Mechanisms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uncertain future after the expiry of the OEWG’s mandate in 2025 prompted discussions on potential solutions to sustain international dialogue. A permanent Programme of Action (PoA) emerged as a prominent proposal, offering the prospect of merging existing parallel mechanisms, such as the OEWG and the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), into a streamlined and cohesive structure. Proponents argued that a PoA could reduce the inefficiencies of recurring negotiations, while fostering institutional stability and continuity in cyber governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Navigating Geopolitical Silos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants emphasised the difficulty of sustaining multilateral negotiations amid the increasing fragmentation of international relations. Geopolitical silos, marked by growing distrust and regional divisions, were seen as significant threats to progress on global cyber norms. Despite these challenges, there was consensus on the necessity of maintaining regular institutional dialogues to preserve minimal levels of trust and prevent the erosion of cooperative frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multistakeholder Approaches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key theme was the importance of broadening participation in cyber negotiations to include non-state actors. The inclusion of private sector representatives, civil society, and technical communities was highlighted as essential to capturing diverse expertise and perspectives. Such multistakeholder engagement was seen as a way to enhance the legitimacy of outcomes while addressing concerns that state-centric processes often overlook operational realities and broader societal impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust Building and Accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confidence-building measures and other approaches to building trust were identified as critical to fostering confidence among states. However, participants noted that the absence of robust verification mechanisms in cyberspace governance undermines the effectiveness of such measures. Breaches of international law were seen as particularly damaging to long-term cooperation. Greater accountability – through clearer enforcement mechanisms and a focus on transparency – was presented as essential for establishing a stable and reliable framework for cyber norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;track-2-domestic--an-incident-responder-perspective-on-rcb&quot;&gt;Track 2: Domestic – An Incident Responder Perspective on RCB&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop shifted the focus from international norms to the critical domestic responsibilities of technical operators such as computer emergency response teams (CERTs) and national cyber security agencies. Participants examined how these responders contribute to whole-of-government efforts to counter irresponsible cyber activities, and reflected on the unique perspectives they bring to defining and implementing responsible behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Evolving Role of Incident Responders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop opened by highlighting how the field of cyber security has grown from addressing isolated vulnerabilities to dealing with challenges of broader societal significance. Participants observed that cyber attacks increasingly impact entire countries, with economic, political and national security implications. This shift underscores the need for incident responders to balance technical expertise with an understanding of larger strategic and legal frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legal Boundaries and Normative Principles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions emphasised the importance of ensuring that incident responders operate within defined legal and normative boundaries. CERTs, in particular, were seen as pivotal to upholding principles such as respect for national sovereignty while mitigating cyber threats. Participants highlighted that deeper training on international legal frameworks could enhance their ability to act responsibly and effectively, especially when managing cross-border incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attribution as a Collaborative Endeavour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attribution was identified as a complex task that requires a blend of technical analysis, intelligence sharing and diplomatic coordination. Participants shared lessons from past cases where attribution errors were corrected through collaboration among CERTs, intelligence agencies and other stakeholders. These examples demonstrated the value of multistakeholder partnerships in ensuring accurate and credible attributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addressing Domestic and Cultural Nuances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop explored how domestic values and circumstances shape approaches to RCB. In developing countries, motivations for adhering to international norms often align with economic development goals and digital transformation. In contrast, more developed nations may prioritise global influence and power dynamics. Participants noted that African countries often feel marginalised in global discussions, calling for greater inclusion and support in public–private partnerships. The need to balance cyber security with privacy rights was also highlighted as a key consideration in diverse domestic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridging Policy and Technical Spaces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants identified the gap between high-level policy discussions and technical operations as a persistent challenge. A recommendation emerged for governments to facilitate regular meetings between senior authorities and technical responders, enabling alignment of cyber security operations with legal frameworks. Such initiatives could foster stronger collaboration, ensuring that policy decisions translate effectively into operational practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diverse Challenges in Operationalising Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion concluded with an acknowledgment of the significant variability in national capacities and resources. While some countries have made progress in fostering collaboration among CERTs, private companies and governmental entities, others struggle to operationalise norms due to economic and infrastructural limitations. This disparity underscores the need for tailored approaches to implementing responsible cyber practices across different domestic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;track-3-operational--designing-principles-for-responsible-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;Track 3: Operational – Designing Principles for Responsible Cyber Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This session explored the guiding principles and doctrines for responsible cyber operations, moving beyond the growing institutional and technological capabilities states have developed for cyber competition. Participants focused on what operational norms and frameworks should inform states’ cyber activities, particularly in sub-threshold strategic contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond Legal Framing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the central tensions identified in the workshop was around the legal framing of responsibility. Participants noted that the conversation on responsibility often veers into overly legalistic discussions, focused primarily on adherence to international laws and norms, rather than on the intentions evident in operational behaviour. While adherence to international law is essential, an operational perspective on responsibility should also address recklessness and irresponsibility in cyber activities. This broader approach, according to its proponents, emphasises strategic oversight and the need to calibrate operations to avoid unintended consequences, tying actions to broader statecraft objectives, rather than to isolated missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proportionality and Necessity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principles of proportionality and necessity were underscored as cornerstones of responsible cyber operations. While these principles are derived from international law, their real-world application remains challenging, especially when operations risk affecting civilian infrastructure or infringing human rights. Participants stressed the need to differentiate between counter-force targeting and counter-value strategies, citing cases such as SolarWinds and NotPetya as examples of disproportionate and poorly calibrated operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transparency, Accountability and Oversight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of transparency and multilayered oversight was a recurring theme. Democratic states such as Canada and India were highlighted as examples of countries working to ensure that cyber operations align with principles of civilian control and oversight. Participants agreed that the key to achieving this balance lies in governments’ ability to manage multiple layers of authorisations for cyber campaigns. In the case of Canada, such a process involves the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Intelligence Commissioner working together to ensure a principled approach to the authorisation and oversight of cyber operations. However, participants noted that existing transparency mechanisms often fall short of addressing the strategic and campaign-level dimensions of cyber operations. Effective frameworks should integrate cyber operations into broader political and strategic contexts, rather than treating them as standalone actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corporate Responsibility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of private companies in cyber operations was another critical discussion point. Technology and telecommunications firms often act as enablers or agents of state-sponsored operations, yet their accountability remains ambiguous. Participants emphasised the need for international principles that define the responsibilities of these actors and establish mechanisms to ensure they do not engage in reckless or irresponsible behaviour under the guise of state contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;responsible-ai-and-cyber-security&quot;&gt;Responsible AI and Cyber Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid expansion of generative AI models has heightened global interest in the disruptive implications of this technology to our societies, particularly regarding responsible and secure use. While AI has become integral to scaling cyber security solutions, discussions about responsible AI and RCB have often been siloed in separate communities. SC2024’s concluding fireside chat bridged this divide, featuring insights from Ollie Whitehouse, Chief Technology Officer at the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, and Ciaran Martin, Professor of Practice in the Management of Public Organisations at the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avoiding Alarmism and Maintaining Perspective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central theme of the discussion was the need for a balanced approach to AI. Martin urged against sensationalist narratives, emphasising that responsible discourse requires avoiding exaggerated fears about AI’s potential for harm. He also highlighted that, unlike other industries, “the cyber security industry, for once – and very counter culturally given its history – has reacted to AI threats relatively calmly”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whitehouse echoed this sentiment, noting that while adversaries are leveraging AI to enhance traditional techniques such as vulnerability scanning and social engineering, these developments do not represent a fundamental shift in cyber threat dynamics. The industry’s challenge lies in monitoring and preparing for the scaling of AI threats without succumbing to hype. As Whitehouse explained, “there is something for us to be mindful about, and something to be prepared for as that scales, but the punchline is: AI for cyber good is the thing that we should fixate on, not AI for doom”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proliferation and Preparing for the Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inevitability of AI’s proliferation was another key focus. Basic AI capabilities are expected to become widely accessible, including to malicious actors. According to Whitehouse, this reality requires the cyber security community to adopt proactive strategies to mitigate risks, while continuing to evolve defences. He noted that governments and private entities must collaborate to develop norms and regulations that promote responsible AI use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside institutional measures, cyber security professionals must adapt to adversaries’ evolving tactics. Both speakers highlighted the importance of fostering a culture of scepticism in relation to AI systems, teaching professionals and the public to critically evaluate AI outputs, rather than placing undue trust in them. In cyber security, this translates to ensuring that critical decisions remain under human oversight. AI can automate tasks and provide insights, but ultimate accountability must lie with humans, especially when national security is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integrating AI into Cyber Security Frameworks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martin emphasised the need to view AI and cyber security as interconnected parts of the same challenge, rather than as separate phenomena. Integrating AI into cyber security frameworks responsibly requires balancing the technology’s potential benefits against ethical considerations and the risks it poses. This approach includes retaining human judgement in decision-making processes, and ensuring that AI systems are tools rather than autonomous agents in critical security contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-future-of-gp-rcb-research&quot;&gt;The Future of GP-RCB Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SC2024 explored RCB in its international, domestic and operational dimensions, identifying key challenges and future directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the international level, discussions highlighted the persistent gap between the development of UN norms and their practical implementation, particularly in resource-constrained nations. Inclusive engagement, capacity building, and equitable partnerships were emphasised as essential for fostering global adherence to responsible principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, the role of technical actors such as CERTs was highlighted as central. Participants emphasised the need for robust legal understanding among responders, and stronger collaboration between policymakers and technical communities. Bridging the gap between policy and technical spaces was seen as critical to operationalising responsibility within national contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operationally, principles such as proportionality, necessity and accountability were identified as essential for responsible cyber operations. Participants called for greater transparency, strategic oversight, and accountability mechanisms, particularly in the involvement of private sector actors in state-directed cyber activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across all tracks, the importance of three major themes emerged: bridging silos between disciplines; addressing the unique challenges of different national contexts; and strengthening collaboration between state and non-state actors. Discussions underscored the need for a holistic, integrated approach to RCB, encompassing legal, technical and operational considerations. The conference reflected a collective recognition that RCB requires a coordinated global effort, underpinned by consistent dialogue, inclusive governance and a strategic approach to tackling the evolving cyber threat landscape. These reflections will inform future research and engagement as part of the GP-RCB and wider research community, highlighting the necessity of a forward-thinking, collaborative framework to navigate the complexities of cyber security in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方質疑黎智英聲稱未聽聞IPAC是說謊 並追問國安法後支持「光時」與否&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MRMoqIg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（7日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第130日審訊，黎智英第38日作供，控方繼續盤問黎，談及黎對國際線的認知。黎早前供稱未聽聞過「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（簡稱 IPAC），惟控方展示訊息紀錄，裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）在2020年5月底告知黎 IPAC 將會成立，又傳送相關新聞稿和網站，並一度問黎能否保留頭版。黎其後傳送時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏的聯絡方法給裴倫德，著對方將照片傳送給陳沛敏。《蘋果》最終在6月5日刊登報導。控方質疑黎聲稱「不在乎」IPAC 的說法。法官李素蘭問，所以黎當時不知道 IPAC 是關於什麼，但是同意刊登它？黎同意。另外，控方反覆追問，黎在《國安法》之後仍然支持「光時」嗎？黎多次表明不會回答。控方最終指出，黎在《國安法》之後支持「光時」。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎供稱未曾聽聞日本線和李字軒&quot;&gt;黎供稱未曾聽聞「日本線」和李字軒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問，圍繞黎與同案被告陳梓華和被指為本案「共謀者」之一的「攬炒巴」劉祖廸之間的關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，在2020年1月11日台北陽明山別墅會議之後，黎曾與陳梓華有對話。黎稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華早前供稱，在會議翌日晚上，他與劉祖廸跟李宇軒進行線上會議，其後將會議內容告知黎。陳告訴黎：「Andy（李宇軒）同劉祖廸都同意喺國際線上面跟隨你嘅行動。」而李宇軒會「打國際線」，黎卻認為李宇軒和劉祖廸都應該要一同「打國際線」。至2020年1月底，陳再次聯絡黎，告知他：「『攬炒』（劉祖廸）唔想打議會線，但係喺國際線上面，就會全力開火。」陳另向黎提及「當時有條日本線，就係李宇軒打嘅」，惟當時很難接觸到「枱底人」，黎則叫陳等人聯絡其私人助手 Mark Simon，以協助美國線。陳引述黎提醒他們：「叫我哋唔好咁心急，因為係一個 long game（持久戰）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指向黎指出上述案情，黎一概否認，指陳梓華編造出來，又重申他從沒聽聞李字軒，直至在庭上才聽到。黎又稱未曾聽聞「日本線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎未有提醒陳梓華對國安法謹慎&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎未有提醒陳梓華對《國安法》謹慎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月21日，黎智英向陳梓華傳送人大公布實施「港版國安法」的報導，並說：「仆街打到嚟喇！」陳回覆黎：「黎前輩：事情至今，已經難以逆轉形勢，我唯一擔心是你與 Martin 及你們家人的自身安全，萬事請以自身安全與事業存續為首要考慮。國安法主要針對境外內勇武人士，港獨份子及煽惑群眾人士。你務必謹慎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後回覆陳：「我們不要擔心個人安危。一旦站出來爭取自由，便要準備作戰至最後一刻，我們雖然未必會勝利，但必須堅持下去。不用擔心。更好的日子即將來臨。」（“Let’s not worry about personal security. Once came out to join the fight for freedom one is prepared to fight to the last. We may not win but must persist. Don’t worry. Better days will come.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，黎否認訊息意思是叫陳「堅持（persist）」，只是說安慰的說話，叫他不要擔心個人安危。惟控方指黎說「必須堅持下去」。黎則稱是泛指所有香港人，「準備作戰至最後一刻，我們雖然未必會勝利，但必須堅持下去。」控方問黎所以他叫陳「準備作戰至最後一刻」？黎同意。控方又問，黎也會「準備作戰至最後一刻」？黎亦同意，不過他否認籲陳繼續作戰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎在早前供稱一直提醒身邊的人謹慎，避免觸犯《國安法》，然而他未有在訊息中提醒陳對《國安法》謹慎。黎則稱當時的討論話題是安慰及鼓勵陳，不容他作出提醒。他同意未有作出提醒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到「作戰」是什麼意思，黎指是「一直進行的那種反抗」。控方問即是「反政府運動」？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華曾傳送攬炒團隊眾籌連結-控方質疑黎聲稱從沒聽聞攬炒團隊說法&quot;&gt;陳梓華曾傳送攬炒團隊眾籌連結 控方質疑黎聲稱從沒聽聞「攬炒團隊」說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月28日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送「連登」討論區連結，題為〈【突發】攬炒過後是晨曦！攬炒團隊《重光香港計劃》眾籌上線！〉。黎則稱未曾按進去連結查看，因為對此不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎早前供稱從沒聽聞「攬炒團隊」，可是從這個訊息表面看來，黎有看過「攬炒團隊」，因此黎的證供是不真實。黎否認不真實，只是當時未留意這是「攬炒團隊」。控方指出，黎其實是知道「攬炒團隊」。黎說：「你可以這樣說，但這不是真實的」，其後表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，眾籌網站提及：「2020年5月，國安法兵臨城下，但我地香港人已經準備好攬炒。天助自助者，琴晚國務卿 Pompeo 亦措辭強硬，直言香港自治已死，全面制裁即將降臨。」黎稱沒有留意到網站是關於推動進一步制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再度展示2020年6月15日《蘋果》的「隔牆有耳」欄目，題為〈中共威脅全球民主自由 攬炒巴加入國際聯軍反抗〉，問黎當時是否知道「攬炒巴」劉祖廸參與國際游說。黎則稱可能只曾「瞥一眼」報導，因版面有太多相片，但強調未有留意標題上的「攬炒巴」。他稱平日也不會閱讀「隔牆有耳」欄目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認籲陳梓華及其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作&quot;&gt;黎否認籲陳梓華及其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及2020年6月16日，黎與陳梓華在壹傳媒大樓見面。陳早前供稱，他在會上說：「我認為應該要褪（讓步）」，黎當時回應《國安法》「雷聲大雨點小」。黎同意說過《國安法》「雷聲大雨點小」，因當時認為中共不會摧毁香港，但他稱沒有聽過陳說要讓步。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，黎稱：「會以身作則，會繼續喺唔同嘅媒體上面呼籲制裁同埋關注。」陳引述黎籲陳「都應該係咁」，又籲他叫其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作。當控方今日覆述陳的證供時，黎表示：「我完全不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指：「再一次，你沒有提醒陳謹慎，是否同意？」黎說：「我沒有提醒他，因為大家都知道《國安法》來臨。」控方問，該次會面之後，黎有否提醒陳？黎則稱：「他是成年人，他知道應該怎樣做，我不是他的父親，你為什麼問這個問題呢？」控方追問，所以黎的答案是沒有？黎同意沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不知對華政策跨國議會聯盟簡稱是ipac&quot;&gt;黎稱不知「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」簡稱是「IPAC」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方談及「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC），並引述陳梓華的證供，在6月16日的會面中，黎問陳為何不加入 IPAC，因黎覺得「IPAC 好重要，一定要有呢啲國際支持，先會有用。」黎否認說過，重申陳編造故事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示訊息，「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）在2020年5月31日說：「Hi, Jimmy. My friend Luke de Pulford would like to be in touch with you regarding a new Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China which he is setting up. I am also involved in it as an advisor. May I give him your number?」黎回覆：「Of course. Thank you.」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 黎智英（左）、羅傑斯 Benedict Rogers（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎的證供是他直至當天從未聽聞 IPAC？黎起初確認他獲告知，但是未有留意，因為他不感興趣；其後在追問下，黎稱他只見到「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」的全名，但是未有把它與其簡稱「IPAC」視為一樣，即使見到全名也未有看重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;裴倫德透過訊息傳送ipac資料給黎-控方質疑黎並非不在乎&quot;&gt;裴倫德透過訊息傳送IPAC資料給黎 控方質疑黎並非「不在乎」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示訊息，裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）於2020年5月31日問黎：「Can you speak now?」，黎回覆：「I call you now.」控方問二人最終有否通話？黎起初稱不記得，但其後稱他承諾過別人的話理應是有通話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月1日，裴倫德向黎傳送文件「IPAC Briefing 31 May」，並說：「There’s more information here www.ipac.global but the site is under construction so please don’t share yet.」、「Will send a press release tomorrow」，黎回覆「Ok. Thanks. Jimmy」。控方指，裴倫德傳送的網站標題為〈IPAC: Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China〉，因此黎是知道「IPAC」等同於「Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China」。黎稱當時沒有留意，又稱不在乎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭質疑，若然黎不在乎的話，為何不向羅傑斯說「不要把我的電話號碼交給裴倫德，我不在乎這個對華政策跨國議會聯盟」？黎則稱：「我不會表現到如此無禮。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎並非「不在乎」，當裴倫德聯絡黎的時候，黎表示「I call you now.」。黎則回應，這是出於禮貌回覆，並一度說「我甚至不認識裴倫德。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭追問：「你會打電話給你不認識的人嗎？」黎則稱，因為羅傑斯給了他的電話號碼給裴倫德，而裴倫德問可否談話，所以他便回覆「現在打給你」，重申只是出於禮貌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;新聞稿顯示ipac為了一致地回應中國崛起&quot;&gt;新聞稿顯示IPAC為了一致地回應中國崛起&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示裴倫德傳來的 IPAC 資料，顯示 IPAC 是由世界各地的議員組成，為了一致地回應由中共統治的中國崛起，對民主國家帶來的挑戰。（“Developing a coherent response to the rise of the People’s Republic of China as led by the Chinese Communist Party is a defining challenge for the world’s democratic states.”）控方問這是否與黎一直以來所提倡的觀點一致？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示 IPAC 共同創辦人名單，當中包括日本眾議員菅野志櫻里（Shiori Yamao）、英國國會議員施志安（Iain Duncan Smith）和時任美國共和黨參議員盧比奧（Marco Rubio）。黎稱從沒聽聞菅野志櫻里，但肯定有聽聞盧比奧，施志安則不記得在哪裡聽聞過，可能是在庭上。黎其後指，從沒想過日本人也有參與，對此感到意外。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示裴倫德與黎談及頭版事宜-黎同意替ipac宣傳&quot;&gt;訊息顯示裴倫德與黎談及頭版事宜 黎同意替IPAC宣傳&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月1日，裴倫德向黎傳送訊息：「Jimmy, we may have to delay launch because of what’s happening in the US. Prob Sunday or Monday.」黎回覆「Ok, thanks. Jimmy」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，裴倫德再傳訊息：「Launch confirmed for Monday 8th 08:00am Hong Kong time. Do you release your front page the previous evening? If not, you could have it for Monday’s paper…」黎回覆：「I don’t know about front page but will try to put it in prominent place if front page is not available. Thanks, Jimmy」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問裴倫德想黎將什麼放在頭版？黎稱不知道，因他讓員工自行決定放什麼在頭版，而他當時只是禮貌回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示訊息，2020年6月3日裴倫德告訴黎，IPAC 將會在星期五（即6月5日）成立，又指「如果他們打算報導包括我，請讓我提供新照片——《蘋果日報》的照片很差。（“If they want to include me in the story please let me give new photos - Apple Daily ones are bad.”）」。黎其後傳送時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏的聯絡方法給裴倫德，著對方將照片傳送給陳沛敏。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指由此可見，黎於2020年6月3日已知道 IPAC 將會正式成立，而黎同意替 IPAC 宣傳，所以他才會傳送陳沛敏的聯絡方式給裴倫德。黎同意。法官李素蘭問，所以黎當時不知道 IPAC 是關於什麼，但是同意刊登它？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認給予編採指示叫陳沛敏報導ipac成立&quot;&gt;黎否認給予編採指示叫陳沛敏報導IPAC成立&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指另一邊廂，黎有傳送訊息給陳沛敏，提醒她直至星期五之前都不要刊登報導。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，有關 IPAC 成立的報導最終有刊出，並展示2020年6月5日的《蘋果》報導〈斥強推港版國安法踐踏人權 9議會結盟強硬抗中共〉。控方指，黎傳送給陳沛敏的訊息，其實是一個編採指示，叫她刊登新聞報導。黎否認，並指他只是轉發手頭上的資訊給陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，裴倫德向黎傳送訊息：「Thanks for all your support Jimmy. Thinking of you daily.」，黎回覆：「Thank you so much! Sorry that we couldn’t make your news our front page because it coincides with June 4th reporting.」，黎又感謝對方的理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎拒答國安法後是否支持光復香港-時代革命&quot;&gt;黎拒答國安法後是否支持「光復香港 時代革命」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指 IPAC 報導被編排在報紙 A12 頁，又提到報紙上方的橫條寫有「惡法臨城」，旁邊含有「光復香港 時代革命」口號照片，問黎是否留意到。黎稱它屬於裝飾，經常出現在版面上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否支持這句口號？黎表示這不是他要思考的問題，過去很多人叫喊這句口號。控方追問，所以黎支持這句口號？黎稱未有想過。法官杜麗冰問：「你是否反對它？」黎稱沒有思考過，但是他不認為他會反對一些放在其報紙上的東西。控方繼續追問黎是否支持「光時」。黎重申沒有思考過，但是如果他的報紙刊登過，他理應是支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後反覆追問，國安法之後，黎仍然支持「光時」嗎？黎多次表明不會回答，因這是假設性的問題，又指庭上展示的報紙是《國安法》之前。控方最終向黎指出，他在《國安法》之後支持「光時」。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎冀國際阻止國安法實施-卻聲稱不知ipac&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎冀國際阻止國安法實施 卻聲稱不知IPAC&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官李運騰提問下，黎承認在2020年6月的時候，他仍然希望香港有國際支持，而報導所指「9議會結盟強硬抗中共」，屬於他希望得到的支持。控方則質疑，黎希望國際支持，但是卻聲稱不留意 IPAC？黎堅稱未有留意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎曾在公開訪談中要求制裁官員，又在2020年5月底計劃赴美國會見彭斯及議員，黎希望國際社會能夠阻止國安法實施，而 IPAC 正正符合黎的想法，也是黎想要的東西，因此黎必然會留意。黎堅稱未有留意到 IPAC，「無論你問我多少次，我的回答也是相同。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，所有羅傑斯和裴倫德傳送給黎的東西，黎都不感興趣？黎指二人傳送東西給他，只是想透過他來刊登在《蘋果》。控方追問，這些訊息是關乎人權，是黎一直以來提倡的東西，不會引起黎的興趣嗎？黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎三度說謊-黎否認並稱知道ipac並非罪行&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎三度說謊 黎否認並稱知道IPAC並非罪行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月13日，裴倫德在訊息中感謝黎轉發 IPAC 的帖文。黎則稱該帖文是其「徒弟」李兆富撰寫，而他可能只曾「瞥一眼」。法官杜麗冰指，黎早前供稱直至在庭上才聽聞 IPAC，然而，「這則有關 IPAC 的帖文擺在你面前，你會否同意你早前告訴法庭的證供是不準確？」黎否認不準確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎向法庭說謊。黎否認。控方續指：「有關 IPAC 的事情，你三度向法庭說謊。」黎再否認，反稱自己沒有理由說謊，又指知道 IPAC 並非罪行，「這不是一件大事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至7月7日，裴倫德向黎傳送 Twitter 帖文的連結，載有英國國會議員施志安的發言影片，談及中國打壓香港及新疆維吾爾族人，提及制裁林鄭及取消官員的外國護照等。黎則稱他未看過影片，堅稱不知道施志安呼籲制裁林鄭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（2月10日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（6日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第129日審訊，黎智英第37日作供，控方繼續盤問黎，談及被指為本案「共謀者」之一的「攬炒巴」劉祖廸。黎供稱最初從新聞得知劉在「連登仔」之中有影響力，是一名精神領袖，惟他不知劉的背景、是否本土派等。控方指，黎供稱在2020年1月在台北陽明山與劉見面，目的是叫劉組成勇武派的領導團隊，然而黎在事後未有跟進相關進度。控方又指，當時黎其實知道「攬炒巴」與勇武派並無關係，反而知悉劉參與國際游說。控方指出，黎在陽明山會議上指示陳梓華和劉祖廸，去請求外國針對中國和香港實施制裁和敵對行動。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎供稱冀劉祖廸運用其影響力-說服勇武派組成領導團隊&quot;&gt;黎供稱冀劉祖廸運用其影響力 說服勇武派組成領導團隊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行提及，黎在主問時供稱，聯絡「攬炒巴」劉祖廸的目的，是叫他善用理大被圍封事件的時機，去成立一個勇武派的領導團隊，以約束勇武派的暴力行動。黎亦供稱上述是2020年1月台北陽明山會議中的主要討論話題，其他話題則不重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今問，會議上有什麼其他話題。黎稱劉祖廸提及「支爆」，而黎亦有當場作出評論，指中國使用大量金錢來管控人民，增加了國家財政開支，但他的記憶已經非常模糊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就著黎要求陳梓華聯絡劉祖廸，控方指黎的說法是想劉成立領導團隊；可是黎在法官杜麗冰的提問下，稱不會期望劉領導勇武派，只是想劉運用其影響力去說服或平息勇武派。控方質疑黎前後說法不一致。黎則否認說法有變，堅稱兩個種說法沒有分別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎的最終說法是什麼。黎稱基於劉有如此的影響力，他應該嘗試說服勇武派去組成領導團隊。他又指，劉不可能返回香港，因此他不可能在不身處香港的情況下，親自組成領導團隊，而劉運用其影響力，是他身處英國時唯一可以做的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰追問，所以黎的意思是，第二種說法才是較為準確？黎起初稱不是較為準確，但是在追問下，黎表示：「OK，OK⋯⋯我們不要花時間在這裡吧。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱得知劉是連登仔-法官李素蘭問及連登是什麼&quot;&gt;黎稱得知劉是「連登仔」 法官李素蘭問及「連登」是什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到從何得知「攬炒巴」劉祖廸這個人，黎稱從新聞得知劉在「連登仔」之中有影響力，在連登討論區中是一名精神領袖。法官李素蘭問及「連登」是什麼，是一個媒體還是一個平台？控方指是一個平台。李素蘭問：「是不是需要加入才能使用？」法官李運騰則補充，按其理解「連登」是一個網上平台，人們可以發表意見。黎同意李官說法，指「連登」是一個社交媒體，好像 Instagram 般。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又問，是否所有「連登仔」都是勇武派？因黎的說法似乎把所有「連登仔」都說成是勇武派。黎認同：「對，所有『連登仔』都是勇武。」李素蘭問：「所以『仔』是勇武？」不過在進一步澄清下，黎更正指年輕的勇武派會使用「連登」來溝通，他們是「連登仔」，但不代表所有「連登」使用者都是勇武派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不知道劉祖廸背景在連登上說了什麼及是否本土派&quot;&gt;黎稱不知道劉祖廸背景、在「連登」上說了什麼及是否本土派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎有否追看「連登」？黎稱沒有，又稱從來都沒有上「連登」。控方問黎從何得知劉祖廸？黎稱從《蘋果》的報導、記者及泛民的口中，因很多人都談論劉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否知道劉的背景？黎稱不知道，只知道他非常有影響力。控方追問黎如何得知劉有影響力？黎指因為陳梓華及很多人均形容劉很有影響力。控方問黎是否知道劉在「連登」上說了什麼、過去做了什麼事情。黎稱不知道，但只知道人們都和應劉的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎僅僅基於「攬炒巴」這個標籤，而認為劉很有影響力。控方又質疑，黎不會有興趣知道劉做過什麼嗎？黎稱不會。控方問黎有否閱讀過他撰寫的文章；黎稱沒有。控方指，黎僅因為劉的大名而覺得他具影響力。黎則重申，因為聽聞很多人說過他有影響力。法官李運騰則指，黎已說過劉很有名，不認為控方需要繼續深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官另外問到，所以黎也不知道劉的政治立場？黎表示不知道劉的政治立場，也不知道他是否本土派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎知道攬炒巴參與國際游說-與勇武派並無關係&quot;&gt;控方：黎知道「攬炒巴」參與國際游說 與勇武派並無關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年6月15日《蘋果》「隔牆有耳」欄目，題為〈中共威脅全球民主自由 攬炒巴加入國際聯軍反抗〉，以及2020年10月24日的《蘋果》報導〈遊行被圍捕險洩身份 攬炒巴死裏逃生 帶署歷警暴 拒保後返英〉。當中提及劉加入「對中政策跨國議會聯盟（IPAC）」、「透過眾籌所得的資金，攬炒團隊在多國報章刊登文宣，向全球揭露港府鎮壓異見者的狀況」、「第一件湧上心頭的就是以保皇黨議員涉違《國際人權法》為由，撰寫信件向外國政府陳情，取消各人的外國公民資格」、「攬炒巴主力國際戰線，低調進行游說，早前更與歐洲議會議員進行溝通及閉門會議。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年10月24日黎的 Twitter 帖文，當中標註「攬炒巴」劉祖廸的帳戶：「I salute to @finnlau_cd. At only 26, he has the wisdom knowing exactly when and what the right role to play. He inspired his peers in his former role, and he’ll do it this time. The outside world support is very important. #StandwithHongKong」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，從上述文章及黎的帖文可見，所有有關劉的內容均是關於國際游說，而不是組成領導團隊。黎則引述報導：「『我要攬炒』，一個自連登討論區冒起、間接影響反送中運動走勢的名字」，指「連登仔」就是勇武派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則指，黎在2019至2020年期間叫陳梓華聯絡「攬炒巴」，然而黎知道「攬炒巴」與勇武派並無關係。黎不同意，反稱：「他與勇武派完全有關」，又指報導已經清楚說了劉「間接影響反送中運動走勢」。控方續指，當黎在2020年1月11日在台北陽明山與劉見面時，黎乃知悉劉參與國際游說。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎曾供稱不知外國議員組團來港觀察區選-控方展示訊息羅傑斯事前告知&quot;&gt;黎曾供稱不知外國議員組團來港觀察區選 控方展示訊息羅傑斯事前告知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在主問時供稱不知道外國議員組團來港觀察區議會選舉。控方遂展示黎與「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）之間的訊息。羅傑斯在2019年11月16日向黎說，外國議員正計劃來港觀察區選﹐包括英國上議院議員奧爾頓勳爵（Lord David Alton），有的議員關注保安問題，問黎有何意見。黎回覆：「這裡沒有保安問題，情況沒有這麼壞，不用擔心！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;羅傑斯又向黎傳送新聞稿，當中提及一群香港義工組織了一個獨立選舉監察小組，成員包括奧爾頓勳爵（Lord David Alton）、立陶宛議員 Mantas Adomėnas 和 加拿大議員 David Kilgour。區選觀察小組由「Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong」和「香港故事」合辦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，由此可見黎獲告知外國議員打算來港觀察區選，並非如黎早前所供稱從不知情。黎起初回應稱，當時回覆羅傑斯的時候，只集中在「奧爾頓勳爵」和「保安問題」上，其後表示不記得觀選團一事。法官杜麗冰追問黎是否同意自己的證供不準確？黎最終同意是不準確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎傳送裴倫德文章予陳梓華並指劉祖廸也應閱讀-惟否認想二人參與國際游說&quot;&gt;黎傳送裴倫德文章予陳梓華並指劉祖廸也應閱讀 惟否認想二人參與國際游說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎智英在2020年1月8日，即在台北陽明山別墅會面之前，向陳梓華傳送一篇裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）刊登於《蘋果日報》網站的文章〈Advice from a friend〉。陳回覆稱他看過文章，認為可以幫助到他說服那些「頑固的領袖」；黎亦指文章值得閱讀，而劉祖廸也應該看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，裴倫德的文章提及國際游說，指「無領袖運動」會使香港人在國際游說的時候衍生代表性的問題。文章另指，暴力抗爭會使外國政客遠離香港人，損害運動得到國際支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎傳送這文章給陳梓華及劉祖廸，是想二人參與國際游說。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑事後黎未有跟進劉祖廸有否組成勇武派領導團隊&quot;&gt;控方質疑事後黎未有跟進劉祖廸有否組成勇武派領導團隊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陽明山別墅會議，黎主問時供稱目的是叫劉祖廸組成勇武派的領導團隊，並稱劉在會上表現似乎願意接受黎的提議。控方今問，黎有在事後跟進相關進度嗎？黎說沒有。控方又問黎有否叫陳梓華和 Mark Simon 去跟進？黎亦稱沒有，因他放手讓劉等人去做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，若果黎沒有跟進的話，怎樣知道劉有否組成領導團隊？黎則稱，他不會做到好像要跟進對方有否按照其提議去做，又指對方是成熟的成年人，不需要去跟進。控方質疑，連一個跟進的訊息也沒有？黎指沒有，因他尊重對方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認曾提議認識枱底人用來做國際游說推動反華政策&quot;&gt;黎否認曾提議認識「枱底人」用來做國際游說、推動反華政策&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及2020年1月5日，即會議之前六日，Mark Simon 在訊息中提到：「好消息是，陳梓華成功使國際登報的群組與朱牧民同步，使華盛頓少一道競爭的聲音（這並非一件易事）。」控方問會上有否討論相關事項？黎稱沒有，陳梓華和其他人也沒有提及。控方問，黎不會有興趣知道當時國際游說的情況嗎？黎則稱不感興趣，又稱不知道那些與朱牧民同步的群組是誰。控方向黎提議，黎沒有在會上詢問，是因為陳梓華已經在2019年12月告訴過他關於訪美的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華早前供稱，他在會上向黎介紹「rip」就是李宇軒，而李曾赴美國會見議員，黎智英其後稱「唔應該係咁」，因為老泛民已經可以介紹到這些議員，「唔需要去嘥呢啲資源，重要嘅係佢哋應該識多啲枱底人，而唔係一直喺度識啲枱面人，例如 Rick Scott、Ted Cruz、Tod Young，呢啲係老泛民本身就已經有 connection。」黎在庭上否認說過上述說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華又指，黎提到要認識一些「枱底人」例如政治顧問或制訂政策的人，因這些關係很有用，可以用來做國際游說，推動反華政策。黎亦否認說過，因「枱底人」並非他會使用的字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎堅稱支爆話題由劉祖廸先提出-控方質疑黎對支爆概念並不陌生&quot;&gt;黎堅稱「支爆」話題由劉祖廸先提出 控方質疑黎對「支爆」概念並不陌生&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華指，「黎智英話長遠嚟講，應該爭取國際認同，然後由佢哋去做 embargo（禁運）、制裁，去向政府施壓，然後我哋要團結唔同嘅板塊，再加埋民間嘅力量，先可以達到『支爆』。」黎在庭上否認說過上述說話，只是泛指一般的施壓。控方問黎是否同意施壓也可以包括實施制裁和禁運？黎同意，但堅稱他沒有提及制裁和禁運。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又稱，「支爆」的話題是劉祖廸首先提出。控方問黎，他對「支爆」的概念其實並不陌生，問他是否同意。黎不同意。控方接著問「中國經濟內爆」的概念呢？黎則同意熟悉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂出示黎於2019年9月30日，刊登於《華爾街日報》的文章〈There’s Hope for Freedom, Even in China〉，當中提到「如果中國經濟內爆（If China’s economy implodes）」字眼。控方又指，黎與以色列前副總理 Natan Sharansky 進行網上對談的時候，曾提及中國政府調配更多資源在監控人民上，會導致中國破產，並會導致中國經濟內爆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ADrz973.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，有沒有可能「支爆」的話題是由黎提出的？黎則堅稱劉先講「支爆」，然後他不知道什麼是「支爆」，經劉解釋後，黎才知道「支爆」是指中國經濟內爆。黎又堅稱不是說中國政府花大量金錢監控人民會導致「支爆」，只是在說假設的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認指示陳梓華和劉祖廸請求外國實施制裁和敵對行動&quot;&gt;黎否認指示陳梓華和劉祖廸請求外國實施制裁和敵對行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎曾向劉提及國際游說的四個步驟，首先令外界知道香港發生什麼事，然後呼籲他們去譴責和關注事件，「香港人先會知道，外國政府冇離棄，同埋冇忽視佢哋，同埋可以保持士氣。」控方又指黎認為需要接觸外國「枱底人」，以影響他們的對華政策。黎則否認說過相關言論，指乃陳梓華編造出來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎指出，至少在會議當日，黎指示陳梓華和劉祖廸，去請求外國針對中國和香港實施制裁和敵對行動。黎表示：「不同意，是他（陳）編造出來。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問黎指示發動一人一信救香港-兩星期後卻指國安法雷聲大雨點小&quot;&gt;官問：黎指示發動「一人一信救香港」 兩星期後卻指國安法「雷聲大雨點小」？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月16日，黎與陳梓華在壹傳媒大樓見面，陳早前供稱黎當時說過《國安法》「雷聲大雨點小」。黎則稱這是他的一廂情願，因當時覺得中國不會摧毀香港。但他否認為了安慰陳而說出這番說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎說會繼續利用《蘋果》作為平台去呼籲制裁？黎則稱：「說出這話是瘋狂的」，因他經常告誡同事、家人和朋友小心行事，「我怎可能呼籲制裁呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到，黎何時開始謹慎？黎稱在6月的時候仍然感到鬆懈，因為他希望《國安法》「雷聲大雨點小」，但是閱讀《國安法》條文之後，便變得「強烈地謹慎（intensively cautious）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，黎在5月底的時候指示發動「一人一信救香港」，為何在大約兩星期之後，卻向陳說《國安法》「雷聲大雨點小」？黎則稱，面對《國安法》不能夠什麼也不做，但是同時間仍然感到樂觀和抱著希望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;初選結束後-黎訊息形容是奇蹟-twitter轉發新聞&quot;&gt;初選結束後 黎訊息形容是「奇蹟」 Twitter轉發新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，昨日控方問及黎是否關注初選，並展示多項訊息，顯示黎在2019年12月至2020年7月之間，持續跟「徙弟」李兆富、李永達、李卓人和陳梓華等人討論初選。控方今指，初選於2020年7月11至12日舉行，7月12日晚上，陳梓華向黎傳送訊息：「感謝你為初選做的所有事。這在香港歷史上非凡。」黎回覆：「這是奇蹟！」控方問黎是否仍然關注初選？黎表示：「你可以這樣說，但是我只是出於禮貌回覆他。」控方另展示黎在7月12至13日發布的三則 Twitter 帖文，顯示黎在初選結束之後，轉發相關新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英被追問下承認關注民主派初選 曾叫李兆富物色電子投票軟件 訊息稱戴耀廷「進程有點慢」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qftuVGG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（5日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第128日審訊，黎智英第36日作供，控方繼續盤問黎，圍繞黎與同案被告陳梓華之間的關係。陳曾供稱黎曾談及初選，惟黎在早前主問時否認曾向陳談及初選，又稱對於初選並不關注。控方則展示訊息紀錄，顯示早於2019年12月，黎叫「徙弟」李兆富替民主派初選尋找合適的電子投票軟件，並叫李永達聯絡李兆富請教安裝及管理電子投票事宜。黎其後向李提議舉辦公開演講或辯論（barnstorming），引起市民對初選的興趣，又稱可以安排《蘋果》直播。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2020年1月的台北陽明山會議，黎否認談及初選及電子投票系統報價，因當時戴耀廷和區諾軒等人接手了籌辦初選的工作，而他們否決了電子投票的主意，黎亦稱不再關注初選。至3月，黎指戴耀廷籌辦初選「進程有點慢」，籲李永達跟進了解。在控方和法官的追問下，黎最終承認對初選感興趣及關注，但堅稱沒有牽涉其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎談及初選-黎否認並稱不關注&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎談及初選 黎否認並稱不關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問黎。同案被告陳梓華（Wayland Chan）曾供稱，他在2019年11月27日第三次與黎見面時，黎稱「會支持本土派，如果啲素人參加初選，先會有認受性。」同年12月31日第四次與黎見面時，陳稱黎說過舉辦初選「可以集中到嗰啲黃絲嘅票源」，亦認為初選能夠吸納到參與過反修例運動的年輕人票源，提高投票率。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/t1eyAX8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 副刑事檢控專員 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;然而黎在主問時供稱，他不認為自己曾向陳談及初選，對於初選並不關注，也不記得疫情之前是否有人開始談論初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息紀錄顯示黎於2019年12月中與李永達談及初選-指李兆富是初選軟件的始作俑者&quot;&gt;訊息紀錄顯示黎於2019年12月中與李永達談及初選 指李兆富是「初選軟件的始作俑者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示2019年12月15日的訊息，顯示黎向李永達說：「達哥，Simon Lee（李兆富）是我多年的舊同事，他是初選軟件的始作俑者。有問題可以直接請他到場示範，教有關人士使用。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「初選軟件的始作俑者」的意思，黎稱李兆富提出網上投票形式的主意，而非由他研發投票軟件。因李兆富聽聞初選，而他對於民主派事務熱心，所以便提議網上投票的方法是最好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱泛民一直關注選舉𠝹票問題-非基於前美領事意見而討論初選&quot;&gt;黎稱泛民一直關注選舉「𠝹票」問題 非基於前美領事意見而討論初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提及昨日證據，2019年11月25日，前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）發送訊息，指區選目標應該是從建制中取得政治力量，又指未來目標應該是立法會選舉和進入特首選舉的程序（CE process）。李官續指，然後三個星期之後，黎與李永達便談論起初選？黎則稱，李永達開始思考初選的以什麼模式進行是最好，所以他才告訴李永達，李兆富可以協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官接著問到，誰是原先提出初選主意的人？黎稱不知道，他相信自己在李永達提及初選的更早之前已聽聞過，「但那次不是認真的討論，只是隨意地提及初選」，因為泛民一直關注選舉「𠝹票」問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，是否因為郭明瀚提及立法會選舉和特首程序，泛民才開始討論初選？黎則稱不是，泛民舉辦初選的主意並不是基於郭明瀚說的任何話，因「𠝹票」問題一直在泛民的腦海中，直至戴耀廷提出初選主意。黎又指，立法會選舉是非常重要，「我們不需要郭明瀚去提醒我們。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎更早之前著李兆富尋找電子投票軟件&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎更早之前著李兆富尋找電子投票軟件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李兆富提出主意之前有否與黎討論？黎稱沒有，直至李兆富提出網上投票的主意之後才知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示更早之前的訊息，2019年12月12日，黎問李兆富：「請回電我，我需要你的幫助去尋找電子投票軟件。」李兆富其後回覆黎。黎說：「我的會議定於明晚的晚飯，希望我能有投票軟件的資料準備好。」李兆富回覆：「我找到數個（軟件）但是還未測試他們。我的準則是：以雲端為基礎，及必定能夠防止一名選民投票多過一次。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息顯示在12月15日之前，黎與李兆富已經有討論過初選。控方質疑黎未有道出真相，直至他向黎展示相關訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FHX0Sva.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎與李兆富討論初選電子投票系統-並替李永達牽線&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎與李兆富討論初選電子投票系統 並替李永達牽線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示訊息，2019年12月13日，李兆富向黎表示，經過測試數個投票系統之後，他選擇Scytl，指它有經驗及在世界各地都有政黨使用它來舉行初選。黎其後問，選民能否使用自己的手機來投票，而不用出示身份證號碼？能否傳送投票平台連結給選民，讓他們自行進入平台投票？黎並提及《蘋果日報》可以傳送投票連結給370萬讀者，亦提議經《明報》和《立場新聞》傳送。黎指若然可以在手機上投票的話，可以每部手機只限投票一次，而不需要提供身份證號碼，冀李兆富考慮其提議。李兆富表示明白，稱沒有打算用身份證號碼，一手機一票已足夠。黎回覆：「Ok. Wonderful. Thanks a lot.」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續展示同日訊息，黎確認在晚上的會議之後，傳送訊息給李兆富：「他們（泛民）覺得它非常有用，你知道每一次投票的價錢是多少嗎？」、「如果泛民使用應用程式上有問題，他們可以直接聯絡你嗎？另外，你可以查一查價錢嗎？」、「李永達會請教你有關使用方法。謝謝。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及晚上的會議有誰人出席。黎稱有何俊仁、李卓人、林卓廷和李永達等。控方問戴耀廷和區諾軒有否出席？黎指沒有。曾審理初選案的法官李運騰此時打斷控方：「周先生，雖然我不會運用我在過去審訊的個人知識，但是區諾軒的會議是在2020年1月。」控方遂沒有繼續提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月17日，黎向李兆富傳送訊息：「李永達有聯絡你嗎？他們可能需要你替他們安裝及管理電子投票程序。」、「任何增加了你工作量的費用，請找我支付。」李兆富則稱李永達尚未聯絡他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到相關「費用」是什麼，黎稱是測試電子投票系統的費用，而非整個初選的經費，「我看不到自己會支付整個初選。」李官問黎會否接受驟眼看他的訊息，會理解他可能支付電子投票系統的安裝及管理費用？黎同意看起來是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意非常留意初選-但堅稱陳梓華提起的時候未有為意&quot;&gt;黎同意非常留意初選 但堅稱陳梓華提起的時候未有為意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎看起來有點熱衷於設立初選的電子投票系統。黎則稱，這是他一貫做法，若果他嘗試幫助他人，他會確保自己能幫上忙；又指因為他承諾過李永達等人協助電子投票，所以他盡力確保其幫忙是有效，否認是「熱衷」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在主問時供稱他未有意識到初選，惟根據上述訊息，黎是非常留意初選。在追問下，黎同意。控方接著指，黎在庭上未有道出真相。黎否認，稱只是不為意陳梓華的說話，反問：「我為什麼要說謊？真相是當陳梓華提起初選的時候，我未有為意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2019年11月底黎專欄提及泛民初選主意&quot;&gt;2019年11月底黎專欄提及泛民初選主意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華另供稱，在2019年11月27日第三次與黎見面時，黎說過應該結合街頭、議會和國際力量，延續反修例運動的熱情，迫使政府回應訴求。控方展示2019年12月22日的專欄文章〈我們堅持下去才有希望〉，當中黎稱：「我們逆權運動仍須繼續」，指區議會大勝可以令年輕人看到街頭以外另一途徑的抗爭力量，又指香港人保護家園的決心獲得了自由世界的支持，美國政府通過《香港人權民主法案》。控方指，由此可見當黎談及「逆權運動」的時候，是在指街頭、立法會議會和國際線，這三條戰線，而這亦是黎在11月27日與陳梓華見面時，告訴陳的東西。黎稱他有可能這樣說過，但是現在已不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另引述文章最後一段：「李永達說，最有效避免滲透者鎅票惡行的方法，是泛民舉行初選，選出參選的候選人。這是個好主意，而且利用手機電子投票軟件投票，可以確保沒有重複投票之慮，方便又準確。」黎確認引用李永達的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎確認2019年12月底仍然有跟進泛民初選的進度&quot;&gt;黎確認2019年12月底仍然有跟進泛民初選的進度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月30日，李永達向黎稱：「我們已找到袁天佑牧師、鍾劍華、區諾軒成立一討論平台，在2或3號開會，然後用一段時間讓素人參加討論」，他希望可以在3月內進行立法會初選第一次試行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上提到，區諾軒曾要求與他見面，之後便到他的辦公室，不久之後區便前往日本升讀博士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎向李永達傳送一則長訊息，當中提議舉辦巡迴演講或辯論（barnstorming），引起市民對初選的興趣，又稱可以安排《蘋果》及其他媒體直播，「這可以成為一連串延續活動，作為逆權運動的一部份。」控方問黎是否把初選視為逆權運動的一部份？黎同意可以如此理解，因立法會的活動可以是運動的一部份。黎並確認，上述訊息顯示他仍然有跟進泛民初選的進度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意知悉2020年初美國政府想知道關於初選的事&quot;&gt;黎同意知悉2020年初美國政府想知道關於初選的事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，2019年12月31日黎與陳梓華在車上會面。陳供稱黎說過年輕人應該集中在選舉上，舉辦初選的好處是「可以集中到嗰啲黃絲嘅票源」，並籲陳將黎的訊息告訴其他人。黎表示不記得有說過這番話，但是似乎合符邏輯。至於11月27日的見面，黎則稱不記得有向陳談及初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示2020年1月5日的訊息，在黎、李柱銘和 Mark Simon 的群組中，Mark Simon 指白宮留意到區選，而時任副總統彭斯認為民主派在區選大勝是一個「很大的訊號」，他們認為值得了解更多民主派初選計劃。控方問黎在當時是否已經知道美國政府想知道關於初選的事？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Simon 同日另一則訊息指，香港民主派初選的主意在華盛頓非常受歡迎，因此可能需要黎或一個資深人物向他們解釋。控方問黎可能是其中一個談論初選的代表？黎同意。控方問黎最終有否在華盛頓談論初選？黎稱不記得自己有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;至2020年1月李兆富仍有向黎交進展-稱系統需應付到國家級駭客&quot;&gt;至2020年1月李兆富仍有向黎交進展 稱系統需應付到「國家級」駭客&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年1月11日的訊息，李兆富向黎表示，與軟件公司來回溝通過，他向對方清楚表明要應付到「國家級」駭客和網絡攻擊，對方則回覆這方面是他們協助客人的首要考慮。李亦表示正在研究如何使人們更難投票多於一次。黎籲李持續與李永達溝通，因他們會對可能發生的意外較謹慎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，李兆富持續向黎交代電子投票系統的最新發展。黎同意，但稱沒有收到相關報價。然而控方指2019年12月30日，李兆富的訊息提及軟件公司報價為大約8萬美元。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 初選案被告 戴耀廷（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認陽明山會議曾討論初選-又稱戴耀廷接手之後便不再涉及籌辦&quot;&gt;黎否認陽明山會議曾討論初選 又稱戴耀廷接手之後便不再涉及籌辦&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華早前供稱，在2020年1月的台北陽明山會議中，黎曾談及初選及電子投票系統報價。黎則否認，因當時戴耀廷和區諾軒等人接手了籌辦初選的工作，而他們否決了電子投票的主意，因此在台北陽明山會議中，相關系統報價不會是話題之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則指，即使會議上有提及報價，但是初選依然是話題之一，並且黎有討論過。黎則稱，「攬炒巴」劉祖廸可能有提過初選，但只是輕輕帶過。黎亦不同意劉是將會參與初選的「素人」，因劉身處英國，而他不會敢回來香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，黎曾告訴陳梓華，會向初選提供經濟資助。黎則否認，因在戴耀廷接手之後，他不再涉及籌辦初選，也沒有人叫他參與。控方問黎有否獲告知初選的籌辦事宜。黎則稱，如果他有聽聞過，那只是與泛民食飯期間，聽到他們隨意地及粗略地談起初選，但不是有意地告訴他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問黎有否協助籌辦初選？黎回答：「完全沒有。」控方追問，那麼黎是否提供了《蘋果》作為平台？黎同意《蘋果》作為平台。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不曾與戴耀廷交談過-曾要求泛民約飯聚跟進初選情況&quot;&gt;黎稱不曾與戴耀廷交談過 曾要求泛民約飯聚跟進初選情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年1月28日的訊息，李永達向黎稱，他與戴耀廷、李卓人、李兆富剛會面討論初選，形容「非常有成果」，並希望在兩星期之內弄清楚所有事情。控方指，李永達持續告訴黎有關初選籌備和討論的最新情況。黎同意。
控方問黎：「你有跟戴耀廷討論過嗎？」黎稱他沒有與戴交談過，但過去曾數次親身見面，例如與李柱銘和朱耀明見面期間碰見戴，強調只是偶然遇見戴，而非有意與他見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年2月3日，黎問李永達：「是否可以找幾位大佬聚一聚，跟進一下初選情況？謝謝。」李回覆：「好。」翌日，李傳送訊息，指李柱銘、何俊仁、李卓人、「高佬」林卓廷、黃浩銘和李永達自己，會在星期六吃午飯。控方問黎，由此可見黎熱衷於知道初選的最新發展？黎同意：「對，我想知道。」被問到飯局上討論了什麼，黎稱只是問他們在做什麼，現在已不記得詳細對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華向黎傳送眾志alliance出選名單-控方稱非突然提及初選&quot;&gt;陳梓華向黎傳送「眾志Alliance」出選名單 控方稱非「突然」提及初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年2月26日，陳梓華向黎傳送「眾志Alliance」的出選名單，新西派出朱凱廸、新東派出何桂藍、九東派出黃之鋒、梁凱晴做「Plan B」、九西派出張崑陽、港島派出羅冠聰、超區則派出岑敖暉。黎當時回覆陳：「我們要著手處理，如果初選有認受性，他們也必須參與。且看看事態發展如何。（“Thanks. We’ve to work on them. But if the primary has legitimacy, they will have to join. Let’s see.”）」陳回覆：「我會盡力處理它。（“I will try my best to work on it.”）」、「至少不會讓他們拖累。（“At least not to let them ruin it.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在主問時聲稱陳「突然（out of the blue）」傳送上述名單給他，但是黎一直都獲告知初選發展，亦熱衷於知道，又指黎一直以來都知道初選的詳情。控方向黎指出，陳並非「突然」傳送上述名單給他。黎則稱，他說「突然」的意思，是因為對於陳獲得有關資訊而感到意外，但他同意初選是他與陳之間其中一個討論話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎在追問下改稱關注初選-但不牽涉其中&quot;&gt;黎在追問下改稱關注初選 但不牽涉其中&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又質疑黎聲稱「不關注初選」的說法，因從早上到現在，庭上展示的訊息均可以見到，黎一直掌握初選的事態發展，又質疑若然黎不關注，為何會相約泛民飯聚以討論初選？法官李運騰亦指，Mark Simon 的訊息指可能需要黎或資深泛民在華盛頓解釋香港初選，問黎怎會不關注初選？黎則回應，當時已有人接手籌辦，而且已開始了籌備初選的過程，所以他不再關注初選。黎稱，如果有人向他問起初選，他便會解釋，但重申當時籌備過程已開展，故他不再關注初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官指：「當我們使用『關注（concerned）』一字的時候，並不是說你是初選組織者。」法官李素蘭接著指，「關注」即代表「你感興趣（you were interested）」。黎遂回答：「對，我是感興趣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎更改證供，並不是道出真相。黎則強調，就他個人而言並非牽涉在初選之中，但是他關注相關議題。（Concerned 在英語可理解為「關注」或「有關」）黎指：「如果你基於一個字來指稱我說謊，那你有自由如此做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭最後指，當黎向陳梓華談及初選的時候，乃有意識地談論。黎同意，不論相關話題是由自己或陳提起，他都會關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，同日黎將陳的「眾志 Alliance」名單轉發給何俊仁、李卓人和李永達。控方問黎，當時是否仍然關注初選？黎回答他感興趣，但是他並不牽涉初選之中。（“I was interested but I was not concerned about it.”）控方追問，《蘋果》給予他們一個平台，「你是否牽涉其中？（Were you concerned about it?）」黎稱：「我沒有牽涉其中，我與它完全無關。（“I was not concerned about it. I have nothing to do with it.”）」控方問黎有否叫《蘋果》促進初選？黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指戴耀廷辦初選進程有點慢-籲李永達跟進了解&quot;&gt;黎指戴耀廷辦初選「進程有點慢」 籲李永達跟進了解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年3月3日，黎向李永達傳送訊息：「達哥，Simon 跟我今天開會令我覺得初選 Benny 那邊進程有點慢，你們是否要跟進了解一下。謝謝。」控方指，直至2020年3月，黎仍然緊貼初選的發展，並非常關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，李兆富當時仍然參與其中？黎則稱，如果李仍然有參與，也很快便不會參與，因戴耀廷不打算使用電子投票。李官問，黎肯定戴在3月時放棄電子投票嗎？黎堅稱：「我肯定戴耀廷改變主意，他不喜歡（電子投票）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fuQJBDw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎在國安法之後仍關注初選&quot;&gt;控方指黎在國安法之後仍關注初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年3月4日的訊息，李永達向黎說：「我們在星期六會與戴耀廷和區諾軒開會，我們會籲他們加快初選計劃。」控方指，李稱會「籲他們加快初選計劃」，是因為黎叫李如此做。黎稱：「好吧，我同意。」控方追問，在3月4日的時候，黎是否仍關注初選？黎稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎知道初選將於2020年7月舉行。黎回應：「我當然關注，因為我們提供了平台給他們。」控方續指，即使在《國安法》實施之後，黎是否仍關注初選的發展？黎則稱：「我認為那時候，我的所有關注都在國安法上。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官李運騰打斷，指本案並非關於初選的審訊，如果控方問及《國安法》實施之後的初選事宜，便衍生一個問題，是否需要向黎給予警告。辯方大律師關文渭指，「初選」本質上並非違法。李官問：「所以你們沒有感到不安？」關文渭則指，理解當黎談及「初選」時，是泛指一般的初選。李官遂說：「那好吧。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年7月1日的訊息，黎向李卓人討論初選的電子投票系統，並問黎在《國安法》生效之後，有否繼續關注初選？黎則稱不只是他自己，其他泛民都很關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as these companies grow more powerful, the systems that are meant to enforce accountability seem ill-equipped to do so. Where Big Tech companies cherry-pick the privileges of state-like power, without submitting to the associated responsibilities, they risk fraying the public’s trust. To preserve and strengthen the post-World War II international order, which is already facing profound challenges, there should be a clear-eyed reckoning with Big Tech’s agency as influential international actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critiques of Big Tech are abundant. Accusations range from anti-competitive practices, neglect of social harms, democratic encroachment, and the warping of humanity itself. And these concerns are not without merit: Unchecked corporate power threatens societal cohesion and traditional governance structures. Yet, relentless condemnation of lawful and highly successful enterprises risks paralysis. When every flaw is fatal, we risk letting perfect become the enemy of good enough. The challenge lies in finding a middle ground—acknowledging Big Tech’s power can be a force for social benefit, while creating sensible mechanisms to ensure their accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of Big Tech reflects a seismic shift in international relations. Power has leaked out of the corridors of government. It’s now exercised in data centers, server rooms, and undersea cables. Recognizing this, the U.K. Secretary of State for Science, Innovation, and Technology argued in November of last year that countries should approach Big Tech with “humility,” and treat them like nation-states. More recently, some of the most exclusive seats at President Donald Trump’s inauguration were taken by powerful Big Tech executives—filling the space typically reserved for elected officials. Their presence and prominence reflects how the international order is changing. It is not only multipolar but multistakeholder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question, then, should not just be whether to accept Big Tech’s influence, but also how to channel it responsibly. We propose three possible pathways. First, grant Big Tech formal membership in international organizations. Second, enhance and expand existing treaties and national legislation with an increased focus on enforcement. Lastly, encourage companies to adopt transparent reporting on their global activities. The solution is uncertain, but a common goal is in reach: make Big Tech accountable for its power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;establishing-and-exerting-influence&quot;&gt;Establishing and Exerting influence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “Big Tech” echoes legacy descriptors like “Big Oil,” “Big Banks,” and “Big Pharma,” highlighting the scale and dominance of multinational corporations that shape influential industries. However, unlike its predecessors, Big Tech wields a unique, quasi-sovereign power over cyberspace—a recognized domain of war and the backbone of our economic and social interactions. Their control extends beyond monopolizing products—it grants them the ability to shape the rules, norms, and processes governing our digital lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big Tech’s quasi-statecraft can be understood through three distinct functions: diplomacy, state-like involvement in armed conflicts and crises, and ownership and operation of domains through which state interactions are mediated (e.g., cyberspace).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take diplomacy: During the first Trump administration, Microsoft led calls for a Digital Geneva Convention to establish international rules protecting civilians from state-led cyber threats. While the initiative stalled amid diplomatic wrangling, it revealed how Big Tech companies were beginning to rethink their role in the world. By 2020, Microsoft went further, establishing a U.N. representation office in New York. Two years later, the United Nations responded in kind by creating the Secretary General’s Envoy on Technology. These moves underscore how Big Tech is embedding itself in international institutions. State actors are taking notice. Denmark was the first country to appoint a dedicated tech ambassador, a trend now mirrored by several states seeking to engage Big Tech on equal footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding armed conflict, Big Tech companies have played a pivotal role in the ongoing war in Ukraine. Starlink has ensured mostly uninterrupted connectivity for Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian government migrated critical data and government services to the cloud to protect against Russian attacks, and private companies have gathered intelligence, hardened targets, and responded to incidents. This level of involvement in the war goes beyond the traditional role of suppliers or contractors. It resembles a form of deputization, whereby private companies are given authority to perform state-like activities under specific circumstances. At most, these activities reflect how companies are seizing an opportunity to elevate their agency and status through unilateral or multilateral actions that materially change conditions in active conflict zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underpinning the functions of diplomacy and state-like involvement in armed conflicts is a third function: ownership and operation of cyberspace and associated capabilities. Cyberspace—the fifth sphere of power projection—is distinct when compared to the other four, which are owned and/or shared by states through treaties and principles of sovereignty. Cyberspace is simultaneously a physical infrastructure as well as an information ecosystem. The two are inextricably linked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the corridors and meeting rooms of the United Nations—where states are the operators—in cyberspace, the private sector owns the pitch, largely sets the rules of the game, and has the best players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Big Tech occupies a privileged position in one of the most consequential arenas: cyberspace. Big Tech’s influence, however, also exposes a fundamental tension. While these companies have become de facto actors in the international system, they are free from many of the accountability systems that constrain state actors. This is not a lawless, zero-sum “Wild West,” however. Big Tech is beholden to shareholder expectations, national regulations, and international standards. Yet these mechanisms, based on a concern for consumers and principals, are no substitute for broader responsibility to citizens and global society. The issue is not necessarily Big Tech’s influence, but the inability of existing international frameworks to adapt to its emergence as a dominant actor in cyberspace and a near-peer in world affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-hate-the-player-change-the-game&quot;&gt;Don’t Hate The Player, Change the Game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adapting to Big Tech’s growing global role is not just about blaming companies for taking initiative. It is also about reforming structures and processes to introduce accountability. To date, similar attempts in multilateral forums to integrate the private sector have had limited success. As the international system reckons with the rise of Big Tech actors, three intuitive pathways appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Big Tech companies could be granted formal membership of key international organizations—recognizing the multistakeholder status quo. This could range from observer status at the United Nations to increased participation rights in specialized governance forums like the International Telecommunications Union. For example, Big Tech companies could get a vote in setting international standards or in selecting leadership, and participate in world radiocommunication conferences. Inclusion would bring companies into existing frameworks, creating opportunities to enforce accountability among peers through existing mechanisms. Doubtlessly controversial, this approach could normalize and better define the remit of their contribution to a rules-based system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, countries and international organizations could enhance international treaties and national legislation to better control private sector influence. Multilateral agreements, akin to those governing arms control or nuclear proliferation—each of which already have some private sector oversight—could set controls on Big Tech’s operations in critical areas such as global digital infrastructure. Simultaneously, national governments can update legislation and regulatory frameworks to close loopholes and bolster enforcement against company excesses. The European Union is broadly taking this approach under the auspices of the Digital Markets Act and the Cyber Resilience Act, though these aims are not always made explicit. Alas, these initiatives have also been criticized as a veiled attempt to pursue industrial policy along geopolitical fault lines and makeup for European regulation stifling the growth of the technology sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, companies can adopt greater corporate transparency. Tech companies could apply standards like environmental, social, and governance statements that are tailored to their international activities. These “international engagement, compliance, and governance” reports would represent a bespoke opportunity for firms to outline their global posture. Such reports could self-assess a company’s activities in the preceding year and narrate their plans—including future strategy, partnerships, and upcoming participation in international processes. These disclosures would produce additional sources of qualitative and quantitative data—similar to governments setting out strategies or policy papers. In turn, this data could empower civil society, companies’ employees and shareholders, as well as governments to hold these companies accountable for their actions on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these proposals will settle the total balance of the accountability deficit, and in all likelihood, the status quo will persist. Even those countries that acknowledge that action should be taken to redress the power and accountability imbalance ultimately have limited bandwidth—amid a “studs up” trade war between the United States and China—to dedicate resources to reconciling corporate accountability. Countries and trading blocs may also use an accountability agenda as cover to promote national or regional interests and champions to undermine those of rival powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, historical precedents—such as efforts to engage Big Tech in the United Nations and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe counter-terrorism forums—suggest that expectations should be managed. International institutions can be notoriously slow to adapt, while Big Tech moves fast—and often breaks things. We hope this reflection offers a starting point to consider accountability for Big Tech’s exercise of international influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On balance, it is neither feasible nor desirable to show Big Tech a “red card.” The transformative impact of technology on power dynamics within international society is undeniable and will only intensify. The challenge lies in ensuring that Big Tech’s immense influence is aligned with the rules of the game. It should be accountable—not just to shareholders or national regulators but to the wider public. Through our ongoing research with King’s College London and the University of Bath, we aim to drive the conversation forward, shedding light on the critical intersections of technology, governance, and statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, dependence on foreign adversaries for uranium poses a significant risk to U.S. nuclear supply chains, impacting both energy and defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uranium is a crucial mineral for energy and national security—it fuels the nuclear energy that underpins today’s economy and is key to propelling future growth to meet the surge in energy demand from artificial intelligence. However, supply chain vulnerabilities and dependencies on foreign adversaries challenge U.S. leadership in the sector and create national and energy security risks. Russia and China are rapidly expanding their offtake of mined uranium from international partners, uranium enrichment capabilities, and nuclear infrastructure. To strengthen uranium and nuclear fuel supply chains, the United States must work with allies, implement conducive trade and tariff policies, and invest in both domestic enrichment capacity and uranium ore production abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uranium is one of the most consequential elements of the modern era. It led to the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the twentieth century and underpins the renaissance of nuclear energy in the twenty-first century. It is the feedstock for nuclear power, which is the largest source of carbon-free energy in the United States, accounting for 19 percent of total U.S. energy production in 2023. The United States currently produces more nuclear energy than any other country and has the most operating nuclear reactors in the world. But the U.S. lead may not be permanent. For several years, U.S. nuclear electricity generation was declining or stagnant as plants retired without a sufficient number of new reactors to replace them. Consequently, China is set to surpass the United States’ nuclear generator capacity by 2030, with 150 new nuclear reactors set to come online between 2020 and 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uranium supply is perhaps the biggest threat to U.S. nuclear leadership—but this wasn’t always the case. From 1953 until the 1980s, the United States was the world’s leading producer of uranium, owing partially to government subsidies. During this period, the United States produced between 20 and 45 million pounds of uranium concentrate annually, even reaching a point where it did not need to import any uranium. In comparison, in 2023, the United States produced roughly 50,000 pounds of uranium domestically and imported upward of 30 million pounds annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZnMlaSC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Sources of Uranium for U.S. Nuclear Power Plants, 1950–2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has deprioritized uranium security over the last seven years. The 2018 United States Geological Survey (USGS) Critical Minerals list, which forms the basis for government incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act, identified uranium as critical. When it released the list in 2018, the USGS noted,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Federal interagency feedback to Interior on the initial draft list highlighted one mineral, uranium, with both fuel and non-fuel uses, and for which Energy Information Administration data indicated high production concentration and significant import reliance . . . uranium, while primarily known as a fuel mineral, also has important non-fuel uses, and otherwise meets the criteria for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, uranium was the only mineral removed from the Biden administration’s 2022 USGS Critical Minerals list on grounds that it was a “fuel mineral.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a clear disconnect in policy efforts to secure front-end fuel cycle capacity—including uranium mining—and efforts directed at nuclear power development. Over the past several years, bipartisan support for nuclear power has been increasing. In 2023, the United States joined 21 countries pledging to triple global nuclear capacity by 2050 at the United Nations Climate Summit in Dubai. Under the White House nuclear deployment roadmap, the United States alone plans to add 200 gigawatts (GW) of domestic nuclear power by 2050. Republican support for boosting nuclear energy is even, on average, much stronger than Democrat support, signaling a more bullish outlook for the industry over the next four years; the Make America Great Again 2024 platform from the Republican National Convention promises that “Republicans will unleash Energy Production from all sources, including nuclear, to immediately slash Inflation and power American homes, cars, and factories with reliable, abundant, and affordable Energy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fundamentally requires creating a resilient, secure, and larger-than-ever uranium supply chain. At present, uranium supply is heavily concentrated in the hands of Russia and China—together, these adversaries hold over 50 percent of the world’s uranium enrichment capacity—creating untenable risks to U.S. energy and national security. Despite this, the United States has not added uranium back to the U.S. Geological Survey’s list of critical minerals, although one of President Trump’s first executive orders on “Unleashing American Energy” called immediately for the secretary of the interior to consider its return. Addressing these risks and building secure uranium supply chains must be on the list of priorities for the incoming administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the contentiousness surrounding uranium is its dual use in weapons and energy. This has generated nearly a century of tension. In 1939, Albert Einstein wrote a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt in which he noted that recent research both led him “to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future,” and that it was also “possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium . . . [that could] . . . lead to the construction of bombs.” He added that “A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the United States holds the second-largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world, following Russia, and is scheduled to spend $756 billion on nuclear weapons modernization programs between fiscal years 2023 and 2032. The United States has been building its nuclear force from land, air, and sea to deter adversaries and assure allies. This key tenet of national security depends on access to fissile uranium materials. At the same time, the United States is engaged in disarmament and arms control agreements and talks with Russia and China, whose nuclear arsenals rival that of the United States. This dichotomy presents a unique set of challenges for policymakers and the uranium industry—how do you expand uranium production, enrichment capacity, and access for the United States and its close allies while adequately containing the industry to avoid the proliferation of nuclear weapons by adversaries?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, to remain ahead of foreign adversaries in nuclear energy production and defense capabilities, the United States must work internally and with allies to develop a secure uranium supply chain that does not depend on imports or infrastructure from adversaries. Given that it is a reliable source of baseload power, nuclear power will be vital for meeting the growing demand for energy that is being driven by artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uranium-supply-chain&quot;&gt;The Uranium Supply Chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uranium-to-nuclear fuel supply chain is lengthy, complex, and riddled with supply chain vulnerabilities each step of the way, from mine to reactor. Uranium is mined primarily in Kazakhstan (43 percent), Canada (15 percent), Namibia (11 percent), Australia (9 percent), Uzbekistan (7 percent), and Russia (5 percent). The United States mined a mere 75 metric tons of uranium in 2022— a negligible amount equivalent to just 0.02 percent of the world’s production. The ore is then milled into triuranium oxide (U3O8), commonly known as yellow cake. Global yellow cake production is similarly dominated by Kazakhstan (39 percent), Canada (20 percent), Namibia (12 percent), Australia (9 percent), Uzbekistan (7 percent), and Russia (5 percent). Yellow cake uranium undergoes the enrichment process to increase the concentration of the uranium-235 isotope (U-235), the only fissile uranium isotope found in nature, from just 0.7 percent of total uranium to upward of 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uranium enrichment process is where foreign adversaries tighten their control on nuclear supply chains. Four companies dominate this stage in the fuel cycle: Russia’s State Nuclear Energy Corporation (Rosatom), the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), Orano in France, and British-German-Dutch consortium Urenco Group. At present, Rosatom holds 38.5 percent of the world’s uranium enrichment capacity, and China’s CNNC holds 24.2 percent. Together, they control 62.7 percent of the world’s commercial uranium enrichment capacity. The United States has only one commercially operating enrichment plant, with limited capacity, which is owned by Urenco. The vast majority of the United States’ uranium must be imported, with nearly 30 percent coming from Russia in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. reliance on Russian uranium can be traced back to the Megatons to Megawatts Program—a government-industry partnership initiated between the United States and Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. For 20 years, the program took bomb-grade uranium from decommissioned Russian nuclear weapons and converted it into low-enriched uranium suitable for U.S. commercial nuclear reactors. At the time, the program successfully enhanced world security by decreasing stockpiles of nuclear weapon materials while generating clean power. Although the program came to an end in 2013, the U.S. nuclear industry still relies on Russia for much of its enriched uranium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters further, the next generation of advanced reactors will require fuel enriched to higher U-235 concentrations (between 5 and 19.5 percent), known as high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). The U.S. Department of Energy projects that more than 50 metric tons of HALEU will be needed per year by the end of the decade for the 20 different U.S. companies currently developing advanced reactors. The United States has yet to reach commercial-level production of HALEU. Russia and China are the only countries confirmed to have the infrastructure to produce HALEU at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-strategic-offtake-of-uranium-from-developing-markets&quot;&gt;China’s Strategic Offtake of Uranium from Developing Markets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is not the only foreign adversary of concern in the uranium supply chain. China is swiftly taking strategic action to secure uranium for its ambitious nuclear agenda. It has made strategic investments in uranium-rich countries around the world to secure feedstock for its domestic nuclear programs—both civil and defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Namibia has the world’s third-largest uranium reserves, with 11 percent of the world’s supply, and is responsible for 12 percent of global yellow cake production. The China National Uranium Corporation (CNUC), China General Nuclear Power Group, and China Africa Development Fund hold significant ownership stakes in all three of Namibia’s operating uranium mines. An additional risk is posed by the government of Iran, which holds a minority stake (15 percent) in the Rössing operation through a 1976 transaction. However, CNUC and the government of Namibia adhere to all international sanctions on Iran. As a result of this China-Namibia partnership in the uranium mining sector, 77 percent of Namibia’s uranium exports goes to China. There is currently no notable U.S. investment in Namibia’s uranium sector, despite the two countries sharing positive economic relations and Namibia being a key beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also engaged in bilateral cooperation with Kazakhstan to extract uranium and produce nuclear fuel. Kazakhstan is the largest uranium producer in the world, accounting for 43 percent of world production. The central Asian country also holds some of the highest value deposits in the world for low-cost extraction. China has been purchasing natural uranium from Kazakhstan since the early 2000s, and it has signed purchase contracts across an array of suppliers. With a longstanding working relationship with Kazatomprom, Kazakhstan’s national nuclear company, China offtakes nearly 30 percent of Kazakhstan’s uranium exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China is making strategic investments in nations that have yet to develop their significant uranium resources. For example, Brazil holds 5 percent of the world’s uranium reserves yet produces only a negligible amount of uranium. Nuclear Industries of Brazil is eager for industry collaborators, calling for bids from foreign partners interested in uranium exploration in the country. China answered the call. In November 2024, China Nonferrous Trade (CNT) purchased Brazil’s largest uranium mine for just $340 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-comparison-of-uranium-policies-under-trump-and-biden&quot;&gt;A Comparison of Uranium Policies Under Trump and Biden&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuclear energy industry largely enjoyed support from both the Trump and Biden administrations as an imperative for energy security. During his first administration, President Trump signed two bills to facilitate building and receiving permits for advanced nuclear reactors, increased funding for the industry in annual budgets, and established the U.S. Nuclear Fuel Working Group. President Biden also passed funding for nuclear projects in both the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The two administrations, however, targeted different ends of the nuclear supply chain: The Trump administration was generally more focused on the upstream mining of uranium, while the Biden administration focused more resources on the front and back ends of the nuclear fuel and reactor industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under President Trump’s first administration, he set up the Nuclear Fuel Working Group to address the “significant challenges in producing uranium domestically” as “an issue of national security.” As a result of the group’s findings, President Trump requested $1.5 billion from Congress in his 2021 budget request to revitalize the uranium industry and create a national uranium stockpile, saying that propping up U.S. uranium production in the face of cheaper imports was a matter of vital energy security. The $1.5 billion would have provided significant subsidization to domestic upstream uranium mining companies. The move was not without opposition; critics argued that the measure was a thinly veiled government bailout of the uranium industry, consisting of primarily just two companies and their investors. The budget request was ultimately interrupted just weeks later by the Covid-19 crisis and Trump’s unsuccessful bid for reelection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden addressed the nuclear energy industry within both the IIJA and the IRA. However, uranium is not classified as a USGS critical mineral, meaning it will not qualify for the suite of IRA incentives aimed at the critical mineral industry. Rather, the nuclear industry was addressed in separate provisions in the IRA and IIJA. Together, these provisions mobilized billions of dollars in funding through the Department of Energy (DOE) for the development of domestic HALEU for advanced nuclear reactors, nuclear technology demonstrations, loan guarantees for large projects, and tax credits to reduce the costs of technology commercialization. Notably, the IRA and IIJA focused on the downstream nuclear sector rather than upstream uranium mining. While lithium, nickel, and cobalt mining projects are eligible for some incentives under the IRA and IIJA, no incentives currently exist for raw uranium production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Biden also signed into law the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act in July 2024. The bipartisan bill aims to promote a domestic nuclear energy renaissance by streamlining and reducing costs for licensing and permitting for reactors as well as expanding opportunities for foreign direct investment. The bill focuses entirely on the downstream nuclear energy industry and does not address uranium supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only in its final months did the Biden administration turn its attention to uranium supply chain concerns. In August 2024, the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act went into effect, banning the import of enriched uranium from Russia. The bill is complemented by $2.7 billion in appropriated funds for domestic uranium enrichment, as directed by the Nuclear Fuel Security Act. The DOE is directed to expand the American Assured Fuel Supply Program to ensure the availability of uranium, including HALEU, from domestic sources and allies. It is so far unclear how the DOE plans on achieving the program objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States will need to figure out its strategy for securing enriched uranium quickly to meet its supply needs. Global demand for enriched uranium is expected to rise 28 percent as new reactors come online, and the United States could need an estimated 2000 metric tons of HALEU by 2035—an industry that currently does not exist at commercial scale outside of Russia. The United States is the world’s largest importer of enriched uranium. While nearly 70 percent of its imports come from European countries (France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), the remaining 30 percent currently comes from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-the-return-of-the-trump-administration-mean-for-the-nuclear-and-uranium-industries&quot;&gt;What Does the Return of the Trump Administration Mean for the Nuclear and Uranium Industries?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Trump returns to the oval office, the landscape of mining and minerals policy is vastly different than four years ago during his first term. Critical mineral security is at the forefront of geopolitical policy concerns. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated just how vulnerable to disruption supply chains are, and policymakers on both sides of the aisle have sworn to remove all reliance on foreign adversaries from these supply chains, both upstream and downstream. At the same time, tensions with both China and Russia are at all-time highs since the Cold War. The political environment is ripe to address the uranium supply chain with policy actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump will need large quantities of uranium to feed his nuclear energy and defense agendas. Reducing electricity costs is a key priority for Trump, who has made promises to slash energy costs in half within 18 months of taking office. With an all-of-the-above energy strategy, Trump stated on day one that he will “approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refineries, new power plants, new reactors.” Reliable supplies of uranium will be necessary to support these new reactors coming online. Additionally, Trump’s nuclear weapons policy, if anything like his first term, is likely to favor building nuclear capabilities for deterrence over arms reduction efforts and diplomatic agreements with foreign adversaries. Greater quantities of highly enriched uranium will be required for a buildup of nuclear weapons stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The domestic uranium mining industry will likely find more support under the Trump administration, and projects may encounter fewer permitting delays and hurdles. Uranium mines in Arizona and Utah have sat dormant for years due to fierce criticism from native tribes and environmentalists. Following the requests of native tribes, President Biden designated a million acres of land in Arizona a national monument, permanently banning mining from the uranium-rich region. President Trump has historically downsized national monuments, and may reverse some, or all, of President Biden’s designation in Arizona as well as open the region back up to mining projects. Additionally, Trump may reintroduce his uranium subsidies from 2019 with the goal of building a domestic uranium industry that can feed strategic stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Trump administration may deprioritize government support for, and perhaps even defund, the DOE’s Loan Program Office (LPO), which has been vital for financing downstream nuclear industry, particularly for large, expensive nuclear reactor projects. The LPO has served as a lifeline for large nuclear power expansions such as Georgia Power’s Plant Vogtle. Vogtle is now the nation’s largest energy generation site of any kind in the United States, and the first nuclear reactor built in the United States in 35 years. The project was made possible by $12 billion in loan guarantees from the LPO. Still, the project faced major obstacles that resulted in seven years of delays and $17 billion in cost overruns. Consequently, this means higher energy costs for Georgia Power customers. Trump has been highly critical of both the Vogtle project and the LPO. Yet, defunding the LPO would mean that large nuclear projects like Vogtle’s would have substantially less access to large loan guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations-for-the-incoming-administration-and-congress&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations for the Incoming Administration and Congress&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-accelerate-and-expand-incentives-for-domestic-uranium-enrichment-capabilities-including-for-haleu&quot;&gt;1. Accelerate and expand incentives for domestic uranium enrichment capabilities, including for HALEU.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. nuclear energy and defense industries will need large quantities of enriched uranium, including HALEU, which the U.S. currently does not produce at commercial scale. Over the past four years, the United States has incentivized investments in critical mineral processing and refining for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies with IRA tax credits. However, since uranium is no longer a USGS critical mineral, it has been excluded from these incentives. Despite enriched uranium’s importance to the next generation of nuclear reactors as well as to nuclear weapons, and despite Russia’s dominance in production, the United States has not taken decisive action to incentivize domestic industry. The DOE’s HALEU program funded under the IRA has so far proved inadequate in stimulating new domestic enrichment capacity. The next administration can incentivize domestic uranium enrichment by making such facilities eligible for the same 45X and 48C production and investment tax credits that currently benefit critical mineral projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-foster-conducive-tariff-policies-with-uranium-producing-allies&quot;&gt;2. Foster conducive tariff policies with uranium-producing allies.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tariffs are a bedrock of President Trump’s economic diplomacy tool kit. At a time when China and Russia already account for 62.6 percent of the world’s enrichment capacity, it is particularly important to foster collaborative policies with uranium-rich allies. Not only is Canada the second-largest producer and exporter of uranium in the world, behind only Kazakhstan, it is the single largest supplier of uranium to the United States, providing about 25 percent of its domestic consumption. Canada does not enrich its own uranium, but it provides critical feedstock for the United States as it builds its own enrichment capabilities. President Trump’s announcement that he would impose a 25 percent tariff on all Canadian imports will have significant consequences for the United States’ uranium supply. The imposition of tariffs on this uranium and/or the volatile tariff policies more generally have the potential to displace Canadian uranium exports to other countries, exacerbating an existing uranium shortage in the United States. Rather than imposing the proposed tariffs, the United States should enact a preferential supplier trade regime in the nuclear sector with key allies. Preferential trade status for nuclear suppliers in countries like Australia, Canada, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom can strengthen uranium security through trade, rather than weaken supply chains with tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-enhance-partnerships-with-key-allies-canada-and-australia-through-a-joint-uranium-supply-chain-partnership-initiative&quot;&gt;3. Enhance partnerships with key allies Canada and Australia through a Joint Uranium Supply Chain Partnership Initiative.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. domestic uranium mining will not be enough—the United States sits on a mere 1 percent of the world’s known uranium resources. Canada and Australia are two of the United States’ closest allies, from both economic and defense standpoints, with significant uranium reserves and production capacity. The next administration should deepen cooperation among these allies to advance the development of uranium supply chains for both civilian and defense purposes. A precedent of trade and defense agreements and partnerships already exists among these three nations; take, for example, the Canada-Australia Partnership on Emerging Missile Defence Research, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue linking the United States and Australia, and the AUKUS agreement linking the United States and Canada. A multilateral joint partnership for uranium production and nuclear capabilities between these three governments and their private industry counterparts holds the potential to strengthen uranium supply chains for allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-secure-mineral-offtake-from-uranium-rich-countries-currently-dominated-by-china&quot;&gt;4. Secure mineral offtake from uranium-rich countries currently dominated by China.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the United States must secure mineral offtake from uranium-rich countries by encouraging investments in developing nations with shared interests—a strategy that China has artfully deployed for decades by integrating minerals security into its foreign policy. Namibia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan have significant uranium reserves and significant potential to supply the United States with uranium feedstock for nuclear fuel. The United States can no longer allow China to be the only power fostering bilateral cooperation and stakeholder relations targeting the mining industries of developing nations. Namibia has a long-standing friendly relationship with the United States based on shared democratic principles and trade relations through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The United States is Brazil’s second-largest trading partner and has invested more foreign direct investment (FDI) dollars than any other country. Moreover, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) set up its first office in Latin America in Brazil and is providing financing for projects related to other commodities, including nickel and rare earths. Finally, the United States was the first country to recognize Kazakhstan’s independence, and the two nations routinely cooperate on nonproliferation issues as a cornerstone of their relationship. There is great opportunity for deepening bilateral partnerships in the uranium industry, and the next administration should prioritize fostering industry partnerships, encouraging U.S. investment in exploration abroad, and opening more avenues for engagement between the administration and the governments of these uranium-rich nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎怎樣知道陳是前線示威者的領袖之一？黎則稱，如果陳不是領袖的話，李不會介紹陳給他；加上陳當時處理登報計劃的過渡性貸款，又承諾會還款，如果陳不是領袖的話，他不可能做到這些事情。控方質疑，這可能是黎的假設。黎稱基於上述，當時很自然地把陳理解為領袖之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著問黎，為何認為一個像陳梓華般保守、和平的人，能夠平息到示威中的暴力？黎回應，如果陳是一個保守、和平的人，背後理應有原因和本錢去做保守的人，因此認為他有能力去平息暴力。控方指這是黎的假設。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問，根據黎的說法，前線示威者分為兩個群組，分別為和平示威者和暴力示威者，問黎認為其中一個群組的人可以怎樣說服另一群組的人？黎回應，不是所有前線的人都是暴力，只是部分人使用暴力。
控方追問，為什麼黎認為和平的人能夠說服勇武的人？黎僅稱：「我們要嘗試所有辦法」，因暴力事件會破壞當時的運動。控方質疑，如果勇武的人反過來說服到和平的人使用暴力呢？黎則重申，和平的人有其理由選擇和平。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎為何認為陳梓華有能力說服其他人？黎僅指：「不論他是否有能力也好，這不會阻止到我去嘗試。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎認為勇武派需有領袖而非各自即興行動&quot;&gt;黎認為勇武派需有領袖而非各自即興行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年11月12日的訊息，黎向陳梓華說：「看到那個男子被淋油及點火，令我感到害怕（dreaded）。年輕及勇武派是時候應該有人領導，你有時間明日或之後日子會面及討論嗎？」翌日，陳梓華出席黎住宅的飯局，出席者還有何俊仁、李永達和林卓廷。這是黎與陳第二次親身見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎供稱，他當時認為勇武派之間需要有領袖，以約束他們的行動，而不是每個人都各自作出即興行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月25日，前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）向群組發送訊息，該群組成員包括黎、李柱銘和 Mark Simon。郭明瀚稱，如果區選被視為繼續示威暴力的認證的話，他恐怕會造成重大的策略性錯誤，目標應該是從建制中奪取政治力量，又指未來目標應該是立法會選舉。黎同日回覆，指沒有人將區選民主派大勝視為授權暴力，他們視為可以緩和街頭運動的暴力，因現在有兩條途徑去反抗政府，黎認為下一步應該是建立領袖群組，以指揮未來運動方向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方黎向陳梓華及泛民傳送香港人權與民主法案消息-因他們進行游說工作&quot;&gt;控方：黎向陳梓華及泛民傳送《香港人權與民主法案》消息 因他們進行游說工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月15日，黎向陳梓華傳送一張香港民主委員會的Twitter截圖，並指時任共和黨參議員盧比奧（Marco Rubio）將《香港人權與民主法案》放上參議院審議，最早可以在當日或下周投票表決，「很難不通過，很棒的消息。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上稱，除了陳梓華之外，他有將相同訊息傳送給其他民主派，因認為他們會有興趣知道。控方則指，黎認為陳會感興趣，是因為陳會進行游說工作。黎否認，堅稱純綷向朋友提供資訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則反駁指，李卓人的確有做游說工作，並提及早前證供顯示，2019年4月2日李卓人傳送訊息，提及泛民訪美目的是要求美國修訂法律，以懲罰損害一國兩制、推動《逃犯條例》修訂的香港官員。黎僅回應李卓人多數到歐洲國家游說；又指在他傳送訊息的泛民朋友之中，只有李卓人涉游說，其他人如何俊仁、林卓廷、李永達等，均沒有做游說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎提議，黎獲告知李卓人將會在10月到訪美國，目的是要提倡懲罰中國官員，而黎對此知情。黎則稱記不起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上就黎是否知悉香港民主委員會而爭持，黎稱不知道「HKDC」是香港民主委員會。法官李素蘭質疑，黎早前供稱他訪美時知道朱牧民創辦香港民主委員會，現在卻稱不知道該組織？黎則反駁，他當時只是說朱創辦一個支持香港反修訂運動的組織。控方問黎當時有否詢問詳情，黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎有機會遇見勇武派卻未叫他們平息暴力-黎不能好像傳教士般&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎有機會遇見勇武派卻未叫他們平息暴力 黎：不能好像傳教士般&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，早前證供指黎與陳梓華於2019年11月27日，在停泊在金鐘的私家車上見面。黎早前亦供稱，他與陳梓華溝通的內容一直以來都是叫陳平息暴力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過控方向黎展示其專欄文章〈這是良知之戰〉，其中提到：「有一次我與十多個勇武派年輕人談話，其中有三位二十歲出頭的年輕人私下說，會不惜犧牲生命保護香港。我問他們年紀輕輕為甚麼有這種想法。他們都說，因為愛香港。我當時聽了哽咽，答不上話來，是否發生不重要，殉道精神已在。」控方問黎見到「勇武派年輕人」時，有否叫他們平息暴力？黎則稱當時他們來到蘋果大樓，只是與他們短暫地對話。控方追問，因此黎的答案是沒有？黎承認沒有，因不知道他們是勇武派之中較激進的一方，還是較保守的一方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎的文章指他們說「會不惜犧牲生命保護香港」，惟黎卻未有勸告他們不要那麼激進？黎說沒有，又指示威者在前線面對警察的時候，所有事情都有可能發生。控方質疑，黎當時有機會遇見勇武派，但是卻未有叫他們平息暴力。黎重申不知道他們是較激進還是較保守，又稱不能好像傳教士般向他們說教。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，黎作為《蘋果日報》的東主，當有一些人到訪辦公大樓，他不會詢問這些人是誰、是否前線、是否在做訪問嗎？黎則稱當時只見了他們很短時間，因此沒有如此詢問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著指，至少《蘋果日報》有勇武派的聯絡方法，既然如此，為何黎不聯絡他們並勸說他們？黎則稱，他不會向記者拿取別人的聯絡方法，這不是他的習慣，因此他沒有如此做。黎重申，他乃經陳梓華勸說勇武派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎透過文章來美化殉道精神鼓吹攬炒概念&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎透過文章來美化「殉道精神」、鼓吹「攬炒」概念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述文章：「黑夜靜寂無人，全副武裝警察排列嚴陣以待，在尋找敵人。未有催淚彈、胡椒噴霧、布袋子彈發射，未有警棍狂揮掠影硝煙四起之前，已等得不耐煩。馬路對面行人路，孤身一人站着的白衫青年問：『阿Sir，係咪跌咗良心？』，即使是兩手空空孤身一人的青年，也不能錯過『敵人』的出現。不由分說一群警察衝過去，為了發洩個痛快，幾個警察把青年推倒壓在地下，打到頭破血流。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎承認不清楚上述事件日子、為何警察排列嚴陣以待及白衫青年的姓氏等，只是從新聞中得知事件。控方質疑黎編造故事，黎否認。控方又指，黎其實支持暴力。黎亦否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎透過文章來美化「殉道精神」。黎否認，指殉道是當對方損害自己的時候犧牲自己。控方則稱，目的是為了損害對方，這是「攬炒」的概念。黎稱這不是殉道，殉道的概念是為了真理不惜犧牲自己。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後指出，黎透過文章鼓吹暴力、引起市民對政府的憎恨、激使他人不守法。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎提議陳梓華與羅傑斯見面-控方質疑與游說制裁有關&quot;&gt;黎提議陳梓華與羅傑斯見面 控方質疑與游說制裁有關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年12月20日的訊息，陳梓華向黎表示他身處倫敦，雖然只逗留一日半，但是希望盡量善用在當地的時間，問黎有什麼人可以介紹他見面。黎其後推薦陳可以見「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）和奧爾頓勳爵（Lord David Alton）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎提議陳梓華與羅傑斯及奧爾頓勳爵見面，並非為了平息示威者暴力，是不是？黎不滿道：「為何所有事情都要與平息暴力有關？」、「難道我叫他去廁所也是關於平息暴力？」此時法官杜麗冰打斷黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著問黎，為何引薦陳與羅傑斯見面？黎僅指，因為陳梓華要求他幫助，陳問他有什麼人可以會見，所以便施以援手，正如他經常向陳尋求協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎引薦陳會見羅傑斯，是想他游說外國制裁。黎反指：「這是你的說法」，又批評周天行：「你真不受拘束！你毫無羞恥和公正之心！（You are so free! You are so free of shame and integrity!）」法官杜麗冰再度打斷，並厲聲說：「黎先生，黎先生，黎先生，你能否好心地約束自己，不要作出陳述，只回答問題呢？」杜官表示，她不容許證人在她的法庭上批評控方，黎在證人台上只需要回答問題，不應作出陳述。法官李運騰向黎解釋，控方並不是「把說話塞進你的口中」，只是向黎指出控方的案情，這是他們的責任，黎只需回答同意或不同意，並籲黎控制情緒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方羅傑斯提倡馬格尼茨基制裁-黎稱不知情&quot;&gt;控方：羅傑斯提倡馬格尼茨基制裁 黎稱不知情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎當時知道羅傑斯正在提倡馬格尼茨基法案（Magnitsky Act）。黎否認，反稱對此不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂向黎展示羅傑斯的兩篇文章。第一篇為2019年11月14日發布的〈Now Is the Time for the U.S. to Stand With Hong Kong〉，作者是羅傑斯和「香港監察」總監 Johnny Patterson。內容提及示威者沒有獲得自己政府的幫助，他們正在聚焦《香港人權與民主法案》，它可以透過馬格尼茨基制裁，確保侵犯人權的人士承受相關後果，並向中國發出清晰信息，不能既侵害香港自治和自由，同時又獲取利益。（The protestors have no help from their own government, and so are looking to the world to assist. They focus on the Human Rights and Democracy Act because it contains powerful provisions which would strengthen their hand. It guarantees that pro-democracy protestors who are arrested do not find their applications for visas blocked after a political trial; it ensures that the violators of human rights bear the consequences of their actions through the application of Magnitsky sanctions; and it sends a clear signal to China that it cannot erode the city’s autonomy and freedoms while reaping the benefits, by strengthening State Department scrutiny of Hong Kong’s freedoms.）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，羅傑斯實際上有提倡馬格尼茨基法案，而且把上述文章傳送給黎，因此黎對此知情。黎則稱他收到訊息後，沒有按進去相關連結，並沒有閱讀文章。他又稱很少閱讀羅傑斯傳送給他的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示另一篇文章為2019年11月15日發布的〈“It’s the people of Hong Kong who are leading the struggle, but they deserve our support”〉，首段提到羅傑斯正在與國會協商及呼籲實施針對中國的馬格尼茨基法案。（Benedict Rogers, a British human rights activist, is continuing his work in the UK, liaising with Parliament and calling for the enactment of Magnitsky law against China.）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎則稱，當時不知道羅傑斯提倡馬格尼茨基法案，直至後來或者在法庭上才知道。控方問黎當時對羅傑斯有什麼認知？黎稱知道羅傑斯是支持香港，曾為香港絕食抗議，又為香港示威和撰寫文章。被問到支持香港什麼，黎稱羅傑斯支持香港、要求英國政府支持示威者的運動，但不知道他推動馬格尼茨基法案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官問及黎為何形容羅傑斯為熱誠的香港自由鬥士和支持者&quot;&gt;法官問及黎為何形容羅傑斯為「熱誠的香港自由鬥士和支持者」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問黎，為何向陳介紹羅傑斯的時候，會形容他為「熱誠的香港自由鬥士和支持者（fervent HK freedom fighter and supporter）」，黎想向陳知道什麼？杜官又問，若然黎只想陳梓華平息示威暴力，為何會向陳形容羅傑斯為「熱誠的香港自由鬥士和支持者」？黎表示只是介紹羅傑斯，認為陳可能對羅傑斯感興趣。杜官問黎是否認為，除了平息暴力之外，陳另外也涉足國際游說？黎否認，強調純綷向陳介紹羅傑斯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問，黎在訊息中提到「雖然他（羅傑斯）獲得充滿可疑的 Irene 支持」，是什麼意思。黎指 Irene 是一名女士，有人曾告訴他 Irene 的背後動機可疑，而她可能向羅傑斯提供金錢。李素蘭追問，那為什麼黎還會將羅傑斯介紹給陳梓華。黎則稱為了公道起見，有需要向陳交代 Irene 的事，雖然羅傑斯獲可疑的人捐款，但是他相信羅傑斯是正直。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭又指，黎剛才指羅傑斯在英國絕食抗議，問黎：「這怎樣幫助到香港？」黎回答，絕食是為了引起英國當地人關注香港狀況。杜麗冰追問，羅傑斯想英國當地人做什麼？黎則稱不知道，叫法官去問羅傑斯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，控方指黎希望陳同時能見到奧爾頓勳爵，並指他正在爭取英國向香港人批出BNO護照，即是替香港游說。黎則稱爭取BNO護照並非屬於「替香港游說」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意mark-simon作為中間人與陳梓華溝通&quot;&gt;黎同意Mark Simon作為「中間人」與陳梓華溝通&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月30日，陳梓華向黎傳送訊息，表示已回港，形容英國之行「有成果（fruitful）」，因曾與羅傑斯見面。翌日，陳告訴黎：「那個嘉賓樂意會見你。（The guest is happy to meet you.）你在台北什麼時候可以？他直至2020年1月8日都可以。」控方指，不爭議訊息中的「嘉賓」是「攬炒巴」劉祖廸，黎當時正在計劃赴台灣與劉見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年12月30日，Mark Simon 向黎傳送訊息，指陳梓華已與「攬炒」溝通，他在2至8號期間可以從倫敦前往台北，問黎可以在哪個日子在台灣與他見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，Mark Simon 與陳梓華溝通，並且作為黎與陳之間的「中間人」。黎同意，惟不同意 Mark Simon 是就劉祖廸的事情溝通。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎自稱是運動的領袖之一-因經營報紙及發表意見&quot;&gt;黎自稱是「運動的領袖之一」 因經營報紙及發表意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年1月5日，Mark Simon 向群組傳送訊息，提及白宮留意到香港2019年11月的區議會選舉，時任副總統彭斯認為是一個「很大的訊號」，他們認為值得了解更多關於民主派初選，因很多人認為有當選的政治人物能在華盛頓代表香港行動是很重要，同一時間需要聆聽資深民主派（Senior figures）或意見領袖（Opinion leaders）對於大局的看法和想美國做什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎會否視自己為「資深民主派」？黎同意，指自己年紀上是。控方接著問黎會否視自己為「意見領袖」？黎則不認為自己是「意見領袖」，但指自己是「運動的領袖之一」。杜麗冰問及，那麼其他的領袖是誰？黎則舉例指李柱銘、何俊仁、李永達和李卓人。黎其後補充，他之所以成為運動的「領袖」，是因為他經營一份報紙，以及會發表意見；但他稱自己不是運動的組織者之一，也從未出席會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon向黎匯報陳梓華成功使國際登報群組與朱牧民一致-惟黎否認知悉其參與國際游說&quot;&gt;Mark Simon向黎匯報陳梓華成功使國際登報群組與朱牧民一致 惟黎否認知悉其參與國際游說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，Mark Simon 在訊息中提到：「好消息是，陳梓華成功使國際登報的群組與朱牧民變得一致，使華盛頓少一道競爭的聲音，這並非一件易事。」控方問及國際登報的群組成員是誰人？黎則稱當時未有去了解，因不太關注。法官李運騰問，這個國際登報群組是否與「攬炒巴」屬同一個群組？黎指不是，因他認為「攬炒巴」的團隊是做行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎同意控方所指，Mark Simon 是在向他匯報。控方指出，黎當時已經知陳梓華某程度上參與國際游說工作。黎否認。控方續指，至少有人告知黎。黎亦否認，稱他只是知道陳令國際登報群組與朱牧民一致。控方追問，黎知道朱牧民當時正在做國際游說？黎同意。控方指，因此黎知悉陳某程度上參與國際游說工作。黎否認，重申他只知道陳將兩組人放在一起，這是他僅有的資訊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎不單只叫陳梓華平息示威暴力，亦有叫他參與國際線。黎則稱：「這方面沒有證據，我不同意，是你編造出來的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;控方質疑黎智英以探望孫女作為藉口 向法庭申請離港 實為會見美國官員和議員&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（3日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第126日審訊，黎智英第34日作供，控方繼續盤問黎。控方提及，2020年5月黎被控刑事恐嚇罪，並被法庭施加不得離港的保釋條件，惟訊息紀錄顯示黎其後仍計劃前往美國，其私人助手 Mark Simon 並嘗試安排他會見時任美國副總統彭斯及美國議員等人。控方又指，黎於同年6月向高院申請更改保釋條件，期間僅向法庭提及到美國探望女兒和剛出生的孫女，而從未提及計劃會見美國官員和議員。控方質疑，黎以孫女出生作為前往美國的藉口和掩飾，又質疑黎向法庭隱瞞會見美國官員和議員的計劃。黎否認，堅稱探望孫女是申請赴美的主要原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon在群組引述台灣消息人士指拜登對華政策對抑制中國無用處&quot;&gt;Mark Simon在群組引述台灣消息人士指拜登對華政策對抑制中國無用處&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問黎。控方證供早前提到，人大常委會於2020年5月28日通過決定訂立港區國安法。黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 於同年5月29日創立 WhatsApp 群組「DC Dems」，成員包括他、黎智英、前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚和前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowitz。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 副刑事檢控專員 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月4日，Mark Simon 向群組傳送訊息，引述一名「與蔡英文非常緊密」的台灣朋友評論拜登的對華態度，指美國民主黨打算採取多邊主義來與崛起中的中國交涉，又指如果拜登勝出2020年的美國總統選舉，美國可能會回復奧巴馬的政策，對於抑制中國的進攻將毫無用處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Simon 另一則訊息指，他將會到華盛頓會見民主黨的眾議員和參議員，「拜登團隊似乎滿足於不涉足香港事務，我們可以持續嘗試。」黎回覆：「對，這也是我的感受。我們要花多些功夫在（美國）政府和共和黨上。」控方問黎訊息中的「功夫（effort）」是指什麼。黎指是游說以尋求對香港的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎要求mark-simon趁未有隔離要求之前盡快安排訪美行程&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎要求Mark Simon趁未有隔離要求之前盡快安排訪美行程&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月30日，黎向 Mark Simon 傳送訊息：「美國現時仍然未有隔離要求，我們要盡快安排午餐和其他行程。」Mark Simon 回覆：「美國沒有隔離要求，但是美國政府和國會有。任何在白宮的會議都需要符合規定，這代表有延遲和測試⋯⋯另外，有幾位國會議員在城內，希望我們可以在6月15日再見到他們。」Mark 其後向黎更新情況：「現時沒有國會成員在城內，但是所有資深職員都在那裡，還有國安委的人士，以及當然國務院。當我們有大概日子，我們便可以見彭斯，因此如果他們有會議的話，我們應該沒有問題。這是我星期三聽到的東西。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎當時正在計劃赴美國會見時任美國副總統彭斯、美國國務院和美國國家安全委員會。黎起初稱不肯定，但是在控方和法官的追問下，黎同意當時 Mark Simon 在美國嘗試安排他與不同人士見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The arrest of @JimmyLaiApple in Hong Kong is deeply offensive &amp;amp; an affront to freedom loving people around the world. When I met w/ Jimmy Lai @WhiteHouse, I was inspired by his stand for democracy &amp;amp; the rights &amp;amp; autonomy that were promised to the people of Hong Kong by Beijing. pic.twitter.com/ZwioCrvNb7 — Mike Pence (@Mike_Pence) August 10, 2020&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示訊息，2020年6月8日，黎的秘書將他的計劃訪美行程傳送給黎，黎其後轉發給 Mark Simon。訊息顯示，黎計劃在6月24日乘飛機前往洛杉機，翌日前往紐約，直至7月4日在水牛城尼亞加拉國際機場乘內陸飛機前往華盛頓。黎同意行程，亦同意當時正計劃會見美國的官員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎向高院申離港時僅稱探望孫女-從沒提及計劃會見彭斯等人&quot;&gt;控方指黎向高院申離港時僅稱探望孫女 從沒提及計劃會見彭斯等人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過控方提到，黎當時正面對一項刑事恐嚇罪。他在2020年5月5日被法庭施加擔保條件，包括不得離開香港。黎其後於6月12日到高等法院申請更改保釋條件，希望撤銷禁止離港的條件，惟當時遭法官李運騰拒絕。控方指，因此在黎計劃訪美行程的時候，已經知道保釋條件之一是不得離境。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問黎，為何在法庭施加保釋條件數個星期之後，黎仍計劃去美國？黎稱不知道。李官接著問黎，是否因為如此，黎才會向高院申請撤銷離港限制？黎則稱不知道，指是其代表律師處理相關申請。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼而提到，在黎向高院申請撤銷限制期間，從沒有提及他的美國行程。黎回應，因為他的女兒在美國誕下新生女兒，他記得當時是想去美國探望孫女。控方則指，根據法庭紀錄，黎只向法庭說離港目的是到美國探望紐約的女兒和孫女，以及商談生意計劃等，惟沒有提及打算到美國會見彭斯等人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方並展示5月30日的訊息，黎向 Mark Simon 說：「我正在等待孫女兒的出生證明，希望數日之內會有。」Mark 問到黎的日子，黎回答說：「我的日子是任何你給我的日子，或者他們給我的日子，儘管我很想見到我的孫女。（“My date is any date you set for me. Or they set for me, though I’m eager to see my granddaughter.”）」法官李運騰問黎，探望孫女是不是離港的主要目的，還是另有其他目的？黎堅稱探望孫女是主要目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎利用孫女出生作為到訪美國的藉口&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎利用孫女出生作為到訪美國的藉口&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年5月22日的訊息，黎向 Mark Simon 說：「我會嘗試。首先我要拿到孫女的出生證明，使我的申請具正當性。我希望我的女兒在未來數天分娩，這樣我就可以定下赴美的日子。（“OK. I’ll try. First I’ve to get my granddaughter’s birth certificate to make my application legitimate. I hope my daughter will give birth in the next few days so I can be sure of the date of my trip to US.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎利用女兒誕下孫女作為到訪美國的藉口。黎否認以此作為藉口，「我要去見她，無論如何我都想見她」，又指他與其他人見面，不代表是利用女兒分娩作為藉口。控方追問，但是黎在訊息中說「使我的申請具正當性」？黎則強調當時孫女已經出生了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示2020年5月27日的訊息，黎向 Mark Simon 說：「Jade 昨日誕下了這個既美麗又肥白的女嬰。她的出生證明應該在大約一星期內就有。因此如果我飛去紐約並隔離14日的話，我應該可以在大概6月20日左右吃午餐。我希望可以恢復。在這個危難關頭，這是一個很好的保護。希望亦能見到大老闆。（“Jade gave to this beautiful fat baby girl yesterday. Her birth certificate should be here in a week or so. So if I fly to NY and spend 14 days quarantine I should be able to have lunch at around June 20 or so. I hope is reinstated. It’s a good protection at this time of crisis. Hopefully see the big boss, too.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎訊息中提及「一個很好的保護」，顯示孫女出生是一個很好的掩飾，以讓他到訪美國，並且會見美國的議員。黎否認，指他訊息的意思是在香港的危機關頭對香港的保護。法官杜麗冰則質疑，訊息中「危機」的意思，是指就黎個人而言，他當時被檢控，並且被禁止離港。黎則否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎為何不在高院申請離港的時候，提及計劃會見美國議員？黎反問：「為何我要提及？」，並堅稱他前往美國的主要原因是探望孫女。控方則指出，黎到美國的優先事項是會見美國政府官員。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「大老闆」，黎相信是指彭斯，因他不可能會見到特朗普。控方問，彭斯是黎的「大老闆」嗎？黎否認，反問：「彭斯怎可能是我的大老闆？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認向法庭隱瞞-稱會見美國政府和議員不是一件大事&quot;&gt;黎否認向法庭隱瞞 稱會見美國政府和議員「不是一件大事」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方向黎指出，黎故意地向法庭隱瞞計劃會見美國官員和議員。黎則否認隱瞞，又指會見美國政府官員和議員「不是一件大事」，當時未有勾結外國勢力罪行，一直都有人在會見美國官員，反問：「有什麼大不了的事要隱瞞？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭其後追問，既然黎稱當時未有勾結外國勢力罪，會見官員不會觸犯法律，「那麼為何你覺得告訴法庭不恰當？」黎則稱當時對計劃沒有顧慮（carefree），「我只是不覺得這是一件大事。」法官李運騰追問：「見彭斯不是一件大事？」黎說因為這不是違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認明知國安法將實施仍尋求赴美游說&quot;&gt;黎否認明知國安法將實施仍尋求赴美游說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再次展示6月8日，載有黎的計劃行程的訊息，並指黎當時已經知道人大通過「5.28決定」，香港將會實施《國安法》。惟黎稱，應該是他或 Mark Simon 一時大意，強調就算他能夠前往美國，上述行程都不可能發生。控方質疑，一時大意的說法與黎早前供稱對於《國安法》很謹慎的說法不符。黎則稱，他一時大意不代表行動方面不謹慎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎當時明知《國安法》將會實施，但是仍然尋求赴美游說。黎則否認，並強調只是一時疏忽或大意，若然仍尋求會見彭斯是愚蠢的行為。控方又指出，黎蓄意繼續游說，請求外國實施制裁及敵對行為。黎則表示，即使他蓄意繼續游說，但他是一時大意而沒有為意《國安法》即將實施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年6月13日的訊息，前一天黎向高院申請更改保釋條件遭拒，Mark Simon 向黎稱，美國國安委的職員對於黎未能赴美感失望，但同時關注黎的福祉。控方指美國國安委的人明顯地期望黎到訪美國，黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎到訪美國的目的是尋求外國制裁和懲罰中港官員？黎不同意，並指目的是尋求對香港的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指國安法生效後-黎未要求mark-simon撤回制裁名單提議&quot;&gt;控方指國安法生效後 黎未要求Mark Simon撤回制裁名單提議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2020年6月23日的訊息，黎向 Mark Simon 說：「中國官員的制裁名單有汪洋（前全國政協主席）和韓正（時任國務院副總理、現任國家副主席），以及取回他們的貪污金錢，這是假新聞還是經證實的新聞？你可以查核嗎？」Mark Simon 其後回覆：「目前為止是假新聞。汪洋和韓正被列入數個由香港行動者群組呈交的名單上。但是我們在國務院的朋友表示她會查看名單變到有多窄。」Mark 又提到，上星期華盛頓有人討論名單，有人被要求叫國安委考慮中國官員，但是 Mark 提出只將香港官員列入名單。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，從訊息可見，黎當時關注中國官員有否被列入制裁名單。黎則否認關注，強調因為有假新聞，如果沒有假新聞的話，他不會問 Mark Simon 相關事宜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎想阻止《國安法》實施，所以他想懲罰中國官員。黎則稱他沒有說「懲罰」，只是說要阻止《國安法》，但在控方追問下，黎承認他曾說過「制裁他們」。控方指，若是如此，黎理應關注哪些官員被列入制裁名單。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問及 Mark Simon 的工作是什麼。黎指 Mark 替他安排會議，又會代表他與其他人談話，包括向外國官員談論哪些官員應被制裁。李素蘭問黎有否就 Mark 可以說什麼說話設下界限？黎稱沒有，而 Mark 所說的話是出於自己意願，但是，「我會接受相關結果。」李素蘭追問，如果相關結果是將中國官員列入制裁名單的話，黎又會否接受？黎回答：「對，我會接受它。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，在2020年7月《國安法》生效之後，黎並未有要求 Mark Simon 撤回他向美國國安委所提議的制裁名單。黎反問：「為什麼我要要求？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上要求控方讓他解釋為何當時未有叫 Mark Simon 撤回提議。惟法官杜麗冰指，如果有需要的話，辯方會在覆問階段就此提問。然而黎欲開口解釋原因，隨即遭杜官打斷，並嚴正表示：「我說了不要，你知道『不要』是什麼意思嗎？」黎則回應，因為控方太快轉換話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前美國國防部副部長與國安委討論將中國領導人列為制裁對象&quot;&gt;前美國國防部副部長與國安委討論將中國領導人列為制裁對象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2020年6月1日的訊息，Mark Simon 向黎說，前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowiz 正嘗試在兩條戰線協助，其一是向不同報館投稿，另一方面，他正與美國國安委討論將中國領導人列為制裁對象，尤其是想徹查他們的銀行帳戶，研究有否涉及貪污罪行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4un27qi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ Paul Wolfowitz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，《國安法》實施後，有否叫 Mark Simon 或 Paul Wolfowiz 撤回他們的提議？黎則認為，在《國安法》實施之後，在《國安法》之前所做的事都會變為無效（obsolete），反問為何要做多餘的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎承認曾透過文章請求制裁-惟否認國安法生效之後繼續&quot;&gt;黎承認曾透過文章請求制裁 惟否認國安法生效之後繼續&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方總結有關黎的外國聯繫範疇，並指出黎透過 Mark Simon 與外國人聯繫，當中包括美國議員，並請求外國向中國實施制裁和敵對行動。黎否認。他其後稱，有時候會撰寫文章談及凍結貪污官員的戶口，除此之外便沒有提倡敵對行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DmrWG1d.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ Jack Keane&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指出，黎透過 Mark Simon 與數名外國人保持聯絡，包括前美國將領 Jack Keane、前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowiz、前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚、前白宮資深顧問惠頓及蓬佩奧的助手 Mary Kissel。黎則否認與 Mary Kissel 保持聯絡，只是 Mark Simon 通知他有關 Mary 的工作。控方指上述人士均是「枱底人」。黎則不接受說法，反指他們是「枱面人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IrXSGx9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ James Cunningham 郭明瀚&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，在《國安法》生效之前，黎有透過上述外國聯繫，意圖請求外國對中國實施制裁和敵對行動；而《國安法》生效之後，黎繼續請求外國制裁。黎則承認有透過撰寫文章來請求制裁，但是沒有透過上述外國聯繫；他亦否認在《國安法》生效後繼續請求制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱未有詢問fight-for-freedom-group成員是誰行動關於什麼&quot;&gt;黎稱未有詢問「Fight For Freedom Group」成員是誰、行動關於什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼而圍繞黎與另一名同案被告陳梓華的關係提問。2019年6月26日，Mark Simon 告訴黎將會向「G20登報計劃」提供500萬元過渡性貸款，而黎沒有爭議。直至同年8月12日，Mark Simon 向黎匯報：「我們上次幫助他們在國際登報廣告的 Fight For Freedom Group，已經全數歸還款項。（“the Fight For Freedom Group, ones we helped with international ads last time, has paid us back in full”）」，又提到該團體正在籌辦另一次登報行動，可能需要向黎借過渡性貸款。Mark 續指，「他們在少於兩小時內，已籌得88.4萬美元。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，當 Mark Simon 提及「Fight For Freedom Group」的時候，黎有否詢問成員是誰、行動是關於什麼？黎表示沒有，即使有問也不記得細節，而 Mark 當時只是說「國際行動（international campaign）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎當時不會有興趣知道行動的內容嗎？黎表示沒有。控方追問，如果廣告含「香港獨立」的內容呢？黎則指，若果他們提倡港獨的話，Mark Simon 會提及，又指 Mark 一直都知道他反對港獨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認知悉登報廣告關於制裁-稱一心只想提供過渡貸款&quot;&gt;黎否認知悉登報廣告關於制裁 稱一心只想提供過渡貸款&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年8月17日，黎向 Mark Simon 傳送訊息，問及：「他們眾籌的日子是什麼？他們登廣告的目的是什麼？」Mark 則回答，他們會把籌款用於在世界各地主要媒體刊登廣告，包括美國、日本、南韓、法國和西班牙等國家，相關理念純粹是請求世界支持香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，當時會否視登報行動為「文宣」？黎則稱他並不關注，當時只是一心幫助他們提供過渡性貸款。控方追問黎是否知道登報是關於反《引渡條例》修訂？黎起初稱不知道，又稱對於登報內容不感興趣，但後來在控方和法官李素蘭的追問下，黎改稱知道是有關反修例，因當時社會上沒有其他運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示刊登於《紐約時報》的廣告，標題為〈CATCH HONG KONG AS WE FALL〉，內文指海外人士可以聯絡當地的議員，成為《香港人權與民主法案》的共同動議人，並促請美國政府向香港警方禁售武器。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年8月20日的《蘋果》報紙，標題為〈港人雞蛋抗子彈 10國見報〉，版面展示不同在國家登報的廣告。黎稱可能見過這篇報導及上述《紐約時報》廣告，但是很大機會未有閱讀內文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方則指出，黎當時其實知悉登報廣告內容是關於制裁，他亦有參與在登報計劃之中。黎一概否認。但黎同意他知道登報行動與「Fight For Freedom Group」有關連。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱就報紙展覽費用簽支票時-不知道陳梓華是wayland全名&quot;&gt;黎稱就報紙展覽費用簽支票時 不知道陳梓華是Wayland全名&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方提問下，黎供稱當 Mark Simon 提及過渡性貸款時，並未有提及陳梓華或李宇軒。後來在2019年9月23日的訊息中，Mark 解釋陳是帶領國際登報計劃的人，黎當時才知道陳與「Fight For Freedom Group」有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，根據早前證供，黎先後與陳梓華見面合共六次。首次見面是在中環的日本餐廳，當時李柱銘亦有出席飯局。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示支票副本，顯示2019年10月9日，黎簽發一張支票，抬頭為陳梓華，金額為144,100港元。黎則稱一直以 Wayland 聲稱陳，當時並不知道 Wayland 的全名就是陳梓華，只是 Mark Simon 要求他支付報紙展覽的費用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technology represents a new frontier for innovation, and progress in quantum technologies is essential for U.S. leadership. This report discusses how to accelerate and reinforce U.S. leadership in quantum technologies through increasing research and development (R&amp;amp;D), strengthening the quantum industrial base, accelerating commercialization, increasing workforce development, and building international partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technologies leverage the physics of quantum mechanics for computing, communications, and sensing. Progress is vital for national security and economic competitiveness. While many quantum technologies are in an early stage of development, they will become essential for maintaining the United States’ technological edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is the product of more than a year of discussions, workshops, and consultations among members of the CSIS Commission on U.S. Quantum Leadership, a group composed of some of the leading figures in quantum science and industry in America. It presents a comprehensive set of recommendations to ensure U.S. leadership in quantum technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other emerging technologies, many quantum technologies are too new and too experimental to solely rely on private investment. Private investment in quantum technology between 2019 and 2023 was approximately $8 billion, though this pales in comparison to the booming investment in AI, which has received estimated capital expenditure of over $200 billion based on reporting in 2024. Market forces alone may not ensure U.S. quantum leadership. This will change as quantum technologies mature, but for now federal spending on quantum technology represents an essential investment. Quantum technologies are a strategic outlay since they will reshape the economic and security landscape. Although they may not have the immediate effect of artificial intelligence (AI) or semiconductors, early investment in quantum technologies will pay off later, and as experience shows, it is risky and expensive to fall behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three case studies demonstrate the strategic importance of quantum technologies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum Navigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Electronic warfare (EW) is now central to combat. Quantum sensing remedies one of the greatest EW vulnerabilities: The Global Positioning System (GPS) is increasingly susceptible to jamming and spoofing by adversaries like Russia, China, and even Iran. Quantum sensing technologies offer a secure alternative for military and civilian navigation. These systems use quantum measurements of Earth’s gravitational and magnetic fields rather than satellite signals to provide jam-resistant positioning and navigation capabilities. Inertial quantum sensors can provide precise measurement of acceleration and velocity. This is important not only for location but also for precise timing, which is essential for business and finance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum as a Service (QaaS):&lt;/strong&gt; Quantum computing will be able to solve problems that conventional computers, no matter how powerful, cannot. Rather than compel individual organizations to build their own expensive quantum computers, QaaS provides cloud-based access to quantum computing resources (where computing resources are accessed remotely through the internet), allowing researchers to experiment and businesses to build the apps and software quantum computing requires. QaaS is the most practical path to near-term commercialization. The QaaS market was valued at approximately $2 billion in 2021, and the right blend of investment and incentives can lead to continued expansion for research and industrial growth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Quantum Cryptography:&lt;/strong&gt; Quantum computers will eventually break current encryption methods, perhaps as early as the end of the decade. Whatever the timeline, the United States does not want a quantum decryption surprise from China, as this would be a major threat to both national security and commercial communication. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed quantum-resistant cryptography standards, but transitioning the economy to these new standards will require time and investment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantum industrial base has six elements: research, workforce, materials, fabrication, software, and testing. The U.S. quantum industry consists of over 150 companies ranging from tech giants to start-ups (with perhaps another 400 companies around the world, including in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, and the United Kingdom) working across computing, software, communications, and sensing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The are parallels between the development of quantum technologies and the development of high-performance computing (HPC) in the last century, where sustained federal investment was crucial before commercial applications had emerged. Like HPC, quantum technology requires sustained government support and market-strengthening measures to reach private sector viability and to strengthen national security in the face of technological and military rivalry with China and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technologies may seem distant (and some are), but there are real security problems that the United States faces today that require quantum solutions. EW warfare has reshaped battlefields and targets GPS. Quantum sensing provides the best solutions to GPS vulnerability. The United States’ signals intelligence enterprise is at risk from both opponent decryption capabilities that allow them to read out traffic and opponent use of post-quantum encryption to keep the United States from reading their traffic. Making progress in developing and deploying quantum solutions for cryptography is essential, and both of these areas reflect immediate security problems that require quantum solutions and justify further investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep and expand the United States’ leadership in quantum technologies, the CSIS Commission on U.S. Quantum Leadership has developed the recommendations provided below. The chief conclusion from the report is that U.S. leadership in quantum technology requires taking advantage of the United States’ unique strengths in technology and innovation. Technological investments have paid dividends to the United States for decades. The United States cannot wait for a “Sputnik moment” (when the Soviet launch of the first satellite energized the United States in science and technology) to catalyze investment in quantum. This is not a competition that the United States can afford to lose. The right policies and investments today can ensure U.S. leadership now and into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-recommendations&quot;&gt;Summary of Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching recommendation of the commission is that Congress should double the funding levels for quantum R&amp;amp;D at the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Defense (DOD), and other executive departments and agencies, using a reauthorized National Quantum Initiative (NQI) as the coordinating vehicle (NQI reauthorization bills now call for $2.7 billion). The United States needs to significantly increase current spending to accelerate R&amp;amp;D and guarantee technological advantage over foreign competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-security&quot;&gt;National Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establish a comprehensive quantum sensing initiative for strategic applications, with an early focus on positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should strengthen efforts to speed federal agencies in adopting quantum-resistant encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) should collaborate with sector-specific regulatory agencies to update cybersecurity regulations and set compliance deadlines, beginning with industries most vulnerable to quantum threats, ensuring tailored solutions based on sector risks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By 2030, the United States should amend acquisition regulations to require quantum-safe encryption for critical systems in both the public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should fund a DOD program to ensure a secure supply chain for critical materials and components crucial to producing quantum technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies must take a coordinated approach to export controls to prevent leakage of U.S. and allied quantum technology to adversarial states. These protective measures should be clear, appropriately targeted, and compatible with the goal of accelerating progress in the United States and allied nations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should authorize the use of appropriated funds for joint programs with allied nations to strengthen cross-border commercial and research partnerships in quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NIST should develop shared-use quantum testing and metrology facilities, enabling quantum companies and researchers to access essential equipment and advance prototype development. This should be coordinated with the Microelectronics Commons hubs, which aim to provide quantum tech prototyping capabilities. The program should be adequately funded to ensure it meets the needs of the quantum developer community.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should establish a comprehensive quantum sensing initiative focused on sectors like medical devices, semiconductors, autonomous vehicles, and electrical grid management, with efforts from various agencies working to advance quantum technologies for strategic applications and position the United States as a global leader.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) should initiate a “Grand Challenge” program to incentivize the development of utility-scale quantum computers, rewarding progress toward quantum advantage with milestone-based funding.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Funding to support R&amp;amp;D for quantum applications should be increased.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The DOE, NSF, and Department of Commerce (DOC) should launch programs to make quantum computing resources available to a broader base of researchers, accompanied by increased funding for foundational research in quantum technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should authorize the DOE to establish a program office with $500 million in funding to develop an advanced quantum computing facility and to integrate quantum systems with HPC for scientific and industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce&quot;&gt;Workforce&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should fund the NSF to:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Support quantum workforce development programs, including for bachelor’s and master’s students, to address growing demand for quantum technicians and engineers to build and maintain quantum systems.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Develop and distribute a comprehensive undergraduate quantum science curriculum, enabling broader access to quantum education and preparing students for roles in quantum technology industries.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should expand existing visa programs to bring foreign quantum talent to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous technological investments have paid dividends for decades. Quantum offers the same opportunity. Policies that reinforce research, build the quantum industrial base, and promote commercialization are the best ways to ensure U.S. quantum leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quantum-technology-is-the-next-frontier-for-technology&quot;&gt;Quantum Technology Is the Next Frontier for Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology is an arena for competition among countries and companies. The connection between technology and national power is complicated. Many elements must work together for successful outcomes. The connection between scientific research and technological strength is equally complicated, but the reason the United States needs to invest more in quantum technology is simple: Being on the cutting edge of technology makes the United States safer, richer, and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technology represents one of the most important frontiers for innovation, and continued progress is critical to maintaining U.S. technological leadership. This report provides a description of quantum technologies and recommends policies to build U.S. global leadership in quantum technology and ensure future leadership in the face of rising competition from adversarial nations. The key steps are increasing funding for research, accelerating the commercialization of quantum technologies, strengthening the quantum industrial base, creating programs to foster a quantum workforce, and creating mechanisms for international partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum is part of a larger story on the importance of research, innovation, and technology to economic growth, national power, and international competition. Investments in research, science, and technology helped make the United States a global power and remain foundational to U.S. global leadership. As the pace of change and innovation increases, the opportunities for growth also increase, and the consequences for countries that fall behind will be more severe.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Supply chain vulnerabilities for critical components&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While quantum’s full potential will take years to materialize, its strategic importance is clear today. The United States should pursue three broad goals for quantum policy: supporting R&amp;amp;D, building a quantum industrial base, and accelerating the commercialization of quantum technologies. First, the government must expand its support for research to accelerate the United States’ lead and to match and outperform foreign competitors. Research alone is not enough. Government intervention and support for the quantum industry is also necessary. The challenge for commercialization lies in linking quantum technology to the existing U.S. innovation ecosystem, with its successful blend of academic research, venture capital, and commercial markets. Entrepreneurial competition is central to the U.S. innovation advantage, and policies that reinforce research, build the quantum industrial base, and allow for commercializing quantum technology are the best ways to ensure U.S. quantum leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-technologies&quot;&gt;QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Quantum computing uses quantum properties to enable faster processing and solve complex problems beyond the reach of conventional computers. It could revolutionize fields like cryptography, optimization, and AI.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Quantum sensing uses quantum properties like superposition and entanglement to achieve ultra-high precision in measurements, offering breakthroughs in areas like medical imaging, navigation, and gravitational wave detection. Quantum sensors can measure exquisitely small signals with greater stability over long time frames, offering major end-use advantages.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Quantum communications use entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD) to create highly secure communication channels that could revolutionize cybersecurity and data encryption.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technologies exploit the properties of quantum mechanics to provide new capabilities in computing, communications, and sensing. These new capabilities provide advantages for economic competitiveness and national security, but some also create new risks. The United States has made good progress in quantum policymaking, but more needs to be done in light of growing competition. While they present different risks, both China and the European Union are investing heavily in quantum R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the challenges in these areas are not unique to quantum. Expanding the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce has been an issue for decades, and adding more visas or permanent residencies for STEM talent is a perennial request. Quantum is not the only priority, and others take precedence. The CHIPS and Science Act, for example, authorized support for quantum technology but did not appropriate funds. Instead, CHIPS money went to semiconductor production. This was the right decision, but funding for quantum technology research and work still needs to be expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reflects a broader strategic competition driven by critical and emerging technologies, the most important of which are AI and semiconductors. Many challenges facing the quantum sector mirror broader issues in U.S. science and technology policy. There are areas of overlap among the workforce, materials, and, in some instances, fabrication of these different technologies. The key difference is that AI and chips have immediate military and commercial applications, whereas quantum technologies, at this time, do not. This situation will change as quantum technologies mature and applications are created. For now, however, quantum applications remain further away than other emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question then is why the United States ought to spend more on quantum. Spending on quantum technologies is a strategic investment that keeps the United States at the frontier of critical and emerging technologies. The investment required is small compared to the future payoff. This report’s central recommendation is that spending a few billion dollars more on quantum technology out of the $1.7 trillion in federal discretionary spending (about 0.5 percent) is a wise investment for both national security and the future of U.S. competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;United States: $1.2 billion, National Quantum Initiative (2018–23)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China (exact figures uncertain due to limited transparency): $10 billion (estimated), National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences; $15 billion, quantum R&amp;amp;D&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;European Union: $1.1 billion, Quantum Flagship&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Netherlands: $680 million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;United Kingdom: $3 billion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Israel: $350 million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Japan: $206 million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Australia: $650 million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;India: $960 million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Canada: $265 million&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;South Korea: $2.3 billion&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three examples of the use of quantum technology help explain why it is essential for the United States to stay competitive in quantum technology and ahead of its strategic competitors. Races are won by going faster, and while new technologies often come with big promises, there are tangible cases in security and business where quantum will make a crucial difference: cryptography, precision navigation and timing, and hybrid supercomputing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Case Study 1: Reinforcing Vulnerable GPS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the lessons of Russia’s war against Ukraine is that EW dominates the battlefield. Russia, whatever its other shortcomings, has excelled in EW, and it shares or sells its EW expertise to China, Iran, and North Korea. This puts U.S. communications and radars at risk, as well as the U.S. arsenal of precision-guided munitions (PGMs) and other systems that rely on GPS. Work by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) is actively involved in developing quantum sensing technologies for the DOD. The DIU aims to develop mature quantum sensing technologies, including work on inertial sensing and magnetometers to demonstrate their operational utility. Quantum sensors offer significant improvements in precision and sensitivity, enabling enhanced capabilities for military operations. Quantum sensing technologies can be used for advanced anomaly detection for antisubmarine warfare (ASW) and aircraft and can address critical operational PNT gaps for the DOD for environments where GPS signals are unavailable or unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China have developed the ability to jam GPS, which uses relatively weak radio signals from satellites located 12,000 miles away. Both nations have invested heavily for years to find ways to degrade GPS signals, advancing well beyond blunt force jamming, which uses a more powerful signal to drown out GPS. U.S. opponents can spoof GPS signals, create interference, and hack GPS systems. Russia is doing this now in Ukraine, and some U.S. weapons are at a disadvantage. In a war with the United States, China or Russia could even destroy GPS satellites. China and Russia are also not the only hostile countries likely to go after GPS: Iran may have used GPS spoofing to deceive an advanced U.S. drone into landing in its territory, and Syria and North Korea routinely interfere with the GPS systems used on commercial airliners. Aviation officials have expressed concern that this is extending beyond conflict zones, with estimates that up to 1,000 commercial flights a day were affected by GPS spoofing incidents in 2024. These losses can include commercial risks beyond navigation. For example, infrastructure like data centers and the power grid rely on GPS protocols for synchronization and timing that are increasingly vulnerable to even relatively amateur EW technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year, GPS will become more vulnerable. Quantum sensing technologies offer a replacement. Quantum navigation systems do not rely on a radio signal; instead, they use quantum sensing technologies to better measure variations in Earth’s gravitational or magnetic fields. Highly accurate atomic clocks can improve inertial navigation systems, as can atom interferometers and optomechanical systems, and new algorithms can provide precise and jam-resistant navigation. Instead of using a GPS radio receiver, quantum navigation will use onboard systems small enough to fit in combat aircraft and munitions. There are even quantum technologies that the United States could use now to gain an advantage over its adversaries. But quantum navigation and timing have more than military applications. GPS is essential for finance, banking, mining, commercial transport, and logistics. The DOD is already investing in these systems, and there have been successful initial tests. Quantum sensing technologies will create the resilience needed for a world that depends on GPS. The benefits of secure navigation and timing, like cryptography, justify increased federal investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-leadership-and-the-united-states&quot;&gt;QUANTUM LEADERSHIP AND THE UNITED STATES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;where-does-the-united-states-stand&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Where Does the United States Stand?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The United States has strong academic institutions, national laboratories, and private companies. It leads in quantum computing and quantum sensing. U.S. researchers have made advances in developing quantum software and algorithms, crucial error correction techniques, and hardware platforms for quantum computers. Quantum sensors are being developed for applications in medicine, materials science, and navigation. To sustain its lead, the United States must continue to prioritize quantum research funding, strengthen collaboration between academia and industry, make production scalable, and invest in a skilled quantum workforce.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum R&amp;amp;D is often cast as a race among competing nations and companies. If there is a race, it is not just in research but in the adoption and use of quantum technologies. The United States, with its vibrant tech innovation system, has an advantage here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum research is conducted in more than a dozen countries, including China, and is an important area for cooperation between the United States and its allies. Some quantum technologies are already transitioning from research to practical applications. The number of companies offering quantum technologies and services is growing, and quantum applications in sensing are already entering commercial use. However, the “race” metaphor fails to capture the importance of collaboration among researchers in different countries. The ability to build partnerships with other countries, both governmental and private, is a key advantage for the United States. The recommendations in this report discuss how to manage risk and extend collaboration in light of this diffusion of research among many countries and how best to fashion international partnerships that serve the interests of the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6oxPdfZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: National Quantum Strategies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantum industry is global and evolving rapidly, and the number of companies fluctuates with investment and with mergers and acquisitions activity. Publicly available information suggests that over 150 U.S. companies are focused on quantum technologies, ranging from tech giants to start-ups. More than a third of these are in quantum computing, and another third are developing the software and algorithms needed for quantum applications. The remainder work in communications, sensing, and metrology (such as quantum sensors, atomic clocks, and precision measurement equipment) or specialized areas like the production of materials and other technologies needed for quantum devices. There are perhaps another 400 companies outside the United States, principally in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, Israel, Canada, and China, mainly focused on developing quantum computing and software or on quantum communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many technology areas, such as AI, private sector spending outstrips federal investment. This is not yet the case for quantum technology. The U.S. government has made relatively significant investments in support of developing foundational research in quantum technologies. U.S. government support is coordinated under the National Quantum Initiative (NQI), established by the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018. The NQI aims to ensure U.S. leadership in the field by supporting quantum research with funding and better coordination among federal agencies, including NIST, the NSF, the DOE, and the DOD. The National Quantum Coordination Office (NQCO) in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) has overseen these efforts and promotes public-private partnerships through initiatives like the NIST-funded Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C). These initiatives aim to incentivize innovation and expand the United States’ quantum ecosystem. In December of 2024, the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation introduced the National Quantum Initiative Reauthorization Act (NQIRA), which builds on the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018 and would authorize $2.7 billion in funding to further advance quantum R&amp;amp;D at federal agencies over the next five years. It would also place further emphasis on developing practical quantum applications. The NQIRA represents a vital step forward in advancing U.S. quantum leadership and ensuring the United States remains at the forefront of this technological revolution. Through reauthorization of the NQI, the United States will be able to reinvigorate federal funding and R&amp;amp;D in quantum technologies and advance toward a future of practical quantum applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;innovation-in-the-united-states&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Innovation in the United States&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;U.S. innovation is based on researchers, investors, companies, and entrepreneurs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;U.S. soft infrastructure—culture, law, capital markets, and firms providing business and legal skills—gives the United States an advantage.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The five industry sectors that spend the most on R&amp;amp;D are aerospace, pharmaceuticals and biotech, computers, scientific instruments, and semiconductors and communications equipment. Quantum technology will affect all of these sectors, which, in combination with universities and start-ups, form the core of U.S. innovation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There are 945 research universities in the United States, 219 of which have high levels of research activity. Five of the world’s top ten research universities are in the United States. Federal support provides about 55 percent of the funding for academic research.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;University research is complemented by work at 17 national laboratories operated by the DOE, 42 federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), and military-affiliated research labs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There has been a resurgence of research in quantum technology at major corporations, and there are roughly 50 venture capital firms focused on quantum technologies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The tech workforce has seen persistent shortages, but the United States has an advantage in that its universities remain the most attractive global destination for graduate education.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSF and DOE already make substantial investments in quantum infrastructure and research projects—including quantum computers and the specialized chips they use, new kinds of sensors, quantum communication devices, and unique software—since the hardware and software needed for quantum computing is very different from conventional computing software. The 2018 NQI nearly doubled federal spending on quantum research and catalyzed private sector investment. The NSF awarded nearly $20 million to support the construction of a nanoscale fabrication facility for quantum devices. The Commerce Department’s Economic Development Administration has designated two of its new tech hubs to focus on quantum information science (QIS). The Elevate Quantum Tech Hub in Colorado is set to receive approximately $41 million, and Illinois has made sizeable state-level contributions to its quantum ecosystem. These efforts create a robust foundation for quantum technology development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the NQI, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has funded a variety of quantum projects, including on benchmarking quantum algorithms and developing fault-tolerant prototypes. The U.S. intelligence community also spends substantial amounts on quantum technologies (principally in cryptography and communications), though the programs and amounts are not public. Future investments will begin with a strong base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;quantum-technology-materials-and-manufacturing&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Quantum Technology: Materials and Manufacturing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Increased federal investment is essential in the following areas:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Materials science for developing new materials like superconductors&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Specialized raw materials such as niobium, tantalum, phosphorus, and gallium arsenide; rare earth elements like neodymium and yttrium, which are also critical for quantum technologies&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Material purification and quality control processes to ensure materials meet stringent standards for quantum computing and sensing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fabrication technologies for quantum hardware and devices for computing, sensors, and communications, including nanofabrication requiring advanced manufacturing techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition, or laser ablation in highly controlled “clean” environments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Manufacturing and supply chains for component materials like lasers, cryostats, and semiconductors for quantum devices&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without these federal investments, progress in quantum R&amp;amp;D in the United States would slow dramatically, though one of the goals for national policy should also be to build a strong commercial sector. Leading tech companies have made substantial investments in quantum technology, and there is a flourishing network of quantum start-ups focused on different approaches to quantum hardware as well as the needed software and algorithm development. The quantum market, like the markets of most start-up technologies, remains highly competitive, and as quantum technologies are still in the early stages of commercialization, the investment risks are substantial. This means that there are areas where federal spending can reduce investment risk and encourage innovation. Overall, federal policy should support private investment and remedy market failure while continuing to commit adequate funding to public research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of private sector investment in quantum technology has fluctuated. In 2019, investment was relatively low. There was a significant increase in 2020 fueled by growing commercial interest. Investment peaked in 2021, with several funding rounds for quantum start-ups. In 2022, investment remained high but showed signs of slowing, declining from roughly $2.3 billion to $1.3 billion in 2023 due to various factors, including interest rate changes and a shift in investor attention to AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total private investment in quantum technology from 2019 to 2023 reached approximately $8 billion, though estimates vary. Although $8 billion sounds like a substantial amount, private sector investment in AI reached over $200 billion in 2024 alone. AI has immediate commercial applicability, whereas quantum technologies have longer timelines to full commercial adoption, making increased federal investment important to sustain the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much is enough? The recommendations in this report identify areas in R&amp;amp;D, manufacturing, and testing where private investment is currently inadequate because of the level of investment required and the potential risk. As with earlier technologies such as semiconductors, HPC, and even aircraft, government spending is necessary to kickstart the industry; in the case of quantum, it is critical to accelerate the pace of development and in building the quantum industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Case Study 2: Quantum as a Service and the Hybrid Computing Environment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computers are tools that make people more productive, and quantum technology will create better tools. Quantum technologies, because of their close association with computing, could follow a similar path, with access to quantum computing services available on every internet-connected device. Cloud computing—the new face of computing, with computing resources that are accessed remotely—has led to computing as a service, including software as a service, infrastructure as a service, and now quantum as a service (QaaS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers are expensive to build and maintain. This may change as innovations lead to smaller, cheaper machines, but for now it is easier for many companies and institutions to access quantum resources as a service over the internet. Instead of buying quantum computers, companies and researchers can access quantum computing through the cloud, as they already do for many data and computational tasks in the conventional computing environment. Universities and some national programs, such as in Germany, already use QaaS for research. Today, QaaS offers the most likely path for greater commercial use of quantum computing. The QaaS market was valued at around $2 billion in 2021. This is a strong commercial market, and one way to expedite R&amp;amp;D is by expanding access to quantum resources and getting them into the hands of researchers. Some experts call for the NSF or DOE to expand access and offer quantum services to researchers, similar to how they offer HPC services now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers are expected to excel at certain types of problems, such as optimization, cryptography, and simulating quantum systems to provide insights into quantum physics. Many companies are exploring quantum computing’s potential and investing in R&amp;amp;D. Collaborations with quantum start-ups, research institutions, and QaaS providers can allow businesses to adopt and gain the benefits of quantum computing. Many researchers and companies have found that the most productive approach is to blend quantum and conventional computing resources—in other words, hybrid computing—letting each system work on the part of a problem where it has an advantage. Quantum computing may be years off, but the hybrid approach is already being explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the twentieth century, federal investment created the computer technologies that gave U.S. companies a competitive advantage they would not otherwise have had. Businesses are starting to integrate quantum technology into their operations, and the number of companies offering quantum technologies and services continues to grow. Quantum computing will improve data analysis and the performance of AI and machine-learning algorithms. Over time, as in the case with classical computing, federal support could make up a smaller share of investment in quantum as the market and industry mature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-quantum-industrial-base&quot;&gt;WHAT IS THE QUANTUM INDUSTRIAL BASE?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantum industrial base may be divided into segments. This report includes recommendations for each. The question is where to reinforce these segments through government action and where to rely on market forces. Building the industrial base needed for quantum leadership (the network of companies, research institutions, and government agencies driving the development of applications and commercial products) will require a policy that blends the traditional U.S. approach of using science to solve defense problems with the newer Silicon Valley approach, where venture capital and entrepreneurial firms develop products and markets. This has become one of the principal means for technological innovation and creating economic growth, making it a priority for quantum leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each segment requires a different mix of government action and market forces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workforce:&lt;/strong&gt; Building a highly skilled quantum workforce is critical but reflects broader challenges in U.S. STEM education and talent development. Immigration policies, STEM education initiatives, and reskilling programs can help address this shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Federal funding plays a pivotal role in advancing quantum research, which is still too risky and expensive for private industry to fully support. Programs through agencies like the NSF, DOE, and DOD can continue to provide foundational research support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materials:&lt;/strong&gt; Many quantum technologies depend on exotic materials that are costly or difficult to obtain. Addressing supply chain issues for these materials is essential not just for U.S. quantum competitiveness but for overall U.S. technological competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fabrication:&lt;/strong&gt; Developing fabrication infrastructure is vital for producing quantum devices at scale. This includes specialized quantum chips and components that require precision manufacturing capabilities far beyond traditional semiconductor fabrication and infrastructure software to increase the utility and performance of quantum hardware for a wide range of users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software and Algorithms:&lt;/strong&gt; Investments in software and algorithm development are necessary to unlock quantum computing’s potential. These efforts must focus on both developing quantum-specific tools and integrating quantum systems into hybrid environments with classical computers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing and Validation:&lt;/strong&gt; As quantum systems move from research to commercialization, testing facilities and standards are essential for ensuring reliability and performance. Federal programs can help establish these facilities and set benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classical Control Technologies for Quantum Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Quantum computers require advanced classical control systems. Advancing neutral atoms computing, for example, will require very high-speed cameras for fast readout and acousto-optical technologies for rapid atomic movement. The U.S. government can help develop these enabling technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding the quantum industrial base requires early investment. In the quantum sector, a combination of risk and limited demand inhibit early investment in the critical elements of the industrial base needed for future leadership. For comparison, spending on quantum products and services is less than $3 billion, whereas spending on AI is $200 billion and spending on semiconductors is $520 billion. Demand will strengthen over time as quantum technologies mature and commercially viable applications are created, with private investment following demand. Quantum technologies will create new tools that provide competitive advantage to the companies that use them, and sectors like pharmaceuticals, mineral and oil exploration, aerospace, automotive, and finance are adopting quantum sensing and computing. In the interim, federal investment is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some segments—such as the workforce or the supply of necessary (and often exotic) materials needed for quantum production—reflect larger problems for national policy that are not unique to quantum technology. Quantum policy and investment are best seen as part of a larger approach to tech competitiveness. They can serve as a “poster child” for targeted government intervention at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;high-performance-precedents&quot;&gt;HIGH-PERFORMANCE PRECEDENTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more to quantum technology than computing, but precedents for quantum policy may be drawn from decades of federal support for HPC. This support underpinned improved scientific R&amp;amp;D into new weapons. Once commercialized, HPC became an invaluable tool for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like quantum technology policy, HPC policy is at the intersection of science, national security, and economic competitiveness. It began in the 1950s with U.S. investment in computers for nuclear weapons research at national laboratories. The 1960s saw the establishment of computing centers at national laboratories and major universities under DOE and NSF funding. The following decade saw the first coordinated national computing policy through programs like the NSF’s Office of Computing Activities. The United States introduced export controls on supercomputers to prevent the Soviet Union from acquiring advanced computing capabilities. In the 1980s, the United States established a special export control regime with Japan, the only other nation able to produce HPC at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, international competition spurred HPC investment, and economic competition drove spending. The United States created the 1983 Strategic Computing Initiative in response to Japan’s Fifth Generation Computer Project and increased federal funding for computing research. The U.S. response to Japan also led to further increases in U.S. HPC funding and the creation of the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program. The NITRD program was launched by the High-Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991 and was reauthorized by Congress in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2010, the policy focus shifted to exceptionally powerful “exascale” computing initiatives, with the United States, China, the European Union, and Japan all announcing major programs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the 2012 Advanced Computing Initiative (ACI) funded computing infrastructure. The 2015 National Strategic Computing Initiative established a coordinated federal strategy for HPC progress. There also has been increased attention on how quantum computing and AI fit with HPC and expand the scope of computing policy beyond supercomputing; the National Quantum Initiative Act (2018) and the American AI Initiative (2019), for example, contribute to these efforts to expand the scope of computing policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One lesson the United States can draw from the HPC experience is that progress and investment were driven initially by both security concerns and international competition before evolving into a commercial competition that drove improvement. Federal action for building and maintaining a leadership role for the United States provides important security and economic benefits, but there must be a transition to a greater private sector role and increased commercialization. The United Kingdom built the first supercomputer but kept it locked in a secret facility and classified the research; as a result, leadership in computing went elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal funding for HPC was crucial at the onset and continued to be critical throughout a decades-long process of development and improvement. But the ability to commercialize HPC was an equally important driver as markets and applications matured. HPC policy is not a perfect precedent because quantum technologies have many other important applications, chiefly in sensing, but the principal lesson from HPC is that federal action for building and maintaining a leadership role for the United States in quantum can provide important security and economic benefits. It will also require more spending if the United States is to be secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;china-and-quantum-competition&quot;&gt;CHINA AND QUANTUM COMPETITION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is the primary strategic competitor of the United States and sees leadership in quantum technologies as part of this competition. China declared quantum technology a key priority in its 14th five-year plan (approved in 2021). Even before this, the government announced the creation of a National Laboratory for Quantum Science for R&amp;amp;D initiatives in 2017. China has been making significant investments in quantum. While the exact figure is in dispute given China’s penchant for misrepresentation, China says that it spends eight times more than the U.S. government on quantum research. China may even lead in a few areas, such as quantum communications. While the exact figures are subject to debate, given the opacity of Chinese government spending, and regardless of who is spending more, China has likely made a large financial commitment to quantum technologies, and it has clearly defined its national goals for quantum leadership in ways that drive investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-lead-quantum-communications&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s Lead: Quantum Communications&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China has emerged as a global leader in quantum communications. In 2016, China launched the world’s first quantum communication satellite, Micius, which demonstrated secure quantum key distribution (QKD), a secure communication method, over long distances. This was a milestone in developing ultra-secure communication systems based on the principles of quantum mechanics, where information is transmitted in qubits, which are inherently more secure due to quantum entanglement. China has also built its own quantun encrypted network, connecting Beijing and Shanghai. It continues to deploy quantum communication infrastructure designed to secure sensitive communications. These successes are part of China’s broader effort to dominate the global quantum technology race, positioning itself as a leader in developing and applying quantum encryption for both civilian and military use.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most complex challenges for U.S. policymakers involves reshaping international collaboration in quantum research. An example is that the researcher who now heads China’s successful quantum satellite program was a classmate of the researcher who heads the quantum program of one of the largest U.S. tech companies. Both were fellow students at a European University and now are leaders in the quantum community. For decades, Chinese students and scientists played an important role in global collaboration, but this collaboration now comes with risks that the United States and its allies find unacceptable. There is still a Chinese quantum research presence in graduate schools in the United States and Europe, and there are benefits to continued openness (certainly in basic research, a tenet of U.S. policy since the Reagan administration). To restate the basic premise of this report, the United States does better by going faster in technology development and commercialization than its primary competitors, pointing again to the need for robust federal support and a supportive regulatory and business environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is developing quantum communications with projects like the Micius satellite program, initially undertaken in cooperation with an Austrian university. China launched Micius in 2016 and reported in 2017 that it had achieved the world’s first quantum-encrypted teleconference, held between China and Austria. China had security concerns with the satellite, but Chinese researchers announced in 2020 that they had resolved these problems, relying more on secure ground technology to communicate with Micius. Programs like Micius show China’s ability to combine domestic resources with international collaboration to achieve technological breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing technology transfer will be part of the challenge in structuring international cooperation. Trying to slow China in quantum technologies will be less effective than accelerating the United States’ own efforts in the area. That said, it is not in the United States’ interest to support or subsidize China’s quantum efforts, either directly or indirectly, through transfers from partners, such as in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China’s government says it has invested more in quantum technologies, the United States has a much stronger overall position in terms of research talent and ability to innovate. It also has a strong private sector presence in quantum technologies that gives it an advantage that China’s state-directed economy finds difficult to match. This is, as in the case of other areas of tech competition with China, a contest between two different models for innovation and the role of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China is not the United States’ only competitor, it is the only competitor with hostile intent. The European Union and other European countries, like the United Kingdom, are also investing in quantum research. Likewise, Australia is a leader, as are Canada and Japan. One advantage for the United States is that it can more easily develop partnerships with these countries than China can, but partnerships do not happen automatically. This report recommends improving international cooperation using existing multilateral organizations, like NATO, the Quad, or AUKUS, and perhaps developing and strengthening new arrangements specifically for quantum cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Case Study 3: Post-Quantum Cryptography&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptography uses mathematical formulas to make data unreadable unless they are decoded. It is the backbone of online commerce and finance and has major applications in national security systems. In short, the internet depends on encryption. Currently, forcibly decrypting data can take centuries due to the immense computational demand and relative slow speed of conventional computers. But quantum computers, with their immensely greater speed, will be able to perform the calculations needed to rapidly decrypt data at will. While quantum decryption is not possible now, it is part of the strategic competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some advanced U.S. adversaries, such as China, are likely collecting and storing encrypted data obtained through signals intelligence or over the internet for decryption later, when quantum computers are available. The United States probably does this as well. Although it is a highly debated topic, the best current estimate of when quantum decryption could become available is in the next 6 to 10 years. Without adequate preparation, quantum decryption will reshape the security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-known story illustrates this risk. In 1941, the British, using a combination of traditional espionage, the most advanced computing capabilities of the time, and sheer human talent, read the encrypted messages of the Nazi German high command without the Germans knowing. Some estimates say this shortened World War II by two to three years. Covert decryption was also central to improving U.S. fortunes in the Pacific War. If China makes breakthroughs in quantum technologies that give it a similar advantage (and it is working hard to do so), it will not announce them, but the United States will face unexpected setbacks and surprises as a result. The damage will extend well beyond the military realm, as intellectual property, commercial information, and financial data will all be vulnerable. The risk to cryptography alone justifies spending on quantum technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the risks, NIST led a process to create post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and in August 2024 published standards for quantum-resistant cryptography. The transition to PQC will not be the first time encryption standards have changed to adjust to better computing. In the late 1990s, NIST developed a replacement standard called the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Changing encryption standards is a lengthy process since new products and standards must be created and then installed across the economy to replace older encryption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of PQC will likely be more complicated than the previous transition to AES. The transition to AES took several years but was accelerated by a 2002 requirement for mandatory use by all federal agencies. NIST predicts that without large-scale implementation planning, the PQC transition will take years, during which the United States may be vulnerable. The National Security Agency has recommended using NIST’s PQC algorithms as the best way to secure against the quantum decryption threat, and with the release of the NIST standards, a strong market for post-quantum communications is emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;NEXT STEPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These above cases help make the case for why increased federal spending is essential for technological leadership. They point to why, without increased federal investment, quantum technologies will not be built at the pace or scale needed for national security or commercial advantage. Policymakers do not need to be experts in quantum mechanics to make informed strategic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition over quantum technology is not the first the United States has faced. One of the initial contests occurred after the Cold War launch of the Sputnik satellite, which energized the United States to fund its science and technology enterprise. The U.S. economy and military continue to reap the benefits of investments that began in the 1950s and those that followed them. In part, Sputnik motivated the United States to create its mix of strong research universities, flexible financial systems, competitive business focus on technology, and a fast-moving, risk-taking entrepreneurial culture. Other countries also have these strengths but not at the same scale or scope. The United States may not have something as dramatic as the Sputnik moment to energize investment this time, but with the right policies, quantum technology will be another U.S. success story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum technologies are best thought of as providing better tools for business and security. They create new tools that provide a competitive advantage to the companies that use them, and there is already widespread interest and exploration of both sensing and computing in sectors like pharmaceuticals, mineral and oil exploration, aerospace, automobiles, and finance. Quantum computing is an exciting technology with the potential to revolutionize industries and create new business opportunities. However, it also brings several challenges that need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments can shape innovation and markets by lowering costs, changing rules, and providing resources. The United States can use government policy and federal investment to accelerate the development and use of quantum technologies, which are necessary for technological leadership and national security. These actions span increased funding, strengthened collaboration with allies, education and workforce development, infrastructure improvements, and development of an innovation-friendly regulatory environment. Recommendations for quantum leadership are provided in the following section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the physics research of the twentieth century and the HPC investments of 60 years ago laid the foundation for today’s security and digital economy, quantum physics and the technologies that grow from it will shape the economy of the future, but this will not happen without supportive federal policies. While much progress in building quantum technologies has been made, more needs to be done. This report lays out what is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-security-1&quot;&gt;NATIONAL SECURITY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Establish a quantum sensing initiative, with an early focus on PNT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should mandate a comprehensive quantum sensing initiative to advance the development and deployment of quantum technologies for strategic applications. This will help pave the way for future applications for quantum sensors across government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop quantum navigation technologies. The DOD, in coordination with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), should accelerate the development of quantum inertial and magnetic anomaly–based navigation technologies to enable reliable navigation for military and civilian aircraft and ships, even in GPS-denied environments. While current military initiatives emphasize sensor quality and miniaturization, expanded efforts are needed to address the cost and manufacturability challenges faced by the civilian aviation industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create high-resolution mapping programs. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) should establish a comprehensive program to produce high-resolution magnetic anomaly maps and improved gravity maps of the United States. These maps are critical for the effective use of quantum navigation and resource mapping technologies. Without authoritative and precise mapping, the potential performance gains from quantum magnetic anomaly and quantum inertial navigation systems will remain limited, affecting their value for both civil and military applications.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pursue international collaboration for global mapping. Recognizing that navigation and resource mapping extend beyond U.S. borders, the U.S. government should engage in partnerships with allied nations to develop and share high-resolution magnetic and gravity maps. Such international cooperation enhances the utility of quantum technologies and contributes to global interoperability and strategic collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should increase efforts to accelerate the adoption of quantum-resistant encryption by federal agencies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OMB must not only direct the adoption of quantum-resistant encryption within government but also track compliance and progress. Transitioning to quantum-resistant encryption (also called post-quantum cryptography, or PQC) is essential to protect sensitive information from future quantum-based attacks. The OMB’s progress to date in directing agencies toward quantum transitions has been valuable, but follow-through is necessary to ensure agencies continue to prioritize encryption updates. The OMB can use its authority over budgets to make agency funding contingent on meeting defined benchmarks for the implementation of quantum-resistant encryption, such as requiring agencies to show progress in the completion of risk assessments, piloting quantum-resistant solutions, and fully implementing quantum-safe encryption standards. The OMB already requires federal agencies to report on their cybersecurity progress through the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA). This reporting could be expanded to include quantum-resistant encryption readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. The Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) should collaborate with sector-specific regulatory agencies to update cybersecurity regulations and set compliance deadlines for industries vulnerable to quantum threats, ensuring tailored solutions based on sector risks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could include new compliance deadlines for industries to adopt quantum-safe encryption and mandatory risk assessments for sectors that handle high volumes of sensitive data. Each industry has different requirements and risks, so tailored regulations are essential. A public process, led by the OMB and ONCD, should be developed to encourage private sector participation using financial incentives, such as tax credits, grants, and regulatory relief for companies that lead the way in adopting quantum-resistant technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. By 2030, acquisition regulations should be amended to require quantum-safe encryption for critical systems in both the public and private sectors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal information processing standards (FIPS) govern federal information security practices and private sector contracts with federal agencies. In 2024, NIST created three FIPS for PQC, which the secretary of commerce has approved, designed to resist potential attacks by future quantum computers. By 2030, NIST should amend the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) to require quantum-resistant encryption for critical public and private systems. Incorporating quantum-resistant algorithms ensures that systems managing classified information, healthcare records, energy grids, financial systems, and other sensitive public data are protected against quantum decryption attacks. It will also mitigate risks related to “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. The United States should create programs to ensure a robust supply chain for the raw and processed materials necessary for quantum technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secure supply chain promises independence from foreign adversaries, reducing reliance on materials that may be restricted by other countries, particularly China, which could use their control over critical resources for coercive purposes. Examples include helium-3 (used in cryogenic systems for cooling quantum computers and sensors), isotopically pure silicon (used in quantum processors for certain types of qubits, such as silicon-based spin qubits), lithium niobate (a widely used material for quantum photonics applications, such as modulators and waveguides in quantum communication systems), and nitrogen-vacancy diamonds (diamonds containing atomic-scale defects that can be manipulated for quantum sensing and quantum communication purposes). Ensuring access to these materials and the processes used to refine them will be of paramount importance in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Congress should fund a DOD program to ensure a secure supply chain for critical materials crucial to producing quantum technologies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD should create forecasting systems to anticipate future needs based on expected advances in quantum technologies, allowing for proactive management of supply chains. The DOD’s Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) has already put out a notice of funding availability on a direct loan program supporting the purchase of manufacturing equipment. Quantum is one of the categories the OSC is investing in. The DOD, in collaboration with other agencies, could also establish strategic reserves of critical materials such as helium-3 and isotopically pure silicon to ensure the United States has secure access to materials even during global shortages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. Strengthen supply chain cooperation with allies and friendly nations that produce or refine critical materials.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be achieved by establishing cooperative agreements with countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, and the members of the European Union that are rich in natural resources or have advanced material refinement capabilities. The United States should pursue agreements with these countries to facilitate preferential access to materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop a common approach to export controls.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. The United States and its allies must take a coordinated approach to export controls to limit leakage of U.S. and allied technology to adversarial nations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common export control frameworks among the United States’ European and Asian allies can mitigate national security risks without greatly hindering commercial and academic collaboration. By harmonizing export policies, allied countries can ensure the technologies are shared among trusted partners while keeping sensitive technologies out of adversaries’ hands. The AUKUS agreement’s Pillar 2 outlines the need to align the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom on export control processes for strategic technologies, including quantum. This should be expanded to include other allied nations, and the United States should create a Quantum Technology Export Control Working Group to align export control policies and use this group to update the Wassenaar Arrangement to include quantum technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand cooperation with allies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9. Congress should authorize the use of appropriated funds for joint programs with allied nations to expand reciprocal cross-border partnerships.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has made great strides in forging government-to-government relationships, signing 12 quantum cooperation agreements with allied nations, a significant gap remains in facilitating cross-border commercial and research partnerships. U.S. quantum companies still face challenges in securing R&amp;amp;D funding or commercial contracts in overseas markets, and foreign companies struggle with entering the U.S. market and accessing government funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policies should emphasize commercialization and practical applications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;10. The United States should reduce regulatory impediments to private quantum investment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global quantum market is rapidly evolving, and mergers and acquisitions of quantum technology companies can strengthen expertise and drive commercialization. The Departments of Commerce and the Treasury should take a proactive approach and review existing regulations for export controls and foreign investment to streamline (consistent with national security concerns) approvals for friendly countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;11. NIST should develop shared-use quantum testing and metrology facilities, enabling quantum companies and researchers to access essential equipment and advance prototype development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantum industry is highly fragmented, with companies exploring diverse technical approaches. Each approach has unique testing and validation needs, but there are commonalities in the enabling technologies these require, such as cryogenics, radio frequency (RF) control electronics, and precision timing. Quantum technology companies often struggle to find commercial facilities with the capacity to test exotic materials, microelectronics, and other components. This is also true for quantum-adjacent companies, such as energy companies that wish to experiment with quantum computing but lack their own cryogenics facilities or other capabilities needed to validate that components work. Shared-use testing and metrology facilities allow quantum companies to access the expensive, specialized equipment they would otherwise struggle to acquire, enabling them to rapidly iterate on design and prototype new quantum technologies. Shared facilities should include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;shared cryogenics facilities, such as vacuum chambers and other essential equipment to maintain ultra-low temperature environments;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;shared metrology and calibration tools, including tools for quantum state tomography, noise characterization tools, and frequency signal analyzers to validate control electronics, particularly those operating in the microwave and RF spectrum;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;control electronics and microwave test beds, including high-speed arbitrary waveform generators, microwave signal generators, and RF amplifiers designed to work in the gigahertz regime;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cleanrooms for nanofabrication and material characterization, including those equipped with electron beam lithography, atomic layer deposition, and etching tools; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;material characterization tools like scanning electron microscopes, atomic force microscopes, and X-ray diffraction systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In addition to national security applications, Congress should establish a quantum sensing initiative.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;12. Quantum sensing technologies can be used for antisubmarine warfare and aircraft detection. In addition to national security applications, Congress should establish a quantum sensing initiative focused on sectors like medical devices and semiconductors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress in quantum sensing applications will help position the United States as a global leader. As with other quantum efforts, NIST, DARPA, and the DOE should lead development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These technologies, which could include low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetoencephalography, and magnetocardiography, promise significant improvements in diagnostic capabilities through enhanced sensitivity and noninvasive imaging techniques. Investing in quantum medical devices will improve health outcomes and maintain the United States’ position as a global leader in cutting-edge healthcare technology. Quantum sensing technology is also being developed for use in manufacturing, research, and security. It can be used in semiconductor manufacturing to detect defects at a nanoscale without significantly disrupting production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a quantum grand challenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;13. DARPA should initiate a grand challenge program to incentivize the development of utility-scale quantum computers, rewarding progress toward quantum advantage with milestone-based funding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition should be modeled after the highly successful XPRIZE competition. It could include investment collaboration with the OSC. The original grand challenge cost around $50 million, with a $1 million prize. This commission estimates that a quantum challenge could cost over $2 billon. A quantum grand challenge would be more expensive, and DARPA may need to offer a substantial prize to incentivize researchers and companies. It might also need to fund associated quantum research efforts for participating teams. The R&amp;amp;D costs could be extensive, but a competition could be effective, as it rewards success and spurs private sector investment. Finding valuable applications for quantum computers requires time and great expense. This is too large a chasm to risk depending solely on private funding. Milestone payments from the challenge program could help bring the market forward to support private investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-1&quot;&gt;RESEARCH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There needs to be significant increases in current spending to accelerate R&amp;amp;D and guarantee technological advantage over foreign competitors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;14. Fund and expand DARPA benchmarking and quantum computing R&amp;amp;D programs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DARPA’s benchmarking and quantum computing R&amp;amp;D programs target significant defense applications of quantum computing and fund technology development for private companies to advance those applications. These programs should be extended and given the funding needed to sustain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;15. Fund ARPA-E, ARPA-I, and ARPA-H to support quantum application R&amp;amp;D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers are of little value without the algorithms and associated software. Progress in quantum algorithms is as critical as the hardware itself. Focusing on both algorithmic advancements and application benchmarking will help bridge the gap between theoretical quantum research and practical quantum applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each field—energy (ARPA-E), health (ARPA-H), and infrastructure (ARPA-I)—stands to benefit from quantum computing but requires domain-specific algorithms and performance metrics to determine when and where quantum computers will provide a tangible advantage over classical systems. The NSF, DARPA, DOE, ARPA-E, ARPA-H, and ARPA-I should fund academic and industry researchers through grants, competitions, and collaborative agreements to ensure the United States has the algorithms and software needed for quantum computing’s commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum research programs would help align work with pressing needs in energy, healthcare, and infrastructure. For example, ARPA-E can explore quantum applications for the energy grid. ARPA-H can use quantum computing to explore drug discovery or genomics. ARPA-E, ARPA-H, and ARPA-I could run programs modeled on the DARPA Quantum Benchmarking program to identify valuable applications in their areas, estimate the quantum computer performance needed to achieve advantage, and focus on developing algorithms that address key challenges in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, energy optimization, finance, and logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this effort, the NSF, DOE, and NIST, in partnership with industry and academia, should work to develop collaborative quantum benchmarks. The NSF and DOE should collaborate with industry to establish benchmarking standards for quantum algorithms, ensuring that results are reproducible and comparable across different quantum hardware. These standards would provide a road map to identify when a quantum advantage has been achieved in a particular application to help guide the investment of resources in the most promising quantum technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;16. The Departments of Commerce and Energy and the NSF should launch programs to make quantum computing resources available to a broader base of researchers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite recent U.S. government efforts to provide researchers with access to quantum computing resources, the availability of quantum testbeds remains low, especially for researchers from industry and academia. Providing testbeds would allow for the steady advancement of quantum computing research, exploration, testing, education, and innovation. This would help subsidize private and public use-case development for quantum computers, the costs of which are often prohibitively expensive. Providing access to quantum resources could accelerate the development of applications. Subsidizing access to the latest generations of quantum computers would make it easier for private and public users to develop applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;17. Congress should authorize the DOE to establish a well-funded program office to develop a leadership-class quantum computing facility and integrate quantum systems with HPC for scientific and industrial applications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While quantum computing is still in a nascent stage, the integration of quantum computers with a large-scale HPC system can dramatically accelerate certain types of computational tasks and accelerate the commercialization of quantum technologies. Quantum/HPC integration allows the United States to adopt hybrid computing models that could significantly advance scientific research and industrial applications before fault-tolerant quantum computers are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOE has decades of experience managing large-scale scientific programs and HPC infrastructure. Its national labs have long been home to some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers, such as Summit and Frontier at the DOE’s Leadership Computing Facilities, which have been critical to scientific advancements, from physics and chemistry to biology and AI. This makes the DOE the logical choice for leading the integration of quantum computing capabilities with classical HPC. The DOE also has scientific applications where quantum computers will have meaningful impact. The DOE should have its own procurement program to acquire computers for its use in establishing a world-class quantum facility. This could enable the DOE to not only build the physical infrastructure for quantum computing but also invest in essential workforce development, software tools, and quantum/HPC integration frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-1&quot;&gt;WORKFORCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;18. Congress should fund the NSF to support quantum workforce development programs for bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD programs, addressing the growing demand for quantum technicians and engineers to build and maintain quantum systems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of U.S. leadership in quantum technologies depends on having a highly skilled workforce capable of developing, operating, and maintaining these systems. While many quantum-related jobs require PhDs for research, demand is growing for technicians and engineers with specialized quantum skills at the bachelor’s or master’s levels. Doctoral-level experts will continue to be essential, but a robust quantum ecosystem requires practitioners. Investing in bachelor’s and master’s programs would create a pipeline of skilled individuals. Australia exemplifies this potential through the University of New South Wales, which has developed the world’s first quantum engineering program for undergraduates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;19. Congress should also appropriate additional funds for the NSF’s training programs, which provide grants to universities to support graduate-level training.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NRT supports traineeships across many scientific disciplines, and quantum science should be made a higher priority. Specific tracks should be created within the NRT to train students in the practical skills required for quantum technology. The NSF should also emphasize industry partnerships, allowing students to collaborate with companies during their studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expanding the NSF Graduate Research Fellowships Program to include a focus on quantum technologies would help support master’s-level students who may not intend to pursue a PhD. This could incentivize more students to enter the field of quantum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Labor’s Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act programs could offer grants for workforce training in quantum technologies, specifically targeting apprenticeships, internships, and job-placement programs for workers at the bachelor’s and master’s levels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NSF could fund a national quantum apprenticeship and fellowship program, allowing students at the bachelor’s and master’s levels to gain real-world experience in labs and companies working on quantum technologies. Funding could be provided through the NSF with matching contributions from industry partners. This would give students hands-on exposure to quantum equipment and system maintenance in practical settings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;20. Congress should fund the NSF to develop and distribute a comprehensive undergraduate quantum science curriculum, enabling broader access to quantum education and preparing students for roles in quantum technology industries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, most undergraduate physics, engineering, and computer science programs do not offer dedicated courses in quantum information science (QIS), the logic being that undergraduates need a foundation of classical and quantum physics before tackling QIS. Undergraduates are typically exposed to quantum mechanics in later stages of their degree program. As a result, undergraduates looking to enter the field have few options available other than entering through a PhD program. This lack of early exposure creates a barrier to students who might be interested in pursuing quantum computing, quantum communications, or quantum sensing careers but lack access to dedicated undergraduate programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantum technology supply chain requires not just research scientists but also a large pool of quantum technicians, engineers, and programmers with a strong understanding of QIS principles. As quantum technologies move toward commercialization, demand for mid-level professionals will increase. Undergraduate training can provide the foundation for students to enter these roles directly or to transition into master’s programs or industry apprenticeships. Having a QIS curriculum at the undergraduate level can help build the practical skills needed for jobs in quantum hardware development, quantum programming, and system integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NSF already funds quantum research through programs such as the Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes (QLCI), and it could expand these efforts to include educational components focused on undergraduates. The NSF’s previous work in areas like cybersecurity and AI provides a model for how to structure a quantum science curriculum. Similar scholarship programs could be created for quantum science to encourage students to pursue QIS degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;21. Expand faculty training.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to developing the curriculum, the NSF should fund faculty training programs to ensure professors are equipped to teach quantum science at the undergraduate level. Workshops, online training resources, and professional development programs could be created to ensure faculty are up to date with the latest advancements in QIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;22. Congress should consider expanding visa programs to bring foreign quantum experts to the United States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for highly skilled quantum professionals already exceeds the current supply of graduates from U.S. universities. While domestic education programs are essential for building a long-term workforce, it will take years to train new quantum experts. There are not enough experts to fill the talent gap. Attracting quantum expertise is essential. Other nations, including Australia, Canada, China, and Germany, are aggressively recruiting international quantum talent to accelerate their own quantum programs and build a quantum workforce. Without visa programs that prioritize quantum expertise, the United States risks losing out to competing countries on top international talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of State should work with the DOE, NSF, and DOD to identify key areas of quantum expertise that require foreign talent to ensure competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congress should expand existing visa programs to attract foreign quantum experts to the United States. Quantum is not the only field facing a talent shortage, but quantum expertise should be targeted specifically due to its geopolitical importance. This could include creating a quantum-specific visa program under the existing O-1 or H-1B visa programs for highly skilled quantum professionals, including researchers, postdoctoral scholars, engineers, and entrepreneurs working in quantum-related fields.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States could increase the cap on H-1B visas, with specific allocations for quantum experts. Another option is expanding the O-1 visa, which is designed for individuals with extraordinary abilities in science, to explicitly include quantum expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, many quantum-related fields already fall under the STEM Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which allows international students to work in the United States for an extended period after graduation. Expanding this to include quantum disciplines would provide additional opportunities for foreign graduates to remain in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

While it has played a role in shaping events, its long-term dominance remains uncertain amid shifting power dynamics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many observers and analysts portray Turkey as the primary winner of the Syrian war, with the greatest comparative ability to assert its influence during the post-Assad transition process. A central theme is that Russia and Iran’s declining influence would be compensated directly by Turkey as the emerging dominant power, despite the increasing engagement of global and regional powers with Syria. Observers also emphasise that Turkey has been the steadfast supporter of the Syrian opposition forces, with the strongest communication channels and enormous leverage mechanisms, without underlining the differences between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and Turkey’s proxies like the Syrian National Army (SNA). Also, there is a common view that Turkey has led the initiative to end Assad’s rule throughout the 13-year war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the rapid fall of the regime was the culmination of regional-level developments, and Turkey’s changing policies played a complementary role. A closer look at the evolution of Turkey’s Syria policy reveals that Ankara has not shaped the course of developments after it lost the primary initiative to the US and Russian interventions in Syria. Since the mid-2010s, Turkey has played into the US-Russian competition to secure its military presence in Syria against non-state threats and the risk of another large influx of refugees. Turkey’s shifting alignments with these powers in the conflict field shaped the conditions amenable to the regime’s eventual fall. The HTS leadership, which will have closely monitored this process, will likely follow a similarly pragmatic approach toward foreign actors, potentially diminishing Turkey’s current influence in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-background-of-turkeys-syria-policy&quot;&gt;The Background of Turkey’s Syria Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early years of the Syrian conflict, Turkey’s policy was aligned with the US and European governments declaring that Assad must go, although Ankara adopted a tougher approach by repeatedly calling for an international military intervention. Despite some disagreements on which groups to support, US–Turkey cooperation in Syria continued until early 2015, when the two states agreed to start a train-and-equip programme for the Syrian armed opposition. Some groups joining such US-led programmes defected to or were detained by more radical and jihadist forces like Jabhat Al-Nusra, the predecessor of HTS. Unlike the US – which shifted its focus to fighting radical Islamist groups – and Arab states increasingly preoccupied with their own regime security, Turkey maintained its anti-Assad policies and sustained support to the rebel groups including the SNA, its main proxy force. At first glance, then, it would appear that Ankara finally achieved its objective as rebels departing from Idlib – where Turkey has long provided a shield – subverted the Assad regime, boosting Turkey’s influence in Syria. The longer story is much more nuanced and complicated, just like Turkey’s shifting priorities concerning the Syrian battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Why did Russia give the green light to a Turkish military presence in Syria, which ultimately contributed to Assad’s fall – a serious blow to Russian regional influence?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-growing-deadlock&quot;&gt;A Growing Deadlock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two pivotal developments in the mid-2010s shattered Turkish-US collaboration in the conflict zone and plunged Turkey’s Syria policy into disarray. The first was Islamic State’s rapid capture of Syrian territory, and the second was the start of Russia’s pro-Assad military intervention in September 2015. The US decided to rely on the Kurdish-led People’s Defense Units (YPG) by arming them in the growing fight against Islamic State, while this collaboration paved the way for building a US-controlled zone to the east of the Euphrates as a counterbalance against Russia’s military influence. The expansion of YPG-controlled areas in Northern Syria was accompanied by growing attacks by the PKK terrorist organisation inside Turkey’s borders, while Turkish officials complained that the US arms delivered to the YPG were later transferred to the PKK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, increasing violations of Turkey’s airspace by Russian air forces bombing Syria led to escalating tensions with Moscow, which culminated in November 2015 when Turkish air forces shot down a Russian SU-24 fighter jet. From then on, Turkey’s capacity to impact developments in Syria diminished as Moscow also increased its support to YPG forces, expanding its control along the Turkish-Syrian border. Furthermore, the Kremlin established a de-facto no-fly zone for Turkey’s air forces with the deployment of Russian air defence systems at the Khmeimim airbase in Northern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rapprochement-with-russia-and-its-limitations&quot;&gt;Rapprochement with Russia and its Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting into such a deadlock over its policies in Syria, Turkey initiated a rapprochement with Russia in June 2016 when Erdogan wrote a letter to Putin signalling a readiness to resolve the jet crisis. This process cleared the path for Turkey’s military interventions in Jarablus in 2016 and Afrin, a region under YPG control, in 2018. These operations were made possible through coordination with Russia’s military, opening Syria’s air space to Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did Russia give the green light to a Turkish military presence in Syria, which ultimately contributed to Assad’s fall – a serious blow to Russian regional influence? Firstly, Russia expected Turkey to soften its anti-regime policies in order to bring the conflict in Syria to a more manageable level, and to support Russian-led diplomatic initiatives. In December 2016, for example, Ankara remained silent on operations by the Assad regime and Russia to retake control of Aleppo, while the evacuation of thousands of civilians and fighters was implemented under a Russian-Turkish deal. Secondly, Russia sought to exploit Turkey’s rapprochement attempts to help meet its larger geopolitical objective of driving a wedge through NATO, as Ankara increasingly felt that the Alliance fell short of guaranteeing its security and that the US’s Syria policy contributed to the growth of transnational threats. Weeks before the Afrin operation, Russia and Turkey concluded a deal on the sale of S-400 air defence systems, which still represents a serious problem in Turkish-NATO relations. What Turkey expected from its rapprochement with Russia was to increase its bargaining power vis-á-vis the US and to secure a military presence in Syria that would be of benefit in an era of great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Astana peace process initiated in 2017 between Russia, Turkey and Iran established four de-escalation zones across Syria including the Idlib province bordering Turkey, where Ankara secured military observation points. According to the Sochi deal between Russia and Turkey, the latter committed to clear Idlib province of “radical” rebel forces and heavy arms, although it was questionable whether Ankara had the capacity to achieve this in an area not under its full military control, leaving aside its interests and preferences. Despite the de-escalation agreements, the regime supported by Russia and Iran captured the first three zones and some parts of Idlib, squeezing 4.5 million people including rebel fighters and displaced civilians into a narrow strip along Turkey’s border. Turkey was already hosting more than 3.5 million refugees, with growing social, political and economic repercussions. Turkish military forces resisted attacks by the regime on Idlib along with local rebel forces, sometimes at very high cost. On 27 February 2020, the Russian-backed Syrian air forces bombed a Turkish military position in Idlib causing at least 33 casualties, shortly after Turkish troops and proxies had captured the city of Seraqib at the junction of Syria’s two strategic highways. Following these developments, Turkey’s military presence in Syria faced a growing challenge given the asymmetrical nature of Russian-Turkish collaboration and Assad’s expanding control over the country, creating additional pressure on Turkey’s positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unexpected-fall-of-the-regime&quot;&gt;Unexpected Fall of the Regime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2023, Assad’s continued rule was increasingly accepted as a reality by regional actors, including Arab states, which allowed Syria’s re-entry into the Arab League to decrease its dependency on Iran. Meanwhile, facing domestic political pressure to address the refugee crisis, Erdogan began calling publicly for normalisation talkswith the Assad regime facilitated by Russia. Developments towards the end of 2024 rapidly changed all involved actors’ considerations and calculations concerning Syria. Advancing from Idlib, the HTS-led rebels faced little resistance as they swiftly captured Aleppo and other cities, and ultimately toppled the Assad regime in Damascus in less than two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid collapse of the regime revealed the extent of Israel’s destruction of Hezbollah and Iran’s proxy forces through its operations in Lebanon and Syria over the preceding months. In the past, these actors had played a key role in providing reinforcements to the regime’s army. Russia’s preoccupation with the Ukraine war and its inability to provide sufficient material support to Syria through its air force and navy also had a significant impact. Yet, Russia had never been a key factor in the ground fighting and could only resort to airstrikes on the HTS-controlled cities, leading to civilian casualties as seen in the last Idlib attacks which hit a hospital. Such costly moves would have further marginalised Russia concerning the future of Syria and the Middle East, with little chance of reversing the developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that Assad’s rapid fall could not have been foreseen by many global and regional actors, including Turkey. Some reports suggest that Turkey was informed of the presence of an attack plan by HTS six months ago, but Ankara did not endorse it, fearing that such a move would re-escalate the war between the regime and rebel groups and lead to a growing refugee flow from Syria. According to the Associated Press, Turkish officials declared that the rebel advance starting in late November “was initially meant to be limited” but was expanded as “Syrian government forces began retreating from their positions”. After HTS captured Aleppo and Hama, Erdogan stated that he hoped Syrian rebel forces would advance further, but also added that the resistance of terrorist organisations was continuing and represented a “problematic advance” from Turkey’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the YPG, HTS is also included in Turkey’s official list of terrorist organizations. Although HTS’s existence as the strongest rebel group in Idlib has run parallel to Turkey’s pragmatic interest in preventing Assad’s military operations, the organisation has never fallen under Turkey’s authority. Indeed, Turkey tried to weaken HTS’s dominance by following a divide-and-rule policy between radical and more pragmatic factions. However, Muhammed al-Jolani, HTS’s leader, preserved the autonomy of the rebel group and continued to behave independently from Turkey and its proxy forces. By 2022, HTS had defeated or co-opted many groups in the armed opposition, and asserted its control over Idlib, with the aim of ensuring a military hegemony over different factions of the SNA. The HTS-led march towards Damascus did not include the SNA, Turkey’s key ally, which moved towards the east to seize territory from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led coalition including the YPG as its armed wing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The more instability that emerges in Syria as a result of renewed conflicts, the less capable Turkey will be of shaping developments in line with its priorities and interests.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future-of-syria-and-turkeys-political-influence&quot;&gt;The Future of Syria and Turkey’s Political Influence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history outlined above reveals how Turkey’s changing policies and positions in Syria – driven by its concerns about non-state threats and the refugee issue – shaped dynamics conducive to Assad’s eventual fall, rather than directly orchestrating it. Recognising this can also help us to make more accurate predictions about the future of Syria and Turkey’s political influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having captured Damascus and set up an interim government for Syria’s transformation, the HTS leadership will play a central role in the country’s future. Turkey has a great stake in limiting the radical Islamist tendencies of the group. HTS’s failure to lead an inclusive political transition accommodating Syria’s diverse religious, ethnic and ideological groups would risk the re-escalation of civil war, mirroring the destabilisation witnessed in post-Gaddafi Libya. Such a development would likely exacerbate the refugee crisis along Turkey’s borders and lead to heightened international support for the SDF/YPG forces against extremists, intensifying Turkey’s concerns over non-state threats. Therefore, the more instability that emerges in Syria as a result of renewed conflicts, the less capable Turkey will be of shaping developments in line with its priorities and interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey might be considered to be in a relatively advantageous position that would allow it to have some impact on HTS’s decisions given the maintenance of contacts established in Idlib. The US and Western powers have already sought to leverage Turkey’s contacts with HTS to transmit their warnings and expectations concerning the transition process and the risk of extremist resurgence. However, the main initiative during the transition process will be in the hands of the HTS leadership. As the prime minister of the interim government, the HTS appointed Mohammed al-Bashir, previously the prime minister of HTS’s Salvation Government in Idlib. Almost all officials of the interim government are linked to HTS and its previous ruling body in Idlib. The interim government – which excludes members of other opposition groups including the pro-Turkish SNA – currently assumes all functions and responsibilities in the political transformation process, without any checks or balances. If there were to be a resurgence in HTS’s radical tendencies, it is not clear how Turkey could assert control over HTS’s course of action beyond providing advice and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, HTS has adopted a pragmatic stance, showing signs of de-radicalisation and moderation since the advance towards Damascus, which have led to a favourable reception by Western powers and some regional actors. While these powers naturally seek to impact the developments in Syria, the HTS leadership needs to establish political, economic and diplomatic links with the world to remain in power. The US holds effective bargaining chips vis-á-vis HTS, as it could ease Syria’s isolation and remove sanctions on the condition that the HTS leadership takes constructive steps both domestically and internationally, particularly in its interactions with local US allies like Israel and the SDF. Although Arab states are concerned about HTS’s radical origins and the risks of extremism and instability in the region, they also have to engage with the de facto rulers to manage such risks and their interests. Likewise, HTS needs economic cooperation with regional actors for Syria’s reconstruction. Even Russia has moderated its stance towards HTS to avoid further marginalisation in Syria, with Russian state media beginning to refer to HTS as “armed opposition” instead of a “terrorist group”. Despite the background, HTS may also soften its approach towards Russia given its status as a permanent UN Security Council member with veto power on key decisions concerning international security and sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional developments since the Arab Spring show the increasing flexibility of ad hoc and short-term alignments in the Middle East, as traditional military alliances remain too cumbersome to deal with transnational threats arising from regional conflicts and failed states. Since the mid-2010s, Turkey has efficiently played into the competition between the US and Russia to manage transnational threats and its refugee problem. The HTS leadership will have observed all these developments which have contributed to its rise to power more closely than international analysts and academics. Now, foreign powers are establishing contacts with the new regime in Damascus, marking a shift from the previous situation in Idlib where Turkey provided HTS’s sole opening to the world. If the HTS leadership is to survive in power, it must follow a similar pragmatic policy exploiting the regional interests of foreign actors and the competition between them. This will naturally pose a limit on Turkey’s influence in Syria in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. adversaries are developing capabilities and taking actions that pose a growing threat to the U.S. military and intelligence community across the globe. China, for example, is investing significantly in artificial intelligence (AI) such as DeepSeek, quantum computing, and other emerging technologies, as well as improving capabilities in areas such as information and influence operations, long-range strike, autonomous systems, cyber, and space. China can leverage an economy that has greater purchasing power parity ($31.2 trillion) than the United States ($24.7 trillion), a situation that the United States did not face with the Soviet Union during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s military-civil fusion (军民融合) development strategy—also called national strategic integration—has created a way for the government to direct and facilitate cooperation with the commercial sector and fuse China’s defense industrial base with its civilian industrial base. China has also cooperated with Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other countries to develop greater military, intelligence, and dual-use capabilities that will complicate U.S. military and intelligence activities overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis focuses on one specific area of competition: actions and capabilities below the threshold of conventional warfare, or what this analysis refers to as irregular warfare. As used here, irregular warfare refers to activities short of conventional and nuclear warfare that are designed to expand a country’s influence and legitimacy. These activities include information operations, cyber operations, support to state and non-state partners, covert action, and economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the changing dynamics of great power competition and the implications for irregular warfare, this analysis asks several questions: How might U.S. adversaries evolve their capabilities in ways that impact the United States’ ability to conduct irregular warfare? What types of missions might U.S. military and intelligence units be asked to conduct, and what types of commercial capabilities will likely be required to conduct these missions? How can military forces and intelligence better leverage the commercial sector to develop and implement these capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In answering these questions, this analysis makes two main arguments. First, the United States is not adequately prepared for the evolving nature of irregular warfare. China, Russia, Iran, and other states are developing conventional and irregular capabilities that present serious challenges—and opportunities—for intelligence, special operations, and other military forces across the globe. U.S. military and intelligence units will require disruptive capabilities in multiple areas where the commercial sector has a comparative advantage: battlefield awareness; next-generation intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; unmanned and autonomous systems; influence operations; placement and access; and precision effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the U.S. military and intelligence communities need to fundamentally change the way they work with the commercial sector in order to compete more effectively in irregular warfare—both on offense and defense. Commercial innovation and production capacity in the commercial sector provides a major advantage for the United States and its allies and partners in irregular warfare, including for Title 10 and 50 activities. But the United States has not adequately leveraged these innovations because of risk aversion, slow and burdensome contracting and acquisitions regulations, and a failure to adequately understand viable options in the commercial sector. There is a significant need to rethink the framework of government collaboration with this sector and to treat commercial entities as partners serving a common goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this analysis is divided into four sections. The first examines the growing importance of irregular warfare and some of the associated missions and capabilities. The second section argues that U.S. adversaries, such as China and Russia, possess significant capabilities that will likely pose challenges for U.S. military and intelligence operatives. The third section highlights the growing importance of the commercial sector to the development of innovative capabilities for competition in irregular warfare. And the fourth highlights challenges and opportunities for military and intelligence in irregular warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irregular-warfare-in-great-power-competition&quot;&gt;Irregular Warfare in Great Power Competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irregular warfare will likely be a major area of competition between the United States and China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other countries. It is critical for the United States to build conventional and nuclear capabilities to deter adversaries and—if deterrence fails—fight and win wars. But the financial, political, and military costs of conventional and nuclear war among major powers are high. During the Cold War, the most frequent type of competition between the Soviet Union and the United States was irregular warfare, as the two sides fought proxy wars in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Europe. The same may be true over the next several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irregular warfare involves activities short of conventional and nuclear warfare that are designed to expand a country’s influence and legitimacy, as well as coerce, deter, or weaken adversaries. It includes numerous tools of statecraft that governments can use to shift the balance of power in their favor without resorting to conventional conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Information and influence operations, including public diplomacy and psychological warfare&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyber operations, including offensive cyber operations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training, advice, and other assistance to state and non-state partners&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Covert action&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic coercion&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government officials and scholars have used different terms—such as political warfare, hybrid warfare, gray zone activity, asymmetric conflict, and the indirect approach—to capture some or all of these actions. Some might object to the term “warfare” to describe activities like economic coercion and information operations, but that is not how the United States’ competitors see it. China has used terms like “three warfares” (三战), which involves public opinion, legal, and psychological warfare—none of which include the direct use of violence. Iran has utilized such terms as “soft war” (جنگ نرم) to describe such activities as propaganda and information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the increasingly competitive landscape, U.S. intelligence, special operations, and other military units are likely to conduct several types of missions as part of irregular warfare. The commercial sector plays—and should continue to play—an important role in helping to develop hardware and software capabilities in all of these areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreign Internal Defense:&lt;/strong&gt; Build the capacity of foreign governments and their security and intelligence infrastructure. Examples include training, advising, assisting, accompanying, and equipping the military, law enforcement, and intelligence forces and institutions of partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconventional Warfare:&lt;/strong&gt; Train, advise, assist, accompany, and equip non-state partners that are attempting to resist a hostile actor. Unconventional warfare can involve U.S. or partner forces working by, with, and through guerrillas, resistance organizations, militias, or other non-state organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Inform and influence foreign audiences or counter an adversary’s information, misinformation, and disinformation operations. Information and influence operations can be overt or covert. For U.S. military forces, including special operations forces, these types of missions generally come under the rubric of Military Information Support Operations (MISO).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Strikes or other offensive actions employing specialized capabilities to seize, sabotage, destroy, capture, or recover designated targets. They can also include damaging or disrupting—or threatening to damage or disrupt—an adversary’s infrastructure, or weakening a foreign entity through individuals working secretly from within.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These missions can include overt and clandestine activities as well as covert action, as defined in 50 USC § 3093(e). There are other missions that military operations and intelligence units will need to perform, such as special reconnaissance, civil affairs operations, intelligence, crisis response, counterterrorism, counterproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, counterinsurgency, and hostage rescue and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These missions can include both defensive operations (protecting the United States and its partners from threats) and offensive operations (undermining an adversary’s power, influence, and legitimacy) as part of irregular warfare. Defensive operations generally involve developing resilient infrastructure, institutions, and systems that protect against adversary covert and overt activities. Offensive operations involve conducting missions that weaken China, Russia, Iran, and other adversaries—including within their homelands. Both defensive and offensive missions generally require the support of one or more allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these missions, U.S. military and intelligence units will likely require capabilities in several areas where the commercial sector has a comparative advantage: battlefield awareness; placement and access; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; unmanned and autonomous systems; influence operations; and precision effects. In all of these areas, a growing number of commercial entities can work discretely in the field on a non-attribution basis, operate with flexibility and agility, deploy worldwide, and use secure communications systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battlefield Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to find and fix targets in contested environments and improve decisionmaking at the tactical level. Better technology from the commercial sector is necessary for developing sensors and fusing intelligence from multiple data sources to enhance the domain awareness of commanders engaging in irregular warfare at the tactical and operational levels. Better technology is also important to connecting warfighters and intelligence officers to manned and unmanned platforms and systems. Advances in AI could allow units in the field to simulate thousands of operational and tactical approaches, decreasing the time between preparation and execution of missions. In the cyber domain, this could mean integrating technology and tools to provide an open-architecture command system that is optimized for military and intelligence units deployed in the field. It could also mean leveraging open-source data to ensure forces can access timely, georectified, and accurate information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military and intelligence units need to continue to evolve their relationships with space organizations, such as the U.S. Space Force, to develop payloads that provide forces with space-based capabilities at the tactical level. In addition, military and intelligence units increasingly need redundant and secure communications; examples range from advancements in establishing a common operating picture to updated versions of combined joint all-domain command and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Placement and Access:&lt;/strong&gt; In an increasingly competitive landscape, there will likely be a growing need to work with the commercial sector to modernize platforms in order to operate effectively in contested environments with partner forces. For example, existing aviation platforms need to be equipped with advanced infiltration and penetration capabilities, including terrain-following and terrain-avoidance radar. These capabilities provide rotary- and fixed-wing fleets with radio frequency countermeasures, including for MC-130 special mission aircraft. Other examples involve investing in modernized surface and subsurface maritime platforms, including unmanned and autonomous platforms. In addition, military and intelligence units will need to explore new types of fuel and power for vehicles, communications equipment, laptops that run backpack drones, and other equipment. Power is critical for intelligence. Miniaturized batteries can fuel communications or collections devices concealed in strategic locations. In addition, a push toward more unmanned systems with longer loitering requirements will require high-performance batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a growing need to improve next-generation intelligence platforms, systems, and software that can quickly collect and analyze vast amounts of information on adversary activities for irregular warfare. Adversaries will likely attempt to hide their actions in a variety of terrains, from jungles and mountains to dense forests, subsurface locations, and tightly packed megacities. They will also attempt to use denial and deception tactics and techniques. These challenges will require overcoming the tyrannies of distance (operating over a significant area) and time (reacting quickly when necessary).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the commercial sector, next-generation intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance systems and platforms should be designed to conduct long-range and long-endurance missions at high and low altitudes, often quickly. Systems and platforms also need to provide over-the-horizon detection, identification, and location of radar and communications signals. Figures 1a and 1b show satellite imagery analysis of a Russian private military company in Bamako, Mali, working with the Russian Ministry of Defense. The figures show an expansion of infrastructure, including new barracks, headquarters and administration buildings, revetment walls, and guard positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9sNL5yH.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FlJ9tEV.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several types of commercial technologies that may be important for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions as part of irregular warfare. One is quantum technology, which can potentially break asymmetric encryption and allow the use of navigation systems that can operate in GPS-denied environments. Another is improved space-based technologies, including on-orbit refueling and on-orbit data processing. Hyperspectral and other sensors mounted on satellites could help identify important intelligence using AI and then downlink quickly to a ground-based network. More broadly, advances in AI will help analysts and warfighters scan data from a variety of sources, process it, provide indications and warning, and manage a multilayered battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unmanned and Autonomous Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Collaborative and autonomous unmanned air, surface, subsurface, and land-based platforms produced by the commercial sector will be important for strike, intelligence, logistics, and other missions operating for longer periods of time, including inside anti-access and area-denial environments. These platforms offer some advantages over traditional irregular warfare weapons: they can be smaller and cheaper, offer unmatched surveillance capabilities, and reduce the risk to soldiers. For example, a special operations or covert intelligence unit could utilize an autonomous submarine that could quickly move supplies into contested waters or an autonomous truck that could potentially find the ideal route to carry weapons across dangerous terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, robots will likely provide support for logistics and sustainment operations. Ground robots, for instance, may increase the ability of units to engage in reconnaissance, conduct direct attacks, map battlefields, predict points of attack, evacuate wounded soldiers, and clear minefields. Unmanned systems may carry heavy equipment (like powerful batteries), explore disaster sites, and conduct battle damage assessments. Many jobs that are too strenuous or too dangerous for a soldier could become the responsibility of robots. In densely packed urban terrain, military and intelligence units may need to deploy small, maneuverable robots and drones—including swarms of drones—that are guided by algorithms and can process visual data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technological advances will also be important to counter unmanned air, surface, subsurface, and ground systems, including at relatively low costs. Improvements in electronic warfare to jam targeting and navigation systems can complicate efforts to counter unmanned systems. After all, several U.S. adversaries have achieved what some have called “precise mass,” or the ability to combine mass and precision. Military and intelligence units need to find ways to minimize the effects of large volumes of unmanned and manned systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Influence Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Military operations and intelligence units will likely need to develop greater capabilities to compete in the information space, including for such activities as covert influence and counter-value operations (targeting an adversary’s civilian population). In cooperation with the commercial sector, AI and large language models have significant potential for irregular warfare applications. AI translation and message crafting can provide government officials with the ability to rapidly communicate in any language with anyone in the world. Advances in natural language processing will accelerate intelligence work, helping analysts to sort through reams of text and drawing connections a human brain might not notice. AI will be able to review terabytes of data for influence operations, including tipping and cueing for additional collection or human review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States historically enjoyed an advantage in precision strike capabilities, thanks in part to the “second offset” from the late 1970s through the 1980s. But several countries—including China and Russia—have made significant improvements because of advancements in conventional munitions, sensors, and guidance systems. To keep up, military and intelligence units will likely need to improve precision-strike platforms that are scalable and, in some cases, “attritable”—meaning that their low cost makes losing any one system of little consequence. Examples include kinetic fires, cyber capabilities, and electromagnetic effects for striking targets or countering unmanned systems. Other examples include improvements in directed energy, including for electronic warfare and electronic attack. In addition, AI models may be increasingly useful in helping warfighters predict where to strike, as has occurred to some degree in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in bioengineering can also improve precision effects. The capabilities of CRISPR Cas-9—a technology that allows scientists to modify genetic material such as DNA—have created new possibilities. While scalability will be initially challenging, bioengineering can be used to create energetic materials such as explosives, plasticizers, and binders. New synthetic biological compounds can be helpful in creating stronger polymers for more effective protective gear, such as high-temperature composites, fire-resistant materials, coatings, fibers, fabrics, adhesives, and armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are only a few potential areas in which the commercial sector can play a valuable role in research, development, and production for irregular warfare missions. Several other types of emerging technology—such as alternative power systems, hyperscale and edge computing and processing, alternative energy, digital signal processing, and additive manufacturing—may also be helpful for future missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-coalition-of-adversaries-military-civil-fusion&quot;&gt;A Coalition of Adversaries: Military-Civil Fusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other countries are developing capabilities and conducting activities that will increasingly impact the United States’ ability to conduct irregular warfare around the globe. China presents the most serious threat and has established a program of military-civil fusion—what some Chinese leaders have referred to as “national strategic integration”—that involves developing, producing, and acquiring dual-use technology for military purposes and strengthening the country’s national defense–related science and technology capabilities. In many ways, the concept of military-civil fusion is not new for China. Every leader since Mao has outlined the need to leverage commercial capabilities to support the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Xi Jinping has elevated the concept of military-civil fusion as essential to developing military power. Military-civil fusion is motivated by the reality that the commercial sector is responsible for creating society’s most transformative technologies. It dovetails with such Chinese concepts as “intelligentized warfare,” which involves the use of AI, quantum computing, big data, and other advanced technologies at multiple levels of warfare. Military-civil fusion includes several efforts designed to amalgamate China’s commercial and defense industrial bases, which range from better integrating science and technology innovations to developing talent that is useful for both civilian and military purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Integrate China’s defense industrial base with its commercial industrial base.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Leverage science and technology innovations across military and civilian sectors.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cultivate military and civilian expertise.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Establish military requirements for civilian efforts and leverage civilian capabilities for military purposes.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Exploit civilian service and logistics capabilities for military objectives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Strengthen China’s national defense mobilization system to include relevant aspects of its society and economy for use in competition and war.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, China is developing capabilities—including AI, quantum computing, synthetic biology, automation, and new energy—that could make it difficult for the United States and its partners to conduct irregular warfare and operate in contested environments. Beijing has already deployed AI-powered surveillance and electronic warfare systems, and it has used AI and big data to enhance information operations such as deepfakes. Several Chinese government institutions—as well as companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, and Huawei—continue to develop generative AI technologies for text, image, audio, and video creation. In January 2025, the Chinese AI company DeepSeek launched an AI model called R1 at a fraction of the cost of U.S. companies and apparently using less-advanced chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cooperation with its commercial sector, China is developing an operational concept of “multi-domain precision warfare” that incorporates big data and AI into a broader command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) network. While China has made some technological advances because of espionage, Chinese companies have also been innovative in the research, development, and production of some emerging technologies, including AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also making significant advancements in its cyber, space, air, maritime, and ground capabilities that will likely impact the United States’ ability to conduct irregular warfare. For example, China considers information operations an important way to achieve superiority early in a conflict as part of a broader strategy of “informatization.” For China, informatized warfare is the utilization of information technology—such as large language models—to establish a system that enables the PLA to acquire, transmit, and use information during a conflict to conduct integrated joint military operations. For example, senior researchers at PLA institutions have used the U.S. company Meta’s open-source Llama model to develop an AI tool for information operations. China is also exploring other capabilities, as a PLA Daily article summarized:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Compared with traditional models, ChatGPT applications can efficiently generate massive amounts of false news, false pictures, and even false videos to confuse the audience. They can even use the power of the platform to covertly output values through information products, influence the value orientation of the people of other countries, subtly interfere with the cognition of the other people, and guide their public opinion. Compared with humans, the information generation capabilities of large model technology applications have huge advantages in both quantity and time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, China is developing substantial space-based capabilities that could impact U.S. military and intelligence operatives overseas engaged in irregular warfare. In 2023 alone, China conducted 67 space launches—the most in its history. Working with its commercial sector, China is pushing forward in such areas as Long March rockets, global navigation satellite systems, satellite communications, missile warning, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. China continues to develop its counterspace capabilities. It has fielded jamming and directed-energy systems, demonstrated direct-ascent anti-satellite capabilities, and tested technologies relevant to on-orbit counterspace weapons systems. The PLA maintains both fixed and mobile electronic warfare systems that could interfere with satellite communications links, global navigation satellite system signals, and synthetic aperture radar intelligence-gathering satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is likely to use these and other capabilities to engage in offensive irregular campaigns designed to expand China’s power and influence across the globe, not just in the Indo-Pacific. As Xi Jinping has outlined, China must “adopt an asymmetrical strategy of catching up and overtaking” the United States and the West. China has multiple organizations that can conduct irregular warfare, such as PLA special operations forces, the Cyberspace Force, the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Public Security, the People’s Armed Police, the China Coast Guard, and the China Maritime Militia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vBAWsP7.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next several years, Chinese actions will likely include offensive cyber operations, information and disinformation campaigns, economic coercion (including through the Belt and Road Initiative, the Digital Silk Road, and the Green Silk Road), and espionage against U.S. and other Western government agencies and corporations. As part of the Digital Silk Road, China has worked with companies to develop next-generation cellular networks, fiber-optic cables, undersea cables, and data centers throughout the Global South. In addition, China has used irregular means to expand its footprint and basing access in East African countries (e.g., Djibouti), the South China Sea (e.g., the Spratly Islands), the Taiwan Strait, and other places (e.g., the Solomon Islands).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also presents a serious threat for U.S. military and intelligence units, as it is developing a range of capabilities to conduct irregular warfare and complicate the ability of U.S. special operations, intelligence, and other military forces to operate across the globe. In cooperation with its commercial sector and with the help of China, Iran, North Korea, and other countries, Russia has improved its capabilities in such areas as electronic warfare, autonomous and unmanned systems, precision strike, air and missile defense, cyber capabilities, and space systems. For example, the Russian government has relied on close collaboration with several companies, such as ZALA Aero Group, to produce unmanned systems. Russia has also developed significant space and counterspace capabilities, including a nuclear anti-satellite capability. These capabilities could present a serious challenge to the United States and its partners, as Moscow exports them to other countries where U.S. and partner military and intelligence units operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Russia’s Main Directorate (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), private military companies, and other state and non-state organizations are likely to continue utilizing these and other capabilities to perpetrate aggressive irregular warfare campaigns in Europe and other regions. Examples include assassinations, sabotage operations, offensive cyber campaigns, disinformation operations, intelligence collection, and other clandestine activities. The GRU’s Service for Special Activities is likely to be particularly active, including Unit 29155 (also known as the 161 Center or, more formally, the 161 Intelligence Specialists Training Center), Unit 54654, and the GRU’s headquarters and planning department. Russia will also likely continue to wage a disinformation campaign against the United States, conduct offensive cyber campaigns against U.S. and Western government agencies and companies, and engage in a range of other activities such as assassinations and sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran will continue to wage an aggressive irregular campaign against the United States and its allies and partners across the Middle East using a range of partner forces such as the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas and other groups in the Palestinian territories, and the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq. Iranian companies, such as the state-owned corporations HESA and Shahed Aviation Industries, will likely continue to play an important role in the research, development, and production of weapons systems to conduct irregular warfare and to counter U.S. government agencies engaged in irregular warfare. In addition, Iranian government agencies, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and their non-state partners will likely improve their offensive cyber capabilities and their ability to conduct attacks against the United States and its allies and partners at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other states will likely continue to provide military, technological, and economic aid to each other; share tactics, techniques, and procedures; and proliferate capabilities in ways that threaten U.S. special operations, intelligence, and other U.S. government actions across the globe. Starting in 2022, for example, China provided substantial aid to Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine, including semiconductors and microelectronics for use in Russian weapons systems, precision machine tools, titanium and magnesium alloys, spare parts, drones, and military contractors. Chinese companies such as Xiamen Limbach helped design and develop Russia’s Garpiya series long-range attack unmanned aerial vehicle, in collaboration with Russian defense firms like JSC Aerospace Defense Concern Almaz-Antey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has exported drones (including the Shahed-136) to Russia, as well as artillery shells, ammunition, and short-range ballistic missiles. Russia has potentially supplied—or may supply—Iran with Yak-130 pilot training aircraft, Su-35 multirole fighter jets, Mi-28 attack helicopters, and S-400 air defense systems, as well as aid to Iran’s space and missile programs. In addition, Russia has provided Iran and some of its partners with intelligence and targeting support. Finally, North Korea has provided artillery rounds (including 152 mm and 122 mm rounds); soldiers; rockets; KN-23, KN-24, and KN-25 solid propellant, short-range ballistic missiles; and other defense materiel to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cooperation will likely strengthen all four countries’ respective capabilities in ways that complicate the actions of U.S. military (including special operations) and intelligence units. Table 2 summarizes some of the main types of military and dual-use cooperation that has occurred between Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;commercial-sector-advantages&quot;&gt;Commercial Sector Advantages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commercial sector is a hub for innovation and presents a significant opportunity for providing irregular warfare capabilities to be used against these and other adversaries. During the Cold War, much of the defense-related funding for the private sector—including companies based in Silicon Valley and along Route 128 in Massachusetts—came from the Department of Defense, especially from such organizations as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But funding changed dramatically beginning in the late 2010s. Venture capital and private equity firms poured billions of dollars into start-ups and other defense companies that developed space and cyber capabilities, AI, quantum computing, autonomous platforms, and a wide array of other hardware and software. Not to be outdone, a growing list of technology companies—such as Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and Google—also entered the defense market and developed cutting-edge technologies and systems essential for military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venture capital space has seen a high volume of activity. In 2013, venture capital firms secured 184 deals in defense technology for a total value of $1.9 billion. In 2021, there were 848 deals (nearly five times as many) for a total value of $40.5 billion (more than 21 times as much). By 2023, venture capital investments in defense technology totaled $35 billion from 627 deals. The primary investment areas included advanced computing and software ($3.7 billion); sensing, connectivity, and security ($3.7 billion); and space technology ($3.5 billion). All of these areas have applications in irregular warfare. The trend lines show a steady increase in the deal count and deal value of venture capital defense investment as firms have become increasingly willing to invest in space technology, autonomous platforms, and other areas with commercial and defense applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NjL2Plu.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Lux Capital, General Catalyst, Shield Capital, Accel Partners, Razor’s Edge Ventures, and Founders Fund have invested in defense and intelligence start-ups. In addition, several big defense contractors have created their own venture capital funds: Lockheed Martin launched Lockheed Martin Ventures, and Raytheon established Raytheon Ventures. Some venture capital investments have been successful, such as SpaceX (which produces advanced rockets and spacecraft), Palantir (software), Anduril (autonomous platforms and advanced technology), Shield AI (AI-powered systems and technology), HawkEye 360 (geospatial analytics), Skydio (drones), Rebellion Defense (advanced software powered by AI and other emerging technology), and Epirus (electronic warfare and advanced electronics).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the European Investment Fund agreed to provide €175 million (approximately $182 million) to venture capital and private equity funds that invest in European companies conducting research and development of innovative technologies with both defense and commercial applications. The European Commission also launched a €95.5 billion (approximately $100 billion) Horizon Europe program to support companies conducting research and development on dual-use technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet venture capital is not the only area in which the private sector has made defense investments. Private equity is another. The modern private equity industry developed in the late 1970s and was pioneered by New York–based investment company Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;amp; Company, or KKR. Unlike venture capital funds, which focus on start-ups, private equity firms raise funds from financial institutions, pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, and wealthy individuals to acquire and then sell established companies. Before 2000, private equity firms were relatively uninterested in the defense market, as they correctly perceived it as a closed shop dominated by a small number of defense primes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2010s, however, private equity acquisitions of defense and intelligence firms significantly increased. Between 2004 and 2009, there was an average of 67 deals per year. But it doubled over the next decade, averaging 120 deals per year between 2015 and 2021. Investors also went after larger defense companies. Prior to 2010, private equity firms generally bought small or midsize defense companies. By 2021, however, firms were involved in deals for companies of all sizes. The median size of a deal in 2000 was $50 million; by 2021, that had jumped to nearly $350 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private equity firms gobbled up companies in such sectors as cyber, intelligence, additive manufacturing, defense electronics, space, drones, and sensors. Private equity firms remained active in the defense sector through 2025, including by acquiring companies that produced “disruptive” technologies (innovations that might change the way militaries operate) such as unmanned systems, AI, quantum computing, cyber, and hypersonics. Examples of private equity firms in the defense sector included Arlington Capital Partners, Carlyle Group, Cerberus Capital Management, McNally Capital, Stellex Capital Management, and Veritas Capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-and-opportunities&quot;&gt;Challenges and Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The budding commercial sector in the United States and other countries provides enormous opportunities for U.S. government agencies engaged in irregular warfare. Such organizations as In-Q-Tel and the Defense Innovation Unit have improved the government’s connection to the commercial sector. But there are still significant barriers to cooperation. This section identifies several challenges and opportunities for military and intelligence to more effectively work with the private sector on irregular warfare capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Understanding the Commercial Sector:&lt;/strong&gt; There is still a lack of awareness and expertise among general officers, warfighters, and intelligence personnel about the types of capabilities and technologies that are available to help conduct irregular warfare. Indeed, military and intelligence leaders typically have a much better understanding of emerging technology and commercial sector opportunities after they retire. Some events—such as SOF Week, held each year in Tampa, Florida—have brought together special operations forces and the private sector. But more needs to be done. Military and intelligence leaders need to interact more routinely with industry leaders to better understand commercial sector innovations and communicate government needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible solution is to increase the opportunity for military and intelligence personnel to conduct “externships” with the private sector. Externships are typically short-term fellowships with companies for the purpose of better understanding commercial capabilities and practices. U.S. military services and the intelligence community have established fellowship programs with think tanks and academic institutions to improve their research, analytical, strategy, leadership, and critical-thinking skills. But externships with commercial companies are less common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option to improve partnerships between the government and commercial sector is to establish or augment programs that help transition soldiers and intelligence operators from government service to the private sector. For example, SkillBridge is a Department of Defense program that gives service members the opportunity to conduct training, apprenticeships, and internships during the last 180 days of their military service. Retired military and intelligence personnel in the commercial sector can be critical conduits for the government. In addition, military and intelligence organizations should better leverage a range of organizations—such as the Defense Innovation Unit, In-Q-Tel, the CIA Transnational and Technology Mission Center, and the Office of Strategic Capital—that have established close connections with the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimizing Risk Aversion:&lt;/strong&gt; There is still far too much risk aversion in military and intelligence cultures regarding cooperation with the commercial sector. In some cases, government policies and regulations make it difficult for government personnel to meet with the commercial sector to better understand innovations and communicate government needs. Government lawyers are sometimes overly restrictive in allowing interaction with the commercial sector or have unnecessarily high barriers to taking even informational briefings from the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military and intelligence organizations at the Pentagon, CIA headquarters, and out in the field should reexamine and reevaluate their policies and procedures to distinguish between legal requirements and outdated policy impediments. General officers, flag officers, and senior intelligence service personnel should establish a culture that allows lower-level staff, where appropriate and legal, to better identify and understand emerging capabilities in the technology sector in such areas as battlefield awareness; placement and access; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; unmanned and autonomous systems; influence operations; and precision effects. Developing a strategy to promote leaders—and future leaders—who are willing to take calculated risks to understand emerging technologies is necessary to foster innovation and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conducting More Offensive Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States needs to work more closely with the commercial sector to develop capabilities to wage offensive information operations against China, Russia, Iran, and other countries in ways that are consistent with U.S. laws and democratic ideals. Democracy, a free press, and open access to information are threats to authoritarian regimes. Their political systems and attempts to control access to information—including through state-run media—make them vulnerable to U.S. and Western information campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By leveraging commercial technologies, the United States and its partners should target the domestic populations of China, Russia, Iran, and other countries through covert, clandestine, and overt means, where appropriate. The commercial sector can be helpful in developing and utilizing AI, large language models, and software that directs information to specific audiences that Beijing, Moscow, Tehran, and other regimes are attempting to control. Offensive information operations could focus on a range of issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Domestic grievances and societal divisions. Anti-regime riots, protests, and demonstrations highlight the weakness of the regimes in China, Russia, and Iran. All three of these countries have faced—and will likely face—protests from their local populations because of economic, political, cultural, health, and other grievances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Human rights abuses, including the arrest, torture, and assassination of defectors, political opponents, and those investigating or prosecuting corruption and human rights abuses (such as journalists and lawyers).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Problems with regional economic campaigns—such as China’s Belt and Road Initiative—that sometimes place exorbitant debt on countries. Beijing, for instance, often relies on Chinese labor and companies overseas rather than on local workers and local companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Corruption and cheating scandals, which are pervasive in China, Russia, and Iran. In China, for example, PLA officers have frequently paid bribes to get promoted. China’s defense industrial base has also been plagued by corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic problems, including high unemployment (particularly youth unemployment), rising government debt, low growth, high inflation, and massive income disparity, all of which these regimes may—and already do—try to hide from their populations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Espionage and clandestine influence overseas, including at universities, corporations, and government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, irregular warfare involved taking risks. In some cases, as with the CIA’s covert action program to support Solidarity in the 1980s (codenamed QRHELPFUL), those risks paid off by weakening the Soviet Union and its partners. But in other cases significant mistakes were made, such as when U.S. officials during the Reagan administration illegally sold arms to Iran and used the proceeds to fund the Contras in Nicaragua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of these risks, some officials will strongly resist engaging in offensive irregular warfare. But this would be a mistake. While it is important to weigh the pros and cons of specific actions, the United States would never have succeeded in undermining Soviet power and influence without taking risks that exploited Soviet vulnerabilities. The United States needs to be more risk-acceptant in conducting offensive information and other operations against China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other countries as part of irregular warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlining Acquisition and Contracting:&lt;/strong&gt; Another challenge to working with the commercial sector is the acquisition process, which can be too slow, inflexible, and risk-averse. As one U.S. Department of Defense study bluntly warned, “Major defense programs continue to take ten years or more to deliver less capability than planned, often at two to three times the planned cost.” A 2024 Government Accountability Office study that reviewed 108 defense acquisition programs concluded that the Department of Defense “remains alarmingly slow in delivering new and innovative weapon system capabilities, even as national security threats continue to evolve.” While this prolonged schedule might be fine in peacetime, it is not sufficient for a wartime environment. Companies looking to deal with the Department of Defense too often must comply with the dizzying Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, which includes rules regarding government procurement. They must also deal with the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), which includes rules and regulations established by the Department of Defense to ensure that contractors and subcontractors follow specific cybersecurity best practices to protect sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no wonder that numerous companies in the commercial sector, including venture capital and private equity firms, have shied away from the defense sector. Many want to work with the Department of Defense or the U.S. intelligence community but have little interest in trekking through a byzantine contracting and acquisition system and are deterred by the heavy regulatory burden and limited financial upside. These companies often support the government’s mission and are patriotic, but they have little patience for a contracting and acquisition process that takes too long, is far too uncertain, and remains maddeningly opaque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many are also concerned about the “Valley of Death,” a phenomenon faced by start-ups trying to do business with the Department of Defense. The Valley of Death refers to the precarious journey in which a company transitions from a prototype or commercially available product to a Department of Defense contract. Many start-ups trying to do business with the Pentagon never make it from prototype to contract because of the mismatch in timelines between raising capital and securing a contract. Start-ups typically raise venture funding on timelines of one to two years, while the Defense Department often operates on an acquisition cycle of three to five years. A few, such as Palantir and Anduril, have succeeded, but many fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial companies are also concerned that the Department of Defense will attempt to seize their intellectual property. Trae Stephens, one of Anduril’s founders, once quipped that far too often, the department asks companies to “turn over your source code.” He continued, “It’s crazy. We’re literally doing to our companies in America what we’re criticizing the Chinese for doing to their companies and to our companies when we enter that market.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of such a convoluted contracting and acquisition process is that companies with broad commercial interests and expertise have not—yet—received significant Department of Defense funding, despite the explosion of venture capital and private equity investment. Companies with little or no commercial business accounted for 61 percent of the Department of Defense’s major programs by value in 2024—a major increase from 6 percent at the end of the Cold War. If one includes companies whose only commercial business was in aerospace, such as Boeing or Textron, the percentage jumped to 86 percent. That means that only 14 percent of the Department of Defense’s major programs went to commercial companies that served defense and other markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A defense industry operating in a wartime environment requires contracting and acquisitions processes that are faster, more flexible, and less risk-averse. The Department of Defense needs to cut the timelines for rewarding contracts using such options as Other Transaction Authorities, Rapid Acquisition Authority, and the Defense Production Act. Innovation generally occurs because of a synergy between the government and the commercial sector, making it important to find ways for imaginative commercial sector firms to more easily sell to the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improving Collaboration with Allies and Partners:&lt;/strong&gt; Throughout the history of the U.S. defense industrial base, allies and partners have played an important role in developing and buying military capabilities. As the 2024 U.S. Defense Innovation Board concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Since World War II, the United States’ network of allies and partners has stood as the cornerstone of our global strength and the envy of our adversaries. . . . Yet, the Department of Defense (DoD) is failing to fully integrate allies and partners into a networked defense industrial base, and to modernize the concepts, systems, and processes that enable these relationships to flourish.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation with allies and partners is particularly important for irregular warfare because of advances in defense-related hardware and software, such as AI, machine learning, quantum computing, autonomous systems, large language models, biotechnology, directed energy, electronic warfare, and other systems. U.S. allies in Europe and Asia have significant capabilities. Allies and partners also possess raw materials that are critical for the defense sector, such as South Africa’s chromium, rhodium, and platinum, and Australia’s lithium and zirconium. The reality is that modern weapons systems are products of a globalized market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States needs to facilitate technology sharing and defense exports to allies and partners through foreign military sales, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and other processes and procedures. For foreign military sales, the Department of Defense should develop a more efficient review process for releasing technology, provide allies and partner nations with relevant priority capabilities, accelerate acquisition and contracting support, and ensure broad U.S. government support to improve the sales process. For technology cooperation, the United States should encourage more co-development, co-production, co-sustainment, and other arrangements with allies and partners. There have been several recent examples of co-production with allies and partners, such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) with Poland, the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) and the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) with Australia, the Naval Strike Missile with Norway, and the SM-6 components and Tomahawks with Japan and Australia. But these examples are the exception rather than the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China, Russia, Iran, and other U.S. adversaries are developing capabilities that pose a growing threat to U.S. military forces and intelligence units below the threshold of conventional war. Indeed, irregular warfare will likely become an increasingly significant aspect of great power competition. Eric Schmidt, chair of the Special Competitive Studies Project and former CEO and chair of Google, warned that the United States is not adequately prepared for this future environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. government will have to overcome its stultified bureaucratic impulses, create favorable conditions for innovation, and invest in the tools and talent needed to kick-start the virtuous cycle of technological advancement. It needs to commit itself to promoting innovation in the service of the country and in the service of democracy. At stake is nothing less than the future of free societies, open markets, democratic government, and the broader world order.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, there are opportunities. The commercial sector has substantial capabilities that can help the U.S. military and intelligence community more effectively conduct irregular warfare. Innovative companies give the United States and its partners a significant advantage over China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other countries in such areas as battlefield awareness, unmanned systems, influence operations, placement and access, precision effects, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As President Franklin D. Roosevelt explained in his fireside chat to the United States on December 29, 1940, a year before Pearl Harbor, the “American industrial genius, unmatched throughout all the world in the solution of production problems, has been called upon to bring its resources and its talents into action.” It is much the same today. The commercial sector is an important part of America’s “arsenal of democracy.” It needs to play that role again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electrification of the battlefield to the point where every soldier carries electronic equipment has greatly improved the ability to coordinate land formations and situational awareness, and therefore the tempo and lethality of land forces. This has also created a pervasive presence within and dependency on the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). A force’s competence in manoeuvring in the EMS and its ability to disrupt or deny enemy manoeuvre in the EMS are therefore determining factors in its competitiveness. This means that electronic warfare (EW) has shifted from being a niche force multiplier to become an all-arms concern. This paper outlines what has changed in EW operations and assesses how this should impact force design within NATO militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW performs three critical functions for the force:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic surveillance&lt;/strong&gt; allows the force to detect and track adversaries, understand friendly vulnerabilities, and collect and analyse adversary waveforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic attack&lt;/strong&gt; can jam enemy communications and navigation, inflict permanent damage on enemy electronics, or provide a vector for the delivery of cyber payloads to corrupt adversary networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic defence&lt;/strong&gt; disrupts enemy kill chains and interferes with enemy munitions to protect the force from precision strike. Capabilities for all three functions are now needed, covering all echelons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the manner in which EW effects are fielded is changing in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;digitisation&lt;/strong&gt; of the battlefield reduces the requirement for bespoke EW systems, as EW software-defined radios (EWSDRs) can be programmed to perform a wide range of EW tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;miniaturisation&lt;/strong&gt; of EW systems (and of the batteries supporting them) allows these capabilities to be fielded much more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Algorithmic warfare&lt;/strong&gt; allows for the mass generation of bespoke EW payloads, reducing the power required for a given effect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with these changes is not an abstract question related to a notional future battlefield, but instead applies to the capabilities that are necessary to remain survivable today: in Ukraine, for example, EW has become a company-level asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;preparing-the-british-army&quot;&gt;Preparing the British Army&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the British Army is to prepare effectively for the evolving threat landscape that these EW changes will bring, several measures are necessary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Education on the EMS should be delivered to all arms. The key is not to make every soldier an EW operator, but rather to make all arms spectrum-aware, and to ensure that tactical commanders understand electromagnetic principles well enough to have conversations about planning and deconfliction with EW specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Training must allow for EW capabilities to be used routinely, so that soldiers become familiar with the procedures for identifying that they are under electronic attack and for resolving the ensuing frictions. Troops also need to be surveyed in the EMS by friendly EW teams so that they can learn how their electronic signatures appear to the adversary. In order to apply effects without revealing capabilities to the adversary, it may be necessary for some elements of EW to be applied in synthetic environments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A programme should be established for procuring EW equipment to make the capability available at echelon. At its most basic, this means providing EWSDRs and associated receive/transmit antennas at a rough density of one per platoon. This would be overly costly if attempted for the whole force, but should be rolled out brigade by brigade over time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Investing in the EW capability also requires a means of visualising the EMS within mission planning software so that battlespace management of EW effects can be brought down to the brigade and battalion level. There is an architecture and software requirement here, but also training of commanders in how to properly employ and command EW troops will be necessary. Furthermore, there is a need to examine the scaling of EW specialist signallers within existing formations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Land forces must understand EW in the context of the joint force, and plan and train to: receive effects from space, air and maritime forces; help deliver effects for cyber forces; contribute effects in support of air and maritime forces; and suppress enemy space-based capabilities. This joint awareness requires closer collaboration between the Air, Land and Maritime Warfare Centres to ensure the development of joint tactics and the representation of other domains in domain-specific exercises. Failure to implement these measures will see the force cede its competitiveness to adversaries that are investing heavily in EW as an effective counter to legacy NATO advantages of coordination and precision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Excalibur precision artillery rounds were first deployed in Ukraine, they hit their intended target 70% of the time, with misreported coordinates by those calling for fire largely responsible for the 30% that missed. By August 2023, at the height of Ukraine’s offensive aimed at liberating its occupied territories, just 6% of Excalibur rounds landed on target. The cause of this precipitous decline in effectiveness was Russian electronic warfare (EW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW has been a key tool in warfare for more than a century. However, for most of this period the primary task of EW units within land forces has been the detection and interception of enemy communications. Although contemporary Russian forces have placed an emphasis on jamming as an enabler of manoeuvre, this activity has historically been confined to the denial of fixed bands of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) for short periods, over a defined area. Generally, EW operators have been specialist force multipliers, with functions obscure to the majority of the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the vast majority of military systems, down to those carried by the individual soldier, are electronically powered, while most modern force multipliers depend on the EMS. As forces become more integrated, they also become more vulnerable to electromagnetic interference, whether from the enemy or from friends. Mastery of EW determines a force’s efficiency and its cohesion at every echelon. While exquisite EW effects remain sensitive and specialist capabilities, EW is nevertheless the business of the whole force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper discusses how EW has evolved, its impact on modern land operations, and how it should be integrated into combined arms operations in the land domain by NATO forces. The paper is based on observations of the effects of EW between 2021 and 2024 in Ukraine, in Israel and on exercises in the US and elsewhere, as well as on interviews with engineers in communications companies and government laboratories, and with operators across several states, including the UK, the US, Ukraine, Israel, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact capabilities of specific EW systems remain highly sensitive, but the principles of what is possible are not. Moreover, as EW has become an intrinsic part of all combined arms operations, rather than a discrete force multiplier, it has become vital that its principles are more widely understood, so that it can be integrated into operations by non-specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;structure-and-focus&quot;&gt;Structure and Focus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper is divided into three parts. As the paper is written for a non-EW-specialist military audience, Chapter I considers the principles of EW and how they relate to contemporary military operations. Chapter II examines what has changed about EW, and what is likely to become possible in the medium term, while Chapter III discusses how the force can best integrate these emerging capabilities into its structure – and the challenges this will create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus in this paper is the employment of EW by land forces. NATO air forces and navies are extensive users of EW, and their systems are already far in advance of what is generally fielded by land forces. However, these capabilities are hard to replicate for land forces, as aircraft and ships have access to power levels and angles of alignment, and can carry antennas. EW must be utilised differently in the land domain, and this paper is solely concerned with that domain. The impact of modern EW in the air and at sea, as well as in space, is a worthy subject of study, but is better dealt with separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a separate question about how naval and air EW can support land operations, and how land EW can support operations across the other warfighting domains. The authors address this in a range of other studies relating to joint approaches to operational problems, but it is worth emphasising that, to be able to implement the approaches discussed in these studies, each domain must have its own robust EW capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-principles-of-ew&quot;&gt;I. The Principles of EW&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before discussing how EW is evolving and its impact on modern military operations, it is necessary to briefly describe the core principles of how EW works. This chapter discusses the electromagnetic environment (EME), which constitutes the EW battlespace, how effects move through this environment, the military functions of EW, and the principles of their coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-electromagnetic-environment&quot;&gt;The Electromagnetic Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EME comprises the distribution of electromagnetic energy that is transmitted across the full spectrum of frequencies, within a geographic area. For the purposes of this paper, the discussion is primarily concerned with radio frequencies and not the bands of the spectrum containing infrared, visible and ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma-rays. There is always a level of background electromagnetic activity and radiation, and this varies in intensity and saturation from place to place. Natural electromagnetic energy includes the Earth’s magnetic field and the build-up of electrical charge in the atmosphere that becomes observable in lightning. Solar flares cause significant electromagnetic energy that affects the portion of the Earth facing the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to natural electromagnetic energy, other emissions and fields are created by conducted energy resulting from human activity. For much of the 20th century, and across most of the world, such human-created emissions were limited. Moreover, most of these emissions were regular – radio stations, for instance, emitted at a specified frequency from known locations at a consistent level of power. In any given area, therefore, an electromagnetic survey would indicate which parts of the spectrum were occupied, and these surveys would remain reasonably accurate over a sustained period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several technologies have disrupted this state of affairs. First, the proliferation of satellite-based communication and navigation, alongside cellular communication, means that there is almost nowhere on Earth that remains unaffected by human-caused electromagnetic emissions. For example, the premise of global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) – satellite constellations that transmit signals to receivers in order to provide positioning, navigation and timing services – is that the constellation is sufficiently dense to enable a receiver on any part of the Earth’s surface to have line-of-sight to three to four satellites, thus allowing the position of the receiver to be triangulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the emergence of digital (rather than analogue) hardware means that systems can be tuned to multiple, precise frequencies, allowing many more systems to broadcast and communicate at any given time within the same area. To use a musical analogy, the piano – which is an analogue device – has 88 keys, allowing for 12 notes to be played across seven octaves (with four additional notes). These notes comprise, in total, 52 tones and 36 semitones. However, a digital synthesiser can dynamically retune an electric piano to play a piece of music with quarter tones or octo-tones, such that – within the same number of octaves – it is possible to have hundreds of notes. Moreover, whereas adjusting the tuning of a normal piano would need to be done manually, key by key, digitisation allows software to rapidly retune devices in real time. Similarly, within a given band of the EMS – analogous to an octave – a digital system can distinguish between a far greater number of frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the miniaturisation of computing owing to the microelectronic revolution means that there are now far more devices that emit and receive electromagnetic frequencies, and which are portable. The result is that the EME is becoming far denser all over the world, with more frequencies being used at any given time. Moreover, increased portability enables more devices to move in and out of a given geography, so that the EME is becoming less constant, and, because digital systems can be adjusted rapidly, there is less consistency as to what is emitting on a given frequency. Digitisation also allows specialist equipment such as military frequency-hopping radios to be drastically more complex in the patterns of emissions that it can generate. As a result, not only is the EME becoming denser, but finding the military signal of interest is also becoming increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To effectively operate in the EME, therefore, it is necessary to understand which frequencies are being used, which are not, and what any given frequency is being used for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;frequency-alignment-and-power&quot;&gt;Frequency, Alignment and Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of EW revolve around the frequency, alignment and power of emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using light – the visible spectrum – as an analogy, frequency is comparable to shades of colour. Each colour, such as red, yellow and blue, has a range of shades, from lighter to darker. Similarly, each frequency band in the EMS encompasses a range of individual frequencies, from higher to lower. Emissions occur on a given frequency and can be distinguished from one another. However, it can be difficult to distinguish frequencies that are extremely close to one another, and even harder to distinguish different emitters on the same frequency. For example, while it might be difficult to track one orange dot amid 49 red dots, it is even more complicated to distinguish a red dot in the middle of a field of 49 other red dots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alignment characterises the direction in which an emission is travelling. To continue the analogy with light, if a laser pointer is shone onto the surface of the eye from the side, it is likely to be merely annoying. If it is shone directly into the pupil, however, it may be painful and prevent the person from seeing much else. If the laser pointer is shone onto the back of the person’s head, they will not see it at all. Alignment, therefore, can enable communications devices that operate on the same frequency to distinguish between different messages, because a receiver pointing in one direction will not track an emission on the same frequency coming from outside of its field of regard. Conversely, careful alignment of emitters can also prevent some receivers from detecting the emission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of an electromagnetic emission determines both how far it travels before dissipating, and how a signal interacts with other emissions of the same frequency. To continue the above analogy, imagine two widely separated lights of the same colour being turned on in front of your eyes: one is a low-wattage bulb, and the other is a high-energy LED. Now picture them being brought closer together: the likelihood is that as the difference in spacing (alignment) between these two light sources diminishes, at some point the low-wattage bulb will become essentially invisible, while the more powerful light will remain visible (although there may be some reduction in the clarity with which it can be seen). Similarly, a more powerful emitter may render a weaker emission on the same bearing and frequency invisible (although the weaker emitter may reduce the clarity of the stronger emitter’s signal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important consideration as regards power is that electromagnetic emissions constitute the transfer of electrical energy – the power of emissions can reach a level that saturates the capacity of a receiver. This phenomenon makes it possible to use an emission on a different frequency to prevent other frequencies being detected, or even to cause permanent damage to the receiver. A good analogy would be to consider what happens if you are exposed to extremely loud noise: it will prevent you from hearing any other noises, and it may be painful or even damage the eardrum. Similarly, high-power output on a given frequency can saturate or even damage a receiver, while lower-power emissions could still be pushing out energy, even if they are not readily perceived. A regular challenge in EW is to detect those faint signals of interest amid much louder signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW therefore involves the detecting and mapping of the frequency, alignment and power of emissions, and emitting in such a way as to interfere with enemy systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;surveillance-attack-and-defence&quot;&gt;Surveillance, Attack and Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The functions of EW can be divided into three broad categories: surveillance, attack, and defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveillance involves surveying the EMS to detect emissions and thus inform friendly forces about who is communicating, where they are, and, in some cases, what is being said. Electronic surveillance can range from simple identification and direction finding to the mapping of enemy tactics, techniques and procedures, thus providing the ability to anticipate enemy actions by building up catalogues of indicators and warnings. Another, more sensitive, function of electronic surveillance is to gather the waveforms of specific enemy emissions in order to assess how target systems might be affected at a technical level. Finally, surveillance is used in signals intelligence collection, which comprises the detection, identification, geolocation, decryption and demodulation, recording and dissemination of signals of interest to relevant parties either in real time or slow time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic attack (EA) is the creation of emissions to attack enemy systems. The most basic EA function is jamming, which is achieved by saturating the receiver of a target system by emitting on a particular frequency band, thereby preventing intended messages from reaching the recipient. High-power EA can physically damage target systems by overloading a receiver with electrical energy (note too that distance has a significant impact on the effectiveness of jamming). Jamming of this kind can also be directed at systems like radar to effectively degrade what they can see. The effect of much EA is to reduce the distance at which a radar can read returns, rather than preventing the radar from doing so entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EA can also be undertaken to provoke enemy systems in ways that will facilitate their electronic surveillance by one’s own forces. For example, some communications systems will have reversionary modes, or will mask as another system but unmask if denied the use of the system they are pretending to be. EA can therefore be used to trigger behaviours in the target system that would not have been observable if there was no interference. Understanding the tactics, techniques and procedures of a target in response to jamming also strengthens the ability to identify, discriminate and track targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar but distinct from jamming is spoofing, whereby an emission is targeted at a receiver such that the recipient believes they are receiving a signal from a friendly system, when they are in fact receiving a corrupted signal from an unfriendly system. An example of this is GNSS spoofing. Because GNSSs are very low-power systems, it is possible to direct a higher-power message on the same frequency within an area, making it impossible for the receiver to distinguish between the unfriendly spoofer and one of the real satellite’s emissions. The spoofer can then send a bogus location and timestamp, so that the receiver triangulates its position using false bearings and is therefore spoofed into believing the satellite is in one location when in fact it is in another. Navigational interference of this nature can cause ships or aircraft to lose their way – or even crash – if they are wholly reliant on GNSSs for navigation, and can cause guided munitions to miss their targets. For this reason, ships, aircraft and precision-guided munitions often use additional navigation capabilities (such as inertial navigation systems) to reduce the severity of any ill-effects stemming from interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More sophisticated forms of EA include protocol-based EA and EA-delivered cyber attack. Protocol-based EA directs emissions at a target that cause it to respond in a manner that is either inappropriate or damaging to the target. Again, a musical analogy can illustrate the difference between jamming or simple spoofing and protocol-based EA. If a pianist close to you plays the chord of C major at high volume while another pianist, further away, plays C minor, you are unlikely to hear the latter chord; this effect is akin to jamming. Now imagine that the more distant pianist is playing a sonata, and that someone suddenly bangs on the keys of the piano that is closer to you, producing a discordant noise. Most people would flinch at such a disturbing noise and automatically turn towards the source of the encroaching sound: the combination of surprise and discomfort at the discordant notes, disrupting the sonata, is a predictable response. A protocol-based EA endeavours to produce similarly predictable results in the technical workings of a system by directing particular waveforms at it. In the most severe cases, a protocol-based EA may cause a system to react in a way that is physically harmful. It can also allow a receiver to be jammed while using a much lower power level, just as the playing of the discordant note may cause the listener to lose their concentration and awareness of the progression of the sonata, even though the latter is still audible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EA-delivered cyber attack is different from protocol-based EA in that it is not concerned with how the system reacts to the signal, but is instead the transmission of a message, the contents of which constitute a cyber payload. An attacker spoofing a GNSS, for example, substitutes the GNSS signal with a different message. In contrast, an EA-delivered cyber attack might, for example, replace the triangulation equation with an adjusted one, so that the system would henceforth always “correct” the actual GNSS signal by a specified distance and direction, even after it was no longer being engaged by the EA system; this effect would last until the software was patched or refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to sequence protocol-based EA and a cyber attack. For example, imagine an enemy camera that is receiving instructions from and streaming video to an enemy command post. It is possible to use protocol-based EA to convince the camera that the signal being emitted to it is on its control frequency, but to then transmit a cyber payload that causes the camera to broadcast an inserted video clip on a loop, or to send back the same five seconds of recorded video again and again, so that the command post sees no change in the observed environment, masking what is really happening in front of the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is worth briefly discussing EA that is specifically intended to do physical harm to a target. For example, directed-energy weapons like high-power microwaves are designed to saturate receivers and electronics with electrical energy such that they burn out. These weapons have significant potential to target and damage unhardened targets, such as many classes of drone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of electronic defence are no different from those of EA, but are conversely directed to the protection of friendly forces. Electronic surveillance, for example, becomes electronic defence when it is used to monitor friendly forces’ emissions and then to provide warnings about what those emissions are revealing to the enemy. Likewise, jamming enemy radar is a form of EA, but may be used to protect a friendly aircraft if the radar is trying to guide a ground-to-air missile, at which point it becomes electronic defence. Another form of electronic defence is to spoof or otherwise disrupt a munition or targeting system such that a strike misses friendly forces. The capabilities required for electronic defence are therefore the same as those needed for attack and surveillance, but the placement of the systems on the battlefield may differ, because they need alignment with different targets. The importance of electronic defence has been significantly amplified by the pervasive threat from UAVs, which depend significantly on the EMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manoeuvre-in-the-ems&quot;&gt;Manoeuvre in the EMS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW is often prone to collateral damage and fratricide. As civilian systems have populated more of the spectrum, the availability of frequencies for military use that will not interfere with civilian systems has become very constrained. Ruining a popular radio station’s signal may not be particularly consequential, but interrupting emergency services communications has legal and humanitarian implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, urbanisation has created complex environments with uneven line of sight, such that systems without dense and fixed infrastructure often have very uneven coverage, complicating the support of communications for military forces. Another issue is that friendly forces use and depend on access to the EMS for their own communications, and since jammers will often be closer to friendly receivers than their targets, it is easy to accidentally collapse friendly networks. Navigational interference may provide electronic defence for a friendly headquarters, but it may also prevent communication by desynchronising the precision-timing function of cryptographic systems, effectively constituting a protocol-based EA on the headquarters. (This is because frequency-hopping requires precise timing between the radios in a network, so that all radios remain tuned to the correct frequency.) Navigational interference could also interfere with the calibration of guns, causing friendly artillery to be spoofed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful employment of EW requires careful battlespace management. Historically, this has been relatively simple, because there have been small numbers of EW troops, whose effects have often been tightly bounded. As the EMS becomes increasingly crowded, however, even just preventing friendly communications from interfering with one another is made increasingly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further challenge to discrimination in the EMS is shadowing and exploitation of civilian networks. Militaries are increasingly employing civilian cellular communications as reversionary communications bearers. Conversely, non-state groups in Syria, for example, use civilian navigation systems to coordinate strikes on the basis that they assume Western forces derive too much benefit from the civilian network to countenance denying access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to manoeuvre in the EMS not only requires solid data and an up-to-date electromagnetic survey, but also demands that manoeuvre warfare officers sufficiently understand the principles of EW and EA outlined above. Only then can they determine when they will be dependent on different parts of the spectrum and make trade-off decisions between their command-and-control (C2) requirements, electronic defence requirements, and deconfliction obligations over different geographies and at different times during an operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-emerging-ew-capabilities&quot;&gt;II. Emerging EW Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than cyber payloads and protocol-based EA, all the principles described in chapter I were essentially in place at the end of the Cold War. Nevertheless, there have been significant developments in EW over the past decade that have transformed both how it can be used by land forces and what is needed to remain competitive in modern combat. This chapter outlines these developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;integrated-sensing&quot;&gt;Integrated Sensing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fielding of software-defined radios (SDRs) throughout the battlefield offers the possibility to transform both electronic reconnaissance and the data gathering necessary for EA. SDRs are not just communications devices – they are miniaturised computers that can dynamically program emissions for a wide range of purposes, from communications to EW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, EW baselines have comprised groups of specialist EW operators working across three locations to be able to triangulate their detections, while deploying dedicated EW equipment. EW baselines have also provided the opportunity for signals intelligence collection, although this has required each team to record frequencies and then share these recordings with their supporting intelligence and analytical structure. The limitations of this system are obvious: EW operators are a valuable and scarce resource, limiting the number of baselines that can be fielded. The Armed Forces of Ukraine, for example, spent most of 2022 and early 2023 having to field baselines of two EW positions, giving less precise locations of detected emissions, because they had insufficient personnel and equipment to maintain the optimal three per sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, SDRs, attached to appropriate antennas, can enable a wide range of military vehicles to be turned into baseline positions, integrating a large number of sensors. Whereas an analogue device is necessarily tuned to one frequency, to the exclusion of others, a software-defined communications system can receive on multiple frequencies, and, while translating one to sound or data for the user, can simultaneously log the detection, bearing and strength of the others and – if part of a networked system – transmit these detections in very small data packages. In this way, every unit potentially contributes to the EW baseline. Not every unit will be drawn on in practice; often, units will not be in a suitable position to fulfil this role. However, when units are occupying appropriate ground, the opportunity exists. The possibilities of using a widely distributed network of sensors are expanding even further as SDRs become ubiquitous on uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) that overfly the frontline, allowing EW collection to be extended into the enemy battlespace in order to catch relatively low-power transmissions and to reduce constraints on what can be detected because of the alignment of emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity to disperse and expand the number of collection nodes means that they will often be closer to the point of emission, meaning that lower-power emissions will be practically detectable and improving the survivability of the EW teams. Erwin Rommel, for example, used an EW baseline to great effect in North Africa against the British. But he only had one such system, which was located and destroyed; he was unable to regenerate the capability until he was deployed to Normandy. By separating collection from analysis – with the latter function requiring specialists – it becomes possible to better preserve EW operators and maintain capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important advantage of dispersed yet integrated sensing is that it allows for a sustained presence across the front. The old task of recording specific waveforms to refine attacks or optimise tracking of key systems was often frustrated by the fact that a system might illuminate too far from an EW team to be recorded, and then displace before the EW team could reach the relevant location. If sensors are distributed, however, it is possible to program equipment to flag when a waveform of interest is detected, and to record it and prioritise its transmission rearwards. A centralised EW team can monitor these waveforms of interest across a wide area. Waveforms can also be studied from different sensors as they move around the battlefield, so that long-duration recordings of emitting systems can be built up to see not only how the system behaves over time but also how it reacts to effects that might cause interference, from either EA or fratricide with other systems in the opposing force. In any case, as frequency-hopping and other methods are used to improve the robustness of communications, building up recordings of the hop pattern allows for a more refined picture of which radio is communicating, or to predict where the pattern might be under varying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distributed EW capability allows for regular updates to the electromagnetic survey of the background environment. Collecting localised signals from many points increases the speed at which a picture of emissions patterns across the battlespace can be accumulated and disseminated. Furthermore, the accumulation of more data, with greater fidelity, is both exploitable by AI and allows analytical tools such as AI to have a better foundation with which to assess the environment. The ability to accumulate and assess regular EME surveys allows electronic surveillance to provide regular updates for planning in order to apply fires, plan routes for and launch UAS, or prepare a communications plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will remain necessary to field dedicated EW platforms, as some specific enemy systems may use low-probability-of-detection or -interception techniques that can only be captured by specialist equipment, or the distances involved may demand dedicated antenna arrays to pick up signals. It is also necessary to be able to draw on and contribute to joint EW capabilities and national technical means. But by narrowing the range of routine tasks that dedicated EW teams are assigned, the integration of sensors should allow for these assets to be used in a more targeted way, improving coverage and thereby reducing the periods when monitoring is not available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;adaptive-payloads&quot;&gt;Adaptive Payloads&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software-defined systems allow for the acceleration of bespoke attack payloads being used in EW as the standard form of attack. The ability to record waveforms allows them to be examined by software and, as long as the desired effect can be designed, for the most precise and effective countermeasure to be programmed. In some cases, this may be possible at the edge. A group of four SDRs, for example, may have one set to attack and three set to receive, and will thereby both monitor the bearing of the target – enabling proper alignment of the attacking antenna – and track the evolution of the emission pattern of the target system over time (and as it responds to stimuli from the attacking system). This creates a feedback loop that enables the attacking system to outperform the target system, sustaining the jamming even as the defensive system endeavours to evade the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of attack systems is somewhat different from that for surveillance systems, because conducting a successful attack requires not only an appropriate antenna, but also an appropriate source of power. This may be less of an issue when the power source is vehicle-mounted, but dismounted units will need power sources, whether they are battery packs or a generator. EA also necessarily requires emission, making the emitting unit itself a target for enemy electronic surveillance and subsequently for fires. Distributing a greater number of points of attack allows signals to be generated closer to the target, potentially increasing effectiveness, while limiting the risk of the overall EA system. The point of attack can also be switched between positions, or the attacking antenna could be geographically separated from the SDR, operator and power source. This latter case would facilitate a counter-battery engagement at the loss of only a single antenna, in an ideal case. The more points an attack can originate from, the greater the number of tactical options there are for how it is managed. Opportunities in this space become even greater if the offset antenna is mounted on an uncrewed system and is thus mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since protocol-based EA requires an understanding of how a waveform is received and what subsequently happens to the hardware within a system, the distributed reconnaissance capability does not allow for dynamic generation of these payloads. However, the use of algorithms to rapidly exploit captured equipment and thereby generate payloads closer to the front – and faster – does offer the prospect of a highly responsive EW capability development cycle. A distribution of attacking EW nodes also makes it possible for a sensitive payload to be held back before being pushed forward to a specific system once a target is identified by reconnaissance. Once delivered by that EW node, the payload could then be wiped from the device without the user needing to know that they were holding a sensitive payload. This approach makes it possible to remotely generate effects while also reducing the information security issues associated with pushing EW platforms and operators forward into tactical formations. By using protocol-based EA, it is also possible to reduce the power demands for a given effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to deploy adaptive payloads against enemy communications is accompanied by the ability to provide agile electronic defence at echelon. For example, an enemy UAS may use a command link to receive instructions, and may offload live video to a base station. It may also rely on a GNSS for navigation. It can therefore be envisaged that distributed electronic surveillance may identify the pattern of traffic between the UAS and its base station, and that a counter-UAS system may identify the navigational pathway used by the UAS. At this point, it may be possible for the unit over which the enemy system is flying to jam the control frequencies used by the UAS, for an adjacent unit – noting the low power levels associated with a GNSS – to jam the navigational frequencies associated with the platform, and for a dedicated EW system with greater range (or a friendly unit in closer proximity) to jam the receiver of the video link in a synchronised manner. This would probably only be possible for a short period, but may provide the unit under observation with the time necessary to get a counter-UAS interceptor into position, or at the very least take appropriate measures to conceal critical systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth dwelling on the fact that while the distributed and dynamic payload-delivery capability described above offers advantages over past approaches to EA, the distribution of electronic defences across the force at all echelons is also essential for survivability, given the modern threat environment. Now that platoons can organically generate precise lethal effects out to 20 km, the ability to disrupt enemy kill chains is an essential capability for enabling manoeuvre without an unacceptable rate of attrition of personnel and materiel. As attacking systems use the same software-driven processes to rapidly update their navigational technique and communications protocols, the transition to a software-driven and dynamic EA architecture is not just a path towards advantage, but is vital for keeping pace with a rapidly evolving threat. Understanding that this process will be implemented by tactical echelons for their own preservation, even if it is not prepared before a conflict, shapes the command decision to erect such an architecture. The question is not whether such an approach should be attempted – for it is essential – but how well it is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dynamic-command-and-control&quot;&gt;Dynamic Command and Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surveillance, attack and defence capability described above creates a chaotic and complex electromagnetic battlespace. If a communication system is dynamically hopping frequencies in response to targeted EA by an adversary, and these hops are being tracked by the adversary’s electronic surveillance so as to inform the EA that is following the hops, then there is no way for either side to know beforehand which parts of the spectrum will be covered by the engagement. This is because software that is reacting dynamically to EA is not displaced by the attack to a pre-agreed contingency frequency but instead generates frequencies of opportunity depending on which parts of the spectrum are available and which parts are denied. The risk is that as multiple systems engage in this process of attack and evasion, the spectrum becomes extremely congested such that it is either effectively unusable over a given area, or else is unreliable and therefore denies commanders the ability to plan effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that under these conditions commanders on both sides may choose to turn off their EA capabilities, and in the absence of interference, this may lead to stable frequencies becoming occupied by both sides’ communications. This is often the case in Ukraine, where both sides have a strong desire to deny one another the use of UAVs but there is also a demand from commanders to have access to UAV feeds. The result is that both sides tend to lower jamming for particular periods and to sit very close to one another in the frequencies they use to operate UAVs, thereby preventing the other side from jamming them without also causing problems for their own ISR feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If both communications and EW are being executed by the same SDRs, there are opportunities for the behaviour of the systems to be deconflicted technically. First, if EA and communications protocols are updated through software injections, then it is theoretically possible for the effects to avoid overlap. The deployment of algorithms to the edge or near-edge on individual platforms could increase the speed of real-time deconfliction in response to battlefield inputs while further reducing the cognitive burden on EW operators. Power level, alignment and range are also important. If EA nodes can be directed on the correct bearing – triangulated by the surveillance baseline – this can reduce or avoid the effects on the receivers of friendly communications systems. It is also only necessary for EA and communications to be deconflicted within the range parameters of the given EA effector. This means that deconfliction within a friendly tactical network will probably be necessary, and also eminently achievable. Scaling this manner of deconfliction across the force would be drastically more difficult, but is unlikely to be required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between geography and emissions therefore becomes a critical consideration in how commanders draw their unit boundaries, with the potential requirement to draw a unit’s physical boundary of responsibility and area of interest separately from drawing its electronic boundary. This would thereby allow – for instance – seams in friendly electronic defences to be used to route UAS through areas with less electronic interference, thereby avoiding having to turn off electronic protection to push forward surveillance assets. This would also conveniently address the need to warn friendly units of impending overflight in order to avoid fratricide, by confining overflight to established routes that had been identified during the allocation of battlespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that modern technology alters some of the requirements for when units communicate. For example, the usual view is that once a unit is in contact, it should communicate freely, as its position is known to the enemy, and it needs the ability to coordinate its movement and fires. The need to coordinate movement laterally within the echelon in contact persists. However, with overhead observation, it becomes possible for higher echelons to observe the progress of the fighting and thereby organically generate fire support with very little communication with the echelon in contact. There is certainly no need for forward controllers to talk guns onto target. The result is that while a force may avoid jamming tactical communications frequencies in contact, it may continue to try to deny enemy artillery through GNSS jamming, and use EA to try to break inter-echelon communication, accepting that this may conflict with its own ability to call for fires in support of the manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, EW is largely managed at the divisional level in US doctrine and in British practice. The UK in particular has a history of fielding small EW teams that operate more independently, but the allocation and exploitation of product from these teams is often managed at a national level, making them a strategic asset. What is described above, as regards C2, would not be feasible within this structure. Put simply, a small EW cell at division would be saturated by the complexity and speed at which EW effects would need to be sequenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with endeavouring to conduct EW battle management at a lower echelon has generally been the scarcity of operators and assets. However, while the scale of coordination is increasing, the provision of more intuitive decision support tools and the ability to display the EMS in a manner that can be visualised should reduce the training burden for some aspects of EW C2 and allow it to be carried out in a more distributed manner. The best current example of this kind of technology exists in air forces, where the need for pilots to conduct mission planning at speed has created a range of ways to display EW laydowns in relation to geography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is not so much making the EME comprehensible to non-specialists as it is integrating this picture as a layer into other C2 tools used to plan and execute traditional manoeuvre. This represents a software integration challenge, but is achievable. The use of algorithmic tools can also help to show the interdependencies of activity, so that a change to one variable in a planning tool automatically adjusts the electromagnetic scheme of manoeuvre. Nascent tools like this are already in use by the US military, such as the Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool, which should become more effective as it becomes cross-referenced with other C2 applications through the US Army’s C2-Next programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multi-domain-effects&quot;&gt;Multi-Domain Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to briefly discuss how the changes outlined above relate to the multi-domain fight, since the EME is a plane of manoeuvre which intersects all domains. Although this paper focuses on land operations, these are unavoidably effected by EW from other domains and vice versa, as the EME is a shared manoeuvre space for all domains. For example, ground force GNSS-denial routinely affects civilian and military aircraft operating in the vicinity, while a GNSS is itself a communications link emitting from space to the terrestrial domains. This section is concerned less about how EW is used in other domains than it is with how EW from other domains will impact ground operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant domain for the future of EMS operations is space. We may presume that unless an area of space is mutually denied by space debris, both sides will, in any peer or near-peer conflict, have access to dense constellations of satellites able to detect electromagnetic emissions. This does not necessarily allow tactical echelons to obtain this data in time for their fight, and therefore does not replace the need for electronic surveillance in ground units. However, it does mean that there is a reduced requirement for tactical units to share their picture of the EME up-echelon, because, from division and above, it is probably possible to provide regular and rapid electromagnetic surveys taken from space. It also means that tactical echelons will be persistently exposed to space-based observation from higher echelons, meaning that targets which stand out as high value or have unique signatures are likely to be found and struck. This increases the value in distributing EW capabilities and confusing the picture by making it flatter and more homogenous, with emissions continuously varying and locally unpredictable. This ability to track identified targets into operational depth from space also significantly increases the value in obtaining high-quality recordings for emissions signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space also offers the opportunity for EA. While this activity can be conducted against a very wide geography, tasking satellites in this way will only be possible against high-priority targets, such that while it remains an option, it does not reduce the requirement for EA at echelon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Air&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air domain is the domain in which EW is probably most mature. EW has been critical to air forces ever since radar became the primary means for air defenders to track aircraft. The ability to locate and target defensive radar, to disrupt the accurate tracking of aircraft and to reduce the engagement ranges of surface-to-air missiles has been fundamental to an effective ability to penetrate and prosecute attacks into enemy airspace on a sustained basis and at scale. The successful use of each of these capabilities routinely leads to tactical or operational effects on land. Moreover, the ability of aircraft to carry electronic countermeasures (ECMs) to protect themselves from missiles – irrespective of the domain from which they were launched – is also central to any modern combat air capability. Air battlespace management – being dependent on radio frequency communications and radar – is also a key target for EW as a means of degrading the scale and synchronisation of enemy air activity. The emergence of precision strike, meanwhile, means that radar and electronic surveillance are core components of how aircraft engage in effective close air support. The development of stand-off munitions has not reduced the importance of EW, requiring the fielding of both penetration aides and decoys, and making navigation a contested capability critical to mission success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maturity of air EW capabilities means that land forces can be fast learners, as some of the same dynamics emerge in land warfare. There is also the opportunity, however, for land forces to better assist the air domain by conducting EA against both enemy air defences and enemy aircraft. The threat from the air also makes EA against air targets a highly useful capability in protecting land forces. However, aircraft can carry large and exquisite antennas, have access to abundant power, and can assume line of sight over very significant ranges out to 400 km, so many effects against air targets will need dedicated generators and antennas if land forces are to be effective. However, the software determining the emissions pattern may still be routed through the same EW SDRs. Land forces, unlike aerial EW, have the advantage of a persistent presence, whereas air effects are necessarily periodic, constrained by fuel and threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maritime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maritime EW remains a viable means of tracking enemy vessels, while radar and its defeat remains critical to tracking surface targets for the use of anti-ship cruise missiles. The primary means by which Russia tracks Ukrainian uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), for example, is through their electronic emissions, allowing the Black Sea Fleet to intercept most Ukrainian USVs using helicopter guided to the intercept point by EW capabilities. Ships also depend on EW as a means of disrupting one another’s missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spatial separation of land and maritime forces means that there is likely to be limited EW interaction between the two, other than in the context of coastal defence missile complexes, where land-based capabilities threaten shipping. However, whereas pervasive space-based observation poses a manageable risk for land forces that can distribute and flatten their emissions profile, space-based tracking of a surface action group through its emissions is harder to passively counter. As satellites become critical for the guidance of anti-ship ballistic missiles, navies will have to take a more aggressive approach to counter-space operations. Naval vessels have the antennas and power to conduct effective EW targeting space-based assets, and we may therefore presume that navies will routinely use EA against satellites. This is not a trivial task, as it requires highly calibrated alignment. Range also imposes constraints on what can be achieved given energy dissipation, making protocol-based effects critical. Nevertheless, navies will have to invest heavily in this area. This is likely to have an indirect effect on land forces by reducing the reliability and the availability of space-based communications and other capabilities when operating in a littoral environment. Given that navies are likely to possess this capability, land forces need to determine both how they can mitigate disruption to space-based assets, and where they may draw upon naval capabilities to protect themselves from enemy space-based observation, or even attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an intersection between EW and cyber activities. Cyber attacks are distinct in their operational tempo and logic compared with EA. Whereas EA is immediate, cyber attacks require a protracted period of reconnaissance, penetration, payload design, emplacement and trigger architecture to generate. They are also unpredictable insofar as patches of the target system can either invalidate a payload or alter how it will impact the system within which it is embedded. However, EA is a means to both infiltrate cyber payloads and trigger them. The critical intersection here, therefore, is in planning, designing and building a pathway to distribute payloads to EW elements. There is also the fact that as the battlefield becomes widely connected by software-defined systems, the attack surface increases, such that cyber defence becomes an integral and critical function, which, from a task management point of view, will necessarily interface with the signals organisations that run EW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-fielding-competitive-ew&quot;&gt;III. Fielding Competitive EW&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having surveyed the basic principles of EW and how their application is evolving, this chapter turns to how these capabilities are best distributed and fielded in a modern land force. Although it could be argued that any SDR may now be used to conduct EW (given enough power and the right antenna), that does not mean that every radio should be employed in this way. This chapter therefore seeks to address several practical questions: What is the appropriate density of systems? Where are there requirements to retain bespoke EW platforms? And, in a context where there are many more EW systems than expert EW operators, where should these personnel be distributed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;distributed-effectors-and-networked-operators-at-echelon&quot;&gt;Distributed Effectors and Networked Operators at Echelon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of distributed effectors has been described above. Making this a reality, however, requires a detailed answer to the question of how many EW systems can and should be fielded across a force at each echelon. If we begin with the logic that each independent element of the force requires organic electronic defence to be survivable, then this means that any combat grouping must have an EW capability. We may consider a combat grouping to comprise a platoon or troop, made up of four vehicles or three squads/sections of soldiers and a command team. This is the minimal practical force element likely to occupy a piece of terrain. It is also worth noting that while the distribution of ECMs to defeat IEDs has been practised below platoon, this led to platoons fielding two multiples, rather than three sections, as the weight of these ECMs required additional soldiers in each section to carry the requisite equipment. While this was feasible in a counterinsurgency context, it would be overly disruptive to platoon tactics in a peer conflict, and so retaining the three-section structure means that managing EW systems at the platoon level as the lowest echelon appears reasonable. For vehicles, the weight constraint is not a factor, so the density of systems can be higher. If we therefore envisage the basic EW kit as comprising an SDR capable of either electronic surveillance, attack or defence, a suitable antenna for either receipt or transmission, and a power source, this produces a reasonable planning assumption for the density of these systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platoon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infantry platoon may be envisaged as having one such EWSDR and a power source, but with each section carrying antennas capable of both defensive and offensive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laydown of the platoon’s EW capability, therefore, may be framed as follows. On the offence, one section may carry the EWSDR with antenna set to receive, contributing a single point for an EW baseline in electronic surveillance. Upon contact, or coming under observation, the platoon could set the antenna to transmit and maintain an area electronic defence against UASs or GNSSs while conducting offensive manoeuvres. Alternatively, the platoon could ground-base the EWSDR with a power source and have a series of networked antennas provide defence during an offensive action. Connecting four antennas to it, three would form a reconnaissance baseline and one an attack function, or all four an attack function, over the depth of a platoon attack. On the defence, each section might mount its receiving and transmitting antennas around its dugouts and connect these by cable to the EWSDR, connected to a dug-in power source, so that the platoon can have a defensive perimeter of jamming, as well as an organic EW baseline. The EWSDR, connected to an appropriate dedicated bearer network or Starlink terminal, or exploiting other bearers of opportunity, could then transmit the data and receive direction from higher echelon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a vehicle platoon, the density of systems would comprise one EWSDR, with a receiving and transmitting antenna on each vehicle, so that the platoon has an effective means of protecting itself, or else forms a baseline of up to four nodes. The functionality of the EWSDR would be very limited for the echelon, with options for a surveillance function, radio frequency (RF) jamming or GNSS jamming to be on or off. RF jamming could either feed off the detections from the surveillance function or be on specified frequencies determined by higher echelon, with instructions from higher echelon adjusting the frequencies being jammed. For EA, there is also the opportunity to mount the antenna and EWSDR on an uncrewed platform to offset the emissions from the actual vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirement at company level would be minimal as regards additional capability, since the company commander’s main task would be to issue instructions as to the disposition of the antennas fielded by the company’s subordinate platoons. However, there would be value in an EWSDR being held by the company command group, with a display terminal allowing the company signaller to monitor the aggregated electromagnetic picture built up by the company’s distributed sensors. This could be achieved by the EWSDR allowing the aggregate picture across its associated tactical communications and information systems to be accessed via authenticated laptops connected to the EWSDR by cable. Thus, if required, any unit with an EWSDR could monitor the company electromagnetic picture, although this situation would not generally be the case. The company command post, if it is connected to higher echelons via SATCOM or another higher-bandwidth system, may also be the routing point for sharing the aggregated electromagnetic picture with higher echelons. Android Team Awareness Kit and other existing C2 tools already have the functionality to display the electromagnetic picture, if it can be transmitted. The priority is to expand the availability of this picture for systems like ZODIAC without duplicating pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battalion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is at battalion level that the need for a dedicated EW section as part of a signals platoon becomes critical. Put simply, the number of EWSDRs distributed across a battalion means that the unit must have the ability to maintain their functionality in peacetime, necessitating a team with the relevant expertise. From the point of view of efficiency, possessing this EW logistics function at battalion is most desirable, as it represents an economy of scale between fielded systems and maintainers, while still being close enough to the user to be responsive to tactical demands and engaged with the tactical outcomes. In combat, this section would have wider utility. First, the section would be using the collected electronic surveillance picture to advise the battalion commander and support the battalion intelligence officer. Second, this section could possess the expertise to distribute updates to the battalion EW baselines in order to ensure that jamming was targeting frequencies in use by enemy UAS and other systems. The section could also determine which recorded signals deserved transmission to higher echelons for analysis. Third, as part of the planning process, this section could liaise with higher echelons to receive effects to be transmitted to platoon EWSDRs and thereafter turned on by the platoon under the conditions determined by battalion and company plans. This section, therefore, would be the nexus for integrating tactical EW with the company schemes of manoeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brigade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brigade is the echelon at which two factors critically intersect. First, as the echelon able to generate full combined arms groupings to successfully execute individual tactical actions, brigade is the echelon best placed to manage the deconfliction of EW effects between those arms. A battalion needs to deconflict, but owns its core assets under permanent command. A brigade integrates functions that train and are generated separately. As multiple kill chains and coordination mechanisms must intersect at brigade, this is the echelon that is appropriate for making sure that battalion EW assets do not threaten the efficiency of brigade fires or air defence. Second, brigades are the appropriate echelon to have dedicated EW capabilities to deliver bespoke effects or effects at greater range against higher-value targets. To achieve this, a realistic scaling appears to be the fielding of an EW company with a troop supporting the brigade headquarters with battlespace management, and troops crewing dedicated vehicles with larger EW antennas, generators and their own SDRs. It is likely that one of these troops would be primarily responsible for the electronic defence of brigade assets and enablers, especially logistics elements. The other troop would be dedicated to EA against priority targets, used proactively to shape and disrupt the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Division&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At division, responsibility would therefore pivot from its current position of planning and deconflicting the employment of EW to acting at the boundary between tactical EW and national technical means. First, there is the provision of collection from the division’s subordinate elements to national technical means for analysis, and second, there is the drawing on national technical means to push bespoke payloads to subordinate elements. The division is likely the echelon best able to receive the surveillance picture from its subordinate elements, and to have the analytical capacity to analyse it. It is also likely to be able to receive this picture from the joint force and so compare the joint picture with that generated by its subordinate echelons. Further, the division likely has the ability to direct the assets of its subordinate brigades to assist with joint operations, or to field requests from the brigades to use higher-echelon EW to enable tactical actions. It is equally arguable that this function should sit at the corps level, with the division primarily concerned with the electronic defence of its rear area and critical sites using dedicated EW troops. The purist’s solution would likely be the latter one, but as few NATO forces operate at the corps level, most are more likely to find it necessary to field this function at the division level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyber Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final consideration is the responsibility – likely concentrated at division – for assuring the cyber security of the networks across the formation, which must include the networks supporting the C2 of EW. This same element may also be responsible for the planning and distribution of cyber payloads where the EW enterprise is the delivery mechanism. Given the security classification of these capabilities and therefore the challenges in executing this planning, the division is likely to be the most realistic echelon at which a presence of appropriate personnel can be maintained. Nevertheless, it is necessary for the EW enterprise below the division to understand how to receive and execute capabilities generated from within the cyber function of the divisional headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overcoming-challenges&quot;&gt;Overcoming Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many respects, there already exists a scalable industrial base for the manufacture and procurement of the SDRs outlined above, their associated antennas, and even the C2 software for managing these assets. The network underpinning the C2 model is also deliverable with existing technology. The main barriers to fielding such capability are organisational and bureaucratic, rather than being related to development of/access to technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Procurement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military C2 functions have historically been distributed by warfighting function, and therefore locked in with different companies that have a limited interest in integrating with the C2 tools of others. The drive towards open architectures has reduced this as a structural problem, though procurement processes lag behind institutional intent. Although industry incentives and therefore behaviour are changing, the process of breaking down these barriers is often prohibitively expensive at the whole-of-force level, resulting in only isolated pockets of integration existing in cross-domain functions. Such silos impede the integration of multiple specialised domain-specific functions, leading to delays and the further breaching of budgets. Similar dynamics apply for communication equipment procurement. Although domain integration has fewer requirements at the tactical radio level, it remains critical to combined operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wider concerns about procurement strategies aligning more closely with platform-centric approaches further inhibit the ability to field competitive EW. Software-defined systems, whether tactical SDRs or higher-echelon capabilities, require constant software injections both to continue basic functionality and to respond to rapid battlefield changes. Shifting to software-as-a-service approaches permits greater long-term flexibility in the industrial relationship to maintain the delivery of such updates, but can exacerbate reliance on a small number of software vendors. Open Architecture standards provide the opportunity to expand the number of vendors able to contribute to a given system. Broader discussions of whether to mandate vendor-agnostic systems or establish the defence estate as the software owner fall outside the remit of this paper, but decisions in these areas will certainly affect the agility of EW capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Integration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when procurement of discrete systems is possible, the question of integration with existing capabilities persists. Unless it is possible to replace entire systems simultaneously, a degree of effort will be required to enhance backward compatibility when integrating legacy systems with new capabilities and enablers. A high-intensity war could also see a piecemeal procurement process where forces field a mosaic of EW equipment, requiring some level of interoperability. Software-defined systems can mitigate the burden of the legacy equipment, but reliance upon strategies of spiral development, or re-engineering architectures for greater openness, may also be necessary. This is already the practice in a wide range of industries, but is not yet fully realised in the way defence manages programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integrated sensing across the force described earlier requires continuous deconfliction and redelegation of assets at echelon to maintain functionality, yet bandwidth limitations and latency constrain the amount of raw data that edge sensors can transmit to higher levels for processing. As such, greater processing and compute capabilities will need to be delegated to tactical levels not only to process and retask SDRs, but also to filter the data that can – and must – be transmitted to command levels. Latency-sensitive intelligence would take priority for edge processing, while other data could be transmitted upwards, either to other edge or near-edge processors or to cloud-hosted applications. Relatively unsophisticated algorithms can accomplish some of the basic processing functions at platoon level, with compute increasing in correlation with command size and distance from the edge. Technically integrating such a model is feasible, although it would require both the EW architecture to maintain strict data standards (to ensure integration between platforms and systems) and for operators to be knowledgeable about data functionality. All this can be resolved, but managing the hardware and software changes across the existing force in a fiscally constrained environment is not programmatically simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assuring-the-force&quot;&gt;Assuring the Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to conceptualise a software-defined EW enterprise for ground forces, but quite another to field one that can operate effectively. Even successful procurement and technical integration of the equipment would not create a fieldable capability. EW capabilities are far too often trained in their silo, rather than as part of a combined arms exercise. This prevents commanders from being exposed to the capability and from becoming familiar with how to plan and integrate it into operations, thereby producing serious friction in real-world combat scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The starting point, therefore, is that the basic principles of EW need to be a component of low-level all-arms training. Officers do not need to be technical experts, but they do need to understand the concepts of application, so that they can ask the right questions of their EW operators and make reasonable planning assumptions about how to integrate EW into their scheme of manoeuvre. All ranks also need to be made aware of what is (and what is not) possible with EW, so that they practise effective discipline in managing their emissions. As EW becomes a core combined arms function, it must be demystified. Training which does not address EW risks teaching units false lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Training the force is complicated by four factors. First, EW introduces significant uncertainty into how systems perform, which raises safety risks during training, as imprecise navigation, for example, can disrupt safety measures to deconflict forces. Second, electronic defeat of a force may significantly disrupt the training of other arms, because important exercise opportunities will be wasted while most parts of an all-arms force wait for a small cadre of signallers to resolve connectivity issues. Addressing this issue is partly about redefining it from being an opportunity cost to being a wider training opportunity related to something that could occur frequently on operations. Third, live EW can affect civilian systems, including aircraft navigation, so finding areas where there is the opportunity to both manoeuvre forces and emit without posing a risk to civilians can be a challenge. Fourth, there are security concerns associated with EW related to the fact that if forces emit their attack frequencies, these can be recorded by enemy space-based electronic surveillance and so countered. (This concern does not apply to using electronic surveillance to train friendly forces on their own emissions.) In general, these four factors combine to prevent realistic training. Nevertheless, combined arms training utilising EW is critical to assuring the readiness of the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues can be resolved in a number of ways. Many of the process challenges and much of the uncertainty imposed by EW on commanders can be replicated in synthetic environments supporting command post exercises. It is therefore possible to effectively train officers in the battlespace management and deconfliction challenges that emerge from EW without jamming during live exercises. Accurate simulation of EW effects against synthetic systems can also be used to reduce the problems associated with emitting under observation and thereby exposing waveforms and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electronic surveillance, meanwhile, can be integrated into live exercises. This is routinely done at the US National Training Center, but is less common in Europe. Giving commanders an understanding of their own signature in the spectrum is an effective means of convincing them that the capability can have utility for them. Training officers to become familiar with when and where to establish EW baselines and how to erect these capabilities is best done during battalion exercises rather than in simulated environments, as synthetic environments will not create an intuitive feel for causes of friction and for the time and effort involved in carrying out the task properly. In most European militaries, the shortage of EW personnel is a major barrier to being able to integrate capabilities into exercises in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as EW becomes a core component of combined arms manoeuvre, forces need to appreciate that many tactical effects are no longer especially sensitive. For example, the update cycle on UAV techniques and communications means that exposing the ability to jam a system is to cede a couple of weeks of development at most. When it comes to tactical UAVs, it is far more important that troops know how to detect and protect themselves from UAVs, and that the EW personnel know how to update their jammers, than it is to assure day-one jamming against a specific UAV type. In any case, it is likely that the UAV in question, if used at large scale in the enemy force, will have already been adapted by the time a conflict breaks out. It is also critical that friendly UAV operators are familiar with adapting their platforms and using tactics to get around EW systems. There is therefore considerable utility and limited risk in having live exercises in which UAV teams seek to fly through/around defences erected by EW troops. This would need to be done at a location where the permissions and regulatory environment are favourable to flying UAVs that may not be under control. Having such a site, however, is vital for assuring the readiness of the force, and with the right control measures, the exercises there can be conducted safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digitisation of the battlefield has seen the electrification of every aspect of warfare, down to the equipment of an individual dismounted soldier. This has vastly increased the situational awareness available at all echelons, the lethality and precision of weapons, and the scale and complexity of what can be planned and coordinated. However, it also means that the force is pervasively present in the EMS and therefore potentially vulnerable. Effectively exploiting this threat surface offers myriad tactical opportunities. Neglecting the preparation of forces for an intensely contested EMS is to risk having one’s forces found, struck and disrupted throughout their operational depth. This paper has sought to outline how EW can be fielded to ensure that forces are competitive on current and future battlefields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capabilities described in this paper represent a step-change in what current military forces routinely field and deploy across NATO. All the constituent technologies already exist, however, and are fielded – in isolation – across the force. Moreover, while NATO forces have not prioritised EW, adversaries and partners certainly have. EW is a brigade asset in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, while Russia has gone beyond fielding EW companies at brigade to also issue “trench EW” systems routinely fielded at company level. Russia has also made significant progress in integrating these capabilities and centralising the accumulation of electronic reconnaissance to accelerate their kill chains. In short, the capabilities advocated for in this paper not only offer opportunities to the force, but also can be considered to be the basic requirement to remain competitive against pacing threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EW systems can be expensive, and as NATO forces try to regenerate combat power there is a significant opportunity cost in prioritising spending on force multipliers – like EW – without sufficient forces to be multiplied. Fundamentals must come first. Nevertheless, an examination of the rate of attrition from precision fires a force will face if it lacks electronic defence shows that fielding appropriate EW capabilities at echelon significantly improves the survivability and resilience of the force. Furthermore, the software and programmable systems that allow sophisticated EW effects to be generated are now fieldable using comparatively cheap components. The multifunctionality of software-defined systems also reduces the need to have fleets comprising multiple different capabilities aimed at different targets. Perhaps the biggest challenge in getting EW prioritised correctly is culture, as it remains a small specialism that much of the force finds hard to visualise. This must change, because EW is now an all-arms business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If British land forces are to field competitive EW systems, professional military education needs to create a cadre of junior and field-grade leaders to understand how to think about the EMS and plan operations that manoeuvre through it. It is also imperative that all soldiers are “spectrum-minded”, such that they have a basic understanding of why the spectrum is vital, how it enables effects and manoeuvre, and how their own presence within it creates potential vulnerabilities. Further, it is necessary to create synthetic and real-world training environments where forces can experiment with EW capabilities. The force needs to receive the SDRs and associated antennas so that they can practice, adapt and learn to use them as a routine aspect of operations. It may not be possible under current budgetary conditions to fund such a high density of systems across the whole force, but iteratively rolling out capabilities within units would allow the relevant tactics and distribution of capabilities to be refined without massively increasing in-year spending. Regardless of the roll-out mode that is employed, the end result must be that British forces are competitive in the EMS if they are committed into action.&lt;/p&gt;

Now is the time to match rhetoric with action to make sure it is integrated and used at scale in the joint force.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A steady cadence of speeches, strategies, reports, and recommendations from senior defense officials and experts extol the virtues of commercial space and urge increased use of commercial space services and products for national security. Yet the rhetoric does not match reality, in spite of meaningful progress made at the Pentagon, as commercial space is not being integrated and used at the scale needed to maximize its contribution to operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense (DOD) is making it easier to buy commercial space, creating contracts and developing new frameworks, but sorting out how to acquire commercial solutions is only part of the problem. The military needs a process to validate when commercial products and services meet operational requirements. There is also currently no formal service-level guidance on accepting commercial space services into operational use from the Space Force or any other service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though policymakers recognize the need to modernize requirements processes, there has been much less attention paid to operationalization challenges, including the unique difficulties of operationalizing a commercial service. Unlike commercial products, which mostly fit into current processes, commercial space services are incompatible with Space Force system acceptance procedures for operational capabilities. As such, the military risks fielding commercial services that have neither undergone the vetting as other systems presented to combatant commanders nor the same rigorous process to ensure they fit into the joint force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full integration and maximized use of commercial space services only happens when commercial services can be operationalized like any other warfighting capability—i.e., included in readiness and sustainment activities, budgeted in operations and maintenance accounts, allocated and presented to combatant commanders for operational use, and considered in future force planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assumptions-and-definitions&quot;&gt;Assumptions and Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper uses the definition of a commercial product and service found in Title 41 of the U.S. Code. Thus, when the government purchases a commercial space product it is purchasing a tangible item, which upon delivery, becomes the government’s property and can be stored, transported, and operated at the sole discretion of the government. On the other hand, when the government purchases a commercial space service, it is not buying a tangible item but rather a commitment from a provider for an agreed-to result, outcome, or task. The provision of a commercial service is intrinsically linked to an ongoing relationship with the provider, whereas the relationship with a vendor can be separated upon delivery of the product to the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report focuses on commercial space services—also called the space-as-a-service model—for two reasons: the growing prevalence of this business model in the space industry and the unique challenges associated with operationalizing a commercial service. There is neither an acquisition pathway in the DOD’s Adaptive Acquisition Framework (AAF) nor Space Force service-level guidance for operationalizing commercial services. Though both the AAF and Space Force instructions include guidance on using commercial services, neither set of guidelines provides a clear path to operations and sustainment for services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No similar barriers exist to operationalize commercial space products, because in the AAF and Space Force system acceptance framework, commercial products look no different than custom-built capabilities. Both commercial products and traditional systems—like an F-35 fighter or Ford-class aircraft carrier—are handed over to the military as the new owner and operator. The military almost certainly maintains a relationship with the vendor of these capabilities, but it is for acquiring parts and upgrades, for example, and not part and parcel of the day-to-day operation of the weapon system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this paper focuses on the integration and use of commercial space products and services, it will primarily focus on Space Force processes, without taking a wider view as to how processes in other services may impact the integration and use of commercial solutions writ large. However, the integration and use of all commercial technologies and solutions in military operations requires a focus on the same three elements—requirements, acquisition, and operationalization—herein examined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-on-government-use-of-commercial-solutions&quot;&gt;Background on Government Use of Commercial Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating and using commercial space solutions is just the latest chapter in a long story about the role of the private sector in supporting the U.S. military. Until the twentieth century, military officials believed that only government-run arsenals should produce military munitions and weapons. As a result, at the onset of World War I, the U.S. military was not prepared to manufacture artillery, tanks, munitions, and aircraft at the needed scale, having to rely instead on industry in Great Britain and France throughout the war. Learning from this lesson, the U.S. government contracted with the private sector to build and deliver munitions, ships, aircraft, tanks, and other warfighting equipment during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the United States did not have a statutory definition of what functions had to be done by the federal government, and not private companies, until the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998. Reflecting bipartisan consensus and public opinion, which did not support the government developing products and services that competed with the private sector, the law sought to narrowly define what only the government could do. Government leaders believed that using commercial services could save the taxpayer money, presenting an opportunity to help reign in growing federal spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following enactment of the FAIR Act, officials provided further guidance on the use of commercial solutions in Office of Budget Management Circular No. A-76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart 7.5, making clear that the government should buy and use commercial services when they meet government needs and not automatically seek to build a government-specific solution. Though these rules apply to DOD acquisitions just as much as they do to any other federal agency, lawmakers amended Title 10 as part of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 to require a DOD preference for commercial solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, tech startup Palantir successfully sued the U.S. government to be included as a bidder for work on the Army’s next-generation intelligence processing and dissemination system. Palantir argued in court, and a federal judge agreed, that the U.S. Army violated FASA because it did not conduct market research to determine when commercial solutions could meet military requirements and instead unlawfully favored the acquisition of a non-commercial solution from a traditional defense contractor. Proponents for the Army’s approach said that the Palantir commercial solution could not meet all requirements, though the then–Army Chief of Staff somewhat undermined that position when he came out as lukewarm about the program’s capabilities. SpaceX similarly sued the Air Force in 2014 over its noncompetitive launch services procurement process, eventually settling when the Air Force agreed to offer more launches for competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, DOD has opened the aperture to look at a wide variety of commercial space solutions, including remote sensing, in-space servicing, space domain awareness, and debris removal, continuing also to acquire launch and satellite communications as commercial services. The release of two related commercial space strategy documents in April 2024—the DOD Commercial Space Integration Strategy and Space Force Commercial Space Strategy—reflect a growing urgency by DOD leaders to figure out how to better use this cornucopia of commercial space solutions. On the heels of the strategies’ release, the Defense Science Board published a report in May 2024 with recommendations for improving the use and integration of commercial space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acquiring-commercial-space&quot;&gt;Acquiring Commercial Space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, DOD has worked to create several procurement frameworks to get commercial space solutions quickly on contract. The Space Force is finalizing the Commercial Augmentation Space Reserve program, which would set up a contractual framework to seamlessly tap into commercial space capabilities during peacetime, crisis, and war. Additionally, a joint effort between the Defense Information Systems Agency and Space Force has created a marketplace populated by low Earth orbit commercial space offerings so that they can be easily acquired by different DOD components. Finally, Space Systems Command (SSC) stood up the Global Data Marketplace to provide space-based surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking solutions to military commanders. For several years, SSC has also managed a space domain awareness (SDA) contract, which has been used by the U.S. Space Command to acquire commercial SDA data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these initiatives create mechanisms through which the Space Force, combatant commands, and other possible users of commercial space can quickly buy commercial space products and services. These procurement mechanisms are designed to make it easy for a potential user of commercial space to buy what is needed on a timeline that is relevant to the warfighter. But these contracts alone neither clarify how commercial space solutions meet military requirements nor ensure they were subjected to formalized system acceptance processes for operationalizing new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-validate-commercial-space-solutions-meet-operational-requirements&quot;&gt;How to Validate Commercial Space Solutions Meet Operational Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past several years, defense experts, lawmakers, and policymakers have increasingly emphasized the need to modernize requirements processes, in part to better take advantage of commercial products and services. Other experts have provided recommendations on ways to improve the military’s requirements process, called the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), aiming to address concerns about its timeliness and lack of focus on joint capabilities, as well as recommendations on how modernizing JCIDS can enhance DOD’s ability to incorporate innovation and new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper will not specifically examine or offer ideas to improve the JCIDS process, primarily because doing so would involve issues much broader than integrating and using commercial space. However, the paper’s author echoes sentiments expressed in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2024 that called for the establishment of a process within the requirements system to “rapidly validate the ability of commercial products and services to meet capability needs or opportunities.” Establishing such a process would markedly improve DOD’s ability to integrate and use commercial space solutions, as it would help acquisition officials pair requirements (i.e., officially validated warfighter needs) with commercial offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this process, before selecting an acquisition path to deliver a new space capability, the DOD and Space Force should take formal steps to conduct thorough market surveys, assessing whether commercial space products and services already exist to meet an operational requirement. That mechanism should also be sufficiently nuanced to identify commercial space options that meet most, but perhaps not all, operational requirements. But rather than being automatically excluded, such options should be considered, since it might make sense to accept a less-capable solution if it could be delivered sooner or modified to meet all requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the preference in the U.S. Code afforded to commercial solutions, held up in court through the Palantir lawsuit in 2016, in virtually every case that a commercial space solution can meet an operational requirement, the Space Force should favor that commercial option over one developed from scratch for the government. Though DOD has a habit of creating requirements that seem designed to eliminate commercial options, commercial solutions that do not meet 100 percent of a military requirement should not automatically be ruled out of consideration. In many cases, modifying a commercial space solution rather than developing a noncommercial system from the ground up can save time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of a repeatable process to assess and validate whether commercial solutions meet operational requirements should be paired with a modification to the AAF acquisition pathways, because there is no current path for commercial services intended for operations and sustainment. Relatedly, it is not clear how commercial space products that can be purchased for warfighter use without any modifications—such as SDA data or analytical insights—fit into the AAF. For either a commercial service or product, some type of effort might also be required to modify, tailor, or enhance the commercial option to meet warfighting needs. The AAF should better delineate a pathway designed for modifying a commercial space product or service—or any commercial solution, for that matter—to meet operational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to deciding which current commercial solutions meet requirements, DOD should develop a way to look to the horizon, identifying and potentially shaping commercial space solutions that, when brought to market, will meet future needs. Military officials will also need adequate situational awareness of the commercial space market, relationships with space companies developing commercial services and products, and forecasting of what could be coming down the pike to help manage the balance between functions, missions, and tasks that could or might be performed commercially and those which need a government-operated capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having such situational awareness is important not only for identifying new commercial solutions, but also to keep tabs on which ones become obsolete or unavailable. For example, a company providing a commercial space service used for military operations could go out of business. In such a case, the military would want as much notice as possible that it would be required to build its own capacity to provide a capability that had heretofore acquired commercially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;operationalizing-commercial-space-solutions&quot;&gt;Operationalizing Commercial Space Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A successful acquisition program produces a system that is accepted by a service branch before it enters operational use. Presumably, the Space Force would be the service operationalizing a commercial space solution, so this paper examines Space Force rules for system acceptance. According to those rules, a system effectively means a product that the Space Force acquires and owns, ensuring its fully-burdened life-cycle costs and readiness to contribute to the joint fight. The Space Force presents a fully accepted operational system to a combatant command, part of its core mission to train, equip, and organize forces for use in joint operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though more often than not the Space Force is accepting systems specifically designed for the military, the existing system acceptance process also works for commercial space products. But there is no clear, formally documented Space Force acceptance guidance that covers the use of a commercial space service for operational use. Operationalizing commercial services requires accepting an ongoing relationship with the commercial provider—not just for buying spare parts, but for the day-to-day use of the service, in peacetime and conflict—for the entire life of a warfighting capability. A company would be providing a warfighting capability as a service to a combatant commander and would play an ongoing role in ensuring the readiness and sustainment of a military capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acceptance processes support the use of commercial services for institutional use—but not operations. In many cases, this is a distinction without a difference, since institutional uses of commercial services, such as use of commercial cloud for information technology needs, directly impact the ability of military leaders to conduct operations. Beyond providing information technology services, other commercial services including satellite communications are already used in operations today. In these cases, commercial services end up being treated like commodities, available whenever needed and in whatever quantities are required by commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one in the Space Force is responsible for readiness and sustainment of commercial satellite communications. Unlike with traditional systems, the Space Force has no formal, documented role in presenting commercial space services to combatant commands. There is no application of an official, rigorous acceptance process before a commercial service is used in operations, since there is no equivalent to a systems acceptance process for a commercial service. While the Commercial Space Office (COMSO) in the Space Force has money to buy and facilitate the use of commercial space solutions, and is working with Space Command’s Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell on ways to help integrate and use commercial space solutions in the joint force, it currently has no institutionalized role in operationalizing commercial services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a Space Force process for operationalizing commercial services, full integration of commercial space into joint operations is a dangerous illusion. Without that process, no one is formally responsible for ensuring full consideration of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy issues—known officially in DOD as DOTMLPF-P analysis and documentation—related to commercial space capabilities. Though the Space Force’s COMSO and Space Command’s JCO are folding commercial space services into training exercises and wargaming, there are no formal mechanisms to ensure the consistent inclusion of commercial services in readiness and sustainment activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of those concerns, without a military service agreeing to operationalize a commercial service, there will remain some ambiguity about how exactly that commercial service fits into joint operations, force management and generation, and force planning efforts. Commercial services will remain orphaned from those processes, treated as something that can be purchased off-the-shelf at whatever time and in whatever quantity is needed. So long as commercial space services are treated like commodities, commercial providers have no specific direction on how much capacity will be needed where and when, making it difficult for companies to adequately build out networks and systems to seamlessly meet warfighter needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treating commercial space services as a commodity also limits DOD’s role in shaping developments of commercial space services—it is left stuck with what it gets. On the contrary, DOD can influence the direction of commercial services and would be best prepared to do so if it accounts for commercial services in future force planning activities. Including providers of commercial space services in such activities can help both the military and companies better plan for next-generation services, most importantly helping companies develop services that are fully informed by the expectations of military planners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, creating a path for a service branch to certify that a commercial space solution meets a military requirement not only opens the door to operationalizing that solution but also clarifies how the military pays for operational use of commercial space—it means a service branch pays. A combatant command should not be responsible for paying, since commercial solutions should be presented to combatant commands just like any other operational capability. Operationalizing commercial space also signals to industry that recurring revenue is on the table, giving space executives confidence to make investments into commercial space capabilities with the warfighter in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modernizing requirements processes and creating procurement frameworks and contracts are not enough to ensure the full integration and use of commercial space. A third critical, and less discussed, step is figuring out how the Space Force operationalizes commercial services. Not doing so casts doubt on how commercial solutions could fit into readiness and sustainment activities, as well as force management and future planning. Clarifying how commercial space solutions are accepted into the Space Force also determining who should be paying (hint: Space Force and not the combatant commands).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure to develop a path to transition commercial space to operational use also means companies may doubt the long-term commitment of the military to buy commercial space solutions. Without that certainty, shareholders and investors may grow tired of their companies making bold, expensive bets on new solutions that can help advance U.S. national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, military leaders see the revolutionary potential of commercial space. Now is the time to match rhetoric with action and continue taking measures to lay the foundation for the successful integration and use of commercial space in the national security enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing war in Ukraine has placed significant pressure on allied nations to enforce sanctions that limit Russia’s ability to fund and resource its military in the invasion. As a G7 member – and with an eye on the need for reciprocal allied unity in the face of any future potential “Taiwan crisis” – Japan has implemented measures to align with allied sanctions regimes, including restrictions targeting critical sectors of the Russian economy. However, Japan’s unique position as a major importer of Russian energy, coupled with its geographic proximity to nations facilitating sanctions circumvention, presents distinct challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further explore national efforts to implement and enforce sanctions against Russia, RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS), in collaboration with the Japan Institute of International Affairs, convened a roundtable discussion with government officials, academics and representatives from the Japanese business community in Tokyo in November 2024. This event is part of the in-country engagements conducted by the CFS-led Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), supported by the National Endowment for Democracy. The event was supplemented by a series of one-on-one meetings in Tokyo during the visit. None of the discussions from the event or meetings are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview-of-japans-sanctions-legislative-frameworks&quot;&gt;Overview of Japan’s Sanctions Legislative Frameworks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable opened with an overview of the existing legislative and operational frameworks related to sanctions in Japan. Government representatives described how Japan has introduced substantial measures to enforce sanctions against Russia under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (FEFTA), legislation dating from 1949. These efforts include restrictions on specific sectors such as high-tech exports, financial transactions and energy imports. Taking these actions under FEFTA has allowed Japan to align with G7 sanctions while introducing domestic enforcement mechanisms, despite FEFTA not being specifically designed with its current use in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under FEFTA, Japan has a dual enforcement regime, encompassing both criminal and administrative measures. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) can also conduct post-event reviews and on-site investigations to identify violations, with penalties ranging from fines to a one-year export ban for companies that breach sanctions. Participants noted that such measures are particularly punitive for firms reliant on Russian markets, as they risk significant financial losses or insolvency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, given that FEFTA was not designed with sanctions implementation in mind, participants highlighted that FEFTA is insufficiently equipped to address the specific challenges of circumvention and transhipment through third countries posed by Russia. FETFA does not include any provisions related to circumvention but the Japanese government has explicitly stated that it interprets FEFTA to also apply to cases involving sanctions circumvention. In June 2024, the government announced additional export bans targeting entities in China, India, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan suspected of participating in sanctions circumvention, underlining its commitment to countering circumvention. In recent actions, the government further clarified that regarding payment and capital transaction restrictions, “the applicability of the regulations will be determined not by the formal name of the party, but by comprehensively considering the actual parties and the decision-makers of payments and capital transactions, and the beneficiaries”. Participants agreed that this extends the regulations to cases of circumvention where a third party’s name is used. Similarly, for export controls, the government has affirmed that “the act of exporting items designated as prohibited for export to Russia through countries or regions other than Russia (circumventing exports) is a violation of the export ban measures under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act”. This clarifies that restricted exports routed through third countries to reach Russia are also violations of the export ban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under FEFTA, the government can issue cabinet orders to specify the items to be controlled, which provides a degree of flexibility in interpreting and implementing the law. Despite this flexibility, participants agreed that the lack of explicit provisions to address circumvention and transhipment creates enforcement gaps and confusion among private sector actors. Moreover, enforcement capacity remains limited. METI, which oversees sanctions compliance, has limited personnel dedicated to Russia-related sanctions enforcement. Participants further indicated that Japan’s judicial and law enforcement agencies also face considerable challenges in achieving convictions, primarily due to high evidentiary standards and difficulties in proving that exporters knowingly violated sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government representatives at the roundtable did note that Japan has successfully achieved its first conviction related to a violation of Russian sanctions. In July 2024, the Osaka Prefectural Police arrested the representative director of a trading company, a Russian national, accused of illegally exporting one marine engine, four jet skis, boat trailers and motorcycles. The goods were allegedly exported to Russia from Osaka in January 2023 without obtaining the required government approval and routed through South Korea. The individual was convicted in October 2024 and sentenced to three years in prison and a ¥5-million fine. Participants described this as an exemplary case of Japan’s increasing determination to enforce sanctions against Russia, including its willingness to pursue and penalise circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;persisting-challenges-in-sanctions-implementation&quot;&gt;Persisting Challenges in Sanctions Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan has demonstrated a strong commitment to implementing sanctions against Russia, enforcement remains hindered by more than just resource limitations within the government. Additional challenges, including regulatory gaps, limited understanding of circumvention risks, and international alignment among sanctioning countries, further complicate efforts to ensure the effective implementation of sanctions in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;opacity-of-beneficial-ownership-in-japan&quot;&gt;Opacity of Beneficial Ownership in Japan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advancing the transparency of beneficial ownership in Japan has been a focal point in the country’s efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has conducted evaluations to assess Japan’s compliance with international standards in this area. In its 2021 Mutual Evaluation Report, FATF identified significant deficiencies in Japan’s framework for transparency and beneficial ownership of legal persons and arrangements. The report highlighted that the mechanisms in place were insufficient to ensure that accurate and up-to-date beneficial ownership information was available to competent authorities in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Follow-up Report by the FATF acknowledged that Japan has made progress in strengthening its framework, but challenges remain. In the SIFMANet series of country workshops, participants repeatedly note the importance of accurate and accessible beneficial ownership information. This shortcoming in Japan continues to pose challenges for effective enforcement of sanctions and the prevention of illicit financial activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-awareness-of-circumvention-risks&quot;&gt;Private Sector Awareness of Circumvention Risks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions circumvention remains a significant challenge for Japan, with restricted goods exported from Japan often finding their way to Russia via third countries. Participants highlighted that Southeast Asia and the UAE have become key transit points for Japanese goods, with Malaysia standing out as a major hub for re-exports. They added that exports to Mongolia have also doubled, raising concerns about the potential for these goods to be redirected to Russia. Despite the risks, many participants noted that there is limited awareness among Japanese businesses, particularly non-financial corporations, about the complexities and consequences of sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government representatives stated that they conduct numerous outreach initiatives to the private sector, targeting machine tools manufacturers, the automobile industry, and trading companies, among others. The aforementioned case marking the first conviction for sanctions violations in Japan was regarded as a warning to businesses that indirect violations such as diverting goods through third countries can result in severe legal and reputational consequences. However, challenges persist. METI has implemented measures to identify high-risk activities by monitoring customs clearing data and promoting internal investigations within companies. Yet, proving the origin of goods exported to Russia from third countries and evidencing the exporter’s knowledge of circumvention pose significant challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants further highlighted that many Japanese companies lack a full understanding of the risks associated with US secondary sanctions, which can have financial repercussions for Japanese businesses. Past incidents, such as Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ’s $250-million fine for breaching US sanctions against Iran, underscore the potential penalties for non-compliance. Recognising these gaps, METI has prioritised providing guidance to businesses, encouraging enhanced due diligence and promoting internal compliance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, representatives from the private sector emphasised that the complexity of overlapping sanctions regimes continues to create confusion for businesses, often leading to overcompliance. This trend is exemplified by Uniqlo’s decision to suspend operations in Russia in March 2022, despite not being directly affected by sanctions. Such overcompliance highlights the reputational risks that drive many companies to operate with caution, even when legal frameworks do not explicitly require them to withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japans-restrictions-on-car-exports-to-russia&quot;&gt;Japan’s Restrictions on Car Exports to Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s sanctions against Russia have notably impacted the automotive sector, an area highlighted by some participants. In April 2022, Japan banned the export of luxury cars valued over ¥6 million to Russia, including all hybrids, plug-in hybrids and electric models, as well as petrol and diesel vehicles with an engine size exceeding 1,900cc. These restrictions significantly reduced Japanese car exports to Russia, which totalled approximately ¥600 billion in 2022, declining 30% from the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, Japan adjusted its policy, permitting the export of “mild hybrid vehicles”, which use electric motors to assist petrol engines but cannot operate solely on electric power. This move allowed Japanese manufacturers such as Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Suzuki to resume limited exports, addressing domestic economic concerns while maintaining alignment with broader sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that with this policy shift, Japan seeks to balance its commitment to international sanctions with the economic and influential interests of its automotive industry. Core restrictions on vehicles with larger engine capacities and fully electric or plug-in hybrid systems remain in place, underscoring Japan’s commitment to limiting goods that could support Russia’s industrial or military sectors. This partial relaxation of automotive export controls also allows Japan to somewhat counteract the growing dominance of Chinese car brands in the Russian market, which have risen from a 9% to a 57% market share following Western sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s evolving automotive sanctions highlight the complexities of balancing geopolitical objectives with economic considerations, demonstrating the careful navigation required to enforce effective sanctions while minimising unintended domestic impacts – and potentially negative political consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japanese-piano-exports-to-russia&quot;&gt;Japanese Piano Exports to Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The export of Japanese pianos to Russia has drawn attention as an example of sanctions evasion through transhipment and re-export routes. While Japan imposed export bans on luxury goods, including grand pianos over ¥200,000, Japanese pianos have been identified in the Russian market, often reaching their destination through intermediaries in third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants found that the trade in pianos highlights the challenges Japan faces in enforcing sanctions in the context of complex global supply chains. Pianos exported from Japan are often routed through third countries where they are re-exported to Russia. These intermediaries exploit gaps in enforcement and regulatory oversight, making it difficult to trace the origin of goods and establish clear links to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the restrictions, some companies have continued to engage in trade indirectly, highlighting the lack of explicit legal prohibitions on transhipments through third countries. This has prompted calls for stronger legislative measures to address the gaps in Japan’s sanctions framework and enhance enforcement capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;energy-security-the-central-challenge&quot;&gt;Energy Security: The Central Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy has been a focal point in Japan’s approach to sanctions against Russia, highlighting the complex interplay between national security, international alignment and economic stability. Japan imports almost 90% of its energy. Limited domestic gas resources mean that Japan relies on imported liquified natural gas (LNG) for nearly all of its gas requirements, making it the second-largest global LNG buyer after China, with 8.8% of its LNG need coming from Russia. Japan’s reliance on Russian energy presents unique challenges in balancing its commitments to international sanctions regimes with the need to ensure uninterrupted energy supplies. This dependency is further amplified by Japan’s participation in the Sakhalin II project, a vital source of LNG for the Japanese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan has imposed an oil import ban as part of its sanctions against Russia, LNG imports have been excluded from these sanctions, reflecting Japan’s concern over energy security and the tight global LNG market. Participants noted that unlike countries such as the US, the UK, Australia and Canada, which have reduced their reliance on Russian LNG, Japan faces strategic challenges similar to the EU, given its higher dependency. Private sector participants from the energy industry justified this position by emphasising that restricting LNG imports would likely lead to significant price hikes and market volatility, further straining Japan’s economy and affecting global energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge is exacerbated by Russia’s strategic manipulation of energy exports. Representatives from the energy sector noted that under the currently tight global LNG market, limiting supply would drive up global prices, which would benefit Russia financially, even as volumes decline. Japan thus faces the dual challenge of supporting international sanctions while ensuring that its actions do not inadvertently strengthen Russia’s revenue streams through price inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mitigate its energy security risks, Japan has taken steps to diversify its energy portfolio. Efforts include increasing imports from other regions, such as Australia and the Middle East, and investing in renewable energy sources to reduce overall dependency on fossil fuels. However, a growing dependence on Middle Eastern oil, transported through the highly sensitive Hormuz Strait, exposes Japan to significant geopolitical risks. Any deterioration in relations with Iran, or instability in the region, could severely impact Japan’s energy supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these strategies will take time to implement and may not immediately offset Japan’s reliance on Russian energy. For the foreseeable future, Japan remains vulnerable to fluctuations in global energy markets and geopolitical risks. This dependence complicates its ability to fully align with sanctions regimes, as seen in the continued participation in Sakhalin II, which has been excluded from international sanctions regimes, including the recent US sanctions against Gazprombank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also highlighted the potential risks of future sanctions on China. As a major trading partner and key energy supplier, sanctions on China would pose significant economic challenges to Japan. This consideration further complicates Japan’s energy and sanctions policies, as it must navigate a complex web of international alliances and dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a G7 member, Japan is committed to implementing sanctions on Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, yet notable shortcomings exist in Japan’s ability to contribute fully to restricting the funding and resourcing of the Kremlin’s illegal war. To bolster its capacity, Japan should consider the following recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen legislative frameworks:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan should amend FEFTA to explicitly address circumvention tactics and transhipment through third countries. Establishing these provisions would clarify compliance obligations in the private sector and enhance enforcement capabilities by reducing reliance on interpretative measures. Legislative advances should integrate specific clauses to tackle opacity in beneficial ownership to aid in tracing and countering sanctions violations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance resources for enforcement agencies:&lt;/strong&gt; Key agencies such as METI should be supported by increasing its staffing and resources to strengthen oversight, enable more investigations and support compliance outreach. This would enable the development of specialised teams dedicated to monitoring high-risk trade flows, particularly in sectors such as automotive, machine tools and energy exports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target circumvention networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan should strengthen international cooperation to address sanctions circumvention, particularly in Southeast Asia. This includes focused outreach to high-risk countries in the region, where goods such as machine tools and precision motors are being re-exported to Russia. This approach should include enhancing intelligence-sharing mechanisms among G7 nations to identify and disrupt trade networks supporting sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote private sector awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; National authorities should continue to provide targeted guidance and educational programmes for industries at risk of sanctions violations, including car manufacturers, machine-tool exporters and precision instrument suppliers. This outreach should highlight the risks of US secondary sanctions and promote the adoption of robust internal compliance systems across Japanese companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address energy security while maintaining sanctions:&lt;/strong&gt; Japan should develop a long-term strategic plan to diversify energy imports, reducing reliance on Russian LNG. The government should collaborate with international partners to stabilise global LNG markets, mitigating price hikes and ensuring energy security without undermining the international sanctions regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s sanctions against Russia demonstrate its commitment to international security and alignment with G7 priorities, yet there is a sense that the country is “muddling through”, confronted as it is by a series of legislative and capacity shortcomings. Furthermore, the challenges posed by its prioritisation of energy security and the complexities of circumvention highlight the need for Japan to further its efforts. Strengthening legislative frameworks, enhancing enforcement capabilities and fostering international collaboration will be crucial in ensuring that Japan’s sanctions regime achieves its intended objectives while maintaining economic resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

Throughout a 20-year period, a corpus of reports has been delivered that outline standards of behaviour. Taken together, this is referred to as the “UN framework of responsible state behaviour” and includes an acceptance that international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace and a commitment to observe a set of norms (see Figure 1).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5AsUpfn.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: UN Norms of Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These international norms are generally considered the benchmark for the notion of “responsibility” in cyberspace, and one of the components of this “framework”. However, the UN framework is fraught for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It suffers from a narrow application. The UN framework relates principally to cyber issues that affect international peace and security. This sets a high-security threshold for what should be considered part of the responsible cyber agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UN framework focuses—almost exclusively—on the obligations of states under international law.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It largely applies to externalities as it directs how states ought to behave towards each other, and not to how states should act domestically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UN framework amplifies a perspective on responsible behaviour that’s been spearheaded by the earliest and most mature cyber nations, in particular the P5 members of the UN Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has resulted in a lopsided but dominant perspective on responsible cyber behaviour—one that overlooks states’ domestic responsibilities in terms of the use of cyberspace for domestic and internal security purposes; practices of good governance for cyber capabilities and operational controls; and one that has overlooked perspectives from developing and emerging economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-solution&quot;&gt;What’s the solution?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cyberspace has become a ubiquitous dimension of social, economic, political and military activities, there’s a need to expand the notion of responsibility in cyberspace. While this has become common language in national and international cybersecurity strategies and practices in Australia, Europe, the UK and the US, it’s less evidently articulated in most other parts of the world, including in most of the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report introduces a more comprehensive framework to explore the concept of responsible cyber behaviour and additionally offers perspectives from seven Indo-Pacific countries on what constitutes “responsible” cyber behaviour. The selected countries are less represented and examined in global and regional cyber policy conversations, in both Track 1 and Track 2 settings. These countries vary in size, economic development, systems of government and strategic outlook—and so provide much-needed validation and challenge to established thinking and norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insights presented in this report should provide policymakers, negotiators, civil society and researchers in the fields of cyber policy, cyber diplomacy and the non-proliferation of dual-use technologies with a better understanding of various national perspectives. In doing so, it will help to inform the scope of work for the next chapter of international cyber negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-framework-for-responsible-cyber-behaviour&quot;&gt;A framework for responsible cyber behaviour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UN framework for responsible state behaviour has set a crucial baseline for including the notion of “responsibility” into international cyber policy discussions and agreements. But, as mentioned, it’s presently lopsided in its focus. It may also no longer adequately reflect countries’ greatest concerns in relation to cyber matters. In the past decade alone, the cybersecurity threat landscape has changed radically. Phenomena such as ransomware, spyware and artificial‑intelligence (AI)‑enabled cyber intrusions jeopardise national security and regional stability, and it’s now recognised that most state‑sponsored cyber campaigns involve acts of intelligence‑gathering and espionage. Furthermore, more states are engaging with, and outsourcing to, criminal actors to secure economic and strategic advantage via cyber means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To account for these developments in the understanding of the notion of responsibility, we propose to look at three dimensions: national, operational, and international levels of responsibility. We provide coverage of “national dimensions” first in each instance to highlight expectations by each government of what it means to be a responsible actor in cyberspace. This is followed by consideration of the “operational dimension”—that is, how each government regulates the export and use of cyber and ICT capabilities—and finally the “international dimension”—that is, respective expectations of good international behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The national dimension assesses how countries “regulate” their cyber power by looking at the policies, legislation, regulations, guidelines and standards that governments apply at home, the institutions responsible use of cyberspace and with cyber‑related capabilities, as well as countries’ diplomatic engagement and their national positions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The operational dimension assesses how countries justify developing capacities and capabilities to act in cyberspace. Those considerations range from establishing institutions to combat cybercrime, to offensive or defensive cyber operations, and acquiring technologies to support domestic capacities to respond to incidents and emerging cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The international dimension assesses how countries perceive international legal and normative debates and efforts at international cooperation. It touches on statements and commitments in relation to “responsibility” in cyberspace, and further draws from memorandums of understanding, bi‑, tri‑ and multilateral agreements and other foreign relations arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dimensions can be applied universally, but, in this report, we apply them to analyse the state of play in seven Indo‑Pacific countries: Cambodia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan and Taiwan. All chapters follow a similar structure and are presented according to the three dimensions of responsible cyber behaviour—national, operational, and international. Each dimension is given different weightings in each profile, reflecting country‑specific cultural, economic and political settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All chapters rely on a mix of primary sources (official government documents, white papers, speeches, legislation) and secondary sources (media coverage, reports, research papers). The chapter authors are experts in their respective countries and mostly native speakers. That’s important, as it allows them to analyse various sources, including local media sources and interpret government documents. Inevitably, research limitations exist. Even with a greater diversity of sources, public information on many aspects of responsible cyber behaviour is scarce. Areas such as “operational responsibility” are particularly challenging due to the varying degrees of transparency with which countries disclose capabilities and report on public spending, export controls and the acquisition of dual‑use technologies. That lack of public data highlights gaps in research and public debate on responsible cyber behaviour. Each chapter identifies those gaps, offering valuable indicators for future research in the Indo‑Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-geopolitics-of-cyberspace-in-the-indopacific&quot;&gt;The geopolitics of cyberspace in the Indo‑Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand responsible cyber behaviour, we must consider the broader global and regional dynamics and how they shape how individual countries pursue their interests in cyberspace. In the Indo‑Pacific, this includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the geostrategic context of the region, where great‑power rivalry is intensifying&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;how geopolitical tensions and geo‑economic relations shape perceptions of risk and mitigation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;diverse levels of cyber maturity and enabling cybersecurity capabilities across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indo‑Pacific encompasses more than 40 countries, it is home to nearly half of the world’s population and generates approximately US$50 trillion in economic activity annually. The region is a stage for US–China strategic competition, as both powers advance their interests through diplomatic, economic, military and cyber means. In fact, the Indo‑Pacific is also home to some of the most sophisticated and persistent cyber threat actors, including state‑sponsored criminal actors and threats that are used for a range of ends—from cyber espionage to intellectual property theft, critical‑infrastructure disruption and financial crime. Cyber activities also enable regional conflicts and acts of foreign interference that are playing out across the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As threats evolve and countries build their capacities (sometimes in distinct ways), it’s crucial to understand how those countries internalise their obligations and commitments under international law and existing norms; which direction their cyber strategies take; and which justifications they have for developing cybersecurity capabilities within their security sector institutions. Analysing those elements is essential to forming a more comprehensive understanding of how responsible cyber behaviour is practised, despite the use of different terminology or diverging interpretations of “responsibility”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsible-cyber-behaviour-in-the-indopacific&quot;&gt;Responsible cyber behaviour in the Indo‑Pacific&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national perceptions and approaches to responsible cyber behaviour of the seven selected countries reflect the region’s historical, cultural, economic and political diversity, and contrast with those of the region’s major partners, such as the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, however, the following common observations relating to responsible cyber behaviour across the Indo‑Pacific can be made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsible cyber behaviour is not a generally recognised concept; even the commitments made on responsible state behaviour in the context of the UN remain ambiguous and ill‑understood and require more effort in terms of implementation. Also, the acceptance that international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace isn’t yet an embraced feature of domestic policy and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To date, responsible cyber behaviour is seen to deal with external threat actors—state and non‑state, including criminal groups—and their misbehaviour for reasons including the misuse of cyber and strategic technologies (Japan, Taiwan); engagement in criminal activities (Cambodia); ICT security (Fiji, Indonesia); violation of data sovereignty and personal data protection (India); and terrorist use of the internet (Pakistan). The fact that few countries explicitly reference UN norms in their national strategies casts doubt over whether states (and their respective government departments) consider or are aware of international commitments when establishing domestic cyber policies and practices. Internally, few countries have developed guidelines or mechanisms to prevent the use of ICT for malign purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most of the Indo‑Pacific stakeholders, responsible cyber behaviour starts with accepting—and reaffirming—the principle of state sovereignty in cyberspace. As a consequence, states are entitled to establish cyber functions within their security apparatuses for purposes of national security and defence, although there’s no expectation that they should do so. Secrecy around any of these capabilities and activities is considered acceptable, even when it’s recognised that this complicates oversight. In cases where regulations exist, enforcement remains inconsistent and ill‑resourced. Continued reports of misuse of cybertools by state agencies against domestic and foreign constituencies highlight this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Economic imperatives are often central to all policies, including on cybersecurity. Whereas the UN framework has concentrated on the impact of cyberspace on international peace and security, most Indo‑Pacific countries are predominantly concerned with socio‑economic development, digitalisation and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Given that most Indo‑Pacific countries lack sovereign cyber and digital capabilities, responsible cyber behaviour is about the opportunity to freely choose their strategic partners and seek investments, technical support and equipment, and capacity building that could strengthen the stability of the state, advance socio‑economic development, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, responsible cyber behaviour is a concept that allows countries to legitimately pursue and advocate for their own cyber priorities, such as combating cybercrime, seeking data sovereignty and securing affordable and reliable connectivity, and to expect recognition of those priorities by other states as well as multinational technology companies and their host‑nation jurisdictions. For India and Taiwan, their democratic predispositions fuel civil‑society efforts to limit cyber‑enabled surveillance. Fiji, which is vulnerable to natural disasters, views climate‑resilience cooperation as part of responsible behaviour, including in relation to digital cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsible cyber behaviour in the Indo‑Pacific may involve the recognition that it’s equally important to protect physical infrastructure as it is to protect and secure the information environment. At the moment, many Indo‑Pacific countries’ response to cyber‑enabled threats is to over‑regulate, introducing a slew of legislation and regulations that focus on criminalising certain behaviours. There’s also been an increase in their reliance on surveillance technologies, content controls and other restrictive policies on freedoms of information, speech and expression.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For most Indo‑Pacific stakeholders, responsible cyber behaviour is about the nurturing of expertise within government and non‑government (Track 2) sectors, and their (ease of) access to most relevant and impactful international platforms, such as the UN OEWG.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Responsible cyber behaviour may involve the need for guidelines for the purchase, selling and use of dual‑use technologies. Four of the seven countries reviewed—Fiji, Cambodia, Indonesia and Pakistan—lack such guidelines, do not have strong safeguards or haven’t clearly or publicly elaborated them. Meanwhile, India, Japan and Taiwan have specific controls in place and adhere to international frameworks such as the Wassenaar Arrangement. Japan’s guiding principle for weapons and military technology exports is to trade with friendly nations only; Taiwan maintains similar controls. The existence of that legislation and those regulations, however, may not be enough to effectively curtail the unwanted proliferation of dual‑use technologies. Parliamentary or public oversight of governments’ and industries’ compliance is currently lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when international discussions on security and collaboration in cyberspace are under pressure from deepening strategic competition, there’s a serious need to develop a deeper understanding of how other states understand what it means to be a responsible cyber actor. This report contributes to that conversation by presenting viewpoints from often under‑analysed state‑based perspectives across the Indo‑Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis shows that domestic and operational cyber policies, practices and capabilities lack the agreed standards, principles or norms that allow a notion of “responsibility” to be internalised. It’s unlikely that most Indo‑Pacific governments will exercise greater transparency and accountability in their own right, instead pointing to principles of state sovereignty (and non‑interference) and the need to first address capacity shortfalls. Nonetheless, the international community, Tracks 1 and 2, should advance the broadening of the notion of responsible cyber behaviour on the premise that it’s grounded in the existing UN framework. To better understand how states conceive of what it means to be a responsible actor in cyberspace, we must consider how governments and non‑government actors reconcile domestic interests and international commitments. From there, additional standards, principles and guidelines could be developed to address states’ internal and operational responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber‑enabled threats have emerged as a security concern in Cambodia, given increasing cyber attacks against Cambodian organisations and the proliferation of cyber‑scam compounds in the country. While Cambodia has laid legal and institutional foundations to defend its cyberspace, such as the Cybercrime Law and Cybersecurity Law, much of the responsibility for protecting systems is left to individual operators, and overall enforcement at the national level remains weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia’s focus on regime stability and sovereignty shapes its approach to responsible cyber behaviour. Domestically, the government aims to strengthen cybersecurity infrastructure, promote public and private awareness, and legislate against cybercrimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, Cambodia advocates for multilateral cooperation on cybersecurity, supporting capacity‑building initiatives so long as they’re done without political conditions. It prefers a collaborative approach in forums such as ASEAN and the UN, where it encourages the development of binding rules to limit the misuse of ICTs by state actors. Cambodia’s stance emphasises the importance of national sovereignty and mutual respect in cyberspace. However, challenges remain in fully aligning domestic actions with international positions. Cambodia struggles to balance its focus on regime security with human rights considerations, and its cybersecurity efforts are still evolving. Despite advocating for responsible behaviour globally, Cambodia faces internal inconsistencies in implementing those principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cambodian Government’s understanding of “responsibility” in cyberspace stems from its threat environment and constrained capacity to secure cyberspace. Cambodia remains vulnerable to transnational crime, and its security forces struggle to combat cyber‑enabled crimes. Transnational criminal organisations, for example, run online scam compounds using forced labour. In 2023, the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights reported that approximately 100,000 people were forced to work in such scam compounds. Cambodia also faces state‑sponsored cyberattacks, notably from Vietnam and China, which target Cambodian Government agencies and private entities. Faced with such challenges, Cambodia has, for the first time, included cyber defence as a priority in its 2022 National Defence Policy. This reflects the growth in threats emanating from cyberspace and a recognition that Cambodia needs to prepare to face those challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect for national sovereignty, which includes refraining from cyber operations that violate the sovereignty of other nations and engaging in capacity‑building efforts without political conditions, is a key message that Cambodia expresses internationally. The drivers of those views are deeply rooted in Cambodia’s historical experiences, political landscape and cultural values. Cambodia’s dark period under the Khmer Rouge and subsequent recovery have fostered a strong emphasis on sovereignty and national security. Politically, the government’s focus on maintaining peace and stability shapes its cybersecurity policies. Culturally, there’s a collective understanding of the importance of community protection and mutual respect, translating into expectations of responsible behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Cambodia’s views have been influenced and internalised through participation in international discussions and frameworks on cyber norms, particularly those advocated by the UN and ASEAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, the government signals its responsibility through efforts that improve cybersecurity standards in government and promote cybersecurity awareness among the private sector and individuals. The Cambodia ICT Masterplan 2020 emphasises developing robust legal and institutional frameworks to ensure cybersecurity. Meanwhile, the Cybercrime Law aims to combat cyber offences. The Cambodian Government has also engaged with industry to encourage responsible behaviour. The National Bank of Cambodia, for example, has specifically engaged with the banking sector through the Technology Risk Management Guidelines, which underscore the importance of ongoing risk management in identifying, assessing and responding to cyber risks. However, efforts to enforce those laws and guidelines are patchy, given constraints in financial and human resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use and acquisition of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia lacks specific laws or guidelines on the responsible use and acquisition of technologies. The Telecommunications Law of 2015 is the primary legislation addressing telecommunications and related activities in Cambodia. The law emphasises the safety and development of telecommunications infrastructure but falls short of detailing specific cybersecurity requirements for protecting data and network security. The lack of specific cybersecurity standards in these laws creates several constraints. Firstly, the lack of detailed regulations leaves government and private entities without clear guidelines for implementing robust cybersecurity measures. That is regulatory vacuum increases the risk of cyber threats and data breaches, as entities might not have standardised practices to follow. Secondly, the weak enforcement provisions mean that even the existing broad guidelines might not be effectively implemented, leading to inconsistent cybersecurity practices across different sectors. Finally, the general nature of these laws may inadvertently enable excessive surveillance and monitoring by authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement has procured and employed ICT tools for surveillance without clear regulatory restrictions. Cambodia has cooperated extensively with Chinese firms, which provide spyware, surveillance, and DNA screening equipment. Open‑source reports also indicate that Cambodian authorities have utilised spyware and surveillance technologies to monitor political dissidents, activists, and journalists. Associated procurement processes are opaque, with minimal public disclosure or oversight, further fuelling fears of abuse. Human rights organisations and international bodies have criticised Cambodia for using cyber‑enabled technologies to suppress dissent and infringe on privacy rights. This lack of regulatory transparency underscores the urgent need for stronger frameworks and increased transparency in technology acquisition and use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) and the General Commissariat of National Police under the Ministry of Interior are the primary agencies involved in cybersecurity operations. Since 2022, the MND and Royal Cambodian Armed Forces have built cyber‑defence capabilities to safeguard the military’s networks and critical national infrastructure. Initial efforts have focused on developing legal frameworks, organisational structures and interagency cooperation mechanisms to address cyber threats. There are no clear restrictions or constraints on what the government, the military, or law enforcement can and can’t do in cyberspace domestically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MND’s Cyber Warfare Unit operates under the directives of the MND, focusing on military cybersecurity policies and strategic defence against cyber threats. Similarly, the General Commissariat of National Police follows the procedural guidelines outlined by the Ministry of Interior, which include cybercrime prevention, investigation and collaboration with international law‑enforcement agencies. Those units also gather cyber intelligence and share information with national and international bodies. However, these cyber units’ auditing, reporting, and accountability mechanisms aren’t well ‑publicised, and their operations have limited transparency. While there might be internal oversight and reporting structures within the respective ministries, there’s a lack of publicly available information on formal auditing processes or external accountability measures. That lack of transparency underscores concerns about the potential misuse of power and the need for stronger governance frameworks to ensure that cybersecurity operations are conducted responsibly and ethically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cambodian Government supports the application of international law in cyberspace and adheres to the UN norms of responsible state behaviour. Even though it hasn’t published its interpretation, regional bodies such as ASEAN have been the closest to rehearsing and indicating what responsible state behaviour in cyberspace means for the region. That was the case for the statement provided by Cambodia, on behalf of ASEAN countries, at the UN OEWG, which noted that “ASEAN reaffirms the need to enhance cooperation to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible, and interoperable, and peaceful ICT environment and prevent the risk of misperception and miscalculation by developing trust and confidence.” Cambodia hasn’t elaborated on how it might seek international law to apply in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Cambodia wants to see the international community “develop rules, norms, principles within a framework of binding obligations”. Officials believe binding rules would help to constrain state actors’ potential misuse of ICTs against other states while encouraging cooperation under commonly agreed‑upon terms. For that reason, in 2019, Cambodia joined 12 other countries—including China, Russia and Venezuela—to advocate for the establishment of an international convention to combat cybercrime. The Cambodian Government believes that such a convention could strengthen international legal mechanisms to ensure that states behave responsibly in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A commitment to international cooperation, capacity building and respect for state sovereignty informs the government’s pursuit of good international behaviour. Fundamentally, Cambodia also insists that any support must be provided “without prejudice to the sovereignty of states, the confidentiality of national policies and plans, respect for partnership and human rights and freedom, as well as apolitical and non‑discriminatory [sic]”. This statement was probably in response to a perception that development support by donor countries privileges democratic countries over others. Few government documents explicitly reference the global framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cambodian Government demonstrates responsibility in cyberspace by participating in regional cooperation efforts. Cambodia has actively participated in initiatives such as the Singapore Cooperation Programme’s “Governing Cybersecurity: Policies, Practices, and Processes”, where officials from Southeast Asian states received training on cybersecurity policies based on Singapore’s experience. Additionally, Cambodia has been involved in technical cooperation projects to improve cyber resilience, such as the Project for Improvement of Cyber Resilience with Japan’s International Cooperation Agency and the Cambodia National Computer Incident Response Team Assessment funded by the International Telecommunication Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia’s approach also underscores the significance of regional solidarity and collective security in addressing cyber threats. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and Ministry of Interior affirmed Cambodia’s commitment to collaborate with ASEAN member states towards an open, inclusive, safe and secure cyberspace during the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity, Singapore International Cyber Week, and ASEAN Senior Officials Roundtable on Cybercrime, where discussions centred on building trust and security in the emerging digital order. Those cybersecurity forums allow Cambodia to learn from different nations’ best practices and share a local perspective that’s often under‑represented internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-1&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji, an archipelago with nearly 1 million people, has 95% of its population online. Cyber threats have emerged as a growing concern, especially in the light of major cyberattacks. For instance, in 2021, a cyberattack on the Fiji Government’s ICT services took systems offline for two weeks. The country’s vulnerability to the effects of climate change imposes further risks that telecommunications infrastructure can be threatened by natural disasters and rising sea levels. Fiji’s perception of responsible cyber behaviour is, thus, shaped by its limited cyber capacity, geographical vulnerability as a small island nation, and role as a regional hub for digital connectivity. As the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) host nation, Fiji played a key role in the 2018 Boe Declaration on Regional Security, which identified cybersecurity as a regional priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji views responsible cyber behaviour through the lens of cooperation. Internationally, it’s committed to adhering to global standards, sharing information on cyber threats and participating in cyber capacity‑building (CCB) initiatives. Fiji often seeks external support to strengthen its resilience against cyberattacks, recognising that its modest cyber workforce and infrastructure require ongoing development. Cooperation with more cyber‑mature countries is a cornerstone of Fiji’s strategy, together with its active participation in multilateral forums such as the UN and the PIF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, Fiji strives to build internal cybersecurity capacity by establishing institutions, laws and regulations, such as the Online Safety Act and the Online Safety Commission. Those initiatives highlight Fiji’s commitment to promoting responsible behaviour at the governmental and individual levels as part of a culture of online safety and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Fiji, responsible state behaviour means conforming to internationally agreed norms and ensuring that its cyber capabilities are used for defensive purposes, such as combating transnational crime. Fiji lacks offensive cyber capabilities and specific regulations for dual‑use technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions-1&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji’s structural factors, as outlined, drive a consistent approach to training, sustainability and national policy‑development partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerned about the impact of natural disasters on ICT infrastructure, Fiji joined other Pacific nations in the 2018 Boe Declaration to broaden the concept of security to include cybersecurity and a commitment to “maximising protections and opportunities for Pacific infrastructure and peoples in the digital age”. Fiji’s cybersecurity policies consistently underline the need for international cooperation to secure cyberspace and develop national capacities. The government participates in CCB activities, recognising its lack of resources—financial and human—to manage an active cybersecurity centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fiji Government and Fijian civil society further emphasise the need for climate‑resilient support in CCB. The Boe Declaration declared climate change the top security challenge for Pacific island states. In its 2022 submission to the UN OEWG on ICT, Fiji highlighted the importance of “climate‑resilient” cybersecurity infrastructure and called on international efforts to support that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, the government aims to be a responsible cyber actor by improving its cybersecurity capacity. Key legal foundations include the Criminal Act 2009, Online Safety Act 2018 and Cybercrime Act 2021. The Cybercrime Act addresses offences against computer systems and content‑related offences. Despite the Online Safety Act focusing on deterring offensive or harmful content—and thus being arguably “different” in scope from what had been agreed in the framework for responsible behaviour in cyberspace—one of its objectives is to “promote responsible online behaviour and online safety” and do so in tandem with promoting a safe online culture and environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration and the ministry responsible for communications initiated consultations to develop the National Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Incident Response and Recovery Framework and establish a Critical Infrastructure Computer Emergency Response Team (CI‑CERT) and national CERT. That same year, Fiji participated in regional workshops, such as the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre, to develop draft versions of the National Cybersecurity Incident Response and Recovery Framework. In 2024, Fiji and Australia signed a memorandum of understanding on cybersecurity to develop the national CERT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji has structured a strategic vision for domestic cybersecurity governance, drafting the National Security Strategy (NSS) in 2016, covering all aspects of national security, including critical‑infrastructure security and cybersecurity. Despite multiple revisions, the Cabinet hasn’t yet endorsed the NSS. In December 2023, the government committed to reviewing the NSS in 2024. However, no document has yet been published at the time of writing. Fiji is also undergoing a second Cyber Maturity Model review to inform the national cybersecurity strategy’s development. Despite recognising the need for a strategy, it remains a medium‑level priority on the political agenda. Essentially, private companies are responsible for managing their information security with little government assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those initiatives highlight Fiji’s view that responsible cyber behaviour intersects with international security, trade and economic development. However, cybersecurity and cybercrime remain challenging due to resource limitations and competing agendas. Support from neighbouring countries and non‑government organisations can help to prioritise and consolidate responsible cyber behaviour through institutional developments and policy updates. Notably, Fiji’s accession to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime signals a step towards legal harmonisation and enhanced cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions-1&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use and acquisition of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji lacks direct guidelines or regulations on the responsible use and acquisition of technologies, including controls for dual‑use exports. The central Fiji Procurement Office under the Ministry of Finance coordinates all government technology procurements, but public information on usage guidelines or restrictions is unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Fiji passed the Cybercrime Act, inspired by its ratification of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. The Act criminalises cyber‑enabled crimes such as unauthorised access to computer systems and interceptions of data. However, Fiji doesn’t mandate the reporting of cyber incidents. The banking and financial services sectors maintain the highest cybersecurity standards, as they’re prime targets for cyberattacks. In March 2023, the Reserve Bank of Fiji imposed minimum cybersecurity standards for those sectors through the Prudential Supervision Policy Statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All ICT network infrastructure in Fiji is owned by private companies (Telecom Fiji Limited and mobile operators Vodafone Fiji and Digicel Fiji), which aren’t required to adhere to government policies on acquiring technologies or equipment. For instance, unlike in many Western states, there are no regulations restricting the use of Chinese devices for both core network equipment and customers’ digital devices. Practical economic and developmental considerations drive the procurement of ICT equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji benefits from six submarine cables providing connectivity and emerging players that are expanding infrastructure projects. In 2023, Starlink received a licence to deliver broadband internet services, and, in 2024, Starlink services were expanded to more than 300 Fijian islands. The Deputy Prime Minister noted in the announcement that “licensing of Starlink for commercial use is a game changer for Fiji as it strengthens our resilience in providing connectivity during natural disasters—this also serves the purpose of the Fiji Government’s efforts in connecting the unconnected population.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji has no known offensive cyber capabilities and lacks guidelines for cyber operations. Cybertools are primarily used for countering transnational crime (such as drug trafficking, money laundering and terrorism). The Fiji Police Force has the primary power to intercept information online and for the enforcement of cybercrime legislation. The 2021 Cybercrime Act has provisions that allow the police to issue warrants for subscriber data and communications content. However, the procedure for lawful online interception by the Fiji Police isn’t publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific parliamentary unit tasked with the oversight of cybersecurity. However, the parliamentary standing committees on foreign affairs and defence, justice, law and human rights could function as platforms for parliamentarians to highlight issues in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions-1&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the then‑chair of the PIF, Fiji released a statement to the UN OEWG on ICT on 30 March 2022. It committed to the applicability of international law, the UN Charter, and the UN’s eleven norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. However, Fiji hasn’t detailed how international law specifically applies in cyberspace. Fiji’s support for international law and norms is likely to reflect its vulnerability to foreign cyberattacks. The global framework for responsible state behaviour encourages international cooperation to prevent the misuse of ICTs, supporting Fiji’s development needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji’s 2022 statement also emphasised critical information infrastructure security. It highlighted two key areas: the need to identify critical infrastructure in cyberspace and the unique contribution from Pacific island countries, which emphasised capacity building for climate‑resilient ICT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji’s government has been consistently active in its engagement with the UN OEWG process. That includes contributions to joint papers on CCB measures, a proposal for a UN Cyber Points of Contact Directory, and the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model as part of the assessment and development of national strategies. For example, the joint submission for the UN Cyber Points of Contact Directory sought to support communication checks and information‑sharing during cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji has long advocated for international CCB, primarily through regional efforts and bilateral agreements with Indo‑Pacific countries. Fiji’s foreign policy and international partnerships strongly connect its development and cybersecurity agendas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional cooperation has been key to advancing shared cybersecurity goals among Pacific island countries. The Boe Declaration’s action plan included supporting forum members’ accession to the Budapest Convention, developing national cybersecurity policies, providing education and training on responsible cyber behaviour, and strengthening CERTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Boe Declaration’s action plan explicitly mentions responsible cyber behaviour and has guided broader collaboration with Indo‑Pacific countries. They include the Partners in the Blue Pacific, a group composed of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the UK and the US. Set up in 2022 to economically support Pacific island nations, it has incorporated cybersecurity as an area for prospective collaboration. In 2023, it participated in the Pacific Cyber Capacity Building and Coordination Conference as a potential annual forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia and New Zealand play important roles in Fiji’s cybersecurity governance. In February 2024, Fiji established the Vuvale Partnership with Australia, which includes cybersecurity cooperation. That was followed by a cybersecurity memorandum of understanding in May 2024, focusing on critical infrastructure and CERT development and promoting international cyber norms. Similarly, the 2022 Duavata Partnership with New Zealand underscores cybersecurity and intelligence as priority areas of cooperation. Beyond bilateral and multilateral arrangements, the country is also part of technical cooperation networks such as the Pacific Cyber Security Operational Network (PaCSON), which is a regional network of cybersecurity experts in the Pacific dedicated to coordinating and supporting incident‑response activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fiji is also working to improve its capacity to combat cybercrime. In 2024, it acceded to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, aligning its domestic laws with international standards. That enables Fiji to enhance international cooperation in cybercrime investigations with other signatories and benefit from initiatives such as the GLACY+ project, which is a resource for technical assistance in fighting cross‑border cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;india&quot;&gt;India&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-2&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s perception of responsible cyber behaviour reflects the country’s view of digital technology as a key driver of economic growth and social development. However, India’s complex cyber threat landscape includes threats from cybercriminals, terrorist organisations and state actors involved in cyber espionage. That includes the use of cyber means to spread disinformation that risks social unrest, particularly on sensitive political and religious matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has no official document defining “responsible cyber behaviour”, but its policies and laws provide insights into its approach. Two dimensions shape India’s perspective. First, India stresses international cooperation and adherence to norms that prevent the misuse of ICTs for malign purposes. Given the transnational nature of cyber threats, Indian officials believe that collaboration between states is essential. Second, India defines responsible behaviour domestically by regulating irresponsible cyber activities, such as cyberterrorism and data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s top‑down approach to cybersecurity focuses on regulatory interventions in which the government plays a central role in guiding private‑sector and civil‑society efforts to protect cyberspace. That approach includes a broad mandate for public authorities, from enforcing punitive measures against noncompliance to conducting surveillance and offensive countermeasures against cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although India is still developing its doctrine on responsible technology use, key pillars are emerging in AI and drones, where privacy and ethical standards are key considerations. In the military domain, cyber‑linked technologies are used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and offensive countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, India advocates for states to refrain from cyber operations that violate norms, such as state‑sponsored cyberterrorism. As a leader of the Global South, India strongly supports CCB. It seeks to create mechanisms such as the UN Cyber Points of Contact Directory to strengthen cooperation and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions-2&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is the world’s second most “connected” country, with more than 800 million active internet users. The 2022 annual report by CERT‑In highlighted 1,180 cyber threat alerts and vulnerabilities—a 12% increase from 2021. Data breaches pose a major threat to Indian IT infrastructure, especially government servers. India has also been facing significant threats by foreign state and non‑state actors targeting its critical national‑security infrastructure. One example is the threat posed by Chinese cyber actors, which can be placed in the context of the larger, strategically competitive, relationship between India and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s perspectives on responsibility can be interpreted from its legislation and government documents. It lacks a unified national cybersecurity policy but relies on several laws to address cyber threats. The Information Technology Act 2000 defines responsible cyber behaviour by mandating “reasonable security practices” to protect sensitive data from unauthorised access and misuse. While the Act doesn’t explicitly refer to “responsible cyber behaviour”, it frames breaches of personal data as irresponsible, requiring strict legal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013, India introduced the National Cybersecurity Policy, which promotes cyber hygiene, user responsibility and secure information flows. The policy offers insights into India’s view of cyber responsibility. One objective is to foster a “culture of cybersecurity and privacy enabling responsible user behaviour”. That includes promoting cyber hygiene practices, cooperating with government actors to prevent and prosecute cybercrime, and establishing internal guidelines for secure information flow and crisis management in businesses. The policy encourages businesses to adopt internal security guidelines but has been criticised for imposing rigid requirements, such as the controversial six‑hour cyber incident reporting rule mandated by CERT‑In in 2022. Although intended to enhance security, the rule faced criticism for being unrealistic and having excessive data‑retention mandates. The 2013 policy isn’t binding, and many elements are too broad for targeted action. However, progress has been made on some strategies, such as operating the 24/7 National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre for reporting cybersecurity incidents and establishing a regulatory framework for critical information infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government also views responsible behaviour as ensuring content security, particularly in managing online hate speech and offensive material. The government uses articles 69A, 69B and 79A of the IT Act 2008 (amended) to block content on platforms such as Facebook (Meta) and Twitter (X) when necessary for national security and public order. In 2021, it introduced new intermediary guidelines to enforce technology companies’ cooperation with law enforcement. In February 2021, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology introduced the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, requiring tech companies to cooperate with law enforcement to track users spreading information against the national interest. Those measures aim to “institutionalise social media” as part of the government’s top‑down cyber and IT security approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s approach combines domestic cybersecurity governance and content regulation, highlighting its emphasis on national security. However, it faces criticism for impinging on free speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions-2&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a hub for ICT services, India governs the acquisition of cyber‑linked technologies through certain regulations targeting the private sector and civilians. The 2023 Telecommunications Act, for instance, requires telecom networks and service providers to comply with cybersecurity standards set by the central government or the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The Act mandates secure storage of traffic data and proper management of encryption. It also empowers the government to temporarily take control of telecom services or intercept communications if national security or foreign relations are threatened. The Telecom Regulatory Authority regularly updates the cybersecurity standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no ethics, privacy and cybersecurity guidelines on AI‑based technologies. Instead, AI regulations in India are currently focused on building capacity, developing an indigenous computer cluster and enabling research and innovation in the field. However, the 2023 India AI report, which lists the priorities of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology concerning AI, highlights the risk of generative AI in enabling cybercrime and lists 10 guidelines to build “responsible AI”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;responsible-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India has built institutional capacity for offensive cyber operations. In 2018, the Defence Cyber Agency (DCA) and the cyber groups for the Indian Armed Forces were established to empower the military’s cyber capabilities and conduct cyberwarfare. The DCA conducts those operations, which may involve network hacking, surveillance, data recovery and encrypted communication infiltration. The DCA collaborates with CERT‑In and the National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre, which track and report cybersecurity threats. However, the DCA’s activities, budget and operations remain undisclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Technical Research Organisation, reporting directly to the Prime Minister’s office, probably oversees offensive operations against cyber aggression, such as data breaches or attacks on critical infrastructure. Such acts of “aggression” may comprise breaches of sensitive data and uploads of critical national‑security information to the dark web, attacks on critical information infrastructure and cyberterrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestic surveillance operations are important to the Indian Government’s policy to address irresponsible cyber behaviour. Under section 69 of the IT Act 2008 (amended), the central and state governments can intercept, monitor or decrypt any information in a computer resource to protect “sovereignty, national security, friendly relations with international governments, [and] integrating public order”. India views responsible cyber behaviour and ICT use as activities that don’t undermine those priorities, authorising all levels of government to tackle threats through surveillance. The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre under the Ministry of Home Affairs also enables citizens to register as “unlawful content flaggers” to report online content for removal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although oversight mechanisms mandate regular reviews of surveillance operations, parliamentary requests often run up against the inherent secrecy of intelligence operations. The 2021 Pegasus spyware scandal, in which journalists, politicians and activists were surveilled, highlights enduring concerns about unchecked surveillance practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions-2&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While India supports the global framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, it hasn’t outlined a specific interpretation of how international law applies. One principle that India strongly champions is that state sovereignty and territorial integrity should extend to cyberspace. Officials have emphasised that a state aware of harmful cyber activities originating from, or routed through, its territory must take reasonable steps to stop them, reflecting India’s approach to quasi‑state actors (QSAs) conducting cross‑border cyber operations and the issue of state responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India prioritises countering cyber terrorism. Its contribution to the 2022 OEWG Annual progress report called for strengthened law‑enforcement cooperation to prevent cyberspace from being used for terrorist purposes. At the OEWG’s fifth substantive session in 2023, India highlighted the threat posed by QSAs and state‑sponsored cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been the target of state‑sponsored cyber operations, India has called on international partners to develop joint accountability mechanisms for QSAs’ irresponsible cyber behaviour. Examples include signing a memorandum of understanding between CERT‑In and its Japanese counterpart in 2015 for information‑sharing on cyber threats and vulnerabilities, and the US–India Cyber Relationship Framework, which enables cybersecurity‑related cooperation between law‑enforcement agencies in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From India’s perspective, multilateral regulation of QSAs’ activities and the formulation of clear norms of state responsibility for the cyber activities of QSAs operating within states’ territory are important legal principles. India has subsequently argued at the OEWG that “QSAs exploit a legal gap in our understanding that allows them some of the advantages of sovereignty without corresponding obligations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, India has pushed for seamless threat‑intelligence sharing by establishing a global Point of Contact Directory, wherein countries must assign a diplomatic and technical liaison during deliberations on specific cyber/ICT security areas. Beyond just threat‑intelligence sharing, this enables cyber‑related conflict de‑escalation through confidence‑building measures, such as establishing national points of contact. This proposal is part of India’s broader goal to enhance capacity‑building among its key national ICT security stakeholders, such as CERT‑In and the Telecom Cyber Security Incident Response Team. India’s push for a Global Cyber Security Cooperation Portal reflects its commitment to joint capacity building despite enduring constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India lacks a public cyber attribution policy. In response to incidents such as the ShadowPad malware attacks from China, India focuses on building resilience, investing in chief information security officers, formulating cyber crisis management plans, and monitoring threats through the National Cyber Coordination Centre. That reflects India’s reactive approach to cybersecurity, prioritising post‑incident responses over the proactive enforcement of responsible behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indian Government’s vision of itself as a leader of the Global South shapes its international cyber engagement. Amid deepening strategic competition between states, India seeks to project its desired leadership role by advocating CCB, especially for less cyber‑mature countries in the Global South. It has signed more than 30 cyber agreements with Global South countries, focusing on dialogue and technical training. Additionally, India exports indigenous technologies, such as the Unified Payment Interface and India Stack, to offer cost‑effective solutions to ICT‑related challenges in developing countries. Those efforts extend to regional organisations such as ASEAN and the IBSA (India, Brazil, South Africa) Dialogue Forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a lesser extent, India leverages the Quad partnership with Australia, Japan and the US to advance its cyber and technology interests. While the Quad promotes collaboration in cybersecurity, critical‑infrastructure protection and emerging technologies, India opposes using coordinated countermeasures or joint attribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its global ambitions, India’s top‑down, government‑led approach to cyber governance limits engagement with the private sector and civil society. India’s delegations at the OEWG have excluded private‑sector and civil‑society participation, and its cybersecurity regulations involve minimal consultation with businesses. Although India nominally supports “multistakeholderism”, it hasn’t signed the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, despite calls by several key Indian non‑government stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indonesia&quot;&gt;Indonesia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;gatra-priyandita&quot;&gt;Gatra Priyandita&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-3&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia perceives responsible behaviour in cyberspace as requiring countries to take three main actions: refrain from misusing cybertools to violate another country’s sovereignty; commit to international cooperation; and engage in CCB. That perspective stems from Indonesia’s view of cyberspace as a key vulnerability, and by its limited capacity to enforce laws and investigate cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, Indonesia advocates multilateral cooperation to impose legal and normative constraints on powerful states’ misuse of ICTs. It uses diplomacy to advocate for the peaceful use of ICTs, seek support for capacity‑building and ensure that sovereignty and multilateralism are upheld in international cyber norms. Its approach to international issues in cyberspace is shaped by its commitment to multilateralism, its status as a developing economy with growing cyber capacity, and its insistence on sovereignty as the foundation of international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it maintains legal and institutional instruments to respond to cyber threats, Indonesia’s capability is hampered by a lack of resources. It maintains cyber capabilities for defensive purposes, though there are insufficient checks to prevent the misuse of ICTs by authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions-3&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian Government recognises the transformative powers of digital technology but also acknowledges the risks emanating from cyberspace. The National Cyber and Crypto Agency (Badan Siber dan Sandi Negara, BSSN) reported more than 1 billion “traffic anomalies” in 2022, underscoring the country’s vulnerability to cyber threats, including ransomware and cyber terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s approach to cybersecurity crystalised throughout the 2010s. The BSSN, established in 2017 and empowered by a 2021 presidential mandate, is the primary agency responsible for developing, implementing and evaluating cybersecurity policies. Many other government agencies, including the National Police and the Ministry of Communication and Informatics, are also responsible for various aspects of law enforcement and cyber and information security policy formulation. Those agencies maintain international communication channels, which they may use to share information about cyber incidents and coordinate capacity‑building initiatives. BSSN collaborates with civil society and experts to monitor the cyber threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s legal framework requires organisations to secure their systems. The Personal Data Protection Bill mandates minimum cybersecurity standards, and noncompliance is punishable by fines and imprisonment. The bill was passed in October 2022 and is effective as of October 2024. Nonetheless, exactly how the law will be implemented remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, Indonesian officials recognise that international cooperation is another dimension of responsible cyber behaviour. The country’s international cyber engagements emphasise collaboration on CCB, information/intelligence sharing, and strengthening law‑enforcement networks. The government expects cyber‑mature countries to assist less‑developed countries in building the capacity to respond to challenges in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s submissions to the ASEAN Regional Forum express concerns that cyberspace is being “misused” by state actors in a manner that “poses risks to international peace and security as well as stability of national political, economic and social [sic] domain”. In response, Indonesia calls on states to “promote the use of ICTs for peaceful purposes”—in particular, with “respect for sovereignty, human rights, fundamental freedoms, as well as sustainable and digital development”. Indonesia has, through the UN OEWG process, called for the international community to pursue a “collective declaration of all states to refrain from militarisation of cyberspace that may undermine international peace and security”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions-3&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use and acquisition of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent the misuse of cyberspace, Indonesia has sought to demonstrate greater government control over ICTs through several legislative and regulatory instruments, particularly the 2008 Information and Electronic Transaction (ITE) Law. The law, along with its subsequent revisions (2016 and 2023) and other operational regulations, establishes the legal framework outlining the responsibilities of electronic service operators in Indonesia. Under the ITE Law, hacking and the private possession of hardware, software or other tools used to commit cybercrime are criminal offences. While no specific legal framework regulates the infection of IT systems with malware, under the ITE Law that action can be classified as system interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the BSSN, the Indonesian Government continuously publishes guidelines and organises practical awareness‑building exercises to build community readiness for cybersecurity incidents. The agency has also published standards and regulations concerning the security of ICT products. However, the BSSN’s capacity to review and audit the technologies used by the government is constrained by under‑resourcing, poor institutional communication about ICT use and limited human capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, Indonesia has no standing government policy on coordinated vulnerability disclosure. However, the Personal Data Protection Bill, strongly modelled on the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, requires organisations affected by data breaches to submit written notifications to the BSSN. While the BSSN and the National Police engage industry and experts to map the cyber threat environment and offer support, the absence of a disclosure requirement limits the government’s capacity to fully grapple with Indonesia’s cyber threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian Armed Forces (Tentara Nasional Indonesia, TNI) is responsible for cyber defence. In 2017, the TNI established a cyber unit (Satuan Siber, Satsiber) responsible for developing doctrine, policy and procedures to respond to cyber threats, particularly those targeting defence‑related critical infrastructure. Each branch of the armed services has subordinate cyber units under Satsiber, supported by the Cyber Defence Centre, which operates under the command of the Defence Intelligence Agency within the Ministry of Defence. Discussions are ongoing about creating a “cyber force”, although its shape and purpose haven’t yet been elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this force structure, Indonesia’s cyber defence lacks a formal doctrine. Internal military documents focus on organisational and resource matters, such as coordination, staffing and infrastructure, rather than specifying when and how cybertools should be deployed. Indonesia has no stated policy on offensive cyber operations. Consistent with its largely defensive strategic culture, Indonesia’s cyber capabilities are defensive and don’t serve a purpose beyond protecting national security, fighting cybercrime and cyberterrorism and addressing other domestic challenges. Diplomacy and multilateralism remain key to Indonesia’s approach to addressing external cyber threats. Although long‑term plans to establish offensive cyber capabilities exist, those capabilities haven’t yet materialised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to internal security challenges (particularly terrorism), the Indonesian security apparatus maintains well‑developed capabilities for domestic surveillance. There are publicly known cases of surveillance equipment being used against citizens for purposes other than national security. There’s no single rule for interception, and there are no known guidelines on what is and isn’t permissible. Rather, a series of ministerial and agency regulations provide certain individuals with the authority to conduct cyber‑enabled interceptions. For instance, police surveillance requires the approval of the head of the Criminal Investigation Agency of the National Police (Bareskrim). Those investigations must also, in principle, be based on serious considerations of privacy and human rights. However, existing policy documents don’t clarify the guardrails that would prevent misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions-3&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia endorses the global framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and has participated in the UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE). Indonesia has endorsed that international law, particularly the UN Charter, is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment. However, the government prefers separate legal arrangements regarding international laws governing cyberspace. Indonesia has specifically argued against the “automatic application of existing laws without examining the context and unique nature of activities in cyberspace” and suggested that “practical adjustment and possible new interpretations are needed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an October 2021 submission to the Ad Hoc Committee on Cybercrime, Indonesia emphasised the wide‑ranging implications of cybercrime. It called for a cybercrime treaty to be mindful of those implications and to reflect the principles of sovereign equality and non‑interference in states’ domestic affairs. It preferred that this treaty considers content‑related crimes, including disinformation and copyright infringement. Consistent with its preference for multilateralism, Indonesia prefers that the treaty promotes cooperation on cybercrime through information sharing and best‑practice exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia is particularly concerned about developing offensive cyber capabilities, fearing they could lead to the militarisation of cyberspace. Its 2015 Defence White Paper noted that “scientific and technological development” will make future wars more likely to be defined by “information superiority”, “cyber‑attacks”, and the misuse of technologies such as “genetic engineering, biotechnology, and nanotechnology”. Indonesia is particularly concerned about threats targeted at critical infrastructure, such as health and information facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of Indonesia’s leading role in the Non‑Aligned Movement and its embeddedness in ASEAN political culture, public attributions of ICT incidents to other states are unlikely. The government hasn’t politically attributed a cyber‑enabled attack to a state actor. The ITE Law includes provisions on extraterritorial jurisdiction but doesn’t address attribution issues or state‑to‑state activities. Rather, the focus is on encouraging more capacity‑building to help less cyber‑mature countries address cyber challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pursuing those goals, Indonesia has supported regional cooperation at the ASEAN level, especially in increasing human resource capacity to minimise the capability gap among ASEAN member states. Indonesia has bilateral memorandums of understanding on cyber cooperation with China, the UK, Australia, South Korea, the EU, the US and Russia. Those agreements, which involve the BSSN, cover multiple areas of cooperation, including CCB, establishing points of contact for incident handling, cooperation on cybercrime/cyberterrorism, and spreading radical online content. International cooperation and CCB are perceived as pathways to support Indonesia’s relatively weak capacity in responding to challenges in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia actively advocates for CCB and encourages collaboration with various domestic and international stakeholders. Furthermore, Indonesia has also advocated information‑sharing between states through institutionalised dialogues at the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core issue for Indonesia is combating terrorist organisations’ use of digital technology. Faced with challenges such as the spread of Islamic fundamentalism and hate crimes online, government documents highlight the threat of cyberspace being hijacked to “spread hatred and racial ideology”. Demonstrating its commitment to combating cyber terrorism, Indonesia signed up for the 2019 Christchurch Call initiative, which encouraged governments and online service providers to make voluntary commitments aimed at stopping terrorist and other violent content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the threat of terrorism, Indonesia is concerned about the use of cyberspace as an avenue for “disrupt[ing] public order”—a broad term that human rights activists have pointed out could be easily misused. In particular, the ITE Law is frequently weaponised by both authorities and members of the public; reports of defamation, religious blasphemy and disrupting social order frequently dominate cases of cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;japan&quot;&gt;Japan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-4&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s 2021 Cybersecurity Strategy highlights the importance of the rule of law in cyberspace, prioritising norms of responsible state behaviour. The strategy outlines measures to deter irresponsible cyber activities through coordination with allies and comprehensive responses across political, economic, technological, legal and diplomatic spheres. Japan also emphasises confidence‑building measures between states to prevent instability in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant part of Japan’s cyber strategy includes capacity‑building initiatives in the Indo‑Pacific, promoting responsible behaviour through public–private collaboration and international cooperation. Japan stresses the importance of multistakeholder engagement in establishing global norms in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan maintains strict constitutional norms, such as the secrecy of communications, and engages in extensive public–private consultations regarding cyberspace and regulating dual‑use technologies. Those legal norms, rooted in its postwar history, are an important tool of its soft power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government plays a central role in protecting critical infrastructure, investigating cyber incidents and regulating the export of dual‑use technologies. Japan’s commitment to international law and norms is reflected in its active participation in shaping global cyber norms through forums such as the UN GGE and OEWG. Japan’s focus on strengthening cybersecurity capabilities, enhancing international cooperation and fostering an open cyberspace reflects its ambition to be a model for responsible cyber behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions-4&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan seeks a free, fair and secure cyberspace to support economic development and a stable international order. Responsible behaviour in cyberspace involves protecting critical infrastructure, promoting public–private partnerships and fostering international cooperation. The government supports UN norms to promote stability and security. Japan also emphasises cooperation in cybercrime prevention and CCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan expects public and private entities to implement robust cybersecurity measures to protect ICT infrastructure from malicious actors. Private companies work with government agencies like the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in multistakeholder forums. That collaboration improves practical measures to counter cyber risks. The government aims to set an example by adhering to responsible behaviour norms and encouraging other nations to adopt similar practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;METI plays a key role in regulating technology that could be used for cyberattacks and collaborates with private companies on IT infrastructure security, training and data protection. It’s also one of the core government institutions that cooperates with private companies in strengthening the security of their IT infrastructure, training qualified personnel, building capacity and raising awareness about the required handling of data and protecting privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s Public Security Intelligence Agency (PSIA) publishes annual reports on cyberattacks and attribution. When cyberattacks involve foreign governments or actors, the PSIA coordinates with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence. Japan uses joint public attribution with partner countries to strengthen responsible behaviour in cyberspace. Those statements, published by the Foreign Ministry, are intended to serve as a disincentive for state actors to use cyberspace maliciously. Japan has recently become more active in joint public attributions, although it remains cautious, particularly with China and Russia. For example, Japan supported the US attribution of the 2017 WannaCry attack to North Korea but remains hesitant to attribute attacks involving China. Japan attributed only six in a 2023 comparative analysis of 164 official public political attribution cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions-4&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use and acquisition of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a major electronic equipment exporter, Japan has seen that role diminish, but a select group of Japanese IT and chip manufacturers remain competitive in global markets. Japan’s military and dual‑use technology exports began in 2015, guided by non‑proliferation treaties, including the International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards and the Wassenaar Arrangement for conventional weapons. It also participates in export‑control frameworks to regulate technologies with potential cybersurveillance applications. In December 2021, Japan began considering stricter domestic measures to regulate the sale of cybersurveillance technologies to countries that violate human rights, in response to the Biden administration’s announcement of a multilateral framework to regulate exports of surveillance technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To limit the export of technologies that can be used for cyber‑enabled attacks, Japanese export regulations cover a range of telecommunication equipment, including fibre‑optic cables and wireless communication wiretapping devices. Japan’s principle guiding weapons and military‑technology exports limits them to friendly countries. Every six months, it updates its End User List, which “provides exporters with referential information on foreign entities for which concern cannot be eliminated regarding involvement in activities such as the development of WMDs or other items”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government has also taken action to manage the expanded role of dual‑use technologies. In December 2022, it issued its revised National Security Strategy, National Defence Strategy and Defence Buildup Program. In the section on “Capabilities in the cyber domain”, the Defence Buildup Program sets out to enhance the cybersecurity capabilities of Japan’s Ministry of Defense and Japan’s Self‑Defense Forces. It will work more closely with critical infrastructure providers and the defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Japan has fallen behind in IT and cybersecurity. It’s placed 32nd out of 64 countries ranked in the 2023 International Institute for Management Development’s World Digital Competitiveness rankings—an index measuring how states adopt digital technologies. This is a drop from its 29th place in 2022 and its peak of 22nd in 2018. In the light of this and in an effort to bolster cybersecurity, the government is working to establish secure command‑and‑control capabilities in high‑priority equipment systems based on a “zero trust” concept. Japan’s Risk Management Framework, introduced in 2023 by the Ministry of Defense and the Self‑Defense Forces, emphasises continuous risk assessment for IT systems and cutting‑edge technology. Since 2015, METI has issued Cybersecurity Management Guidelines for private companies. The guidelines require companies to recognise and report cybersecurity risks and implement organisational cybersecurity measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, the US–Japan Economic Policy Consultative Committee published its Plan of Action to strengthen the rules‑based economic order, among other things, by better securing critical and emerging technologies and strengthening supply‑chain resilience. Central to the responsible use of cyberspace were efforts to impose export controls and cybersurveillance systems to counter their misuse by malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s 2022 Cybersecurity Strategy included plans to extend its active cyber‑defence capabilities, improve cyber situational awareness and human capital, and coordinate across ministries to respond to cyber threats. However, it isn’t very detailed regarding what technologies Japanese Government institutions intend to acquire to respond to hacking, surveillance or other invasive technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, Japan supported a White House statement to deepen cooperation to counter the proliferation and misuse of spyware. Soon after, METI published an interim report on its policy for revising the export‑control system, which included stronger advance reporting requirements for overseas dual‑use technology transfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operationally, responsible cyber behaviour involves proper authorisation for conducting cyber operations. In Japan, the core institutions that collect cyber intelligence are the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office and the PSIA, which cooperate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defense and the National Police Agency. Each body advises the Cabinet Intelligence Committee and the National Security Council. The PSIA contributes to cyber‑intelligence countermeasures, collecting and analysing HUMINT information. Japan has also taken other steps to enhance its operational capacity, such as joining NATO’s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that, Japan has yet to emerge as a leader in government or military cyber operations, both defensive and offensive. Although Japan’s 2018 and 2021 cybersecurity strategies mention “active cyber defence” (ACD), they lack detail. The 2022 National Security Strategy provides more specificity, calling for the “penetrat[ion] and neutralis[ation] of the servers of potential attackers”. However, beyond that, no concrete decisions on ACD activities have been finalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To strengthen the responsible use of cyberspace, Japan aims to be a model for other countries by ensuring that certain principles, such as data privacy or the secrecy of private communications, are still observed. The most important legal instruments in this regard are article 21 of the Japanese Constitution and article 4 of the Telecommunication Business Act, which guarantee the privacy of communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reconciling the twin imperatives of maintaining the highest standards of privacy and establishing an effective cyber defence hasn’t been easy. As of November 2024, the Japanese Diet was still debating whether the ACD mentioned in the 2022 National Security Strategy is constitutional. Some politicians and commentators have argued that Japan’s official adoption of ACD would be considered irresponsible. While other countries in the same situation would be more likely to argue that national‑security considerations trump domestic laws, Japan’s calculus is somewhat different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions-4&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan accepts the UN’s eleven norms of responsible state behaviour as guiding principles of state actions in cyberspace. It’s also committed to confidence‑building measures to increase transparency, predictability and mutual understanding in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2021, Japan issued its Basic Position of the Government of Japan on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, clarifying how international law applies to cyberspace, identifying violations and outlining tools for states affected by cyber operations. Japan also promotes the Data Free Flow with Trust principles under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‑Pacific Partnership and the Japan–US Digital Trade Agreement, advocating for the free flow of information, the rule of law, internet openness, autonomy from malicious control, and multistakeholder governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, Japan asserts that states must not violate another state’s sovereignty or intervene in domestic matters. Cyber operations causing physical damage or compromising functionality, especially against critical infrastructure, may constitute violations of sovereignty. Japan supports the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts principle, emphasising the need to attribute cyberattacks, hold states accountable, prevent recurrence and allow countermeasures against enabling states. Japan advocates for peaceful dispute resolution and opposes using force unless cyber operations constitute an armed attack under article 51 of the UN Charter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is active in cyber diplomacy through bilateral, regional and global exchanges and cyber‑focused dialogues. Its bilateral dialogues with partners such as the US, the UK and the EU focus on collaborations on regional and global cyber governance. Japan also regularly conducts exchanges and confidence‑building measures with India and ASEAN member states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan has had a few notable successes. Globally, it spearheaded the adoption of the Ise‑Shima G7 Principles and Actions on Cyber for responsible behaviour in cyberspace. Those principles call for closer cooperation between governments, businesses and non‑state actors to uphold rules and laws in cyberspace. Regionally, Japan has led the ASEAN–Japan Cybersecurity Capacity Building Centre, a Japanese partnership with Thailand’s Electronic Transactions Development Agency, which opened in Bangkok in 2018. The centre has trained hundreds of civil servants from ASEAN member states to make government IT systems more resilient against cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan also supports CCB initiatives through the Japan International Cooperation Agency and partnerships with European counterparts, combining cybersecurity training with broader economic and social development efforts. Addressing cybercrime and intellectual property theft is central to Japan’s agenda, and it argues that trust in the security of IT systems, data privacy and government oversight are crucial for fostering economic growth and innovation. To strengthen domestic political support for those cyber norms, Japan often argues that public trust in the security of information held on IT platforms, data privacy and government oversight of the integrity of IT systems is a core condition for reliance on ICT systems and greater future investment in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pakistan&quot;&gt;Pakistan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;rabia-akhtar&quot;&gt;Rabia Akhtar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-5&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s approach to responsible cyber behaviour combines efforts to create a resilient digital environment at home with a strong stance on global cyber governance. However, Pakistan faces credibility issues. While it promotes responsible behaviour globally, its domestic actions, including using advanced surveillance tools, have raised privacy concerns and accusations of government overreach. That inconsistency creates a gap between Pakistan’s international advocacy and its internal practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan seeks to establish itself as a responsible cyber actor by focusing on domestic security and advocating for the peaceful use of cyberspace. Domestically, the government has taken steps to build a secure and inclusive cyber environment, most notably through the National Cyber Security Policy of 2021. The policy aims to protect critical infrastructure, secure digital assets and safeguard daily activities such as banking and health care. However, despite the policy’s potential benefits, its implementation is hampered by limited resources and institutional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internationally, Pakistan views the internet as a shared global resource, similar to the oceans or outer space. It actively supports the global framework for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. It has advocated for a legally binding instrument to regulate cyber actions, including a ban on offensive cyberweapons, reflecting concerns about cyberspace becoming a domain of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions-5&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability mechanisms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, being a responsible state actor in cyberspace means securing its digital landscape and promoting peaceful internet use globally. It supports the UN‑led global framework on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and advocates for global cooperation to combat cyber threats and share intelligence and best practices. Pakistan recognises collaboration as crucial for building resilience against cyberattacks, especially given its limited cyber capabilities. Pakistan further emphasises equitable internet access, viewing it as a global common. Politically, protecting national sovereignty and critical infrastructure from cyber threats drives the agenda towards robust cybersecurity measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, the government encourages companies and individuals to meet basic cybersecurity standards. The National Cyber Security Policy 2021 mandates appointing chief information security officers and complying with national security standards. The government also encourages incident reporting to the National Cyber Emergency Response Team and prioritises digital literacy to promote safe online practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While progress is underway, Pakistan faces challenges in applying national cybersecurity standards and lacks accredited experts, leaving systems vulnerable to attacks. However, after cyber incidents targeting its ICT infrastructure, Pakistan’s Economic Coordination Committee approved a US$36 million investment to enhance technical capabilities in 2024. That followed the launch of the 2021 cybersecurity policy, which identified 11 cybersecurity risks and challenges, including phishing campaigns and for‑hire hacker services. The policy was the culmination of a series of government discussions and initiatives that were initially triggered by the 2013 Snowden revelations, which exposed the UK’s surveillance of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s cybersecurity policy explicitly states that cyberattacks on Pakistan’s critical infrastructure or critical information infrastructure are acts of aggression against national sovereignty. The policy reinforces the notion that other states are expected to behave responsibly. The policy also mandates that organisations in critical sectors adhere to national cybersecurity standards and appoint qualified cybersecurity professionals. The CERT Rules of 2023 further promote incident reporting, while the Cyber Patriot Program incentivises public involvement in identifying vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy further emphasises international cooperation to protect Pakistani citizens from cyberattacks. Pakistan recognises that cyber threats can emerge from poorly protected systems outside its borders. The policy emphasises cooperation with international law‑enforcement and cybersecurity organisations, sharing threat information, coordinating responses and taking proactive measures to protect its digital systems and citizens’ data from external threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions-5&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use and acquisition of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to acute internal security concerns, the Pakistan Government and some private entities have obtained various advanced surveillance tools. For example, since 2012, the Federal Investigation Agency has used advanced phone‑hacking tools from Cellebrite, an Israeli digital intelligence company, acquired through a third party in Singapore. Meanwhile, in 2015, several Pakistani contractors with alleged ties to state institutions attempted to procure a software suite from the Italian firm Hacking Team, which would allow for discreet monitoring of computers and mobile devices. There are no specific rules or transparency requirements for procuring and selling those technologies, raising concerns about the legitimacy of their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite those technological procurements, Pakistan still lacks comprehensive cybersecurity standards. The government has struggled to properly implement legislation and regulations on data security, supply‑chain security, vulnerability management and data‑breach reporting. That oversight leaves the country vulnerable to cyber threats and fails to allay ethical concerns regarding the use of surveillance technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, a closer look at Pakistan’s practices reveals a troubling pattern of irresponsibly using technology to monitor its own citizens. The lack of transparency and control over those powerful tools has led to overreach and potential violations of privacy. For instance, Human Rights Watch reports that non‑government organisations in Pakistan have faced intimidation, harassment and surveillance by government authorities, highlighting a misuse of surveillance technologies. Digital authoritarianism is also on the rise in Pakistan: one study has revealed that the government uses advanced surveillance technology and strict digital laws to monitor and control online activities. That control includes internet shutdowns, censorship and the targeting of dissidents. State agencies often collaborate with technology companies to enforce those measures under the guise of protecting national security and public order. However, activists and civil‑society groups do push back against those restrictions. Despite harassment and legal challenges, they continue to advocate publicly for protecting internet freedom in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Response Center for Cyber Crimes, a law enforcement agency under the Federal Investigation Agency, specialises in addressing cybercrime. Beyond that, understanding the operations of Pakistan’s national security, defence and intelligence agencies’ cyber units is challenging due to a lack of publicly accessible data. Pakistan doesn’t publicly disclose its offensive cyber capabilities, but the country does advocate for a prohibition on developing offensive cyberweapons. However, the Cyber Operations Tracker by the Council on Foreign Relations has recorded at least 13 reported cyber operations allegedly sponsored by Pakistan since 2020. Accusations have been made regarding the alleged involvement of Pakistan’s Inter‑Services Intelligence, the country’s principal intelligence agency, in supervising or supporting various hacking groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions-5&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan believes that established principles of non‑use of force, sovereign equality, peaceful dispute resolution and non‑interventionism apply to cyberspace. Officials have highlighted the grave risk of a “cyber arms race” and the potential unintended consequences of developing and using such technologies. In the light of this, Pakistan has called for an “outright ban on the development of offensive cyber weapons”, which could cause widespread disruption to critical infrastructure and have wider political ramifications. The country has also called for an inclusive and transparent dialogue to address the issue of cyber arms control and to establish norms and rules of behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging definitional challenges in the international law, Pakistan has stressed the need to more concretely define key terms such as “cyber attack” and “cyber terrorism”. It supports legally binding instruments to regulate state behaviour and promote the responsible use of digital technologies. It also supports international cooperation as necessary to develop an effective framework to promote responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan faces credibility issues in its stance on cyber norms. Domestically, it’s been criticised for using surveillance technologies to monitor its citizens under the guise of national security. Internationally, it promotes responsible behaviour in cyberspace, creating a contradiction between its actions at home and abroad. To resolve that, Pakistan must align its domestic practices with its international commitments, enhancing trust and reputation at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;foreign-policy-and-international-cooperation&quot;&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s foreign policy approach regarding cybersecurity seeks to ensure its continued influence in shaping global and regional initiatives. To that end, Pakistan engages internationally in various cyber‑related forums, including UN OEWG, the International Telecommunication Union and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. That approach also emphasises the need for trusted information exchange about cyber threats with public, intergovernmental and non‑governmental bodies, including liaison and coordination with national and international cybercrime agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of its advocacy against the proliferation of “offensive cyber weapons”, the Pakistan Government has also advocated bridging the digital divide between developed and developing countries. Pakistan believes that the internet is a precious “common heritage of mankind”, as are other global commons such as space and oceans—a reference explicitly outlined in its position on the applicability of international law in cyberspace. At its core, Pakistan envisions a world in which the benefits and opportunities of the internet are accessible to all, ensuring equitable distribution for the progress of humanity. That vision has informed its preference to see international cooperation for capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwan&quot;&gt;Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;yisuo-tzeng-and-louise-marie-hurel&quot;&gt;Yisuo Tzeng and Louise Marie Hurel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-6&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan doesn’t explicitly use the term “responsible cyber behaviour”. However, its perception of state responsibility is tightly interlinked with having the capacity to build economic and security resilience in the face of tensions with China. For Taiwan, the concept of responsible cyber behaviour encompasses three core (if implicit) elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;responsibility as the willingness to refrain from interfering in the domestic affairs of other states&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;responsibility as the domestic capacity to respond to and protect against such interference&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;responsibility as the commitment to maintaining a free and open internet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those views of responsibility take shape in the unique context of cross‑strait relations. The oscillating temperature of those relations has often meant that Taiwan must balance its approach in reactive and preventive ways across all three dimensions of responsible cyber behaviour: international, domestic and operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan has continually ramped up its domestic cybersecurity institutions, especially since 2016, when Tsai Ing‑wen assumed the presidency. Legislative efforts have also sought to establish clearer roles and responsibilities domestically for baseline cyber and data security measures. Political leadership and oversight on the use of cyber capabilities and ICTs by the military mean that their use is largely restricted to defensive purposes. Despite its non‑recognition at the UN and absence in different multilateral forums, Taiwan does adhere to the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;national-dimensions-6&quot;&gt;National dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Institutions and accountability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s view of responsible cyber behaviour is substantively informed by national security considerations, primarily due to ongoing cyber‑enabled threats from the People’s Republic of China. Taiwan’s government has upheld the cardinal principle that “cyber security is national security” since the publication of the 2017 National Cyber Security Program of Taiwan. That document outlined primarily what the government needs to do to improve cybersecurity to forestall foreign adversarial malign infiltration/influence. For instance, Taiwan deems it vital to protect critical information infrastructure from sabotage by hackers sponsored by the Chinese Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the mounting cyberattacks and influence operations from China, Taiwan’s 2018 Cyber Security Management Act established standards for the public and private sectors, requiring chief information security officers, cybersecurity training and incident‑response mechanisms. Noncompliance leads to penalties, reflecting Taiwan’s strong stance on cybersecurity accountability. The Act establishes baseline standards for public‑ and private‑sector accountability in cybersecurity. It designates the Executive Yuan as the competent authority stipulating “cyber security responsibility levels” for government and “specific non‑government agencies” (critical infrastructure providers, government‑owned enterprises and government‑endowed foundations). The Act also supports establishing a particular domestic understanding of responsibility through “negative measures”. The Act designates penalties for specific non‑governmental agencies that fail to comply with the regulation (that is, develop, amend or implement a cybersecurity maintenance plan, submit a report on implementation and improvement of a plan, establish an incident‑response mechanism and/or report a cybersecurity incident).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond national‑security concerns, Taiwan’s attitude to responsible cyber behaviour is also informed by public apprehensions over privacy—which, given concerns about espionage and insider threats, can be a fine balance. Taiwan maintains laws and regulations that monitor property rights infringements, child abuse, hate speech and disinformation. The legislation on personal data protection goes way back to the Personal Data Protection Act of 2015, which stipulates only the responsibility to protect personal data collected by necessary, appropriate means. That said, organisations responsible for personal data leaks bear the responsibility to cover the tangible and intangible losses and, in certain cases, can even face criminal prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disinformation campaigns, often linked to Chinese influence operations, are treated as national‑security threats in Taiwan. Espionage, cognitive warfare and subversion have become regular tactics used by China to destabilise Taiwan, influence public opinion and disrupt Taiwan’s relations with key allies such as the US. Taiwan’s legal amendments target disinformation for undermining social order and national security and demonstrate its approach to responsible cyber behaviour by criminalising harmful activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed expansion of Taiwan’s domestic intelligence apparatus sparked opposition concerns over political surveillance and fears of excessive government surveillance. In response, the government adopted a “patch management” approach, amending existing laws rather than drafting a new overarching cybersecurity act. Amendments to laws such as the Criminal Code and the National Security Act target those spreading disinformation or harming social order and national security. By criminalising harmful conduct and unauthorised data access, Taiwan primarily addresses individual and organisational actions rather than broader geopolitical issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;operational-dimensions-6&quot;&gt;Operational dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible use and acquisition of technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to its broader diplomatic isolation, Taiwan remains excluded from most multilateral organisations. However, it still adheres to many international norms and resolutions approved by the UN and multistakeholder agreements. In the cyber domain, Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and the newly established Ministry of Digital Affairs promote the growth of its cybersecurity industry while upholding non‑invasive, democratic, rules‑based frameworks such as the Wassenaar Arrangement. For example, acquisitions or exports of cyber‑related technologies must be checked against the Wassenaar control list of cyber‑intrusive tools. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Taiwan followed the US’s path by imposing export controls on chips, cybersecurity software and servers destined for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan also closely follows the US Bureau of Industry and Security regulatory list to align with the US’s decoupling and de‑risking from China. Taiwanese Government agencies, including the ministries of Justice and National Defense, call for the cybersecurity industry to avoid buying or selling banned Chinese surveillance technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Taiwan lacks specific regulations for supply‑chain cybersecurity, its public and private sectors closely follow the US Department of Defense’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) to safeguard the flow of controlled unclassified information. Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs, not the Ministry of National Defence, oversees efforts to implement CMMC certification, given historical sensitivities regarding military involvement in business affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Taiwan’s armed forces depend on the supply of US weapons, Taiwan has also cultivated a defence industrial base mostly composed of small to medium‑sized enterprises, including some cybersecurity capabilities. To encourage defence industrial base enterprises to further invest in improved cybersecurity, many seek to achieve CMMC certification and join the US defence industrial base supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Responsible cyber operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several government agencies, each with specific cyber operations capabilities, handle cyber threats. The Cyber Command (Information, Communications and Electronic Force Command), established in 2017, leads those efforts. Before its formation, Taiwan’s intelligence apparatus had already developed cyber operations units. The National Security Bureau leads the intelligence community with two cyber operations units and one for countering disinformation. The Military Intelligence Agency of the Ministry of Defense focuses on cyber espionage, while the Psychological Operations Platoon of the Political Warfare Department oversees influence campaigns and counters malign influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its inauguration, then President Tsai Ing‑wen emphasised the Cyber Command’s defensive nature, noting that its primary mission is to protect military ICT infrastructure and national critical information systems. However, Taiwan’s defence posture is evolving. The latest defence reports show a shift towards “defending forward”—a concept modelled after US and UK active cyber defence strategies. The 2023 Annual defense report acknowledged that cyber and electronic warfare tactics have become essential for modern battlefields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan faces significant challenges in recruiting and retaining cybersecurity talent, which hinders the growth of its military cyber capabilities. Efforts to collaborate with “white‑hat” hackers remain contentious due to trust and reliability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the counterintelligence and criminal investigation front, the Investigative Bureau of the Ministry of Justice and the National Policy Agency of the Ministry of Interior have long been experienced in digital crime investigations. Law enforcement requires a warrant for any cyber‑intrusive actions, and intelligence operations must follow clear orders and rules of engagement, ensuring legality and oversight in Taiwan’s cybersecurity efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-dimensions-6&quot;&gt;International dimensions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;International law and cyber norms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite challenges, the Taiwanese Government remains committed to the application of international law in cyberspace, although it hasn’t elaborated on how it applies. In particular, questions remain about how international law, specifically international humanitarian law, would apply in an armed conflict between Taiwan and China, given the contested views regarding Taiwan’s status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreign policy and international cooperation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Taiwan largely isolated from the institutions of global governance, the country has instead sought participation in alternative multistakeholder and technical forums. Those include the Asia Pacific Regional Internet Governance Forum (held in Taipei in 2024), the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and the Forum on Incident Response Teams. The Taiwan Internet Governance Forum has become iconic for connecting Taiwan to the global discourse on cyber governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, such experiences also speak to the core principles of Taiwan’s approach to cyber diplomacy: the commitment to a free, open internet—which equally underpins international initiatives such as the UN Global Digital Compact and the Freedom Online Coalition. Demonstrating Taiwan’s commitment to that principle—and rejecting those that don’t commit—Taiwanese MP Audrey Tang (now Digital Affairs Minister) delivered a tele‑speech at the UN Internet Governance Forum in 2017 to break through China’s attempts to block Taiwan’s participation in international forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International cooperation can be framed in different ways. In 2023, lawmakers in the US introduced the Taiwan Cybersecurity Resiliency Act, “which would require the US Department of Defense to expand cybersecurity cooperation with Taiwan to help it counter cyber threats from China”. Other types of cooperation have included joint cyber exercises. That was the case, for example, for a Taiwan–US cybersecurity offensive and defensive exercise led by the Department of Cyber Security of the Executive Yuan.&lt;/p&gt;

In practice, however, intelligence sharing is beset with difficulties, including limited trust, poor bureaucratic procedures, and under-resourcing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence sharing is vital to America’s security. Through it, the United States has gained information about security threats, identified opportunities to counter them, and provided similar benefits to allies—all at a relatively low cost. In addition, intelligence sharing has helped the United States and its allies form closer relationships overall, improving military, economic, and diplomatic ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite many joint collection and assessment successes, intelligence sharing sometimes fails to live up to its promise. As Sean Corbett and James Danoy—former senior British and U.S. intelligence officials, respectively—have written, “With few exceptions, and despite the best of intentions, intelligence sharing is uneven, remains the exception rather than the norm, and the prospect of simultaneity at the point of need is remote.” Because of its secretive nature, intelligence sharing generates fewer headlines and open complaints than other forms of cooperation; but in behind-the-scenes discussions with U.S. and allied officials and experts, frustration has been as common as praise. Although intelligence sharing has bolstered overall relations in many cases, systems of sharing frequently lack the bureaucratic foundations needed to enable smooth relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of sharing failures, though hard to measure, can be felt in several pernicious ways. Allies and partners may be slow to realize dangers posed by revisionist powers such as China, Russia, and Iran. Advanced planning based on varied intelligence assessments can hinder cooperation in a crisis. An ineffective division of labor may cause collection and analysis to suffer from both gaps and overlap. Intelligence sharing can bolster overall diplomacy between allies; without it, an important pillar of that relationship is weakened. But intelligence sharing problems may prove especially costly in an era of renewed great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been many instances in which intelligence sharing has produced impressive successes. The “Five Eyes” (FVEY) partnership—a longstanding intelligence sharing arrangement between the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Britain, and New Zealand—has resulted in improved collection, better analysis, and greater burden sharing for its members. Outside of this longstanding partnership, the United States and its allies successfully expanded intelligence sharing after 9/11 and after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, suggesting that barriers can be overcome in moments of crisis. Even so, significant intelligence sharing can be slow, as well as incomplete in its scope and scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although allies and partners share the blame, the United States often makes it harder for well-meaning allies to cooperate with its intelligence services. This essay contends that U.S. intelligence sharing suffers in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trust problems, often originating outside of intelligence circles and ranging from perceived interest differences to fears that the United States will use intelligence to manipulate decisionmaking&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diplomatic and political costs to allies and partners should their relationship with U.S. intelligence become public&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A U.S. release system that emphasizes security over sharing, which often results in complex procedures and a default to Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN) even when the information does not involve highly sensitive sources and methods&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Difficulties in interfacing with allied services for resource, bureaucratic, and technical reasons&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unclear prioritization, which results in insufficient incentives for mission-driven sharing&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An under-resourced bureaucratic system that at times undervalues intelligence sharing, allows different agencies to apply different standards, defaults to NOFORN, and imposes harsh penalties on individual officers for potential mistakes, creating strong incentives against sharing&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remedy these problems, the United States should take the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve prioritization of intelligence sharing with key allies and encourage those allies to improve their technical systems and overall intelligence resourcing&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Relax some security requirements with allies and help them improve their own procedures, recognizing that intelligence sharing must be mission-driven and that security violations are likely as allies make these improvements&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Alter U.S. procedures so that NOFORN is used less frequently with non-Five Eyes allies, thus enhancing mission effectiveness&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Share more information in low-risk areas—such as climate security—in order to develop procedures and trust for higher-risk cooperation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dedicate more resources and personnel to increase the speed and scale of intelligence sharing within existing agencies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expand high-level sharing beyond the Five Eyes partnership on a finite set of issues (approved at the policy level), with particular emphasis on important partnerships in Asia (e.g., South Korea and Japan) and Europe (e.g., Germany and Poland)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In drawing these findings and making these recommendations, this report examines a range of academic, think tank, and government writings on intelligence. In addition, over 35 interviews were held with current and former U.S. and allied security experts, diplomats, and intelligence officials of varying ranks and seniority. Given the nature of the subject, the interviews were conducted off the record. No questions on collection, sources, methods, or other sensitive areas were asked or discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report consists of four sections. The first describes the importance of intelligence sharing for U.S. security. The second section describes current models of intelligence sharing, such as bilateral cooperation and the Five Eyes arrangement. The third section details a range of problems that plague current intelligence sharing efforts, using examples primarily from five countries: Australia, Japan, Poland, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. Drawing on this analysis, the essay’s fourth section offers recommendations for improving intelligence sharing and notes factors that are unlikely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-01-the-importance-of-intelligence-sharing&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 01 The Importance of Intelligence Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing intelligence with the right partners offers many potential benefits. No intelligence service knows everything, and even small nations have valuable human sources or other assets in their own neighborhoods. As a former head of the UK Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) put it, intelligence is “a team sport.” As scholar Jennifer Sims points out, intelligence liaison can lower overall collection costs, improve timeliness, and facilitate effective joint operations. Intelligence partners may also have advantages in language skills (a particular U.S. weakness), historical relationships, and access. Estonia, for example, has a superb service with many Russian speakers and a longtime Russian focus. Some allies have an official presence in places like Iran and North Korea, where direct U.S. access is limited to nonexistent. Allied access is also vital in places like China, where any American—especially an American official—is constantly monitored. Some intelligence services, such as those of the United Kingdom, have global reach. In addition, access and capabilities can take years to build, so it is often vital to draw on partners with preexisting assets in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counterterrorism era yielded numerous instances of successful intelligence sharing that made the United States and its partners safer. Allies generated intelligence and often served as the tip of the spear, arresting or otherwise disrupting suspected terrorists. The capture of terrorists such as David Headley and Najibullah Zazi relied heavily on British intelligence, and Saudi Arabia played an important role in preventing terrorist attacks from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence sharing is also vital for effective coalition military operations. U.S. military campaigns against the Islamic State and Al Qaeda have demonstrated the value of such sharing for counterterrorism purposes. The U.S.-Poland ballistic missile defense agreement, for example, requires intelligence cooperation to ensure the security of U.S. installations, launchers, and technical data. Similarly, the United States and South Korea share intelligence on space as part of a broader effort that includes training and exercises. Beyond tactical sharing of battlefield information, intelligence exchanges also facilitate joint planning. As one European official put it, “All plans depend on intelligence. Bad intelligence means bad plans.” U.S. deployments related to Russia and China often depend on effective intelligence relationships with regional states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such relationships can also bolster overall diplomacy and alliance strength. One former allied official noted that U.S. assessments shaped their own country’s worldview in dozens of small ways that, over time, brought the two into greater alignment. Intelligence relationships facilitate trust that can be useful for negotiations on more traditional foreign policy issues such as peace talks between belligerents. Polish officials noted in interviews that intelligence cooperation was an important part of their country’s overall relationship with the United States. Over time, shared intelligence also contributes to a shared worldview and set of threat perceptions. As former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld once noted, “To the extent we are all working off the same set of facts, or roughly the same set of facts, the people from our respective countries tend to come to roughly the same conclusions, and to the extent we’re not working off the same set of facts, we tend not to.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;great-power-competition-and-intelligence-sharing&quot;&gt;Great Power Competition and Intelligence Sharing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 9/11 attacks led to a massive change in intelligence liaison, with terrorism-related intelligence coming to the fore. Attention focused on improving liaison with countries that had a jihadist presence or were otherwise on the front line of the struggle against terrorism. In contrast to the Soviet Union in the Cold War–era, Al Qaeda, the Islamic State, and other jihadist movements had little in the way of sophisticated counterintelligence: Information might be revealed to an adversary through leaks, but the odds of an Al Qaeda penetration of U.S. or other allied services were low. Jihadist signals intelligence (SIGINT) collection was also limited, especially when compared to great power adversaries’ capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great power competition, however, poses a new set of intelligence challenges. Multiple U.S. administrations have tried, not always successfully, to reduce focus on the greater Middle East. As in the Cold War, Russia has been an area of increased emphasis, with allies in Europe posed to play a critical role in confronting Moscow. Strong bilateral relationships, robust alliance structures like NATO, and other arrangements that involve intelligence—many of which were developed during the Cold War—will serve the United States well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China, however, is a far bigger long-term concern, and one that Cold War structures will not meet. Many European allies and partners have shared intelligence with the United States and each other for decades. East Asian allies and partners, in contrast, have limited collection capabilities; they have not had robust sharing relationships with the United States for long periods of time and share even less intelligence among themselves. Asian allies also have complicated relationships with China, given its economic importance and its increasingly dominant position regionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security risks are also much greater than they were in the post-9/11 era. China and Russia both have effective intelligence and counterintelligence services. They guard their information more effectively than the post-9/11 jihadist movements did, which creates a need for more sophisticated collection efforts. In addition, they are aggressively trying to penetrate U.S. services, as well as those of U.S. allies and partners. As a result, the risk of U.S. information ending up in adversaries’ hands is much greater now than in the era when counterterrorism was the priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-turning-point-for-intelligence-cooperation&quot;&gt;A Turning Point for Intelligence Cooperation?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the start of the Cold War and the events of 9/11 led to significant intelligence liaison changes, recent international turmoil and changing U.S. priorities offer opportunities for the restructuring and improvement of intelligence sharing. The Ukraine war has highlighted the Russian threat, energizing European states and increasing their day-to-day security cooperation with both the United States and one another. In Asia, the rise of China has alarmed states as diverse as Australia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan, creating the potential for greater cooperation against a shared threat. The signing of the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) agreement in 2021 is one sign of how regional relationships are being reordered and institutionalized. However, as one official involved in AUKUS noted, even as arms sales and defense cooperation have improved dramatically, “intelligence has not kept pace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-scale-of-intelligence-sharing-and-us-commitment&quot;&gt;The Scale of Intelligence Sharing and U.S. Commitment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this paper focuses primarily on ways to bolster intelligence sharing, it is important to acknowledge the considerable and usually fruitful sharing that already exists with partners. The United States regularly engages with numerous civilian and military partners abroad, sharing finished human, signals, geospatial, and other intelligence on a daily basis. This sharing often increases in response to crises, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, or to growing threats, such as Iran’s malign adventurism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intelligence community is aware of the depth of the challenge. Within the U.S. system, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) were created to overcome internal stovepiping, while combatant commands have created fusion cells with partners to ensure information flows during war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence community members often have a strong understanding of partner needs. Country teams focus on how to manage liaison relationships, a process augmented by liaison visits and analytic exchanges. Senior officials regularly discuss what to share and what not to share, making decisions based on their own impressive backgrounds in the countries and issues in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this paper focuses on ways to improve sharing, interview questions often zeroed in on problems. However, the vast majority of the interviewees stressed the value of U.S. intelligence sharing and noted that many officials were highly committed to a strong relationship between the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-02-intelligence-sharing-structures&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 02 Intelligence Sharing Structures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence scholar H. Bradford Westerfield notes that the particulars of intelligence liaison vary considerably and can include sharing information, working together on operations, and full-fledged joint collection. Liaison may also involve training, financial support, and providing technical or other supplies. Sometimes arrangements are institutionalized via a memorandum of understanding or similar means; sometimes they are informal. At times agencies exchange finished assessments; but one former intelligence official interviewed stressed the value of sharing raw intelligence, which enables agencies to “check each other’s homework” and even source knowledge. In other cases, sharing may involve requests for political support, military equipment, or other non-intelligence benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bilateral-structures&quot;&gt;Bilateral Structures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bilateral cooperation is usually the preferred form of intelligence liaison. This is primarily for security reasons, though it also proves convenient at times for two countries to unite on a particular issue of mutual concern. The more widely information is disseminated, the more likely it is to be revealed through spying, media leaks, or other unauthorized disclosures. Historically, many U.S. intelligence engagements in Asia have been bilateral. The United States has long had strong relations with Japan and South Korea, but information has largely been shared directly, rather than as part of a larger grouping. For example, the United States gives South Korea the critical signals intelligence it lacks, while South Korea provides human intelligence in exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multilateral-structures&quot;&gt;Multilateral Structures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has multilateral exchanges via alliances such as NATO. Similarly, Europe has arrangements like the Berne Group for sharing intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some U.S. multilateral sharing relations are stunted due to limited trust in allied security systems and procedures, fears of adversary penetration, or concerns that allies’ different interests might lead them to disclose information to adversaries. Often these arrangements facilitate the exchange of overly broad reports that do not offer detailed intelligence, for fear of information being compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, because of information security concerns, larger circles tend to lead to weaker cooperation. As Sims contends, “The quality of the exchange will generally be determined by the least trusted (most suspect) member of the group.” As a result, multilateral liaison often leads nowhere, with members fearing that the weak security of one participant will compromise the entire group. This is particularly true of more sensitive collection and sourcing discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-five-eyes&quot;&gt;The Five Eyes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, impressive exceptions to the general dominance of the bilateral sharing model. The Five Eyes alliance, which grew out of the U.S.-UK World War II partnership and has been around for over 70 years, is often held up as the gold standard for intelligence sharing. As scholars have noted, the Five Eyes “is unique in the combination of its longevity, its resilience to changing global circumstances, and its ability to survive periodic tensions as well as maintain an ongoing similarity in the worldviews of its membership.” The countries involved share intelligence related to foreign communications and methods of collection. They also share finished intelligence products. A senior British intelligence official pointed out that the U.S.-UK SIGINT relationship is so strong that “customers in both capitals seldom know which country generated either the access or the product itself.” Although the historical emphasis on signals intelligence remains important today, Five Eyes members also share assessments, as well as procedures and terms for classifying information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes alliance has achieved these successes for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes countries share values, interests, and language; longstanding institutionalization has further strengthened bonds. The United Kingdom helped establish U.S. and other allied intelligence organizations during and after World War II, often using British models, and this shared foundation has made later cooperation easier.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The division of labor is meaningful among Five Eyes members, with different countries having responsibility for different parts of the world. For example, according to intelligence historian Corey Pfluke, Australia monitors South and East Asian communication, while New Zealand covers the South Pacific and Southeast Asia. An Australian Department of Defense study found that “the US looks to Australia for all SIGINT in our region of principal coverage and does not duplicate the effort,” citing Islamic extremism as an example. Partners respond to each other’s needs when they do not have their own reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes share exchange liaison officers, do joint operations, have joint communication channels, and jointly staff many important facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Five Eyes can “follow the sun,” passing off a task from one partner to another for around-the-clock operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over time, the Five Eyes’ shared activities, personnel swaps, and institutionalization have generated personal relationships, which in turn have led to greater trust among institutions, understanding of different systems, and opportunities for bureaucratic work arounds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five Eyes nations have reportedly agreed not to spy on one another. This “no-spy” pact further bolsters confidence that intelligence officers from Five Eyes countries are there to help with common problems, not to secretly collect intelligence of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Five Eyes nations respect each other’s areas of influence. For instance, one U.S. official noted that a decision in Indonesia would never be made without input from Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, however, that the Five Eyes relationship has endured many problems over the years. During World War II, the United Kingdom had security concerns about passing analysis to the United States. Simultaneously, both the United States and the United Kingdom had concerns about sharing SIGINT with Australia due to lax security procedures there. As a result, they restricted access, excluding much of Australia’s cabinet. Political differences also shaped the early relationship. London did not circulate Joint Intelligence Committee papers on Palestine during partition because of perceived “Jewish sympathies” in Washington. Over the years, all five countries have had serious security lapses that have compromised sources. Such lapses have included the “Cambridge Five” in the United Kingdom, Aldrich Ames and Ana Montes in the United States, the Soviet mole Ian George Peacock in Australia, a 2021 Chinese cyberattack that infiltrated New Zealand government systems, and the connections of numerous Canadian politicians to Chinese intelligence officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative importance of some Five Eyes members may shift with the rise of China. One expert noted that concerns about China have already “turbocharged” the Five Eyes, with Australia in particular playing an unprecedented role. New Zealand, a less important player in the Cold War and post–Cold War eras, given its distance from the Soviet Union, is now situated to be an important intelligence partner in the South Pacific, Antarctica, and various parts of Asia, although resources remain an issue for Wellington. Conversely, Canada’s importance may decrease relative to that of other members given its distance from Asia. As existing relations change, more complaints are likely. With new priorities and additional points of contact emerging, new points of friction will arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-sharing-arrangements&quot;&gt;Other Sharing Arrangements&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Five Eyes, press reporting indicates that the United States has other circles of information sharing. The so-called “Nine Eyes” partnership includes Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and Norway, in addition to the Five Eyes countries. The “Fourteen Eyes” adds Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden. These relationships, however, are not as institutionalized as the Five Eyes. The United States also recently organized the Framework Intelligence Group to facilitate the release of Secret-level information to 14 member states: the Five Eyes, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, and Spain. Many instances of multilateral sharing are ad hoc and occur during crises. U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) shared information related to Iranian ballistic missiles in order to help Israel defeat Iran’s attacks in April and October 2024. The United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Jordan all provided capabilities to assist Israeli air defense, which in turn required intelligence sharing among these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has also tried to foster intelligence relationships among and between its partners. Historically, Japan and South Korea have each had bilateral intelligence relationships with the United States, with any information relevant to the other shared only via transmission through Washington. In 2016, the two Asian countries agreed to the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), allowing them to share intelligence on North Korean military and nuclear activities with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies often have important relationships of their own. Taiwan and Japan have long had a strong bilateral intelligence relationship. Similarly, although the United Kingdom’s military capacity has declined, it maintains a strong intelligence capacity, which it uses in bilateral relationships to advance its interests. Five Eyes partners also have their own liaison partners: Canada and Australia, for example, each have relationships with over 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-03-common-intelligence-cooperation-problems&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 03 Common Intelligence Cooperation Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies and partners suffer from numerous problems in intelligence relationships. Some of these are structural, involving different interests and cultures, and are difficult or impossible to overcome. Still other problems—notably those regarding security procedures—involve tradeoffs, with greater sharing leading to higher chances of valuable human sources and sophisticated and expensive technical methods being lost. In other cases, however, the problems are own goals, with procedural or bureaucratic issues causing numerous complications. These issues, detailed below, can be grouped into five categories: trust concerns, autonomy concerns, security barriers, incompatible interfaces, and bureaucratic barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section expands upon those problems and tensions, using the experiences of Australia, Japan, Poland, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. These countries were chosen for several reasons. Two of them—Australia and the United Kingdom—are long-standing Five Eyes partners. The issues they experience suggest how problems can endure even within the closest intelligence relationships. Japan and South Korea also have a close relationship, but one in which intelligence sharing is less institutionalized, even as the threat of China grows. Finally, Poland is a relatively new ally, but its intelligence importance has increased considerably as the United States has renewed its attention on the Russian security threat. Many of these countries have significant problems of their own that raise legitimate complications for intelligence sharing, but this paper focuses primarily on issues that affect how the United States might improve sharing on its end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obstacle-1-trust-concerns&quot;&gt;Obstacle 1: Trust Concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While even close allies often have trouble fully trusting one another, the issue of trust is more significant between countries with histories of animosity. Common problems in this area include general mistrust due to different histories and perceived interests; concerns about U.S. arrogance and potential to use intelligence to manipulate; and concerns that the United States will spy on the partner country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;General Mistrust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies have their own interests, and even when these interests align with the United States’, they are rarely identical. One former allied official put it succinctly: “Alliance is not allegiance.” Henry Kissinger also once touched upon this point, remarking that “there is no such thing as friendly intelligence agencies. There are only the intelligence agencies of friendly powers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one Asian government official noted wryly, “Few countries are so unmolested by thoughts of history as the United States.” U.S. dignitaries, the official noted, often say, “That was so long ago,” or “But now we have shared interests.” Yet this rhetoric is not enough to underpin alliances. Radek Sikorski, Poland’s former secretary of defense, wrote in 2007 that “just as the Holocaust is the formative experience even for Jews who are too young to remember it, so Poland is haunted by the memory of fighting Hitler alone in 1939 while our allies stood by.” Such historical imprints can sometimes be unwittingly overlooked by the United States: one Polish official, for example, recalled that the United States canceled its missile defense plans with Poland on September 17, 2009, the 70th anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the disconnect is simply due to the global nature of U.S. interests, as contrasted with the regional views of most other allies. One South Korean official noted that “the United States will be distracted” from its current focus on China because of its interests in Europe and the Middle East. Conversely, Polish officials worry that U.S. focus on China will leave Poland vulnerable to Russian aggression, while British officials are concerned that a China emphasis will diminish their value relative to U.S. allies in Asia. Middle Eastern governments, for their part, worry that Russia and China will lead to U.S. neglect of their region. A former South Korean official, meanwhile, noted that U.S. efforts to de-escalate in Ukraine and the Middle East raised concerns that the United States would not give South Korea full support in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different interests, of course, are not new. The Five Eyes, rightly touted as a landmark intelligence sharing success, involves countries with varied interests. The United States and the United Kingdom, for example, have had different views on trade, human rights, and conflicts like Vietnam, yet the intelligence relationship endured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistrust is often most pronounced when partners consider other U.S. allies. In general, many countries do not see eye to eye with their neighbors and thus are more willing to share with the United States than with one another. A South Korean official noted that his country is afraid of “all of the countries in the region.” In general, Asian countries all have different views of Japan, for example—views shaped by geography, interests, and history. In the case of South Korea, the country has long harbored hostility toward Japan due to its World War II brutalities and prewar colonialism; this has made security cooperation with Japan a politically sensitive issue, made worse by a sense in South Korea that Japan has not fully renounced its past imperialism. One South Korean expert noted that this concern was “nonsense,” but that its impact was nevertheless real. As a result, the staying power of the U.S.-backed GSOMIA is uncertain. One analyst called these ups and downs a “‘one step forward, two steps back’ situation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concerns About Arrogance and Manipulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One former U.S. official noted that the United States often believes it understands the interests of allies better than they themselves do—even as U.S. policies and priorities regularly flip flop. U.S. stances are, or can be perceived as, arrogant and uninformed at times: a “Daddy knows best” approach, as the official described it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it behooves the United States to listen to allies. U.S. and former Australian officials noted that Australia was often ahead of the United States in recognizing the growing China threat. A Polish official recalled that under President Trump, the United States regularly emphasized the hybrid threat from Russia even as Poland urged more focus on the conventional military threat. A South Korean official pointed out that North Korea, not China, is usually Seoul’s top concern, despite U.S. efforts to shift the country’s perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some allies worry that the United States selectively shares only the intelligence that supports preferred U.S. policies. South Korean analysts, for instance, fear that the United States has misrepresented its intelligence to slant Seoul’s policy decisions on North Korea. South Korea has limited satellite imagery and SIGINT, and thus finds it hard to challenge U.S. intelligence findings that draw on these sources. Some in South Korea claim that the United States knowingly shared false information that North Korea sold nuclear materials to Libya (when the true culprit was Pakistan) because Washington wanted to shore up Seoul’s fears of its northern neighbor. Conversely, South Korean reporting claims that in 1996, when North Korea sent commandos into South Korea using a submarine, Washington did not provide Seoul with detailed intelligence to avoid escalating tensions. This concern contributed to South Korea’s decision to develop its own SIGINT capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fear of Spying&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. spying on allies raises another security complication. In 2013, leaks indicated that the United States was monitoring the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. In 2023, the Korea Herald, drawing on Discord leaks, revealed information that indicated that Washington was spying on South Korea—a concern that exacerbated South Korean fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liaison itself can facilitate spying. Liaison services can use their access to another country’s intelligence personnel to try to recruit them as spies. This complication can go both ways: a South Korean official, for instance, noted that Seoul also tries to spy on and influence the United States. However, the U.S. “no spy” pledge with the Five Eyes helps offset this concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing also creates a risk of losing spies. One non-U.S. officer noted that smaller nations feared that revealing their sources to the United States might open the door for Washington to recruit them, outbidding their original affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obstacle-2-autonomy-concerns&quot;&gt;Obstacle 2: Autonomy Concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. intelligence community commands vast resources in comparison to its partners. A senior UK intelligence official noted that U.S. intelligence has a bigger budget “than the UK Ministry of Defence, armed forces, aid budget, Foreign Office and intelligence agencies combined.” A 2017 report on the Five Eyes indicated that the United States provided 90 percent of the intelligence shared with Australia in that alliance. One study from 2016 found that 85 percent of South Korea’s SIGINT and IMINT on North Korea came from the United States. Similarly, Japan has significant weaknesses in its SIGINT and cyber capabilities, which are offset by U.S. support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the United States collects, analyzes, and disseminates far more intelligence than its allies, which makes it a highly desirable partner. A downside of this, however, is that allies fear becoming too dependent on U.S. intelligence. In response to concerns about intelligence autonomy vis-à-vis North Korea and China, South Korea has tried to develop its own intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, overlapping those of the United States. Some Australian analysts fear that they are losing autonomy in intelligence and policy, citing their government’s decision to go to war in Iraq based on incorrect U.S. intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fear has precedent. During World War II, for example, Australia focused on Japanese traffic analysis; when the United States temporarily pulled back from the Pacific after the war, Australia was left with little capacity for the SIGINT tasks, such as cryptanalysis, that the United States had handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obstacle-3-security-barriers&quot;&gt;Obstacle 3: Security Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When sharing intelligence, U.S. officials rightly worry that partner nations may have security lapses that lead to adversary penetration, leaks to the media, or both. In the end, security and intelligence sharing involves a risk-reward trade-off. Even if allies exercise careful information security, counterintelligence concerns remain a harsh reality. By sharing more, the United States increases the risks both to the lives of sources and to the value of a multibillion-dollar technical system. As such, a security mindset often dominates intelligence sharing. The more sensitive the intelligence platform or method, the greater the concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many partner countries have weak counterintelligence, leaving them vulnerable to adversary intelligence services. Because many important countries are frontline states, they are often especially vulnerable to adversary penetration. Post–Cold War Poland, for example, has had numerous Russian penetrations of its intelligence services and security establishment. Some allies vital to the struggle against China also have weak security. One foreign official noted that their service would be reluctant to share with the Philippines, given Chinese penetration there. Questions about sharing sensitive information with Taiwan at times produced laughter from interviewees. Within NATO, both Turkey and Hungary have cooperated with Russia diplomatically and, at times, on security, making other countries reluctant to share information for fear of it being passed to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, too, has counterintelligence problems that pose dilemmas for allies: U.S. leaks are a periodic problem, both in the intelligence community and at political levels. When information regarding secret U.S. detention sites in Poland leaked in 2005, Poland denied this (helpfully, from a U.S. point of view). Yet later revelations of Polish involvement led to concerns in Poland about the security of Polish troops operating in support of U.S.-led missions in the Middle East. The 2010 WikiLeaks publication of massive amounts of U.S. intelligence related to Iraq and Afghanistan and Edward Snowden’s 2013 leak of volumes of highly classified data are among the many examples of information from allies becoming public. In the Snowden case, some of the information allegedly came from Five Eyes sources, and the leaks hurt allies’ intelligence output. Similarly, the 2017 leaks to U.S. media of sensitive British intelligence and President Trump’s leak of Israeli information related to Syria both angered partners and raised questions about U.S. reliability. Reports that the National Security Agency (NSA) had shared the personal information of Canadians citizens led Canada to put data sharing on hold with Five Eyes partners. In almost all of these cases, however, the impact of the leaks were short (term and cooperation resumed in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaks also feed conspiracy theories, which are only exacerbated by “no comment” responses. Even worse, as one foreign official noted, “Security leaks from U.S. sources lead to a clamp down on what can be shared with foreign partners.” These situations can lead to a general tightening of all information sharing, even to partners who are not responsible for the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also has far more legislative oversight of its intelligence agencies than other allies do. This often raises fears among partners that Congress will reveal information they provide or otherwise compromise security—a fear that is magnified by the executive branch’s frequent blaming of Congress for leaks, many of which actually stem from the executive branch itself. In addition, Congress often wants to have it both ways, pushing cooperation while also blaming the intelligence community when such cooperation leads to security lapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rarer cases, foreign intelligence may also be revealed in court cases if it is considered by the court to be legitimately relevant to a trial. Often this is related to counterterrorism or counterintelligence allegations against a citizen of another country, when the defendant’s right to a fair trial trumps security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obstacle-4-incompatible-interfaces&quot;&gt;Obstacle 4: Incompatible Interfaces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when both sides are committed to sharing information, doing so can be difficult in practice. Common problems include a lack of secure technical systems, incongruence in counterpart organizations, differing political and legal mandates among organizations, and diverging modes of collection, analysis, and information storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of Secure Technical Systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For intelligence to be shared, computer and other information systems must be able to connect in a sufficiently secure manner. Some allies, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, have special access to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), a secure network for conveying classified material. There is now also a SIPRNet option to quickly label information as releasable to Japan as part of a dropdown menu, an important step that puts it more on par with the Five Eyes. Taiwan has reportedly upgraded its computer system to exchange real-time intelligence with Five Eyes. NATO allies, on the other hand, use the Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System (BICES).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite such measures, the incompatibility of different technology systems is a major obstacle to intelligence cooperation, hindering both the speed and scale of information sharing. As one Five Eyes official noted, “Just because we have an intelligence sharing agreement doesn’t mean we have intelligence sharing systems.” Usually the problem is a “multitude of mini-problems,” another official noted. Some information systems have drop-down menus that easily allow sharing with various allies, while others do not. One U.S. official noted that the systems are hard to use for sharing, and it is often difficult to know how to get information. The same official also noted that while the system works half of the time, requests are automatically rejected the other half of the time for unexplained classification reasons. Indeed, one Five Eyes official noted that information sharing is often better at the Top Secret level than at the Secret level because of the historical sharing of SIGINT. Information often cannot go from one country’s system to another’s, even when both sides want to share. In some cases, certain forms of sharing do function well, such as email, but other forms, such as shared drives, aren’t present. Problems still occur, even with close allies on time-sensitive issues, because systems do not align. Japan, for instance, has few intelligence sharing terminals in contrast to other allies, because many such terminals are allocated via NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, complexity grows when information is shared with more than one national actor. Countries may have sharing agreements with the United States, but often do not have them with each other. As such, they must frequently send information to the United States for transmission to a third country, rather than work directly with that country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of this communication problem is likely to increase as the role of technology in information processing grows. Manual disclosure to foreign partners, for example, works poorly when there are vast amounts of information, much of which is now processed by artificial intelligence (AI). As many U.S. allies under-invest in technology systems, these gaps are likely to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of Bureaucratic Congruence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is variation in bureaucratic congruence among U.S. partnerships, often depending on levels of historical cooperation. Cooperation between the NSA and its British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), is excellent; Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) cooperation with their UK counterparts is strong; CIA cooperation with MI-6 is solid; FBI cooperation with the Security Service is relatively weak, however, as the two agencies have had fewer reasons to connect over the years. Not surprisingly, the technically oriented collection agencies have the most sophisticated and seamless systems for information sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many allies have balkanized intelligence services. Although some, like Australia, have the equivalent of a DNI, there is no South Korean administrator who acts as a central coordinating authority between intelligence agencies. As such, the DNI in Washington has no counterpart in Seoul with whom he or she can meet to discuss and negotiate the intelligence relationship. Successive U.S. DNIs have only publicly met with the South Korean president during their visits to the country, but a country’s president is not focused on intelligence coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizational incongruency extends to individual intelligence agencies. The director of the NSA is a four-star general; meanwhile, a two-star general heads the Defense Security Agency (DSA), the South Korean SIGINT body. There has been no public interaction between the respective heads of the NSA and DSA. Instead, the special United States liaison advisor Korea, an NSA contingent in the country, has facilitated SIGINT cooperation since the end of the Korean War. While the technical capacity to share large volumes of collected intelligence exists, organizational differences create issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of internal integration can also create difficulties for external sharing. Countries often do not share information well internally, which makes it harder for them to share information with the United States. (The reverse is also true, and this problem applies just as much to the United States in its attempts to share information with other nations). At least several U.S. partners have had to better integrate their own intelligence and threat assessments in order to share more effectively with partners. When a fusion center or similar location exists to centralize information, sharing becomes easier because there are fewer actors with whom to coordinate, as well as a common set of security procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, for example, is highly siloed, with five major intelligence agencies. These often do not share with one another, and thus it is not surprising that they often do not share with the United States—or that when they do, each has its own independent relationship. Poland, too, lacks a clearinghouse for much of its information. As a result, collection from separate services is often duplicative, and the information collected is often not shared internally or with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this technical and procedural complexity, personal relationships matter tremendously, as they help ensure coordination through bureaucratic work-arounds. As one former senior U.S. official declared, “So much is personality based.” In U.S.-Australia collaboration, Pine Gap is a key location for joint collection; it also serves as a space for American and Australian intelligence personnel to form trusting professional relationships. Foreign military and intelligence officials play vital roles in explaining their countries’ perspectives to U.S. personnel. On the other side, the host country’s knowledge of local U.S. chiefs of station is often vital, as is the knowledge of other leading defense and intelligence officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, however, U.S. officials deployed to foreign countries do not speak the language, which limits the creation of personal relationships, and overall communication. Language facility also demonstrates respect for host cultures. Local familiarity can often vary by service: One interviewee noted that U.S. Navy officers and Marines know Japan’s history and interests well, for example, while the knowledge of Army officers is more limited because the historical relationship is not as strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different Political Mandates Among Organizations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of why the Five Eyes works well is that intelligence agencies play similar roles in member governments, in which intelligence is both regularly used and largely depoliticized. In other partner countries, including many democracies, intelligence services are more politicized and thus more likely to change course with political winds. This has led to concerns in the United States about sharing information with these partners, and especially about bolstering their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, the transition to democracy has led to more oversight and restrictions on domestic spying. Despite these restrictions, South Korean intelligence has been involved in illegal wiretapping and disinformation operations in presidential and other elections. One 2018 study found that almost all presidents of South Korea have not permitted the country’s intelligence apparatus “to adhere strictly to its legal mandate of non-intervention in domestic politics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some important countries concerned about Russian and Chinese aggression are themselves autocracies, while others have political systems that, while democratic, are more prone to abuse of power and human rights violations, often with intelligence services implicated. In Poland, when the Law and Justice Party (PiS) arose in the early 2000s, it made claims that the secret services had penetrated the country’s economic and political systems and were often in league with Russia. When the PiS won elections, it argued that cleaning house required a purge of the intelligence agencies, with one leading PiS critic of the services claiming that the services’ main purpose was as “a lever for pursuit of party politics and informal power networks that managed to capture the Polish state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different Modes of Collecting, Analyzing, and Storing Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different intelligence services have different historical traditions, and these can make coordination with other services difficult. Sir Stephen Lander, the former director general of the UK Security Service, remarked in 2004 that some countries “collect haystacks and store them, while others collect hay and store needles, while others again only ever collect needles and not very many of them. The risk of sharing haystacks with needle keepers is that they would not be able to use the material effectively or would be swamped.” Another challenge is between states that divide domestic and foreign intelligence, such as Canada, and those that do not, which creates collection and dissemination restraints for both partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obstacle-5-bureaucratic-barriers&quot;&gt;Obstacle 5: Bureaucratic Barriers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. information-sharing procedures also create additional—and at times unintended—barriers to intelligence cooperation. Problems include strong incentives to classify information as NOFORN, overall system complexities, and the proliferation of veto players in the U.S. system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOFORN Incentives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has created a labyrinthine set of rules that govern the sharing of information, imposing severe limits within broader policy guidance from senior U.S. officials (who, as one official noted, often create or endorse many of these rules). The United States, as one U.S. official put it, “does not have any info sharing policies at all. It has information security policies and information sharing exceptions to these policies.” As Corbett and Danoy argue, “The policy as it stands can be interpreted to support a default setting to NOFORN.” As a result, important information regularly is not shared or, almost as bad, takes far too long to be shared, which greatly reduces its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, as a former senior U.S. official put it, there is “wild overclassification” in the United States, and the tremendous complexity of rules governing information sharing adds to this problem. The official went on to note that the United States “no longer knows what its intelligence crown jewels are.” This has become more and more true as the amount of classified information has ballooned, with far more personnel seeking access to it at their jobs, thus increasing the risk of compromise. As journalist Patrick Radden Keefe contends, “For any government officer making a quick decision in the course of a busy workday, the penalties for underclassifying are quite salient, whereas penalties for overclassifying do not exist.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, bureaucratic incentives for working-level officials are the problem. “A Four Star can say ‘release everything,’ but some guy in tennis shoes [in a different bureaucracy] sees a missing label and kills it,” said one foreign intelligence officer. Another foreign intelligence officer noted that senior U.S. officials regularly send out directives calling for more sharing with allies, but in practice little changes: “The bureaucratic reluctance is in stark contrast to the strategic guidance. The people who manage risk emphasize security, not sharing.” An allied official put it this way: “It’s NOFORN, and it has always been that way.” The official went on to warn of the difficulty of change, noting that a sentiment of “this is the way we’ve always done it” governs most procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internally, all U.S. government agencies have significant punishments for sharing information improperly and few rewards for doing so well. Indeed, punishment is often at the individual level: if a well-meaning junior official makes a sharing decision that is later deemed a mistake, the junior official is at risk of punishment and even (though rare) prosecution. (“The O-4 might not get cover,” one foreign official put it.) Indeed, the United States has a long history of aggressively prosecuting low-level leakers while being less aggressive toward senior officials when they leak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, potential work-arounds. Removing NOFORN designations can be done, but it is bureaucratically difficult for some agencies. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for example, can direct DIA to remove a NOFORN label on occasion, but doing so on a routine basis is hard. In general, when a request to downgrade highly classified information to a more releasable level is eventually approved, or when a “tearline”—which eliminates some information, giving an ally only a partial picture—is created, some useful information can be transmitted. This process, however, is often lengthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proliferation of Veto Players&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence sharing is governed by several guidelines. Most notable is Intelligence Community Directive 403, which covers “Foreign Disclosure and Release of Classified National Intelligence.” Other guidelines deal with areas including more general classification and tearlines for intelligence sharing. Directive 403 declares, “It is the policy of the U.S. Government to share intelligence with foreign governments whenever it is consistent with U.S. law and clearly in the national interest to do so, and when it is intended for a specific purpose and generally limited in duration.” The directive also notes that the intelligence community “shall limit the use of restrictive dissemination control markings to the minimum necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these guidelines offer a degree of consistency, they also illustrate several limits and potential problems. First, although ODNI provides overall guidance, it does not control or direct sharing with allies. The system is decentralized, and the intelligence community personnel representing the agencies from which the information originates are responsible for approving release to foreign governments, as these personnel are usually best placed to know the cost if the information and associated sources and methods were to be lost. Given the United States’ numerous collection entities, there is often considerable variation in how guidance is interpreted. In addition, the guidance is unclear as to what role the intelligence community should play in building partner capacity to better enable sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems within the Department of Defense, where half of the 18 U.S. intelligence entities reside, are particularly complex. DOD has its own policies for releasing classified information to foreign governments. These policies are opaque overall, leaving decisions up to various agencies or, at times, individual personnel. Often those tasked with foreign disclosure are analysts with minimal training and many other responsibilities. Even sharing with Five Eyes requires additional permissions. As a result, per Corbett and Danoy, “The busy analyst is therefore more likely to opt for the safe option of defaulting to NOFORN.” Indeed, one foreign intelligence official wryly noted that information their service provided to the Five Eyes later received a NOFORN label. Another noted that they have seen Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) information show up as NOFORN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, some post-9/11 measures to improve internal U.S. sharing have hindered sharing with foreign partners. After 9/11, there were efforts to bring various intelligence agencies together, such as the creation of more fusion cells. As a result, where once one agency might have allowed a cleared foreign official to be in the room or to read intelligence, now all agencies get a say; some invariably have stricter rules than others, resulting in a lowest-common-denominator effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems vary depending on which U.S. agencies are involved. Often, collectors of the same type of intelligence (e.g., SIGINT) find it easier to share information with foreign partners than to do so domestically, due to cultural and technical system compatibilities. The FBI, in contrast, faces steep difficulties in foreign sharing, a fact that hampers its potentially important role against Russian and Chinese subversion at the domestic level, among other things. Because FBI information concerns U.S. citizens, sharing is often difficult for legal and political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is often worse in the United States than outside of it, which demonstrates the importance of both bureaucratic compatibility and trust. U.S. and joint facilities outside the United States tend to have fewer bureaucratic players, “and they are more at the pointy end,” as one foreign intelligence official put it. These countries are more aware of the risks of not sharing—the sense of which gets “diluted in the safety of D.C,” in the words of one official—and more attuned to how information might be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times, the problems that result from overly vigilant security can lead to small indignities. Even Five Eyes–affiliated individuals embedded in U.S. agencies must often work in physically separate parts of offices, which further reduces intelligence sharing and decreases personal bonds. According to one official, cleared foreign officials can escort guests from their own governments and militaries at DIA, NGA, and NSA, but not at the Pentagon. As a result, there is significant paperwork for both U.S. and foreign officials when allied officers and officials visit. In addition to wasting time, this state of affairs signals a lack of faith: “They don’t trust us to go to the bathroom,” sighed one official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cost of the Failure to Share&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of these problems is high. Measuring their direct impact, however, is difficult, as the counterfactual—what would improve with more sharing?—is impossible to gauge. As one former allied intelligence official put it, “It’s hard to know what you don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, some valuable information fails to reach allies. One non-U.S. intelligence official noted that they rarely see U.S. information in their day-to-day work. This, in turn, affects threat perceptions and attitudes toward the United States. Allies may prove slower to recognize aggression from Beijing, Moscow, or other revisionist powers in the absence of salient U.S. intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooperation is likely to suffer both before and during a crisis, even if more information is eventually shared. Allied military forces may have sub-optimal postures, fail to be prepared for a confrontation, or lack effective cooperation during a crisis: as one official put it, key figures may be exchanging business cards as they meet for the first time rather than rolling up their sleeves to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of intelligence sharing can mean that an important tool for building overall relationships is not being fully employed. Though it usually takes place behind the scenes, such sharing can help a relationship endure even as public relations become fraught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States sets its own collection requirements, as do most allies; this can make resource issues more pronounced. Because collection is not coordinated, the United States often does not know what information allies—even Five Eyes countries—already have, thus reducing the economy of efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timeliness is another problem. U.S. guidance calls for responses to sharing requests to be made within seven working days, a frame that only works if information is not time sensitive. As one U.S. official noted, “the [foreign disclosure officer] process can be a day, it can be a month.” Much depends on the degree to which information must go back to originating agencies, and how many agencies are involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can and does alter how it shares intelligence when a crisis or other priority change occurs: U.S. sharing with Ukraine and other European countries, for example, increased significantly after the 2022 Russian invasion. This both improved threat assessments and operational coordination. Allies are aware that such sharing can change dramatically, but the conditions under which this might occur are not always clear. Future-oriented intelligence, including some long-term assessments, is often NOFORN. One allied intelligence officer noted that their country enjoyed good cooperation with U.S. intelligence services during Operation Prosperity Guardian, which countered Houthi aggression in the Red Sea, but that such cooperation had been lacking before the crisis. As one allied defense leader noted, “We seek both predictability and speed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing information at the strategic level, although usually less immediate, is vital for long-term alignment. As one intelligence officer noted, “For our country to change its policies, we need intelligence at the policy level.” The officer went on to note that this was particularly important because great power competition, unlike counterterrorism, involves more diffuse problems and many tradeoffs, all of which causes policies to be in flux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chapter-04-recommendations-for-improving-intelligence-sharing&quot;&gt;CHAPTER 04 Recommendations for Improving Intelligence Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the status quo by reducing barriers to intelligence sharing is an urgent task. However, many of the barriers to effective sharing cannot be changed or would be very difficult to alter. Varied interests are an inherent part of international relations, and the United States and its allies should not expect to always agree on the nature of threats and how to meet them. In addition, U.S. and allied cultures and political systems change slowly at best—and when they do, the drivers have little to do with intelligence sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant progress can be made, however, if the United States is willing to take action to change its approach to sharing and bureaucratic procedures. The necessary steps are both difficult and painful, and many come with genuine tradeoffs. They are necessary, however, if the United States is to work more closely with allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prioritization-and-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Prioritization and Diplomacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach of “need to know” should be followed when applied with common sense, but it is currently used to justify overclassification. Some goals are worth the counterintelligence risk inherent in greater sharing; in other cases, it is worth denying potential partners information in the name of protecting sources and methods. One official noted that they were constantly bombarded with requests for sharing by individuals who had little need to know. The intelligence office at the National Security Council should approach this prioritization via an interagency process and enforce it with various agencies, both in situations where more sharing is required and at times when it is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this report focuses on U.S. problems, many of the sharing issues are on the partner side, and improved intelligence should also be a diplomatic priority. The United States should encourage allies to invest more in their intelligence services, improve their sharing internally, strengthen their counterintelligence, and upgrade their technical systems to ensure compatibility and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-revamped-security-culture&quot;&gt;A Revamped Security Culture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest challenges to improved sharing involve revising security protocols and changing internal incentives. The skill of Chinese and Russian intelligence agencies makes this a difficult and evolving challenge. Revising security protocols will entail assuming more risk: The more intelligence shared with allies, the more likely adversaries are to gain access to secret information via leaks and security lapses, which can have costly consequences. The current approach, however, involves the opposite form of risk—a form that is harder to observe but likely more costly, as under sharing results in missed opportunities to improve U.S. and allied security. The personal connections, knowledge of allies’ intelligence cultures and political realities, and other intangibles will grow if cooperation grows, further enhancing security. Indeed, one senior U.S. official noted that joint operations can build trust, which leads to better operations. Better training would also make sharing more effective and would help change culture in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A culture shift of this magnitude will require allies to make security improvements, and the United States should encourage and at times help devote resources to these improvements. At the same time, imperfections in allies’ intelligence systems should not be excuses for inaction. The United Kingdom was initially (and rightly) skeptical of U.S. security procedures at the onset of Five Eye cooperation after World War II and worked with the United States to improve its counterintelligence. The United Kingdom took a gamble in sharing information with the United States in the early days of the Cold War—but over time, a robust relationship developed that led to considerable trust. Australia, to give another example, has had to upgrade its facilities and counterintelligence to expand sharing with the United States. Similarly, Japan has improved its counterintelligence to gain better access to sensitive U.S. equipment like satellite tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital that the incentives for individuals involved in declassification are changed. This would involve increasing training, reducing the risk of individual punishment, and providing incentives for sharing. The risk for individuals of allowing a security breach is high, but there is little payoff for successful sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reducing-noforn&quot;&gt;Reducing NOFORN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security fears have led to the NOFORN designation being used too frequently, according to this paper’s interviewees, to the point that it is essentially the default rather than a deliberate decision. As one former U.S. intelligence official put it, the goal should be to go from NOFORN to “YESFORN”: The default should be sharing, and collectors or security officers should have to prove that sharing should not occur, especially with Five Eyes and other highly trusted allies. This would considerably reduce the friction in the process. Below are several useful steps that could be implemented to enable this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Five Eyes representatives who work in U.S. intelligence agencies, the NOFORN caveat should be removed for nearly everything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;ODNI and the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security should have greater power to increase intelligence sharing across the agencies they coordinate and should push to make “Releasable to FVEY” a more common classification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NOFORN should be removed from most finished intelligence for trusted partners after source references are eliminated. As Corbett and Danoy note, “Finished intelligence, by definition, has been through a rigorous editing and approval process, and the chances of a serious disclosure breach are minimal.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Establishing procedures for automatic release if a formal decision is not forthcoming by a certain deadline. It is often bureaucratically easier to delay information releases and, even if the information is approved for sharing eventually, this delay reduces the information’s value. These procedures would apply to NOFORN documents without significant additional codewords.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-low-risk-sharing&quot;&gt;Expanding Low-Risk Sharing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as the United States considers changing its procedures, experimentation in more aggressive sharing should begin in low-risk areas. Corbett and Danoy suggest climate change as one area where information is both valuable and rarely highly classified. With successful pilots in these areas, sharing could be expanded to more sensitive spheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the use of AI expands, sharing via algorithm should also be explored—again, with low-risk areas as a starting point. Because the use of AI is steadily growing, it will be essential to understand the conditions under which AI can expedite sharing in order to improve future cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source information (OSINT), which is increasing in quality and quantity, can usually be shared with ease. Directing countries in which sharing is harder for security reasons—such as the Philippines and Taiwan—to reliable OSINT can provide a common threat picture at a basic level. For example, data from commercial satellites has helped the Quad (the United States, Australia, India, and Japan) track China’s maritime smuggling and maritime militia. Unclassified information provided to India by the United States after the signing of the Basic Exchange Cooperation Agreement on Geospatial Intelligence in 2020 helped India repel a Chinese incursion along the contested border in the Himalayas. Similarly, some aspects of space awareness are also unclassified. The OSINT community should work to produce more finished intelligence on demand, which could then be incorporated easily into information shared with partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in commercial technology will also require revisiting the sensitivity of classified collection and analysis. Commercial geospatial capabilities, for example, have improved dramatically in recent years, surpassing older systems whose capabilities were extraordinarily secret. This shift allows greater sharing of information in a realm that was once highly classified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resourcing-and-personnel&quot;&gt;Resourcing and Personnel&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some agencies, it is often difficult for busy intelligence officers to declassify information in a timely way. This is particularly the case when analysts do not fully understand classification rules (some of which are contradictory) and the penalties for security violations are high. Allowing more foreign access would require some originating organizations to further develop their own disclosure expertise and clearance procedures, which would mean a significant resource investment. This would require new foreign disclosure officers and similar personnel to receive more training. It would also require training for analysts and collectors to write products that both allow for greater sharing and protect sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving cooperation will also require helping partner governments improve their security, invest in new technology for information sharing systems, and take on more personnel to manage relationships. Buying more communications systems and ensuring compatibility will be expensive and will require major investments. The rewards usually outweigh the costs, however, especially over time and during crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improved language skills will also be vital. U.S. intelligence agencies’ problems with foreign languages are well documented. It is not a coincidence that the most successful sharing alliance, the Five Eyes, involves a common language. The United States at times deploys military and intelligence officers to foreign agencies with the expectation that foreign personnel should operate in English. “Imagine how much better relations would be,” one official commented, if U.S. officials could operate in allies’ languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer tours for liaison officers would be helpful. This could be difficult for hardship tours and, bureaucratically, could put intelligence officers out of sync with the State Department; however, it would greatly help build expertise and personal connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-the-circle&quot;&gt;Expanding the Circle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been many calls to expand the Five Eyes, with proposals for the inclusion of countries such as France, Germany, Japan, and South Korea, although a British report noted that “there is little prospect of expansion, at least in the medium term” due to the high levels of trust needed to enter this exclusive club. These nations already have significant intelligence cooperation with the United States, as well as common interests. Germany has a strong space presence, proximity to Russia, careful SIGINT procedures, and even an embassy in Pyongyang that might allow greater access to North Korea. France also has a large space presence, excellent SIGINT, and a presence in Africa and South America through its overseas territories, including islands like Mayotte and Réunion. South Korea, of course, boasts impressive collection and analysis on North Korea, as well as access to information on China. These countries would need to resolve their own balkanization problems and properly resource their services as conditions for significantly closer sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some countries that are ideal partners in efforts against China and Russia have significant security problems, limiting cooperation. India is a useful strategic partner, but it has numerous ties to Russia. Taiwan, while useful, is a place where China has an extensive intelligence presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A valuable alternative to expanding the Five Eyes, especially given the high trust barrier, would be to develop smaller alternative groups that are focused on particular targets and on sharing a narrow scope of information. For example, the United States has expanded intelligence liaison relationships with Quad countries. A China-focused group would be an obvious step and could consist of existing Five Eyes partners like Australia and New Zealand, with additions like Japan and South Korea; Taiwan and the Philippines could also play roles, albeit lesser ones, given their security weaknesses. There is danger, however, in forming clubs, which creates new haves and have-nots, potentially generating resentment and reducing trust. Nevertheless, alliances can also create incentives for the improvement of security procedures, the forming of common protocols, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When expanding circles of intelligence sharing, there will inevitably be mistakes—possibly grievous ones. As it is, however, the United States is paying the cost of insufficient sharing on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence sharing, while fraught with challenges, is indispensable to enhancing U.S. security. The imperfections of intelligence sharing demand an aggressive approach to reform. The United States must foster a more agile and inclusive environment for intelligence collaboration. This endeavor should not merely be about refining tactics or expanding networks, but about strategically rethinking the foundational aspects of security collaboration to better address the threats of today and tomorrow. By taking on this challenge, the United States and its allies can enhance their strategic foresight, operational efficiency, and collective response capabilities, ultimately ensuring improved security for all participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and the ongoing war that has followed, have dramatically shifted the strategic landscape in Europe, triggering the most devastating war on the continent since World War II. More Russian soldiers have died in Ukraine than in all previous Soviet and Russian wars since World War II combined, including Russia’s bloody wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya. The Ukraine war has caused the most significant refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, driving over 6 million Ukrainian refugees to Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, and other countries. The war has also had substantial humanitarian implications, causing widespread civilian deaths and destruction in Ukraine and disrupting public access to water, electricity, heating, health care, and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Russian aggression in Ukraine and increase in gray zone activity across Europe, there has been a robust debate about whether the United States should focus its defense priorities and military posture on the Indo-Pacific to counter China. While the Indo-Pacific is a strategically important region, the United States needs to be prepared to deter two major theater wars—one in Europe and the other in the Indo-Pacific—as well as ensure readiness for contingencies elsewhere, such as in the Middle East and Korean Peninsula. After all, Russia has invaded one country (Ukraine) and waged war in several others, such as Syria. China has not—at least not yet. In its approach to defense planning, the Trump administration should ensure that the allocation of limited forces between the two theaters is tailored to match the unique demands of each region while carefully managing risks and trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In examining U.S. posture in Europe, this analysis asks three main questions. What are the main security threats in Europe for the United States and its allies? What are U.S. interests in Europe? What is the appropriate U.S. force posture in Europe? In answering these questions, this analysis comes to several broad conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the United States needs a long-term military presence in Europe focused on NATO’s eastern flank to deter Russian aggression. But the United States should reduce its military footprint in Europe from today’s 5+2 posture to a 4+2 posture with four brigade combat teams (BCTs) and two regional headquarters. Even if there is a successful ceasefire in Ukraine, Russia will likely remain a serious threat to the United States and Europe over the next several years. Russian president Vladimir Putin retains the political will and intentions to expand Russian power abroad, and Russia is reconstituting its military capabilities with help from China, Iran, and North Korea. While the United States may adjust its current posture in Europe, which was dramatically increased following Russia’s invasion, a significant downsizing of U.S. forces in Europe for redeployment to other regions could severely weaken deterrence and embolden a revanchist Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the United States should permanently station a U.S. Army armored brigade combat team (ABCT) in Poland to strengthen deterrence, reassure the United States’ Eastern European allies, and pursue a more sustainable posture. Shifting the current rotational ABCT from Operation Atlantic Resolve to a permanent presence in Poland should be part of a 4+2 posture in Europe. This setup would include four U.S. BCTs—three forward-stationed BCTs in Poland, Italy, and Germany, along with one rotational BCT in Romania—and two divisional headquarters, in Germany and Poland. Moreover, a permanent forward-stationed ABCT in Europe would be less costly from both a fiscal and readiness perspective than the current rotational deployment model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the United States needs to continue pressing European militaries to increase their own capabilities to deter Russia and—if deterrence fails—to help fight and win a major power war, particularly given U.S. interests and defense objectives in the Indo-Pacific. As it currently stands, European militaries would likely have difficulty conducting operations at the high end of the conflict continuum without significant assistance from the United States. European states still lack sufficient capabilities in such areas as combat support, including short-range air defense and long-range indirect fires; airlift and other logistical means of transporting troops and material; quantity, quality, and capabilities of ground forces, especially heavy maneuver forces; and sufficient quantities of long-range precision strike munitions, such as the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this brief is divided into five sections. The first outlines historical trends in U.S. force posture in Europe. The second section assesses the future threat landscape. The third summarizes U.S. interests and defense objectives in Europe. The fourth section details the primary components of a robust force posture in Europe. The fifth provides a brief conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;historical-trends-and-current-posture&quot;&gt;Historical Trends and Current Posture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ military posture in Europe has evolved considerably from the end of World War II to the present. Changes to the number and types of capabilities of U.S. forces in Europe have been driven by several factors, including the perception of the threat posed by the Soviet Union and Russia to the United States and its European allies, the relative balance of military capabilities between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, the evolution of U.S. strategy and political considerations, and the relationship between the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following World War II, total U.S. end strength fell from over 12 million personnel in 1945 to just 1.4 million by 1948, despite rising tensions between the West and Soviet Union. U.S. end strength in Europe meanwhile fell to approximately 150,000 by the late 1940s. The adoption of NSC-68 under the Truman administration following the Korean War had the practical effect of waking the United States and Europe up to the military dimensions of the Cold War as the United States and NATO took steps to significantly increase their military presence. However, NATO members failed to meet the ambitious goals agreed to in Lisbon in 1952. During this period, the U.S. military pushed for the creation of an integrated NATO command structure and took on critical NATO staff roles, including a U.S. general as the supreme allied commander, Europe (SACEUR). The United States also established U.S. European Command (EUCOM) in August 1952.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zEmoSA3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under President Eisenhower’s New Look strategy, the United States reduced the role of conventional forces in Europe to a “tripwire” and “delaying force” as deterrence relied on massive retaliation. The Kennedy administration’s “flexible response” strategy sought a more “balanced” approach in the belief that massive retaliation was no longer credible given advances in Soviet nuclear capabilities. The Soviet Union’s 1976 deployment of SS-20 intermediate-range missiles led the Carter administration to pursue its dual-track strategy, which called for deploying additional missiles in Europe—specifically, Pershing 2 ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles—while simultaneously pursuing arms control talks. Ronald Reagan continued with the deployment of the Pershing 2 missiles in 1983, while also building up U.S. forces in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the end of the Cold War, the United States significantly reduced its military presence in Europe. The Clinton administration planned for a final end strength of 100,000 personnel by 1996, but only reached a low of 113,000 in 1997 due to involvement in the Balkan Wars. The Bush administration sought further cuts to U.S. posture as the number of U.S. service members in Europe fell to 66,000 in 2008, and end strength reached a post–World War II low of 63,000 in 2013 under the Obama administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s seizure of Crimea and its related military operations in western Ukraine in 2014, along with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, prompted the United States to bolster its military presence in Europe. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Defense announced the beginning of a continuous armored brigade combat team (ABCT) rotational presence in Europe and back-to-back rotations of U.S. troops and equipment to Europe. By 2023, the 7,000-person rotational force included four elements: a division headquarters located in Poznan, Poland; a combat aviation brigade; an ABCT; and a sustainment task force. Following Russia’s 2022 invasion, U.S. end strength in Europe grew significantly to over 100,000 personnel as additional forces were deployed, including another ABCT, a High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) battalion, and KC-135 refueling aircraft, among other forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of ground forces, the United States currently maintains a 5+2 posture consisting of five brigade combat teams—two IBCTs (one permanent and one rotational), one permanent SBCT, and two rotational ABCTs—and two headquarters. This represents an increase from the previous 3+1 model—one permanent IBCT, one permanent SBCT, and one rotational ABCT plus one headquarters in place prior to Russia’s 2022 invasion. The permanent units include the 2nd Cavalry Regiment Stryker brigade combat team (SBCT) headquartered in Vilseck, Germany, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade stationed across Vincenza, Italy, and Grafenwoehr, Germany, as well as the forward-stationed 12th Combat Aviation Brigade. The rotational ABCT, established in the wake of Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine, serves as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, which deploys approximately 7,000 U.S. Army personnel (including the ABCT, plus a combat aviation brigade, sustainment task force, and forward division headquarters) to Europe on nine-month rotations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. air capabilities include fighter, attack, rotary-wing, tanker, and transport aircraft that perform close air support, air interdiction, air defense, in-flight refueling, long-range transport, and support of maritime operations. These forces include seven squadrons of fighter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4YRfUm7.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-evolving-threat-landscape&quot;&gt;The Evolving Threat Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Russia will remain the most significant threat to Europe. Today, NATO enjoys a strong conventional and nuclear deterrent. In the event of a potential near-term Russian attack against NATO’s eastern flank, however unlikely, there are several factors in NATO’s favor: the inherent advantage of the defense, the force-to-space ratio problem for Russia, the limited avenues of approach from Russia into Eastern Europe, and the qualitative superiority of NATO forces. In addition, NATO retains a robust nuclear deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Russia has the will and intentions to threaten one or more NATO countries, and it is steadily rebuilding its military capabilities thanks, in part, to aid from China, Iran, and North Korea. Russian military thinking is dominated by a view that the United States is—and will remain—Moscow’s main enemy (главный враг) for the foreseeable future. This view of the United States as the primary adversary has increased since the 2022 invasion. Russian political and military leaders assess that Russia’s struggles in Ukraine have been largely due to aid from the United States and the broader NATO alliance, which Russian leaders interpret as direct participation in the war. In addition, Russian leaders likely believe that the United States is attempting to expand its power, further encircle Russia, and weaken Russia militarily, politically, and economically. These sentiments will make Russia a dangerous enemy over the next several years and will likely further drive Moscow’s desire to reconstitute its military as rapidly as possible, prepare to fight the West if deterrence fails, and engage in irregular and hybrid activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, at least four factors could change the military balance in Europe over the next decade. First, the United States could become overstretched due to a major theater war in another region, such as against China in the Indo-Pacific. European conventional and logistical capabilities are limited—particularly for high-end war—creating potential vulnerabilities if the United States were to withdraw significant air, naval, and ground forces from the region. Second, Russia could continue to rebuild its military capabilities over the next several years with additional help from China, Iran, North Korea, and other countries. Third, there could be a significant decline in U.S. or European political will to build the military capabilities sufficient to deter Russia and a decrease in commitment to NATO. The drop in political will could be caused by a change in political leaders, domestic priorities, financial constraints, or other factors. Fourth, there are other potential wildcards that could impact the threat environment, such as a Russian leadership change or Russian use of a nuclear weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European military capabilities remain concerning. European states still lack sufficient heavy maneuver forces, airlift, naval combatants, and support capabilities, such as logistics and fire support. Although European allies and partners of the United States plan to improve these capabilities by 2030 as part of a greater NATO-agreed initiative, it is unclear whether they will be successful. European challenges are particularly notable when considering a large-scale, high-end conflict at short notice given most European countries’ persistent readiness challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, several European countries will likely struggle to field units because of manpower shortages. For example, the shrinking forces of both the United Kingdom and Germany reflect an overall trend affecting not only Europe but also the United States and Canada in trying to recruit and retain an all-volunteer, professional armed force. This is a challenge that needs to be addressed by all Western nations. Without adequate active-duty volunteers, many national leaders will need to consider whether a greater reliance on reservists will be needed to meet force goals and operational requirements. Additionally, consideration may need to be given to reinstitute conscription in some form—like Finland has done—to have a minimally trained reserve force capable of being called up and deployed if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these wildcards, Russia will likely constitute a serious threat to the United States and Europe for the foreseeable future. Russian president Vladimir Putin retains the political will and intentions to expand Russian power abroad, and Russia is reconstituting its military capabilities with help from China, Iran, and North Korea. The key takeaway is that neither today’s military balance nor deterrence is guaranteed to hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-interests-and-defense-objectives&quot;&gt;U.S. Interests and Defense Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. interests in Europe are significant, and U.S. allies and partners in Europe share the United States’ democratic values and account for significant military, economic, and technological power. Since its establishment in the 1949 Washington Treaty, NATO has been the lynchpin of U.S. security in Europe. The bedrock of NATO is a collective defense provision—an attack on one is an attack on all—that was codified in Article V of the Washington Treaty. During the Cold War, the alliance served as the primary bulwark against the expansion of the Soviet Union. Following the Soviet Union’s collapse, NATO became the major framework for organizing transatlantic efforts on collective security matters, including military interventions in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Libya. In addition, several former Soviet republics (such as Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) and members of the Soviet-aligned Warsaw Pact (such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia) later became NATO members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These treaty relationships have benefited the United States in several ways. One is supporting U.S. leadership. As a result of the United States’ central role in transatlantic and international relations that, in many ways, NATO has cemented, Americans have enjoyed unprecedented economic prosperity and freedom. Successive U.S. governments have been afforded both de facto and de jure privileged status related to such issues as trade partnerships and access to bases in large part because of the outsized role that the country plays in the defense of its allies. For example, the United States would not have been able to prosecute expeditionary and counterterrorism operations in the Middle East and Africa were it not for the bases and prepositioned equipment that the United States has been able to maintain on allied soil in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another long-standing reason for U.S. engagement in Europe is to enable U.S. strategic depth. The United States’ geographic location, protected by both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, no longer provides the same security as in previous decades because of advances in long-range strike, cyber operations, space, and other technological developments. As a result, it is prudent to station U.S. forces overseas to contend with adversary aggression—if not outright conflict—far from the U.S. homeland. Not only does this make the U.S. homeland less vulnerable to outright war, but forward presence is also relatively cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the NATO alliance today affords the United States strategic flexibility. Most of the United States’ main security challenges—from China and Russia to Iran and terrorism—cannot be tackled by one state alone, not even the United States. Allies are critical. They enable flexible cooperation and consultation on any number of strategic issues as they arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has interests elsewhere in the world. In particular, China will likely be the United States’ main global competitor. China poses a challenge to the United States around the globe because of its expanding conventional and nuclear capabilities, irregular warfare and gray zone activities, technological and economic competitiveness, and “wolf warrior” diplomacy. The United States has important interests in other regions as well, including in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. But it is a false dichotomy to argue that the United States needs to choose between these interests—especially between China and Russia. Both are authoritarian regimes cooperating with each other on two major axes. Beijing and Moscow have deepened their military, economic, and diplomatic ties since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The United States should develop a two-front strategy that works with allies and partners to counter China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the United States currently has several broad security interests in Europe, which will likely persist over the next decade:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Protect the U.S. homeland and the security of the American people, including from threats emanating from Europe;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Promote and expand U.S. economic prosperity and opportunity;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Realize and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defend and support the United States’ European allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these interests, the United States has several defense objectives in Europe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deter and defeat conventional and nuclear-armed conflict directed against the U.S. homeland and U.S. allies, as well as coerce, persuade, and influence adversary behavior;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counter irregular and gray zone activities, as well as compete effectively below the threshold of conventional conflict using both defensive and offensive means;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Counter terrorist and other transnational threats;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Deter and prevent state and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of mass destruction; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maintain access to trade routes and global commons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-posture-of-forward-defense&quot;&gt;A Posture of Forward Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these interests and objectives, this section examines potential changes to U.S. military posture in Europe over the next five years. The recommendations outlined below seek to enhance U.S. military posture from its levels before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The benefits of this strategy are twofold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, this posture strengthens the ability of the United States and NATO to deter and repel Russian aggression on the continent. Second, this strategy pursues more sustainable policies by shifting the presence of U.S. ground forces from rotational deployments to permanent, forward-stationed forces and articulating trade-offs and limitations with other strategic priorities, such as competition with China in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ard8cfB.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ground-forces&quot;&gt;Ground Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of operations in Ukraine and the threat from Russia illustrate the continued significance of ground forces in combat in the European theater for deterrence and warfighting. There are several types of capabilities important for achieving U.S. defense objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Army units, including ABCTs;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Main battle tanks, armored personnel carriers, and infantry fighting vehicles;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Integrated air and missile defense systems;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Long-range fires;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Manned and unmanned aircraft;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multi-domain command and control; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional investments and equipment—including logistics—such as munitions stockpiles, spare parts, hardened facilities, and improved lines of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on Russia’s efforts to revitalize its military capabilities, the United States should consequently take steps to strengthen its presence from pre-February 2022 levels by increasing the number of permanent forward-stationed maneuver forces to deter and effectively respond to Russian aggression. That increase entails shifting the rotational ABCT associated with Operation Atlantic Resolve (along with the associated combat aviation brigade) to a permanent, forward-stationed ABCT headquartered in Poland. The United States should also maintain its current rotational infantry brigade combat team (IBCT) presence in Romania, as well as rotational deployments to the Baltic states in the near term and incorporate them into Operation Atlantic Resolve under the command of the V Corps headquarters. However, the requirement for these rotational forces may shift depending on changes to the threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes to the posture of U.S. ground forces would shift the U.S. Army to a posture model of four total brigade combat teams in Europe (three permanent, forward-stationed BCTs and one rotational BCT) plus two headquarters in Germany and Poland—a four BCTs + two headquarters model—and away from both the 3+1 model in place prior to the war in Ukraine and the current 5+2 model. The 4+2 model would also include the permanent forward-basing of two combat aviation brigades (the existing 12th Combat Aviation Brigade plus another). Prior to Russia’s February 2022 invasion, the United States maintained two permanent, forward-stationed BCTs in Europe plus one rotational BCT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommended changes in this analysis for a 4+2 model would maintain the permanent SBCT in Germany and IBCT in Italy and Germany; create a permanent, forward-stationed ABCT at a new base in Poland; maintain the rotational IBCT in Romania; and maintain two permanent headquarters in Germany and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-stationing an ABCT in Poland offers several benefits to maintaining U.S. interests and achieving objectives in Europe, including (1) providing a credible force to swiftly respond to acts of Russian aggression against NATO partners; (2) reassuring allies of U.S. commitment while building interoperability with partner forces; and (3) enhancing the general readiness of U.S. forces at large and reducing costs in the long run. Poland would provide the most practical and beneficial location to establish a new military base for an ABCT from both operational and political perspectives as it already hosts the V Corps Forward Command Post Headquarters, an Army garrison, and sufficient sustainment capabilities—the “first permanent stationing of U.S. forces on NATO’s eastern flank.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More critically, forward-stationing U.S. units in Poland would facilitate the speed of assembly and movement for U.S. operations in Europe, providing a combat-credible ABCT force to quickly counter Russian aggression. This capability would play a particularly major role in deterring or responding to a contingency in the Baltic states, where Russian forces could threaten to cut off or slow the access of U.S. and NATO forces by closing the Suwalki Gap—the 40-mile gap between Kaliningrad and Belarus where Lithuania borders Poland. Poland also offers greater strategic depth than alternative locations, such as the Baltic states, and possesses interconnected rail lines with the rest of Europe that would ease resupply and reinforcement efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-stationing additional U.S. forces would also enhance interoperability with allied forces and society, while lowering costs from a force planning and budgetary perspective. In terms of force-generation, an enduring and constant rotational ABCT presence in Europe for a nine-month deployment requires three total ABCTs. As an illustrative example, U.S.-based ABCT-1 must be training and preparing to deploy to replace ABCT-2 currently in Europe. ABCT-3, also U.S.-based, after recently ending its nine-month deployment, must then recover and begin training to deploy following ABCT-1’s tour overseas. This rotational model eats up more of the Army’s force structure and long-term readiness than one forward-stationed unit would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a fiscal cost perspective, establishing a new base in Poland would initially have high budgetary costs and take roughly seven years to put in place. However, operation and sustainment costs would be significantly lower than those of a rotational force. A forward-stationed ABCT incurs 75 percent of the additional operational tempo (OPTEMPO) costs that a rotationally deployed ABCT would, and it also generates savings over time. Moreover, given the cost of moving their equipment, ABCTs are the most expensive unit to rotationally deploy, suggesting that IBCTs or SBCTs are better suited to the rotational deployment model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-combat-forces&quot;&gt;Air Combat Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of air combat capabilities, a forward defense posture includes maintaining all seven forward-deployed fighter squadrons currently based in Europe and adding an additional F-16 squadron to Spangdahlem Air Base. Four squadrons are already based at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom under the 48th Fighter Air Wing, including two squadrons of F-35A aircraft and two F-15E squadrons. Two squadrons of F-16 aircraft are stationed at Aviano Air Base in Italy under the 31st Fighter Wing, and one additional F-16 squadron is currently stationed at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany under the 52nd Fighter Wing. While stationed out of their respective bases, these units have often been forward deployed to NATO’s eastern flank to provide additional posture amid the war in Ukraine. Forward-stationed forces are supplemented by deployments of U.S.-based fighter aircraft—including active-duty, reserve, and Air National Guard assets—to enhance posture; such deployments have increased in the lead-up to and throughout the Ukraine conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forward-deployed F-35 squadrons enhance the capabilities of U.S. and allied forces to establish air superiority against robust and experienced Russian integrated air defense systems (IADS). F-35 aircraft can also collect electronic signals from and compile a picture of hostile and friendly forces in an area. However, given requirements for the Indo-Pacific region, adding another F-35 squadron to the two currently stationed at RAF Lakenheath is not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, forward stationing an additional F-16 squadron at Spangdahlem Air Base would provide greater short-term combat capacity as allied F-35 squadrons come online. Additional permanently based fifth-generation squadrons in Europe may be more likely to come as future replacements for the Air Force’s F-15E squadrons, which the service plans to cut by more than half by 2028. However, U.S. Air Forces Europe should supplement these aircraft with deployments of U.S.-based fifth-generation squadrons of fighter aircraft—either F-35 or F-22 aircraft—as demanded by the threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further maximize flexibility, U.S. air combat forces based in or deployed to Europe should also be prepared to surge to the Indo-Pacific in the event of a contingency. The Air Force has already leveraged EUCOM assets to fill capability gaps in the Indo-Pacific with the temporary transfer of F-16 aircraft from the 52nd Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base to Kadena Air Base in Japan amid the return of its F-15C/D fighter aircraft to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;naval-forces&quot;&gt;Naval Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve a posture of forward defense, the United States should enhance its naval presence in the Baltic Sea region with small surface combatants and unmanned vessels through 2030 to improve interoperability with allies and partners and to deter Russian aggression. Russia still maintains a sizeable presence in the region. U.S. ships should conduct more frequent port visits, including both FDNF-E patrols and deployments of U.S.-based assets, as well as bilateral and multilateral exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also act in coordination with its NATO allies to tackle several mission sets, including anti-submarine warfare in the Baltic and North Seas, which have been much neglected. NATO has increased its joint anti-submarine warfare exercises among allied forces, including Operation Dynamic Mongoose in the North Atlantic in 2022 and Dynamic Manta off the coast of Italy in 2023. The United States could also pursue greater coordination with allies’ carrier and amphibious capabilities to bolster presence among competing demands from other theaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Navy could supplement existing NATO anti-submarine warfare capabilities by developing and deploying additional systems to the region. One option is homeporting the U.S. Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship, which has anti-submarine warfare capabilities, in German ports to provide improved situational awareness in the Baltics, or alternatively deploying Constellation-class frigates, which also have anti-submarine warfare capabilities, once they are operational. However, the operational requirements for the presence of surface ships and submarines in the Indo-Pacific should take priority over Baltic deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Indo-Pacific demand for naval forces, the Navy could leverage its developing unmanned surface and undersea vessels for anti-submarine warfare and additional missions in the Baltic Sea. Pioneered under the Fifth Fleet’s Task Force 59 in U.S. Central Command, the Navy recently announced its intention to deploy these capabilities to the broader fleet beginning with the Fourth Fleet under U.S. Southern Command in the summer of 2023. The United States and partners should also increase their number of sonobuoys and static hydrophone networks to track subsurface threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Baltic region, the U.S. Navy and NATO allies should prioritize three additional missions. They should develop a plan to tackle hybrid gray zone threats to undersea cables and pipelines and other infrastructure that Russia may target to disrupt the flow of commerce, energy, and information. Furthermore, the United States and NATO should plan to leverage the extensive mining and demining capabilities of new members Finland and Sweden in the event of a possible conflict with Russia that threatens naval deployments and the commercial shipping of partners and allies. Finally, the United States and NATO should anticipate the use of anti-ship cruise missiles in a conflict with Russia and seek to neutralize this threat through the coordination of the Baltic Air Policing mission and Allied Maritime Command as part of the missile defense and suppression mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Black Sea, the United States should work with its regional NATO allies and partners to enhance its maritime domain awareness. The United States and the NATO alliance should encourage regional partners to cooperate and modernize their military capabilities, including by strengthening sea power in ways that are consistent with the Montreux Convention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic represents another vital region for U.S. maritime interests. The United States should expand its capabilities and posture in the Arctic, particularly through the U.S. Coast Guard. The expansion of the United States’ Arctic posture and capabilities should be pursued as rapidly as possible to counter Russian and Chinese security interests in the region. As the Coast Guard awaits delivery of new icebreakers, the military more broadly should seek to enhance cooperation with Arctic allies through joint operations and combined exercises and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;logistics-and-enablers&quot;&gt;Logistics and Enablers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines several types of logistics and enablers, including prepositioned equipment and munitions stockpiles; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; integrated air and missile defense; and infrastructure and mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepositioned Equipment and Munitions Stockpiles:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should take steps to bolster its prepositioned equipment and munitions stocks in Europe to enhance the readiness of U.S. forces in the event of a contingency with Russia. The Army currently maintains its Army Prepositioned Stock-2 (APS-2) across four sites in three different countries (Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands) with enough material to equip two ABCTs; a fifth APS-2 site is planned for Poland. In March 2022, the Army issued some of this stock to the 1st ABCT, 3rd Infantry Division in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While APS-2 stocks have been bolstered by funding from the European Deterrence Initiative, the Army should take additional steps to improve the readiness of this equipment and the forces overseeing it to ensure that U.S. forces arriving in theater will rapidly receive capable equipment. A DOD inspector general investigation found that some materiel provided from APS-2 was “non-fully mission capable” and that “maintenance and coordination shortfalls occurred.” The Marine Corps also maintains prepositioned equipment in central Norway under the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway (MCPP-N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to enhancing prepositioned equipment, the DOD should ensure that EUCOM has the appropriate inventories of munitions in the region. The war in Ukraine has demonstrated the importance of long-range artillery, and U.S. and NATO forces must have enough missiles and munitions in theater to contend with and counter Russian forces. That includes munitions for the Air Force, which should develop plans to maintain weapons for aircraft operating under the agile combat employment (ACE) concept at forward locations, and the Army’s EUCOM munitions starter stocks, which preposition key munitions—including Patriot Missile Segment Enhancement—in Europe for use in the event of a contingency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR):&lt;/strong&gt; The demand for U.S. ISR assets will only increase as the U.S. military expands its missions and operations in the Indo-Pacific and as the Russian military reconstitutes its capabilities on NATO’s eastern flank. While the United States should prioritize the Indo-Pacific, the DOD should maximize its available ISR assets for use by both EUCOM and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. The DOD is currently seeking to modernize its ISR capabilities, with plans to retire the RQ-4 by fiscal year (FY) 2027 and the MQ-9 by FY 2035. However, the DOD and the services should ensure that any gaps in ISR coverage are limited. The DOD should also leverage commercial capabilities to cover any gaps until requirements are established and new platforms are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space-based ISR assets will play a major role in both covering gaps and supplementing ISR provided by traditional airborne assets. Commercial satellite imagery has already been used by NATO to fill gaps in coverage and has played a major role in identifying Russian military movements in the lead-up to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In the next few years, the United States should further leverage commercial satellite imagery to bolster its ISR capabilities in Europe. Over the long term, however, the DOD should ultimately determine the appropriate balance between leasing commercial services and establishing its own systems to ensure sustainable and reliable coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Air and Missile Defense:&lt;/strong&gt; The adoption of some of the recommendations here will necessitate changes to the U.S. air and missile defense posture, including the permanent basing of an ABCT in Poland, which would require an investment in air and missile defense capabilities given its proximity to Russia. If a new base is established, the United States should consider shifting the headquarters of the 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command from Rhine Ordnance Barracks in Germany eastward. If the Army chooses not to move the entire command to Poland, it should prioritize shifting the battalion headquarters of the 5th Battalion, 7th Air Defense Artillery Regiment—which provides command and control operations of Patriot batteries—and the 5th Battalion, 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment with its short-range air defense capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a broader force-planning perspective, the Army should prioritize the development of additional Patriot battalions, which operate at the highest OPTEMPO of all Army units and are in high demand from multiple combatant commands. Given their value in potential conflicts with China and Russia, the Army should create additional units to limit the stress on and the degradation of the readiness of existing units, particularly given the lack of European capabilities in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of ballistic missile defense, the United States should maintain its current posture and force structure in line with Operation Atlantic Sentry. Relevant units include the five Aegis destroyers homeported in Rota, Spain (with a sixth planned to arrive in 2026), along with the two Aegis Ashore sites based in Romania and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure, Mobility, and Access:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States, in partnership with host nations and other NATO allies, should take steps to improve military infrastructure and mobility to ensure ease of access, transportation, and reliable communications throughout the European theater. These include enhancements to infrastructure on both U.S. bases and in partner countries, such as the installation of fiber-optic cables and improvements to railways, road networks, and bridges. The DOD and the European Defence Agency (EDA) have identified military mobility as one area of collaboration under an administrative arrangement reached in April 2023 (see security cooperation section below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the United States should continue to update its security and defense cooperation agreements with its partners and allies to ensure ease of access throughout the European theater. In December 2023, the United States reached new agreements with Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Sweden that provided U.S. forces with access to bases and other infrastructure in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuclear-posture&quot;&gt;Nuclear Posture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should continue with planned nuclear modernization efforts, exercises, and scheduled deployments of assets to the European theater to bolster its deterrent capabilities and reassure allies. The United States currently deploys 100 tactical bombs—the B61-3 and B61-4 gravity bombs—in air bases across five countries in Europe. Under current U.S. nuclear-sharing policy, control over those bombs is maintained by the U.S. Air Force, but seven countries contribute dual-capable aircraft to the mission (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United States) and four air forces (from Belgium, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands) are assigned an active nuclear strike role with those weapons in the event that a nuclear mission is approved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is currently in the process of modernizing its gravity bombs, with the new B61-12 having begun full-scale production in 2022; deployment originally was planned for the spring of 2023 but has been delayed. NATO is also modernizing its nuclear weapons storage facilities, including making upgrades to command and control structures and base security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military and NATO should also continue to conduct exercises with nuclear-capable platforms, including Bomber Task Force missions, to enhance readiness and assure allies of U.S. support. These include the annual NATO Steadfast Noon exercise, which practices nuclear sharing. However, such exercises should occur on a regularly scheduled timeline to ensure consistency and to limit the potential for escalation with or misinterpretation by Russia. There is no evidence that unscheduled Bomber Task Force deployments conducted under the dynamic force employment model offered additional deterrent value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-and-space&quot;&gt;Cyber and Space&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cyber and space domains, U.S. forces should take steps to enhance the security and resilience of their own systems and networks while simultaneously assisting European partners and allies in securing their own capabilities. U.S. Cyber Command should deploy additional “hunt forward” teams to Europe in line with its “defend forward” strategy to counter threats to U.S. forces and allies from Russia and Russian-backed groups. The United States should further define its authorities for and consider expanding its conduct of offensive cyber operations against Russian forces, particularly in the event that the conflict in Ukraine and Russian cyberattacks continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States should also expand deployments of U.S. Space Force units and personnel to Europe and define their role within NATO. The service is currently standing up its own component to operate in EUCOM. Space Force units can play a major role in supporting forward-deployed U.S. forces by preventing enemy interference and maintaining open lines of satellite communication. Additionally, space-based ISR assets will continue to play a major role in the European theater, and the U.S. military should further leverage commercial capabilities to fill gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, U.S. forces should enhance redundancy, in addition to improving the resilience of U.S. assets and networks in terms of both software and hardware. Establishing clear fallback options for communications and ISR in the event of a contingency is vital to ensuring the survivability of networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-cooperation&quot;&gt;Security Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to maintaining and bolstering traditional partner capacity-building efforts, the DOD, in tandem with EUCOM and the U.S. Department of State, should adopt a broader approach to security cooperation in the region that supports NATO allies and other European partners in developing and acquiring advanced military capabilities to increase their national and collective NATO force posture and lessen their reliance on U.S. units and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD should consider standing up a new organization within EUCOM to coordinate broader U.S. security cooperation efforts in Europe and to help close quantitative and qualitative gaps within European militaries that drive their reliance on U.S. forces in some areas. This organization—with representation from the services, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and in coordination with the State Department—would directly interface with NATO headquarters and allied militaries to manage requests for security assistance and arms sales, as well as to provide guidance on the development of new capabilities and coordinate information sharing, as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DOD has already taken some steps to bolster cooperation efforts and information sharing with its April 2023 administrative arrangement with the EDA, which provides a framework for the United States and the EDA to “exchange information and explore collaborative activities falling within the scope of the [EDA’s] mission,” with a focus on areas including supply chain issues, military mobility, and the impact of climate change on defense activities. However, the terms of the agreement specifically preclude “research and technology” from the scope of the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. military presence in Europe will likely remain contentious for several reasons. Numerous U.S. policymakers and analysts assess China to be the most significant threat to the United States for the foreseeable future and argue that the United States should focus the bulk of its military posture and attention—including its military air, naval, and maritime forces—toward and into the Indo-Pacific. In addition, some policymakers and analysts support decreasing the U.S. presence in Europe because some European governments have generally failed to increase their defense budgets or focus on high-end military capabilities. Finally, some contend that the United States should focus on problems at home, such as combatting immigration, improving health care, and stemming the production, trafficking, and use of such drugs as fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some validity in all of these points. China is a major threat, European governments need to spend more (and spend more effectively) on defense, and the United States needs to better address a wide range of challenges at home. Yet, as this analysis maintains, the United States has significant and enduring interests in Europe that will require a force posture of forward defense. A notable decline in the United States’ force posture in Europe would likely be significant and dangerous for U.S. national security in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it would embolden a revanchist Moscow and undermine deterrence in Europe. President Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders would likely see a declining U.S. force posture in Europe as a sign of weakening U.S. resolve and potentially declining power. The United States’ limited response following Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and military action in eastern Ukraine later that year likely encouraged Russia to take future action. Second, a deteriorating U.S. posture would likely embolden other U.S. adversaries, such as China, and heighten concerns among U.S. allies and partners in Asia about U.S. resolve. The views in Taipei, the most likely flashpoint with China, are striking. Some of Taiwan’s national security leaders have warned that a reduced U.S. commitment to Europe—including aid to Ukraine—would heighten Taiwanese concerns about U.S. resolve. Only 34 percent of those in Taiwan in 2023 believed that the United States is a trustworthy country, a decline of more than 11 percentage points from 2021. Researchers concluded that the drop was partly caused by a perception that U.S. resolve is weakening in Europe, including in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe remains a vital region for the United States. The last two U.S. national security and national defense strategies have prioritized China as the main global threat. But Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, its continuing aggression, and its growing cooperation with China are stark reminders that the United States has significant and enduring interests in Europe as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;前白宮顧問提議制裁駱惠寧 黎智英稱凍結中國官員貪污帳戶最有效&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AW0oSnU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，周五（24日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第125日審訊，黎智英第33日作供，控方繼續盤問黎。《香港人權與民主法案》於2019年11月獲美國參議院通過，控方庭上展示2020年4至7月的電郵紀錄，顯示前美國國防部副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 向黎等人表示，受到「公然偏袒的香港法官郭偉健啟發」，故查問法案有否在香港執行，前白宮資深顧問惠頓則提議制裁中聯辦主任駱惠寧，黎則稱：「最有效的方法是凍結中國官員在美國和西方銀行的貪污帳戶。」另外，黎以電郵向美國退休將領 Jack Keane 說：「當美國有更大的軍事支援，人們更安心地在台灣居住和投資。」控方質疑黎目的想向 Jack Keane 重申美國應向台灣提供更多軍事支援。黎否認，強調他只是談論移民議題。黎一度向控方說：「真相似乎未能打動到你（Truth seems to have no bearing on you.）」，接著譏諷道：「你真有創意！（You’re so creative!）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎與美議員合照時拿光時t恤-黎稱沒留意口號遭官質疑&quot;&gt;黎與美議員合照時拿「光時」T恤 黎稱沒留意口號遭官質疑&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續圍繞2019年10月的訪美之行提問。控方指，在2019年10月期間，黎會見了數名人士，包括時任美國眾議院議長佩洛西、美國共和黨參議員斯科特（Rick Scott）和楊恩（Todd Young）。昨日訊息顯示黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 嘗試安排黎與時任美國總統特朗普見面，控方問黎最終有否見到特朗普，黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎與斯科特的合照，二人一同手持印有「Stand with Hong Kong，光復香港，時代革命」的T恤拍照。黎稱因為斯科特手持T恤，所以出於禮貌也拿著T恤，堅稱當時沒有留意T恤上面印有什麼。杜官質疑黎不知道？如果T恤上印著的是一個裸女，黎又會否拿著它拍照？黎稱：「我不會回答假設性問題。」他又指，他只是拿著T恤拍照，反問：「有什麼特別的呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎特朗普簽署法案顯示支持香港-香港會有更多資本去反抗&quot;&gt;黎：特朗普簽署法案顯示支持香港 香港會有更多「資本」去反抗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年10月28日，黎向成員包括郭明瀚、李柱銘和 Mark Simon 的群組發送訊息：「Trump knows how powerful HK is as a leverage for his trade deal and beyond. He’s determined it’s a long fight with China. The new Cold War has just unfolded officially. HK has gathered more wherewithal for its resistance. The world is standing closer to us.（特朗普知道香港作為貿易談判的一個籌碼，有多強大，他堅持這是一個對中國的長久戰。新冷戰已非正式地展開。香港已集合更多反抗的資本。世界正在與我們站得更近。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎之所以傳送上述訊息，是因為《香港人權與民主法案》剛剛獲表決通過。黎否認。控方又問訊息中的「反抗的資本」是什麼。黎回答，如果特朗普簽署了法案，代表他支持香港，那麼香港會有更多「資本」，去反抗中國對自由的侵害、爭取自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾先後會見兩美國安顧問-黎稱純粹朋友見面&quot;&gt;曾先後會見兩美國安顧問 黎稱純粹朋友見面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦問及黎與美國國家安全委員會的關係。在10月訪美之行前，Mark Simon 告訴黎：「WHNSC say they would be happy to see you/ Martin（白宮國家安全委員會說他們會很高興見到你和李柱銘）」。控方指，美國安委期待黎到訪？黎表示：「你可以這樣說。」可是他最終未有會見美國安委，不知道原因，上述訊息之後，美國安委便沒有再被提起。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎過去有否見過任何美國安委職員？黎指他見過前美國副國家安全顧問博明（Matt Pottinger）及其助理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提及前美國國家安全顧問博爾頓（John Bolton），問他在任時，是否屬於國安委的一份子？或是領導？黎表示不肯定。但他確認曾與他見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指國家安全顧問負責就國家安全、軍事和外交政策，向美國總統提供意見，問黎在會見博明的時候是否知道。黎稱不知道，又強調博明是他的朋友，他純粹在那裡與對方見面，而不關注對方職能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭重提 Mark Simon 的訊息，指9月時白宮國家安全委員會說他們會很高興見到黎，因此國安委的職能必會引起黎的關注。黎則稱：「我見他們，不代表他們關注我。」法官李運騰法官問，當黎得悉美國安委說他們會很高興見到他，黎不會為會面作準備嗎，例如了解對方背景、思考說什麼說話？法官杜麗冰提到，黎在會見斯科特之前，向 Mark Simon 查詢法案名稱。黎稱他只是忘記了法案名稱，因而查詢，不代表他為會面作準備。他又指：「我沒有為會面準備任何事，這不是我的做事方式。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著指，黎在會見時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧之前，有作過準備。黎則稱，那只是蓬佩奧的助手 Mary Kissel 傳送訊息給他，否認他有準備會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭又問黎，知不知道為什麼美國安委說很高興見到黎？黎稱不知道，也對於背後原因不感到好奇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前證供提及黎於2019年7月的訪美行程中，曾會見博爾頓。被問到當時為何與博爾頓見面，黎僅指：「他想與我談天，我想與他談天，他是我的朋友。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意知悉馬格尼茨基法案是關於制裁-乃懲罰性措施&quot;&gt;黎同意知悉馬格尼茨基法案是關於制裁 乃懲罰性措施&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示一連串電郵。2020年4月24日，美國國防部前副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 向黎智英、Mark Simon 和退休美國將領 Jack Keane 發送電郵，標題為「Magnitsky Act」。Paul 寫道：「Has anything been done about Magnitsky Act in HK（關於馬格尼茨基法案，在香港有沒有做過任何事）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方提問下，黎同意當時知悉馬格尼茨基法案是關於制裁，除此之外便什麼也不知道。法官李素蘭問黎，那他知什麼是制裁嗎？黎指制裁對象可以是一個國家，或者一個人。控方又問黎是否同意制裁是一個懲罰性的措施？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示電郵，Mark Simon 回覆稱沒有，又表示上周與美國參議員的職員討論過，除非見到定罪或實質情況改變，否則「什麼事也不會發生」，Mark 本人認為這不是差的主意，因單是拘捕是不足夠。他表示：「我知道美國國安委有很好的想法，關於他們不會反對誰人遭到馬格尼茨基制裁懲處。（With all that said I know the NSC does have a pretty good idea of who they would not object to being hit with the Magnitsky sanction.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上稱沒有參與相關討論，按他理解「定罪」即是法庭上的定罪。控方指，此電郵再度顯示 Mark Simon 知道一些內幕消息，問黎知不知道為何 Mark 會談及馬格尼茨基制裁。黎稱不知道，也從沒過問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，當外界與 Mark Simon 溝通的時候，對方知不知道 Mark 是黎的助手，而 Mark 是否代黎行事？黎同意 Mark 代他行事，以他的利益為依歸，但是 Mark 的人脈僅屬於其本人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱美國是唯一救星-因除美國之外沒人關心香港&quot;&gt;黎稱美國是「唯一救星」 因除美國之外沒人關心香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，不爭議的是，美國政府在2020年8月7日首次宣布制裁11名損害香港自治的中港官員。控方指，這是發生在上述電郵對話約4個月之後。黎同意。控方再度問黎是否同意Mark Simon與美國政府關係密切，才會知道內幕消息。黎僅稱：「我不知道他是否有緊密聯繫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，前白宮資深顧問惠頓亦發送電郵回應及提供意見，問黎是否同意惠頓密切跟進香港情況？黎稱不知道惠頓跟進得有多密切，但是同意他知道香港發生的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎曾回覆電郵，稱：「美國現在是我們的唯一救星。如果美國不行動的話我們便會很快完蛋。（America is our only savior left now. If America doesn’t act we will be done very soon.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何說美國是「唯一救星」？黎稱：「因為沒有人關心香港」，又稱：「我看不到任何人關心香港，除了美國之外。」控方追問：「所以你想有馬格尼茨基法案？」黎稱：「我沒有這樣說。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;前白宮資深顧問向黎等人提議制裁駱惠寧&quot;&gt;前白宮資深顧問向黎等人提議制裁駱惠寧&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2020年5月3日，惠頓發送電郵回應 Paul Wolfowitz，副本抄送給黎、Mark Simon 等人。惠頓提議，基於中聯辦主任駱惠寧是政府的「代理人」，牽涉「對國際間認可的人權進行差劣的侵害（gross violations of internationally recognised human rights）」，而制裁駱。電郵附件為一份文件，載有馬格尼茨基法案的資料。黎同日回覆電郵：「很棒的主意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上指，他早前聘請惠頓協助介紹美國議員給他認識，而非聘請惠頓作為說客，而惠頓當時是主動在電郵上提供策略方面的意見。法官李運騰提及黎回覆：「很棒的主意」；黎則解釋，惠頓提供意見，因此便說是很好的主意，就如表達感謝。李素蘭問黎，惠頓是純粹自願（pure voluntary）提供意見？黎回答：「一定是。（Definitely）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;paul-wolfowitz-稱受法官郭偉健啟發而問及馬格尼茨基法案&quot;&gt;Paul Wolfowitz 稱受法官郭偉健「啟發」而問及馬格尼茨基法案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Wolfowitz 其後回覆電郵，表示他原本問有關馬格尼茨基法案，是因為「受到這個公然偏袒的香港法官郭偉健啟發（inspired by this blatantly biased Hong Kong judge, WK Kwok）」，又指「即使他好像是小人物（Even though he may seem like small fry）」，但是跟進那些執行指令的人，可能更有效。Paul 稱他亦會跟進退休警官，並提到時任新疆維吾爾自治區黨委書記陳全國「必定是一個制裁對象（should clearly be a candidate for sanctions.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;電郵並引用黃之鋒社交媒體帖文，以英語指法官郭偉健就連儂牆斬人案判刑時，稱讚被告為「高尚情操」，並作出評論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，Paul 在電郵中上述人士需受制裁，問黎是否同意。黎則稱他沒有表達過任何意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月27日，Jack Keane 向黎傳送電郵，稱讚黎在《霍士新聞》訪問中的言論很好。控方提及黎於5月26日曾接受《霍士新聞》訪問，稱美國應對中國官員實施制裁、凍結銀行帳戶，以及停止向中國輸出技術等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提議，黎所要求的「幫助」，其實是要求美國實施制裁。黎則否認，強調自己只是要求「一般的幫助」，而未有要求他們做什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎電郵曾談及凍結官員帳戶-承認期望特朗普作出行動和懲罰&quot;&gt;黎電郵曾談及凍結官員帳戶 承認期望特朗普作出行動和懲罰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月27日，Jack Keane 向黎、Mark Simon 等人轉發《彭博》文章「U.S. Weighs Sanctions on Chinese Officials, Firms Over Hong Kong」。黎發送電郵回覆：「我認為終止《香港人權與民主法案》只會傷害香港的剩餘價值，而且對於阻礙他們行動效果很小。最有效的方法是凍結中國官員在美國和西方銀行的貪污帳戶。所有高級官員都會害怕到可能嘗試延遲頒布國安法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，Mark Simon 在電郵中表示曾與美國國安委的人溝通，並談論特朗普與拜登之間的選戰。2020年5月28日即翌日，黎發送電郵指：「這會推動到特朗普做實事，不像拜登的辭藻。當拜登只有空談的時候，特朗普可以用一系列對於中國的制裁和懲罰，帶動選舉的討論。這樣可以創造不同。」控方問黎是否期望特朗普作出行動和懲罰？黎同意，並指他在電郵已經說得很清楚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎批控方真相似乎未能打動到你&quot;&gt;黎批控方：真相似乎未能打動到你&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月9日，Jack Keane 向眾人傳送電郵，內容乃轉發新聞「Hong Kongers say Taiwan is their first choice as exile looms（當流亡逼近，香港人說台灣是首選）」；5月31日，黎以電郵回覆：「That’s true.（這是對的。）」、「With US greater military support, people feel more secure to live and invest in Taiwan. Things are looking up.（當美國有更大的軍事支援，人們更安心地在台灣居住和投資。情況開始好轉。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎提及美國的軍事支援，目的是想向 Jack Keane 重申美國應向台灣提供更多軍事支援。黎否認，強調他只是談論移民議題，若果美國提供更多軍事支援的話，在台灣的人便會更安心居住和投資。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑黎「突然之間（out of the blue）」提起軍事支援。黎堅稱不是「突然之間」，他說出這番言論是因為若有美國支援，人們便會更安心地定居台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，黎的電郵說法，與2017年7月黎替博爾頓準備的筆記，當中所談及美國增加在台灣的軍事存在（military presence）的說法一致。黎則稱相關事件已經發生了。控方指黎希望相關情況持續；黎則稱他沒有這樣說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎突向控方說：「真相似乎未能打動到你（Truth seems to have no bearing on you.）」，接著譏諷道：「你真不受拘束！（You’re so free!）」、「你真有創意！（You’re so creative!）」、「你是一個很棒的檢控官！（You’re great as a prosecutor.）」法官杜麗冰則打斷黎，叫黎只需要回答問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年7月27日，黎再度以電郵向 Jack Keane 說：「台灣的投資需要美國更大的軍事支援，使它更加出眾。我們見到更多投資者近來湧進台灣，因為美國的更多軍事支援。台灣的投資界對於美國的軍事支援是很敏感⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上解釋，上述電郵是說若果美國增加軍事支援，台灣人會更安心地居住和投資。控方質疑，黎在較早前的說法，卻是指美國的軍事存在可以制衡中國的好戰態度（belligerence）？黎僅回應：「當你將說話塞進我的口，我是不會回答你。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;人大528決定之後-黎訊息稱懲罰中國是制止危機的唯一方法&quot;&gt;人大5.28決定之後 黎訊息稱：「懲罰中國是制止危機的唯一方法」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，Mark Simon 於2020年5月29日創立WhatsApp 群組「DC Dems」，成員包括他、黎、郭明瀚和 Paul Wolfowitz。同日，Mark Simon 向群組發送訊息，稱在美國國務院向 David Feith 打聽到數項消息，包括香港不會再維持特殊地位、「在簽證、官員家人、接觸大學方面強烈同意」等。Mark Simon 另一則訊息指蓬佩奧昨日的記者會「全都關於中國如何侵害香港自治」，又指「今晚6時有記者會，有多一些中層人士講及制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，Mark Simon 另傳送訊息，就美國是否應該有「非常寬容的移民政策」，讓香港人來美國定居，冀向郭明瀚和 Paul Wolfowitz 徵詢意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎向群組傳送訊息，重申在現階段最強的制裁是凍結中國官員的貪污帳戶，又指廢除香港法案會損害香港的剩餘價值，只會傷害香港人，因為明顯地習近平為了他一個人而放棄了香港。黎另一則訊息提到：「懲罰中國是制止危機的唯一方法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指稱，從上述訊息可見，黎智英當時已經知悉全國人大常委會有關制訂國安法的「5.28決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎為了滿足美國的需求-不介意犧牲香港的利益&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎為了滿足美國的需求 不介意犧牲香港的利益&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月29日，黎向群組傳送另一則訊息，說：「我同意懲罰中國而非傷害香港。香港愈受到傷害，它對於中國來說便愈少剩餘價值，中國更容易放棄香港。在中國經濟最差的時候，中國需要香港作為通往外界的渠道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎當時的想法仍然是不希望傷害香港、想香港維持有特殊地位？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，可是黎的想法在國安法生效之後改變了，他希望取消香港特殊地位。黎指想法「類似」，因為如果香港因為國安法實施而「完蛋了」，便什麼也沒有所謂了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方重提早前主問證供，2020年7月15日，蓬佩奧助手 Mary Kissel 經 Mark Simon 詢問黎對於撤銷香港特殊地位的立場，黎當時回覆：「我是說撤銷香港特殊地位是不需要的，因為在國安法下，香港怎樣也好都會完蛋。重點不在於香港而在於中國。制裁中國以阻止她打壓香港。但是就此思考後，我認為他們撤回香港特殊地位是正確的，因為一旦美國和中國之間脫鈎，香港會是中國的出口。若然關閉這個中國的出口的話，會更輕易地迫使中國回應美國的要求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎的立場變得更加「進取（aggressive）」。黎回應：「不，我只是採取悲觀的想法。」他解釋：「如果香港完蛋了，什麼也沒有所謂了。」控方問黎，他的證供一直說要爭取香港的利益。惟黎指因為香港怎樣也好已經完蛋，反問：「還有什麼可以爭取？」控方問黎，所以他不介意取消特殊地位？黎同意，又指沒有東西可以再失去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認其說法屬「攬炒」：「香港不是因為我們而被犧牲，而是因為國安法實施而被犧牲。」控方最後指出，黎為了滿足美國的需求，不介意犧牲香港的利益。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;因農曆新年關係，下星期不會開庭，案件將於2月3日續審，屆時控方繼續盤問黎。法官杜麗冰祝大家新年快樂。周天行亦回應：「祝法庭來年健康及繁榮。」&lt;/p&gt;

In late 2024, a group of U.S. technology policy and national security scholars, including the four authors of this paper, traveled to the UAE to understand the country’s AI strategy, its position amid U.S.-China competition, and Microsoft’s $1.5 billion deal with Emirati national AI champion Group 42 Holding Ltd. (G42). The visit combined meetings arranged through the authors’ existing networks with those suggested and facilitated by the UAE embassy in Washington, D.C. This paper presents the authors’ following eight assessments about the opportunities and risks of U.S.-UAE cooperation in AI:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The UAE’s commitment to AI represents a genuine national priority with broad leadership support and ambitious economic targets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Emirati officials claim to be “decoupling” from China in AI while acknowledging that they are trying to maintain broader economic ties with both China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Despite the UAE’s stated commitment to U.S. partnership in AI, China is exerting significant pressure to reinforce its technological influence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While Emirati officials accept the national security justification for U.S. export controls, they express frustration with the United States’ implementation of these controls and the UAE’s country classification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s $1.5 billion investment in G42 reflects its strategy to secure leadership in global AI cloud infrastructure and expand its AI applications portfolio worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G42’s ambitions extend far beyond its Microsoft partnership. The company desires to build 10 to 100 times more data center capacity (independently or with additional partners) than outlined in its current Microsoft agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to G42 and Microsoft representatives, the security controls at the G42 data center the authors toured match typical U.S. commercial standards. While the authors did not find evidence to dispute these claims, the broader question remains whether such commercial-grade controls—whether in the United States or UAE—will prove sufficient as AI capabilities advance and state-sponsored threats evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The United States faces two key questions: how to engage with “swing states” in the U.S.-China technology competition, and specifically how to approach the UAE’s ambitious AI aspirations. While the immediate decision centers on AI chip exports, this choice will inform the broader strategy of how to diffuse U.S. technology—from AI chips to cloud services—globally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global leadership in AI remains the United States’ to lose, but continued U.S. leadership is by no means assured. The United States can support Microsoft-led projects in the UAE while remaining cautious of endorsing the UAE’s broader AI ambitions. U.S. policymakers and AI executives should maintain a healthy realism about the UAE’s vested interests in hedging its bets between the United States and China. They should ask tough questions—such as what the Emirati government is doing to ensure decoupling from China in AI by tech companies other than G42—and scrutinize the UAE’s answers. For now, however, proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years have sparked a global race to develop and control the next generation of AI models, which a large and influential group of senior AI executives and leading researchers believe will be a meaningful step toward human-level intelligence. If they are correct, such technology would have transformative implications for both U.S. national security and the global economy. Leading U.S. companies are making extraordinary and unprecedented investments, reflecting their belief that such a technological revolution is nearly at hand. For instance, according to October 2024 financial disclosures, tech giants Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta are expected to surpass $300 billion in 2025 capital expenditures on AI—a projected 25 percent increase from 2024 and nearly double the 2023 figure. These four companies are hardly alone; in November 2024, Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly raised $6 billion to purchase 100,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs, also known as AI chips) for the company’s Colossus supercomputer. In December 2024, xAI announced plans to expand the facility to 1 million chips, which could require another $54 billion (assuming consistent chip models and pricing). Meanwhile, the United States and China are locked in a fierce struggle over critical elements of the AI and semiconductor supply chain and are accordingly investing tens of billions annually in building domestic AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, the wealthy and increasingly influential UAE has inserted itself into the global AI race. The UAE government has identified AI as a critical opportunity to diversify its economy for a post-oil future in line with global climate pledges. At the same time, the country’s strategic advantages—abundant energy, rapid construction, and close connectivity to markets in the rest of the Middle East and Global South—are highly attractive to U.S. AI companies looking to expand AI infrastructure worldwide. U.S. and Emirati companies have already announced billions of dollars in partnerships. On January 21, 2025, OpenAI announced plans for a $500 billion private sector investment vehicle called The Stargate Project to build U.S. AI infrastructure for OpenAI alongside Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX and Japanese investment firm Softbank. In September 2024, MGX and U.S. firms Microsoft, BlackRock, and Global Infrastructure Partners also launched a fund for AI data centers and supporting infrastructure with an investment potential of $100 billion. Additionally, in April 2024, Microsoft announced a $1.5 billion investment deal with Emirati AI national champion Group 42 Holding Ltd. (G42). At a government level, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (also known as MBZ) met with U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington in September 2024, culminating in a bilateral AI cooperation agreement between the two nations. Emirati leadership has also participated in investment talks with other U.S. industry leaders, such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, to support a $7 trillion project to expand global AI infrastructure, including in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts in Washington view the United States’ growing partnership with the UAE in AI as a critical opportunity to compete with China. The United States’ lead in AI—especially in AI chips—could offer an opportunity to coax the UAE and other “swing states,” which are agnostic to U.S.-China competition, away from China’s sprawling technological reach. The Biden administration’s decisionmaking rested on the assumption that foreign governments will be willing to jump through procedural hoops to access superior U.S. technology as they seek to develop their own indigenous AI capabilities. By offering access to U.S. compute power with strings attached—via export license conditions—the theory goes that the United States can regain geopolitical influence in regions where it is slipping. This bargaining position is particularly strong given that the United States can offer a comprehensive technological package—from advanced AI chips to cutting-edge models and cloud infrastructure—that China currently cannot match at scale. These export conditions could secure commitments not only for enhanced cybersecurity but also for the responsible development and deployment of AI. In the case of the UAE, this strategy has, for now, proven effective. In response to U.S. pressure, G42 has reportedly divested from Chinese technology firms, stripped Chinese tech giant Huawei’s equipment from its data centers, and implemented strict security measures (see points two and seven of this paper) to secure shipments of Nvidia H100 chips to the UAE. The U.S. government reportedly approved the export licenses of these chips to a Microsoft-operated facility in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are substantial risks to exporting large numbers of advanced AI chips to a nondemocratic country with strong ties to China and deploying leading U.S. AI models there. Unlike traditional technology transfers, AI chips can be accessed remotely, meaning their computing power could be diverted even if the physical hardware remains secure. Furthermore, hosting model weights abroad increases the risk of data exfiltration, particularly if data center security and IT infrastructure prove inadequate. Some U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns that such transfers could allow entities with connections to the Chinese Communist Party and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) backdoor access to U.S. AI technology and know-how, thereby evading U.S. export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these concerns, the UAE has eagerly voiced its commitment to working with the United States in AI. In June 2024, UAE Minister of State for AI Omar Al Olama stated, “The honest truth is in the AI space today, I think we need to be selective of who we work with. . . . But on the AI front, I think there is going to be complete alignment between the UAE and the U.S.” At the Dubai GITEX Global Expo in October 2024, G42 CEO Peng Xiao, a former U.S. national who renounced his U.S. citizenship for Emirati citizenship, similarly remarked that the UAE’s relationship with the United States “cannot be stronger.” He added, “We’ve shown from [the] UAE side how transparent we are, and how we can guarantee the safety and security of this technology even when [it is] being deployed and used here in [the] UAE.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate question is whether the United States can trust the UAE’s claims, especially when the stakes may be nothing less than leadership of a new geopolitical order. On the one hand, the United States must ensure that China cannot access U.S. technology and that the UAE is not simply hedging its bets to secure the best AI chips it can obtain by playing the United States and China against each other. More broadly, if AI reaches human-level intelligence, the United States should be cautious not to offshore its advantage too quickly. On the other hand, without rapid expansion of AI and energy infrastructure beyond current U.S. capabilities—or a plan to entice emerging powers to choose U.S. technology over China’s—the United States risks losing its global technological lead altogether. These are the kinds of tough trade-offs that the second Trump administration, which has vowed to “Make America First in AI,” must now face as it decides whether to continue approving export licenses to the UAE, at what rate, and under what conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, a delegation of U.S. technology policy and national security scholars traveled to the UAE to better understand the country’s AI ambitions, its position amidst U.S.-China competition, and Microsoft’s deal with G42. Prior to the trip, CSIS experts identified stakeholders and arranged meetings with help and independently from the UAE embassy in Washington, D.C., and solicited input from the other delegation members. The UAE embassy also suggested government and private sector stakeholders that may be of interest for the delegation to meet, which the delegation was at liberty to accept or reject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the authors’ key judgments from the trip based on private interviews with top-level UAE government officials, senior Microsoft and G42 executives, a site visit to a G42/Microsoft data center, and conversations with U.S. and allied government officials. The paper concludes by presenting two strategic questions (point eight) to U.S. policymakers about engaging with the UAE’s AI ambitions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-implications-for-us-ai-leadership&quot;&gt;Key Implications for U.S. AI Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-the-uaes-commitment-to-ai-represents-a-genuine-national-priority-with-broad-leadership-support-and-ambitious-economic-targets&quot;&gt;1. The UAE’s commitment to AI represents a genuine national priority with broad leadership support and ambitious economic targets.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many governments notionally aspire to be global leaders in AI, few are as genuinely serious as the UAE. Total Emirati AI investment is not publicly disclosed, but the figure is clearly in the many tens (to possibly low hundreds) of billions of dollars. In March 2024, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, G42, and the UAE state-backed Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Technology Council announced the creation of MGX, an AI investment vehicle expected to eventually reach $100 billion in assets. Six months later in September, MGX, together with U.S. firms BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, and Microsoft, launched a global AI infrastructure fund with an initial $30 billion in private equity capital and $100 billion in investment potential. More recently, on January 21, 2025, OpenAI announced that MGX will be one of the initial four equity funders for the new “Stargate Project,” which plans to invest $500 billion in building U.S. AI infrastructure for OpenAI over the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underpinning these investments is a real conviction that profound economic and social transformation from AI is near. Top UAE government strategists told the authors that the UAE aims to have 20 percent of its non-oil GDP come from AI by 2031, in line with the dates set by the UAE National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2031, the government’s principal AI strategy document. The strategy projects that AI will contribute $91 billion (AED 335 billion) to the Emirati economy within six years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one foreign government official told the two CSIS authors that several UAE leaders are “true believers” in artificial general intelligence (AGI), a currently hypothetical scenario in which AI meets or exceeds human levels of intelligence across all or most domains. According to this source, UAE National Security Advisor and G42 Chair Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan believes that AI will be able to perform any human-level job in the near future and that this will be an economic and national security revolution. Though Al Nahyan has not made any public statements on this issue, he has repeatedly met with top AI executives who have been outspoken on AGI—including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang—as part of ongoing partnerships between G42, the UAE government, and the three U.S. companies. OpenAI’s press announcement of the Stargate Project, of which MGX is a key investor, concludes with the statement that “All of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AI – and in particular AGI – for the benefit of all humanity.” Al Nahyan is the head of a reportedly $1.5 trillion sovereign wealth empire and embodies a tech-guru persona that puts him in the same orbit as many of the world’s largest tech CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-uae-officials-claim-to-be-decoupling-from-china-in-ai-while-acknowledging-that-they-are-trying-to-maintain-broader-economic-ties-with-both-china-and-the-united-states&quot;&gt;2. UAE officials claim to be decoupling from China in AI while acknowledging that they are trying to maintain broader economic ties with both China and the United States.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple UAE government officials told the authors that they see decoupling from China in AI as a critical condition for cooperation with the United States. In a private meeting, one top-level government official made this clear: “Working with the U.S. on sensitive technology—for that, decoupling is the right word. I think we have to do it; in that isolated part of our economy, it must be done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several other officials echoed this sentiment. One high-ranking government strategist described cooperation on AI as a zero-sum game in the context of U.S.-China competition, stating, “We put all our eggs in one basket working with the U.S.” Another stated, “This relationship [with the United States] is very critical to us. We take the trust that the U.S. puts in us very seriously.” They concluded that, to meet its long-term goal of cooperating with the United States in AI, the UAE’s government understands that it must take action to enforce decoupling from Chinese AI technology in order to pursue its larger AI-related goals—even if it means hurting Emirati firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emirati officials principally cited G42’s divestment from Chinese companies as evidence of decoupling from China in AI. Prominent U.S. national security officials have openly criticized G42’s ties to China, including its portfolio companies’ ties to Chinese military and intelligence firms, as well as Xiao’s personal affiliations with companies that contribute to Chinese military-civil fusion and human rights abuses. In January 2025, Wired also published a feature on G42 Chair and National Security Advisor Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, which detailed years of covert hacking and mass-surveillance operations orchestrated by the Emirati government and state-controlled firm DarkMatter to monitor journalists, human rights activists, and other members of state opposition. Following a public scandal in 2019, DarkMatter was dissolved and reportedly subsumed in large parts by G42.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat these claims, G42 argues that it has demonstrated its commitment to the United States by publicly cutting ties with China. As early as December 2023, Xiao told the Financial Times, “In order for us to further our relationship—which we cherish—with our U.S. partners, we simply cannot do much more with [previous] Chinese partners.” Xiao added, “We cannot work with both sides. We can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one senior G42 representative told the authors that G42 had “willingly” divested its passive investments in Chinese tech firms ByteDance, xFusion, and Honor in November 2023 to “disambiguate” G42’s position vis-à-vis China and demonstrate transparency. The statement supports reporting from the Financial Times in February 2024, in which 42X Fund, G42’s $10 billion investment arm, told the outlet that it had “divested from all its investments in China.” G42 also said that it is taking pains to strengthen security measures in its data centers, including additional security controls (see points four and seven) and scrapping what one of its representatives told the authors was $1.7–$2 billion worth of Chinese hardware, including from Huawei, from its facilities (although one G42 representative admitted that a sizable portion of the Chinese equipment had already significantly depreciated in value by the time it was removed from the data centers). Microsoft officials told the authors that their staff have personally visited G42 facilities and seen Huawei equipment being stripped and discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are several reasons to be skeptical of G42 and the UAE’s decoupling claims. For one, China has raised no public issue with G42 stripping Chinese hardware from their facilities (a peculiar silence given its retaliation in response to similar actions from other countries in the past), which could suggest some kind of quiet agreement between the two nations. For another, in July 2024, Bloomberg reported that G42’s divestments from Chinese firms were transferred to a new Abu Dhabi investment vehicle, Lunate. Lunate, like G42 and multiple Emirati sovereign wealth funds, is overseen by the UAE’s national security advisor. The transfer of investments raises serious questions as to whether G42—and the wider UAE—is serious about divesting from Chinese companies in AI. Lunate publicly advertises that it has $105 billion of assets under management, including one S&amp;amp;P China/Hong Kong Exchange Traded Fund with top holdings in Chinese tech companies Alibaba (27.7 percent), Meituan (18.9 percent), and Xiaomi (8.10 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For another, it is not obvious to what extent the UAE is expanding decoupling from China in cutting-edge technology, including AI, to other major Emirati tech companies. G42 is undoubtedly viewed by the UAE’s government as a national champion. Through a deeply interwoven relationship between G42 leadership and the government, the company has become a symbol for the UAE’s AI development writ large. There are, however, other Emirati companies that merit scrutiny, particularly those working with U.S. and Chinese companies simultaneously. In March 2022, for instance, Huawei and UAE state-owned telecommunications company e&amp;amp; (formerly Etisalat Group) launched a 5G cloud edge computing platform called 5G Edge Box. The announcement came just months after e&amp;amp; launched a similar 5G edge cloud computing platform with Microsoft. According to Microsoft, the platform will deploy “Microsoft Azure Stack Edge to offer 5G, IoT, and AI applications.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e&amp;amp; continues to collaborate with both Huawei and Microsoft to provide 5G cloud edge networks. In February 2024, e&amp;amp; signed a new memorandum of understanding with Huawei to build energy-efficient networks in the UAE, which states that “e&amp;amp; will continue to work with Huawei to achieve network decarbonisation across its ICT infrastructure, including . . . data centers.” It is unclear from public statements to what extent Huawei’s “network decarbonization” of e&amp;amp; information and communications technology infrastructure could affect e&amp;amp;’s current or future U.S.-operated data centers in the UAE. For example, in October 2024, e&amp;amp; and Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced a $1 billion cloud agreement, which “combines AWS’s cloud infrastructure and solutions . . . with e&amp;amp;’s network capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as of 2021, e&amp;amp; owns 40 percent equity in wholesale data center developer and leasing operator Khazna, the main developer of Microsoft’s AI data centers in the UAE (described in more detail in point five below). G42 owns the remaining 60 percent and claims Khazna as a G42 portfolio company. Figure 1 illustrates G42’s portfolio companies and examples of foreign partnerships, and Figure 2 maps G42’s portfolio companies across the AI value chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the realm of technology, the UAE’s relationship with China runs deep. On November 1, 2024, China and the UAE celebrated their 40th year of diplomatic relations, marked by a public statement from Chinese President Xi Jinping in which he described the two countries as “good friends who trust each other and good partners for win-win cooperation.” UAE President MBZ likewise said, “The UAE remains committed to consolidating and developing a comprehensive strategic partnership with China.” Senior Emirati officials speak of a golden era of Chinese-Emirati cooperation, a sentiment echoed by the Chinese ambassador to the UAE who described this as the “best period of time since we established diplomatic relationships in 1984.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, China is the UAE’s top trading partner, with UAE government estimates valuing non-oil trade at $82 billion in 2023, a 34 percent increase from 2021. Despite a show of partnership with the United States in AI, the UAE continues to work closely with the Chinese government and technology firms in sensitive areas such as 5G, drones, and other military technologies. For instance, the UAE’s Air Force and China’s PLA Air Force conducted a joint military exercise in July 2024 in Xinjiang province, China, which may have allowed the PLA access to intelligence about Western combat aircraft capabilities. The joint exercise came just months before the Biden administration designated the UAE a “major defense partner” of the United States, expanding bilateral defense and security cooperation through joint military exercises among other measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, one top-level government strategist privately called the idea of a complete decoupling from China “anathema” to UAE policymakers. Because Emirati policy is driven by geoeconomics rather than geopolitics, the strategist said, the UAE will continue to develop a strong trade relationship with China at the same time as with the United States. UAE Assistant Minister for Advanced Science and Technology Omran Sharaf publicly stated in a November 2024 interview on AI and diplomacy that this delicate navigation between two great powers is what other third-party countries are “trying to learn from the UAE model.” While countries caught between U.S.-China competition are increasingly under pressure to choose between U.S. and Chinese technology and values, the “countries who are able to navigate that the best are the ones who get the most out of the opportunities that are there globally, whether economic or other areas that involve science and tech,” Sharaf said. This thinking suggests a more careful balancing of UAE diplomatic relations between the United States and China (including in technology) than the zero-sum commitment to the United States that other UAE government officials have described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE’s approach to decoupling from China requires careful distinction between rhetoric and reality. While G42’s actions demonstrate company-level separation from Chinese technology in AI, the broader picture is more nuanced. First, what constitutes the scope of this decoupling remains unclear—whether it applies narrowly to AI or extends to all advanced technology sectors such as 5G. Second, the transfer of Chinese investments from G42 to Lunate suggests more of a reorganization than true divestment. Third, other major Emirati tech companies continue to maintain simultaneous partnerships with both U.S. and Chinese firms. This selective decoupling approach is perhaps unsurprising—even the United States maintains extensive economic ties with China while restricting specific strategic technologies. The critical question is not whether the UAE will completely decouple from China, which would be an unrealistic expectation, but whether it can establish credible boundaries in strategic technology sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-despite-the-uaes-stated-commitment-to-us-partnership-in-ai-china-is-exerting-significant-pressure-to-reinforce-its-technological-influence-in-the-region&quot;&gt;3. Despite the UAE’s stated commitment to U.S. partnership in AI, China is exerting significant pressure to reinforce its technological influence in the region.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government and Chinese companies, notably Huawei, are reportedly spreading the message that U.S. delays in approving exports of AI chips to the UAE prove that the United States is a selfish and unreliable partner. One UAE government official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs privately noted that China is putting a great deal of pressure on the UAE government to lure them away from the United States in strategic tech, posing a tough diplomacy challenge for the UAE. Similarly, a senior Microsoft representative said that Huawei is trying to leverage the United States’ slow approval to ship semiconductors to the UAE “to the extreme” in its effort to get UAE officials back on board. The representative pointed to Huawei’s top “diamond” sponsorship of the UAE’s flagship GITEX Global Expo, held in Dubai in October 2024, as evidence that China has not given up on the goal of being the dominant AI supplier to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One government official said that while Chinese technology is inferior to that of the United States, the UAE must get advanced technology from somewhere to boost its competitiveness. In late 2024, the Chinese firm Alibaba released a new open-weight large language model (LLM), Qwen2.5. Senior executives at two top-tier U.S. AI firms told one CSIS author that Qwen2.5’s release led them to dramatically reassess the extent to which the United States has a meaningful technological lead in AI. Specifically, one executive told the CSIS author that “the conventional wisdom that U.S. AI firms have an 18-month lead on Chinese firms is clearly wrong and needs to be updated.” Jack Clark, a cofounder of Anthropic, wrote that “Qwen models outperform rival Chinese [computer code-generating AI] models from companies like Yi and DeepSeek and approach or in some cases exceed the performance of powerful proprietary models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI’s o1 models.” More recently, impressive jumps in the performance of Deepseek’s “V3” model have fueled concerns about China’s advancement of frontier model capabilities. On January 21, 2025, former OpenAI Senior Advisor Miles Brundage tweeted, “Stargate + related efforts could help the U.S. stay ahead of China, but China will still have their own superintelligence(s) no more than a year later than the US, absent e.g. a war.” These statements are important because Emirati officials repeatedly stated in private meetings that their perception of U.S. technological leadership was the key reason for their willingness to decouple from China in AI technology. If the United States were to lose this strategic advantage, the UAE could decide to redirect its attention to Chinese technology firms, much like it did with 5G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, UAE, G42, and Microsoft leadership cited several reasons the UAE would not—or could not—switch so easily. First, while China is making progress in some areas like AI models, the United States maintains critical advantages in the broader AI technology stack, particularly in advanced chips and the scale of production needed for large AI infrastructure. Model performance is just one metric of technological leadership—China continues to lag significantly in AI chip development and production capability due to U.S. export controls. These controls limit both the quality of chips China can produce and, critically, the quantity they can manufacture at scale, making it difficult for China to match U.S. capacity in providing the computing infrastructure needed for advanced AI development. While model performance comparisons may narrow, China’s limited ability to produce advanced AI chips at scale could preserve U.S. strategic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, one senior Microsoft executive argued that even if the UAE wanted to, switching back to Huawei AI infrastructure may soon become prohibitively technically challenging. Microsoft officials claimed that if the United States approves Microsoft’s exports of AI chips, they can “lock” the UAE into a U.S.-led technological ecosystem, allegedly due to high switching costs between different cloud and AI infrastructures as well as network effects for AI-enabled software applications. Creating technological lock-in becomes particularly powerful when combined with China’s limited ability to provide comparable computing infrastructure at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this claim proves true, it would suggest that the United States could exploit its current technological lead to secure an enduring advantage over China in the next few years. The authors are not in a position to assess the accuracy of the executive’s claim definitively, and it should be regarded with some degree of skepticism: Large AI companies have deep pools of engineering talent that they could use to overcome lock-in, if necessary. Additionally, the fact that companies like Anthropic use multiple cloud providers for their AI models—with Anthropic even beginning to use AWS’s custom chips—suggests that while switching and working across infrastructure platforms may be difficult for many companies, it is not prohibitively difficult for those as well-resourced as Anthropic, OpenAI, or G42.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G42’s own strategy further illustrates this point: the company aims to “abstract the silicon away” through partnerships with multiple chip providers. It is already the largest customer of AI chip startup Cerebras and is running one of its clusters in California, while also recently partnering with Qualcomm to procure AI chips. In several conversations, representatives from Core42, G42’s sovereign cloud and AI infrastructure portfolio company, emphasized their goal to build on top of different types of AI chips and abstract it away for their customers. This diversification of chip suppliers and infrastructure suggests that while AI chips alone may not provide an insurmountable competitive moat (though Qualcomm and Cerebras are both subject to U.S. export controls), offering a comprehensive technology stack—including chips, cloud infrastructure, and AI applications—could create more durable strategic advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-while-emirati-officials-accept-the-national-security-justification-for-us-export-controls-they-express-frustration-with-the-united-states-implementation-of-these-controls-and-the-uaes-country-classification&quot;&gt;4. While Emirati officials accept the national security justification for U.S. export controls, they express frustration with the United States’ implementation of these controls and the UAE’s country classification.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several UAE government and AI company representatives readily acknowledged and agreed with the underlying reasons for the United States’ concern in exporting AI chips to the UAE in private meetings. Most notably, one UAE government official said that the UAE understands that the United States cannot “shoot itself in the foot” regarding AI. The official stated that the United States has a right to place restrictions given what the official described as the “dual-use nature” of the technology and the boost that it will give to military and intelligence capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 15, 2024, in a public interview at the GITEX Global Expo, G42’s Xiao echoed the UAE government official’s words. Xiao was asked whether he felt that the United States is using then-proposed caps on chip exports to some countries, including in the Middle East, as leverage for achieving its diplomatic goals. Xiao responded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I cannot read the mind of the U.S. policymakers, but in many ways, I understand their position. . . . When a nation, or even when a company or individual [has] invented a new technology, it’s only natural [that] you want to hold on to that edge . . . to make sure [that] because this new technology is so cutting edge, before you figure out how to properly use it, it cannot be possibly misused by others. So, in many ways, I understand that position [the] U.S. government has taken. At the same time from our side—we’ve shown from [the] UAE side how transparent we are and how we can guarantee the safety and security of this technology, even when [it is] being deployed and used here in [the] UAE. So, I think that door is opening up for us to do a lot more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another top G42 executive privately agreed with Xiao, saying that he recognizes that G42 is not the target of U.S. export controls but rather “just collateral damage” in U.S. competition with China. The executive expressed support for an “N-1” strategy, in which the United States maintains exclusive access to the most cutting-edge AI chips for a certain period before allowing them to be exported abroad. The executive said that with sole ownership of the latest and most powerful chips for six months, for example, the United States could benefit from enhanced performance first and exercise greater control over AI diffusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the executive said that G42 has implemented strict controls to demonstrate as much compliance and transparency to the United States as possible. According to Semafor reporting from September 2024, Microsoft-operated G42 data centers use military-grade encryption and are audited by U.S. Department of Defense contractors to test for potential security breaches that could be exploited by China. The Microsoft deal also reportedly forbids G42 from using Microsoft services or AI chips for surveillance and mandates that it seek permission from Microsoft to share the technology with other governments or militaries. On top of these controls, the G42 executive stated that G42 has applied even stricter security controls on its data centers than is required by the U.S. government and Microsoft (see point seven). According to G42 documents shared with the authors, additional controls include but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standard data center information security policies and procedures (such as personnel security, cybersecurity, and campus security measures);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;U.S. export license requirements (such as entity list restrictions, conformity inspections, U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security notification of noncompliance, record retention, and computer security monitoring);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;over 100 controls voluntarily adopted by G42 from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework SP 800-53 security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;enhanced customer due diligence procedures, including rigorous Know-Your-Customer requirements with particular attention to customers who train frontier models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these controls appear to be standard security measures commonly implemented by commercial data centers and major cloud providers. Without significantly more detailed information about their implementation—as cybersecurity effectiveness often lies in technical specifics—it is difficult to assess whether these controls represent meaningful improvements or adequately address the unique threats posed by state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A G42 executive indicated that while these controls are necessary to demonstrate compliance and cooperation with the United States, they are placing a heavy financial burden on the company. The executive stated that “our costs are too high at the moment due to compliance,” which is causing G42 to lose customers to other companies without such strict controls. The executive concluded that they would like to see the United States standardize compliance requirements and apply them to companies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple UAE government officials also voiced frustration that the United States’ tight restrictions are unjust given the UAE’s demonstrated willingness to play by the United States’ rules. One official said that the UAE’s categorization as a “D:4” country on the Department of Commerce Control List Country Chart (alongside countries like Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Yemen) is unfair, objecting to being “grouped with our crazy neighbors,” given its demonstrated cooperation with the United States in AI and other sensitive technologies in the past. The official pointed to the UAE’s successful collaboration with the United States on space and nuclear projects as proof of this commitment to technological security. For example, in January 2024, NASA announced that the UAE’s Mohamed bin Rashid Space Centre will provide crew members and an airlock module for its new lunar space station, Gateway. Similarly, in January 2009, the United States and the UAE signed a so-called 123 Agreement for bilateral cooperation on peaceful nuclear energy, which remains in effect today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, UAE officials seek clearer guidance on pathways to improved country designation and more consistent, long-term policies that transcend changes in U.S. administrations. One official said that U.S. export controls are clear on an entity-to-entity basis but not at a countrywide level, making the government hesitant to take further action to decouple from China until the United States gives it a clear road map as to what it will take to move up the country designation list. Furthermore, this official said that the United States’ constantly changing export requirements makes real cooperation near impossible, stating, “We respect the U.S. system, we understand your concerns, but as a partner we need stability.” Another top-level official similarly stated that changes in U.S. administrations’ strategies toward China make it unclear how the United States expects the UAE and “countries like us” to navigate their relationship with both powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials stated that the recently announced Validated End User program for data centers represents a promising step toward establishing a more predictable framework for technology transfers while maintaining necessary security safeguards. The U.S. government has since (in January 2024) announced a Framework for AI Diffusion that builds upon this VEU program, though this development occurred after the authors’ field research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-microsofts-15-billion-investment-in-g42-reflects-a-strategic-pivot-toward-securing-leadership-in-global-ai-cloud-inference-infrastructure-and-ai-applications&quot;&gt;5. Microsoft’s $1.5 billion investment in G42 reflects a strategic pivot toward securing leadership in global AI cloud inference infrastructure and AI applications.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s all inference, right?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, Microsoft has faced considerable scrutiny from the Department of Commerce, Congress, and U.S. national security agencies over its deal with G42 and its efforts to secure shipments of Nvidia AI chips to the UAE. This deal speaks to Microsoft’s evolving strategy for global AI leadership, which involves establishing a strong position in AI inference infrastructure to run AI models rather than an exclusive focus on training them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s FY 2025 Q1 earnings call on October 30, 2024, with CEO Satya Nadella provides some important clues to Microsoft’s views on the increasing importance of inference (referring to the general process in which an AI model is deployed post-training). In response to an analyst’s question about Microsoft’s strategy for investing in AI models, Nadella responded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Capital outlay for training . . . is going to be rate limited by your monetization of inference in a given generation, right? So just like in the past, we would allocate capital to build out cloud based on the demand signal we were seeing and then we would project the demand, and that’s what we would build it for. So, you can think of training essentially as that, right, which is you’re building the next-generation model so that then you have a more capable model that then drives more inference demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s interest in AI models as a way to boost cloud inference demand may help to explain its partial split from OpenAI over the last year; at one time, Microsoft needed to jumpstart AI model demand for its cloud service to run models. However, as October’s earning call suggests, demand is now booming and self-reinforcing such that it might not require continued Microsoft investment and allegiance to an individual model maker. On a December 2024 BG2 podcast episode, Nadella went as far as to say that there will be no one AI model to rule them all in the future. He said, “I don’t think it’s going to be winner-take-all. . . . The world will demand, even ex-China, multiple providers of frontier models distributed all over the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Microsoft may view inference as the ultimate moneymaker in AI. In the October 2024 earnings call, one analyst asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Analyst: These models are getting bigger, more expensive, but you also pointed out how in the inference phase, we’re likely to get paid. How does that cycle look like in inference for Microsoft?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella: I mean the good news for us is that we’re not waiting for that inference to show up. . . . This is going to be the fastest growth to $10 billion of any business in our history, it’s all inference, right? One of the things that may not be as evident is that we’re not actually selling raw GPUs for other people to train. In fact, that’s sort of a business we turn away because we have so much demand on inference. . . . We kind of really are not even participating in most of that because we are literally going to the real demand, which is in the enterprise space or our own products like GitHub Copilot or M365 Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, I feel the quality of our revenue is pretty superior in that context. . . . If this was just . . . a bunch of people training large models and that was all we got, then that would be ultimately still waiting . . . for someone to actually have demand, which is real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nadella reported that Microsoft’s cloud platforms, including those used to offer AI services (and therefore “inferencing” AI models), are already driving total revenue growth. He said, “We are off to a solid start to our fiscal year, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue, up 22 percent.” Microsoft’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Amy E. Hood concurred that Microsoft “saw continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, increased demand, and growth in long-term commitments to our Microsoft Cloud platform drove our results. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 30 percent and 23 percent in constant currency.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the BG2 podcast episode, Nadella argued that the breadth of Azure’s geographical hubs and capabilities to handle a range of different workloads will be a competitive advantage for Microsoft in the future. He said, “There is going to be fierce competition between the seven, eight, nine, ten of us [hyperscalers] at different layers of the stack,” but that Azure’s structure makes it “slightly different” than other cloud providers. Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We built out Azure for enterprise workloads with [a] lot of data residency. . . . We have 60- plus more regions than [other providers] . . . [and] we built [Microsoft] cloud for a lot of heterogeneous enterprise workloads, which I think in the long run is where all the inference demand will be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s view that cloud infrastructure for AI inference is where it will see enormous returns on investment—and that the more geographically and computationally diverse it is, the better—helps to explain the company’s push for global AI infrastructure, including in the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Inference Bid in G42 and the UAE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private conversations with Microsoft and G42 executives revealed that G42 and Khazna are building three new data centers in the UAE for Microsoft. The centers will be 30, 30, and 100 megawatts each, the equivalent of nearly 100,000 H100 chips (approximately 15,000, 15,000, and 50,000–60,000 respectively). These data centers will run Microsoft Azure for AI inference, helping to consolidate a regional Azure hub in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and other leading hyperscale cloud and AI firms stated that—if U.S. AI chip export licenses continue to be rapidly approved—nearly all of them would consider UAE opportunities as attractive as, or more attractive than, those in the United States, especially in terms of realizing the goal of rapidly developing gigawatt-scale data centers. While the United States grapples with how to domestically build out energy and AI infrastructure on a scale comparable to the Manhattan Project, Microsoft finds partnership with G42 and the wider UAE attractive for four key reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.1. Availability and Rapid Expansion of (Increasingly Green) Energy Generation Capacity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. AI companies are scrambling to secure long-term sustainable energy sources to fuel unprecedented data center growth, which the U.S. Department of Energy estimates could consume approximately 6.7 to 12 percent of total U.S. electricity by 2028. While bottlenecks in U.S. energy infrastructure currently threaten to place a de facto cap on AI development and deployment in the United States in the near future, the UAE’s capacity to build rapidly and its abundance of energy are incredibly attractive to U.S. AI companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE has mobilized impressive capital in recent years to build out energy infrastructure, including for renewable energy, as it strives to meet its ambitious pledge to be carbon-neutral by 2050. In 2023, the UAE government announced a $54 billion investment package to triple its renewable energy supply over the next seven years. Several large-scale renewable energy projects are already underway, such as the monumental Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, which is expected to reach 5 gigawatts of installed solar capacity by 2030. Though solar power has historically been problematic for data centers due to fluctuations in supply (between day and night as well as seasons), developments in energy and battery storage capabilities are changing the game. In February 2024, for instance, UAE developer Moro Hub opened the world’s largest Tier III 100+ megawatt data center powered by solar energy in Dubai. U.S. companies Microsoft and Dell, as well as Chinese company Huawei, have reportedly already signed on to be customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, thanks to a robust engineering and operations base from its oil industry, the UAE has an active labor force with strong technical know-how. As one UAE government official put it, compared to the United States, “we’re part of the world that still remembers how to build.” The official cited the speed at which the UAE built four nuclear reactors for its Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant as a prime example: According to Emirati officials and the World Nuclear Association, the time between breaking ground on the first reactor and connecting the last reactor to the grid took just under 12 years. In contrast, construction of nuclear reactor Units 3 and 4 of the Alvin W. Vogtle nuclear power plant in the United States—the most recent nuclear reactors to enter commercial operation in July 2023 and April 2024, respectively—took 14 years and ran more than $30 billion over budget. The combined net capacity of Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (2,214 megawatts), meanwhile, is only just over half that of the UAE’s four reactors (5,348 megawatts), which it completed in two fewer years. The UAE is already considering building a second nuclear power plant, which government officials told the authors would likely take only seven to 10 years due to efficiencies learned during the construction of the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UAE investment in energy infrastructure translates to substantial gains in electricity generation capacity over the next decade. According to a 2024 analysis from PwC Middle East, the UAE’s future electricity generation capacity (from a mix of renewable, nuclear, and fossil fuel sources) will significantly outstrip future domestic demand. In 2025, PwC forecasts, the UAE will have 22.5 gigawatts of total generation capacity, while domestically consuming only 18.3 gigawatts. By 2030, capacity is expected to grow to 26.6 gigawatts while consumption remains a modest 21.2 gigawatts. Finally, by 2035, generation capacity is likely to reach 29.6 gigawatts while consumption rests at 23.2 gigawatts of electricity. If the UAE government decides to build a second nuclear power plant with the same specifications as the Barakah plant by 2035, total generation capacity could soar to 34.4 gigawatts. Figure 3 illustrates this trend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mC5Fxgl.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Forecasted Excess UAE Electricity Generation Capacity to 2035 in Gigawatts (GW).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com/m1/en/publications/emobility-outlook-2024-uae-edition.html&quot;&gt;“eMobility Outlook 2024: UAE Edition,” PwC, June 13, 2024&lt;/a&gt;; and CSIS analysis. Authors’ note: PwC Middle East’s data reflects proprietary data from Emirati utility companies. Projected generation capacity figures incorporate major planned infrastructure projects by these companies and the UAE government up to 2035. They do not, however, include a second nuclear reactor, which has been added to this graph by the authors with approval from PwC Middle East. PwC Middle East’s projected domestic consumption figures consider factors such as expected population growth and economic expansion over the next decade (including an unspecified amount of growth in installed data center capacity). Figures have been converted from terawatt hours (PwC version) to gigawatts to be more easily comparable to other figures in this paper and are rounded to the nearest decimal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the UAE’s excess electricity generation capacity will not necessarily be directed solely to powering data centers in the UAE, even a fraction of this figure could be a considerable addition to AI infrastructure in the short term. Just 10 percent of excess capacity in 2030, for instance, would be enough to power over 500 megawatts of data centers (approximately equivalent to 300,000 H100 AI chips)—more than sufficient for the additional 420 megawatts of installed data center capacity that Khazna projects will be built in the UAE by 2029 (specifically 850 megawatts in 2029 compared to 429 megawatts in 2024).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the UAE government could decide to dedicate only a small percentage of its excess electricity generation capacity to powering AI data centers over the next decade. But if AI is indeed the kind of national priority that UAE leadership claims it is (see points one and six), this figure could be a considerable strategic advantage for adding gigawatts of power to AI infrastructure in the next decade. As AI adoption grows, this advantage becomes even more valuable since serving millions of users is substantially more energy-demanding than the occasional training of new AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.2. Rapid and Cost-Efficient Construction of Data Centers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, Khazna CEO Hassan Alnaqbi announced a new Tier-III, 100-megawatt AI-optimized data center in the northern emirate of Ajman. The 100,000 square meter facility will include 20 data halls of AI GPUs using 5 megawatts of capacity each and will be built on an accelerated timeline of 15 to 18 months. In private conversations, Khazna and G42 executives confirmed that the center is being built for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction of the 100-megawatt facility is reportedly expected to cost $272 million. According to Alnaqbi, the average cost of construction per megawatt for a group of new Khazna data centers will be between $8 million and $12 million. For comparison, 2024 U.S. market data shows that the average construction cost of U.S. data centers ranges from $10 million to $11 million per megawatt and is projected to increase 5 to 7 percent annually. In terms of total construction costs, one 2023 survey of the global data industry estimates that the average price (excluding hardware) of a 20-megawatt data center typically falls between $100 million and $200 million. Moreover, construction of a 100-megawatt data center can exceed $1 billion. Therefore, if Khazna’s construction estimates are correct, they would be almost four times cheaper than the global average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.3. The Opportunity to Lock In High-Demand Customers with Sovereign Cloud Services and Create Network Effects for Their AI Applications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sovereign Cloud Services&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the Microsoft-G42 deal is to develop a sovereign cloud for the UAE government and public sector using Microsoft Azure and G42-Khazna construction capabilities. In September 2023, Microsoft announced a partnership with G42 to “unlock new opportunities for digital transformation with joint sovereign cloud and AI offering.” The announcement states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Microsoft’s sovereign cloud offering will allow UAE public sector and regulated industries to use new platform capabilities for securing sensitive data, providing access to the latest cloud and AI features available on Azure public cloud and helping them comply with local privacy and regulatory requirements. G42’s deep understanding of UAE sovereignty requirements and technical capabilities are central to customizing the offering to help address customer’s specific needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reaffirmed this commitment in the more recent $1.5 billion deal with G42 from April 2024. The April press release states that “G42 will run its AI applications and services on Microsoft Azure and partner to deliver advanced AI solutions to global public sector clients and large enterprises,” as well as “to introduce sovereign cloud offerings and collaborate on unlocking the potential of advanced AI capabilities on the Azure public cloud platform.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In private meetings, G42 stressed that the Azure sovereign public cloud platform remains central to the new G42-Microsoft partnership. This platform is codeveloped between Microsoft and Core42 at the AI compute and cloud platform layers of the AI value chain (see Figures 1 and 2). G42 executives explained that G42 and the UAE government want to expand local data center capacity inside the UAE so that they can store and process sensitive data that, under UAE laws, is not permitted to leave the country. Moreover, Core42 software built on top of Microsoft Azure confidential compute encrypts all data, helping to strengthen the UAE’s data sovereignty. Specifically, any data running on the Core42-Azure stack in the UAE can be accessed—but not read—by foreign governments using extraterritorial authorities over cloud providers overseas, such as the United States’ CLOUD Act or China’s Data Security and Personal Information Protection laws. As a result, one G42 representative said that G42 can technically comply with foreign data laws while simultaneously protecting sensitive “sovereign” data by making it illegible. In return, for Microsoft, UAE companies generating data (including G42’s own companies) will become Microsoft customers, offering Microsoft the opportunity to lock in demand for its cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G42 executives highlighted G42’s healthcare portfolio company, M42, as a case study of this dynamic. M42 is creating databases of Emiratis’ biometric data as part of a government-sponsored genome sequencing project to improve healthcare diagnostics and drug discovery in the UAE. M42 has collected approximately 700,000 DNA samples thus far—an extraordinary amount of data that requires storage and management and that offers the opportunity for extensive AI analysis. Under the UAE’s Health Data Law, however, in the absence of specific government authorization the storage and processing of health data must take place within the country. Additionally, the sensitive nature of the data means that the UAE wants to host the data on secure encrypted cloud servers that prevent the data from being accessed by foreign governments. As a result, the UAE government and the regulated companies are eager to expand sovereign data center capacity inside the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G42 executives told the authors that M42’s genomics project is already consuming vast amounts of G42’s local data center capacity and indicated that the firm would be a strong and rapidly growing customer for Microsoft’s new cloud facilities. As the UAE strives to expand its healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, it will require even greater capacity to store and process data on encrypted platforms. More broadly, G42 and the UAE’s many other companies that handle other forms of sensitive data, such as its space technology company Space42, will likely become strong customers for Microsoft Azure public cloud in the future. This all suggests that Microsoft will secure customers for its planned data centers in the UAE with little trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating Network Effects with Microsoft AI Products&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to capturing high-demand customers for Azure, Microsoft hopes to become the first and best developer of AI applications that stimulate network effects toward its services. The network effect describes the concept that the more people use a service or product, the more valuable it becomes. It is frequently used in relation to e-commerce or social media platforms, where the quality of the service grows as more users become members. Additionally, the more people use a particular product or service in an individual’s social or professional network, the more likely they are to use it, too, creating a reinforcing cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 30 years, the network effect has helped to make Microsoft’s Office suite the default operations platform for businesses worldwide. Entrenched norms and efforts to make business software interoperable have ensured that Microsoft products like Word and Excel have become the backbone of the professional world. Through technological diffusion—and not just innovation—Microsoft has become the world’s largest tech companies in terms of market capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would like to reproduce this kind of effect with its consumer and enterprise AI products in the future. Nadella acknowledged this as a Microsoft strategy on the December 2024 BG2 podcast, where he said that “network effects is always going to be at the software layer, at the app layer,” and that there will be “different network effects in the consumer [sector and] the enterprise [sector]” due to different demands for its products, such as Microsoft Copilot for consumers and GitHub Copilot for software developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives told the authors that their ultimate hope is to supply emerging markets with their products before Chinese technology firms can get there first. Should Chinese firms overcome U.S. export controls and produce superior AI products (and be able to offer them at scale), they will still face the challenge of competing with an established incumbent across the developing world. Even if a Chinese application is technically better, network effects could ensure that Microsoft customers remain loyal to their products. For this reason, Microsoft is eager to jumpstart a virtuous cycle of demand for its AI products in the UAE and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.4. A Gateway to Emerging Markets in the Global South&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key element of the April Microsoft-G42 deal is the expansion of Microsoft’s AI services to the developing world. Microsoft’s press statement about the deal is specifically titled: “Microsoft invests $1.5 billion in Abu Dhabi’s G42 to accelerate AI development and global expansion.” In private conversations, Microsoft and G42 executives stated that, like the UAE, many governments in the Global South are looking to develop their own public clouds that will store and process data locally in line with national laws (see point 5.3. above). They see this as a critical opportunity for Microsoft to expand its Azure cloud services and for G42 to finance and build out the data center infrastructure abroad. Microsoft’s press statement suggests as much:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“G42 and Microsoft will collaborate to ensure the benefits of secure AI technologies and cloud capabilities are responsibly shared with growing economies. . . . G42 and Microsoft will also work together to bring advanced AI and digital infrastructure to countries in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa, providing these nations with equitable access to services to address important governmental and business concerns while ensuring the highest standards of security and privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public announcements by G42 and Microsoft have already confirmed that one of these countries is Kenya (see below). Though other countries have not been confirmed under the deal, agreements from 2021 and 2022 between G42 and the government of Kazakhstan, as well as private and state-owned infrastructure companies in Egypt and Indonesia make these likely contenders for expanding Microsoft Azure with G42.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and G42’s work in Kenya, which includes developing a 1-gigawatt data center and building a Swahili language AI model, is the first step in this global expansion project. This project began in March 2024, when G42, without Microsoft, announced a partnership with Kenyan firm EcoCloud to build a 1-gigawatt data center in Kenya, “powered by the untapped potential of Kenya’s 10 gigawatts in geothermal energy.” According to the press release, the facility would start at 100 megawatts before scaling to 1 gigawatt to “usher in an era of cloud computing and AI services” in Kenya. Kenyan President William Samoei Ruto reportedly supported the deal personally. It was only later, in May 2024, that Microsoft announced it would join this venture with G42. One top G42 executive privately said that Microsoft’s senior leadership had been “inspired” by G42’s plans in Kenya and “saw the opportunity” to expand Microsoft’s business in the Global South. Microsoft executives likewise confirmed that this was a pivotal moment for the company’s top executives, leading them to give G42 $1.5 billion. G42 executives told the authors that the company was not initially looking for capital investment from Microsoft, only a partnership agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the second May 2024 agreement with Kenya, Microsoft and G42 will commit an initial investment of $1 billion in expanding Kenya’s digital ecosystem, in which “one of the Kenyan investment priorities is a state-of-the-art green data center that will be built by G42 and its partners to run Microsoft Azure in a new East Africa Cloud Region.” The public announcement states that Microsoft and G42 will specifically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Work with the government of Kenya and will design and operate the new East Africa cloud region as part of a ‘trusted data zone’ based on global standards to protect digital safety, privacy and security. With technical assistance and support from G42 and Microsoft, Kenya will establish the new data center . . . under which data from other countries may be governed by their local laws, even while stored and resident in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kenya will utilize the new data center and cloud services for governmental and citizen services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both G42 and Microsoft executives told the authors that they see this project as the first step to expanding services to many other governments with similar sovereign needs as the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives expressed significant enthusiasm about what this partnership with G42 could mean for increasing U.S. influence in middle and emerging powers vis-à-vis China. Though they acknowledged the U.S. national security concerns raised by the Microsoft-G42 deal, they argued that in its absence, Chinese technology companies would have snapped up the opportunity to provide AI infrastructure to the UAE. More broadly, the partnership offers an opportunity to rebuff Chinese technology companies’ dominance of critical technology infrastructure in Africa. In recent years, for instance, leading Chinese tech firms like Huawei and ZTE Corporation have developed AI-enabled “smart city” infrastructure and surveillance systems in countries across the African continent, including Kenya. “If the U.S. has the chance to win over Africa [against China], it’s because of what we’re doing here,” one Microsoft executive said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 3, 2025, Microsoft President and Vice Chair Brad Smith called the “promotion of American AI exports” a “critical priority” for U.S. policymakers and companies in the next year. “The rapid development of China’s AI sector has heightened competition between American and Chinese AI, with much of this likely to play out during the next four years in international markets around the world,” Smith wrote. Moreover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“While the U.S. government rightly has focused on protecting sensitive AI components in secure datacenters through export controls, an even more important element of this competition will involve a race between the United States and China to spread their respective technologies to other countries. Given the nature of technology markets and their potential network effects, this race between the U.S. and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover. Hence, the United States needs a smart international strategy to rapidly support American AI around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple Microsoft, G42, and UAE government representatives stressed that the UAE has the diplomatic clout and available capital to become a “gateway to the Global South” for U.S. companies. With closer ties to developing countries than the United States has and enormous capital reserves, the UAE government and companies like G42 could effectively “derisk” U.S. companies’ entry into new markets, they argue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE committed $97 billion in foreign investment to Africa in 2022 and 2023—three times the amount of Chinese investment in the continent over the same period. It also became a BRICS+ member in 2024, joining a club of emerging economies anticipated to represent 45 percent of global GDP in purchasing power terms by 2040. According to the World Trade Organization, BRICS+ members already represent approximately 25 percent of global exports, with the UAE second only to China (and 14th globally) as the largest exporter among BRICS+ countries at 2.1 percent of the global share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;6-g42s-ambitions-extend-far-beyond-its-microsoft-partnership-it-desires-to-build-10-to-100-times-more-data-center-capacity-than-currently-outlined-in-its-agreement-with-microsoft&quot;&gt;6. G42’s ambitions extend far beyond its Microsoft partnership. It desires to build 10 to 100 times more data center capacity than currently outlined in its agreement with Microsoft.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the GITEX Global Expo in October 2024, G42’s Xiao presented the concept of an AI “intelligence grid” similar to today’s electric utility grids. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“As intelligence, through the form of artificial intelligence, becomes a utility, it becomes as important, if not more important than electricity. . . . That means we have to build the intelligence grid—the equivalent of [an] electricity grid; the data centers, connectivity, the computing infrastructure for inferencing, to be able to pipe that intelligence-as-utility to everyone who needs it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xiao estimates that the world today has less than 60 gigawatts of data centers but will need between 300 and 500 gigawatts to spread AI across the globe, with each gigawatt of data center and energy infrastructure costing $45 billion. According to studies of AI training and infrastructure costs and the authors’ calculations, AI chips account for nearly half of this total cost at approximately $20–$24 billion per gigawatt. Xiao further said, “That’s a type of infrastructure we’ve got to build for the world to be able to take advantage of AI and to benefit all humanity. And for me, that’s the greatest opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G42’s deal with Microsoft to build two 30-megawatt and one 100-megawatt data center in the UAE is only the beginning of a much bigger project to spread “intelligence-as-utility” worldwide. In a private meeting, one senior G42 executive said the company wants to build gigawatt-scale data centers because “we think this [ability to rapidly and cheaply build large energy and data center infrastructure] could be our competitive moat.” Specifically, G42 and Khazna’s speed and cost-effectiveness of construction and the UAE’s abundance of energy are great advantages in domains where the United States and the rest of the world are struggling to compete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khazna reportedly already has 360 megawatts of data center capacity spread over 24 centers in the UAE, with another eight under construction. Khazna’s Alnaqbi has publicly stated that “based on the demand we have . . . we expect the UAE to ramp up and accelerate demand to at least 850 megawatts by 2029” (see point 5.1). However, private discussions with G42 executives indicate that G42’s ambitions to build out AI infrastructure—with or without Microsoft as their partner—far exceed this number:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of 2025, G42 plans to bring roughly 100 megawatts of data center capacity into operation, including the two 30-megawatt centers built for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of 2026, G42 plans to bring hundreds of megawatts of capacity into operation, including the AI-optimized 100-megawatt center in Ajman built for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the end of 2027, G42 plans to reach multiple gigawatts of data center capacity, including from data centers outside the UAE, such as the 1-gigawatt facility in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top G42 executives told the authors that they think they will be able to generate around 5 gigawatts of data centers within the UAE, most of which will be used for AI deployment. They did not provide a timeframe for building out this capacity but implied that Microsoft may not be their only partner if it cannot fill these data centers quickly enough once they are constructed. They did not suggest which other companies G42 might pick as additional or alternative partners to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;7-according-to-g42-and-microsoft-representatives-security-controls-at-the-g42-data-center-align-with-us-commercial-standards-though-the-adequacy-of-such-controls-for-protecting-strategic-ai-capabilities-remains-uncertain&quot;&gt;7. According to G42 and Microsoft representatives, security controls at the G42 data center align with U.S. commercial standards, though the adequacy of such controls for protecting strategic AI capabilities remains uncertain.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in the UAE, the authors toured a 21-megawatt data center built by G42 and Khazna for Microsoft. Security controls installed in this center to address cybersecurity, insider threat, and break-in risks include NIST SP 800-53 controls, over 100 SP 800-53 security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations, and Department of Commerce export license requirements. The authors of this paper are not in a position to fully verify G42’s claims about its broader security controls, though the implementation of these commercial security standards appeared consistent with typical industry practice and is plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key question, however, is whether these measures are wholly sufficient. Standard data center security measures typically address privacy and cybercrime issues rather than full-fledged attacks from nation-states like China. As AI capabilities advance and the stakes increase, U.S. and UAE commercial security standards may need significant enhancement to address evolving threats from state actors. A RAND analysis indicates that securing AI model weights and related intellectual property requires significantly higher security standards than what current AI companies or cloud providers—whether in the United States or the UAE—are currently achieving. While cybersecurity measures are currently a primary focus due to the risks of deploying model weights abroad and potential exploitation by adversaries, compute providers could play a much broader role in ensuring secure AI development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, cybersecurity represents only one dimension of the challenge. Today’s risks extend beyond traditional export control concerns about the physical location and ownership of AI chips. Critical considerations include how compute resources are being used, who can access them remotely, and how resulting AI models and weights might be shared or deployed. Even when AI chips are physically secure within a facility, their computational power can be accessed remotely, and trained models can be distributed widely—potentially to unauthorized users. This requires robust know-your-customer procedures and comprehensive monitoring of compute usage patterns, capabilities that current security frameworks may not adequately address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the United States deems the current controls inadequate for protecting U.S. technology in Emirati data centers or elsewhere, it should clarify what additional controls may be required and where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;8-the-united-states-faces-two-strategic-questions-regarding-uae-ai-development-first-whether-to-continue-to-support-the-near-term-g42-microsoft-partnership-plan-and-second-how-to-approach-the-uaes-broader-ai-ambitions&quot;&gt;8. The United States faces two strategic questions regarding UAE AI development: first, whether to continue to support the near-term G42-Microsoft partnership plan, and second, how to approach the UAE’s broader AI ambitions.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can support Microsoft-led projects in the UAE while remaining cautious of endorsing the UAE’s broader AI ambitions. If Microsoft’s claim that cloud infrastructure can create significant lock-in and network effects for its cloud services is true, then supporting the Microsoft-G42 deal could strengthen U.S. technological leadership and make switching to alternative providers (like Huawei) increasingly costly. This “stickiness” of cloud platforms could help cement U.S. dominance in global AI infrastructure while providing a model for future partnerships with other emerging technology powers. The new U.S. Framework for AI Diffusion further reinforces this advantage by allowing U.S. companies like Microsoft to obtain Universal Validated End User status, enabling them to deploy data centers globally with a single license, whereas local companies in the UAE would require an authorization which is country specific and subject to more stringent caps. As Chinese technology firms continue to strengthen their presence in neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia—which is increasing joint ventures with companies like Alibaba and SenseTime, and recently invested $400 million in AI startup Zhipu AI—developing such a model for U.S. foreign engagement on AI is more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the United States should also bear in mind that today’s cooperation could evolve into tomorrow’s competition. At the GITEX Global Expo, for instance, UAE Adviser to the President and Secretary-General of the Advanced Technology Research Council Faisal Al Bannai said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think the opportunity we have, as UAE, and as the stakeholders here in the country [is]: One, you can leverage all the good technologies that are coming out, let’s say from the U.S., right? The different partnerships that are happening with G42, Microsoft, [and] a number of other entities. But at the same time, we are also building our own AI platforms—something that we control, we own, and we can take progress from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE has already made a significant effort to develop indigenous LLMs such as G42’s Arabic-English LLM Jais and the government-backed Technology Innovation Institute’s Falcon 2, which the institute claims outperforms Meta’s Llama 3 model. Private conversations with UAE technology and business professionals revealed that, in reality, these Emirati models perform poorly compared to U.S. models. They said Emirati models are not reliable nor high performing enough for many industry use cases, and that they currently use U.S. options in their work. With increasing access to U.S. compute and talent, however, the United States should think through a scenario in which indigenous Emirati models—controlled exclusively by a nondemocratic government with significant ties to China—become real global competitors. If the next world order is indeed determined by who wields the best AI systems, then the decision to equip other countries with the fundamental ingredients to develop this technology (i.e., chips) should not be taken lightly. Even if the UAE remains faithful to its promise to exclusively partner with the United States in AI, it has said little so far about what a world in which it has outgrown this partnership might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-proceed-with-caution&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Proceed with Caution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. leadership of the global AI ecosystem is at a critical turning point. Recent developments in China’s AI models have caused several leading AI executives to outright reject the belief that the United States still holds an 18-month lead on China in AI development. At the same time, Chinese technology firms’ investment and infrastructure projects in emerging economies threaten to lock the United States out of economically and geopolitically strategic markets in the Global South. However, China’s ability to produce advanced AI chips at the scale needed to support broad AI deployment could remain significantly constrained by U.S. export controls, limiting their capacity to backfill U.S. technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While renewing U.S. industrial policy and onshoring supply chains is a frequent policy priority in Washington, these policies should not be pursued at the expense of expanding a U.S.-led AI ecosystem abroad. Similarly, rigid restrictions on the deployment of U.S. AI technologies exclusively in the United States and its allies will do little to further U.S. influence in the many “swing states” that are unlikely to pick sides in the U.S.-China competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, reaffirming the United States’ leadership in AI requires a comprehensive strategy: ensuring emerging powers choose U.S. technology to realize their AI ambitions while establishing robust frameworks for secure and responsible deployment. The traditional approach of simply selling technology without ongoing oversight is insufficient given the unique characteristics of AI systems—their remote accessibility, the sensitivity of model weights, and the potential for unauthorized sharing or deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will always be inherent risks to offshoring AI to countries outside the United States, let alone to nondemocratic ones with strong ties to China. Thus far, the United States’ approval of relatively modest clusters of advanced AI chips to G42 indicates that the potential benefits—both commercial and strategic—outweigh the risks. However, as the U.S.-UAE partnership evolves, U.S. policymakers and AI executives should maintain a healthy realism about the UAE’s vested interests in hedging its bets between the United States and China. They should have no illusions about the nature of the Emirati political regime, nor about some of the uses to which the UAE is likely to apply its AI technologies. They should ask tough questions, such as what the UAE government is doing to ensure decoupling from China in AI by tech companies other than G42, and scrutinize the UAE’s claims about these and other security measures. If they do not think that the current security controls for AI chips are sufficient to protect the United States’ advantage, they should articulate clearly and consistently what those controls should be. For now, however, proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英認曾晤美議員談及《香港人權與民主法案》 惟否認游說支持&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1mYmm9v.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（23日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第124日審訊，黎智英第32日作供，控方繼續盤問黎。2019年9月底，黎正準備10月的訪美行程，另一邊廂美國共和黨參議員斯科特等人訪港，黎準備在香港會見斯科特。控方指，其時美國參眾兩院準備就《香港人權與民主法案》表決，質疑黎知道法案是關於制裁，並曾游說美國議員，爭取他們支持通過法案。黎稱不記得自己曾談及法案，因不關注法案，甚至連法案名字也不記得。直至下午控方展示黎的專欄文章，當中提及：「今次我們有與參議院多數黨領袖麥康奈爾見面，我們覺得法案最終在參議院獲通過是相當樂觀的」，黎才改稱有談及法案，但否認游說他們支持通過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱游說美國議員支持因香港處於危機-官質疑其時修例草案已擱置&quot;&gt;黎稱游說美國議員支持因香港處於危機 官質疑其時修例草案已擱置&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行提到，2019年9月黎與私人助手 Mark Simon 正在籌備10月的訪美之行。控方展示郭明瀚創立的 WhatsApp 群組「Martin, Jimmy, Mark」訊息，Mark Simon 在9月23日指，他們會在10月會見不同傳媒的編輯委員會，包括《華爾街日報》和《紐約時報》等，又提到「我們會著重聯絡參議員和眾議院（“we are going to work on the Senators and The House heavily.”）」。Mark 另指，時任美國總統特朗普和時任副總統彭斯是否有空接見，則有待確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否打算在訪美行程中處理香港引渡條例議題？黎否認，並指只是去會見美國議員。控方追問黎會見議員的目的，黎則指談論香港狀況，並同意是游說他們支持香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭指黎只給了概括的答案，追問他想美國議員支持香港什麼。黎指：「因為當時香港處於危機之中！因為引渡條例草案！」法官李運騰提到，當時修訂草案已被政府擱置，亦能肯定政府將會宣布撤回草案，因此黎所指的「危機」是什麼？黎表示，那時香港還有示威，市民爭取《基本法》下保障的權利，例如普選。李官另提到，當時示威者間是否有「五大訴求」？黎則稱當時還未有「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰表示，聽了十分鐘，仍未能明白黎想美國議員支持香港什麼。黎重申，他希望美國議員能替香港的自由和《基本法》所保障的權利發聲。控方重覆法官問題，指當時修例草案已經被擱置。黎指市民仍然不滿意，仍然擔心引渡條例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示mark-simon正安排黎見特朗普-黎稱從沒預計將會見特朗普&quot;&gt;訊息顯示Mark Simon正安排黎見特朗普 黎稱從沒預計將會見特朗普&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另提到，《香港人權與民主法案》在2019年6月13日被提出，在10月時審議程序仍然進行中，後來在11月獲通過。控方問黎是否打算在訪美行程期間推動法案？黎否認，亦稱不知道 Mark Simon 為何會說「著重聯絡參議員和眾議院」。但黎確認他將會與時任眾議院議長佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）和共和黨參議員盧比奧（Marco Rubio）見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰引述 Mark Simon 的訊息，指特朗普和彭斯有待確認，問黎是否計劃會見二人？黎則稱打算會見白宮官員，但認為會見特朗普的成事機會不大（never on the cards）。杜官續問，黎的訪美行程是否計劃會見白宮的高級官員，包括特朗普和彭斯？黎表示，從訊息可見 Mark Simon 正嘗試替他安排，但是他本人從沒預計自己將會見特朗普。法官李素蘭則指，從 Mark Simon 的訊息可見，黎的確有機會見到特朗普。黎遂同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱沒印象曾向美國參議員談論及游說支持香港人權與民主法案&quot;&gt;黎稱沒印象曾向美國參議員談論及游說支持《香港人權與民主法案》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前證供顯示，美國共和黨參議員斯科特（Rick Scott）於9月29日在香港與黎智英會面。控方展示事前的訊息，2019年9月23日，Mark Simon 向黎表示：「60分鐘是很多，而且斯科特是真的挺重要。（“60 minutes is huge and Scott is really quite important.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gvPy2KM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ Rick Scott 斯科特（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至9月28日，即會面前一日，Mark 向黎傳送斯科特的背景，當中提到他對中國態度是「鷹派（China hawk）」，又指「一如以往他會問你，香港這裡需要從美國得到什麼（“As always he will ask what it is we need here in Hong Kong from the US.”）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至9月29日早上，即會面之前數小時，黎問 Mark Simon 剛剛在眾議院通過的香港法案是叫做什麼。Mark Simon 回答是《香港人權與民主法案》，又提供了相關程序簡介，並稱：「10月休會之後，他們期望眾議院和參議院均會全院通過，之後交給特朗普簽署。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否打算在會面時談及《香港人權與民主法案》？黎則稱已忘記所有細節。控方接著問黎，有沒有任何原因他未有在會面中談及法案？黎堅稱沒有印象自己曾談論法案，因為就他而言並不太關注法案。惟李素蘭指 Mark Simon 訊息提及「一如以往他會問你，香港這裡需要從美國得到什麼」，所以 Mark 已清楚向黎表明，黎可以告訴對方香港需要美國做什麼，質疑黎卻稱忘記了？黎則堅稱忘記了自己告訴斯科特什麼，又稱不記得自己曾要求美國替香港做任何事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，Mark Simon 提醒黎，法案名稱是《香港人權與民主法案》。控方接著指，Mark Simon 告知黎相關背景和立法進展。黎則稱不記得，強調自己連法案的全名也不知道。惟李素蘭再度質疑黎聲稱忘記，黎稱他不關注。李素蘭遂問黎，記得自己關注什麼嗎？黎僅稱香港當時狀況，以及美國能做什麼幫助。李素蘭遂追問黎想美國怎樣幫助？黎稱他有要求斯科特幫忙，但是忘記具體向他說過什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭隨即質疑：「黎先生，你正在會見一名參議員！」黎重申忘記了要求過什麼。控方質疑，那麼為什麼 Mark Simon 會在訊息中提及法案？黎則反問：「法案已經通過了，為什麼我要談起它？」控方則引述訊息，Mark Simon 告訴他法案將會交兩院表決，所以黎希望美議員支持法案，並游說他們投票通過。黎否認。控方又指，黎實際上曾游說美國議員，爭取他們支持通過法案。黎稱不記得自己曾為法案游說，他不關注法案，甚至連法案名字也不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon要求取得2500份特刊到美國派發-官人脈甚廣&quot;&gt;Mark Simon要求取得2,500份特刊到美國派發 官：人脈甚廣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年9月21日 Mark Simon 的訊息，他稱：「我可以拿2,500份今天的運動特刊嗎？它們超乎想像地受歡迎，我收到100個請求。我們會把它們拿到國會山莊，羅傑斯的團隊也想在議會到處派發它們。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指訊息中的「運動特刊」是《蘋果》派發的特刊《2019自由之夏》。惟黎疑惑訊息中的「特刊」是否指另一本出版物，但他不記得。雙方就此討論，黎一度指「特刊」所指為何是小事情。不過李素蘭隨即反駁，這部份可以顯示 Mark Simon 人脈甚廣，因他收到100個請求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/znRJxRO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續展示9月29日的訊息，Mark Simon 告訴黎，他走遍4個地方也買不到特刊，他在一間「7-11」便利店遇到一名友善的年輕女士，她在網上查看之後說特刊已售罄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意被告知人權與民主法案進展-惟不記得是否上心&quot;&gt;黎同意被告知《人權與民主法案》進展 惟不記得是否上心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年9月17日，Mark Simon 向 WhatsApp 群組「Martin, Jimmy, Mark」傳送訊息，指最佳的訪美日子為10月21至24日，並稱：「有更加大的渴求會見佩洛西及其團隊，還有更多參議員和職員。」他們亦會見位於華盛頓的重要傳媒。Mark 續表示，有人建議他尋找資深的泛民主派參與是次訪美，才會有意義和生產力。Mark 表示他近日出席了參議院有關東亞的公聽會，和有關「香港民主法案」的會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，Mark Simon 在訊息提到「香港民主法案」，黎在當時必然知道《香港人權與民主法案》的進展。惟黎稱當時不關注《法案》。法官杜麗冰指，但是黎被告知有關進展，問黎是否同意。黎同意被告知，但他不記得自己對此是否上心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於 Mark Simon 以什麼身位出席參議院會議，黎稱不知道，也不知道誰人邀請他。黎亦稱從沒詢問 Mark ，因為對此不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon-認為資深泛民需要參與訪美&quot;&gt;Mark Simon 認為資深泛民需要參與訪美&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼續展示2019年9月17日，Mark Simon 另一則訊息，他認為正在遊走紐約和華盛頓的年輕人團體不會有成效，因他在《華爾街日報》和《紐約時報》的朋友均認為來訪者某程度上沒有共識，因此認為資深泛民人士需要參與訪美，例如李柱銘和黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上指，訊息中的「資深泛民」包括傳統泛民，例如李柱銘和李卓人，因美國那邊的人投訴年輕人不夠認真，所以他們要求會見資深泛民。他舉例指訊息中的「年輕人」包括張崑陽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱對法案不感興趣-又指很多時法案通過之後沒有人跟進&quot;&gt;黎稱對法案不感興趣 又指很多時法案通過之後沒有人跟進&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年10月8日，Mark Simon 告知黎：「眾議院將會在下星期處理《香港人權與民主法案》和《保護香港法案》」；黎回覆：「Great!」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎在當時是否已經知道法案的內容？黎同意知道，但稱知得不太詳細。控方問黎是否知道法案是關於制裁？黎否認，因不感興趣。控方質疑，若然黎不感興趣的話，為何又會問 Mark Simon 法案名稱？黎稱只是以防萬一斯科特會問起法案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問黎，是否知道法案對香港有好處與否？黎稱：「我當時不關注，我認為它不是對香港而言是好」，又指很多時法案通過之後沒有人跟進。李官追問，那麼黎為什麼想知道法案名稱？黎回答：「至少知道法案的名稱。」李官問，如果斯科特問起法案內容呢？黎則回答：「那我會說我不知道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎是知道法案是關於制裁。黎堅稱不知道，也沒有細看法案內容，但可能有人告訴過他法案是關於制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑黎將要見參議員正計劃會見美國總統-不可能不對法案感興趣&quot;&gt;官質疑黎將要見參議員、正計劃會見美國總統 不可能不對法案感興趣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，Mark Simon 於10月12日繼續向黎傳送法案的最新進展。黎則庭上稱對方可能很想讓自己知道相關進展。法官李運騰問，如果黎不感興趣的話，為什麼不直接跟 Mark Simon 說「我不感興趣，不要煩我」？黎表示：「如果我不感興趣，這是我的個人選擇，我不能夠無禮。」控方指：「但你是他的老闆。」黎表示，他只是不感興趣而已，反問：「為什麼我要責罵他呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎：「你說你對法案不感興趣？」黎重申：「我不相信這個法案，我不認為它有效，當它通過之後，沒有人會跟進，它沒有實質效果（it has no substance），只是學術性質（academic）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭質疑：「你將要見很多參議員，你正在計劃會見美國總統！」，又問：「你還可以去得多高遠？（“How much higher can you go?”）」黎僅回應：「你認為合乎邏輯的事情，不代表我也認為合乎邏輯。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎不認為美國政府聆聽了我&quot;&gt;黎：不認為美國政府聆聽了我&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦展示10月12日的訊息，顯示黎將《香港人權與民主法案》的最新發展，分別傳送給李柱銘和何俊仁。控方指，黎想告知泛民人士法案的最新進展，而且黎對法案感興趣，否則他不會傳送給其他泛民。黎稱自己經常將他們可能感到興趣的東西轉發給他們，不代表他自己感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於黎剛才稱「法案通過後便沒有人跟進」，法官杜麗冰質疑，法案通過之後，中國和香港的官員會被制裁，為什麼黎會說「沒有人跟進」？又問黎：「你是否認為你是錯的？」黎承認：「對，我是錯的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎被問到是否知道法案內容及是否知道有關制裁。黎重申，已忘記了當時自己有否留意，但他同意後來閱讀新聞後知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，黎在公開對談中稱要凍結中共官員的貪污資產，而當時有數項議案在美國議會獲動議，似乎黎的提議獲得美國政府聆聽，可是黎卻聲稱對《法案》不感興趣？黎則表示：「我不認為美國政府聆聽了我」，又指當時很多眾議員和參議員正在談論相關議案，他並非推動者。李官指：「基本上你得到你所要求的東西。」黎僅回應：「我當時是要求凍結銀行帳戶。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在公開場合重複要求「制裁他們」，包括凍結官員銀行帳戶，而美國合共制裁了42名中國及香港特區官員，因此《法案》必然會引起黎的興趣。黎重申他忘記了當時自己有否留意。李素蘭澄清問題是《法案》是否能引起黎的興趣？黎表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著指，所以在當時，黎已經知道《法案》是關於制裁？黎表示：「我可能。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎文章稱相信美國對中國的制裁能有效施壓-遭質疑與庭上說法不符&quot;&gt;黎文章稱「相信美國對中國的制裁能有效施壓」 遭質疑與庭上說法不符&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」，於2019年10月27日發布的文章〈美國人想對我們說的話〉，並指時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏構思十條問題訪問黎。黎確認文章是在2019年10月從美國之行期間撰寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中提到：「不要急於因為未看到成果而武力升級，不要忘記站在道德高地上忍耐，相信美國對中國的制裁能有效施壓，對爭取到香港普選也更有希望。這就是他們對我們的忠告。」控方質疑，黎剛才供稱認為《法案》沒有效用，與這部份說法不符。黎則回應，他指沒有效用的是《法案》，因法案往往通過之後便沒有人跟進，但他認為「制裁」是有效。控方問黎當時相信制裁有效？黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中第九道問題：「《香港人權與民主法案》通過後是否真的可以制裁黑警、葉劉、何君堯？」黎回答：「法案已在眾議院通過，還欠參議院。今次我們有與參議院多數黨領袖麥康奈爾見面，我們覺得法案最終在參議院獲通過是相當樂觀的，只要我們能維持現時的表現，就不怕失去支持。葉劉、何君堯以至警察會否被個別制裁，他們沒有提及細節。但是造成不公不義的人、暴力鎮壓我們的人，原則上是一定要負責的，要他們感受到有後果，是必要的。相信他們就算不出現在法案裏，美國也會以黑名單方式針對這幫人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭引述「今次我們有與參議院多數黨領袖麥康奈爾見面，我們覺得法案最終在參議院獲通過是相當樂觀的」，指黎的確曾與議員談論《法案》，然而黎剛才卻說不記得？黎稱現在讀到文章後，同意有談論過，但是堅稱早前已忘記了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，黎在文中表示「我們覺得法案最終在參議院獲通過是相當樂觀的」，若果黎對《法案》不感興趣的話，為何又會在這裡談及它？黎僅稱：「因為我要回答問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭指黎剛才卻說《法案》通過後往往沒有人跟進，是「學術性」的？黎稱他是說對於《法案》通過樂觀，但沒有說對於其效用樂觀。李運騰問，若果讀者看到文章，不會知道黎這種想法，問黎認為讀者會知道他的真正想法嗎？黎稱他僅轉述麥康奈爾的說法。杜麗冰則反駁，黎不只是轉述麥康奈爾的說法，而是表達自己的感受。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文中第十道問題「香港人還可以做甚麼爭取美國及國際社會支持？」，黎在文章中回答：「要得到外國人支持，就要不斷游說。加上傳媒報道，讓他們了解我們的道德、勇氣、良知，讓他們在生活上發聲，支持只會越來越大，不會減少的，只要我們做好本份，以道德力量感動他們的良知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎當時支持《法案》及希望它獲得通過。黎同意。控方續提議，事實上黎當時有進行游說工作推動制裁。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎不認為-mark-simon-與美國政府有聯繫-但同意有時從他得到內部消息&quot;&gt;黎：不認為 Mark Simon 與美國政府有聯繫 但同意有時從他得到內部消息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年11月8日的訊息，Mark Simon 告知黎，當時有5至9名參議員私下對《香港人權與民主法案》抱保留態度，來自民主和共和兩黨，他們共同關注為中國生意。訊息又指，白宮和國務院亦不想在中美貿易談判之前，做任何事打擊中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎經常從 Mark Simon 接收到美國政府的內部消息。黎則同意是「有時」，但不是「經常」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰和李素蘭問及 Mark Simon 的背景，黎指在超過25年之前在香港的教會認識 Mark Simon，二人同是教友。Mark 曾經任職台灣船運公司的主席，在逾20年前開始替黎工作，負責看管黎的個人投資，後來成為黎的私人助手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭問黎是否知道 Mark Simon 如何認識美國的參議員？黎稱不知道，可能逐漸認識他們並建立人脈關係。李素蘭提到黎早前供稱 Mark 是共和黨黨員。黎同意，並指 Mark 是香港分部的主席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎知不知道 Mark Simon 為什麼與美國政府有緊密關係？是否因為他是共和黨員？黎則稱，不認為 Mark 與美國政府有聯繫，他只是經郭明瀚和前白宮資深顧問惠頓，而得知美國政府的消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，數項訊息均顯示 Mark Simon 能夠從美國國家安全委員會得到消息。黎指消息乃經時任美國副國家安全顧問博明（Matt Pottinger）得到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱希望特朗普簽署已通過法案&quot;&gt;黎稱希望特朗普簽署已通過法案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年11月14日（即香港時間11月15日）《香港人權與民主法案》通過。控方展示11月14日訊息，Mark Simon 向黎傳送相關消息：「盧比奧正將《香港人權與民主法案》放上參議院，代表最早今天或下星期表決，難以看到它不獲通過。很棒的消息。（“Rubio is taking the Hong Kong human rights and democracy act to floor of the Senate. Means it gets a vote as early as today or next week. Hard to see it not passing. Excellent news.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎其後將相同的訊息轉發給李柱銘、何俊仁、李卓人、李永達和同案被告陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月24日，郭明瀚向 WhatsApp 群組「Martin, Jimmy, Mark」傳送訊息，指特朗普有可能不簽署《法案》。黎在群組回應：「希望特朗普簽署，如果他不簽署的話，對他而言是很差。（“Well, hope Trump signs. It’s bad for him if he doesn’t.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mark-simon-到訪美國國安委及獲內部消息-黎否認他是美國政府一份子&quot;&gt;Mark Simon 到訪美國國安委及獲內部消息 黎否認他是美國政府一份子&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月28日，Mark Simon 向黎表示：「昨天我到（美國）國家安全委員會，他們正在就簽署法案做準備工作。特朗普上星期決定簽署它，但他希望嘗試不讓習近平在貿易談判上有任何籌碼。（“I was at the national security council yesterday, they were laying the groundwork for signing the bill. Trump decided last week to sign it, but he wanted to try and not give Xi any leverage on trade talks.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否同意 Mark Simon 與美國國家安全委員會非常緊密？黎表示：「我不會這樣假設。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到 Mark Simon 為何會到訪美國國家安全委員會，黎稱不知道，也沒有問他。法官杜麗冰質疑，Mark Simon 是黎的「左右手」，為何不問他？黎則指，不會所有關於他的事情都要問。法官李素蘭一度提高聲線問：「如果我的秘書告訴我他出席了行政會議，難道我不會問他原因嗎？」黎回應：「但他不是我的秘書。」法官追問，美國國家安全委員會不開放予公眾，Mark Simon 必定有特別之處，能夠到訪該處。黎指 Mark 聘請了惠頓作為顧問，亦認識博明，可能博明邀請他到國安委。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭問，Mark Simon 是美國政府的一份子嗎？黎指不是。李素蘭接著問，他是否美國國安委或任何政府部門的一份子？黎亦指不是。另外，黎稱沒有到訪過美國國安委。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 4 January 2025, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) newspaper published an article detailing how a Chinese-run “wargame” had modelled the sinking of a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) destroyer by US missile attack. The missiles in question were the Lockheed Martin-made, US Navy/Air Force-employed AGM-158C Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). Given that these missiles are specifically designed to sink ships from range, the fact that they did so in a simulation is hardly remarkable. That such a simulation should be run and documented in a peer-reviewed academic publication is possibly a little more surprising, given Chinese military sensitivity. What is noteworthy is that the institute which ran the simulation is one that provides modelling and simulation tools for the PLA and is one of the institutes run by the China Electronics Technology Corporation (CETC), a powerful state-owned enterprise which has been involved with projects including China’s nuclear and satellite programmes. The decision of academics from the 15th Institute who presumably hold security clearances to provide interviews to a pro-Chinese government publication, a promoter of Chinese “soft power” (the SCMP) would presumably have occurred with state encouragement or at a minimum approval. This raises the question of why seemingly negative results were published in an English-language newspaper which is accessible to foreign audiences. Moreover, what can be understood regarding the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) assessment of its own capabilities based on the outcome of the exercise? This article seeks to provide some plausible rationales for the PLA to publicise the seemingly disappointing results of this simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-technical-dimensions-of-the-exercise-a-humble-brag&quot;&gt;The Technical Dimensions of the Exercise: A Humble Brag?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what was reported regarding the exercise, the wargame simulated a large clash between the US and China. The article details a simulation set in the northeastern part of the South China Sea where the US attacks a Chinese battlegroup from the “nine-dash line”, Beijing’s declared limit of sovereignty in the South China Sea. The attack consists of 10 LRASM launched from different platforms, all targeting a PLAN destroyer. The simulation sees the PLA disable both radar guidance and GPS navigation by means of electronic warfare (EW). However, the “thermal imaging” capability of the LRASM (its IR seeker) allows for a terminal navigation phase for accurate and successful targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the result of the simulation would appear negative for the PLAN, several details are noteworthy. First, the claim that the PLAN’s Type-055 cruiser was able to disable the radar on the LRASM is of interest. The reason for this is that the LRASM does not use an active radar like many anti-ship missiles, but rather relies on a passive radar for wide area surveillance using emissions from enemy ships. The advantage of passive radar is that they are a relatively difficult target for directional jamming because the location of the receiver is difficult to ascertain, unlike active radar which must emit and can thus be detected. Implicit in the Chinese claim that the LRASM’s passive radar was disabled, then, is the suggestion that the PLAN vessel was deemed to have located the missile with sufficient accuracy to enable directional jamming, which would involve transmitting false signals into the passive radar’s aperture. The jamming of the missile’s onboard radar would thus suggest two things. First, the vessel was deemed to have a very accurate sense of the missile’s location despite the LRASM’s stealthy profile. Second, Chinese efforts to develop modes of jamming passive radar, into which the state has invested funding through its talent programmes, are deemed to have borne fruit. The methods of doing so might include emitting signals which produce an interference peak on a radar’s doppler map and thus create false tracks. The PLA’s claimed success here would, if true, have ramifications both for the survivability of missiles with a low radar cross-section (which the PLA is implicitly claiming the ability to track) and for US naval efforts at emissions control and the use of passive detection in the first island chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second aspect of note is that the article claims that the LRASM’s GPS guidance was disabled 10 km from the Type-055. While the jamming of GPS-guided capabilities is not new and has been achieved by the Russians in Ukraine against JDAM, blocking signals from all of the GNSS satellites from which a missile or munition can receive signals requires jamming over a wide area, possibly requiring multiple overlapping EW systems in the case of the Russians in Ukraine. Additionally, since US munitions are programmed to not receive messages that are not in encrypted M-Code, successful jamming would imply the ability either to spoof signals in M-Code or to generate enough power that all signals are blocked. All of this would point to a robust Electronic Counter Measures suite on the Type-055 and any vessels supporting it in the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the paper talks only of the EW defences, and does not appear to consider the host of other “hard kill”, medium- and short-range options open to the PLA and PLAN. Additionally, the article references the fact that the radar coverage AWACS and fighter aircraft were not considered. As can be seen from the indignant response to the article on some Chinese message boards, many commentators have noted this omission. This could include the 1130 or 730 Close-in Weapon Systems (similar to NATO’s Goalkeeper or Phalanx) and “Hong Qi” (red flag) family of vertical launch systems, short- and medium-range models such as the HHQ 9 and HHQ 16. Given that the LRASM is a stealth missile, the degree to which these Chinese systems would be effective remains unexamined in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as mentioned, the claim that the Chinese battlegroup had a good enough understanding of the missile’s location to enable jamming of passive radar is telling. A degree of knowledge sufficient to enable directional jamming of a passive receiver would also be sufficient to enable hard kill. An implicit message might, then, be that the Type-055 could have engaged the LRASM with its onboard missiles in their terminal phase, and perhaps at even greater distances with AWACS and fighter support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-pla-active-measure-to-undermine-lrasm&quot;&gt;A PLA Active Measure to Undermine LRASM?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, the claimed fidelity of the simulation is noteworthy. What is specifically alluded to is the flight profile of the missile and the assertion of a degree of “complex details” captured in the simulation by the academic paper’s author. This may be further indication to its adversaries that the PLA knows more than perhaps the US would like them to about the missile specifications. As defence industry experts know, details of the flight profiles, link communications, navigation systems, ranges and missile speeds are generally classified, and this is certainly true for the LRASM as a state-of-the-art “stealth” missile. That there are vertical launch variants for ships and that the LRASM has been adapted for multiple aircraft types is in the public domain, but specific details are not easy to come by. Officially released data or other promotional detail is deliberately vague, and official publications state that specifics have not been released for security reasons. It is, however, true that much can be gleaned from open source investigations, and it is not unheard of for classified details to appear on public forums; especially if the unwary are being specifically probed for such information. A classic example of such a disclosure was the well-publicised case of Challenger II tank specifications being released on a “War Thunder” gaming forum in order to try to win an argument. It is possible that the simulation was modelled around best guesses and supposition, or that technical specifications were (as claimed) garnered from prolonged and diligent open-source research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as discussed, it is of note that the simulation was run by the North China Institute of Computing Technology (NCICT), the 15th Research Institute of CETC. As a Chinese state-owned conglomerate, it has been implicated on multiple occasions in cases of “export violations” with certain US-based technology companies. The role of the 15th Institute and its parent organisation in the Chinese defence ecosystem would suggest that its researchers have access to classified data. Through its claims to be able to accurately model the LRASM’s flight profile and radar cross-section, the PLA would appear to be tacitly claiming to have either penetrated classified US systems or deduced highly classified data using available information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does, however, raise questions regarding the veracity of the claims. If the PLA was truly confident in its success in accessing sensitive data, it would have strong incentives to keep this private to achieve surprise in a conflict rather than alerting the US to the compromise of critical systems. Perhaps the PLA deems the programmatic disruption to LRASM resulting from any inquest within the US that this revelation causes to be a worthwhile result, especially if the programme is too late in its development for vulnerabilities to be easily fixed. However, if disruption is the aim, it should be noted that a similar effect could be achieved through false claims as well. As a historical analogy, we might consider how the USSR attempted to strengthen the hands of critics of the Strategic Defence Initiative by leaking (often spurious) technical data that reinforced the idea that any missile shield could be easily penetrated. One interpretation, then, is that the PLA is trying to undermine a programme which causes it genuine concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pla-focus-on-realistic-blue-forces&quot;&gt;The PLA Focus on Realistic Blue Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the simulation likely tells us something about the modelling and simulation work conducted in support of the PLA, both in terms of the intelligence which supports it and the levels of realism being sought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the simulation and in particular the absence of AWACS support and hard kill measures is of interest. This is, perhaps, explicable given the institute which conducted the modelling. The Beijing-based NCICT specialises in military model development and the development of major projects in aerospace measurement and control systems. The parent corporation of CETC also advertises itself as working in radar and EW-related technology. It is therefore unsurprising that the wargame appears to have limited itself to testing EW defensive measures. Industry wargaming, unlike defence ministry or military wargaming, works with different constraints and may have different or more focused aims. These can range from product design, development and testing to demonstrations and sales. It is perhaps in this light that the article should be viewed – as a declaration of capability in EW and a statement of competence to the West (and especially the US), but perhaps also an internal pitch that the NCICT has done its bit, and that it is for others to within the PLA and industry to move in by, for example, providing countermeasures against IR seekers (on which the LRASMs relied after their radar malfunctioned).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the PLA is increasingly not a stranger to wargaming, and invests heavily in this and “opposing force training”, with “blue” (or enemy) forces occasionally even going so far as to wear the uniforms of the forces they are representing. The emphasis on using models with high levels of fidelity and dedicated experts on adversary forces is considered by the PLA to be critical to meeting Xi Jinping’s demand for realistic training and ensuring the combat effectiveness of a force that has not seen combat since 1979. The danger of what the PLA calls the “peace disease” is one that China’s leaders are acutely aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Chinese leaders and planners seem aware that the PLA’s lack of combat experience is both a limitation and something which likely opponents may perceive as a weakness, advertising the fact that Chinese wargames are not just scripted exercises in which the PLA always wins might, then, be seen as a way of making the PLA more credible in the eyes of its opponents. The message may be that unlike, for example, the Russian military before Ukraine – which was plagued by the habit of subordinates painting excessively rosy pictures to their superiors – the PLA is a force which confronts its own deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the accompanying risk that the negative outcome leads an opponent to downrate its assessment of Chinese equipment is mitigated. Any potential adversary – in this case the US – will know that the limitations of the simulation as discussed in the SCMP article will be well understood by the PLA, and the findings of a military run wargame are unlikely to be so well publicised. In addition to the hard kill options and AWACS support mentioned above, the wider principles of anti-access/area denial would be at play, making any scenario as proposed in the simulation far more complex, multi-layered and multi-dimensional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Chinese article was an interestingly stark acknowledgment that the US is the enemy, rather than using a nameless adversary with capabilities similar to the US that often features in exercise and wargames. Although framed as a “humble brag” with the loss of a PLAN destroyer, the article clearly advertised a certain Chinese confidence in the inevitable arms race in which China and the US, as technological world leaders, are engaged. The (possible) NCICT sales pitch hints at a certain level of knowledge and understanding, and leaves much unsaid for the US to consider as it continues in the development of increasingly complex, stealthy and long-range anti-ship missiles. It is therefore an article of interest to many “defence watchers”, but manages to deliver some very specific messages.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英：若修例目的確實引渡逃犯 便不會有百萬人上街 官質疑可能因市民誤解&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Klq1KxN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（22日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第123日審訊，黎智英第31日作供，控方繼續盤問黎。2019年7月，黎與時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧見面後，翌日出席史丹福大學胡佛學院的公開講座對談，期間主持人稱香港政府提出修訂《逃犯條例》，意不在將謀殺犯引渡回香港，而是將北京眼中的異見者送回中國內地，黎聽罷稱：「對。」控方指出，黎聽到主持人的錯誤說法時，卻未有即場糾正，顯示他正在嘗試誤導觀眾。黎則否認誤導觀眾。黎認為政府聲稱為了引渡謀殺犯是一個藉口，並指如果這是修例的真正目的，便不會有超過百萬人上街遊行。控方和法官均指市民可能是在誤解之下上街。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，7.21元朗站白衣人襲擊事件之後，黎向 Mark Simon 表示希望邀請美國議員訪港，調查暴力，以制止建制派使用法外暴力打壓運動。當時得悉美議員正在到訪亞洲，因此嘗試經前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚接觸美議員，使他們更改行程提早來港。惟美議員最終在9至10月來港，黎智英確認在港會見了3名共和黨參議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎向蓬佩奧談及制裁-黎稱不記得&quot;&gt;控方指黎向蓬佩奧談及制裁 黎稱不記得&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨日控方證據提到，黎於2019年7月9日赴美國與時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧見面。會面前一日，蓬佩奧助手 Mary Kissel 提供建議，提及制裁中共人員和香港官員子女的概念，亦提到將香港和台灣形容為冷戰時期的柏林會有好處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行今提到，黎的確有在會見蓬佩奧期間提到制裁。黎一度反問：「我有說過制裁嗎？」控方指黎有，並且獲得報導，遂展示2019年7月25日的《蘋果》報導。當中指，黎在何俊仁主持的網上節目「細說中南海」中談及與蓬佩奧會面，蓬佩奧問黎：「美國可以怎樣做？」黎則回答美國可以實施制裁，讓中國官員知道其所作所為會有後果。惟黎庭上稱不記得自己如此向蓬佩奧說過，只記得自己在其他場合說過類似言論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑黎未有明言核武是比喻-黎反駁當你使用比喻時不會明言那是比喻&quot;&gt;官質疑黎未有明言「核武」是比喻 黎反駁：當你使用比喻時不會明言那是比喻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年7月10日，即黎與蓬佩奧見面之後翌日，黎出席「保衛民主基金會」（Foundation for Defense of Democracies，簡稱 FDD）的公開講座對談，並向黎展示對談錄音謄本。黎形容中國與美國之間進入「新冷戰」，是關乎價值的鬥爭，而香港正在「前線」，又稱美國政府有「道德權威」（moral authority），其對香港的支持是「核武」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭質疑：「當你談到核武的時候，別人怎樣知道那是一個比喻？」黎則重申他正在談論美國的道德權威。李素蘭反駁指：「你所想的與別人聽到的是不一樣」，問黎是否同意。黎僅稱：「OK，我同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另引述黎在講座中稱「中國是敵人。」黎則否認，強調他是指價值方面，不代表他說中國是敵人。控方問黎，那麼中共是否敵人？黎則同意，但他否認憎恨中共，因為他沒有仇恨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，別人聽到黎的言論，可能會覺得黎正在與美國人共同作戰、反抗中國，黎又提到「核武」，「然而到結尾你未有明言那是一個比喻。」黎則反駁：「當你使用比喻時，你不會明言那是比喻。」他重申，他只是說香港人為美國一致的價值而戰鬥。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱修例是藉口非為找出謀殺犯-控方質疑有意誤導&quot;&gt;黎稱修例是藉口非為找出謀殺犯 控方質疑有意誤導&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，主持人在講座中提到，香港政府提出修訂《逃犯條例》，意不在將謀殺犯引渡回香港，而是將北京眼中的異見者送回中國內地，黎聽罷稱：「對。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，當時台灣發生一宗謀殺案，之後疑犯逃到香港，修例目的是為了將身處香港的疑犯引渡回台灣。黎在庭上稱，雖然將謀殺犯引渡回台灣是修例目的，但客觀效果（ramification）是可以將異見者送回中國內地。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，黎聽到主持人說修例不是意在引渡謀殺犯回港，然而黎並未有即場糾正其誤解，顯示他正在嘗試誤導觀眾。黎則否認誤導觀眾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，黎認為政府聲稱修例是為了引渡謀殺犯是一個藉口？黎同意，並指如果修例確是為了引渡謀殺犯的話，便不會有超過百萬人上街遊行。控方指，那可能是因為誤解。法官杜麗冰接著指，那百萬名市民可能是在誤解之下上街，正如黎般。李官亦指，那百萬名市民可能是因為黎的言論而產生誤解。黎僅回應：「我並不是那麼強大和具影響力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/h3JUH6I.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蓬佩奧助手曾提議將香港視為冷戰時期柏林-控方指黎一直銘記於心&quot;&gt;蓬佩奧助手曾提議將香港視為冷戰時期柏林 控方指黎一直銘記於心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在講座中提到，當前美國總統甘迺廸到達柏林的時候，他說：「我是一個柏林人。」這給了當時的柏林人很大信心和希望，去面對蘇聯的威脅。法官李運騰問到，當黎提及柏林的時候，是否在借用 Mary Kissel 的主意。黎同意。法官李素蘭問，當黎與 Paul 討論時，是否再得到更多啟發。黎亦同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2020年的網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，有好幾集均提及柏林面對蘇聯威脅，是因為黎將 Mary Kissel 的建議銘記在心。黎不同意，他稱在節目中將台灣比喻為柏林，是想說如果台灣失守的話，便會打擊西方的信譽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎撰寫文章初稿-提議美國拒絕向有份打壓香港的中港官員子女批出學生簽證&quot;&gt;黎撰寫文章初稿 提議美國拒絕向有份打壓香港的中港官員子女批出學生簽證&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎於2019年8月8日向 Mark Simon 傳送一篇時評文章的草稿，並吩咐對方檢查和修改，以讓黎之後傳送給其教父兼《華爾街日報》編輯 Bill McGurn 。黎在庭上解釋，記憶中 Bill McGurn 提議他就胡佛對談的內容撰寫成文章，因此他撰寫了上述文章，打算傳送給 Bill McGurn 是因為 Bill 的英文比他更好，冀對方能修正他的英文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎的文章草稿籲美國人向當地的議員寫信，讓香港狀況維持在美國的政治議程之內，以及利用制裁來阻止中國侵害香港的自由，舉例指拒絕向有份打壓香港的中港官員子女批出學生簽證。文章最後一句說：「我們已經去除奴隸制度，為何不去除暴政！」（“We have eliminated slavery, why not tyranny!”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰一度關注文章有否在香港境內發布，並提到在訊息當日國安法尚未實施，可能衍生到法律爭議。控方則指訊息可以反映黎的心思意念，以及他在《國安法》前後繼續其行為的意圖。黎在庭上確認文章沒有在香港發表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，「我們已經去除奴隸制度，為何不去除暴政！」中的「暴政」是否指中國。黎僅指是「暴政」而不代表是中國。法官杜麗冰問「我們」是指誰人？黎指全世界的人。控方問：「包括你？」黎回答：「包括全世界的人。」控方則說：「不包括我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎先後提出拒批和撤銷中港官員子女的學生簽證-控方提議一個比一個進取&quot;&gt;黎先後提出拒批和撤銷中港官員子女的學生簽證 控方：提議一個比一個進取&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示2020年5月29日發布的文章「Do My Tweets Really Threaten China’s National Security?（我的推文真的威脅到中國的國家安全嗎？）」，當中提到：「There are other ways to retaliate against China for its repression of Hong Kong: Revoking student visas for the children of both Chinese Communist Party and Hong Kong officials, and increasing scrutiny of party corruption abroad, for example.（有很多報復中國打壓香港的方法：撤銷中共和香港官員子女的學生簽證，以及提高審視黨員在海外貪污情況，舉例來說。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上同意「撤銷中共和香港官員子女的學生簽證」屬一種制裁。黎亦解釋「充份審視黨員在海外貪污情況」的意思，因為很多貪污的錢都存放在美國的銀行帳戶之中。法官李運騰問，若然中國政府要求美國將貪污的錢歸還給中國的話，黎會否贊成？黎稱會贊成。李官接著問，黎贊成的話，那麼似乎是在提出中美之間司法互助，而不是提議制裁。黎則回應，他表示贊成是因為李官作出了假設。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎實際上有提及凍結中共官員的銀行帳戶。黎同意。控方續指，黎在2019年8月提議美國拒絕向中港官員子女批出學生簽證，直至2020年5月，黎已提出撤銷中共和香港官員子女的學生簽證，可見黎的提議一個比一個進取。黎則表示在簽證方面同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎要求張志偉報導博爾頓會面-否認屬編採指示&quot;&gt;黎要求張志偉報導博爾頓會面 否認屬編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年7月11日，黎向時任《蘋果》動新聞平台總監張志偉（Nick Cheung）傳送訊息，要求他報導黎與時任美國國家安全顧問博爾頓（John Bolton）會面。張志偉其後將新聞〈【逆權運動】晤美國國家安全顧問博爾頓 黎智英促請支持鼓勵香港年輕人〉傳送給黎，並表示已將新聞置頂和推送。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Mek8WV7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ John Bolton（左）、Donald Trump（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上稱，他向博爾頓談及香港的反抗運動，呼籲美國以行動來支持香港。控方問黎口中的「行動」是否包括懲罰香港官員。黎稱他沒有這樣說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指從報導截圖可見，黎在2019年7月的訪美之行除了會見蓬佩奧和博爾頓之外，還有會見不同議員，包括共和黨參議員克魯茲（Ted Cruz）、加德納（Cory Gardner）和斯科特（Rick Scott），目的是為了游說他們作出行動，包括制裁中港官員。黎堅稱他僅游說美國議員支持香港，作出鼓勵也是「行動」的一種，否認相關行動包括制裁，「這是你的用字，我沒有說過制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰質疑，黎向張志偉要求報導，屬於下達編採指示。黎否認，強調他要求發表報導並不代表是指示，若果有一則具新聞價值的消息，他提供給對方，並不屬於「指示」；然而要求對方怎樣做，或者怎樣使用該新聞，才是屬於「指示」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官的追問之下，黎稱：「如果你認為這是一個指示的話，我無法跟你爭辯」，但他強調任何人也可以向記者提供新聞。杜官反駁指黎是一名老闆、是一名高層。黎堅稱他只是叫張志偉處理新聞，不同意這是編採指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱2019年7月渴望邀請美國議員來港調查暴力&quot;&gt;黎稱2019年7月渴望邀請美國議員來港調查暴力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年7月21日，黎與 Mark Simon 之間的訊息，當中黎提到：「Let’s treat the trip of the senators and congressmen as a trip of fact-finding of violence of HK resistance movement.（讓我們視眾議員和國會議員的行程為一個調查香港反抗運動中的暴力的行程。）」黎亦提及邀請時任眾議院議長佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）和共和黨議員盧比奧（Rubio）來港調查事實，黎並叫 Mark Simon 一起商討「有什麼游說工作可以做（“And what lobbying exercise we should do to accomplish it?”）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，當時黎渴望邀請美國議員來港，調查反修例中的暴力。黎同意，惟他指佩洛西和盧比奧最終沒有來。控方指共和黨參議員克魯茲（Ted Cruz）和斯科特（Rick Scott）在2019年10或11月有來港。黎同意，但強調他們是主動來港，與上述提及的調查暴力行程不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;721後黎擔心重演六四-冀邀請美議員來港介入以制止暴力&quot;&gt;7.21後黎擔心重演六四 冀邀請美議員來港介入以制止暴力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年7月23日的訊息，黎向 Mark Simon 說：「7.21元朗的黑社會暴力，必定是建制派陣營默許的，以製造恐懼制止反抗運動。這種想法預示了天安門屠殺會重演。我們要叫美國議員去調查暴力，不能再拖下去，以發出警告，去打破建制派打算使用法外暴力打壓運動。」黎又說：「讓我們使美國介入這種暴力，以制止它」，並吩咐 Mark Simon 與前白宮資深顧問惠頓商討，以組織一個訪港團。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，Mark Simon 告訴黎，7.21襲擊事件在美國國會山莊（Capitol Hill）上被討論，特朗普亦被傳媒問及7.21事件。Mark 續指，經他與惠頓數次商討後，得悉參議員克魯茲會連同美國參議員代表團，計劃在2019年10月到訪亞洲。Mark 稱前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）會協助經國務院接觸議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uSUIdki.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎回覆稱很好，形容美國議員愈快到訪香港的話，與便愈能扣連到事件，香港人便愈感受到支持，而建制派便會承受愈多恥辱。Mark Simon 提到有的代表正在前往台灣，「而我們正在嘗試騎劫（hijack）。」黎回覆：「他們可以到香港，之後到台灣，這樣能夠顯示港台兩地團結一致對抗中國。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上解釋，當時美國參議員準備前往亞洲或台灣，他們嘗試令該些議員更改行程，先前往香港。黎並同意當時希望美議員愈早訪港愈好。控方問，為何郭明瀚需要經國務院接觸議員？黎則稱不理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎是否請求美國議員來訪香港？黎則指，他們本來已打算到訪亞洲，而香港是其中一站，他只是希望美議員能比原定計劃更早來到香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;特朗普稱香港示威為暴動-黎同意部份示威是暴動-但大部份和平&quot;&gt;特朗普稱香港示威為「暴動」 黎：同意部份示威是暴動 但大部份和平&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2019年8月2日的訊息，黎向 Mark Simon 傳送一則新聞，提到時任美國總統特朗普將香港示威稱為「暴動」，採用了中國的措辭。黎表示：「這出自特朗普口中，實在令人很失望。」Mark Simon 回覆指這是不好的，他已接觸博明（Matt Pottinger）及其他人，認為特朗普只是態度過於隨意。黎回覆：「好的，我們需要找出他的下屬發生了什麼事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎為什麼感到失望？黎表示忘記了當時前文後理。法官杜麗冰問黎是否同意特朗普稱呼香港示威為「暴動」？黎起初表示不同意，但是在連番追問下，黎表示「這某程度上可以被稱之為暴動」，因它不完全是暴動，有的人只將目光集中在部份年輕人，但是整體而言大部份示威都是和平的。控方追問黎是否同意特朗普的說法？黎回答：「對，有一部份是暴動。」控方追問，那為何黎會在訊息中表示「失望」？黎重申他不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及訊息中的博明（Matt Pottinger）。黎指博明是美國副國家安全顧問，又指他與 Mark Simon 互相認識，但是黎則不太認識他，因他不在香港，一直在美國工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美國眾議員去信蓬佩奧要求停售武器予香港警方&quot;&gt;美國眾議員去信蓬佩奧要求停售武器予香港警方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年8月3日，Mark Simon 向黎傳送訊息，告知他美國眾議員 Chris Smith 和 James P. McGovern 已去信蓬佩奧等官員，促請美國停止向香港警隊出售武器和人群控制工具，亦要求蓬佩奧以最強烈的言辭，去反對特區政府將香港示威定性為「暴動」。Mark 又提到，特朗普因為「暴動」說法而被批評。（Trump is catching hell for “riots”…）黎回覆：「希望他找到方法去反駁它。（Hope he finds a way to repudiate it.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問黎，剛才黎說同意特朗普的「暴動」說法，為何又在訊息說希望他能反駁。黎稱他同意部份示威是暴動，因為有部份示威者是勇武年輕人。控方質疑黎未有明言希望特朗普反駁哪一部份。黎僅回答，他在訊息中只是說特朗普會找到方法反駁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎不同意-mark-simon-與美國政府關係密切&quot;&gt;黎不同意 Mark Simon 與美國政府關係密切&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年8月3日，黎向 Mark Simon 說：「在晚飯期間，只需要向他們報告議員的調查事實之行（fact-finding trip）及郭明瀚的角色，不要談及我或我的行程。」被問到為何不要談及他、「行程」是指什麼行程，黎表示不記得，也不知道 Mark 跟誰人晚膳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於郭明瀚的角色，黎指他有份協助推動調查事實之行。但黎同時提到郭明瀚是一名民主黨員，而當時想邀請的議員都是共和黨黨員，他不知道郭明瀚是否認識他們。法官李素蘭問到，雖然郭明瀚是民主黨黨員，但他亦獲特朗普政府提供工作機會，所以顯示他與共和黨的關係足以密切到獲得工作職位？黎則回應，郭明瀚是一個高級的外交人員，特朗普政府可以利用他這個特質。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，黎是否同意 Mark Simon 與美國政府有密切關係？黎不同意。控方質疑，從 Mark 的訊息可見，他向黎提供了很多內部消息。黎則指該些消息是從新聞報導得知，並非內部消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問，Mark Simon 如何認識蓬佩奧助手 Mary Kissel 等人。黎指因為他與《華爾街日報》非常密切，而 Mary 等人是《華爾街日報》的時評寫手，所以認識他們，其後 Mark Simon 經黎認識了他們。控方又問黎是否與美國國務院關係密切？黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2019年9至10月美議員訪港-黎會見3名議員&quot;&gt;2019年9至10月美議員訪港 黎會見3名議員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年9月10日的訊息，Mark Simon 向黎報告指，他們被要求將行程推至10月，以更接近「香港法案」有所實際行動的時候。黎同意當時他們正計劃在10月訪美，惟他不知道訊息中的「香港法案」是指什麼法案。黎確認當時一方面計劃邀請美國議員來港；另一方面正計劃在10月訪美。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，Mark Simon 於2019年9月18日告知黎，一眾參議員將會訪港，而共和黨參議員克魯茲（Ted Cruz）亦會於10月上旬訪港。控方續指，黎於9月29日與共和黨參議員斯科特（Rick Scott）在香港見面；其後於10月12日與克魯茲見面；至10月14日，黎與共和黨參議員霍利（Joshua Hawley）見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到在會面時談論了什麼，黎表示事隔已久不記得。控方問是否談論香港狀況，或是游說美國實施制裁？黎表示不會揣測，重申已不記得會面內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

Counter-ransomware strategies would benefit from further interrogation from this community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hostile cyberattacks on hospitals, energy infrastructure, and strategic ports. Retaliatory offensive cyber operations carried out by Five Eyes members. Ransomware bears many of the hallmarks of the kind of cyber conflict long imagined by academics, military planners, and policymakers, albeit one waged primarily by law enforcement agencies and financially motivated criminals rather than cyber commands. Indeed, the FBI recently announced that its agents have conducted over 30 disruption operations against ransomware criminals in 2024 alone, emphasising the importance of ransomware as a strategic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, scholars of cyber conflict largely overlook ransomware. This leaves policy debates about ransomware poorer. Given the increasing use of offensive cyber operations and other tools of statecraft in counter ransomware strategies, more scholars should seek to interrogate the assumptions and concepts that underpin their implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ransomware-in-cyber-conflict-studies&quot;&gt;Ransomware in cyber conflict studies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, strategic studies has focused on cyber competition and conflict in interstate relations. Academics are split between framing cyber operations as an intelligence contest or using the US-driven lens of persistent engagement. This literature has successfully tempered inflated expectations about one-off, strategically decisive cyberattacks, and helped re-orient policymaking and the study of cyber conflict towards an approach focusing on the cumulative effects of campaigns. However, these debates remain narrowly tailored to state-centred dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, theorists on offensive cyber operations have not convincingly demonstrated how these frames – drawn upon to assess interstate cyber behaviour – can be applied to countering ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This disconnect is perhaps best illustrated in the widely influential cyber persistence theory, which maintains that the structural condition of interconnectedness, as well as continuous network exploitation below armed conflict, tacitly fosters an “agreed competition” between state adversaries. While proponents argue that “the strategic principle of initiative persistence remains valid against non-State actors”, there has been little sustained exploration of what value persistence can actually bring to countering ransomware actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is despite repeated evidence that ransomware operators’ prioritisation of financial gain defies structured competition, not least in their frequent disregard of the risk calculations that otherwise shape geopolitically motivated state behaviour in cyberspace. Ransomware operators have brazenly disrupted US critical infrastructure – including hospitals, oil pipelines, and food production – at a tempo and scale that no state adversary has come close to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barring Max Smeets’ upcoming Ransom War book and a conference paper by legal researchers on the impact of Western cyber operations on the ransomware ecosystem, cybercrime and ransomware have been relegated to the periphery of strategic discussions on offensive cyber operations. Not a single prominent strategic studies or international relations journal has published an article focused on ransomware. Even when issues of cyber deterrence and non-state actors are raised, the focus of countermeasures has remained on traditional law enforcement levers like indictments and prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In circles where states’ offensive cyber operations against ransomware actors have taken centre stage, US researchers have framed the discussion primarily around the question of authority. The debate has focused on whether such operations should fall within the purview of law enforcement or military action – of course with important implications for legal oversight and global cyber norms – rather than critically examining the strategic assumptions and efficacy of counter-ransomware cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-ransomware-boring&quot;&gt;Is ransomware boring?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of critical interrogation is symptomatic of a deeper issue: a cultural and strategic bias that downplays ransomware as less significant than state-sponsored cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, ransomware lacks the geopolitical gravity and technical tradecraft typically associated with state-sponsored operations. As Ciaran Martin, former CEO of the UK National Cyber Security Centre, quipped earlier this year, ransomware may simply be “politically boring” in comparison to other cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world preoccupied with great power rivalries, particularly US-China competition, researchers and policymakers have instead – to borrow the words of former US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Chris Krebs – “fetishised” advanced persistent threats (APTs), state actors that conduct sustained campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon goes beyond the study of cyber conflict. The cyber threat intelligence industry, with the exception of a few firms focused on cybercrime, has long prioritised reporting on advanced and persistent state actors. Although there are commercial incentives for this – as has been emphasised elsewhere – it also reflects the lived experiences and mindset of the ex-government and military intelligence professionals that dominate the industry. Given that theory-building in cyber conflict studies often relies on data-rich reports crafted by these vendors, the cyber threat intelligence industry’s preferences reinforce the academic emphasis on state activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interrogating-counter-ransomware-strategies&quot;&gt;Interrogating counter-ransomware strategies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does the lack of strategic studies focus on ransomware matter? In the simplest terms, because ransomware policy would benefit from the same type of theory-building and debate that has informed the development of strategic and operational concepts for state activity in cyberspace. Strategies to counter ransomware go beyond a mere collection of rules and decisions; they are rooted in a broader set of beliefs and assumptions that shape how policymakers define problems, interpret information, and choose solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the US counter-ransomware strategy, which increasingly emphasises law enforcement-led disruption operations through offensive cyber and other means. This is despite lingering questions about the theory of change for this approach and its underlying assumptions. Is it simply a version of persistent engagement, which the 2023 US National Cybersecurity Strategy nods to in asserting that “disruption campaigns must become so sustained and targeted that criminal activity is rendered unprofitable”? If so, does this mean that theories advanced for interstate competition and deterrence have simply been shifted onto ransomware? If that is the case, more discussion is required to understand how the goals, strategies, and risk calculus of criminals, particularly those harboured or tacitly endorsed by hostile states, are different from governments and intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also unanswered questions about the unintended consequences of the current approach by the US, UK, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In going after major ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) providers – criminal groups that develop and rent out ransomware tools to affiliates – James Babbage, former commander of the UK National Cyber force and current director general for threats at the National Crime Agency, has observed that the “criminal industry is effective at amending its activities and business models dynamically”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has recently been highlighted by Europol, which noted that the damaging of RaaS reputations by law enforcement prompted high-level affiliates to “lessen their dependence on ransomware service providers’ infrastructure”, instead relying on increasingly decentralised and more elusive forms of partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the questions and challenges that would benefit from more interrogation and debate by scholars and researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-for-academic-conflict-on-ransomware&quot;&gt;The need for (academic) conflict on ransomware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As researchers at a national-security-focused think tank, we are ourselves part of the echo chamber that has largely treated cybercrime as an afterthought or distraction from cyber competition and conflict between states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this neglect comes with risks. First, without interrogation and challenge from those outside government, counter-ransomware strategies risk being built on shaky conceptual foundations. Second, strategic studies scholars could sideline themselves from policy debates about a cyber threat that arguably has a far greater impact on society and the economy than most state-backed cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a new US administration likely to put renewed emphasis on using offensive cyber operations to achieve its goals, now is a better time than ever for scholars to shine a light on the theories and assumptions of counter-ransomware strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, scholars may reinvigorate increasingly tired debates about cyber deterrence and the utility of offensive cyber operations. They may also come to discover what we have: ransomware is one of the most compelling cyber strategy dilemmas of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late November 2024, the Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), which is led by RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) and supported by the National Endowment for Democracy, held a workshop in Helsinki to discuss the challenges and successes of sanctions implementation and enforcement in Finland. The meeting brought together representatives from Finnish national authorities and financial institutions (FIs), as well as compliance experts and private sector stakeholders. Discussions underscored Finland’s evolving role as a key player in European sanctions policy, particularly in response to Russia’s ongoing aggression in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report synthesises insights from the workshop to provide an overview of Finland’s sanctions journey, the private sector’s perspective, the country’s unique challenges, and the practical steps taken to ensure compliance and enforcement. It also captures recommendations made by the representatives of Finnish public authorities and the private sector attending the roundtable discussion that are more broadly applicable across the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finlands-sanctions-journey&quot;&gt;Finland’s Sanctions Journey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants underlined throughout the meeting that Finland has been proactive in adapting to the EU’s stringent sanctions regime against Russia, a process accelerated by the geopolitical urgency stemming from the war in Ukraine. The country’s geopolitical and economic situation has been profoundly influenced by Russia’s illegal war. The invasion heightened security concerns, prompting Finland to abandon its longstanding military non-alignment and join NATO in 2023, marking a historic shift in its defence policy. Economically, Finland has reduced reliance on Russian energy and trade, diversifying its energy sources. Participants noted that the number of companies importing goods from Russia has fallen from about 2,000 to only several dozen, one of the biggest decreases in trade with Russia in the EU. This pivot has bolstered ties with Western nations and incentivised Finnish businesses to search for new partners to compensate for the challenges posed to Finnish industries by the loss of Russian markets. Regardless of the incurred losses, the views of private sector participants were encapsulated by one participant, who noted that Finnish industry stands for Ukraine and sees Ukraine’s victory as in its vital interest and a prerequisite for Finland’s long-term economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Finland had relatively limited experience with sanctions enforcement, with only one to three cases annually. This has since increased to nearly 900 cases under investigation, reflecting the sheer scale of the sanctions regime and its impact on trade patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participant representing the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (MFA) noted that in building Finland’s sanctions capacities, Finnish authorities had leaned on prior expertise, including frameworks established in response to earlier sanctions, such as those following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. However, the magnitude of recent sanctions necessitated a steep learning curve, especially in the MFA, which serves as Finland’s national competent authority (NCA) for sanctions implementation. In response, the MFA has rapidly expanded its sanctions advisory and enforcement capabilities. As noted by one participant, it was clear to the MFA from the early days of the EU sanctions rollout that it needed to provide advice and guidance to Finnish companies to empower the private sector to achieve effective implementation. With this in mind, the MFA undertook reforms and offered practical services, such as an “Infoline” and an online training programme. Participants also noted that due to limited exposure to other sanctions regimes, such as UN Security Council designations against North Korea, the legal expertise of law firms in Finland about sanctions was limited. Representatives of the private sector noted that this gap was promptly bridged by the MFA and now is increasingly filled by chambers of commerce that are taking over the advisory role and assisting Finnish industries in understanding the sanctions framework and compliance challenges. For example, one representative of industry shared that one of the chambers provides Dow Jones screening services to its members, which is particularly valuable for Finnish small and medium enterprises (SMEs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To coordinate national efforts and facilitate the implementation and enforcement of sanctions on Russia, the MFA coordinates three working groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Financial Sanctions Taskforce, which is focused on cooperation with the banking sector and regulatory bodies such as the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Sanctions Circumvention Prevention Taskforce, which was established in 2023, involves 10 public authorities, and analyses trends to pre-empt circumvention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Public-Private Cooperation Working Group, which is a forum for dialogue between the public and private sectors, including the Confederation of Finnish Industry and FIs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;limitations&quot;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high degree of ongoing and well thought out coordination does not entirely resolve the challenge of constrained resources. Many Finnish authorities faced significant resource limitations in scaling up enforcement efforts. One participant noted that the FCA identified over 30,000 anomalies in trade flows since 2022, yet conducted checks on only 10% of these cases, due to staffing constraints. Similarly, participants representing Traficom shared that they had to reprioritise existing resources to address sanctions-related challenges in aviation and logistics without receiving additional funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the private and public sectors noted that deficiencies posed by constrained resources are in part mitigated by excellent cross-sectoral cooperation. As one participant noted, Finland is a small country, and stakeholders know each other very well, therefore communication is direct. There is a shared understanding that all sectors are in the same boat and this joint motivation has a highly positive impact on the national sanctions community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants highlighted that sanctions on Russia have had a significant impact on Finland’s transportation sector, particularly in aviation and railways. A representative of Traficom emphasised that aviation faced significant hurdles due to airspace restrictions and the lingering impact of Covid-19, necessitating the reprioritisation of resources, and collaboration with military and border authorities. The agency has played an important role in the implementation of sanctions, as it has issued flight exemptions and ensured compliance and enforcement despite limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For railways, the customs authorities have been responsible for enforcing sanctions that caused a sharp decline in Russian cargo transit through Finland (as a representative of customs noted, for some goods, such as stones and fertilisers, this reduced from 50% of the total EU cargo to less than 1%). Participants from all national agencies responsible for the implementation of sanctions in the transportation sector underlined the importance of the effective inter-agency cooperation taking place in Finland, and the valuable support they received from the MFA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;asset-freeze-and-confiscation&quot;&gt;Asset Freeze and Confiscation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, the unique Finnish asset freeze laws were discussed, particularly in the context of sanctions against Russia. In Finland, the National Enforcement Authority has extensive powers to investigate and freeze various types of assets. This includes not only real estate but also company shares and other financial holdings. The authority operates by receiving substantial information from FIs to identify sanction violations and asset concealment. Additionally, it provides guidance to businesses to ensure compliance with the sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the sidelines of the workshop, participants commented on a recent asset confiscation case in Finland, where the court had ordered $4.25 billion in assets owned by Russia in the country to be confiscated at the request of Ukrainian state firm Naftogaz. Media reported that the National Enforcement Authority was executing the order in connection with an April 2023 judgment from a Hague tribunal related to compensation for Moscow’s seizure of Naftogaz property when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. This decision is an interesting precedent, and may trigger further reaction against Russian assets across the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-sector-perspective-and-challenges&quot;&gt;Private Sector Perspective and Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the sanctions against Russia reinforced Finland’s alignment with EU policies and reduced its economic vulnerability to Russia, they also necessitated increasing sanctions compliance capacities across FIs and industry, as well as the restructuring of export strategies and supply chains to minimise economic fallout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants noted that, after almost three years of unprecedented roll-out of the EU sanctions on Russia, bigger companies have a solid overview and understanding of their clients, and therefore of sanctions risks. Finnish banks and other FIs swiftly adjusted to comply with EU sanctions and mitigate exposure. However, despite national efforts, gaps remain in SME preparedness. As highlighted during the workshop by representatives of both the public and private sectors, the MFA has taken a proactive role in advising Finnish businesses, responding to 600–700 inquiries annually and providing tailored guidance, targeted outreach initiatives and press releases summarising each new EU sanctions package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in light of the constraints on national resources, private sector representatives advocated for the establishment of an EU-level SME sanctions due diligence helpdesk and enhanced end-user checks to support compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants discussed the impact on Finnish key industries, such as forestry, machinery and technology, of the loss of the Russian market, which had been a substantial trading partner. The energy sector, in particular, experienced challenges as Finland moved swiftly to end its dependency on Russian energy imports, leading to increased costs in securing alternative supplies. Finnish industry now complements public efforts to mitigate the economic consequences of Russia sanctions for Finnish businesses through organisations such as EastCham Finland (renamed from the Finnish–Russian Chamber of Commerce), which has reoriented its focus towards Central Asia to help companies diversify trade routes away from Russia. One participant representing Finnish industry noted that not all trade with Central Asia was related to sanctions circumvention and therefore bad. Before 2022, Finnish companies had exported goods to this region via Russia, but they are now actively seeking direct partnerships through the offices of EastCham in Almaty and Kyiv. The chambers have been actively supporting its members in knowledge and expertise to prevent circumvention, which remains a key consideration for Finnish corporates when trading with Central Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also discussed the pivotal role that the FCA and the FIU have in sanctions enforcement. A participant representing the FIU noted his institution has encouraged obliged entities to adopt a low reporting threshold for suspicious activity reports related to sanctions, enabling the collection of comprehensive data. With over three years of data, Finnish authorities are now building typologies to detect circumvention patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Circumvention remains a significant challenge, particularly in trade with the Central Asia region. Even though Finnish companies have adapted by reconfiguring supply chains to avoid Russia, FIs have increased due diligence with key clients, and the national authorities actively provide guidance, participants agreed that gaps in EU-level guidance on ownership, control and end-use verification persist. To mitigate this, representatives of banks pointed to the need for automated systems to detect circumvention of sectoral sanctions, similar to those used in anti-money laundering processes but tailored to the unique dynamics of sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-gaps-and-bolstering-effectiveness&quot;&gt;Addressing Gaps and Bolstering Effectiveness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable discussion addressed questions about how to improve the implementation of sanctions in Finland and the EU. Foremost, participants stressed the importance of: incorporating implementation feasibility into sanctions design; cross-border cooperation; and enhanced support from the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the private sector said Finland could further bolster its sanctions regime by updating the guidance on ownership control and increasing resources for enforcement agencies. Additionally, publishing anonymised findings from non-criminal investigations into sanctions compliance failings provides valuable learning opportunities for businesses. As one participant pointed out, to make sanctions more effective, it is necessary to make them more understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from government bodies and the private sector expressed a strong stance on a need for the European Commission to accelerate the assistance it offers to member states. The key request from participants was for the Commission to publish guidance and impact assessments concurrently with new sanctions legislation, as well as enhance transparency through codified changes to legislation. The Commission highlighting changes would ease the burden on the public and private sectors of investigating novelties in each EU package, which is especially challenging for SMEs that do not have an in-house compliance team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the FCA suggested simplifying regulations to facilitate implementation, particularly for SMEs. FCA officials noted that the technical complexity of export control regimes and the reliance on intricate tariff codes hindered effective compliance. One participant suggested adopting simpler frameworks, such as a blanket ban on trade with Russia with specified derogations, to enhance clarity and reduce circumvention risks. Participants agreed that currently, the fragmented nature of EU sanctions regulations poses interpretative challenges for Finnish authorities and businesses, and that the European Commission should be more proactive in advancing the EU framework and mitigating the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of one area where the European Commission could provide more guidance, one participant outlined the challenges for the private sector around navigating the TARIC, the integrated Tariff of the European Union database. According to the participant, whose opinion was echoed by other attendees, the database is difficult to use; they recommended that relevant codes be flagged as high risk to help companies identify risks quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also pointed to challenges related to the cross-border nature of the implementation of sanctions. Discussions highlighted disparities in sanctions enforcement across EU member states, with interpretations seen as becoming less stringent the further one is from Russia’s borders. On a positive note, Finland has actively collaborated with Baltic neighbours to align practices, leveraging pre-existing information-sharing mechanisms tested during the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a consensus among participants that detecting circumvention at the international level requires effective communication with not only other EU member states, G7 countries and partners from the Global South, but also domestically, between national authorities and the private sector (corporations and FIs). Effective data exchange between all of these parties is also key. To develop comprehensive models and typologies to address circumvention, all institutions need to understand the broader context through comprehensive datasets. One participant pointed out that there is often a delay between the investigation of cases and their public disclosure, which can hinder timely learning and adaptation. In terms of communication and information sharing, one representative of the FIU noted that Finnish authorities exchange information with other EU member states via Europol and FIU.net, and underlined that the communication between FIUs has been an effective vehicle and gateway to other national authorities that otherwise might be difficult to engage with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one workshop participant representing the Finnish private sector opened a discussion on the requirement for unanimity in EU decision-making on sanctions and the significant challenges it poses to the adoption of a robust and unified sanctions regime against Russia. Any member state can block or delay decisions, which, the participant said, can lead to prolonged negotiations and watered-down measures. It also creates opportunities for states with closer economic or political ties to Russia to exert disproportionate influence, potentially undermining the EU’s collective stance. Participants noted that the unanimity requirement often obscures the effectiveness of the sanctions regime by fostering compromises that weaken the measures’ scope and enforcement, reducing their impact on Russia’s economy and war capabilities. Participants representing the private sector agreed that Finland, as a country which has a strong commitment to supporting Ukraine, and where the geopolitical and economic situation has been profoundly influenced by Russia’s illegal war, would benefit from departing from unanimity and embracing other options, such as the qualified majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussions at the workshop demonstrated Finland’s remarkable adaptability in responding to the EU’s expanded sanctions regime against Russia. Through proactive engagement with the private sector and collaboration across public agencies, the country has established itself as a leader in sanctions enforcement and dynamic and collaborative thinking. However, challenges related to resource allocation, regulatory complexity and EU-wide harmonisation remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Helsinki workshop underscored the importance of aligning sanctions design with practical implementation, and fostering trust between public authorities and private stakeholders. As sanctions evolve, Finland’s experience offers valuable lessons for other EU member states, especially small industrial countries, navigating similar challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia regained the momentum on the battlefield in Ukraine last year. Although Russian progress remains slow and costly, the outlook for the year ahead is bleak. Ukraine’s energy system has been heavily damaged by Russian air strikes, and its forces continue to lose ground in southern Donetsk, where the heaviest fighting is taking place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, political shifts in some of Kyiv’s key allies – especially the US – could result in crucial financial and military aid being substantially reduced in the year ahead. Together, these trends raise the prospect of Ukraine being forced to accept a crushing defeat after three years of heroic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this lugubrious backdrop, many analysts have seized on what appears to be a rare bright spot: Russia’s faltering “war economy”, which – according to some – is “Putin’s greatest weakness”. An acute labour shortage, persistent and rising inflation caused by soaring military expenditure, and ever-tightening sanctions will – it is claimed – finally bring about an economic crisis that will force Moscow to abandon its maximalist aims in Ukraine and bring about an end to the war on terms more acceptable to Kyiv and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, these hopes are likely to prove misplaced. Russia’s economy has confounded expectations throughout the war and, despite suffering several complications, remains well-placed to support the Kremlin’s ambitions in Ukraine and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dashed-hopes&quot;&gt;Dashed Hopes…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that Kyiv’s supporters have placed their hopes in Russia’s economy proving to be its Achilles’ heel. In the early months of the war, analysts forecast that Russia would suffer a severe and long recession that would cause living standards to slump and the state’s fiscal resources to dwindle. Moscow, it was hoped, would be forced to make an embarrassing retreat with potentially fatal consequences for President Vladimir Putin and the ruling elite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these hopes were soon dashed. The imposition of capital controls, a surge in federal expenditure, and the successful reorientation of foreign trade at breakneck speed arrested the signs of economic distress observed in the first months of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia did not avoid a recession in 2022, it was much shallower than expected (GDP fell by only 1.9%) as the economy adapted to its new circumstances. Growth exceeded nearly all expectations in 2023 (3.6%), with this momentum continuing into 2024. Output is likely to have expanded by 3.6–4% last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raised-again&quot;&gt;…Raised Again&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the quantitative expansion of the last two years has been accompanied by growing signs of weakness on several important economic indicators, raising questions over the quality and sustainability of Russia’s better-than-expected performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mounting labour shortages, fuelled by the demands of war, are just one factor that threatens to derail growth. The massive expansion of the military and defence-industrial production has drawn large numbers of men away from the civilian labour force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with rising demand from other sectors of the briskly growing economy, this has caused the supply of labour to tighten considerably. Unemployment reached 2.3% in October, a post-Soviet record low. Maintaining the current rate of economic growth will only be possible if Russia utilises its existing labour force more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labour shortages are not the Kremlin’s only problem. Western sanctions and a shrinking trade surplus contributed to a sharp depreciation of the ruble last year, causing import prices to rise and amplifying inflationary pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of November, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) recorded an annual inflation rate of 8.9%, well above the bank’s target rate of 4%. Even this rate likely understates the real extent of price growth, with some staple goods registering price increases in excess of 70%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0fxFdgq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to quell inflationary pressures, the CBR raised the key rate throughout the year, setting it at a post-Soviet high of 21% in October. Many businesses now find the cost of borrowing prohibitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many analysts have attributed these signs of overheating to elevated spending on the war in Ukraine, pointing to record-high military expenditure which is expected to have reached over 7% of GDP in 2024. With defence spending expected to rise by nearly 25% this year, accounting for around 40% of federal government expenditure, some have raised the prospect of Russia slipping into “stagflation”, combining high inflation with low to no growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, with new UK and US sanctions targeting Russia’s oil industry, and G7 states seeking to tighten the enforcement of the oil “price cap”, some hope that Moscow’s vital hydrocarbon revenues will be crimped even further, exacerbating the losses caused by the collapse of Russian gas exports to Europe and flagging coal sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;desperate-but-not-serious&quot;&gt;Desperate but not Serious&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, hopes of an imminent economic crisis are unlikely to be realised. Although Russia undoubtedly faces significant challenges, there is little to suggest that these will result in any significant political consequences that might prompt the Kremlin to rein in its ambitions in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tight labour market has benefitted many Russians used to stagnant income growth in the decade before the war. Real wages have soared since 2022, fuelling the fastest sustained growth in consumer spending in over a decade. Soaring military production and record-high wages for soldiers have helped reduce some of Russia’s chronic regional inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the absence of a large pool of latent labour need not constrain growth so long as labour productivity continues to rise. Russia’s low-productivity economy means that there are plenty of easy wins available for firms prepared to undertake simple organisational changes or investment in new machinery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation also has its advantages. Rising prices send important signals to firms to expand supply by investing in areas where prices are growing fastest. Investment – chronically low for most of the post-Soviet period – has grown faster than GDP since the war began. Rising prices have also helped swell public coffers, with turnover taxes like VAT growing at record levels and boosting the Kremlin’s fiscal position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CBR’s record-high key rate is not as damaging as it might be in a Western economy, either. Large swathes of Russian business – including those in strategically important sectors – can access state-subsidised loans at considerably lower interest rates. Even those firms unable to access subsidised loans will be able to use record-high retained earnings to finance investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian consumers have also benefitted from state support. Most mortgages offered during the recent housing boom were taken on at subsidised rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the extent to which Russia has a “war economy” is exaggerated. While the broad NATO measure of military expenditure is likely to account for around 40% of federal spending this year, this will amount to closer to 20% of Russia’s consolidated state spending (that is, including both regional and national expenditure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this is high, it is comparable to US military spending during the Vietnam War. The militarisation of the economy has undoubtedly grown. However, it remains well below the crippling levels observed in the “hyper-militarised” Soviet economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, many of the features of true war economies – such as price controls, the centralised allocation of resources, and widespread nationalisation of private sector assets – have yet to appear in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sources-of-resilience&quot;&gt;Sources of Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia’s weaknesses are not as severe as many hope, its sources of strength and durability also remain impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the country’s balance sheet. Despite fighting the most intense war in Europe since 1945, Moscow has managed to fund the war with staggeringly modest budget deficits of between 1.5–2.9% of GDP since 2022. As a result, the Kremlin has barely had to borrow to fund the war. At around 15% of GDP, Russia has the smallest state debt-to-GDP ratio of the G20 economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being cut off from most external sources of capital, Russia remains more than capable of financing domestic investment and government expenditure with its own resources. Over the past two years, Russia has recorded a surplus on its current account – that is, the gap between aggregate savings and investment – of around 2.5% of GDP. For as long as Russia can continue to export large volumes of oil, this is unlikely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the Kremlin’s fiscal position remains very healthy. Tax revenues generated by domestic activity have soared since the war began. Oil and gas revenues are forecast to account for 28% of federal government tax receipts in 2024, significantly lower than the 53% recorded in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VmCyqev.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if export revenues slump, perhaps due to a looming trade war or China’s spluttering economy, Russia has plenty of resources it could tap to maintain elevated levels of state spending. The largely state-owned banking system is sitting on piles of cash that could be paid as dividends to their owner: the state. Banks could also be directed to buy government bonds, as they were at the end of 2024. If all else fails, the CBR could buy government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, Russia’s resilience is not purely financial in nature. The foundations of the market economy built in the turbulent 1990s remain strong. Much of Russia’s unexpected adaptability has come not only from its well-trained and professional economic managers, but also from its large and growing class of private business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accustomed to operating in an often hostile and challenging business environment, privately owned firms have exploited the opportunities created by sanctions to supply soaring demand from the government and consumers. The number of registered private businesses has grown briskly since the war began, reaching a record high in 2024. It is this strong base of commercially oriented firms that will enable Russia to continue adapting to sanctions and the demands of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;calibrating-expectations&quot;&gt;Calibrating Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, Russia’s economic prospects are far from rosy. Property rights remain weak, and the state’s role in the economy is high and growing. The vagaries of the international oil market always retain the potential to generate a strong external shock. Western sanctions will also continue to raise the cost of doing business and restrict the flow of know-how to Russian businesses. As a result, Russia is unlikely to join the ranks of high-income countries any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the country’s poor long-term prognosis should not lead us to overlook its short-term resilience. Throughout its 500-year history, Russia’s economic system has rarely delivered broad-based growth or economy-wide innovation for long. Instead, the needs of the market have usually been subordinated to the needs of the state, often to enable the Kremlin to pursue security-related objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s system is no different. Designed to ensure that the Kremlin can pursue a sovereign foreign policy against the interests of the collective West, it is doing its job. The market is strong enough to give the system adaptability and dynamism. And the state is strong enough to ensure that sufficient resources are mobilised towards achieving its security objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For as long as this equilibrium remains intact, Russia will be able to generate the necessary economic resources to sustain enough military power to wage war in Ukraine and, over the longer term, to rearm for a prolonged confrontation with the West. Any hopes that its economic vulnerabilities will bring it to the negotiating table are therefore unlikely to be realised.&lt;/p&gt;

To do this, government must be able to attract high quality talent in the Digital, Data, and Technology sectors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technical talent in the civil service is key for the new Labour government to achieve its objectives, particularly given its commitment to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of employing consultants, and driving innovation and high-quality jobs across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the government must improve pay and other incentives to attract and retain skilled professionals in critical Digital, Data and Technology roles in the civil service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The civil service struggles to recruit and retain technology personnel including in cyber security, data science, and IT operations. Civil service salaries lag behind the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This leads to delays and vacancies. For example, it took nearly three years to appoint a Chief Digital and Information Officer. The new government aims to improve public service delivery through adopting digital and data driven solutions: launching patient passports in the NHS and a National Data Library. However, the successful delivery of these will require technically skilled people inside the government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, the government should make the Government Digital and Data (GDaD) capability framework mandatory for all departments and centralise the costs of salary incentives. This should be expanded to include cyber and data security roles, and protected by a “double lock” in annual increases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on the success of initiatives in the AI Safety Institute (AISI), the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) should consider selectively reclassifying other non-AI technology roles under R&amp;amp;D spending to make salaries more competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While salary will never be the main motivation to become a civil servant, pay should signal that the government values these positions, and should meet a minimum threshold to compete with the private sector. For roles in science and technology, this requires meeting a higher bar than some other specialist roles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivering on the new Labour government’s missions requires talent at the heart of government. However, uncompetitive salaries for Digital, Data and Technology roles hampers the government’s ability to recruit and retain talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a particular challenge for the new government, which hopes to deliver on digital public services, including NHS patient passports and a National Data Library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a digital workforce in the Civil Service is no small feat. The Conservatives set a target for 6% of Civil Service roles to be in the Digital, Data, and Technology profession. Today, it is just 4.8% and has barely moved from the 4.7% the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Alex Chisholm, former Permanent Secretary at the Cabinet Office, one of the primary barriers in hiring digital and technology professionals is uncompetitive pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly the former Deputy Prime Minister said “a cyber specialist knows they can earn five to seven times, if not more, for the same role in the private sector”. The previous government committed to improving salaries and a holistic offer for government technology roles, admitting “we must be competitive to stay ahead”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compete on salary, the previous government introduced the Government Digital and Data (GDaD) capability framework. The framework allows participating departments to identify critical roles, such as data scientist and software developer, and provide proficiency based pay uplifts. Some roles fall outside the GDaD framework, including data security and cyber security, though we understand similar salary incentives schemes are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unrealistic to think the government can – or should – match private sector salaries, bonuses, and perks. Matched salaries would drive up public spending and potentially further increase taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The civil service offers job security, favourable pensions, a good work-life balance, social impact and training opportunities. However, it also needs a realistic offer on pay if it wants to attract the tech talent necessary for digital government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the UK National Cyber Security Centre recently posted a Lead Cyber Security Expert role with a base salary of £41,935, adding £6,250 for London weighting and skills payments starting at £8,840. If Departments face shortages with specific roles, they can also add retention allowances, which would bring the total salary to around £60,000. This is still far below private sector rates - where senior cyber security experts can expect to earn between £80,000-120,000, but £60,000 is far more competitive than the advertised base salary of £41,935.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting a minimum skill level for positions – based on the GDaD framework – before they are hired could allow departments to list actual expected salaries including skills payments. Displaying the base salary without skills-based add-ons can discourage people from applying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the GDaD framework successfully provides salary incentives, it is hard to know if it has been impactful. Only some departments are part of the scheme, and only a few have published details of its use; for example, the Ministry of Justice reported that it had boosted pay by £22 million for qualifying officials in 2022-23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, wider trends cast doubt on the GDaD framework’s effectiveness. Without controlling for the relative seniority of professions, average Digital, Data and Technology salaries rank 16 out of 31 Civil Service professions, and only just exceed the median. Education and Training Inspectors, a group of just 1,000, lead the pay scale with a median salary of £80,740. Policy roles, which encompass 34,000 civil servants, hold the fourth–highest median salary at £48,790 - 12% higher than Digital, Data and Technology salaries (£43,350).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other issues with the GDaD framework include the fact that pay uplifts do not respond to market rates and are not updated in line with inflation. Retention allowance payments are capped within grade bounds - i.e., you cannot earn more than the grade salary cap without changing jobs. Finally, departments are not automatically enrolled in the GDaD framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;low-pay-increases-reliance-on-consultants&quot;&gt;Low Pay Increases Reliance on Consultants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without sufficient technical personnel, the government brings in consultants. From 2019-2023 spending on management consultancies increased by around 75%. In 2023, the majority (70%) of consultancy spend was on bringing in specialists to meet technical needs. Initiatives, such as COVID test and trace were a big part of this demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists Mariana Mazzucato and Rosie Collington have argued that excessive use of consultants has been costly for government and undermined the ability of public institutions to meet citizen’s needs. Similarly, the Institute for Government has said that politicians consistently overstate the amount of money saved through outsourcing services and highlighted several high-profile contracting failures including welfare assessments. Research has also found that governments which use consultants demand them more as their own capacities diminish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore no surprise that many former civil servants turn to consultancy. The government, which still needs their expertise, sometimes then contracts them back at a higher rate. This can create an unfortunate scenario where the government pays a premium to a consultancy firm to contract an ex-official who now receives a higher salary, but which is still paid for by the public purse. If salaries were higher in government, it is reasonable to think that many would not leave to become consultants - helping drive retention and save public money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new government has committed to stop “excessive” and “non-essential” spending on consultants, with the aim of halving spending from 2025-26 and saving £1.26 billion between 2024-2026. It is not clear how the government will meet this shortfall in personnel without retaining or hiring more civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civil service headcount is at a 10-year peak, due partly to Brexit and the pandemic, so there is likely to be an overall decrease in the size of the workforce. Improving the salary offer for those working in digital, data and technology roles can improve the talent density even as overall civil service numbers fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Conservative government put forward proposals to “strengthen the digital pay framework” in their Civil Service People Plan 2024-2027, which Labour is not expected to cancel. Nevertheless, the plan has scant detail with the exception of an ambition to improve pay progression within grades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-opportunity&quot;&gt;The Opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the US launched a pay incentive scheme for technical roles in the Defense Department’s intelligence components, capping it at $183,500 (around £142,000). While this is still lower than comparable US private sector salaries, it is closer than the UK scheme and evidence suggests that it has improved retention. The US approach incorporates skills-based pay incentives directly into the base salary at a fixed rate per position. This diverges with the GDaD Framework, under which pay incentives are added to the base salary and are set based on skills assessments linked to a four-tier capability framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Singapore, some parts of the government benchmark salaries against top US tech companies – Meta, Alphabet, Netflix, Google and Amazon. High pay for government officials, even relative to the private sector, matches the strong financial incentives for elected members and ministers in Singapore: ministers earn around £645,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US and Singaporean approaches better reflect the cost of competitive salaries. For the UK adopting a similar approach to pay would be costly. If the Digital, Data and Technology profession grew to 6% of the Civil Service (30,000 staff), with salaries at £81,000 (top 5% earner), their total wage bill would hit £2.4 billion – 15% of total Civil Service salary costs or approximately 0.18% of total government expenditure in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might suggest that consultants are actually cost effective, as the 2024-26 savings (£1.26 billion) are only half the annual wage increase, and pay top-ups do not factor in additional costs such as employer pension contributions. On the other hand, it also does not account for how GDaD framework payments are currently costed and only considers “non-essential” consultants. Nor does it assess the impact on retention or whether more skilled tech personnel could reduce costs by digitising government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;examples-from-other-parts-of-hmg&quot;&gt;Examples From Other Parts of HMG&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make a fairer comparison of impact, it is worth highlighting two other UK government initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pivotal Role Allowance is an incentive payment for departments to retain “flight risk” senior civil servants in critical technical roles. Allowances are allocated to specific roles where there is a high risk of incumbents leaving and are removed when roles are vacated or the need passes. Payments are made in instalments and are proportionate to timescales, for example up to £20,000 for 24 months or up to £10,000 for 12. The notional cap on total allowance payments is 0.5% of the overall pay bill for senior civil servants (£670 million) or around £3.3 million. When combined with base salaries and GDaD framework pay incentives, salaries for the most senior technical roles can approach £200,000. However, the Pivotal Role Allowance only applies to current officials and cannot attract new talent, contributing to the nearly three-year-long delay in hiring a Civil Service Chief Digital and Information Officer mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of competitive civil service salaries is found in the AI Safety Institute (AISI), where salaries far exceed average civil service pay. The top salary for a grade 7 digital role in most departments is £78,000, while in AISI it is around double that figure. Because spending on salaries at AISI has been classed as research and development (R&amp;amp;D) under capital expenditure, it does not face normal salary restrictions. Clearly, where there is a will to pay technical civil servants more, a way can be found. The previous Conservative government’s focus on AI unlocked significant spending. A similar approach from the new Labour government, in a similarly targeted selection of technical roles, could deliver real impact in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;local-and-regional-impact&quot;&gt;Local and Regional Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The civil service aims to decentralise digital talent and embed expertise across the UK. In 2023, 79% of digital roles in the civil service were based outside London. Over a 5 year period, digital, data and technology roles were in the top 25% of civil service professions by share of personnel based outside of London and the South East. New thematic hubs and campuses, such as those in Manchester, Bristol and Glasgow are helping drive regional growth by embracing local digital talent and strengthening ties with academia and industry. Increased pay for technical specialists in these areas would support the government’s aim to promote economic growth across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond salaries, the Civil Service has become a hub for technical training. Initiatives like the new TechTrack apprenticeship pathways foster in-house talent and promote mid-career retraining. Similarly, secondment schemes for technical talent provide a different approach to relying on consultancies and align with commitments to public-private-partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plan-of-action&quot;&gt;Plan of Action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People do not join the civil service to make a lot of money. For most people, the biggest drivers include the opportunity to create social good while also enjoying a stable and secure career path, an outstanding pension, and good work-life balance. However, while these factors are important, civil service salaries must meet a sufficient threshold to successfully recruit and retain talent. This is a particular problem when it comes to technical experts in science and technology, where private sector salaries are comparatively significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide competitive technical salaries across government, and improve recruitment and retention, the Central Digital and Data Office, Cabinet Office and HM Treasury should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the GDaD framework mandatory for all departments (with a cap on positions) and centralise the costs of salary incentives.&lt;/strong&gt; This would help alleviate budget concerns that have deterred departments from adopting the framework, such as trade offs between salary costs and delivering essential functions. To avoid a misaligned incentive for departments to excessively hire GDaD professionals or misclassify roles, a cap should be set per department which is renegotiated periodically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-assess salaries for technical roles against the GDaD framework and adjust them prior to listing.&lt;/strong&gt; This means that listed salaries would reflect actual total salaries, removing uncertainty for applicants, particularly those outside the civil service. Positions will also therefore need to have a baseline skill level rather than the tiered approach of the GDaD Capability Framework, similar to the US approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinvest cost savings from reduced consultancy spending to improve pay for targeted technical roles.&lt;/strong&gt; This would help retain highly skilled personnel and allow a more competitive salary offering that will contribute to building in-house capability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore guaranteed annual increases to GDaD Framework salary incentives through a double-lock mechanism.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider committing to introduce a system where GDaD Framework incentive payments are adjusted annually to reflect inflation or an indexed increase or decrease in comparable private sector salaries. This approach could help align payments with market conditions, increasing their competitiveness. Similarly, this mechanism could also account for decreases in demand for certain positions due to sector-level use of efficiency technologies such as AI.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make cyber and data security roles eligible for GDaD framework incentive payments (or similar).&lt;/strong&gt; Extend the GDaD framework to include digital/technology roles in the Government Security Profession, such as Cyber and Technical Security. Harmonising frameworks prevents a double-standard for how government values similar technical roles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow Digital, Data and Technology professionals to sacrifice employer pension contributions for higher salaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Officials should be able to set the balance between their pay and pension.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DSIT should consider reclassifying select non-AI technology roles under Research and Development spending to provide more competitive salaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Drawing from the success of the AISI, other key technology roles should benefit from enhanced pay structures to attract and retain high-calibre talent in government. While reclassification of personnel expenditure is not a cure-all, it is a good example of a proven mechanism to unlock higher salaries for targeted high priority roles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extend the number of technology positions that can receive pivotal role allowance.&lt;/strong&gt; Pivotal role allowance - incentive payments to retain officials - should be expanded to cover certain technology positions at grades 6 and 7 such as Head of Cyber Security, Lead Infrastructure Engineer, and Head of Data Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英及泛民就反修例會見美國官員 前美領事郭明瀚及蓬佩奧助手獻計&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/E9Ffr3v.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（21日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第122日審訊，黎智英第30日作供。控方繼續盤問黎，提到2019年3月政府將《逃犯條例》修訂草案交立法會審議，前政務司司長陳方安生同月赴美國會見時任副總統彭斯，黎吩咐張劍虹將新聞「做到最大效果」。黎向李柱銘說，當時華盛頓氣氛是反中及支持反抗的力量，形容「現在似乎是在華盛頓游說的好時機。」黎同月開始與泛民等人商討訪美之行，期間提議前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚參與，因其人脈和影響力可令他們有機會在美國國會上提出《逃犯條例》議題。同年5月，李柱銘會見時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧，郭明瀚事前向李提出數項建議。至同年7月，黎與蓬佩奧見面之前，亦獲蓬佩奧助手 Mary Kissel 提供建議，提及制裁中共人員和香港官員子女的概念，可以融合於制裁打壓中國西部穆斯林的中共官員的概念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;郭明瀚獲特朗普政府接觸-提供工作機會&quot;&gt;郭明瀚獲特朗普政府接觸 提供工作機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行繼續盤問黎智英。昨日證供提到，黎在2017年6至11月期間，反覆催促時任台灣總統蔡英文的「左右手」江春男安排蔡會見前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚，以協助台灣在華盛頓重建外交渠道。2018年3月，蔡英文與郭明瀚會面成事之後，黎繼續向江春男傳送訊息，要求盡快考慮使用郭明瀚的能力和人脈關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今繼續就此盤問，並展示2018年9月2日，郭明瀚傳給黎私人助手 Mark Simon 的訊息，郭表示美國國務院曾接觸他，邀請他重返政府工作，若果他接受相關職位的話，便無法向台灣提供顧問服務。Mark 其後將訊息轉發給黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上表示，以他所知，郭明瀚最後未有重返美國政府工作。控方提到，昨日訊息顯示郭明瀚與拜登團隊關係密切，但是他同時獲特朗普政府提供工作機會？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎形容蔡英文政府令人失望&quot;&gt;黎形容蔡英文政府「令人失望」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月19日，黎向郭明瀚傳送訊息，稱「很高興你和陳方安生吃飯」，相信前政務司司長陳方安生能夠告訴郭明瀚更多有關香港的事情。黎接著表示：「蔡英文政府很令人失望。他們沒有兌現他們的承諾。我會尋求每個機會讓你幫助我們的鬥爭和台灣與北京的鬥爭。（“I’ll be looking at every opportunities to have you help our struggle and Taiwan’s with Beijing.”）」黎其後又將訊息轉發給 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎為何形容蔡英文政府「令人失望」？黎表示忘記了。控方追問是否因為蔡英文未能作出安排讓郭明瀚替台灣工作？黎稱不是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問「台灣與北京的鬥爭」是什麼意思。黎表示台灣與北京交涉一直都是一種「鬥爭」，因為是很困難，所以是「鬥爭」。黎亦同意「我們的鬥爭」是指香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到當時是2019年3月，《逃犯條例》修訂草案正準備交立法會審議。因此黎在訊息中稱尋求每個機會讓郭明瀚幫助，是指《逃犯條例》修訂？黎同意他可能是這個意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;郭明瀚指逃犯條例修例草案對整個香港而言是危險&quot;&gt;郭明瀚指《逃犯條例》修例草案對整個香港而言是危險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示 WhatsApp 訊息，黎於2019年3月23日向民主黨李永達傳送新聞連結，有關陳方安生會見時任美國副總統彭斯，而彭斯稱極關注香港人權自由。黎向李稱：「她見了彭斯！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否對於陳方安生與彭斯會面感到興奮？黎一度反問控方：「為何你說我感到興奮？」控方指從黎訊息中的感嘆號可見。黎最終同意感到興奮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示訊息，黎向李永達傳送一則長訊息，有關郭明瀚與陳方安生吃飯期間的討論內容。郭明瀚形容陳方安生關注《逃犯條例》修訂，並知道有需要「打敗」它。郭明瀚提到當時似乎香港泛民間未有凝聚、團結一致或任何計劃，而陳方安生認為修訂會以某種形式獲通過，郭明瀚則建議她要集中精神在修例上，因修例草案對整個香港而言是危險。郭明瀚表示會幫助黎和香港，建議他們應該在4月底之前好好討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李永達收到訊息後，回覆黎：「我們應該集合力量去引起公眾關注引渡條例。」黎回覆：「你是對的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎有否建議郭明瀚在陳太會見彭斯之前，與陳太見面？黎稱沒有，又指陳太與郭明瀚本來互相認識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，為何郭明瀚會將他與陳方安生的討論內容報告給黎？黎指郭明瀚僅向他提供資訊，因為郭明瀚是他的朋友，並且知道他關注香港。法官杜麗冰則指，訊息似乎不只是向黎報告討論內容，郭明瀚也有提出幫助香港，又建議黎在4月底之前討論。控方遂問黎，當時有否要求郭明瀚就香港提供意見？黎稱沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭斯與陳方安生會面-郭明瀚曾建議黎將新聞做到最大效果&quot;&gt;彭斯與陳方安生會面 郭明瀚曾建議黎將新聞做到最大效果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰提到，記憶中黎曾將陳方安生會見彭斯的新聞，傳送給不同人。控方遂指，黎當時將相關新聞傳送給民主黨李永達、何俊仁、工黨李卓人、時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹和時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏等人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，郭明瀚曾建議黎，「要有一個計劃去解釋，將它（新聞）做到最大效果。」（“Jimmy, it’s not enough to get it around. There should be a plan on how to explain, use it to best effect. Advice from Jim Cunningham in Washington.”）黎將訊息轉發給張劍虹，並吩咐：「大新聞，用它做到最大效果，謝謝。（“Big news. Use it to maximum effect. Thanks, Jimmy”）」張之後回覆「老闆，早安，收到。謝謝」。黎確認。翌日（3月24日）《蘋果日報》報紙頭版以〈彭斯晤陳太 關注港人權 學者：高規格接待向京施壓〉作為標題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到有否指示張劍虹報導彭斯與陳方安生會面，黎同意。控方提到，黎早前在主問階段亦同意是次有下達編採指示。黎表示他只是想向張強調這次會面很重要。控方接著問黎是否按照郭明瀚的指示，去指示張劍虹和陳沛敏「做到最大效果」？黎否認是跟從郭明瀚指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎向李柱銘稱華盛頓氣氛反中-是游說好時機&quot;&gt;黎向李柱銘稱華盛頓氣氛反中 是游說好時機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年3月24日，黎與李柱銘之間的對話，黎向李說：「對！現在似乎是在華盛頓游說的好時機。氣氛是反中和支持反抗的力量。兩黨對中國的敵意是明顯的。（“Yes! Now seems good time to lobby in Washington. The atmosphere is anti-China and pro-resistant forces. The hostility towards China in both parties is palpable.”）」黎在庭上表示，認為當時陳方安生做的事情是屬於游說，即引起美國的關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，李柱銘告訴黎，其秘書 Minky 提議將訪美之行延遲至5月中，他們會再討論。黎則回覆，對於《逃犯條例》而言，5月中可能太遲。黎其後又指：「只要他們在《逃犯條例》上未有放棄，你的訪美之行無論如何都會很重要。我們必須尋求公眾支持，在他們強推之前阻止它。」黎庭上表示，當時似乎有一群人計劃前往華盛頓，但當時《逃犯條例》情況很緊急，「我很渴望盡快處理它。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年3月25日，黎向李柱銘轉發一則長訊息，關於陳方安生、郭榮鏗和莫乃光會見彭斯以及美國國安委員會職員的回饋意見（feedback）。黎的訊息紀錄顯示，上述訊息是從 Mark Simon 收到。但黎不知道 Mark Simon 從誰人接收到這則訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3月起計劃訪美之行-黎提議若郭明瀚參與有機會在國會上提出逃犯條例議題&quot;&gt;3月起計劃訪美之行 黎提議若郭明瀚參與有機會在國會上提出《逃犯條例》議題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月26日，李卓人傳送訊息予黎，告知他經過會議之後，決定訪美之行順延至5月中，因在陳方安生會見彭斯後短期內做重覆的事情是不合理。李又指希望行程可以有更多價值，可能是叫眾議員或參議員舉行公聽會，並邀請香港訪美團出席。李指黎早前提及郭明瀚，李提議叫郭明瀚就公聽會成效給予意見，以及與李柱銘的前秘書 Minky 合作，又提到時任眾議院議長佩洛西及共和黨眾議員 Ted Yoho 抱支持態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎回覆李，贊同5月中是好。黎提到，美國國會正被民主黨控制，而郭明瀚是一名民主黨黨員，有人脈和影響力，訪美團如果有郭明瀚的參與，可以有機會在國會上提出《逃犯條例》議題，但郭明瀚需要2個月去打通當地人脈和制定策略性做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，知不知道為什麼李卓人提議郭明瀚與 Minky 一同合作？是否因為郭明瀚能夠更易接觸到美國人脈以進行游說工作？黎堅稱不知道。至於佩洛西及 Ted Yoho 對於什麼抱支持態度，黎指是香港人的訪美之行，而非支持游說。控方又問，為什麼要在美國國會上提出《逃犯條例》議題。黎指為了討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指出，訪美之行目的之一是引起對《逃犯條例》的關注，以及提出制裁香港官員的主意。黎則同意「引起對《逃犯條例》的關注」是目的之一，但是當時未有提及過制裁，所以不知道「提出制裁香港官員的主意」是另一個目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;郭明瀚提議將反送中扣連商界和法律界是很重要&quot;&gt;郭明瀚提議將反送中扣連商界和法律界是很重要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月27日，黎向 Mark Simon 表示，考慮到未來兩年對中港關係而言是動盪不安的時候，郭明瀚可能是「我們能夠保留在華盛頓做香港游說的人」。（“He may be someone we can retain in DC for HK lobby considering the next two years will be very turbulent times for HK/China relationship.”）黎在庭上稱這只是一個隨意的提議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月27日，Mark Simon 向黎表示，與郭明瀚討論後，指郭明瀚正確地指出香港和台灣的最大威脅並不是親中共政客（panda huggers），而是失敗主義者，因他們認為香港和台灣已經回不去了。郭明瀚又指，在反送中上扣連商界和法律界是很重要，「當它變成一個人權議題的時候，便會跌入失敗主義者的偏見之中。（“… once it becomes a human right issue that plays into the biases of the defeatists.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，郭明瀚似乎提議將《逃犯條例》修訂與商界和法律界捆綁，使它不只是一個人權議題，能夠在美國得到更多支持。黎表示他沒有說同意這主意，他只是獲 Mark Simon 告知有這主意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱郭明瀚義務幫忙訪美之行-惟黎覺得有義務支付他所作付出&quot;&gt;黎稱郭明瀚義務幫忙訪美之行 惟黎覺得有義務支付他所作付出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年3月29日，黎向 Mark Simon 表示：「當你見到李柱銘的時候，請告訴他郭明瀚義務幫忙，而不是我們聘請郭明瀚，所以李柱銘不會拒絕他的幫忙。這對李的訪美之行而言是好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至同年4月1日，黎向 Mark Simon 表示，雖然他向李柱銘和李卓人說郭明瀚是義務幫忙，但我們肯定要支付他所作的付出。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上堅稱郭明瀚是義務幫忙，而沒有受聘，但黎有見郭明瀚是他的朋友，加上了解到他的處境，所以覺得有義務自掏腰包支付郭明瀚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎知悉訪美之行是推動美國懲罰香港官員&quot;&gt;控方指黎知悉訪美之行是推動美國懲罰香港官員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指從2019年4月2日，李卓人的訊息可見，泛民的訪美之行最終定於5月13日出發，因為預料政府想在7月之前通過立法。李又提及，經過他與李柱銘、Mark Simon 討論之後，有兩項實質建議，包括要求美國修訂法律，以懲罰損害一國兩制、推動《逃犯條例》修訂的香港官員；以及一旦修例通過，美國要向其公民發出旅遊警示。李亦正在考慮將反送中議題與美國貿易談判聯繫。李指在訪美之行中，會尋求召開公聽會，並會與國會議員、參議員和傳媒等見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，在2019年4月的時候，黎已經知道訪美之行是推動美國修訂法律以懲罰損害一國兩制的香港官員。黎僅稱這是別人通知他的事情。控方提到黎早前向李柱銘形容「現在似乎是在華盛頓游說的好時機」，因有反中情緒。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方引述張劍虹的證供，指稱黎在2019年3月指示管理層利用《蘋果》作為平台爭取國際支持及推動制裁。黎則指：「這一定是假的，我從沒有資格去如此指示《蘋果》。」黎又指，保持《蘋果》的編採工作獨立，是他嚴格遵守的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官杜麗冰質疑，黎曾指示張劍虹使用彭斯會見陳方安生的新聞做到最大效果。黎承認那一次的確有給予指示，但只是一次例外，從不是慣例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蓬佩奧與李柱銘會面之前-郭明瀚提出建議&quot;&gt;蓬佩奧與李柱銘會面之前 郭明瀚提出建議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年5月15日的訊息，在李柱銘會見時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧之前，郭明瀚向李提出數項建議，郭明瀚其後將相關訊息轉發給 Mark Simon，而 Mark Simon 其後轉發給黎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在訊息中，郭明瀚建議李柱銘感謝美國支持香港一國兩制，並要求蓬佩奧等人為支持一國兩制發聲。郭明瀚指美國接受香港是中國的一部份，而香港應該作為中國的願景，惟《逃犯條例》修訂削弱一國兩制和法治，影響香港作為從商地方的地位，所以需要撤回。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上指，Mark Simon 傳送上述訊息，是為了提供資訊，讓黎保持知情。惟控方指，Mark 傳送上述訊息是為了讓黎知道如何向蓬佩奧提出請求，以作國際游說；這是為了讓黎作出行動，而不只是讓黎知情。黎不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指同年7月9日，《蘋果》報導李柱銘在5月的訪美之行。其中提到：「民主黨創黨主席、資深大律師李柱銘5月率團訪問美國，爭取國際支持反對修例時，曾與蓬佩奧會面。當時美國國務院在會後發表聲明，說蓬佩奧對香港政府修訂《逃犯條例》表達關注，斥修例威脅香港法治。」控方指這一段所述與郭明瀚的建議非常相似。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，2019年6月11日，郭明瀚創立一個 WhatsApp 群組，名為「Martin, Jimmy, Mark」。郭明瀚向群組傳送訊息，透露眾議員盧比奧等人早前已去信時任特首林鄭，亦會提交法案要求修訂《香港政策法》，以聚焦認證香港一國兩制狀況。郭明瀚又指，為了向香港商界發出訊息，使他們知道香港特殊地位不是理所當然。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎早前稱抵美後才知要見彭斯蓬佩奧-控方展示訊息反駁說法&quot;&gt;黎早前稱抵美後才知要見彭斯蓬佩奧 控方展示訊息反駁說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指黎於2019年7月在美國會見彭斯、蓬佩奧和時任美國國家安全顧問博爾頓（John Bolton），而黎在早前主問階段供稱，他訪美之行本來是為了向參眾兩院議員講述香港情況，然而他抵達美國後才得悉將要會見彭斯、蓬佩奧和博爾頓。黎同意，並稱本來沒預料會見3人，可能是他抵達美國時，白宮相關人士才安排3人與他見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FddKnJB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ John Bolton（左）、Donald Trump（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎在2019年6月25日出境，先後到英國、加拿大和美國，最後在7月16日返回香港。控方亦展示一系列訊息，顯示黎在英國期間相約「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）和奧爾頓勳爵（Lord David Alton）午膳。控方亦展示6月時候 Mark Simon 的訊息，通知黎有關會見蓬佩奧的安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指從訊息可見，黎在抵達美國之前，已知道自己將會見蓬佩奧和博爾頓，質疑黎沒有道出真相。黎則稱只是忘記了相關訊息，又指他沒有理由去說謊。控方遂指黎記憶不準確，黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎與蓬佩奧見面前-其助手和郭明瀚分別提供建議&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎與蓬佩奧見面前 其助手和郭明瀚分別提供建議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎於2019年7月9日與蓬佩奧見面。黎早前供稱蓬佩奧的得力助手 Mary Kissel 多年前曾居港10年，黎在她任職《華爾街日報》期間認識她，二人是好友，惟對方返回美國之後便失去聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示訊息，在會面前一日（7月8日），Mary Kissel 與 Mark Simon 通話，提醒黎在打招呼時除了握手和說「Hello」之外，便不要做其他事，因她要保持專業形象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary 亦建議黎若有機會向蓬佩奧提出請求時，盡量說得具體，而蓬佩奧正在研究採取什麼具體行動關注香港，又指他不想談宏大議題，而是尋求可以採取的行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary又表示，認為制裁中共人員和香港官員子女的概念，可以融合於制裁打壓中國西部穆斯林的中共官員的概念。Mary 亦指，將香港和台灣升級為冷戰時期的柏林，會有好處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，訊息顯示黎在會面前一天（7月8日）告訴 Mark Simon，他曾與郭明瀚有很好的討論，以及得到一些建議。黎確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late November 2024, the Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) at RUSI hosted two roundtable workshops in Brussels to bring together sanctions experts to discuss issues of implementation. The workshops involved representatives from national authorities in the UK and several EU member states – including from financial intelligence units, ministries of foreign affairs, and other national competent authorities with responsibility for sanctions policy and/or enforcement. Also in attendance were private sector representatives from a range of companies in the insurance, maritime, industrial, legal and consultancy sectors. Research institutes also participated, as did civil society groups with a focus on anti-corruption and financial integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events form part of the programme of activities conducted by the CFS-led European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), supported by the National Endowment for Democracy. None of the discussions from either workshop are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report relates to the second workshop, which focused on the diplomatic and coercive measures available to secure greater cooperation to counter sanctions circumvention through third countries that have chosen not to adopt sanctions against Russia. These states were referred to as “sceptics” and “agnostics”, each of which has their various economic and historical reasons to oppose sanctions and/or to pursue a neutral foreign policy. Some participants also referred to these states as “middle-ground countries”, reflecting their preference for non-alignment in international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;successes-and-limitations-of-multilateral-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Successes and Limitations of Multilateral Diplomacy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participant from the British government began the discussion by presenting takeaways from diplomatic efforts the UK has undertaken with the US and the EU in third countries. These diplomats have jointly visited countries through which Russia has imported large volumes of key military items on the Common High Priority Items List (commonly referred to as the Common High Priority List (CHPL)), a list of 50 critical goods. On these multilateral visits, the UK participant said, they had faced “difficult meetings”, in which representatives of “sceptical” countries expressed four sets of concerns about the sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, intermediary countries asked why they should stop this trade when, in many cases, items had originated from EU countries, the UK or the US. In relation to this point, the UK official said that it was important to show improvements in their own domestic implementation and enforcement, which, they noted, has increased drastically since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, sceptical states also criticised complicated sanctions, and discrepancies between the different sanctions regimes. This issue had been the motivation for establishing the CHPL: “we asked exactly the same thing of each country”, the participant noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, sceptical states questioned why they should support UK, US and EU sanctions efforts. The sanctioning countries’ response had been to point out that the volume of these goods was small, and represented a fraction of a percentage of the total trade or GDP for these states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, sceptical states said that taking measures to prevent the transshipment of goods was technical or complicated. This was met with offers of targeted technical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These engagements were viewed by government participants as having been successful. For example, as a result of these visits, a fall has been observed in trade flows through the countries involved, at least for a limited time. There were also reports that some countries had increased their monitoring of their exports to Russia. Having convinced initial countries to do this, government participants said, had eased similar conversations in subsequent countries. As a result, they said, engagement with third countries had improved. In these discussions, government representatives told sceptical states that preventing transshipment of these critical goods has little impact on intermediary countries’ economies. “This is not an unrealistic ask”, one British government participant noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These solutions were not permanent, government participants admitted: in some cases, sanctions evasion and critical items transshipment began “spiking” in other countries, including Thailand and Malaysia, as a result of displacement. In other cases, officials saw a return of transshipment to the countries with which they had spoken earlier. These changes were not, one Czech government representative said, necessarily a sign of failure, but rather a feature of the continually changing nature of sanctions policy implementation. “We have seen sanctions bite and then the effect is diminished. The target of sanctions adapts, and that calls for our further adaptation”, they said. Other government participants agreed, saying: “The game of ‘Whac-a-Mole&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;’ is also a success because it imposes additional costs on Russia to move somewhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, China continues to supply most of Russia’s CHPL imports, which requires a more complicated engagement. Government representatives said that, initially, this had “felt like a problem that was too big to solve”, but they also stressed that multilateral diplomatic pressure, as well as public investigations and pressure on the financial sector, had had some impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-the-right-narrative-for-government-engagement&quot;&gt;Finding the Right Narrative for Government Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these targeted approaches to individual countries and regions, workshop participants believed that the G7 countries’ overall narrative on Russia sanctions could be stronger. One issue, a participant from a research institute said, was that the sanctions regime was seen as “an instrument of Western coercion” and, in particular, as driven by the US. As a result, sanctions were seen as a tool of a unipolar order that many middle-ground countries opposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussion turned to suggestions for how to address both the narrative and the perception of unipolarity. One clear difficulty was that many sceptical countries are willing to enforce only truly international sanctions imposed by the UN, preferring to refer to the regimes from the UK, the US and the EU as “unilateral coercive measures” that they do not recognise. The counter to this is that the UN’s sanctioning capability is now absent, due to Russia’s veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council, which has gone as far as terminating the operation of the expert panel on North Korea sanctions. Despite this, a British policymaker said that the UK had not given up on the UN, and that it continued to see important areas of cooperation on issues such as counterterrorism through international institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participant from an Eastern European research institute said there was more for their region to do to support the narrative on Russia sanctions, saying: “It is much easier for diplomats from our part of the world to present those arguments while avoiding the long shadow of colonial history.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion from participants from both the UK and EU governments was to ensure that measures to reduce harm from sanctions were better communicated. For example, there had been significant efforts to protect grain and other food supplies. Nonetheless, one researcher said, “we have failed to persuade African countries that soaring food prices are not due to the sanctions on Russia”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, with greater efforts to improve the narrative – and one participant pointed to a recent article by Josep Borrell aiming to do this – attendees agreed it may not be possible to convince the sceptical countries to support the sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;addressing-sceptical-countries-other-concerns-may-improve-relationships&quot;&gt;Addressing Sceptical Countries’ Other Concerns May Improve Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion segued into considering middle-ground countries’ concerns that the dominant narrative on Russia sanctions often overlooked human rights and corruption issues in other regions. Participants from civil society organisations (CSOs) said that their partners in regions such as Africa and Latin America were critical of sanctions’ language on universal human rights. In addition to being generally seen as “imperialistic”, participants said sceptics from the Global South believed even global human rights sanctions were applied for primarily political reasons. They pointed out that most were applied to Russian entities, which they said many viewed as further proof that human rights sanctions regimes were a tool of geopolitical censure, rather than representing genuine concerns about universal values. Human rights abuses occurred elsewhere, and the perpetrators remained unpunished. Another participant from an international CSO agreed, saying this was a missed opportunity, as “some of our best allies will be anti-corruption groups”, and that addressing local activists’ concerns was a way to foster their support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critique was the perception that the anti-Russian sanctions were led by the US, with the UK and the EU following – supporting sceptical countries’ belief that the sanctions were merely a tool in a political dispute, rather than about values. One suggestion for tackling this was that the US and the EU coordinate, so that the US would adopt sanctions imposed by the EU, as opposed to vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To truly address the sceptical countries’ concerns, a UK government official said, governments needed to not just “communicate through press releases”, but also analyse the audiences and their concerns – and then seek to address them. A researcher noted that some of these countries’ concerns relate to their dependence on Russia for support in monetary, resource and security terms. This included, for example, the food supply issues already mentioned, as well as potential energy shortages and national security issues. These security issues must be addressed through not only statements but also through working collaboratively to develop practical solutions – for example, identifying alternative energy supplies, or developing regional trade routes that bypass Russia. One participant from a private company said that sanctioning states “need to come in with the carrot of investments, not just a stick”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participant from a research institute said it would also be important to engage in more of a dialogue with sceptical countries that results in concrete solutions on issues that mattered to them. There were regional issues and conflicts of more concern to these states, where the EU and the UK might make concessions. “We need more give and take”, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;private-sector-relationships-expand-the-reach-of-sanctions&quot;&gt;Private Sector Relationships Expand the Reach of Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where participants from both the private and public sectors saw opportunities was in the nervousness of businesses, and especially banks, from sceptical countries to be exposed to the circumvention of Russia sanctions. Nervousness was driven by their need to continue to trade in international markets, and in international currencies. The private sector was therefore, as one participant put it, the “Achilles heel” of non-aligned foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant from a manufacturing company said they spent “most of their time talking to customer companies” in middle-ground countries. These conversations aimed to train local suppliers and customers about the risks of potential diversion of high-tech goods (notably those on the CHPL); the manufacturing company had introduced a certification system to its customers to incentivise learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A participant from a business group said even where countries remained unconvinced about sanctions, they just wanted to know: “What companies and entities do you not want us to trade with?” In this sense, the discussion echoed the desire from the private sector to obtain more granular information from governments about what is and isn’t allowed, which was a significant part of the discussion during the first workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The private sector’s limited risk appetite was driving wider observance of the sanctions than indicated by sceptical states’ foreign policies. But some policy analyst participants said there was also a risk that over-compliance could reduce financial inclusion. For example, G7 banks apply additional scrutiny to banks in jurisdictions known to pose higher transshipment risks. If these banks are unable to document their compliance systems sufficiently, they may lose their correspondent banking relationships. This could affect national economies and citizens’ access to banking services, particularly if multiple banks in a single country faced these repercussions. The intersection of financial inclusion and compliance with not only sanctions but also anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing regulations is a renewed concern for regulators, including the Financial Action Task Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the workshop discussion highlighted the continuing narrative challenges of gaining support from sanctions sceptics and agnostics. At the same time, the conversation revealed that perhaps the search for an ideal narrative obscures the measures that are working and could be expanded – for example, engaging with countries based on their national interests, rather than ideology. Participants believed this could be widened to consider investments and other measures to address these countries’ interests from a positive perspective (the “carrot”), rather than only engaging on potential consequences (the “stick”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses in sceptical countries may be more inclined to comply with sanctions in their trade as they recognise the repercussions of losing access to global markets. At the same time, leaving compliance to the private sector alone may lead to de-risking, which could harm financial inclusion in developing markets. Ultimately, all participants recognised that a greater focus on strategic communications is necessary if Russian disinformation about sanctions is to be confronted and the mission to restrict the resourcing and funding of the Russian military is to have maximum effect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英認促成蔡英文與前美領事郭明瀚會面 以助台重建在美外交渠道 惟否認作「美國代理人」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kTxELcu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（20日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第121日審訊，黎智英第29日作供。控方盤問圍繞黎與前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚的關係，並展示一連串的訊息，顯示黎曾在2017年6至11月期間，反覆催促時任台灣總統蔡英文的「左右手」江春男安排蔡會見郭明瀚，以協助台灣在華盛頓重建外交渠道，又指台灣應該更加進取地與美國重建緊密關係。黎否認有意影響台灣政策，強調只是將不同的想法轉述給蔡英文。黎表示「樂意幫助台灣政府」，但否認自己作為一名「中間人」或「美國代理人」。2018年3月，蔡英文與郭明瀚會面成事之後，黎繼續向江春男傳訊息，要求會見台灣外交部部長等人，法官形容黎似乎很熱衷於聯絡雙方，黎則稱只是嘗試協助台灣，並重申只是希望利用郭明瀚的能力和人脈來幫助台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指合約屬顧問合約-黎則強調需要江撰文&quot;&gt;控方指合約屬「顧問合約」 黎則強調需要江撰文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方上周五展示財務紀錄，顯示從2017年11月至2020年2月之間，台灣《蘋果日報》每月向江春男支帳約20萬元台幣，合共涉款約580萬台幣（港幣約137萬元），而江當時已任職時任台灣總統蔡英文的助手。2020年3月25日的高層電郵則提到，2019年初，社長陳裕鑫「覺得已經付了一年多，江先生也沒有替我們寫稿或做什麼事情，就親自去問黎先生，此付款是否應該繼續下去，黎先生回答繼續付款。」黎上周五在庭上堅稱與同事在溝通上有誤會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今繼續圍繞事件提問，先展示江春男與台蘋的合約，當中提到江的工作是「不定期提供乙方（台蘋）時事分析之意見或交稿」。控方稱由此可見這合約屬一份「顧問合約」，惟黎則強調「交稿」字眼代表包括江需要撰文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎上周五稱，以為台蘋基於江撰寫社評而支帳，當他得悉江沒有再撰文卻仍收款時感到「震驚」，並要求員工立即停止支帳。黎今日澄清，感到震驚是因為得悉台蘋繼續付款給江，而不是因為江沒有再撰文，因為黎早已知道江沒有再撰文。法官李素蘭問黎如何得知？黎稱從時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹的 WhatsApp 訊息得知。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎沒叫江春男還款-黎解釋稱尷尬&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎沒叫江春男還款 黎解釋稱尷尬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示黎與張劍虹之間的訊息，2020年3月24日，即電郵的前一日，張告知黎，台灣《蘋果》一方繼續每月支付江春男，黎得悉後要求停止支帳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭追問，台蘋高層電郵卻提及黎同意繼續付款？黎則稱他不記得自己曾如此說過，這也不是他的做事作風。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則問，電郵撰寫人 Johnny 有沒有任何理由要說謊？黎則估計同事可能有誤會、疏忽或看漏了，導致一直沒有人知道原來繼續支付，或者同事以為他本人同意。黎不認為 Johnny 是一名說謊者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎有否指示張聯絡江春男，或親自聯絡江春男，叫對方還款？黎說沒有，「因為這是尷尬的⋯⋯這是我們的錯誤。」控方則指涉款100萬元；黎回應說：「禮貌（Courtesy）比金錢更加重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問是否因為江春男協助安排退休美國將領 Jack Keane 和美國國防部前副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 會見蔡英文。黎聞言說：「這是你的揣測」，其後表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/U1tAFW4.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎台灣是歷史上唯一一個有民主的華人地區&quot;&gt;黎：台灣是歷史上唯一一個有民主的華人地區&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前黎證供承認自資支付 Jack Keane 和 Paul Wolfowitz 的赴台開支，法官李運騰再問及為何黎替台灣政府支付相關費用。黎則稱因為他在台灣當地有經營生意，而台灣是歷史上唯一一個有民主的華人地區，他自己亦從台灣得益。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎安排 Jack 和 Paul 會見蔡英文的計劃，與他的傳媒生意沒有關係，也沒有得到任何利益。黎同意其媒體未有從中得益，他們甚至不曾報導過，因要就相關會面保密。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到黎在2017年8月時，向蔡英文的「左右手」江春男轉達 Jack 和 Paul 飯局中的討論內容，包括提升台灣軍隊心理質素和現代化、台灣與美國簽訂能源合約。黎重申他只是協助轉達 Jack 和 Paul 的說法。李官指，當時二人已經與蔡英文會面過一次，為何黎還要協助轉達二人的說法給江和蔡？黎則解釋，縱使二人見過蔡英文，但不代表他們可以每日都聯絡她。黎又表示，即使協助轉達訊息會打擾到自己，他也會如此做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指黎於2017年主張利用台灣作為對抗中國的槓桿-國安法後繼續在live-chat節目重複&quot;&gt;控方指黎於2017年主張利用台灣作為對抗中國的槓桿 國安法後繼續在Live Chat節目重複&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到黎在2017年1月分別向江春男和博爾頓（John Bolton）準備的筆記，談到「沒有比台灣更好的槓桿」、「對中國的傷害最大」等，指黎主張美國增加在台灣的軍事存在（military presence），利用台灣作為對抗中國的槓桿。黎否認這是他的主意，當時已有其他學者談及上述說法，他只是在筆記上聯繫相關說法；但黎承認同意相關說法。控方指出黎想「對中國帶來最大傷害」，黎則否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DxGeEXQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ John Bolton（左）、Donald Trump（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方並指在《國安法》生效之後，黎繼續在其 Live Chat 節目中重複提及相關主張。黎確認相關節目謄本有提及。控方並指，黎繼續請求美國利用台灣作為對抗中國的槓桿，進行這一種敵對行為。黎則稱他從來沒有請求美國如此做，只是解釋當時局勢。控方追問黎是否同意相關主張，黎表示同意觀點不代表他有作出請求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱與郭明瀚是朋友-確認對方與拜登關係密切&quot;&gt;黎稱與郭明瀚是朋友 確認對方與拜登關係密切&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著問及黎與前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）的關係。黎稱與郭明瀚是朋友，在他任職駐港領事期間相識，但說不上是親密朋友；二人曾經見面數次，但是不肯定是否「很多次」，因對方工作忙碌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年3月5日，黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 告訴黎，拜登將被提名為美國民主黨的總統參選人，而郭明瀚似乎成為了拜登團隊高級外交政策顧問；黎回覆道：「這對郭明瀚而言是好，但是拜登不能當選。他看起來像150歲和太過“奧巴馬”。」黎庭上確認，郭明瀚與拜登團隊關係密切。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月《蘋果》準備推行英文版，同月 Mark Simon 向黎說，郭明瀚可以替他們聯繫拜登相關人士，讓拜登可以說幾句話，講述為何需要支持《蘋果》和自由媒體。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上稱，他從沒要求郭明瀚替他聯繫拜登相關人士，他當時回覆「OK, thanks」並不代表同意。法官李運騰問，當黎回覆「OK, thanks」的時候，是否在暗示他同意 Mark Simon 做這件事。黎僅指 Mark 做事總是以他的利益為依歸，，因此他沒有理由阻止 Mark。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指稱黎樂意成為一名中間人&quot;&gt;控方指稱黎樂意成為一名「中間人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上周證供顯示，黎於2017年8月向江春男傳送郭明瀚的網上簡介。黎稱因為台灣一方發現在華盛頓與美國交涉的人脈不夠有效，所以江詢問黎有沒有適合的人選來協助，黎其後推薦郭明瀚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指稱黎樂意成為一名「中間人」；黎僅回應：「我樂意去介紹其他人。」控方續稱：「作為一名中間人。」黎表示：「我沒有說中間人，我當時樂意幫助台灣政府。」控方續指：「但你是一名中間人。」黎則反問控方為何不斷說「中間人」，「中間人」可以代表很多東西，「你可以這樣說法，但是這不是真的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認意圖影響台灣政策-稱僅轉述不同想法&quot;&gt;黎否認意圖影響台灣政策 稱僅轉述不同想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上確認在2017年6月起正在計劃安排郭明瀚赴台灣會見蔡英文。同年8月，黎向 Mark Simon 提議將郭明瀚介紹給江春男，又指郭明瀚在華盛頓可以擔當幫助台灣的角色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2017年10月18日的訊息，黎催促江安排蔡英文會見郭明瀚，並向江分享想法。黎指台灣重回美國的「雷達」，故應該對於與美國重建緊密關係更加進取，並應該積極與美國交往，「外交與軍事一樣重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/70lgXHZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 蔡英文&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問黎是否意圖影響台灣的政策？黎指他只是表述不同想法，以及解釋當時形勢。李官又問，江春男是否所謂的「枱底人」？黎認為可謂江春男超越了「枱底人」，因他是蔡英文的「左右手」。李官續問，黎向江傳送上述訊息，是否一種以「枱底」的方式嘗試影響台灣政策？黎則認為不是「枱底」方式。法官李素蘭問，那是否「枱面」。黎同意是「枱面」，因江是台灣政府人員，但他只是將不同的想法轉述給蔡英文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎承認支付郭明瀚的旅程開支&quot;&gt;黎承認支付郭明瀚的旅程開支&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017年10月27日，黎向江春男傳送訊息，再度提及安排郭明瀚會見蔡英文，以協助重建台灣外交渠道，以及解決台灣在華盛頓的人脈問題。黎並要求江一方作出安排，讓 Mark Simon 能夠安排郭明瀚的行程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示同日黎與 Mark Simon 之間的對話，提及打算先安排郭明瀚到達香港，然後再安排他前往台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上稱，他支付郭明瀚的旅程開支，但是沒有向他支付顧問費，因郭明瀚到台灣只是尋求機會協助台灣，如果談得成的話，他便會替台灣政府工作。但黎補充，對於台灣政府而言，聘請外國人替他們工作會不方便。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認是中間人或美國代理人&quot;&gt;黎否認是「中間人」或美國代理人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，從一連串的訊息可見，黎在2017年6至11月期間，反覆催促江春男安排蔡英文會見郭明瀚。黎同意，但他否認是一名「中間人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭遂追問黎認為「中間人」代表什麼意思。黎表示「中間人」意味台灣與美國之間的「中間人」，似乎將他說成是美國的代理人，但他否認是美國的代理人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方更新預計盤問時間-由15日增至25日&quot;&gt;控方更新預計盤問時間 由15日增至25日&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在早休之前，法官李運騰關注本案進度，現時控方盤問仍圍繞2017至2018年的事件，尚未開始進入控罪所涉時期，加上涉案的文章超過100篇，詢問控方早前聲稱需時15日盤問，是否一個現實的估算。李官並表示，正考慮是否去信另一宗案件的控辯雙方，通知他們延期開審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;再開庭的時候，控方表示經估算後，更新盤問所需時間為25日，可能直到3月中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指郭明瀚暫時沒有工作在身-催促江春男盡快安排會面&quot;&gt;黎指郭明瀚暫時沒有工作在身 催促江春男盡快安排會面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2017年11月1日的訊息，黎向江春男表示：「老實說在生意溝通上，我不習慣得不到答覆。請回覆我上述訊息，因為我們需時與另一邊安排。」江則為遲來的回覆道歉，稱他們感謝黎的提議，又指他們正在評估中美關係的最新形勢。江另表示，郭明瀚來訪對他們而言是很重要，乃認真對待接下來的會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎翌日回覆時，再度要求江安排會面，強調郭明瀚是非常高級和能夠提供好提議，邀請他到台灣及推銷其重建台灣外交渠道想法，目的是讓他在華盛頓替台灣政府服務。黎又提到郭明瀚暫時沒有工作在身，籲江盡快評估郭明瀚是否對台灣有用，否則對方可能接受其他的工作機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;蔡英文與郭明瀚會面黎在場-稱未有達成任何共識&quot;&gt;蔡英文與郭明瀚會面黎在場 稱未有達成任何共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，根據2018年3月12日的訊息，蔡英文與郭明瀚的會面最終定於同年3月15日。訊息亦顯示，Mark Simon 轉達蔡英文邀請黎一同參與會面。黎庭上同意，並稱他當時亦在場。被問到會面談了什麼，黎形容好像一場「應徵（interview）」，郭明瀚嘗試向蔡英文推銷自己想法及他在華盛頓可以怎樣協助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問會面上雙方有否達成任何共識。黎指蔡英文並未有作出任何決定，因她需要徵詢台灣外交部，因此會面沒有任何結論，也對於台灣重建外交渠道沒有任何實質想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2018年3月29日，黎向江春男傳送訊息：「我希望盡快面對華盛頓PR功能問題，因應利用 Jim Cunningham 的能力和關係，我恐怕 Jim 有了固定工作我們再難找到同樣好的人才協助。要不要我飛過來再說服陳菊市長？謝謝。」惟江未有回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎訊息稱特朗普政府是台灣與美國深入建交的最好時機&quot;&gt;黎訊息稱特朗普政府是「台灣與美國深入建交的最好時機」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2018年5月16日的訊息，黎向江春男表示：「我和 Paul and Jack 傾過一些他們的看法，他們認為現在的 Trump administration 是台灣與美國深入建交的最好時機，但台灣方面太顧忌大陸成為美國進一步進取的障礙，請我先跟你談談，讓他們七月尾來時更容易說服 The Lady（蔡英文）。」黎又提到 Jack Keane 與特朗普團隊關係密切，每星期都到白宮與他們見面兩次，知道有很多可以改變的可能性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否認為特朗普政府是「台灣與美國深入建交的最好時機」？黎則稱這是 Jack 和 Paul 的說法，而不是他自己的想法，他轉述二人的說法並不代表他同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，如果黎不同意說法，他會否轉述相關說法？黎表示：「會，為什麼不會？」控方指出，縱觀一連串訊息，黎從沒表達過不同意相關說法。黎同意，但強調他沒有說不同意，但不代表他同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官形容黎熱衷牽線美台雙方-黎只是嘗試協助台灣&quot;&gt;官形容黎熱衷牽線美台雙方 黎：只是嘗試協助台灣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又形容，黎表現似乎很熱衷於聯絡雙方。黎則回應：「我只是嘗試協助（台灣）。」控方追問，而且也協助美國？黎則強調，他是幫助台灣重建與在美國的外交渠道，屬於幫助台灣一方，而不代表他同時幫助美國。杜官追問，外交渠道牽涉到雙方，所以幫助台灣，其實也是幫助雙方？黎則否認，重申他只是利用郭明瀚的能力和人脈來幫助台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官再度提及，黎在訊息中問江能否叫時任外交部部長吳釗燮來吃飯及面談，黎看來對相關計劃非常熱心。黎則解釋，吳是比較謹慎的人，並稱自己只是想了解吳為何如此謹慎，因此面談僅關於情感方面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官則指，縱觀黎一連串行為關於重建台灣的外交渠道，似乎並不只是關於情感或態度。黎則解釋，若要了解雙方有否機會接近，便要知道雙方情感或態度。控方指出，黎安排會面的舉動不只關乎雙方情感，而是關乎台灣的外交政策。黎則重申，若要接近便要先知道雙方的情感。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since gaining independence, Ukraine has been engaged in a constant search for security guarantees. After the signing of the so-called Budapest Memorandum in 1994, there was a misplaced hope that by rejecting its nuclear arsenal, the country would receive protection. While some naivety was present in 1994, when none of the big states – including Russia – was seen as a potential threat, mistakes with long-term consequences were made – namely, accepting the term “assurances” and the non-legally-binding form of the memorandum. Moreover, there was an element of self-deception on the part of many in Ukraine, as the authentic translation in Russian and Ukrainian was titled “Memorandum on security guarantees”, despite the English version explicitly saying “Memorandum on security assurances”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events of 2014 and later 2022 clearly demonstrated the necessity of seeking concrete security partnerships and guarantees. Ukraine has always seen NATO membership as the best solution. However, in times of war, finding a proper framework is even more difficult than in times of peace. If NATO countries had not been ready to accept Ukrainian Euro-Atlantic integration when Russia was seen as a partner, since 2014, any request for NATO membership has been labelled as an attempt to escalate the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reacquiring nuclear weapons has never been a real option for Ukraine, a discussion has thus emerged on what other options Ukraine may have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political and expert debate regarding the need for bilateral security agreements or alliances started long ago, but these were always seen as a temporary or additional option rather than an alternative to NATO membership. Arrangements such as LITPOLUKRBRIG or the Lublin Triangle were a prototype for future initiatives, part of a proposed strategy of small alliances as temporary measures that would enhance security arrangements and allow better interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;September 2022 saw the publication of the Kyiv Security Compact, with recommendations prepared by the Office of the President of Ukraine together with international high-level experts. It presented a complicated framework of multilateral and bilateral agreements with key actors, supported by EU and NATO membership for Ukraine and the development of its own capabilities, but it lacked a real answer as to what the agreements should include except defence investments and training, NATO membership and unknown commitments from Ukraine’s partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it triggered negotiations with many partners regarding the possibility of concluding bilateral agreements. What started with the G7 Vilnius Declaration during the NATO Summit in 2023 has resulted in 28 agreements as of January 2025. All NATO member states except Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, North Macedonia, Slovakia, and Turkey have signed bilateral agreements, as have Japan and the EU. North Macedonia started negotiations in June 2024, Montenegro in August 2024, and Bulgaria in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going into negotiations, one of Ukraine’s main considerations was to avoid the mistakes of the Budapest Memorandum – from the exaggerated expectations to its inherent impotence. Still, the new agreements retain some of the same questions. As the agreements are not treaties, they do not require ratification by the respective countries’ parliaments. Many diplomats involved emphasised that this was done intentionally to speed up the process and to prevent opponents from blocking the signing. However, such a format implies high political risks, because in the end, it makes it easier for the next president or prime minister to cancel the agreement, or to insist that the document is not legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, they do not provide “guarantees” but “commitments”, which is connected with the question of the probability of the agreements’ realisation and the willingness to defend Ukraine in case of further military developments. The reason the agreements have not become multilateral is that each country was ready for a different extent of commitments. Some countries clearly indicated a financial package behind the agreement (such as the UK, Norway, Sweden, and Spain), while others emphasised capabilities pledges – for example, the UK has pledged support for maritime capabilities, Poland support for armoured capability, Japan support for IT, Lithuania support for demining capabilities, Spain support for air defence, and Romania aims to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation to enhance security in the Black Sea region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iXObfwq.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Russian President Boris Yeltsin, US President Bill Clinton, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and British Prime Minister John Major sign a treaty in Budapest, Hungary on 5 December 1994&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding future NATO membership, the wording of the agreements varies. Some agreements clearly indicated that NATO membership for Ukraine would make an effective contribution to peace and stability in Europe, and that the signatories would strengthen joint efforts to support Ukraine’s accession to NATO (the UK, Sweden, Spain, Norway, Lithuania). Others just stated that “Ukraine’s future is in NATO” (Slovenia) or gave a clear indication that NATO membership for Ukraine is in the strategic interest of both countries (Poland). Most of the agreements merely reaffirmed support for reforms aimed at realising Ukraine’s European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations, including towards EU and NATO membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the major additions to these agreements compared to the previous security arrangements is a significant focus on defence industry development and investment in Ukraine’s production. Partially, this is seen as a long-term investment in European security and capabilities, as the first year of the Russia–Ukraine war proved the unpreparedness of the European industrial complex for the scale and scope of wartime requirements, as well as a serious dependence on the US. The development of particular capabilities also clearly indicates a long-term investment in Ukraine’s defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine anticipated the bilateral agreements to be like the UK ones with Sweden and Finland before their full integration into NATO, but with long-terms plans and perspectives. Meanwhile, many partners considered bilateral agreements with Ukraine as a temporary substitute for full integration into the Alliance. However, the positioning of the bilateral agreements as supplements to NATO membership has been clearly articulated by the Ukrainian side, including in President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Victory Plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important part in each of the bilateral agreements is a chapter on “Cooperation / Consultations in the event of a future Russian armed attack”. In all cases, this means specifically an attack against Ukraine, as opposed to a NATO ally. The wording of this chapter is almost identical in each agreement and comprises three main points, which are quite vague:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At the request of either Participant, the Participants will consult bilaterally or through other mutually acceptable channels within 24 hours to determine appropriate next steps;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In those circumstances and acting within its means and capabilities, in accordance with its respective legal, constitutional requirements and with international and European Union’s rules and law, the country would provide Ukraine, as appropriate, with swift and sustained political, security, military, humanitarian and economic assistance;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to ensure the widest and most effective collective response to future armed attack, the Participants may amend these provisions so as to align them with any mechanism that they may subsequently agree with other international partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The positive aspect of these agreements is that, finally, Ukraine is no longer seen exclusively as a security recipient. The bilateral nature of the agreements is demonstrated not only in the signature line but also in the commitments that Ukraine reciprocally makes to help NATO member states. In most of the agreements, this is manifested in information exchange and training, joint defence production, and intelligence and counterintelligence cooperation, but some went further. The US–Ukraine agreement states that “Any future aggression or threat of aggression against the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of either Party would be a matter of grave concern to the other Party”. The Lithuania–Ukraine agreement has a separate chapter on Ukraine’s commitments, including: “The Parties will seek to ensure that Ukraine’s military capabilities are at such a level that, in the event of external military aggression against Lithuania, Ukraine is able to provide effective military assistance”. The Poland–Ukraine agreement focuses on pre-war preparations: “The Participants acknowledge that in the context of the current Russian war of aggression, Ukraine has gained significant experience and expertise that can contribute to the continued modernisation of the Polish Armed Forces.” Nevertheless, the predominant share of the commitments are those made by partners to help Ukraine. On reading the texts, one can have the impression that such an imbalance is not because of Ukraine’s unwillingness but because of the partners’ confidence that the real threat of aggression is not immediate and that their NATO umbrella is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it is questionable whether it is a positive or negative decision to include other areas aside from defence and military issues in the security agreements. The protection of critical infrastructure, information and cyber security long ago became parts of the hard security and NATO agenda. At the same time, combatting organised crime; illicit financing; sanctions; Russia’s accountability for acts of aggression and war crimes; fiscal, recovery and reconstruction support; humanitarian aid; anti-corruption; judiciary reform; and even cultural heritage might be better as topics for separate agreements so as not to diffuse attention from the main objective of the security agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year after the G7 Declaration, in July 2024, the Ukraine Compact was signed. The document was seen by its creators as a foundation for greater coordination among those that had signed and possible future bilateral agreements. It was stated that it is aimed at accelerating collective efforts to meet Ukraine’s comprehensive security needs, as outlined in the Joint Declaration and in the security agreements and arrangements each of the signatories has completed with Ukraine. The compact also de facto became an attempt to unite EU and NATO efforts in support of Ukraine’s defence. Still, it has a much softer formulation regarding future NATO membership than many of the bilateral agreements - “Compact Signatories plan to take these commitments forward while Ukraine pursues its pathway towards future membership in the EU, NATO, and the broader Euro-Atlantic community”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bilateral security agreements have raised a lot of questions. Will they secure military support for Ukraine even if the US stops providing it? Are they a substitute for NATO membership for Ukraine? Are they merely an upgraded version of the Budapest Memorandum with a big package of material support, or are they a legalisation of the military support Ukraine has been receiving? How much are they dependent on political will in the signatory states? Will these agreements help to win the war or prevent the next one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few questions in a long list. Some of them would be answered with the action plans that are expected for implementation. Some would be answered by the extent of implementation (defence industry investments, training, intelligence exchange and so on). A few points remain unknown. The issue of political will is especially problematic in times of war. Each signed bilateral agreement is a gentleman’s agreement that is entirely dependent on the goodwill of individual countries. Moreover, a complex of such agreements introduces an overlapping puzzle of security commitments without any concomitant guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;台灣《蘋果》逾兩年間向蔡英文助手支帳約20萬台幣 黎智英：得悉後要求立即停止&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/m24IxPN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，周五（17日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第120日審訊，黎智英第28日作供。控方盤問繼續圍繞黎在2017年安排退休美國將領 Jack Keane 和美國國防部前副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 赴台灣，與時任台灣總統蔡英文見面，事後 Mark Simon 透過訊息向黎報告有關帳目，包括二人顧問費、旅程開支及黎向 Jack Keane 貸款，合共匯款約1,490萬港元。另外，財務紀錄顯示從2017年11月至2020年2月之間，台灣《蘋果日報》每月向江春男支帳約20萬元台幣，合共涉款約580萬台幣（港幣約137萬元），而江當時已任職蔡英文的助手。黎確認相關紀錄，但他稱以為台蘋基於江撰寫社評而支帳，當他得悉江沒有再撰文卻仍收款時感到「震驚」，並要求員工立即停止支帳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認就退休美國將領和前美官員赴台存在合約&quot;&gt;黎否認就退休美國將領和前美官員赴台存在合約&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎繼續接受控方盤問。黎昨日供稱，在2017至2019年期間，曾安排退休美國將領 Jack Keane 和美國國防部前副部長 Paul Wolfowitz，與時任台灣總統蔡英文見面，因蔡希望知道美國特朗普政府的對台態度。三人於2017年8月首次會面，黎則不在場。黎亦承認向二人分別支付旅程費用和顧問費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及，上述赴台計劃的顧問合約是否獲得時任美國總統特朗普的支持，又問黎是否知道合約為期兩年。黎則堅稱不知道有合約的存在，直至現在庭上才知道。他稱沒有牽涉簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示2017年6月24日的訊息，Mark Simon 向黎報告，美國司法部有好消息，他們批准了 Jack Keane 和 Paul Wolfowitz 的「顧問合約方式（consulting contract approach）」。黎確認訊息內容，但他稱當時未有留意當中「合約」的字眼。控方質疑，黎當時回覆 Mark 稱「Wonderful!」；黎則稱「Wonderful!」的意思是形容相關「批准」，但他當時看漏了「合約」字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，黎有否簽署過相關合約？黎稱沒有，堅稱與 Jack Keane 和Paul Wolfowitz 之間沒有合約。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在法官杜麗冰的追問下，黎確認就 Jack Keane 和 Paul Wolfowitz 赴台有口頭上協議，但是不知道有沒有書面合約。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎堅稱二人僅在2017年之間赴台灣4次&quot;&gt;黎堅稱二人僅在2017年之間赴台灣4次&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2019年7月19日的訊息，Mark Simon 向黎提到，Jack Keane 和 Paul Wolfowitz 的合約為期2年，又指2017年4次，2018至2019年則4次。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到二人是否先後8次到訪台灣，黎則庭上堅稱，雖然他在訊息中同意2年合約，但是實際上只是為期1年，因第二年沒有繼續。他又堅稱根據自己的經驗，二人在2017年之間只來過台灣4次。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，黎有相關經驗是否因為他與二人同行赴台？黎同意，每當二人赴台，他都會與二人吃晚飯，所以他記得；若果二人在2018至2019年赴台，他必定會同行，然而他不知道二人有來過台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑會面乃關於利用台灣作為對抗中國的槓桿&quot;&gt;控方質疑會面乃關於利用台灣作為對抗中國的槓桿&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於二人與蔡英文的會面內容，黎強調他沒有參與會面，因此不知道他們會面中談論過什麼。控方質疑，會面是關於利用台灣作為對抗中國的槓桿；黎否認，堅稱這從來不是會面的目的，重申會面是讓台灣知道特朗普政府對台灣的態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，若然黎的說法真確，為何巧合地在會面之後不久，黎向蔡英文的助手江春男傳送訊息，當中提及台灣與美國簽訂能源合約，以及聘請美國退休將領協助推動台灣軍事現代化，並叫江轉達給「老闆」蔡英文。黎則堅稱訊息與台灣成為槓桿無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息提及安排二人到日本等地-黎堅稱只記得去過台灣&quot;&gt;訊息提及安排二人到日本等地 黎堅稱只記得去過台灣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎與 Mark Simon 之間的訊息，當中提到安排 Jack Keane 和 Paul Wolfowiz 到日本、新加坡和越南等盟友國家的話，會帶來更多好處，而黎回覆表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上稱記憶中二人只是去過台灣，不知道他們去過日本或其他地方，又指 Mark Simon 只是向他提議，雖然他回覆同意，但是不知道二人最終有否成行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問，跟據黎與二人的協議，顧問服務不只限於到台灣，而是可以去到日本或其他盟友國家？黎則堅稱這只是原本的提議，但是其後未有再被提出過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭另質疑，相比起黎的記憶，相關 WhatsApp 訊息紀錄可能是準確。黎指訊息可能準確，但是他記不起二人有去過訊息所述的地方，並強調：「我絕對沒有這些行程的記憶！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息顯示黎2018年向二人匯款-合共1490萬港元&quot;&gt;訊息顯示黎2018年向二人匯款 合共1,490萬港元&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官問及二人行程的財務安排，事前有否設定支出限額？黎則稱交給Mark Simon安排，而Mark 會自行作出決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示2018年7月19日的訊息，黎向Mark Simon 問及帳目，向加拿大的「特別項目」匯款是關於什麼。Mark 向黎報告指，是Jack 和 Paul 的項目，包括每人每年獲顧問費75萬美元（約580萬港元），另向 Jack Keane 支付25萬美元「贈金（gift payment）」（約195萬港元），合計為175萬美元（1,350萬港元），再連同旅程洗費等約140萬港元，合共為1,490萬港元。Mark 又提到，Jack 和 Paul 都厭惡交稅，因此才會經加拿大匯款給他們。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱曾向jack-keane借出貸款25萬美元&quot;&gt;黎稱曾向Jack Keane借出貸款25萬美元&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示2018年6月21日的訊息，Mark Simon向黎提及會向 Jack Keane 支付一筆25萬美元「贈金（gift payment）」連同歸還洗費。黎當時回覆Mark，指該筆錢並非「贈金」而是幫他繳清貸款。控方亦向黎展示他與 Jack Keane 之間的對話，對方表示被黎的慷慨感動到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎閱讀上述訊息之後表示，相信該筆款項並非「贈金」而是向對方借貸。因此黎確認除了顧問費之外，他與 Jack Keane 還有其他財務往來，但是只限該次貸款。他不肯定對方後來有否還款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另問及 Paul Wolfowitz，黎則稱沒有，相信 Paul 不會有任何貸款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;台灣蘋果管理層電郵透露黎吩咐每月支付蔡英文助手20萬元台幣&quot;&gt;台灣《蘋果》管理層電郵透露黎吩咐每月支付蔡英文助手20萬元台幣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及蔡英文「左右手」江春男，黎指江成為蔡的助手之前，曾替台灣《壹週刊》撰寫社評，其後黎邀請他轉到台灣《蘋果日報》撰寫社評。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示一封台灣《蘋果》管理層的電郵，日期為2020年3月25日，副本抄送時任《蘋果》財務總裁周達權。電郵提到，黎於2017年11月交代時任台灣壹傳媒主席葉一堅，由台蘋每月向江春男支付台幣209,606元（約4.96萬港元），以顧問費的名義出帳，與寫稿無關，並補充：「理由是：江先生對黎先生或台灣蘋果有某些用處（什麼用處只有黎先生自己知道）」；至2019年初，社長陳裕鑫「覺得已經付了一年多，江先生也沒有替我們寫稿或做什麼事情，就親自去問黎先生，此付款是否應該繼續下去，黎先生回答繼續付款。」陳裕鑫其後在節流（cost saving）會議上提出切斷此筆費用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上堅稱與同事溝通上有誤會，反稱他本來以為台蘋基於江春男撰寫社評而支付稿費，但是在江成為蔡英文助手之後，江沒有再撰寫社評，當他知道台蘋仍繼續支付江時，他要求立即停止支帳。控方引述電郵指黎自己知道原因，惟黎則強調不知道繼續支帳的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問，換言之，在江春男替蔡英文工作的時期裡，黎向江付錢？黎同意，但強調控方可以查看他的訊息紀錄，以了解他向員工說了什麼，又問辯方的律師團隊可否協助他。杜官則向黎解釋，若然辯方認為相關訊息紀錄有幫助的話，他們會在覆問階段提出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭提及電郵中指「黎先生回答繼續付款」，惟黎稱他不記得自己說過相關言論，所以他才會要求重看 WhatsApp 訊息紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示財務紀錄，指從2017年11月至2020年2月之間，台蘋每個月向江春男支帳約20萬元台幣，合共涉款約580萬台幣（港幣約137萬元）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，換言之，即是超過100萬元港幣？黎同意。李官問，所以在該段時期，黎向一名台灣政府人員支帳而明顯地沒有原因？黎同意，「所以當我知道時感到震驚。」控方向法官表示，將會在下星期一處理相關 WhatsApp 訊息紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英認自費安排前美官員及退休將領會見蔡英文 官質疑充當台美「中間人」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MbeMTTM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（16日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第119日審訊，黎智英第27日作供。辯方在早上完成主問，控方開始盤問黎。黎確認他在2017至2019年期間，曾安排退休美國將領基恩和美國國防部前副部長 Paul Wolfowitz，與時任台灣總統蔡英文見面，因蔡希望知道美國政府的對台態度。黎亦承認向二人分別支付旅程費用和顧問費。根據訊息紀錄，3人於2017年8月首次會面，黎則不在場。事前黎叮囑 Mark Simon 和蔡的助手江春男要保密。法官李素蘭一度質疑，黎安排基恩和 Wolfowitz 會見蔡英文，是美台之間的「中間人」。黎則否認，稱自己的身位並不適宜去作出協調，強調自己不是「中間人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎還柙後向蘋果同事及讀者傳話no-fear-we-have-to-fight-on&quot;&gt;黎還柙後向《蘋果》同事及讀者傳話：「No fear, we have to fight on.」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭繼續主問，他向黎提及，2020年12月1日，警方以欺詐罪名拘捕黎。黎於12月3日被帶往裁判法院應訊，被控欺詐罪，不獲准保釋，自此還柙。辯方續指，黎於12月11日再度被帶往裁判法院，被加控勾結外國勢力罪。至12月23日，黎在高院原訟庭獲批出擔保，須遵守一系列嚴格保釋條件。惟經律政司上訴之後，黎的擔保被終院上訴委員會撤回，須重新還柙。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，黎早前作供稱自己被還柙4年半，但實際上是大約4年1個月。黎同意。辯方又問到，在黎還柙之後，有否透過律師向《蘋果》員工和讀者傳話？黎則表示沒有相關記憶，只記得自己曾與律師交流一些事，但不記得是否與傳話有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂向黎展示2020年12月5日的《蘋果》頭版報導，其時黎還柙了2日。報導提及：「身陷牢獄的黎智英沒被嚇倒，他昨日透過親友及律師向《蘋果》同事及讀者說：『No fear, we have to fight on.』」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否傳達過「No fear, we have to fight on.」，黎指若然新聞如此報導的話，那他一定有傳達過相關說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎為何會使用「fight on」字眼。黎則指其意思是《蘋果》在被拘捕的風險和恐懼之下，仍然繼續營運，那麼便是「fight on」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英獄中傳話dont-be-afraid-庭上稱僅安慰&quot;&gt;黎智英獄中傳話：Don’t be afraid 庭上稱僅安慰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黎首度於2021年4月16日因未經批准集結罪（2019年8.18遊行和8.31遊行）而被判囚，其後分別於5月28日（2019年10.1遊行）、12月13日（2020年六四晚會）因未經批准集結罪被判囚。接著於2022年12月10日，黎在區院因欺詐罪而被判囚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，自黎於2020年12月3日，直至2021年6月《蘋果》開始停運，黎有否在《蘋果》的營運上擔當任何角色？黎表示沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2021年6月19日《蘋果》頭版〈警：涉串謀勾結外國勢力 張劍虹羅偉光今提堂〉。其中一個副標題為「黎智英獄中傳話：Don’t be afraid」，報導引述黎的妻子探監後，代黎向《蘋果》記者傳話：「我好為你哋驕傲，記者嘅歷史上唔會忘記你哋，你哋背住十字架上嘅痛苦，不過，don’t be afraid！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/m7rX3f9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上確認有說過上述言論，他指「十字架」代表苦難。被問到「don’t be afraid」的意思，黎說：「當你承受著苦難，你的心理狀態會不穩定，當你的心理狀態不穩定，你會感到害怕，我只是想安慰他們不要害怕。」辯方問黎是否籲員工鼓吹制裁？黎否認，反指他們需要非常小心和謹慎，他的言論重點是在心理狀態，籲員工不要冒險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，《蘋果》於2021年6月24日停運，問黎在停運上有否擔當任何角色。黎說沒有，又表示不記得自己有否辭職。他強調《蘋果》編輯委員會一直都獨立於他，只要他們決定營運下去，他們便會繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱獄中僅做自己事情-唯一與人類接觸的時候乃家人探訪&quot;&gt;黎稱獄中僅做自己事情 唯一與人類接觸的時候乃家人探訪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問及黎在獄中有否與任何人類接觸。黎表示大部份是他的家人，又提到妻子每日都探望他。辯方澄清問題是，除了探訪之外，黎在獄中有否與任何人類接觸。黎表示：「沒有，我只是做自己的事情，例如閱讀。」至於家人探訪是他唯一與人類接觸的時候。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;探訪頻率方面，在辯方提問下，黎確認從2020年12月3日還柙起，至2021年4月16日因未經批准集結罪而判囚之間，他屬還柙人士身份，因此每日都有人探訪他。然而2021年4月16日之後，轉為每個月4次探訪。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎在獄中期間，有否與其他人協議進行危害國家安全的活動。黎否認。辯方又問，黎本人在還柙後有否進行危害國家安全的活動。黎亦否認。辯方其後表示完成主問，籲黎留座接受控方盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;基恩的對華立場上為擴張主義者-黎否認支持其進取方式&quot;&gt;基恩的對華立場上為擴張主義者 黎否認支持其進取方式&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行開始盤問。法官李運騰對審訊時間表達關注，因他在5月初將要處理一宗「很長的審訊」。周向李官表示，估計盤問需時10至15日，期間會不斷向法庭更新進度。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 副刑事檢控專員 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方先問及黎與外國政界人物的聯繫，並向黎展示其政治人物聯繫圖表。黎重申他從沒透過圖表上列出的政治人物來影響外國對華及對港政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就美國退休軍官基恩（Jack Keane），控方提及黎早於2016年已認識他，並在2016至2020年期間有聯絡。黎同意並稱直至現在也有聯絡。控方又指黎曾在2016至2017年期間，分別於美國和台北親身會見基恩；此外，有時黎會透過其私人助手 Mark Simon 聯絡基恩。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dhced5L.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，特朗普在2017年上任美國總統時，曾打算委任基恩作為美國國防部長，惟基恩當時未有接受，轉而擔任特朗普的私人顧問。黎確認他在2017年1月時候對此知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，時任國防部長 James Norman Mattis 傳出有意辭職，而特朗普政府正在考慮委任基恩接替 Mattis 職位。傳媒報導指基恩在2003年退休，過往曾擔任美軍副參謀長，形容他不論在美國國會中、美國政府中及在特朗普眼中均受到廣泛尊重。黎表示對此知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎與 Mark Simon 之間的訊息，在2017年11月，Mark 當時正在安排基恩和 Paul Wolfowitz 到日本京都會見黎和蔡英文，並引述白宮中人指，基恩的對華立場上作為一名擴張主義者（expansionist），他的意見能夠獲 Mattis 和特朗普接受（has the ear of Mattis and the President）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到是否相信 Mark 對黎所說的東西，黎同意，又形容基恩對於中國和北韓的態度進取。控方指黎當時回覆 Mark：「很高興聽到基恩的進取方式」，追問黎是否支持這種進取的態度。黎則否認支持基恩的手法，強調只是說很高興聽到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意基恩與特朗普政府維持緊密的關係-惟不同意在政策上有很大影響力&quot;&gt;黎同意基恩與特朗普政府維持緊密的關係 惟不同意在政策上有很大影響力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指2020年3月，時任美國總統特朗普向基恩頒發自由勳章（The Medal of Freedom），當 Mark Simon 告知黎這消息時，黎回覆：「嘩，太棒了！我對於作為他的朋友感到驕傲。」黎在庭上表示，當時他認為基恩獲獎是一件很光榮的事，並以為獲獎是基於他與特朗普的關係。但在法官李運騰提問下，黎稱不知道獲獎準則是要對美國的國家利益作出重大貢獻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，基恩雖然在美國政府中沒有負責任何官方職位，但是他與特朗普政府維持緊密的關係，問黎是否同意。黎同意。控方又問，黎是否同意基恩對於美國外交和軍事政策上有很大影響力。黎則表示不這樣認為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意與美國國防部前部長paul-wolfowitz是親密朋友&quot;&gt;黎同意與美國國防部前部長Paul Wolfowitz是親密朋友&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就美國國防部前部長 Paul Wolfowitz，黎同意知悉其過往職位和外交經驗，亦確認其早前證供所稱，曾聘請 Paul Wolfowitz 擔任投資顧問，因黎打算在緬甸投資，所以黎在2016至2017年間與對方有密集聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示訊息紀錄，黎向 Paul Wolfowitz 說：「你的友誼對我意義重大」，而對方亦回覆黎：「你的友誼對我而言就是整個世界。」黎則稱不記得上述對話，但是同意對方的友誼必定意義重大。控方追問，所以二人是很親密的朋友？黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指二人在2016至2020年之間維持聯絡，黎同意。控方亦指黎在2016至17年間，曾分別在美國和台北等地與 Paul Wolfowitz 親身見面。黎同意，又指他與 Paul 見面次數比基恩較多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦同意他有時與基恩和 Paul Wolfowitz 會一同見面，因他是二人的共同朋友。控方問除了朋友見面之外，還有否其他目的。黎指沒有其他目的，只是一般的朋友社交聚會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎數次安排基恩和paul-wolfowitz與蔡英文見面-並支付旅程費用&quot;&gt;黎數次安排基恩和Paul Wolfowitz與蔡英文見面 並支付旅程費用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎確認他在2017至2019年期間，曾安排基恩和 Paul Wolfowitz 與時任台灣總統蔡英文見面，因蔡希望知道美國政府的對台態度和情感（sentiments）。黎亦承認他向二人支付旅程費用；至於顧問費，黎稱曾經 Mark Simon 向基恩支付顧問費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問及誰人介紹蔡英文給黎認識。黎指多年前他到台灣開始發展生意的時候，駐台美國總領事舉辦了歡迎派對，而他在該次派對中認識蔡英文。黎確認其後將基恩和 Paul Wolfowitz 介紹給蔡英文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JCs8jvn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 蔡英文&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問黎，為何要由黎支付二人赴台費用，而非台灣政府支付？黎則表示因為會面是由他安排的，又提到蔡不知道黎向基恩支付了費用。控方問相關會面是否黎主動提出。黎同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認向蔡英文左右手提倡美國使用台灣作為槓桿&quot;&gt;黎否認向蔡英文「左右手」提倡美國使用台灣作為槓桿&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方接著展示2016年12月12日的訊息紀錄。黎向蔡英文的「左右手」江春男傳送訊息：「我希望強調這是突破中國的時機，如果使用台灣作為中國、北韓和南中國海的好戰態度的槓桿，我肯定會形成很大壓力。」江春男同日替蔡英文問黎是否有空到她府上吃晚飯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上否認向江春男提倡美國使用台灣作為槓桿，反指這是美國的政策。控方指蔡邀請黎吃晚飯，目的是讓黎向台灣政府反映個人意見。黎否認，強調該次晚飯是蔡主動提出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎強調咨詢計劃須保密-控方質疑台灣作為槓桿-使計劃變得敏感&quot;&gt;黎強調咨詢計劃須保密 控方質疑台灣作為槓桿 使計劃變得敏感&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示訊息紀錄，黎於2017年1月5日向 Mark Simon 提及，基恩和 Paul Wolfowitz 將會赴台灣，以向蔡英文解釋特朗普政府對台態度，並叮囑 Mark Simon 要對計劃保密，一旦傳媒曝光便會破壞這個咨詢計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問黎，為何計劃要保密。黎估計是因為基恩和 Paul Wolfowitz 處於敏感的位置，他們雖然已退休，已不是政府官員或任何職位，而是以自由身來參與赴台計劃，但是依然需要事先向美國政府一方作出申請，以及得到批准。法官杜麗冰表示仍然不明白，法官李素蘭則追問為什麼有如此規定。黎最後僅指：「我估計這是美國的法律，你可以查一下。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，黎於同日亦向江春男傳送訊息，強調計劃是嚴格保密，以使計劃能有效地進行，不容傳媒知道。黎另提到翌日會與 John Bolton 見面，並為此準備了一份筆記，可以向江春男披露，但是叮囑江閱讀該筆記之後要銷毀它，不能給其他人看到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎，是否因為他有意令台灣成為對抗中國的槓桿，所以令基恩和 Paul Wolfowitz 赴台會見蔡英文的計劃如此敏感？黎否認，並指訊息紀錄已提及要保密的原因，直指控方：「你問了多餘的問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎的訊息另提到，基恩會讓特朗普知道這個獨立的咨詢計劃。控方問為何要讓特朗普知道。黎則指因為基恩將會向蔡英文提及美國政策，所以有需要讓特朗普知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑黎充當中間人協調美軍調往台灣-黎否認&quot;&gt;官質疑黎充當「中間人」協調美軍調往台灣 黎否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黎智英替 John Bolton 準備的筆記，控方問為何如此保密，要求江春男閱讀完便銷毀它。黎則稱不記得。黎另確認會面之時，John Bolton 還未成為美國的國家安全顧問，直至2018年才正式擔任。黎稱與 Bolton 是多年的好友，對方一直對台灣事務感興趣，會撰寫關於台灣的文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，黎亦提到他當時不希望蔡英文閱讀到該份筆記，因為他相信蔡英文對筆記所述內容會很謹慎。控方追問，既然黎不想蔡英文看到，為何又會傳送給作為蔡「左右手」的江春男？黎則稱，因為他與江經常就台灣交流想法和見解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎的筆記提到美國在台灣的軍事存在可以成為籌碼，用來制衡中國的好戰態度，確保兩岸和平。黎表示，他在筆記中主張美國將駐守日本的美軍，調配往台灣，又提到這想法在當時已出現在傳媒之中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰遂追問，既然有傳媒提及此想法，為何黎會認為該份筆記有保密性？黎指因為調動美軍到台灣的性質敏感，加上作為香港的一名中國人，他不認為自己有身位去提出相關主張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，黎在 Live Chat 節目中曾提及相關說法。李官接著問，在《國安法》生效之後，在 Live Chat 節目中談及相關說法，會否更加敏感？黎則指情況已有所不同，談論相關話題不一定觸犯法律，而且在2020年的時候，相關說法在媒體上已存在一段很長時間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到是否同意美國在台灣增加軍事存在（military presence）？黎表示同意要有，但不是增加軍事存在。法官李素蘭繼而質疑，黎安排基恩和 Paul Wolfowitz 到台灣會見蔡英文，目的是就美軍調配往台灣一事作出協調，是否就是咨詢計劃需要保密的原因？她又質疑黎是一名「中間人」。黎則否認，他稱筆記乃是提出個人見解（idea floating），惟他的身位並不適宜去作出協調，強調自己不是「中間人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指john-bolton文章與黎筆記相似&quot;&gt;控方指John Bolton文章與黎筆記相似&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在控方的提問下，黎確認他在2017年1月6日與 John Bolton 親身見面。在同年1月16日，Mark Simon 向黎傳送 John Bolton 撰寫的評論文章〈Revisit the ‘One-China Policy’, A closer U.S. military relationship with Taiwan would help counter Beijing’s belligerence.〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，John Bolton 的文章觀點，與黎交給他的筆記內容相似。黎同意相似，但是 John Bolton 的觀點更加細緻。控方追問黎是否同意相關觀點，因黎在筆記中宣揚相似觀點。黎則澄清他並非宣揚，而是整理相關觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9iV7byd.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ John Bolton（左）、Donald Trump（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問 Mark Simon 為何會傳送 Bolton 的評論文章給黎？黎相信因 Mark 認為他會對文章有興趣，但 Mark 並不知道筆記的事宜，所以黎認為不是因為筆記的緣故。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又指，Bolton 的文章標題使用「好戰（belligerence）」字眼，與黎的筆記字眼相同，問黎這是否巧合？黎則表示：「中國在南海的好戰態度，我認為是眾所皆知的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;咨詢會面後-黎向蔡英文左右手提及台灣軍事現代化&quot;&gt;咨詢會面後 黎向蔡英文「左右手」提及台灣軍事現代化&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示訊息紀錄，顯示會面最終訂於2017年8月16日進行，與會者包括基恩、Paul Wolfowitz 和蔡英文。會面3天之後，黎向江春男傳送一則訊息，提及台灣與美國簽訂十年合約，以確保台灣能源穩定；又提到台灣軍隊需要現代化，美軍將領可以提供知識，協助台灣推動軍事現代化。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上解釋，上述訊息並非關於蔡英文的會議內容，而是會議之後，黎與基恩和 Wolfowitz 食飯時談論的話題，他其後告知江春男。黎又確認，在食飯期間，他們發現台灣軍隊的知識落後於時代，因此黎在訊息中談及聘用退休軍官以協助台軍現代化，並希望江春男將相關訊息轉達給蔡英文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，黎於2017年8月向江春男傳送一張圖片，載有前美國駐港澳總領事郭明瀚（James Cunningham）的網上簡介。黎在庭上解釋，因台灣一方發現在華盛頓與美國交涉的說客不夠有效，所以江春男詢問黎有沒有適合協助的人選。而黎知道郭明瀚有外交經驗，故推薦他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎是否在協助台灣建立與美國之間的外交通道？黎否認，強調台灣一方在華盛頓已有人脈。控方又問是否「重建」外交通道？黎亦否認。控方追問，黎剛才又說協助台灣更有效率？黎則澄清，他的意思不是幫助台灣，而是介紹其他人去協助台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑黎目的讓基恩協助提升台灣軍事力量&quot;&gt;控方質疑黎目的讓基恩協助提升台灣軍事力量&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示黎與江春男之間的訊息，黎再度提及台灣與美國簽訂能源合約，以及聘請美國退休將領協助台灣軍事現代化。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑，黎訊息中提及的「退休將領」包括基恩。黎則不同意，又指「退休將領」意思是較低級的將領，而且是眾數，然而基恩屬四星將領，職級高很多。控方又指，黎安排蔡英文會見基恩和 Wolfowitz 的目的，是讓二人可以談論提升台灣軍事力量。黎則向控方說：「你可以這樣提議，但這不是真的。」當控方追問黎是否同意時，黎說：「當然不同意，你怎可以憑空捏造？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late November 2024, RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) hosted two workshops in Brussels, bringing together sanctions experts to discuss challenges around implementation. The workshops involved representatives from the UK and several EU member states from national authorities, including financial intelligence units, ministries of foreign affairs and other national competent authorities, with responsibility for sanctions policy and/or enforcement. Also in attendance were private sector representatives from a range of companies in the insurance, maritime, industrial, legal and consultancy sectors. Research institutes also participated, as did civil society groups with a focus on anti-corruption and financial integrity. These workshops are part of the engagements conducted by the CFS-led Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), supported by the National Endowment for Democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report relates to the first workshop, which focused on complex policy issues requiring collaboration within and across governments, and between the public and private sectors. A second report will summarise the discussions at the second workshop, covering the diplomatic and coercive measures available to gain greater cooperation to counter sanctions circumvention through third countries that have chosen not to adopt sanctions against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the discussions from either workshop are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strengthening-the-oil-price-cap-through-further-designations-and-insurance-enforcement&quot;&gt;Strengthening the Oil Price Cap Through Further Designations and Insurance Enforcement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first topic of discussion was the apparent failure of the oil price cap (OPC), which one participant called “dead”. This issue was said to be a strategic issue for the sanctions collaboration because the OPC was designed to limit funds flowing to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. One main factor participants said limits the efficacy of the OPC is that most Russian crude oil is transported on shadow fleet vessels. Private sector participants said that the public often blame private companies for complicity in trading oil with the shadow fleet, leading to a perception that the sanctions have failed. The fact that shadow-fleet vessels were visible from Northern European shorelines made the issue a “thorn in the eye of everyone”, according to one participant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has poured $10 billion into its shadow fleet which, at the time of the workshop, reportedly consisted of almost 600 vessels shipping 90% of Russian crude oil. These costs had so far paid off: Moscow had likely received an additional $14 billion in oil revenue between December 2022 and September 2024 due to sales above the OCP. However, according to participants from policy analysis and government sectors, this is not irreversible. One policy suggestion was enforcing insurance requirements for shadow-fleet vessels as the ships passed through national waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mechanism discussed was designating more Russian shadow-fleet vessels and their owners. This was supported by a wide spectrum of private sector participants. Currently, far fewer ships are formally sanctioned than have been identified or mentioned by media reporting on the shadow fleet. As a result, to bridge this gap, company representatives said they monitored news and conducted internal investigations, but this was time-consuming: one private sector representative said an investigation into a single vessel took two weeks. Such investigations also potentially go beyond companies’ duties to comply with the law, given that so few vessels have been sanctioned. One insurance company representative emphasised the value of sanctioning both vessels and ship-owning companies: “If you sanction or tell us someone is a bad operator, it is a great help, rather than running us as private detectives”. Adding as much information into the designation (not just IMO numbers but also other identifying information) would also enable banks and companies to identify the ships and cease trading with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from manufacturing companies also supported the suggestion to sanction more vessels and their owners, saying that this would cut off the ships’ access to a wider array of port services. It would also restrict their ability to obtain parts to maintain engines and other technology, making the vessels increasingly unusable. However, policy analysts noted that lawmakers were reluctant to designate hundreds of ships at once, given that it could cause a shock to oil and gas markets if it dramatically restricted Russian oil exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the shadow fleet were curtailed through sanctions on all shadow-fleet vessels, another obstacle discussed was that shipping companies from allied countries would still be reluctant to ship Russian oil, given perceived sanctions evasion – and reputational – risks. Private sector participants from across the maritime industry feared that they would be prosecuted if the oil they carried was traded above the OPC without their knowledge (as shipping and insurance companies may not know prices for commodities aboard their vessels, due to the falsification of attestation documentation). Participants from these companies said they needed to know “how much due diligence was enough” for them to feel able to accept these cargos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was agreed, therefore, that addressing the shadow fleet required not only many more sanctions on the vessels, but also clarification of regulators’ expectations for G7 shipping and insurance companies, so that they were incentivised to carry Russian oil at rates below the price cap, as originally envisaged. In other words, it is not enough to sanction the shadow fleet; alternative carriers must be encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cross-government-communication-and-cooperation-are-vital-to-enforcement&quot;&gt;Cross-Government Communication and Cooperation are Vital to Enforcement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several EU member states highlighted their increased cross-governmental cooperation, both on maritime issues and more widely. In relation to maritime sanctions, a Dutch government participant said that its customs and coastguard agencies convened a weekly meeting with the largest companies in its ports to discuss issues relating to Russia’s shadow fleet, as well as other issues. Their law enforcement bodies also exchanged information with supervisory authorities, speeding up asset freezes and other enforcement activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU member states were also working together, at least at the regional level, to align the interpretation of sanctions. One participant from Lithuania said Baltic states were working with Finland, Poland and Croatia to apply unified measures to sanctions compliance. Expanding this would be a priority of the Lithuanian government going forward, they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National authorities had not presented consistent or clear sanctions interpretations, according to one private sector representative. When asked, private sector participants said many national authorities refused to clarify or interpret rules that had been adopted in Brussels. There was therefore a frustration from the private sector that often, the only actionable guidance they received was in the form of the EU’s frequently asked questions (FAQs), although these were not legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant from another EU member state said the reach of sanctions had been delayed because “we are building sanctions in new areas where we need to build capacity and tools”. There was a balance, they said, between acting quickly and being prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One UK participant said they were working closely with the EU to “maximise the impact and effectiveness” of the sanctions in place. An EU member government participant said that cooperation on sanctions with the UK was an area where “geography speaks more than politics”, to such a degree that it was as if “Brexit has not happened”. But there was more to do, including continuing joint sanctions diplomacy efforts between the EU, the UK and the US. Some success had been achieved, they said, but this needed to be combined with other action, such as addressing Russian disinformation, hybrid warfare and other threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-private-sector-seeks-exchange-of-information-and-clarity-from-government&quot;&gt;The Private Sector Seeks Exchange of Information and Clarity from Government&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public and private sector representatives then discussed the successes and limitations of public–private partnership in sanctions implementation and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public sector participants were first asked what aspects of their cooperation with the private sector made them proud. Few EU member states’ representatives volunteered comments, but responses from Baltic states’ government officials were positive. One Latvian participant from a law enforcement agency said Latvia’s biggest success had been establishing a “one-stop shop” to address all questions from the private sector, with the aim of acting “as a consultancy to the private sector”. Other mechanisms for sharing information with the private sector included sharing evasion trends in meetings with the country’s largest banks and publishing a study showing indicators of typologies and evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other participants from the region set an equally positive tone, with one saying their government had set a key performance indicator (KPI) to provide clear advice in response to questions from the private sector: “They may not like it that we interpret sanctions conservatively, but our answer is always clear”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Latvian participant also noted that the Latvian government had published information on assets that had been deemed to be owned and/or controlled by sanctioned individuals, which provided clarity on its interpretation. Private sector participants from other countries said similar publications elsewhere would be welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One representative from Lithuania said the country had adopted similar information-exchange mechanisms, creating a platform to share information between government and private sector bodies. One representative from Lithuania said the government and major Lithuanian banks established the public-private partnership organisation. This organisation coordinates the work of the “tactical cooperation group” on topics such as sanctions, fraud, and anti-money laundering, in which both public authorities and financial institutions are active. The organisation also seeks to include discussions and information sharing from other sectors, such as railway and transport companies, which has been more challenging but remains important. However, bringing on board other sectors, such as railway and transport companies, had been more difficult, although it remained vital, given that the transportation of goods by road and rail via Lithuania to Russia and Belarus remained an important issue for sanctions enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants then discussed the importance of publishing information on sanctions enforcement, which supplies the private sector with information on government sanctions’ priorities and interpretations. One participant from the Netherlands said the country’s prosecutions were published thematically “so each sector gets a wake-up call”, and the government was trying to carry out enforcement in all sectors, including small and medium enterprises (SMEs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one participant from the legal sector said that while communication about enforcement had increased, enforcement notices in many member states remained too general. This was, they said, a missed opportunity, as examples of enforcement provide both “teaching and learning moments” and the best information on how governments were interpreting sanctions. Another participant from an industry body agreed, saying that court rulings and disclosures of prosecutions help to “set precedent and give clear answers on whether companies have complied with the sanctions”. In response to this, another participant from the legal sector reiterated the importance of receiving clear guidance from governments, as the courts were an expensive and inefficient way of obtaining guidance about what transactions were permitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one participant from an industry group noted there were limits to the amount of collaboration between the public and private sectors, particularly given the growing emphasis on enforcement in member states. One insurance company representative said companies need a “safe harbour”; companies that were “trying to do the right thing” should be able to be open with national authorities about their questions, without facing legal or regulatory repercussions. Participants recognised, however, that governments would not be able to provide a blanket assurance, even if cooperation increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;under-compliant-companies-and-bad-actors-leverage-differences-between-sanctions-interpretations&quot;&gt;Under-Compliant Companies and Bad Actors Leverage Differences Between Sanctions Interpretations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector participants noted that companies seeking to evade or circumvent sanctions, or those unwilling to implement compliance systems, continued to exploit differences between EU member states’ interpretations of EU sanctions. For example, a participant from one of the Baltic states noted that their country’s banks required all clients from high-risk industries to implement compliance controls. Although many responded by adopting these controls (which was an improvement), others relocated their operations to nearby countries with less restrictive interpretation. This highlights the potential vulnerability of enforcement occurring at the national level, and the need for intelligence-sharing and oversight across the EU (and more broadly among the G7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, one participant from a large corporate business in the maritime sector said the lack of compliance by SMEs was harming the maritime sector overall. They said larger companies with international shareholders were shouldering more of the burden to undertake due diligence and prevent sanctions circumvention, compared with SMEs. Because these smaller firms did not implement similar procedures, significant gaps in compliance remained. Other larger industrial companies agreed, emphasising that they had devoted significant resources to vetting suppliers and customers in light of recent sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants from national governments said they were considering how to harmonise EU compliance rules for high-risk sectors, saying that the need for harmonised supervision was a lesson from other financial crime areas, such as anti-money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, participants from all sectors said they appreciated the open and constructive conversation in the workshop, which highlighted the importance of providing platforms for discussion and cooperation. This need to iteratively discuss new sanctions legislation, implementation and enforcement measures has been a theme of RUSI’s SIFMANet country workshops and roundtables: sanctions policy is constantly evolving, and the dialogue too must remain ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were particularly positive about the engagement between the public and private sectors in support of the OPC (its implementation issues notwithstanding). EU and UK participants from the private sector said their comments and views had been heard in the design phase of the OPC. Following this workshop, we observed that the private and policy analysis sectors’ suggestions were also being considered: in mid-December 2024, 12 EU member states announced they would be boarding vessels to check their insurance documentation, and further sanctions on vessels were expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wider cooperation between the public and private sectors remains a challenge, but as CFS outlines in the recently published SIFMANet recommendations for 2025, further intelligence-sharing with the private sector is critical to improving compliance and enforcement. This should include intelligence gathered across the EU. The recommendations include setting up an EU intelligence hub cooperating with private sector entities across the region. Ultimately, the success of sanctions against Russia will rely heavily on effective collaboration, a goal that both public and private sectors should continue to develop domestically and across borders between different sanctions regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

This report seeks to spur new thinking on how Washington and Beijing can collaborate on discrete transnational issues in ways that serve both national and geopolitical self-interest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frictions between the United States and China are intensifying, yet even past geopolitical rivals found ways to collaborate on shared challenges where it squarely served national interests. In November 2022, the CSIS Freeman Chair in China Studies and the Brookings John L. Thornton China Center launched a project to explore safe and effective methods for collaboration among nonstate actors on key challenges facing both nations. The following brief distills takeaways from this work, which included historical case studies of collaboration during the Cold War, workshops with U.S. and PRC experts, and a track 2 dialogue on climate-smart agriculture designed to probe emerging findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-i-scoping-the-challenge&quot;&gt;Part I: Scoping the Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-China relationship dates to the nineteenth century, specifically to 1844, when the two countries signed their first diplomatic agreement, the Treaty of Wanghia, following the conclusion of the Opium Wars. In the nearly 200 years since, the bilateral relationship has oscillated between periods of intense engagement and estrangement. There have been times when both countries shared common adversaries and common pursuits, as well as other moments when the relationship was defined by enmity and even direct conflict, such as in the case of the Korean War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present period is one of intensifying rivalry, with neither country content with the status quo. Both the United States and China are engaged in a sprawling competition that spans military, economic, technological, diplomatic, and ideational realms, including global governance. Currently, Washington and Beijing do not have any broadly shared purpose that could help the relationship weather shocks and generate resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intensification of the U.S.-China rivalry is occurring against the backdrop of the eroding efficacy of the post–World War II international order. Wars in Europe and the Middle East, declining support for economic globalization, rising nationalism and populism, and a confluence of food, energy, and environmental shocks are all stressing the current rules-based international order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the United States and China are the world’s two most capable countries, neither is in a mood to pool resources with the other or to galvanize global efforts to address transnational challenges. Instead, the United States increasingly has been strengthening its coordination with fellow advanced democracies, largely, though not exclusively, through the G7 grouping. Meanwhile, China has been bolstering its investment into the BRICS+ grouping as a counterweight to the G7, in addition to attempting to burnish its credentials as a leader of the developing world. At home, Beijing has been prioritizing a strategy of authoritarian resilience, combining more state direction in the economy with greater political control of society and increased investments in domestic and external security. The net effect of both countries’ actions has been a widening of the gap between them in recent years, a trend that is almost certain to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arc of U.S. disillusionment with China can be seen through the evolution in how China has been described in the national security strategies of the past three U.S. presidential administrations. In the 2015 National Security Strategy, the Obama White House observed, “The scope of our cooperation with China is unprecedented, even as we remain alert to China’s military modernization and reject any role for intimidation in resolving territorial disputes . . . The United States welcomes the rise of a stable, peaceful, and prosperous China.” By 2017, the Trump White House cautioned, “China and Russia challenge American power, influence, and interests, [and are] attempting to erode American security and prosperity.” In 2022, the Biden White House declared, “The People’s Republic of China harbors the intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit, even as the United States remains committed to managing the competition between our countries responsibly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sense of disillusionment is shared by the U.S. public, with public perception of China having become increasingly negative over the past eight years. In May 2024, 81 percent of Americans viewed China unfavorably, marking the highest figure since the Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, 1989. This trend of darkening public views of China is matched in a range of other countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As U.S.-China rivalry has sharpened, the United States’ interest in coordinating with China on shared challenges has diminished. Some analysts see pursuing coordination with China as a trap. According to this logic, any such pursuit with China transfers leverage in the relationship to Beijing, given Beijing’s tendency to try to use the United States’ interest in Chinese contributions to get Washington to back off in its competitive posture in other areas. Other U.S. officials and experts worry that greater U.S.-China cooperation on shared challenges could dampen U.S. tolerance for friction with China. In this sense, they worry that U.S.-China cooperation could cause Washington to pull back from competitive actions meant to counter Chinese ambitions that challenge U.S. interests, for example regarding Taiwan or export controls for dual-use technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appears to be a mirroring dynamic in Beijing. Though generally more reactive than proactive with regard to opportunities for coordination with the United States, Beijing has become even more volatile in recent years. There is little, if any, recent evidence of Beijing proposing any joint U.S.-China initiatives to tackle common challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With neither side placing much trust in the other’s commitments or in their words, support in both capitals for a policy of dialogue by facts is emerging. Thus, much as was the case at the start of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union in the late 1940s, the notion that strength is the only language that either side understands predominates. At best, diplomatic engagement can provide buffering; it cannot ameliorate sources of friction or open space for bilateral coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the darkening atmosphere of the overall relationship, other practical impediments have emerged in recent years to limit U.S.-China coordination on shared challenges. Nationalist fervors in both countries have contributed to the further politicization of U.S.-China relations, thus shrinking the political space needed to explore cooperative efforts. In such an environment, there is incentive for leaders to demonstrate toughness and resolve and a disincentive for any actions toward the other that could be perceived as weak or soft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, U.S. leaders have become more cautious about bestowing protocol pomp to Chinese leaders and have even been requesting that Chinese leaders commit to substantive actions that align with U.S. interests in exchange for such spectacle. In the current environment, for example, it is hard to imagine a U.S. leader hosting their Chinese counterpart for a state visit. This cautiousness reduces opportunities for U.S. leaders to trade form for substance, as has been done in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020 and again in 2023, President Biden publicly labeled President Xi as a “dictator” and a “thug.” Chinese interlocutors responded by arguing that Biden’s comments violated China’s political culture, which expects public respect for China’s top leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At points in the past, former officials and experts from both countries have used (unofficial) track 2 dialogues to incubate and test ideas before they are deliberated in official channels. However, even in these unofficial and lower-stakes settings, roadblocks to cooperation have arisen in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Track 2 participants from both countries are increasingly cautious about traveling to each other’s countries. Many Chinese former officials and experts report being wary of entering the United States for fear of being stopped at the border by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and being interrogated about their links to the Chinese government. Similarly, many U.S. former officials and experts have grown less enthusiastic about traveling to China out of concern for their physical safety following the extrajudicial detention of two Canadian citizens from 2018 to 2021, as well as cases of U.S. citizens being barred from departing China. This mutual wariness has colored various track 2 interactions and has caused many meetings to be held virtually or in a third country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partially due to restrictions on travel during the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the more limited channels for official and unofficial interaction already discussed, there is overall less depth to the personal relationships between U.S. and Chinese counterparts relative to the pre-2017 era. There are exceptions. Former U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators Robert Lighthizer and Liu He spent considerable time together, for example, during negotiations about the “Phase One” trade deal that was signed in January 2020. In some respects, Lighthizer and Liu’s relationship is the exception that proves the rule. Over the past 45 years, every major issue that was negotiated effectively between both sides was conducted by empowered officials who took time to develop personal relations, that is, to understand each other’s backgrounds, motivations, and political constraints. However, as of 2025, there are fewer relationships that meet this criterion at the official or track 2 level than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Chinese track 2 meeting participants also report a diminished demand signal from both governments to explore new ideas for addressing challenges or unlocking cooperation. Particularly in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), without official interest in new thinking on issues in the relationship, individuals face professional risk in generating new ideas that could be perceived as deviating from the Chinese Communist Party’s line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese experts and former officials report that, partially because of the potential risk, they are refocusing more of their time and attention to track 2 dialogues with counterparts from other countries where Beijing perceives there is more room for progress in advancing relations. As Beijing prioritizes strengthening relations with countries from the Global South and the BRICS+ grouping, many Chinese former officials and experts are shifting their attention to align with government efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, Beijing remains focused on its relationship with the United States and views the United States as the only country capable of obstructing China in reaching its national ambitions. Although Beijing increasingly approaches the relationship from a defensive and competitive perspective, it does so with lessening expectations that there will be opportunities to advance bilateral relations. This posture is informed partly by Beijing’s analysis that the core source of stress in the U.S.-China relationship is shifting power dynamics, specifically, that the United States seeks to prevent China’s rise and instead aims to preserve the United States’ privileged place as the world’s leading power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These barriers to cooperation are not new to major power relationships, and many of them will be long-lasting. As such, waiting for the U.S.-China relationship to return to a less fraught moment is not a strategy. If either side aspires to credibly address mounting transnational challenges such as food security, public health, and climate change effectively, they must rethink their approach. Without finding ways to break down barriers to coordination, or at least to combine efforts in discrete areas, the result will be diseases that will not be cured, environmental catastrophes that will worsen, increased stress on food systems, greater migrations of peoples, and, ultimately, a higher likelihood of conflicts around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this report focuses on practical ideas for unlocking mutually self-interested U.S.-China coordination on shared challenges. The recommendations that follow are not developed in service of smoother bilateral relations. Instead, they are guided by hard-nosed U.S. interests in delivering a world that is more just, safe, prosperous, and healthy for U.S. citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-ii-key-takeaways-from-case-studies-and-track-2-dialogue&quot;&gt;Part II: Key Takeaways from Case Studies and Track 2 Dialogue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2022, CSIS and Brookings launched a joint project to explore the conditions and mechanisms under which U.S.-China collaboration, particularly among nonstate actors, could be made safer and more effective in an era of strategic competition. Our premise was captured by Steve Davis, chair of the project’s advisory council: “game-changing opportunities for social impact across health, climate change, and food security are within reach, but [they] will depend on new mechanisms and narratives that enable collaborations between partners in the United States and China to proceed in smart, informed, and geopolitically sensitive ways.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work in phase one of the project aimed to identify viable mechanisms for this kind of collaboration. We looked first to the past, commissioning a set of case studies exploring how past geopolitical rivals coordinated on shared challenges. In our first case study, seasoned journalist and U.S. global health policy expert Nellie Bristol explored how the United States and the Soviet Union found the political space to work together on smallpox eradication amid the Cold War. Preeminent Cold War historian Mel Leffler examined how Washington and Moscow managed to cooperate in strategic arms control and other areas, including global health, at the height of U.S.-USSR hostilities. Jennifer Bouey, Tang Chair for China Policy Studies at the RAND Corporation and associate professor in Global Health at Georgetown University, explored U.S.-China cooperation on HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation in the early 2000s. Finally, Gayle Smith, former CEO of the ONE Campaign and former administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), detailed how Washington and Beijing came together to address the spread of Ebola in West Africa in the mid-2010s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each study laid out the conditions under which either U.S. policymakers or nonstate actors (such as scientists, doctors, and foundations) found the political space to work together on shared challenges amid intense rivalry, as well as the precise mechanisms of their successful cooperation. We then conducted a “live” case study of U.S.-China collaboration in the form of a track 2 dialogue on climate-smart agriculture, which we held in Bellagio, Italy, in March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice to focus on climate-smart agriculture followed a simple logic. In recent years, leaders in both the United States and China have publicly expressed interest in bilateral cooperation in this area. That said, cooperation in this space is not straightforward. Chinese investments in U.S. agricultural land have come under increased congressional scrutiny, and Beijing is determined to reduce dependence on agricultural imports from the United States for its own food supply. Climate-smart agriculture cooperation was thus a sufficiently challenging topic to test our emerging conclusions about mechanisms for collaboration amid strategic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in the track 2 discussions included former policymakers from the National Security Council, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Council of Economic Advisors, the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and State, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; former leadership of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition; and researchers from numerous U.S. and Chinese think tanks, universities, and private firms. The dialogue served as a marquee initiative in its own right, driving functional collaboration in an area of global importance. More importantly for our broader project, it allowed us to test emerging hypotheses about how to optimize collaboration during periods of strategic rivalry. Based on the conference, the historical case studies, and additional workshops with experts and practitioners from both the PRC and the United States, we came away with the following observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-1-the-broader-political-environment-meaningfully-shapes-the-aperture-for-collaboration-among-nonstate-actors&quot;&gt;Observation 1: The broader political environment meaningfully shapes the aperture for collaboration among nonstate actors.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Bouey’s case study on U.S.-China HIV/AIDS collaboration in the early 2000s details how the then-prevailing U.S. policy of strategic engagement toward China laid the groundwork for coordination on global challenges, including HIV/AIDS, as a way to advance U.S. soft power and to bring China into the international system. The engagement of senior officials on both sides, including China’s minister of health and the U.S. health and human services secretary, proved vital in establishing memoranda of understanding that set the tone for cooperation among doctors, research institutions, and nongovernmental organizations. Gayle Smith recalls then-U.S. president Barack Obama directing his staff to enlist tangible support from the entire international community, including China, amid the 2014 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. The president put substantial personal energy into outreach to other heads of state. Mel Leffler, in his overview of U.S.-Soviet relations from the 1950s to the 1980s, likewise argues that leader-level decisions in both Washington and Moscow paved the way for cooperation in discrete areas during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-2-in-times-of-geopolitical-tension-nonstate-actors-will-find-collaborative-efforts-safest-and-most-effective-in-areas-where-a-compelling-national-interest-case-can-be-made-for-cooperation-in-both-capitals&quot;&gt;Observation 2: In times of geopolitical tension, nonstate actors will find collaborative efforts safest and most effective in areas where a compelling national interest case can be made for cooperation in both capitals.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case studies emphasized that past collaboration between rivals did not emanate from altruistic ideals, but rather from calculations of domestic and geopolitical self-interest. Smallpox eradication, for example, served both Washington’s and Moscow’s interests in eliminating imported smallpox cases—the Soviet Union had been regularly importing cases from neighboring India and Pakistan, while the United States had been spending hefty sums on a vaccine with sometimes severe adverse side effects. Moreover, being a prominent and meaningful player in global smallpox eradication promised tangible geopolitical benefits to each superpower, enabling the United States to counter reputational damages from the Vietnam War and the Soviet Union to showcase its disease control success as evidence of broader scientific and medical prowess. Leffler similarly demonstrates that throughout the Cold War, U.S. presidents sought cooperation with the Soviet Union through formal and informal arrangements where it suited the United States’ self-interest. These efforts ranged from avoiding kinetic war and delaying China’s nuclear ambitions to sustaining a divided (and weak) post-war Germany, as well as deterring the wider spread of nuclear weapons in an increasingly multipolar world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier examples of U.S.-China coordination also directly serviced national priorities in both Washington and Beijing. The SARS epidemic highlighted glaring gaps in China’s public health system, Bouey shows, making Beijing more open to partnering with U.S. public and private bodies in the realm of biomedical research and public health capacity building. In turn, organizations from the United States and elsewhere invested significant sums toward scientific research on infectious disease responses, leading to a dramatic expansion of treatment coverage within China. This was not without benefits to the United States. Bouey’s research reveals how U.S. doctors and professionals persuaded Chinese officials to reach out to stigmatized communities like LGBTQ people and sex workers to provide services, thus advancing U.S. values, including universal human rights. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gained access to large amounts of research data that U.S. researchers otherwise would have struggled to obtain in the United States, propelling U.S. HIV research to new heights. Similarly, Gayle Smith shows that the Obama administration sought to engage China on the global Ebola response in 2014 not as a feature of U.S. China policy, but rather to showcase U.S. global leadership by effectively and quickly bringing the epidemic to an end, recognizing that this goal would require Chinese resources and assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each example, U.S. proclivity toward collaboration was grounded in domestic and geopolitical imperatives. This holds lessons for collaborative enterprises today. Nonstate actors seeking to safely and effectively work with their counterparts in the United States and China in a more contentious environment should seek to concretely articulate the national interest case for their efforts to policymakers. During the project’s track 2 dialogue in Bellagio, we challenged the assembled experts to keep the domestic priorities of Washington and Beijing top of mind when exploring potential areas for joint efforts in climate-smart agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the convening discussions landed on fields where the national interest case for cooperation could easily be made in both Washington and Beijing, including promoting sustainable agricultural production in water-stressed agricultural regions, a key necessity for both countries; reducing food loss and waste, an area where both the United States and China have recently announced domestic goals; developing mutually agreed-upon standards of measurement for the climate impacts of agriculture, where cooperation between U.S. and Chinese technical experts could result in formalized, evidence-based standards to which both countries agree; and accelerating investments in alternative proteins for animal feed and human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;observation-3-new-approaches-are-needed-for-track-2-convenings-in-an-age-of-strategic-competition&quot;&gt;Observation 3: New approaches are needed for track 2 convenings in an age of strategic competition.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our workshops, both Chinese and U.S. experts emphasized the utility of multiday gatherings that allow for more collegial and relaxed interactions. This was backed up by the case studies. Nellie Bristol, for example, highlighted how the World Health Organization (WHO) provided a platform for the day-to-day, informal interactions among an international corps of health professionals that allowed them to build rapport and work toward a common goal relatively uninhibited by macropolitical forces. In Bellagio, we put this idea to the test. Our meeting was four days, longer than the typical one-to-two-day track 2 meeting. The agenda included smaller group work and opportunities for walks and exploration of the nearby town, setting a collegial tone that enabled more relaxed conversations about the topics at hand. The inclusion of social activities in the agenda deepened personal connections among the group, as did the fact that it was a multiday event, giving space and time for repeated interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, many of our participants knew each other from past gatherings and thus were already familiar with one another, pointing to the utility of repeated gatherings when discussing complex issues and topics. Some U.S. and Chinese participants had overlapped during shared postings at the UN Food and Agricultural Organization or other multilateral institutions. Others knew each other from think tank and university exchanges. These personal connections proved valuable in grounding the dialogue in shared experiences and developing a sense of shared motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexibility was also key to the convening’s productivity. At multiple turns, we jettisoned the agenda to capitalize on organic momentum—particularly on days three and four—in the conversation between U.S. and Chinese counterparts. For example, although we had pre-identified three areas for discussion prior to the convening—U.S.-China collaboration on food security in third countries, the boundaries of agricultural technology sharing, and coordination to raise international standards on food safety and quality—flexibly encouraging participants to bring in ideas outside of these areas led to a more concrete and compelling set of conversations and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found that location can matter, but in nuanced ways. We held the 2024 convening in Bellagio, Italy, in part to test the notion that “neutral” locations are preferable to gatherings in the United States or China as frictions rise and travel—with its associated fears of personal security—becomes more complicated in both directions. Our findings on this front were somewhat inconclusive. Most of the U.S. and Chinese counterparts with whom we spoke agreed that “neutral” locations such as Singapore and Italy can facilitate more open conversations but come with their own hurdles. Some (such as Singapore) are far closer geographically to one country, while others (such as Italy) require visas for Chinese visitors but not for Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-iii-concrete-recommendations-for-advancing-collaboration-in-an-era-of-strategic-competition&quot;&gt;Part III: Concrete Recommendations for Advancing Collaboration in an Era of Strategic Competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calls for greater U.S.-China collaboration on shared challenges are commonplace, but few reports have examined the precise mechanisms or best practices by which bilateral coordination might proceed in this new geopolitical reality of sustained great power competition. Waiting for a return of relations to a less competitive era is not a strategy. A new approach for unlocking mutually self-interested coordination on shared challenges is urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cumulative experiences and lessons from the first phase of this project suggest that the following elements could support efforts to secure greater U.S.-China coordination on shared challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-1-normalize-the-concept-of-coordination-amid-competition&quot;&gt;Recommendation 1: Normalize the concept of coordination amid competition.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-China coordination on shared challenges does not preclude either side from taking competitive actions deemed necessary to protect national security or long-term national competitiveness. Such coordination also is not in service of any kumbaya-like efforts to close divisions between both countries on vital interests. Coordination on specific, concrete, shared challenges is simply an act of mutual self-interest meant to improve the security, prosperity, and health of each country’s peoples. It is an effort to leverage the capabilities and resources of the other to lessen the burden on oneself for addressing specific challenges, and, ideally, for accelerating progress toward curing diseases, protecting the environment, and feeding undernourished populations. As global leaders, the United States and China share responsibility to steward solutions to challenges that transcend borders, even as they compete vigorously with each other over philosophical disagreements in some areas and conflicts of interest in others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-2-set-priorities-secure-high-level-buy-in-and-use-summits-as-action-forcing-events&quot;&gt;Recommendation 2: Set priorities, secure high-level buy-in, and use summits as action-forcing events.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current political environment in both countries, U.S.-China coordination on transnational issues is viewed with skepticism, if not outright hostility. However, there is momentum in both countries toward communicating through a dialogue of facts due to the lack of faith both sides place in verbal commitments and understandings from the other side. In such circumstances, bilateral coordination is unlikely to organically develop from the bottom up. More likely, such efforts will require political leaders in both capitals to open space for coordination by instructing their governments to work together to address specific shared challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, both leaders will need to set priorities and be persistent in driving progress on them. These priorities will carry greater weight if they are embraced in the United States on a bipartisan basis so that they can be seen as enduring rather than transitory. A good example of this pattern was the case of U.S.-China coordination to curb the flow of fentanyl precursors from 2023 to 2024. A bipartisan congressional delegation led by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer appealed directly to President Xi to prioritize curbing the flow of fentanyl precursors during a visit to Beijing in October 2023. The forcefulness of this bipartisan presentation helped lay the groundwork for President Biden and President Xi to agree to enhance U.S.-China law enforcement cooperation one month later during a meeting on the margins of the 2023 APEC Leader’s Summit in San Francisco. When the two leaders met one year later, on the margins of the 2024 APEC Leader’s Summit in Lima, Peru, they jointly reviewed the progress and problems with U.S.-China law enforcement cooperation. Over this period of cooperation, there was a reduction in fentanyl overdose deaths in the United States. While the outcome is far from perfect, this process has saved U.S. lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson from this brief case study is that progress is possible when it is prioritized by both leaders and when they both use summit-level engagements as action-forcing events to drive progress within their respective bureaucracies. Leaders measure each other by the credibility of their commitments. No world leader wants to be perceived as failing to deliver on pledges. Both countries should use these dynamics to unlock self-interested coordination on challenges that affect the health, safety, and prosperity of their citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-3-identify-venues-for-coordination&quot;&gt;Recommendation 3: Identify venues for coordination.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some specific bilateral challenges, there is opportunity for bilateral coordination to resolve problems, such as in the case of the flows of fentanyl and its precursor from China via Mexico into the United States. On most other transnational challenges, however, Washington and Beijing will need to be creative in identifying venues for coordination. The reason is simple. Washington generally is reluctant to endorse or support Chinese-led initiatives, just as Beijing is loath to endorse or support U.S.-led transnational initiatives. Both countries want to be captains of their own endeavors, not underwriters or contributors to the other’s programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This places a premium on finding mutually acceptable platforms to support and with which to engage. In some instances, this could be through UN-led efforts, such as in the past case of joint contributions to building UN peacekeeping capacity. In other instances, cooperation could take the form of parallel contributions to transnational efforts to address challenges. For example, Washington and Beijing both engaged in blamesmanship over the origins of Covid-19, thereby poisoning any attempts to pool resources to accelerate the discovery of a Covid-19 vaccine. In lieu of pooling capabilities for responding to the Covid-19 pandemic, however, both the United States and China contributed substantially to the Gavi vaccine alliance. Neither country was able to work with the other, but both were able to support a neutral third party in solving problems that were plaguing peoples in both countries and around the world. Looking forward, both countries will need to exercise flexibility and adaptability to find mutually acceptable venues to address transnational challenges, such as future pandemics, that require the contributions of the world’s two most capable financial and scientific powers to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-4-use-track-2-dialogues-to-identify-opportunities-and-solutions-to-obstacles&quot;&gt;Recommendation 4: Use track 2 dialogues to identify opportunities and solutions to obstacles.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-China government-to-government dialogues inform both countries on the other side’s official positions on issues. They rarely delve deeply into “why” questions around factors informing those policy positions, that is, how each side evaluates risks and opportunities around emerging challenges or how each side judges trends and potential developments on the international landscape. Used effectively, track 2 (unofficial) dialogues between experts, scholars, and former policymakers from both countries can help fill in gaps in understanding. Track 2 dialogues can also provide a valuable supplement to official dialogues. Unofficial exchanges can spot potential risks on the horizon, help set expectations around how each side will respond to issues, and creatively explore ideas for navigating around obstacles to self-interested coordination in ways that officials may feel more constrained from doing given their government roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be used effectively, track 2 dialogues must be connected to discussions taking place in official channels. Both sides need to have confidence that their track 2 dialogue counterparts are privately feeding knowledge gained from the dialogues into policy discussions in both capitals and not just treating such dialogues as salons for admiring problems with counterparts from the other side. Foreknowledge that both sides in a track 2 dialogue are connected to their respective governments gives purpose and focus to these types of unofficial convenings. Discretion also often is a key ingredient in fostering an environment conducive to productive exchanges in track 2 settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, to be effective, both sides in a track 2 dialogue should be engaged collaboratively in agenda design. There should be mutual understanding in advance of the dialogue on key questions, concerns, or issues the dialogue is being used to address. There also should be ample time allotted during the dialogues for informal exchanges among participants, for example over meals, during coffee breaks, or in the form of structured activities such as paired walks or site visits. Breakthroughs at track 2 dialogues often occur in these informal interactions and not necessarily at the table as part of formal exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting moderation is also crucial to the success of any track 2 convening. If the gathering is intended to focus on public health, for example, then moderators should be alert to cut off any participants who use their allotted speaking time to engage in ad hominin attacks on the other’s leading national figures or to focus on issues unrelated to public health. Ideally, participants will be selected based on their expertise, their personal rapport with experts from the other side, their discretion, and their capability to concentrate their comments on the subject at hand without diverting discussion to unrelated topics that could derail progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, care must be given to interpretation, literally. If the entire dialogue is conducted in either English or Chinese, it can skew the nature of discussion toward one side’s priorities and concerns. When translation is used, it should be simultaneous interpretation or whisper interpretation in order to preserve flow of discussion and avoid chopping dialogue into set-piece interventions and presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting venue is another important consideration in track 2 dialogue design. Until greater mutual confidence that track 2 participants can travel safely and without impediment to each other’s countries for dialogues is established, many track 2 convenings will need to be held in neutral third countries. Issues for consideration when designing U.S.-China track 2 dialogues in third countries include geographic accessibility to both countries, visa requirements for U.S. and Chinese participants, and ease of transportation and communication for participants within third countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, there are no silver bullets to dispel deep mutual misgivings between Washington and Beijing. The United States and China are well into an era of strategic competition that is unlikely to end soon, given both sides’ unwillingness to yield to the other on the terms of global and regional leadership in the coming century. Unless bold, creative, new thinking emerges to spur innovation, collaboration, and coordinated actions between the world’s two most capable powers, transnational challenges such as pandemics, food insecurity, and environmental degradation will fester, leaving the world worse off. This report seeks to spur new thinking and debate on how the United States and China can align efforts, not out of amity or high-minded appeals for improvements to relations, but rather out of clear-eyed self-interest. Previous great power rivals found ways to coordinate on shared transnational challenges even amid intense geopolitical rivalry. The United States and China should as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fall of the Assad regime in Syria has led to speculation over the implications for Russia and particularly the long-term fate of its military footprint in the country. The Russian naval base at Tartus has been a particular focus due to its strategic significance in affording access to the Mediterranean. It is a key hub for accessing Libya and the Red Sea and providing logistical support to Russian – specifically Africa Corps – activity in Sudan and West Africa. What are the options for Moscow in the event that its apparent understanding with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) regarding the Russian presence at Tartus proves transient?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial Western hopes that Russia would immediately lose its access appear to have been unfounded. Putting the fleet to sea to avoid the possibility of being seized or denied future freedom to depart was, however, a sound military precaution. Its subsequent return indicates that the status quo has some stability. The Kremlin effectively acknowledged that avoiding loss of access was, and is, a priority. Russia was quick to engage with the new leadership, and the fate of its air and naval bases was high on the agenda. Indeed, an eye on relations with the new regime may well have informed Vladimir Putin’s decision to give sanctuary to ousted President Bashar al-Assad. A quick departure of Assad, with minimal bloodshed, was likely a tactical manoeuvre. Indeed, shortly after the fall of Assad, the new regime was keen to stress that Russian (and Chinese) diplomatic missions would be respected, as the struggle was only with Assad and the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some reports indicate that a drawdown of Russian presence from some areas does not indicate imminent closure of the Tartus port or Khmeimim airbase, another key strategic asset for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, multiple interests are at play; even though the US has appeared to allow much of Russian activity in the area to go uncontested to date, this is not a state of affairs on which Russia is likely to rely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey, as another key player, maintains warmer relations with Russia than most NATO member states, but it is the reason Russia has lost direct access to the Black Sea through the Bosporus. This is a key driver for why Russia needs a foothold in the Mediterranean – to provide the necessary logistical and maintenance support for a Mediterranean fleet, including the ability for munitions resupply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the light of these uncertainties, Putin may well be keen to avoid having all his proverbial eggs in a single basket at Tartus, even if HTS and its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa – the new de facto Syrian government – allow access for the time being. The illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine, the resultant sanctions and inevitable frictions with NATO member states mean Russia’s options in the Mediterranean are limited, even for establishing a semi-permanent naval base that allows power projection in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geopolitical relationships are rarely straightforward. While Turkey remains a key interlocutor with NATO, Black Sea access nonetheless remains denied. Turkey was further antagonised during Russia’s December 2024 test-firing of a Zirkon hypersonic missile in the Eastern Mediterranean. However, its ire was directed more at Greece, which had granted access rights for the Russian exercise, due to the longstanding dispute over the waters in question. As such, an arrangement brokered by Turkey that leaves Russia in possession of Tartus remains possible. However, at the time of writing this is far from assured, and even if Russia remains at Tartus in the short term, it faces the long-term risk of eviction by a future Syrian government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-options-if-it-loses-tartus&quot;&gt;Russia’s Options if it Loses Tartus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tartus itself was something of a consolation prize for the Soviet navy in its day, with the USSR becoming increasingly reliant on the facility after its alliance with Egypt (and access to its bigger harbours and better facilities) was lost in the 1970s following Anwar Sadat’s realignment. With its relatively small harbour and initially restrictive rules regarding Soviet access, Tartus was considered a poor substitute. This has proven unproblematic for post-Soviet Russia as it has no aspirations to maintain a force capable of fighting a high-intensity war in the Mediterranean. At best it could perhaps aspire to a harassing role. Rather, the Russian naval squadron in the Mediterranean, typically numbering no more than 11 vessels including 3–5 auxiliaries in recent years, has served as a tool for deterrent signalling, intelligence gathering, interventions in smaller-scale conflicts and posturing in support of Russia’s allies. For example, the fleet has convoyed Iranian oil to Syria (making interdiction more risky, irrespective of the military balance) and conducted Kalibr strikes in support of the Assad regime. In effect, Russia does not need a major naval hub to replace Tartus and retain its presence in the region given that this presence was always likely to be a limited one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the loss of Tartus would not be devoid of consequences for the Russian navy. Access to the base gives Russia the ability to refuel and resupply vessels and critically provides a maintenance centre in the region. This latter facility likely accounts for the considerable amounts of time that Russian vessels such as the Admiral Grigorevich have been able to spend in the region without rotating to their home ports. The closure of the Turkish straits, as a consequence of the conflict in Ukraine, has severed the link between the Mediterranean squadron and the Black Sea Fleet. This has forced vessels to be deployed from even further afield than was previously the case. For a Russian navy built around green water vessels with limited endurance, losing access to these facilities would significantly limit the navy’s staying power. Even port access arrangements in states such as Libya or Algeria would only partially compensate for this, given both geographical factors and the need for maintenance. As a consequence, one would expect Mediterranean deployments to impose considerable burdens on a limited fleet of auxiliaries such as the Project 160 oiler, with the ratio of combatants to auxiliaries likely to shift in favour of the latter. Moreover, the requirement to rotate vessels for maintenance would mean that more vessels would need to be deployed to the Mediterranean to maintain a standing regional presence, with consequences for Russia’s force structure and posture elsewhere. As such, Russia would require a base to offset losing Tartus if it is to remain a regional player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A traditional ally to Russia, with a stable and well-established maritime tradition, would be Algeria. It receives approximately 85% of its military equipment and training from Russia. However, there have been recent political difficulties relating to Russian activities in Mali and how these conflict with Algerian interests. Some reports suggest that the US may hope that this will translate into a greater divergence between the two, indicating that Algeria could prove an uncertain host for any Russian basing. Algeria has 13 major commercial ports, as well as ship repair facilities. However, as one of the region’s most successful economic centres with commercially viable shipping infrastructure, it is not clear that the strategic calculus would favour hosting a permanent Russian presence without a clear imperative in Algiers’ favour. This having been said, Russia might seek to perform some maintenance activities in Algeria, given that this is less contentious than basing. The Algerian navy currently operates Kilo-class submarines, and facilities built to support these could also service Russian assets. Any maintenance facility would be only a partial substitute for the Russian-owned facility in Tartus, since access would be dependent on the policies of the Algerian government and might possibly require negotiation on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian decision-makers may also consider maritime projection from the Red Sea, particularly leveraging relations with Sudan. Port Sudan offers facilities that could support a modest Russian presence, and this is already a line of effort for establishing a Red Sea presence. Russia has switched allegiance from the Rapid Support Forces to the Sudan Armed Forces, arguably specifically to improve maritime access. However, negotiations over establishing a military maritime foothold, despite being several years in, are still floundering. This in itself would likely make Port Sudan a poor option as an immediate Tartus alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even should the proposed base – capable of supporting four ships – become a reality, this would still be a poor substitute for Tartus. The logistical constraints of negotiating the Suez Canal, particularly in cases of requiring emergency maintenance, are significant. Operationally, canal transits also clearly signpost ship movements to adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third option would be Eastern Libya, dominated by Russian-backed General Khalifa Haftar. There are an estimated 2,000 Russian mercenary troops in Eastern Libya, and there is a well-established precedent for supporting wider Russian activity in Africa through Libya. With the spectre of a total – or gradual – loss of free use of Tartus, looking to establish a more permanent footing in Libya could be a consideration, especially as Russia already operates the Al Kadim airbase in this region. With a concentration of effort in eastern Libya, Tobruk and potentially also Benghazi could offer safe haven to a homeless Russian Mediterranean Fleet. There is at present some evidence of a Russian effort to move military equipment from Syria to Libya, though whether this is a temporary measure is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply lines through Tobruk are already established. However, with limited repair facilities and no dry dock, few berths of sufficient size, and limited opportunities for expansion, long-term investment in a permanent presence would likely present technical challenges. Tobruk was never a primary naval facility for the Libyan Navy and thus has limited dedicated military infrastructure. A port in the area would also share a harbour with a commercial port which is busier than Tartus (Latakia was more central to Syrian commerce). Since Tartus itself was made viable despite being a port with limited capacity, this might be deemed acceptable, and these are not insurmountable constraints. However, building maintenance facilities, munitions storage sites and berths will still prove time-consuming. While sharing a harbour with civilian vessels thus poses challenges, there are also some advantages. The commercial facilities of Tobruk and Benghazi could also provide Russia with an opportunity to replace its planned hub for agricultural exports in Tartus, a project into which it had planned to invest $500 million and which was meant to expand its footprint as an agricultural exporter in the Middle East and North Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benghazi port, also within Haftar’s influence and potentially more welcoming of a Russian presence, has a greater capacity that Tobruk. It is a key port for bringing in humanitarian aid and boasts more comprehensive maintenance facilities which have serviced vessels from the nearby Benghazi naval facility, although much of its infrastructure remains unusable due to conflict damage. Moreover, the area around Benghazi within the Gulf of Sidra provides more usable space for dedicated military facilities, which might limit the need to operate in close proximity to civilian traffic. For example, Haftar’s Libyan National Army appears to be intent on building both air and naval facilities in the vicinity of Benghazi. Arguably, this could present opportunities to invest and establish a presence in the medium term, but Russia will be either building or supporting the construction of infrastructure from a low baseline in terms of existing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is the question of political risk. Any Russian presence in Libya would at a minimum be dependent on Turkish goodwill, given Turkey’s naval advantages in the region and its capacity to further support the Libyan Government of National Accord. This might be tolerable for Russia, since this was arguably true in Syria as well. However, unlike Assad, Haftar is not altogether an international pariah and maintains a working relationship with France, for example. Russia may find negotiating additional access more challenging than was the case in Syria. Pressure from Haftar’s other partners might not lead to a denial of access given that Russia remains his most important backer, but might condition the nature of the access provided. For example, the terms of access might come to resemble those offered to the Russians by Hafez al-Assad, with the navy prevented from maintaining many shore-based facilities and compelled to use harbour-based auxiliary vessels to support maintenance. Moreover, should Haftar come to see other alignments as being more beneficial than the Russian relationship, the eviction of Russian assets cannot be ruled out, much as occurred in Sadat’s Egypt. Admittedly, these remain very distant prospects, and it should not be presumed that Russia could not secure an additional base in Libya. However, dependence on a partner which is not an international pariah – and which is therefore subject to more complex demands and influences – is more fraught with political risk for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be the case that Russia retains access to Tartus as a function of an arrangement with Syria’s new rulers. However, if the Russian navy loses this access, it will not cease to be a regional player, but its presence will be far more diluted. Access arrangements would be a poor substitute for the presence at Tartus, and even basing rights in Libya (the most likely substitute for Syria) would not initially provide a substitute for the in-region maintenance that Tartus allowed. Moreover, any partners upon whom Russia might rely are not as wholly dependent on it as Assad was, posing long-term political risks. Russia’s days as a regional player in the Mediterranean may not be numbered per se, but its access and capacity to maintain a meaningful presence could become far less assured.&lt;/p&gt;

This body of activities has become known by a variety of terms, such as “state threats”, “hostile state activity” and “hostile activity by states”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, much of the current discourse around state threats has been poorly and loosely defined, and has tended to focus more on the topic’s military than civilian aspects. Much research has also failed to ask a variety of basic questions about why the issue of state threats is so important now, both as a phenomenon, and also as a subject of policymaking for Western governments. Many of the activities that fall under the broad umbrella of state threats are well-known covert and clandestine activities such as espionage, sabotage and subversion. There are natural questions of how novel or significant state threats truly are, and indeed, how much Western governments care about them as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research seeks to address these concerns, looking to provide firmer definitional boundaries, and, within them, to explore the scale, scope and character of modern state threats, especially – but not exclusively – from a Western perspective. The research notes that besides the apparent explosion in the volume and range of hostile activities, there is much that is “new” about them, from the combination of traditional intelligence tradecraft with new technologies, attempts to innovate, a willingness to take greater risks, and a growing willingness to contract out violent and/or dangerous clandestine and covert activities to both licit and illicit non-state actors – especially organised crime groups. It is also clear that many hostile activities take advantage of new vulnerabilities in society that have never existed before, such as the ubiquity of social media and societal reliance on technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the research shows how state threats have become more important as tools of policy due to “geopolitical climate change”. Perceived changes in global power balances and receding agreement on international norms of behaviour are permitting and encouraging more states – non-aligned and Western, as well as authoritarian opponents of the West – to use hostile acts that mostly fall short of war to achieve their political ends. Although current evidence suggests that the results of these kinds of activities are mixed at best, their relative cheapness and apparent lack of political risk are likely to make them an attractive form of coercive statecraft in the medium term. While this might be bearable for highly resilient states in the short term, this is unlikely to be the case for less stable societies, and if sustained over the long term, could even have more severe effects on open societies that have robust protections in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2024, the UK’s defence secretary, Grant Shapps, warned the British public of the rising threat to the UK of hostile, state-backed activity from countries including China, Russia and Iran. The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, informed the House of Commons in March of that year that Chinese state-backed hackers had conducted cyber espionage campaigns against UK parliamentarians and the UK Electoral Commission in 2021 and 2022. The following month, two British men were charged with committing arson in support of Russia; and Iranian journalist Pouria Zeraati was stabbed outside his home in London, while the suspected attackers, who were apparently acting on behalf of the Iranian state, fled the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Shapps forewarned at the start of the year, the UK would endure a prolonged wave of state-linked hostile acts in 2024. But this wave was not altogether new; in March 2023, the assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Matt Jukes, stated that his force’s casework on foreign interference and espionage had increased fourfold since March 2018, with the attempted poisoning of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. Nor was it limited to the UK. Across Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, other states also faced a rising cadence of similar hostile operations, ranging from intrusive commercial espionage to physical sabotage, cyber attacks, violence against political activists and political interference. Much of this activity had been directed at Western liberal democracies by authoritarian offenders, but this was not universally the case; transnational repression, cyber attacks and subversive disinformation campaigns were also becoming a more common currency of statecraft in other regions, among states of various constitutional complexions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such state-backed hostile activity is not a complete novelty, and has a long and continuous history, even during relatively peaceful periods. Nevertheless, some senior Western officials have begun to use language that frames the current wave of hostile acts in distinctly “epic” terms, something more than just the old wine of the clandestine in newer, more technologically advanced bottles. Several governments, such as those of the Netherlands, Australia, the UK and Canada, have thus begun to develop specific policies to respond to the threat of state-backed hostile activity. The problem they seek to tackle has been described in various ways: “state threats” in the UK (the term used in this paper), “threats from state actors” in the Netherlands and “hostile activity by state actors” in Canada, for example. But the core concern remains the same throughout: to find ways to mitigate the risk posed by detectable and unwelcome change in patterns of inter-state behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing importance of state threats as a specific policy challenge, however, the current volume of research on the topic is limited. This in itself should prompt further study, but the need is more pressing still, given the apparent immediacy of the issue. In response, the Serious Organised Crime &amp;amp; Anti-Corruption Evidence (SOC ACE) research programme sponsored two workshops of the State Threats Taskforce (STT) in March and June 2023, which were convened by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). The STT, which comprised former practitioners and experts from Europe and Five Eyes countries, revealed that even among those deeply immersed in relevant fields, there was uncertainty around fundamental questions such as the meaning and scope of the term state threats, how best to assess such threats, and consequently, how to develop a response to them. For the sake of productive discussions, the workshop attendees decided to take an intuitive approach to defining state threats, following the words of Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart on obscenity: “I know it when I see it”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a reasonable basis for initial discussions, however, indistinct definitional boundaries do not provide sufficient grounds for the development of effective policy. Ideally, policymakers require a common conceptualisation of a problem, without which their actions risk being piecemeal, unnecessary or incongruent. The clearest finding of the STT workshops was, therefore, that further research was needed to review the basic concept of state threats and arrive at a foundational threat assessment, upon which appropriate strategies and responses could be developed. As a result, this research aims to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Clarify the meaning and coherence of the term state threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understand why state threats have emerged as an issue now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Map out the scope and nature of current state threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Assess the effectiveness of hostile activity as a tool of state policy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider the potential development in the state threats landscape in the short to medium term (two to five years, following definitions of duration common in government and business).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the paper touches upon current and potential policy responses to state threats, interventions are not the focus of the paper and are not addressed extensively here. These issues require further study; it is hoped that a further opportunity to provide one will be possible in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-argument-and-structure&quot;&gt;1.1. Argument and structure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper begins in section 2 by addressing the foundational question of definition and the current state of research literature on state threats. As noted above, the UK government uses the term state threats to denote hostile activity by states; other governments use variations on this formula. Some states and international organisations such as the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) also use the term “hybrid threats” for analogous challenges, but properly speaking, this term deals more with the use of mixed and innovative methods of hostile action, rather than the actors that use them (which can be both state and non-state actors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definitions used by governments for state threats and cognate terms broadly include the same elements: covert, coercive, corrupt, illegal, threatening or undermining acts against other states’ interests, carried out by state actors, or non-state actors on their behalf. These acts often fall short of what is commonly accepted as war within the current international system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the commonalities in their definitions, there are some differences too – some states include overt as well as covert hostile acts, for example. There are also many ambiguities around intent and responsibility in the various definitions, which risks making them too wide-ranging to be of use. For example, in one policy definition it is theoretically possible for a state-linked act that damages another state to be seen as a state threat, even when it is not explicitly intended to be so. Moreover, the various definitions leave significant issues unresolved; for instance, while most emphasise the role of non-state actors in the execution of state threats, they do not provide a method for deciding when a hostile action by a state-linked non-state actor is a state threat and when it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers cannot wish away these complexities; but although ambiguities will remain, the aim should be to minimise them. Pragmatism suggests that many overtly hostile state acts fall within the accepted “rules of the game” of international statecraft, but some, which seek to twist or stretch those rules, or infringe basic norms such as state sovereignty, do not. In effect, they are statecraft conducted in bad faith. These distortions of commonly used methods of statecraft sit within the scope of state threats, especially as they can both accompany and lay the groundwork for other covert and coercive acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the question of intent, some state behaviours are indeed unhelpful, but lack an underlying intention to cause harm to another state or its interests, at least at the outset. Nonetheless, what starts as negligence or antisocial behaviour can be exploited at some stage. Other state actions – direct investment in other states’ infrastructure, for example – might seem constructive and indeed helpful. But they can make the recipient dependent and thus vulnerable on the helping state, even if that state’s original intentions were genuinely benevolent or sought mutual benefit. Neither negligence nor support is therefore strictly speaking a “state threat”’, but both types of action might eventually be used with malign intent in the future or “weaponised”, to use a neologism of the moment. Such behaviours might thus be seen as “dual use” forms of statecraft that can be turned to different ends, depending on the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the further vexed issue of how far states can be held accountable for the activities of non-state actors, it is difficult, if not impossible to develop detailed evidence of operational connections between states and non-state actors. Nonetheless, if non-state actors do show evidence of interaction with a state and an alignment with state actor behaviours – whether in method, target choice or timing ‒ there are reasonable grounds for seeing their activities as state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, given the relative novelty of the term state threats, academic and research literature specifically discussing the area under that term is limited at present. Nonetheless, there is a large body of existing research on relevant adjacent areas such as “hybrid” and “grey zone” war/warfare/conflict/threats – among the various nouns being used with these opening descriptors ‒ as well as a growing revival of interest in “covert action” and newer concepts such as “intelligence conflicts”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A limiting factor to the value of this literature has been its tendency to focus on hostile activities in periods of acute crisis or near-war situations, with a heavy accent on military activity, although research on the grey zone has looked at more chronic, low-level crises too. This latter body of work is thus more germane to the concept of state threats, but both areas provide useful material on the novel and multi-stranded character of much current conflict and statecraft, and, importantly, the varying ways in which different types of states frame hostile acts. While there is a bias in Western scholarship towards drawing a clear line between war and peace (hence the difficulty of defining state threats), for states such as Russia, which use hostile methods more actively, there is more of an interest in their feasibility and value. What is a theoretical debate for some is a question of application for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this necessary groundwork completed, the paper goes on in section 3 to ask why, if state threats are not new, they have become such an issue now. Most importantly, the answer is because of mounting evidence; where quantitative data are available, the indications are that they are on the rise. However, perceptions matter too. The hostile behaviour of states seeking to revise the international order, hereafter described as “revisionist powers”, has become increasingly worrisome. Acts such as Russia’s seizure of Crimea in March 2014 and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 that were previously treated as background frictions to be downplayed in favour of maintaining good relations have increasingly been seen as intimations of much darker designs than previously supposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further reason is timing: the rise in the danger from state activity, both actual and perceived, has come when other recent national security challenges have been in relative abeyance. The Islamist extremist terrorist threat has remained and the extreme right has become more dangerous. But while terrorist attacks have continued, government efforts to degrade terrorists’ operational capabilities have helped make them mostly small and containable, in comparison to the attacks of the first 20 years of the 21st century. This has allowed policymakers more space to address the challenge of state threats. Nonetheless, the size of this space should not be overstated, as attacks and planned attacks by Islamic State (IS) affiliates in Iran, Russia and Austria in 2024 indicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next three sections look at the nature of the current state threats challenge in more detail. Section 4 looks at the variety of methods states are currently using, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;espionage&lt;/strong&gt;, especially commercial espionage;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;intimidation&lt;/strong&gt;, including rising levels of transnational repression;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sabotage&lt;/strong&gt;, “cybotage” and the “systemic overload” of social systems, through the weaponisation of criminal activities such as illegal migration;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;subversion&lt;/strong&gt; of the information environment to shape the views, actions and decision-making of audiences within a targeted state;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;malign influence&lt;/strong&gt; on elite figures and groups with the power and position to guide the public policy of a targeted state;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sponsorship of groups&lt;/strong&gt; seeking to destabilise the existing political order of a targeted state; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;orchestration of regime/governmental change&lt;/strong&gt;, through support for coup d’états or direct interference in electoral processes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 5 considers how these activities are initiated and executed – in effect, the mechanics of state threats. Despite some of the media-shaped images of leaders such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia being in full control of their countries’ activities, it seems likely that hostile acts emerge from a variety of different channels, from “business as usual” planning by intelligence agencies, to bureaucratic responses to the expressed or perceived preferences of state leaders. Freelance endeavours by state and non-state actors that might not be “approved” until after the fact also need to be included. Additionally, section 5 looks at the variety of operatives who execute hostile acts, ranging from state officials and intelligence officers to a wide variety of non-state actors in “legitimate” spheres such as business and civil society, as well as the increasingly important worlds of private military contractors/companies (PMCs), organised crime groups (OCGs) and cyber-criminals, and to a lesser extent, terrorist and militia groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 6 then takes the analysis further by looking for underlying patterns in the qualitative evidence. While this lacks the potential rigour of a quantitative analysis, particularly given currently patchy availability of relevant data cross regions and threat types, it is apparent there have been “booms” in certain areas of espionage, sabotage and subversion in recent years, along with an attempt to innovate using new tools and unexpected loopholes in Western law. It is also clear that cyber techniques have grown in importance, especially in volume activities such as disinformation, although human officers and agents remain an invaluable part of a state’s capability. Not everything can be done, or done well, remotely or via computer. The section also highlights the importance of distinctive national “styles” of hostile activity. Of all the core revisionist states which oppose the current international order, Russia appears to be the most wide-ranging and reckless in its behaviour. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (hereafter, North Korea) and Iran also take substantial risks, but have a more limited field of activities due to their more modest size and resources. China – despite being the largest and most powerful of the four core revisionist states – is the most careful and circumspect about how, when and against whom it undertakes hostile acts, at least for now. Indeed, indications are increasing of growing Chinese aggressiveness in some areas, especially cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section 7 looks at the motives behind states’ use of state threats. Among Western media and some experts, it is a widely shared view that the perceived rise of state threats reflects aggressive behaviour against Western democracies by a handful of authoritarian regimes – China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. Allowing that there is a strong thread of truth in this narrative, this section argues, however, that although these four core revisionist states are the most significant current part of the state threats problem, they are not the only part. Hostile acts are not the sole province of authoritarian states and Western democracies are not the only targets. Indeed, hostile acts between states continue to occur in a variety of contexts; democracies have targeted other democracies; non-Western authoritarian states have targeted one another; and Western democratic states have themselves used such methods, albeit more rarely, and circumscribed by law and ethical constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is driving revisionist hostility and this accompanying decline in standards in international behaviour? The broader context has seen the confluence of several geopolitical trends, economic changes and technological developments. The most important of these has been the overall shift in global economic and political power away from the US and its allies towards China and other major developing economies. Although the US and its allies have held fast to their own vision of a rules-based liberal international order, China, Russia and others now see that order coming to an end, to be superseded by their preferred model, based on two key concepts: a form of “hard” state sovereignty that goes back to the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, making non-interference in other states’ affairs fundamental to international statecraft; and the idea that “great powers” – among which they include themselves – are different from other states, with the right to enjoy global predominance and spheres of influence. Two power centres and two world-views are thus fundamentally at odds, shaping the kind of epoch-changing situation that has often resulted in open war in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That this has not happened yet can probably best be explained by the cost-benefit calculations of the states involved. Any open great power conflict would be globally damaging both politically and economically, and potentially catastrophic if nuclear weapons were used. From the perspectives of states such as Russia and China, moreover, the US and its allies remain economically and militarily powerful; the outcome of any open conflict with them would be uncertain or even unwelcome. In a world where the costs and risks of war are so great, it makes sense for the revisionist states to behave in a way that does not provoke a military response. Thus, the use of hostile acts are ‒ and remain ‒ a logical middle way by which revisionist states can mount their challenge to status quo powers without triggering a potentially existential crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State threats are also attractive as tools of policy because of the advances brought about by economic globalisation and technology over the past 30 years. Societies, economies and polities are more interconnected than ever before, providing states with a level of access to potential targets that would have been difficult during a period such as the Cold War. Developments such as the growth of cyberspace have been a key part of this global integration, moreover, providing avenues for less wealthy states to access and target regional rivals or even global opponents. Interests and operational options have come together in ways that have made the deployment of state threat-type activity the safest and most affordable way to express inter-state hostility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the revisionists, moreover, there are few internal constraints on them using such measures, even if they bring collateral damage to the wellbeing, liberties and human rights of civilians in other countries. Such states already show little concern for the rights of their own citizens at home; it is of little surprise that they show limited concern for the rights of other states’ citizens either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors, which have shaped the behaviour of the main revisionist states, have also had a wider impact on “geopolitical climate change”, promoting hostile action as an acceptable form of statecraft for states that are relatively uninvolved in the competition between the major powers. For those which have in the past either feared a US response to antisocial international behaviour, or looked to the US for security, the environment has changed. “Middle powers” in the developing world have thus increasingly felt enabled or prompted by changing circumstances to take matters into their own hands, with state threats an obvious way to target their local rivals. Given the relative cheapness and accessibility of cyberspace, moreover, this has been easier to do than ever before. Anywhere in the networked world can be part of the virtual battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If state threats are a relatively low-cost means to pursue state ends, the logical next concern is whether they provide a reasonable return on investment. Section 8 addresses this question, finding that despite the widespread use of state threats, their tangible impact is difficult to discern, at least at present. Certainly, in fields such as espionage, massive campaigns, such as the one currently being mounted by China, have reaped an enormous economic dividend – but also at a reputational cost. In other cases, the use of assassination, sabotage, cyber effects and various types of political interference have not necessarily produced unambiguously positive results, whether measured by reducing opponents’ capabilities or by causing them to shift their policies. In fact, much hostile activity not only undermines the reputations of the states involved, but also leads to countermeasures that have the potential to make future hostile actions less effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, too optimistic a view of the effectiveness of state threats might yet prove to be misguided. Even if Western governments only evaluate the effectiveness of state threats on the relatively narrow basis of results alone, it is possible that states using hostile acts will get an occasional “lucky hit” – some see Russian interference in the US 2016 presidential election as an example – or that their activities will help wear down their targets’ resilience over the medium to long term. Additionally, governments using hostile actions might have different metrics from weighing up costs against tangible benefits. It is possible that some states see such behaviours as useful ways to “signal” credibility and intent to other governments. Alternatively, their continuance might simply be the result of institutional rigidity, with state agencies continuing to undertake hostile acts as part of a self-generating pattern of behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As section 9 suggests, moreover, the relatively limited impact of state threats so far does not guarantee their lack of impact in the future. Among the core revisionist states, regime intentions remain the same, and in some cases – in that of China, most worryingly – there is evidence that those intentions are hardening. At the same time, as technological capabilities such as artificial intelligence (AI) advance, the means to cause damage at a higher volume and velocity are growing, especially in relatively open Western societies. This will not only sustain the threat from the revisionist states, but also probably push and encourage other states to use similarly abrasive forms of statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, section 10 concludes the paper by arguing that governments should take the problem of state threats seriously, despite their patchy record of apparent success so far. It is therefore imperative not only to tackle both the dangers from directly targeted hostile actions, but also to address the overall shift in the character of international statecraft that is currently taking place. Governments should not only be looking to their own states’ safety and resilience, but to that of their wider neighbourhoods. As noted at the outset, while some Western states have begun to face up to the challenge of state threats, the response has not been universal; the approaches taken have been piecemeal and episodic, with sector-by-sector responses that are not always aligned with a clear threat assessment or connected to wider government, civil society or international initiatives. For a problem that is so fluid, complex and cross-sectoral, it is apparent that governments have some way to go before they can provide consistent and germane responses that are well-calibrated to the challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;12-methodology&quot;&gt;1.2. Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence that informs this paper has been gathered from various sources. Desk research has been the primary method, comprising reviews of STT notes, research papers identified through the academic databases EBSCO and JSTOR, and open source searches of the internet with the search engine Google. Books, sections and articles were identified through a range of search strings including terms such as “state threats”, “hostile state activity”, “hostile activity” and “hostile acts”, and further terms that regularly appear in relevant subject-adjacent literature, such as “hybrid warfare”, “grey zone warfare/conflict” and “weaponisation”. These terms were also combined with country names, including the four core revisionist states identified by the STT ‒ China, Iran, North Korea and Russia ‒ but also in combination with other countries of potential interest during the process of research, such as Belarus, Syria and Venezuela, and less obvious candidates such as Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to reviewing existing research literature, the study looked at relevant policy statements, legislation and research from departments, agencies, legislatures and bureaucracies of national governments and international organisations, which were sourced via official websites. Credible media reports on potential state threat incidents were located via online searches using Google, where search strings combined categories of types of state threat actions identified in the process of research (such as assassination, cyber operations and so on) with countries of interest. Searches were limited to English language sources (or those translated into English) published since March 2014. This date was chosen because it allowed for a review of a decade’s worth of relevant material, and coincided with the Russian annexation of Crimea, which marked a significant watershed in Western perceptions of the potential importance of state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a period of desk research, the lead investigator conducted 50 semi-structured interviews by video conference platforms with academic experts, researchers, journalists, current and former government officials and practitioners. The interviewees were located in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, and were selected based on their knowledge and expertise on state threats or related areas, specific domains such as cyber or disinformation, and/or specific countries and regions. Interviewees were informed that notes would be taken during the discussions, but the discussions themselves would not be recorded, and would be treated as confidential; names, organisations or other identifying data would not be included in the text, unless otherwise agreed. The use of any specific evidence or judgements was agreed in writing and, where requested, the identities of individuals have been anonymised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the global significance of the state threats issue, the scope of this paper was naturally limited by the researcher’s location in the UK and linguistic barriers. Unsurprisingly, therefore, it is written from a Western perspective, and the terms “the West” and “Western” appear consistently throughout the text to make the geographic and cultural scope of assessments clear. The paper uses the terms in the same sense as Australian counter-insurgency expert David Kilcullen, who has described “the West” or “Western societies” as a “loose collection of countries” primarily in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region that “are allied or aligned with the United States … and that often collaborate in coalitions or international institutions”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If geography and language limit the paper’s scope, they also affect the character of its judgements. The paper’s conclusions are shaped by the researcher’s circumstances in a liberal, democratic, free market society in the developed world. Despite the conscious aim of objectivity, the underlying assumptions of this type of society will have had an effect that cannot be ignored. Nonetheless, the paper still seeks to take as balanced a perspective as possible; indeed, a key finding of the paper is that state threats should not simply be viewed through a lens of “the West versus the rest”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, from a methodological perspective, some comment is required on the length of the paper, which is much greater than originally intended. It soon became obvious during the research process that the field of state threats was much vaster than the STT workshops had suggested, and that a tight curatorial approach would be needed on the use of evidence in any research product. Consequently – and even at the length of the paper as it currently stands – it remains highly selective, and somewhat akin to “a motorcycle ride through the art gallery,” in the words of former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) deputy director Admiral William Studeman. The author therefore wishes to apologise in advance for any lacunae that readers with country- or domain-specific expertise will almost certainly identify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-definitions-and-literature&quot;&gt;2. Definitions and literature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term state threats and similar formulations are relatively new to the lexicon of UK government policy, emerging around 2017/18, prior to and in the wake of the attempted poisoning of Sergei Skripal. The term was used to name the Joint State Threats Assessment Team, created in June 2017 and based at the UK Security Service (MI5)’s Thames House headquarters, but ministers and officials also used other similar terms including “hostile state activity”, “hostile activity by states” and “state-based threats” at the time. However, in 2021 the term state threats was chosen as the preferred descriptor; hostile state activity, in particular, was rejected because it might imply that certain states were hostile by definition, and the UK government wanted to stress that it was more concerned with hostile behaviours rather than specific states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Home Office provided a fuller definition of state threats in its Consultation on Legislation to Counter State Threats (Hostile State Activity) in May 2021, which introduced measures later included in the subsequent National Security Act. According to the consultation, state threats comprise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Overt or covert action orchestrated by foreign governments which falls short of general armed conflict … but nevertheless seeks to undermine or threaten the safety and interests of the UK, including: the integrity of its democracy, its public safety, its military advantage and its reputation or economic prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consultation also defined five key state threat categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Threats to people, through harassment or physical violence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Threats to things, such as the nation’s critical national infrastructure (CNI) or overseas supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Espionage against both the public and private sector, including academic, scientific, technological and commercial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interference in political, electoral, economic or social processes or decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Threats to geostrategic interests, in the reshaping of international norms and the misuse of rules, norms and agreements to coerce other states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While more traditional terms were mostly not used, these categories largely covered the classic and well-known behaviours of state intelligence and security agencies, including transnational repression (threats to people), sabotage (threats to things) and subversion (interference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Western states have also developed policy language for the phenomenon of state threats in recent years, although the terms used vary from country to country. The three examples provided below, from the Netherlands, Canada and Australia, are far from an exhaustive sample, but they give a flavour of how similar challenges are defined outside the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/zHXfZNi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Non-UK terminology on state threats.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While none of these definitions is an exact match with the UK definition, there are similarities between the terms. Each takes an implicitly similar perspective on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the severity of the threat – state threats fall short of the internationally defined nature of war or armed conflict;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the source of the threat – state threats are initiated by state actors but can be executed either by state or non-state actors;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the character of the threat – state threats are covert, deceptive, corrupt, illegal, coercive or surreptitiously threatening; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the intention behind, and effect of, the threat – state threats damage other states’ interests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite parallels, there are also notable variations and ambiguities between them. While the consensus is to focus on behaviours that are likely to be conducted secretly or duplicitously, the UK also includes overt hostile acts in its definition. This is slightly messy, and brings with it the question of whether all aggressive or hostile overt acts can be deemed to be state threats. If so, then state threats might also include robust measures used and endorsed by Western states, such as economic and financial sanctions, military deployments, the exercise of maritime rights or alliance building. This would in fact accord with the views of some states, such as India, which do not support the application of national sanctions outside the UN framework, or those, such as China, which reject settled bilateral or multilateral alliances. Including overt acts without any qualification would therefore risk either creating a definition that is so broad as to be meaningless, or include wide swathes of statecraft that Western states deem largely acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further problem is the extent to which a damaging state behaviour should be considered a threat where a state’s intentions are ambiguous. In the definitions of the UK and Canada, a hostile act is intended to harm the interests of another state; there is implied political intent. In the case of the Netherlands, however, the definition also encompasses undermining actions that could harm another state’s interests, without making it clear whether those actions are intended to cause harm or not. On such grounds, a vast range of antisocial state behaviours could be interpreted as state threats; if a state pumps effluent into a sea shared with a near neighbour, this might cause major health problems for the population of the neighbour, but it might seem odd to see this as a state threat rather than just antisocial behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other problematic situations arise when considering the effects of time and changing intent. All of the definitions appear to be founded on a presumption that the state “act” is either one thing, or another – hostile or otherwise. But apparently positive or mutually beneficial state interactions such as the provision of aid, investment, technology transfers and so on also have the potential to be used by the providing state to undermine or manipulate the recipient, whether that is part of their original intention or not. It might seem sensible therefore to also include interactions which have the potential to damage a state at some point as prima facie state threats. But to do so would then mean that decades’ worth of positive interstate interactions, many benevolent or motivated by a desire for mutual benefit, would need to be seen as potential preludes to future blackmail. Such reasoning seems paranoid in the extreme. At the same time, if such actions were totally excluded from the scope of state threats, it would potentially exclude areas of genuine future risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further dimensions to the problem of intent arise from the role of non-state actors in hostile activity. An OCG or terrorist network might act on behalf of a state on occasion, but such groups are also likely to have their own interests and agendas that are damaging to other states, but unaligned with the needs or interests of their sometime state partner. It seems obvious that those actions undertaken on behalf of a state should be included as state threats, but sifting out the state-linked behaviours of a non-state actor from the non-state-linked ones is much easier to propose than accomplish. From the outside, other states will only see the non-state actors’ actions, and not necessarily whether they arise as the result of a relationship with a state actor. Given how murky the nexus between state and non-state actors is, therefore, it might seem prudent to view the actions of all non-state actors with known state links as state threats; however, to do so would be far from parsimonious, in light of the scale of terrorist and criminal activity in the world, and would again risk making the term state threats so broad as to be meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;21-clarifying-the-definition&quot;&gt;2.1. Clarifying the definition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest answer to these difficulties is to understand state threats very narrowly or broadly, either excluding or including all problematic categories. However, both approaches have significant weaknesses; the former risks ignoring many relevant hostile behaviours and actors, and the latter risks creating a vast and undifferentiated spectrum of hostile activities that may, or may not, be state related. Consequently, some pragmatism is required to find an understanding of the term that does not dilute its meaning too far and provides a workable scope for investigation. In the probably apocryphal words attributed to Albert Einstein, “Things should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centre of gravity of governments’ thinking is that state threats are largely covert activities. But how to parse “acceptable” and “unacceptable” forms of overt statecraft? The acceptability of various overt activities under international law or custom are open to wide interpretation, even when states agree on the letter of the law or usual pattern of practice. However, it is feasible at least to exclude some types of overt hostile behaviour from the scope of state threats. Firstly, some forms of overt hostile action are explicitly allowed under international law in response to other states’ hostile and illegal actions, such as forcing international waterways to assert the freedom of the seas if a blockade is attempted, for example. Secondly, some forms of overt action, while not explicitly endorsed by international law, are similar to those used by the international community through the UN, such as economic and financial sanctions. This leaves overt hostile activities that are explicitly banned (wars of aggression, for example), and a zone of activities – various forms of coercive diplomacy, most notably – that are neither explicitly endorsed nor prohibited by international law and practice. Sifting the acceptable from the unacceptable within this zone is a difficult matter, touching on both ethics and taste. However, some potential rules of thumb might establish whether a state’s overt behaviour could be deemed less acceptable as peacetime conduct, especially when used in conjunction with covert hostile acts. These are behaviours that, in effect, go against the intended spirit of the rules, if not their precise letter, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extreme behaviours that push acceptable forms of statecraft to the very edge of international practice, such as the use of physical threats in diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Subversive behaviours that distort, infringe or manipulate rules and norms with antisocial behaviours, such as seeking to redraw international boundaries without consent, or using international tools and institutions in dishonest or misleading ways.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are rough arbiters of the line between “acceptable” and “unacceptable” behaviour, it is probably through the pragmatic application of these criteria, imprecise though they may be. If overt acts are intended to cheat, twist or subvert existing international rules and norms, they are likely to go beyond the boundaries of “rough” statecraft into the realm of state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On questions of intention and responsibility, common experience suggests that while sins of omission, negligence or inattention can be unhelpful, damaging or even dangerous, they are rarely treated as threats. A doctor whose mistakes lead to the death of a patient can be accused of negligence, or manslaughter, but not murder. Intention needs to play a role. At the same time, the consequences of normal inter-state behaviour that might later be misused or abused cannot be treated as immediate threats as such, without good evidence to suggest that they are intended otherwise. Again, common experience suggests that a dependency created or exacerbated by acts of generosity or mutually beneficial cooperation only really becomes a threat when used as such by one partner or other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this principle as a guide, therefore, it is also defensible to exclude damaging state behaviours where there is no clear intention to cause harm to other states, with the following caveat. Both categories of behaviour – negligence and the intentional creation of dependencies – might have the potential to become state threats at some point, if channelled, shaped or twisted to cause specific harm. They might therefore be conceived as “potential state threats” or forms of “dual use” statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the same logic, to be seen as state threats, the acts of non-state actors cannot be treated as either state or non-state threats wholesale. Intermediate criteria need to be applied, both around intent and evidence of operational engagement. Where non-state actors undertake illegal acts of no or limited political significance, or acts clearly motivated by self-interest or group agendas, and even where non-state actors have relationships with state actors, these are not obviously state threats. To be so, there would need to be evidence of a relationship or operational entanglement with state actors, and reasonable grounds to believe that the non-state actors’ actions were being undertaken as a result of that engagement. This suggests that although non-state actors might undertake a hostile act they assess to be in the interest of a state, it should only be treated as a state threat if the act happens with demonstrable engagement or encouragement by a state actor. If the alternative interpretation were taken, states would be hostage to the actions of any group or individual that declared they were an instrument of that state’s interests, regardless of the views or actions of that state itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the principles developed above, we might therefore flesh out the previously ambiguous aspects in our definition of state threats in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severity&lt;/strong&gt; – state threats are hostile acts that fall short of the internationally defined nature of war, and/or distort and subvert peacetime international rules and norms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt; – state threats are initiated or encouraged by a state actor, and executed by a state or non-state actor for that state’s purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Character&lt;/strong&gt; – state threats are underhand and undermining (covert, deceptive, corrupt, illegal, coercive or threatening) or abuse accepted rules and norms to achieve hostile ends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intention and effect&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ state threats cause intentional and politically motivated damage to another state’s (or other states’) interests and assets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As readers will surmise, this definition is still a working model to which boundary cases will cause challenges. Nevertheless, it is a useful framework for analysis, and aligns with the underlying sense of the concept of state threats as expressed in various Western policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;22-hybrid-threats&quot;&gt;2.2. Hybrid threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cognate term to state threats used by NATO and the EU is that of “hybrid threats”. The European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (Hybrid CoE), a joint initiative of the two aforementioned international organisations, based in Helsinki, defines hybrid threats as actions “conducted by state or non-state actors, whose goal is to undermine or harm a target by combining overt and covert military and non-military means”. As will be obvious, the concepts of state and hybrid threats overlap, but they are not identical. In practice, hybrid threats are more concerned with the combination of threat methods than the identity of the perpetrating actor, which can be a state or non-state actor, including the latter acting on their own behalf. As a result, while it is possible to say some state threats might also be hybrid threats (for example, a state using combined means of hostile activity), this does not have to be the case, as a state threat could involve using a single method in a purely conventional way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-literature-review&quot;&gt;2.3. Literature review&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, the literature on state threats is both limited and extremely full. Although there is no field of “state threat studies”, there are several streams of relevant research in political science, history and military studies. The most significant is work on the concept of “hybrid war”, sometimes rendered as hybrid “warfare”, “conflict” or “threats”. The volume and breadth of the material in the field is massive and continues to grow, in part encouraged by various national-level debates among military and strategic scholars about the meaning of the phrase and its practical content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most often associated with Russian military thinkers, the hybrid idea first emerged in a contemporary setting in 1999 in Unrestricted Warfare, a book written by two colonels in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). In the book, Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui argued that the US’s overwhelming conventional military victory over Iraq in 1991 indicated that the US’s opponents would need to break rules and leverage vulnerabilities to defeat it in the future. In practice, this meant that China and others must use “all means, including armed force or non-armed force, military and non-military, and lethal and non-lethal means to compel the enemy to accept one’s interest”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analogous stream of thought emerged in the US in the following decade, initiated by US Marine colonel and scholar Frank Hoffman, who coined the term “hybrid war” in a 2007 article. As with Liang and Xiangsui, Hoffman argued that the use of blended tactics, exemplified by Islamist terrorist group Hezbollah, was becoming a major characteristic of fighting involving both state and non-state actors. The term was later picked up in Russian military discussions (in Russian as gibridnaya voina), but framed as a type of political warfare used by the US. In the Russian version, the US was seen using social media and civil society groups to foment “colour revolutions”, non-violent protest movements against authoritarian regimes in the former Soviet Union (USSR) and the Middle East. Despite pointing to the supposed American origin of this meaning, however, Russian military thinkers, including leading Russian general Valery Gerasimov, took the notion of hybridity as something they themselves should apply and improve upon in the future, mixing military methods with economic action, information campaigns and political subversion. Indeed, the subsequent Russian attack on Ukraine in 2014, which resulted in the annexation of Crimea, was seen initially by many Western observers as an exemplar of Russian hybrid warfare, combining as it did low-level military action, sabotage, cyber attacks, disinformation, simulated protests and criminal-led violence to destabilise the government in Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, then, there have been variations in the meaning of hybridity in different national discussions. For Chinese thinkers, hybridity has a tone of “anything goes”, in an all-encompassing state-against-state struggle for global dominance; for US thinkers, it indicates using various means in a distinctly military context; for Russian thinkers, the term points towards the use of non-military tools in combination with limited military means, to avoid a larger conflict while also making up for material deficiencies. However, despite these differences, there are common threads. At its core, as Kilcullen notes, the essence of much of the current discussion lies in the “addition and combination” of a variety of methods and tools, “bringing into play the maximum range of categories of conflict and combining them in novel ways”. In short, combination is the key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kilcullen’s reference to novelty also highlights another concept allied to that of hybrid war: weaponisation. Russia expert Mark Galeotti describes the “weaponisation wave” as “the notion of items and concepts not usually connected with conflict” being used as ways of demonstrating hostility, such as enabling criminality, or exploiting pre-existing economic and social vulnerabilities. However, as with other terms used in this field, although close in spirit to hybrid war, weaponisation is not identical to it; it is conceivable that a novel or unusual method could be used on its own and not in combination with other methods. Furthermore, hybridity does not require novelty, but can also involve the mixing of well-worn methods and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further related area is research on “grey zone” or “liminal” warfare or conflict. Although overlapping with other concepts, it too has distinct characteristics. While hybrid war and weaponisation focus on the combination or novelty of means, respectively, grey zone and liminal conflict emphasise the use of ambiguous methods to achieve political ends, seeking to damage a target without detection or attribution, thus making a robust response less likely. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the field of study is less focused on conventional military conflict, which the proponents of grey zone activity usually wish to avert, and more on the world of counter-insurgency and paramilitary action. This increasing interest in the study of the grey zone has dovetailed too with a revival of interest in the field of Western intelligence studies in the concept of covert action, defined from a US perspective by intelligence expert Loch Johnson as “clandestine intervention in the affairs of other nations for the purpose of advancing the global interests of the United States”. Grey zone activity and covert action have much in common, with a shared focus on the use of less easily detectable and attributable methods to achieve political ends; however, while it is difficult to draw a clear boundary between the two, covert action is more clearly within the purview of intelligence agencies than militaries, and less likely to involve identifiably military activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent studies of covert activity have looked at the increasing use of such methods by Russia, China and several other countries, while also asking questions about their practical and ethical validity as tools of statecraft for Western states. While work such as Cormac’s provides a survey of the covert realm as a whole, other scholars have produced notable country-specific studies, especially on the activities of Russian agencies and those of China. The growth of malign influence operations has been a major theme of much recent work on China, leading to several studies of Chinese intelligence penetration of Canada, Australia and South-East Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars have also looked at the concepts of hybrid war, grey zone conflict and covert action through the lenses of various domains, most notably cyberspace. Over the past three decades, a series of interpretative waves have rippled through cyber security studies: initially, in the 1990s, the so-called “revolution in military affairs” focused attention on the role of computers in improving militaries’ war-fighting capabilities. Then, from the late 1990s into the 2000s, as the internet became a growing reality across all aspects of life, scholars became more concerned about the role of cyber as a novel and devastating theatre of war. From the 2010s onwards, and in the absence of “cybergeddon”, the discussion moved on to the less melodramatic role cyber could play as an enabler of existing types of covert activity, such as espionage, sabotage or subversion. The debate has become even more nuanced in recent years, with experts debating whether cyber activity is a form of “intelligence conflict”, defined by cyber experts Robert Chesney and Max Smeets as statecraft pursued by the means and methods traditionally associated with intelligence agencies; or, as other cyber experts such as Michael Fischerkeller and associates prefer, a realm of “persistent engagement”, with attackers and defenders pursuing something akin to a virtual wrestling match, “deliberately calibrated to remain below the threshold that would elicit an armed response, seeking instead to produce cumulative gains over time”. Several authors have also highlighted how difficult clandestine and covert actions are in the cyber domain, constrained as they are by the same kinds of practical and political constraints that limit all forms of state action. Lennart Maschmeyer, another cyber expert, has highlighted how activity in the cyber domain faces the same “operational trilemma” as subversion, with the three requirements needed to generate a secret and indirect effect – speed, intensity and control – impossible to maintain at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this changing pattern of cyber research points towards, and the reality of which is relevant to the wider issue of state threats, is a recent critical change in tone. While much of the initial work on all these subjects stressed their novelty and importance, recent thinking has taken a more interrogative attitude. Several studies, such as the work of political scientist Thomas Rid, have raised questions about the strategic effectiveness and impact of various types of covert and clandestine actions, especially cyber attacks and information operations. Taking a similarly sceptical perspective, military historian Sir Lawrence Freedman has noted that the central issue “with all new developments” has been whether they “get a decisive result in a conflict or just [provide] another means of engaging in a dispute without necessarily being able to bring it to a conclusion” – the answer to which question he himself has doubts over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, several other contemporary scholars have suggested reframing the question of effectiveness using criteria other than damage caused or political change triggered. Political scientist Austin Carson, for example, has emphasised that covert action should be seen not only as a means of achieving tangible results, but also of communicating intent and will – “signaling” – to both opponent states and allies alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;24-conclusion&quot;&gt;2.4. Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the close of the section, it is clear that the question of how to define the area of hostile state activities has proved difficult for policymakers and researchers alike. Very little seems to fit neatly within pre-existing conceptual boundaries; even after careful exploration and analysis, some ambiguity cannot be avoided. However, we are probably in a less uncertain place now than Judge Stewart, forced purely to rely on gut instinct to define state threats. State threats do have coherence as a concept, as hostile actions by states and their partners with political intent to harm other states. They are executed outside or on the edge of international law and practice, and can either be covert, lightly disguised or in some cases overt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without being labelled as “state threats research”, moreover, there is much in the world of academia and policy research that helps us understand the nature of the issue. Despite the heavy skew of much of the literature towards military affairs in near-war scenarios, the study of hybrid warfare and grey zone and liminal conflicts has helped demonstrate various styles of activities ‒ combinative, innovative or ambiguous – that can be just as relevant to peacetime activities of intelligence agencies. Indeed, the current turn in the literature towards a focus on covert action, intelligence contests and persistent engagement shows just this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-the-state-threats-moment&quot;&gt;3. The state threats “moment”?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, as has been stated from the outset, state threats are far from being a new phenomenon. States have undermined their rivals using covert and clandestine means since antiquity. Discussing contemporary cyber attacks, political scientist Thomas Rid has remarked that despite their apparent novel methods, they are simply “sophisticated versions of three activities that are as old as human conflict itself: sabotage, espionage, and subversion”. Despite the end of the Cold War, states that were then apparently friendly continued to undertake hostile acts against one another throughout the 1990s and the early 21st century. China was caught seeking to influence Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign through secret donations, 20 years before Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, while Russian operatives assassinated Putin critic Alexander Litvinenko in London in November 2006, only six years into the rule of Vladimir Putin. Hybrid or grey zone methods are far from new either. “Any notion that only in the late twentieth century fluid, state, non-state or para-state actors were mixing conventional and unconventional forces and methods as well as espionage, sabotage, criminality, propaganda and subversion is patently untrue”, writes Galeotti. Continuity, more than change, seems to be the rule, so an obvious question arises: why are state threats so important now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the national security sphere, it is rare for any type of threat to disappear completely; there is indeed a traceable line of ongoing state threats activity from the end of the Cold War through to today. However, the available evidence does suggest that state threats have grown both in absolute and relative terms in recent years. In the first instance, the volume, range and daring of hostile acts appear to have grown, although it has taken Western governments time to see this. Major shocks – such as Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale invasion of the Ukraine in February – have been needed to force fundamental re-evaluations of long-lasting policy paradigms. In the second, state threats have begun to pose a comparatively greater challenge to Western national security than the previous main threat of international Islamist terrorism, which, while far from disappearing, has become less focused and lethal than in the wake of the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;31-an-upward-trend&quot;&gt;3.1. An upward trend&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is currently no state threats database on all qualifying hostile state acts comparable to the Global Terrorism Database, which seeks to list all terrorist activities on a global scale. However, relevant, open source, quantitative proxy data on rising state hostile activities is available, especially from the cyber sphere. The Modern War Institute at West Point’s Dyadic Cyber Incident Dataset (DCID), which collates state-to-state cyber operations, has shown an upward if erratic trend in such operations over the first two decades of the 21st century. Figure 1 shows that trend according to its data sets 1.5, and the more recently updated 2.0, which runs to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0V1iHeA.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Frequency of state-versus-state cyber incidents over time (2000-20).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DCID indicates that there are four leading perpetrators of cyber attacks (China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, in that order), which together are responsible for 82% of all attacks over the 20-year period. Data from the Council on Foreign Relations Cyber Operations Tracker also indicates that 77% of incidents in its dataset (starting in 2005) were initiated by one of these four countries. Separate work on disinformation by the Oxford Internet Institute has also demonstrated the growing role of government-linked cyber actors in online information operations, with the number of national governments involved rising from 70 to 81 countries between 2019 and 2020. Of these, the countries with the greatest capacities include Russia, China and Iran, and in the Western world, the US, UK, Australia and Ukraine. Other major regional players include: Egypt, Israel, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the Middle East; India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Vietnam and the Philippines in the Asia-Pacific region; and Venezuela in South America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualitative assessments of a wider range of activities by intelligence agencies in various European and Five Eyes Countries indicate a similar picture too, with Russia, China and Iran mentioned most consistently as the main troublemakers. Of these, Western governments see China and Russia as the most concerning states, although the style and magnitude of the threat they pose varies. UK and US intelligence officials have compared Russian hostility to bursts of bad weather, whereas Chinese hostile behaviours have been described as being more pervasive and difficult to detect, somewhat like climate change. Most Western states also see North Korea as a threat, but primarily because of its cyber activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with an apparently increasing volume of hostile acts, moreover, observers have noted a rising tempo and ambition in the actions of perpetrators. The most notable player, across numerous fields, has been Russia. According to the assessment of Jakub Kalensky, deputy director of Hybrid Influence at the Hybrid CoE, who was interviewed for this project, “Russian information operations were in a relative hiatus in the 2010s”, but they “escalated massively following the Euromaidan Revolution [in Ukraine] in November 2013, and never stopped”. Russian activities have also become more geographically ambitious, spreading beyond the former Soviet states of Russia’s near abroad to the wider European continent and North America. Russia expert Keir Giles has reflected that, “since 2014, Moscow has become increasingly willing to reach into Western countries and do direct harm, through sabotage, murders and assassinations, undisguised electronic warfare, false-flag cyber attacks and more”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China too has apparently accelerated the pace of its hostile activities. Christopher Wray, the director of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), stated in 2020 that the agency was investigating over 2,500 China-linked cases, over half of all the agency’s live counter-intelligence cases. Wray also stated that the FBI had seen a 1,300% increase in Chinese economic espionage over the previous decade. Nicolas Eftiamides, a retired senior government official, China specialist and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, who maintains a database of Chinese espionage and covert activity reports, has also identified a significant increase in activity in the past two decades, along with an improvement in Chinese tradecraft since 2016. With greater scale and capability has come greater ambition too, with renewed Chinese efforts at electoral subversion and malign political influence in the US and among its allies, such as Canada, Australia, the UK, France, Germany and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most hostile activity is initiated and managed solo by one state, there are also some indications of collaboration on hostile acts. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, there have been increasing indications of Chinese and Russian state-linked social media accounts working together on disinformation. Regimes friendly to Russia and Iran, such as Venezuela under the presidencies of Hugo Chavez and Nicolás Maduro, have also allegedly been involved in a variety of hostile acts, including overseas electoral interference, transnational repression of dissent and illicit narcotics trafficking with terrorist groups. One of the most blatantly hostile of Russia’s associates has been the regime of President Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus; among other activities, Belarus has encouraged illegal migration across its borders into Poland, and in May 2021 conducted an act of air piracy, forcing a Ryanair flight to land in Minsk to detain a Belarusian dissident, Roman Protasevich, and his partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the main revisionist states and their associates, moreover, are middle powers, loosely defined as states that sit below global powers such as the US, China and Russia in terms of political, economic or military power and influence. Middle powers exist both in the developed and developing worlds, but most of those in the developed world are tied into Western economic and security structures. There is certainly a history of Western or Western-aligned middle powers using covert and clandestine acts, not the least the UK. However, constrained as they are by a variety of liberal democratic checks and balances, and largely tied into Western security arrangements, they do not appear to be major contemporary users of hostile action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certainly, many emerging middle powers have used covert and clandestine measures against their rivals for some time, and any Western ignorance of their activities seems more likely to result from a lack of past scholarly interest, than their absence in fact. However, the evidence of recent years is that several emerging middle powers have been using covert tools as forms of statecraft with growing regularity. Probably the most active has been Turkiye, under the leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, which the German government rates as being as problematic for internal German affairs as Russia, China and Iran. Turkiye has been accused, in particular, of using violence against critics overseas, especially Kurdish independence activists and those linked to the religious Gülen movement, which mounted an unsuccessful coup attempt against President Erdoğan in July 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has also been highly active in the covert world, most infamously with the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia’s Turkish embassy in October 2018. But Saudi Arabia also has a record of offensive cyber operations, online disinformation campaigns and political interference overseas; in this, it is also joined by other Middle Eastern powers such as the UAE and Qatar. Cyber expert Ben Buchanan writes that in recent years, the UAE and Qatar have become engaged in a relentless online battle of “tit for tat hack-and-leak operations”, with each seeking to embarrass the other politically with accusations of support for Islamist extremist terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle powers in other regions have also increasingly used hostile acts against bordering states and rivals. In South Asia, long-time rivals India and Pakistan have been engaged in a covert (and sometimes overt) battle for dominance in the region, which has included cross-border support for terrorism and assassinations, and has more recently spilled into the realm of cyber operations and online disinformation. Both countries have also begun to reach further afield, moreover, allegedly meddling in Canadian elections; and in the case of India, mounting a campaign of assassinations against Sikh separatist leaders living in North America. Despite the underlying domestic and regional causes of this behaviour, it appears that some middle powers are increasingly willing to play them out on the global stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;32-changing-perceptions&quot;&gt;3.2. Changing perceptions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing evidence of state-led hostile acts has played a central role in the greater recognition of the importance of the issue, but it has not been the only reason behind the shift. In fact, there has been something of a lag between the evidence of rising state threats and Western governments’ reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important barrier to accepting the evidence of growing state threats has been the belief that the era of globalisation had fundamentally changed the nature of international politics. After the end of the Cold War, some Western political scientists argued that global economic integration was leading to political liberalisation, and from there, to a period of settled democratic peace. Russia was increasingly perceived as a “normal country”, transitioning from authoritarianism to a liberal, free market democracy. China too, despite retaining a communist regime, was seen in a similar way: as an authoritarian state that was inching towards freedom by way of liberal economics. President Bill Clinton in March 2000 welcomed the prospect of China’s accession to the World Trade Organization, holding out the vision of a state transformed by prosperity; “the more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of the people”, he promised, “and when individuals have the power not just to dream, but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only a small number of states, such as Iran and North Korea, were seen as holdouts against this new world, and occasional tensions with Russia and China were simply discounted as bumps in the road; historian John Lough has shown how this dynamic played out between Germany and Russia in the 1990s and the early 21st century, with Berlin moving to ignore Russia’s democratic backsliding and abuse of human rights out of a combination of historic guilt, idealism and economic self-interest. The years up to 2014 were, Lough concludes, ones of wishful thinking about Russia, where Western governments were willing to ignore an “increasing divergence between the Russia they wished to see and the Russia they were dealing with”. Western countries turned an even more forgiving eye on Chinese domestic repression and aggressive diplomacy, motivated by a desire to buy cheap Chinese goods and export to Chinese markets, especially major European trading countries such as Germany. For Western leaders, profit could afford to come before principle, because the expected future outcomes of lasting peace and prosperity would outweigh any immediate strategic or ethical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An accumulation of evidence about aggressive Russian and Chinese behaviours, both overt and covert, slowly started to erode these attitudes over the first decade of the 21st century, but it took a series of decisive and shocking events to undermine the previous Western view. For Russia, key inflection points were its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale invasion of the Ukraine in February 2022, which led to Russia’s increasing isolation from its Western partners, and escalating economic and financial sanctions. With these dramatic events, it became ever more difficult for Western governments to re-interpret Russian actions in a forgivable light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For China, the shift has been slower and more guarded. The US and other Western countries have become increasingly concerned about how China’s integration into the global economy has allowed it to penetrate Western businesses, CNI, and scientific and technological research. They have also struggled to downplay the more bellicose, nationalistic and anti-Western rhetoric of President Xi Jinping since his rise to power in 2012‒13, and to ignore Chinese domestic repression, or intimidation of regional neighbours including Taiwan and the Philippines. But while there have been fewer dramatic “wake-up calls” than with Russia, China has increasingly raised doubts in Western governments about its trustworthiness and intentions since the Covid-19 pandemic. China’s unwillingness to cooperate with an international enquiry into the origins of the pandemic brought substantial Western criticism, as has its ongoing public support for Russia since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the public revelation of its extensive espionage and malign influence operations in European and anglophone countries. While the US and its allies have tried to retain varying degrees of engagement with China in the face of these difficulties, Western officials and observers have become increasingly anxious about China’s ultimate intentions, as well as the role it might play in leading an anti-Western axis that also includes Russia, Iran and North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;33-the-changing-face-of-terrorism&quot;&gt;3.3. The changing face of terrorism&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threats do not arise in a vacuum, however. For a threat to gain salience depends on its relative position vis-à-vis other potential challenges. One of the additional factors that explains the growing salience of state threats now has been the comparative change in the profile of terrorism, which has been one of the West’s primary national security concerns of the past two decades. After the spectacular shocks of 9/11, Western national security strategies squarely focused on tackling the Islamist extremist threat: firstly, Al-Qaeda and its regional affiliates; then from the mid-2010s, as Al-Qaeda’s operational effectiveness declined, IS, which dominated large swathes of Syria and Iraq for several years, and mounted dramatic attacks in Europe, such as in November 2015 in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in the past five years the character of the threat from Islamist extremism has changed, if not disappeared. Al-Qaeda, IS and their affiliates remain important actors in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, Afghanistan and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. Indeed, recent cases have indicated that IS affiliate Islamic State-Khorasan Province has the capability to mount major operations, launching a successful attack on a Moscow concert hall in March 2024, and planning one on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna in August 2024, that was prevented by the concert’s cancellation. However, in recent years, Islamist extremist groups and networks have not demonstrated an operational capability within or against Western states comparable to that seen in the early 2000s or mid-2010s. On the contrary, most recent attacks have been limited to lone actor-or small cell operations of relatively low lethality, partly contained by Western intelligence agencies’ successful surveillance and disruption efforts over the past decade. Moreover, even though Western states have become more anxious about the threat from right-wing terrorists, the extreme right has not been able to mount major domestic campaigns comparable to past Islamist extremist operations, and has largely remained limited to self-financed attacks conducted by lone-actors. In this context of a reduced or at least modulated terrorist threat, Western governments have enjoyed greater policy space in which to focus on threats from other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;34-vulnerabilities-and-capabilities&quot;&gt;3.4. Vulnerabilities and capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further aspect to answering the question “Why now?” is a changing perception of Western vulnerabilities. At the height of the international terrorist threat, experts emphasised how vulnerable open Western societies were to terrorism, and how increasingly easy it was for terrorists to cause disproportionate damage with new technologies such as end-to-end encryption, commercial drones and 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These vulnerabilities have not gone away with the relative decline of the terrorist challenge. Security experts continue to argue that the open character of Western countries makes it a perfect target, because key aspects of security are outsourced to the private sector; much CNI sit in private hands, for example, where the drive to keep down costs and maximise profits can reduce security and resilience measures to tick-box compliance rather than active risk management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks are arguably greater now, moreover, because state actors have significantly greater resources than terrorists, and many more avenues to cause trouble given Western economic dependencies. Russia, China and other countries with authoritarian or autocratic systems have developed deeply embedded links into Western financial systems, economies and societies. Some of these, such as China’s investments in major ports, are highly strategic and vulnerable to abuse. The experience of the pandemic and the economic effects of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine have made it apparent how vulnerable supply chains and energy and communications infrastructures are to disruption, and Western policymakers and analysts are thus clearly worried about the extent to which hostile state actors might exploit these in the future. In interview, Ragnar Ingibergsson, a former senior analyst of economic hybrid threats at Hybrid CoE, commented, “liberal societies are at risk by their very nature” because “their fundamental ethos is openness”. Facing well-resourced and implacable adversaries that are willing to abuse this openness, he noted, such societies are “at an immediate disadvantage”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;35-conclusion&quot;&gt;3.5. Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current challenge of state threats seems to echo past periods of intense interstate competition that many assumed had passed with the end of the Cold War. This might lead scholars who take a critical perspective on security and international relations to wonder whether state threats are an empirical reality, or another instance of the rhetorical “securitisation” or inflation of pre-existing policy issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even a basic survey demonstrates that there are genuine grounds for concern about the growth of hostile state activities. There is a “there” there; the current prominence of state threats is not just the result of national security establishments and analytic communities creating a new problem or casting around for a new threat to tackle for a lack of alternatives. Changing perceptions of the relative intensity of terrorism have helped create policy space to address state threats, but they have not created the issue in itself. Indeed, the rising importance of state threats has created resource problems for Western intelligence agencies, which have an ongoing responsibility to keep terrorism in check. State threats are not a problem of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From another critical perspective, it might also be asked whether we can truly say state threats are growing, especially when it is clear that governments have not been focusing on the issue for some time. After all, we do not know what we do not know. Nevertheless, where we have data series over time ‒ for example, in the field of state-linked cyber activity ‒ there does appear to have been an increase in state threats over the past two decades. It would be counterintuitive to discount this evidence, even if we accept that the gradient of rise has not necessarily been steep or steady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while accepting there are continuities between past and present state threats, the character of the current situation differs from the past three decades in many ways. The growing range and ambition of hostile state activity, much of it now technologically enabled, goes far beyond what was experienced in the 1990s and the early years of the 21st century. It also goes beyond the obvious analogue of the Cold War era, both in terms of the range of state actors involved and the environment in which the activity is taking place. Simply stating that state threats will “always be with us” fails to recognise that the phenomenon, like any other social activity – war, education, travel and so on – can take on a radically different scale and character over time, despite retaining its most fundamental qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-state-threats-in-practice&quot;&gt;4. State threats in practice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous section sought to understand the reasons why state threats are an issue of concern now; this section seeks to provide a map or anatomy of state threats in practice. Rising volumes of cyber attacks and disinformation efforts have been noted as two indicators of increased state-on-state hostility; but these two areas of activity, while important, are far from being the only ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An attractive way to map out the current scope of state threats would be through a quantitative study. However, given the current patchy state of the quantitative data landscape it is a vast undertaking that is well beyond the scope of this project. This section thus seeks to provide a qualitative outline of the key areas of hostile activity, looking at the methods or vectors of hostile action, and highlighting the common targets and purposes behind attacks. To the extent possible for mostly secret activities, the section looks at the mechanics behind hostile acts, from points of initiation to operational execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;41-overt-measures&quot;&gt;4.1. Overt measures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most overt hostile acts are undertaken by state actors with the explicit intention of intimidating other states, often to follow a line of action they otherwise would not. The most basic form is abuse of diplomacy, turning diplomatic channels into a means of delivering threats, rather than a means of dialogue. China, for example, has become infamous for its “wolf warrior diplomacy”, which combines performative public anger and threats of vague consequences when a state goes against China’s will. For example, Gui Congyou, the Chinese ambassador to Sweden, in November 2019 expressed his government’s anger at the awarding of a major writing prize to Hong Kongese-Swedish dissident Gui Minhai: “We treat our friends with fine wine, but for our enemies we got shotguns”, he told a Swedish journalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside gangster-style diplomacy, some states have become ready users of what Galeotti has described as “heavy-metal diplomacy”, such as launching aggressive military exercises or tests, or shadowing or harassing other states’ military or civilian vehicles, especially at sea or in the air. These actions go well beyond the bounds of commonly agreed military practice, and can lead to direct incursions into other states’ sovereign territory. Russian aircraft and naval vessels regularly violate Western countries’ airspace and domestic waters, and in recent years Russia has taken to jamming the satellite-based global positioning system in both the Baltic Sea and Black Sea regions, causing major problems for civilian aircraft. Russia has also attempted the surreptitious movement of border markers, termed “borderisation” by those who have suffered it on land in Georgia. Russia tried this technique again in May 2024, this time testing the maritime borders of Estonia by removing floating markers in the Narva river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Russians are among the most prolific users of heavy metal diplomacy, they are far from being alone. China’s Maritime Militia – technically part of the PLA, but often using civilian resources – has harassed its neighbours’ military and civilian vessels in the disputed waters of the South and East China Seas, while also building new “islets” to provide justification for the subtle shifting of international maritime boundaries. Other states have gone as far as acts of near piracy, such as Belarus’s forced landing of a civilian aircraft in May 2021 or Iran’s boarding of Western commercial vessels in the Persian Gulf in 2019, including the seizure of the Stena Impero, a ship with Swedish owners, registered in the UK, as it was passing through the Straits of Hormuz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combination with the tools of diplomatic and military menace, several states have also used economic and financial coercion, applied indirectly through business and commercial interests. Russian state-owned oil and gas firms have continuously used access to vital energy supplies to coerce and cajole the governments of former countries of the Soviet Union and eastern European states in the past three decades. China, meanwhile, has become adept at manipulating Western companies’ access to the Chinese market for political purposes, with a technique known as yi shang bi zheng (“using business to pressure government”). For example, Chinese officials encouraged Börje Ekholm, chief executive of Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson, a firm with significant Chinese interests, to lobby the Swedish government in 2020 to drop a proposed public sector ban on Chinese technology firm Huawei. China has also made widespread strategic investments in the communications and logistical infrastructures of European, African, Middle Eastern and Asian countries, making them economically dependent on Beijing’s continued goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further openly used tactic, though more a signal of displeasure than a direct act of coercion, is withdrawal from important international agreements. A recent example is the withdrawal of Russian and Chinese support for the effective implementation of UN sanctions on North Korea, especially the failure to extend the mandate of the UN Panel of Experts in March 2024. Further examples also include pointed negligence in areas of previous international cooperation, such as tackling international organised crime. Since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, for example, Russia has made it easier to import counterfeit Western luxury goods and in February 2024 withdrew from the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, a Council of Europe initiative dedicated to criminalising corrupt practices. Belarus has taken a similar course, legalising piracy of audio-visual content and software in January 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side of these acts of overt coercion, there have been attempts to build constituencies of political and public support in states likely to oppose revisionist agendas. For obvious reasons of simplicity and efficiency of effort, such attempts typically begin with a process of cultivating elites, seeking to create personal bonds and relationships that can be leveraged at a later date. Extending the meaning of a term that comes originally from development literature about the control of resources and power by domestic elites, observers have described this process as a form of external “elite capture”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and China have worked hard to build close and open relationships with sympathetic Western politicians, business leaders, journalists and cultural figures. The Russian approach has been particularly brazen, with several Western leaders offered directorships in Russian companies and other benefits in return for support for Russia. In Germany, this process has been described as “Schroederisation”, which Galeotti characterises as “the individual-by-individual corruption of another country’s politics in a wholly legal (if ethically problematic) way”. The name, of course, comes from the example of former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who developed a lucrative working relationship with Russian gas producer Gazprom after leaving office in 2005, and has remained one of President Putin’s most vocal Western supporters ever since. Schroeder has not been the only one to take Putin’s rouble, moreover, and other European politicians, such as former foreign minister of Austria Karin Kneissl, and former prime minister of France François Fillon, have also taken positions with Russian firms after leaving office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has followed a similar path to Russia, if not quite so shamelessly. In the words of China expert Elizabeth Economy, China’s aim has been to penetrate “societies and economies … to shape international actors’ political and economic choices in much the same way as it does with domestic actors”. China has a well-developed method for achieving this. According to Stokes and Hsiao, experts on the PLA, Chinese agencies will identify friends to be supported, enemies to be suppressed and those in the middle to be won over. As other China experts highlight, the Chinese seek to do this at both national and local levels of governance in targeted states. The issue is explored further in a discussion of malign influence below (section 4.6.3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Russia and China have also sought to build open relationships with communities and groups on the fringes of power and influence. This process of what might be described as “popular capture” takes place more commonly through connections to overseas ethnic and cultural minorities. Russia, for one, has sought to exploit the dispersal of Russian speakers throughout the countries of the former USSR and eastern Europe, with initiatives such as Russki Mir (“Russian World”), which encourages Russian speakers or descendants of Russians living outside Russia’s borders to see themselves as a distinct community of “compatriots”, with allegiance to the motherland. These efforts to shape a separate identity for citizens of other countries can also be underpinned by material benefits, such as the provision of pensions and passports, as was the case in South Ossetia and Abkhazia in 2007. Georgians described this process as “passportisation”, to go along with the aforementioned process of borderisation. China has also built strong relationships with its diaspora communities throughout the world, using state-backed media and direct engagement between party bodies such as the United Front Work Department (UFWD), and Chinese-heritage business and academic communities. Under the current leadership of the CCP, expatriates and members of the diaspora community are expected to act as unofficial Chinese ambassadors to their host countries ‒ in the words of President Xi, to “tell the China story well”. The implied expectation is that there will be problems for them if they do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other groups that Russia, in particular, looks to are those on the political extremes, especially when elite capture has proved difficult to achieve. Elements within the Putin regime have built close connections with parties of both the far right and the far left in Europe, most notably those of Marine Le Pen in France, Alice Weidel and Sahra Wagenknecht in Germany, and Matteo Salvini in Italy. Le Pen’s party, then named the Front National, received a loan of €9.4 million from a Russian bank in 2014, while more recently, the Prague-based Voice of Europe media outlet was allegedly used to channel cash to representatives of the far right in Europe. Russia has also provided platforms for foreign radicals and populists on state-connected TV channels, such as Russia Today, as well promoting narratives likely to appeal to disaffected political constituencies in foreign countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further method currently in use is the overt suppression of anti-regime dissent overseas, often described as “transnational repression”. One of its most widely used techniques is the abuse of legitimate legal processes to target dissent and criticism, one aspect of a wider phenomenon also known as “lawfare”, a term coined in a military context by former US air force general Charles Dunlap to mean “the use of law as a weapon of war”. A common tactic is the abuse of Red Notices, which require the 195 member agencies of the Interpol international police network to issue warrants for arrest against those named. These notices are intended to prevent suspected criminals escaping justice, but some states have misused them to harass domestic dissidents based overseas, often spuriously labelling them as terrorists. China, for example, has used the tool to try to extradite dissidents such as Dolkun Isa, the president of the World Uyghur Congress, while Russia has sought to detain not only its own dissidents, but also foreign critics such as British-US financier Sir Bill Browder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and Russia have also used their own domestic legal systems to target dual-nationality dissidents with charges of espionage or political offences, as seen in the ongoing case against Chinese-Australian writer Yang Hengjun and that of recently released Russian-British journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza. A further aspect of lawfare used by Russia has been to bring civil cases in foreign courts that target journalists writing about the Russian regime, referred to as Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation (SLAPP). Chinese diplomats have also mixed a wolf warrior approach into their attempts at transnational repression within foreign civil societies, making coercive threats against Western universities that have sought to exercise their academic freedom by offering platforms to critics of Chinese policy, such as pro-Tibetan or pro-Uyghur activists, especially when those universities have enjoyed significant financial and research links with Chinese institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key point to recall about these overt measures (summarised in Table 2), is their wider contextual relationship to other more covert forms of state threats. Most importantly, they play a role in creating and shaping environments in which it is easier for states to use nefarious activities if they choose to do so. Cases in point are elite and popular capture, which can easily slide from what appear to be open and legitimate relationships to hidden corruption. As China expert Alex Joske suggests, the Chinese approach of “making friends and watching what happens” is effectively a form of grooming, where the Chinese “friend” creates a credit balance of favours done, such as providing political access and business opportunities, which can then be drawn upon later. The exploitation of expatriates and members of diaspora communities as unofficial ambassadors in their host or home countries also fosters groups of what might later become operatives available for espionage, sabotage or subversive activities. While Xi looks to overseas Chinese to tell the country’s story, he has also said he expects them to be its “eyes and ears” as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tcGOvPZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 2: Summary of overt methods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;42-covert-and-clandestine-measures&quot;&gt;4.2. Covert and clandestine measures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, the terms “clandestine” and “covert” – though often used interchangeably – have different meanings. In clandestine acts, the intention is to hide both the actor and the action. In covert acts, the aim is to hide only the actor, making deniability the key requirement. However, for ease of use, this paper will use both words interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, it should be noted that some intelligence scholars now question how appropriate the word covert really is for the activities being described. Cormac and Aldrich have highlighted that much contemporary covert activity is conducted with such flagrance that the perpetrators almost seem to be begging to be identified. In such cases, “implausibly deniable” acts might reflect a lack of professionalism, but could also be intended to send “a message” to the target or potential targets. While accepting the principle behind the point, however, this paper will continue to use the word covert, noting that in some instances levels of cover are light to the point of being diaphanous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, the following sections look at the evidence on contemporary covert and clandestine activity within the framework of the well-known categories noted in the discussion of definitions in section 2. They are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Espionage&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ the secret collection of sensitive materials held by others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intimidation&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ against people, whether individually or in groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabotage&lt;/strong&gt; – the intentional damage, destruction of assets or processes, including preparation for sabotage, or an intentional action to take advantage of target vulnerabilities for future exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subversion&lt;/strong&gt; – covert attempts to shape the overall political environment within another state in a way favourable to the perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malign influence&lt;/strong&gt; – covert attempts to influence the views and decisions of targeted elites in a way favourable to the perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsoring internal opponents&lt;/strong&gt; – covert attempts to support groups that actively oppose or challenge a targeted state using disruptive or violent means.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orchestrating regime change&lt;/strong&gt; – covert attempts to interfere directly in electoral processes or overthrow a targeted government by other means.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meaning of these terms is fairly well understood, but there is a certain amount of fuzziness in how various scholars and practitioners define them. For example, the term subversion has been applied extremely broadly by some to describe all “indirect and secret” state actions in the space between diplomacy and war, or “external interference in a nation’s affairs to overthrow the existing order … on terms favourable to the aggressor”. Other studies – including this paper – see subversion more narrowly, as covert exploitation of the information environment of another state, to induce political effects favourable to the perpetrator. Although it is important to be clear about terms, there is always a risk of “good faith” misunderstandings about the meanings of such ambiguous words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further aspect of this issue is that even when terms are clearly defined, different categories are closely coupled to, overlap with or slide into one another. Espionage, for example is not deemed a covert activity by scholars of the field. However, it is the principal foundation of all forms of (successful) covert action. If one does not know the whereabouts of a target, they cannot be intimidated. If one does not already know the layout of a sensitive building, installation, computer system and so on, it is difficult to do targeted damage. If one does not understand the political environment, political structures or internal divisions within a state, it is difficult to manipulate its affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it is arguable that some forms of covert action can have dual or even multiple levels of effect. Revelations of successful espionage, intimidation of dissidents or media figures, or acts of sabotage against a given state can send negative and thus subversive messages about the capacity of that state to cope with such hostile activity, and might influence the views and morale of its decision-makers. Covert activities can also be used in concert (subversion and malign influence are natural bedfellows); and other types of action, if successful, can provide opportunities to undertake new operations. Civil disturbances encouraged from abroad can provide useful grist for further subversive information operations; and lessons and intelligence derived from an act of sabotage can be used to prepare new operations, or be provided to domestic groups with anti-state agendas and a willingness to use violent means. The possibilities are numerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;43-espionage&quot;&gt;4.3. Espionage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the dark arts, espionage is probably the most comprehensible and acceptable in Western eyes. Arguably, the ubiquity of spying throughout history and between countries of all types – including those of the West – makes it an odd bedfellow among other hostile activities listed. When China stole officials’ personnel data from over 22 million records in the US government’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 2015, General Michael Hayden, former head of the National Security Agency (NSA) and CIA, remarked that what China had done was perfectly legitimate. Furthermore, he said he would have even ordered a similar hack himself if it were against China. The US government was also initially outraged at the hack of an update to business software company SolarWinds’ Orion supply chain management system by Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) in 2020, fearing it to be a potential act of sabotage. But after careful assessment, both the US government and outside observers concluded it was a less concerning case of espionage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because espionage is familiar to the West, however, does not necessarily mean it sits within the bounds of legitimate statecraft; legal scholars have noted how the paucity of international law on peacetime espionage makes the activity difficult to classify as “legal”. Nonetheless, despite limited guidance in written and case law, most scholars see peacetime spying as permissible where it helps states understand the behaviour of other governments and provides early warning of potential attempts to break international law. The emphasis here, then, is on the legality of spying on reasonable grounds of security, suggesting that principles of necessity and proportionality apply. It is because of this divide between broadly acceptable espionage – undertaken for purposes on diplomacy, security and maintaining peace – and less justifiable espionage – undertaken for gain, as a prelude to mischief-making or even just for the sake of it – that much of the behaviour of the leading revisionist states is so problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the magnitude and range of contemporary spying by China and Russia seem high by historic standards. Ken McCallum, director general of MI5, has described China’s espionage campaign as “epic”. As the OPM hack indicates, much of this explosion of activity comes from the development of cyber hacking, which enables the collection of bulk data on a vast scale, and for its own sake; according to intelligence historian Calder Walton, China follows a “collect and store now, decrypt later” strategy. It is notable that the largest proportion of what are described as cyber operations are not disruptive attacks as such, but data collection through cyber means; the DCID database indicates, for example, that 61% of the state-backed cyber attacks registered were primarily data thefts, rather than acts of sabotage. Data mining of social media has also provided a vast reserve of openly accessible personal information that is relatively easy for states to collect. US agencies have been concerned, for example, that China has been scraping sites such as LinkedIn to collect data and cultivate contacts, and using platforms such as TikTok to surveil US military staff in US bases across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant amount of this cyber-enabled espionage has been devoted to gathering information on traditional and ‒ to Western eyes ‒ legitimate targets, such as the military, intelligence agencies, government departments, legislatures, and other organs of governance and politics. The Russian Military Intelligence Service (GU, more commonly known by its historic title, GRU) is believed to have been especially prolific in this regard. One of the GRU’s units, known within the cyber community as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 28, or more colloquially as “Fancy Bear”, has undertaken many major politically focused espionage hacks, including an attack on the German Reichstag in May 2015 that stole 16 gigabytes of data from 14 elected representatives, including then-chancellor Angela Merkel, and the notorious penetration of the Democratic National Committee (DNC)’s systems in the US in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the aperture of anti-Western cyber espionage has widened much further in recent years too, encompassing targets in non-state or government-related areas. US officials have taken particular issue with what they claim to be China’s theft of a huge chunk of US intellectual property (IP); according to the US Intellectual Property Commission, IP thefts cost the US between US$225 billion and US$600 billion annually, with China the primary perpetrator. In a further step beyond espionage norms, China has also sought to collect data on private citizens of target countries, not only through open source intelligence on social media, but through hacks of a variety of businesses and civil society institutions. For example, China was believed to have covertly acquired confidential credit data on over 150 million US citizens from credit agency Equifax in 2017. Cyber industry reports also suggest that Chinese APTs have targeted Indian law enforcement, media and the country’s national identity database. Despite China’s apparent primary focus on collecting information, moreover, it is becoming increasingly unclear whether certain hacks, especially recent penetrations of Western CNI, are not so much acts of espionage as intentional pre-positioning for future offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing importance of cyber tools in espionage should not detract, however, from the ongoing value of what intelligence professionals term “human intelligence” (HUMINT) to these states. China, Russia and others have continued to exploit human sources within government, military and political circles. Cameron Ortis, formerly of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, was sentenced in February 2024 to 14 years in prison for leaking intelligence material to a transnational money-laundering network with links to Hezbollah and various OCGs. Court documents published after his conviction also indicated that Ortis had been suspected of planning to pass intelligence to Chinese officials. Other recent cases have included Peter Debbins, an officer in the US Army’s Special Forces, who was convicted of providing material to Russian intelligence in 2021; and “Thomas H”, a Bundeswehr (armed forces) officer involved in German military procurement, who had also allegedly worked with the Russians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also continued its aggressive development of a network of overseas individuals ‒ known as “illegals” ‒ providing a cadre of clandestine operatives to supplement declared operatives under diplomatic cover, which have declined in numbers due to recent expulsions by Western governments. A noted trend has been the deployment of Russian nationals under deep cover as Latin Americans, cases of which have recently emerged in a variety of European countries, including Norway and Slovenia. A prominent US case in this vein has been that of Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov, aka Viktor Muller Ferreira, a GRU operative who studied at Johns Hopkins University in the US and Trinity College in Ireland posing as a Brazilian citizen. After completing his education, he secured a job at the International Criminal Court in the Hague, but as the result of an investigation by the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD), he was arrested by Brazilian authorities and sentenced to 15 years in prison for document fraud, a sentence later reduced to five years. He was also indicted in the US in March 2023 for several criminal activities, including acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign power. However, Brazilian courts refused a US extradition request, and have the authorities have stated that Cherkasov will eventually be extradited to Russia, where he is sought on charges of drugs smuggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also sought to work through trusted non-Russian operatives, the outstanding recent example of which is Austrian citizen Jan Marsalek. Marsalek, who worked as chief operating officer of German payments services provider Wirecard, fled to Russia in 2020, after he was alleged to be implicated in a massive fraud at the company. Subsequent media reporting based on intelligence sources suggested that Marsalek had been a GRU operative since the early 2010s, and had been used by Russia to try to infiltrate Austria’s domestic intelligence agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism (BVT), and the Austrian political elite. It also emerged in early 2024 that Marsalek had allegedly undertaken a variety of other tasks for the GRU, including running a network of Bulgarian nationals conducting intelligence activities in the UK, a group which was disrupted by arrests in September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also used human sources to collect intelligence on traditional targets; various recent scandals have emerged in European countries regarding the penetration of leading politicians’ staff by Chinese operatives. China has been adept too at developing contacts under the cover of ostensibly innocent overt influence efforts, especially through Chinese diaspora communities with political links. HUMINT has also played an important role in commercial and academic collection, especially copyright infringement and IP theft, leading to multiple lawsuits against Chinese businesses brought by Western technology firms, including Cisco, Fujitsu, Motorola, T-Mobile and Quintel, and bio-medical giants such as Monsanto Programmes such as China’s “Thousand Talents Plan” have further proved especially useful ways to cultivate and then exploit Western researchers in leading-edge areas of scientific and technological research. Perhaps the most well-known of these cases was Charles Lieber, a Harvard chemist who was arrested in January 2020, and later convicted of lying to US investigators about his Chinese links, and for failing to declare payments of over US$1 million from Chinese institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed later, China also takes a “whole-of-society approach” to collection, with Chinese businesspeople, workers, academics, researchers and students all required to collect commercial, scientific and technological material when based overseas or working with foreign partners. According to FBI investigations in 2020, Chinese researchers apparently unaffiliated to the Chinese state, who had visas to work in the US, were in fact linked to the PLA and tasked to collect material on medical research and software development. In the wake of six people being arrested in the summer of 2020, more than 1,000 Chinese researchers unexpectedly left the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before moving on from espionage, it is important to state that the US and several of its allies are also major spying nations. Agencies such as the CIA, MI6 (the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service) and Israel’s Mossad have impressive HUMINT capabilities and coverage, while the NSA and GCHQ are the world leaders in the collection of electronic communications, known as signals intelligence (SIGINT). As past breaches have indicated, US and UK technical collection capabilities are highly advanced, and critics have raised legitimate questions about how appropriately and legitimately these have been deployed against allies, enemies and domestic targets alike. Critics have noted how Western agencies have also shown an unhelpful habit of repeating past mistakes and excesses. Moreover, while the US and most of its allies generally eschew commercial and non-security related espionage, this is not the case for every Western country or ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, this does not “make them all the same”, or create a direct moral or legal equivalence between Western and revisionist states. While the outcomes have been far from perfect, Western governments have increasingly sought to place the activities of their intelligence agencies on a legal footing, creating checks and balances on their operations, and various forms of institutional oversight, such as the UK’s Investigatory Powers Tribunal. In addition, several Western legislatures have shown a willingness to investigate and address alleged lapses of their own agencies, as happened in US in the 1970s, and more recently, in the US Senate investigation of the alleged involvement of CIA operatives in the torture of Al-Qaeda suspects. In comparison, the agencies of authoritarian states rarely appear to be held publicly accountable for breaching the laws and norms of overseas espionage; when they are criticised, it is more often for corruption or poor performance. While Western agencies are far from being beyond reproach, there is more evidence of them seeking to work within defined legal and ethical frameworks than there is of their opponents doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;44-intimidation&quot;&gt;4.4. Intimidation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the explosion in espionage, there has also been a massive rise in governments’ use of intimidatory tactics against their critics and opponents located overseas. Much of this activity comes from revisionist authoritarian regimes such as China, and to a lesser extent Russia and Iran, but has also emerged from autocratic middle powers in Central Asia and the Middle East, and even democratic states such as Turkiye. As noted in the previous section on overt measures, some of this transnational repression has been out in the open, but much has been covert too, and violent. Historically, the intelligence agencies of the USSR referred to such activities as part of a wider range of ostrye meropriyatii (“sharp measures”) for just this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is legitimate to ask whether attacks on critics based overseas are state threats when they are not necessarily intended as attacks on the states hosting the targeted critics. However, the tools and methods used – often violent – not only put the people and assets of the host state at risk, but also abuse the states’ sovereignty and interests. That these acts are undertaken both knowingly and intentionally means they fall squarely within the definition of state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.4.1. Surveillance and harassment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intimidatory tactics fall along a spectrum of threats, with surveillance as its least threatening expression. At its most basic, this can be physical surveillance, carried out by state operatives, partners or proxies overseas; a recent example is the creation of “unofficial Chinese police stations” in various Western states that host Chinese diaspora communities. But there are limitations on the levels of access that surveillance teams can get to targeted individuals overseas and cyber tools have therefore become increasingly useful for monitoring at a distance. China, in particular, has taken advantage of technological developments. As early as 2009, Operation Aurora, undertaken by a group linked to the PLA, hacked Google, Microsoft and 32 other firms to spy on the email accounts of Chinese dissidents. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, moreover, Chinese agencies used social media apps such as WeChat and TikTok, and online conferencing platforms such as Zoom, to maintain coverage of interactions between those living in China and members of the diaspora. In one instance, a member of Zoom’s China-based research and development team was required to work with the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) and Ministry of Public Security to identify and close meetings in the US that China deemed subversive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, it has been a small step from surveillance to more direct forms of harassment by Chinese agencies, again enabled by technological developments such as voice over internet protocol calls, social media and instant messaging services. Chinese officials have used channels such as WeChat to contact, threaten and intimidate Uyghur and Tibetan expatriates living in Western countries, either directly, or more powerfully through family members still living in China. This technique, known as coercion-by-proxy, is commonly used to gain compliance from anti-regime individuals and groups based overseas. For example, Abdujelil Emet, a Uyghur dissident living in Germany, was phoned by his sister in Xinjiang, who begged him to stop his activism. The menacing consequences for Emet’s family of his failure to comply were also made clear. China is not the only user of the technique, moreover. Iran has used coercion to try to control its diaspora and North Korea has held hostage family members of its own workers sent overseas to generate income. Other states, such as Vietnam, Egypt, UAE, Oman and Turkiye are also alleged to have used the method to blackmail and punish journalists, students, academics, workers and critics living overseas, using vulnerable family members as targets. Coercion-by-proxy also has the potential to be used in more active ways too, with state agencies applying leverage on the home-based families of those living overseas to undertake covert and clandestine activities on the state’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.4.2. Kidnapping&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More direct interference in the freedoms of critics living overseas can follow, including the kidnapping of the most important targets. Again, this is an area in which China has been particularly active, conducting numerous operations against exiled former CCP officials the Xi regime alleges to be corrupt. Xi launched Operation Foxhunt (2014), then Operation Skynet (2015), to identify, locate, capture and repatriate such individuals – voluntarily or otherwise. Chinese operatives have carried out such operations worldwide, both where extradition treaties do – and do not – exist. Walton estimates that over eight years of activity, Chinese authorities targeted more than 9,000 Chinese nationals through these programmes. Despite the trumpeted focus on corruption, however, China has also used similar techniques to target political dissidents and critics. For example, Hong Kong bookseller and Swedish citizen Gui Minhai was kidnapped from Thailand in 2015, before later being put on trial in China and convicted for his involvement in a historic fatal car accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.4.3. Physical attacks and assassinations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the far end of the spectrum of intimidation are physical attacks and assassinations. Here, the Putin regime has had a high international profile, seemingly less disposed to kidnapping its targets than to killing them. Two of the most notorious cases in the past 20 years have happened in the UK. Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officer and Putin critic living in London, died after being poisoned by two former FSB officers with polonium 210, a highly radioactive isotope in November 2016. Former GRU officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who lived in Salisbury, were targeted by two serving GRU officers with the nerve agent Novichok in March 2018. While the Skripals survived, three members of the public were also poisoned, with one later dying. According to Walton, investigative reporting has linked Russian agencies and their partners to many other deaths in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has allegedly undertaken such activities in other European countries too, notably against exiled Chechen rebel leaders. Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a Chechen who fought for the Georgian military during the 2008 Russo-Georgian war, was murdered in Berlin in summer 2019 by hitman Vadim Krasikov. Krasikov was captured and received a life sentence in 2021, but was returned to Russia in a prisoner swap in August 2024. President Putin’s spokesperson subsequently admitted that Krasikov was an FSB employee. Russia may also have begun targeting defectors from the Russian war effort against Ukraine. Maksim Kuzminov, a Russian helicopter pilot who defected to Ukraine in August 2023, was found shot to death by unknown assailants in Spain in February 2024. Although no official allegations were made, media reports suggested that both Spanish and Ukrainian intelligence agencies believed Russian intelligence to be culpable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it remains the most notable example, Russia is not the only user of sharp measures against dissidents based overseas. Within the core group of revisionist states, both Iran and North Korea have sought to assassinate regime critics. According to figures provided by the UK’s Metropolitan Police in February 2023, the police and MI5 foiled 15 plots by Iran to abduct or kill dissidents based in the UK in the preceding two years. Moreover, the UK sanctioned several members of Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Unit 840 in January 2024 for their involvement in ongoing plots against Iranian journalists based in the UK. North Korea too has a history of using violence against overseas exiles. The most recent – and probably the most bizarre – was the murder of Kim Jong Un’s exiled older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, in Kuala Lumpur International Airport in February 2017. The elder Kim was grabbed by two female assailants, one Vietnamese and one Indonesian, who smothered him with a cloth infused with a liquid that turned out to be VX nerve agent. The women later claimed that they had been led to believe that the attack was a harmless prank by a small group of men – likely to have been North Korean intelligence officers – who paid them a small amount of cash in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted, middle powers too have also used harsh repressive techniques overseas. The murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul in October 2018, allegedly on the orders of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, has become a cause célèbre of transnational repression. Turkiye too has become notorious for targeting dissidents and domestic enemies overseas; Turkish intelligence is alleged, for example, to have been behind the shooting of Sakine Cansız, a member of Kurdish terrorist group the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), in Paris in 2013. In Africa, the government of President Paul Kagame in Rwanda is alleged to have been behind the murders of a succession of dissidents and political opponents, including Patrick Karegeya, Rwanda’s former head of intelligence, in a South African hotel in 2013. While Kagame denied involvement in the murder, he has stated he wished Rwanda had done it. In South Asia, India’s intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, is alleged to have conducted a string of assassinations of Islamist militants living in Pakistan between 2020 and 2023. According to US and Canadian officials, India was also behind the murder of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijja in Vancouver in June 2023, as well as a series of plots in North America against other Sikh activists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.4.4. Beyond dissidents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most repressive operations target governments’ domestic opponents overseas. However, there have been examples of China, Iran and Russia also targeting foreign nationals to create political leverage with Western governments. The most common overt technique is the arrest of dual nationals who, work, study or visit those states, usually on espionage charges; a recent case is that of US-British and Irish national Paul Whelan, who was convicted of spying in Moscow in June 2020. Russia also almost routinely harasses critical foreign journalists, with a favoured technique being “doxxing”, which involves publishing an individual’s personal information online. In Putin’s Trolls, Finnish journalist Jessika Aro provides a distressing account of how her investigation into Russian disinformation led her to be targeted with threatening texts and emails, online abuse, character assassination and even false allegations of criminality. Such techniques can also cross into the realm of “live trolling”, in the phrase of another Finnish journalist, Laura Halminen, with critics, their families and associates targeted with graffiti outside their homes, damage to their property and assets, and break-ins where the intruders leave intimidatory “calling cards” such as unflushed toilets and rearranged domestic items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, moreover, a growing body of evidence that Russia has targeted Western politicians and officials with the same techniques it uses against dissidents and critics. Admittedly, some of this has been open and performative. Russia announced an arrest warrant – unlikely ever to be actioned – against Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas in February 2024 for “desecration of historical memory”. However, for more junior officials, Russian behaviour has had much sharper edges. Western diplomats based in Moscow are regularly subject to harassment, including threats to their children and the poisoning of domestic pets. Military personnel posted to various Baltic states as part of NATO deployments have also been targeted and threatened, while Russian backed media outlets have made allegations of child rape against US officers visiting Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More worryingly, a small number of physical attacks against foreign nationals and officials have been planned or actually taken place. Iran has attacked US, Israeli and Saudi diplomats and officials overseas, and North Korea has previously mounted three assassination attempts against presidents of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in 1968, 1974 and 1983. Russia has been more circumspect in this regard, although there are allegations that it has taken extreme measures against significant foreign nationals that have supported the Ukrainian military. Bulgarian businessman Emilian Gebrev, a supplier of arms to Ukraine, was targeted with Novichok in 2015; and media reports in July 2024 suggested that Russian intelligence had plotted to assassinate Armin Papperger, head of Germany’s leading arms manufacturer Rheinmetall. It was also reported in March 2023 that the Wagner Group, Russia’s leading PMC, had issued a US$15 million bounty on Italy’s Minister of Defence Guido Crosetto, after he blamed the group for an increase in illegal migration across the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that Russia has physically targeted some Western diplomats simply for doing their jobs. Since 2017, a growing number of US and Canadian diplomats posted in Cuba, China, Austria and elsewhere, as well as officials within the US itself, have suffered from highly correlated combinations of symptoms that include severe dizziness, migraines, earaches and vertigo – so-called “Havana syndrome”. While there is no clear chain of evidence to link these incidents to Russia, past research by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has suggested that the symptoms are consistent with the use of directed microwave energy pulses, an area in which the USSR is known to have conducted weapons research. While far from being conclusive, a recent joint investigation by Der Spiegel, The Insider and 60 Minutes, broadcast in March 2024, further provided a range of circumstantial evidence that supported the conclusion Havana syndrome was indeed the result of Russian military intelligence activities against Western diplomats and officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.4.5. Terrorism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Violence can be covertly used to intimidate governments and wider societies, as well as groups and individuals: in effect, as state terrorism. The sponsorship of terrorist groups can also help generate an atmosphere of political instability in a targeted state, as discussed below (section 4.8). These different uses are not mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, given terrorism’s negative reputation, its direct use by states is unusual, if not unknown, and convincing examples tend to be more historic than contemporary; North Korean intelligence officers are widely believed to have been behind the bombing of Korea Air Flight 858 in November 1987, and operatives of the regime of Muammar Qadhafi in Libya were accused of being behind the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988. However, some state-conducted terrorist acts still appear to continue. In recent years, the IRGC has allegedly been involved planning attacks against Western, Israeli and Sunni Arab targets in Africa. Following the UAE’s normalisation of relations with Israel in 2020-21, the IRGC allegedly planned attacks against UAE diplomatic missions and staff, including a terrorist attack in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. However, even Iranian state involvement in active terrorism is more often indirect, undertaken through non-state actors. The IRGC works closely with Islamist groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Shia militias in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen, acting as a consistent financial enabler of operational activities. Of these, Hezbollah has been the most important, with Iran acting as the group’s primary external financier over the long term, providing the bulk of its funding each year. With Israel’s successive military strikes on the infrastructures of these groups since October 2023, their financial dependency on Iran is likely to have increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, current evidence does not suggest that Iran has exploited these relationships to mount major terrorist attacks against Western targets, either in the region or in Western countries themselves, in recent years. Indeed, Iran’s involvement with Hezbollah is as intertwined with its sanctions evasion and illicit money-making efforts as terrorism proper. Iran’s associate state in Venezuela also has links to Hezbollah, as did the now defunct regime of Bashar Al-Assad in Syria until its overthrow in December 2024. But here too, evidence suggests that these states’ associations with terrorists have been more linked to commercial and illegal endeavours than terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the other main revisionist states, their relations with terrorist groups are much less apparent than Iran’s, although Russia remains a state of potential interest. Moscow is alleged to have developed operational connections with Hezbollah after deploying forces to Syria in 2015, and to have helped the Taliban sell oil prior to its return to power in Afghanistan in 2021, also offering bounties to Taliban fighters to kill US soldiers. Russian intelligence also appears to have developed links to far-right paramilitary groups in Eastern Europe, and martial arts clubs that follow the systema discipline used by Russian Spetsnaz special forces. Some of these groups are believed to have members who are also officers in local law enforcement agencies and militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible, moreover, that these relationships might have been exploited to stimulate terrorist acts; for instance, Russian intelligence officers are alleged to have tasked the extreme right-wing Russian Imperial Movement to arrange a letter bomb campaign against Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and US diplomats in 2022-23. There are further indications that Russia has started to build links with left-leaning terrorist groups too; recent media reports have suggested that a Lithuanian diplomat working for Russia sought to contact an Irish republican terrorist through an Irish member of the European Parliament (MEP) in November 2021, for reasons unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is undoubtedly some continuity between modern Russia’s interest in terrorist groups, and the ambiguous past relationships of the USSR and Warsaw Pact countries with European leftists and Palestinian nationalists during the Cold War. Nonetheless, evidence of modern Russian state sponsorship of terrorist attacks against Western targets seems limited. Although Russia’s ties to violent non-state actors in the West do appear to be growing, they have not been operationalised as yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, China and North Korea have shown little recent interest in working with terrorists to commit hostile acts; and while India has asserted that China has supported the Maoist Naxalite insurgency against the Indian state in the east of the country since the 1960s, evidence for this claim is thin. But if most revisionist states do not appear eager to sponsor terrorist acts, some middle powers have consistently dabbled in the practice. Elements within Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) have for decades provided operational support and direction to several Kashmiri Islamist extremist groups that have targeted India, such as Jaish-e-Mohammed, Harakat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, and Lashkar-e-Taiba, the last group being the perpetrators of the attacks in Mumbai in November 2008. Other middle powers, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, have also provided passive environments in which Islamist extremist groups have been able to raise funds and organise operations. But again, these relationships do not necessarily equate to the actual use of terrorism as a tool of state policy. Turkiye has also been accused of financing and tasking terrorist groups and militias; however, it does not appear to exploit these relationships to launch “classic” terrorist attacks, more often using them to target individual enemies of the Turkish government overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;45-sabotage&quot;&gt;4.5. Sabotage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are not the only targets, of course. A recent wave of arson against buildings and infrastructure across Europe highlights a revived interest in the use of sabotage – the attempt to destroy, damage or disrupt physical assets and systems for political purposes – as a hostile tactic. However, while physical acts of sabotage continue, it is again notable how the development of technology, and the increasing vulnerability of socially complex open societies, have provided new avenues for hostile activity that create damage in less tangible ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.5.1. Physical sabotage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the 2010s, the peacetime use of physical sabotage went through a relative lull, although there were a handful of examples such as probable Iranian attacks on Saudi oil tankers and several Russia-linked hostile actions in eastern Europe. For example, the GRU unit later believed to have been behind the Salisbury poisonings allegedly blew up an ammunition depot in Bulgaria in November 2011; the depot contained artillery destined for Georgia, which had recently fought a brief war with Russia. The same unit was also alleged to have been behind explosions at a Czech ammunition depot housing weaponry destined for Ukraine in October and December 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as noted above, the volume and cadence of acts of sabotage in Europe appears to have grown in recent years, especially since February 2022. Arson against companies providing supplies for Ukraine has continued, to be sure, with attacks and attempted attacks in the UK, Germany, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia and the Baltic region. But Russia has also now shifted towards attacking a wider range of European targets that have no apparent links to the war in Ukraine, including retail outlets such as Warsaw’s largest shopping centre Marywilska 44, which was destroyed by a massive fire in May 2024. In November, Polish officials also publicly linked Russia to a series of mysterious parcel explosions and fires on flights used by courier companies in Europe; and at the end of December, Finnish authorities said they were investigating the potential sabotage of a sea-bed electricity cable between Finland and Estonia by a Russia-linked tanker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia may also have been laying the groundwork for more dramatic acts of sabotage in the future. Russian companies and citizens have been buying real estate near strategic ports and military installations in Finland for nearly a decade, possibly either as platforms for spying and/or sabotage. Kilcullen has also asserted that, for several years, suspected GRU officers have been “collecting intelligence, conducting reconnaissance, and preparing guerrilla cells and sabotage networks to be activated in the event of conflict” in Scandinavian countries. Russian sabotage preparations might also have spread further afield than Russia’s near neighbours. Irish police arrested suspected Russian intelligence personnel in 2020, who were found mapping fibre-optic cable landing points linking Ireland to under-sea communication cables in the Atlantic Ocean. Western militaries and agencies have also collected intelligence indicating that Russian trawlers and research vehicles have been used to conduct reconnaissance on undersea communications cables in the Baltic and North Seas, intelligence which Russia may now be putting to use. Although China has so far been much less active than Russia in this area, it too appears to have been making similar preparations to target undersea communications cables, with civilian vessels being used to survey strategic areas in the contested waters of the South and East China Seas. The potential involvement of a China-flagged vessel in the disruption of telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea in November 2024 suggests that it may now be willing to take more aggressive action in this regard, and not only in its own interests, but also in those of other revisionist states. However, with the Chinese authorities unwilling to fully cooperate in Swedish authorities’ investigation of the case, it is unclear whether the damage caused was an accident, an intentional Chinese act, or one sponsored by Russia, using a Chinese commercial vessel as cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.5.2. Cyber effects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While physical sabotage continues, however, the growing weapon of choice in the field of sabotage is what has variously been described as “cyber effects”, “offensive cyber” or “cybotage” operations. According to cyber expert Daniel Moore, operations are of one of two types: an event-based attack, usually targeted and time limited; or a clandestine intrusion to establish a presence within a system, which might eventually culminate in an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When attacks occur, they can take a number of forms, using a spectrum of weapons that go from cheap and simple, right through to the highly sophisticated; as Rid describes they range from the equivalent of digital “paintball pistols”, through “to specific but high-potential weaponry” that are more akin to “fire-and-forget” missiles. In terms of ascending sophistication, the most common types of attacks include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denial of service, or distributed denial of service (DDOS)&lt;/strong&gt;, attacks, which bombard a targeted internet site with communications traffic, disrupting its ability to function.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ransomware attacks&lt;/strong&gt;, where software is used to encrypt the data of a system and prevent user access unless a ransom is paid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wiper attacks&lt;/strong&gt;, where software is used to wipe the data in the target system permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulation attacks&lt;/strong&gt;, where malware is introduced into a system to control, disrupt or damage: (a) its cyber assets and infrastructure, such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which control technological and industrial processes; and/or (b) connected physical assets such as factories, energy and water supplies, and transport systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techniques overlap significantly. Smeets notes that the basic methods used to intrude into systems for attacks are the same as those for cyber espionage, making it difficult to determine the purpose of a penetration without more detailed intelligence. In the end, all intrusions, whether intended to collect and observe, or to damage and destroy, need to find points of vulnerability by which an intruder can enter. These “backdoors” include human users’ susceptibility to fraudulent emails to elicit sensitive information or system access, known as “phishing” attacks, or so-called “social engineering”, where hackers use deceptive communication techniques to gain access to systems by building trust with legitimate system users. More worrisome, though, are “zero-day exploits”, software vulnerabilities that are unknown to systems’ owners, which can be used to enter and manipulate systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian state-backed APTs have been prolific users of a range of these types of cyber weapons, with a significant proportion of their efforts targeted at Ukraine and other former Soviet states in the Baltic region and the Caucasus. Prior to February 2022, one of the most disruptive Russian operations was the NotPetya attack in 2017, when Russian hackers used a wiper programme disguised as ransomware to disrupt Ukrainian infrastructure, businesses, financial institutions and government departments. The attack was so effective – and virulent – that it spread to many international businesses, including several Russian firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has not limited itself to attacking near neighbours, however, and boasts a long history of targeting the US and other Western countries. An FBI investigation in the 1990s, Moonlight Maze, revealed a long-term Russian intrusion into US government and military systems. More recently, Russia has begun to exploit its intrusions in the West to cause significant disruption. Russian attacks on the railway systems of Germany, the Czechia and several other eastern European countries in early 2024 caused problems for ticketing and signalling systems, raising the risk of a major rail accident. Evidence has also mounted suggesting that Russia has been preparing for more dangerous attacks in the future. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) indicted four Russian officials, including four FSB officers, in March 2022 for undertaking penetrations of US energy infrastructure, including a nuclear power station in Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While lacking the resources of Russia, Iran has found cyber effects operations particularly useful as a tool of hostile activity, with a significant proportion of attacks directed at local rivals. Saudi Arabia has been a key target. For example, Iran is believed to have conducted a wiper attack in August 2012 against Saudi oil company Aramco, which affected data on 35,000 computers involved in production, shipping and contracts. Known as the Shamoon attack, after the name on the folder into which the malicious code was loaded, it was followed by further similar attacks in 2016 and 2018 against Western oil companies operating in Saudi Arabia. Unsurprisingly, Israel has also been a major target for Iran’s cyber exploits, for example, with attempts to disrupt Israeli water supplies in May 2020. But Iran has roved further afield too, targeting major US banks with DDOS attacks in 2012 and 2013, attempting to penetrate the SCADA systems of a dam in New York in 2013, and conducting a wiper attack on the Sands Casino, owned by US businessman and Israel supporter Sheldon Adelson, in February 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not strictly cybotage, North Korea has also used cyber methods to conduct an ongoing cybercrime campaign to steal and extort currency from businesses, financial institutions and other organisations around the globe, using similar tools and techniques as those deployed in offensive cyber operations. Early North Korean efforts focused on stealing fiat currencies, most notably the partially successful theft of just under US$1 billion from Bangladesh Bank’s account with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in February 2016. This attack became known as the Lazarus Heist, after the nickname of the North Korean APT thought responsible for the exploit, the Lazarus Group. Over the past eight years, however, North Korea has primarily focused on stealing crypto- rather than fiat currencies. According to figures collected by cyber threat intelligence firm Chainalysis, North Korea’s total cryptocurrency haul between 2016 and 2023 was likely to have been over US$4 billion. Some of North Korea’s attacks – given their scale and disruptiveness – were also in effect forms of sabotage as well as criminality. The Lazarus Group exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft’s Windows operating system in May 2017, releasing the WannaCry ransomware “worm”, which self-replicated across machines without any direction, temporarily crippling hundreds of thousands of computers in over 150 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside some of its more idiosyncratic tactics, moreover, North Korea has also used cyber weapons for more straightforward offensive cyber operations against its local rival South Korea. North Korean hackers penetrated a South Korean nuclear power station in December 2014, apparently both to steal information and also to cause public alarm about potential sabotage. More recent forays have seen North Korea deploy malicious code in the systems of South Korean financial institutions, media and defence companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, China’s approach to cyber effects operations has been more cautious than other revisionist states. Political scientist Ron Deibert has argued that Chinese measures in cyberspace have been largely defensive and internally focused, prioritising the creation of the “Great Firewall of China” to prevent Chinese audiences seeing subversive foreign content. In line with Deibert, Lyu Jinghua, an expert on Chinese cyber strategy, has noted that despite an initial interest in cyber effects in the 2000s, Chinese military and intelligence agencies pivoted away from offensive operations after 2010 because of what they perceived to be a poor cost-benefit ratio – a lot of effort for little material gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, other analysts note that China has shown greater willingness to undertake cyber effects operations since 2020. Taiwan has been subject to a heavy barrage of attacks; Taiwanese officials stated in July 2021 that they faced 30 million cyber attacks every month, with about half originating from China. China has also begun to step up activity against its larger regional rivals. Cybersecurity firm Recorded Future reported in February 2021 that a Chinese-state linked actor known as RedEcho had penetrated India’s power grid management structure and placed malicious code within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also targeted the US. Hackers linked to the MSS undertook a massive penetration of Microsoft Exchange email server software in January 2021; while initially an act of espionage, China “propped the doors open” for other malicious state and non-state actors to take advantage of the vulnerability, according to Rachel Noble, the head of the Australian Signals Directorate. This was an unprecedented act, she said, arguing that China had “crossed a line” by aiding and abetting criminals. Since then, cybersecurity firms have noted that Chinese APTs have increasingly moved away from their previously core activity of espionage to deploying malicious code in Western infrastructure systems including energy, utilities and transportation. In December 2023, Brandon Wales, executive director of the US Department of Homeland Security’s CISA, noted increasing numbers of Chinese attempts “to pre-position themselves to be able to disrupt or destroy that critical infrastructure in the event of a conflict”, which was “a significant change from Chinese cyber activity from seven to 10 years ago”. In February 2024, moreover, a group of US agencies and departments including the FBI, NSA and CISA issued an advisory highlighting the activities of the China state-sponsored cyber group known as Volt Typhoon, which they warned was undertaking activities against parts of US CNI that were “not consistent with traditional cyber espionage or intelligence gathering operations” and intended to create “disruptive effects in the event of potential geopolitical tensions and/or military conflicts”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the foregoing discussion, it is important to close this section by stressing that not all cyber effects operations come from revisionist states. Indeed, many middle powers and Western states are highly active in various areas of the cyber sphere. Currently the most active and capable cyber attacker apart from the revisionist powers is the US, which in conjunction with Israel, was behind one of the most celebrated and supposedly successful cyber attacks of the past 20 years, the Stuxnet attack of 2009 against the Iranian nuclear programme. Members of NATO, the EU, Five Eyes and bilateral allies of the US such as South Korea, Japan and the Philippines have also been identified as perpetrators of offensive cyber operations. Although Western cyber effects operations are more likely to be undertaken within tight legal and ethical frameworks than many authoritarian states, it is vital to recognise that they exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.5.3. Weaponising vulnerabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further form of sabotage is the weaponisation of a targeted state’s vulnerabilities. This is most apparent in current efforts by some states to create a systemic overload of Western economies and welfare systems; if DDOS attacks seek to disrupt systems through volume of traffic, systemic overload operations seek to target another state’s political and economic systems by amplifying existing social and economic challenges. The most widely recognised form of systemic overload at present is the enabling of illegal migration, which, as noted previously, can be both an overt and covert state threat. President Erdoğan, President Lukashenko and former leader of Libya Muammar Qadhafi have all threatened European countries with what Qadhafi described as “a human flood”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, however, the opening of the floodgates is typically managed in a semi-overt or semi-covert way. Russia has used loopholes in border regulations with its Scandinavian and Baltic neighbours to increase cross-border movements, such as providing bikes to asylum seekers who would be unable to cross the border on foot. Russian PMC the Wagner Group has also been accused by the Italian government of enabling the Mediterranean crossings of illegal migrants in retaliation for Italy’s support for Ukraine. Belarus is also alleged to have provided migrants with wire-cutters to break through border fences, and has created commercial structures and incentives to support migration from the Middle East to Europe via Belarus. Belarusian authorities might have also enabled OCGs’ human-trafficking activities. One of the notable additional effects of these activities – besides systemic overload – has been to provide further material for anti-Western states to use in subversive information operations (see section 4.6). Not only can state actors create real crises in their targets’ systems with such methods, they also have the potential to create crises of confidence in their targets’ capacity to cope too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of weaponised migration further highlights the important role that crime plays in other forms of current systemic overload. The closeness of some criminal hacking groups to state agencies has led observers to ask whether large-scale fraud and ransomware attacks are not simply permitted by state actors, but actively encouraged. For example, around three-quarters of ransomware attacks in 2021 came from Russian groups, many of which were – intriguingly – located in the same Moscow building as Russia’s Ministry of Digital Development, Signals and Mass Communications. Conti, one of Russia’s most prolific ransomware groups, provided further indications of the nature of the cybercrime-state agency relationship in early 2022, by declaring its allegiance to the Russian state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other forms of criminality are also potentially significant tools for weaponisation. The relationship between states such as Iran, North Korea, Venezuela and the now defunct Assad regime in Syria and the trade in illicit narcotics has been partly noted already. In these cases, state involvement is probably driven more by profit than focused malice, although it seems unlikely any of these states are worried if their activities have a negative effect on their regional opponents or Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more challenging question is the extent to which China might be using the trade in opiate precursors between Asia and the Americas to stoke the epidemic of addictions to highly addictive synthetic opiates such as fentanyl in North America. In the US, politicians have accused China of supporting precursor production for just this purpose. However, it is difficult to demonstrate direct Chinese state sponsorship of the precursor trade with high confidence. Even if some Chinese law enforcement negligence is witting and directed, the growth of the trade has also been enabled by other factors that challenge Chinese society, such as institutional incompetence, limited resources and corruption. Framing fentanyl as a weapon used by China to corrupt the US might make for good headlines, but as yet, evidence to support the contention remains thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside more obvious efforts to weaponise social and economic challenges, there is also the question of the extent to which the revisionist states – in particular, China – might seek to weaponise Western economic dependencies. As noted in section 3.4, long-term globalisation has led many Western economies to sustain their prosperity by relying heavily on Chinese goods, services and markets. Furthermore, the pandemic has shown that Western economies are extremely sensitive to shocks to international supply chains between East Asia and the rest of the world, with fragile, just-in-time logistical processes quickly snarled up. Chinese investment, technology and firms have, moreover, become highly integrated into the global and Western economies, with Chinese companies owning and constructing major ports, and providing communications infrastructure to support the rollout of 5G in many countries. The Belt and Road Initiative and Digital Silk Road have thus helped China become an economic senior partner to many states, giving it a level of access into other countries’ systems and infrastructures that rivals even that of the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would not be a concern to Western governments, of course, if Chinese intentions were completely benign. But analysts have pointed out that for many Western economies, a lot now rests on China’s good graces and Beijing has significant potential power to cause economic disruption if it wishes. China also has a level of integration into global digital systems that could allow it to extend its domestic surveillance state well beyond its borders, thus bolstering other authoritarian regimes and extending China’s own SIGINT capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be sure, and as countries such as Australia have already discovered, China is willing to exploit economic dependencies to exert overt pressure. Other cases also show China covertly taking advantage of its involvement in technology projects; media reports have alleged that China used its direct access to computer systems it built at the headquarters of African Union to collect the organisation’s data surreptitiously between 2012 and 2017. Nonetheless, at present there appear to be relatively little public evidence of coercion or abuse occurring. Sensitive government intelligence might tell a different story, but as yet, it remains untold. Moreover, the evidence of China using its involvement in telecommunications projects to extend its global spying capability or to bolster digital authoritarianism appears relatively limited, at least for now. While therefore accepting the premise that China has the potential to abuse the economic and technological vulnerabilities of the West, there is limited evidence it is doing so ‒ on a large scale, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;46-subversion&quot;&gt;4.6. Subversion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in section 4.2, subversion has been one of the most difficult areas of covert action to conceptualise. However, for the purposes of this paper, it comprises the covert manipulation of the information environment for the political purposes of the perpetrator. The primary targets of subversion are the information-consuming public – whether conceived as a whole, or targeted segments within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First level aims of subversion can include changing views, radicalising opinion, and stimulating or exacerbating disagreements. Second level aims can be to prompt actions, whether that be in public protest, or at the ballot box. In its current manifestations, subversion relies heavily on the use of communications platforms such as social media to reach a wider audience than possible in the past through print and broadcast media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being less visible in its effects than sabotage, the scale and potential growth of subversive activity is difficult to measure. However, despite its low visibility, subversion has become a major preoccupation of Western governments, especially in the wake of Russia’s extensive use of social media and “hack and dump” operations of sensitive information in the 2016 US presidential election. Several Western countries are thus now seeking either to identify past information operations against their political or electoral processes, or to close loopholes to prevent such interference in the future; Canada, for example, is currently undertaking an extensive public inquiry into cases of potential interference in the recent past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exploitation and distribution of information is central to subversion, and terms such as “information warfare” or “information operations” are regularly used to describe such activity. But as Lawrence Freedman has noted, these terms have “two different but easily confused meanings”; the first refers to warfare “designed to disable systems dependent upon flows of information”, whereas the second – more germane in this discussion – refers “to attempts to influence perceptions by affecting the content of information”. According to Sir David Omand, the former Director of GCHQ, that content can be divided into three classes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disinformation&lt;/strong&gt; – intentionally created false information deployed to mislead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misinformation&lt;/strong&gt; – disinformation that is innocently recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malinformation&lt;/strong&gt; – true information never intended for release, but stolen and revealed publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three types of subversive information can be used in multiple ways, including promoting or opposing a particular perspective, aggravating disagreements or simply causing confusion. Subversive information can also come via various channels, as security scholar Andreas Krieg describes: a common starting point is for an “expert” or supposedly trusted source in academia and research, media or culture to introduce suspect information – whether knowingly or not – into public discourse; the information may then be taken up by other experts, reported or discussed through some form of media outlet, and from there recycled and discussed further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bare bones of the process are not much different now than they were 100 years ago, but in their reach and speed information operations have been dramatically amplified and accelerated by the development of new media, new communications technologies and widening online engagement. The pool of genuine experts and journalists looking for comments has grown, providing many more opportunities for information to feed into the media ecosystem. The online world has also provided cover for the activities of fake experts and journalists, simulated think-tanks, government-organised non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and media outlets. Social media accounts can be operated en masse by “troll factories” of real individuals, as well as automated bots, all of whom can be used to seed and orchestrate messages or divisive information. Even though examples of “coordinated inauthentic behaviour” – the manipulation of public debate through the use of networked disinformation assets – can be detected and quashed by social media firms, the take-down process can be slow, allowing operators of inauthentic networks to take evasive action. Quite apart from the behaviour of bad actors, moreover, social media and instant messaging have substantially expanded the ability of information consumers to share and recycle information, whether out of amusement, shock or disgust, thus enabling the bad actors to increase the speed at which subversive information circulates without any effort on their own part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these methods have generated what Krieg has called “weaponized narratives”, based on simulacra of reality, which are increasingly difficult for mainstream media outlets, public figures or the public to identify. Left to try to assess information for themselves, their investigations and discussions help further launder that information through the wider media “echo chamber”, enhancing the subversive effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in so many other areas, Russia has led the way in subversive information. The original Soviet term for such operations was aktivnye meropriyatiya (“active measures”), although Russian intelligence now uses the term meropriyatiya sodeistviya (“support measures”) instead. Either way, the essence of the practice is the same: “to weaken the targeted adversary”, and, as Soviet defector Vasiliy Mitrokhin described, “to create conditions favourable” to Soviet foreign policy. Active measures are seen as closely linked to refleksivnoe upravlenie (“reflexive control”), another concept with a history going back to early Soviet strategic thinkers, which describes an effort to make targets act against their own interests, without realising they are doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has used a variety of actors and channels to undertake information operations. Overt media outlets for foreign audiences, such as Russia Today, RIA Novosti, Sputnik and their regional affiliates, provide a platform for Russia-friendly “experts”, while overseas groups and influencers – both witting and unwitting – spread Russia-friendly messages on social and mainstream media in other states. Under the surface, troll farms such as Lakhta Internet Research ‒ originally named the Internet Research Agency, set up by now-deceased commercial caterer and co-founder of the Wagner Group Yevgeniy Prigozhin in the mid-2010s ‒ use both human tolls and automated social media advertising campaigns to promote and recycle messages on behalf of the Russian state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia uses this machinery to promote key themes, which include its supposed role as the primary opponent of fascism in the second world war, its alleged victimisation by the US and an expanding NATO, and the corruption and ineffectiveness of the EU. Current variations on these themes also include efforts to undermine the reputation of the government of Ukraine, Western support for Kyiv and sanctions against Russia. Russian campaigns in Europe, North America and developing countries have also touched upon anti-colonial and anti-liberal themes, presenting Western countries as predatory and decadent outsiders, in contrast to a traditionalist and conservative Russia that supports developing nations’ independence and sovereignty. A recent Russia-funded disinformation campaign in Africa, highlighted by the US Department of State in February 2024, spread rumours that the US had created dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease which has taken many African lives, and that the US was using Africans as guinea pigs in their efforts to create a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also used information operations during foreign election campaigns to promote the interests of one candidate or side over another. The best known of these are the hacks of the DNC in 2016, collecting over 50,000 emails and documents, which were subsequently posted on a supposed whistleblowing website, DCLeaks, which was in fact a GRU front. The release of the documents was clearly intended to undermine the presidential campaign of Hilary Clinton. Russia also used a hack-and-dump operation of private material to target the 2017 election campaign of French President Emmanuel Macron, and has used other subversive information tactics to disrupt various US elections since 2016, including the US 2020 presidential election. Several analysts further assess that Russia has used similar techniques to exacerbate social divisions in other Western states during other public votes, such as the independence referendum in Scotland in 2014, the Brexit Referendum in the UK in 2016, the illegal Catalan independence referendum in Spain in 2017, and the NATO entry referendum in Montenegro in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has, moreover, exploited opportunities to encourage social strife outside of elections. It is believed to have been behind a “false flag” operation in France in 2015, when a group claiming to support IS hacked into the TV5 Monde network and promoted Islamist extremist narratives. Russian operatives were also likely to be responsible for the so-called “Lisa Affair” in January 2016, when Russian information operations networks, abetted by public figures such as Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, disseminated false stories about the abduction of “Lisa”, a Russian-German girl living in Berlin, who was said to have been kidnapped and molested by three “Southern” men. Russia has continued to exploit racist, Islamophobic and antisemitic narratives in Europe too, using the Hamas attack against Israel on 7 October 2023 as an opportunity to set European Muslim and Jewish communities against one another with public provocations. Over the past decade, Russia has also promoted divisive racial, religious and ideological narratives across North America, targeting issues such as gun rights, abortion and the Black Lives Matter movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variation of this Russian approach has been the use of “street-level” provocations, which seek to stimulate disagreements and public clashes. During the 2016 US election, Russian operatives operating online encouraged demonstrations both for and against the different presidential candidates in the same locations, to cause trouble. More recently, French officials are reported to believe that Russian intelligence was behind a Moldovan couple who are alleged to have painted Star of David symbols across the suburbs of Paris in October and November 2023, following the start of the Gaza conflict. The images of the stars were then picked up by a Russian disinformation network and recycled online to exacerbate tensions between Jewish and Muslim communities. An additional technique in the Russian subversive repertoire has been to try to sow general confusion. This technique, described by analysts Christopher Paul and Miriam Matthew as the “firehose of falsehoods”, shows no attempt to create, support or undermine any distinct narrative, but simply to shower online audiences with multiple contradictory versions of reality. Unlike the targeting of social wedge issues intended to create rancour, the firehose technique is designed instead to create such levels of uncertainty about the truth that the audience is too disoriented to react. One of the most prolific Russian firehose campaigns came during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the propagation of multiple differing stories about the origins of the virus, the efficacy of various medical treatments and emerging vaccines, and the policies and performances of various national governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Russia, China’s information operations have tended to promote a positive image of China and the CCP, rather than seeking to undermine opponents, exploit divisions or generate chaos. According to China specialist Anne-Marie Brady, China’s information operations have focused on two main audiences – diaspora Chinese and foreigners – among which it seeks to raise China’s profile as an effective state and benevolent force, and undermine and marginalise anti-CCP opinions. The main exception to this nuanced approach has been the targeting of pro-independence and pro-US narratives in Taiwan. According to analysis conducted by the Taiwanese think-tank IORG (now Taiwan Information Environment Research Center), Chinese-language media and social media content between 2021 and 2023 exhibited 84 types of anti-US narratives, including claims of poisonous US pork imports into Taiwan, and the secret harvesting of Taiwanese blood by the US to make a bioweapon to attack China. During the Taiwanese presidential election of January 2024, there were also indications that a state-linked Chinese cyber group known as “Spamouflage” was behind an AI-generated video showing Taiwanese news anchors making false allegations about the outgoing president, which Microsoft Threat Intelligence assessed to be the first known case of state-backed AI disinformation in an election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although more cautious than Russia, however, observers have noted something of a pivot in Chinese information operations since the start of the pandemic in 2020, with a turn towards harder-edged campaigns intended for wider audiences. China followed Russia’s lead in spreading disinformation about the origins of the Covid-19 virus, suggesting that it had emanated from a US biological warfare facility, and pushed a narrative that Western governments had failed to handle the crisis as effectively as China. According to US civil society group the Alliance for Securing Democracy, Chinese government-linked Twitter accounts posted around 90,000 tweets spreading disinformation on Covid-19 in the months of April and May 2020 alone, while in June 2020, Twitter closed 170,000 accounts it assessed were part of a coordinated Chinese disinformation campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other research suggests that more divisive Chinese information operations have not been limited to Covid-19. The Centre for Information Resilience, a UK think-tank, in August 2021 revealed the existence of a network of false social media profiles across multiple platforms, which were not only promoting Chinese pandemic narratives, but were spreading disinformation on US gun laws and racial issues. Reflecting on this and other evidence, China expert Bethany Allen has suggested that Chinese information operations are increasingly amplifying other states’ anti-Western narratives, “demonstrating growing convergence between their ideologies and information strategies”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has also developed its own information operations, with overt and covert dimensions, mixing self-promotion, transnational repression and attempts to stir up trouble within opponent states such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the US. During periods of tension in the Middle East, Iran has tended to expand these efforts, as recently demonstrated when social media accounts linked to the regime seeded and recycled multiple fake images of the Iranian drone and missile attack on Israel on 13 April 2024. Iran has also sought to use disinformation to interfere in overseas elections, sending fake emails to US voters claiming to be from far-right group the Proud Boys, which threatened to harm the recipients if they did not vote for presidential candidate Donald Trump, as well as recycling Trump campaign claims of electoral fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea seems to be less active in subversive information than the other main revisionist states, but middle powers such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have become major online players, targeting local rivals and various religious and political movements they deem to be internal threats. As noted in the discussion of cyber effects, the UAE and Qatar have become deeply engaged in what Buchanan calls an ongoing battle of “tit for tat hack-and-leak operations”, each country seeking to embarrass the other politically with accusations of support for Islamist extremist terrorism. In the Balkans, under the leadership of Alexander Vučić, Serbia has sought to use disinformation to promote his political ends, enabling media ecosystem that recycles Russian and Chinese talking points. In South Asia, India and Pakistan have long been engaged in a covert battle that has now spilled into the realm of online disinformation about each other’s governments and military operations. Indian intelligence has also used social media posts, channelled through a fake civil society group called The Disinfo Lab, to target US-based critics of the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Several Western governments are also active in the information space, seeking to rebut, rather than propagate, disinformation. France has taken on Russian propaganda in sub-Saharan Africa, but its efforts have on occasion backfired when they have been revealed to have been using the same kind of fake social media accounts as the Russians themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;47-malign-influence&quot;&gt;4.7. Malign influence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where subversion tends to be broad-brush, malign influence focuses on individuals and groups of political, economic, social or cultural significance. As noted in section 4.1, there has been evidence of Russia and China openly attempting to “Schroederise” Western elites, but this is likely to be only one element in these states’ overall efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most sophisticated exponent of malign influence is China. The activity of Chinese diaspora groups with links to the UFWD and other elements within the CCP has been widely used to provide cover for intelligence operatives claiming to be business leaders, journalists, students and academics, allowing them to operate throughout Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region. A major case, revealed in December 2020, was the targeting of Eric Swalwell, a member of the US House of Representatives, who developed a close relationship with Chinese national Christine Fang in the early 2010s. Fang, whom US authorities suspected of being an undercover MSS operative, lived in California as a student, where she became involved in politics and began to meet and befriend local politicians, Swalwell among them. Media coverage of the story led to unsuccessful Republican attempts to remove Swalwell from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, even though he had ended his relations with Fang after receiving a briefing from the CIA in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other cases have emerged beyond the US. In November 2017, Sam Dastyari, an Australian senator, was revealed to have taken a sympathetic stance towards Chinese territorial claims in the South and East China Seas, in contradiction to the policy of his own Labor Party. Media stories also alleged that Dastyari had developed a close financial relationship with Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo, who was himself alleged to have ties to the CCP. Dastyari subsequently resigned from the Senate. In January 2022, MI5 alleged to Sir Lindsey Hoyle, the speaker of the UK House of Commons, that Christine Lee, a solicitor active in the UK’s Chinese diaspora, with links to numerous British politicians, was a witting asset of the UFWD, and had sought to influence members of Parliament through donations. That same month, Canada’s Privy Council Office reported that the Chinese consulate in Toronto had made clandestine transfers to 11 candidates and 13 campaign staff, seeking to influence the federal election of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also sought to exert covert influence, working through the same kinds of civil society fronts, businesses, experts and professionals as China. A recently reported example is Pravfond, a Russian government-backed foreign aid body staffed by former SVR officers, which has been active in online propaganda and the legal defence of Russian nationals linked to illegal state activities. As Russia expert Catherine Belton notes, many Russian front groups have budgets that “were always murky”, and according to one of her sources, likely to be connected to Russian intelligence. Russian dirty money has also played a central role in channelling malign influence through commercial avenues. Russia’s dominance in European hydrocarbons has provided the means by which it can influence corrupt local elites on the continent, using local intermediary businesses – partly state owned, partly private – not only to supply oil or gas, but also to distribute secret funds to friendly politicians, political groups and businesspeople. As outlined in recent SOC ACE research, examples are numerous, and include well-documented cases such as the funnelling of Russian state cash to the pro-Russian presidential campaign of Prime Minister Victor Yanukovych in Ukraine in 2004, disbursed through a Ukrainian intermediary of Russian energy giant Gazprom. Russia has also exploited similar techniques beyond its near abroad; for example, developing but never implementing a scheme in 2018 to sell discounted Russian diesel to an Italian firm, which would then be sold at full price, with the difference donated to Italian radical right party Lega Nord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has found other covert channels by which to influence potentially sympathetic politicians across Europe. Media reports of successive allegations of suspicious payments to pro-Russian European politicians and parties have included recent scandals over payments to MEPs, which are allegedly linked to Kremlin efforts to shift the balance of political opinion on the war in Ukraine among European political circles. These types of funds rarely come directly from official Russian sources, of course, passing through many different types of intermediaries: politically sympathetic Russian oligarchs; Russian banks and businesses, such as First Czech Russia bank, which provided a loan to Marine Le Pen in 2014; third-country nationals, such as the Swiss lawyers allegedly used to distribute funds in Czech politics; or extreme Russian groups, such as the Russian Imperial Movement, which has provided funding for the Scandinavian far right. Other avenues of influence Russia has exploited include offers of benefits in kind, and illegal or unethical commercial opportunities. Russia has organised “fact-finding” visits to occupied locations in Crimea and eastern Ukraine for German, Italian, Austrian and Czech politicians, where they have been offered sanctioned business opportunities, presumably in return for political favours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to China and Russia, both Iran and North Korea have shown limited appetite or capacity to mount high-level malign influence operations. However, other states have tried. Among the revisionist states’ closest associates, Venezuela has sought to influence political battles in neighbouring countries and even further afield, providing funds for the populist Five Star Movement in Italy in 2010. Recent court cases in the US have also revealed allegations of middle powers such as Egypt, Turkiye and the UAE illegally providing funds to political representatives and campaigns in the hope of promoting their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;48-sponsoring-internal-opponents&quot;&gt;4.8. Sponsoring internal opponents&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States can also go beyond covert attempts to influence opinion, taking steps to covertly support internal actors that undermine the stability of a targeted state. What this can amount to covers a broad spectrum, from material support for civil protests to prolonged military campaigns by insurgent groups (an area where there can be significant crossover with sponsoring terrorist groups, as noted in section 4.4.5). Such forms of direct covert support or intervention have a long history; both the US and USSR used them during the Cold War to create problems for their opponents, especially in the developing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Russia has been the most active stirrer of domestic chaos, especially among its near neighbours, paying for protesters and provocateurs in former Soviet states such as Moldova. It has also actively meddled in the developing world, providing financial and material support for the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan prior to the group’s victory in 2021, as discussed previously. However, Russia has been more circumspect in applying similar techniques in the West. Certainly, it has been suspected of supporting discontent in several Western countries over the past decade, such as the “gilets jaunes” (“yellow vests”) movement in France in 2018, and protests in the US in 2016, but its attempts to instigate direct protests and social unrest as a form of disruption have been limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran has also sought to support protests in neighbouring states; following Israel’s military response to Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023, Iranian operatives reportedly encouraged pro-Hamas protests in Israel’s pro-Western neighbour, Jordan. Evidence of similar efforts has emerged in the US and Europe, too; in October 2023, The Times reported that the UK police and MI5 believed Iranian operatives were not only encouraging pro-Hamas demonstrations in London, but were also deploying operatives within the crowds. In July 2024, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines stated that Iran had encouraged, and in some cases even paid for, pro-Hamas protests against the US. Again, however, Iran’s actions have tended to be limited to generating and supporting protests rather than intense civil strife. Its actions have been carefully calibrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Russia and Iran, China, by contrast, has been much less likely to provide material support for internal opposition groups overseas, partly out of its general preference for stability. Indeed, Beijing seems more interested in strengthening the hands of partner governments against dissenters and rebels than sponsoring disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the revisionist states, however, there are a range of examples of middle powers covertly supporting armed groups, apparently to undermine the stability of their local opponents. The alleged support of Pakistan’s ISI for Islamist extremist groups’ attacks on India has been mentioned (section 4.4.5). Pakistani officials have also asserted that India has provided support for extremist and irredentist groups in its own unsettled and contested provinces of Baluchistan and Kashmir. In South America, Venezuela and Colombia have accused each other of harbouring and supporting insurgents, criminals and terrorists who mount cross-border attacks; while in Africa, the UN has highlighted alleged support for the M23 rebel group by Rwanda and Uganda in the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Although it might be argued that these examples of covert proxy support do not touch the West, they are common in the developing world, and are almost certainly in need of greater understanding as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;49-sponsoring-regime-change&quot;&gt;4.9. Sponsoring regime change&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final area of covert state activity is involvement in efforts to alter a targeted state’s political arrangements, whether by non-violent means such as vote-rigging, or by sponsoring coups d’état. Russia has the clearest track record in this area, particularly among its near neighbours, allegedly supporting a failed coup against pro-NATO leader of Montenegro Milo Ðukanović in 2016. The plot involved pro-Russian locals, a former senior Serbian soldier, Russian funding and operational support from two GRU officers. Russia has also recently been accused of seeking to buy votes in the 2024 presidential election in Moldova, using criminal groups as intermediaries. Russia appears to have a willingness to meddle directly in the developing world too; senior US military officers have raised the possibility that the Wagner Group played an influential role in stimulating successive military revolts in the so-called “coup belt” of the Sahel and the Horn of Africa in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Russia appears to have limits to how far it will intervene in the West itself, at least for now. Here, Russia has focused on using subversion and malign influence, but has been unwilling to seek to “fix” elections. It is notable that while Russian operatives hacked into US voter databases in 2016, there is no evidence that they sought to tamper with voter rolls. That said, of course, it is also possible this was an act intended to send a message to the US that Russia had the capability to undertake more direct political interference in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other recent examples of attempted regime change by revisionist states are more difficult to identify. China has shown little willingness to topple governments it does not like, although it might have had a hand in approving the Zimbabwean Defence Forces’ removal of Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe in November 2017. There are also only a few credible recent examples of middle powers seeking to bring about regime change in rival states. A recent case is the alleged attempt by Jordan’s Crown Prince Hamza to overthrow his brother, King Abdullah, in April 2021, which some believed also involved Saudi Arabia. Nonetheless, credible cases are rare, perhaps indicating that direct attempts to change other states’ political arrangements, rather than influencing or destabilising them, are deemed among the most high-risk and possibly difficult of state threats to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;410-conclusion&quot;&gt;4.10. Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this section demonstrates, the range of current state threats is extremely broad, running from overt bullying behaviour through to attempts at covert regime change. As summarised in Table 3, many overt and covert activities are in some ways mirror images or extensions of one another, in areas such as influence and subversion. However, while the visible use of coercion against governments is an important part of the modern phenomenon of state threats, it is clear from the survey that the centre of gravity of states’ activities, and the area which offers the widest range of options, is in the covert and clandestine sphere. As the next section explores, this has made state threats primarily the province of the most secretive of state actors and their partners in the commercial, criminal and extremist demi-mondes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 3: Comparison of overt and covert/clandestine measures by class of action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-executing-state-threats&quot;&gt;5. Executing state threats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how state threats are initiated and executed is an obvious problem. In democratic societies, details can eventually become public, but in authoritarian states, the challenge is much greater, given their very obvious lack of transparency. A certain amount of educated speculation is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outside, all political leaders wish to present the image of a well-organised state apparatus, with themselves and their colleagues in complete control; however, all states, of all types, are heirs to basic problems that make translating policy into action more difficult than might first appear. Unfortunately, however, because of fundamental psychological distortions, outside observers can often forget this, leading governments to overestimate the coherence and coordination of their opponents’ behaviours, a pattern international relations scholar Robert Jervis has documented extensively. This is a particularly common problem for democratic governments looking at authoritarian states, where the tendency is to see a single lead actor and a single will. All actions are viewed through the lens of an image of supreme control. But as political scientist Barbara Geddes and colleagues have shown, decision-making in dictatorships can be as incoherent, or even more incoherent, than in democracies, with members of authoritarian regimes competing to maintain position and gain favour with the leadership; “for most purposes dictatorships should not be analyzed as unitary actors”, they conclude. Caution and discernment should therefore be close companions when exploring how state threats originate and are operationalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;51-initiating-hostile-acts&quot;&gt;5.1. Initiating hostile acts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cautious approach to the claims of authoritarian efficiency should not, however, lead immediately to the assumption that these states operate in complete chaos. Authoritarian leaders have varying degrees of control over foreign and security policies, with the level depending on the extent to which the regime is dominated by its leader or “personalised” around them, the effectiveness and character of the military and bureaucracy, the existence and strength of non-state sources of power, and the relationship between formal and informal powers. Hostile activities might therefore emerge from several different sources in an authoritarian state, including the state’s leadership, individual government departments or agencies, freelancing officials, or individuals, groups or networks within or close to the regime, depending on its character and composition. Ian Kershaw, a historian of Nazi Germany, has used the ideas of Max Weber to show how Adolf Hitler’s regime developed a hybrid policymaking model, with the leader’s rhetoric setting the overall direction of the regime, and those below and around him seeking to “work towards” realising Hitler’s expectations and objectives, as a Nazi functionary described it. It is useful to keep this interpretation in mind when considering how hostile state activities emerge in modern authoritarian states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the core contemporary revisionist states, the regime whose decision-making has been most exhaustively explored is that of Russia under President Putin. As Russian security scholar Andrew Monaghan observes, experts on Russia have offered a range of interpretations of how Putin’s sistema (“system of governance”) operates, from those who see a strong hand directing from above, through to those who see something akin to lightly managed chaos. Nonetheless, while examples of both interpretations can be found, the regime does not appear to behave totally consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, much of the initiation of state-linked hostile acts is bureaucratised. Russia’s intelligence agencies have the main responsibility for covert and clandestine activity, and as organs of state, they follow broad strategic objectives set out by the Kremlin, with varying degrees of activism, creativity, autonomy and competitiveness. Very often, this process works with little need for direct Kremlin approval. As Kevin Riehle, a long-time scholar of Russian intelligence commented in interview, “Putin only wants to provide strategic guidance, or to intervene if things go wrong; the less he has to do that, the happier he is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as Monaghan writes, there is “a wealth of evidence” that the formal state is “often dysfunctional in practice”. This leads to what international relations scholar David Lewis has described as Russia’s “dual system”, with a state bureaucracy undertaking business as best it can, supplemented by “a parallel system of governance, known as ruchnoe upravlenie (‘manual control’)”. In situations of manual control, members of the presidential administration look for ad hoc solutions to meet policy objectives or rectify failures, working “through unofficial ‘curators’ to ensure effective implementation of decisions”. Galeotti describes these curators as “an adhocracy” of “political entrepreneurs” in business, the media, politics, or from the worlds of intelligence and organised crime. When the formal state fails, or cannot meet a need, the “adhocrats” step in to offer their services; an exemplar was Yevgeniy Prigozhin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General strategic requirements or specific requests come to the adhocrats, but they can have wide latitude in shaping the ultimate nature of the objective itself. Writing with Balkans expert Tena Prelec, Lewis has shown how, in past Russian attempts to pressure Moldova, “overall strategy” came from the Kremlin, but there was also “input from other actors” and actual implementation of hostile acts relied “heavily on parastate actors and local elites”. These implementers were “not simply pawns of the Kremlin”, but actors in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the adhocracy have even greater autonomy in how they pursue regime objectives, with or without direction. In his study of Russia’s relations with the European far right, Shekhovtsov has shown that the Kremlin, rather than directing the development of contacts, allowed a permissive environment in which Russian political, business and cultural figures could build ties with like-minded individuals and groups overseas, which might then have political value at a later date. In riskier matters such as assassinations, Russia also seems to have maintained a significant tolerance for adhocrats taking matters into their own hands. As Riehle commented in interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;assassinations not sponsored by the Russian state are likely the work of strong business elites who kill to remove competition or an obstacle. However, those assassinations may also be in the interests of the state, because when a person is an obstacle to a pro-Russian corporation, he or she is also an obstacle to the state. Non-state assassinations sometimes also align with state interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s mixed system of decision-making and operationalisation is in some ways mirrored in Iran, although its system seems more centrifugal and disordered. “Iran’s theocratic regime has been eager to present itself as a well-organised state, following the orders of the Supreme Leader”, remarked Ali Ansari, a historian of Iran at the University of St Andrews, interviewed for this project: “The reality is much less impressive.” Indeed, as scholars of Iranian grand strategy Thierry Balzacq and Wendy Ramadan-Alban note, this well-crafted image of top-down control obscures “the reality of cross-institutional factionalism across the regime”. While the Supreme Leader is the most significant overall player within the state, he is not all powerful. His role is to make occasional specific commands, provide strategic guidance and adjudicate between different factions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, Ansari suggested, the regime operates more like “a collection of non-state actors” than a coherent state, where even non-Iranian non-state partners such as Hezbollah cooperate and compete within a diffuse political ecosystem. This suggests that the origins of specific acts of Iranian hostile activity will lie in the multiple decisions of institutions, factions and networks throughout the regime. Of the factions within the regime, the IRGC is probably the most powerful because of its close links to the supreme leader, extensive military and intelligence capabilities, and commercial empire. However, the IRGC too is hobbled to an extent by internal factionalisation, suggesting that its activities should not be seen as any more coordinated than the wider state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison with Russia and Iran, China has had a historic reputation for having a more heavily bureaucratic decision-making structure, with a collective leadership transmitting directions down through state and CCP structures. However, the reality has never been this clear-cut. There has long been tension between state and party structures, and a tendency for new party-linked groups and bodies to proliferate; prior to the arrival of President Xi, outside observers emphasised how the rapid growth of Chinese foreign policy actors had led to an increasingly fragmented Chinese approach to the outside world. As China expert Rush Doshi notes, a loosening of controls in the 2000s did indeed allow such outward-facing actors more autonomy, within limits. While agencies’ priorities have been set and are monitored at a senior level, the agencies themselves have operational autonomy in how they are achieved. There is also some evidence of state officials following their own paths, although this is more often in pursuit of personal gain than personal agendas; official corruption and entrepreneurialism have long thrived in the Chinese state, with officials and diplomats seeking to channel illicit funds out of China through a burgeoning underground banking network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese model of a largely consistent bureaucracy, tinged with some diversity and irregularity, appears to have continued under Xi. However, there has been a definite attempt to tighten central control, with Xi taking a ruthless approach to perceived failure and corruption, and ensuring his own acolytes take senior positions. The goals and character of the regime have also increasingly mirrored the nationalistic and authoritarian temperament of Xi, with officials required to cleave to the ideas contained in what China scholars Steve Tsang and Olivia Cheung describe as “Xi Thought”. Although Xi could hardly be in complete control of the vast Chinese state and the CCP, his increasingly dominant position suggests that China’s hostile activities are likely to closely reflect his preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, North Korea is the opaquest regime of the core revisionist group. Since its creation in 1948, North Korea has been run as a hereditary dictatorship under the Kim dynasty. Kim Jong Un, its leader since December 2011, is the grandson of the regime’s founder, Kim Il Sung. Under the country’s suryong (“leader”) system, Kim Jong Un enjoys ultimate power. But, as with other authoritarian states, it is not always clear what this means in practice. Certainly, the Kim family has “the ultimate authority in North Korea”, remarked Aaron Arnold, a former UN Panel of Experts member, in interview: “This is a criminal state, run like a mafia family”. Former UK ambassador to North Korea Alastair Morgan also noted during interview that “there is a strong ‘vertical of power’ in Pyongyang, and Kim takes a very close interest in strategic matters”. In practice, this means that for the most important and riskiest decisions, such as missile launches, state assassinations and so on, the initiative or final say will probably sit with Kim. However, as with the other regimes discussed, North Korea’s leadership cannot have complete control of day-to-day activities. For most hostile activities – the cybercrime campaign, for example – relevant departments of the state are likely to manage their execution to support Kim’s objectives. While this provides some small flexibility for initiative, this is largely tempered by the knowledge of the potentially fatal consequences of making mistakes or misleading the leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;52-executing-hostile-acts&quot;&gt;5.2. Executing hostile acts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once initiated, the implementation of hostile acts can be a complex process involving both state and non-state actors. Intelligence officers are often central, whether as project managers or executors of the hostile act; their status will usually be obfuscated with various forms of official (diplomatic) and non-official cover. To increase deniability, state actors also effectively hire or work with a wide range of non-state actors. Although non-state actors involved in hostile acts are often described as state proxies – actors under the direct control or direction of the state in question – the word should be applied with caution. The relationships between state and non-state actors can be complex, and in many cases, it is more appropriate to consider the non-state actor as a partner or collaborator, rather than just a hired hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in section 2, the involvement of non-state actors poses a problem of responsibility: which of non-state actors’ behaviours should be treated as state threats, and which should not? Observers can of course look for evidence of a recognised chain of command or operational relationship between a state and non-state actor, and an indication that a form of tasking or plan has been agreed between the two. But in the covert world, finding the evidence to show this convincingly is a high bar that is unlikely to be met. Perhaps the most that can be hoped for is to collect enough material to: (a) identify a probable relationship between a state and non-state actor; and (b) find consistency and alignment between the state actor’s objectives and the apparent objectives of the non-state actor’s conduct. Even then, the line is difficult to draw clearly, as it is perfectly possible for non-state actors to act in ways apparently consistent with a state’s objectives without any direction or encouragement whatsoever. Indeed, as episodes in the history of US covert action show – for example, US intelligence’s collaboration with hyper-active Cuban anti-regime groups during the Cuban Missile Crisis – the tail can threaten to wag the dog. Researchers therefore need to take a careful approach that weighs evidence on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.2.1. State operatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state operatives most intimately involved in implementing hostile activity are (military or civilian) intelligence officers. The number and responsibilities of intelligence agencies differs from state to state. In Russia, there are three major agencies: military intelligence, the GU (formerly, and still colloquially known as, the GRU); foreign intelligence, the SVR; and the security agency, FSB. Of these three, the GRU is the most engaged in sabotage and subversion overseas; its Unit 29155 is thought to have been responsible for some of the most high-profile hostile actions in the West, such as the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in 2018 and the destruction of a munition’s depot in Czechia in 2014. The SVR is more focused on foreign espionage and the FSB on domestic concerns, although both have undertaken more kinetic and intrusive hostile acts overseas. In China, the major intelligence agencies are the MSS and the three intelligence departments of the PLA. These departments are charged with technical surveillance, HUMINT and subversion, and malign influence operations. In addition, a recent espionage case in the UK involving Chinese-heritage and non-Chinese individuals, suggests that the agencies of China’s Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong are also now running overseas operations against Western targets. In Iran, the IRGC and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) are the main overseas intelligence operators; while in North Korea, covert and clandestine activities are managed by the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), also known as Unit 586, which was created in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the dominance of intelligence agencies as the main official operators behind hostile activity, other official agencies can be involved too. In China, a wide range of state and CCP bodies also play an important role in espionage, disinformation and malign influence operations. The most significant Chinese organisation is the UFWD of the Central Committee of the CCP, which is charged with managing relations with the Chinese diaspora, co-opting foreigners and suppressing overseas criticism of China. As China experts have noted, the UFWD operates much like an intelligence agency overseas, often working under diplomatic cover at Chinese embassies, alongside MSS or PLA representatives. As Allen describes, “party cadres who hold an official position in the United Front Work Department may ‘double-hat’ … [holding] publicly undisclosed positions in the department”. A further important political agency is the International Liaison Department in the Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission, which also seeks to influence the policies and behaviours of other countries’ defence and foreign policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these more dedicated agencies, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea all have significant state-owned or linked industries that are used to provide cover for state operatives or to undertake hostile activities in their own right. In China, state-owned enterprises have close ties to the MSS and are legally obliged by Chinese law to cooperate with Chinese intelligence agencies. In North Korea, the regime has used state trading companies to produce heroin and methamphetamine; counterfeit US currency, cigarettes and pharmaceuticals; evade sanctions; and launder illicit funds. Russian state-owned media has also acted on behalf of the Russian intelligence services; in one remarkable example, Russian journalists ostensibly reporting on the poisoning of Putin critic and opposition leader Alexei Navalny in March 2021 were alleged to have conducted covert reconnaissance on the security of the Berlin hospital where he was being treated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;5.2.2. Non-state operatives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside official operatives, the variety of non-state actors involved in operationalising hostile acts is extremely diverse, ranging across the legitimate private sector, civil society, criminal organisations and even terrorist groups. As noted above, relationships with non-state actors are far from uniform. Many non-state actors can be partners of, or contractors to, state or even other non-state actors, rather than direct surrogates or proxies. Indeed, even for those that most closely fit the concept of a proxy, a variety of influences can be in play, including the non-state actor’s own agenda or self-perceived interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oligarchs and tycoons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peculiar character of the post-Soviet regimes that have evolved since the end of the Cold War has highlighted the role of “oligarchs”: business leaders who have amassed great wealth through ownership of former state-owned companies, and who as a result have wielded significant economic and political influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian oligarchs had significant independent power in the 1990s, but with the ascendancy of Putin, their autonomy was constrained. The regime now appears to expect them to act as custodians of Russian national wealth and, when required, as arms of the state. Oleg Deripaska, a metals tycoon close to the Putin regime, told journalist Catherine Belton in 2007, “I don’t separate myself from the state. I have no other interests”. Russian oligarchs and their businesses can thus often act as deniable state partners, especially when exercising both overt and malign influence through economic and financial means. For example, Konstanin Malofeev, a successful investment banker and conservative ideologue, has played a significant role in creating channels through which far-right groups across Europe and North America have built closer relations with the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of oligarchs is not just limited to Russia and the post-Soviet world, however. Chinese and Chinese-heritage tycoons based in Hong Kong and Macao have acted on behalf of the Chinese state and CCP overseas; as Hamilton and Ohlberg remark, for these individuals, “loyalty to the Party is a condition of doing business”. For example, Canada’s Operation Sidewinder, an investigation conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service in the 1990s, revealed extensive cooperation between Chinese tycoons, OCGs (“Triads”) and Chinese intelligence officers in money laundering and political influence operations in Vancouver, a model which Canadian investigative journalists and academics have suggested continues in use. It is a pattern with parallels in other countries too, including Australia; the resignation of Senator Dastyari in 2017, mentioned above, was in part triggered by revelations of his financial relationship with Huang Xiangmo, a UFWD-linked Chinese real estate tycoon keen to promote Chinese political interests in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Businesses and contractors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses – the organisations as much as their owners and managers – have also long played a role in covert activities, and were a key element of “arm’s-length” operations by the USSR in the Cold War. Involved businesses can be legitimate commercial concerns with no roots in the secret world, but have owners or senior leaders willing to allow the organisation to be used as cover for intelligence operations. Other firms can be legitimate front companies, businesses secretly set up by agencies themselves to conduct both genuine commercial and covert activities; meanwhile, shell companies, which do no commercial activity at all and have obscured ownership structures, can be used to provide cover for covert or illicit activities, and create a commercial grounding for the movement of operational funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During periods of prolonged international isolation, both North Korea and Iran have become sophisticated users of front and shell companies in order to procure and sell illicit goods, evade sanctions and launder funds; they have developed sophisticated networks through intermediaries based in major trading and financial centres such as Hong Kong, Singapore and the UAE. Studies of North Korean sanctions evasion have found, for example, that many of its overseas operations were conducted with the help of foreign individuals and foreign front companies, including some with Chinese links. Further recent research suggests that since the start of the war in Ukraine, Russia has also been learning to use such tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China too, private businesses play a role in covert activities, especially with regard to collecting commercial intelligence. Under the Counter-Espionage Law of 2014, all private organisations and individuals are required to provide information to the state on request, and since the introduction of the National Intelligence Law of 2017, they have also been required to “assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work”. According to Murray Scot Tanner, an expert on Chinese law enforcement, these laws have shifted the burden of responsibility for collecting and sharing sensitive information from the public to the private sector, creating “affirmative legal responsibilities for Chinese and, in some cases, foreign citizens, companies, or organizations operating in China to provide access, cooperation, or support for Beijing’s intelligence-gathering activities”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of these activities are likely to have no contractual underpinnings, in other cases, businesses have provided covert services commercially – and with a legal paper trail. Activities that require technical expertise, such as online surveillance, cyber espionage, cybotage and online disinformation, can be difficult for less well-resourced state agencies to sustain without external expertise. According to US indictments issued in March 2016, for example, Iran has used legitimate Iranian IT companies to undertake hacking operations. Many middle powers – especially in the Middle East – have also called on contractor services, looking internationally to firms staffed with former military, intelligence and law enforcement professionals, sometimes from Western countries. Notable examples include the UAE’s use of DarkMatter Group, a company composed of former NSA members, to monitor dissidents and critics; or the Archimedes Group, an Israeli business that Facebook found to be conducting information operations on its platform for suspected parties in Latin America, Africa and South-East Asia. This group of non-state actors also appears to be growing quickly. The Oxford Internet Institute found that the number of private cyber firms offering services to governments nearly doubled between 2019 and 2020, from 25 to 48, indicating a strong upward trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private military companies/contractors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A contractor type of increasing significance is the PMC. The deployment of PMCs became a regular feature of the Western military occupations of developing countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq in the 1990s and the first two decades of the 21st century. Over that period, the growth and use of such firms spread globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has been a major development hub for PMCs, despite their being illegal under Russian law. At the core of the Russian sector has been a network of companies commonly referred to as the Wagner Group, set up from 2014 onwards under the stewardship of Yevgeny Prigozhin, but subsequently subsumed into wider state operations since his death in August 2023. The Wagner Group has acted as the “long arm” of intervention for Russia in conflicts in the Middle East, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, supporting authoritarian leaders, conducting criminal activities and enabling Russian sanctions evasion efforts. Wagner has also played an active role in anti-Western disinformation efforts in Africa; in October 2019, Facebook announced that it had closed a disinformation operation across eight African countries that Wagner had coordinated. Emerging evidence also suggests that Wagner has become a covert operator in the West too. Two UK nationals were arrested in April 2024 for an act of arson on a Ukraine-linked business that Wagner is alleged to have commissioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is not the only state to have allowed or enabled the creation of PMCs, moreover, although evidence of others’ involvement in covert activities is less obvious. The Chinese state has used major Chinese PMCs such as China Security &amp;amp; Protection Group, the Shandong Huawei Security Group and Genghis Security Services to provide security for the Belt and Road Initiative, and these PMCs also have close links to the Chinese military and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil society and lobby groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As several of the subversion cases previously discussed indicate, both Russia and China have used civil society groups such as think-tanks and NGOs to promote disinformation or channel malign influence. Giles has outlined, for example, how Russia has used sympathetic non-Russian nationals to set up front organisations that “can at first sight appear genuine and home-grown”, but which are in fact mouthpieces for Moscow. In addition, he notes, Russia has used sympathetic but “unwitting accomplices” in politics, the media and culture – infamously described as useful idiots by Vladimir Lenin – to recycle Russian narratives. It is here that carefully cultivated relationships with extreme and radical voices in Western countries have paid long-term dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese agencies are also prolific in their use of front civil society organisations. According to Hamilton and Ohlberg, the UFWD and its web of linked organisations have accelerated their activities since 2010, following CCP guidance to “build ethnic Chinese-based political organisations, make political donations, support ethnic Chinese politicians, and deploy votes to swing close-run elections”. MSS officers have also used externally focused think-tanks and fora such as the China International Culture Exchange Center, the China Reform Forum and the China Institute for Innovation &amp;amp; Development Strategy as covers to cultivate relationships with elite political, business and cultural leaders overseas, working through local diaspora groups. The aims of such organisations have been to gather intelligence about elite thinking in targeted societies, and push soothing narratives of China’s “peaceful rise”, an idea associated with Zheng Bijian, a senior adviser to the Chinese government. China has also used institutional links with Western universities as cover for covert activity. While intended to teach Chinese languages and share Chinese culture, Chinese state-supported Confucius Institutes have been used by the UFWD for intimidation and subversion on campuses, especially where there are significant Chinese student intakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Western lobbying industry has also proved a useful tool for covert malign influence. In several Western countries, the US and Australia for example, there are legal requirements for lobbyists acting on behalf of foreign governments to register their activities. However, over the past decade there have been several well-known instances of entrepreneurial lobbyists going beyond legal bounds to act as covert influencers. The investigation by former FBI director Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election led to the indictment and subsequent guilty plea of US lobbyist Paul Manafort for acting as an unregistered agent of the pro-Putin Yanukovych regime of Ukraine. Manafort was also connected to pro-Putin oligarchs and a Russian intelligence officer, according to the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s investigation of Russian interference in the US political system. More recently, Gal Luft, a dual US-Israeli citizen, became a fugitive following his indictment in the US for alleged violations of the US Foreign Agents Registration Act and other alleged criminal acts. Luft – the joint head of a Maryland-based think-tank – was alleged to have acted as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government, and to have played the role of intermediary in an Iranian sanctions violation scheme. After absconding from bail following his arrest in Cyprus in 2023, Luft was re-arrested by Cypriot authorities in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Populations and diasporas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the cases of Manafort and Luft suggest, private individuals can play a valuable role as operatives, which goes beyond the world of high politics. As noted previously, China requires by law that private individuals as well as businesses cooperate actively with Chinese intelligence services. Chinese citizens’ covert and clandestine responsibilities continue to expand, moreover; in September 2021, Chinese citizens were required to provide their government with vulnerabilities they had identified in software, to help build a stockpile for state use. China has also used its so-called “fifty-cent army” ‒ a cadre of supposedly private citizens who are often in fact government employees are paid by the Chinese government to spread propaganda and disinformation online ‒ to support internet trolling in the state’s campaigns against dissent and anti-CCP narratives. Estimates suggest that these individuals produce around 450 million social media comments a year, although much of this activity is purely for domestic audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States are also looking to their diasporas for active support. Despite the narrow specifications of China’s Nationality Law, President Xi has stated that those of Chinese heritage are as subject to the Chinese state as Chinese nationals, commenting that “no matter where you are, you must always put the fatherland and the [Chinese] people in your heart … [and] be a defender and evangelist of patriotism”.This suggests that Xi expects those living overseas – while not subject to Chinese law – to cooperate with the Chinese state and CCP. Russia too has an expansive view of its Russki mir, which has percolated through to the exploitation of individuals of Russian heritage for covert activities. A recent example comes from the arrest of two German-Russian men by German police in April 2024; the men are alleged to have been planning acts of sabotage on behalf of Russia against industrial and military sites supplying the Ukrainian war effort. Other countries are also reported to be seeking to intimidate and interfere with diaspora communities. Mike Burgess, the head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, stated in August 2024 that “at least three or four” countries were attempting to interfere in Australia’s political system, and that some of the perpetrators were also Australian “friends”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organised crime and criminal gangs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States such as Russia and China are thus increasingly using an “all of society” approach to execute state threats, showing little concern about creating a clear dividing line between civilian and non-civilian activities. These states show a similar lack of qualms in their relations with criminal actors. According to interviews with several serving senior law enforcement officials in European jurisdictions, criminal involvement in covert state-linked activity has apparently risen over the past two decades, although the precise scale, scope and character of state-criminal relations remains opaque. As Magda Long, a scholar of covert influence operations, commented in interview, the nature of the state-crime nexus varies from state to state. In some instances, such as Russia, state agencies have a “much closer and integrated relationship with transnational criminal networks, some of which almost act as quasi state entities”. In other cases, “the relationships are more at arm’s length and are used episodically rather than consistently”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a European perspective therefore, Russia is the obvious exemplar of a robust state-crime nexus. The consensus of Russia experts is that Putin came to a modus vivendi with Russian and post-Soviet OCGs early in his tenure as President, promising a similar arrangement to the one offered to the oligarchs ‒ an arrangement Galeotti describes as, in effect, “a new social contract”, where the OCGs would be free to work within agreed boundaries, acting on behalf of the state as required. Over the decades, this compact has led to numerous interactions and tightening operational bonds, described by UK intelligence agencies to the UK Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee in 2020 as a “very muddy nexus between business and corruption and state power in Russia” and a “symbiotic relationship between the Russian state and organised crime”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian state officials and intelligence agencies have tasked OCGs and other serious criminals in numerous ways, ranging from undertaking low-level espionage activities, such as couriering messages and conducting surveillance, to providing more sophisticated services, such as arms trafficking. In a case from June 2010, suspected Russian intelligence officer Christopher Metsos (also known as Pavel Kapustin) absconded while on bail in Cyprus following the issue of a US arrest warrant on charges of acting as an unregistered foreign agent and conspiring to launder money. According to Galeotti, US counter-intelligence officers suspected Metsos had managed to escape with the help of Russian people traffickers. Professional criminals have also been connected to several potential state-sponsored assassinations against anti-Russian Chechen and North Caucasian leaders in Austria and Turkiye, and have facilitated increased flows of illegal migration across Russian and Belarusian borders into Scandinavia, the Baltic region and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, media reporting based on intelligence sources suggests that Russian intelligence agencies have sought OCGs’ help in increasing the agencies’ operational revenues, encouraging the OCGs to expand their operations in tobacco and other forms of smuggling to help the state. UK authorities have also claimed that Russian OCGs and money launderers disrupted by arrests in December 2024 were not only involved in laundering the proceeds of crime, but also provided funds for Russian intelligence operations. Recent arrests of suspected saboteurs in Poland in May 2024, some with criminal backgrounds, further suggest that Russian intelligence has been looking to criminal groups to support a wider range of hostile acts. In many of these activities, the criminals appear to originate from Russia or post-Soviet countries, but the Russian regime also appears to have worked with criminals from Balkan countries such as Bulgaria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, China’s historic relationship with OCGs has focused on maintaining order at home. In the 1980s, China’s paramount leader Deng Xiaoping reportedly reached an accommodation with the Triads in Hong Kong to ensure stability during the territory’s handover from the UK in 1997, with cooperation continuing after the transition. There have been further allegations that Triad-led gangs were deployed to attack pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in 2014. Chinese OCGs also appear to have been involved in covert state-sponsored activities further afield, as pathfinders for Chinese operational activity in more hostile environments. Recent investigative journalism has further suggested that Chinese OCGs in Italy and Spain were involved in setting up secret Chinese police stations, and played the role of local enforcers on behalf of the Chinese state. Other recent reporting has suggested that China has ignored the operations of criminal groups in numerous special economic zones across South-East Asia, on the understanding that the criminals avoid the homeland and promote Chinese interests overseas. Although China has increased anti-organised crime cooperation with other countries in the region, Chinese law enforcement has used what Southeast Asia expert Zachary Abuza describes as a “selective” approach, tackling only the OCGs which do not follow “the rules” as a form of coercion; Abuza notes that this is colloquially known as “kill[ing] the chicken to scare the monkeys”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elements of the Iranian regime are also alleged to have associations with organised crime, despite the regime’s theocratic basis. IRGC leaders have been linked to trafficking heroin from Afghanistan, as well as drug-trafficking schemes involving Hezbollah, the former Assad regime and Venezuela. However, the extent to which such involvements are institutional IRGC policy is uncertain; these relationships could just as easily be the result of corrupt relationships between individual commanders and OCGs. That said, there is considerable evidence to indicate that Iranian agencies do have operational relationships with OCGs beyond narcotics, especially in “hard” operational environments such as the UK and the US. In a number of cases that emerged in 2023 and 2024, authorities revealed that Iranian intelligence had worked with criminals to target Iranian dissidents and journalists living in the West. Such plots included an attempt to kill Masih Alinejad, an Iranian-US journalist, revealed in January 2023, which intriguingly involved an eastern European crime group, rather than one with more obvious Middle Eastern links. Iran is also alleged to have used OCGs to attack Israeli targets in Europe. According to statements from both the Mossad and the Swedish Security Service (SÄPO) in May 2024, the Kurdish crime group Foxtrot, which was based in Sweden, was responsible for a grenade attack on the Israeli embassy in Stockholm in January 2024, conducted at Iran’s request. Like Russia, it seems, Iran has become increasingly willing to use criminal operatives for more dangerous hostile acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea too has cultivated long-term relationships with various OCGs, including the Triads, Japanese yakuza and Russian mafia, mainly to distribute illicit goods and launder the funds generated. However, these relationships are most intimately connected to illicit revenue generation for state financing purposes, as opposed to other covert and clandestine state activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the four main revisionist states, there are examples of several others cultivating relationships with OCGs, whether as a means of generating income or to maintain domestic peace. Venezuela and Syria under the Assad regime are two obvious examples of states that have enabled organised criminal narcotics trafficking to benefit themselves. There are also instances of middle powers passively ignoring criminal activities that support the illicit activities of states such as Russia and Iran. The UAE, for one, has been accused by the US of taking a lax approach to tackling Russian sanctions evasion in its midst. There are also cases of middle powers apparently using criminals to undertake covert acts. Turkish intelligence has allegedly drawn on criminal networks to mount assassinations of dissidents living in European countries. The US has also recently claimed that India used an intermediary to hire a professional hitman to murder Sikh activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US in November 2023. However, in comparison to Russia or Iran, middle powers’ levels of engagement with criminality to mount hostile acts appear limited, for now at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber-criminals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing aspect of modern criminality is cybercrime. But although there are significant overlaps between new and old, the distinctive activities of cyber-criminals in the realm of state threats deserves special attention. As with other non-state actors, state actors’ relations with cyber-criminals exist on a spectrum. Cyber expert Tim Maurer has identified three types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegated relationships&lt;/strong&gt;, where state actors specifically direct cybercrime groups to undertake hostile acts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orchestrated relationships&lt;/strong&gt;, where state actors guide and incentivise cybercrime groups to undertake certain acts voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanctioned relationships&lt;/strong&gt;, where state actors create a permissive atmosphere for cybercrime groups to commit criminal acts that are not against the interests of the sanctioning state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful though these categories are, however, identifying unambiguous real-world examples for each with the evidence available is difficult, if not impossible; on the whole, the best that might be achieved is ascertaining some form of state-cybercrime nexus based on some identified operational links, the cyber groups’ patterns of behaviour, and choices of target. It is not an exact science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the core revisionist states, Russia seems to have the widest range of relationships with cyber-criminals. Some early examples have been at the extreme end of delegated relationships, with agencies recruiting criminal hackers and giving them intelligence officer status. In the mid-2000s, allegedly in return for avoiding prosecution on fraud charges, the FSB recruited Dmitry Dokuchayev, a prolific Russian hacker who operated under the online handle “Forb”, as an officer in its cyber function. Dokuchayev, who was also subject to charges of cybercrime in the US, was convicted of treason in April 2019 for leaking Russian government documents to the US. Such arrangements led to a peculiar situation where one part of the intelligence infrastructure used criminals to hack for the state, while other parts investigated them doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often, however, Russian agency relationships with cyber gangs appear to have fallen more into the categories of orchestrated or sanctioned relationships. In some instances, available detail suggests careful choreography between the state and criminals. Drawing on law enforcement sources, a New York Times investigation in 2017 suggested that Evgeniy Bogachev, an alleged Russian cyber-criminal subject to US sanctions, coordinated his activities with the FSB, allowing the security agency to collect intelligence in systems he had penetrated for criminal purposes. Other evidence suggests some form of protective or enabling relationship between Russian agencies and Russian cyber-criminals. Most commonly, Russian cyber-criminals have provided support for state activity, in return for state agencies permitting cyber-criminal groups to undertake criminality overseas, especially against states perceived to be hostile to Russia, a relationship type cyber experts Michael McLaughlin and William Holstein compare to the English state issuing letters ofmarque to naval privateers in the Elizabethan era. Cyber journalist Raphael Satter notes, for example, that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;some ransomware groups write it into their code that they do not deploy against machines that run Russian on their keyboards … [which] gives you some idea of what may be some informal deals being struck between the state or elements of the state and cyber criminal groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the cyber sphere remains a fluid realm, and the connections between Russian agencies and cybercrime might well have become closer in recent years as a result of the war in Ukraine. The war has had an apparently radicalising effect on some Russian cybercrime groups, leading them to align more closely with the Russian state. An exemplar is the leading ransomware group, Conti, which declared its allegiance to the Russian state in early 2022. A massive breach of the group’s data by a Ukrainian hacker revealed how this relationship had developed, with the group’s online conversations and files indicating ongoing contact with Russian state agencies over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian approach is mirrored to a degree by the Iranian model, although the Iranians operate on a far smaller scale. As Moore notes, while having official cyber capabilities in the MOIS and IRGC, Iran is highly dependent on outsourcing to provide capacity. Past cases of Iran state-linked hacking have involved apparently legitimate Iranian businesses. It seems that Iran also draws on a wide range of other non-state actors – academics, activists and criminals – to supplement its state resources and, in Moore’s words, “to generate an image of capacity it does not have”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Russia and Iran, China’s cyber operations appear to fall more closely under the control of the MSS and the Strategic Support Force of the PLA. But, according to cyber intelligence firm Mandiant, there is additional evidence that some Chinese “state” hackers also act as hybrids, hacking targets selected by the Chinese government during office hours, then pursuing other personal interests for pleasure and profit in the evening. Intriguingly, APT 17, believed to be run by the Jinan bureau of the MSS, uses the same cyber tradecraft as APT41, which sells its skills for hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSS and the PLA have also sought to gather commercial and defence-related intelligence using cyber groups with limited connections to the state, as well as cultivating a network of what are often described as “patriotic hackers”, which they occasionally direct to attack targets on an ad hoc basis. Nonetheless, while China’s relations with cyber-criminals appear to still be more carefully managed than those of Russia, there have been recent indications of growing collaboration. For example, when Chinese state hackers penetrated the Microsoft Exchange servers in March 2021, it appears they deliberately left an exposed vulnerability, which cyber-criminals took advantage of to steal data for illicit use. This suggests an intimate choreography between state agencies and hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like China, North Korea also relies primarily on state cyber groups. These are part of the RGB, which recruits young people with relevant aptitudes trained from an early age specifically to work in cyber. In this tightly controlled society, there is less space in which an indigenous cyber underground can develop, and thus more limited non-state cyber resources for the North Korean state to draw upon; indeed, reporting suggests that private North Korean hackers are more likely operating in opposition to the state than for it. Within Pyongyang’s state-developed cyber cadre, however, there is evidence that state groups, like those in China, do conduct their own criminal activities, or are given the latitude to do so. North Korean cyber groups have also worked with foreign cyber-criminals to improve their tooling. Research by Alex O’Neill, who has studied North Korean cyber operations at the Harvard Kennedy School, suggests that North Korean state actors have used Russian language sites on the dark web to contact Russian groups and commission them to develop malware on their behalf. If North Korea does not use cyber-criminals to undertake hostile acts, therefore, it is more than happy to work with them in furtherance of its own activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terrorists and militias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final type of relevant non-state actors are those with political and religious agendas, and a willingness to use violence to pursue them: terrorists and militias. State-sponsored terrorism was noted in section 4 as a potential vector for hostile activity, whether as a form of direct attack and intimidation, or as a more general way to generate political instability in a targeted state. It naturally follows, then, that politically violent groups might play a role in undertaking them. The most clear-cut case is Iran, which has worked with Hezbollah, Hamas and others to mount attacks in the Middle East, and to a lesser extent beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This said, however, and as noted previously, widespread contemporary state use of violent groups for covert violent purposes is mixed at best; there is little to suggest their widespread use by Russia, while Iran’s relations with an array of terrorist groups and militias seem to focus as much on commercial, criminal and other types of collaboration, as on hostile activity (see 4.4.5 ‒ Terrorism). Iranian connections with its self-described Axis of Resistance are complex, moreover, and, as historian Rouzbeh Parsi notes, more often amount to a partnership than a proxy arrangement. This is most evident in the case of Lebanese Hezbollah, which, despite its heavy financial dependence on Iran, retains wide operational autonomy, and works jointly with the IRGC and other Iranian partners in enterprises such as creating illicit revenue from sanctioned oil sales. But Hezbollah is not unique. Yemen expert Baraa Shiban observed in interview that although the relationship between Iran and the Houthis of Yemen is often presented as one of sponsor and proxy, it is much more complicated in reality. While the Houthis’ religious sensibilities have affinities with the Shia Islam of the Iranian regime, they are not identical. Moreover, the Houthi leadership does not see itself as Iran’s proxy, but as an ally “with shared enemies, in particular Saudi Arabia”. As Shiban commented, “they have a common interest in reducing Saudi Arabian influence and keeping the West out of the region”. While these groups have taken leading roles in conducting attacks against Iran’s regional enemies, therefore, it is far too simplistic to suppose that they do so purely at Iran’s behest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;53-conclusion&quot;&gt;5.3. Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing the threads together, it is apparent that although some observers frame the current geopolitical situation as “Cold War II”, the current growth in clandestine and covert activities is not the monochrome spy game many imagine the original Cold War to have been. State actors or those close to them remain the key point of origin for the initiation of state threats, and even when adhocrats like Prigozhin act without clear orders, they are acting on a perceived state need, or with what they believe to be the probable approval of the political elite. Freelancing is thus undertaken in the context of a shared sense of overall state objectives. State operatives also continue to be key players in executing state threats. Intelligence officers ‒ declared and undeclared, military and civilian ‒ are ubiquitous. But the variety of types of non-state actors also involved in hostile acts, either as partners or proxies, has grown in range and nature. The players in the covert world are as diverse as they have ever been, and among them, some (organised and cyber-criminals) have become especially important because of their unique skills, reach and access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-analysing-state-threats&quot;&gt;6. Analysing state threats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous two sections provide something like a map of the current landscape of state threats, although, much like pre-Mercator cartography, it remains more conceptual than precisely physical. In the absence of detailed quantitative data, it is difficult to provide a confident analysis of the salience of a particular threat type, or threat actor, or how different elements within the landscape relate to one another. In short, it is not possible to assess the volumes, patterns and relationships within the data with the kind of accuracy that would satisfy a social scientist. Nevertheless, the conceptual map does suggest some initial observations and hypotheses about the state threats phenomenon as whole, as well as the patterns of behaviour of specific countries, which could be tested with more data-driven rigour at a future point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;61-prevalence-of-threat-vectors&quot;&gt;6.1. Prevalence of threat vectors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A natural starting point is to measure the prevalence of various types of threat vectors. We currently lack the hard quantitative data to do this, but even if (or when) such data can be compiled, the results of any “count” will need to be handled carefully. Due to the differing characters of types of hostile acts, some are much easier to count than others. Some hostile actions, which might best be seen as events, are by their nature more straightforward, because they are time limited and more likely to register in the media or public consciousness. This could include an overt military incursion, an assassination or a coup. Other types of hostile actions might be better understood as processes, containing a pattern of activities, probably happening at a lower register, possibly over a longer duration, such as espionage, subversion or malign influence campaigns. These are much less easy to discern and log. At this point, therefore, we have to recognise that we do not know what we do not know, and accept that any judgements of relative prevalence for different types of state threats remain impressionistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the nature of open source reporting, driven as it tends to be by the discrete, episodic and sensational, it would be easy to conclude that there are many more event than process-style hostile actions. However, what hard data are available suggest that the reality could well be the other way around. For example, the DCID shows that 61% of all state-linked hostile cyber activities in the database relate to espionage, not cyber effects operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If processes dominate over events across the state threats landscape, there could be several reasons for this. Process activities such as espionage are “business as usual” for intelligence agencies; they are more likely to be part of an agency’s routinised processes. They are also likely to be less resource intensive, lower risk and open to at least partial “industrialisation”, especially where technology can be used. By contrast, event-style actions typically require more planning, resources and risk management, and are more kinetic, dangerous and reputationally risky. In addition, event-style actions are harder to routinise, as they are also potentially dictated by external schedules, such as the movements of a targeted dissident or electoral cycles, or the irruption of unexpected events a state might seek to take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What of overall trends in volume between different types of hostile activity? As set out in section 2, one of the reasons why governments are discussing state threats now is the evidence that the volume of threats is rising. Openly available information seems to bear this out. Among these threat vectors, the scale of Chinese commercial espionage conducted both through cyber techniques and human collection continues to stand out as a cause of great concern to Western agencies; Anne Keast-Butler, the head of GCHQ, described it as an “epoch-defining challenge” in May 2024. However, other types of hostile activities besides Chinese commercial espionage are also becoming more salient, especially since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. They include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open coercion&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Heavy metal diplomacy and border incursions of various types appear to be on the rise in both Europe and Asia, seen, for example, in Russia’s jamming of the global positioning system in widening areas of eastern Europe, and Chinese vessels’ regular clashes at sea with those of the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sabotage&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ There has been a marked rise in Russia-organised or -inspired physical sabotage in European countries, usually targeting supply chains supporting the Ukrainian war effort. China has shown increasing willingness to undertake cyber operations that show indications of preparation for future acts of cybotage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malign influence&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ A growing number of cases of espionage and linked covert influence operations by both Russia and China were reported in European and Five Eyes states in 2023 and 2024. The intensity of the reporting probably reflects the fruition of investigations by Western agencies against long-term operations by Russia and China, suggesting that these efforts at malign influence are not emerging as such, but reflect a longer-term trend; however, the coincidence of recent reported cases remains notable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond questions of proportion, scale and trend are those of relationship and pattern; in other words, are certain types of hostile activity commonly used together, and if so, what are the most salient correlations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted in section 4, there is a certain fuzziness around different types of clandestine and covert action, with blurred lines and potential for multiple parallel effects that can intimidate, cause physical damage, and influence perceptions, opinions and even policy. From the evidence of the previous sections, there is a clear nexus between dramatic hostile actions, and the subsequent deployment of subversive information techniques. Border incidents, military near misses, assassinations, sabotage operations and stimulated migration flows have all been used to shape misleading narratives that lay the blame on others, or make spurious claims of Western ineptitude, hypocrisy or deceit. In the case of the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in 2018, Russian officials made various spurious and contradictory counter-claims, suggesting the poisoning itself was a Western hoax or that the toxin used was made in the West. These allegations were then recycled through Russian online disinformation ecosystem, and partly as a result, reported further in the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Kilcullen notes, different types of hostile actions can also be used in combination for potential strategic effect, or as part of an escalatory ladder; he identifies two styles of approach in the liminal/grey-zone space: “horizontal escalation”, which increases the intensity of hostile action within initial boundaries, and “vertical escalation”, which expands across geographies and different styles of attack, creating what he describes as a “bandwidth” problem for an opponent. Russia has produced several multi-pronged campaigns of horizontal escalation against former Soviet republics since 2000. One of the earliest examples was a campaign against Estonia in April 2007, where a local government decision in Estonia to move a Soviet war memorial triggered a succession of online disinformation, cyber attacks against Estonian institutions, riots by Russian speakers, physical attacks on the Estonian ambassador in Moscow, and the severing of rail links between Estonia and Russia. Georgia and Ukraine were also subjected to similar campaigns in the run-up to, and alongside, direct Russian military action in 2008, 2014 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, Russia has also learned to switch between different techniques, depending on the levels of success achieved. An example comes from Russian malign influence operations in Europe, where attempts to Schroederise political and business elites did not lead to the hoped-for pro-Russian pivot in European foreign policy. Consequently, Russia switched its efforts towards cultivating figures on the political fringes in the West, as a form of leverage against the mainstream political elites it had largely failed to capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While less well practised in escalatory choreography than Russia, China has also combined hostile measures on occasion. Taiwan has been the main target, most recently before the Taiwanese presidential election in January 2024. The Chinese campaign included a crescendo of verbal threats, cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and naval drills off the coast of the island. China has also used combined hostile actions against states that have challenged it politically. Australia’s demand for an enquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in April 2020 led China to impose heavy tariffs and other trade restrictions. At the same time, however, Australia was also subject to a series of unattributed cyber attacks on the public and private sectors, which the Australian government assessed to have been executed by a “sophisticated state-based cyber actor”. External observers took this to mean a Chinese APT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;62-initiation-and-execution-of-threats&quot;&gt;6.2. Initiation and execution of threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of reliable information on the inner workings of many regimes makes it especially difficult to assess whether there is a correlation between initiating actors and specific types of hostile acts. However, some reasonable probabilities emerge from the evidence. Firstly, in most cases, it seems probable that the initiator of a hostile act will be a state actor of some sort, whether a senior leader, official or intelligence officer. While states such as Russia allow wide latitude for entrepreneurialism favourable to the state’s strategic objectives, this only goes so far; initiating hostile activity on a state’s behalf is not a right that appears open to all. Secondly, it seems likely that lower-risk process activities such as standard disinformation campaigns or ongoing espionage – the business-as-usual elements of the covert world – are initiated by less senior figures, on a more routine basis, but may also offer scope for adhocrats and entrepreneurs to offer their services. Finally, it also seems probable that higher-risk event-type actions, such as high-profile assassinations, or focused combined campaigns of activities, are initiated, or at the very least greenlit, by more senior officials and political leaders. Overall, the pattern is likely to be the that the more routine and less risky the hostile activity, the wider the range of potential initiators at different levels of authority there are likely to be, with the converse being the case for episodic and higher-risk acts. This hypothesis is set out visually in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hLoX1bu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Risk, periodicity and potential authority required.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Q=Quadrant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Q1 – more routine and higher-risk activities – are likely to be treated as basic business by intelligence agencies, but might be higher risk depending on the nature of the target; in these instances, activities are most likely to be initiated by agencies on their own authority, with occasional requests for external sign-off. In Q2 activities are both high risk and rare, and likely to require higher levels of sponsorship within a state. In Q3, actions are both low risk and relatively routine, and are likely to be undertaken without any high-level involvement. Activities in Q4 – low risk and episodic – may paradoxically require higher levels of sign-off simply because of their relative rarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an admittedly broad-brush approach to the question of the relationship between operation types and sign-off levels, but we have more to go on with regard to potential correlations between the types of operatives used and types of operations. Figure 3 gives a conceptual visual representation of the patterns in the evidence reviewed for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Sq3Ijbq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Involvement of actor type in relation to types of hostile action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are no fixed rules, it is clear that state operatives are most likely to be involved in the broadest range of hostile activities. It also seems more likely that they will be tasked to undertake activities that involve higher risks, and/or where significant resources are required, such as high-profile assassinations, physical sabotage or sophisticated cyber effects operations. As noted, Russia’s GRU Unit 29155 is thought to have played a central role in violent hostile acts across Europe over many years. However, state agencies do not have a monopoly on kinetic or disruptive activities. PMCs, OCGs and cyber-criminals have played important auxiliary roles in acts of violent intimidation, sabotage and destabilisation. Both Russia and Iran have used criminals to assassinate lower-profile opponents overseas, rather than deploy state operatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, revisionist states appear to use legitimate and/or civilian non-state actors for actions that are less likely to be risky or violent. China, with its whole-of-society approach” to intelligence, has also encouraged legitimate actors in civil society to conduct lower-risk activities, such as passive intelligence collection. Revisionist states will also use legitimate businesses as contractors to support and enable some non-physical hostile activities such as basic cybotage and disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of factors probably influence the relationship between the risk of a given hostile activity and the type of actor used. Some activities will ideally require high levels of skill and professionalism. State actors initiating hostile acts are thus unlikely to outsource activities of great significance – a high-profile assassination, for instance ‒ to actors over which they have limited control, or in whom they have limited confidence. In contrast, other hostile activities, such as pushing online disinformation, are much lower risk and thus easier to leave to non-state actors. However, pragmatic operational requirements will also be important, especially when non-state actors have niche expertise or geographic access that state actors do not. Some non-state actors also offer a better option for deniability ‒ a particular benefit of working with OCGs or terrorists, who will be expected to be involved in illicit activities anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;63-the-place-of-cyber&quot;&gt;6.3. The place of cyber&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If states are showing a propensity to outsource a variety of hostile activities to non-state actors, there is also ample evidence of states increasingly using cyber tools as way to act at a distance and improve deniability. The development of the cyber sphere has allowed states to access a far wider range of secret, sensitive and open source data than ever before, with the potential to access systemic vulnerabilities in any institution’s computer-based systems that are linked to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while it is important to note that although cyber has massively expanded the scope and range of espionage, sabotage and subversion, it has not removed the need for human operatives. Cyber espionage and effects operations often rely on human operatives finding initial vulnerabilities in targeted institutions. Disinformation campaigns on social media, moreover, while routinely amplified using automated bots, still need humans to identify and deploy narratives in the first instance. Many other types of hostile acts also entail physical actions – breaking into a building, stealing assets, physical intimidation, assassination, or influencing an individual in face-to-face discussion – which cannot be done, or done well, via a computer. Humans are thus far from redundant in the world of state threats; in reality, cyber has supplemented and augmented the capabilities and reach of human operatives, rather than made them obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;64-gaps-and-constraints&quot;&gt;6.4. Gaps and constraints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is apparent, the current range of state threats is vast. But it is not necessarily as wide as it might be, as historic experience from the Cold War suggests. There are also options that have been used in the past, but which are not being deployed now, or imaginative new possibilities that have yet to be explored. Table 4 provides a range of possible examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hFfT5uP.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4: Types of hostile actions not currently observed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative absence of these types of measures from the current stable of methods used reflects various constraints. Some, such as kinetic cyber effects operations, might be technically difficult to achieve. Other constraints might relate to state actors’ own ethical or political limits, or an assessment that these types of acts are likely to trigger reciprocal action, escalation or unintended consequences. The US government reportedly considered taking funds from the personal accounts of Serbian president Slobodan Milošević in the 1990s, in retaliation for his genocidal policies in Kosovo, but decided against this course of action out of fear it might lead to reciprocal action against Western leaders. The absence of terrorism as a tool of hostile state activity probably reflects the stigma attached to it since 9/11, and the ubiquity of the problem across the globe; states are probably less likely to enable violent acts of terrorists if they too face a terrorist threat that could be encouraged and aided from outside. Indeed, it is one of the areas of security where the US, Russia and China saw common interests and cooperated in the early 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another apparent lacuna in the contemporary state threats landscape is an absence of collaboration between the main users of hostile acts against common opponents. Since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, media reporting has documented an increasing number of areas where Iran, North Korea and Russia, and to a lesser extent China, have expanded cooperation. Both Iran and North Korea have provided Russia with materiel such as drones and artillery shells, despite a variety of relevant UN and Western sanctions; China, meanwhile, has strengthened its political and economic ties with both Russia and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison, there are fewer indications that these states are collaborating extensively in the covert realm, although some areas of cooperation do seem to have begun to develop. One is cyber operations and capabilities; North Korea has used operatives based in China to conduct cyber activities in the past, and as previously noted, has worked with Russian OCGs to develop its malware capabilities. Russia is also reported to have been helping to develop Iran’s cyber weapons. A further area of evolving cooperation is disinformation, where Chinese, Russian and Iranian state-linked social media have consistently recycled and repeated one another’s anti-Western narratives, with a significant convergence during the Covid-19 pandemic. Analysts have seen a confluence of approaches between these actors in recent years; Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center suggested in November 2023 there was a real risk that China, Iran and Russia would work together to influence the US 2024 presidential race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons behind these states’ limited levels of covert joint working are not wholly surprising, however. Regardless of their closeness, there are obvious sensitivities around covert and clandestine operations; no state can be confident that shared intelligence and capabilities might not be passed on surreptitiously to another party, or potentially used against them at some future date if the relationship sours. In addition, beyond their shared opposition to US hegemony and a dislike of the Western rules-based approach to international affairs, these states also have many well-established reasons not to trust one another. Although China and Russia are partners, they still have differing interests; one leading China expert, who wished to remain anonymous, explained in interview, “while China prefers stability, Russia has made a habit of stirring up chaos”. And while Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are broadly speaking authoritarian states, the ideologies they espouse are distinct and united only by a common dislike of the West. As Middle East expert Alex Vatanka notes of Iran:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;an Islamist regime that claims to be carrying out Allah’s wishes on earth … counts among its treasured foreign partners an atheist China and a Russia led by a self-declared champion of Christianity. It is not a common set of values that brings them together, but rather the desire to preserve their own power and limit their sense of isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;65-country-level-analysis&quot;&gt;6.5. Country-level analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The many overlapping commonalities in the patterns of behaviour of the core revisionist states makes it possible to talk in general terms about their patterns of hostile activity. But despite the similarities and overlaps, the four main countries of interest have their own particularities and emphases in their approaches. Colin Gray, a British-US scholar of strategic studies, referred to the divergent “strategic cultures” of national militaries, shaped by history, broader culture, the political system and a wide set of geopolitical conditions. To an extent, distinctive national patterns have also emerged in the state threats landscape too, despite the many similarities between the four countries’ methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6.5.1. Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is by far the most daring and energetic of states in the realm of state threats, conducting what Galeotti has described as “an aggressive geopolitical campaign to assert its claims to great-power status and also undermine Western capacities to constrain it”. The campaign has several pronounced characteristics, which, while not uniform, are consistent and recurrent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia is aggressive, action oriented and kinetic&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Russia’s willingness to use violence and threats against critics and enemies overseas seems to far exceed the boundaries of most other states, both overtly, through heavy metal diplomacy, and economic and diplomatic threats, and covertly too. It is currently deeply involved in acts of physical sabotage across Europe, and is highly active in cyber effects operations, described by cyber expert Moore, as “arguably the most prolific government deployer of event-based capabilities”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia is deeply rooted in traditional espionage&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Espionage remains of core importance to Russia, and it continues to target Western military and political intelligence, collected through both human and technical sources. The Council on Foreign Relations database on government-sponsored cyber incidents attributes 193 incidents to a Russian government-affiliated threat actor, of which 139 were espionage; of those, 91 were directed at government or military collection targets. Russia also collects economic intelligence relevant to core Russian industries such as hydrocarbons, foreign views of Russia and investigations into Russia-related incidents such as the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in July 2014, or the potential use of chemical weapons by the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria in 2017. Russia also sees espionage as a foundation of and fundamental precursor to covert action. As Riehle notes, in all the “widely publicized cases of covert election meddling … Russia’s intelligence collection preceded covert action”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia exploits hybrid, grey-zone and weaponisation techniques, but not for their own sake&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Russia has been adept at mixing various techniques to collect intelligence. Cyber collection has been combined with well-worn human methods of tradecraft, with agencies recruiting foreign sources in traditional ways. The use of money as a lure has become increasingly important, as Russian operatives have leveraged the flows of illicit cash that have become available since the fall of the USSR. As one former State Security Committee (KGB) officer explained to Catherine Belton, “[in] black-cash operations Russia has developed a weapon more powerful than anything it has ever possessed before”. In covert activities such as intimidation, sabotage and subversion, Russia has also demonstrated a willingness to supplement traditional means with a variety of other methods, “choosing from a buffet of belligerence and deploying them in different combinations to suit specific situations”, according to Giles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia uses both state and non-state actors as operatives, but state relationships with non-state actors are more pragmatic than programmatic&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Russia uses a wide range of actors to execute hostile activities; indeed, it is arguably the state which uses the widest spectrum of different types of “operatives”. Nonetheless, this should not detract from the preeminent role Russian intelligence agencies continue to play, or suggest that non-state actors are necessarily the preferred operatives. As Riehle noted in interview, “the decision to use a criminal over an intelligence officer for a particular activity such as assassination will be contextual, rather than bureaucratic”. Such a decision will depend on multiple factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, the importance of the operation, the risks entailed, and the available resources and levels of access to the target.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia is often untargeted and attritional&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Russia’s approach to hostile activity is biased towards the use of volume and attrition in attack, rather than precision strikes. Kalensky explained during interview that in the disinformation space, Russia usually seeks to “overwhelm the resistance of targets by sheer volume and velocity of information flow”. In a separate interview, cyber expert Jason Kikta observed a similar pattern in how Russian cyber effects operations are conducted, with agencies and other operators using a “throw everything at it” approach, leading to “high volumes of indiscriminate and random activity” in the cyber realm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia can be flexible&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Despite a willingness to keep up long-term and attritional campaigns, Russia will also switch tactics, depending on results. Until the annexation of Crimea, Russia followed what Lough has described as a “dual strategy of … charming and pressurising”, with Russia retaining close ties with Western political and business elites, minimising active measures against the West, while applying aggressive measures against the states of the former USSR and Warsaw Pact countries. However, this pivoted in response to hostile Western reactions to the annexation, with Russia turning away from engagement with what are known in Germany as “Putin-Verstehers” (“Putin empathisers”) – mainstream political figures who had shown Putin the benefit of the doubt in the past – towards the radical political fringes of right and left.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia is resourceful and exploitative&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Russia has also shown itself willing to use the opportunities afforded by successful covert actions to open up new fronts or use successes as a springboard for further adventitious activity. The state-encouraged migration crisis on the Russian and Belarusian borders has not only been a useful means to pressure Western societies and welfare systems, but to generate material to support information operations that aggravate anti-immigrant sentiment in European countries, and provide opportunities to insert intelligence assets into refugee flows that can later be used for espionage, sabotage and subversion. Mandiant has also noted how the GRU will often use espionage operations as platforms from which to undertake cyber effects operations, showing no real adherence to a strict categorisation of activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia tends to escalate rather than back down&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ This willingness to switch approaches also points to a comfort with escalation. The most blatant example is the progressive intensification of Russian activity against Ukraine since 2000, which culminated in a full-scale conventional war. Owen et al. observe of several eastern European cases that when “Putin’s Russia is unable to attain foreign policy goals through corruption … it might well do so via force later on”. Russia also now seems increasingly open to escalation against Western targets too. As Giles describes, since 2014, Russia has become “more and more willing to reach into Western countries and do direct harm, through sabotage, murders and assassinations, undisguised electronic warfare, false-flag cyber-attacks and more”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia is tolerant of risks&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Russia seems much more willing to act despite the high risk of failure and public discovery, and will skirt the line between overt and covert action, often behaving in ways that provide an easy trail leading back to its operatives. While some experts simply explain this as poor tradecraft, others believe that the recklessness is part of the point of the action. For example, even though the operation to kill Sergei Skripal failed and its operatives were publicly identified, it sent a message to enemies of the Russian state. As Cormac writes: “you cannot escape the past; we can come for you; you can never relax”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia’s methods are ethically and legally questionable&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Russia appears more willing to breach norms of legality, ethics and proportionality typical to Western states. In both the Skripal case, and the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko, Russian operatives used weapons-grade chemical and radiological materials, which not only promised a horrific death for the targets, but risked the lives of innocent bystanders; indeed, in the Skripal case, the only individual to die was UK national Dawn Sturgess, who had no connection to the Skripals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia is as interested in psychological as physical effects&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ In addition to Russia’s interest in tangible outcomes to clandestine and covert action, it also shows a pronounced interest in creating intangible psychological effects on its targets, especially by using information operations. Russia’s widespread involvement in online disinformation, hacking and leaking operations, and other forms of political electoral interference, show a consistent assumption on the part of Russia that shaping the psychological landscapes of opponents or targets is extremely valuable and important.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s style and method of approach towards hostile activity might therefore be summed up as committed and adaptive. The underlying spirit of Russian hostile activity is a persistent attempt to wrong-foot opponents by acting outside expectations and norms. Much like Keyser Söze, the shadowy villain of the film The Usual Suspects, Russia’s modus operandi is to try to appear willing to “to do what the other guy wouldn’t”. However, the image of sinister brilliance Russia seeks to project is not always matched by its performance; Russia can also be wasteful, messy, reckless and pointlessly transgressive (see section 8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6.5.2. China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While China does not completely eschew the kind of aggressive moves exhibited by Russia, it prefers to resort to them only when necessary, what Economy terms China’s “Iron Fist in a Velvet Glove” approach. As Allen notes, China places great value on using tools and policies that appear to bring positive benefits to a target state, but which, in her words, also have a “dual function” if needed for more malign purposes. As a result, the characteristics and contours of China’s activities seem relatively less threatening than Russia’s, calibrated to avoid direct confrontations with the US and other Western powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China is heavily focused on commercial and knowledge-focused espionage&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Espionage has become increasingly important to the Chinese effort to secure economic, commercial and technological secrets that help it to catch up with, and surpass, US economic and military power. According to Eftiamides’s figures on recent Chinese intelligence activities, China’s major espionage effort have focused on commercial, scientific and educational targets in California’s Silicon Valley, New England, Florida and Texas, whose areas of expertise correlate closely with the technological priorities of China’s “Made in China 2025” industrial policy. Only 25% of China’s espionage or covert action operations have therefore been against traditional political and military targets. This knowledge-focused espionage is occurring on a grand scale, even collecting data that have no immediate use or are inaccessible due to encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China makes substantial if not exclusive use of cyber tools in espionage&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ A significant proportion of China’s espionage effort is conducted through cyber incursions. But even so, the human element remains important, and China continues to use classic techniques to recruit human sources, or to run undercover operations. Social media has played a vital role in China’s efforts to identify and cultivate potential new sources, but this is only a starting point, and also relies on human relationship building and face-to-face interaction to bear fruit. As Eftiamides describes, therefore, much Chinese espionage is thus in fact “HUMINT enabled cyber espionage”, rather than pure cyber espionage&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China takes a whole-of-society approach, but state and party agencies are central to its efforts&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ The breadth of China’s espionage efforts have demonstrated the role all Chinese individuals, businesses and organisations have in intelligence collection. Indeed, Chinese national laws mandate that all Chinese businesses and nationals work with intelligence agencies, both at home and abroad. This has led some to propose a “1,000 grains of sand” theory of Chinese intelligence collection, which as China expert Joske describes, is based on a vision of China sending “a stream of tourists to the beach in broad daylight, each picking up a single grain”, which can be “analysed and aggregated to form a brilliant picture” back in Beijing. However, Joske argues that this is probably something of an overstatement, as MSS and PLA officers, embedded in all sectors of Chinese society, remain China’s core operatives. It also appears that, although China maintains relations with non-state actors such as commercial contractors, “patriotic” Triads and cyber-criminals, they lack the range and magnitude of those in Russia; for example, most of China’s identified hacking groups are affiliated with either the MSS or the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China is focused on building its own image and reputation&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Economy argues that China sees the wide acceptance of its narratives and perspectives as a key tool in its campaign for global pre-eminence; but while China wishes primarily to promote a positive image of itself, it is eager to silence its critics too. As Mao Zedong stated, a strong reputation, enhanced through “united front work”, was one of the CCP’s “magic weapons” alongside the armed struggle to defeat its enemies. China has therefore used less obtrusive techniques of subversion than Russia, seeking to push the narrative of China’s peaceful rise as a way to anaesthetise and numb Western governments, rather than exploit social divisions to cause confusion and chaos. However, it has cracked down hard on negative counter-narratives. Accordingly, China’s harshest intimidatory, disruptive and subversive measures are directed at domestic dissidents and Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China takes a twin-track approach to regional and global opponents&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ China takes an aggressive stance towards local opponents such as Taiwan. According to Taiwanese government figures, the island faces 30 million cyber attacks a month, half of which come from China. By contrast, much of China’s overt hostility towards the West has a performative feel, based on a combination of harsh rhetoric and the primary use of economics as a tool of coercion, such as trade bans on some Australian exports in 2020, the last of which was lifted in March 2024. China’s favoured approach to getting what it wants from Western countries is to weaponise access to the Chinese market, with the threat of its loss used to put pressure on Western business interests, and from there, governments. As Allen comments, “companies and countries around the world increasingly see … [China] as vital to their prosperity,” a perception China then uses “to incentivize adherence to its most fundamental geopolitical objectives”. In more obviously combative spheres of operation, China has proved equally cautious. It has mostly sidestepped major physical sabotage or cyber effects operations, and was “notable by its absence”, according to Cormac in external efforts to meddle in the 2020 US presidential election. China has become more aggressive in the disinformation and cyber effects spheres since the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is not yet clear this amounts to a permanent switch in behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China takes an indirect, “guerrilla” approach to its operations&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Following the guerrilla thinking of the Mao era, China often tests rivals by using multiple small probes which, as Kilcullen describes, pose “a bandwidth challenge … by expanding the spectrum of competition beyond … [a] rival’s capacity to cope”. Where resistance is weak, China will press its advantage; where resistance is strong, China will step back and bide its time or switch approach ‒ there is no timetable per se, and methods and routes of travel can vary, although the intended objective will remain the same. China will also seek out unguarded vulnerabilities, a technique known as nongcun baowei chengshi or “using the local to surround the center”. Malign influence operations, such as that which allegedly targeted Eric Swalwell, will often focus those at an early stage of their career, operating in local rather than national politics, exploiting their naiveté and obscurity, and laying the groundwork for more valuable exploitation if the target reaches the national stage at some future point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Russia is free-wheeling and confrontational, therefore, China exhibits greater discipline, control and risk aversion. If China can achieve its aims by apparently fair rather than foul means, it will do so. As the previously quoted anonymous China expert noted in interview, China sees itself as “a stabiliser, not a disrupter”. China has “a passion for stability and order”, and although willing to accept a certain amount of chaos if it causes problems for the US, views too much as a danger to its own political interests. Nonetheless, China does not shy away from tough measures or underhand behaviour, and it has become expert in manoeuvring around Western institutional defences, rather than attacking them directly. Alluding to the writings of Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu, Eftiamides explained in interview that the Chinese approach was conceived as being like “running water, flowing into the vulnerabilities and openings left by opponents”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6.5.3. Iran&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 1979 revolution, the Iranian regime has also followed an indirect strategy in confronting its opponents. Examples of overt hostility towards the US and Western states have tended to be acts of performative defiance; for example, mistreating dual nationals such as British-Iranian teacher Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, imprisoned in Tehran between 2017 and 2022, or shadowing and occasionally boarding Western oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. In the covert sphere, Iran has been more aggressive, and has made great use of cyber tools to support espionage, disinformation campaigns and disruption. However, as Moore notes, underlying Iranian caution means that cyber operations are more likely to focus on soft targets in the private sector or civil society, where the aim is to “exact a cost from otherwise capable adversaries by targeting their population directly”. Nonetheless, while recognising that some of Iran’s cyber operations lack professionalism, Moore also argues that for a country of its size and resources, it “can punch above its weight”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran’s other hostile activities are conducted against local rivals such as Israel and Saudi Arabia; when acts are undertaken against Western states, these are more likely to take place in “neutral” regions such as Latin America or Africa, and involve partners such as Hezbollah. In such circumstances, moreover, Iranian agencies, especially the IRGC, play the role of orchestrator and enabler of non-state actors’ attacks on Western interests, rather than being a direct participant. Working with non-state actors is a critical and largely intentional element in Iran’s approach, moreover, including not only terrorist groups and militias, but other legitimate and illicit actors. As noted previously, the IRGC has contracted commercial providers for online disinformation cyber operations, and used OCGs to target dissidents in Europe for assassination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;6.5.4. North Korea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea was responsible for many hostile overt and covert acts in the last century, including the attempted assassinations of South Korean presidents in 1968 and 1983, and terrorist bombings, such as the attack on Korean Air Flight 858 in November 1987. However, this kind of outrageous violence, if not completely absent from the regime’s current repertoire, is a less common aspect of its behaviour now, although it continues to mete out retribution against defectors’ families. To the extent that North Korea has pursued covert campaigns of espionage, physical sabotage, cyber effects operations and disinformation, activities have largely targeted South Korea. Alex O’Neill remarked, in an interview that took place while he was conducting research at Harvard University, “South Korea remains the North’s greatest target, in every sense, and to a lesser extent Japan and the United States”. Nonetheless, despite Pyongyang’s undoubted hatred for the South, many of its attacks have an air of comedic desperation, as exemplified by the spate of rubbish-filled balloons dispatched across the border in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wider world, North Korea’s antisocial behaviour is overwhelmingly concerned with generating much-needed funds to support the state. Cybercrime, described by Kim Jong Un as “an all-purpose sword” is the most important of these by far, leaving few countries untouched; even supposed “friends” such as Russia have been targeted. North Korea also has a history of collaborating with OCGs in illicit money-making, but in the past three decades, many of these associations have narrowed as the North Korean state has reduced its direct involvement in the distribution of illicit goods such as drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;66-conclusion&quot;&gt;6.6. Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing volumes and trends for various types of state threats is currently hard to achieve with any precision. However, while accepting these difficulties of comparison, some discernible and logical patterns do emerge, suggesting both continuity and innovation, and a measured view of what the growing wave of state threats means in practice. Event-style actions, while attracting more attention, are often riskier and require greater preparation. They are thus much less common than process-style activities; probably the most significant boom in activity has been in business-as-usual covert activities such as espionage and online disinformation campaigns, both of which can be magnified in effect by combining human operatives and cyber tools. It is also important to note that however reckless states can be, there continue to be apparent constraints on certain types of action, mostly around the use of lethal violence on a mass scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, although non-state actors are becoming more important to the execution of state threats, state actors remain at the core of the phenomenon, whether providing concrete orders, setting requirements or providing a “vibe” about what types of behaviour are expected or would be welcomed. It also remains the case that state operatives provide the operational backbone that ensures the execution of state threats. Others, especially criminals and PMCs, are certainly involved in a wide range of hostile activities, but they appear to be most often used where there is a call for niche skills or access, or require violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These general patterns accepted, significant national variations in modus operandi are also apparent. Russia has a much greater risk appetite than nearly any other state, followed by Iran and North Korea. China is more circumspect and cautious by comparison. Although there is a large common playbook of hostile activities, each state makes its own choices about which techniques to apply, framed by contextual factors such as resources and capabilities, but also by its underlying motives and objectives. The next section thus moves on to ask the question of why these states are using hostile actions as tools of policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-explaining-state-threats&quot;&gt;7. Explaining state threats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explaining the growth in contemporary state threats has two aspects. The first is motivational, a question of asking why certain states are behaving in a hostile manner. The second is practical, considering why states are expressing this hostility through sub-threshold, covert acts, rather than using more traditional means, such as diplomacy or even war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;71-explaining-hostility&quot;&gt;7.1. Explaining hostility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the cause of interstate antagonism has remained one of the most fundamental questions in international relations. Those of a realist persuasion see state hostility in terms of threats, interests and hard power calculations, while those with a more liberal perspective see conflict arising from clashes of values and ideologies, compounded by an absence of shared institutional structures and economic relationships. Views within both broad schools of interpretation are numerous, however, and scholars of one school or the other can take very different approaches to the same issue. Unfortunately, there is no way to do justice to all realist and liberal interpretations of state antagonism here, let alone choose which one provides the most satisfying explanations. However, they do remind us that power and values are important potential causal factors in states’ behaviours, both of which need to be taken into account when understanding the growth of state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison to international relations, military scholarship has taken a more functional view of recent developments, showing how the process of military evolution – both technological and doctrinal – has helped shape how states behave in the current international environment, with much of the recent debate focusing on the role of technology. Many cyber security scholars argue that the rise of relatively accessible cyber weapons has been a great leveller between states, enabling even small states to take aggressive action at a low cost. They argue that states are becoming more hostile in the cyber sphere because they have the means to be so. In addition to these thematic perspectives, country-focused studies in domestic political science and history have also looked to understand the behaviour of particular states through their individual governance structures, histories, cultures and other distinctive factors. Although such interpretations usually accept the reality and influence of broader global trends, they naturally emphasise the primacy of domestic sources of international behaviour. This perspective implies that waves or patterns of international behaviour – such as greater interstate hostility – are more likely to be the result of the coincidental alignment of several states’ separate political trajectories, rather than a single global phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this brief survey suggests, each style of interpretation has some intuitive strength. Power balances and calculations are fundamental to states’ understanding of their national security; a regime’s world-view and mindset will naturally tinge how it sees and thus reacts to the outside world; access to cheap offensive weapons makes it easter to take an aggressive path; and a state’s history and culture are bound to shape its fears, hopes and ambitions. However, none of these approaches alone is sufficient to explain the current state of international politics, and each has its problems. Realists often fail to give due attention to the role leaders’ personalities and regime ideologies play in framing power calculations; it is hard to believe that the second world war would have happened as it did without the peculiar perspectives of Hitler and the Nazi Party. Conversely, liberal scholars can also go awry by not taking power realities into account, or by applying too doctrinaire a view of the effect that regime type has on state behaviour. Despite the claims of some liberal democratic peace theorists, not all authoritarian states are aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explanations of strategic thinkers, who see increasing hostility as a natural result of the increasing effectiveness of offensive over defensive power, are similarly incomplete. They can show how new weapons and techniques enable states to be more hostile, but not why they might be more hostile; there is, after all, no requirement to use new weapons. As Smeets has shown, for example, a growing number of states have developed offensive cyber capabilities, which they have then only used in limited ways. Finally, country-focused historians and political scientists, while correctly emphasising the importance of national peculiarities in shaping state behaviour, can miss or downplay the effects of common interests, ideas and political predicaments shared by states at any given time. States following similar patterns of behaviour are not likely to be identical in motives and objectives, but any set of obvious “family resemblances”, in the phrase of philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, is unlikely to be wholly down to random chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7.1.1. A pragmatic approach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These various strengths and weaknesses thus need to be taken into account. Yes, power and power balances matter; systems and ideas matter; weapons and tools matter; history and culture matter. But state decision-making is far from monocausal or static; the dynamic interactions between power, interests, ideas, memory and much else besides shape state behaviour. As a consequence, this paper takes a pragmatic approach that draws on these schools of thought, but is not necessarily slavishly attached to them. Initially, it looks towards the fundamental mismatch between how major authoritarian states such as Russia and China, and the Western world, believe the international system should operate. It further explores how this difference has come to matter more as economic, political and military power balances have shifted against the Western world. Rising powers have expected to see a West that is more willing to make concessions, but their expectations have often been disappointed. After surveying the broader international environment, the section moves on to the distinctive situations of the main revisionist states. While they have a great deal in common – their dislike of Western global leadership in particular – a variety of influences mould their behaviour, such as the character of political leaders, regime ideology, economic strength and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding, it is important to note that what follows is not intended as an apologia for certain states’ activities, or as a critique of Western policy. Its aims are to understand and explain, rather than justify. While some of the roots of current interstate hostility are genuinely defensive from those states’ perspectives, it does not necessarily follow that this is reasonable or that their responses are justifiable. Moreover, the states in question clearly have their own revisionist agendas, which contradict much of their public rhetoric about the importance of sovereignty and international respect. While they might wish to paint themselves as victims, this is an incomplete view at best and a highly misleading one at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7.1.2. A clash of world-views&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broad context for the current situation is a profound difference in visions for the international system. Since the end of the Cold War, the US and other Western countries have promoted liberal democratic values and free markets (often called the Washington Consensus), a rules-based approach to international order, and an increasingly interventionist position on the international community’s right to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and to police domestic human rights, known as the Responsibility to Protect. This Western vision has long been a challenge for North Korea and Iran, whose attempts to follow idiosyncratic ideological paths and develop WMD and ballistic delivery systems – despite their international commitments – have put them at odds with most of the rest of the world, leading to international sanctions in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite a less obviously adversarial stance in the 1990s and 2000s, neither Russia nor China have been enamoured of the Western version of the international order. In fact, they have rejected many Western precepts and held to a traditional theory of international relations that stresses the inviolability of state sovereignty and the duty of non-interference in other states’ affairs. Both the Russian and Chinese governments have also expressed a preference for what they see as a stable and ordered world, managed by the great powers, a group in which they include themselves, rather than one where the US and its allies pursue the creation of an ideal international community of their own design. Although neither leading revisionist state seems to have a desire to export its model in detail, both Russia and China have shown support and encouragement for authoritarian regimes in the developing world. If they do not wish to promote authoritarianism per se, they have been eager to make the world a safe place for it to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while both Russia and China use noble rhetoric about the UN and present themselves as defenders of state sovereignty, their vision of world order is also deeply rooted in self-interest. Both countries’ views on sovereign equality and non-interference are qualified by a belief that great powers are different from other states; because of their status; they have the right to be consulted on all major global issues by their peers; and they have a special dispensation to pursue their interests in their respective regional spheres of influence. Despite the arguments of realists such as US political scientist John Mearsheimer that in some way revisionist state behaviours are being caused by ill-advised Western pressure, these states do have an expansive international agenda of change, independent of Western policy, and one which would not disappear if the US and the West more broadly took a different stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This difference in world-view between the West and revisionist states would of course remain theoretical and academic if there were no arenas in which they might actively conflict. However, over the past two decades, there have been multiple opportunities for friction to occur and increase. At its mildest, the Russians and Chinese have become aggravated at playing an inferior role to the US on the international stage, a position neither country, as self-understood great powers, believes is appropriate. US domination of international institutions such as the UN, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, has led many emerging powers to rail against a closed system designed for what they argue are Western interests alone. Both Russia and China have also opposed the Western use of force without UN Security Council approval ‒ first to defend human rights in Kosovo in 1999, then to tackle WMD proliferation in Iraq in 2003 – seeing the interventions as an affront to their right to be consulted and acts of hypocrisy by states that claim to support a rules-based order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More dangerously, the leading revisionist states have increasingly taken issue with the growth of Western alliances such as NATO, and most intensely in those regions they consider to be part of their spheres of influence. Not only do China and Russia see the development of multilateral alliances as inappropriate Western meddling in regions that do not concern them, they seem them as potential challenges to Russia and China’s territorial integrity and regime stability. The revolts of the Arab spring and the so-called “colour revolutions” in the states of the former USSR have caused particular anxieties, due to an inchoate fear that such revolts could be used by the West as grounds for providing material support to opposition groups, or justifying military intervention and regime change, as occurred in Libya in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some in the West see such fears as ludicrously paranoid, or even as disingenuous excuses for bad behaviour. Nonetheless, whether reasonable or otherwise, these fears are not completely without foundation in countries that historically have been vulnerable to invasion and bouts of political upheaval, as China, Iran and Russia all have been. At the same time, however, even if it is possible to empathise with these fears of the West and Western influence, they do not provide a good justification for the revisionist states’ desires to apply double standards to state sovereignty in their own spheres of influence. Nor, moreover, do they help us understand why hostile attitudes have translated into increasingly hostile behaviour towards the West in the past decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7.1.3. Changing power balances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the leading revisionist states have felt emboldened in recent years to take their own path, regardless of the views of governments in the West, and sometimes in active opposition to it. While this might in part reflect the accumulation of annoyances, disagreements and perceived slights of the past two decades, it is unlikely these would be sufficient to justify taking on the West without any reasonable hope of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rising level of confidence has come from somewhere, therefore, and is most probably connected to changes in global power balances, both concrete and perceptual. In the past two decades, global shares of economic strength have shifted dramatically from the US and its allies towards China and emerging economies represented by partnerships such as the Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) group. According to some estimates, the BRICS countries’ share of global gross domestic product (GDP) passed that of the Group of Seven (G7) major Western economies (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US) around 2020, with the BRICS representing 35.43% of world income in 2024, compared with the G7’s 29.64%. Historian Paul Kennedy argued in the 1980s that political and military strength, as well as the desire to use it, tend to follow in the wake of growing economic might, and this relationship seems to have held true in the current age. With their growing relative strength, states such as China and Russia have been increasingly emboldened to act on their disagreements with the West. As US analyst Thomas Wright has written, Russia, China and similarly minded states only “tolerated the liberal order when they were relatively weak”. However, the shifting balance of power has offered them the opportunity to pursue their interests, and both to defy and to assail the West in a way that was impossible or quixotic before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also seems likely that this power shift has triggered something like a bandwagon effect among the revisionist powers and possibly beyond; as one power appears more willing to challenge the current US-led international order without existential consequences, the more willing others become to emulate it. In just this vein, China expert Shogo Suzuki has argued that in recent years, the international system has witnessed the development of a subculture of states that reject Western norms, which he describes collectively as a “delinquent gang”. As revisionist states have become more powerful, their perspectives and behaviour have become validated in their own eyes and those of other states. As a result, any stigma that might have previously attached to perceived “bad” international behaviour has begun to dissipate. This is an accelerant not only for the revisionist states themselves, but for others who might follow their lead, enlarging the gang of delinquents further still. As Julien Bastrup-Birk, a RUSI associate fellow and former UK official, suggested in interview, “if the major powers like China start changing the rules of the game, others will follow their lead, resulting in a further erosion of the Westphalian model”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But an increased willingness to take a stand against the West has not just arisen from growing non-Western strength, but also an increasing perception that the West itself is in dramatic decline, a view held even within Western countries themselves. The global financial crisis of 2007-08 highlighted the weaknesses of the Western economic model, while the military and political failures of the interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq suggested that the US and its allies could no longer impose their will on other states as they had done in the past. With the US and its partners seeming like “paper tigers”, moreover, many non-Western states have begun to feel less fearful about acting against Western expectations, and less optimistic about receiving US support in the event of outside aggression. In the words of Ivan Krastev, a political scientist, such states “are determined to be at the table and not on the menu”. The moral and ethical reputations of the US and other Western powers were also tarnished by perceived claims of hypocrisy and deceit over the origins of the war in Iraq, as well as subsequent scandals about the use of torture, spying on allies and domestic surveillance. As US political scientist Alexander Cooley argued, to many in the developing world, the West appeared not only to be failing materially, but morally, putting it in “normative retreat” for the first time in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;72-choosing-state-threats&quot;&gt;7.2. Choosing state threats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, revisionist states have often turned to the use of diplomacy to assert their dominance over declining powers in changing geopolitical environments. Indeed, China has made considerable efforts to reshape existing international institutions along more palatable lines, while creating parallel multilateral structures that it dominates. However, the application of military means has also been common. Russia and China have made massive investments in their militaries in recent decades, as they have sought to create conventional and nuclear forces capable of challenging US military pre-eminence. Russia has, moreover, used its forces against non-NATO states in its near abroad too; first against Georgia in 2008, and then against Ukraine from 2014 onwards, and on a much grander scale since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, neither Russia nor China has so far sought to use its military forces in direct military confrontations with Western states. Iran and North Korea have also been circumspect about the levels of military force they have deployed, against powerful regional opponents such as Israel, as much as against Western countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons behind the decision to use state threats rather than diplomatic or military means have been subject to a growing debate in the fields of international relations and intelligence studies. Looking at the use of covert action in the context of foreign wars, political scientists Austin Carson and Keren Yarhi-Milo have suggested that one attraction of such a type of intervention is to send a “signal” of carefully calibrated commitment and engagement to both friend and foe alike. Other political scientists have taken alternative perspectives. Looking at historic cases of US regime change, Lindsey O’Rourke has suggested that the decision to use covert rather than overt means has been driven by a variety of tactical and strategic concerns, especially controlling costs and limiting consequences. Also analysing US involvement in regime change, Michael Poznansky has proposed that the choice of covert means has been guided by a desire to conform to the appearance of international law, by not overtly breaching the principle of non-intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some care is required to avoid assuming that these findings immediately explain the contemporary use of hostile state actions, however, drawing as they do on the past actions of the US rather than authoritarian states, and focusing on particular types of hostile actions, rather than hostile action as a whole. Nonetheless, they do provide useful indications as to why states choose to use hostile acts as a form of state policy, especially when it comes to demonstrating that they “remain in the game”, while seeking to minimise disruption and reputational damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this balance between feasibility and risk – doing what is materially possible within the bounds of the politically sustainable – is probably at the core of why the revisionist states are using state threats. As Venezuelan journalist Moses Naim notes, following the ideas of management scholar Ian MacMillan, state decisions about strategy and tactics are largely based on: (a) the range of tools available to the state; and (b) the scope and constraints of their given situation. In the cases of Iran and North Korea, neither can start a conflict with a regional opponent, particularly one tied to the US, and expect to win outright, or without unpleasant and possibly existential consequences. As their response to Iran’s aerial attacks on Israel in April and October 2024 indicate, the US and its allies would come to the aid of Israel in the event of a direct Iranian attack. This would also be the case if North Korea attacked South Korea, a country with which the US has a bilateral defence treaty and close military cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, even Russia or China would be taking a great risk to use its military in a direct confrontation with the US or one of its allies. Certainly, both have substantial militaries, but Russia has struggled to subdue a much smaller power in Ukraine, and China has not deployed the PLA in a major conflict since the war against Vietnam in 1979. Although there has been a shift in overall geopolitical power dynamics, therefore, the US and its allies have maintained a level of military dominance that has dissuaded others from seeking to challenge them directly, at least for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How best to express strength and hostility then, if not through military force? Kilcullen suggests that the obvious step, and the one taken by the revisionist states, is to apply “a suite of ‘offset strategies’ to sidestep … [Western] conventional power”. In other words, state threats. Firstly, these covert actions – sabotage, subversion and so on – can seem relatively cheap options in comparison to a military operation. Secondly, if they succeed, they offer the potential to create a large effect for a small investment. Thirdly, they are easier to abandon if they go wrong and deniable even if they succeed. Driven by operational realities and practicalities, Bastrup-Birk described in interview how the use of such “deniable proxy levers of influence, alongside indirect forms of warfare and power projection” could be seen as “the logic of the wise”, with the revisionist states choosing “to play to their strengths and not those of their opponents”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the aforementioned benefits are assured of course. As intelligence scholars point out, operations can metastasise out of control, have unintended consequences or cause severe reputational damage. “Plausible deniability” is, as Cormac and Aldrich argue, often an unconvincing concept in practice. Nonetheless, covert acts do at least provide the benefit of causing particular difficulties to Western states, which struggle to assess their seriousness and calibrate an effective response within a credible timescale. Like naughty children seeking to annoy a neighbour by ringing their doorbell and then running away, the revisionist states can use these methods in relative comfort, confident as they can be that they will not provoke a response ‒ or, at least, a response that is likely to bother them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;73-state-case-studies&quot;&gt;7.3. State case studies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are significant similarities in motivation across the revisionist states, there are also variations between them. While this paper cannot provide an exhaustive review of each state, it aims to provide a balanced summary of relevant issues, recognising the sensitivities involved. Some states may have unpalatable motivations and questionable world-views from a Western perspective, but that does not immediately imply they are not sincerely held. There is no reason to suppose that all states will react to a given international environment the way Western states do; as Omand has written, we need to avoid “mirror imaging” and “transferred judgement” when assessing the causes behind the behaviours of other international actors. We should not assume or presume that our potential opponents will, or should, feel and think as we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7.3.1. Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two largest revisionist states, Russia’s adversarial attitude is the most pronounced and durable. Indeed, President Putin has been making deeply critical comments about US and Western policy since his Munich Security Conference speech in February 2007 from 2022. Putin’s real intentions are a puzzle that have long absorbed Western academic and policy circles, not unlike the “Kremlinology” of the Cold War. Unsurprisingly, wide divergences of opinion remain, as described in the four “versions” of Putin below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russian nationalist or imperialist&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ While those holding this view note that Putin’s behaviour has become more hostile over time, they suggest that the changes are less dramatic than some would portray them, and that his motivations and aims have been driven by nationalism and are largely consistent. Such observers see Putin as nostalgic for the USSR and/or Russian empire, typical of the Soviet security class from which he came, and a leader who would like to revive Russian power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victim of the West&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Others see Putin starting his office on good terms with the West, only pivoting to hostility around his return to the presidency in 2012 in response to Western behaviour. The reasons given for this pivot vary. Some cite NATO’s expansion up to Russia’s borders; others, supposed covert US support for domestic protests after Putin’s re-election in March 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failed moderniser&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Another camp also sees a change in Putin’s behaviour over time, with him coming to office as an economic moderniser, then shifting back to an approach mired in corruption and authoritarianism. In this version, Putin’s increasing hostility towards the West has partly been a distraction for his own population from his own failure. As Russia analyst Lilila Shevtsova describes, hostility has been a psychological trick, offering the Russian people a reminder of “what it feels like to be a great power”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compulsive tactician&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Finally, several observers have questioned whether Putin has any guiding principles or strategic objectives. In this version, Putin is constantly calculating tactical margins, and taking action to achieve short-term gain, depending on the circumstances. This suggests that Russia’s behaviour on the international stage simply reflects Putin’s day-to-day power calculations, rather than long-term goals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing these interpretations, it is clear that a primary issue is whether Putin has core beliefs. Overall, Putin’s public statements and behaviours over the past 20 years suggest that he does, and that they sit broadly within the discernible traditions of Soviet and Russian imperial thinking, as suggested by the first school of interpretation. Putin, and the cadre of intelligence and military securocrats from which he emerged (the siloviki), share what Russia expert David Lewis has described as a common “mental map that interprets the reality … not a clearly articulated belief system, but a set of shared understandings of contested concepts among a group of political actors”. Another Russia expert, Brian Taylor, has labelled it the “Code of Putinism”, combining a shared body of “habits, emotions, and ideas” on which Russia’s behaviour is based. Within the boundaries of this code, several beliefs and policy corollaries are central:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia is a global power&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Russia is seen as a natural great power with interests across the world. In this, it is among a small group including the US and China. Smaller powers should therefore be deferential towards Russia, and peer states should pay due attention and respect to its views. Russia should thus enjoy a leading position in international institutions such as the UN.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia has natural spheres of influence&lt;/strong&gt; ‒Russia scholar Ruth Deyermond notes that Russia operates a double standard, arguing on the one hand for non-intervention in its own affairs, while on the other, positioning itself as the grand arbiter of affairs within its regional spheres of influence. For the Putin regime, Russia has unchallengeable strategic interests in the states of the former USSR, eastern and northern Europe, and even the Arctic. Of these, the former Soviet states are the most important, some parts of which – eastern Ukraine being the key example – are seen as being part of historic Russia, which should be returned to the homeland. Russia also sees its vital interests as cultural, as well as geographic, viewing itself as a guardian of Russian culture and honour across the world, giving it both the duty and the right to intervene to protect and promote the interests of Russian nationals and speakers, and to defend the honour of Russian culture and history.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russia is under threat, from within and without&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Riehle notes that the regime, so heavily staffed with siloviki, is deeply entrenched in “the chekist mindset”, which goes back to the original Soviet secret police, the Cheka. According to the chekist view, Russia’s geographic integrity and political stability are under constant threat from outside powers – especially Western democracies – and internal dissidents acting as their agents. As a result, the Russian state “is constantly looking for, and sometimes fabricating, a connection between domestic threats and foreign enemies”, to fulfil its psychological expectation of threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These beliefs did not appear suddenly in 2012; there are traces of them in Putin’s public pronouncements going back to the first two terms of his presidency. Putin saw the hand of unnamed foreign powers in terrorist atrocities such as the Beslan school siege in 2004, for example, and he was actively bemoaning the end of the USSR in 2005. His angry speech about Western international behaviour to the Munich Security Conference in 2007 has already been noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in his early years in power, Putin was more cautious about translating hostile attitudes into hostile activities. Despite his deep-seated suspicions of the US, Putin at first judged that he was more likely to meet his goals through cooperation than confrontation. Sergei Pugachev, an oligarch, explained to Belton that Putin’s apparent friendliness was pragmatic and not undertaken “out of any sense of generosity, but because Putin expected something in return”. He did not receive these rewards, however, and over time, his resentments grew as Western policies increasingly cut across Russia’s perceived interests. The geographic expansion of NATO into the post-Soviet space, and US criticism of human rights abuses in Russia not only angered Putin, but stoked his paranoia. Putin and his associates became increasingly convinced that the colour revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine and other post-Soviet republics, as well as protests in Russia in 2012 following Putin’s re-election as president, were Western interventions intended to overthrow his regime and break up Russia. A further aspect of the antagonism, moreover, was hurt pride. Western encroachment into Russia’s perceived sphere of influence was taken as a major slight by Putin, as was Russia’s diminution on the world stage. Putin was reportedly particularly riled by President Obama’s comments in December 2016, when Obama dismissed the threat from Russia, describing it as a “smaller … weaker country” about which the US had little need to be anxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin’s perceptions that Russia was being thwarted and scoffed at by the US and its allies – reasonable and rational or not – laid the ground for a policy that was increasingly hostile and more in tune with the basic presumptions of his world-view. With little to be gained from trying to negotiate with the West, the alternative was to disrupt and challenge it in the hopes of creating a strategic dividend favourable to Russian interests. Russia became better positioned to do this, moreover, as the century wore on, as the period of economic collapse at the end of the 20th century was replaced by an economic boom and burgeoning government revenues based on the massive growth in its export trade in hydrocarbons; from 1999 to 2008, Russia’s GDP grew by 94% and its GDP per capita doubled. This meant that Putin not only felt Russia had to take a stand against the West, but also that Russia had growing means to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the revisionist powers, Russia has thus been the most willing to risk direct military confrontation with the West, especially in Ukraine. Nonetheless, it has sought to skirt the edges of military conflict, most probably because it is aware, even after years of military investment, of how poorly placed it would be to fight NATO directly. As a result, it has made a virtue of necessity, opting for what Galeotti has described as a form of “guerrilla geopolitics”, where covert means are used to attack the West from the inside, exploit weaknesses, encourage divisions and force the West to fight itself, rather than Russia. In doing so, it has also drawn upon the strengths of a long Soviet and Russian covert tradition, which takes a permissive view of the acceptable boundaries of peacetime hostility, and emphasises the use of daring, improvisation and a willingness to exploit opponents’ response thresholds to make up for material weaknesses. The hyperactivity of this campaign in part also reflects a historic penchant in Russian agencies for “action for action’s sake”, along with high levels of inter-agency competition. As Riehle notes, the Russian services “have a tradition of rivalry, partially due to intentional overlaps in their missions”. This level of competition is likely to have increased with the growing number of non-state actors available to undertake hostile activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7.3.2. China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s engagement with the US and its allies was presented by the majority of China experts during the 1990s and 2000s as part of a “peaceful rise” to global power. According to this argument, China was rising in global importance through internal development and cooperation with the West, rather than conquest and confrontation. Although some Western observers of China still give credence to this narrative, an increasing number now perceive China as increasingly aggressive, and willing to challenge the US at global level. However, despite a growing consensus in this regard, there is a wide spectrum of opinion on why the change in the character of its behaviour has occurred. The three most common interpretations of this shift are outlined below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The grand plan&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Holders of this view tend to see the apparent rise in Chinese hostility towards the West as part of a long-term Chinese plan. According to these analysts, China has sought to lull the West into a false sense of security by focusing on friendly economic and political engagement, before then switching to direct confrontation once US power has been overtaken; one book along these lines has the title The Hundred Year Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The unavoidable crisis&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ In a less conspiratorial take than the “grand plan”, this interpretation tends to see China’s growing antagonism towards the West as a natural consequence of the clashes that occur between rising and declining powers, especially when they struggle to find ways to accommodate one another and have differing views of how the world should work. While accepting that China has long assumed its ascent would naturally lead to dominance, this interpretation does not necessarily cast China’s conduct in an especially nefarious light, but rather as a function of power political realities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Xi pivot&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Another group of scholars sees the critical factor in the intensification of Chinese hostility towards the outside world as a reflection of the character and views of President Xi, who became general secretary of the CCP in 2012, and president of China 2013, and subsequently one of the most powerful Chinese leaders since Mao. These scholars note that Xi has pushed China’s formerly bureaucratic authoritarianism towards a more personalised model, while taking a more repressive tone at home, and a more nationalistic and aggressive one overseas. In this, they believe, Xi is very different from his more conciliatory immediate predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all three versions, the idea of the “grand plan” is the one most open to question. The proposition that the Chinese leadership set and then followed a long-term plan over many decades, changes of leader, and throughout major historical vicissitudes such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, is hard to accept. Likewise, the idea that there is something “natural” about current levels of Chinese antagonism towards the West seems too deterministic; as China expert T.V. Paul has noted, confrontations between rising and declining powers are likely but not inevitable, and peaceful accommodations, though rare, do occur. Finally, it seems unreasonable to place all the responsibility for Chinese aggressiveness on the shoulders of Xi, especially as the regime continues to exhibit many bureaucratic aspects. China is not quite a one-man show yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these different perspectives do provide some useful insights. Chinese leaders have indeed long seen the West as a potential threat that needs to be addressed, regardless of outwardly friendly relations. Despite several decades of apparent amity after US President Richard Nixon’s opening to China in 1972, China’s political world-view has been grounded in the idea that it suffered a so-called “century of humiliation” between the 1840s and 1940s, when Western countries actively meddled in China in pursuit of their own interests. More recently, the CCP has feared the influence of the Western democratic model ‒ celebrated, for example, by the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 ‒ as a threat to its position leading Chinese society. The party has also feared Western military force, exemplified by the accidental NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, as a risk to its physical security and territorial integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, while the CCP has not necessarily had a “plan” for world domination as such, its policies have been based on the expectation that China would eventually be the preeminent global power, reflecting the natural superiority of Chinese civilisation. According to China expert Wang Gungwu, for China, countries are “all alike but equal” but at the same time, all “inferior to China”. Even Chinese leaders who are relatively well-disposed towards the West have been honest behind closed doors about the need to take a gradualist approach to China’s ascent, noting, as Deng Xiaoping said, that China must “hide its strength and bide its time”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kilcullen has noted that China did indeed take a “twin-track” approach throughout the 1990s, which emphasised the idea of the peaceful cooperation, “while simultaneously pursuing military modernisation and vigorously defending China’s national security interests and socialist ideology against Western encroachment”. As part of this first track, China stressed the role of global structures such as the UN, the importance of sovereignty and non-interference, and showed “no missionary impulse to promote authoritarianism”, according to China expert Andrew Nathan; in fact, Beijing preferred a “regime-neutral” approach that sought “good relations with whoever is in power, regardless of regime character”, as long as this was mutually beneficial. However, at the same time, China also claimed an exclusive sphere of influence among its near neighbours and demanding respect on the international stage. As China scholar Martin Jacques observed in the years before Xi’s rise, China’s foreign policy remained “tinged with the thinking of the tributary system”, pointing back to the era when China’s neighbours’ paid material tribute to its emperor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intensification of Chinese hostility towards the West has thus been likely to some degree, considering the country’s trajectory and the expectations of the CCP over the past 40 years. However, more recent influences have played their part too. Much as Russia’s hydrocarbon boom enabled the Putin regime to start to push back against the West with greater confidence, the astonishing growth in the Chinese economy in the past 30 years has undoubtedly helped China to do the same. As Jacques pointed out over a decade ago, an increasingly powerful China was unlikely to “always adjust to and adopt Western cultural norms” as a consequence. Even during the eras of Jiang and Hu, China had begun to push back against Western criticism of its human rights record. China was also beginning to take a more aggressive stance on maritime border disputes in the South China Sea, presenting the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, with a submission in May 2009 claiming “undisputable sovereignty” within what it called the Nine Dash Line. Nonetheless, despite these structural influences, it is unlikely that any other Chinese leader would have calibrated their approach as aggressively as Xi. While he cannot be held responsible for the entire pattern of Chinese behaviour, his views have almost certainly shaped and sharpened the conduct of Chinese policy over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ostensibly, much of Xi’s stated vision of a “China dream” has focused on economic growth, science and technological development. Programmes such as Made in China 2025, which focus on manufacturing growth and technological innovation, look towards what Xi has described as a “modern socialist country” by the 100-year anniversary of the Chinese Revolution in 1949. Many external policies have also appeared primarily economic and collaborative, with the country promoting the development of international trading infrastructure and financial investment through the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. As Xi told the CCP National Congress in October 2017: “The Chinese nation … has stood up, grown rich, and become strong. It will move toward center stage and make greater contributions for mankind”. Xi also told the congress that China wished to see “the construction of the common destiny of mankind”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while much of Xi’s language has sounded benevolent, the vision he presents also has hard edges. Xi has encouraged the use of both fair means and foul in China’s campaign of economic development; the country’s massive commercial espionage campaign, while predating his leadership, has grown under it. A survey of Chinese espionage cases in the US between 2000 and 2022, conducted by US think-tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, indicates a rising trend over the past two decades, but with its sharpest growth between 2015 and 2020. At the same time, while seeking Western know-how, Xi has also sought to make China a more closed society. In a paper known as “Document No. 9”, circulated in April 2013 and subsequently leaked, the CCP’s Central Committee listed “false ideological trends” coming from the West which had to be combatted, including liberal democracy, universal values, civil society and Western-style journalism. After a period of relative openness to discussion, the CCP under Xi began to close down the small avenues that were available to question the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wider world, Xi’s warm words have also largely translated into a reality that is, in the words of Tsang and Cheung, “self-centred, hierarchical, illiberal, and coercive”. The term “common destiny” has roots in the traditional Chinese idea of tianxia (meaning “all under heaven”), which places China at the centre of the international order, as benevolent guide and judge over all. Xi’s vision thus places China at the top of a global pyramid of power, within which other states will accede to China’s wishes simply because of its self-evident correctness. Because the Chinese leadership under Xi believes itself to be benevolent and wise, it has concluded that China’s interests must be the same as every other state. Thus, while a common destiny is intended to operate through the traditional UN-based system, the Chinese leadership assumes that it will operate exactly in accord with Chinese requirements. Any attempts to stand against China are thus likely to be perceived to be wrong-headed and in need of correction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Xi, China has thus taken a stronger line on dictating – and not just promoting – China’s role as an arbiter of all China-linked affairs on a global scale. Not only does Xi see China as having ultimate authority over all ethnic Chinese outside China, regardless of nationality, but also that it has the fundamental right to control how it is perceived and treated. As Allen notes, China increasingly assumes that “criticizing Chinese government behavior is always a violation of China’s sovereignty and, thus, a form of meddling in its domestic affairs”. Moreover, while the pre-Xi CCP seemed uninterested in promoting “socialism with Chinese Characteristics”, especially to established democracies, the past decade has seen a more energetic promotion of a Chinese model of governance in the developing world, based on technological surveillance and social control. Former UK diplomat and China expert Charles Parton noted in interview that China “does not aspire to be the world’s policeman. But being the world’s secret policeman … well, that is another matter”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s long-term preoccupation with making itself the world’s leading economic, political and military power, combined with its increasing paranoia about regime stability, help explain its heavy focus on commercial espionage, repression of dissent and elite malign influence operations. If Russia seems determined to create a chaotic atmosphere in which it can achieve its goals, China prefers to keep the current international system intact and inheritable, even if it foresees major renovations to its workings. For a state whose fundamental requirement is order, disruptive behaviours such as assassinations, physical sabotage and cybotage are likely to be viewed as counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This preoccupation China has with inheriting, rather than wrecking, the international system also partly explains why the Chinese leadership has so far not resorted to military means. The likely economic damage to China from an open conflict with the US and other Western states would almost certainly undermine China’s economic growth, which has been one of the fundamental priorities of the CCP for four decades. Its alternative has therefore been to develop a wide-ranging “grand strategy” that has sought to promote its agenda by a range of means ‒ including covert and clandestine methods ‒ that test their opponents, rather than challenge them in one specific domain or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This palette-based approach, in which state threats play a part, enables China to pursue its goals without putting its economic ascent at risk. Furthermore, this exploits the vulnerabilities of the many European and Asian countries that have an interest in maintaining economically beneficial relationships with Beijing, and are therefore likely to have a higher tolerance for potential Chinese aggressiveness. Much like the junior partner in a coercive domestic relationship, these China-dependent Western countries seem willing to put up with a certain amount of bad behaviour, for fear a greater loss if they fight back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s use of covert and clandestine means does not just reflect pragmatism, however; it also neatly dove-tails with much of China’s tradition of strategic thinking. Going back to Sun Tzu’s The Art of War, and echoed in Mao’s writings on guerrilla warfare, Chinese military thought stresses a cautious, incremental and roundabout approach to achieving victory in a confrontation, minimising costs, and encouraging opposing nations to undermine themselves from within – a technique known as wu wei. This indirect approach was re-stated in modern form in Liang and Xiangsui’s Unrestricted Warfare, which, while not a state-endorsed strategy, reflected the natural contours of historic Chinese strategic discourse. It also went on to shape China’s official “Three Warfares” strategy of 2003, which highlighted psychology, public opinion and legality as central battlegrounds in war. China has thus long been comfortable with using state threats as a tool of policy, both for pragmatic and cultural reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7.3.3. Iran&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Iranian regime has taken a largely confrontational position towards the West since the 1979 revolution, when the theocratic Shia movement of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew the Western-backed regime of Shah Reza Pahlavi. Although there have been some brief and shallow periods of détente – notably with the signing of a nuclear deal in 2015 – the overall tenor of the relationship has been negative. Western observers see a variety of reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran as a revolutionary power&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Among some Western analysts, Iran is still seen as a regime driven by the same religious zealotry and idealism that overthrew the shah four decades ago. Its behaviour towards the outside world is thus interpreted as a continuation of its revolutionary aims: to extend Shia influence in the Muslim world, destabilise its monarchical Sunni neighbours in the Persian Gulf, destroy Israel and eject Western powers from the region. Like Jacobin France and Soviet Russia, Iran seeks to reshape the region around it in its own image.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran as an anxious theocracy&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Other Iran watchers take a more circumspect view. While accepting the revolutionary foundations of the regime, they see contemporary Iran’s hostility towards the West as less intense or sincere than it first appears; the regime’s aggressive behaviour is carefully calibrated, and intended to demonstrate Iran’s anti-Western bone fides and regional leadership to groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, rather than to export the revolution. According to this view, modern Iran has evolved into what Parsi describes as more of “a status quo power” than a revolutionary champion, operating according to the dictates of “defensive realism” rather than ideological zealotry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran as a resister of interference&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ A further view explains Iranian behaviour as a largely natural response to outside pressure from the West, which has sought to manipulate Iranian governments throughout history. This narrative points towards the West’s decades-long support for the shah’s repressive regime; covert interventions in Iranian politics, such as the US and UK-backed overthrow of the prime minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, in 1953; and Western support for Iran’s regional enemies as powerful explanations of Iranian conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the interpretations bring some insights, but caution is required in too readily accepting Iran’s behaviour as purely defiant self-defence. It is true the West has interfered in Iran’s domestic politics in the past; just as with the siloviki in Russia, the Iranian regime genuinely sees itself as besieged by hostile outsiders they fear will encourage internal dissent. However, this is far from a complete picture. Hostile actions against Western interests began very early in the regime’s existence, as the taking of US and Canadian diplomats as hostages in 1979 indicates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regime’s expansive regional agenda is also apparent. It is difficult to frame Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s stated aim to create a “new Islamic civilization”, his call for the destruction of Israel – “a cancerous tumour” – or his support for the activities of terrorist groups and militias beyond Iranian borders purely as rejoinders to external victimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic hostility towards the West – and especially the US – thus remains a fundamental part of the Iranian regime’s world-view, as does the long-term aim to see Iranian (and Shia) power and influence increase in the region, geopolitical conditions permitting. But this ideological vision is not well-favoured by the constraints the regime faces in terms of lack of resources and a contentious regional environment. In line with those observers who see it as a troubled state, caught between vaunting rhetoric and problematic reality, Iran’s hostile activities suggest a regime that has a genuine desire to cause harm, but a pragmatic desire to avoid the consequences. Iran’s current approach is thus chiefly disruptive, and its activities are targeted more at its neighbours than at the West. “The regime knows that it needs to deliver on its rhetoric, but it also knows that there are limits,” commented Ali Ansari during interview. “Their attacks on its enemies have mostly been more performative than truly damaging as a result.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This performative character has been shaped largely by pragmatic and understandable strategic choices. Despite Iran’s large population and hydrocarbon reserves, the regime understands itself to be an economic and military minnow compared with Russia and China, a position weakened further by the impact of Western sanctions. Iran knows it is in no position to challenge the West head on, and this is what has made jang-e narm (“soft war”) or jang-e gheir-e kelasik (“non-classic war”), as described in Iranian military doctrine, so appealing. Such acts exhibit bravado at minimum cost to Iran, and in the words of Parsi, “stave off potential enemies on their home turf”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the regime’s approach is also constrained by more embarrassing internal realities too. Despite the monolithic image it seeks to present, the regime is riven by factionalism, cynicism and corruption; Ansari commented that “there are very few true believers left in the regime, and in most cases, people are looking after themselves”. The regime has, moreover, faced substantial evidence of its own unpopularity with the Iranian people in recent years. The persecution of dissidents such as Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died in police custody in September 2022 after being arrested for violating rules on wearing a headscarf, led to serious protests, magnified by economic distress, which the regime initially struggled to contain. It seems likely therefore that the leaders of the regime are aware of its fragility and the new instability that becoming embroiled in an open conflict might bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;7.3.4. North Korea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Iran, North Korea’s hostility towards the West is largely ideological, inherent and long term, and goes back to the regime’s attempt to overrun its southern neighbour in 1950, which was thwarted by the US and its allies under a UN mandate. Led by an idiosyncratic hereditary communist regime under the Kim family, Pyongyang has pursued a path it describes as juche (“self-sufficiency”), although at various times it has looked to China and the USSR (and latterly Russia) for support. What has given North Korea’s attitude towards the West a particular sharpness, though, has been its opposition to the US’s role as the ongoing protector of its neighbour, South Korea. North Korea has continued to rail against the US for interfering in the affairs of the peninsula, and has continually claimed that the US intends to overthrow the Kim regime. Whether the North Korean leadership believes this or not, it has used US involvement as the justification for pursuing, and achieving, a nuclear and ballistic missile capability, for which it has been sanctioned by the UN Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To an even greater extent than Iran, however, North Korea is relatively weak by standard measures of national power, apart from its stock of WMD and the size of its conventional armed forces, which are among the largest in the world. Its economy is a particular problem; following the loss of the USSR as an economic sponsor after the Cold War, nearly two decades of UN sanctions and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the country has a very small economy by international standards, with its nominal GDP a tiny fraction of South Korea’s. Despite tight state control and surveillance of the general population, the stability of the regime is also perennially in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, what primarily guides the regime’s present activities is its instinct for self-preservation, which explains its campaigns to generate hard currency through crime, particularly its extensive cyber exploits. As noted previously, these activities are mainly intended to generate funds to bolster the regime, rather than to attack the West per se. North Korean cyber activities have targeted many states, including those of widely differing political stances. Expediency trumps any sense of principle for the Kim regime. Nevertheless, even if North Korea’s current conduct is not primarily intended to attack the West, Pyongyang is content when its activities damage its enemies, seeing this as a positive collateral effect. Notwithstanding recent statements about abandoning reunification efforts, moreover, the regime’s rhetoric indicates an ongoing intention to disrupt its neighbour, with Kim threatening in October 2024 to destroy the South with nuclear weapons “if provoked”. Furthermore, it is probable that the regime would take a more proactively hostile stance towards the West if it felt more secure. James Byrne, a senior associate fellow at RUSI and an expert in North Korean sanctions evasion, interviewed for this project, suggested parallels with Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, where individuals only move on to higher-order goals after securing their basic needs. As Byrne reflected, “Pyongyang is at the lowest level of ‘the hierarchy of aggression’ now – it needs to worry about survival first and foremost – but if it were to become economically stronger, perhaps with Russian and Chinese support, that could easily become more aggressive still.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;74-conclusion&quot;&gt;7.4. Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section has sought to explain, hopefully with some nuance, both rising international tensions and states’ increasing resort to covert means to conduct policy. While it might be tempting to frame the current situation purely as a return to Cold War behaviours, with the authoritarian states of Russia and China attacking liberal democracies, the reality is much more complicated. Clashes of world-view, shifting economic power balances and the individual cases of the countries in question have to be taken into account. Like its atmospheric equivalent, geopolitical climate change has emerged as the result of the interactions within a complex international system, which are hard to reduce and explain with simple formulae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This febrile situation has thankfully not yet led to a major military conflict, but this is not something that can be relied on forever. The use of covert and clandestine means largely reflects states’ current cost-benefit calculations, and the ongoing disparities in power between the leading revisionist states and the US and its allies. Naturally enough, the revisionist states are fearful of the costs of any direct conflict; acting below the threshold of war remains the pragmatic choice. But this could change with revised power calculations, or if these states begin to conclude that covert means are not an effective way to attain their goals. This suggests that, as we move towards considering the future pattern of state threats, we must assess how effective they have proved so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-state-threats-effectiveness&quot;&gt;8. State threats’ effectiveness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of policy “success” is a developing field, which has sought to apply social scientific and econometric methods of evaluation to various aspects of public policy, primarily in the domestic arena. Concepts of success vary, but broadly fall into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;process success&lt;/em&gt;, which considers criteria such as the breadth of support for a policy, or its sustainability;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;programmatic success&lt;/em&gt;, which considers whether a policy has been implemented effectively and efficiently, and delivered intended outcomes; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;political success&lt;/em&gt;, which looks at whether a policy adds to the reputation and credibility of the enacting government.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to apply any of these heuristics to the messy world of state threats, especially in light of the secrecy in which they are planned and sometimes executed, will be a major challenge. Their use by authoritarian regimes, which tend not to provide extensive and auditable trails of data, adds a further layer of obfuscation. Methodologically, it is hard to see how quantitative measures might be credibly applied, and even a qualitative assessment would struggle with confounding factors; the correlation of a hostile action and a desired outcome does not necessarily mean that the former has caused the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accepting these limitations, this section takes a relatively modest and impressionistic approach, assessing available qualitative evidence against a criterion of programmatic success: to what extent do hostile actions result in desired outcomes for the perpetrating state? This focus on policy aims and intended outcomes is largely driven by the needs of a diverse audience – it is the “type” of policy success that has the widest purchase in common usage – and a preference for economy in the length of an already long paper. Its primacy does not imply that the other two categories of success are irrelevant to state threats; in fact, they are potentially important factors to consider when the question of why hostile acts might persist when programmatic success proves elusive. However, these other categories will play a secondary role here, based on a hope that future research will be able to take a more broad-based and multi-dimensional approach to evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;81-three-levels-of-programmatic-outcome&quot;&gt;8.1. Three levels of programmatic outcome&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State policies in the international arena are usually undertaken with the objective of having an impact on the target, and/or a bringing a benefit to the threat actor. As we have seen in previous sections, in the case of state threats, impacts are likely to be focused either on attempting to degrade, damage, disrupt, destroy or purloin another state’s (or state’s citizens’, residents’ and organisations’) capabilities, capacities and assets (both physical and non-physical); or on manipulating that state’s attitudes, behaviours and policies in a way that is conducive to the interests of the threat actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These impacts should theoretically be seen at different levels, from micro- to macro-level. To borrow terms from military science, these levels might be described as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ the level of an individual engagement or act.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ the level of a discrete operation or a campaign combining individual engagements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ the level of an overall goal or state policy objective.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A potential matrix for how to understand these desired impacts might be seen at the different levels is outlined in the table below, using intimidatory hostile acts such as an assassination as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lp9w9oI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 5: Potential impacts of intimidatory hostile acts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a tactical level, for example, the assassination of a critic living overseas might be intended to remove a single critical voice; at an operational level, to create a leadership vacuum among dissidents and a chilling effect on regime criticism and outside support; and at a strategic level, to strengthen the regime by removing alternative leaders, and creating an atmosphere where outside states are dissuaded or unable to challenge the threat actor’s behaviour. A similar approach could be taken to the other categories of state threat, but for the sake of brevity, and an expectation that the point of this exercise is relatively clear, a tabular explanation for each area of hostile activity is not outlined here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;82-assessing-effectiveness&quot;&gt;8.2. Assessing effectiveness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clearly a simpler task to assess the effectiveness of hostile acts at the tactical level rather than the (higher) operational or strategic levels. For example, an assassination succeeds or fails, but does it subdue dissidents or make a regime safer? This is more difficult to assess. There are no obvious metrics; even in a qualitative analysis, many variables have to be considered. It is wrong to assume, moreover, that the tactical success of an act will translate into success at the higher levels. Positive operational and strategic outcomes can happen for reasons unrelated to tactical success; indeed, there is also a long military history of positive tactical and operational outcomes not necessarily leading to strategic success: the Pyrrhic victory is an ancient concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When assessing the effectiveness of state threats, therefore, it is important to be cautious about the level of confidence we place in our judgements. At operational and strategic levels, it is probably more realistic to note the correlation between the expected likely effects of an activity and the outcomes achieved, then to consider whether and how those activities could have contributed to the outcome. It will be difficult to say with certainty that x caused y. Nonetheless, based on the evidence used for this paper, some general preliminary judgements are feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8.2.1. Overt coercion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the state threats considered, probably the least effective category at an operational or a strategic level is overt coercion. In fact, bellicose rhetoric and sabre-rattling seem more likely to damage a state’s reputation, draw attention to its other antisocial behaviours and increase international resistance to its activities. North Korea has been an exemplar of this kind of obstreperous attitude towards the outside world for decades; it has not helped it to accrue either economic benefits or international political capital, except perhaps with other revisionist states such as Russia and China. China’s wolf warrior diplomacy has also generated a negative international response; and Russian threats and open military bullying of previously neutral countries such as Finland and Sweden have almost certainly moved them closer to the West, as their recent accession to NATO suggests. Although overt threats are relatively cheap to deliver, they can often behave more like boomerangs than javelins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8.2.2. Espionage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oldest and most consistent stream of clandestine activity is espionage. Assessing its effectiveness is obviously challenging given the sensitivity around the collection, analysis and exploitation of the raw product. Intelligence histories indicate that it can take many years to make even a tentative assessment of whether a country’s collection or disruption efforts have proved fruitful; credible work on the UK’s intelligence performance in Northern Ireland during the period known as the Troubles has only appeared in recent years, for example. It is therefore hard to come to a judgement on the success of the general espionage efforts of the core revisionist states based on the current public record. Neither Iran nor North Korea have the resources to conduct significant overseas collection operations and it seems unlikely they have scored major successes. For Russia, the picture is likely to be mixed, given the volume and range of its intelligence collection activities. It has probably enjoyed tactical successes of which we are unaware, alongside more public operational embarrassments, with spy rings rolled up across North America and Europe in recent years, and hundreds of Russian intelligence officers expelled from Western countries since February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one undoubted example of success at all levels is China’s commercial, scientific and technological campaign, which has exploited the vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the Western private sector and civil society. The US IP Commission has identified China as the “world’s principal IP infringer”. As previously noted, China’s efforts are likely to have helped in its attempt to overtake the US as the world’s leading economy, although there are no reliable estimates of how much of a difference they have made. Either way, however, they have probably caused a significant drain on the US economy. According to Eftiamides, based on US intelligence estimates and other official US, EU and Canadian figures, the cost to the US of Beijing’s spying is US US$320 billion annually. In the words of General Keith Alexander, former head of US Cyber Command, China’s commercial espionage spree has probably been “the single greatest transfer of wealth in history”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8.2.3. Intimidation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intimidatory methods such as harassment and assassination also have mixed results. At a tactical level, they can remove or repress problematic individuals, but even so, they are not always successful, however “professional” the operatives might be – see the case of Sergei Skripal, for example – and they can also succeed in ways that draw negative attention to the perpetrator, as in the cases of Alexander Litvinenko and Kim Jong Nam, both of whom were killed using exotic methods that indicated the likely involvement of a state actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At an operational level, intimidatory methods can instil fear, suppress dissent and communicate a state’s intent, capability and daring, even if caught or detected. Nonetheless, these effects are often short term and can become counterproductive. Attempts to quash criticism and dissidence can have an emboldening rather than a repressive effect, as if turning up the heat under a pressure cooker; the Iranian regime found just this with the Iranian public’s angry response to the death of female protester Mahsa Amini in custody in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategically, moreover, the regular use of such techniques can become addictive and extremely damaging, as states become increasingly associated with their use. Russia’s use of assassination, for example, has certainly removed irritants to the regime, but at the cost of focusing international attention on its brutality. The deployment of intimidatory techniques on a larger scale has also generated counterproductive results for other states. For example, a leaked MOIS document in 2019 indicated that the IRGC’s support for Shia militias in Iraq had alienated the country’s Sunni communities because of the militias’ indiscriminate violence and wanton destruction of property. Intimidatory measures brought short-term security but long-term dangers for the Iranian presence in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8.2.4. Physical sabotage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with assassination, the use of kinetic attacks against physical assets can have short-term tactical benefits. However, they are unlikely to have long-term operational or strategic impacts on the targeted asset, especially in developed states that have the resilience to maintain services, and the resources and expertise to rebuild, as Poland’s efforts to maintain normal commercial activity following the Marywilska 44 shopping centre fire suggests. Where physical sabotage can have a more pernicious effect is in countries that are less capable of responding, especially if the acts of sabotage are sustained over a prolonged period and the targeted state’s resources stretched as a result. Even in more developed states, there is a risk that though difficult to assess, successive acts of sabotage might have an attritional effect on the population’s psychological resilience. How much systemic overload techniques such as state-enabled illegal migration are having is also a moot question. Certainly, any additional crime stimulated by the activity of ill-intentioned states will generate costs in terms of law enforcement, border control and social welfare rolls. However, at present there is little to indicate the material level of these efforts has moved so far above the normal baseline as to have had a critical effect on Western public sector service delivery. Thus far, such acts appear to have been irritants rather than major threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8.2.5. Cyber effects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fairness, the dangers of physical sabotage have caused Western policymakers lower levels of anxiety in recent years than those that might arise from acts of cybotage. The former US secretary of defense, Leon Panetta, is remembered for his famous warning of a “cyber Pearl Harbor”, where an unexpected cyber attack would have existentially threatening consequences for the US. But if some of the more panicked expectations about cyber effects operations have largely dissipated, evidence continues to suggest they have the potential to cause significant tactical and even operational effects. Several supporters of the efficacy of cyber attacks have pointed to the impact of the US-Israeli Stuxnet attack on Iran’s nuclear centrifuges in 2009-10, which was reported at the time to have pushed back the Iranian nuclear programme by three to five years. Others have also highlighted the Iranian Shamoon attack against the Saudi oil industry in the early 2010s, as well as a succession of Russian attacks on the Baltic states, Georgia and Ukraine in the past two decades. These attacks caused a period of initially severe disruption, with financial costs in some instances running into many millions of US dollars. North Korea’s massive cyber theft and extortion campaign has also been a great success on every level, providing the regime with much needed illicit funding to help avoid weapons procurement counter-measures and other sanctions. Indeed, estimates suggest that North Korea generates around half of its annual state income from crypto theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, some proportionality needs to temper these judgements. Even the much-vaunted Stuxnet campaign is now assessed to have had a less dramatic effect on the Iranian nuclear programme than originally surmised. Iran’s own successive actions against the Saudi oil industry also appear to have been relatively superficial in effect, failing to compromise the SCADA networks that controlled the physical systems controlling oil production. Furthermore, despite the proclaimed potential of cyber effects operations, most do not appear even to seek to have a strategic impact. In fact, data from DCID 2.0 suggest that only around 11% of cyber operations (including both espionage and effects) appear to have been aimed at degrading systems, with 28% intended to cause basic disruption. The remainder – the majority – were forms of espionage. DCID 2.0 data also show that the relative severity of cyber attacks over time did not change, with the greatest proportions in the middle range and none in the most severe range of “7-10”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other statistics show a similarly mixed picture. While the recovery time from ransomware attacks in the US seems to be rising over time (currently taking 24 days on average), other recovery times vary depending on attack type and the victim’s capabilities. According to a UK government survey carried out over 2022 and 2023, more than 80% of UK businesses and charities were able to restore operations within 24 hours after they had faced their worst attack. Other measures are more optimistic still. Economic costs of cyber attacks seem to have declined in recent years. Research by former cyber executive Tom Johansmeyer in 2024 found that around 92% of total economic losses from cyber attacks had come before 2009. These figures suggest that, as Freedman argues, cyber attacks have been “damaging more than crippling”, and “routine and ubiquitous”, rather than episodic and unexpected. Even in wartime, cyber effects operations have proved manageable. Jason Kikta noted in interview that “even 72 hours of sustained Russian cyber attacks were not enough to overcome Ukraine in February 2022”. As the recent Ukrainian experience suggests, the public and private sectors and governments are much more willing and able to soak up and handle such attacks than might have initially been expected. Like the much-feared strategic bombers of the second world war, cyber attackers are always likely to get through, but now, as then, they face resilient targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8.2.6. Weaponisation operations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weaponisation operations are, by their nature, potentially quite diverse in type, so arriving at a general assessment about their success or otherwise is impossible. They are also few in number, or at least seem so at present, so there is a limited pool of examples from which to draw, the most obvious being the weaponisation of migration. In this instance, the tactical aims of the perpetrating state appear be to create overwhelming pressure on the health and welfare systems of the targeted state, and to exacerbate its social divisions, amplified by information operations. At a strategic level, the hope appears to be to gain some political dividend from the targeted state, whether in terms of policy concessions, or from its distraction and being over-stretched. In the case of recent Russian and Belarusian efforts, Western officials believe that the increased flow of migrants across eastern European, Baltic and Scandinavian borders was intended to stir social divisions, enable radical and extreme voices on the left and right – often favourable to Russia – and thus undercut European support for Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the relative recency of these events, it is too early to come to a firm conclusion about their effects, but so far, no European health or welfare system seems to have collapsed as a result of these inflows or for other reasons. Certainly, negative material about migration has played a major role in online narratives in Europe, especially in Eastern European countries such as Poland. However, the level and character of impact this kind of material is far from clear-cut. Yes, there does appear to be a rough correlation between perceived migrant flows and rising support for anti-migrant (and pro-Russian) parties such as the Alternative für Deutschland in Germany; however, past research has suggested that rising immigrant flows do not create a general political backlash, but rather energise pre-existing anti-immigrant sentiments in limited segments of the public as the issue gains public salience. The same research also indicates that the constituency for such material is likely to be declining in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, while inflows appear to have generated harsher policy responses towards cross-border migration flows from mainstream parties, this has not necessarily been accompanied by a change in political attitudes towards Russia’s war against Ukraine. Finland’s government, for example, brought in tight new border measures in July 2024 with widespread political support, while remaining resolute in its support for NATO and Ukraine. Indeed, Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo stated that the action had only been necessary because of Russia’s weaponisation of migration, and explained that the measures were intended to send a “message” that Finland would protect its security. Although it cannot be assumed that every European country will respond in the same way as Finland, its example provides reasonable evidence to suggest that weaponisation – of migration at least – has not yet achieved its aims, and has in some ways proved counterproductive to Russia’s cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8.2.7. Subversion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A level of Western anxiety similar to that seen around weaponisation and cyber effects operations has also shaped assessments of the effectiveness of modern information operations. After the UK Brexit referendum and US presidential election in 2016, there was extensive media speculation about the size of the role that targeted information operations by external state actors had played in narrow and unexpected results. Various news outlets re-stated figures suggesting that 126 million US citizens had been exposed to Russian disinformation through Facebook, while the former US director of national intelligence, James Clapper, declared his belief that the Russian intervention had been a decisive element in the presidential campaign. The effect was also amplified by mainstream Western media, which turned the fear of Russian disinformation into a major public narrative. As Kilcullen has remarked, the GRU must have been “surprised and gratified at the extraordinary return on their modest investment” as the operation became self-sustaining with the Western media’s propensity to discuss the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, however, a more ambiguous body of evidence on the impact of information operations has emerged, suggesting less dramatic effects than were originally supposed. To take the 2016 US presidential election ‒ the cause célèbre of disinformation ‒ as an example, while the products of Russian efforts on Facebook in 2016 were seen by millions, only about 37% saw them before they cast their ballots. Moreover, as Rid notes, it was not clear to what extent the 37% had merely clicked through rather than engaged with or internalised the material, or how they reacted when they did engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information operations have also had potentially counterproductive effects too. Looking sceptically at Russia’s efforts, Galeotti has observed that “Russia may have a megaphone, but this just means that when its message is laughable or offensive it can alienate more people at once”. China has been similarly ridiculed for the low quality of its more aggressive current disinformation efforts. A recent Chinese government-backed disinformation campaign that has targeted US audiences, known as “Spamouflage”, triggered sceptical responses from Western observers. According to Jack Stubbs, an executive at social media analysis company Graphika, Spamouflage’s approach has been “like throwing spaghetti at the wall”, although as Stubbs notes, “they are throwing a lot of spaghetti”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But criticisms of “threat hype” by Rid and others does not mean that information operations are totally without effect. As Rid himself acknowledges, it is more that these effects will be less certain or dramatic than promised in government “after-action reviews and project memos”. Rid quotes Kate Starbird, an online influence researcher, who observed that “measuring the actual impact of trolling and online influence campaigns is probably impossible. But the difficulty of measuring impact doesn’t mean that there isn’t meaningful impact”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there is a prima facie case that high-volume, high-velocity information operations can help shape beliefs and patterns of behaviour. Krieg cites research showing that repeated exposure to information increases familiarity and ease of processing, regardless of the information’s veracity. Also, in a growing number of instances the weight of evidence suggests that disinformation has contributed to discernible effects ‒ both short and long term ‒ in the “real” world. Braw notes the role that social media played in triggering the storming of the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, where disinformation about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election contributed to extensive damage and loss of life. Giles has also highlighted the probable effect of Russian disinformation about Western Covid-19 vaccines on public health among Russian speakers. Latvian government data indicated in 2021 that 80% of the country’s hospitalised Covid-19 patients were Russian speakers, despite making up only 25% of the Latvian population overall. This incredible discrepancy could have many causes, but it is reasonable to suppose that Russian speakers were exposed to misleading sources of information that non-Russian speakers were not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key issue then is what factors might make information operations more or less successful. Nicholas Yap, a disinformation expert at the Atlantic Council think-tank, noted that current social scientific research suggests that disinformation has a more discernible effect when targeting marginalised social groups, although the level of that effect is far from certain, and is likely to depend on a variety of criteria such as the quality of the disinformation material used and the wider political context in which it appears. Indeed, as Yap also notes, a great deal depends on the nature of an information consumer’s pre-existing beliefs and thinking patterns; if a message chimes with a consumer’s prejudices, then it is more likely to be quickly embraced. As he observed in interview, “The vast majority of disinformation is probably consumed within a pre-existing echo chamber and reflects existing views and prejudices”. This suggests that information operations are more likely to be effective in an already divisive social environment, prodding existing wounds, rather than creating fresh damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further issue is the media environment into which disinformation narratives are introduced. Much depends on how the media and political class of the targeted society choose to handle disinformation narratives, and the fact that disinformation operations are taking place. Olga Belogolova and fellow disinformation experts have recently argued that while it is important for opinion-shapers to recognise that information operations can have an effect, there are risks of “amplifying not only the original falsehood, but also a an even more corrosive and polarizing narrative – that American politicians are remote controlled, and that US citizens don’t have agency”. Giving too much weight and power to disinformation narratives can distract politicians from tackling real issues that might underlie the disinformation story, make those behind disinformation campaigns look more powerful than they are and undermine confidence in the political system that has been targeted. In short, if the opinion-shapers of Western societies hype and mishandle disinformation, they will help do the perpetrators’ work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8.2.8. Malign influence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of influence operations is also unclear. On one hand, researchers have noted the persistent efforts by Russia and China to penetrate the political and business elites of European and anglophone countries, with some apparent success. Hamilton and Ohlberg have stated that in the UK, Chinese “influence networks … [have] passed the point of no return” and that efforts by the UK “to extricate itself from Beijing’s orbit … [will] probably fail”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, while influence operations have undoubtedly had some political effect in blunting Western responses to hostile acts, it is not clear they have achieved their aims decisively. Russian efforts to secure German compliance with its wishes, through both overt means and malign influence, alleviated Germany’s concern about Russian conduct in the 2010s. Nonetheless, following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, German attitudes began to change. This shift was given further impetus by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, leading Chancellor Olaf Scholz to suggest that the country’s foreign policy was undergoing a Zeitenwende (“historic turning point”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, developments in Western relationships with China appear to be less clear-cut. Many Western countries, especially those in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are caught between a desire to support Taiwan, human rights and democracy, and a wish to retain valuable Chinese economic ties. But even so, Western governments have shown growing concern about Chinese state-linked covert activities – especially cyber espionage ‒ leading to a general cooling of relations, if not the kind of breach that has occurred with Russia. In addition, many Western countries have begun to take action to improve their economic security, especially in relation to technologies such as advanced microchips and communications infrastructure such as 5G. While no Western country seems keen to disengage completely from a relationship with China, a process of strategic “de-risking” is under way across many Western countries, which is at variance with the intended aims of Chinese influence campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;8.2.9. Sponsoring internal conflicts and regime change&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are relatively few contemporary cases of states fostering internal opposition against opponents – and likewise of attempts to encourage, enable or enact covert regime change ‒ on which to base a credible judgement about the effectiveness of such actions. However, two sets of broad observations emerge from the material available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, developing countries seem to be the most attractive and conducive environment for direct covert political interference. The revisionist powers that have supported violent opposition groups, in particular Iran and Russia, have largely done so in unstable areas such as the Sahel, the Middle East and South Asia. Here, they have had some success in creating instability and promoting their interests. In the case of Russia’s support for the Taliban, the Russians even provided aid to an internal group that achieved power, although scholars do not identify that aid as being one of the enabling factors that led to the Taliban’s success in 2021. However, while meddling in less settled regions might be easier than in more stable areas, it does not bring guaranteed benefits. As Iran’s support for Hamas and Hezbollah has shown, being closely linked to terrorists, insurgents and militias can be detrimental to a state’s reputation when those groups are shown to be weaker than they might have first appeared. Iran’s support did little to prevent either group from being militarily humbled by Israel in 2023 and 2024, and Iran’s reputation as a regional force to be reckoned with has undoubtedly suffered as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, in relation to developed countries, revisionist states appear much less likely to become closely linked to violent opposition groups, and to the extent that they do, their associations seem more focused on generating public protests than fomenting major civil disturbances. The internal instability caused by these efforts seems marginal at best, and the value they bring seems primarily to be in feeding subversive narratives. Russia, of course, also appears to have attempted to topple a government and fix elections in the Balkan states of Montenegro in 2016 and Moldova in 2024. However, neither of these attempts succeeded; on the contrary, both seem to have been counterproductive, with Montenegro joining NATO in June 2017, and the Moldovan leadership reaffirming ties with the alliance after Russian interference in the country’s elections in October and November 2024. Despite the relative susceptibility of both countries to direct Russian interference, neither succumbed, raising doubts about how useful direct covert involvement in the politics of settled Western liberal democracies can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;83-cumulative-effectiveness&quot;&gt;8.3. Cumulative effectiveness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brief review suggests that individual state threats have uncertain and at best mixed effects. However, this still leaves open the possibility of combined measures having a cumulative impact over time. We might therefore firstly ask if the hostile activities of revisionist states have made Western countries weaker. Certainly, the West is going through a challenging period both politically and economically. Many Western commentators, as well as Western public opinion, see a crisis of confidence in democracy and the free market economy. Nonetheless, even if this is an accurate description of the current situation – and some would see it as an overstatement – the causes of the West’s current problems are likely to be complex. It is possible that state threats campaigns have contributed to them, but it seems unlikely they are the sole, or even primary cause; in fact, the contemporary debate on supposed Western decline tends to look closer to home for the culprits, such as political and cultural polarisation, democratic inertia and lack of economic dynamism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we should also ask whether revisionist states’ attempts to re-orient the intentions of their targets have had a discernible effect. Some might suggest that Russian interference in US politics has had some success in creating political chaos, but this is debatable. The US has faced significant and widening political divisions for several decades. These divisions were not created by Russia, even if the Putin regime has sought to take advantage of them. Beyond the US, moreover, attempts to weaken Western resistance seem either not to have worked or to have had the opposite effect. Looking at Russia, that most prolific user of state threats, Cormac observes that for all its noise and activity, Russia has “seemingly failed to induce meaningful policy change” in the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;84-explaining-ineffectiveness&quot;&gt;8.4. Explaining ineffectiveness&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accepting the possibility that the effects of state threats might not yet have emerged, it appears that they have had a relatively limited impact on their targets at the strategic level, at least so far. China’s commercial espionage campaign and North Korea’s cybercrime spree appear to be the only clear successes, with most other hostile activities having limited, partial or short-term effects and plenty of unwanted consequences. They are largely policy failures by rational standards. Why, then, are they generating such poor results? As with most policy failures, from the mundane to the exotic, there are likely to be several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncertain logic behind operations&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ For most state threats activity, there is limited theory or evidence to demonstrate conclusively that they will or should have the expected effect. Some types of acts do sometimes roughly correlate with desired effects – disinformation, for example ‒ but the evidence is never clear-cut. As Freedman notes about coercive activities in general, they rely on a model of human psychology and response that has yet to be consistently validated. People can be cowed by coercion, but then in other circumstances, can be motivated and energised to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical difficulties in mounting operations&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Covert activities might be relatively low cost and less involved than military operations, but they are not necessarily easy to do well. Many covert and clandestine operations involve complex tasks in contested and dangerous environments, and bring considerable risks to human and technical assets. Extensive planning and preparation are necessary to achieve even the most basic operational elements, problems which quickly become amplified in combined or ongoing campaigns. And even an impressive plan can be derailed by unforeseen events and unknowns. As former CIA analyst Mark Lowenthal has remarked, “if overt means of producing a similar outcome are available, they are almost certainly preferable” to the covert option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trade-offs inherent in secret activity.&lt;/strong&gt; As noted previously, Maschmeyer has highlighted how intractable the challenges of secret action can be, arguing that a “subversive trilemma” obtains that leads to trade-offs between operational speed (conceived of as the time required to go from the start of an operation to an effect); the intensity of desire effects, in terms of scope and scale; and the level of control over the effects generated. According to Maschmeyer’s analysis, actors operating under secrecy cannot achieve speed, intensity and control all at once, with any gain in one area leading naturally to a decline in performance in the other two. For example, an operation which prioritises speed will enjoy limited preparation, and is thus likely to have a less powerful effect and be less well managed. As a result, the outcomes generated will probably be short of expectations, and limit the operations “strategic value in practice”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited quantity and quality of tools, skills and resources&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ However coherent a plan, it can easily go awry for want of sufficient resources and capable operatives. Resources vary across the revisionist states; the Russian and Chinese agencies should in theory be well resourced due to the size of their economies, North Korea and Iran relatively less so. But as North Korea’s RGB is the generator of the state’s cyber funding, it seems likely to be generously resourced and potentially self-funding. Moreover, the IRGC has prospered through deep engagement in the Iranian economy and the sale of hydrocarbons. Competency is another matter and Russia, in particular, has faced multiple failures. Riehle observes that Russian operations:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;have been revealed publicly time after time since 2010, including foreign arrests of illegals, Russian arrests of officers for fraud and robbery, the attribution of dozens of Russian computer-based operations, the exposure of an unmistakably Russian hand behind assassinations and government manipulation, the arrests and expulsions of large numbers of officers under diplomatic cover, and continuing defections from the ranks of Russian services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese agencies have seemed to be less accident prone, excelling in some areas ‒ cyber espionage, for example ‒ and have generally improved their tradecraft over time; yet, they have continued to struggle with long-term or complex operations, and more aggressive disinformation campaigns. Iran’s operatives have also been variable performers. Cormac notes that their social media disinformation campaigns have been “rudimentary and somewhat sloppy in their tradecraft”, if also “loud, provocative and divisive”. Among the undeniably “world-class” state operatives are the cyber teams behind North Korea’s criminal campaigns, who demonstrate remarkable sophistication and growing expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High resilience of targets&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ During the STT workshops in 2023, the consensus among participants was that that the UK and partners enjoyed a relatively high level of resilience to state threats, arising from relative wealth, a history of social stability and cohesion, and the benefits brought by pre-existing measures to tackle challenges such as terrorism, general cyber threats and serious organised crime. As grey-zone-aggression expert Elizabeth Braw has explored, resilience has been nurtured in recent years, as many Western countries have taken additional measures to strengthen their position by restricting foreign investments where there are national security risks, reviewing and stress testing electoral systems, and improving online literacy and hygiene skills. Braw has also noted that several states, such as the US, the UK and Australia, have also used punitive tools to deter, catch and punish state-backed hostile actors by, for example, tightening criminal law on espionage and foreign interference, using financial sanctions, indictments and prosecutions, and what she describes as the “naming and shaming” of states, leaders and operatives believed to be behind hostile activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, therefore, states face major challenges in executing hostile activities in a way that offers the genuine promise of having a valuable impact. These factors affect all areas of state threats activity to varying degrees, but a case study that shows all these problems in stark relief is in cyber effects operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;85-cyber-effects&quot;&gt;8.5. Cyber effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber security experts continue to debate what value cyber effects operations generate. Many doubt their coercive capacity, given their covert nature ‒ how can one be coerced by someone who is difficult to identify? – or their capacity to inflict significant damage in one blow. Separately, others have now focused on how intrinsically difficult cyber effects operations are to execute, rather than their potentially devastating effects. Maschmeyer has applied his “subversive trilemma” to cyber, and found that the same operational trade-offs and tensions emerge in the field as they do in other areas of secret activity: “consequently, in most circumstances, cyber operations fall short of their strategic promise and provide, at best, limited strategic utility”, he states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, Smeets has analysed the wide number of variables offensive cyber needs to get right, from having access to the human expertise, system vulnerabilities and appropriate cyber weapons, to having the necessary technical and institutional infrastructures in place, which only the largest or most developed of countries will have. As he further notes, cyber talent is limited, cyber vulnerabilities are hard to find, and the most readily available cyber techniques, such as DDOS attacks, are fairly low impact. The most impressive cyber operations require a combination of rare ingredients not easily available to most states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China are relatively well positioned in having access to the raw essentials needed for cyber espionage and effects operations, enjoying relatively educated populations and significant financial resources by sheer dint of economic size. Iran and North Korea, by contrast, have many of the right people and knowledge, but more limited resources, although it seems clear that North Korea at least has prioritised investment in cyber. Resource issues aside, all the revisionist states – even the two most powerful – have also faced problems in execution, some of which have been self-inflicted. Russian agencies, for example, combine both expertise and resources with a capacity for duplication of effort and in-fighting. It appears that both the GRU and FSB ran parallel and uncoordinated hacks of the DNC in 2016, “apparently unaware of each other’s operations”, according to Riehle. “The cyber teams of the KGB successor agencies operate within siloed institutions that are well-known for their infighting. The GRU, who are known for their high risk tolerance, can also be poor at operational security”, O’Neill noted in interview. The Chinese agencies have been a little less hapless in this regard, and Western cyber experts have discerned an improvement in their performance over the past decade. Their teams have “become more sophisticated and flexible”, and “more adept at living off the land” within targeted systems, according to cyber expert Jamie Collier, interviewed for this project. Nonetheless, as Collier also noted, Chinese hackers are far from perfect, and continue to make sloppy mistakes during their intrusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further problems are added by the tendency of several of these states – Russia and Iran, in particular – to outsource cyber activities. Quite apart from generating obvious anxieties around control, operational security and competence, relationships with non-state partners in the cyber realm have also had some unfortunate unintended consequences, as the case of Dmitry Dokuchayev (section 5.2.2) indicates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their relative lack of legal and ethical checks and balances in comparison to Western states, moreover, the revisionists have also faced a number of other potential constraints. The most potent is the risk of escalation that cyber effects operations bring. In the words of Arquilla, using the most powerful tools in peacetime risks turning “a profitable cool war hot”. Then there are unintended consequences; initiating an attack could cause collateral damage to untargeted states or even the attacker themselves. Finally, there is the possibility of losing strategic advantage; to deploy a sophisticated weapon in peacetime risks revealing the capability to others who might then copy or develop a defence for it, or highlight a previously unknown vulnerability in a targeted system, prompting remedial action to improve resilience. An impressive cyber weapon is thus, as Arquilla states, “a wasting asset”: if it is not used it is pointless, and if it is, it soon becomes obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revisionists also face a relatively hard target in Western countries. Major targets are likely to be much better defended and protected than low-value alternatives; and, in general, rising cyber awareness in the West has led to a slow rise in overall levels of cyber security, making sophisticated hacking gradually harder to achieve. Buchanan argues that the US has a significant “home-field advantage” because of the core role of its private enterprises in providing “the modern digital ecosystem”. Gavin Wilde, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, noted in interview that James Clapper had been right when he had declared the US to be “the biggest kid on the cyber block”. Other Western states are less powerful, he suggested, but even though “the UK and France are smaller, they still have advanced cyber security capabilities which are going to give any attacker pause”. The West is thus not without its defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;86-understanding-persistence&quot;&gt;8.6. Understanding persistence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the challenges of execution and the patchiness of the results achieved, it seems puzzling that states continue to use hostile actions as a tool of policy: what is the point if they continue to have a negligible strategic effect? Assuming there are programmatic aims behind state threat-type actions, it might be that those perpetrating them only have tactical or short-term goals in the first place. They might be intended to create what Kilcullen has called “a temporary window of opportunity”, in which they can carve out small gains or distract attention from other actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If states are seeking strategic gains, they might also be willing to wait for them. One might call this the “compound interest” approach to hostile action, where time and multiple small investments have a long-term cumulative effect. As Rid notes when discussing the thinking behind Russian active measures, their aim is to work “slowly, subtly, like ice melting”. Similar thinking guides the proponents of cyber persistence theory, including Fischerkeller and Harknett, who see individual covert acts in cyberspace less as one-off faits accomplis, but as multiple actions in a broader campaign that will bring “cumulative gains to serve desired strategic effects … over time and space”. From this point of view, Buchanan notes, the cyber attacker is “like a boxer who wins on points rather than with a knockout blow”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further possibility might be that perpetrator states are applying a gambler’s mentality, seeing hostile actions as bets that might one day pay off with a big win. Discussing Russian cyber activities in interview, Gavin Wilde commented that while Russia recognises that much of what it does is “a crap shoot”, it continues because it wants to “keep its hand in the game”. As the Provisional IRA stated after its unsuccessful attempt to kill the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher in Brighton in 1986, they only had to be lucky once, whereas she had to be lucky every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite previously concluding that state threats have not had much impact so far, therefore, we need to entertain the possibility that, as Chinese Communist leader Zhou Enlai reportedly said ‒ probably apocryphally ‒ when asked about the effects of the French Revolution, “it is too soon to tell”. It is possible that revisionist states hope that the long-term cumulative effect of state threats will be more powerful than they have been until now. Constant attrition can potentially exhaust a defender’s will to resist over time. Indeed, research on complex adaptive systems indicates that the path towards dramatic change can be slow and gradual, then brief and dramatic. One of the most persistent anxieties several experts interviewed for this project voiced was that, over time, subversive activities would gradually undermine liberal democratic societies’ self-belief and trust in governments to deliver public goods. While the existential decline of a Western polity encouraged by outside forces seems highly unlikely, the possibility of some unforeseen negative outcome cannot be excluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;87-other-measures-of-success&quot;&gt;8.7. Other measures of “success”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of section 8, other measures of success apart from the programmatic ones used within the field of policy evaluation were noted. The concept of process success, which is informed by a liberal democratic desire to ensure a policy is well made and enjoys appropriate political support, is not a measure that dovetails neatly with the reality of state threats when executed by authoritarian regimes. However, it is possible that a sustained pattern of hostile activities against external opponents might help integrate and satisfy the coalitions of groups, constituencies and actors upon which the regime depends, especially if parts of that coalition are actively involved in the development and execution of hostile actions, and benefit from them. Although this remains a speculative hypothesis, it is possible that the heavy engagement of non-state actors in state threats activity not only reflects operational needs and realities, but also an attempt to tie those actors more closely to the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more credible assessment criterion for state threats than process success is political success, which is focused on what effect a policy has on the reputation of governments and leaders. Within a domestic context, and especially where regimes are dependent on nationalistic or aggressive constituencies for support, overt and lightly covert activities against opponents might help generate popularity and plaudits for a regime. It can also send a useful “signal” to those constituencies who wish to see aggressive actions against opponent states that would be dangerous to satisfy if more conventional, military measures were taken. Indeed, the concept of “signalling” also has potential explanatory value at international level too. The work of Carson and Yarhi-Milo on the utility of covert military action as a form of communication by states, their opponents and allies has already been mentioned (section 7.2). It could be argued, using their framework, that hostile actions achieve political success because they send messages of resolve and commitment, strengthening a government’s international reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as other scholars have pointed out, the evidence that governments are actually using covert actions to send signals is limited and therefore it seems somewhat presumptive to treat signalling as a potential measure of success. A more powerful criticism still is that covert signalling is hardly a reliable form of communication. Carson and Yarhi-Milo themselves admit that covert military actions do not always send the right message; rather than making the government behind them look strong, they can make them look weak instead. They highlight several contexts in which this might occur, including when a government looks “unconstrained” from the outside. An apparently strong government, or one seeking to promote an image of strength, but which is only willing to use covert measures to signal resolve, might generate cognitive dissonance among its target audiences, leading those audiences to conclude that the government “talks big and acts small”. It is possible, for example, that Iran’s relatively feeble responses to Israel’s military actions in 2024 have had just this effect both on the Israeli government and Iran’s erstwhile allies in the Axis of Resistance, leaving Tehran with the unhappy dilemma of whether to escalate boldly or step back from confrontation. If covert action is indeed intended to send messages of robustness and commitment, it is a risky way of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;88-negative-motivations&quot;&gt;8.8. Negative motivations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also need to entertain the possibility that among the reasons some states keep using state threats is not that they lead to any form of “success” as understood from a Western perspective, but to meet some other motivation or need. Discussing Russia, Giles has argued that while “it’s often tempting to call Russian actions irrational”, it is probable that “Russia is operating to entirely different rules and priorities than Western liberal democracies”. One possible negative aim is to create enough friction to prevent one’s opponent from following their own preferred policy. Moore notes of offensive cyber operations, for instance, that they can be seen less as an “independent means of securing battlefield goals” than as an “offset capability”, which prevents an opponent from achieving “their own goals”. In other words, they are simply “spoilers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other motives could be even less rational. States might see hostile acts as a way to gain attention and importance; Giles judges this to be an important Russian motive, noting how “entering discussions” with the US about alleged misdemeanours is exactly what Russia wants. “If Moscow cannot achieve recognition as a first-rank partner,” he remarks, “the next best option appears to be recognition as a first-rank enemy”. A further possibility is the desire, not unlike medieval or early modern states and their leaders, to generate a negative reputation that sends the impression of being a dangerous state that is not to be trifled with. As Riehle noted of the Russian intelligence services during interview, this is probably one reason why they do not seem to care about getting caught: “they enjoy the reputational effects of being seen as reckless and dangerous”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, states can often feel an urge to “do something” in circumstances where other actions are either impractical or dangerous; the UK formed the Special Operations Executive in 1940 to conduct small-scale covert attacks on mainland Europe, partly out of a lack of other immediate military options after the fall of France. In some cases, as Magda Long noted in interview, the ongoing use of hostile acts can become institutionalised, especially where a state has a long history of covert activity and a structure to support it: “the mindsets and structures that motivate and enable covert activity are deeply embedded in states like Russia and Iran”, she noted. Moreover, the more these states carry out such activities, the more they are likely to feel the need to keep doing so. In a separate interview, Rory Cormac, professor of international relations at the University of Nottingham, commented that Russian electoral interference would probably keep recurring for similar reasons: “They have been doing this for such a long time that it’s become almost normalised. You can well imagine the logic ‒ ‘If the West thinks we’re coming, they might misread our resolve or intentions if we don’t show up’”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;89-a-paradoxical-challenge&quot;&gt;8.9. A paradoxical challenge&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current situation surrounding state threats is thus in many ways paradoxical. On one hand, the volume, range and pace of hostile activity appear to be growing rapidly; on the other, the actual damage done seems relatively limited, so far at least. If governments are to develop appropriate policy responses, therefore, they need to take a clear-eyed view of both the absolute and the relative dangers state threats pose. In issues of national security, there is always a risk of either greatly over- or under-estimating the nature of threats, based on over-generalisations from historical examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the absolute danger that state threats pose, there are good grounds for not overreacting. Western governments should avoid seeing the revisionist states as “ten feet tall and bullet proof”, as Riehle warns Westerners are often prone to do with regards to Russian intelligence. Russia, the most aggressive state, has many economic and social problems, and is mired in a difficult conventional war in Ukraine, a conflict that has probably put pressure on the intelligence resources needed for Russia’s wider campaign of covert acts. Iran and North Korea, despite their regional aspirations, are economically poor; while dangerous to those they live closest to, they currently appear to lack great operational reach. China, while the most populous and wealthy of the four, is by far the most cautious and circumspect, and the least eager to gain a negative reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, governments need to take a measured approach to the effects of state threats. The scale of material and psychological damage acts of physical sabotage, cybotage or various forms of subversion have on Western states seems relatively limited in comparison to the sometimes lurid and apocalyptic visions doomsayers paint. So far, the centre has held, and – overall – Western societies have proved resilient. Much like the legendary response of London during the Blitz, it seems that modern democracies have been able to “take it”. Governments thus need to maintain perspective about the threat generated by state actors vis-à-vis non-actors. Certainly, state actors and their partners are likely to be more dangerous than criminals or terrorist groups, due to their scale and the resources available to them. However, here too the level of lethal threat seems more theoretical than actual. Although the current wave of Russian hostile acts across Europe has generated disruption and physical damage, it has not yet posed the same threat to life as, say, an IS-instigated attack on a major pop concert. Certain constraints and limitations seem to remain in place for state actors that do not necessarily obtain for non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments also need to consider the scale of the threat non-state actors pose in acting on behalf of states, in comparison to the threat they generate in their own self-interest and on their own behalf. Some OCGs and cyber-criminals work for governments some of the time, but most do not. The Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)’s dataset on assassinations from 2019 to 2020 indicates that only 5% of cases were clearly linked to a state actor. And with regard to disinformation, Nicholas Yap also commented that most was likely to come from commercial actors who were seeking to “create noise and attract attention, rather than shape the political landscape. Not everything is a Russian bot”. In some instances, the most dangerous activity might not even come from criminals, or humans, at all; in an infamous presentation in 2017, titled “The Squirrels are Winning”, US cyber security researcher Cris Thomas provided evidence to suggest that squirrels were much more dangerous to the integrity of the US power grid than hackers had so far proved to be, whether non-state or state backed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this call for perspective should not lead state threats to be discounted or treated as a joke. The scale of the current problem might be greater than conceived due to the many unknowns around the covert world. Cyber experts note that the challenge of attributing cyber attacks to particular actors is more of a delicate art than a robust science; one interviewee, who worked at a senior level in commercial cyber security, reflected it was possible that a higher proportion of hostile cyber activities involved sophisticated state actors than was currently assumed: “They have the resources and expertise to develop ways to hide their hands”. This could also be the case with other types of state threat. For example, although the GI-TOC database on assassinations shows only a small proportion of cases involving state actors, in 63% of cases the perpetrator and their objective were unknown, leaving open the possibility of greater state involvement than had been currently identified. Separately, in the field of political finance, Magnus Öhman, a senior political finance adviser at the International Foundation for Electoral Systems, commented in interview that it was “very difficult” to assess the amount or provenance of foreign money shaping political environments, because “funds can be legitimately funnelled through various intermediate steps to a domestic donor before the final payment is made”. The complexity and fluidity of the financial system provides a level of opacity quite as helpful as any more intentional attempts at camouflage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, moreover, much we do not know about the effects of state threats. As has been highlighted already, they might have the potential to have unforeseen corrosive effects on polities, economies and societies over time. There is also a chance – remote though it might seem – that a hostile action or campaign might somehow “get lucky”, bringing about an unexpected fait accompli due to a rare alignment of favourable circumstances. Few US intelligence analysts considered it possible that a terrorist group such as Al-Qaeda would have been able to mount attacks successfully within the US on the scale achieved in September 2001. In addition, it is feasible that operations that have had a limited impact up to now might provide the foundation for ones with greater impact in a different context. As Kikta noted in interview, current espionage operations, or preparations for sabotage, cybotage or subversion, could become an “enabler of offensive action in the early stages of a future conflict”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;810-conclusion&quot;&gt;8.10. Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the close of the section, therefore, we are in an ambiguous situation. Western governments face a problem in state threats that is real and growing, but not necessarily existential. At the same time, it is a problem about which much is unknown; some of its effects might be invisible at present, or will not be obvious until a later date. There are thus some loose parallels with the early debate about the effects of climate change, or the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, where imponderables and lack of data left considerable room for uncertainty about how bad the problems were. Considering that this ambiguity prompted many governments to take a precautionary approach in both cases, such a response might also be equally appropriate in how governments handle state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all the more justified because of the potential for state threats to become more severe over time. Of the revisionist states and their associates, the most powerful – China – is currently the least active. Even in the cases of Russia, Iran and North Korea, certain constraints on action appear to be in place. If these states’ patterns of behaviour were to change, however, or revisionist associates and middle powers began copying these behaviours more widely, the scale of the problem state threats posed would increase. Other developments too, such as expanding technological capabilities, could create opportunities for more dangerous and potentially deniable activity. These possibilities indicate the need to look finally towards the underlying influences that will shape the future landscape of state threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-state-threat-futures&quot;&gt;9. State threat futures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence analysts commonly see predictive analysis as a treacherous activity. If essential to their work, it is the one area they are likely to make the most noticeable mistakes, being either too cautious in order to avoid ridicule, or too foolhardy in order to grab readers’ attention. This section does not seek to make many hard predictions, therefore, but rather to look at general trends in the medium term and sketch out some possible scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering its relatively modest ambition, moreover, the section takes a thematic approach to the question of state threats’ evolution, using as a framework for analysis the three components intelligence professionals typically view as the core elements of threat assessment: intent, capability and opportunity. Based on current trends in these three components, it seems likely that the environment for Western countries will at best stay the same, but more likely worsen. Those states currently using state threats against Western countries show little sign of a change of intent; in the cases of China and Russia, their capabilities remain formidable. One area for optimism is Western countries efforts to reduce their vulnerabilities to state threats, but even so, Western governments will still need to build defences urgently since the storm has the potential to grow quickly. More problematic, moreover, will be the growing use of state threats by middle powers, against their regional rivals and beyond. Not only would this probably presage an increasingly fractious international arena, but a more dangerous one too, especially for those many developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to outside interference and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;91-intent&quot;&gt;9.1. Intent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic clash of world-views between the revisionist and Western states that is shaping the current crisis seems unlikely to change soon. As successive summits between Presidents Xi and Putin have indicated since 2022, the leaders see the balance of economic, political and military force vis-à-vis the US and its allies moving in their favour. Neither Russia nor China shows any sign of standing back from its revisionist stance and diplomatic relations remain warm. In response, Western states have continued to support the idea of a rules-based international order, showing limited willingness to make major concessions to revisionist demands. The one partial exception to this was during the first Trump presidency, from 2017 to 2021, but President Trump’s rhetoric did not lead to material or permanent changes in the position of the US as the leader of the Western world. Whether this could change during the second Trump presidency is difficult to know; Trump is an unpredictable figure, but his track record has suggested a gap between the extremity of some of his threats and the reality of what he does. Overall, the fundamental standoff looks likely to persist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9.1.1. Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tensions will most obviously continue with Russia. Few Russia experts see Russian hostility towards Western countries changing while Putin remains in power. Catherine Belton, the author of Putin’s People, commented in interview that “the war in Ukraine has really allowed the Putin regime to be fully itself. Now, it can make its revisionist agenda unambiguous and clear-cut. There is no need to hide it any more”. As Russian journalist Andrei Kolesnikov has also remarked of Putin, “maybe he was always brutal, but now he has decided to be brutal freely, openly and without restrictions”. In the pithy words of Keir Giles during interview, “the brakes are now off”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brakes are also likely to remain off even under any likely successor, moreover. Putin’s geopolitical world-view, which sees Russia in an existential battle with the West, is deeply entrenched and widely shared among the Russian political elite. The elite appears willing to pay a high price for this view, moreover, including the loss of coveted commercial interests in the West, even if that forces Russia into greater dependency on an increasingly powerful China, as both Belton and Giles noted in separate interviews. However, as Belton added, the elites hope that “the ultimate weakening of the West caused by Russian disruption will allow [them] to win back their positions of commercial strength in the future”. Even among Putin’s critics, his nationalist world-view resonates, if not his methods; Ukrainians had mixed views of Putin critic Alexei Navalny before his death in early 2024, noting his past comments about the importance of Crimea to Russia, and the historic closeness of Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic, structural and psychological factors are also likely to keep Russia on its present course. The Putin regime has now crawled so far out on the branch that it will be difficult for it to crawl back without loss of face, and serious economic and social consequences. The Russian economy is increasingly designed for war, and directed towards trade and cooperation with non-Western states. Russian society has developed what Kolesnikov has described as a psychology of “mass mobilisation” and a “sense of permanent war”. Much as during the Cold War, the Russian public even before 2022 had been encouraged to see any privation as the result of nefarious Western actions, supported by traitors at home. Fears for the survival of “Fortress Russia” have thus driven an acceptance, expectation and even appetite for greater repression at home, and more aggressive behaviour abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also continues to see Western actions and responses through a dark lens. When Russia takes an aggressive action (which it describes to itself as defensive), the West will criticise or respond to that action. Moscow then sees this as an additional affront and a justification for further hostile activity. The confrontation thus becomes a self-perpetuating spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Western attempts to break the spiral with some concessions – which have been described over the past two decades as “resets” – fail, because of Russia’s instinct to keep taking advantage of its interlocutors. Russia expert James Sherr has joked that “if you finally conclude a written agreement with them to stop parking their car on your lawn, don’t be surprised if they park their truck there instead”. Short of a revolution that results in a definitively post-Putinist regime, or a complete collapse of Western resolve, it is therefore difficult to see how the current high levels of hostility dissipate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Russia observers and Western policymakers are now more worried, in fact, that this hostility will escalate further into a direct military conflict with NATO. Whether war occurs or not, however, it seems likely that Russia will maintain and probably increase the tempo of its hostile activities against the US and Europe, especially those focused on undermining Western support for Ukraine and targeting dissidence and dissent. Russia sees little downside from active measures. As Wilde commented in interview, “If you have the resources to do something that might help your cause, and no one is really trying to stop you, why would you do otherwise?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Russia still wishes to avoid a military confrontation with the West, and even if it does not, hostile acts thus remain an attractive option. The question is the extent to which Russia will now increase the intensity of its hostile actions and repertoire of techniques. So far, the indications are concerning; Russia is becoming more willing to use kinetic action against physical targets, and to use cyber effects to generate disruption of European CNI. Thomas Haldenwang of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), stated in May 2024 that his agency assessed “the risk of state-controlled acts of sabotage to be significantly increased”, with “a high potential for damage”. While some constraints on directly targeting European civilians probably remain, Russia is increasingly taking action that might cause significant damage and wider loss of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9.1.2. China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Xi, China sees the tide of history moving in its direction, which Xi elliptically describes as “great changes unseen in a century”. From his and the CCP’s perspective, this invariably means, over time, Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan, revised boundaries in the South and East China Seas, regional hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and acceptance of China’s global pre-eminence. Although Tsang and Cheung reflect that China has no interest in being a “global policeman”, it does have an interest in the rest of the world complying with its views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China expects this to happen naturally due to its rise and the US’s relative decline. Xi has told Putin that “time and momentum are on our side”. However, China’s behaviour up to now indicates that that it is also willing to give history a helping hand occasionally. China’s problem is that the US and its allies do not necessarily see matters in the same way, and are unlikely to gently concede to Beijing’s economic hegemony or welcome its ongoing support for Russia. Frictions seem inevitable, the only question being how intense they will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much depends on Xi. If he were to leave power, there could be some room for a softening of the Chinese position. But the underlying geopolitical dynamics of the world, combined with China’s rising expectations, suggest that the same structural factors enabling the current levels of tension would remain. In addition, any likely successor to Xi will come from the ranks of a CCP that Xi has actively shaped in his own image. Allegiance to “Xi thought” has become a guiding influence in the regime, growing in importance alongside the largely consensus-based bureaucratic approach that operated in the 1990s and 2000s. If and when Xi were to depart, leadership elements that want a less assertive international posture might emerge, but they are unlikely to be in a strong position in any battle for succession in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Xi, or a Xi-like successor in position, the overall pattern of tensions with the West thus seems likely to remain broadly the same. Despite the running sore of Taiwanese self-government and the increasing heat of Chinese rhetoric, Beijing has so far refrained from taking drastic military actions to resolve the issue. More broadly, China continues to prefer stability over chaos. Part of this is a habit of political culture, but also reflects its perceived long-term interests; as the former UK ambassador to North Korea, Alastair Morgan, put it in a research interview, “if it can help it, China prefers not to smash up a system it would like to inherit”. Even under Xi, China has shown itself minded to take a gentler approach than Russia in pursuit of long-term strategic interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Charles Parton, the overall Chinese approach might be described as Bismarckian, after the 19th-century Prussian and German chancellor who pursued the long-term goal of German unity, while being flexible about the manner and timing of its attainment. China seems unlikely to ape Russia, therefore, but it is probable that its current range and depth of hostile activities will continue. Commercial espionage is central to China’s drive towards economic, political, and military pre-eminence, and little will constrain this – even warnings from the West. As President Obama found after a summit with Xi in September 2015, a Chinese promise to reduce commercial cyber espionage was soon discarded. China also remains highly focused on using subversive techniques to reshape the world in its own interests. Ragnar Ingibergsson observed in interview that “the CCP will play the ambiguities of the current system, stretch its boundaries, cheat and so on, to create new and more favourable precedents.” The strategy is “to change the character of the playing field and the rules of the game. That is how it intends to win”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a possibility – if not necessarily a likelihood – that China will increase the range and intensity of its hostile activities against Western countries. This could arise as a natural function of Beijing’s desire to translate its latent power into coercive political capital, especially if Western powers are resistant. China sees itself as the natural leader of the world; if it feels unbound by past constraints, it could decide to impose its own order upon the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, China’s preference for avoiding unnecessary conflict suggests that hostile acts will mostly follow rather than precede perceived outside provocations. The most significant provocation in Chinese eyes would be support for Taiwan or another South-East Asian country against Chinese coercive action. However, China has already shown itself to be easily roused to anger by much less. China has also become increasingly paranoid about potential US penetration, with domestic espionage prosecutions escalating in recent years. As more aspects of Chinese domestic policy are “securitised”, Economy observes, “virtually any issue can now be labelled a threat to Chinese sovereignty or social stability”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China does undertake more hostile activities against Western states, however, they are likely to be carefully calibrated escalations, not wild swipes. Bold acts of assassination or large-scale physical sabotage seem unlikely, although China’s behaviour in the South and East China Seas suggests that it could use non-state actors such as its civilian fleet to take disruptive action against Western supply lines and communications. A more likely venue for escalating Chinese hostility against Western countries is cyberspace. Allen notes that China’s concept of “internet sovereignty” has stretched well beyond its borders in recent years, making itself the self-appointed arbiter of China-related online discussion, regardless of location. This could translate into even more aggressive attempts to use cyber tools to quell overseas dissent and criticism, stir up domestic troubles for opponents or undertake more ambitious cyber effects operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9.1.3. Iran&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Iran, the standoff between its theocratic regime and the West is likely to remain much as it has done since 1979, with the key question being how intense that standoff will be. The death of the president, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash in May 2024, followed by the election of reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian as his replacement in July, has led some to hope for an easing of tension, something which President Pezeshkian has encouraged. However, despite the removal of one of the most hardline figures in the regime in Raisi, there are few signs of a softening of Iran’s posture towards the West. Much of the power over external policy lies in the hands of Ayatollah Khamenei, who is both highly conservative and strongly aligned with the IRGC. There are, moreover, few reformists in contention to replace Khamenei when he dies. Experts assess the most probable successor to be Khamenei’s son, Mojtaba, whose associations with conservative elements in the regime suggest continuity rather than change. Even if a reformist successor were to emerge, however, they too would face strong structural constraints that would make it difficult for the regime to change its current trajectory even if it wished to. Since February 2022, Iran has become increasingly enmeshed in a political, economic and military relationship with Russia, which presupposes a hostile position towards the West. Since October 2023, Iran has also become trapped in relationships with groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, making its confrontation with Israel and its Western allies hard to avoid without appearing weak. Tehran, Ali Ansari commented in interview “has become trapped in a dynamic where it must demonstrate resistance to Israel, the Gulf states and the West, and assert its regional dominance – even when doing so is not really in its interests to do so”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State threats are thus likely to remain an appealing approach to Iran, due to limited resources, and a fundamental desire to avoid provoking a war with the US and its allies. The intensity and scope of these activities might increase, however, if Iran felt emboldened by Russian support, or if regional conflict in the Middle East escalated, and the US and its allies were to provide extensive support to Israel. In such circumstances, Iran could use its existing relationships with terrorist partners to target Western interests beyond North America and Europe, in regions such as Latin America and Africa. Iran could also expand its overseas campaign of intimidation against Iranian dissidents or even Western officials, perhaps using OCGs to undertake these tasks. If validated, media reports in September 2024 of an Iranian plot to assassinate President Trump could also suggest a growing appetite in the Iranian regime to escalate tensions and take increasingly provocative actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9.1.4. North Korea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dynamic like the one shaping Iranian behaviour also affects North Korea. As James Byrne noted during interview, “the basic ethos of the Kim regime is antithetical to the West. It’s been like that for generations, and most likely always will be”. The pattern of history suggests that this is unlikely to change under Kim Jong Un’s eventual successor; indeed, hopes of reform from this Swiss-educated leader following his own rise were quickly dashed. Certainly, the regime has sought opportunities to negotiate with the US over its nuclear status, as demonstrated by talks during Trump’s first term. However, those discussions ran aground in 2019 over differing expectations about what could be achieved, especially on sanctions relief. This seems unlikely to shift even following Trump’s re-election in November 2024; without the prospect of a deal with the US, North Korea has little incentive other than to move closer to Russia and China and take an adversarial stance towards the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pyongyang is thus unlikely to see a good reason to curb its basic hostility to the US and its allies. Byrne noted that North Korea has few legal or moral qualms about undertaking extreme and hostile acts; it has “no ethical or moral compass we would recognise. They have few limits. They kill on a whim”. Fear of provoking the West is thus likely to have less purchase in Pyongyang than Tehran, given its possession of WMD and geographic proximity to China. What has limited and constrained North Korea so far, Byrne concludes, is not so much a lack of intent, but a lack of resources; “it’s been hard for them to do anything other than focus on issues of survival over recent decades”, he notes, “but there can little doubt that the more secure they feel, the more aggressive a stance they will take”. Morgan judged that the recent shifting alignments of Russia and China following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine would also have increased North Korea’s risk appetite. “North Korea sees the situation in Ukraine and its consequences as an epochal opportunity, which it can exploit for its own ends”, he notes: “They will not want to waste it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means in practice is difficult to know. Some analysts assess that North Korea is potentially preparing for a “bolt from the blue” military attack against the South. While possible, however, it seems unlikely, especially without Chinese and Russian support. What seems more probable is an intensification of what has gone before – more overt sabre-rattling, missile launches and possibly even further nuclear tests. In the covert world, North Korea’s cybercrime exploits and other criminal activities to procure and fund weapons proliferation will continue, as will cyber espionage, cyber effects operations, and online disinformation, especially against South Korea, Japan and the US. Current performative acts such as dropping rubbish-filled balloons over South Korea will also persist. There is a risk, moreover, that in the event of a period of heightened tension such apparently clownish exploits might escalate into more dangerous actions, such as using toxic waste instead of rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;92-capabilities&quot;&gt;9.2. Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military thinkers see capability as the ability to have a desired effect, tangibly translating human capital, technical knowledge and appropriate kit into a successful outcome. The most basic elements of military capability are seen as coming from a country’s economic strength and population size. Size matters less in the world of covert action, of course; Israel, for example, has developed a reputation for mounting sophisticated covert operations, despite being a country of less than 10 million people. Nonetheless while small states can have a major impact, larger, richer and more advanced states continue to have an advantage. Size does not assure success, but it helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9.2.1. Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is one of the world’s largest advanced economies, and usually sits within or just outside the global top ten ranking for national income. Despite facing a raft of sanctions on its military, technology and revenue-generating hydrocarbon industries, moreover, Russia’s economy has continued to grow since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The International Monetary Fund expects it to grow the fastest among the advanced economies in 2024. Its state intelligence agencies continue to be robustly funded, and despite some criticisms of their early performance in Ukraine in 2022, recent research suggests they have managed to regroup and improve their performance. Even if Russia were to lose the war in Ukraine, moreover, it would retain its covert capabilities and ability to mount hostile operations beyond its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Russia should not be over-estimated, either. Despite the surface positives, the country is highly dependent on exporting natural resources and is in steep demographic decline. Russia has a falling number of technologically educated young people, which will drain the cyber capabilities of the Russian agencies over time. More immediately, Russia is also facing a serious drain on its available resources due to the war; in the cyber sphere, for example, conducting offensive operations, espionage, pre-positioning and information operations targeting Ukraine has probably made it more difficult to spare state resources for operations further afield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More aggressive counter-espionage activities by Western agencies have also limited Russian access to targeted areas, with a growing number of expulsions and prosecutions denuding Russian intelligence networks in Five Eyes and European countries. Numerous Russian officers operating under legal cover in embassies and consulates have been expelled from Western states since 2014, and there has been a recent spate of arrests of Russian illegals in Europe and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to these challenges, and as noted previously, Russia has increasingly turned to a variety of non-state actors, on which it has relied to supplement or act on behalf of the state. PMCs have become especially important overseas; as Magda Long noted in interview, “Russia is becoming especially dependent on quasi-state [agencies] like Wagner when it comes to ‘out of area’ activities in places such as sub-Saharan Africa.” Closer to home, the Russian state continues to maintain close links to the realms of organised and cybercrime, and shows signs of using OCGs more often, and for a wider range of covert activities. Prelec has noted that since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there has been “an unambiguous trend” towards the politicisation of cybercrime groups. More generally, there has been an increasing “weaponisation of the Russian shadow empire” in Eastern Europe, through illegal trafficking, counterfeiting and money laundering, according to a UK official interviewed for this project. The spread of Russia’s criminal relationships is not just linguistically driven, moreover, and has extended to OCGs in eastern and central European countries such as Bulgaria. But while these additional “secret” and “not-so-secret” armies of non-state actors in some ways enhance Russia’s capabilities and ability to access targets overseas, they are not an unambiguously positive asset. As noted in the previous section, working with non-state actors brings myriad problems around performance and control, which are likely to exacerbate the difficulties already inherent in conducting covert activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9.2.2. China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China currently faces several domestic challenges, such as declining demographics, weak consumption, a stagnant property market and receding foreign direct investment. Corruption and favouritism also remain problems, despite Xi’s anti-corruption drive, and there is growing evidence that the Chinese bureaucracy has become less efficient and more risk averse under Xi. Nonetheless, of the four main revisionist states, China is by far the strongest economically, politically and militarily. The size of China’s economy remains on an upward trajectory and there are no indications this is likely to collapse soon. The country also boasts one of the largest security and intelligence apparatuses in the world, which Western intelligence officials estimate to number around 600,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, China is, and is likely to remain, well-resourced and in a position to conduct covert and clandestine activities, with large and increasingly professional intelligence agencies, and impressive cyber capabilities. Supplemental to these, the state also has access to a vast range of legitimate and illegitimate non-state actors to act as auxiliaries to enable Chinese state power throughout the world. As Parton observed in interview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the Chinese state and party have potential global reach, well beyond official networks. The Chinese diaspora is vast [and] increasingly influential and much of it has no choice but to cooperate with the CCP, given relatives and other ties back in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 60 million people of Chinese heritage live outside China, which, Allen notes, is a figure roughly the same size as the population of Italy. Patriotic Chinese OCGs provide further auxiliary power, with a presence in many Western countries. Although these have largely not been seen through a state threats lens so far, however, they have substantial capacity to act on behalf of Chinese interests. Taken together, these informal networks have the potential to operate, in Parton’s words, “as a huge informal ecosystem through which the CCP can attain its goals”, although the willingness of these networks to cooperate should not be taken for granted. “Elements of the Chinese diaspora are subject to pressure, but they are not innately disloyal to their home countries”, he observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9.2.3. Iran and North Korea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran and North Korea are both much smaller than China and Russia, and correspondingly weaker when it comes to their covert capabilities. As discussed in previous sections, both have been subject to a range of withering UN and Western sanctions for several decades, and the regimes of both are fragile. Issues of succession continue to plague both regimes, while economic difficulties undermine regime stability. In interview, Ansari described Iran as “a failed state waiting to happen”, a descriptor that could easily be applied to North Korea too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has translated into relatively less wide-ranging covert capabilities in comparison to the larger revisionist states, a fundamental that will not change. This said, however, for states that have been treated as pariahs by much of the international community for many decades, both also enjoy valuable assets. North Korea’s world-class cyber capability shows no signs of decline. Iran has well-resourced and professional intelligence agencies, which have the facility to operate through a robust diplomatic network, and diaspora communities in Europe and North America. Iran also has relations with non-state actors on which it can draw, although Israeli military efforts in 2024 against Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are likely to have undermined these pro-Iranian groups’ capabilities severely, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent shift in geopolitical tectonics gives further grounds to believe that both countries will at the very least be able to sustain their capabilities and possibly even expand them. Their burgeoning relationships with Russia and China have certainly provided new hope for economic aid and opportunities to grow without access to the Western financial system. As Byrne noted of North Korea, “Now that Russia and China have opened the gates, it will stay poor, but it will be less of a scavenger.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9.2.4. The role of partnerships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which Iran and North Korea will be able to look to China and Russia to bolster their covert capabilities raises the broader question of the impact of a growing partnership between the four states collectively. In a strategic sense, the current dynamic favours closer ties and cooperation; all four share common concerns about the fragility of their regimes, and a desire to pursue national agendas contrary to the Western concept of the rules-based order. Despite their obvious differences in ideology and outlook, Iran, Russia, China and North Korea sit together in what Tobias Borck, previously RUSI senior research fellow for Middle East Security Studies, described in interview as “the same revisionist pot”, united in their shared dislike of the US and its rules-based international order, and at least somewhat willing to look past each other’s conflicting interests. The anonymous China expert interviewed for this project argued that the cornerstone relationship between the two most significant powers, Russia and China, was unlikely to fall apart any time soon. “While there is much that divides them, their shared dislike of the status quo is much stronger”, the expert observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shared interests have already translated into growing levels of general cooperation between the core revisionists; cross-pollination of tradecraft has begun to take place in the fields of cyber operations, disinformation and sanctions evasion. As relationships develop further, it is possible that growing cooperation between the states will spill over into more covert activities, providing a force multiplier for the capabilities of individual states. Nevertheless, some limits are likely to remain because of the sensitivity of the methods used in covert acts. It is not yet apparent that any such boundaries have been reached; the more difficult the environment, the more likely it seems that states will be willing to cooperate in sensitive areas. It seems probable therefore that the revisionist states will inch forward with the pooling of knowledge, and possibly some direct operational collaboration, especially if they perceive the potential benefits of success to outweigh the risks. While any such joint working arrangements will be difficult to manage, it is not beyond the realms of imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9.2.5. Emergent technologies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further dimension in the capability question is the potential for technological innovation to enhance state capabilities, much in the way that cyber has already done. The use of drones in conflict zones such as Ukraine has shown how new technology can enhance states’ military capabilities, allowing cheaper and potentially more deniable means of attack, which have the potential to be used in peacetime too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant area of development, however, has been the emergence over the past decade of the variety of computational tools that come under the umbrella of AI. Among the most widely discussed AI tools of the moment are: machine learning, which applies flexible algorithms to large amounts of data to learn patterns and then apply them to new data; generative AI, which uses deep learning models to create new textual, visual and sound content; and agentic AI, which features autonomous agents that can complete complex multi-stage tasks without human guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smeets suggests that AI tools have significant potential to upgrade states’ cyber espionage and effects capabilities in various ways, by improving the speed and accuracy of “fuzzer” programs, used by hackers to identify vulnerabilities in systems; enhancing social engineering with adaptable agents capable of tailoring their approach to humans; and creating versions of malware that are able to mimic legitimate software, avoid detection and propagate at speed across networks. He also suggests that generative AI will potentially enable bad actors to create and distribute disinformation of better quality and at higher speeds and volume than at present. In 2024, a year of many elections, this last “use case” was of particular concern, as observers expressed fears that electoral processes might be subverted by “deepfake” news stories based on manipulated images and voices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is in detectable current use, moreover. Microsoft has reported that Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have been experimenting with AI large language models to support their cyber espionage and effects operations. Separately, technology firm OpenAI has claimed that Russia, China and Iran have used generative AI in disinformation operations, crafting fake comments and articles in various languages, generating names and bios for social media accounts, as well as applying it to more technical tasks such as debugging code. Both the Chinese and Iranian governments allegedly used AI-generated disinformation content during the US presidential election in 2020. In a further recent case, an unknown actor used AI-generated material to produce a fake audio recording of Michal Šimečka, the leader of the centrist Progressive Slovakia party, planning to rig the election. The clip was posted on Facebook just before voting started in the Slovakian general election in September 2023, which Šimečka lost. It is not clear to what extent the recording affected the result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite legitimate concerns about the impact of AI, however, fears need to be tempered with evidence. In terms of its negative impact so far, whether in the fields of cyber espionage, effects or subversion, the there is some evidence to warrant a sceptical view of the scale of the danger AI poses. Despite the promise of generative AI, for example, leading models still produce weird “hallucinatory” content, which undermines the technology’s overall credibility. AI is not just a weapon for bad actors, moreover, and as Smeets highlights, it can be used defensively too, detecting and patching vulnerabilities through autonomous mechanisms, and watching for, and reacting to, hostile actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a technology of the undoubted power of AI, therefore, experts and non-experts alike need to chart a path between hysteria and complacency, recognising both AI’s potential and constraints. For instance, research has found that even while deepfakes are hard to produce, “cheapfakes”, created with easily accessible software, are very easy to generate and seem to be just as effective at bamboozling those exposed to them as the more sophisticated alternative. On the other hand, AI as it is now is not necessarily as it will be in three, five or ten years’ time. The potential for rapid improvements and the discovery of new offensive use cases cannot be ruled out or ignored, but Freedman’s warnings about over-reacting to the dangers of new technology always needs to be kept in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similarly balanced approach is also appropriate in another area of technology that has caused much recent excitement: quantum computing. According to its supporters, quantum computers will use quantum bits (or qubits) to store more data possibilities than the binary bits of classical computing, thus massively increasing processing power and computational speed. Such computers would theoretically have vast potential, especially in supporting scientific and medical research. From the perspective of state threats, moreover, they would also have the power to crack existing methods of encryption in days or hours, expanding the possibilities of cyber espionage. No secret would be safe. Nonetheless, caution is required in this instance, just as much as with AI, and in fact, probably more so. Despite advances in recent years, even the promoters of quantum computing admit that the powerful platforms they envisage have not yet been fully realised. Expert surveys suggest that it will be the late 2030s before a quantum computer will be able to crack current encryption standards, and firms such as IBM are already confident that “quantum-safe” or “post-quantum” cryptography that relies on complex “lattice” mathematical problems will be effective. This does not mean, of course, that quantum computing cannot or will not have a decisive effect on cyber espionage, but we are not at that point yet, and we have both the time and means to hand to mitigate the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;93-opportunities&quot;&gt;9.3. Opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final element of the threat calculation is the quantity and quality of opportunities a potential hostile actor enjoys. Viewed from the perspective of potential targets, opportunities might alternatively be described as vulnerabilities. As discussed in the previous section, Western societies have shown considerable resilience so far, and many governments have begun to take further measures to reduce vulnerabilities or strengthen their defences; however, as Ingibergsson noted, open societies “provide a wide ‘attack surface’, that can be instrumentalised to cause pain”. Western governments’ efforts have reduced some opportunities for their opponents, but have far from “bullet-proofed” the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key question is how far contemporary resilience efforts can go in open societies. For physical or tangible targets subject to the threat of damage – data and information, critical national infrastructures, cyber infrastructure, borders and even people – there is significant scope and precedent for action, as indicated by concerted efforts to protect key targets from terrorism in the past two decades. Governments’ increasing focus on investigating and disrupting hostile acts by state actors, as well as reinforcing public and private cyber security, and the protections around economic infrastructure indicate these vulnerabilities can be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is still a great deal to do. The gap between the rhetoric of resilience and the patchy reality is perhaps most obvious in cyber security. Despite years of government exhortation, new laws and regulations, the creation of new institutions and numerous highly publicised breaches, much of the private sector remains vulnerable, using cheaper legacy systems or new platforms that do not have security built in as standard. This is a major problem when it comes to protecting CNI, much of which lies in private hands in Western states. In the US, for example, 85% of CNI is privately owned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges in the domestic arena are multiplied for the international economy. Global trade, travel, finance and communications infrastructures are open to disruption by unexpected events, such as pandemics, extreme weather and volcanic eruptions, but also human attacks, as the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea demonstrated in September 2022. Many of these infrastructures are extremely vulnerable. A recent Cityforum report on resilience noted how difficult it is to protect or monitor assets such as submarine communications cables are,; by way of example, the report noted that around 9,000 km of submarine infrastructure on which the EU depends were “in inhospitable and remote parts of the oceans”. Such infrastructures are typically not the clear responsibility of a single government or international organisation, and there are no common rules for assigning responsibility for acts of sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If protecting tangible targets has posed difficulties for open societies, then less concrete or visible problems such as subversion have been even more problematic. Western politics, framed as they are around regular elections, have a preference for tackling easily identifiable and relatively short-term challenges, and have a tendency to privilege political and economic freedom over security concerns. In fairness, several Western governments have begun to address issues of democratic resilience, with a significant amount of energy going into the generational challenge of building information resilience in schools and other institutions. But they have still found it difficult to find an acceptable balance between freedom and security, especially in relation to regulation of social media. There is a basic presumption in the West that, all other things being equal, freedom should come first. Indeed, there are credible and reasonable grounds for this to be the case if open societies do not wish to become like the closed alternatives with which they disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison to the effort to counter disinformation, however, efforts to tackle malign influence and interference among elites are much less advanced. Why this might be is a matter for speculation. Some optimists might see few problems and thus little need for a sustained effort; pessimists might perceive something deeper and less open to treatment. Pessimists might also see profound risks in tackling such issues openly, because of the potential to increase societal distrust of leaders and democratic institutions. The more cynical might also note how the self-interested concerns of a country’s political class might lead them to quash initiatives that reveal their party’s unsavoury connections or undercut sources of funding. There are multiple reasons not to look, and not to act; it seems unlikely that many Western governments will, without sustained media, civil society or public pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;94-linking-capabilities-and-opportunities&quot;&gt;9.4. Linking capabilities and opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To what extent will the revisionist states be able to use their capabilities to take advantage of the available opportunities? For Iran and North Korea, the balance probably lies in the West’s favour, as neither enjoys great physical access to Western countries, making it difficult, if not impossible, to undertake significant levels of human espionage, hostile intimidation, physical sabotage or malign influence. However, both have effective cyber capabilities and despite Western efforts, new opportunities to exploit Western cyber vulnerabilities continue to appear. Recent reporting has shown several examples of US firms unwittingly hiring North Koreans online because of the difficulty they face in hiring science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates in their home markets. Iran also has a wide range of relationships with non-state actors in Europe and beyond, with direct access to key Western economic interests in the Middle East, especially major shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea, and through partners such as the Houthis, to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, Russian access to Western vulnerabilities is less impressive now than it was six years ago, following the degradation of its HUMINT network in response to its aggressive acts. However, Russian economic and financial interests, including those of its oligarchical class, are still deeply embedded across Europe, despite the sanctions blitz of the past two years. As Belton noted in interview, “one of the big differences we face now from the Cold War is how deeply integrated Russian interests are in our economies, financial systems and political systems”. Russia also continues to have access to Western states through links to OCGs and diaspora communities; to Western interests in the developing world through PMCs; and to Western infrastructure using drones, sea trawlers and other forms of technology that have the potential to be turned into tools of disruption. Moreover, it is possible that Russia has already put in place potential operations where direct access is no longer necessary. As Estonian analyst Kadri Liik has observed, Russia creates “openings and opportunities for causing disruption at a later date”, then “puts them on hold like a beer in the fridge, just in case”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the four core revisionist states, China has the best access to the widest range of Western states. Certainly, Western governments in Five Eyes countries and European states are showing more awareness of Chinese commercial espionage, cyber operations and potentially pernicious political influence and economic penetration. Some have also taken targeted action to reduce China’s role in critical communications technology and national infrastructure. But these initiatives have been more muted than those against Russia, not least because of China’s much greater economic and political heft. In anglophone and European countries, with businesses eager to access large Chinese markets, and domestic consumers keen on Chinese manufactured goods, the appetite to treat exposure to China as a national security interest is more limited. In the EU, in particular, there has been a clear attempt by President Macron and Chancellor Scholz to walk a narrow path on China that seeks to make Western concerns known, while maintaining good political and economic relations. While 19th century Western policy was founded on the need for a Chinese “open door” to Western economic interests, the 21st century equivalent now rests on China having an open door to Western economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, governments have made greater efforts to improve Western security against Russian compared with Chinese interference. China’s diplomatic network has not been subject to major expulsions, and Chinese students and workers travelling overseas have enlarged the already significant global Chinese diaspora. China also continues to enjoy economic interests in the logistical infrastructure and ports of Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. China thus has multiple ways by which it might act against Western states, both overtly and covertly, and directly and remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;95-proliferation-risks&quot;&gt;9.5. Proliferation risks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, beyond the activities of the four core revisionist states, there is a growing risk of state-on-state hostile acts proliferating in various regions across the world. Figure 4 highlights jurisdictions mentioned in this paper that have used one or more different types of hostile acts against or within other states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/tPk79Ml.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: States linked to hostile activities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious category of states of concern are the revisionist states’ closest associates, such as Belarus and Venezuela, which will potentially see greater scope to cause mischief for local rivals and opponents. However, they are not necessarily the most significant risks, as in most instances, their capabilities and opportunities are relatively limited, putting them more in the category of Iran and North Korea than China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of greater concern are the powerful middle powers that do not currently feature on, or only sit near the fringes of, the list of the “usual suspects”. As we have seen, several states such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia are already conducting hostile activities against dissidents overseas, and targeting local rivals with online disinformation and cyber effects operations. These states – often authoritarian or with autocratic tendencies – have similar concerns to the core revisionists about regime stability, and in some cases harbour ambitions to project power and influence across their regions. Considering the febrile geopolitical environment, they face both temptations and imperatives to use and expand their covert hostile activities. This will be even more the case if the leading exploiters of such methods, such as Putin, are perceived as not only getting away with such behaviour, but thriving as a result. Journalist Gideon Rachman observes that the repressive techniques of “strong man” leaders like Putin have become the role models for aspiring autocrats. It is not unlikely that they might also seek to emulate them in the international arena too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a further risk that Western or Western-oriented powers might do the same. As much as a decade ago, political scientist Alexander Cooley noted that some “backsliding democracies” were “beginning to imitate … [authoritarian] practices” at home. More recently, Rachman and others have highlighted how even in established democracies, strong man leaders ‒ Erdoğan in Turkiye, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Modi in India and Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel – have increasingly come to the fore. Such leaders show “contempt for the rule of law” and international norms, as well as a tendency to vilify enemies, both foreign and domestic. Although more constrained by the checks and balances of liberal democracy and the niceties of relationships with the US and others, such states are also exhibiting greater defiance and bravado on the world stage, as India’s apparent willingness to carry out assassinations on North American territory suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both non-aligned and Western-oriented middle powers, the imperative to follow a more aggressive foreign policy is partly a response to geopolitical reality. With the waning of the US as global policeman – a process that seems likely to continue ‒ such states have a pragmatic need to look after their own interests in “tough neighbourhoods” – an argument that Israel has used for many years. Jodi Vittori, an expert in corruption and state fragility interviewed for this project, observed that it was “a weak assumption to think that states which have historically looked to the US for security will always do so in the future”. Discussing the example of the UAE, Vittori commented, “it is a perfect example of the irrelevance of old assumptions. The UAE’s behaviour reflects its beliefs that not only can it not rely on the US, but it may not think it needs to any more”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the core revisionist states have already found, the least risky means of pursuing repressive and aggressive policy goals are state threats, and it is likely that middle powers will follow this pattern. Such methods are well-suited to the needs of smaller powers because, as Naim notes, “[such] advantages and techniques … wear down, impede, undermine, sabotage, and outflank the megaplayers in ways that [they], for all of their vast resources, find themselves ill-equipped and ill-prepared to resist”. Such methods are also becoming increasingly acceptable as tools of statecraft. For example, assassination – once largely eschewed by most states – has become something of a “macho” badge of honour, even for a democracy such as Israel. Cormac reflects on how the use of such tools has become something of a vicious cycle: “states get away with killing because other states get away with killing. As more leaders … go unpunished for using poison or suffocation to despatch enemies, the taboo against killing erodes”. The question then becomes, if everyone else is doing it, why aren’t we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;96-future-scenarios&quot;&gt;9.6. Future scenarios&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the best-case scenario for state threats and hostile acts is that they remain at their current levels; more likely, however, seems to be a middle-case scenario of an increasing intensity and range of hostile actions, among a wider range of states. The worst-case scenario is that the growing use of state threats will trigger open military conflict, although cases of covert activities having that effect in the past are difficult to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, Iran and North Korea, already highly antagonistic towards the West, will seek an increasing variety of ways to challenge and disrupt the US and its allies. The most difficult country to assess is China. While taking a gradually more aggressive stance in several spheres, and cultivating close diplomatic and economic ties with Russia and Iran, China has been nuanced in its approach. This nuance seems unlikely to be discarded unless military conflict ensues in the South or East China Seas, but the trends of recent years suggest that China will increasingly use its resources in an underhand and hostile way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might the middle-case scenario play out? Firstly, states already using hostile acts will probably seek to improve the operational quality and impact of their current activities, as well as increasing the intensity of activities within their current domains of operation. This could lead to several outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More assassination attempts and attacks on dissidents and foreign nationals&lt;/strong&gt;, either through a greater use of non-state actors, or deniable means such as attack drones, and exotic weapons such as poisons or microwave technology some believe are being used to cause Havana syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More ambitious efforts at sabotage and cyber effects operations&lt;/strong&gt; directly against Western states, using both pre-positioned explosives and computer malware, or ad hoc physical attacks by non-state actors working for financial or political incentives, along the lines of lone-actor/small cell models common to contemporary Islamist extremism. Developments might include attacks on ground-based infrastructure such as pipelines, communications cables and transport links. More sophisticated state-led attacks might include efforts to disrupt aerial or space traffic through “accidents” resulting from reckless behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More attempts to overburden Western social and economic systems&lt;/strong&gt;, actively weaponising the operations of OCGs to create chaos and undermine trust in government institutions. OCGs could continue to profit illegally from their core trades such as trafficking drugs, people and weapons, and varieties of theft and fraud and so on, while states with links to such groups could seek to encourage and enable them to increase the scope and intensity of their efforts, specifically as a form of weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More aggressive electoral interference&lt;/strong&gt;, such as attempts to tamper with voter rolls, disrupt electronic voting systems or manipulate social media on the day of election to affect turnout or even rig votes. As Jessica Garland, director of policy and research at the UK Electoral Reform Society, suggested during interview, the combination of means of interference now available to state and non-state actors, made it “a real possibility, a real danger, that a failed election might bring the legitimacy of a democratic system into doubt”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revisionist states will also probably deploy hostile behaviours in a wider range of domains and geographies, responding to targets’ attempts to build their resilience. “Even when a country manages to plug its vulnerability in one area, aggressors can move to a different area or new type of aggression,” writes Braw. “From food supplies to mental health provision, stockpiles of petroleum to media literacy classes … there is a very real truth to this concern that in the modern age pretty much everything can be weaponised”, Galeotti has also observed. Identifying what forms such novel modes of aggression might take is as much a test of the imagination as one of scholarship; as former market trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb famously concluded, true “Black Swan events”, unforeseen or unexpected events with major consequences, are, by definition, not predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps an initial step therefore is to look to the types of hostile activity that have so far been judged as beyond the boundaries of current acceptability. These could include state-sponsored terrorism. Iran already has connections with terrorist groups, and although Hezbollah suffered heavy damage from Israeli attacks in the autumn of 2024, it has retained an extensive international network in Europe and Latin America. Russia and North Korea also have a history, if not a contemporary record, of links to several terrorist groups. Depending on the development of the threat environment, sponsorship of anti-Western terrorist attacks might be revived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further risk is the revival of what Galeotti has called “economic guerrilla warfare”, which has traditionally involved distributing counterfeit money to degrade currencies, or stimulating strikes to cause domestic disruption. In the heavily financialised modern economy, this approach could be applied in several novel ways. One possibility would be to target the individual finances of dissidents or foreign officials; it is not an outlandish prospect; as mentioned, the US considered using it against President Milošević’s bank accounts during the Kosovo war. Another option would be for a hostile state to offload its investments in, for example, a target state’s debt, to destabilise the target state’s economy. Former US Treasury secretary Hank Paulson described how, during the global financial crisis, Chinese officials informed him that Russia had suggested dumping US mortgage debt to destabilise the US economy, an idea which the Chinese said they had rejected. A further possibility, enabled by the growing importance of technology in the role of financial markets, would be to use cyber techniques to tamper with trading algorithms to trigger flash crashes, or distribute disinformation on social media to generate financial panic and bank runs. Considering the complexity and integration of international markets, the options are numerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;97-conclusion&quot;&gt;9.7. Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thus face the prospect of a messy, confusing and dangerous world that is difficult to understand and navigate. Within such a world, Krieg suggests, conflict “exists on a continuum with no clear beginning or no clear end”. As Galeotti describes, “we are heading into an age when everyone may be in at least some kind of a state of ‘war’ with everyone else, all the time, and it is just a matter of degree”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With geopolitical tensions and risk tolerances rising, therefore, states are likely to employ increasingly risky measures. Not only will Western states be increasingly targeted by revisionist states such as Russia and China, but they will also need to survive in an international environment where previously accepted norms of behaviour, far from being universally followed, decline even further in influence. Western states will not only be the targets of hostile action but will also probably suffer collateral damage from acts not directly targeting them. Beyond the West, state-on-state hostile activity is also likely to increase if current trends continue. It will undoubtedly be a more dangerous global environment than the one Western countries currently face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much more dangerous is hard to predict. Novel types of threat will probably emerge, but they are unlikely to be any more the apocalyptic wonder weapon than cyber was originally feared to be. New technologies will bring more offensive potential, but also new tools for defence. A range of constraints on hostile acts, even if looser than before, will also probably remain. Complex operations will continue to be difficult to mount and unexpected events will continue to get in their way. While revisionist states are likely to push the thresholds of risk further, they will probably still avoid actions they believe will trigger a war ‒ unless, of course, it becomes their intention to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An increasingly unwelcoming global situation does not therefore imply apocalypse, but it does suggest an environment as tense as – and much more complex than – the Cold War. How well-prepared Western governments are to cope with this is an open question. Current resilience efforts are likely to help, but so far, these have been intended to make good on past deficiencies, to meet the threat as it is and not as it has the potential to become. Although there is no immediate cause for panic, governments need to consider what more they can do to prepare their societies for an even more tumultuous geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-conclusion&quot;&gt;10. Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Western governments should not be overconfident about the strength of their current position or the adequacy of their current level of response. The corrosive effects caused by persistent hostile activity may indeed begin to show over time, and if the intensity and impact of hostile activity increases, current levels of Western resilience, and the efforts to improve it, may not be enough. As those preparing flood defences in a period of climate change have found, relying on past crises as a measure of likely future dangers is a risky course of action. Records have a bad habit of being broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;101-policy-issues&quot;&gt;10.1. Policy issues&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated at the outset, this paper is not intended to provide an assessment of current or potential policy responses to the state threats issue. Such an assessment would be extensive and cannot be done justice here. However, both the findings of the STT workshops and the research behind this paper suggest a number of policy areas that require further consideration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the real scope and character of the threat&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ It is easy to see state threats in simplistic ways: on one hand, as a return to the Manichean conflicts of the second world war and the Cold War, with the West opposing an authoritarian alliance willing to use hostile acts. There is more than a little truth in this interpretation; Western states are indeed subject to sustained hostile action. However, this situation is part of a wider environmental change in power balances and international norms, where “delinquents” such as Russia and Iran are enlarging the scope for bad behaviour among states more widely. Both elements of the problem need to be addressed in a joined-up way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mutability and variety of hostile activities&lt;/strong&gt; – As we have seen, state threats have various morphologies, with patterns of usage that can vary over time and between states. Any effective policy response thus needs to: (a) be historically grounded; (b) be shaped by current intelligence; and (c) anticipate that patterns and sources of hostile behaviour can and will change. In some areas, Western countries are well-placed to do this because of the high competence of their intelligence agencies, but as several expert interviewees remarked, these agencies have also been woefully under-resourced in linguistic and cultural expertise, especially on Asian societies such as China. Care will also be needed to avoid focusing on novelty alone. Older challenges, such as human-managed espionage, remain just as important as ever and will deserve proper attention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scope of vulnerabilities and dependencies&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Open societies present significant attack surfaces for aggressive states. Considering the trend towards weaponising unconventional means, it is in a government’s interests to understand the full spectrum of the country’s vulnerabilities, even if those vulnerabilities cannot all be addressed at once. At the same time, governments need to understand the full range of their political, economic and social dependencies on other states, assessing their potential for exploitation, and prioritising them accordingly. In theory, a large part of responding to state threats will involve the target-hardening of concrete processes, networks and assets, and people, all of which are comparatively easy to map and measure. However, governments will also need to address the more intangible aspects of democratic and societal resilience, which have often been seen as too hard to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the unhelpfulness of the Western “peace/war” dichotomy&lt;/strong&gt; ‒ Western countries have so far largely categorised how they deal with the problem of state threats in legalistic ways, separating out the behaviours of “peace” and “war” into distinct spheres, and following that same logic in shaping policy. If this continues, Western countries are likely to remain limited and unimaginative in their responses, and will continue to encourage other states to undertake hostile acts that will not be met in an effective way. If this is to be the approach – one based largely on resilience, rather than on either (a) deterring such behaviour or (b) seeking to uphold existing international norms – then it needs to explicitly recognised that Western countries are foregoing opportunities to react or proactively shape the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments will also need to consider how best to organise their responses – the how and the who ‒ giving particular attention to the cross-domain character of state threats and in some instances, such as China, the broader grand strategies of which they will need to be a part. Beyond the US, most Western states – including the UK – have not thought in grand strategic terms for many decades, for various – understandable – reasons. With the nature of the threat as it appears to be, however, this might need to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of this change, it will be all the more important for governments to develop coherent risk assessments of the state threats they face, and integrated strategies across all sectors. Governments will need to develop a “single point of view” on state threats, and effective leadership and coordination mechanisms to guide and oversee strategic implementation, necessitating closer cooperation between agencies and government departments dealing with different dimensions of the same threat, such as law enforcement and intelligence agencies tackling the activity of state-linked OCGs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that so much of the contemporary threat targets the “soft underbellies” of open societies, governments will also need to consider how the public, private and third sectors of society cooperate. Cooperative action will need to be considered across borders too, and how best to manage any multilateral efforts, whether through existing arrangements (such as NATO, Five Eyes, the G7 or EU), their augmentation or dedicated alternative mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key questions governments will have to address, moreover, is how to balance their policy responses between strictly defensive, responsive and offensive measures. In most cases at present, states are following a state-agnostic resilience model, avoiding tit-for-tat or direct responses or active engagement with hostile actors. The one exception is perhaps in cyberspace, where “persistent engagement” with attackers and offensive operations are now in vogue, at least as subjects of scholarly discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the nature of the threat landscape, however, it seems unlikely that this approach will affect the calculations of states that show deeply entrenched hostility towards the West. Western governments will need to consider whether, therefore, they are willing not only to protect themselves, but perhaps react or even escalate in response. How they might do so is a major discussion in its own right, from using covert efforts to sabotage and undermine hostile acts in process, or more offensive measures to disrupt targets of value to the hostile state. Western states need to think hard about how to change aggressors’ “return on investment” calculations, not only by reducing the impact of hostile state behaviours, but also by imposing costs upon them that might change their decision-making processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the spectrum of measures taken, Western governments will need to calibrate how far they are willing to go. Full-spectrum resilience could place demands on open societies that they have not faced for over three decades or even longer. Efforts to identify and root out past and continuing subversion and malign influence, like Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the US presidential of 2016, could have a negative effect on already low public trust in public institutions. There will also be natural and appropriate concerns about the risks of heavy-handed legislation or regulation affecting fundamental freedoms, whether political, social or economic. The cost of upgrading the resilience of existing systems, structures and processes, or better yet building in resilience “by design”, would need to be explicitly accepted by governments, the private sector and the public; checks and balances to protect civil liberties on intrusive legislation, such as legislative renewals and sunset clauses, would need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be external risks too; more offensive measures could trigger escalatory responses and unintended consequences. The disruption of the personal finances of a hostile political leader would certainly pose the risk of reciprocation, and potentially erode the integrity of the international financial system. Quite apart from triggering a hostile response, moreover, such behaviours would have a potentially degrading effect on the West’s idea of itself, its standards and its wider reputation. Most Western governments continue to agree with former US secretary of state and national security advisor Henry Kissinger’s judgement that “we need an intelligence community that, in certain complicated situations, can defend … national interests in the gray area where military operations are not suitable and diplomacy cannot operate”. But contemporary policymakers are wary too of reverting to some of the excessive behaviour of US intelligence agencies during the Cold War, which had such damaging domestic and international effects on the US government’s reputation. Western states take pride in their liberal heritage, and understand themselves to be acting to high standards. While far from completely innocent, most cleave close to this line, eschewing the full spectrum of hostile activities other states might use; when covert activities are applied, they are usually circumscribed within legal and ethical bounds intended to maintain proportionality. Were legal and ethical tolerances to change dramatically, and the consequences of these changes to become public, it could have dramatic and negative effects on public trust in the institutions of government. It would, in addition, pose wider risks to the reputation of Western states as upholders of international standards, feeding Russian and Chinese narratives about “Western hypocrisy”, and further undermining the integrity and stability of the rules-based order the West supports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;102-research-agenda&quot;&gt;10.2. Research agenda&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such policy changes will not occur without a broad evidence base, however; further research should also play an important role in supporting the development of relevant policy responses. Notwithstanding this paper, more needs to be done to identify and, if possible, quantify the patterns and morphologies of state threats by source, type and method. There is a strong case for partnerships between government, academia and policy research to pool their knowledge to develop a more sharply defined and potentially quantitative picture of the threat, with possible projects including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An independent &lt;strong&gt;state threats database&lt;/strong&gt; to capture trends over time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A detailed &lt;strong&gt;evaluation of state threats’ effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt; through a wider range of available criteria and heuristics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An evidence review/horizon scan of &lt;strong&gt;emerging and future threats&lt;/strong&gt;, and trends in weaponisation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A stocktake of Western country’s key &lt;strong&gt;vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt; to, and &lt;strong&gt;dependencies&lt;/strong&gt; on, hostile, potentially hostile and non-aligned states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, governments need to develop a better understanding of the range of responses that are being deployed ‒ and might yet be deployed ‒ by states to tackle a variety of hostile threats. This could include evidence reviews and assessments of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multilateral and state &lt;strong&gt;strategies and policies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Approaches towards the “intangible” &lt;strong&gt;challenges of political and social resilience&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historic policy approaches&lt;/strong&gt; to analogous domestic challenges (such as the Cold War or the threat from international terrorism post-9/11).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The role and risks of &lt;strong&gt;potential models of “forward defence” or “offence”&lt;/strong&gt;, in keeping with Western norms and standards that could be applied alongside a resilience-based approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The potential to &lt;strong&gt;weaponise Western areas of strength&lt;/strong&gt;, such as economics, trade and finance, or even intelligence collection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper further demonstrates that the challenge of state threats needs to be looked at in a broader context than simply “the West versus the rest”. Geopolitical climate change is affecting the behaviour and normative standards of a wide range of states, including important non-aligned middle powers. This development thus deserves further dedicated review, both from the perspective of the scale, scope and character of these powers’ use of hostile activity, and also in consideration of anti-proliferation techniques that might be used to discourage its spread. Although not as pressing a challenge as that posed by the four core revisionist states, middle powers pose a future risk better addressed now rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

President Trump’s aggressive engagement strategy, greater Sino-Russian cooperation, and NATO’s Scandinavian enlargement will likely shape the region’s security landscape for the coming years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches, Arctic countries have fully awoken to a new security paradigm in the region. With Sweden and Finland completing their NATO accession process in 2024, all seven non-Russian Arctic countries have emerged clear-eyed about the security threat posed by the Kremlin. The increasing frequency of interference with critical infrastructure across Northern Europe—combined with Europe’s mostly timid response—highlights that Arctic states are far from fully ready to operate in this new security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this edition of Northern Connections, experts examine three issues that will heavily influence the trajectory of the region’s security landscape. Collectively, the three articles illustrate the novel challenges facing a region that was long characterized by Arctic exceptionalism—the common understanding that unwritten rules, beliefs, and history protected the region from great power rivalry. For one, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump’s unconventional approach to international diplomacy is putting pressure on the internal cohesion among Arctic NATO states. Trump’s notion that U.S. ownership and control of Greenland is “an absolute necessity” for national security purposes is straining the bilateral relationship between the United States and Denmark, and the delicate relationship within the Kingdom of Denmark between Denmark and Greenland. Moreover, the increasing alignment of Russia and other revanchist powers has cast a shadow over the Arctic, as Sino-Russian cooperation has enabled China to expand on its limited foothold in the region. Lastly, Sweden’s and Finland’s accession into NATO will offer both opportunities and challenges in furthering the already robust defense integration among the four Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first article, Marc Jacobsen from the Royal Danish Defence College examines Greenland’s 2024 foreign, security, and defense policy in the context of shifting Arctic security dynamics. He argues that increased international interest in the territory—particularly overtures from President-elect Trump—has positioned Greenland favorably in its quest for both short-term economic and political gains and its longer-term ambitions for independence from Denmark as a sovereign nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second article, Rebekka Åsnes Sagild from the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies at the Norwegian Defence University College evaluates the state of Sino-Russian cooperation in the European Arctic from China’s perspective. She argues that as China’s attempts to increase investments and research projects in the region have faltered, Beijing has begun adopting a more pragmatic stance that prioritizes economic viability over geopolitical symbolism. While China’s footprint in the region will likely remain limited, the potential development of Chinese dual-use research, a troubling pattern of sabotage incidents, and increasing maritime transport activity in the region warrant increased scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third article, Eskil Jakobsen and Øystein Solvang from the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) examine new opportunities to integrate and expand the combat firepower of Nordic countries following Sweden’s and Finland’s accession to NATO. They argue that NATO can achieve highly effective defense and deterrence in the Nordic region through improved integration, pooling of assets, and cooperation between key allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.” While announcing his nominee for the next U.S. ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark on the social media platform Truth Social, President-elect Donald Trump made his position on the Danish territory clear. However, the reality of Greenlandic politics since the summer of 2019—when Trump first floated the idea of purchasing Greenland—indicates that the next step for Greenland’s self-government is decidedly not to become an integrated part of the United States. Instead, the short-term aim is to strengthen Greenland’s autonomy on the international scene, an important element in the long-term ambition of becoming a sovereign state. This position is made clear in a recent strategy document developed by Greenland’s self-government, which is “essentially an expression of a Greenland that, in cooperation with others, is progressing towards independence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document outlines defense and diplomatic endeavors for the country, with special attention on how dependency on Denmark could be lessened through new and existing international relations. Scholars have recently provided a tour d’horizon of the policy’s content and context, while others have analyzed its use of ethos, logos, and pathos. Meanwhile, Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen and I have previously argued that the strategy’s implementation is likely to facilitate better cooperation between Greenland’s capital city of Nuuk and Copenhagen in terms of security and defense. This article first uses the new strategy to explain how Greenland positions itself within the changing Arctic security environment. It then analyzes how amplified U.S. attention and Denmark’s growing interest in Arctic affairs have contributed to further developing Greenland’s diplomatic capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;greenlands-envisioned-role-in-the-changing-arctic-security-environment&quot;&gt;Greenland’s (Envisioned) Role in the Changing Arctic Security Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its 2024 strategy, Greenland’s priorities broadly have three foundations: (1) looking ahead to Greenland’s future independence; (2) grounding strategy in Inuit culture; and (3) prioritizing values shared by Greenland’s friends and allies, such as democracy, human rights, and respect for international law. These fundamentals serve as underlying reasons for establishing and enhancing Greenland’s international relations while also delineating non-allied countries and potential adversaries, with the latter seldom explicitly mentioned by name and instead merely referred to as “certain countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the adversarial countries is surely Russia, which Greenland has traditionally been less skeptical toward than Denmark. However, the invasion of Ukraine has had a seismic effect and caused Greenlandic decisionmakers to expand their view on the security challenges facing the West. As such, Greenland swiftly joined EU sanctions against Russia, despite not being a member of the bloc. Moreover, defense matters have subsequently appeared more frequently in Greenland’s political discourse, including in discussions on whether Nuuk could be a potential bomb target by the Kremlin because it is home to Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the 2024 strategy repeatedly emphasizes pacifist values rooted in Inuit culture, it leaves no doubt that Greenland will continue to be part of the Western alliance. Nuuk’s commitment to Western institutions is also underlined by the inclusion of a Greenlandic diplomat within Denmark’s permanent representation at NATO. Similarly, the document articulates a desire for Greenlanders to take a more active role in Danish sovereignty enforcement through participating in the Joint Arctic Command and the Sirius Patrol, establishing an administrative unit at the U.S. Pituffik Space Base, and eventually creating a nonmilitary coast guard of its own. These proposed initiatives reflect Nuuk’s state-making ambitions in which protection of Westphalian sovereignty is a cornerstone. In this regard, Iceland serves as inspiration for how Greenland may cope with deteriorating Arctic security dynamics through nonmilitary means—thus adhering to Nuuk’s pacifist values—while transitioning from a Danish colony to a sovereign state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy also represents a sober awareness of Greenland’s inevitably geostrategic location, which plays “a key role in the defense of the United States against external threats, especially from the Arctic region,” according to the document. Although it describes overt military threats as pertaining primarily to the United States, the document places the most immediate and direct threats to Greenland in the gray zone of conflict, including malicious cyberattacks and potential sabotage of crucial infrastructure. Regarding the security of critical infrastructure, the strategy emphasizes that “we cannot and shall not allow this infrastructure to be owned by foreign entities. This is essential for the safety of our people and our society.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Societal security is thus very high on the agenda in Greenland, where recent cyber espionage attacks, which left the government apparatus largely incapacitated, and severe power outages have demonstrated the vulnerability of the small, remote community. Combined with experiences from the Covid-19 pandemic and debates surrounding Huawei’s bid for 5G in the Faroe Islands, supply chain security and protections for strategic infrastructure from hostile actors are increasingly salient topics. In addition to the matter of ownership, the strategy emphasizes the importance of enhancing expertise, forging contingency plans, and strengthening cybersecurity capabilities, the last of which is done in close cooperation with the Danish Centre for Cyber Security, which describes the cyber threat level to Greenland as “very high.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenland’s most recent addition to its critical infrastructure is an extension of the Nuuk airport that will enable international connections, including a direct flight to New York beginning in the summer of 2025. Favorable loans from Denmark enabled the extension. The agreement essentially prevented involvement from a Chinese construction entrepreneur—in the process effectively limiting Chinese presence on the North American continent. Relatedly, while U.S. interest in Greeland has increased of late, Chinese interest in the country’s mining potential has cooled off as local legislation and global market prices have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diplomatic-moves-toward-greater-international-agency&quot;&gt;Diplomatic Moves Toward Greater International Agency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s initial idea of purchasing Greenland in 2019 brought renewed interest to the region’s geostrategic importance and mineral wealth while also fueling debate over its future constitutional status. Whereas many Greenlanders received Trump’s idea as a neocolonial provocation driven by the spillover of geopolitical tensions into the Arctic, the increased U.S. attention proved to be a catalyst in the development of the Greenlandic self-government’s diplomatic capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following years, Greenland and the United States cultivated more direct relations after the 2020 opening of a U.S. consulate in Nuuk, an official visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken in 2021, and various so-called economic aid packages earmarked for developing Greenland’s mining sector, education, and tourism. The economic gains from the intensified bilateral relationship, however, are still quite limited. Greenland’s 2024 strategy document frequently returns to this untapped potential through mentions of improved agreements and direct trading routes, while stating that “whenever possible, we intend to intensify our contact with the United States.” In fact, the strategy specifically suggests the establishment of an Arctic North American forum with commerce, communication, and, not least, culture as the founding principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy document also proposes creating a Center for Peace in Greenland to strengthen dialogue and promote peace, an ambition expressed as: “We must remember who we are and our core values.” Interestingly, Japan is mentioned as an attractive source of inspiration due to its track record of promoting peace since World War II. The Greenlandic policy, however, fails to mention that Japan has recently become more militarized due to the threats from North Korea and China, resulting in a historically high defense budget announced in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas China is barely present in Greenland as of early 2025, the country opened a diplomatic representation in Beijing in 2024, primarily to improve its fisheries exports, which constitute more than 90 percent of Greenland’s total exports. Additionally, Greenland maintains diplomatic representations in Copenhagen, Brussels, Reykjavik, and Washington, D.C. The government has also stated that it wants to (re)create a representation in Ottawa, where it previously had one from 1998 to 2002. Greenland’s strategy document explicitly encourages Canada to establish a consulate in Greenland as Iceland, the United States, and, most recently, the European Commission have done. Indeed, Canada announced in December 2024 that they will open a consulate in Nuuk. Moreover, a handful of countries have appointed honorary consuls, including Russia, which appointed the co-owner of major Greenlandic business corporation Polar Seafood as an honorary consul in 2020, though he withdrew in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the years have passed, the war in Ukraine has occupied less and less space in Greenlandic media, which may be part of the reason the country’s politicians seem more open to welcoming Russia back into the Arctic Council. Though the council was paused as a direct consequence of the war, activities have gradually resumed, culminating with welcoming Russia’s virtual participation in particular working group projects in early 2024. In 2025, Greenland, Denmark, and the Faroe Islands will jointly take over the council chairship from Norway, thereby assuming an extraordinary responsibility for securing the council’s survival and, perhaps, shaping it anew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denmark’s increased interest in Arctic affairs and the impending chairship have further boosted Greenland’s efforts to gain more foreign policy authority, seen in the strategy document’s repeated emphasis that Denmark’s status as an Arctic state depends on Greenland’s geostrategic location and continuous membership in the kingdom. The document’s subtitle, “An Arctic Strategy,” reflects this particularly in two specific issues. The first is the fact that Denmark still does not have an updated joint Arctic strategy, although Greenland’s 2024 strategy clearly articulates support for the development of such a common document. The main reason for this is probably found in the second issue—namely, that Greenland demands that the kingdom’s Arctic ambassador should be Greenlandic. In late 2024, this delicate issue was finally resolved, and it was announced that the new Arctic ambassador will be Greenlandic and will hold office in both Nuuk and Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenland’s international efforts in general and its ambitions for the Arctic Council chairship in particular suggest a confident administration in Nuuk that strategically uses increased international interest to expand its foreign policy options. But ambitions are one thing; being able to fulfill them is another. Greenland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs only has a total of approximately 20 employees at home and abroad, who altogether take care of the country’s diplomatic relations. If action is to follow words, it is inevitable that, in Greenland’s own words, “It will require more resources for Greenland’s diplomatic corps and ministries to implement this strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great power competition between the United States and China, as well as Russia’s full-scale attack on Ukraine, have pushed Greenland toward more firmly positioning itself—and its envisioned future self—within the Western alliance structure. These developments have increased Greenlandic awareness of external threats and instigated the belief that, as expressed in the strategy, “Greenland needs to reduce its vulnerability and generally assume a greater degree of responsibility” in enforcing the sovereignty of its territory. Greenland’s articulated responsibility and enhanced role in its own defense is rooted in a state-making ambition, but that must be pursued in balance with the country’s strong desire for peace and decreased tensions in the Arctic, which is rooted in Inuit culture and traditions. The country’s strategy reveals the tension this balancing act entails: “We must remain realistic. But we must not waver when it comes to peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas the current Arctic security dynamic has brought new risks to Greenland, it has also revealed new opportunities to enhance the country’s self-determination within defense and diplomatic matters that historically have been Denmark’s area of competence. As such, Greenland has secured a seat at Denmark’s defense budget negotiations whenever the Arctic is on the agenda in order to “ensure social sustainability of any new initiatives.” At the same time, increased international interest—particularly amplified U.S. attention and Denmark’s prioritizing of Arctic affairs—has put Greenland in a favorable position from which its self-government seeks to convert interest into concrete economic and political benefits. The strategy’s front page makes this position perfectly clear: “Nothing about us without us.” Though a catchy and reasonable mantra, it may prove practically complicated if Greenland’s limited diplomatic corps must be present whenever Greenland is on the agenda. To meet that ambition, words need to be followed by cool cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Defense’s July 2024 Arctic Strategy clearly delineates the North American Arctic—encompassing U.S territory in Alaska, as well as Canada and Denmark’s autonomous territory of Greenland—from the European Arctic, which includes Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Russia’s Kola Peninsula. In the North American Arctic, China and Russia have exhibited more assertive postures, marked by military aircraft deployments and joint coast guard exercises. In contrast, the European Arctic has so far not seen any joint military activity, though this could change. For the time being, China’s engagement is limited by the region’s remoteness, while the Kremlin’s desire to safeguard critical infrastructure and military installations on the Kola Peninsula, which houses the Northern Fleet and therefore Russia’s strategic nuclear submarines, discourages deeper external involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, several developments warrant scrutiny. These include the potential development of Chinese dual-use research (most prominently ground-based space capabilities on Svalbard), a troubling pattern of sabotage incidents, and the implications of increasing maritime transport activity in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-evolving-arctic-ambitions-navigating-opportunities&quot;&gt;China’s Evolving Arctic Ambitions: Navigating Opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China lacks direct territorial claims in the Arctic, it has been pursuing regional interests opportunistically through international partnerships. While China’s Polar Silk Road (PSR), a part of its Belt and Road Initiative, garnered some temporary hype, the idea has largely disappeared from Chinese discourse. Instead, Beijing is adopting a more pragmatic stance that prioritizes economic viability over geopolitical symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese investment attempts in the European Arctic, excluding Russian territories, have largely faltered due to growing Nordic skepticism and increased government intervention, a trend exacerbated by China’s support for Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine. Countries like Finland, once regarded as a viable partner to China in the Arctic, have substantially altered their approach, canceling Arctic-related projects and omitting Arctic cooperation in their recent Joint Action Plan between the two countries—a decision that surprised long-term observers and marked a significant policy shift. Recent attempts by Chinese companies to invest in regional infrastructure have met consistent resistance as well. A notable example is the shutdown of Chinese interest in the harbor of Kirkenes in northern Norway. Altogether, there appears to be a convergence in Nordic interests to marginalize China’s Arctic presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing tension between Nordic states and China has significantly altered the latter’s opportunities for regional influence. In addition, the enduring suspensions of the Arctic Council and other regional forums have significantly complicated communication between European Arctic states and Russia, raising concerns about long-term regional cooperation. In this complex geopolitical landscape, Russia—facing international isolation following its invasion of Ukraine and grappling with economic constraints due to sanctions—may find itself increasingly compelled to accommodate Chinese Arctic interests simply because the Kremlin has few remaining strategic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;high-altitude-ambitions&quot;&gt;High-Altitude Ambitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s scientific research in the European Arctic extends across multiple locations. The country’s initial research foothold was established in 2004 with the Yellow River Research Station in Ny-Ålesund in Norway, marking China’s first permanent Arctic research facility. This intentionally positioned China to expand its polar research capabilities. Svalbard is a particularly strategic location due to its high-latitude position, giving it a pivotal role in polar-orbiting satellite communication and monitoring as well as in climate change research. In 2016, China expanded its Arctic space infrastructure by setting up a satellite ground station in Kiruna, Sweden, and a research observatory in Kárhóll, Iceland. By 2020, Swedish researchers were raising concerns about the potential military applications of the research, which ultimately led to a contract between the Sweden Space Corporation (SSC) and China giving Beijing access to the company’s antennas not being renewed in 2020. This change demonstrated the growing underlying tensions in China’s Arctic research strategy, the ambiguity of dual-use projects, and Nordic countries’ close scrutiny of Chinese research activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most consequential aspect of China’s Arctic scientific ambitions centers on the development of Chinese ground-based space capabilities, most notably any early warning infrastructure, with Russian aid. Strategic ground-based infrastructure in the Arctic would support Chinese ambitions, and such infrastructure could be concealed as dual-use. To date, however, there is no evidence that this is taking place, although the Norwegian government is following the situation closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, there may be geopolitical dimensions to China’s scientific expansion. As the country advances its global space capabilities, China’s increased physical presence in Svalbard may be disadvantageous to European Arctic security interests and should warrant international concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;arctic-infrastructure-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;Arctic Infrastructure Vulnerabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A worrying pattern of infrastructure sabotage is emerging in the maritime domain, with a growing list of examples in the Arctic and in Northern Europe over the past few years. While not all of these activities have taken place in the Arctic, as the region is characterized by vast areas with little situational awareness, sabotage of critical infrastructure poses a significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, a subsea cable was cut on Svalbard, limiting its reserve capacity. In 2023, two undersea cables just off the Finnish coast were cut by Hong Kong–registered ship the Newnew Polar Bear, which soon thereafter traveled to Russian Arctic waters after the Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish authorities failed to respond due to legal constraints. By August 2024, Chinese authorities had acknowledged the vessel’s responsibility but characterized the damage as an “accident.” The ship’s complex ownership—with offices in Shanghai and Moscow—and the timing of the incident have fueled speculation about potential Russian orchestration. Another example of sabotage involving a Chinese ship was the November 2024 incident involving the vessel Yi Peng 3, which dragged its anchor over 100 miles along the Baltic seabed, severing two critical fiber-optic cables. Unlike the previous event, the Danish navy responded swiftly, tracking the ship for several days. German defense minister Boris Pistorius was unequivocal, stating: “Nobody believes that these cables were cut by mistake, and I’m not going to believe the theory that it was anchors that were accidentally dragged across these cables.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These incidents suggest a potential emerging strategy of infrastructure disruption. Moreover, the pattern raises critical questions about maritime security, infrastructural vulnerability, and the complex geopolitical tensions among China, Russia, and European nations. This strain amplifies the likelihood of low-threshold conflicts, a dynamic that manifests in the Arctic through sabotage targeting critical infrastructure, with Russia often being the primary suspect, potentially leveraging Chinese vessels as proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;increased-arctic-maritime-transport&quot;&gt;Increased Arctic Maritime Transport&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The environmental vulnerability of the European Arctic is hard to overstate. As the war in Ukraine continues into 2025, sanctions imposed on Russia, including wide-ranging recent measures against the Russian oil sector, have impacted the country’s Arctic ambitions. For instance, the Arctic LNG 2 gas production project is facing delays and operational challenges, and is reportedly rusting on the Gydan Peninsula. In response to sanctions prohibiting Russian ships from docking in European ports and blocking EU oil sales, Russia has deployed a “shadow fleet” of oil and gas tankers operating the Northern Sea Route (NSR). In 2023, deliveries to and from China accounted for over 95 percent of transit cargo on the NSR, a new record, which is taking place under increasingly risky conditions. These vessels often engage in spoofing— the deliberate transmission of counterfeit signals to deceive tracking systems. This practice not only facilitates the evasion of sanctions, it also significantly elevates the risk of maritime accidents and environmental disasters. As these poorly maintained, often uninsured or underinsured vessels traverse the Norwegian coast, they create a critical threat to the region’s marine ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the North American Arctic, joint Sino-Russian initiatives in the European Arctic remain limited, primarily due to China’s lack of maritime presence in these waters and its comparatively lower Arctic priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, collaborative activities between Russia and the other Arctic nations have been severely restricted. While some minimal interactions persist—such as Norway’s continued engagement with Russia on limited search-and-rescue operations—most joint initiatives have been dramatically reduced or suspended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is strategically seeking to diversify its Arctic partnerships, with China emerging as a key potential partner. However, the current collaboration remains cautious and incremental. To date, there is little evidence that China has gained substantially greater Arctic access compared to the pre-2022 period. China and Russia’s relationship is characterized by strategic compatibility—particularly in energy trade and a shared desire to challenge U.S. global leadership—yet tempered by underlying mutual caution. As Russia becomes increasingly dependent on China, this delicate dynamic may evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-future-nordic-powerhouse-in-nato&quot;&gt;The Future Nordic Powerhouse in NATO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;eskil-jakobsen-and-øystein-solvang-norwegian-institute-of-international-affairs&quot;&gt;Eskil Jakobsen and Øystein Solvang, Norwegian Institute of International Affairs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Finland and Sweden having joined NATO, new opportunities are emerging on the alliance’s northern flank. The Nordic region can now arguably be described as a common operational area given how the prevalent geostrategic challenges transcend intra-regional borders. Karlis Neretnieks highlights three strategic challenges shared by the Nordic NATO countries: (1) defending the Baltic Sea region, (2) defending the North Calotte, and (3) receiving outside assistance. The defense of Finland’s more than 1,300 kilometers of border with Russia can also be added to this list, as it constitutes approximately half of the NATO-Russia border. Although the Nordic countries share all of these concerns, their strategic priorities do not universally align. Sweden and Finland are oriented toward the Baltic Sea and the Baltic region more generally, while Norway is heavily engaged in the maritime domain in the High North and Denmark maintains a broader strategic outlook. Thus, the implications for the region’s continued defense integration merit consideration to take full advantage of NATO’s Nordic enlargement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, some experts characterized the geopolitical situation in the Nordic region as “the Nordic balance,” with the two superpower blocs holding varying degrees of influence with countries in the region. Denmark, Iceland, and Norway were founding members of NATO. Sweden continued its neutrality policy yet was granted an informal and secret unilateral security guarantee by the United States. In the final years of the Cold War, 45 percent of Swedish defense materiel imports came from the United States. Finland was restricted in its foreign and defense policy by terms imposed by the Soviet Union after the Continuation War (1941–1944).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the implications of Finland and Sweden entering NATO are not to be understated, it is important to note that both countries have cooperated extensively with NATO and relevant member states for decades. As members of the Partnership for Peace, and later as Enhanced Opportunities Partners, the Finnish and Swedish armed forces routinely participated in NATO exercises and invitational exercises hosted by NATO members. Finland and Sweden have also made substantial contributions to allied operations out of area, often in conjunction with other Nordic force contributions. Examples include the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) and Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) in Kosovo, and the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. Through the Nordic Defense Cooperation (NORDEFCO), the Nordic countries have developed strong ties in several areas over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland’s and Sweden’s accession to NATO has improved the conditions for structured and operational defense cooperation in the Nordic region, enabling more integrated defense planning for the entire Nordic region. Forces can be deployed, dispersed, and sustained across borders, and assets can increasingly be pooled among allies, potentially yielding significant gains in combat power and contributing to a more versatile and less vulnerable fighting force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s Regional Plan North West and its Concept for Deterrence and Defense of the Euro-Atlantic Area (DDA) family of plans set the parameters for the ongoing strategy for the Nordic region’s defense, currently being conducted by Nordic military leaders. Concrete planning is well underway and includes Forward Land Forces (FLF) to be built up in Finland under Swedish leadership, new Multi-Corps headquarters, component commands, and enhanced cooperation in all domains. The joint exercise NORDIC RESPONSE 2024, held on the North Calotte (straddling the borders between Finland, Norway, and Sweden), included more than 20,000 troops and focused on collective defense of the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthened cooperation between the Nordic air forces is a particularly promising area. Norway and Denmark are currently introducing F-35s into service, while Finland will receive its first F-35 aircraft in 2026, aiming to reach initial operational capability in 2028 and full operational capability in 2030. Construction work on Finnish operating facilities is already underway, and U.S.-based pilot training will commence in 2025. Sweden already possesses significant air power, with a fleet of about 100 JAS Gripen 4.5-generation combat aircraft. For decades Swedish Gripens have been employed in combined training events with U.S.-produced combat aircraft operated by Finland and Norway. This cooperation purportedly “enhances the combined operational capabilities” of the Nordic countries. Viewed in conjunction with the planned future Nordic fighter fleet numbering approximately 250 aircraft, including 143 F-35s, this cooperation underpins the potential formidability of future combined Nordic air power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pooling of air defense assets is another highly promising opportunity that has become more feasible in the post-accession environment. Sweden operates the U.S. Patriot System for long-range air defense (LRAD); Finland is purchasing the long-range Israeli David’s Sling system; and Norway has announced that it will acquire LRAD as part of its new Long-term Defence Plan 2025–2036. The Norwegian acquisition will fill a crucial capability gap and complement the existing inventory of the short-to-medium-range National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), which is also operated by Finland. Coordinating capacity and sectors of coverage across national borders can offer increased security for the entirety of the Nordic region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By pooling communications and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) assets can yield significant utility in future efforts to deter and defend. Finland, Norway, and Sweden have different specialties and expertise in establishing and maintaining situational awareness on their territories and beyond. Together with the United States and the United Kingdom, Norway provides world-class maritime domain awareness in the High North. Sweden offers significant surveillance capabilities, including a national airborne early warning and control unit, and Finland brings well-developed resources along its vast land border with Russia. Information sharing practices between the three countries are already substantial and mature. Combined defense plans and perceiving the Nordic region as one area of operation will, however, make working toward a single common operational picture for all countries involved even more salient. However, it will take time before all Swedish and Finnish sensors and radar systems are fully NATO compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are significant potential gains to be had through improved cooperation in the land domain. Sweden and, particularly, Finland field substantial ground forces, including several combined arms brigades. After the Cold War, Finland maintained what became Europe’s largest reserve force, aiming to stand up 280,000 troops within one month of wartime mobilization. Following large force reductions culminating in a halt to conscription in 2010, Sweden has expanded its armed forces, with conscription resuming in 2014 and a further expansion in 2018. When tallied up, the combined land forces in the Nordic region amount to approximately 40,000 active-duty personnel, with total reserves of more than 350,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are already significant overlaps in capabilities and equipment. Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden all operate Leopard 2 main battle tanks and CV90 infantry fighting vehicles. In addition, both Finland and Norway employ the K9 Thunder self-propelled gun. Commonality in platforms, spare parts, and ammunition requirements simplifies the achievement of not only interoperability, but also interchangeability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising outlook for improved integration among the Nordic countries on land and in the air, the capability for deterrence and defense in the region is contingent on cooperation with the United States and other NATO allies. The Nordic countries are lacking in key enablers, including air-to-air refueling; joint ISR; and command, control, communications, computers, and information systems (C4IS), particularly relying on U.S. assistance in these areas. Finland, Norway, and Sweden possess some capability for long-range conventional precision strike (LRS), but allied support would still play an important role in this area given the maturity of Russian LRS and air defense capabilities deployed in the region. Furthermore, Norway has run into hurdles in its effort to acquire the cutting-edge U.S. LRS systems PrSM and ER GMLRS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there are challenges that need to be tackled to realize the potential for a future Nordic powerhouse in NATO. The command structure under Joint Force Command (JFC) Norfolk needs to be chiseled out with headquarters possessing adequate capacities for combined-joint command of a variety of ground combat units, surface and subsurface combatants, fighter squadrons, and special operations forces units, including complex ISR and sustainment requirements. The ability of JFC Norfolk to deconflict and coordinate with forces assigned to JFC Brunssum is also important. However, the challenge this represents is sometimes overstated, according to operations staff both in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functioning intra-Nordic logistics is a vital prerequisite for achieving enhanced Nordic combat power in the future. There is strong political will and ongoing efforts toward this functionality in Nordic countries, notably expressed through NORDEFCO. In April 2024, the Nordic ministers of defense signed a declaration entitled Vision for Nordic Defense Cooperation, in which military mobility and logistics were highlighted as areas where enhanced cooperation is planned. In a recently published white paper, the Norwegian government proposed the establishment of a “strategic corridor” to enable increased military mobility in the High North.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to intra-Nordic logistics, it is critical to improve the capacity for reception, staging, onward movement, and integration of U.S. and other allied reinforcements. Such reinforcements will primarily arrive by sea and then be transported over land, necessitating substantial rail capacity, road infrastructure, and various resource depots across the Nordic area of operation. Constructing and linking the infrastructure web necessary for functional logistics across the Nordic region is a major challenge and requires long-term funding and competency within the different lines of effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security in the Nordic region relies heavily on sustained and deepening cooperation with the United States. As a vital ally for all Nordic countries, particularly in a post-accession environment, the United States provides numerous opportunities for optimizing defense relations in the region. The bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreements (DCA) between the United States and Denmark, Sweden, and Finland, respectively, signed in December 2023, and the Supplementary DCA between the United States and Norway, signed in February 2024, point toward continuously blossoming Nordic-U.S. defense relations in the years to come. Recent increases in Nordic defense budgets should also help alleviate potential concerns related to uneven burden sharing. However, so-called “beauty contests,” where the Nordic countries compete for U.S. attention and resources, have been raised as a potential challenge. The severity of such dynamics can be considered negligible if the constructive combined defense planning in the Nordic region continues with full steam ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Nordic defense cooperation must also be viewed in context with the roles other allies play in the region’s security landscape. In particular, the United Kingdom has long played an important role, with a significant footprint in both the Arctic and Baltic regions. During the run-up to Finland and Sweden’s accession to NATO, the United Kingdom concluded mutual security pacts with the two countries and deployed troops on exercises during the ratification process. With Denmark abolishing its EU defense reservations in 2022, the European Union could also take on a more important role in Nordic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through improved integration, pooling of assets, and cooperation between key allies, NATO can achieve highly effective D&amp;amp;D in the Nordic region in the future. The significant maturity of defense cooperation between the Nordic countries will contribute positively to the feasibility of achieving this. Continuously improving cooperation with the United States and other allies will remain crucial to retain the capacity and strategic depth required to stand up a true Nordic powerhouse in NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認在-slack-員工群組下達編採指示&quot;&gt;黎否認在 Slack 員工群組下達編採指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英今早在3名法官不在席下，到庭上閱讀通訊軟件 Slack 的員工群組對話紀錄。辯方大律師關文渭交待指，黎於約10時被懲教人員帶到法庭，並開始閱讀 Slack 群組紀錄，直至約11時半，黎閱讀完畢並通知法庭翻譯員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指出數項訊息被控方錯誤解讀為「編採指示」。辯方遂展示相關訊息，其中一則訊息，黎引述時任動新聞平台總監張志偉對於收費內容的建議，包括有立場的新聞是《蘋果》的「獨有」內容，而該些有立場的新聞可以是監察政府或批評中共，「敢登的傳媒已很少」；黎在未段加上個人評論，表示「同意」。至於獨家專題和專訪片，黎在訊息表示：「獨立專訪和專題片製作單位是很好的建議，因專訪和專題片的重要性愈來愈大。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上否認上述訊息是向員工下達編採指示，因他只是對張志偉的提議表示贊同。此外，有關影片的評論只是提議如何改善新聞及內容質素。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑要求替受壓抑市民發聲屬編採指示-黎否認&quot;&gt;官質疑要求替受壓抑市民發聲屬編採指示 黎否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在訊息紀錄中，有員工指讀者關注習近平體制，提議《蘋果》可以多作深度報導，以及與內地網民保持聯繫，多渠道採訪兼取得新聞片段。黎回應該員工訊息：「以後中國新聞深化報道很重要，因中國舉動對香港影響只會越來越大，好，到時討論。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上否認給予編採指示，稱訊息只是給予提議如何更好地搜集新聞。惟法官杜麗冰指黎的訊息不是說「搜集新聞」，而是說「深化報道」，質疑屬編採指示。黎則回應，他的意思是搜集有深度的新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在另一則訊息中，黎指：「增加踢爆是對的，尤其現在大陸和港府聯手損壞一國兩制，樓價和社會價值觀扭曲，建制舔共的無恥，市民受壓抑很大，需要有擔當的傳媒為他們發聲、出氣，我們應盡量擔當這角色。」黎庭上否認上述訊息在給予編採指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰質疑，黎叫員工報導受建制壓抑的市民，或反對建制派的市民感受，不是屬編採指示嗎？黎則堅稱沒有給予編採指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一則訊息中，有員工提出「新聞條數貴精不貴多」，黎回覆指：「是的，我們應該檢討將一些少讀者看的新聞剔掉，集中把讀者愛看的做到最好及詳細。尤其訂閱後品質最緊要，我們必須做到貴精，多也只要精的，更不要去想著多元，做好我們的強項就夠了。」、「不斷檢討隨少人看新聞剔除，羅偉光跟進。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎同樣否認給予編採指示，強調只是提議新聞不需要多元，而是要「貴精不貴多」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;飯盒會指計劃向小店給予優惠&quot;&gt;「飯盒會」指計劃向小店給予優惠&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎與其秘書的通訊對話紀錄顯示，黎向秘書說他未能出席2019年12月6日的會議「飯盒午餐 - 港蘋紙廣告」，因不在香港，並託秘書要求時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹主持會議。黎確認沒有出席當日會議，也沒有以線上會議形式參與會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦呈上黎的出入境紀錄，顯示他在12月2日出境，直至12月11日才回港，換言之會議當天非身在香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack 員工群組紀錄顯示，在會議數天前，黎表示他到日本放假，未能參與會議。有銷售部的員工在會議前表達意見，指在大企業和大品牌受制中方而不會在《蘋果》刊登廣告之同時，「何不放眼一些中小企，尤其一些黃絲小店」，並提議可給予特別優惠。另一名員工亦表示：「短期主打黃絲小店，或許也是一條出路」，並指小店可能應付不到太高的廣告費，提議以優惠價錢讓小店刊登小型廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在會議同日，張劍虹在 Slack 群組發送會議重點和跟進事項，其中一點提到：「逆權運動下不少小店生意受影響，我們可以優惠給小店在報紙登廣告，半版、四分一版，一起撐一店。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》社長 張劍虹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問及「黃絲小店」的意思，黎指「黃店」是支持爭取自由運動的商店，通常是中小企。對於會議紀錄提及小店優惠，黎指按他理解，廣告費對於小店而言很貴，同事遂提議將報紙版面分成多個小格，讓小店能在《蘋果》刊登廣告，並試行數個月，看看效果如何，惟方案經過數個月試行後，最終失敗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎有否在任何「飯盒會」上，指示銷售部員工推行支持小店的計劃？黎則稱，除了上述12月6日的會議之外，他記不起還有其他場合談及支持小店計劃，但若然有會議談論過相關計劃，他會抱支持態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張劍虹作供時曾提到，黎在《飲食男女》的「飯盒會」中指示員工訪問「黃店」和小店，又指雖然計劃名稱是「撐小店」，「呢個計劃個名唔係叫撐黃店，但黎生係咁嘅意思。」辯方今問黎有否向張劍虹表示支持撐小店刊登廣告的計劃。黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;節目稱很多國家均不在乎台灣-黎否認鼓吹其他國家提升台灣關係&quot;&gt;節目稱很多國家均不在乎台灣 黎否認鼓吹其他國家提升台灣關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就2020年12月1日的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目提問。黎在該集指稱，當時剛當選美國總統的拜登所採用多邊主義方法，對於台灣是非常不利，因為除了日本、韓國和印度之外，很多國家都不在乎台灣，又指其他國家沒有很強的政治議程去提升台灣地位和台美關係，情況令人擔心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上否認鼓吹其他國家提升台灣關係，強調他只是說其他國家沒有打算幫助台灣提升國際地位，以及想確認多邊主義對於台灣是不利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指人權議題非內政而是國際議題&quot;&gt;黎指人權議題非內政而是國際議題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中續指，疫情讓大家看到，中國的衰弱不再僅限於中國內部，而是沉浸在世界各地。如果中國是衰弱、有政治問題、沒有言論自由，市民因為中央的權力而不敢發聲的話，這會影響全世界。黎指，當全世界都反對中國的時候，中國仍然對澳洲採取戰狼態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上否認藉上述言論煽動對中國的憎恨，亦否認鼓吹全世界反對中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中表示，希望拜登政府能夠將人權議題與中國貿易扣連。被問到是否鼓吹拜登政府對中國採取敵對行動，黎否認，指「人權並不是敵對行為（Human right is not hostility.）」，他只是希望拜登政府能夠幫助香港和新疆維吾爾族改善人權狀況。被問到以上是否屬中國內政，黎則認為人權議題並非內政，而是國際議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎習近平下台是唯一解決辦法&quot;&gt;黎：習近平下台是唯一解決辦法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中指，西方對中國施壓是十分重要，中國和習近平都面臨很大危機，這是改變中國的好時機，若果不向中國施壓，或至少習近平下台，「我們將會很悽慘。（We’ll be sorry.）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上被問到「西方的壓力」是指什麼，他指是政治上的壓力，又指貿易方面的壓力也很重要。他否認「壓力」的意思是敵對行動，但至少「壓力」是具批判性的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指黎在節目中兩度說「至少習近平下台」，問黎有什麼意思。黎指他希望習近平下台，因自從習上台之後，中國才開始與西方產生問題，他下台是唯一解決辦法。辯方追問，黎是否認為習下台之後，中國與西方之間的問題就可以解決到？黎則表示他希望問題獲得解決，如果習不下台的話，他想像不到問題有多難解決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述黎在節目中稱，如果習近平下台的話，可以為中共開啟自由化和融入世界的道路，形容這是世界的唯一希望。黎在庭上確認相關言論，他當時希望習近平能下台，如果他下台的話，便會開啟中國自由化道路，而中國可以融入世界。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指若不繼續抗爭-香港或變成新疆-甚至比新疆更大鑊&quot;&gt;黎指若不繼續抗爭 香港或變成新疆 「甚至比新疆更大鑊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在觀眾提問環節中，有人問黎，香港會否被同化，最終成為與中國差不多的城市。黎回答時提到：「如果我哋真係唔係繼續去抗爭，我哋唔係繼續去盡量去保持我哋香港嘅法制同埋自由，無論如何我哋點樣做都好呢，我哋最後唔係變成香港，唔係變成大陸嘅一個城市，而係變成新疆，或者甚至比新疆更大鑊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否有意藉上述言論鼓吹對中央政府的憎恨？黎否認，強調只是表達他認為香港會變成怎樣。辯方又問黎是否有意煽惑其他人使用暴力，以及不守法。黎一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問黎上述言論中的「抗爭」是什麼意思。黎表示在《國安法》之後，香港不再有大型運動，但他希望香港人能夠繼續以不同小規模的運動去抗爭，但是知道這只是一廂情願。法官李素蘭追問何謂「小規模運動」，黎則稱當時未有仔細想過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李素蘭質疑，觀眾聽到黎的言論之後，可能會從字面上理解「抗爭」是指勇武，她問黎認為觀眾會怎樣理解他的言論。黎則稱觀眾會以自己的方式理解，但是他們會認為不可能。黎又表示，當時想不到任何出路，但是愛香港的人總是會懷著希望能保護它。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官問黎打算說服觀眾做什麼。黎則稱從沒打算叫觀眾做任何事情，又稱因為《國安法》緣故，對於人們可以進行怎樣的運動沒有任何想法，上述言論只是他的「希望」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指蘋果高層均不涉製作live-chat節目和專欄成敗樂一笑&quot;&gt;黎指《蘋果》高層均不涉製作Live Chat節目和專欄「成敗樂一笑」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方總結 Live Chat 之下，黎稱6名同案被告、《蘋果》高層，包括張劍虹、陳沛敏、羅偉光、馮偉光、林文宗和楊清奇，均沒有參與製作節目，強調 Live Chat 是他自己的節目。黎又稱他一直都提醒同事不要冒險或違反法律。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於《蘋果》有否牽涉其中，黎稱除了有兩名員工協助和將影片上載至平台之外，《蘋果》便沒有涉及製作節目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 和黎的「徒弟」李兆富，黎亦指二人不涉製作節目。法官李運騰提到，黎曾供稱 Mark Simon 以往邀請及安排節目嘉賓，因此黎不能說 Mark Simon 與節目無關。黎確認 Mark Simon 替他邀請嘉賓，但否認二人之間有協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黎的個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」，黎同樣指6名同案被告、Mark Simon 和李兆富均沒有牽涉文章內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎於周二及三，一連兩日須出席上訴案件聆訊，因此本案押後至周四續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the ashes of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party has emerged triumphant, having indirectly supported a rebel offensive led by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that toppled the Syrian regime. But a seismic shift of this scale – the removal of the decades-old House of Assad – may inadvertently set in motion a series of events over which Ankara cannot exert a monopoly or even control. Setting the parameters for Turkey’s stabilisation strategy will be critical for Syria and the dynamics emerging across a rapidly shifting region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria’s fluid security situation (parts of the country are still out of HTS’s reach), uncertainty about the future of US policy on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in northeastern Syria under President-elect Donald Trump, and signs of a resurgence of so-called Islamic State mean that Turkey faces several challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey’s current approach favours centralisation and consolidation of Syrian state institutions while supporting HTS as the caretaker government, as well as facilitating its diplomatic outreach and efforts to attract foreign investment, humanitarian aid and economic links. But a month since Assad’s ouster, there are clear signs of the extent of the risks that lie ahead. In the coming period, if HTS is seen to delay the convening of the planned National Dialogue Conference to include actors from across Syria’s diverse political, ethnic, religious and sectarian spectrum, prolongs the holding of national elections, or is seen to implement a Salafi-oriented legal system without a mandate, then it will lose the goodwill of Syrians and international actors alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in a nightmare scenario where HTS fails to stem violence against Alawites or Christians and sectarian violence grows, it will clearly have failed as a governing actor. Turkey, seen as a major supporter of the jihadi turned party leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, will lose its credibility and the opportunity to capitalise on the historic geostrategic shifts underway in the region, with a weakened Iran and Russia. Instead, Ankara must balance a proactive foreign policy in Syria with a cooperative, multilateral approach to engage with foreign actors like the US and regional allies to support an inclusive Syrian-led transition. Otherwise, Ankara faces the risk of overreaching in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-sector-policy&quot;&gt;Security Sector Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In interviews with the authors, Turkish officials described the overthrow of Assad as a “paradigm shift” with wide-ranging and fast-evolving consequences, signalling the centrality that Syria holds from Turkey’s national security perspective. But they insist that Turkey is not vying to replace the dominance over Syria previously exercised by Iran, which weaponised a destabilising agenda for decades. Turkey views Syria’s political stability and security as being interlinked. Across the Turkish border, thousands of fighters aligned with various armed groups still operate within Syria. Should HTS falter in its bid to unify these disparate factions – once united against a common adversary – under a centralised defence structure, Ankara could face mounting instability along its 900-km frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Turkish defence minister, Yasar Guler, has said that Turkey is prepared to provide military training if the Syrian administration requests it. Turkey has conducted several major counterterrorism operations across its southern border since 2016 and is estimated to maintain around 10,000 troops in towns and military outposts including Afrin, Azez and Jarablus in northwestern Syria and Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad in the northeast. The real figure is likely to be much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to reports, Turkey is ready to send military advisors to support the training of the new Syrian army at military academies in Aleppo and Damascus. On 2 January, the Turkish Ministry of Defence stated that talks are underway to further military cooperation with the transitional administration. Turkey’s assistance could have a positive impact on army unification and professionalisation. But there are challenges to this process stemming from internal and external dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after the collapse of regime forces, al-Sharaa called for respect for the rule of law, instructed against seeking vigilante-style justice against former army officials, extended amnesties for conscripts, and set up a disarmament registration system in many parts of the country. On 24 December, the chiefs of some of Syria’s “revolutionary factions” agreed to be dissolved and merge under the country’s Defence Ministry. While the bloodless capture of Damascus bodes well for the prospect of a successful transition, any consensus among former rival factions may prove fragile as actors tussle for financial resources, rank and political status. For example, two of the largest Druze armed groups in Sweida announced they would join a new national army as long as their rights were guaranteed and the army was not run according to factional or sectarian rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HTS-led General Command’s decision to promote certain militant group leaders, including Khalid Khattab, head of the hardline militia Ansar al-Tawhid, to senior army posts alongside foreign fighters and HTS commanders illustrates the competing pressures that al-Sharaa and his allies face in integrating armed groups into a unified structure. The vast majority of the 49 men promoted are HTS field commanders and members of jihadi groups who lack formal military training and credentials. The decision to award titles to foreign fighters (including Uighurs, a Tajik national, a Jordanian, a Turk, an Egyptian and an Albanian) has drawn strident criticism. But al-Sharaa’s immediate task is to unify a patchwork of disparate armed groups, and these steps may be read as alliance-building and seeking to deter them from splintering or acting unilaterally against his nascent authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, Turkey has ramped up its security-related cooperation with several African states, including military training and the opening of training facilities, such as in Libya and Somalia. Such engagement offers a blueprint for how Ankara plans to approach the Syrian case. But state-to-state military training presents a different set of challenges to militia demobilisation and integration, which can be constrained by intra-group rivalries motivated by identity-driven or profit-seeking behaviour. Where some armed factions have a vested interest in retaining control over smaller units or wish to “own” command over tribal or sectarian loyalties that sit outside of formal structures, the process can be slow and arduous. Without an appropriate balance of incentives-to-payoffs, Salafi-jihadi groups that see themselves losing profitable economic and political influence could undermine centralisation and reform strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enormity of the task should not be underestimated. Deteriorating domestic security, including sectarian or intra-militia violence, will mean that the task of security provision falls on loosely organised rebel groups with varying stockpiles, training and levels of cohesion. A further complication is that, according to Turkish sources, there may be approximately 8,000 foreign fighters in Syria, including Russians, Dagestanis, Chechens, Uzbeks and Tajiks (excluding Islamic State). It remains unclear what will happen to pro-regime Lebanese, Iranian and Iraqi fighters who were naturalised under Assad. Implementing a policy that addresses these risks will require planning, but with the security landscape fractured and not enough personnel in HTS’s ranks to secure the whole country, this will be a complex, incremental process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the scale of the latent threat posed by loyalists from the former army officers’ corps and pro-regime paramilitary militia is unclear. According to our sources, over 32,000 former army personnel are believed to have handed in their weapons since HTS set up registration and reconciliation centres. But hundreds of officers and thousands of loyalists are believed to remain underground, and some are in hiding in Libya, the UAE and Iraq. Despite this, it is unlikely that the old nationalist guard could leverage a coordinated threat in the short term; instead, some may seek eventual reintegration, while others could mobilise to exploit vulnerabilities within the new security apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these high-risk and volatile dynamics, Turkey should avoid taking on unilateral responsibility and instead deploy advice and training to build the capacity of HTS-led Syrian forces to meet challenges directly. A number of recent reports connecting some fighters with HTS links to acts of extrajudicial or revenge killings against former Assad loyalists, as well as allegations of violence against minority groups, have undermined confidence in HTS. While many reports are false or unverified, it will be important for al-Sharaa to demonstrate effective leadership as well as tactical and operational command over the HTS rank and file. In order for Turkey’s security sector reform role to be effective, there is still much heavy lifting to be done to clarify the parameters and means of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-will-confront-a-resurging-islamic-state-threat&quot;&gt;Who Will Confront a Resurging Islamic State Threat?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An uptick in Islamic State mobilisation in the past year and concurrent propaganda techniques indicate that the group seeks to exploit the fall of the Assad regime and the regional shifts triggered by Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. There are genuine concerns that Islamic State cells will try to exploit a political crisis and security vacuum at the centre of the Syrian state to expand its areas of operation. Last year, US Central Command estimated the number of Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq to be about 2,500. Around 9,000 Islamic State detainees remain in over 20 detention facilities in northeastern and eastern Syria, guarded by the US-backed SDF, with a further 40,000 family members of Islamic State fighters held in camps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to sources familiar with Turkey’s military engagement in Syria, Turkey views Islamic State through two lenses simultaneously. One is the threat of the “ghost of Daesh”, which is seen as a way for the SDF to justify continued military training, arms and funding provided by the US and to maintain a territorial foothold. The second lens recognises and is prepared to counter the growing terrorist threat posed by Islamic State activity in Syria amid a risk of a security vacuum, and positions Turkey as playing a key counterterrorism role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 22 December, in a joint press briefing with al-Sharaa, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the Syrian government was prepared to take control of Islamic State prisoners and the camps. This has raised some concerns among Western policymakers. al-Sharaa (then using his nom de guerre, Abu Muhammad al-Jolani) fought in the post-2003 Iraqi insurgency as a member of the Islamic State of Iraq. Some of the fighters under the HTS tent, particularly foreign fighters, adhere to more radical Salafi or sectarian jihadi views, raising questions about their commitment to countering Islamic State extremism. However, HTS has fought against Islamic State for a number of years, and since HTS parted with al-Qa’ida in 2016, it has taken steps to increase its visibility as a legitimacy-seeking group that has denounced transnational jihad. The nature of warfare evolved from insurgent fighting in 2014 to a type of counterterrorism approach against Islamic State cells in HTS-controlled territory in northwestern Idlib from 2017, a process that accelerated after the March 2020 ceasefire between Russia and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An agreement that sees an HTS-centred, unified Syrian armed force assume greater responsibility over Islamic State detention centres may dampen some of the tension between the US and Turkey, two NATO allies. Additionally, once HTS is able to establish a fair and functioning judiciary, the Syrian legal system must be able to prosecute former Islamic State fighters according to national legislation. Admittedly, this will be a lengthy process, but the mission to degrade and defeat Islamic State can be more effective with a well-resourced and trained national Syrian partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dispute-over-the-sdf-in-northeastern-syria&quot;&gt;The Dispute over the SDF in Northeastern Syria&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US support for the SDF, which is led primarily by the Kurdish People’s Defense Units (YPG), a group that Ankara sees as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) – an organisation designated as terrorist by the US, UK and EU – is predicated on the SDF’s role in combatting Islamic State. Since the fall of the regime, northern Syria has witnessed clashes between the Syrian National Army (SNA) – a coalition of Turkish-backed militias – and the SDF as competition has intensified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a significant divergence in how Washington and Ankara view the SDF, and lasting stability in Syria is not a viable prospect unless questions around the status of the Kurdish militia are resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey’s recent efforts to tentatively relaunch a process to resolve the country’s protracted conflict with the PKK, which has waged war on Turkey for 40 years, are motivated by the dynamic situation in Syria, and the possibility that the SDF may consolidate territorial control with Washington’s sponsorship ahead of a likely US troop withdrawal under Trump. Turkey is likely making long-term assessments about shifting dynamics in the Middle East that could favour Kurdish secessionist claims, such as recent overtures by some Israeli government officials in support of Kurdish autonomy in Syria against the backdrop of a severe breakdown in Turkey–Israel relations. Iran poses a dual threat, with the prospect of either a weakening of the regime in Tehran – which could revive Kurdish ambitions inside Iran – or alternatively, Iranian stoking of YPG–PKK armed violence to undermine Turkish interests in Syria and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of the SDF, including its political status and militia demobilisation, will strain US–Turkey talks on Syria as Trump returns to the White House. Although Trump has previously stated that he wants US troops to withdraw, the fluid security environment, coupled with the deadly Islamic State-linked terror attack in New Orleans on 1 January, suggests that this will be met with resistance by the Pentagon, which recently announced that about 2,000 US special forces are currently stationed in Syria, up from the 900 previously disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite an initial meeting between al-Sharaa and the SDF leadership in late December, the SDF has not formally agreed to terms to integrate into a national army. While other groups – including the Turkmen Brigades and some elements of the Turkey-backed SNA – have expressed reservations, it appears that all of them have agreed in principle to the process of centralisation. Recent weeks have seen sporadic Arab tribes in parts of Raqqa, Deir ez-Zour and Hasakah staging protests against YPG-led forces, adding strain to the already embattled Kurdish-run administration in Arab-majority areas. These pressures underscore the growing need for a political settlement to address the fragmented control of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The merger of Syria’s expansive patchwork of militia into a unified army will contribute to Syria’s counterterrorism role against Islamic State. There are three reasons for this. First, a state-to-state security cooperation framework is better suited to neutralising the growing threat posed by Islamic State, while strengthening Syrian central military capabilities and increasing security at the national level. Second, de-radicalisation of former Islamic State fighters at the scale required – thousands of fighters and a secondary network of potential recruits – can be implemented through the deployment of state-level resources and capability. Third, relying on the SDF as the main line of defence against the resurgence of Islamic State may prove insufficient as the group pivots in the coming months to matters concerning its internal organisation, status and integration within the emerging Syrian state apparatus, both politically and militarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong mechanisms for training and coordination to oversee the handover of Islamic State detainees to a Syrian central authority should be agreed between the US and Turkey and implemented directly – with oversight if required – by the newly constituted national Syrian army. In the coming months, it will become clearer what role Syrian Kurds may play in this arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that Washington and Ankara share strategic interests in Syria. The rapid dismantling of Iranian influence over Syria is a win that both sides will seek to maintain. The US and Turkey stand to benefit from a stable Syrian state with functioning institutions, and Ankara’s influence over Syria’s de facto rulers could act as a moderating force as HTS shifts from an armed jihadi movement to a political party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;charting-the-path-ahead&quot;&gt;Charting the Path Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-authoritarian transitions are inherently fragile. In the absence of a transitional process that has broad-based support and representation from across Syria’s constituent groups, the country risks slipping into renewed violence, a neo-authoritarian style of rule, or state failure. The track record of post-Arab Spring democratic transitions in the Middle East and North Africa is not encouraging. Neighbouring states can help mitigate these risks by playing a constructive role and supporting authorised national-level actors and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fall of Assad, it is too soon to describe the country as being in a post-conflict phase. Ankara must strike a balancing act in its approach to Syria. If it is seen to be meddling in domestic affairs or positioning for an indefinite military presence, this may have negative consequences for its stabilising role. Instead, Turkey can use this opportunity to help regional states, such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia, to become meaningfully involved to alleviate the pressure on Ankara while encouraging burden-sharing in the rehabilitation of Syria’s economy and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

Taiwan’s inputs in the semiconductor supply chain have enabled U.S. companies to maximize their productive efficiency.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;As the next administration considers how to manage the United States’ relationship with the island nation, officials will need to remember that the partnership has been, and will remain, a feature of supporting U.S. national security. Sound U.S. economic security policy should aim to balance taking advantage of Taiwanese investment to onshore critical and emerging technology (CET) capabilities, while ensuring the island can secure its own domestic ecosystem and make investments in other countries with comparative advantages the United States does not possess.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions about how best to support U.S. economic growth and security via engagement with partners and allies are set to dominate the foreign policy conversation in the coming months. Taiwan will be a central focus of this conversation given China’s continued claims to the island and its importance to supply chains for critical and emerging technologies (CETs), particularly semiconductors. Campaign trail commentary on the U.S.-Taiwan relationship varied widely. On the left, the 2024 Democratic Party platform included a call to “remain steadfast in America’s commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait consistent with the U.S. One China policy—guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances.” On the right, former president Donald Trump recently questioned the high price tag of military support for Taiwan and the island’s commitment to U.S. economic security goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taiwan engagement strategies of a second Trump administration have not been fully articulated and will likely continue to evolve. Within that context, this brief from the CSIS Economics Program and Scholl Chair in International Business assesses Taiwan’s importance to U.S. economic growth and security, particularly its role in supporting U.S. CET industries. The authors conclude that Taiwan’s commercial ecosystem is inextricably embedded in a web of globalized supply chains and industries fundamental to U.S. economic stability and prosperity—from consumer electronics to automotives to key military and dual-use applications, including artificial intelligence (AI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the center of this web of supply chains sits Taiwan’s domestic semiconductor industry, a linchpin of the global electronics ecosystem and a key source of manufacturing capacity and innovation that is important to U.S. businesses and consumers alike. Taiwan’s role in semiconductor manufacturing supports U.S. economic growth and leadership in CETs, making the island an indispensable partner in the global trade landscape. Conversations about future U.S. engagement with Taiwan must consider the interdependence between the two leading technology ecosystems and the mutual benefits of a continued robust U.S.-Taiwan trade relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us-taiwan-semiconductor-relationship&quot;&gt;The U.S.-Taiwan Semiconductor Relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply chains for semiconductor fabrication and distribution are among the most complex, specialized, and globalized in the world. Producing the chips that power the world’s devices involves a wide range of technological and commercial capabilities ranging from multi-billion-dollar clean rooms in advanced manufacturing facilities (fabs) to world-leading software development in Silicon Valley. After manufacture, semiconductors flow into every electronic system on the globe, touching almost all the world’s supply chains—including smartphones, computers, data centers, automotives, telecommunications infrastructure, manufacturing equipment, aircraft, and munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of several critical U.S. industries and national champions is linked to Taiwan’s success in CETs. Taiwan’s semiconductor industry began with the 1976 transfer of chip manufacturing technology by Radio Corporation of America (RCA) to Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), a Taiwanese government-backed organization that eventually birthed the key chip companies Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC). While the growth of the Taiwanese chip industry relied, in part, on U.S. companies and innovation, this dependency would go both ways. When U.S. chip designers struggled to access domestic semiconductor fabrication capacity in the 1990s, TSMC helped fill the gap by pioneering the “pure-play foundry” model, exclusively offering contract manufacturing for other companies’ designs. U.S. firms leveraged TSMC’s growing fabrication capacity and expertise to develop U.S. leaders in “fabless” chip design (e.g., Nvidia) and in consumer electronics like smartphones (e.g., Apple). In other words, the two economies have been closely linked, growing in tandem for over 30 years, and Taiwan has been a key contributor to U.S. technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As U.S. companies and customers increasingly benefited from Taiwanese chipmakers’ growth, local industrial “clusters” of Taiwanese chip companies sprang up across the supply chain, including in sectors like packaging, design, materials, and electronics manufacturing services—a shift that would deepen the U.S.-Taiwan semiconductor relationship. The most notable of these clusters was Hsinchu Science Park, a midsized industrial park south of Taipei that today is home to $363 billion in semiconductor revenues by firm headquarters. Beginning in the late 1970s and taking off in the 1990s, Hsinchu attracted a growing ecosystem of semiconductor companies and expertise, facilitated by both government incentives and the symbiotic benefits of colocating chip manufacturers alongside companies offering inputs, tools, and services. Key benefits of this industrial cluster model include reduced fab downtime due to the proximity of spare parts and servicing personnel, reduced transportation and labor costs, and a concentrated pool of semiconductor industry talent able to shift fluidly between leading companies—reinforcing Taiwan’s centrality as a hub for innovation in global semiconductor supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwanese companies have been critical to the development of U.S. semiconductor capabilities. For instance, part of TSMC’s success has been its partnership with Apple since 2014, in addition to its commercial deployment of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography before Intel and Samsung. TMSC has also supported the United States’ advancements in AI: investments in AI data center infrastructure have boosted demand for Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), for which TSMC is by far the leading manufacturer. Although Intel and Samsung are investing extensively to catch up, TSMC will likely lead advanced fabrication in the near to medium term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While TSMC is the most important Taiwanese chipmaker, the island is home to other domestic companies producing legacy (older-generation) logic chips as well as memory chips, which allow electronic devices to store information. Most notable is UMC, the world’s third-largest foundry and a key producer of legacy chips for automotive, industrial, and communications applications. Taiwan-based Nanya Technology Corporation (NTC), Winbond Electronics Corporation (WEC), and Macronix International are among the top 10 manufacturers of memory in the world. As with advanced logic chips, the Taiwanese market share in legacy and memory chips is expected to remain strong in the next decade, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. In addition to fabrication, Taiwan is a global leader in semiconductor packaging and testing (and chip design, as well as an important player in areas like the production of wafer substrates, the base materials for chips. Key Taiwanese firms include ASE Group, a leading provider of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) services; MediaTek, a smartphone chipset designer; and materials suppliers such as Unimicron and Nan Ya Printed Circuit Board Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Taiwanese semiconductor ecosystem has supported U.S. firms across the semiconductor supply chain—many of which have benefited from their operations in Taiwan, including chipmakers such as Micron, semiconductor packaging facilities for OSATs like Amkor, and capital equipment manufacturers such as Applied Materials. It has enabled U.S. firms to dominate several parts of the semiconductor supply chain, including design as well as production and licensing of core IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;production-of-key-us-items&quot;&gt;Production of Key U.S. Items&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In turn, this economic relationship has supported U.S. dominance over the production of multiple critical technologies. One of these key items is perhaps the most influential piece of modern consumer technology—the iPhone. While much of the technology’s value is derived from U.S. inputs, the item still relies on third-country firms to come together—including Taiwan. The design of new iPhones starts at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California. Apple develops some of its own chips and processors, which allows the company to integrate cutting-edge technologies like AI and machine learning into its devices, facilitating features such as facial recognition and augmented reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Apple depends on third-party suppliers to bring its products to life as these companies excel in their areas of expertise, particularly with integrated circuits (ICs) for sound enhancement and connectivity, which surpass Apple’s capabilities. Additionally, relying on third-party manufacturers can be more cost-effective; instead of investing in hiring designers and building the necessary infrastructure, Apple finds it more effective to source these components externally. Some of these third-party partners include other U.S. firms such as Qualcomm, which supplies multiple electronic components to Apple, including envelope power trackers, baseband processors, power management modules, and GSM/CDMA receivers and transceivers. Other third-party companies are abroad: Sony produces camera and electronic components for Apple, and Infineon makes the phone network components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chip in an iPhone also requires input from multiple companies. For the A12 chip, the initial design is done by Apple itself, in the United States. For chip production, Apple partners with foundries like TSMC, whose semiconductor technology Apple cannot replicate in its own facilities. Packaging and final testing will be done by another firm in yet another country—such as Amkor in, for instance, the Philippines. The A12 will then be assembled into the iPhone itself by Foxconn in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beyond-semiconductors-taiwans-importance-to-other-supply-chains&quot;&gt;Beyond Semiconductors: Taiwan’s Importance to Other Supply Chains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of chips, Taiwan plays a key role in several economically important supply chains. Taiwan is home to significant manufacturing capacity for U.S. clothing retailers such as Adidas and Nike, leading bicycle brands like Giant and Merida, and more niche consumer goods such as bubble tea. The Taiwanese government actively encourages foreign direct investment (FDI) through policies that keep the economy attractive to international investors. In 2021, Taiwan attracted $5.4 billion in inbound FDI, down from $9.6 billion five years prior—a 43 percent decrease—while real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6.2 percent. While the durability of this trend is uncertain as U.S. commercial concerns about Taiwan’s national security rise, the island is as economically integrated with the United States and its supply chains as it has been at any point in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwans-value-to-the-us-and-global-economy&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Value to the U.S. and Global Economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic value of Taiwan to global supply chains for semiconductors and other CETs is immense. By one estimate, Taiwan fabricates nearly a third of the globe’s computing capacity each year, and U.S. companies and consumers are among the leading beneficiaries of direct and indirect trade with Taiwan’s chip sector. As mentioned, Taiwanese semiconductor companies underpinned the growth of the U.S. digital economy. This applies not only to U.S. fabless chip designers but also to U.S. companies relying on data centers, networking equipment, and other digital infrastructure, as well as any electronic systems or inputs—a vast landscape that includes e-commerce and social media giants, telecommunications companies, automakers and other manufacturers, and the entire U.S. software-as-a-service (SaaS) ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Taiwan’s chip industry is inextricably linked to the health of U.S. industries as wide ranging as smartphones, computers, automotives, 5G, and medical equipment. This interdependency means that trade with Taiwanese semiconductor companies provides significant, hard-to-quantify knock-on benefits for the U.S. economy. According to an August 2024 report by the Congressional Research Service, Taiwan is the eighth-largest source of U.S. imports ($44 billion) and the tenth-largest U.S. export market ($40 billion), and Taiwanese exports to the United States grew 100 percent from 2018 to 2022. Direct trade statistics also underestimate interdependence: a 2022 estimate of Taiwanese supply chain relationships also showed that “23,100 U.S. companies buy directly from Taiwanese suppliers at tier-1, while more than 112,500 buy indirectly at tier-2, and over 237,500 at tier-3.” Investment also closely links the United States and Taiwan. In 2023, U.S. direct investment stock in Taiwan was $19.3 billion, while Taiwan’s direct investment stock in the United States was $15.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwans-role-in-us-economic-security-efforts&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Role in U.S. Economic Security Efforts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;industrial-policy-partner&quot;&gt;Industrial Policy Partner&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s centrality to CET supply chains makes it a capable prospective partner in U.S. efforts to enhance economic security and growth, particularly for chips and related industries such as AI. Taiwanese companies, particularly TSMC, have been willing contributors to U.S. and allied semiconductor reshoring efforts. Despite facing domestic political pushback against its overseas expansion plans, TSMC is committing more than $65 billion of its capital to U.S. expansion, incentivized by $6.6 billion in U.S. CHIPS and Science Act funding. The foundry plans to build six U.S. fabs over the next three years, including facilities with close-to-leading-edge manufacturing processes at the 4-, 3-, and 2-nanometer (nm) levels. Outside the United States, TSMC is investing in fabs in Germany and Japan in concert with those countries’ industrial policy efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This increasing geographic diversification, in part, reflects the demands of TSMC’s U.S.-focused customer base and its high degree of foreign ownership, which have created incentives—or, more aptly, pressure, alongside generous foreign government subsidies—to reduce TSMC’s asset concentration in Taiwan. Challenges such as lower access to labor and higher production costs are delaying the opening of fabs in the United States. However, assuming local markets can overcome labor challenges and that TSMC continues to bear the brunt of heightened U.S. manufacturing costs, the foundry is set to play a key role in supporting the expansion of U.S. chip manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;limits-to-the-us-push-for-indigenization&quot;&gt;Limits to the U.S. Push for Indigenization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these reshoring efforts, Taiwan’s domestic semiconductor industry will remain a key economic asset for U.S. commercial and government interests. This is primarily due to the limitations on shifting semiconductor manufacturing assets off the island in the near term—particularly TSMC’s most advanced chipmaking capabilities. Some of these limits are self-imposed, at least in part. For instance, Taipei has pressured TSMC to keep most of its advanced manufacturing nodes on the island, given its perceived importance in enabling Taiwan’s “silicon shield,” protecting against China’s attempts at “reunification.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are obstacles to moving chip production away from Taiwan altogether. Taiwan’s unparalleled concentration of personnel, expertise, infrastructure, and capital equipment makes the island indispensable to U.S. technological capabilities. Moreover, structural barriers such as higher capital costs and regulatory burdens in the United States make full-scale reshoring unfeasible. Even if the capital and regulatory constraints were mitigated, the sheer scale of Taiwan’s physical and human capital and the challenges of recreating a highly complex manufacturing process discourage moving chipmaking outside Taiwan. In other words, while countries may emulate aspects of Taiwan’s competitiveness in the semiconductor sector, the island will remain critical to global chip supply chains. There is also a broader electronics supply chain to consider: Taiwan’s position in the Indo-Pacific locates it near key hubs for electronics manufacturing, which Asia still dominates. Sound U.S. economic security policy should therefore aim to balance taking advantage of Taiwanese investment to expand CET capabilities at home while ensuring the island can secure its domestic ecosystem and make investments in other regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Taiwanese companies are already contributing to third-country chip ecosystems. TSMC has been setting up operations around the globe. The company’s investment in Germany has concentrated on establishing a “specialty technology fab.” Additionally, TSMC’s majority-owned subsidiary Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM) has revealed plans to develop 6 nm and 7 nm process technologies for applications in automotive, industrial, and high-performance computing sectors. However, JASM will also maintain production of mature node process technologies up to 40 nm. Aside from advanced fabrication, Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (PSMC) has launched a joint venture with Tata Group to support India’s first commercial fabrication plant. The effort supports the Indian government’s strategy of encouraging production of mature nodes of more than 40 nm where it has identified more potential for growth. In short, Taiwan has undertaken significant projects propping up other nations’ advanced technology production, which would ultimately help the U.S. goal of reducing global dependence on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan sits at the epicenter of economic security considerations. Its contributions to global technology supply chains are unparalleled, and it has been a critical enabler of U.S. growth in the CET space. For the past three decades, the U.S.-Taiwan economic partnership has driven leaps forward in advanced technologies that have unlocked significant growth opportunities. However, the unique role of Taiwan—nicknamed Silicon Island—in current geopolitical tensions and potential future conflicts makes it a key point of vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversifying away from that vulnerability altogether is not feasible. Taiwan’s skilled know-how and production capabilities in the semiconductor supply chain, especially with respect to advanced fabrication, are not replicable at scale anywhere else. Likewise, where diversification is possible, the United States should not aim to reshore production of all relevant inputs. The current U.S. domestic landscape has disadvantages—namely acute labor shortages and greater capital costs—that cannot be fully addressed in the short term. Allied nations such as Germany, India, and Japan have comparative advantages that should be utilized. Policymakers therefore must walk the line between propping up Taiwan’s production and defensive capabilities, encouraging its growing participation in the U.S. tech ecosystem, and supporting its investments in third nations given current gaps in the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adopting this three-pronged approach to Taiwan’s technology sector is ultimately the best way to assure U.S. economic security and should be seen as a model to approach friendshoring altogether. Balancing these three features—supporting partners’ critical sectors to mitigate their vulnerabilities, ensuring the U.S. tech ecosystem is prepared for investments, and supporting inevitable expansions into third countries that offer advantages the United States does not possess—is preferable to the current U.S. approach prioritizing reshoring to the detriment of partners’ interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 15 November 2024, RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security and the Center for Financial Integrity (CFI) launched a Taskforce on Public–Private Partnership in Fighting Financial Crime in Ukraine. An in-person meeting in Warsaw, held on a non-attributable basis, convened 40 representatives, including those from the public and private sectors in Ukraine, and international experts. The discussion included two sessions focused on the current state of public–private partnerships (PPPs) in Ukraine and on international experience and recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report summarises the main findings of each of these sessions. None of the discussions at the meeting are attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All participants agreed that PPPs play an important role in the evolving landscape of anti-money-laundering (AML) and counterterrorist-financing (CTF) efforts. Private sector entities often provide valuable insights, data and technologies that can contribute to identifying suspicious transactions and activities. By sharing this information and collaborating with public authorities, such as financial intelligence units (FIUs), the detection and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing can be significantly improved. Moreover, such cooperation helps to build a robust risk assessment framework and address emerging threats promptly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ukraine continues to implement EU accession reforms and prepare for the next round of evaluation by the Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL), a PPP can play a valuable role in improving the effectiveness of the country’s AML/CTF system. To understand what is already happening in this field in Ukraine, the workshop participants from Ukraine focused on evaluating the current interaction between the public sector and private financial institutions (FIs) in combating financial crime, and the key challenges and barriers that hinder more effective detection and prevention. International experts then shared the lessons that Ukraine can learn from the establishment of PPPs in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-current-state-of-ppps-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Current State of PPPs in Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;public-sector-perspective&quot;&gt;Public Sector Perspective&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPPs are traditionally led by a country’s FIU. In Ukraine, the State Financial Monitoring Service of Ukraine (SFMS) fulfills the role of the FIU. Within the SFMS, a dedicated coordination department is responsible for conducting national risk assessments and developing methodologies to target high-risk areas effectively. Additionally, the SFMS employs a sectoral approach to risk assessment and offers analytical support to strengthen AML efforts across various sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the SFMS operates the Electronic Cabinet of the Financial Monitoring System (e-Cabinet), which allows primary financial monitoring entities (those that are regulated for AML purposes) to submit information efficiently. To enhance collaboration, the SFMS plans to introduce a feedback mechanism for each submitted suspicious transaction report (STR). The SFMS representative at the workshop emphasised the body’s readiness to implement this system and highlighted that banks and other private sector entities are prepared to participate in this initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine’s Order No. 322, which governs the Procedure for the Exchange of Information on Financial Monitoring and provides for the e-Cabinet, has not yet entered into force and cannot do so until martial law is lifted. As a result, the SFMS is advocating for amendments to the current regulations to ensure stakeholder access to the system, streamline error resolution in the e-Cabinet’s operations, and maintain its effective functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To update all the participants in the financial monitoring system, SFMS’s experts have also developed a comprehensive methodological digest for the private sector, prosecutorial entities and other relevant stakeholders. The digest features insights from international organisations and select jurisdictions, including reports on fraud, strategic intelligence assessments, payment networks and other topics. It also highlights best practices in AML from leading global examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two representatives from Ukraine’s public sector also emphasised the issue of preventing corruption as one of the critical issues that should be considered by PPPs, highlighting corruption within the private as well as the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from Ukraine’s National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) highlighted that the institution reviews over 700,000 declarations from public officials per year. They noted the successful collaboration with the SFMS, showcasing an effective model of public-to-public cooperation. The NACP is also open to strengthening ties with the private sector to enhance anti-corruption efforts. However, one workshop participant noted that while public officials are required to declare all their assets, examining their lifestyle often provides the most accurate insights into their true income and potential discrepancies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public sector participants highlighted the following ideas to be taken into account to advance PPP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An ideal scenario would involve implementing a system at the blockchain level, capable of responding to each piece of information, allowing for the tracking of STRs. This would provide a clear view of the outcomes of related investigations and prosecutions, making it possible to assess their impact on the broader financial monitoring framework.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The role of the Academy of Financial Monitoring is noteworthy as a centre for training and awareness-raising across the regime. This institutional structure has evolved into a robust platform for uniting various stakeholders. Currently, efforts are underway to develop a programme that will engage all participants actively. However, the success of these initiatives depends heavily on the active involvement of the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another significant step is the creation of an AML Hub within the Academy of Financial Monitoring, which is currently under development. This will serve as a central resource for training, knowledge sharing and collaboration, further strengthening Ukraine’s financial crime prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant emphasised the need for the state to develop a comprehensive strategy and programme specifically focused on fostering PPPs in AML. They noted that some parts of the private sector currently lack sufficient motivation to proactively identify suspicious transactions. For a PPP to function successfully, collaboration with government agencies must be promoted and valued at the national level. Strong state-level support and endorsement are essential. With such backing, the private sector’s engagement would be significantly enhanced, leading to substantial positive outcomes, including increased efficiency and potential revenue gains reflected in the national budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum up, the representatives of the public sector expressed their support, including for existing public–private engagement in Ukraine, but also highlighted legislative obstacles or other barriers to its effective implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-concerns-and-perspectives&quot;&gt;Private Sector Concerns and Perspectives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has underscored the critical role of new technologies in not only defending the nation on the battlefield but also combating financial crime more effectively. The use of new technologies in the AML field requires strong collaboration between public sector and fintech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To facilitate this, the Ukrainian Association of Fintech and Innovation Companies, in partnership with City UK, is establishing the Digital Finance Ukraine Hub. This initiative aims to unite representatives from the public and private sectors, as well as law enforcement agencies (LEAs), to enhance cooperation and information sharing. The core objective of the hub is to create a dynamic platform where the fintech industry can engage directly with government institutions, fostering a more transparent and efficient dialogue to address emerging challenges in the financial sector. Importantly, this platform will also engage law enforcement officials to advance prosecution and investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to FIs, and in particular banks, the focus on combating financial crime in Ukraine has grown substantially over the past decade, with banks playing an increasingly active role. A workshop participant noted that financial intelligence capabilities within banks have expanded and banks now identify a large volume of suspicious activities. In 2023, 1,423,311 transactions were submitted by banks, highlighting the need for effective tools to monitor and manage these cases efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks seek to implement a system that can accurately detect suspicious customers while minimising disruptions for legitimate businesses. This need arises because clients often express frustration over excessively stringent financial monitoring. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve a balanced approach: one that ensures rigorous oversight without imposing undue burdens on compliant businesses. This balance requires significant resources and investment. Nevertheless, banks recognise the critical importance of detecting and preventing financial crime, and they are committed to enhancing their efforts in this area and recognise that PPP working could help address this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another representative of an international bank operating in Ukraine noted that the banking sector is actually the most prepared for PPPs. In particular, there is a framework already in place covering communication between the banks and the SFMS and LEAs. Banks also have their own associations that provide good practices for the market and aim to form proposals for the regulator to initiate changes. The representative stressed the importance of establishing a robust platform for information exchange among all market participants. Equally crucial is creating an effective feedback loop from government agencies, particularly during the early stages of identifying risk. Timely feedback would enable banks to respond swiftly and accurately to emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several participants admitted that one of the key challenges in this area is the availability of modern technologies capable of facilitating effective collaboration and information sharing. Often, such technological solutions are developed by start-ups, making it difficult for banks to assess their long-term reliability and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, currently there is no platform where stakeholders can exchange signals or share real-time information in a structured manner. Government agencies lack the flexibility and technological infrastructure to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of financial crime, which itself is increasingly driven by advanced technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant noted that the recent Web Summit in Lisbon showcased numerous technological innovations, including AI-driven solutions, which the public sector currently lacks. This highlights the growing technological divide between the state and other market participants. Consequently, banks must adapt to new IT solutions and develop trust in emerging technologies. One potential model for building this trust is the use of regulatory sandboxes, where new technologies can be tested in a controlled environment before widespread adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, FIs would greatly benefit from strengthened partnerships with the public sector. Such collaboration would allow the identification and development of technological solutions to share information via the implementation of IT- and AI-driven approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-monitoring-culture&quot;&gt;Financial Monitoring Culture&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that a PPP does not replace legal financial monitoring obligations. However, participants emphasised that culture is important to both PPP and financial monitoring compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative highlighted that while there is extensive regulation of financial monitoring within the banking sector in Ukraine, there is significantly less oversight for professional advisers. For instance, although parts of the legal sector are required to report suspicious activities, the level of regulation imposed on them is minimal compared with that placed on banks. Additionally, tax advisers are not required to possess any formal qualifications. As noted by the same participant, it is often professional advisers who facilitate financial crime. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance regulatory measures and ensure the effectiveness and understanding of the financial monitoring culture in this area, and not merely to rely on banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative from one of the professional associations also emphasised the importance of cultivating a financial monitoring culture in wider society. It is essential that every client understands that when they approach a bank or an FI, they must undergo the appropriate monitoring procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, fostering a strong culture of financial monitoring is crucial, and this shift must gain momentum across all sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;common-threats-and-challenges&quot;&gt;Common Threats and Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the discussions, representatives from both public and private sectors in Ukraine agreed that there are a number of threats and challenges to the effective financial crime response in Ukraine that could be addressed through PPP working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Almost unanimously, representatives from Ukraine emphasised the issue of virtual assets (VAs) (cryptocurrency), including their use in corruption and serious organised crime. It was also highlighted that at the beginning of the war, there were numerous reports in the media about collaborators being paid in cryptocurrency. LEAs lack the necessary expertise in certain aspects of VAs. This issue is compounded by a shortage of financial resources, which prevents them from hiring experts who could provide the necessary training. Participants agreed that cryptocurrency is a classic example where a PPP might be needed in Ukraine and would help to address the related financial crime challenges more effectively. Considering the intersection of corruption and cryptocurrency, many participants acknowledged that cryptocurrency is increasingly being exploited as a tool for corrupt activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of human resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Among the problematic aspects mentioned for the SFMS and other public sector stakeholders was the lack of human resources. For example, 50% of the SFMS staff has been drafted into the military. Developing a PPP would facilitate collaboration at a time of reduced human resource capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Law enforcement sector:&lt;/strong&gt; Another problem area raised is the effectiveness of the law enforcement system. A participant highlighted that almost all law enforcement work touches on financial crimes, but there should be a more systematic approach to this, which might be facilitated by the establishment of a PPP.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exchange of information:&lt;/strong&gt; A significant issue raised by a private sector representative was the fragmentation of information exchange. Government agencies currently manage vast amounts of data, but these databases are often not interconnected. This lack of integration hinders effective cooperation between agencies and with the private sector. A more cohesive and regulated approach to information exchange is essential, and the business community should also play an active role in facilitating this process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;international-experience-and-recommendations&quot;&gt;International Experience and Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop then discussed examples of international experience and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-trust&quot;&gt;Building Trust&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of trust is fundamental to many countries that have successfully developed PPPs. People are the cornerstone of successful PPPs, which often rely on the experiences and relationships of individuals who transition from the public to the private sector, leveraging the trust they have built with former colleagues. This personal trust and professional continuity have laid the foundation for many effective PPPs worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resources&quot;&gt;Resources&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Future of Financial Intelligence Sharing (FFIS) programme leads independent research into the role of public–private and private–private sector financial information-sharing partnerships to detect, prevent and disrupt crime. It has produced a number of research papers and peer learning exercises on the subject of PPPs that participants were encouraged to review. These research papers are published on the FFIS website and provide a resource for Ukraine to develop its understanding of the key issues in establishing a PPP and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the key learning points from the FFIS programme are that PPP activity has the potential to deliver preventive outcomes, which can be more efficient than criminal justice outcomes. The work has also found that PPPs can in themselves help develop trust across the AML/CTF system, improving the quality of STRs. From the perspective of Ukraine’s experience, an effective financial crime system, including activity such as PPPs, can provide greater confidence in an economy, supporting growth and investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also noted by one representative that Europol is soon to publish a paper, based on a survey exercise, in partnership with FFIS, to understand use cases and scenarios that have been applied across EU member state LEAs. This paper, built on a 2022 European Commission staff working document, will provide further examples of learning points and successful PPP activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lessons-from-other-countries&quot;&gt;Lessons from Other Countries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of lessons that Ukraine could learn from the experience of other countries were provided by international experts, including that to develop a PPP will often require legal innovation. PPPs are best progressed by willing participants, considering the potential of the existing legislative framework and what can be done within this, rather than through an approach that seeks to identify legal impediments. A “dare to share” culture is valuable, although this does require confidence that regulators are supportive of the overall approach. In one jurisdiction, it had been necessary to change the law to enable sharing, although this was to enable private–private sharing in particular. One Ukrainian participant expressed the view that a law should be created to enable public–private information sharing, and that this should be drafted as plainly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in the workshop discussed the value of selecting the right topic on which to develop sharing. This involves identifying a subject that is both appropriately high priority and delivers benefits to all participants. An example was given of a PPP in a European country that was focused on the financial flows associated with the procurement of child sexual abuse material. Another example is the UK’s Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (JMLIT), which, from its inception, focused on national priorities that had been set on serious and organised crime. National risk assessments should provide a source for potential priority topics for information exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While having a PPP is not an explicit requirement of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards, having a well-functioning PPP can provide assessed countries with an opportunity to demonstrate effectiveness in the use of financial intelligence. Examples of PPPs being positively referenced in such a way include the most recent Mutual Evaluation Reports of the UK and Germany. Given this evidence, many countries are now exploring PPPs. It was reported that the potential for PPPs to be considered as relevant to understanding effectiveness during FATF evaluations is now being reflected in evaluator training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some specific examples of successful PPPs were discussed by participants in detail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the UK, the JMLIT had, at its heart, an operational data-sharing capability, in which investigators are able to share information about priority cases with a select group of FIs, in order to obtain additional information and insight. The JMLIT has supported and developed over 950 law enforcement investigations, which has directly contributed to over 280 arrests and the seizure or restraint of over £86 million. In addition, financial sector-led Public-Private Threat Groups and time-limited Cells involve members discussing trends and producing “JMLIT Alert” reports, which are shared with the wider financial system, allowing members of the Groups and Cells to mitigate risk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Lithuania, the Center of Excellence in Anti-Money Laundering was created in 2021 as a new organisation separate from established bodies. As well as information exchange, it undertakes training and broader dialogue between public and private sector participants. The Lithuanian experience demonstrates the importance of selecting the right financial sectors to include. Initially, the Centre was focused on traditional FIs, although there are now plans to expand to include other regulated entities. Governance arrangements include oversight via a board of shareholders that provide challenge and ensure the organisation is producing benefits for both public and private sectors. The focus was initially on strategic information sharing, as this is a practical way of commencing information exchange and supporting the development of trust and confidence between public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Poland, a private–private data-sharing initiative was established in 2017 between banks, also involving the public sector. It was focused on fraud and cyber-enabled crime, with specific topics examined, including spoofing and phishing. It has proven to be very successful, providing single points of contact for law enforcement. Importantly, prosecutors have also seen the benefit and were engaged. Data sharing across the sector has taken place, and recommendations have been developed for the banking sector as a result. It was noted that the initiative would benefit from extension into other sectors, including AML challenges in the cryptocurrency sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Germany, the Anti Financial Crime Alliance (AFCA), was launched in 2019 by BaFin, together with Germany’s FIU, the Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), and 14 banks. The AFCA is a strategic PPP, with active data contributions from both the public and private sectors. However, participants are now pushing the boundaries to transition into a more operational PPP. This shift underscores the importance of carefully selecting the appropriate model from the outset to ensure long-term effectiveness and sustainability. The AFCA requires both public and private sector participants to formally express their commitment to the partnership. The public sector provides crucial assurances that shared information will not be used against private sector entities. This mutual understanding is vital to building trust – if either side were to misuse the information, the PPP would collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experienced PPP practitioners concurred that taking small steps is important. This helps develop trust and also allows for proof of concept to be demonstrated more easily and thus confidence in the PPP initiative to build. Products and outputs from PPPs need to be practical, going beyond intention and dialogue, to provide material benefits to over-burdened private sector compliance departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International experts noted that commonly, PPPs had an initial focus on strategic work, undertaking work to share and develop typology and trend information. This was recognised as a way of starting information sharing. However, once this first step had been achieved, the aim becomes to undertake operational information sharing, which can have more direct and tangible benefits, but was more complex to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience of the workshop participants showed that support from the supervisor is vital, as is an assurance – to the extent possible – that information shared will not be applied in supervisory action against the participant firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structural differences in common and civil law systems have a strong bearing on PPPs. The purpose of operational information exchange is to help law enforcement develop intelligence. However, the legal system of some countries does not provide for law enforcement to develop intelligence in this way; a prosecutor-led approach is taken instead. However, even in these circumstances, prosecuting authorities in some countries were prepared to exchange evidential information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;open-source-intelligence-and-technologies&quot;&gt;Open Source Intelligence and Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key form of technology for PPPs is privacy enhancing technology (PET), which allows for data to be shared, including internationally, without personally identifiable information being exchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of open source intelligence was discussed in relation to PPPs. In crypto, blockchain information is open source data, and there are advanced analytic tools available to identify related illicit finance. Public sector entities may not have access to these capabilities nor always the skills required to exploit them. Therefore, PPPs involving blockchain analytics firms have the potential to provide LEAs with good intelligence on crypto threats, which may be particularly relevant to Ukraine, given the use of cryptocurrency to finance the Russian war effort and also the continued operation of sanctioned Russian cryptocurrency firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion-and-next-steps&quot;&gt;Conclusion and Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear to all workshop participants that public and private sectors benefit from working together. The workshop demonstrated an appetite from all participants to increase cooperation and share information in Ukraine. How this enhanced cooperation and information sharing might be delivered within Ukraine, taking account of the local nuances and legislative position, and how best to develop the mutual trust that would enable this, required further reflection, which the Taskforce will consider next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further key insights included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Making collaboration standard practice and shifting the culture of financial monitoring via a national PPP strategy. This can also help enhance the AML/CFT system’s effectiveness in the context of Ukraine’s upcoming MONEYVAL evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The possibility of PPPs playing a pivotal role in enhancing overall understanding and addressing key challenges on the legislation on VAs in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The importance of considering the role of technology in facilitating information exchange, either via a platform such as the FIU’s e-Cabinet, and/or via PETs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Models such as the UK’s JMLIT, the Center of Excellence in Anti-Money Laundering in Lithuania, and the PPPs in Poland and Germany demonstrate how targeted information sharing reduces irrelevant reporting to FIUs and boosts effectiveness in the fight against financial crime. It was acknowledged that, while there are clear legal obligations in place within the illicit finance framework of Ukraine, PPP work was voluntary and thus relies on building trust and confidence in collaborative working to succeed. Despite the work needed, all participants agreed that this is a goal worth striving for and could certainly provide significant value within the Ukrainian financial system, as it has already done elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英指習近平是「毛澤東二號」 被問是否煽動仇恨 黎反問：毛是最被憎恨的人？&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vasFEXK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（1月9日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第117日審訊，黎智英第25日作供。2020年12月的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目中，黎形容習近平為「人類歷史上最絕對的獨裁者」，又提到習近平比毛澤東更強大，因毛的時代經濟不如現在那麼強大，也還沒有監控人民的科技，因此「我認為西方應該警惕這強大的『毛澤東二號』」。辯方問黎是否透過上述言論，意圖煽動別人憎恨中央政府？黎聞言反問：「那代表毛澤東是最被憎恨的人？」辯方回應，這是控方的說法。黎再問：「將習近平形容為『毛澤東二號』就是煽動，那是代表毛澤東是一個最被憎恨的人嗎？」黎其後否認有意煽動憎恨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美退休軍官稱沒有人比黎智英更多與美國領袖對話-黎有點誇大&quot;&gt;美退休軍官稱沒有人比黎智英更多與美國領袖對話 黎：有點誇大&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭繼續主問，圍繞2020年11至12月的事件。辯方向黎展示2020年11月26日網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」的謄本，該次嘉賓為美國退休軍官 Jack Keane。當時拜登剛當選美國總統，而特朗普則落選及連任失敗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中稱，美國人對中國的不滿和怨恨情緒，必然會改變下屆美國政府的政策（“… the people sentiment or resentment against China definitely will change the coming administration policy.”）。辯方問黎是否在提倡美國針對中國進行更多敵對行動？黎否認，反指自己只是想說美國政府可以利用美國民眾的情緒來改變政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack Keane 在節目中稱，沒有其他人比黎智英更多與美國的領袖對話，並聚焦在香港真正發生什麼事、中共如何扼殺香港人。（“There is no person from that region of the world who has spoken more to the leaders of the United States of America than Jimmy Lai, in terms of putting the focus on truly what is happening, and how communism is strangling, you know, the people of Hong Kong.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問到 Jack Keane 上述言論是什麼意思，黎表示：「我認為這有點誇大了。」他相信對方是指自己接受不同訪問，而該些訪問可以接觸到美國的領袖，例如時任副總統彭斯、時任國務卿蓬佩奧、眾議員、國會議員等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;美退休軍官指黎的聲音關鍵-美國會支持香港&quot;&gt;美退休軍官指黎的聲音關鍵 美國會支持香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack Keane 接著稱，認為黎智英及其他人的聲音是很關鍵，在美國的國會中，對於香港發生的事件有很大支持，「我認為這種關係應該維持。」（“I do think that your voice and the voice of others is, is really critical. There is huge support, as you know, in the Congress of the United States for what is happening. And I think those relationships should continue.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，Jack Keane 口中的「支持」是什麼。黎相信是對於香港的支持，因香港的狀況使美國國會警覺，但是他不知道具體「支持」是指什麼，亦不想猜測。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎節目稱希望拜登政府不要只說不做要有實際行動&quot;&gt;黎節目稱希望拜登政府不要只說不做、要有實際行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jack Keane 亦稱，回顧特朗普在任期間的政策，他處理問題的態度強硬（had a very hard tone），言辭很強烈和對抗性（“His wording was strong, very strong, very confrontational.”）；然而拜登上任之後，美國的政策變得緩和及大幅減弱，將會造成錯誤，這是他不願樂見的。黎認同 Jack Keane，並指特朗普採取實際行動，他希望拜登政府不要只說不做，而要有實際行動。（“What President Trump has done is he walks the walk. I hope that new administration not just talk the talk but also walk the walk. And that’s very important action, not rhetoric. It’s very important for us.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎口中的「行動」是指什麼。黎僅指「任何行動、任何有必要的行動」，又指政治人物往往僅止於打嘴炮，而這是十分可怕的事，他認為應該作出實際行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否有意鼓吹美國針對中國實施制裁、封鎖或敵對行動？黎否認，強調他只是指出政治人物的問題，因他們只是打嘴炮，而不行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎強調美國通過香港相關法案乃主動作出-沒人提出要求&quot;&gt;黎強調美國通過香港相關法案乃主動作出 沒人提出要求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續向黎展示他接受「香港監察」羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）的訪問謄本，該影片於2020年11月27日被上載。黎當時指香港正在前線爭取與自由世界共同價值，故需要他們的支持，如果香港倒下，就會好像當年冷戰期間柏林倒下，如果柏林倒下，美國和歐洲國家的可信度，以及對抗蘇聯的政治意願，便會崩塌，那麼西方國家便不能最終戰勝蘇聯。（“We are in the frontier fighting for the value that the free world share with us and we need them to support us. If we fall, it’s like Berlin fall at the time when the Cold War was with Soviet Union, if Berlin falls, the credibility of the American and the European countries, political will to fight Soviet Union will be collapsed, will collapse, and there’s no way that the eventual victory of the western country over Soviet Union will prevail.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上解釋，他以柏林作為比喻，指香港正在價值之戰的前線，堅持著與西方一致的價值，如果西方忽略香港、不予以支持的話，他們的價值體系和可信性便會崩塌。被問到是否想西方國家替香港做任何事，黎表示想他們以任何形式的策略支持香港，但是黎強調自己並非政治人物，不能閱讀他們的思想或假設他們會做什麼。在法官杜麗冰追問之下，黎稱只是期望概括性的支持，而未有具體想過哪一種支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問黎，當時有否留意到美國國會已通過了數項有關香港的法案，黎稱有。李官續問，在黎眼中該些法案是否屬於對香港的支持？黎同意，但他稱不記得這些法案的具體內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官則舉例指《香港自治法案》、《香港安全港法案》，以及美國在2020年8月宣布制裁林鄭等11名中港官員，問黎是否有一點頭緒？黎回答有。然而黎強調，美國是主動作出上述舉動，沒有任何人要求他們具體要做什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎問何會形容香港在爭取自由世界價值之戰的「前線」。黎指因為香港人為了與西方相同的價值而戰，而香港正身處於中國之中，所以形容香港在「前線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎文章提及美國制裁措施-庭上否認鼓勵&quot;&gt;黎文章提及美國制裁措施 庭上否認鼓勵&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年11月29日發表的個人專欄文章〈天下圍中 拜登騎虎難下〉。黎在首段寫道，當時美國總統大選，最撐特朗普連任的是香港人和台灣人，因「大家都面對中共打壓，敵愾同仇」，又指：「川普取消香港的特殊貿易地位，取締中共萬一與美國爆發衝突的江湖救急通道，打擊中共在貿易、外交，以至政治上的靈活性。此外又制裁某些協助中共鎮壓港人的官員，要他們承受個人損失，令其他有可能參與鎮壓的官員多一重顧慮，對中共肆意鎮壓港人或多或少有個牽制作用，令為國安法蹂躪喘不過氣來的港人感到有人為我們出氣而寄存希望。」黎庭上否認上述段落鼓勵美國繼續他們所做的事，包括實施制裁，強調自己只是說出香港人的恐懼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在文章續指：「奧巴馬八年，實行多邊外交政策而一籌莫展，川普上台標榜美國優先的單邊外交政策。對華政策，單打獨鬥，不受盟友牽制，以強硬手腕掀起貿易戰，打擊中共透過貿易作違規和科技偷竊；禁制出口科技產品和晶片到中國的同時與盟友聯手制裁華為的5G系統，徹底打擊中共擴張全球的野心。」黎否認藉上述段落鼓吹美國對中國實施制裁，因當時已經發生了制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在文章中表示，拜登難以扭轉特朗普的政策，包括禁制使用華為5G、關閉孔子學院、禁止中共人員在學界從事統戰、間諜活動和竊取機密等，以及圍堵中共的國際戰線。黎在庭上亦否認藉此段落鼓吹制裁，因上述政策已經發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎擔心拜登不會繼續特朗普的強硬對華政策&quot;&gt;黎：擔心拜登不會繼續特朗普的強硬對華政策&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在文章中指：「台灣的唯一希望是西方陣營認清中共對世界和平的威脅，體認到台灣牽制中共擴張版圖的戰略作用，而積極支持美國加強對台關係。拜登若是放棄川普的強硬對華政策，台灣將大事不妙，唯有自求多福。」黎在庭上否認藉上述段落煽動對中央政府的仇恨，稱只是陳述國際社會在疫情之後怎樣回應中國威脅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問黎是否支持特朗普的強硬對華政策。黎同意，亦擔心拜登上任後會扭轉特朗普的強硬政策，包括禁止貿易、晶片科技和產品。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎：「你想這些政策繼續？」黎則稱：「我不是說我想繼續」，他的意思是擔心拜登不會繼續這些政策，「我害怕它不繼續。」李素蘭追問：「所以你希望它繼續？」黎僅稱：「我知道它將不會繼續，所以我感到害怕。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎為什麼向讀者表明他的擔憂。黎回答：「因為我擔心。」他其後指，因為他認為特朗普的政策很有效，而且特朗普對香港而言有好處，如果拜登放棄或不繼續特朗普的政策，他會感到擔憂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，是否因為中國是世界和平的威脅？黎指這是其中一個原因，此外也因為特朗普說過會認真地處理香港問題。辯方追問，黎為什麼認為這對香港是好？黎回答，因為政府受壓之下，會重新考慮《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰則表示不明白，當時是2020年11日，《國安法》經已實施。黎則稱，在政治上所有事情都可以改變，可能政府受壓、《國安法》會減弱，「當你絕望的時候，便會希望」，又指「抱著一線生機（hope against hope）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;節目稱習近平是人類歷史上最絕對的獨裁者-黎否認煽動憎恨中央&quot;&gt;節目稱「習近平是人類歷史上最絕對的獨裁者」 黎否認煽動憎恨中央&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年11月29日「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目中，黎形容「習近平是人類歷史上最絕對的獨裁者（the most absolute dictator of human history）」，因為相比起毛澤東，毛不像習般擁有強大的經濟來支持他，加上歷史上從未有領導人像習近平般擁有電子和監控科技，來監視人民的一舉一動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否意圖煽動人憎恨中央政府。黎否認，並稱只是陳述事實，因習不只作風獨裁，還擁有各種科技來監控人民。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在節目中指，經歷疫情之後，美國人對於中國更加敵對，而且比以前更有共識，這迫使政治人物改變做法，他希望即將上任的拜登能不同於奧巴馬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否意圖引起對中央政府的憎恨？黎否認，並指他只是說美國民眾的情緒有所改變，而拜登政府可以因應民眾情緒而改變對華政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不支持黃色經濟圈-僅陳述它因政府鎮壓而造成&quot;&gt;黎稱不支持黃色經濟圈 僅陳述它因政府鎮壓而造成&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在觀眾提問環節中，有人問黃色經濟圈是否可行。黎當時回答：「一個自由經濟，你好難分黃同藍嘅，呢個黃同藍呢個咁畸型嘅經濟，就因為政府嗰個鎮壓而造成嘅」，他認為黃色經濟圈會繼續，「當我哋香港受到嘅鎮壓愈嚟愈大呢，黃色經濟佢嘅存在就會繼續，甚至愈來愈緊要。」但若然中共給予香港一國兩制，或者取消《國安法》的話，「呢個鎮壓如果冇咗，黃色經濟亦會消失；否則，只會繼續。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認上述言論意圖煽動仇恨中央和香港政府，他只是想解釋「黃色經濟圈」之所以出現，是因為人們感覺到政府的打壓，他只是在節目中陳述事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到是否支持「黃色經濟圈」，黎說他其實並不支持，因他信奉自由市場，但是他感受到人們光顧「黃色經濟圈」是因為他們支持爭取自由的運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指中央是獨裁-因一黨專政&quot;&gt;黎指中央是獨裁 因一黨專政&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方引述控方指控，問黎是否意圖透過在整集節目中描述獨裁者形象，宣揚針對習近平和中央政府的仇恨？黎否認。辯方又問，是否意圖作出詆毀？黎否認，強調只是陳述事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否意圖將中央政府描述成獨裁？黎則表示：「我覺得這是獨裁，這是眾所週知的，我不知道為什麼我有需要描述。」辯方追問為何黎認為中央政府是獨裁。黎稱因為中央是一黨專政，只有一個政黨控制整個國家。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦否認有意透過該集節目激使他人非法地改變香港既有政制、引起香港居民之間的不滿、煽惑他人不守法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;twitter帖文指制裁措施有效用-黎稱李兆富撰寫他本人不認同&quot;&gt;Twitter帖文指制裁措施有效用 黎稱李兆富撰寫、他本人不認同&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方向黎展示2020年12月1日的 Twitter 帖文，當時黎轉載《蘋果》英文版新聞，林鄭稱因為遭制裁而家裡藏有一疊現金鈔票，黎加上評論：「拜登政府應該知道，使協助中共鎮壓的人須付上責任，那些措施可以打擊他們作惡的士氣，因此縱使措施似乎導致很小程度的不方便，但是會有效用。」（“Biden administration should know that by making those abetting CCP repression personally accountable, the measures can frustrate their morale of evil doing, thus will be effective even the measures may seem inconveniences in small ways.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上指上述帖文由「徒弟」李兆富撰寫，又表示雖然與李的思路相似，但是他不認為帖文所述的措施實際上有效，形容「目的有效，但結果是沒有效」。辯方指，帖文所述的「措施」相信是指制裁，問黎是否知道為何李會這樣寫？黎則稱，林鄭被美國制裁是國安法生效之前發生的事，可能他覺得這樣寫無傷大雅（harmless），因此一時疏忽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到有否閱讀過帖文，黎稱可能閱讀過，但是未有閱讀該新聞連結，也可能是看漏了。對於帖文形容措施「有效用」，黎則表示不認同。辯方問黎有否在事後與李兆富討論帖文？黎稱沒有，因為「這太細碎，用不著去理會它」。法官杜麗冰聞言問，黎這樣說是什麼意思？黎則回答，不論措施有效用或是無效用，這是非常細碎的問題，因為當時事情已經發生了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問是否藉形容習近平為毛澤東二號煽動仇恨-黎反問毛是被憎恨的人&quot;&gt;辯方問是否藉形容習近平為「毛澤東二號」煽動仇恨 黎反問：毛是被憎恨的人？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年12月1日「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」節目中，黎表示希望拜登政府能將新疆的法治、自由和人權扣連，作為與中國所有談判的先決條件。黎再一次形容習近平為「人類歷史上最絕對的獨裁者」，因從沒有人好像他般有電子科技和監控系統，來監視人民的一舉一動和言論。黎指習近平已經犯錯，因他獨攬大權，否則整個世界不會與他作對，又肯定習將會犯大錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認意圖引起別人憎恨中央政府，因他只是嘗試解釋為何習近平是「人類歷史上最絕對的獨裁者」，因為中國的經濟實力和電子監控系統。黎又指，自從習上台之後，整個世界才開始反對中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在節目中提到，很多人說習近平好比毛澤東般強大，但是他認為說法錯誤，反指習近平比毛澤東更強大，因毛的時代經濟不如現在那麼強大，也還沒有監控人民的科技，因此「我認為西方應該警惕這強大的『毛澤東二號』（“So I think the West should be alert of this powerful Mao Zedong No.2.”）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否透過將習近平形容為「毛澤東二號」，意圖煽動別人憎恨中央政府？黎聞言反問：「提及毛澤東就是煽動憎恨，那代表毛澤東是最被憎恨的人？」辯方回應，這是控方的說法。黎再問：「將習近平形容為『毛澤東二號』就是煽動，那是代表毛澤東是一個最被憎恨的人嗎？」辯方問：「所以你的答案是什麼？」黎隨即否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎中國對澳洲實施禁運是欺凌-官質疑若然實施禁運的人不是中國呢&quot;&gt;黎：中國對澳洲實施禁運是「欺凌」 官質疑：若然實施禁運的人不是中國呢？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在同集節目稱，中國對澳洲實施禁運，宣布禁止出口龍蝦、大麥和葡萄酒等到澳洲，黎形容這是中共對澳洲的「欺凌」。黎指西方國家聯盟需要共同行事，以援助被中共「欺凌」的國家。黎在庭上指，中國應該融入世界，如果中國改變過往態度或跟從世界貿易的規矩，他們才是真正融入世界。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問黎，一般而言，如果一個國家對另一國家實施禁運，他們有否跟從世界貿易的規矩？黎指澳洲因為支持香港而被中國實施禁運。杜官重申只是問及一般情況，實施禁運是否不符合世界貿易規矩，籲黎簡短回答。黎則稱澳洲只是一個例子，若回答問題需要解釋該國家實施禁運的背景，「否則跟你討論是無意義的（senseless）。」杜官追問，黎說中國對澳洲實施禁運是不對，但若然實施禁運的人不是中國呢？黎則重申要回答的話則需要談及相關背景，否則討論是沒有用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官表示，她只是嘗試理解黎口中的「世界貿易規矩」是什麼，似乎他無法解釋。黎指，有的禁運是合理，有的是不合理。杜官質疑，合理與否應由誰人判斷，並質疑貿易規矩應該一視同仁，沒有酌情的餘地。黎最後指，相關貿易規矩必須是「純粹貿易（pure trade）」，不能在貿易中摻雜政治。杜官聞言說：「對，這是我想說的意思。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭則問及黎稱澳洲因支持香港而被禁運的說法。黎確認澳洲是因為支持香港和新疆，而被中國實施禁運，又指法官可自行查核相關資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英：若香港有政治犯則不認為有法治和自由 官提醒黎被捕非關政治&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pRba4oL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（1月8日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第116日審訊，黎智英第24日作供。黎在2020年11月的網上節目中提到，《國安法》威嚇到社會各界，但他認為市民已沒有爭取自由的空間，不能再有任何示威。辯方引述《國安法》指應當保障法治和人權，黎則表示：「如果這裡有政治犯的話，我不認為有法治和自由。」他又指當時自己已經被捕，相信香港將會出現政治犯。法官杜麗冰則提醒黎，他是因為香港的刑事罪行而被捕，而不是因為政治，問黎：「你明白嗎？」黎聽罷僅表示：「我明白你所說的話。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱對談節目前不會商討話題-所有東西都是即興發生&quot;&gt;黎稱對談節目前不會商討話題 「所有東西都是即興發生」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭繼續主問，圍繞2020年11月的事件。2020年11月13日，黎在網上節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」與嘉賓、前港督彭定康對談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方提問下，黎確認所有節目嘉賓均是經其私人助手 Mark Simon 或朋友介紹。辯方問到，在對談節目開始之前，黎有否跟另一名主持人 Mark Clifford 商量將會討論什麼話題，或者閱讀任何文件或資料。黎則表示沒有，又指：「所有東西都是即興發生。」辯方接著問，黎怎樣確保節目嘉賓不會利用這個平台來犯罪？黎表示當時沒有想過這個問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中指，港英政府雖然未有給予香港人民主，但是留下了一些自由的慣例（freedom institution），包括法治和言論自由等，當香港人意識到這些自由慣例被奪去，他們便因而上街抗爭。（“And that’s why when we sense that our freedom and rule of law were about to be taken away, we all rose up and fight in the street.”）黎指若果200萬市民上街的話，會使政權感到害怕，所以他們推出《國安法》以鎮壓示威。（“If 2 million people went out and all that and that made them very scared and that’s why they have to make their national security law, they have to now clamp down on us.”）辯方問黎是否在這裡意圖煽惑其他人上街？黎否認，稱只是道出事實。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎自稱為政治犯-官你是因為香港的刑事罪行而被捕&quot;&gt;黎自稱為政治犯 官：你是因為香港的刑事罪行而被捕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎繼續在節目中稱，《國安法》威嚇到社會各界，但是強調要繼續爭取法治和自由，但他不認為市民還有這樣的空間，因為《國安法》已完全威嚇到人們，他們不能再有任何示威。（“But I’m afraid, yes, we have to go on and fight for the rule of law and the freedom. But I don’t think we still have the space to do that because the National Security Law has totally intimidated people here that we can’t have any demonstration.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提及，《國安法》第4條指維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，第5條指應當堅持法治原則，問黎是否知道。黎則表示：「如果這裡有政治犯的話，我不認為有法治和自由。」辯方追問，在節目播出當日、即2020年11月中的時候，香港是否有任何政治犯？黎稱：「我相信將會有，而當時我亦已經被捕。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰向黎說：「你說你是一名政治犯，但是你不明白你是因為香港的刑事罪行而被捕的嗎？不是因為政治，而是被指控干犯罪行。」黎表示：「OK、OK。」杜官問黎：「你明白嗎？」黎僅表示：「我明白你所說的話。」杜官其後未有追問下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎節目引述蓬佩奧說台灣從不是中國的一部份-推測中美角力升級&quot;&gt;黎節目引述蓬佩奧說「台灣從不是中國的一部份」 推測中美角力升級&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示2020年11月19日「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」的對話謄本。黎在節目中說，他愈是身陷險境，便愈能引起外界注意香港，又形容「這是我一生中最美好的時光，若入獄可能甚至更好」。他認為自己應該留在香港、令人們關注香港，尤其是當香港新聞在世界視野中愈來愈少。黎庭上解釋，街頭上沒有了示威、立法會中也沒有人抗爭，所以他更應該到處發聲，引起人們對香港的關注，即是透過進行網上對談節目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎口中的「險境」是什麼。黎表示「迫害（persecution）」，辯方要求黎澄清是「檢控（prosecution）」還是「迫害（persecution）」，黎回答意思是檢控，但是：「我會說是『迫害』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「若入獄可能甚至更好」一句，辯方問黎是否打算刻意犯案來使自己入獄。黎否認並說：「我並不是瘋狂的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在節目中引述時任美國國務卿蓬佩奧說過「台灣從不是中國的一部份」（“You know like Pompeo says, that you know, Taiwan is never part of China.”），並指美國這樣說是利用台灣來使中美角力升級（“They say this (because) it’s using Taiwan to raise up the bar of rivalry.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到上述言論意思，黎指台灣一直是敏感的議題，他認為美國會利用台灣作為焦點，提升與中國之間的角力標準，這是他的推測和分析。辯方追問黎有什麼基礎作出這樣的推測。黎表示乃基於美國提升台灣的地位，加上蓬佩奧說「台灣從不是中國的一部份」，而他從未聽聞蓬佩奧說過類似言論，因此認為美國使中美角力升級。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問：「透過說出不實的言論嗎？（蓬佩奧說）台灣不是中國的一部份。」黎則回答：「台灣是否中國的一部份，我認為歷史學家能夠回答你⋯⋯但我不能夠回答你。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱拜登政府應利用美國人對中國不滿情緒&quot;&gt;黎稱拜登政府應利用美國人對中國不滿情緒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎續在節目表示，美國人對於中國有什麼概念或看法，很視乎拜登釋出什麼訊息。黎在庭上解釋，美國人因為疫情而對中國有怨恨情緒，他認為拜登政府應該利用美國人這種情緒。被問到是否鼓吹拜登政府針對中國採取敵對行動，黎否認，因為政治一向都是關乎人們的情緒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在節目中稱，特朗普不採取多邊主義，而是採取單邊主義（“Trump did not try to be multilateral, but unilateral.”）。黎庭上解釋，他的意思是指出特朗普採取單邊主義做法。辯方問黎主張採用多邊主義，還是單邊主義。黎則稱，他當時只是想說特朗普的單邊主義做法很有效。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中稱，特朗普使西方自由國家知道，若然他們沒有美國，他們便不能與中國產生槓桿作用（“… without the US they will have no leverage against China.”），因此只能向特朗普的政策靠攏。辯方問黎是否鼓吹外國針對中國進行敵對行為。黎否認，強調自己在陳述事實，解釋為什麼其他國家支持特朗普的政策，因為他們不能各自單獨地與中國交涉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中指「我們最大的鎮壓者是中國，如果美國與中國能有效地交涉，我們會更加安全。我們會更自由，以及能夠更好地維持法治」。黎在庭上表示，他只是陳述中共的壓力，至於「安全」則意指免受國安法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指現時市民不能自在地說出心中所想-屬迫害&quot;&gt;黎指現時市民不能自在地說出心中所想 屬「迫害」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方向黎出示2020年11月20日「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」的對話謄本，當日嘉賓為以色列前副總理、俄羅斯異見人士夏蘭斯基（Natan Sharansky）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中稱，在如此高壓的迫害及對自由法治的打壓之下，「無可避免地我們的希望會被破滅，我們愈使希望破滅，我們便會愈弱勢。」（“Under such a high pressure of persecutions and clampdown on our freedom and rule of law, it’s inevitable that our hope will be dashed, and the more we dash our hope, the weaker we get.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到「高壓的迫害」是指什麼，黎說：「我認為政治壓力就是迫害」，他解釋：「我認為，如果你說了不當的言論，便會遭到拘捕」，可是以往市民有言論自由，可以自在地說出心中所想，如今卻不能這樣說，他認為這就是「迫害」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認上述言論意圖引起對政府的憎恨，並強調只是向夏蘭斯基說出香港的實際情況。黎亦否認有意激使他人非法改變香港的既有制度，又指當時他們不能做任何事情，如果有人認為他能激使別人的話是想法「天真」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱一旦入獄-全世界便會注意香港&quot;&gt;黎稱一旦入獄 全世界便會注意香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎接著在節目中稱，「我愈是身處險境，我便愈有效地使外界留意香港人。」（“The more dangerous (situation) I am in, the more effective I can bring the attention of the outside world’s people to Hong Kong.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到「險境」的意思，黎表示：「我正在處於被人送入監獄的險境。」他提到自己正時已在監獄之中。辯方則著黎集中在2020年11月的時候，而非今日的情況。黎表示，當時人們亦肯定他會入獄，「因為我總是經常發聲，參與示威和爭取自由運動，總是處於示威的前線。」黎認為，一旦他入獄，新聞便會鋪天蓋地，那麼全世界便會注意香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否打算故意觸犯法律，以圖使外界注意香港？黎否認，並重申他只是談論當時的狀況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱不憎恨中共-惟中共使他自由受到威脅&quot;&gt;黎稱不憎恨中共 惟中共使他自由受到威脅&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中說，西方過去20多年來模糊了道德界線，並且讓中國蓬勃發展，而中國卻利用經濟實力來向其他人加諸其價值，這種行為冒犯了全世界人民的體統。（“They let China flourish, you know, (and China) impose their value with their economic power, you know, the behaviour that’s really offend(ed) the sense of decency of the people in the world.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問，為何當一個國家向其他國家加諸價值觀，而該價值觀與其他國家不一致的時候，就被形容為「冒犯了全世界人民的體統」？黎指遵守禮儀、做出恰當的行為才是符合世界的體統，但是中國以不同的價值觀與世界交涉、不遵守規則，便會冒犯全世界的體統。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否意圖引起別人憎恨中央政府。黎否認，他稱雖然他有敵人，但是他不會有仇恨；他亦不會仇恨中共，並強調：「我就是無法仇恨。」辯方追問，黎既然沒有仇恨，那為何中共是敵人？黎僅說：「我交由法庭作出裁斷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭追問黎，誰是他的敵人。黎指任何人都可以成為他的敵人，他在個人層面上亦有很多敵人。李素蘭問：「那麼中共呢？」黎回答，中共可以是他的敵人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎認為中共憎恨他嗎？黎不認為中共憎恨他。辯方又問，那黎憎恨中共嗎？黎表示沒有。辯方問，那為何黎形容中共是他的潛在敵人（potential enemy）？黎回答：「因為中共，我的自由總是受到威脅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指政府害怕內地人擁有自由-杜官問若是如此為何寫入基本法&quot;&gt;黎指政府害怕內地人擁有自由 杜官問若是如此為何寫入《基本法》？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中稱，英國殖民政府雖然未有給予香港人民主，但是給予了法治、私有產權、言論自由、集會自由和宗教自由等，「中國很害怕我們，因為我們與西方共同擁抱的價值對中國而言是很危險⋯⋯所以他們想打壓我們。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎為何說中共「想鎮壓我們」，黎稱因為中共害怕中國人會因為香港的價值而受到影響。法官李素蘭問黎是否有意使中共成為人民的敵人？黎否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰提到，《基本法》保障香港有言論、集會及宗教自由等，「我們的確有這些」，問黎為何會在節目中說中國害怕中國人受到香港的價值影響？黎則指香港的確有這些自由，可是中國內地的人沒有這些自由，因政府害怕內地人擁有這些自由，他們也不想香港人影響到內地人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官追問，如果政府不想香港人擁有的自由會影響到中國內地人，那為什麼他們將這些自由寫入《基本法》？黎僅表示：「那麼問他們吧，不要問我。」他接著反問杜官：「你認為中國裡的中國人有言論自由、有宗教自由嗎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官指現在不是談論中國內地，而是香港，並重申她的根本問題是，若然中國政府害怕香港擁有的自由，為何中國政府允許將言論自由等寫入《基本法》之中。黎僅重申，根本的問題是中國不容許人民有言論、宗教和集會自由，而中國害怕人民看到香港擁有自由，會受到影響。杜官聽罷表示仍然感到困惑，不過她不打算追問下去，著辯方律師繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指中國投放大量金錢監控人民-否認煽惑內地人憎恨中央政府&quot;&gt;黎指中國投放大量金錢監控人民 否認煽惑內地人憎恨中央政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中稱，中國在監控系統及控制人民方面投放大量金錢，控制愈大，人民反抗便會愈大，用於監控的金錢便會愈多。辯方問黎是否有意煽惑中國內地人憎恨中央政府。黎失笑並反問：「我怎樣煽惑中國內地的人？當他們根本不知道我說過什麼，因為他們不被容許。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;夏蘭斯基提到，希望美國總統能夠將科技方面與中國的合作，與新疆的維吾爾族、香港人和黎的命運扣連；黎表示贊同，並指這種扣連是很重要。黎庭上否認在這裡鼓吹美國針對中國實施制裁或敵對行動，又指如果認為上述言論能夠煽惑到人是很天真。辯方追問為何黎在節目中認同這種扣連很重要。黎表示，若美國能夠扣連的話，他及其他異見人士便會安全。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Mark Simon曾支付1萬美元研究拜登兒子醜聞 黎智英：事前不知情&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2pIVH77.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（1月7日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第115日審訊，黎智英第23日作供。黎在2020年10月的網上節目中，表示希望特朗普連任，因他採取強硬態度及面對現實，並且承諾過會處理香港問題。黎供稱，其私人助手 Mark Simon 曾經動用其私人公司的金錢，向研究人員支付1萬元美金，讓他們作出有關拜登兒子 Hunter Biden 醜聞的研究，可是後來美國傳媒報導，撰寫相關研究報告的人是一名虛擬人物。黎則稱事前對於 Mark Simon 注資相關研究並不知情，又指 Mark 是以個人名義參與，所以黎在 Twitter 發文澄清該研究與《蘋果》及其本人無關。據黎理解，因為 Mark 是忠實的共和黨黨員，如果揭發了有關對手拜登的醜聞的話，拜登會落選，所以 Mark 參與研究計劃是合乎邏輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱特朗普任內外交政策上做了很多事中東減衝突&quot;&gt;黎稱特朗普任內外交政策上做了很多事、中東減衝突&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭向黎智英展示2020年10月22日「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」對話謄本。黎在節目中指特朗普擔任美國總統期間，在外交政策上做了很多事情，例如中東地區，但是主流媒體不予以報導，因為他們大部份都討厭特朗普。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上解釋，中東地區長期以來不能預見達到和平，但是在特朗普任內期間，中東似乎較少見到衝突。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭一度關注，為何有時辯方要求黎閱讀謄本，有時則直接播放節目相關片段。關文渭則指要視乎他打算問黎什麼問題。黎庭上表示，閱讀謄本於他而言較好，又提到經過4年半被監禁（註：黎從2020年12月被還柙起，至今約有4年），他的聽力大幅衰退，「我不知道為什麼，但是我以前聽得很清楚」，然而昨日庭上播放影片時也聽得有點困難。法官杜麗冰提醒黎，若果黎聽得不清楚的話，可隨時在庭上提出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指特朗普採取強硬態度是正確做法-故冀他連任&quot;&gt;黎指特朗普採取強硬態度是正確做法 故冀他連任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中指，特朗普與中國交涉的方式是正確的做法，他希望這做法能夠持續，所以希望特朗普能夠當選並連任。（“But I tell you, Trump’s way of dealing with China is the right approach and I hope this approach will be persisting. So I hope Donald Trump will be re-elected.”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上解釋，「特朗普與中國交涉的方式」即是採取強硬態度（play hardball），代表特朗普面對現實，以及會與之對抗。辯方追問相關「現實」意思是什麼。黎指「現實」即是「中國的本質（What China is or was）」。法官李素蘭追問，黎認為特朗普怎樣「與之對抗」。黎僅指，特朗普會以他自己的方式去對抗。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方要求黎具體說明「特朗普與中國交涉的方式」所指為何。黎回答，特朗普與中國脫鈎了很多，例如在貿易上停止向中國輸出晶片、禁止輸出晶片技術。辯方問黎是否提倡特朗普繼續做他一直在做的事。黎回答是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何希望特朗普連任美國總統，黎表示因為他關注香港的狀況，而特朗普承諾過會認真地處理香港問題，他相信特朗普是一個言而有信的人，所以希望他能連任，以解決《國安法》問題。辯方指，當時《國安法》已經在港實施。黎則回應：「在政治上，任何事情都有可能改變，作為一種手段。」辯方又問，黎知道特朗普有否說過會就香港而言做什麼？黎則稱不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指很多朋友批評他支持特朗普-惟他認為特朗普面對現實態度強硬&quot;&gt;黎指很多朋友批評他支持特朗普 惟他認為特朗普面對現實、態度強硬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年10月27日的 Twitter 帖文，黎寫道：「有些朋友批評我支持特朗普，是不正確。我抱歉。但是特朗普與中國交涉的方式一直以來很有效，而這直接影響我們。我只是表達我們的意見，使世界有更全面的理解。（“Some friends accused me for supporting Trump in election is inference and it is not right. I apologise. But Trump’s dealing with China has been effective and it directly affect us here. I am just expressing our opinion so the world can see the bigger picture.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問到，黎身邊有沒有朋友批評他支持特朗普？黎表示有很多朋友常常批評他支持特朗普。被問到為何支持特朗普，黎指特朗普面對現實，會採取強硬態度，並且承諾會與中國交涉，從而認真處理香港問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問黎知不知道特朗普做了什麼處理香港問題。黎則指特朗普未能當選連任，因此不能做任何事。辯方澄清問題是特朗普過往在其任內做了什麼工作。黎指他撤回香港特殊地位。法官李素蘭問黎認為此舉有效嗎？黎同意有效，即使對香港無效，但對於中國卻有效，並且期望可以使國安法條文減弱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎在節目表示自己愈被針對便愈有價值&quot;&gt;黎在節目表示自己愈被針對便愈有價值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年10月29日「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」對話謄本。黎表示：「我愈是被針對，我覺得我便愈有價值。所以我愈是受壓，我便應該有更大的聲音，那世界便會留意到。我覺得我很感恩可以擔當這個角色。（“You know, the more I’m pinpointed, I think the valuable I am. So the more pressure I have, the greater the voice I should have. So the world will pay notice. And I think I’m very grateful for this, for this role to play.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎口中的「壓力」是指什麼。黎指受壓迫（persecution）；「世界便會留意到」這句意思是人們會更加留意他。辯方問，截至2020年10月底，黎承受什麼類型的「壓迫」？黎則表示當時他已遭拘捕一次，他認為自己會再次被捕，「我幾乎可以肯定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在觀眾提問的環節中，有觀眾問黎作為傳媒人，對於特朗普將「唔啱聽嘅問題或者媒體」形容為「假新聞」有何看法。黎則指不能否認美國有假新聞的情況，例如拜登兒子 Hunter Biden 的醜聞，很多主流媒體不去揭發、不去報道，而是去隱瞞，這情況比假新聞更加嚴重。他指特朗普「有時講嘢講得快過頭，或者係唔啱，或者甚至佢唔準確」，但是不代表傳媒沒有假新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;外媒揭發拜登兒子醜聞報告發布者為虛構人物-黎私人助手曾注資相關研究-黎稱不知情&quot;&gt;外媒揭發拜登兒子醜聞報告發布者為虛構人物 黎私人助手曾注資相關研究 黎稱不知情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提及，時任《蘋果》社長張劍虹在2020年10月17日向英文版群組傳送5條台灣《蘋果》新聞連結，分別為：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示黎與時任《蘋果》副社長陳沛敏之間的訊息，陳在2020年10月30日下午2時許向黎傳送NBC新聞連結「How a fake persona laid the groundwork for a Hunter Biden conspiracy deluge」（一名虛假人物如何打造基礎使 Hunter Biden 的陰謀論氾濫）。該報導指一份64頁、關於拜登兒子在中國的經濟活動報告流出，經調查之後，相信報告是出自一間虛構的「情報機構」，發布者則是一名虛構人物，惟該報告被大幅利用以詆毀拜登和削弱其選舉工程。一名前大學教授受訪時指稱該報告是經《蘋果》委託而撰寫，虛構人物只為了發布報告而設，但是真正撰寫報告的人的身份則需要保密。報導並未有指出報告內容是虛假。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 前《蘋果日報》執行總編輯 林文宗（左）、前《蘋果日報》副社長 陳沛敏（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎稱不記得自己有否按入連結閱讀相關新聞，但陳沛敏其後告訴他《蘋果》被捲入假新聞事件之中，所以得悉事件。黎稱他記得自己在同日下午3時闖進《蘋果》高層的編採會議中，他向高層強調他與假新聞事件無關。黎稱這是他唯一一次在編採會議中現身。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎憶述，其後私人助手 Mark Simon 致電他，告知他曾經動用黎的金錢，向研究人員支付1萬元美金，讓他們作出有關拜登兒子醜聞的研究，可是後來發現原來是假新聞。黎稱事前對於 Mark Simon 注資相關研究並不知情。而 Mark Simon 在電話中堅稱沒有委託作出有關醜聞的研究，他亦一度提出，若黎需在 Twitter 作出澄清的話，在「這個情況下我需要辭職」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何 Mark Simon 會主動致電黎，黎估計可能 Mark Simon 看到《蘋果》的聲明之後，便致電他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎-twitter-發布帖文稱不知情與假新聞事件無關&quot;&gt;黎 Twitter 發布帖文稱不知情、與假新聞事件無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎同日在 Twitter 發布3則帖文，分別為：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;（轉載香港《蘋果日報》的聲明）我為《蘋果日報》受到NBC新聞牽連感到抱歉。但是《蘋果》與事件無關，我與事件無關。我的私人助手 Mark Simon 現在告知我們，他曾與計劃合作，雖然他沒有策劃。（I’m sorry that Apple Daily was implicated by the NBC article. But Apple Daily has nothing to do with it. I’ve nothing to do with it. My assistant Mark Simon now informed us that he worked with the project, although had not commissioned it.）&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mark 使用我的私人公司金錢去支付他所要求的研究。這只是1萬元美金，所以他不需經我的批准。（Mark used my private company’s money to reimburse for the research he requested. It’s only US$10,000 so he didn’t have to have my approval.）&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;當我們的記者問我對於NBC文章的回應時，我感到震驚。我知道這對於任何人而言，都難以相信我並不知情，而我的誠信受損。（I was shocked when our reporter asked me for response to the NBC article. I know it is hard for anyone to believe that I didn’t know about it and my integrity is damaged.）&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，黎理應對於《蘋果》被捲入假新聞事件感到很緊張，希望《蘋果》保持距離，問黎不會跟陳沛敏討論、以《蘋果》名義發表聲明嗎？黎則稱自己當時未有認真對待事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官質疑黎自稱未認真對待事件，可是在 Twitter 卻一連發布了3則帖文。杜官又追問，黎不會打算發表聲明，澄清《蘋果》與假新聞事件無關嗎？黎同意這做法是很自然，然而他當時未有如此做，但是他記得報紙其他同事很認真地對待事件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官繼續追問，黎最後表示：「我不知道為什麼，可能這是我未有足夠認真地對待事件的方式。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，黎的第一則 Twitter 帖文轉載了《蘋果》的聲明，問高層是否發表了聲明而未有通知他？黎指高層發表聲明前不需要知會他，又表示不知道聲明內容，因他從不參與編採會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指-mark-是共和黨忠實黨員-故參與醜聞研究計劃&quot;&gt;黎指 Mark 是共和黨忠實黨員 故參與醜聞研究計劃&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就 Mark Simon 請辭一事，黎憶述美國國防部前副部長 Paul Wolfowitz 認為 Mark 辭職不是正確的事，於是跟 Mark 傾談過。Mark 經過數日時間冷靜之後，後來決定留下，繼續擔任黎的私人助手。被問到是否想 Mark 辭職，黎亦表示不想。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎，有否問過 Mark Simon 為何參與研究計劃中？黎稱沒有，指 Mark 已經告訴我他參與其中，反問：「那我為何要問他為什麼呢？」但他其後解釋，因為 Mark 是忠實的共和黨黨員，而對手拜登屬於民主黨，如果揭發了有關拜登的醜聞的話，拜登會落選，所以 Mark 參與在調查計劃中是合乎邏輯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指mark-simon以個人名義參與研究計劃-故需twitter發文澄清與蘋果無關&quot;&gt;黎指Mark Simon以個人名義參與研究計劃 故需Twitter發文澄清與《蘋果》無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，Mark Simon 為何要辭去私人助手職務。黎稱 Mark 未有告知他原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎指，Mark 以個人名義參與研究計劃，但他因為是黎的私人助手，所以某程度上與《蘋果》有關，因此黎需要在 Twitter 發布帖文，以澄清研究計劃與《蘋果》和黎本人無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，Mark Simon 使用了他私人公司的金錢，所以黎會受到牽連，因此即使《蘋果》發表了聲明，黎本人依然需要在 Twitter 發文澄清與研究計劃無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎節目提議拜登使台灣加入四邊安全對話-官質疑台非國家不可能加入&quot;&gt;黎節目提議拜登使台灣加入「四邊安全對話」 官質疑台非國家不可能加入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年11月12日「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」的對話謄本，該集嘉賓為前美國在台協會主席薄瑞光（Raymond Burghardt）。其時拜登剛當選為美國總統。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中指，拜登政府需要向中共展示力量，以及向其他亞洲國家顯示美國如何保護台灣。黎亦提議，拜登政府應該將台灣加入成為「四邊安全對話（Quadrilateral Security Dialogue，簡稱 QUAD）」其中一方。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問黎是否想台灣成為一個獨立國家。黎則指台灣不可能成為獨立國家，但是不一定需要成為獨立國家也能加入「四邊安全對話」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰質疑，當台灣是中國的一部份，並非一個主權國家，黎說台灣可以加入「四邊安全對話」是不合常理。黎則指，台灣不可能獨立成為國家，但是不代表它不能尋求其他國家的保護，又形容中國對台灣而言是威脅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官則作比喻指，一個孩子不能獨立於其父母，然而黎的言論猶如叫孩子走到另一對家長之下，叫他們最好保護該孩子，以對抗孩子的父母。黎則堅稱這是有可能的，因為該孩子並不承認其父親。黎又強調，孩子不可能否認自己是其父母的兒子，但是他可以不願意承認他們為父母。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before sunrise on 8 December 2024, Bashar al-Assad boarded a plane and left the country he had ruled with an iron fist for so long. Curiously, he opted for the longer flight to Moscow rather than the much shorter hop to neighbour and long-term ally Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, Assad’s destination was inconsequential. What mattered was that the hated autocrat, who had killed at least 600,000 of his own people, was gone. But concerned pundits tempered the enthusiasm, invoking recent instances where an Arab dictator had fallen to illustrate that Syria’s future was far from bright: looting, instability and violence could be expected to follow. Optimists claimed that this time was different. Syria is not Iraq, nor is it Libya. Syria is Syria. And in Syria, it was not a foreign occupier that made regime change possible. Quite the opposite: this was the product of the Syrian people’s own blood, sweat and tears. They had finally not just removed a home-grown dictator but also freed themselves from Russian and Iranian domination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the optimists and the pessimists are right. This was the Syrian people’s triumph. Likewise, Syria has seen some looting, but nothing like the widespread anarchy after the fall of Saddam Hussein. But pessimists are right to focus on “the day after”. Once the celebrations end, Syrians will have to decide what kind of country they want and who should lead it. Yet Syria is not a coherent, unified state. It is made up of multiple armed groups with different goals and foreign backers. Thus, the country’s future – and which external powers will control a significant stake in a post-Assad Syria – will not be a decision that the Syrian people will make alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-former-status-quo&quot;&gt;The Former Status Quo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria under Assad was neither free nor sovereign. Assad’s rule was brutal, yet his regime did not enjoy the monopoly over power within Syria’s borders that is a necessary component of statehood. Before Assad’s fall, the country was de facto partitioned: the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) held eastern Syria, the Islamist Hayut Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) ruled the northern Idlib province, and the Syrian National Army (SNA) was sandwiched between SDF and HTS-controlled territory. Even in areas Assad nominally controlled, such as the southern Daraa province, in practice it was local militias from the Southern Front (SF), whose loyalty flipped between the rebels and the regime, who really called the shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these groups has one or more foreign benefactors. The SDF are US-backed. HTS, on the other hand, are closer to Turkey than any other foreign power. But they are not a Turkish proxy; that dubious honour falls to the SNA. The SF were US- and Jordanian-backed before switching to Russia’s payroll in 2018. As HTS’s offensive gained momentum, though, many former SF groups became rebels again and reconstituted themselves as the Southern Operations Room (SOR). Assad may have fled, but none of these internal groups or their foreign backers are going to disappear anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;turkey-triumphant&quot;&gt;Turkey Triumphant?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most powerful external actor in Syria today is Turkey. Since the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2011, Ankara has perceived the conflict as both a threat and an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat is less Syrian Arab and more Kurdish. Because of the Assad regime’s weakness, eastern Syria’s Rojava – with its Kurdish majority – became an autonomous region. Rojava’s SDF government either provided shelter for PKK militants or (if one believes Turkey) is functionally indistinguishable from the group. Given that the PKK seeks to create a Kurdish state which includes the Turkish regions that border northeast Syria, Ankara sees the SDF as an existential threat. It wants to remove the SDF from its border and, if possible, destroy the group entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Assad regime fighting for its survival, Turkey also saw an opportunity to project its power into Syria. In 2019, it occupied a 100-mile deep “safe zone” in northern Syria and reconstituted parts of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) as the SNA. Bolstering its ranks with Turkish jihadists, who like Russia’s convict armies in Ukraine were released from jail on the condition that they serve their country abroad, Ankara turned the FSA from an ally into a proxy. Turkey also changed the SNA’s primary target from Assad to the SDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrently, Turkey cultivated ties to HTS, a jihadist group who seized power in Idlib in 2017. Turkey did (and at the time of writing, still does) list HTS as a terrorist organisation. But it kept HTS’s administration afloat by opening Idlib’s Turkish border for trade. It also hampered the Assad regime’s freedom to act against HTS by posting the Turkish military to Idlib and mediating with Russia to “de-escalate” the fighting. Ankara thus achieved an impressive symmetry of having a proxy (the SNA) and an ally (HTS) operating in adjacent provinces. This allowed Turkey to become more powerful in Syria than it had ever been in modern times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTS has, to say the least, also benefitted from the relationship. Despite possessing only around 20–30,000 fighters, HTS led the offensive that caused a mass rout among Assad’s forces. As such, it holds most of the cards in a post-Assad Syria. Turkey continues to constitute a vital ally for HTS. The Director of Turkey’s National Intelligence Agency, Ibrahim Kalin, was the first foreign official to publicly meet with HTS’s leader, Ahmed al-Shara. Once this taboo had been broken, officials from the UK, France and Germany – among others – lined up to meet the former jihadist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us-jordan-and-israel-return&quot;&gt;The US, Jordan and Israel Return&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In eastern Syria, the SDF controls most of Syria’s oil, and the group were on the frontline in the fight against Islamic State fighters. Both these facts have earned the SDF powerful friends in Washington. Most of the 2,000 US troops in Syria operate in or around SDF territory and have helped shield the group from SNA and Turkish attacks. Meanwhile, in southern Syria, Jordan is working to reassert its influence. It re-opened one of its border crossings with Syria and hosted representatives from the US, EU, UN and Arab world for an international conference on Syria in December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel, meanwhile, was as surprised as everyone else by the Assad regime’s fall, and as a result imported its standard failsafe policies when it feels insecure – a combination of territorial occupation and blunt military force – to Syria. Israel captured the western side of the mountainous Golan Heights region from Syria in the June 1967 “Six-Day War.” Later, during the early years of the civil war, through its “good neighbour” policy, Israel provided aid to civilians living on the Syrian-controlled eastern Golan. It ended that policy when the Assad regime reasserted control of the region in 2018. But with Assad’s border guards suddenly deserting after Damascus fell to HTS in late 2024, Israel returned to Syria. It sent troops to capture the demilitarised zone (DMZ) in the formerly Syrian-controlled Golan. It has since expanded its presence in Syria beyond the DMZ, generating friction with local civilians. Further, in a campaign that began as soon as Assad fell and which is still continuing in January 2025, Israel launched nearly 500 airstrikes against former regime assets throughout Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;all-eyes-on-rojava&quot;&gt;All Eyes on Rojava&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Turkey, Jordan, the US and Israel might cooperate in other areas, in Syria they are increasingly at loggerheads as they each jostle for influence. This is not just a case of stepping on each other’s toes; in many cases their interests are diametrically opposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in 2024, Turkey pursued a deal with the Syrian regime to launch a joint offensive against the SDF. When Assad proved too intransigent, Turkey lost patience and gave HTS the green light to launch an offensive of its own. Its achievements surpassed everyone’s expectations. But for Turkey, this was always a means to an end: its primary target was and remains regime change not in Damascus, but in Rojava. Because Turkey was forewarned of the HTS offensive, it exploited the situation to launch a simultaneous SNA offensive against the SDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what the US wants to prevent. So far, though, its mediation efforts between its warring allies have had mixed results. The impediment is that Turkey feels empowered by its recent successes and has adopted a hardline stance. The US convinced SDF troops to withdraw from the city of Manbij in exchange for a ceasefire with the SNA. Yet the SNA’s attacks sporadically continued. Since the ceasefire expired on 16 December, fighting has escalated, while SNA and Turkish troops have begun massing for another offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do HTS’s growing ties to Turkey mean that it, too, will go to war with the SDF? Al-Shara has previously stated that Kurds are “an integral part” of Syria and have nothing to fear from HTS. But HTS recently took the city of Deir Ezzour from the SDF after its formerly SDF-affiliated Arab militias defected to al-Shara’s group. HTS has supposedly been negotiating with the SDF over a long-term ceasefire. But each side’s demands show that no-one has any illusion about who is really talking to whom. HTS has demanded that the SDF withdraw from the border with Turkey and end its ties to the PKK. The SDF, in turn, wants Turkey to end its occupation of northern Syria. As such, HTS is less a mediator and more a conduit for the SDF to talk to Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if it remains neutral, a full-blown conflict in northern and eastern Syria will make HTS’s claims to represent all Syrians and to exert authority throughout the entire country look tenuous at best. It will face increasing pressure to back Turkey and the SNA. This will make it harder for Western countries, who are already suspicious of HTS, to engage with the group. Al-Shara will have to carefully balance these competing external and internal pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ones-to-watch-israel-russia-and-iran&quot;&gt;Ones to Watch: Israel, Russia and Iran&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In southern Syria, Israel is a “good neighbour” no more. Israel’s leaders initially claimed that its expanded occupation was temporary, whereas its strikes would target former regime chemical weapons and long-range missile facilities. These explanations are increasingly implausible. Israel has expanded its strikes to everything from airports to seaports. It has gone beyond the DMZ to occupy over 450 square kilometres of Syrian territory, including the al-Wahda dam, which supplies electricity to Syria, and the Yarmouk basin, a river which carries water to Jordan. It has also expelled Syrian civilians from their homes. The Golan is supposed to be Israel’s buffer zone. It is now demanding a buffer zone to protect its buffer zone, while its control of Yarmouk and al-Wahda will cause anxiety in Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks less and less like a prudent and preventative security measure. At best, it is a flawed attempt to mitigate instability that will only create more instability. At worst, it is a deliberate provocation. Al-Shara publicly stated that Syria has no desire to fight Israel; he even called for UN peacekeepers to return to the demilitarised zone. Israel, though, is having none of it. Jerusalem believes that the West is as naive as ever and that Al-Shara is a “wolf in sheep’s clothing”. Turkey’s ties to HTS might allay Western policymakers’ fears about the group’s Jihadist origins. But for Israel, the opposite is true, given its long-fraught relations with Turkey. This is one reason Jerusalem is acting so forcefully. It feels that the clock is ticking – Syria will soon become a Turkish protectorate, and Israel will lose its freedom of action – and so it is seeking to maximise its future agency by creating facts on the ground now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Russia and Iran are down, but not out in Syria. Supporting Assad was always a means to more important ends for both these powers. This is exemplified by Russia’s bases in Syria’s Tartus and Hmeimim. The former is a naval base that gives Russia its only access to the Mediterranean Sea. The latter serves as part of Moscow’s supply line for its forces and allies in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, all of which have recently adopted pro-Russian stances. Iran, in turn, maintained its unlikely friendship with the secular Assad regime primarily because it needed a land bridge to Hezbollah. Tehran values Hezbollah over Assad because the former has long held disproportionate influence over Lebanon and supposedly acts as a deterrent against Israel attacking Iran. While Assad has fled, Iran’s long-established and intricate network of weapons and drug smugglers has stayed put. Similarly, Russia hopes to keep its bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revolution against Assad was Syrian-led. Likewise, Syria is a Russo-Iranian protectorate no more. But that does not mean that Syria is free from foreign control, nor is it united. Instead, it is transitioning from Russian and Iranian hegemony to being “in play”. Turkey and HTS are currently on top, but they do not hold a monopoly on power. Multiple internal and external players have divergent and often competing interests inside the country. Everyone talks of Syrian unity, but beneath this rhetoric they all have their own, distinct visions for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syria is now occupied by at least three foreign powers: Turkey, Israel and the US. Turkey and Israel’s actions are destabilising. The US, by contrast, is trying to de-escalate a potential SNA/Turkish/SDF conflict, while tentatively engaging with HTS. But it must do more. It must convince or compel Israel to stop its strikes and cease expanding its occupation. It should also back a beefed-up UN presence in the DMZ and work with Jordan to get the SOR back on its feet in the area, so that Israel has no excuse for its actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump’s imminent return, however, does not bode well for Syria. It was his botched attempt to withdraw all US forces in 2019 that prompted Turkey to occupy northern Syria. It also allowed Russia to take over several US positions and cultivate ties to the SDF. Trump has recently claimed that Syria is “not our fight”; he later suggested that Turkey should “rule” the country. Vice President-elect JD Vance has argued that the US should withdraw from the Middle East and let Israel “police” the region. But police are supposed to defend the status quo. In Syria, Turkey and Israel are not only revisionists, but also increasingly see each other as a threat. Furthermore, Islamic State has recently exploited the chaos to increase its activity in Syria, and it still has 50,000 former members in SDF jails. The group will surely exploit any SDF collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the fight against Assad is over, but the battles over who controls Syria and what the country will look like are only just beginning. It is unreasonable to believe the US could stay out of this, particularly given that it is one of the only (and perhaps the only) external force that is currently trying to de-escalate tensions and promote post-conflict reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中稱西方國家開始明白到有一個「敵人」，而該「敵人」驅使西方重新研究和檢視過往政策有何問題（but all of a sudden they realise there’s an enemy, and that enemy energised the whole west to restudy and to recheck, you know, what they have gone wrong.）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上稱，他口中的「敵人」是指中國，惟他否認提倡西方國家重新考慮對華政策，強調他只是陳述事實，即西方國家開始醒覺他們的過往政策缺乏價值和道德面向，只顧及賺錢和貿易，現在他們知道出錯。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦否認在節目中提倡西方國家在特朗普的領導之下聯手，他稱只是說出事實，西方國家明白到不能夠單獨與中國進行槓桿效應（leverage against China），而是要聯合起來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中比較特朗普和拜登，指特朗普較務實，知道如何與中國交往，「我們要採取強硬態度（play hardball）」。黎庭上否認提倡特朗普採取強硬態度，上述言論只是他在節目中形容特朗普的方式，「我認為特朗普一直都這樣做，我沒有什麼可以提倡的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;節目稱台灣若跟美政策將成獨特國家-黎否認鼓吹台獨&quot;&gt;節目稱台灣若跟美政策將成「獨特國家」 黎否認鼓吹台獨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在節目中提到美國禁止向中國輸出晶片技術是正確做法，歐洲國家需跟隨美國的制裁政策，以確保得到美國的技術。當所有國家都制裁中國時，中國的科技發展便會很困難。黎指台灣在晶片技術上有重要地位，美國對台灣的關注和保護是很重要，又指台灣透過與美國建交，將會成為一個「很獨特的國家」（I think Taiwan will be a very unique country, you know, going forward, you know, what is happening is that Taiwan is creating a country through the relationship with the U.S. to becoming its future），因此他希望台灣能夠進取地跟隨美國的政策，過往台灣害怕與美國走得太近會得罪中國或中共，但是現在台灣得到美國的強大支持，尤其是軍事上，台灣應該有更大的信心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何形容台灣為「國家」，黎表示他的意思並不是指台灣是一個主權國家，承認在節目中應該使用其他字眼，但他否認鼓吹台灣獨立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰追問，黎剛才否認鼓吹台灣是一個主權國家，但是他卻在節目中說台灣會成為一個「獨特的國家」，問黎的言論是什麼意思。黎則解釋，台灣過往不願意跟隨美國的政策，但是如果台灣夠進取跟隨美國的政策的話，美國會提升（upgrade）與台灣的關係，而台灣在未來將會成為一個更強大的國家。杜官追問黎在這裡亦稱呼台灣為「國家」。黎強調，他已兩度說過台灣不能夠成為一個主權國家，使用「國家」字眼只是他說話的方式，他繼而表示會轉用「地方」一字。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指不能夠使中國與世界完全脫鈎&quot;&gt;黎指不能夠使中國與世界完全脫鈎&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中表示，中美打仗的機會不大，但是會有冷戰，即是在貿易、科技和外交方面會脫鈎，但他認為不能夠使中國與世界完全脫鈎。黎庭上指美國在貿易和科技上已經與中國脫鈎，但是在外交上未脫鈎。至於為何不能夠使中國與世界完全脫鈎，黎指因為中國非常龐大，世界仍然需要與中國交往。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到黎信奉自由市場，問他這種信念從何而來。黎稱從諾貝爾經濟學獎得主海耶克（Friedrich Hayek）得知相關概念，並稱15年來一直有閱讀他的著作。黎又稱，他在香港得到的經驗是奉行自由市場，自己亦從中得益，而這種經驗使他能夠明白海耶克的理論，因而相信它。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指蔡惠民立場親中試圖剝奪教會自由&quot;&gt;黎指蔡惠民立場「親中」、試圖剝奪教會自由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年10月8日播出的節目「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」，邀請天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機擔任嘉賓。陳日君在節目中提及「蔡神父」，黎形容他立場「親中」。被問到誰是「蔡神父」，黎指蔡很大機會成為香港教區主教，然而基於他的立場，很多教會中人反對他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎為何形容蔡為「親中」。黎則稱這是「教會內的普遍認知」，指蔡「不准說這樣、不准說那樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前庭上提及2020年9月29日的Twitter帖文，黎轉載陳日君樞機前往梵蒂岡反對任命蔡惠民神父為香港教區主教的新聞，並在帖文寫道：「雖然陳日君樞機知道成事的機會很微，但是他依然乘搭長途機前往梵蒂岡，與邪惡對戰（儘管他有88歲之齡）他是真正的英雄！（Although @CardJosephZen knew there was only a very slim chance of success, he still took a long flight to the Vatican to fight against evil (despite his old age of 88.) He is a true hero!）」杜官當時質疑黎使用「邪惡」一詞，卻未能說出有什麼邪惡之處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎今在庭上確認，他們在節目中談及的蔡惠民神父，與Twitter中提及的人是同一人。黎指，蔡透過討好中國，試圖剝奪教會的自由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問黎，這是否Twitter帖文中所指的「邪惡」？黎同意。辯方問黎是否認識蔡神父。黎則表示他知道蔡是誰，但是二人私下並不相識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指習近平是獨裁者-非被選卻控制整個國家&quot;&gt;黎指習近平是獨裁者 非被選卻控制整個國家&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，同案被告、「從犯證人」之一陳梓華在2020年10月10日被警方以「協助罪犯」罪名拘捕。黎稱當時並不知道，其後李柱銘告知他相關消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年10月11日，黎的個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」發表文章〈台灣也要感謝黨〉。當中提到：「不宣布獨立不等於台灣不能提升其國際地位。從目前的情況看來，美國與台灣實質建交和軍事緊密合作，雖然有實無名，如同主權國家的關系指日可待。在美國的領導下，西方陣營和日本澳洲等國家會逐漸提升與台灣的政治和貿易關系，同時建立日澳印台區域軍事合作，和最後推動台灣成為聯合國成員。」黎否認意圖透過上述段落，激使讀者不守法及以非法手段改變香港的現有制度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指出「美國與台灣實質建交和軍事緊密合作，雖然有實無名，如同主權國家的關系指日可待」一句，問黎是否在鼓勵美國和台灣緊密合作。黎則否認在鼓勵，反稱只是陳述正在發生的事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章稱，中美兩國會設法找下台階解決問題，以避免戰爭，「然而，在習近平戰狼心態驅使下，五毛愛國民情洶湧失控，而政治形勢比人強，獨裁者亡命凶狠孤注一擲的可能性還是有的。」被問到「獨裁者」所指是誰人，黎指習近平。被問到為何說習是獨裁者，黎僅說：「他是一個獨裁者。」辯方追問黎有何基礎。黎則指習並非被人們選出來，但是他卻控制著整個國家，「他說什麼，別人都要照做。（What he says goes）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章最後提到：「台灣得以走上世界政治貿易舞台，成就亞洲科技研發領先地位。各國科技精英趨之若鶩，國際科技熱錢湧入，壯大台灣經濟政治全面發展。這全都有賴習近平君臨天下戰狼姿態，領導『人類命運共同體』的野心嚇怕了全世界。台灣人民非但不應仇視習大大反該向他說聲『謝謝』才對！」黎否認上述段落意圖引起對中央領導人的憎恨和不滿，因他在說中國對台灣而言做了好事，「這裡沒有仇恨的跡象。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎在節目指阻止中美戰爭唯一辦法是美國威脅發動戰爭準備作戰&quot;&gt;黎在節目指阻止中美戰爭唯一辦法是美國威脅發動戰爭、準備作戰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年10月15日「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」的對話謄本，該次節目嘉賓為美國國防部前副部長 Paul Wolfowitz。黎認為相比起以前的韓國，現時台灣對於美國而言有更重要的戰略地位，他問Paul 認為美國會否汲取韓戰的教訓，會願意展示軍事實力（will be willing to show military might），以制止中國到達發動戰爭的邊緣。黎其後指，如果美國不想與中國打仗的話，唯一辦法就是威脅發動戰爭、準備作戰，使中國不能夠真的發動一個戰爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎認為美國會否展示軍事實力。黎認為美國會展示軍事實力，以阻止戰爭發生。他又指，有比喻指「準備戰爭能夠停止戰爭」，以往美國未準備好戰爭，導致韓國發生了戰爭，現在美國知道需要展示軍事實力，以阻止戰爭發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否在節目中提倡以威脅戰爭的手段來阻止戰爭？黎否認，稱只是回應 Paul Wolfowitz 文章的觀點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認提倡繼續在晶片範疇上制裁中國&quot;&gt;黎否認提倡繼續在晶片範疇上制裁中國&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在節目中，黎指在晶片技術方面對中國實施制裁是十分有效，能對中國科技發展和經濟造成損害，因為一個國家不能在孤立無援之下發展科技發展，必需依靠其他人補足。他指美國維持台灣在晶片發展方面的地位，以及透過制裁中國來保護台灣是很重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎是否提倡繼續在晶片範疇上制裁中國，以維持台灣的地位？黎否認，稱只是說制裁會損害中國的科技發展，而他在節目中只是說出已經發生的事情。至於為何會使用「制裁」字眼，黎則稱不知道為何這裡出現「制裁」字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎否認提倡中美戰爭-反稱談論避免戰爭&quot;&gt;黎否認提倡中美戰爭 反稱談論避免戰爭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中續指，美國的軍事實力超越中國，若果雙方開戰的話，中國只能夠製造一些「麻煩」，例如傷亡或對台灣人造成災難，但中國知道自己必定會輸，他們不會愚蠢到發動戰爭。黎又指，習近平南下檢閱海軍部隊，展示準備作戰的姿態，顯示他們真的不想戰爭發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上被問到是否提倡戰爭，他否認並反稱在節目中只是談論避免戰爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎同意國際社會替12港人發聲屬干預中國內部事務&quot;&gt;黎同意國際社會替「12港人」發聲屬干預中國內部事務&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中另提到被中國水警截獲及扣留的「12港人」，指香港人可以做的事情有限，只能引起國際對「12港人」的關注，而國際社會發聲是很重要。黎在庭上同意，如果國際社會替「12港人」發聲，也屬於干預中國內部事務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示 Slack 通訊群組「港蘋報紙對話」紀錄，2020年10月16日的會議紀錄顯示，其中一項建議為「直播新聞會加頭條新聞（曾志豪、王喜），評論（如桑普、盧峯），連儂牆（廣告）」。辯方指根據黎的證供，他曾跟張劍虹討論，張指桑普主張港獨，故《蘋果》最後沒有邀請他撰文。辯方問黎為何該次會議提及邀請桑普？黎則稱不知道為何桑普再次出現，可能他事前被警告不要在節目中提及港獨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is growing in confidence. Although sustaining immense costs, it has regained the initiative on the Ukrainian front. Simultaneously, its “active measures” campaigns to influence and disrupt the West have increased in intensity, including arson, bombings and attempted assassinations. Ken McCallum, Director General of MI5, gave a press conference in which he announced the Kremlin’s security services had “gone feral” and were seeking “sustained mayhem” on the streets of the UK and other European countries. Closer to the Kremlin’s borders, investigative journalists have noted increased reconnaissance activity around Kaliningrad (a Russian enclave between Poland and the Baltic states) and the wider region. Concurrently, the election of Donald Trump is likely to be accompanied by a strategic desire by the US to have European partners share more of the security burden. This is likely to be further fuelled by his reported perception (which is not unjust) that European allies have been taking advantage of the US and have grown too relaxed about their own security. This has raised concerns that the Kremlin will attempt to take advantage. Against this backdrop, Denmark’s defence minister has remarked that the Kremlin may “test” a NATO country within 3–5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to NATO’s Article V, “an attack on one is an attack on all”, and therefore a test against any member is a test of NATO’s core concept of collective defence. This raises the crucial question: how might the Kremlin test NATO’s collective defence? This article, complemented by brief interviews with Lt Gen (retired) Sir Rob Fry and Professor Mark Galeotti, will seek to answer this question through the use of the 5WH format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What form would this test take?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where would it occur?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why would the Kremlin pursue this action or target?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Who would conduct it?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When would the test(s) take place?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How will these operations be conducted?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is the easiest to answer. Even before it had been heavily degraded by the invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin could not match the combined forces of NATO; it must therefore avoid a direct confrontation. Therefore, any initial actions prior to a direct offensive are likely to be irregular. As Sir Rob Fry surmises:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If there was an overt action, the response would have to be decisive as it would be the first test. The boundaries will be tested from below. So long as they are insidious, the risk is lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second easiest to break down is “where”. This article will break down the warfighting domains of Land, Air, Sea, Space and Cyber and outline possible locations, then answer why, who and how across each domain according to Kremlin irregular doctrine and observed methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;land&quot;&gt;Land&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oldest domain of warfare has seen significant developments over the past decade. Today, less manpower, time and money are needed to have a great effect, offering significant sub-threshold opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where:&lt;/strong&gt; It is said that in warfare, “amateurs talk tactics, experts talk logistics” – making military bases and logistical points (such as transport links and arms depots) the best strategic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why:&lt;/strong&gt; Ukraine’s war effort has demonstrated the primacy of logistics in operational effectiveness. By targeting military bases and logistical hubs, the Kremlin could disrupt supply chains, weaken operational capabilities and diminish troop readiness. This would undermine enemy resilience, forcing delays and reducing the effectiveness of military campaigns, thus further diminishing the risk appetite among NATO members in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By targeting military bases and logistical hubs, the Kremlin could disrupt supply chains, weaken operational capabilities and diminish troop readiness&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who:&lt;/strong&gt; Kremlin special services would have greater influence and reach in eastern Europe. In Western Europe, however, where the Kremlin’s security services have been diminished, there is evidence of a rise in single-use proxies and outsourcing to criminal organisations, with Professor Galeotti noting that their use in modern Kremlin statecraft has become more common. Most of these seem to have been financially motivated. However, Sir Rob Fry points to increasing polarisation in the West as an added potential motivator for recruitment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a new radicalism in Europe and the West on both the left and the right due to Gaza and the disintegration of society that can be recruited. An agent of conviction is worth half a dozen paid agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Localised recruitment, although less reliable than professionally trained teams, has the benefit of ambiguity that the Kremlin can exploit in order to profess denial. Locals are also more likely to be familiar with the operational environment and thus to go unnoticed until the late stages of planning or after the operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How:&lt;/strong&gt; Kremlin sabotage doctrine and recent operations suggest that arson and bombings, potentially complemented by insider threats, are the preferred methods. The 2014 sabotage of a Czech Arms Depot containing weaponry intended for Ukraine, killing two people and causing evacuations, serves as a case study. More recently, there have been arson attacks in Western Europe. These operations have the potential to cause further disruption and degradation over time via the diversion of resources towards enhanced security measures. This in effect creates “weaponised inconvenience”, according to Professor Galeotti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air&quot;&gt;Air&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Air domain has evolved from the rudimentary reconnaissance planes of the First World War to modern technology like jets, stealth aircraft, and drones, bringing precision and strategic dominance to the air – especially when paired with electronic warfare (EW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where:&lt;/strong&gt; Aircraft seem an obvious target, and there are concerns around the attempted sabotage of cargo airliners by the Kremlin as a “dry run”. However, radar installations would be a target of more significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why:&lt;/strong&gt; Radar instillations have proven critical in past conflicts. They provide real-time detection and tracking of airborne threats to ensure early warning and swift responses, allowing for coordination of defence and protection of valuable assets. Damaging them, and NATO’s subsequent inability to defend the Air domain, would likely shape policymakers’ response to Kremlin aggression in other domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who:&lt;/strong&gt; Sir Rob Fry argues that due to the competencies required to operate in the Air and Sea domains, attacks in these domains would be easier to attribute, potentially altering the Kremlin’s risk calculus – why risk discovery of EW capabilties for limited payoff? However, while EW cannot be easily outsourced, the conflict in Ukraine has demonstrated the use of small drones as a potential solution to this problem of attribution, as they are easily used by proxies with a low skill threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How:&lt;/strong&gt; An effective strategy would likely utilise specialised services for EW while outsourcing the use of small drones to local proxies. There have already been instances of drones flying over US bases in the UK and significant disruption to airports from drone incursions, alongside the jamming of aircraft. If intensified with jamming followed by explosive drones and guided to strategic targets like radar, this could result in long-term degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sea&quot;&gt;Sea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maritime domain is vital for security and prosperity – ensuring trade, dominating critical shore territory, and defending chokepoints. It continues to expand, however, especially due to the increased capability for deepwater operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite many strategic targets sitting above the waterline, those on which a strike would cause maximum effect without war sit on the sea floor – specifically, communication cables and energy pipelines. Concerns about these potential targets have risen significantly since the destruction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, demonstrating the relative ease with which cables and pipelines can be targeted, especially in the Baltic Sea with its shallower waters. To be considered a significant test, multiple cables and pipelines would need to be destroyed at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why:&lt;/strong&gt; Undersea cables are critical to data traffic, with an estimated 95% of the world’s data going through them. Damage would disrupt and degrade communications, financial transactions, and other critical services in addition to energy, creating shortages and price rises that would result in societal instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who:&lt;/strong&gt; Activities such as these require professional training. Consequently, it is likely that the Kremlin would rely on organisations such as GUGI – the Main Directorate of Deep-Sea Research – with its divers and specialist deep-sea submarines. While this reduces deniability, the purpose of sub-threshold operations creates the necessary ambiguity to frustrate policymaking; would NATO risk war over energy and data infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How:&lt;/strong&gt; Recent activities have provided an indication of how these actions can be carried out with remotely operated drones, mines or divers with specialist tools – likely launched from Kaliningrad, the home of Russia’s Baltic Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;space&quot;&gt;Space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, originally used for surveillance, communication and targeting, has evolved, with states now equipped with anti-satellite weapons and defensive capabilities to secure strategic assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where:&lt;/strong&gt; Based on the weapons available to the Kremlin and space-related critical infrastructure, any operations would be undertaken in geosynchronous orbit, where there are satellites for telecommunications and observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why:&lt;/strong&gt; Recent Russian military doctrine has emphasised the importance of information dominance in warfare, including information infrastructure. This makes space assets – with their capacity for storing and transmitting data – valuable targets, as their destruction could disrupt communications and intelligence-gathering capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who:&lt;/strong&gt; Unsurprisingly, this would require not just professional experience but significant resources, meaning any operation in Space would almost certainly be conducted by the Aerospace Forces of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How:&lt;/strong&gt; One option would be direct-ascent anti-satellite missiles, designed to destroy satellites and create substantial “space junk” that could cause further surrounding damage. Another would be a weapon that releases radiation, frying satellite signals. However, the damage such operations would cause cannot be regarded as limited and could not be deniable; it would cause vast disruption and degradation of NATO states’ capabilities (as well as those of other non-aligned states), including a breakdown of comms and online services that could only serve to benefit an irreversible state of hostility. Consequently, Sir Rob Fry surmises that “this would not be a test. It would be the first act in a large-scale conflict”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyber&quot;&gt;Cyber&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In kinetic warfare, cyber continues to be seen as a force-multiplier rather than a standalone force. It was only officially recognised as a fifth domain by NATO in 2016. But as a facet of sub-threshold operations, it has become one of the most ubiquitous tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Geopolitical competition increasingly takes place in the information domain. The Kremlin recognises this and will almost certainly utilise subversion as its primary weapon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where:&lt;/strong&gt; The connectivity of the modern world provides multiple targets. Professor Galeotti goes as far as to argue that “we may need to lose the idea of cyber as a separate domain, because everything is cyber”. Transportation, finance, energy, and government and military communications are just a few facets of society that are at risk, but a large-scale attack on healthcare would be considered a test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why:&lt;/strong&gt; The immediate effects of disrupting healthcare would be panic, with repeated and prolonged outages leading to loss of life. Second-order effects would include weakening trust in institutions, causing further long-term degradation to resilience. Both would benefit the Kremlin by forcing states to focus on internal damage control rather than Kremlin aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who:&lt;/strong&gt; In Putin’s Russia, the lines between criminal hackers and government cyber actors are heavily blurred. The regime tolerates criminal groups provided that they target outside of Russia, while also maintaining significant cyber capabilities of its own. Therefore, the choice of actor would depend less on capability and more on the target and desired level of ambiguity. A mass attack on healthcare would almost certainly be carried out by criminal proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How:&lt;/strong&gt; The most dangerous form of attack would be a “zero-day exploit” – targeting a vulnerability in a system that is unknown. However, this can only be done once, and would likely be saved for war. A Distributed Denial of Service attack is more likely, overwhelming multiple target servers or networks with massive traffic and causing a crash. Another option is ransomware, which encrypts a target’s data and demands payment for decryption. These are typically conducted via phishing links clicked on by unsuspecting members of the target organisation – demonstrating that in the cyber domain, it is people who are the biggest vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cognitive-the-sixth-domain&quot;&gt;Cognitive: The Sixth Domain?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evgeny Messner, a former Tsarist officer considered a “godfather of subversion warfare” whose work is experiencing a revival in Russia, remarked that “the ultimate benefit of any military action is its psychological impact on the enemy”. The scenarios suggested would have a similar impact on policymakers and populations, conveying an image of an all-powerful and insidious Kremlin. Professor Galeotti notes that “the outcome is political, not operational” and that “the irony is that the psychological impact is greater than the physical”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geopolitical competition increasingly takes place in the information domain. The Kremlin recognises this and will almost certainly utilise subversion as its primary weapon, using disinformation to turn societal divides into fissures, undermine trust in the government and institutions, enforce the concept that truth is unknowable, create panic with false alarms, and cultivate a perception that supporting NATO’s Article V would be risking a Third World War. Artificial intelligence and recruitment of local actors further lower the threshold for these operations and increase their authenticity, reach and potential impact on behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When could these activities take place? While the Kremlin currenly conducts many sub-threshold operations, according to Sir Rob Fry, we can expect an operational pause before a significant test. Likewise, Professor Galeotti suggests that “the smart money is on eight years for reconstitution” (i.e. when the Kremlin would be prepared for a significant kinetic struggle). However, we will almost certainly see other “dry runs” to maintain the initiative and potentially prepare for more significant operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Kremlin will need a period to restock and reconsolidate, easing stresses on the economy and implementing doctrinal lessons from Ukraine. But you need to keep the pot boiling, and ambiguous warfare can fill the gap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-sir-rob-fry&quot;&gt;– Sir Rob Fry&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From Putin’s point of view, Ukraine is not just about Ukraine. He will continue to see the West as hostile and the response is not just about disruption, but to demonstrate to it that its support for Ukraine [in effect responding to Kremlin aggression] has consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-professor-galeotti&quot;&gt;– Professor Galeotti&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these scenarios are guaranteed, nor are they exhaustive; this would require study by a range of subject-matter experts across all the domains cited. However, one of the underlying issues contributing to the greatest defence failures of the modern age – 9/11, the full-scale Invasion of Ukraine, 7 October – was “a failure of imagination”. It’s time to start thinking and forming responses now, before a Kremlin-sponsored situation in a NATO member state is added to this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2024, RUSI’s Centre for Finance and Security (CFS) and RUSI Europe, together with the Stockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies (SCEEUS) and with the support of the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, organised a roundtable discussion about strategies for effective sanctions on Belarus. The discussion took place at the premises of the European Endowment for Democracy in Brussels. It gathered public officials from the European Commission and the UK, as well as experts from Belarus and Central and Eastern Europe. The event was held as part of the Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet), led by CFS and supported by the National Endowment for Democracy. This report is based on the unattributable contributions of the roundtable participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background-belarus-sanctions-to-date&quot;&gt;Background: Belarus Sanctions to Date&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sanctions against Belarus adopted by Western countries include both designations of individuals and restrictive economic measures. While the sanctions on Belarus are closely intertwined with Russian sanctions regimes, both politically and from the perspective of enforcement, they must be examined separately, especially since their aims and targets are distinct; the initial wave of sanctions on Belarus predated Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first extensive Western sanctions on Belarus were adopted in 2020, following the Belarusian elections of August 2020, which were characterised by widespread fraud and violent action by the government. Western powers did not recognise the results announced by the authorities and condemned the falsification of the results and violence against peaceful protesters. The first package targeted individuals responsible for repression and election falsification; this was followed by additional designations, with a strong focus on human rights violations. Another round of EU sanctions was adopted in 2021 when a scheduled Athens–Vilnius Ryanair flight was diverted to Minsk airport in order to capture and imprison Belarusian dissident Roman Protasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega. Additional EU designations in December 2021 included individuals and entities responsible for the instrumentalisation of migrants for political purposes at the EU’s external border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Western powers extended their restrictive measures against Belarus. The regime supported Russia’s illegal invasion in a number of ways: Belarus’ territory and airspace were used by Russian troops and for rocket launches, and many Belarusian companies supply the Russian military industrial sector. Western powers have designated several entities for their involvement in Russia’s war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2022, the scope of economic restrictions has been gradually broadened, adopted in a series of separate decisions. Similarly to the situation for Russian sanctions, while there is a broad alignment on the policy goals of “likeminded” countries and there is strong coordination, specific measures and the list of designated individuals differ between Western nations. Also, Russian and Belarusian sectoral sanctions have not been fully aligned, which has resulted in loopholes. Since there is a customs union between Belarus and Russia and both countries have made significant efforts to circumvent Western sanctions, operators and authorities have had limited success in enforcing trade restrictions, including of dual-use goods. In the summer of 2024, new measures were adopted by the EU in an attempt to align Russian and Belarusian sanctions to curb such circumvention routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countries bordering Belarus (Latvia, Lithuania and Poland) have also adopted some specific national measures, often adopted before and going beyond the scope of EU-wide decisions. There is also extended cooperation between customs authorities of the Baltic states, Poland and Finland. Measures include specific restrictions on the import of agricultural products, even those for personal consumption. The situation on the border has often been a contentious topic. Belarus has reacted with a number of countermeasures, including certain agricultural import bans from the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While official cooperation with Belarus has been scaled down, Western powers and governments continue to support the Belarusian people, including by providing financial and other supports for Belarusian civil society and members of the democratic opposition. Western powers have signalled their continuous support for victims of the repression, through both direct and indirect channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-goals-of-the-sanctions&quot;&gt;The Goals of the Sanctions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants at the roundtable discussed the potential goals of and theory of change behind sanctions on Belarus. Both European public officials and experts from Belarus mentioned that some of the “traditional” end goals of sanctions policies, such as a regime change or behavioural change, are not realistic in the case of Belarus at this stage. It is no longer possible, as it might have been 10–15 years ago, to expect less repression from the regime or a weakening of its ties to Russia as a consequence of sanctions. The regime has decided to tie itself increasingly to Russia and acts, participants agreed, as its client state. One participant doubted whether Belarus could distance itself from Russia “even if [Belarusian leader Alexander] Lukashenka dies tomorrow”. Another point made was that Minsk’s role should be treated as more than just a regional problem: Belarus’s actions are also supporting the interests of China, North Korea and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constraining the regime is a more realistic goal. Participants agreed that some of the constraints, particularly on the economy, are visible in Belarus, unlike the situation in 2014, when sanctions were adopted by Western countries following Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea; one participant said those sanctions were so ineffective that they were “almost forgotten”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A public official at the roundtable explained that sanctions have traditionally had an important signalling role towards various audiences, even if the economic impact was limited. Sanctions designations are not only messages aimed at the targeted individuals and elites, but also messages of support to opposition groups from that country (regardless of whether they are inside or outside the country). Third countries are also part of the target audience, as sanctions constitute an important signal about norms and values; they also serve as a stigmatising tool, another participant added. There has been, however, a shift in the public perception of sanctions since Russia’s full-scale invasion, and the Western public expects to see some concrete results. A public official emphasised that the question of whether sanctions work does not have a yes-or-no answer. “Sanctions are a marathon, not a sprint”, they explained, adding that the longer-term consequences of sanctions on both Belarus and Russia are, arguably, only now starting to be visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant emphasised that sanctions are inflicting extra costs on Belarus and Russia: Russia spends resources to limit the sanctions’ effect on Belarus by direct financial support, and costs are also rising for sanctioned entities and sectors. This means the two countries have less to spend on the war effort. Another participant stated that to measure the effectiveness of sanctions, it is important to ask whether the actions limit the regime’s ability to continue its aggressive and repressive behaviour. Points were also raised by participants regarding the lack of consistency of enforcement, which hinders the effectiveness of the sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-of-sanctions-on-the-economy-of-belarus&quot;&gt;The Impact of Sanctions on the Economy of Belarus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants remarked that their economic modelling showed that the effect of sanctions on Belarus could have been up to 10% of GDP loss; in real terms, the effect was a loss of around 4.5% of GDP. Multiple participants explained that Russia has been compensating for these losses, through direct compensations, the opening of the Russian market, and more extensive use of infrastructure and logistics for Belarusian companies, which may be the reason for an effect lower than expected. Exports from Belarus in certain sectors now reach the global markets via Russia. Railways, ports and other Russian infrastructure are necessary to this end, but this raises the costs and lowers the profit margins. A participant from Belarus called the situation “an economic war of attrition”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants cited other economic estimates showing that, without sanctions, the Belarusian economy would have grown approximately 1.5% annually, which translates into an accumulated loss of 12% by 2024. However, they pointed out that Russia has been able to compensate for part of this loss, potentially accounting for 3–5% of GDP. Participants agreed that Belarus is also increasingly dependent on Russia in terms of energy and the financial sector: the economy of Belarus is not competitive without cheap Russian energy. Some participants from Belarus questioned the possibility of Belarus distancing itself from Russia even if it wanted to. They pointed out that Belarus earns significant revenues by supporting Russia’s war machine with its industrial production capacity, with some factories working three shifts a day to serve the Russian army’s needs. Points were raised about the difference between official economic data, which may have been manipulated, and the reality of the shadow economy, about which we have no available information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some participants noted that sanctions have unintended adverse consequences, such as eroding the economic base of the pro-democracy middle class and benefiting those who are closer to the regime. According to participants, certain groups and individuals can also enrich themselves by providing logistical, financial or other services in the sectors impacted by sanctions. Artificial government trade monopolies have also emerged to provide access to certain goods or services, including those which cannot be imported to Belarus due to their counter-sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants also mentioned that many citizens in Belarus feel the negative consequences of the sanctions and counter-sanctions. While specific national measures by the Baltic states or Poland might be popular in those countries – one participant called some of the restrictions “populist policies” – in practice, they may alienate those Belarusians who oppose Lukashenka’s regime. The ban by the Baltic states on using cars with Belarusian number plates was cited as an example. A Belarusian participant added that food export restrictions cause frustration for citizens at the border who only possess food for personal use, while the restrictions have no impact on the regime’s financial and political means. Also discussed were the regime’s strategic communications and how they frame sanctions and counter-sanctions in the same way, leading citizens to attribute the negative consequences of both to Western powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-sanctions&quot;&gt;Financial Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no clear agreement at the roundtable about the impact of sanctions on the Belarusian financial sector. However, several participants highlighted that it is almost impossible to make financial settlements or any transfers between the EU and Belarus, which has a negative effect on citizens, including dissidents, and as such may even strengthen Lukashenka’s regime. Several participants argued that allowing capital outflow could actually weaken the regime’s financial opportunities, whereas restrictions keep the capital available for the regime. While the source of such capital might be “dirty”, which is why Western countries wish to avoid contact with it, the capital leaving the country would be a significant loss for the regime, according to one participant from Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants recalled that there had been a time lag between the announcement of sanctions on banks from Belarus – including the Central Bank – and the implementation of the measures. This allowed Belarus to prepare for restrictive measures and build up the necessary alternative channels through Russia. Similarly, the closing of access for some Belarusian banks to the SWIFT messaging system was widely anticipated, according to one participant, and banks prepared for such a step well in advance. Since financial connections to European countries were not particularly extensive before the sanctions, and Belarus’ financial system was not dependent on Western European institutions, it was able to reconfigure such links. Despite these restrictions, participants pointed out that the financial system of Belarus is not entirely closed to global networks today, with Russia and China offering international financial access. Furthermore, other countries, such as Georgia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, have emerged as financial intermediaries, according to some participants. Targeted measures against such intermediaries and extraterritorial sanctions were proposed as potential responses, but they were not supported by all participants, given that such measures would have an impact on dissidents and pro-democracy forces, as well as on beneficiaries and supporters of the regime. The ban on supplying euro banknotes to Belarus was mentioned as a particular measure with serious unintended consequences: the ban had made it harder for Belarusian citizens to access their funds. The fact that possessing euro banknotes was illegal also gave the regime another route to crack down on some individuals of its choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of Lukashenka’s personal wealth and the so-called presidential funds is significant, according to multiple participants. Given their nature, there is limited information about these resources, particularly as parts of them are held in offshore jurisdictions. Some participants mentioned the role of countries in the Middle East as depositories for the regime. Lukashenka’s presidential funds are also used, according to a participant from Belarus, to directly pay for Lukashenka’s security apparatus. One participant added that the entire state apparatus is mobilised when the regime needs to react to new sanctions. There were diverging opinions regarding the impact of designations of individuals. Some participants stated that such action had limited impact, while others mentioned that the surprise element of some designations had been effective. Some participants called for sanctions on more individuals who are part of the Belarus business elite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants asserted that enforcement of individual sanction designations can be improved; one suggestion was that the entire chain of transactions should be investigated. However, the EU lacks, one participant explained, “investigative muscles”. As noted above, assets registered in offshore locations or in certain third countries are important for the regime and for its power. Since Russian sanctions are larger by an order of magnitude, investigations are focusing on Russian individuals and networks, while funds of the Belarusian elite can stay under the radar and “in Russia’s shadow”, as one participant put it. The recent legal changes to criminalise sanction violations at the EU level was mentioned as a step in the right direction, as criminal enforcement could make sanctions implementation more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trade-sanctions&quot;&gt;Trade Sanctions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant estimated that 70–80% of pre-sanctions trade between Belarus and the EU is now under some form of restriction. The largest impact has been achieved in those sectors which were not expected to fall under sanctions. According to one participant, Lukashenka “was caught off guard” when Lithuania banned potash imports. Multiple participants mentioned the impact of this ban on mining and fertiliser production, which was a major source of revenue for the Belarusian economy, prior to sanctions. One participant recalled how salaries of miners went down by 30–40%, and it took time to reorganise export routes. Following the initial shock in 2022, the export of potash went down to 60% of pre-sanction levels. Now it is back to pre-war production levels, according to estimates cited by participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s role in stepping in and helping Belarus after sanctions by Western powers was noted. For example, fertiliser exports still reach China via Russian railway connections, and important export destinations such as India and Brazil are reached through Russian ports. However, according to one participant, the World Bank estimates that the revenues for Belarus from potash dropped by 50%, and producers – most importantly, the leading potash producer, Belaruskali – cannot receive the full market price, due to Belaruskali’s weakened negotiating position and the rising costs for intermediaries and transportation. One participant said that Belaruskali used to be one of the most important Belarusian taxpayers, but the impact of sanctions means that it now requires subsidies from the state budget, including exemptions from export duties. Another participant recalled that before 2020, there was a global price cartel for potash, with Russia and Belarus maintaining higher prices. Together, they represented about a third of global production. While Belarus would probably like to see the return of this cartel, this was not viewed as likely in the current environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was noted, however, that these restrictive measures are based on product designations, not on sectors, so certain categories of fertilisers can still be exported from Belarus, and a modification of products could make trade possible. A Belarusian expert said that there is currently almost no import of Belarusian fertiliser to the EU. By contrast, participants mentioned that Belarusian oil export still provides revenues for the regime, with such export providing a good example of Belarus taking advantage of – and thus becoming increasingly reliant on – Russia’s infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants, both European public officials and experts from Belarus, recalled that restrictive measures concerning fertiliser exports had not been seen to have any impact on global food security. While there was an initial spike in the price of potash, prices were back to pre-sanctions levels at the time the roundtable was held. One participant recalled that shortly before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, restrictions were announced on potash being exported via Lithuanian ports, a move that led to substitute plans being made to use the Odesa port instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to participants, this has not stopped Putin and Lukashenka making claims that restrictions on fertiliser exports have weakened global food security; according to some participants, this propaganda has been echoed by the UN leadership multiple times. A European Commission official underlined that the threats to food security are caused not by the decrease of Belarusian fertiliser exports, but by war against Ukraine, particularly the decrease in grain export from Ukraine as a result of Russia’s full-scale invasion. They also noted that the EU has stepped up its effort to help Ukraine by facilitating grain exports through Poland and Romania. Even if experts in the field and certain countries are aware of the real causes of global food insecurity, the Russian narrative is stronger globally, and its communication more active and effective, according to participants. By contrast, the EU has not been successful enough in its strategic communication to counter this narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;border-closure&quot;&gt;Border Closure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation on the Polish border was also discussed at the roundtable. There was a disagreement about how the situation has changed since 2021, when the Belarus regime first organised the arrival at the Belarusian–Polish border of refugees from the Middle East. One participant said that the number of migrants significantly reduced after a meeting between Polish President Andrzej Duda and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and suggested that currently, arrivals at the border are less organised. Another participant claimed that migrants now arrive at the border with Russian visas, not with the help of the Belarusian regime, and mentioned the porous Russia–Belarus border and low-level corruption as enabling factors in the continuation of this migratory flow. A researcher said they had evidence to the contrary: more Belarus state actors are now involved in the process and the infrastructure used by migrants is organised by the Belarusian state, with migrants still a tool the regime uses in its foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several participants noted that while the complete closure of the Belarusian–Polish border would be politically popular in Poland, this would not solve the problem of the instrumentalisation of migration. Moreover, participants also noted that this border is an important trade corridor between China and the EU, and thus the closure of the railway that crosses from Belarus into the EU via Poland would have significant negative consequences for the EU, due to the disturbance of Chinese imports and reciprocal EU exports. By contrast, given the increasing integration of the Belarus economy with Russia, the effect on the regime in Belarus would not be as significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable on the effectiveness of sanctions on Belarus highlighted that the restrictive measures should aim at constraining the regime’s actions, including its actions of domestic oppression, the personal wealth of key state actors and the Belarusian elite, and its contribution to the aggression against Ukraine. While the effects of the current sanctions on the economy of Belarus are significant, Russia has helped to mitigate this impact, integrating Belarus more tightly into its own economy and taking advantage of Belarus’s industrial capacity to support its war in Ukraine. The export of fertilisers, most importantly potash, has had a serious impact on Belarus, but the discourse on the effect on global food security has been hijacked effectively by the strategic communications campaign of Belarus and Russia, despite not being factually correct. Several restrictions, such as the ban on financial transactions and the ban on cars entering the EU with Belarusian number plates, have serious unintended consequences for Belarusian citizens, including those who oppose the current regime. Participants proposed some potential further steps, such as: sanctions on oil exports; further designations of the Belarusian business elite, targeting the growing military–industrial links between Belarus and Russia; and better awareness raising and enforcement of existing Belarus sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, as one participant noted, sanctions on Belarus require much greater thought. They were originally designed to respond to the anti-democratic activity of the Lukashenka regime, but have now morphed into an appendage of the sanctions regime on Russia, engendered by its invasion of Ukraine. More thought needs to be given to the objectives – and theory of change – related to sanctions on Belarus, and how sanctions can be used to both support opposition activists and put pressure on the regime, while avoiding unintended consequences or driving Belarus even further into reliance on and the orbit of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK has maintained a consistent legal position on the status of Taiwan since 1972, when it recognised the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as the sole government of China and took the view that the future status of Taiwan would be a matter for the Chinese people to decide – including those in Taiwan. The UK’s approach over the past five decades has helped to reinforce an international status quo regarding Taiwan that has supported peace and stability between Taipei and Beijing, even if relations have at times been tense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s longstanding position is under pressure as the character of China–US relations has changed from engagement to competition, making Taiwan a flashpoint once more. This new situation means that previous approaches designed to support the status quo over Taiwan are losing effectiveness, while the risk of a major armed conflict is increasingly challenging the UK’s international interests. London, therefore, needs to consider recalibrating its practical engagement on the Taiwan issue in order to maintain its principled position that Taiwan’s status should be determined peacefully by the populations of Taiwan and the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article surveys the approach that the UK has taken to Taiwan, notably the policy that has been followed by London since the early 1970s. It examines the shifting security dynamics over the status of Taiwan, and critically the growing confrontation between China, the US, Taiwan and its regional allies, and identifies the risks that this represents to the UK and its position on Taiwan. An analysis of the evolving situation in respect to Taiwan, and notably the prospect of a major armed conflict as China seeks to coerce Taiwan by various means, indicates a growing threat to the economic, security and political interests of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK, nevertheless, has policy instruments available as a result of its Indo-Pacific “tilt”, announced as part of the Integrated Review of March 2021, that expand its range of options. Given the evolving situation, the UK should be ready to support the efforts of Taiwan and its international partners to build deterrence against China’s efforts to alter the status quo unilaterally through hybrid activities, and the threat – or even the use of – military force. Working together with allies and partners, the UK can reinforce deterrence through diplomacy, strategic communications, military and security policy, and by promoting Taiwanese economic security and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uks-policy-on-taiwan&quot;&gt;The UK’s Policy on Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since breaking off official relations with the Republic of China (ROC) In January 1950, the UK has not diplomatically recognised the ROC government, though informal diplomatic interactions have continued. The exchange of ambassadors with the PRC was delayed by the UK’s subsequent decision to withhold support for the Communist government taking the ROC’s UN seat. This changed in 1972 with the UK–PRC communique, which “acknowledging the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of the People’s Republic of China”, confirmed that the UK recognised the government of the PRC as the sole legal government of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official recognition of the PRC, alongside support for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan status issue by the Chinese people (including the population of Taiwan), has been the foundation of the UK’s legal approach to the Taiwan issue since the early 1970s, but approaches to achieving this policy – officially “long-standing” and “unchanged” – have shifted as the political context has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critically, the widening divergence in political systems across the Taiwan Strait that has developed since the end of the Cold War has increasingly cast doubt on the prospects for a peaceful and consensual resolution of the dispute over Taiwan. Decades after the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, the PRC remains resolutely undemocratic, while during the 1990s the ROC laid the foundations for an enduring and dynamic democratic system to emerge. The harsh imposition of “one China two systems” on Hong Kong from 2015 has reinforced concerns in the UK that Taiwan could expect little systemic divergence on being “restored” to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite not recognising the ROC diplomatically, the UK maintained a representative office in Taiwan under the name of “The British Trade and Cultural Office Taipei”. In 2015, the office was renamed “The British Office Taipei”, and the position of its head upgraded from “director-general” to “representative”. While maintaining a legal openness to unification, the UK’s policy has been to support the status quo over Taiwan, including to “regularly lobby in favour of Taiwan’s participation in international organisations where statehood is not a prerequisite…”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1972, UK policy was non-committal on the means of unification, viewing it as “China’s internal affair to be settled by the Chinese people themselves”. Half a century later, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly confirmed that “Britain’s longstanding position is that we want to see a peaceful settlement of the differences across the Strait… it’s essential that no party takes unilateral action to change the status quo” (italics added for emphasis). Following Taiwan’s January 2024 elections, then Foreign Secretary David Cameron stated that “I hope that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will renew efforts to resolve differences peacefully through constructive dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion”, suggesting that the UK government’s interpretation of “internal matter” has evolved to give greater weight to the interests and views of the population on Taiwan, and the distinctiveness of its political system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taiwans-growing-conflict-risk&quot;&gt;Taiwan’s Growing Conflict Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s position on the status of Taiwan was adopted during an era when the PRC’s capability to force unification by military means was relatively modest. China’s economic rise over recent decades has, however, seen a growing political focus on resolving the Taiwan issue and a commitment of resources to support this goal, including a massive military build-up. Beijing’s effort to shift the Taiwan status quo through various forms of pressure and the threat of military action has fed into a worsening regional security environment. China–US rivalry is deepening, raising the prospect of a major international confrontation, for which Taiwan would be the most likely trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Xi Jinping defines national “reunification” (absorbing Taiwan into the PRC) as a core interest linked to achieving the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation by 2049. The 2005 anti-secession law confirmed “non-peaceful means and other necessary measures” can be used if “possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted”. As seen from China’s response to the visit by US Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2021, and subsequent exercises in 2024, the PRC is normalising regular demonstrations of military force to apply psychological pressure on the Taiwanese population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of China’s efforts to advance unification, successive generations of Taiwanese are overwhelmingly and increasingly unwilling to support joining the PRC, and persist in electing governments representing that view. In response, the PRC continues to tighten its policy, reducing the degree of autonomy in descriptions of Taiwan’s post-unification status, and seeking to isolate Taiwan by persuading countries that recognise the ROC (Taiwan) to switch recognition to the PRC. In 2024, PRC officials confirmed new guidelines for the law targeting “die-hard ‘Taiwan independence’ separatists” (including current or former Taiwanese officials) to allow for the death penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The UK can best maintain its longstanding position on Taiwan’s status by joining with regional allies and partners to enhance deterrence as the most effective means to counter the drift towards crisis and war&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the first Trump administration, Washington’s China policy changed from “engagement” to competition, a posture extended throughout the Biden administration. The PRC leadership interprets the intention behind this policy, through actions like Biden’s October 2022 restrictions on advanced semiconductors, as nothing less than the sabotage of China’s development. The downturn in US–PRC relations, more than any other factor, is raising both the probability of a Taiwan crisis and its potential to escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift to open competition as the basis for US–China relations challenges the US policy of “strategic ambiguity” whereby, following the termination of its formal alliance with Taiwan in 1979, the US sought to prevent the non-peaceful resolution of the Taiwan status issue, without making a formal defence commitment to Taiwan. The “ambiguity” was intended to maintain stability across the Taiwan Strait by perpetuating doubt about the US’s willingness to prevent unilateral moves by either the PRC or the ROC to change the status quo (by invading or declaring independence, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Beijing, this policy was unwelcome, but to the extent that it worked to discourage formal independence, it was tolerable. The shift to strategic competition removes some of that comfort, because it fosters suspicion on the PRC side that the US will return to using Taiwan as a component of a military containment strategy (as was the case in the early Cold War).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While PRC sources indicate Beijing views Taiwan as “holding essential strategic and military value to China”, comments by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Ely Ratner lent weight to the perception that the US views Taiwan as integral to containing Chinese military influence. In public testimony in 2021, he explained its importance principally in terms of its position as an anchor for a network of US allies and partners “critical to the defense of vital US interests in the Indo-Pacific”. The Pentagon views the PRC as its “pacing challenge”, and believes “a Taiwan contingency is the pacing scenario”. Over the past four years, US President (and Commander in Chief) Biden broke with precedent, making repeated commitments to defend Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Beijing and Washington are clarifying their positions, the military balance around Taiwan is shifting in China’s favour. This raises the odds of the Chinese leadership gaining sufficient confidence to resolve the issue by force. US analysts believe the US military is stretched and not adequately provisioned to fight a war in the Taiwan Strait. There is, in particular, concern that the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) advanced missile and air defence capabilities would make it difficult to flow forces into the area quickly enough to prevent a fait accompli “decapitation” strike on the government in Taipei. While the problem of penetrating China’s anti-access/area denial bubble remains, the US will need to concentrate more effort on improving Taiwan’s own capability. Such support is designed to ensure that Taipei can resist a potential invasion long enough for US forces to overcome Chinese efforts to deny them access to the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his presidency, Biden authorised new arms sales and transfers of arms (at US taxpayer expense), and expanded training programmes that quadruple the number of US soldiers on the island. Even if the US intention is merely to enhance deterrence, Beijing may perceive larger numbers of US forces on Taiwan as a pretext for the US to invoke a “self-defence” justification to use force against the PLA if it attacks the island. The influential Chinese “expert” Jin Canrong (金灿荣) has written that unification by non-peaceful means is now more likely than the peaceful alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rising-stakes-for-the-uk&quot;&gt;The Rising Stakes for the UK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing tensions over Taiwan and the risks of a military confrontation are a threat to UK interests and a challenge to London’s longstanding position on the status issue. As then UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly set out in 2023, “A war across the Strait would not only be a human tragedy, it would destroy world trade worth $2.6 trillion… Distance would offer no protection from this catastrophic blow to the global economy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncertainties about a Taiwan conflict – how it would develop, how long it would endure, the risk of nuclear escalation, who would get involved, the possibility that it would catalyse conflicts elsewhere, and how long it could take for economic and other relations to return to normal after conflict termination – make a precise calculation of the “costs” of such a war difficult, but most agree that they could be substantial. Rhodium Group estimated the cost of a blockade to the global economy at over $2 trillion, but that is “before factoring in international responses or second-order effects”. This scenario assumes “a blockade of Taiwan by China that halts all trade between Taiwan and the rest of the world… [but] does not attempt to estimate the costs associated with additional disruptions from a military escalation or the imposition of international sanctions”. Bloomberg predicts a 10.2% global GDP decline (double the effect of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis or Covid-19), costing the global economy $10 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the economic shock of a war, the UK’s longstanding interest in upholding UN principles of international order – as a Security Council member duty and as a national interest – would be harmed by a conflict over Taiwan. The ROC’s loss of representation at the UN does not change the fact that an erosion of the principles of self-determination and the peaceful settlement of disputes could weaken restraints on other aggressors, which would be contrary to UK interests elsewhere. At the same time, the UK has repeatedly stated its support for democratic forms of government, of which Taiwan is a leading example. The Chinese Communist Party shows no sign of emulating the ROC’s political evolution, but developments across the Strait stand as a counterweight to the fallacy that Chinese culture and society is unsuited to a democratic system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a risk that a war over Taiwan could escalate into a regional war, threatening UK allies and partners – South Korea, Japan and the Philippines – while there is additionally concern that if Beijing is able to seize Taiwan, countries across the region would be increasingly vulnerable to China. A prominent former US defence official suggested unification would lead almost automatically to Chinese regional hegemony, and even worldwide domination. If this theory guides US policy, there is a strong likelihood that attempts to force unification would trigger war between the US and the PRC, with devastating consequences for UK national interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond humanitarian and economic impacts, the US would suffer major military losses regardless of which side prevails, with even a limited conventional war over Taiwan degrading US capacity for European defence. In the aftermath of a conflict, relations with China would remain hostile, forcing the US to concentrate its remaining capability and force regeneration in the Pacific at the expense of its contribution to European — including UK — security. There is also no guarantee that a China–US conflict would not escalate to nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the US backs down from legal or rhetorical commitments to Taiwan, or loses the war, this would call NATO’s credibility into question, inviting a challenge to European security that would a UK response. At the same time, the loss of credibility might destabilise the US alliance structure in the Indo-Pacific, a region to which the UK has come to see its security and prosperity as being “inextricably linked”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-need-to-recalibrate-the-uks-approach-to-taiwan&quot;&gt;The Need to Recalibrate the UK’s Approach to Taiwan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s exposure to a Taiwan crisis has increased in step with the growing importance of the Indo-Pacific for the national interest. In recent years, the UK has signalled a growing engagement in the region as the Indo-Pacific has developed as a major source of economic growth but also as a theatre for geopolitical competition. The “tilt” policy set out in the 2021 Integrated Review and 2023 “Refresh” committed a commensurate increase in UK diplomatic, trade and military presence in the region. The Royal Navy’s “persistent presence” in the region (currently two offshore patrol craft) will undergo a step change from 2027 or even earlier with rotational deployments of nuclear submarines, as agreed in the 2023 “optimal pathway” for the AUKUS agreement. Before then, the 2024 commitment to US–UK–Japan trilateral exercises will increase UK military presence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Labour government that took office in July 2024 included in the terms of reference for a defence review the parameter to “identify ways to maintain the UK’s defence ties to the Indo-Pacific region, the Gulf and the Middle East. The UK is committed to the delivery of the AUKUS partnership with the US and Australia”. Alongside these security commitments, the UK has joined the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement and sought to deepen its network of partnerships, highlighting its growing regional interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s increased military presence and heightened regional interests do not commit it to defend Taiwan in the event of a conflict. They do, however, elevate exposure to political and economic risk. The regular tempo of military deployments, with warfighting platforms like nuclear powered submarines or even a Carrier Strike Group (due to visit in 2025) appearing more regularly, will also raise questions about the UK commitment in the event of a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strengthening of UK interests in and linkages to a potential Taiwan crisis requires a careful balance in the UK approach. On the one hand, the threat of a “one China” outcome falls short of representing a direct “existential” threat for the UK, suggesting investments and risks taken to avert it should be capped accordingly. On the other hand, the prospect of a major confrontation over Taiwan constitutes a serious challenge to the UK’s regional and global interests. In the context of rising pressure on Taiwan and a regional military build-up, a UK posture that does not adapt is likely to be read as accommodating to Beijing’s demands, representing a de facto shift in the UK’s longstanding position opposing a change in the status quo that is contrary to the wishes of Taiwan’s population. An inference that the UK is hesitant to clarify its commitment could contribute to a sense in Beijing that Taiwan and the US are becoming more isolated, improving the odds of achieving its goal by force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the UK can best maintain its longstanding position on Taiwan’s status by joining with regional allies and partners to enhance deterrence as the most effective means to counter the drift towards crisis and war. To achieve this, the focus should be on intensifying efforts to manage tensions, discouraging aggressive actions by China, and strengthening measures to prevent escalation to war. Four distinct areas where the UK could contribute to strengthened deterrence are identified below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diplomatic-challenging-mischaracterisations-of-taiwans-status-and-uk-policy&quot;&gt;Diplomatic: Challenging Mischaracterisations of Taiwan’s Status and UK Policy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PRC is currently stepping up the “lawfare” and strategic communication strategy that it pursues to demoralise the Taiwanese people, minimise international support for Taiwan, and undermine Taiwan’s ability to operate internationally. One aspect of this is to assert that the 1971 UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 settles all issues related to Taiwan under international law. Another element of the strategy is Beijing’s effort to promote equivalence between its own “One China” Principle (that Taiwan is a province of the PRC) and “One China” policies of other governments, such as the US (whose policy is that Taiwan’s status is “unresolved”) and UK (whose policy is that Taiwan’s status is a matter to be settled by the population on both sides of the strait).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, following a visit to Taiwan by the UK foreign affairs committee in 2022, a PRC spokesperson said, “The Chinese side urges the UK side to abide by its commitment, stop any actions that violate the one-China principle, and stop interfering in China’s internal affairs”, adding that “Moves of the UK side that undermine China’s interests will be met with forceful responses from the Chinese side”. In fact, no forceful response followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 30 July 2024 the Australian Senate unanimously adopted a bipartisan resolution rejecting the PRC’s attempts to mischaracterise Resolution 2758, stating that it does not address the political status of Taiwan nor establish PRC sovereignty over it, and that it is silent on the status of Taiwan in the UN and on Taiwanese participation in UN agencies. The UK parliament adopted a similar resolution on 28 November 2024, with one parliamentarian observing that “Ukraine stands as a reminder that it is best to form policy on a crisis before the crisis emerges. Incremental changes to the status quo made by authoritarian regimes are likely a prelude to more overt measures, and the best time to deter an aggressor is before their confidence grows”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK should continue to speak out against the PRC’s misinterpretation of Resolution 2758 and other forms of lawfare, not only with the practical objective of involving the world’s 22nd largest economy in global discussions where it can make a contribution, but also to communicate to the Taiwanese that they are not being abandoned, thereby stiffening morale and the social resilience that underpins their capacity for self-defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;information-affirm-that-peace-across-the-taiwan-strait-is-a-legitimate-international-interest&quot;&gt;Information: Affirm that Peace Across the Taiwan Strait is a Legitimate International Interest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing deploys a narrative designed to neutralise international involvement in the Taiwan issue, insisting that the Taiwan question is a strictly internal matter. The more this goes unopposed, the more Beijing may come to believe it has succeeded in isolating Taiwan and that it is safe to contemplate a coercive unification. To make this less likely, UK officials should affirm the fact that the consequences of a Taiwan crisis would be of a magnitude that such a scenario would constitute a threat to international peace and global prosperity, and to UK security and other interests. The most recent speech by a UK minister on the Indo-Pacific made no mention of the issue of security across the strait at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help convey the seriousness of such an action to Beijing, the UK should confer openly with regional allies and partners on how, collectively, they can best deter actions that could trigger an international armed conflict. To make it more credible, the message should be backed up with multinational economic and military exercises to signal the ability to undermine potential Chinese measures to restrict Taiwan’s maritime trade (a quarantine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If the UK seeks to make an effective contribution to maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait as it has for over half a century, changed circumstances require new approaches&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the UK should work with the G7 or G7+ partners on a statement recognising that coercive moves to change the status quo over Taiwan would be viewed as a threat to international peace and security, and that any such actions would trigger consultations on the appropriate collective measures to take in response. The UK should support Taiwan’s application to the International Criminal Court in order to pre-emptively establish lines of accountability to international institutions and norms in the event of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-policy-strengthened-security-assistance&quot;&gt;Security Policy: Strengthened Security Assistance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As tension over Taiwan continues to build, so does the UK military presence in the Indo-Pacific. Yet, when UK forces approach Taiwan, their presence is framed in terms of upholding freedom of navigation. This may send a reassuring signal to the PRC that the UK can be excluded from a Taiwan crisis, rather than a more ambiguous signal which would contribute to deterrence against the use of force or a blockade by the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase Beijing’s uncertainty, the UK should frame the purpose of its military presence in the Indo-Pacific – including the nuclear submarine on rotational deployment under the AUKUS agreement – as upholding not just a “free and open” Indo-Pacific, but a stable and secure region, in cooperation with allies (such as the US) and partners (such as Japan and Australia). Further, it should communicate in word and action that the purpose of deployments and exercises is not restricted to training and defence diplomacy. This posture would not constitute a commitment to defend Taiwan, but would require the PRC to weigh UK forces and political commitment in its calculation of the balance of international powers potentially opposing any coercive action that it might consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disparity in scale between the UK and US military presence can lead some to the conclusion that the UK presence is too minor to count. However, at the end of August 2024, not one of the US Navy’s 11 aircraft carriers was in the Pacific as a result of regional crises elsewhere. The UK is one of only two nuclear-armed US allies that can deploy a carrier strike group escorted by a nuclear-powered submarine to the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strengthening of the military dimension of the UK’s Taiwan policy will likely be characterised by Beijing as a provocation. However, higher diplomatic costs should be tolerated provided that they are proportionate to greater geopolitical stakes. Consider the example of Ukraine, where the risks arising from the involvement of UK forces (albeit not in a combat role) in a conflict involving a nuclear-armed opponent have rightly been deemed proportionate to what is at stake. Notwithstanding Ukraine’s importance, there is no contingency on the horizon that would have a greater impact on UK national interests than war over Taiwan, with the likelihood that it would involve the US – the UK’s most important ally – and have global implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategic communication about enhanced UK regional military engagement is not only necessary for sending a signal to the PRC. Public acceptance of this policy is important to building credible deterrence. Without it, the PRC is more likely to disregard the possibility of UK involvement. Absent public support, there is a risk of over-extension followed by precipitate withdrawal. This was the case with the reversal of then Prime Minister David Cameron’s proposal to use force in Syria in 2013. Withdrawal in the face of potential conflict would damage the credibility of the UK’s general commitment to security in the wider region, and in this case the strategic trust of the US and regional partners, notably Australia and Japan. At the same time, the UK will need to maintain its strategic ambiguity over military contingencies and not raise unrealistic expectations, including with Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One scenario to explore in this context is providing security for a humanitarian operation. Japanese strategic thinkers are reflecting on lessons learned from the Afghanistan withdrawal to consider a role for their armed forces in non-combatant evacuation operations, to extract the large number of Japanese nationals from Taiwan in the event of a conflict. The UK would also face the issue of evacuating significant numbers of its nationals – and possibly those of European allies – in such a crisis, and planning for such a contingency would offer a practical way to signal UK concern about current developments to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-forget-sanctions-concentrate-on-economic-security-and-resilience&quot;&gt;Economic: Forget Sanctions, Concentrate on Economic Security and Resilience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the disappointing results of sanctions against Russia following the Ukraine invasion, the notion that economic sanctions would be effective in deterring China over a Taiwan conflict is hard to credit. The imbalance of bilateral economic relations is also discouraging. In 2023, Chinese total imports of goods amounted to approximately $2.56 trillion, compared to total exports of $3.38 trillion. Of this, the 2024 estimated UK trade in goods and services of around £90 billion is trivial from the PRC’s perspective, and the bilateral trade imbalance means that UK sanctions would be a self-sabotaging move, costing the UK more than the PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of pursuing a sanctions-led approach to deter China, the UK should go further with its efforts to support Taiwan’s economic security and resilience, including its ability to sustain itself under blockade. The UK foreign affairs committee visiting Taiwan in 2022 discussed cooperation on cyber security and countering disinformation, and the Enhanced Trade Partnership arrangement agreed that year widened the scope for alleviating economic vulnerabilities and supporting Taiwan’s military development with dual (civil/military) use components or goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade policy should be developed to alleviate economic vulnerabilities, such as by furthering support for Taiwan’s renewable energy programme. The UK can expand the flow of dual (civil/military) use components or goods to enhance Taiwan’s ability to deter aggression. The PRC may accuse the UK of failing to limit its relations with Taiwan as agreed under the 1972 communique. However, as the PRC has itself demonstrated, there is scope for strategic ambiguity when it comes to “dual use” components. The UK might respond as Beijing did when it rejected UK requests to stop the flow of war-related items from China to Russia: rejecting illegitimate external interference in normal trade relations, and highlighting the difficulty of interfering with private-sector trade relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Prince of Salina said in Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel The Leopard, “If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change”. If the UK seeks to make an effective contribution to maintaining the status quo across the Taiwan Strait as it has for over half a century, changed circumstances require new approaches. Despite projecting more influence into the region surrounding Taiwan, the UK is not making full use of a widening array of policy instruments available to deter a crisis that would shatter the international balance over Taiwan and likely trigger a great power conflict. It is time to update rather than abandon strategic ambiguity to take account of the UK’s increased exposure and presence, as well as the opportunities offered by its participation (such as through AUKUS and other aspects of the “tilt”) in the “latticework” or “integrated deterrence” currently emerging in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;黎智英帖文指「中共同謀迫害香港人的惡行將會有後果」 官質疑意指制裁&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/theXeia.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第112日審訊，黎智英第21日作供。辯方圍繞《國安法》生效之後黎的意圖提問，提及2020年9月17至29日的事件。黎的 Twitter 曾轉載有關新民黨立法會議員葉劉淑儀撤走美國資產的新聞，帖文另說：「當美國人及全個自由世界都在聯成一線和實行制裁，中共的同謀無處可逃，而他們的資產也無處隱藏。他們迫害香港人的惡行將會有後果。」黎否認在上述帖文鼓吹制裁，只是說那些人會有後果，包括受到國際社會或自由世界排擠或「處理」。法官李素蘭追問相關「後果」是否制裁。黎則指制裁可以是其中一種做法，但是不一定是制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎將新冠疫情比擬為中國的珍珠港&quot;&gt;黎將新冠疫情比擬為「中國的珍珠港」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師關文渭昨就2020年9月17日播出的「Live Chat with Jimmy Lai」提問，今繼續提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中說，如果中國有民主和自由的話，中共便不能再執政。黎庭上解釋，因為中共一直透過控制人民來管治，如果中國有民主的話，中共便不能當政。黎又指，中共沒有自由的慣例（democratic institution），他們沒有能力運行一個民主國家，也不能夠一夜之間學會如何治國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在節目中稱，將中國內地爆發新冠肺炎比擬為二戰期間日本偷襲珍珠港，是很好的比擬，「不只對於美國而言，甚至對於世界而言，（疫情）就好像中國的『珍珠港』。」黎在庭上解釋，當年日本偷襲珍珠港對於美國而言是一記棒喝（awakening），提醒美國正面臨日本的威脅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，若如黎所形容日本對於美國構成威脅，黎的實際意思是否指中國對於美國和西方而言是一種危險或威脅？黎指，如果中國不改變的話，對於全球生計會是一種危險，因為疫情會影響生計。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎其後指，中國過度控制人民言論，如果病毒的消息可以在更早階段揭發的話，疫情便可以留在可以控制的範圍之內，因此從是次疫情可見中國的價值觀與世界的價值觀相違背。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎被追問，為何在節目中將疫情和香港被打壓扣連？黎指中國打壓香港是源於其價值觀與世界相違背，而中國爆發新冠疫情亦源於對市民言論的控制，使病毒擴散，所以疫情向全世界展示了中國沒有言論自由，與中國奪去香港法治和自由如出一轍，都是因為中國的價值觀與世界相違背。黎並補充：「中國與西方的生活方式是非常不同。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑黎認為中國要求其他國家屈膝&quot;&gt;官質疑黎認為中國要求其他國家屈膝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦在節目中稱：「除非習近平下台、中國改變戰狼態度，否則中國不能改變，或看不到它正在改變。」（“But China cannot change and perceive to be changing unless Xi Jinping, War Wolf attitude to the world is changed by his stepping down.”）黎庭上解釋，如果習不能了解到中國與世界交往的方式，有別於他要自己人民屈從於他的方式，中國便不會改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，黎是否想說中國要求其他國家屈膝，順從中國的方式？黎否認，強調他是指中國裡面的人民被要求屈從中國，而中國與世界交往的方式，就如他們對待自己人民的態度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰指，例如兩方要進行交易，如果有利益的話便同意交易，如果沒有利益的話便不交易，那麼與是否屈從有何關係？黎重申，他不是說中國要求其他國家屈從，而只是說人民被要求對中國屈從。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又指，與世界貿易過程中需要遵守規矩。杜官追問是否世界貿易組織（WTO）所訂立的規矩時，黎則稱相信世界有一套看不見、不成文的規則（untold and invisible rules），是一種從西方文明演化而成的「文化規則（cultural rules）」，並且超越了白紙黑字的規則。杜官質疑黎經常說中國不跟從規則，卻說不出「規則」是什麼。黎僅回應：「世上有些言明的規則，有些未言明的規則，但是兩者都是重要的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎節目指開放愈多內地人到外國旅遊-便會愈多人被西方價值開導-最終改變中共&quot;&gt;黎節目指開放愈多內地人到外國旅遊 便會愈多人被西方價值開導 最終改變中共&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在觀眾提問環節時，黎表示當中國容許更多人到外地旅遊時，中國內地人便會了解到自由世界的人是怎樣有靈魂地生活，「愈多人會被西方價值開導，便會對中共造成更大壓力，中共需要作出改變。」黎又稱：「在十年內，中國會因為面臨某些危機而轉差，使中共倒台。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上解釋，人民的渴望是能夠改變獨裁政權，如果有足夠的群眾（critical mass）的話，也有可能改變中共。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎亦指，如果習近平下台的話，中共必定需要作出改變，以融入世界的價值觀，使其他國家更願意與之交往。他指，中共執政以來，中國一直繁榮及發展很好，在經濟上創造奇蹟，也不見中國與其他國家有衝突，但是自從習近平上台之後，「所有事情都變了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎帖文指中共同謀會有後果-否認鼓吹制裁&quot;&gt;黎帖文指中共同謀「會有後果」 否認鼓吹制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年9月17日黎的 Twitter 帖文，轉載《蘋果》英文版新聞，有關新民黨立法會議員葉劉淑儀撤走美國資產，帖文另加上評論：「當美國人及全個自由世界都在聯成一線和實行制裁，中共的同謀無處可逃，而他們的資產也無處隱藏。他們迫害香港人的惡行將會有後果。（“When American and the rest of the free world are aligned with and put in place sanctions. CCP’s accomplices have nowhere to turn, and their assets have nowhere to hide. Their evil deeds persecuting of HKers will have consequences.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎否認在上述帖文鼓吹制裁，只是說那些人會有後果，包括受到國際社會或自由世界排擠或「處理」。法官李運騰指，黎使用「同謀（accomplices）」這個字眼，是否暗示該人是一名「罪犯」？黎則指對政權唯命是從（kowtow）的人，他們不一定是罪犯，但也可以是作惡者（evil doers）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問黎帖文中「後果」是什麼意思。黎舉例指不能開銀行戶口、不能獲批旅遊簽證等。法官李素蘭追問，為何不能開銀行戶口？黎僅指，因為他們作惡會有後果，會被外國排擠。李素蘭繼續追問原因，黎說：「我的意思是他們（外國）自有其方法⋯⋯我不會知道。」法官李素蘭追問：「制裁可以做到嗎？」黎回答：「制裁可以是其中之一。」李素蘭再追問：「所以你是說（中共同謀）會被制裁？」黎指：「我沒有說制裁，我只是說有後果。」李素蘭追問，所以後果就是制裁？黎重申，制裁可以是其中一種做法，但是不一定是制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭續指，黎的帖文中只提及「制裁」一詞，而沒有提及其他做法？黎同意，讀者可能會如此理解。法官李運騰問，黎早前在訊息中提醒「徙弟」李兆富「鼓吹制裁是很危險」，黎會否認為李未能遵守他的指示？黎表示：「我認為這只是疏忽。」在李官的追問下，黎同意李未能遵守他的指示。至於帖文由誰撰寫，黎表示他對於「制裁」一詞很敏感，所以不會使用這字詞，帖文可能出自李手筆，但也有可能黎自己不小心寫了這個包含「制裁」字眼的帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於帖文意思，黎堅稱帖文中的「當（When）」等同於「如果（If）」，強調是尚未發生的事情。黎亦指帖文只是在推測，他們將會有後果，「那一天會來臨，他們終要受苦」。如果作惡者被制裁的話，他們將會受苦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，有後果的人是否包括那些未被列入制裁名單的人？黎同意。李官又問，一般人看到上述帖文時，理解到它似乎在說葉劉理應被列入制裁名單，但她未有。黎則否認帖文有意請求外國制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎要求蘋果英文版增加中台新聞&quot;&gt;黎要求《蘋果》英文版增加中台新聞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示《蘋果》英文版群組的訊息紀錄，黎在2020年9月23日傳送訊息，要求增加中國內地和台灣的新聞數量。被問到為何想增加中國內地新聞，黎解釋想讓讀者增加對中國及其人民生活狀況的了解，因為世界需要與中國交往，若對中國了解較多的話，能夠較容易解決問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎又被問到為何認為增加台灣新聞是重要和必需。黎指一來因為英文新聞不足夠，而且台灣在未來數年變得重要。杜官提到，黎在訊息中已解釋了為何台灣新聞重要，因為要聚焦在中美大戰。辯方接著問，為何在中美大戰之下，台灣新聞對讀者而言是重要？黎指因為緊張局勢的新聞會引起讀者興趣，相信中國和美國之間的緊張局勢，對於國際社會而言必定是有趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎專欄文章指教會承受壓力-官質疑湯漢樞機曾告訴你嗎&quot;&gt;黎專欄文章指教會承受壓力 官質疑湯漢樞機曾告訴你嗎？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年9月27日黎的個人專欄「成敗樂一笑」刊出文章〈繼續打壓香港還是以身報國？〉。其中提到：「中共出盡吃奶的力滲透香港所有階層，從教育、社福入手攻陷司法體制。最近，教育局局長楊潤雄從教科書刪除三權分立的課題，而林鄭力挺、嘍囉搖旗呐喊，其目的就是摧毀百多年來行之有效的司法制度；出言恐嚇校長教師、將『思想不正確』的書籍從學校圖書館下架等，就是要將學校變成洗腦機器。」、「中共滲透社會各層面、大力鎮壓，警權坐大、淩駕法律，或者可以說警察老早就是法律了。香港已是座警察城市，字字鮮明寫在牆上。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在庭上解釋，中共改變了學校、改變了警察、影響了宗教範疇，因此形容「中共出盡吃奶的力滲透香港所有階層」。他認為教育和宗教應該獨立於政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章提到：「我不知道中共在社福方面部署了些什麼惡行，但教會已然淪陷。譬如天主教樞機湯漢日前致函神職人員，囑咐神父講道勿談政治，不宜含沙射影或煽動仇恨言論，又叫停正義和平委員會眾籌在報章刊登國安法禱文，教會受到的打壓可知一二。」黎庭上解釋，當時教會承受很大政治壓力，導致湯漢樞機發出聲明。法官杜麗冰質疑，湯漢樞機曾告訴黎教會正承受很大壓力嗎？黎表示沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎指警搜查蘋果大樓使所有傳媒都被震懾-官質疑說法不準確&quot;&gt;黎指警搜查蘋果大樓使「所有傳媒」都被震懾 官質疑說法不準確&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章談及警方於8月10日搜查蘋果日報大樓：「二百警察殺入蘋果日報大樓，大肆搜查檔案文件，更是警權侵犯新聞自由；旨在殺雞儆猴，震懾所有傳媒。經此一役，以後傳媒哪還敢不靠邊站？有人說『反中亂港』的壹傳媒仍未被冚檔，依然一貫方針報道新聞、發表言論，可見香港還有新聞自由。是的，我們照常運作，但我們每一天都要冒著被拉人封艇的風險。當你要提心吊膽寫東西、講說話時，你還自由嗎？自由是無憂無慮的。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎庭上稱，當時蘋果日報大樓在未有具體控罪之下被搜查，而警方只是突然搜查傳媒（raiding the media）。法官李運騰打斷，問警方是否有搜查令？黎同意有，但是一間傳媒不應該被人以這樣的方式進入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎在文章指稱警方搜查《蘋果》「旨在殺雞儆猴，震懾所有傳媒」，他解釋：「那次之後，所有傳媒都被震懾（all the medias were shocked to suffocation），沒有人再敢寫任何東西。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰質疑，搜查是在8月10日發生，但是黎在9月25日發表此文章，代表《蘋果》仍然能運作、他亦仍然能夠撰文，又質疑黎指「所有傳媒」都被震懾，說法並不準確，因《蘋果》仍運作。黎強調：「我見到這些現象，所以我便把它寫下來。」其後改口說應是「幾乎所有傳媒」而不是「所有傳媒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，如果《蘋果》仍然運作，那麼黎為何會說傳媒被震懾？黎說：「因為它（蘋果日報大樓）被突擊搜查，我們被逮捕」，使其他傳媒開始擔心會好像《蘋果》般被拘捕或者停運。他續指，「當我們擔憂或恐懼會停運的時候，便失去了言論自由。」黎指：「我認為言論自由是我們不用恐懼是否會停運，即使我們出錯也好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎稱國安法之後蘋果不被允許出席所有政府記者會&quot;&gt;黎稱國安法之後《蘋果》不被允許出席所有政府記者會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章續指：「警方於是悍然修改《警察通例》中『傳媒代表』的定義，變相由政府新聞處向記者『發牌』，以警權主導政府，淩駕法律。」法官李運騰問黎是指記者不被允許「採訪」政府記者會，還是不被允許「報導」？辯方亦追問《警察通例》修改之後，是否由政府新聞處向記者「發牌」才能允許他們出席記者會？黎表示未有相關詳情，所以未能回答。他補充，因為不論《國安法》前後都好，政府的記者會都對哪些傳媒能夠出席有相關限制，此做法一直以來都有，可是他不知道修例的範圍有多大。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問《蘋果》作為註冊媒體，以往獲允許出席政府的記者會嗎？黎指在《國安法》之前，《蘋果》記者有時可以，但是《國安法》之後，他們不被允許出席所有的政府記者會，若混進去的話有時「會被人趕走」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問，如果他們不能混入記者會的話，那麼他們是否獲准報導？黎指可以，他們仍可以報導相關新聞，他們可以從其他獲准出席記者會的傳媒收集消息。黎亦確認《蘋果》可以發布相關新聞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎文章問及若美國將部分日本駐軍轉移到台灣-中共會怎回應-否認鼓吹敵對&quot;&gt;黎文章問及若美國將部分日本駐軍轉移到台灣 中共會怎回應 否認鼓吹敵對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章指：「中共以國安法此粗暴的法西斯手段進行鎮壓，摧毀保證香港高度自治、司法獨立、新聞言論自由和法治的承諾，證明國際社會不能信任中共。」黎否認意圖引起市民憎恨中央政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章亦提到：「日本在1941年12月7日偷襲珍珠港前，美國人民對希特拉的邪惡並不上心，不支持美國參戰拯救歐洲。珍珠港受襲徹底改變了美國人的意向，全力參戰，終於打敗邪惡的納粹和日本，拯救了歐洲，挽西方文明狂瀾於既倒。」黎否認將中國類比為「邪惡的納粹和日本」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章亦指：「美國的反共熱潮更喚醒了歐盟、澳紐、日本以至東盟等國，改變對華政策。這些國家同樣是武漢肺炎瘟疫的受害者；跟美國人一樣，其人民對中共的本質有所頓悟，萌發強烈反感。政府的取態依隨民心轉向而改變。今日，中共面對自由世界一致的責難和制裁，形成經濟開放四十年來最大的外交、經濟和政治的危機。」黎否認透過此段落來鼓吹外國制裁，強調只是描述中國現正所面對的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章指：「美國大選前夕，美國駐華大使布蘭斯塔德辭職，是中美外交降格的伏筆。與此同時，川普若進一步公開承認台灣主權，甚至將部分日本駐軍轉移到台灣，到其時中共又如何回應？」黎否認有意藉此段落邀請及請求美國針對中國採取敵對措施。他指這類型評論在當時的美國報紙很常見，而且他認為上述情況很有可能發生，所以才寫下來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;文章最後指：「不回應則明剃眼眉。跟美國熱戰可更吃虧，拖死經濟之余甚至拖垮中共政權。怎麼辦？打開這個死結的唯一辦法是習近平下台。」黎否認有意圖引起對中央政府的憎恨，甚至無意引起對習近平的憎恨。他解釋，自從習近平上台之後，中國開始與美國及全世界產生問題，因為習對國際事務缺乏理解，只有當習下台及不再壟斷中共，才能解決到問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官留意黎使用武漢肺炎-黎估計是習慣&quot;&gt;官留意黎使用「武漢肺炎」 黎估計是習慣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰表示，留意到黎在文章中使用「武漢肺炎瘟疫」字眼，但據他的記憶，《蘋果》員工之間曾有 WhatsApp 訊息，指某些字詞似乎帶貶損意味（derogatory），當中包括「武漢肺炎」。李官問黎撰寫文章的時候有否留意這一點？黎則指該些討論是圍繞報導字眼，而不是評論文章，又稱他沒有留意相關討論，因認為這是編輯要注意的事項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何不使用「新冠病毒」而是使用「武漢肺炎」，黎表示：「我估計是我習慣了，我估計只是一種習慣，不小心。」他指《蘋果》在《國安法》之前是使用「武漢肺炎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問黎，有沒有意圖藉此文章引起香港不同社群之間的不滿？黎表示：「我沒有這樣的意圖。」他亦否認有意藉文章激使他人不守法，或以非法手段改變既有制度等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑黎不了解清楚便在帖文中使用邪惡一詞&quot;&gt;官質疑黎不了解清楚便在帖文中使用「邪惡」一詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示2020年9月29日的 Twitter 帖文，轉載有關天主教香港教區榮休主教陳日君樞機乘機前往梵蒂岡，要求會見教宗方濟各，反對任命蔡惠民神父為香港教區主教。黎並在帖文寫道：「雖然陳日君樞機知道成事的機會很微，但是他依然乘搭長途機前往梵蒂岡，與邪惡對戰（儘管他有88歲之齡）他是真正的英雄！」（“Although @CardJosephZen knew there was only a very slim chance of success, he still took a long flight to the Vatican to fight against evil (despite his old age of 88.) He is a true hero!”）&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 天主教香港教區榮休主教 陳日君樞機（左）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎起初誤稱陳日君該次梵蒂岡之行是為了阻止梵蒂岡與中國簽訂任命主教的秘密協議，惟辯方提醒黎該協議早於2018年已簽訂。法官杜麗冰問是否關於主教人選？黎才記起並指，當時有消息指一名姓蔡的人（蔡惠民）會獲任命為下任主教，然而陳日君樞機強烈反對任命蔡，因此他乘飛機前往梵蒂岡，希望會見教宗及反對任命蔡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官指黎在帖文中使用「邪惡」一詞，問他：「有什麼邪惡之處，要乘搭長途機前往梵蒂岡？」黎表示忘記了。杜官問是否因為蔡的背景？黎說可能是，提到當時有很多人強烈反對他做主教，所以陳日君才會前往梵蒂岡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官質疑黎在該帖文中使用「邪惡」一詞，卻不知道有什麼邪惡之處？黎表示不知道。杜官指黎的 Twitter 帳戶有17.4萬人追蹤，是否應該有責任在發布帖文之前弄清楚？黎表示他不知道詳情。黎又指，陳日君曾在數次晚飯期間向他談及蔡，可是他忘記了陳日君怎樣說蔡，並承認：「帖文措辭可能過於強烈，抱歉我使用了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;杜官繼續質疑，其他人可以在黎的 Twitter 帳戶上看到公開帖文形容某些事是「邪惡」，為何黎在不了解的情況下，針對他不了解的人使用「邪惡」一字？黎則堅稱他當時是知道某些事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件押後至明年1月6日續審。&lt;/p&gt;
