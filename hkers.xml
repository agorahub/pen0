&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（26日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第67日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，並接受辯方盤問。辯方指在數次陳與黎的會面當中，黎沒有說過想「領導或主導勇武派」，或是結合議會、街頭和國際的力量，去「推爆個政府」。陳早前供稱，他於2020年1月在台北陽明山的別墅與黎智英、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸等人開會，期間黎聲稱想培養劉成為政治明星，並談及「支爆」計劃。不過辯方今指，「支爆」是由劉祖廸在會議中首先提出，而非黎智英，而黎對這種字眼並不熟悉，會議更沒有談論如何達到「支爆」。惟陳稱：「我唔同意。」辯方又指，黎想培養劉祖廸成為政治明星、提供一萬英鎊生活費的說法，完全是陳捏造出來的。陳否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第九天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由代表黎智英的紐西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英僅在意大規模遊行畫面要和平-其他小打小鬧示威則沒有立場&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英僅在意大規模遊行畫面要和平 其他「小打小鬧」示威則沒有立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳梓華與黎智英第一次親身會面，辯方指陳早前供稱黎認為示威應該和平、非暴力，以爭取國際支持，亦表示希望透過陳聯絡勇武派，叫他們克制，因為他們的行動會危害國際支持，陳以「淨化計劃」來形容黎的計劃，但是這只是陳自己的理解，可是黎智英從來沒有使用「淨化計劃」這個字眼。惟陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎曾說過勇武派襲擊警察和破壞財物會有反作用，提倡港獨的人士會削弱香港民主運動，他希望所有示威都是和平、非暴力。惟陳稱：「佢（黎）冇講過所有嘅示威都想和平、非暴力」，又稱：「佢唔係咁樣講。佢係話『美國唔希望見到咁樣嘅畫面』」，如果有傳媒報導的畫面，就應該是「和理非」的，「至於唔會咁多畫面畀人見到嗰啲，其實佢冇立場嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，黎智英是想傳媒選擇性報導？陳則回答不是，當時傳媒主要報導兩次大型遊行，但同時間在不同地方「有啲小打小鬧嘅示威」，「當時佢（黎）在意嘅係，呢啲比較規模大嘅示威一定要係個畫面和平嘅，唔應該有太多暴力場面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華認是勇武派telegram-群組成員之一-但否認身為勇武派一員&quot;&gt;陳梓華認是勇武派Telegram 群組成員之一 但否認身為勇武派一員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎智英要求陳梓華傳遞訊息，是因為陳與勇武派有接觸。陳表示：「我同意。」辯方追問，陳是否勇武派的領袖。陳否認。辯方又問，陳是否勇武派成員之一。陳則稱：「我唔會咁形容。」辯方追問那陳會如何形容自己。陳稱：「我哋只係喺同一個群組入面。」陳亦確認他並沒有參與在暴力示威行動中，他的角色只是身為勇武派的 Telegram 群組成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在該次飯局中，要求收起陳手提電話的人是李柱銘，黎並沒有說過他與私人助手 Mark Simon 每天都會聯絡，黎也沒有說過「年青人做唔到嘅嘢，利用佢傳媒嘅力量，就可以做到」。惟陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英沒說過想領導或主導勇武派&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英沒說過想「領導或主導勇武派」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華與黎智英於2019年11月13日第二次親身見面，當時是在黎的住所，同場有民主黨的林卓廷、李永達和工黨的李卓人。辯方指，黎在該次飯局中，曾說過對於馬鞍山火燒人事後感到震驚，形容勇武派「冇分寸、冇組織、愈來愈暴力」，如果有人在運動中死亡的話，香港便會失去國際支持，民主運動亦會失去道德高地，削弱原有的進程。陳確認，又指黎說過勇武派要減少激進行動，應該以「和理非」抗爭為主旨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，陳當時有在席間表明同意黎的觀點，並說黎的觀點「一語中的（hit the nail on the head）」。惟陳稱：「我冇講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，黎智英沒有特別提及過「五大訴求」，也沒有說過「如果年青人做唔到嘅嘢，佢可以以傳媒嘅力量做到」。陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱黎想「領導或主導勇武派」，辯方則指這僅僅是陳自己的理解，黎並沒有在飯局中表示想「領導或主導勇武派」，而黎所說的是要求陳聯絡勇武派，叫他們停止使用暴力。陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方聞言質疑，陳的意思是否指黎想出去參與暴力示威、進行暴力行動？惟陳亦表示：「唔係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英沒說過結合議會街頭和國際力量推爆個政府&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英沒說過結合議會、街頭和國際力量「推爆個政府」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳梓華和黎智英第三次會面，是在2019年11月27日在黎的座駕上，辯方指黎當時仍然想聯絡勇武派，而並非如陳早前所供稱黎已經「大致掌握勇武派嘅資料同動向」，所以不需陳繼續協助。陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱黎該次說過區議會民主派大勝，應該乘著這股氣勢，結合議會、街頭和國際的力量，去「推爆個政府」。辯方向陳提議，黎智英並沒有說過上述說話。惟陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前亦供稱黎提到張崑陽，並談及商討贊助和眾籌的事宜。辯方則指黎並沒有在該次會面中談及商討贊助和眾籌。惟陳表示：「我唔同意，佢有講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在該次會面中，黎和陳並沒有達成協議去做任何非法事情。惟陳表示：「呢個我唔確定」，因黎講得好清楚要議會、街頭和國際線結合，「而我好難認為，當時國際線或者街頭，所有嘢都係合法嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英沒有向陳梓華談及初選&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英沒有向陳梓華談及初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱，在2019年12月31日與黎智英第四次會面，當時同樣在一架停泊在金鐘的座駕上單獨會面。辯方指，黎在會面中表明反對港獨和攬炒，惟陳只同意黎有講過反對港獨，至於攬炒方面則不同意，因黎有叫陳聯絡「攬炒巴」劉祖廸。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黎所說的是他認為不應該在國際論壇上提及港獨和攬炒，而且應該給予年輕人多些指引，然而陳對於黎的印象是他不理解為何年輕人會「無大台」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前亦供稱，黎認為如果政治素人參與初選之後落敗的話，他們的票都可以「流返落老泛民度」，最終可以鞏固到泛民在立法會的議席。辯方則指黎並沒有在該次會面中談及初選。陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱台北會面是為了與勇武派領袖見面&quot;&gt;辯方稱台北會面是為了與勇武派領袖見面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2020年1月的台北陽明山別墅的會議，辯方指黎智英曾經告訴陳梓華，會面源起是黎想與勇武派的領袖見面，籲他們停止做不恰當行為，這亦是「攬炒巴」劉祖廸前來台灣參與會議的原因。惟陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在整個會面過程中，劉祖廸僅以「攬炒」作為自己的稱呼，當黎智英問及劉的英文名時，劉並沒有提供。陳確認。辯方指劉祖廸在會議中鮮有發言，主要是黎智英和陳梓華發言。陳則不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英僅叫劉祖廸做年輕人領袖-而非說培養他做政治明星&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英僅叫劉祖廸做年輕人領袖 而非說培養他做政治明星&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問陳是否記得，黎在會議中提及過「香港監察」及其創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers），也就香港年輕人的活動表達關注，指圍封理大事件中有四成勇武派被捕。陳表示沒有印象，但他確認黎關注年輕人沒有領袖和方向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黎智英說過，勇武派是時候有一個領袖。惟陳稱：「佢唔係咁講。」辯方再指黎說過他認為年輕人要有適當的領導。陳則確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱黎在會議中表示要培養劉祖廸做政治明星，惟辯方指，黎並沒有如此說過，黎只是說劉可以做年輕人的領袖；又指陳供稱黎說提供一萬英鎊生活費給劉祖廸，完全是陳捏造出來的。陳否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指支爆乃由劉祖廸首先提出-黎智英對此字眼並不熟悉&quot;&gt;辯方指「支爆」乃由劉祖廸首先提出 黎智英對此字眼並不熟悉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，「支爆」是由劉祖廸在會議中首先提出，而非黎智英，而黎對這種字眼並不熟悉。陳稱：「我唔同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎沒有說過任何關於國際游說、實施制裁和禁運的話題，會議也沒有提及李宇軒到訪美國會見議員。辯方亦指，黎智英沒有提及眾籌、前美國眾議院議長佩洛西或前政務司司長陳方安生，會議也沒有提及劉祖廸和「攬炒團隊」的工作，沒有談論如何達到「支爆」。陳對以上說法一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱劉祖廸在會議中表示願意合作，但需要與李宇軒商討，惟辯方指劉的意思是有關年輕人的工作，而非關於國際游說，而且整個會議中從沒有提起過李宇軒。陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指陳梓華的訊息沒有提及制裁-陳點會喺whatsapp度講我自己做犯法嘅嘢&quot;&gt;辯方指陳梓華的訊息沒有提及制裁 陳：點會喺WhatsApp度講我自己做犯法嘅嘢？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月21日，黎智英向陳梓華傳送人大公布實施「港版國安法」的新聞，陳之後回覆：「黎前輩：事情至今，已經難以逆轉形勢，我唯一擔心是你與 Martin 及你們家人的自身安全，萬事請以自身安全與事業存續為首要考慮。國安法主要針對境外內勇武人士，港獨份子及煽惑群眾人士。你務必謹慎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，陳並沒有在上述訊息提及向外國請求制裁。陳回應：「因為我知道犯咗法，所以我仲點會喺 WhatsApp 度講我自己做犯法嘅嘢？」他其後又補上一句：「我呢句已經講得好溫和架喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問陳為何會向黎傳送上述訊息，叫他小心。陳則稱：「因為有好多人講過，《國安法》立嚟就係針對黎智英。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同日，黎智英回覆陳，籲他不要擔心個人安危，一旦站出來爭取自由，便要作戰至最後一刻，雖然未必會勝利，但必須堅持下去，更好的日子即將會來臨。（“Let’s not worry about personal security. Once came out to join the fight for freedom one is prepared to fight to the last. We may not win but must persist. Don’t worry. Better days will come.”）辯方問陳，黎訊息的意思是否鼓勵他保持士氣，繼續參與民主運動。陳則回答這是其中一個意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華其後回覆黎，稱自己無路可退，他有責任盡量保留實力，也不會放棄，「如果你們倒下了，我會是最後一個站著的人」，最好的情況即將來臨。（“There is no turning back for me and I do have a sense of duty to conserve our forces as much as possible. I won’t give up too. If all of you fall, I will be the last man standing. The best is yet to come.”）辯方問陳，上述訊息是否反映陳看待自己的方式。陳表示：「我有咁嘅諗法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指黎智英沒有在壹傳媒大樓會面中談及ipac或swhk&quot;&gt;辯方指黎智英沒有在壹傳媒大樓會面中談及IPAC或SWHK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱於2020年6月16日到達將軍澳壹傳媒大樓，與黎智英第六次會面，指期間黎提及「《國安法》雷聲大、雨點小，佢唔會有事嘅」。辯方質疑，黎當時並未看過《國安法》條文，也不會知道條文內容，黎亦未曾告訴陳，他知道《國安法》之下國際游說變成不合法。陳同意，可是他認為當時黎予人感覺是他已事先知道《國安法》條文內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，黎並沒有在該次會面中談論「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC），也沒有談論「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）；黎亦沒有提及過要為《蘋果日報》尋求經濟或商業支援。惟陳一概表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/buBUuy5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（26日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第67日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，並接受辯方盤問。辯方展示陳於2020年10月11日在警署錄影會面謄本，顯示他當時跟警方否認是「重光團隊」（SWHK）成員，又稱不肯定李宇軒是否成員之一、與 SWHK 沒有任何關係、會講 SWHK 的負面評價等等。陳在庭上逐一承認當時的說法是虛假的。他亦承認：「我當時係想畀警察覺得唔關李宇軒事」，為了令李脫罪而向警方捏造供詞，又承認：「當時想同 Stand with Hong Kong 撇清關係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第九天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由代表黎智英的紐西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華錄口供稱對李宇軒所知不多-惟今庭上改稱不是真話&quot;&gt;陳梓華錄口供稱對李宇軒所知不多 惟今庭上改稱不是真話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方談及陳梓華與李宇軒之間的關係，二人於2019年6月在網上認識，當時聯絡是有關 Telegram 的G20登報計劃群組面對眾籌問題。之後二人曾經數次親身見面，惟《國安法》生效之後，二人便沒有再親身見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，事實上陳梓華對李宇軒所知不多，例如不知道李的職業、學歷、個人背景和住在哪裡等等。陳否認，並堅稱：「我知，我知佢住邊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂向陳出示2020年10月11日的錄影會面謄本，當時陳首次被捕，尚未同意以證人身份協助本案。陳當時向警方稱：「我同佢（李）嘅私交嘅關係，係在於我會詢問到佢，了解到佢屋企人之間嘅關係，但係佢嘅職業、佢嘅學歷、佢嘅背景，我係唔清楚，亦都唔了解嘅。」陳稱他當時的確這樣跟警察說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但當辯方追問陳當時有否向警方說真話時，陳卻稱：「當時我冇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華錄口供稱對李宇軒所知不多二人關係不平等-今庭上稱是虛假&quot;&gt;陳梓華錄口供稱對李宇軒所知不多、二人關係不平等 今庭上稱是虛假&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳的錄影會面謄本亦顯示，陳當時向警方稱：「我有問心嗰句嘅，我對於我與佢嘅關係唔平等嘅，唔平等嘅關係就在於佢對我認知好多，佢會知我住邊度，但我從來唔知道佢住邊度，佢會知道我嘅職業係乜嘢，但我從來唔知佢職業係乜嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，當時他的確不知道李宇軒住哪裡。辯方追問，所以陳是否對李所知不多。陳則表示，相比起李所知道他的事，他的確對李所知較少。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳聲稱二人關係不平等，因為李對陳認知很多，但是陳卻對李所知不多。陳說：「當時我唔係咁諗。」辯方追問這說法是否真確。陳則表示：「假嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方盤問下，陳確認李會參與民主運動，但是不會知道當中所有的活動；陳也同意他與李宇軒一樣都是參與民主運動的年青一代。辯方遂問陳，與其說他與李是親密朋友（close friends），不如說二人是擁有共同利益的泛泛之交（acquaintances with common interest），這樣的說法是否公允。陳則回應：「我唔知佢點諗，但我當佢係朋友。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華錄口供稱不肯定李宇軒是否swhk成員-今庭上承認是虛假陳述&quot;&gt;陳梓華錄口供稱不肯定李宇軒是否SWHK成員 今庭上承認是虛假陳述&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK），陳確認它是一個鬆散的組織，曾經有一段時間出現不同人以 SWHK 名義做不同事情的情況。陳稱在 SWHK 初期成立的時候，他不是成員之一，後來在大約2020年6至7月，他加入了 SWHK 的群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示陳的錄影會面謄本，當時警察問他是否 SWHK 的成員，陳回答：「絕對唔係。」辯方追問陳當時的說法是真實還是虛假。陳回答：「假嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;錄影會面謄本亦顯示，警察繼而問李宇軒是否 SWHK 成員，陳當時回應：「佢本人是否呢個組織嘅成員，我自己係難以去界定」，又指李有參與做義工，但不知道他是否實際上恆常參與 SWHK 的其中一人。辯方指，事實上陳在當時並不知道李是否 SWHK 的成員之一。陳不同意，並堅稱他知道李是SWHK成員。辯方追問，陳跟警察所說的東西是真實還是虛假。陳回答：「假。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華承認為了幫李宇軒脫罪而向警察說謊&quot;&gt;陳梓華承認為了幫李宇軒脫罪而向警察說謊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指陳並不知道誰人是 SWHK 的領袖，也與領袖沒有任何關係。陳表示：「我唔同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示陳的錄影會面謄本，顯示陳當時向警方聲稱進入不到 SWHK 的核心，所以與 SWHK 的領袖沒有關係。辯方追問陳上述陳述是真實還是虛假。陳回答：「假。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;錄影會面謄本亦顯示，陳向警察稱 SWHK 領導「唔似係得李宇軒一個」，辯方指陳的意思是他並不知道 SWHK 的領導，除了李之外。陳回應：「我當時係想畀警察覺得唔關李宇軒事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，陳當時是否嘗試令李宇軒脫罪。陳回答：「10月嘅時候，係。」辯方問陳，是否為了幫李宇軒脫罪而向警方捏造供詞。陳回答：「係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱會跟朋友及家人講swhk負面評價-庭上承認說謊想撇清關係&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱會跟朋友及家人講SWHK負面評價 庭上承認說謊：想撇清關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，陳梓華並不知道 SWHK 的背景，亦會向朋友和家人講對於 SWHK 的負面評價，陳否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方向陳展示其錄影會面謄本，顯示他當時向警察稱：「因為我對於 Stand with Hong Kong 嘅某啲目的，甚或乎背景，我一直有存疑。咁可能我會有所貶抑，對佢哋一啲負面嘅評論，可能會喺私底下同朋友上面，或者係同家人有講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問上述說法是真實還是虛假，惟陳回應：「當時想同 Stand with Hong Kong 撇清關係。」辯方追問：「所以你向警察說謊？」陳稱：「我同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華錄口供稱沒參與國際游說-庭上承認是虛假說法&quot;&gt;陳梓華錄口供稱沒參與國際游說 庭上承認是虛假說法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在盤問下，陳表示他並非沒有參與過國際游說。至於陳在2020年10月11日錄影會面中聲稱沒有參與其中，他今在庭上改口說：「當時係假嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又確認，他沒有參與過 IPAC 的工作、沒有參與 SWHK 的日本線、英國線和北歐線，也沒有代表 SWHK 草擬或發布新聞稿、Facebook 或 Twitter 帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於 SWHK 的美國線，陳稱在《國安法》生效之後，他有參與 Telegram 群組的會議，及參與討論，當大家一起決策的時候，他有表示同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（4月29日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華錄口供自言經常取笑攬炒派 今庭上改口稱當時不是說真話&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（25日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第66日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他今開始接受辯方盤問。辯方透露陳於2021年3月31日同意以證人身份協助本案，並展示多份供詞紀錄。陳的書面供詞引述 Mark Simon 說：「你需要思考嘅係點樣將你嘅生活重回正軌，因為香港唔會再有呢啲咁大型嘅社會活動發生。」惟陳承認當時向警察說的話並非真確。供詞亦顯示陳自言：「我本人都係唔 buy（攬炒），因為我成日笑佢哋就係話，你話攬炒、攬炒，咁到𠵱家攬炒咗啲乜嘢出嚟呢？即係我都會調侃佢哋。」不過當辯方追問陳當時是否在說真話。陳回答：「我有笑攬炒呢個概念」，之後突然說：「因為我自己攬炒咗自己。」陳最後承認書面供詞所述的說話是虛假的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第八天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問完畢，接著由代表黎智英的御用大律師 Marc Corlett 盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方透露陳梓華2021年3月同意做證人協助本案-與警方會面合共81次103小時&quot;&gt;辯方透露陳梓華2021年3月同意做證人協助本案 與警方會面合共81次、103小時&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Corlett 透露，陳梓華於2021年3月31日同意就本案提供協助，之後以證人身份先後進行4次錄影會面，亦錄取了4份書面供詞，連同上述會面，陳與警方合共會見了81次，歷時103小時。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Corlett 指，在上述會面及口供之中，陳從沒跟警方說在2020年7月1日《國安法》生效之後，他與黎智英曾經透過電話聯絡。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，陳亦確認在《國安法》生效之後，他沒有與黎智英親身會面或進行任何線上會議，而二人於2020年6月16日在壹傳媒大樓的會面是最後一次。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就 WhatsApp 訊息，黎與陳之間的最後一則訊息是在2020年6月16日；至於 Signal 訊息，紀錄顯示黎與陳之間的最後一則訊息是在2020年7月13日。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華確認一些過往合法活動在國安法後變成不合法&quot;&gt;陳梓華確認一些過往合法活動在國安法後變成不合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Corlett 續指，陳梓華連日來在庭上供述《國安法》生效之前他所做過的事，可是他被起訴的控罪僅涵蓋2020年7月1日至2021年2月15日，而非《國安法》生效之前的時段。陳被起訴的「協助罪犯」和「串謀勾結外國勢力危害國家安全」僅牽涉《國安法》生效之後的活動。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marc Corlett 續指，《國安法》於2020年6月30日午夜生效，而法律條文在生效之前才公布，陳表示不記得，而且他在數日之後才閱讀條文。Marc Corlett 問陳是否知道，一些過往被視為合法的活動，在《國安法》生效之後變成不合法。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指國安法後應繼續推動制裁-因見黎智英無畏無懼以身作則&quot;&gt;陳梓華指國安法後應繼續推動制裁 因見黎智英無畏無懼、以身作則&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示陳梓華與李宇軒之間的 Signal 訊息，在2020年7月23日，陳向李說，不知道《國安法》對李而言代表什麼（“I am not sure about the implication of NSL on you.”），但是這不代表在新法例下什麼也不做（“Yet, it does not (mean) we don’t do anything under the new law.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問陳的訊息意思是否指，雖然在新法例下有些活動是不合法，但是他不會停止推動民主運動。陳指不是，反指該訊息其中一個意思，是「因為喺海外依然有好多 Stand with Hong Kong 嘅成員，佢哋依然可以呼籲制裁」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，陳的意思是否指身處香港的人士要小心、在紅線範圍內行事；或者香港人與海外人士可以做的事情有分別。陳表示以上皆不是。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳的意圖是否將來會蓄意違反《國安法》。陳則表示，當時的想法是「視乎有咩人喺身邊」，他解釋：「如果依然有人繼續努力緊，例如李宇軒、黎智英，呢啲我認識嘅人都為咗香港努力緊，我諗我最尾都會做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方舉出數個情況，問陳是屬於哪一種情況，較極端的情況是有人不會再參與民主活動；另一個極端情況是有人認為反正最終都會被捕，所以不理會《國安法》，繼續做他們正在做的事情；介乎兩個極端之間的情況是，有人會在參與民主運動的時候考慮做什麼，避免觸犯《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳則回答，當時他向李宇軒說這番說話的時候，「我認為係要繼續推動制裁」，他解釋：「因為我當時覺得，連黎智英呢啲級數嘅人都可以無畏無懼，甚或乎以身作則，所以我覺得有啲嘢係應該做，但做到邊一步，當時我仲思考緊。」辯方追問陳是否有意違法，陳則表示：「我有咁嘅傾向，但係咪真係咁做，當時仲諗緊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華確認黎智英從沒叫他做違法事情&quot;&gt;陳梓華確認黎智英從沒叫他做違法事情&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，在《國安法》生效之後，陳有否向黎智英表明他及李宇軒會繼續做國際游說，以推動外國制裁香港官員。陳表示沒有。辯方指，在《國安法》生效之後，陳與黎智英從沒有討論過《國安法》的影響。陳亦確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，黎智英從沒有叫陳做任何違反《國安法》的事。陳確認。辯方又指，陳從沒有告訴黎，他會進行違法《國安法》的活動。陳一度問：「係咪包括我通過 Mark Simon？」法官李運騰則叫陳撇除他向 Mark Simon 說過的東西。陳遂回答沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，在《國安法》生效之後的任何時間，陳與黎智英從沒達成口頭協議，同意進行違反《國安法》的活動。陳同意沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華否認電話聲稱會安排李宇軒離港&quot;&gt;陳梓華否認電話聲稱會安排李宇軒離港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，李宇軒在2020年8月10日被捕，其後在8月12日從警署獲得擔保，同年8月23日在公海被內地公安拘捕，直至2021年3月22日才被移交回香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，根據李宇軒的證供，李從警署獲釋之後，陳梓華曾經在電話中聲稱會安排李離開香港，辯方問陳是否真有其事。陳則稱沒有發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問，在李宇軒從警署保釋直至他被內地公安拘捕之間，陳梓華有否與李聯絡過。陳稱有，是關於李談論自己去向、想借錢，以及在另一次通話中，「佢（李）講過佢如果有咩事，有咩想交低，例如佢叫我照顧佢屋企人，同埋佢都講過 Stand with Hong Kong（重光團隊）想點。」李亦有表示他想離開香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指稱李宇軒希望用重光團隊的錢走佬&quot;&gt;陳梓華指稱李宇軒希望用「重光團隊」的錢「走佬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「重光團隊」，陳引述，李宇軒當時稱「要繼續去打國際線，佢希望離開香港，咁佢就可以繼續 carry on」。陳又指李擔心沒有人留在香港，所以二人有談及日本線和美國線，「若然佢（李）真係走唔到，咁我又應唔應該走呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續稱，二人討論過李被捕之後可能對「重光團隊」的影響，因為李的手機內容全部會曝光。另外在一次視像會議中，有陳、李宇軒和劉祖廸參與，「佢（李）當時講走佬需要錢嘅時候，其實佢想用 Stand with Hong Kong 嘅錢，同埋想我哋籌錢畀佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華同意李宇軒扣留內地後-沒有轉告mark-simon的說話給李&quot;&gt;陳梓華同意李宇軒扣留內地後 沒有轉告Mark Simon的說話給李&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，在李宇軒被扣留內地期間，陳有否與李聯絡。陳反問：「包唔包括佢寫信呢？」辯方則表示較關注陳有否聯絡李，而陳回答：「佢喺公海被捕之後，冇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另一邊廂，陳昨日供稱他於2020年10月被捕並獲警方擔保之後，Mark Simon 曾透過 Signal Call 告訴他，要繼續民主運動和國際游說，以推動制裁，並叫陳有心理準備會再被警方以《國安法》罪名拘捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，當時李宇軒正在內地扣留，因此陳梓華從沒有將上述與 Mark Simon 的對話內容告訴李。陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華書面供詞稱mark-simon從沒要求或指示做任何事-惟今改口否認&quot;&gt;陳梓華書面供詞稱Mark Simon從沒要求或指示做任何事 惟今改口否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，陳梓華同意以證人身份協助本案之後，分別於2021年4月28、29和30日進行了四次錄影會面，並分別於2021年5月3、4、5日，以及2022年11月10日錄取了四份書面供詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，Mark Simon 從沒有要求或指示陳梓華做任何事情，問陳是否正確，惟陳不同意。辯方續指，陳過去曾經作出過以上陳述，惟陳稱：「我冇印象有講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示陳於2020年10月11日錄取的供詞，其時陳尚未同意協助案件，當中陳稱：「Mark Simon 由我認識佢到今天，所有嘢，佢從來冇要求過、指示過我去做某一樣嘢，從來都冇。」陳確認當時有說過，惟他否認以上反映當時立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華錄口供時稱mark-simon曾籲他生活重回正軌-惟今庭上改口稱是說謊&quot;&gt;陳梓華錄口供時稱Mark Simon曾籲他生活重回正軌 惟今庭上改口稱是說謊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另引述書面供詞，陳當時引述Mark Simon說：「你需要思考嘅係點樣將你嘅生活重回正軌，因為香港唔會再有呢啲咁大型嘅社會活動發生。」陳僅稱：「當時我係咁樣同警察講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問，陳以上供詞所述的內容是否真確。陳回答：「唔係。」辯方向陳提議，陳供詞聲稱 Mark Simon 籲他生活重回正軌，但如今在庭上卻指此部份不是真確，故陳的庭上說法是一個謊言。陳否認：「我唔同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方則向陳提議，Mark Simon 曾籲他生活重回正軌，這陳述是真確；但陳後來錄取另一些書面供詞時，卻向警察稱 Mark Simon 籲他繼續國際游說，並不是真確。陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華書面供詞稱李柱銘邀請他出席黎智英飯局因他非港獨或攬炒派&quot;&gt;陳梓華書面供詞稱李柱銘邀請他出席黎智英飯局因他非港獨或攬炒派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱，他於2019年7月在民主黨創黨主席李柱銘的邀請下出席飯局，並首次與黎智英親身見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提議，該次飯局有可能是在2019年10月而非7月發生，而二人首次以 WhatsApp 通訊是在飯局之後。惟陳不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示陳於2020年10月11日錄取的書面供詞，他當時向警察稱，他曾經問過李柱銘「點解佢會鍾意同我接觸呢？」，而對方的說法是，「佢覺得我唔係嗰啲攬炒，又唔係港獨嗰啲人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳則稱第一次見面時李柱銘沒有提及邀請他的原因，後來在2019年7月「攬炒團隊」進行「中英聯合聲明登報」行動期間，李柱銘才有向他提及邀請原因，「佢有講過我唔係港獨嗰啲人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾向警稱不認同攬炒並經常取笑-陳梓華庭上改口否認-並稱不是真話&quot;&gt;曾向警稱不認同「攬炒」並經常取笑 陳梓華庭上改口否認 並稱不是真話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;書面供詞亦顯示，陳當時向警方稱，李柱銘、黎智英和 Mark Simon「對於攬炒呢個概念係好負面嘅，佢哋係唔 buy 嘅」，陳又自言：「我本人都係唔 buy，因為我成日笑佢哋就係話，你話攬炒、攬炒，咁到𠵱家攬炒咗啲乜嘢出嚟呢？即係我都會調侃佢哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過，當辯方問及陳對「攬炒」的態度時，陳否認他「唔 buy」，又否認經常取笑、調侃那些想要「攬炒」的人。對於陳是否曾經向警方說過上述供詞，陳卻一概表示：「我冇印象」，又說：「我冇玩過任何攬炒嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂追問陳，當陳告訴警方他本人「唔 buy」攬炒概念，以及經常取笑和調侃想攬炒的人的時候，是否在說真話。陳回答：「我有笑攬炒呢個概念」，之後突然說：「因為我自己攬炒咗自己。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方再次問陳，書面供詞所述的說話是否真確。陳最後以英語回答：「False.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華3年前錄影會面稱被李柱銘介紹為和理非-惟今庭上稱沒有印象&quot;&gt;陳梓華3年前錄影會面稱被李柱銘介紹為「和理非」 惟今庭上稱沒有印象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，陳在首次與黎智英會面的飯局中，黎想知道陳是一名「和理非」還是主張使用暴力的人。陳確認。辯方續指，如果陳是主張使用暴力的人，黎便不會與陳交流；如果陳是一名「和理非」，黎便會與他交流。而李柱銘在席間告訴黎智英，陳並不是主張暴力的人，而是一名「和理非」。惟陳表示對此沒有印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方遂展示陳於2021年4月28日的錄影會面謄本，顯示陳當時向警察稱：「李柱銘好清晰咁話畀佢（黎）知其實我係一個和理非嚟嘅，咁佢（黎）就話『唔，咁好』。」惟陳則稱，他僅記得李柱銘介紹他是做登報行動和眾籌的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方質疑，直到今日，陳不能清晰地記得李柱銘向黎智英介紹他為一名「和理非」，而陳承認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指錄影會面距離今天約有3年，問陳是否同意如今他對第一次出席黎智英飯局的記憶不及3年前。陳則稱：「唔一定。」辯方質疑，陳的意思是否他的記憶會隨著時間流逝而變得更好？陳卻否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另外問陳是否勇武派一份子、是否示威的前線參與者，以及是否與暴力示威有關。陳一概否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英被捕對於「重光團隊」是沉重打擊 因失去美國政府內部消息及政治人脈&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/g5mNQCE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（24日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第65日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。《國安法》生效之後，黎智英於2020年8月10日被拘捕，陳當日向李宇軒傳送訊息，指一些商家和政治人物與黎「割𥱊」。陳解釋，黎被捕對於「重光團隊」來說是「一個好沉重嘅打擊」，因為「如果冇黎智英嘅話，我哋冇可能再知道美國政府內部嘅消息，亦都會冇晒佢喺美國或其他地方嘅政治人脈」，而黎的人脈可以協助「重光團隊」推動制裁及節省資源。他又表示：「我淨係覺得，好似樹倒猢散咁。」另外，陳梓華於2020年10月10日被捕，之後獲警方擔保，他引述黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 的說話：「叫我唔使擔心，佢話『我同黎智英會安排各方面嘅支援畀你，亦都會喺美國安排後路畀你』」，不過「叫我有心理準備，我會再次被拘捕，罪名係《國安法》，叫我唔使擔心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第七天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華要求李宇軒搭路會見美領事-冀李離開後接手其人脈&quot;&gt;陳梓華要求李宇軒搭路會見美領事 冀李離開後接手其人脈&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示陳梓華與李宇軒之間的 Signal 訊息，2020年8月3日，陳要求李聯絡時任美國領事館職員 Alan Brinker，以相約會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上解釋，當時他想李宇軒介紹香港的人脈給他認識，「因為當時有聲音或討論喺 Stand with Hong Kong（重光團隊，簡稱 SWHK）裡面，希望李宇軒能先行離開香港」，所以在當時而言，他認為他應該開始接手李的人脈。此外，SWHK 都想知道美國政府有什麼新意見，或者對DQ的看法，希望美國政府採取強硬的態度，「而當時大家期望見到嘅係制裁措施」，所以希望會見美領職員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有關 SWHK 的討論，陳稱主要是「攬炒巴」劉祖廸告訴他，因為李宇軒處理過數次眾籌，「佢手上有好多其他成員嘅資料，如果佢被捕的話，對於成個 SWHK 都係一個風險。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問為何他們覺得李宇軒有被捕風險。陳稱因為當時李已經參與 IPAC，亦在聯合國曝了光、到訪過美國，以及「好高調咁做過監選團」等，「所以當時我哋認為佢已經觸犯咗《國安法》。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，陳告訴李該會面是為了向美領事索取資訊（bumping info from him）。控方問，為何需要向美領事索取資訊。陳則稱：「因為當時黎智英教過我哋，就係我哋要知道外國政府嘅諗法，同埋要同啲枱底人建立關係⋯⋯當時 Alan Brinker，我諗算係半個枱底人」，因此從他身上得到一手資訊就變得很重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱若李宇軒離港會頂住佢個位-故視自己為領袖&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱若李宇軒離港會「頂住佢個位」 故視自己為「領袖」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月10日，黎智英被警方拘捕。李宇軒透過 Signal 問陳，是否需要把陳「踢」離開 Telegram 群組，又提到「每逢有人出事就會有人叫我同你快啲考慮走」；陳則回應「Brother」、「You know」、「As a leader」、「I have to be the last one standing」、「走走走，我若離開」、「誰來帶隊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳在訊息中自稱「領袖」是什麼意思。陳稱：「因為當時我哋都相信自己係領袖團隊裡面嘅領袖角色」，在眾多 SWHK 成員之中，「我哋係少數比較活躍，而李宇軒、劉祖廸、Shirley Ho 佢哋都各自領導住其中一條線。」陳又稱，「而我當時就已經同李宇軒傾過，當佢離開香港之後，就會由我頂住佢個位，喺香港。所以當時我有一種咁樣嘅自我感覺。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱李宇軒不肯離開香港-故出言相勸&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱李宇軒不肯離開香港 故出言相勸&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華同日稍後時間向李宇軒傳送訊息，叫李離開香港，並留下陳一個在香港，因為「我們承受不了國際線再失去多一人」：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Brother, leave me here - we can’t afford one more lost in international line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上解釋，「國際線」是指「Stand with Hong Kong 一直打緊嘅國際線」，而「我們」是包括整個 SWHK、黎智英及其私人助手 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱當時他與美國線的 Shirley Ho 討論過，她用了很多不同方法將李宇軒帶離香港，其中包括幫他找了一份美國的工作，也向他說了很多離開的理由，但李宇軒始終不肯離開香港。陳稱：「而根據我哋嘅默契，應該我係最後一個留喺香港嘅人，所以想勸佢離開香港。」陳傳送上述訊息之後，後來看新聞得悉李宇軒同日被捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳為何要在李宇軒離港後接手他的工作，陳稱：「因為若然喺香港冇人的話，就好難掌握到香港嘅情況；第二點係，如果我唔咁樣講，佢點都唔會走。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱失去黎智英是沉重打擊-因失去美國政府內部消息及人脈等&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱失去黎智英是沉重打擊 因失去美國政府內部消息及人脈等&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳另一則傳送給李的訊息「Some businessmen and politicians are cutting ties with Jim.」，陳解釋「Jim」即是代表黎智英（Jimmy Lai），「當時黎智英被捕，好多話會支持佢嘅人都同佢割𥱊，Mark Simon 話嗰時好 tough（艱難）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又稱：「如果冇黎智英嘅話，我哋冇可能再知道美國政府內部嘅消息，亦都會冇晒佢喺美國或其他地方嘅政治人脈」，而且，「曾經好統一嘅、喺國際線上嘅目標，之後就未必會咁統一。所以當時對於我哋嚟講，係一個好沉重嘅打擊。」他稱：「黎智英喺美國嘅政治人脈，可以協助到 Stand with Hong Kong 推動制裁，亦都令到 Stand with Hong Kong 節省到好多資源。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;他稱上述資訊是 Mark Simon 告訴他的，但他未有查問 Mark 所指的是哪些商人，「我淨係覺得，好似樹倒猢散咁」，所以他才會向李傳送這個訊息，「因為我唔想佢有事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱加入美國線群組有困難-後來在黎智英和mark-simon同意下成功入組&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱加入美國線群組有困難 後來在黎智英和Mark Simon同意下成功入組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，在2020年6月30日《國安法》生效之後，他與 Mark Simon 每星期至少透過電話聯絡一次，有時次數會更加多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱在2020年8月的時候，他與 Mark Simon 討論過李宇軒的情況，形容李「好頑固想留喺香港」，亦討論過陳加入 SWHK 美國線的 Telegram 群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又稱，「攬炒巴」劉祖廸曾向他表示「將我加入美國線（Telegram 群組）有啲困難」，因為他們已經有固定成員，「對於其他人嚟講，我係新人，咁我一直都冇喺 Stand with Hong Kong 其他群組好積極講嘢，因為我根本唔喺嗰啲群組入面」，然而其他人則由登報行動開始已經加入群組，大家合作了一段時間，所以劉祖廸認為把陳梓華加入群組有難度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指：「然後喺 Mark Simon 同黎智英嘅支持，同埋佢哋同意底下，最後我入到群組入面。」陳指劉祖廸告訴他，「如果 Mark Simon 同黎智英同意嘅話，咁我就會好講好多喇。」所以後來群組裡有一名叫「Madison」的用戶「會覺得我同黎智英嘅關係好密切。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後追問陳如何取得 Mark Simon 和黎智英的同意。陳則稱他在 Signal Call 中向 Mark Simon 解釋當時情況，「然後 Mark Simon 話佢會處理，然後我後來聯絡返劉祖廸嘅時候，佢話黎智英同 Mark Simon 同意，大家都冇反對。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱他在2020年6至7月之間被加入至 SWHK 美國線群組，從中發現群組負責人是 Shirley Ho，而且「我發現佢哋會定期每星期同 Mark Simon 報告返美國線做過啲咩」。當組員跟 Mark Simon 和政治顧問溝通之後，便會在群組中交代 Mark Simon 說過什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱佩洛西被邀加入ipac-曾問李柱銘意見&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱佩洛西被邀加入IPAC 曾問李柱銘意見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，他與 Mark Simon 另外談及「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC）。Mark Simon 曾告訴陳，在 IPAC 正式公布成立之前，創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）已經開始聯絡不同有份量的政治人物，包括時任美國眾議院議長佩洛西，而佩洛西向民主黨創黨主席李柱銘徵詢意見，而李柱銘則建議佩洛西不要加入IPAC，後來佩洛西亦沒有加入。陳指 Mark Simon 對此感到有點可惜，「Mark Simon 認為 IPAC 好重要，所以佢希望我都可以大力支持，去畀 IPAC。」陳又引述 Mark Simon 確是知悉「一直執行同埋實踐嗰個係李宇軒，所以佢覺得李宇軒離開香港係正確嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又稱，Mark Simon 當時「都想我落手落腳打國際線」，之前亦表示希望帶他到美國出席聽證會，但是疫情關係而做不到，「咁所以如果我入咗美國線嘅話，就可以有啲建樹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英和mark-simon認為被捕是好事-能令蘋果銷量上升&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英和Mark Simon認為被捕是「好事」 能令《蘋果》銷量上升&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黎智英於被捕一事，陳稱 Mark Simon 於2020年8月中曾經告訴他，「佢話佢同黎智英傾過，佢哋認為黎智英被捕，係一件好事，因為咁樣會令到更加多人關注，會令到《蘋果日報》銷量上升。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱二人亦談論李宇軒的工作，陳表示擔心李被捕會影響 IPAC，「啫係李宇軒搞咗個聯署，係反對《國安法》嘅，聲勢好浩大，然後亦都會擔心影響到 Stand with Hong Kong 嘅運作。」陳引述 Mark Simon 聽畢說：「唔使擔心，喺 Stand with Hong Kong 裡面，當時佢哋有 Plan B，就係推劉祖廸喺美國做巡迴演講，當時佢用嘅字眼係『college』，然後繼續去推廣攬炒嘅論述，同埋去推動制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，因為李字軒被捕之後，「忽然之間就少咗一個人喺前面衝」，若然劉祖廸可以在美國不同大學做一些演講，「起碼會令美國嘅人更加容易接受一啲反華嘅政策」，以及能夠引起關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英較支持美國共和黨-因有較持續反華政策&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英較支持美國共和黨 因有較持續反華政策&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱 Mark Simon 曾經解釋過美國民主黨及共和黨之間的分別，亦提及「佢（Mark Simon）同黎智英都係比較支持共和黨」，「因為佢哋相信共和黨有比較持續嘅反華政策，會繼續推出一啲制裁措施。」陳續指：「民主黨方面呢，就傾向同中國合作，例如就住氣候呀、環保呀、經濟，咁係不利我哋想達到嘅『支爆』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，Mark Simon 然後解釋為何要聘請政治顧問，因為共和黨黨員傾向較多是商家，所以基本上有錢「請得起」政治顧問，就可以跟這些共和黨黨員和官員會面。陳舉例，「黎智英曾經畀過一筆錢去請政治顧問，想去見彭斯。」此外，陳指：「民主黨方面呢，佢哋想要見一啲新嘅面孔，唔想再見到眾志或者係一啲舊學生領袖」，而 SWHK 當時是一個香港人自發的民間組織，而且是一個新組織，因此很符合美國民主黨的要求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指在《國安法》生效之後，SWHK 美國線接受 Mark Simon 的意見，聘請了一間比較親民主黨的政治顧問公司，然後接觸一些民主黨官員和「枱底人」，從而推動制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，SWHK 美國線亦接觸過一些政策評論員，「希望提醒呢啲政策評論員，香港嘅情況會威脅到美國喺香港嘅利益，咁就會令美國人更加反感，咁一啲制裁嘅措施，或者係對香港經濟不利嘅政策，就會更加容易通過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱李宇軒想透過mark-simon-打聽另一在日華人身份&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱李宇軒想透過Mark Simon 打聽另一在日華人身份&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就日本線，陳梓華稱在《國安法》生效之後，SWHK 協助日本議員山尾志櫻里成立 JPAC（Japanese Parliamentary Alliance on China），想推動馬格尼茨基法案（Magnitsky Act）；李宇軒亦和山尾合作，想推動一個「救生艇政策」，即是「可以收留香港嘅政治犯，或者係畀當時嘅香港抗爭者，雖然未定罪，可以居留喺日本」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當時他們認為《香港國安法》違反人權，「咁如果有咗 Magnitsky 的話，日本政府就有理據去制裁相關官員。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱他在2020年8至9月有將日本線的情況告知 Mark Simon，因為李宇軒告訴陳他遇到一名自稱「反華」的在日華人，聲稱可以幫助李，「但係當時李宇軒覺得有啲鬼」，所以透過陳向 Mark Simon 打聽該在日華人的身份，惟 Mark Simon 最終未有回覆陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華mark-simon及黎智英稱會安排美國後路-籲繼續做國際游說&quot;&gt;陳梓華：Mark Simon及黎智英稱會安排美國後路 籲繼續做國際游說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年10月10日，陳梓華被警方以「協助罪犯」罪名拘捕，之後獲警方擔保。陳稱，他從警署獲釋數天之後聯絡 Mark Simon，他引述對方說話：「叫我唔使擔心，佢話『我同黎智英會安排各方面嘅支援畀你，亦都會喺美國安排後路畀你』，然後佢會繼續喺美國同台灣呢啲渠道去打聽我案件嘅消息，叫我乜都唔使做。」陳續指，「但係就叫我有心理準備，我會再次被拘捕，罪名係《國安法》，叫我唔使擔心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱 Mark Simon 籲他「應該要繼續做國際游說嘅民主運動」，為了推動制裁。陳稱當時 Mark Simon 口中的「支援」是指法上的支援。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱直至2020年11月，他與 Mark Simon 再次聯絡，對方提及聘請了一名寫手替《蘋果日報》撰寫報導，關於當時美國總統候選人拜登的兒子在中國做生意，但後來該報導被指是假新聞，在美國當地可能會被視為干預大選，並且可能會引來美國聯邦調查局（FBI）調查，以及得失民主黨，所以 Mark Simon 與黎智英商討後，決定辭職，以免影響壹傳媒的利益，從而「保住壹傳媒」，「但係實際上，佢依然會喺美國同台灣繼續打點黎智英嘅生意，所以叫我唔使擔心佢。」如果陳想聯絡黎的話，可以繼續透過 Mark Simon 聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，當時沒有留意黎智英去向。被問到《國安法》生效之後有否與黎聯絡，陳表示：「暫時冇印象。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示完成了大部份的主問，因此向法庭申請提早休庭，以確保沒有遺漏之後才開始辯方盤問。案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華稱初選最初構思者為黎智英 且「背後做咗好多功夫」促成初選&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（23日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第64日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，控方展示陳與黎智英之間的訊息對話，在2020年7月初選結束之後，陳向黎發送訊息，感謝他為初選所做的一切。陳稱：「我諗我係少數人知道當初初選一直以嚟構思嘅係黎智英。」陳又指黎動用了大量人脈，以及媒體資源去協助初選舉行；而且當時並非所有人都同意初選的機制，以及爭議是否開放予所有人參與，「但係佢（黎）背後做咗好多功夫，最後促成咗初選。」此外，陳在2020年6月曾到壹傳媒大樓與黎見面，期間陳就《國安法》表達憂慮，並認為所有人不應該再繼續倡議制裁，惟陳引述黎稱：「《國安法》雷聲大、雨點小，佢唔會有事嘅。佢話佢會以身作則，會繼續喺唔同嘅媒體上面呼籲制裁同埋關注。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第六天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指當時國際線面對代表性問題-若黎智英引薦可增代表性&quot;&gt;陳梓華指當時國際線面對代表性問題 若黎智英引薦可增代表性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上周提到，黎智英在2020年1月8日透過 WhatsApp，向陳梓華傳送一篇裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）刊登於《蘋果日報》網站的文章連結。陳當時回覆稱他看過文章，認為可以幫助到他說服那些「頑固的領袖」；黎亦指文章值得閱讀，而「攬炒巴」劉祖廸也應該看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Laam Chau 🔥 https://t.co/VLScT2548V — Luke de Pulford (@lukedepulford) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lukedepulford/status/1315038772791214088&quot;&gt;October 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 裴倫德 Luke de Pulford（左）、劉祖廸（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今向陳出示裴倫德的文章，當中提及國際線上缺乏領袖會產生代表性的問題、國際社會需要知道香港人清晰的訴求、如果沒有國際支持的話香港人難以向北京爭取普選、要顧全大局及不要放棄等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，因為國際線並非鐵板一塊，但是當時沒有人能夠領導到國際線，而黎智英就想提供方向，以及團結「攬炒派」和國際線，從而令國際線有一個統一方向。此外，陳指反修例運動參與者一直都想匿名，但是很難在國際線上有代表性，而當時「攬炒團隊」和去過美國聽證會的人，都出現代表性的問題，但是如果有黎智英引薦或支持的話，他們在國際線上便能有代表性，外國官員和「枱底人」就會肯會見他們。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英轉發美國政府內部消息-不想暴力升級失國際支持&quot;&gt;黎智英轉發美國政府內部消息 不想暴力升級失國際支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年4月5日，黎智英向陳梓華轉發了美國政府的內部消息，當中稱美國政府關注示威者日益升級的暴力，包括汽油彈和爆炸品（“I was told the US is very concerned about new violence from demonstrators, increased threats from bombs/IEDs”），若有導致警察或市民死亡的話，便會使美國政府、國會和輿論疏遠運動，內部人士亦認同暴力對反修例運動構成嚴重威脅，既刺激北京亦失去美國政府的支持。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華指，黎智英曾提及過「國際游說的四個步驟」，其中之一是將外國的信息帶回香港，所以黎轉發這些訊息給他。陳又提到，當時「佢（黎）曾經講過勇武冇晒分寸，又冇組織嘅話，愈嚟愈濫用暴力，就會失去國際支持」，而上述訊息提及美國政府不想見到反修例運動愈來愈多暴力，正正是黎的關注點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示當時很想將訊息轉發給「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和李宇軒，因為劉與黎已經見過面，而劉清楚知道黎在國際線上的取態，但是他未必完全清楚美國政府的取態，所以便問黎能否轉發訊息給劉和李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱攬炒團隊非勇武派-但採取兄弟爬山各自努力態度&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱「攬炒團隊」非勇武派 但採取「兄弟爬山，各自努力」態度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，陳梓華當時會否視「攬炒團隊」是勇武派。陳表示他不會視「攬炒團隊」是勇武派，「佢對勇武派嘅態度係『兄弟爬山，各自努力』。」李官指，即是「攬炒團隊」視勇武派是「兄弟」，雙方追求同一個目標，但是採取不同的方法。陳指正確，「佢當時未必完全認同嗰啲好暴力嘅行動，但係佢唔會公開批評佢哋（勇武派），或者阻止佢哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於「兄弟爬山，各自努力」，陳的理解是勇武派採取較激烈的手段，但「老泛民」則想用較溫和的手段，然而基於大家都是爭取「五大訴求」，所以不應互相批評。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何想轉發美國內部消息給劉祖廸和李宇軒，陳表示因為當時他們都「打緊國際線」，他希望劉等人知道美國政府的取態，即是「佢（美國）唔認為制裁係唯一嘅途徑」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指國際線人士有共識跟黎智英方向-所以告知黎大家都努力做緊嘢&quot;&gt;陳梓華指國際線人士有共識跟黎智英方向 所以告知黎「大家都努力做緊嘢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月1日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送訊息，表示關心對方的健康狀況，又稱所有項目都正在進行中，他正努力地與各方聯繫（“All the projects still ongoing. Working very hard to liaise with different parties.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，「項目」是指「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）的幾條線，包括美國線、由李宇軒牽頭的日本線，以及劉祖廸帶領的英國線和北歐線。陳向黎傳送這個訊息的目的是「想話畀佢知大家都努力做緊嘢」，但是因為當時有新冠疫情，所以面對很多困難。陳稱他在訊息中表示希望在疫情結束後，能與黎合作，即去外國會見政府官員或「枱底人」，以推動制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何要讓黎知道陳正在做什麼，陳指「因為我哋當時已經有共識所有人都會跟住佢（黎）方向」，加上他從 Mark Simon 或李柱銘口中得知黎生病了，所以想告訴黎當時國際線的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英曾嘗試安排陳梓華等人赴台見唐鳳-惟最後沒成行&quot;&gt;黎智英曾嘗試安排陳梓華等人赴台見唐鳳 惟最後沒成行&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月，黎智英向陳梓華轉發訊息，顯示黎聯絡台灣《蘋果日報》社長陳裕鑫，嘗試安排「逆權運動年輕人陣營」到台灣與時任台灣行政院政務委員唐鳳和中華文化協會見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，當時 SWHK 內部討論過發展台灣線，但是他當時聯絡不到黎的私人助手 Mark Simon，所以便直接聯絡黎智英，而黎問他們想不想見唐鳳和中華文化協會。陳當時並不知道唐鳳是誰，後來在網上搜尋資料後知道他是當時的台灣官員。惟最後他們沒有成行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;人大公布立國安法後-陳梓華籲黎智英小心自身安全因認為他有法律風險&quot;&gt;人大公布立國安法後 陳梓華籲黎智英小心自身安全因認為他有法律風險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月21日，黎智英向陳梓華傳送人大公布實施《港版國安法》的新聞，並道：「仆街打到嚟喇！」陳之後回覆黎：「黎前輩：事情至今，已經難以逆轉形勢，我唯一擔心是你與 Martin 及你們家人的自身安全，萬事請以自身安全與事業存續為首要考慮。國安法主要針對境外內勇武人士，港獨份子及煽惑群眾人士。你務必謹慎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，他當時認為黎有法律風險，「因為當其時佢已經係指示緊我哋去做呢個制裁，然後佢自己本身亦都呼籲緊唔同嘅人去對抗個政府，所以我當時認為，《國安法》若然要拉人嘅話，第一個就係黎智英。」而訊息中「事業」是指「民主嘅事業」，「自身安全」即是黎會否被拘捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎智英其後回覆陳，籲他不要擔心個人安危，一旦站出來爭取自由，便要作戰至最後一刻，雖然未必會勝利，但必須堅持下去，更好的日子即將會來臨：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Let’s not worry about personal security. Once came out to join the fight for freedom one is prepared to fight to the last. We may not win but must persist. Don’t worry. Better days will come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，他理解黎上述訊息中的「堅持」意思是繼續抗爭及推動制裁，至於黎使用「我們」是想談論整個國際線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英李宇軒和劉祖廸等人在國際線上重要-為保留實力應在國安法之前離港&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英、李宇軒和劉祖廸等人在國際線上重要 為保留實力應在國安法之前離港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華其後回覆黎，表示他沒有退後的餘地，他有責任盡量保留最多的實力，也不會放棄，「如果你們倒下了，我會是最後一個站著的人」，最好的情況即將來臨：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There is no turning back for me and I do have a sense of duty to conserve our forces as much as possible. I won’t give up too. If all of you fall, I will be the last man standing. The best is yet to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，當時他認為如果黎和 Mark Simon 都被拘捕，只剩下他自己和李宇軒仍然在香港；然後如果李宇軒都被拘捕的話，那陳自己便是最後一個人，「我認為當時負責任嘅做法係，應該喺《國安法》之前將所有人送走，而我就係最後一個走，因為佢哋做咗好多嘢，而我一直都冇乜建樹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，為何在訊息中表示要保留實力。陳回答：「因為好似我咁做傳話嘅人，可以有好多人代替我，但係好似李宇軒、劉祖廸，甚或乎黎智英同埋 Mark Simon 呢種人，呢啲都係好難取代。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上顯示黎回覆陳，所以陳及其手足都很重要，又形容這是一場持久戰，陳是勝利的希望：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“That’s why you and your comrades are so important. This is going to be a long war and you are our hope of victory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;按陳的理解，黎的意思是陳、李宇軒、劉祖廸和其他SWHK團隊成員在國際線上很重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華傳送重光計劃眾籌資料給黎智英-冀黎幫忙宣傳&quot;&gt;陳梓華傳送「重光計劃」眾籌資料給黎智英 冀黎幫忙宣傳&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年5月28日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送一條「連登」討論區連結，題為〈【突發】攬炒過後是晨曦！攬炒團隊《重光香港計劃》眾籌上線！〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，當時因為 SWHK 的資金即將耗盡，劉祖廸一直想籌辦多一次眾籌，惟李宇軒覺得時機未到。直至2020年5月中的時候，二人聯絡陳，表示決定推出眾籌，陳雖然同意做法，但同時提醒二人，「之前 Mark Simon 講過，唔好再登實體報紙喇，可以做其他嘢，尤其係國際游說」，於是大家便開始構思如何在眾籌入面撥出部份資源做國際游說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他們最後決定在眾籌用途新增多一個選項，例如「多元重光計劃」，使他們運用眾籌款項時可以靈活一些。陳亦指「多元重光計劃」意思是採取不同手段達到目的，即是推動制裁或是倡議經濟封鎖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於為何要把「連登」討論區連結傳送給黎，陳指「因為要報告返畀佢知我哋做過啲咩」，更重要的是，當時擔心有人對國際游說反感，所以希望黎智英能夠幫手宣傳眾籌計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華mark-simon建議李宇軒不應以個人名義加入ipac-因國安法後會成為目標&quot;&gt;陳梓華：Mark Simon建議李宇軒不應以個人名義加入IPAC 因國安法後會成為目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，大約於2020年5至6月，李宇軒說想以個人身份加入「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC），聯盟創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）想組織不同國家的議員，協助他們就對華政策作出更好的判斷和應對，包括考慮採用更強硬措施或制裁。「當時佢（李宇軒）淨係話有個國際嘅反華組織」，並問陳應該以個人名義加入，還是以 SWHK 的組織名義加入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳徵詢 Mark Simon 意見之後，對方表示支持李加入 IPAC，但是若然李自己一個人加入，便「太過高調」，亦會得失當時的 SWHK 成員。此外，李在《國安法》生效之後可能「會成為目標，會好危險」，因此 Mark Simon 建議應該是整個 SWHK 加入 IPAC。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱他將 Mark Simon 的建議轉告李宇軒，李亦明白，後來整個 SWHK 以團體名義加入 IPAC。至於李的角色，陳指李一開始稱協助 IPAC 開設網站，但是「整整吓就做埋翻譯」，「同埋好似阿 Luke 嘅助手咁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華赴壹傳媒大樓會見黎智英-黎稱英文版可使蘋果有國際話語權&quot;&gt;陳梓華赴壹傳媒大樓會見黎智英 黎稱英文版可使《蘋果》有國際話語權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月16日，陳梓華到達將軍澳壹傳媒大樓與黎智英會面。會面之前，陳由黎的私人司機接載往壹傳媒大樓，因為希望避開所有鏡頭，「佢（黎）亦都擔心畀人見到佢同年輕嘅抗爭者有聯繫，或者令我嘅身份曝光，咁佢都唔想。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指在會面期間，黎稱當時《蘋果日報》不斷蝕錢，所以需要商業上的支持；加上黎正在籌辦英文版，所以需要大量資金去營運：「佢（黎）當時話呢個英文版相當於一個國際版，就係畀外國人睇嘅。雖然係蝕錢，但係對於佢嚟講好有價值。」控方追問為何黎認為英文版有價值。陳則引述黎說，「如果《蘋果日報》有英文版嘅話，就可以好直接同埋好快咁畀到一手資訊，去畀外國嘅枱底人睇到，咁佢哋可以作出更加有利黎智英政治理念嘅判斷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續解釋，外國的「枱底人」閱讀《蘋果》英文版的時候，可以得知《蘋果》所形容的香港及《蘋果》所提供的資訊，「咁會有預設嘅立場」，然後「枱底人」會就此寫報告給官員，去決定是否實施制裁或其他措施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又引述黎說，英文版可以令《蘋果》由一個本地傳媒變成國際傳媒，「咁喺國際上面就更加有國際話語權，同埋會有更加多人關注。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英稱國安法雷聲大雨點小-揚言繼續在媒體上呼籲制裁&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英稱國安法「雷聲大，雨點小」 揚言繼續在媒體上呼籲制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，會面中二人談及《國安法》，他自己有表達憂慮，「我認為應該要褪（讓步）」，即是所有人不應該再繼續倡議制裁；「但係佢（黎）就係話，《國安法》雷聲大、雨點小，佢唔會有事嘅。佢話佢會以身作則，會繼續喺唔同嘅媒體上面呼籲制裁同埋關注。」陳引述黎籲「我都應該係咁」，又籲他叫其他人繼續在文宣和國際線上工作，以及要支持初選。惟陳當時回應黎「其實當時好難再做文宣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;二人談及 IPAC，陳稱黎問他為何不加入 IPAC，「佢（黎）覺得 IPAC 好重要，一定要有呢啲國際支持，先會有用。」黎又提及他如何幫到年青人，「佢話佢已經同美國嗰邊傾緊」，惟黎未有詳述當中討論了什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年7月，陳指 Mark Simon 告知他，「黎智英喺美國嗰度，喺 HKDC（香港民主委員會）嘅協助底下，咁就整咗個避風港法案。」陳解釋，該法案集中幫助年青抗爭者，「如果做咗政治犯之後呢，佢哋都可以喺美國嗰邊生活，所以年輕抗爭者可以繼續放心抗爭。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱初選構思者為黎智英-動用大量人脈媒體資源協助初選&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱初選構思者為黎智英 動用大量人脈、媒體資源協助初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英與陳梓華之間的 Signal 對話，2020年7月12日初選之後，陳向黎說，感謝他為初選所做的一切，形容這是香港歷史上重要的一頁：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Hi Jimmy, thanks for everything on the primary election. It’s remarkable on our HK history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何傳送上述訊息，陳稱：「我諗我係少數人知道當初初選一直以嚟構思嘅係黎智英。」而且他認為初選「搞得好成功」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問黎在初選上做了什麼。陳則指黎動用了大量人脈，以及媒體資源去協助初選舉行。控方追問「動用人脈」的意思是什麼。陳稱當時並非所有人都同意初選的機制，以及爭議是否開放予所有人參與，「但係佢（黎）背後做咗好多功夫，最後促成咗初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當控方追問黎做了怎樣的「功夫」時，陳則表示：「呢方面我唔清楚。」但他可以肯定的是，無論是與黎智英還是 Mark Simon 的會面中，「佢哋都不約而同、好具體咁講到，佢哋會用傳媒去支持政治素人去參加初選，令到成個初選更加有認受性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

Borders could not stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, but Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine demonstrated that the kinds of national wars that characterized the 20th century were still relevant.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ideology has faded, and the states of the Global South have grown larger and wealthier. They now expect a larger share of the global pie. While cooperation has become more necessary, the world has entered an era of increased national contestation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this CSIS report, Jon B. Alterman and Lily McElwee argue that robust multilateral cooperation is central to creating opportunities and improving global conditions. Layers of organizations that bring together like-minded governments, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations across multiple venues and alliances will be necessary to tackle the complexity of today’s international challenges. The report draws from a series of meetings CSIS conducted with 30 senior experts around the world throughout 2022 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wars reveal fault lines in international relations. They raise stakes, they bring government decisions under greater scrutiny, and they force governments to decide whom to support and whom to oppose. Wars cause governments to appeal to other governments for aid, and when that aid is not forthcoming, governments’ actions — and inaction — send their own messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine was a clarifying moment. Over the previous three decades, economic integration had sharply increased around the world, global living standards rose dramatically, and connectivity blurred international boundaries and allowed billions of people to tap into almost limitless pools of information at almost no cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, in some ways, was a consequence of that world. A disease that began in a provincial capital in China became a global phenomenon within weeks. National and international organizations mobilized to encourage the development and distribution of vaccines, and international financial institutions buttressed shaky economies. While the costs of the pandemic were astronomical — one estimate put its cost in the United States alone at $16 trillion — and supply chains were shattered, the pandemic did not force a breakdown in international ties, let alone anything resembling armed conflict. Many states felt abandoned by the international system, yet that system endured without deep scarring. China is the largest trading partner of 120 countries, and the United States is both an innovator and a norm-setter. Size insulated both. It was unthinkable not to seek ways to work with China to manage the consequences, frustration, and anger that the pandemic provoked, or to cut U.S. ties over dissatisfaction with vaccine distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the Ukraine invasion was a sign that old patterns of conflict persisted. Tanks rolled and missiles flew. Soldiers died — as did tens of thousands of civilians. The United States worked to rally global support to push back on Russia, with mixed results. Much of Europe was enthusiastic about aligning with the United States on a threat to regional security, while China was circumspect about giving a boost to U.S. global hegemony. U.S. partners in Northeast Asia, such as Japan and South Korea, hewed closely to the U.S. line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for many governments — including many with close ties to the United States — the war in Ukraine was not their fight. Some, such as Israel and Turkey, had complicated relations with Russia that inhibited their action. But many others saw little advantage in being drawn into rising “great power” competition. These governments did not see Russia’s invasion as a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty that threatened the principle of sovereignty everywhere. Instead, many viewed it as part of a century-long shadow war between the United States and Russia, exacerbated by a reckless Ukraine. Others still saw it merely as a tiresome continuation of centuries of European warfare intended to nudge borders one way or the other. In this view, the insistence on stark national boundaries combined with the narcissism of small differences to make conflict inevitable, with states once again fighting to unite isolated minorities with their purported homeland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States proclaimed the importance of defending a rules-based order, these countries said they saw something more self-interested at stake: a U.S. effort to preserve decades-old advantages for the United States and its closest partners. They saw these advantages continuing to enrich a small number of countries at the expense of an increasingly populous, increasingly wealthy, and increasingly consequential fraction of the world’s population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not merely U.S. competitors who seek to portray the global order this way. Close partners to the United States increasingly question the indispensability of U.S. leadership, as well as its wisdom and durability. Decades of long and inconclusive wars, increasingly polarized U.S. politics, and ever larger oscillations between successive U.S. administrations’ foreign policies have led many governments to be more cautious. But another element is many governments’ insistence on recovering their own agency and on advancing their own self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While the United States proclaimed the importance of defending a rules-based order, these countries said they saw something more self-interested at stake: a U.S. effort to preserve decades-old advantages for the United States and its closest partners.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world today is at a crossroads. Rising global integration has exacerbated challenges that swiftly transcend borders. Disease, climate change, the trafficking of persons and goods, and informal migration are just a few of the issues that no government can solve in isolation. Similarly, an increasing number of economies are tied to changes in transportation, communication, and finance that elide distance and connect cosmopolitan centers to remote villages and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite closer ties, we also have entered a new period of national contestation. While greater connection is broadly irreversible, the terms of those connections, the boundaries of acceptable behavior, the structures of coordination, and the methods to resolve differences and enforce agreements are all increasingly in question. Great powers have given up the struggle over ideology, which consumed the middle of the twentieth century. Yet, they struggle to control norms of international behavior as much as they ever did. Equally importantly, although the world’s largest economies remain dominant, rising powers have a greater share of money and influence than ever before. They are increasingly assertive in their efforts to reshape the international order and to take their own measure of what advances their interests, irrespective of the demands of great power partners — and especially of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structures needed to handle this emerging reality will be even more complicated and cumbersome than those that emerged at the end of World War II. Rather than tightly integrated blocs of states bound by mutual treaty obligations, we are moving toward a world in which each state must coordinate a wide range of overlapping ad hoc ties. While this system produces more friction, it also holds the promise of bringing every country into a web of interlocking relationships. For the United States and its partners, the challenge is not to resist this trend, but rather to ensure that the benefits of this comprehensiveness compensate for the complexity of these networks and the efforts required to maintain them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report will begin with an overview of the frameworks for internationalism and international cooperation, many of which have roots that are centuries old. It will then consider the strategies that great power competitors have adopted to limit the constraints that internationalism might place on their actions. The discussion then turns to the growing salience of the Global South: not only are such countries gaining in income, population, and power, but their cooperation is necessary to address a widening array of global issues. Alternative structures for international cooperation are considered, as is the potential incorporation of nontraditional participants into multilateral cooperation (such as nongovernmental organizations and the business community). After a brief consideration of the strategic shape of the future, the paper concludes that much more robust engagement across a range of modalities would deliver better outcomes for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-origins-of-internationalism&quot;&gt;The Origins of Internationalism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multilateral institutions are a recent innovation. Early multilateral efforts such as the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia and the 1814 Congress of Vienna were exercises in conflict management with a narrow remit on issues of warfare, and neither did much to coordinate European powers’ pursuit of common interests. Yet, sharply increased communication, travel, and trade in the nineteenth century forced new modalities. The International Telegraph Convention in 1865 and the Universal Postal Convention in 1874 helped integrate communications networks. The First International Sanitary Conference in 1851 was a European effort to standardize quarantine regulations against the spread of cholera, plague, and yellow fever, in a clear recognition of the importance of international cooperation in combating contagious disease. The latter effort took four decades, as periodic gatherings of scientists and diplomats finally led to an agreement to notify fellow member states of disease outbreaks and to comply with internationally recognized disease prevention procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The innovation here was that the resultant agreements legally bound the signatories, each of which benefited from the compliance of the whole. While accession was mostly limited to Europe, the expansive global footprint of Western powers gave even intra-European sanitary efforts global impact. In addition, many of these early agreements and conventions created durable institutions for follow-up, enforcement, and further cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trend toward “structural” multilateralism, which created legally binding obligations on participants, picked up after World War I. International conventions on topics such as narcotics, trafficking in persons, citizenship, and trade then led to binding agreements. But it was in the decades following World War II that structural multilateralism really took off. From the ashes of a war that was genuinely global, a flurry of treaty-based international organizations was created that aspired to be genuinely universal. The UN General Assembly was the most sweeping of them, but agreements and institutions flourished, expanding their reach in issues from public health to economics to aviation, both within UN-affiliated structures and well beyond them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Coalitional internationalism” grew in the same period. These more flexible modes of international engagement allow groups of countries to coordinate efforts to advance individual and collective preferences outside the constraints of treaty-based multilateral institutions. The first G-grouping, the G7 group of market democracies, was initiated in 1975, and it provided an avenue for ideologically like-minded and economically compatible countries to bring their political leaderships together. Twenty-four years later, in the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis, the G20 brought together finance ministers and central bankers from the world’s 20 largest economies. In 2009, it began to gather political leaderships, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some coalitions are even more ad hoc. Indeed, the George W. Bush administration hailed its “coalition of the willing,” encompassing the countries offering either military or political support during the 2003 war in Iraq and the subsequent U.S. military presence there. The United States has been an especially effective convener of such ad hoc groups. As Stewart Patrick has written, informal arrangements outside multilateral institutions provide the “world’s most powerful country . . . greater maneuvering room and control over outcomes” than formal multilateral institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great strength of structural internationalism is found in its normative qualities. International organizations embody values and teach them forward to new leaders. Yet, that same structure simultaneously creates weakness, as these institutions are only as strong as the signatory states are willing to tolerate. Powerful signatory nations determine in advance what remit they will tolerate in the new institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These same institutions have also succumbed to a creeping brittleness over time. Treaty-based international institutions rarely reopen the founding framework to adapt to changing power dynamics in the world. For example, the UN Security Council still awards veto rights to the same five countries it did three-quarters of a century ago, representing the victorious powers in World War II. Those five countries did represent the center of mass of geopolitical power in 1946. But while the rise of new global and regional powers — Japan, Germany, India, and Brazil, just to name a few — brings a new power geometry, the Security Council remains frozen in time. In the views of one close observer, “To a growing proportion of the world’s governments and citizens, the council today is both feckless and unjust, dominated by irresponsible and unrepresentative powers inclined to abuse their position rather than safeguard the peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the views of one close observer, “To a growing proportion of the world’s governments and citizens, the council today is both feckless and unjust, dominated by irresponsible and unrepresentative powers inclined to abuse their position rather than safeguard the peace.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;objections-from-great-power-competitors&quot;&gt;Objections from Great Power Competitors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even to those who are super-empowered by the post–World War II institutions, those institutions’ arrangements can appear problematic. While one can argue that they have given primacy to both China and Russia — especially in the case of the UN Security Council — both countries remain wary of a world in which U.S. wealth and military strength, when combined with that of Europe, gives the United States hegemonic power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, what many in the United States have come to refer to as the “rules-based international order” is, in practice, the postwar, U.S.-led liberal order. It was united by three things: overwhelming U.S. global power, a U.S. commitment to ensure that benefits were widely shared among its adherents, and a durable threat to that order by an ideological challenger with universal aspirations. For U.S. allies and partners, the United States and the system it advanced served as both a benefactor and protector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because both Moscow and Beijing appear convinced that — even after the end of the Cold War — U.S. strategy remains predicated on seeking their weakness and isolation, each has adopted a three-pronged strategy: to aggressively defend their interests in existing multilateral organizations, to invest in newer multilateral organizations that exclude the United States from membership and in which they have relative primacy, and to align more closely with what they see as a “rising Global South” and enlist those countries in an effort to challenge U.S. hegemony. The stated goal of this behavior is not so much to undermine global order writ large as it is to ensure that the order that emerges is not a unipolar, U.S.-led one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENSURING THEY ARE NOT A TARGET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first prong of that effort has deep roots. Cold War skirmishes colored the early days of the Security Council, and difficulties resolving the Berlin blockade in 1948–1949 were an early indicator that the council “was not likely to be an operational body.” Division persisted through four decades, although the end of the Cold War and the global response to 9/11 created an unprecedented sense of common purpose among the great powers. That sense of optimism crashed with the Arab Spring in 2011. In the early days of the Libyan civil war, in response to the Qaddafi regime’s use of lethal force against civilian protestors, the Security Council authorized a no-fly zone over Libya, as well as “all necessary measures” to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas. It was the council’s first authorization of military force based on the responsibility to protect (RTP) doctrine. Vigorous lobbying by important regional bodies such as the Arab League and the African Union persuaded Russia and China to abstain, rather than veto the resolution in March 2011. But Moscow and Beijing soon regretted their unexercised vetoes, given the scope of NATO’s ensuing air campaign and what they saw as a clear end goal of toppling Qaddafi’s government. For these capitals, U.S. enthusiasm to support citizens rebelling against an authoritarian government was both naïve and threatening: naïve because the United States did not appreciate how the crushing of governments would unleash radical forces, and threatening because they identified with the authoritarian governments that swiftly fell. They had learned their lesson and would no longer leave the United States and its partners a loophole to wage war under UN sanction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, the West’s focus on the Russian war in Ukraine has heightened global divisions. In March 2022, a Russian-sponsored Security Council resolution demanding civilian protection and unhindered humanitarian access in Ukraine was only able to garner Chinese support. Thirteen other Security Council members abstained and defeated the measure, arguing that the most straightforward way to relieve civilian suffering was for Russia to end its assault on Ukraine. Russia has complained loudly of a double standard, since the United States and its allies went into Iraq in 2003 absent a UN mandate. But this complaint has aligned with a resentment throughout much of the world that Ukraine garners so much attention and resources from the West, while the rest of the world’s problems — from security to economics to refugees to disease — are seemingly neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been more circumspect in its efforts to engage in the United Nations. It has joined about half of Russian vetoes in the Security Council since 2000 (generally on Syria), and it has not cast any vetoes independently since that time. Unlike Russia, which has pursued a visible course of confrontation and disruption, China has worked assiduously to develop what some analysts call “discourse power.” That is, China seeks to have phrases that the Chinese Communist Party favors — such as “shared future” and “win-win cooperation” — incorporated into UN documents, while lining up countries to support noninterference in China’s internal affairs. As James Kynge wrote in the Financial Times in August 2023, “rather than seeking to create a whole new order, Beijing’s aim is to repurpose the UN’s authority to more squarely serve China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In so doing, China’s approach is to defang the United Nations and to make it a friendlier venue for Chinese power. What is notable about China’s efforts, especially in contrast to Russia’s, is China’s seeming interest in inserting its ideas into the UN process rather than bending the organization to its will. In this way, China seeks to legitimize alternate paradigms of governance and human security that in turn legitimize China, rather than seek to delegitimize efforts that the Chinese see as seeking to delegitimize China. The value proposition, from a Chinese perspective, is that many developing countries gain legitimacy through these Chinese-supported paradigms and see them as ammunition against Western hegemony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, China’s actions serve to resurrect patterns of relations that prevailed in East Asia for centuries. According to one account:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Sovereignty,” when the term is applied in Asian history, was mostly divisible, layered, and relative, as were allegiance, loyalty, and subjection. So the package that comes with the modern concepts and language of sovereignty, statehood, legitimacy, and the like impedes real understanding of the past and often only serves to legitimize political agendas in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seen through this prism, China is not seeking to displace the United States but rather to build support for an order that plays to Chinese strengths, gives China primacy in its near abroad, and allows for ambiguity in ways that increase Chinese power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China is not seeking to displace the United States but rather to build support for an order that plays to Chinese strengths, gives China primacy in its near abroad, and allows for ambiguity in ways that increase Chinese power.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENHANCED MULTILATERALISM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second prong of Beijing’s and Moscow’s approach is to pursue a wide range of newer multilateral groupings — BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Collective Treaty Security Organization, and a whole range of others. Generally centered in Asia, these organizations work on issues running the gamut from security to trade. While some incorporate U.S. allies and partners, none are centered around them, and they have the collective impact of creating organizations where U.S. influence is only indirect (if it exists at all). One could argue that these are both the appropriate and necessary counterparts to the sorts of U.S.-led institutions — starting with NATO and continuing to the World Bank and beyond — that the United States has created for three-quarters of a century. One could also argue that such organizations are focused on issues and countries that the United States and its closest partners neglect but that are nevertheless important to participants. Of course, their incorporation of countries that the United States and its allies sanction — not only Iran and increasingly Russia, but also several countries in Central Asia — helps reduce these countries’ isolation. The steady expansion and invigoration of such organizations in recent years has the effect of diminishing U.S. global predominance even if it does not necessarily enhance Russian and Chinese influence. For both Russia and China, even that can represent a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALIGNMENT WITH THE GLOBAL SOUTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third prong may be the most potent, and that is to seek alignment with rising powers that are deeply dissatisfied with the global status quo. Many in the Global South have come to resent what they see as the presumptiveness of wealthier nations. This attitude was well-captured by a remark the Indian minister of external affairs made in Bratislava in early June 2022: “Europe has to grow out of the mindset that Europe’s problems are the world’s problems, but the world’s problems are not Europe’s problems.” Former Indian national security adviser Shivshankar Menon argued in a recent piece in Foreign Policy that for many states in the Global South, “the existing order does not address their security needs, their existential concerns about food and finances, or transnational threats such as climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Many in the Global South have come to resent what they see as the presumptiveness of wealthier nations.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, there is a widespread sense that Western powers have used the status quo to advance their own narrow interests. As a former Arab foreign minister remarked, “The West, with America at its lead, basically believed it has the right to American exceptionalism, and it has used force outside of its borders much more than anybody else over the years, and frequently without any legal basis.” Resentment of a double standard has manifested itself in complaints about Western support for Israel as it sought to push Hamas from Gaza in the autumn of 2023. Many in the Global South saw the war as yet another attack on Palestinians, with scant attention to international humanitarian law or the laws of war. Seen this way, Western states emphasize these rules only when they serve Western interests and conveniently ignore them when it suits their purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions policy is another area where many states in the Global South believe that Western-led efforts to enforce global rules are merely a cover for advancing narrow Western interests. As sanctions have emerged as an increasingly important part of the Western tool kit to shape international behavior, the growing instinct among a widening array of countries is to find ways to circumvent sanctions (either through explicit sanctions evasion or through efforts to develop payment methods that do not touch dollar-based institutions and are thus insulated from U.S. enforcement efforts). Chinese-Iranian trade is strong, and China is the destination for about two-thirds of Iranian oil exports. In the Ukraine case, we see not only robust Russia-China trade despite U.S.-led sanctions against Russia, but also steep increases in Russian trade with India, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. While these countries argue that, rather than taking the Russian side, they are preserving their neutrality, the assertion of neutrality in the face of Western unanimity to advance norms and values undermines the centrality of those norms and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid sentiment that global institutions are ineffective in addressing the world’s most important challenges — and that the countries empowered by those institutions contributed to creating those problems in the first place — China and Russia invoke their own narratives of struggle against the wealthier nations of the West and sharpen their own grievances. Even if not seen as either exemplars or saviors, Russia and China can build some currency with states that share their distrust of Western intentions and their suspicion that Western prescriptions will leave them permanently lagging behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-salience-of-the-global-south&quot;&gt;The Salience of the Global South&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plainly put, the support of countries in the Global South is vital to the world’s ability to address a widening array of global problems. The complexity and interrelationships of global challenges, expanding economies, rising mobility, and the sheer population of the nations making up the Global South make them vital partners. Yet, many factors conspire to undermine cooperation: the Global South’s lingering historical grievances, a strong belief in the continued unfairness of the distribution of wealth and power, and a concern that the Global North’s regulations will sabotage the Global South’s urgent need for economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time of rising great power tensions, the North-South divide can serve both to exacerbate global challenges and undermine efforts at collective action to address shared priorities. Yet, while the Global North often considers the Global South an exception, for most people in the world, the Global South is the norm. It constitutes some 80 percent of the world’s population and an increasing share of the global economy. Whereas in 2000 the countries constituting the Global South represented about 40 percent of world GDP, the OECD estimates that the global economy was equally divided in 2010, and the Global South will constitute almost 60 percent of world GDP in 2030. Large populations in India and China are a driver here, and governments in both places have lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. These countries are not wealthy, however, and wealth as it has become known in the Global North may perpetually elude them. In fact, the number of countries that have followed Western patterns of development and economic growth in the last century and achieved wealth as a consequence is small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s and the years since, leaders in the Global South have accused bankers from the Global North of profiting while millions of their countrymen continue to toil. As they see it, a generally impoverished Global South provides raw materials and cheap manufactured goods to the Global North, while scarce southern funds flow north for technology and services that the Global North insists are necessary to compete internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China, especially, has sought to enhance its reputation as a country that brought hundreds of millions out of poverty by following its own star. Keenly conscious of the country’s “century of humiliation” at the feet of many of the same global powers that retain influence in the global system today, China puts forward its remarkable growth over the last 30 years as a model and inspiration for its partners. In addition, China’s emergence as a “near peer” to the United States despite very different values, political systems, and economics represents to many a crack in the purported monopoly of G7 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEYOND THE G7 PURVIEW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For countries with established global leadership, many of their most vexing problems intimately link the Global North with the Global South and will require broader engagement between them. Migration is one such issue. Disease, climate change, and economic despair all drive people to leave what they know and seek better lives elsewhere. For some in the Global North, large immigrant communities from the Global South represent an incipient threat, bringing crime and extremism and threatening national cohesion. At the same time, some of those leaving the Global South are among the most highly skilled and trained of their population. They can gain entry to wealthier countries, earn higher pay and benefits, and enjoy a brighter future than in their countries of birth. As a consequence, their departure can make it harder for the Global South to develop local solutions, and it can perpetuate the Global South’s dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For countries with established global leadership, many of their most vexing problems intimately link the Global North with the Global South and will require broader engagement between them.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, a much larger fraction of the displaced never make it out of their own country, or out of neighboring states. The United Nations estimates that, at the end of 2015, more than 85 percent of the world’s 16 million refugees, and more than 90 percent of the 64 million people forced from their homes around the world, remained in their regions of origin. Overwhelmingly, those areas of war and displacement are located in the Global South. And while states in the Global South are legally bound by international norms on refugee treatment — including but not limited to the principle of non-refoulement, which bars the forcible return of refugees — they have no leverage to elicit support from northern states to abide by their respective normative obligations. Put quite simply, the “stronger actor has little direct interest in cooperating, and the weaker actor has so little bargaining power that it can either accept what is offered or disengage entirely,” in this case taking “what is offered or simply harm[ing] themselves by refusing all assistance for the refugees they host.” Their option is to appeal to other interests of the Global North. The most obvious is allowing an increase in irregular migration, which has its own political impacts in destination countries. Appealing to destination countries’ security interests that the origin countries can hold at risk is also in play. What is clear is that this is an area of tension that needs to be managed — between wealthier states that wish to keep the bulk of the challenge at arm’s length and poorer states that feel they bear the brunt of the burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADAPTATION, LOSS, AND DAMAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many middle- and low-income countries, the unfolding of the global energy transition is a manifestation of their disenfranchisement. Resentful that wealthy countries became wealthy without any constraints on their emissions (and oftentimes while exploiting raw materials in the developing world), some complain that they, too, should be allowed to pursue industrialization and urbanization at the lowest possible cost, irrespective of emissions. As they look at the increased costs of electrifying their economies, reducing agricultural burning, cleaning up industries, and moving away from domestic coal and toward either imported fuels or renewable infrastructure with imported components, they feel entitled to financial support for their economies to transition to a low-carbon future. In addition, many seek external support for adaptation — that is to say, making their countries survivable through a period of greater weather extremes, which they see as brought on by centuries of rampant emissions growth from the world’s wealthiest economies. A 2009 UN commitment to “mobilize” $100 billion per year for developing countries, set to expire in 2025, fell well short of its goal, but also well short of projected needs. According to a recent UN analysis, “developing countries require at least $6 trillion by 2030 to meet less than half of their existing Nationally Determined Contributions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large as these numbers are, another issue is liability for losses and damages suffered as a consequence of climate change. For example, 2022 floods in Pakistan alone may have inflicted $40 billion in losses, destroyed more than two million houses, and damaged 13,000 km of roads. Every study suggests that the worst is yet to come. One estimate calculates that loss and damage from climate change in the developing world will total between a half-trillion and one trillion dollars by 2040, and between $1.1 and $1.7 trillion by 2050; an even more expansive study puts the toll at $4 trillion by 2030. And those are just the fiscal costs. A growing body of work seeks to assess the non-economic sources of loss and damage, including loss of territory, cultural heritage, indigenous knowledge, biodiversity, and a host of other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For affected states, the math is compelling. Pakistan contributes less than 1 percent of global carbon emissions, yet it is at profound risk for catastrophic loss due to climate change. Similarly, Africa contributes less greenhouse emissions than other continents, but 1.2 billion Africans are among the people most susceptible in the world to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At issue, then, is not merely what countries will do to restrict their carbon emissions. There are a whole host of questions of who will pay the cost of adopting new energy systems, who will pay for adaptation to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters, who will pay the costs of natural disasters (and who will determine which of those have human causes, and how much of a role human activity played), and how countries will be compensated for other forms of loss that they suffer. Many wealthier countries argue that they not only have their own impressive climate-related costs to pay but have also already put billions of dollars into developing countries. At least some argue that “one reason people living in poor countries remain especially vulnerable to climate change is because government thievery and incompetence have held back the economic growth,” and that even if there were a large financial commitment by wealthier states, “very little of the money would likely reach the citizens who are suffering the brunt of weather disasters.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No formula can resolve the host of issues that have disproportionate impact in the Global South, and there will continue to be significant disagreement over the terms of their resolution. As the Global South gains in income, population, and power, however, its voice in the handling of those issues will rise. Up to now, Russia and China have put significant efforts into cultivating support in those states, arguing that what they need is a departure from the status quo that the United States and its allies and partners have imposed. The resultant solidarity gives some benefit to the affected states, while also providing benefit to Russia and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-forms-of-cooperation&quot;&gt;Other Forms of Cooperation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important and populous though the rest of the world is, the world’s largest economies — and its largest military powers — retain outsized influence in global affairs, and they have a unique ability to genuinely threaten each other’s security. In recent years, many have proposed that major powers — including but certainly not limited to the United States and China — create an ongoing process of dialogue and consensus building. The Concert of Europe inspired one suggestion, put forward by then–Council on Foreign Relations president Richard Haass, that “concert members recognized their competing interests, especially when it came to Europe’s periphery, but sought to manage their differences and prevent them from jeopardizing group solidarity.” Haass and coauthor Charles Kupchan envisioned a permanent headquarters with representatives from China, Russia, the United States, India, Japan and the European Union, along with observers from four regional organizations: the African Union, the Arab League, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the Organization of American States. Their goal was creating a system that provided both “political inclusivity and procedural informality,” eschewing both the democracy-promoting inclusivity of the G7 and the sometimes-excruciating diplomatic exactitude of the G20, to create “major power consensus on the international norms that guide statecraft.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvard professors Dani Rodrik and Stephen Walt put forward another proposal, in which major powers would agree to place issues in one of four buckets: prohibited actions, actions in which states agree to alter their behavior in exchange for others’ altered behavior, actions which states can take unilaterally, and actions whose efficacy requires broad multilateral compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both proposals seek to build some guardrails around areas of mutual cooperation, ensuring that competition among major powers — let alone antagonism — does not undermine actions that advance mutual benefit. Yet, in periods of sustained conflict and low trust, countries tend to ascribe malign intent to even benign initiatives of their adversaries. This is in part because countries tend to see themselves as the central focus of adversaries’ foreign policies, and thus see adversaries’ efforts to thwart them as the central motivation of their actions. But it is also because, in low-trust environments, agreements are presumed to contain loopholes and trapdoors that advantage adversaries at their expense. While a focus on advancing shared interests is constructive — and, frankly, at the core of every diplomat’s tool kit — it is unrealistic to think that any single organization or dialogue structure can make significant headway between major powers when they are at loggerheads. Similarly, when there is general comity between major powers, the utility of a single structure amid myriad engagements is also diminished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the idea of putting boundaries around national behavior is constructive. Especially promising areas to explore are those surrounding dual-use technology, autonomous weapons systems, and the weaponization of financial instruments. While competition in some of these areas is desirable and can drive innovation, unconstrained rivalry is more likely to be destabilizing. Putting limits on what governments will do, and creating confidence that those limits will be observed, reduces tensions and slows escalatory spirals. Yet, beneficial as such actions are, they need to be merely a piece of a much larger set of efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLURILATERAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambition can be a rare commodity in the multilateral sphere. Washington’s frequent instinct, as well as the instinct of many allies, is to make moderate reforms to existing institutions and arrangements in order to make them fit for purpose. Yet, the reform process is fraught. Meeting the aspirations of rising powers while reducing the U.S. ambit as well as that of its closest allies requires both sides of the equation to make what they consider to be significant concessions. Doing so when great power competition is the prevailing paradigm creates strong disincentives for such action. It is not a promising environment for ambitious adventures of diplomatic architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is not a promising environment for ambitious adventures of diplomatic architecture.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More worthwhile is an effort to supplement the existing system, enveloping it in a web of complementary, sometimes overlapping, and often less-formal arrangements. In a way, this represents an effort to supplement twentieth-century agreements with additions that are more reminiscent of the nineteenth century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have already been efforts to invigorate what might be called “plurilateralism,” in which states set up smaller, more flexible, voluntary, and often temporary arrangements to break down complex cooperation problems and address specific governance challenges. Coalitions vary greatly in size, function, and format, and they address discrete problem sets and issue areas in which interested parties have a stake. Former Indian national security adviser Shivshankar Menon has called this growing form of internationalism “coalitions of the willing and able,” reflecting the fact that coalition members often have both an interest in addressing the shared challenges at hand and a willingness to devote resources toward them. When working well, informal arrangements enable swift cooperation on shared challenges — something in increasingly short supply within treaty-based multilateral forums. Smaller groupings mean fewer diverging interests at the negotiating table, which arguably makes it easier (and quicker) to define agendas and set goals in discrete areas of global problem solving. And because membership can be tailored to those with an interest in the issue at hand, states often come to the table with greater willingness to negotiate solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plurilateral coalitions have become more common across multiple domains of international problem solving, particularly as the prevalence and visibility of transnational issues has grown and geopolitical tensions and recalibrated modes of international engagement have made more formal arrangements less effective. In the environmental realm, for example, informal “climate clubs” are gaining traction as the international climate agenda expands and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) — the chief multilateral body for environmental negotiations — faces gridlock. Some groupings are designed to enable stronger international agreements. The Major Economies Forum of Energy and Climate Change (MEF), for example, was formed in 2009 to facilitate negotiations among developed and developing economies on the minimum required contributions necessary to make the 2010 UN Copenhagen climate summit successful. The MEF — which includes China, the United States, and other major polluters — has resumed meeting under the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coalitional governance in global health has also grown, especially in light of gridlock in the WHO made evident by the Covid-19 pandemic. In March 2021, for example, the “Quad” grouping of four maritime democracies across the Indo-Pacific (the United States, Australia, Japan, and India) established a vaccine partnership to assist countries in Asia with their Covid-19 pandemic responses, expand vaccine manufacturing, and administer 1.2 billion vaccinations globally. Meanwhile, under Beijing’s chairmanship in 2022, BRICS — Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — launched a vaccine R&amp;amp;D center aimed at deepening cooperation in pandemic prevention as well as vaccine development, production, and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the economic domain, too, coalitional approaches are on the rise. The G20, formed in 1999 as a coordination mechanism among major global economies, held its first summit in 2008 as the world plunged into the largest financial crisis since the Great Depression. By choice, states in the former G8 began investing in the G20 as the “premier forum for . . . international economic cooperation,” recognizing that avoiding global crises (economic and otherwise) would require coordination among a wider set of states. China has been active in coalitional arrangements in this sphere. In 2013, it launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to support infrastructure development overseas and expand and coordinate its bilateral economic partnerships, along with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), to put its stamp on regional infrastructure financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The informal and ad hoc nature of coalitional arrangements can facilitate problem solving. For example, while China (now the largest creditor to developing nations) has refused to join the Paris Club — an informal group of mostly Western official creditors that has met regularly since 1956 to address repayment challenges faced by debtor countries — it recently joined Paris Club members in a new initiative, the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, to discuss coordination on sovereign debt restructuring and debt sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global cooperation is arguably most effective when pursued as a set of concentric circles, in which the innermost circle features deep patterns of cooperation enabled among like-minded societies. As tensions have intensified between Beijing and Washington over the past decade, coalitional arrangements have emerged as a key vector for parties to extend and reinforce partnerships among like-minded states, expand material and normative influence, and set multilateral agendas in line with policy preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Global cooperation is arguably most effective when pursued as a set of concentric circles, in which the innermost circle features deep patterns of cooperation enabled among like-minded societies.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNITED STATES, ALLIES, AND PARTNERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many plurilateral groupings pursued in the global West have begun to emphasize “like-mindedness” or ideological solidarity as an organizing principle. Deputy Prime Minister of Canada Chrystia Freeland has argued that democracies need to deepen mutual ties and drop “the pretense, or the self-delusion, that most of our relationships with authoritarian regimes can have a win-win outcome.” This idea is made explicit in the Biden administration’s U.S. National Security Strategy: while recognizing the importance of building coalitions that are “as inclusive as possible” to address global challenges, the strategy repeatedly emphasizes that “democratic nations who share our interests and values” will be “at the core of our inclusive coalition.” Such ideas are echoed in the national security strategies of key U.S. allies and partners, including Japan and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and like-minded partners are indeed leveraging coalitions to address perceived threats from China’s more assertive international behavior. Consensus about challenges to regional stability and prosperity served to resuscitate the Quad; the group was established first in 2007 but was reestablished in 2017 and meaningfully reinvigorated during the Covid-19 pandemic, due to strategic adjustments from India arguably tied to the Ladakh border crisis with China. Shared values are a core ingredient of the Quad. As Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar put it, “the Quad nations are all democratic polities, market economies and pluralistic societies,” a fact which generates “natural understanding” between coalition members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revitalized Quad joins a growing set of partnerships and groupings forming what the Biden administration describes as a “latticework of strong, resilient, and mutually reinforcing relationships that prove democracies can deliver for their people and the world.” AUKUS, a trilateral partnership designed to enhance strategic coordination and technological integration between the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, is another example. AUKUS leaders are united by a desire to “protect . . . shared values and promote security and prosperity,” including a stable, free, and open Indo-Pacific. Similarly, the U.S. and EU trade and technology consultation mechanism, launched in June 2021, aims to coordinate economic and technology policy based on shared democratic values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all U.S. coalitions are anchored around a shared set of values. Some help the United States solidify new partnerships. The I2U2 grouping established in 2021, for example, links the United States with the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and India — states of different sizes, regime types, and development levels — centered on a broad agenda spanning from infrastructure development to food security to waste treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAYERING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that none of these approaches to multilateral cooperation need be exclusive. For example, states may simultaneously seek to create legally binding agreements between themselves (requiring both treaty commitments as well as domestic legislation for implementation), summit meetings of political leaderships, a permanent secretariat to sustain activity between summit meetings, and dedicated multiyear funding for shared projects. An example of the latter is the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has spent over $100 billion worldwide in the last 20 years. While such layered efforts can be made among like-minded states, one could also argue that the approach approximates many elements of U.S.-Soviet (and later, U.S.-Russian) arms control agreements. Because comprehensive agreements often require domestic support, and because legislative processes may be drawn out and have uncertain outcomes, governments may favor pursuing multiple pathways simultaneously. Doing so can both build momentum for domestic legislation and lock in agreements when the requisite domestic support is not assured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it is important to note that congeniality and effectiveness do not always go hand in hand. As a former Asian foreign minister observed, “The inclination is to have like-minded groupings of countries that exclude [other countries] . . . but I think that type of . . . comfortable, cozy, like-minded setup, while effective in decision-making. . . doesn’t allow for difficult conversations to be had.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;non-state-actors&quot;&gt;Non-state Actors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to invigorate a world with plurilateral arrangements is to supplement them further with a broader variety of actors. More and more, global problem solving demands the participation and resources not only of governments and intergovernmental organizations but also of corporate, civic, and philanthropic actors. The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted this new dynamic: while some governments pushed politically driven narratives and restricted information flow, public health experts, universities, and foundations shared data and remedies across borders. Accordingly, growing attention is being paid to the question of how to optimize integration of intergovernmental, national, sub-national, and non-state efforts in what UN secretary-general António Guterres has called more “inclusive multilateralism.” Anne-Marie Slaughter argues, “humanity cannot afford to go back to a world in which only states matter,” and Charles Powell draws attention to three “unconventional constituencies” — cities, citizens, and corporations — whose leadership will be required to meet the climate challenge, including by encouraging and facilitating policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-state and sub-state actors have emerged both as problem-makers and problem-solvers in the twenty-first century. An early indication of this trend arose from the actions of al Qaeda at the turn of the century: according to Henry Kissinger, the 9/11 attacks immediately prompted questions of “how to establish international order when the principal adversaries are non-state organizations that defend no specific territory and reject established principles of legitimacy.” The leveling power of technology has increasingly enabled non-conventional actors to inflict disruption or lethal harm on states, such as through cyberterrorism and election interference. A hacker in one country can shut down a pipeline on another continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These developments, many experts argue, challenge traditional notions of sovereignty that have historically formed the basis for order-building. As U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan put it in conversation with Michael Fullilove, the expanded capacity of non-state actors to inflict disruption and harm across borders has to some extent made the “Westphalian system of state-to-state diplomacy and engagement feel an increasingly distant thing.” Ian Bremmer foresees a “technopolar moment” in which big technology companies rival nation-states in their provision of national security, their delivery of digital and analog products necessary to run a modern society, and their ability to shape interactions and behaviors of citizens. As Dr. Kissinger frames it, “the very definition of state authority may turn ambiguous . . . [when] a laptop can produce global consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due partially to the resource demands of addressing growing transnational challenges, multilevel and multi-stakeholder approaches to global problem solving are on the rise. The private sector brings enormous financial resources. In 2020, the combined market capitalization of just five major U.S. technology companies exceeded the GDP of every nation but the United States and China. Financial incentives for private sector actors to align themselves with global efforts, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, are rising as shareholders of major multinational corporations increasingly prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As Dr. Kissinger frames it, “the very definition of state authority may turn ambiguous . . . [when] a laptop can produce global consequences.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, actors at the subnational level, such as provincial and city governments, are increasingly indispensable in addressing transnational challenges. This is particularly true for issues such as pandemics and climate change, which disproportionately affect urban environments. In many countries, local authorities were on the frontlines in Covid-19 pandemic prevention and control: distributing tests, personal protective equipment, and vaccines, as well as issuing stay-at-home orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the climate arena, cities are now responsible for over 70 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, new arrangements have emerged to leverage these stakeholders as partners in problem solving. In 2014, for example, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon and UN special envoy for cities and climate change Michael Bloomberg announced the “Compact of Mayors” designed to support mayors and other city officials who pledged to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions, enhance local resilience to climate change, and transparently track their progress. In 2016, the Compact for Mayors merged with an EU-focused initiative to become the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM), a partnership between the European Union and Bloomberg Philanthropies, which has brought together over 12,500 cities and local governments across six continents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GCoM offers an example of an emerging form of multi-stakeholder internationalism that more formally incorporates philanthropies, civil society, mayors, governors, and the private sector as partners to address pressing challenges. State-based coalitions and treaty-based institutions such as the United Nations and International Monetary Fund alike are increasingly working alongside businesses, NGOs, and civic society organizations through what Slaughter and LaForge call “impact hubs.” An implicit premise of such hubs is that treaty-based institutions and states bring legitimacy and convening capacities, but non-state and local governmental actors are essential partners in financing and implementing steps to address shared challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of this multi-stakeholder approach are proliferating across transnational issue areas such as global health, food security, and climate change. A prominent example in the realm of global health is the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). Established in 2000, GAVI facilitates the delivery of affordable vaccines to low-income countries. GAVI was specifically designed to be a “new type of international organization, one that sought to be representative, nimble, and effective all at the same time.” While GAVI’s objectives are aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals, and international institutions anchor the alliance, non-state actors remain central to the enterprise: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation contributed initial seed money in 1999 and has a permanent seat on the 28-member board, alongside civil society organizations, research and technical health institutes, donor countries, and international organizations such as the WHO and the World Bank. GAVI worked alongside UNICEF and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) — another multi-stakeholder group — on the COVAX effort during the Covid-19 pandemic, which distributed nearly 2 billion vaccines to 146 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of this multi-stakeholder approach are found in a range of other realms. In food security, for example, the UN secretary-general recently launched the Food Systems Coordination Hub to better coordinate the work of UN bodies, international financial institutions, civil society, and private sector actors to support food systems transformations at the national level. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which seeks to reduce corruption and regulate information disclosure in supply chains for extractive industries (oil, gas, and mineral), is another example. Funding comes from implementing countries, international development partners, and private firms, and the board is composed of civil society organizations, firms in the industry, institutional investors, and implementing and supporting countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the energy and climate space, a prominent and recent multi-stakeholder initiative is the Global Energy Alliance for People and the Planet (GEAPP), which aims to catalyze and channel major public and private investments to improve the availability of affordable clean power. GEAPP has three types of partners: anchor partners, including foundations responsible for setting the strategic vision and providing seed capital; multilateral and regional development banks, which “amplify” philanthropic and private capital; and organizations and individuals with technical and regional expertise. Just as GAVI was established with support from the Gates Foundation, GEAPP was set up by the Rockefeller Foundation, which — with partners — invested $10 billion at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November 2021. A multi-stakeholder approach was inherent in its design: GEAPP “recognizes that to create major change, a new approach is needed. Multiple players — governments, investors, innovators, power companies, philanthropies, and more — must come together to ensure access to electricity for all people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As these examples suggest, broader coalitions of diverse stakeholders share many of the same advantages and disadvantages of state-based coalitions. Their flexibility encourages participation and allows for adaptation, and their modularity offers the ability to advance specific objectives. A unique advantage of bringing non-state and sub-state actors into the equation is that greater resources are brought to bear in addressing each challenge. This makes investments more sizeable, but also more stable: even as political dynamics within countries make broader cooperation difficult, non-state actors such as NGOs and corporations may still be able to work across borders and advance progress toward shared challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One implication of what Slaughter and LaForge call “opening up the order” to non-state and subnational actors involves influence over international norms and rules. Compared to the Global North, many countries in the broader Global South have relatively weak civil societies. Most sizeable philanthropies and civil society organizations, and many large corporations, are from the advanced economies of North America, Asia, and Europe. Arguably, this means that many multi-stakeholder arrangements may actually reinforce the wherewithal of developed countries in global governance, providing them with additional avenues to impose preferred norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, multi-stakeholder arrangements come with their own set of risks. National governments are often suspicious of other types of actors working on issues they see as within their sovereign remit. And without coordination, having too many actors involved in solutions provision risks gridlock and redundancy: “In most areas of global problem solving,” Slaughter and LaForge argue, “the challenge is not too few actors but too many.” These considerations clarify the challenges of developing multistakeholder arrangements that not only incorporate a range of stakeholders but efficiently channel their resources, know-how, and technology into global problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much of the foregoing analysis describes responses to the world as it is, it does not necessarily describe the world as it will be. As the United States and its partners look toward the future, it is important to anticipate that the nature of great power conflict may change, and perhaps in large ways. In the nearer term, the termination of the Ukraine war could leave Russia isolated, poorer, and some even suspect with new leadership. Some scenarios, however, would leave Russia strengthened, and a crumbling of Western support for Ukraine could change the nature of global solidarity with the United States. Either would cast a large shadow on U.S.-Russian competition. In the longer term, however, it is hard to see how the energy transition will leave Russia stronger, and Russia’s demographic challenges pose a persistent threat to its global power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s demographic challenges are even starker. Not only has India overtaken China as the world’s most populous country, but China’s population will both age and shrink over the next half century in ways that will certainly affect its economic growth. It remains unclear if China’s current economic slowdown is a harbinger of growing structural issues or a temporary consequence of its Covid lockdown, but assuming China’s global ascent will continue uninterrupted through the twenty-first century would be a mistake. While China may indeed continue to grow in global influence, barriers to that growth are increasingly visible. Whereas it once seemed fanciful to wonder if China would grow old before it grew rich, the question is an increasingly salient one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;While China may indeed continue to grow in global influence, barriers to that growth are increasingly visible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible that a decline in the prospects of great power competitors — including the United States — could provoke governments to be less risk-averse as they seek to stave off decline. Yet, it is also possible that great power competition, which is currently at the core of U.S. global strategy, may soon be joined by the need to manage a subtler competition among rising powers for a greater share of the global pie. In this analysis, Russia’s and China’s military and intelligence capabilities mean they will remain important, but their relative importance may diminish while the growing ambitions, appetites, and independence of countries such as India, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia may grow even more salient. One former Asian national security adviser suggested, “Parts of the South now have developed capabilities they didn’t have, and hard power capabilities. If you look at it geopolitically, the contentions that matter are in the South, not in Ukraine, which is not going to change the central global balance [between China and the United States] . . . I think what we’re going to see is increasing movement by the South towards strategic autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ukraine war, which started in a period already marked by great power competition, has highlighted global divisions in international affairs. Great power cooperation has fallen to its lowest level since more than half a century ago, when the United States began strategically engaging China to isolate the Soviet Union. Because there is ongoing proxy warfare between the United States and Russia in Ukraine, and because Chinese and U.S. tensions over the South China Sea in general — and Taiwan in particular — are rising, efforts to put guardrails around great power conflict are fraught. Each side fears that efforts to limit escalation are merely covert efforts to convey advantage. Meanwhile, rising direct sanctions against Russia and U.S. efforts to deprive China of access to cutting-edge U.S. technology have the effect of disentangling trade and reducing incentives for cooperation. Simultaneously, even countries close to the United States have signaled a desire to distance themselves from great power competition — absent a global ideological threat, attracted by the idea of greater agency over pursuit of their individual interests, and feeling that they benefit from a diversity of relationships. Global solidarity is becoming harder to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no single reform or formula that can recover the shared sense of purpose that characterized much of the world in 1945. The world is more intimately connected than ever before, and the problems have multiplied even faster than the number of stakeholders. The appropriate response is to expand the instruments of consultation and cooperation, creating multiple forums for shared action. The foregoing essay has made clear some of the advantages of doing so, which date back to the nineteenth century’s earliest efforts at internationalism: incentivizing cooperation, coordinating the pursuit of shared interests, and enabling outcomes that individual countries’ actions are unable to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There is no single reform or formula that can recover the shared sense of purpose that characterized much of the world in 1945.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such efforts must overcome two challenges, however. The first is that they can succumb to advancing the “least common denominator” in international forums, devoting energy to issues and partners where there is broad agreement while diverting it from important areas where there is less agreement. Such an outcome would deliver small marginal benefits, but also leave unmanaged much more important — and potentially even threatening — problems that divide important countries. A central discipline throughout this process must be to ensure that contentious issues and troubling partners continue to receive sustained attention, partly through direct engagement and partly through using broadened partnerships to help build coalitions that can push back on any single country’s excesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge is that the whole process could become completely unwieldy, with so many simultaneous initiatives taking off in so many directions that they dissipate energies rather than collect them. With a limited number of senior policymakers and limited time, there must be prioritization of efforts and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s efforts to advance its agenda aggressively in every forum have not won it success but have helped stave off abject failure. The government has been able to use its position and its influence to block efforts to constrain its behavior, and it has reached a sort of understanding with China that advances common goals, or at least common defenses. China’s efforts in this space have been more successful in addressing the second set of challenges than the first. Schemes such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development Initiative have drawn wide attention and broad participation, even when their parameters are unclear — and perhaps because of it. China has done an extraordinary job framing issues, supplying vocabulary, and advancing partnerships on its own terms. On the first set of issues — a watering down of collective action — China has also been largely successful, not least because it is comfortable in a world that gives wide ambit to sovereign governments and pushes collaboration mostly into the bilateral sphere. That suits China well, since in every bilateral relationship except the one with the United States, it is the dominant partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States and its allies and partners approach this issue, they have several innate advantages. The first is that they have allies and partners, bound by treaty and by shared interests to pursue common goals. That is to say, they have a head start. Second, they are better positioned to make consequential and positive change: technology and know-how, combined with massive capital, makes a great deal possible. Third, they have organizational and institutional capacity, between governments and with civil society organizations. Seventy-five years of joint action have created institutional memory and institutional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet they must develop their capacity along two lines. The first is humility. The world’s wealthiest countries have devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to efforts that they said were devoted to global prosperity. Yet, many of the targets of that aid remain poor, and some, like China, that received little aid prospered. As countries that have felt historically exploited — by colonial powers, by extractive industries, by multinational corporations, by global financial institutions, and by the dominant states that shape those institutions — gain power and agency, more powerful countries will need to weigh the wisdom and efficacy of coercive efforts against weaker ones. This is not to say that there will not be moments when pressure is essential; rather, countries will increasingly find alternatives to compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second element that must be developed is creativity. Because the United States and its allies and partners created the status quo, they have an instinct to preserve it. Yet, the very act of doing so reinforces the dissatisfaction of those who object to it. A strategy that searches creatively for common interests, builds common goals, and aligns common efforts both in rhetoric and action can break through that dissatisfaction and build durable patterns of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this will eliminate great power competition nor resolve the growing set of issues that divide the parts of the world that are still grasping for prosperity and the parts that are trying to preserve what they have. But a robust set of institutions and initiatives that encompass a wider range of actors will help create tools to manage tensions and create opportunities for efforts that make conditions far better for all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華：黎智英稱外國制裁加民間力量可達至「支爆」 籲「攬炒巴」及其團隊接棒&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6XHGJmv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第63日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他指在2020年1月連同「攬炒巴」劉祖廸，在台灣陽明山莊與黎智英會面，當時黎聲稱想培養劉做政治明星，可以資助生活費，及「畀到政治上同經濟上嘅人脈畀佢識」。惟劉未有答應。陳另引述黎說長遠而言應該爭取國際認同，由外國實施禁運和制裁來向中國和香港政府施壓，「然後我哋要團結唔同嘅板塊，再加埋民間嘅力量，先可以達到『支爆』」，屆時便是「引入美國嘅民主最好嘅時機」。陳又引述黎稱他那一代人未必可以實現到「支爆」，所以「佢希望以劉祖廸牽頭嘅攬炒團隊，同呢班年青人，可以接棒」。翌日陳與劉祖廸會見已故台灣民運人士施明德，陳引述施說：「唔好心存僥倖」，又向劉說：「如果你返香港畀人拉嘅話，其實仲好，除咗會有更多群眾嘅支持，亦都可以得到在囚抗爭者嘅支持。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第五天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱把黎智英傳送給他的文章視為一個對我嘅指導&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱把黎智英傳送給他的文章視為「一個對我嘅指導」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英與陳梓華之間的 WhatsApp 對話，在2020年1月的台北會面之前，即1月8日，黎向陳傳送一篇文章的連結，乃裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）刊登於《蘋果日報》網站的文章。陳回覆稱他看過文章，認為可以幫助到他說服那些「頑固的領袖」；黎亦指文章值得閱讀，而「攬炒巴」劉祖廸也應該看。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，他訊息提及的「頑固領袖」是指，其他在國際線上希望推廣更激進思想的人，以及勇武派。因為他在2019年11及12月與黎智英會面之後，黎希望陳能夠替他傳遞信息，包括「唔好去爭奪國際上嘅話語權，而係要大家團結一致對抗政府」。而裴倫德的文章論點，正是指「應該喺國際線上有統一的聲音」，所以陳稱將黎傳送給他的文章，「視為佢嘅一個對我嘅指導，去點說服其他人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又稱，他曾經將上述文章連結傳送給劉祖廸，但不知道對方有否閱讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英稱想培養劉祖廸做政治明星-可資助生活費&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英稱想培養劉祖廸做政治明星 可資助生活費&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱，由於黎智英希望與「攬炒巴」劉祖廸見面交流，所以赴英國聯絡劉，並邀請劉到台灣與黎見面。陳指2020年1月11日，黎智英在台灣陽明山的別墅舉行飯局。在黎的要求下，陳、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和林姓「女手足」提早到場，與黎智英見面及交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在會面中，陳簡介劉祖廸的過往工作之後，黎開始問劉，為何他的眾籌可以達到如此龐大規模。劉則分析指，因為網上有很多海外香港人及組織幫助，所以令眾籌很快增長。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，黎接著問劉在工作上是否遇到任何問題，「黎智英話想培養佢（劉）做政治明星，可以喺生活上面資助佢10千鎊」，當時黎的意思是一萬磅，但用字上是用了「10千鎊」。陳指黎亦說：「可以畀到政治上同經濟上嘅人脈畀佢識。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指劉聽了黎的說話後，並沒有立即答應，當時劉表示不想做政治明星。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英指老泛民早已與美國議員有聯繫-不應再浪費資源赴美會見&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英指老泛民早已與美國議員有聯繫 不應再浪費資源赴美會見&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，就李宇軒等人赴美國會見議員，黎智英表示「唔應該係咁」，因為老泛民已經可以介紹到這些議員，「唔需要去嘥呢啲資源，重要嘅係佢哋應該識多啲枱底人，而唔係一直喺度識啲枱面人，例如 Rick Scott、Ted Cruz、Tod Young，呢啲係老泛民本身就已經有 connection。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，黎提到一些職級較低的人，可能與民運人士在彼此年輕的時候便開始認識，10年或20年之後，職級低的人可能就晉升至很高職級的官員，「咁呢啲關係就好有用喇」，可以用來做國際游說，推動反華政策。黎當時舉例指前政務司司長陳方安生和前美國眾議院議長佩洛西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，黎有否在會面中談論「反華政策」所指為何。陳則指後來與黎的其他對話中，黎有提及經濟封鎖、制裁，以及取消香港的特殊地位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英指應該爭取國際認同-加上民間力從而達至支爆&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英指應該爭取國際認同 加上民間力從而達至「支爆」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，「黎智英話長遠嚟講，應該爭取國際認同，然後由佢哋去做 embargo（禁運）、制裁，去向政府施壓，然後我哋要團結唔同嘅板塊，再加埋民間嘅力量，先可以達到『支爆』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問什麼是「支爆」。陳表示：「我理解係經濟上嘅崩塌，同埋政治上政權嘅崩塌。」而「不同的板塊」是指議會、海外組織、街頭力量、國際線及商人，陳又引述黎當時稱：「其實好多商家佬都好不滿。」至於「民間力量」，陳指黎的意思是「要有民怨」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳憶述，劉祖廸聽罷黎智英的說話後，「佢（劉）表示好悲觀，佢唔相信真係會做到『支爆』」，亦不知道可以如何做到。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華引述黎當時稱好快會支爆-屆時是引入美國民主的最好時機&quot;&gt;陳梓華引述黎當時稱「好快會支爆」 屆時是引入美國民主的最好時機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指黎當時回應：「根據歷史嘅經驗，好快會『支爆』，因為中國政府用好多嘅資源去監控人民」，但是，「就算『支爆』咗之後，中國嘅GDP都會有六成左右，而嗰陣時就係引入美國嘅民主最好嘅時機。」黎向劉說：「你更加要好好運用你嘅資源，好好利用『攬炒團隊』對你嘅支持，去推廣呢個制裁。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述黎接著向劉說：「國際游說唔係好似你哋咁樣做」，而是應該首先令外界知道香港發生什麼事，然後呼籲他們去譴責和關注事件，「然後就係將外國嘅枱底人，同埋政府嘅諗法帶畀香港人。」黎又指，只有將他們的想法帶入香港，「香港人先會知道，外國政府冇離棄，同埋冇忽視佢哋，同埋可以保持士氣。」此時與「枱底人」所建立的關係，「就可以影響到佢哋嘅對華政策，可以呼籲到佢哋制裁，甚至將來有可能推得翻中共。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英希望劉祖廸及攬炒團隊接棒&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英希望劉祖廸及「攬炒團隊」接棒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又引述：「黎智英話佢呢一代人未必可以實現到呢件事，佢希望以劉祖廸牽頭嘅攬炒團隊，同呢班年青人，可以接棒。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述劉祖廸當時回應，其個人願意合作，以及「同意呢個大方向」，但是關於「攬炒團隊」的方向，需要先跟李宇軒商討。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英當時考慮注資辦初選-稱想學習美國模式&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英當時考慮注資辦初選 稱想學習美國模式&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指黎當時亦談及初選，並問劉祖廸會否嘗試參選，又表示「佢本人會幫啲政治素人，去幫佢哋做傳媒曝光，同埋經濟上支持佢哋，只要佢哋肯去參選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JRCb72n.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黎智英（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時有份審理民主派「35+」初選案的法官李運騰問，黎口中的是哪一個「初選」，當時是2020年1月，社會上有沒有任何人提出舉辦初選，或者有否相關新聞報導。陳則表示當時據他所知沒有，直至2020年2月才首次接觸或知道哪些人參與初選。李官繼而問，既然社會上未有人提出舉辦初選，在座的人是否知道黎口中的「初選」是指什麼。陳則指黎有提到「佢想學習美國嘅模式」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，黎稱他向歐洲的應用程式公司索取報價，「咁就10幾萬，唔貴。當時無講貨幣單位，但我相信係歐羅。」但是由於該應用程式只要有手提電話便可以登記投票，難以確認投票者身份，所以黎當時正在考慮中。至於舉辦初選的經費，陳指「佢（黎）話佢會經濟上支持」，又提及戴耀廷發起的「雷動計劃」，「佢有揼過錢出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華施明德稱若非黎智英介紹-不會見他及攬炒巴等人&quot;&gt;陳梓華：施明德稱若非黎智英介紹 不會見他及「攬炒巴」等人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，與黎智英見面之後翌日，在黎的安排下，陳連同「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和林姓「女手足」一同會見已故台灣民運人士施明德，當時是在施的辦公室，同場還有施的妻子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，在會面開頭，施明德說過，如果不是黎智英介紹，「佢唔會見我哋。」施其後談論其政治生涯和政治觀點，接著問劉祖廸對香港反修例運動的看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述施明德說，若果劉之後打算再做群眾運動的話，必須要考慮三點，要有認受性、統一性和一個清晰的政治訴求。施以紅衫軍及其他群眾運動作為例子，「認受性」即是要有群眾的支持、正面的媒體評價和報導，還有眾籌。「統一性」就是行動時，衣著顏色和標籤要統一。「清晰的政治訴求」以當時而言即是「五大訴求」。施亦說過：「群眾要跟隨總指揮嘅方向。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華引述施明德說唔好心存僥倖若劉祖廸回港被捕更好-因可獲得群眾支持&quot;&gt;陳梓華引述施明德說「唔好心存僥倖」、若劉祖廸回港被捕更好 因可獲得群眾支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，施明德其後開始談論「點樣行政治犯呢條路」、「唔好心存僥倖喇」。施向劉說：「如果你返香港畀人拉嘅話，其實仲好，除咗會有更多群眾嘅支持，亦都可以得到在囚抗爭者嘅支持。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問施口中的「心存僥倖」是什麼意思。陳指意思是「唔好以為你可以走得甩」，因為當時劉祖廸仍然想做一個匿名的抗爭者，或者海外的抗爭者，施便告訴劉：「你依家做緊嘅嘢，你一定有後果嘅，你唔好以為呢個後果係可以避開得到。」陳指劉並未有回應施這方面的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，當時他不知道劉有否被香港政府通緝，直至後來才知道，劉在香港因為其他事情而被捕過一次，但是陳當時並不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，施勉勵劉祖廸，「要高舉犧牲嘅精神，你唔可以自己唔犧牲，但叫其他人去做嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指線上會議跟李宇軒和攬炒巴討論國際線分工&quot;&gt;陳梓華指線上會議跟李宇軒和「攬炒巴」討論國際線分工&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，會見施明德之後當晚，他與劉祖廸跟李宇軒進行線上會議，將會見黎智英的內容告知李，而且因為李是「重光團隊」（Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）的領導之一，如果劉祖廸想採取黎智英建議的方向，便需要徵得李的同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，在線上會議中，大家對於團結不同板塊和國際游說去推動制裁，都表示同意，然後便討論如何分工。「尤其是『攬炒』（劉祖廸）想做到『支爆』」，劉當時考慮會否涉足議會線，但由於當時他已經是一名精神領袖，去推廣「攬炒論」和壯大 SWHK，所以大家決定由劉做國際游說，以及擴充國際上的人脈，而陳則繼續聯絡勇武派，若果再有街頭運動的話，便嘗試可否與勇武派對話，以及看看有沒有政治素人參與議會線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於李宇軒，陳指他會負責游說外國官員或政府，去推動制裁法案或者經濟封鎖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問「攬炒論」是什麼意思。陳指是「想同個政府講，係會有代價嘅，若然你唔回應市民訴求，當時有句口號：“If you burn, you burn with us.”」，而具體上他們希望推動到制裁措施。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱將各人分工報告給黎智英-並稱會在國際線上跟隨黎的行動&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱將各人分工報告給黎智英 並稱會在國際線上跟隨黎的行動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，在線上會議結束之後，他透過 WhatsApp Call 聯絡黎智英，陳告訴黎：「Andy（李宇軒）同劉祖廸都同意喺國際線上面跟隨你嘅行動。」當陳告訴黎，李宇軒會「打國際線」時，黎卻認為李宇軒和劉祖廸都應該要「打國際線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年1月底，陳再次聯絡黎，告知他：「『攬炒』（劉祖廸）唔想打議會線，但係喺國際線上面，就會全力開火。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另向黎提及「當時有條日本線，就係李宇軒打嘅」，不過當中遇到問題，就是很難接觸到「枱底人」，然後黎叫陳等人聯絡其私人助手 Mark Simon，以協助美國線。陳引述黎提醒他們：「叫我哋唔好咁心急，因為係一個 long game（持久戰）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱要求黎智英出面調停美國線爭拗-其後mark-simon擺平事件&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱要求黎智英出面調停美國線爭拗 其後Mark Simon擺平事件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就美國線，陳指當時是由劉祖廸、李宇軒和 Shirley Ho 帶頭，但他們開始與一些當地的港人組織「有啲拗撬」，「所以我哋當時係想黎智英出面調停。」而黎則叫陳聯絡 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳當時跟 Mark Simon 說，李宇軒和劉祖廸與紐約的港人組織「有啲矛盾」，所以希望 Mark 協助，「我有同佢講話，我哋想你出面調停。」陳指，雙方對於會見美國議員時應該用什麼團體名義有爭議，以及爭議誰人隨行、派誰人做代表。因為 SWHK 很多成員都是匿名行事，但是紐約的港人組織則使用真實身份，而且提交制裁名單時，究竟應使用 SWHK 還是其他團體的名義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，Mark Simon 遂致電美國港人組織一名叫 Anna 的成員，「咁就大致解決咗個問題」，但是他們在過程中如何解決問題，陳並不知道，但是經過該次事件之後，「成條美國線就一直有同 Mark Simon 聯絡。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱黎智英支付英國和台北之旅的費用，控方今展示陳的銀行紀錄，顯示由黎持有的力高顧問有限公司，在2020年2月底，以支票形式把約8萬元存入陳的戶口。陳指該8萬元之中有6萬元是他的開支，而餘下款項是林姓女示威者的開支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華向黎智英傳送眾志聯盟有意參與名單-答應使他們參與初選並受約束&quot;&gt;陳梓華向黎智英傳送眾志聯盟有意參與名單 答應使他們參與初選並受約束&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年2月26日，陳梓華向黎智英傳送「眾志聯盟」的出選名單，新西派出朱凱廸、新東派出何桂藍、九東派出黃之鋒、梁凱晴做「Plan B」、九西派出張崑陽、港島派出羅冠聰、超區則派出岑敖暉。陳指，2020年2月時有風聲指會進行初選，當時有消息指上述人士有意參選立法會選舉，「佢哋當時係唔想畀初選約束」，所以他將自己所得到的資訊轉發給黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎當時回覆陳：「我們要著手處理，如果初選有認受性，他們也必須參與。且看看將來如何。（“Thanks. We’ve to work on them. But if the primary has legitimacy, they will have to join. Let’s see.”）」陳回覆：「我會盡力處理它。（“I will try my best to work on it.”）」，「至少不會讓他們拖累。（“At least not to let them ruin it.”）」陳庭上解釋，黎智英當時希望令到眾志聯盟名單上的人士參與初選，以及受到初選的約束。陳認為應該遵循他與黎早前的會面內容去做，「同埋我個人認為，我如果能夠幫到黎智英嘅話，就係貢獻緊喺反修例運動。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英轉發美國政府內部消息-沒有足夠理據實施制裁-陳梓華指劉祖廸感難過&quot;&gt;黎智英轉發美國政府內部消息 沒有足夠理據實施制裁 陳梓華指劉祖廸感難過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年4月5日，黎智英向陳梓華轉發美國政府內部消息，並叫陳保密。陳庭上指，當時美國認為並沒有足夠理據去就香港實施制裁措施，他徵詢黎的同意後，把相關消息告知劉祖廸和李宇軒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指二人得悉消息之後，「劉當時比較難過，但係佢當時已經打緊北歐線」，加上當時疫情關係，「都好難去做到啲咩。」陳補充，劉難過是因為「佢對美國政府有好高期望」，希望能實施制裁。至於李宇軒則「冇乜特別嘅反應」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon認為用選票制衡政府好過暴力示威&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon認為用選票制衡政府好過暴力示威&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他與 Mark Simon 在大約在2020年5月再次見面，期間 Mark 指黎智英和他已經聯絡了幾間傳媒公司，會與時任「民主動力」召集人趙家賢協辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，Mark Simon 表示希望初選「會變成一個選舉嘅傳統，啫係可以制衡政府」。Mark 亦提及，「美國政府就係想見到呢啲，利用選票去制衡個政府，就會好過暴力嘅示威。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指 Mark 又稱，他會和黎智英帶陳和其他年青人出席美國聽證會，又希望陳等人不要再用眾籌款項來登報，而是應該將資源集中在國際游說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周二（4月23日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this paper is to identify requirements for the command and control (C2) of the British Army’s ground-based air defences (GBAD) within an overarching integrated air and missile defence construct. The context is that the Ministry of Defence is developing an integrated air and missile defence strategy, and the army is starting work supporting its Land GBAD programme. This paper seeks to outline the trajectory of the future air threat environment, as well as the components critical to meeting that threat, thereby deriving requirements for the C2 construct within which the UK’s GBAD will operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future threat environment is characterised by diversifying and converging threats. Historically, air threats have been optimised by their range and cost to strike targets at varying depths, and have largely fallen into two categories: systems that seek to evade defences by flying low to avoid detection; and those that fly fast at high altitude. Defensive systems had therefore been optimised to maximise their probability of successfully intercepting the specific threats aimed at the targets they were defending. Increasingly, these categories are being blurred, both in terms of the targets against which munitions are assigned, and their flight characteristics. The result is that future air defences must be designed to maximise their efficiency as a system, allocating appropriate interceptors against simultaneous, multiple threats. The sustainability of an air defence system is therefore increasingly determined by C2 efficiency. The challenge is how to establish a robust, layered air defence capability that can identify, classify and assign the most appropriate mechanism to defeating complex salvos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to track these diverse threats, the force must avoid being dependent on a small number of dedicated ground-based radars, which can be suppressed, or isolated and deceived. Instead, the air defence system must be able to fuse and integrate data tracks of varying quality and sensitivity from across the joint force’s sensors. This will include both radar on assets such as the E-7 Wedgetail and the F-35, which are optimised to track air threats, as well as sensors of opportunity normally focused on other targets. Acoustic sensors, for example, are likely to proliferate across land formations, intended to identify the source of fire. These systems are also able to provide tracks for low-flying air threats, if the data can be accessed. Accessing such data requires GBAD C2 to be bearer agnostic, and able to ingest data of varying kinds, delivered by a multitude of means. It will also be necessary for the system to be able to integrate new kinds of sensor and effector, either as new capabilities are fielded, or as novel capabilities are brought to bear in response to evolving adversary tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These characteristics are especially important because UK GBAD systems are not currently equipped to be able to defeat many kinds of air threat. UK ballistic missile defences are operated solely by the Royal Navy, for example. Wherever the UK deploys, whether alongside NATO Allies or partners further afield, it must be able to contribute to and benefit from both joint sensors and effectors, and multinational C2. The diversity of UK partners with whom the UK – as a force that is expeditionary by design – would need to integrate means that the C2 architecture must be able to publish tracks to subscribers without sharing source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is noteworthy that the UK currently lacks GBAD C2 capacity. 7 Air Defence Group has a very small cadre of personnel who might be considered professional air defenders, since the career structure in the Royal Artillery does not keep many officers in this area for a sustained period. Interoperability, however, places a premium on experience in dealing with multiple systems, and so professionalising air defence and expanding liaison opportunities is critical. It is also important to note that the two regiments of 7 Air Defence Group are currently configured to be able to provide a C2 node at division. The UK, however, aspires to have a NATO Reserve Corps and two Divisions. It is also evident – given the lack of organic capabilities – that liaison functions across the joint force and multinational allies and partners are vital. 7 Air Defence Group currently lacks the mass to maintain this many C2 nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further requirement is that the air defence C2 architecture be modular and mobile, without a single point of failure. This is achievable, and decision support tools mean that it is likely to become more so over time. Nevertheless, the C2 system must support air defence coordination from multiple small cells, able to be packed up and moved rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, air defence has been a low priority for European NATO, which has been operating with uncontested air and fires superiority. The UK, meanwhile, despite maintaining a robust maritime air defence capability, has seen its ground-based air defence (GBAD) reduced in priority – a point best illustrated by the downgrading of the task from a brigade-level function with four regiments, to a joint headquarters commanding single-service-operated systems with two assigned regiments. Now, however, several concurrent factors have prompted a renewed focus on the importance of air defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the modernisation and proliferation of highly capable Russian and Chinese air defences mean that NATO air forces must prioritise the suppression and destruction of these barriers before they can contribute directly to joint effects. This means that other elements of the force must be able to fight without air superiority – and potentially without any air cover – for limited periods. Furthermore, Iranian and Russian collaboration in developing and employing a wide range of threat systems (from low-end loitering munitions to cruise and quasi-ballistic missiles) means that air threats will remain a persistent concern, even with air superiority. A further challenge is that whereas air attack could previously be partly deterred through the psychological impact of the presence of a limited number of surface-to-air missile systems (SAMS), this cannot deter uncrewed strike systems, and consequently the credibility of a defence increasingly correlates with magazine depth and engagement efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat will manifest in two ways for land forces. The first is the risk of destruction at the tactical level when forces have engaged with an opponent. The second threat is that of air interdiction: the destruction of forces before they have joined the fight, or the disruption of their enabling rear area infrastructure and logistics. The risk of interdiction is one that will also be faced by other elements of the joint force, and in certain circumstances ground forces may help offset it for other force elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the terminology of air attack and land concepts is a fluid one, determined by factors such as which formations are conducting the tactical battle (which determines the depths beyond which forces might be considered to have not joined the fight). The terminology used in this paper derives from that used in the context of the doctrine of AirLand Battle, where air activity beyond corps depth was typically treated as being operational. The basis for adopting this terminology is that the European theatre within which the British Army may have to operate is characterised by distances and, increasingly, force sizes similar to those of the Cold War. It is acknowledged, however, that the definition of operational depth may differ between expeditionary contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the question of which targets should be defined as strategic, as this term is typically reserved for the defence of either civil infrastructure or infrastructure with war-making potential (such as industry). Though the distinction is doctrinally valid, in the context of the UK, this paper presumes that the defence of both military and non-military targets in the homeland (where strategic targets reside) will be treated as part of a single zonally defined mission coordinated by HQ Air Command at High Wycombe, and thus the paper groups all defence of the homeland under the rubric of defence at strategic depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against Russia, identified as the UK’s most acute threat by the Integrated Review, British forces in the field are likely to face air threats at every stage of their deployment. Operational rear areas will be held at risk by ballistic and cruise missiles, while forces will also be threatened by UAVs, rockets and crewed aviation as they approach the forward line of own troops (FLOT). Russia will also pose a long-range strike threat to the homeland. Other putative opponents, such as Iran or its proxies, will be less likely to threaten the homeland, but will still pose a robust and layered threat to fielded forces. Against Iran, which can disseminate strike capabilities to proxies, the threat will exist in both the operate and warfight postures, as illustrated by proxy-led attacks on US forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Royal Navy (RN) and the RAF can provide defences against cruise and (some) ballistic missiles for both the homeland and fielded forces, they are also required to provide – with limited fleets – their own organic force protection. Moreover, certain types of targets, such as many UAVs, which are relevant in a land context, are not ones the RN or RAF focus on countering in planning and training. Finally, a land component, depending on how far inland it is, may not be able to draw on naval support. The British Army’s GBAD capability should, then, be able to provide a degree of organic protection for fielded forces at the divisional level (and below) against short-range tactical threats. It should also, if needed, be able to reinforce national and Alliance capacity against some operational and strategic threats. The first goal can be achieved by capabilities that the army should itself be able to field. Drawing on joint force and allied assets will reinforce the effectiveness of these capabilities, but will not determine their ability to meet missions. For the second goal, the army must be integrated by design: it must find specific roles that it can play to reinforce any integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) system of which it is a part. Adding resilience to C2 mechanisms and optimising against a subset of threat types are the areas where the army can add greatest value to partners and the joint force in the army deep (300 km) and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to this challenge, the British Army has initiated a Land GBAD programme aimed at delivering short-range air defence (SHORAD), medium-range air defence (MRAD), counter-small aerial target and counter-small uncrewed aerial system (C-UAS) capabilities to protect the UK’s deployed forces and to potentially contribute to the defence of bases in the homeland. Beyond these core platforms, however, it is notable that as threats diversify and develop, the layered defences – comprising interceptors which operate at different altitudes and ranges (and with different characteristics in terms of seekers and payloads), as well as soft kill capabilities – will also need to adapt. Furthermore, while some of these capabilities will be specialised air defence assets, the sensors and effectors for others will be distributed across units. The C2 infrastructure for such an enterprise, encompassing both the technical means for coordinating assets (control) and the organisational structures and authorities which determine their allocation against tactical tasks (command), needs to be robust, but also adaptable, such that it can integrate a wide range of sensors and effectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines the diversity and trajectory of threats that the Land GBAD programme will need to manage, the sensors and effectors it will need to coordinate, and the requirements this imposes for connectivity and decision points to be enabled. The purpose of the paper is to identify requirements for a suitable C2 architecture to both support the short-term air defence capabilities to be fielded by the British military, and to coordinate a developing set of systems as novel effectors become available and greater connectivity across the force expands the range of sensors that can be leveraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence base for this paper is diverse. Firstly, it relies on the technical examination of Russian and Iranian threat systems employed in the Middle East and Ukraine. This includes examination of all classes of munitions and components of key platforms, mainly recovered from the battlefield, including Kh-47M2 Kinzhal aero-ballistic and 9M723 Iskander-M quasi-ballistic missiles. It also draws on the experience of observing the evolution and coordination of the Ukrainian Air Defence Network over the course of the war, and lessons derived from the Air Defence Working Group of the Ukrainian General Staff. In addition, the paper relies on field observation of British air defence capabilities in operation, of NATO air defence C2 in operation, and of experimental capabilities for both attack and defence in the UK, the US and NATO. The research is also based on participation in live exercises in the US, where novel systems and C2 tools were tested, and on interviews with scientific technical personnel, industry and commanders of air defence units. Because of the sensitivity of much of the underlying data, the report itself outlines the concepts, rather than the technical details of the requirements, but it is informed by hard data. The paper is divided into three chapters: the first examines threats; the second analyses sensors and effectors; and the third outlines the implications for the C2 capabilities needed to stitch these sensors and effectors together as an integrated system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-charting-a-diversifying-threat-landscape&quot;&gt;I. Charting a Diversifying Threat Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make any assessment of the requirements for the C2 of the British Army’s future GBAD, it is necessary to examine the threats against which British forces must protect themselves (and others). The threat landscape may be broken into two problem sets. First, there is the requirement to protect against tactical threats targeting deployed forces. Second, there is the requirement to protect strategic and operational targets, including sea ports and air ports of embarkation and sea ports and air ports of debarkation (SPODs and APODs), bases, and headquarters from the corps level and above. There is also – per the 2023 Defence Command Paper – an imperative to protect critical national infrastructure (CNI) and centres of habitation from adversary strikes, but as regards GBAD C2, this is a similar problem set to the defence of targets in operational depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problem sets already existed during the Cold War, but they have converged in recent years. During the Cold War, the primary conventional air threat to frontline forces was Warsaw Pact aviation, while cruise and ballistic missiles such as the OTR-23 Oka were largely prioritised for targets in operational depth, such as airbases. Missiles were useful against a narrowly defined set of static and soft targets. Improvements in the accuracy of cruise and ballistic missiles mean that they can now be used both against tactical targets and against a wider range of operational and strategic targets, allowing them to threaten several military targets, in tandem with aircraft. In effect, well-defined threat categories which could previously only be used at the tactical, operational or strategic levels have converged as a function of increasing accuracy. Meanwhile, capabilities such as loitering munitions and one-way attack UAVs have, given their low cost and different flight profiles, added another dimension to this threat landscape. Despite this, the missions of defence at each level of warfare still differ, and the UK’s GBAD programme must have a C2 architecture that controls an appropriate mix of sensors and effectors to function both across different parts of the battlespace and across the continuum from competition to conflict. This chapter will first explore the diversifying kinds of threat system, and then consider how they manifest at tactical and operational depths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-and-missile-threats-in-the-future-operating-environment&quot;&gt;Air and Missile Threats in the Future Operating Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, air threats could be divided according to two parameters: altitude and speed. Although higher-flying threats such as ballistic missiles were faster, they could be detected earlier and followed predictable parabolic trajectories, whereas more manoeuvrable threats capable of flying at lower altitudes, such as aircraft and cruise missiles, were slower but harder to detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This binary categorisation remains valid, but is now complicated by two additional factors. The first is the emergence of weapons which straddle the categories of high speed and comparatively low trajectories, including supersonic and hypersonic cruise missiles and hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs); quasi-ballistic and aero-ballistic threats which fly at lower altitudes than traditional ballistic missiles also fit within this category. The second factor is the emergence of especially slow and low-flying objects, such as UAVs, which fly at speeds that would normally see objects excluded from the Doppler gate of radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This target complexity means that the attendant two-tier categorisation of sensors and effectors – with upper-tier systems interdicting fast, high-altitude targets and lower-tier systems engaging their slower counterparts – is now being challenged. A system may, for example, need to track a fast-moving target across multiple altitude brackets. This complexity of air threats is compounded by the near ubiquity of electronic warfare (EW) and decoying. In Ukraine, radar decoys have been deployed by the 3M-14 cruise missile, the 9M723 quasi-ballistic missile, and by groups of UAVs (with one UAV acting as a decoy). The detection and classification of complex targets will require the fusion of data from a broader variety of sensors to better contend with threats built to confound radar-centric defensive systems. Self-contained systems built around dedicated radar optimised against specific threats must thus be integrated both with each other and with other sensor categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge to existing air and missile defence systems is the risk of suppression and destruction. While this capability was once the province of the stronger air force, conflicts such as the ongoing war in Ukraine have illustrated that a state without air superiority can still suppress an opponent’s GBAD by leveraging the growing accuracy of, among other things, surface-to-surface threats cued by UAVs. Moreover, even weaker air forces can use standoff capabilities to pose a risk from within the relative safety of their own GBAD networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third challenge is that of mass. The gulf between capabilities which can be used at scale and more bespoke precise capabilities is shrinking. Modifications to the guidance of previously “dumb” systems can increase their accuracy by an order of magnitude. In addition, capabilities such as loitering munitions can provide a cheap avenue with which to strike targets with precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of suppression, capabilities such as Spear 3 and other precise air-launched missiles will be the most severe threat for GBAD. At present, Russia does not possess capabilities equivalent in sophistication to Spear 3, although it does use the Kh-31 in this role to some effect. In the future, Russia may obtain advanced air-launched effects from its growing collaboration with China, such that People’s Liberation Army Air Force capabilities must be a planning assumption for UK GBAD C2. The challenge posed by these capabilities is that they are specifically tailored to striking GBAD systems, are fast, manoeuvrable, can utilise an aircraft’s active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar to course correct and engage moving targets, and can therefore constrain air defence tactics. Air defences must unmask and engage other air-launched threats, but in doing so, GBAD systems risk falling victim themselves to munitions tailored for SEAD/DEAD (suppression or destruction of enemy air defences).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This threat will be compounded by the emergence, as launch platforms, of very low observable (VLO) aircraft with significantly reduced radar cross-sections. It is likely that even those states without access to high-end stealth technologies will be able to produce aircraft that can push further into defended airspace before becoming trackable. This will accelerate if there is a proliferation of uncrewed combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), as their shapes can be far “stealthier”, owing to the lack of a crew compartment and associated life-support systems. These stealth profiles, combined with EW, make it possible for air targets to come much closer to defensive radar than is comfortable for defenders, which will be a particular challenge as the effectors carried gain range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a threat of destruction by surface-to-surface fires. Missile systems such as the Iskander and Tochka-U and multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) such as the GMLRS (guided multiple-launch rocket system) have demonstrated their utility in the context of DEAD missions at divisional depth (and beyond, for the Iskander). When cued in by UAVs as part of what in Russian parlance would be called a reconnaissance-fires complex (for MLRS) and a reconnaissance-strike complex (for missiles), such capabilities can strike mobile SAMS within minutes, particularly close to the FLOT, where UAV coverage is greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second challenge that air defenders will face is a shrinking delta between capabilities which can be used en masse and those which are more precise. Previously inaccurate threats – including air-launched glide bombs and rockets – are likely to increase in accuracy by an order of magnitude. This, in turn, will make it possible for putative opponents to achieve lethal effects with platforms which might previously have represented a marginal threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This threat will likely emanate from adversary fourth-generation fast air, with its reach extended by relatively cheap standoff weapons. Legacy air defence systems have demonstrated that they can pose sufficient threat to aircraft at medium altitude to significantly degrade the accuracy of delivered effects. Modern man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS) can, meanwhile, effectively deter penetration by fourth-generation fighters at low level, because of the unpredictability of the location of MANPADS teams. Finally, an adversary aircraft operating over the FLOT faces a considerable risk of being destroyed by defensive counter-air patrols. However, the nascent ability of fourth-generation aircraft to attack with large volumes of reasonably precise standoff munitions from within the safety of a friendly air defence network can alter this dynamic considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advent of guidance kits and glide kits, even at the most basic, is proving that inaccurate iron bombs can now achieve ranges of up to 70 km when lofted, and that they are likely to become highly accurate in the near future, with only limited investment. Although unsophisticated, these munitions pose a serious threat to static or point targets because they can have an explosive payload in excess of 500 kg and thus cause considerable damage; moreover, these munitions are cheap, plentiful and can be released in volume. Although they must be lofted from medium altitude (where the launch aircraft may expose itself) to achieve maximum range, the flight profile prior to loft may be lower and, if launched against targets in shallow depth, can offer a very narrow window for air defences to threaten the aircraft. Guidance kits can also be fitted to older, inaccurate surface-based systems to create a more precise capability – as Iran has done for Hezbollah’s unguided Zelzal-2 rockets, effectively transforming the 200 km-range rocket into a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM). This type of transformation could see the scale of the tactical ballistic threat increase by an order of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attack aviation such as the Russian Ka-52 helicopter provides another launch vector for massed guided and unguided fires. Though less capable of reducing its signatures, attack aviation is likely to remain a serious threat to tactical ground formations due to the ability to hover and operate at extremely low altitude, as well as terrain mask. To retain survivability, attack aviation aims to fire munitions with ranges in excess of 10 km, taking themselves out of the MANPADS threat envelope. Efforts are also underway to field air-launched effects – essentially UAVs and other complex weapons – launched from helicopters to enable the pilots to direct complex attacks on targets. As the cost of these munitions increases and the survivability of airframes diminishes, countries may reduce the emphasis placed on attack aviation, but for now the main threat they pose is that they can carry and orchestrate a wide range of effects with very little latency between launch and strike. For a commander, attack aviation offers the flexibility of being able to manoeuvre precise firepower quickly from point to point as an anti-tank reserve. While attack aviation may primarily be a threat at the edge, it can inflict disproportionate attrition on a manoeuvre element that is not effectively protected by GBAD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third challenge for future air defenders is that of timely threat detection and classification against complex targets. This will be driven by a convergence of the systems already discussed with threats such as cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, HGVs and loitering munitions. Each threat is optimised to reduce defenders’ warning times in different ways, meaning that solutions optimised against one are likely to be inapplicable against others. In themselves, most cruise missiles are large, and are usually subsonic for most of their flight. Given that they fly low, in dense air, supersonic flight limits their range, though supersonic cruise missiles such as the P-800 Oniks can still be effective out to 400 km. Hypersonic cruise missiles, which must carry both a rocket propulsion system and a scramjet engine to achieve hypersonic flight, are likely to be even more limited in their range, compared to comparably sized missiles. Though supersonic and hypersonic cruise missiles will be restricted in terms of range, manoeuvrability, and in some cases payload, they will be difficult to intercept and will have the kinetic energy on impact to penetrate hardened targets. They will pose a challenge at tactical depth and can also pose one at operational and strategic depths if a launch platform such as a cruise missile submarine (SSGN) escapes detection. Their cost, however, limits the number of targets that justify their use. Subsonic cruise missiles are a much more common threat. These are relatively easy to intercept, but are difficult to track, because of the complexity of their flight paths and the fact that they can employ penetration aids and accelerate at key phases to complicate engagements. Given their accuracy, cruise missiles must be engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most cruise missiles are difficult to find but relatively simple to intercept once tracked, ballistic missiles are easy to detect but are often difficult to intercept, due to their speed, and are likely to become more challenging targets. Short- and medium-range ballistic missiles are relatively easy to intercept at present, as illustrated by the success in testing of THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defence), as well as by Saudi Arabia’s intercept rate against Houthi SRBMs with Patriot and Ukraine’s successes with Patriot against SRBMs and air-launched ballistic missiles. Longer-range missiles are considerably faster and thus harder to engage. Moreover, even SRBMs are becoming more survivable. Like cruise missiles, they are liable to dispense penetration aids, complicating targeting, with the caveat that they move fast enough to mean that a penetration aid can only provide a short window of protection. Furthermore, more and more ballistic missiles will adopt quasi-ballistic trajectories, defying simple interception mapping – as seen with the 9M723 and the North Korean KN-24. The separation of warheads from the missile body in the terminal phase on some ballistic missiles can create a further complication, as defensive systems must distinguish between the missile body and the warhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HGVs may be understood as combining the challenges posed by cruise and ballistic missiles. Ballistic missiles descend on their targets at hypersonic speeds, but because they fly with a high arc, they are visible to radar for much of their flight. An HGV, in contrast, may achieve a much shallower angle of attack and alter course, reducing the time available to plot its trajectory. HGVs – unlike air-launched ballistic missiles such as the Kinzhal – are unlikely to become cheap enough to be available in large numbers. This is partly because the speeds involved impose non-symmetrical friction on the missile surfaces, leading to a requirement for highly complex materials to be employed in the body of the munition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air defenders will face competing dilemmas, as they will be confronted by both missiles and loitering munitions. Loitering munitions may be understood as lower payload, simpler cruise missiles – they fly low and slow, usually carrying payloads below 40 kg (still sufficient to cause substantial damage to most tactical targets). Simple loitering munitions able to strike throughout operational depth can cost as little as $30,000. The trajectory of development for loitering munitions is likely to see several areas of growing sophistication, without significant increases in cost. First, loitering munitions are likely to attain improved hardening of their navigation systems. Second, the use of software-defined radios should enhance their ability to collaborate (there is a cost to the software development, but it does not lead to a massive increase in unit cost for hardware). It is also likely that, at a cost of around $100,000 per unit, loitering munitions can retain a command link and thereby have a full motion video guidance capability in their terminal phase, enabling strikes on mobile targets. Thirdly, the low speeds of loitering munitions and some UAVs mean that they can be sifted out by the Doppler gates of radar as clutter – as occurred with Russian Pantsir radar against Turkish TB-2 UAVs early in the conflict in Syria. Radar operating modes can be altered – Russia quickly did this in March 2022 – but this imposes cognitive load on operators (from clutter), and increases training burdens. Although loitering munitions can be brought down by crew-served weapons if shooters are properly positioned, having shooters in the right place is a significant C2 challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack systems described above are all, in themselves, beatable. Collectively, however, they impose conflicting imperatives on a defensive architecture. For example, the task of engaging low-flying fast air requires a different set of sensors and effectors to that of intercepting VLO aircraft. Similarly, the interception of threat types that can be fielded en masse demands interceptors which can be expended at scale, while defence against cruise and ballistic missiles requires more expensive effectors with the manoeuvrability and sensor payload to engage these targets. The need to avoid suppression, particularly close to the FLOT, imposes a different dilemma. Avoiding suppression is best achieved through passive methods of detection, such as passive coherent location, as well as non-radar-based solutions. However, the delivery of track-quality data over wide areas still requires the use of active radar, at the risk of suppression or destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implications-for-tactical-defence&quot;&gt;Implications for Tactical Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, air defence in tactical depth has primarily been concerned with penetrating aviation and strike aircraft. Cruise and ballistic missiles – being expensive and consequently scarce assets – have been a concern for operational headquarters and other higher-echelon targets. Because aviation and strike aircraft were necessarily even more expensive than cruise missiles, maximising the probability of kill (Pk) by deploying highly sophisticated air defence munitions was a sensible investment. Air defence thus became a question of maximising Pk, and extending range to be able to engage strike aircraft enablers. Tactics evolved around aiming multiple missiles at a given aircraft to force the pilot into sub-optimal trade-offs against differing threats. The effect of maximising Pk is not just that it makes attempts to strike tactical targets extremely dangerous, but that this in itself deters attempts, increasing the enablement necessary to prosecute strikes with a reasonable probability of scarce aircraft surviving. This therefore limits the number of sorties that can be mounted. North Vietnamese SAMS, for example, imposed a requirement on the US Air Force to generate some 80 combat aircraft to conduct a raid on a given target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach of maximising the Pk of air defence systems is now being fundamentally challenged, for three reasons. Firstly, the range of threats to tactical formations is expanding to include threats which might previously only have been encountered with conventional payloads at the operational/strategic levels. Secondly, many classes of threat are drastically cheaper and thus more plentiful than legacy defensive missiles. The cost of defensive systems aimed at optimising Pk against high-end threats necessarily reduces the diversity of systems that can be afforded and deployed. For example, a hit-to-kill missile with an infrared (IR) seeker optimised for ballistic missile defence (BMD) in the upper atmosphere is not an ideal means of intercepting air-breathing and quasi-ballistic threats at altitudes where IR seekers do not work well at the high speeds achieved by BMD interceptors. Radar-equipped missiles with blast fragmentation warheads work well against air-breathing threats, but are a sub-optimal tool for BMD: each type of missile has a price in the millions of US dollars and is fired from a bespoke system. As high-end threats diversify, the characteristics of systems optimised for detecting and engaging them diverge, driving a tendency towards holding multiple missile types that are industrially expensive to develop and retain. For example, it has been estimated that a point defence of Guam with the layered defensive systems needed to counter the full spectrum of likely threats would cost $5 billion. The third challenge is that an air defence approach that prioritises the maximisation of Pk against high-end threats is more difficult to develop iteratively and quickly than the systems that are intended to spoof or otherwise degrade defensive efficiency. This means that in any conflict, the Pk of a system risks diminishing over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measure of effectiveness at the tactical level, then, should not be the Pk of individual systems against specific threats, but rather the ability of the air and missile defence system as a whole to deliver enough protection within a given time period for specific tasks such as concentration for an attack. This is a departure from the metrics that predominated in the past, because capability is measured at the system level, not the platform level, and is bounded by time and by task. A high Pk in initial engagements is of limited value if the air defence system is exhausted through inefficient use of interceptors such that Pk subsequently collapses. To a significant degree, therefore, the effectiveness of an air defence system is increasingly determined by the capacity of the C2 system to allocate effectors against appropriate targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;threats-in-operational-and-strategic-depth&quot;&gt;Threats in Operational and Strategic Depth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational and strategic levels, in a European context, the scenario used to frame the discussion is a Russian Strategic Operation for the Destruction of Critically Important Enemy Targets. This is not the only context in which the UK can expect to employ its GBAD capabilities, but it is the one most likely to involve risks to targets at both operational depth and at strategic depth within the UK. Military targets likely to be prioritised by an adversary at operational and strategic depth include SPODs and APODs and command nodes at the corps echelon and above. Assets upon which the functioning of the joint force depends, such as airbases and CAOCs (combined air operations centres), are also likely to be targeted. In addition, critical civilian infrastructure, including power generation facilities, is likely to be targeted. These targets may not all be in significant depth, but a critical mass of them are likely to be rearward of the corps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat environment at the operational and strategic levels is different from the tactical threat environment in several ways. On the one hand, the range needed to strike targets at depth and the payload requirements needed to inflict meaningful damage on facilities such as airbases limit the utility of many platforms which might be tactically useful. One-way attack UAVs, for example, can be useful as a terror weapon, but given their payload limitations (a Shahed-136 carries around 40 kg of explosive material), they have limited utility against critical targets that have appropriate protections, unless part of a complex strike where they are used for reconnaissance or to strike defence systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to 500 km, the threat at the operational level will be complex, combining SRBMs, cruise missiles, attack aircraft and UAVs. In many respects, this is similar to the tactical-level threat environment: the ranges involved, as well as the presence of protected or hardened high-value targets such as command posts and ammunition storage sites, will see the number of cruise and ballistic missiles at these depths increase relative to UAVs. A greater premium is likely to be placed on large payloads and a higher probability of penetration and the presence of high-value targets at these depths justifies more expensive forms of attack – which is why, for example, Ukraine has used Storm Shadow cruise missiles against operational-level targets, to much greater effect than its salvos of UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond 500 km, and particularly at strategic depth, the ballistic threat picture will be circumscribed, as the most likely adversaries do not field large numbers of intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs). Russia, for example, has only the Kinzhal for use at intermediate ranges, having cancelled the RS-26 Rubezh IRBM. Moreover, even states with large numbers of ballistic missiles typically use them to enable other capabilities. For example, China intends to use its ballistic missiles to trap US aircraft in their hangars by cratering runways, enabling follow-on attacks by cruise missiles. For Russia, which has fewer intermediate-range ballistic options and needs to conserve these options for sub-strategic nuclear use, the need to use capabilities such as Kinzhal and the Kh-BD judiciously will be more acute. The most likely use cases for ballistic missiles involve either enabling the effective use of cruise missiles, or strikes upon command nodes. As such, the challenge beyond 500 km is in certain ways more bounded than the tactical challenge, and will largely revolve around cruise missiles enabled by a more limited number of medium-range ballistic missiles and IRBMs, which trap their targets or eliminate defensive systems that engage cruise missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the threat at the army deep and beyond is more potent. Since many targets likely to be deemed valuable at operational and strategic depth are static, it is simpler to achieve the convergence of different capabilities moving against them at different speeds. While this level of convergence against mobile targets is discussed at a theoretical level by militaries such as China’s People’s Liberation Army, it has already been demonstrated by Russia in its attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid, which have combined UAVs, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geography and force laydowns are a consideration in any European context. Most Russian threats to the UK homeland emanating from the Western Military District would need to traverse the airspace of several NATO members, raising the probability of intercept well ahead of their reaching the UK. Moreover, on this flank, the surface vessels of the Baltic fleet which serve as launch platforms for cruise missiles such as the 3M-14 Kalibr are not survivable in a full-scale conflict involving Russia and NATO. However, this is not to say that all approaches to the UK are equally well covered, with the assets under Russia’s Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command (OSK Sever) in particular presenting a credible threat to the homeland, as they can strike from positions relatively close to Russia’s bastions. Over time, as NATO stands up a maritime component command in a crisis, the northern flank would also become comparatively more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, some launch platforms for Russian strike capabilities are more survivable, and could theoretically conduct strikes against the UK, giving defenders very limited warning – for example, the Yasen-class SSGN, which is equipped with 40 vertical launching system (VLS) cells and which can launch a variety of cruise missiles, including the 3M-14 Kalibr and the hypersonic Zircon. Platforms such as the Yasen or the older but still quiet Akula class can, if they escape into the Atlantic, launch strikes against targets such as airbases at ranges that would leave little room for aircraft hosted there to scramble. This would create a “flaming datum” – a last known location of the submarine, which would increase the risk of destruction; consequently the range of targets that might justify risking the use of a high-value asset in this way is limited, with the most likely candidates being fifth-generation aircraft, maritime patrol aircraft bases and critical C2 nodes, the RN base at Faslane, and CNI. As a conflict progressed, aircraft might well be dispersed, making suppression more difficult, and as such the threat would be most acute in the early stages of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to high-value capabilities, Russia has developed containerised versions of missiles such as the Klub-K, which can be fired from the decks of cargo vessels, a mode of operation that could allow it to strike targets inside the UK with limited warning. Russian-flagged vessels and those that have left Russian ports are likely to be closely watched in a conflict, meaning that this kind of attack could only be attempted once (or at the commencement of fighting), but should even a fraction of vessels armed in this way strike militarily significant targets before being interdicted, this would represent a militarily useful effect for the loss of disposable assets. Finally, there is the threat from Russia’s long-range bombers, which can launch salvos of cruise missiles. Given NATO’s relative superiority in the air, such strikes would be unlikely to be repeatable, but early in a conflict would pose a risk of a strike against key sites from relatively close range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also several long-term risks to be considered. Russia’s exit from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty means that it can now more openly build ground-launched cruise missiles such as the SSC-8, as well as IRBMs. The launchers of such capabilities will likely be more survivable, and thus impose limits on left-of-launch solutions. Furthermore, if VLO UCAVs such as a successor to Russia’s Okhotnik or the Chinese GJ-11 become a part of their arsenal, the Russian Aerospace Forces may have an improved ability to strike targets such as air-defence radar, leading to the threat to emitting radar – currently primarily a problem at the tactical edge – becoming an issue at the operational and strategic levels. If, similarly, Russia develops a much larger intermediate-range ballistic arsenal (potentially through its increasing industrial collaboration with Iran and North Korea), the ballistic missile threat at strategic depth could become more significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat to the homeland is likely to be most potent early in a conflict, when the value of strategic surprise is highest and NATO Joint Force Air Components (JFACs) and Maritime Component Commands are being stood up. After this, high-value targets will have dispersed, and many of the approaches to the UK will be covered by assets in the maritime domain, or by allies’ air-defence networks. The most important role for GBAD in a homeland defence context will thus be early in a conflict, when it can act as a last layer of point defence for critical targets. The ability to disincentivise surprise – which could be possible if a ship or submarine slipped allied maritime nets – will be an important pillar of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat to ports, APODs, fuel and munitions storage sites, and command posts in Europe beyond the homeland will likely persist over the course of a conflict. Buried targets such as command posts will primarily need to be defended against HGVs, ballistic missiles and, to a lesser extent, cruise missiles. In contrast, softer-skinned targets are more likely to be engaged with a spectrum of threats, including one-way attack UAVs. Forward bastions such as Kaliningrad could allow Russia to use shorter-range missiles such as the 9M723 or the P-800 against targets that would normally have required medium- or intermediate-range missiles. Of course, not everything can always be protected, and priorities for protection will be determined in line with a Joint Prioritised and Defended Assets List. Air defences including GBAD will likely be most important in the early phases of a conflict, when a force is deploying, and near those nodes that are both critical and which cannot be defended by passive measures such as concealment, hardening or dispersion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, then, there are two major roles for UK GBAD at the operational and strategic levels within Europe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing a last layer of point defence for critical facilities within the homeland in the very early stages of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contributing to the defence of operational-level targets such as APODs, SPODs and headquarters in continental Europe for the duration of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an expeditionary context, shorter-range threats may have operational-strategic significance. This stems from the fact that many theatres do not have the depth that Europe possesses. Additionally, in expeditionary contexts where power projection typically depends upon a local coalition partner, the homeland of this (usually nearby) state becomes a strategic target in the way one’s own homeland would in a territorial defence context in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in the Persian Gulf, UAVs, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles are all capable of striking operationally and strategically relevant targets. The diffusion of precision strike capabilities means that many of the air threats currently emerging within Europe will likely also be faced in a wider range of contexts. For instance, Iran currently fields ballistic missiles such as the Zolfaghar, which has a CEP (circular error probable) of 10 metres, and the Fattah, a quasi-ballistic missile comparable to the Kinzhal. The proliferation of commercially available satellite imagery can, moreover, make the surveillance of fixed infrastructure and well-known chokepoints with relatively low data latency viable for a range of opponents, and not just peers. Finally, in geographically constrained theatres, comparatively cheap assets with a limited field of view (for example UAVs such as the Chinese-made Wing Loong) can also be used for surveillance and battle damage assessment near fixed infrastructure, enabling more responsive targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having described the threat environment, we now turn to the question of the tools with which defenders can contend with the range of threats they will face, and the ways in which these tools can be integrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-surveying-the-tools-of-the-defence&quot;&gt;II. Surveying the Tools of the Defence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preceding survey of the threat landscape that the UK’s IAMD must be able to contend with highlights some of the characteristics that are necessary for an effective defence. The spectrum of threats described necessitates a shift away from functional localisation – in which each system performs a defined task – towards a more distributed approach. In the latter context, effectiveness is determined at the system level, rather than through the platform-level metrics that presently characterise IAMD (such as the distance at which a target is detected, the number of shots possible, and missile Pk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift in focus implies the following sub-criteria for effectiveness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because the sensors needed to classify the full spectrum of threats cannot be held at all echelons, British IAMD must be able to assign or leverage a range of British and allied systems (some of them not purpose-built for air defence) to detect, classify and track threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;British IAMD must also be able to assign the best positioned and most economical effector to engage a given threat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The IAMD architecture must not be premised upon single points of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To meet evolving threats, the defensive architecture must be able to incorporate new sensors and effectors as these are iteratively developed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this context, British Army GBAD will need to be designed around the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Army GBAD must be able to both draw on and contribute to a joint and Alliance-level recognised air picture that enables assets organic to manoeuvre formations to leverage data from higher echelons (and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since the army will not immediately own the range of effectors needed to intercept the full spectrum of threats, it must be able to contribute to a joint and allied defensive counter-air effort by reinforcing system-level effectiveness. It can do so by optimising against converging lower-tier threats, thus allowing other platforms to optimise against elements of the threat spectrum that still require bespoke solutions (such as ballistic missiles or HGVs). It can also accomplish this by reinforcing the resilience and agility of the overall C2 architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since new capabilities may be fielded, the army’s GBAD system must be sufficiently flexible to integrate systems it was not originally designed to incorporate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess how best to integrate the various components, it is first necessary to consider the sensors and effectors most relevant to engaging the identified threats. This too must be broken into tactical and operational-strategic targets, as there are different assumptions that can be made about the availability of power and the distances involved, which alter the available sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tactical-defensive-systems-and-capabilities&quot;&gt;Tactical Defensive Systems and Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defensive systems can be categorised in line with the threats that they counter, each of which presents different requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low-level threats.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medium-level threats.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High-level threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-level threats&lt;/strong&gt; comprise tactical aviation, loitering munitions, cruise missiles and low-flying aircraft. In essence, these threats try to minimise their detectability and therefore targetability by using the curvature of the Earth and terrain masking as they approach their targets. The targeting methodology for countering these threats must be based upon detection and tracking over as great a distance as possible to understand their route before moving appropriate assets into position to interdict them. A system of mutually reinforcing methods of detection to enable this might be comprised of four layers, as described below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the force would benefit from early warning left of launch through national technical means. Understanding that a strike sortie is being prepared from an airbase, or that orders have been distributed to fire a loitering munition salvo in depth – whether through satellite imagery or signals intelligence (SIGINT) – allows the alert status of relevant systems to be brought into readiness. For example, US Northern Command expects to fuse data from multiple sources to detect preparations for ballistic missile launches several days in advance. If air defence assets are likely to have to move to be in position to achieve an intercept, early warning allows these mobile groups to prepare to move once an axis has been identified. This will be easier to achieve against some threat types, such as air-launched cruise missiles such as the Kh-101, which are launched from strategic bombers. While it is possible to track the launch platforms of submarine- and ground-launched cruise missiles, these are comparatively elusive. Even here, however, national technical means – particularly in areas like SIGINT – will be invaluable. The challenge is to distribute information to deployed GBAD headquarters at the appropriate classification, since Above Secret traffic is often hard to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, a sensor picket needs to have sufficient coverage to be able to detect and track threats as they approach their targets. Tactical echelons can draw on sensors likely to be held at the corps level or by other services. For example, an AN/TPY-2 radar organic to the THAAD system can spot relatively low-radar cross-section objects above 10,000 feet over a wide area at ranges of 250 km. The THAAD system is likely to be held at theatre level (or at the corps echelon at the very lowest), and operated by allies, but can provide critical early warning to tactical air defences. Airborne or elevated payloads able to provide track data to an effector can considerably expand a system’s reach without exposing operators on the ground. Such a sensor might be mounted on a balloon, a UAV, a helicopter or a mast. This class of sensor also includes airborne sensors such as the AN/APG-81 radar on the F-35, which are capable of effective discrimination against low-profile targets. Crucially, not all these sensors will be controlled by the Land Component Command, but their data, when available, will be important for target discrimination. The purpose of such a system would be to enable higher-end munitions to have track-quality data against low-flying targets such as helicopters and cruise missiles if they evaded the laydown of effectors on their anticipated flight path, and where the defensive system is not sitting as point defence for the intended target. This kind of integrated sensor picture should become easier to maintain as AESA radar proliferate, providing multifunctional payloads. Although such a multifunctional radar may not provide track-quality data, improved analytical tools are increasingly able to turn sub-track-quality data into a sufficiently reliable track to guide an intercept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third layer of situational awareness is drawn from sensors held by the tactical formations with which GBAD systems will operate and which they will protect. Since system-level effectiveness requires leveraging multiple types of data, GBAD can often benefit from drawing on sensors which are part of other formations, particularly when operators wish to avoid unmasking. These sensors include spectrometers (able to identify loitering munitions through their control frequencies and attack aviation through communications), acoustic sensors (able to detect the engine sound of low-flying objects), and passive coherent locating radar. There are a wide range of uses for these kinds of sensors. Spectrometers will be held by EW troops, while acoustic sensors can be used by artillery for counterbattery fire, and by manoeuvre elements for identifying enemy firing positions; if mounted on vehicles, they can also be distributed across the depth of a defence to provide updated tracks on munitions such as cruise missiles. Passive coherent location is more specialised, but is likely to become significantly more widespread, because of the requirement for units to self-protect from uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), while avoiding detection via direction-finding methods that can allow their positions to be inferred based on the signals they emit. The question is whether the detections from these sensors can be provided to the air defence system to offer a track for low-flying targets. This track is not sufficient to guide effectors, but is likely sufficient to accurately predict course and speed, and to cue other sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final component of the system may be understood as the sensors directly linked to effectors on the platforms attempting to achieve an intercept. An obvious example would be the Giraffe radar organic to a system such as Sky Sabre. In the case of UAVs, heavy machine guns on remote weapon stations should be able to slew to engage if appropriately programmed, using their electro-optical sensors; the trick would be to place these effectors on the flight path identified. In the case of MANPADS, which can be an economical means of engaging more capable UAVs and engaging cruise missiles, the electro-optical clue is sufficient. For aviation, high velocity missiles and lightweight multirole missiles are both viable munitions, as are 40-mm CTC cannon and other systems, provided the platform is aligned to anticipate the threat. This is easier said than done, however. In many instances, threats such as cruise missiles will be programmed to use flight paths that use terrain masking, and which allow them to approach their targets on circuitous routes, reducing warning times and confounding efforts to align platforms with threat vectors, thus reinforcing the importance of leveraging data from offboard sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium- and high-level threats&lt;/strong&gt; comprising ballistic missiles and VLO aircraft (among others) will depend on a similar sensor architecture. The primary difference is that defending against these targets will impose a greater reliance on bespoke, rather than general, solutions. (Consideration of the threat from ballistic missiles is similar to the defence of operational-strategic assets, and so will be covered in the next section.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding VLO aircraft, different VLO implementations will have different exposure. The challenge lies in understanding the unique signature of these platforms, and in sifting that signature from the noise. One of the hardest things for an aircraft to mitigate, however, is its visual signature against the sky, such that image-recognition algorithms and electro-optical sensors can be paired to pick out VLO aircraft. Even so, the visibility of these aircraft does not necessarily mean that a missile can acquire a target: it may require beam riding or other solutions to enable an electro-optical camera to guide the munition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to a layered architecture for detection and classification, an IAMD system needs an appropriate mix of effectors. This mix includes: short-range solutions with high performance to defeat fast targets such as cruise missiles; short-range solutions with low performance to defeat threats such as loitering munitions; medium-range solutions able to close down approach axes to aviation and fast air; and long-range solutions that are able to defeat aircraft at high altitude, as well as providing point and area defence against tactical ballistic missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army is unlikely to own the full spectrum of effectors, given the current budgetary allocation for GBAD. Many effectors relevant to tasks such as long-range air defence and BMD (Patriot, for instance) will be operated by allies. In terms of command relationships, medium- and upper-tier air defence systems will often fall under the control of the air and missile defence commander within the JFAC who exercises control over maritime platforms capable of BMD. This means that the army will also need to plan around the eventuality that some of the systems that it owns are not always protecting manoeuvre formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, even when the British Army does not control allied and joint assets, the ability to draw data from them will be critical to performing many air defence functions, especially when the full spectrum of interceptors is not available because the air defence commander has tasked them elsewhere. As illustrated by the Iranian attacks on Al-Asad and Erbil, where early warning from the US’s Space-Based Infrared System and the Turkish-based AN/TPY-2 radar gave unprotected US forces time to take cover, an integrated system creates avenues to pursue reversionary mechanisms when resources are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, land sensors can provide early warning and occasionally track to other systems under the JFAC. The G-AMB radar on Sky Sabre, for example, can provide data on an overflying cruise missile to an offshore destroyer to enable a remote engagement (interceptor ranges typically exceed sensor ranges). As such, those air defence capabilities that are organic to British ground formations and nearby allied forces can produce data for the theatre commander, rather than just ingesting it. In contexts where the British Army is providing a C2 structure for an allied ground force in a given part of a theatre, this necessitates the ability to both ingest data from British and allied assets and to pass it to the JFAC in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defensive-systems-and-capabilities-at-the-operational-and-strategic-levels&quot;&gt;Defensive Systems and Capabilities at the Operational and Strategic Levels&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar layered sensor architecture is likely to be needed at the operational and strategic levels. Where possible, launch platforms will be identified by national technical means, while maintaining tracks on manoeuvring targets over a wide theatre will necessitate a reliance on offboard sources, including air-based systems. The primary differences between systems relevant to threats to targets in tactical and operational depth is that the latter requires tracking fast-moving targets such as ballistic missiles, which necessitates a greater reliance on dedicated radar, typically operating between the S-band and the X-band. The high speed of targets like ballistic missiles and HGVs makes the rapid acquisition of track-quality data a priority. Thus, the sensors relevant to this part of the detection and classification cycles must be activated and cued as quickly as possible. This, coupled with the relatively low risk of suppression at depth, incentivises a greater reliance on active radar organic to a system. That said, non-radar-based sensors will still be needed for tasks such as discriminating targets from decoys in their terminal phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of UK GBAD equipment likely to be procured under the current equipment plan will not have the organic sensors needed to track many of the threats the UK will face, and the interceptors to deal with several classes of threat will also be lacking. For example, under current plans, the UK will have no ground-based BMD or counter-hypersonic capability, creating a capability gap which will need to be addressed as part of a wider IAMD strategy. Under present assumptions, the land-based component of UK IAMD will only be functional at the operational and strategic levels of warfare, in tandem with joint force and allied assets. This is not to say that UK GBAD cannot play an important supporting role, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in previous sections, cruise missiles constitute the primary threat at the strategic level. Assuming that the RN is able to provide at least one Type 45 (or, in the future, Type 83) destroyer for BMD missions, the army and the RAF can facilitate the RN’s limited VLS capacity being allocated to BMD by respectively providing point and area defence against cruise missiles. The RAF, which can respond across a wide area with its Typhoon aircraft, is best suited to area defence, while army MRAD and SHORAD can provide point defence for key nodes. If the threat evolves to include a larger number of adversary IRBMs or a limited number of conventionally armed HGVs, there may be a case for a national BMD or counter-hypersonic capability equivalent to Arrow-3 (which Germany has purchased for this role). Given the difficulties inherent in developing a domestic solution, this would mean a potential requirement to integrate new (and likely non-UK) capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the Land GBAD programme could have a disproportionate cognitive impact on enemy planning for operational and strategic strikes. If, for example, the enemy assesses that key RAF bases are undefended, then the risk/reward calculus in conducting a small-scale raid with long-range bombers may appear more attractive. Although the strike platform could be lost, the probability of effect on target if the missiles were launched would be high. If, by contrast, the enemy must plan on the basis of GBAD providing point defence to these facilities, then the size of sortie that must be generated to be confident of achieving an effect alters the risk/reward calculus. Moreover, the inability to determine which munitions would succeed in striking which targets – even as part of a large salvo – would make the impact on the target unpredictable. In this way, relatively small investments in GBAD have the potential to significantly alter how attractive targets in the UK appear to the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the operational level within Europe, as well as on expeditionary missions, the threat environment will be more complex, comprising SRBMs, cruise missiles, loitering munitions and fixed-wing threats. In these contexts, in addition to providing sensors and effectors against certain threat types, the British Army can add greatest value to what is likely to be an Allied or coalition system by reinforcing that system’s capacity to coordinate its disparate elements and to retain its coherence in the face of disruption. In terms of effectors, it is worth noting that Sky Sabre is particularly well-suited to being assigned intercepts of cruise missiles targeting key sites, and this layer of defence is something the British Army can offer to allies. The key requirements for UK GBAD at the operational/strategic levels are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Providing a data fusion node and reversionary C2 mechanism to coordinate sensors and effectors that reside under the joint force or allied control.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Countering the lower-tier elements of the threat spectrum to allow other assets to optimise against upper-tier threats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar classification of target types – high-, medium- and low-altitude – can be adopted to that used at the tactical level, with the caveat that at the operational/strategic level, targets such as HGVs will blur distinctions. The balance of relatively bespoke sensors needed to track many operational threats means that they will be national or Alliance assets. Moreover, planned ground-based platforms will not, for the foreseeable future, carry hit-to-kill interceptors, meaning that the UK’s BMD capability will be primarily maritime. Effectors that can be used in counter-hypersonics, such as glide phase interceptors, are also not currently envisioned, and will likely be held by allies (and potentially by the RN).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of C2, key capabilities at the operational/strategic level will likely fall under a NATO Air Component Command (ACC). This could be true for Sky Sabre, if authority over it is transferred to the NATO C2 structure, but also for lower-tier capabilities that may be required to act as “gate guardians” protecting long-range air and missile defence systems from low-flying threats – such as UAVs that underfly their radar. The UK has insufficient Sky Sabre systems at present, and would face severe overstretch in trying to protect a combination of UK sites, deployed forces and NATO. In exercises, the assumption is often that UK Sky Sabre would be under divisional command. This is not a sound planning assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in many instances, British land forces will not directly command joint and allied assets, they can reinforce the resilience of joint and allied C2. The allied C2 nodes that provide overall coherence will likely be targeted and may be struck; to degrade gracefully, a system must have nodes which can control locally adjacent assets in the absence of higher-level C2, and coordinate with other similarly situated command capabilities if needed. This requires the existence of reversionary command posts, and for the bearers to transfer data to and from them. For example, in the context of the Russian integrated air defence system, battalion-level data fusion and C2 nodes such as the D4M1 Polyana and the 55K6E can allow both the coordination of assets and the fusion of data even if higher-echelon command posts are knocked out. Developments in areas such as software-defined signal processing, illustrated by programmes such as DARPA’s (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) Dynamo, show the ways in which improvements in processing power will make networking across waveforms easier over time. The US Army’s Integrated Battle Command System has coordinated multiple disparate assets at its engagement operations centres, routing data either through gateways or through third-party platforms that can receive certain waveforms and retransmit them at compatible frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the army C2 construct supporting air defence does not own many of the most relevant sensors and effectors, it should be able to reinforce the resilience of an allied or coalition system by coordinating elements of an operational-level defence over a given sector of a theatre (within Europe) or the entirety of a smaller theatre (at reach) on a reversionary basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to reversionary C2, the British Army should be capable of contributing to a shared recognised air picture at army deep and beyond. In the context of cruise missile defence, the army can do this with its own sensors; when forward deployed with manoeuvre formations, these sensors can feed data back about targets – such as cruise missiles which overfly them. In the context of BMD missions, the army’s lack of BMD-capable radar can be offset by a C2 architecture that allows it to incorporate data from BMD-capable allied tactical assets (such as the G/ATOR), enabling it to relay this information to higher echelons when it is needed without their being overwhelmed by data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it is uneconomical in terms of data management to have these platforms feeding into CAOCs or maritime air operations centres on a persistent basis, one way for their utility to be leveraged when they are needed for IAMD is for the GBAD C2 architecture to mediate data flows. As such, both BMD and counter-hypersonics require that UK GBAD C2 must be capable of distributing relevant data to higher echelons on a time-sensitive basis. It may also become necessary to share data with national civil defence authorities (much as the Israel Defense Forces do with Israel’s Home Front Command), especially if not every inch of national soil can be defended. In undefended areas, air defence can still contribute to warning mechanisms, as in the app-based systems used in Israel and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, army air defences can optimise for point defence against cruise missiles, aircraft and loitering munitions. This will be important both to allow other joint and allied force elements to optimise against upper-tier threats, and to defend the very systems that enable tasks like BMD (since many defensive systems optimised for higher-tier threats are themselves vulnerable to low-flying ones). Consider, for example, a 2017 incident in which a North Korean UAV was found crashed near South Korea’s THAAD site, having flown there unobserved. Several types of sensor may be relevant to this function. First, radar can be combined with methods of detection such as electro-optical and IR sensors. These sensors can usefully aid discrimination against targets that carry countermeasures optimised to defeat radar. Secondly, and as at the tactical level, elevated radar can considerably expand coverage and thus system alertness (the British Army holds several G-AMB radar, unattached to Sky Sabre batteries, that could contribute to this role). While radar suppression at depth is relatively unlikely, the fact that it may become more likely could also incentivise drawing on sources such as civilian radar to complicate the task of suppression and limit the time for which a dedicated military radar must emit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of capabilities needed to contend with a complex threat environment makes their effective coordination a complex organisational and systems-engineering task. It is to the question of how this task might be accomplished that the paper now turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-requirements-for-land-gbad-c2&quot;&gt;III. Requirements for Land GBAD C2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having considered the span of threats that a future Land GBAD C2 architecture must be able to manage, and the breadth of sensors and effectors that tackling these threats may need to draw upon, it becomes possible to outline some characteristics of a future-proof C2 architecture. This chapter outlines these requirements, both in terms of the systems the C2 architecture must integrate, and where decision-making is located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moving-beyond-integral-c2-relationships&quot;&gt;Moving Beyond Integral C2 Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Army is fundamentally an expeditionary force, and this is critical to its utility to the British state. By offering partners and allies reinforcement, the British military allows threats to be contested at reach. The challenges of force projection mean that the British military often finds itself deployed without all its equipment, and that the exact timeline on equipment availability is shaped by the distance at which it is projected and the available infrastructure. Furthermore, while land forces may provide a key contribution in some theatres, the capabilities relevant to tasks such as defence against tactical ballistic missiles may be maritime, or a partner capability. The key point is that when the UK fights, it necessarily does so as a joint and multinational force – and this is especially true in the context of air defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as having an expeditionary character, the British military is also becoming more dependent upon – and integrated with – its partners and allies. During the First World War, Lord Kitchener directly instructed that the British Expeditionary Force was to remain under independent command, such that deconfliction with French and Belgian forces was largely achieved through the allocation of battlespace. Processes have moved on since then, and NATO C2 has long functioned on the presumption of combined air operations, multinational joint effects, and Alliance-level planning. Nonetheless, C2 has – historically – been simplified by echelons and battlespace being divided between countries. This approach has made sense, since different echelons operating fixed areas of interest could be determined by the range limitations of their sensors and effectors. Today, however, all echelons can reach and strike into operational depth, while all echelons also have access to ISR into strategic depth. In a context where effects from all echelons can be applied across one another’s boundaries, battlespace management has thus become more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criticality of being able to integrate or at a minimum interoperate with allied systems is further demonstrated by the implications of a protracted conflict. It is possible, for example, that a high-performance system with limited interoperability could offer a tactical advantage early in a conflict. But experience in Ukraine has demonstrated that as a war becomes more protracted, new systems are developed, and that dependencies on allies change as stockpiles, production rates and rationalisation change both what is available and what is produced. This dynamic may even extend to adapting air-to-air munitions to fire from the ground, or using air-to-ground munitions to fire against air targets. It follows, then, that the C2 system must be able to continue working with sensors and effectors, even as the assets assigned to the system change over time and are adapted to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a cursory examination of the sensors outlined in the previous chapter demonstrates that some of them are exquisite air defence assets (and likely permanently under the control of the air defence formation). The majority of sensors are, however, primarily tasked against other problem sets. A vehicle’s acoustic sensors, for example, are placed on the combat vehicle to detect enemy vehicle movement and origin of shot; that these sensors can provide a screen to detect enemy UAS is invaluable, but only if the C2 system can enable data to be moved to the relevant effector. Another element of the challenge is that against a low-flying threat such as a cruise missile, a passive radar on a C-UAS system forward may be able to track the munition for as much as 60 km of its flight, even while a higher-echelon air defence radar is prevented from doing so by terrain or by system characteristics – and yet it may be the higher echelon system that has the effector. Whether the track data can be passed from the forward sensor and refined sufficiently to provide a guidance solution is dependent upon latency and on the compatibility of data between systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, effectors may be held either by the air defence organisation organic to a manoeuvre formation or by an ACC. In addition to dedicated effectors, there is also a plethora of non-dedicated systems such as jammers, multispectral smoke and DRFM (digital radio frequency memory) decoys, which will not be under the direct control of the air defence organisations at any level, but which can nevertheless contribute to air defence. Coordination with these capabilities will be critical to ensure deconfliction and the economisation of interceptor expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the battlefield is increasingly flooded with sensors, many mounted on uncrewed platforms, opportunities will emerge for 7 Air Defence Group to reach beyond its own capabilities. However, the battlespace will also become more cluttered, particularly at the FLOT, as more elements of the force employ UAS. Indeed, UAS are destined to become ubiquitous at all echelons in the British Army, and the tactical context of their employment means that most UAS flights will not be cleared with the CAOC or planned in accordance with the air tasking order (ATO). In Ukraine, a significant proportion of higher-echelon UAS losses derive from friendly fire (for Russian and Ukrainian forces alike). Nor is it necessarily viable to have IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) as a widespread capability on UAS, both because they are likely to be captured in significant numbers, creating opportunities for the adversary to pass themselves off as friendly, but also because of the price-point dynamics on most UAS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the UK, the central point is that Strategic Command must exercise influence over C2 for the Land GBAD programme to ensure that it is compatible with developments within the army and across the other services, and critically that the UK’s Multi-Domain Integrated Systems programme addresses the problem of blue-force tracking in the context of expanded UAS and C-UAS coverage across the battlefield. The risk of fratricide in an environment saturated with aerial objects is real, and is amplified as air defence elements become required Tom Keatinge is the Director of the Centre for Finance and Security at RUSI.tooperate in isolation. During the invasion of Iraq in 2003, for example, isolated Patriot batteries – lacking wider situational awareness – were responsible for shootdowns of friendly aircraft. Brokering situational awareness to minimise the risk of misclassification of targets will be a major task for air defenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the light of these requirements, an effective fire-control C2 architecture must be able to manage three kinds of data relationship:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integral.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Habitual.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incidental.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integral&lt;/strong&gt; relationships can be thought of as the fixed, low-latency C2 links between air defence assets held under organic command by the headquarters. This is the type of relationship with which air defence operators across the force are currently most familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habitual&lt;/strong&gt; links, meanwhile, constitute air defence assets whose primary responsibility is the point defence or force protection of other elements of the force. These elements would usually be subordinated to the unit they are supporting, but they would benefit from the common air picture, and sometimes may also benefit from warnings provided by higher-echelon sensors under the control of the air defence headquarters. On occasion, however, these assets’ sensors may be critical to a successful air defence engagement overflying their area of responsibility, or their effectors may need to be moved to put them in position to intercept a threat against higher echelons. These units, therefore, must become habituated to having their systems periodically connected to the air defence C2 architecture, with as low a latency as possible. An obvious example would be the relationship between air defences afloat and those ashore – a relationship that should also extend to GBAD. In an Alliance context where UK GBAD platforms find themselves reallocated alongside Allied systems to support the assessed main line of effort, habitual relationships with Allied platforms will emerge, such as between Sky Sabre and Polish SA-6 systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incidental&lt;/strong&gt; links differ from the other two categories because they comprise those units that are not primarily responsible for air defence, but which may become reliant on the air defence command for the purposes of synchronising and timing their countermeasures, or because they have incidentally collected information relevant to air defence and are seeking to share it with the headquarters. Latency requirements in this context may be more relaxed. Bearers are almost certainly non-bespoke and are used by many parts of the force, but there must be a means for priority information to be routed appropriately when these situations arise. An obvious example of such a relationship would be with the sensors of aircraft that share the battlespace with GBAD systems. The incidental relationship can also run the other way, with data from air defence radar being used to extrapolate launcher locations and thus enable suppression by artillery or an over-the-horizon aircraft, for example. This approach is central to both Israeli concepts of operations and to South Korea’s “Kill Chain” system of IAMD and strike assets. While some radar are explicitly designed to determine launch points, even those that are not can narrow the search parameters for other sensors if they can track enough of a missile’s trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-technical-demands-of-context-driven-c2&quot;&gt;The Technical Demands of Context-Driven C2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three organisational/technical barriers that must be overcome if British GBAD is to manage the requisite range of relationships. First, data must be passed across alliances and coalition partners which operate a range of systems. In the context of maritime BMD, data sharing between allied systems has proven to be a considerable (but not insurmountable) systems-engineering challenge, a point illustrated over the course of multiple iterations of Exercise Formidable Shield. National caveats are also a concern. One example of these (albeit not from the world of IAMD) is that in the past it has been difficult for allied assets to plug in to a US carrier battlegroup because SIPRNet was a no-foreign-nationals network; even when this ceased to be the case, foreign access remained tightly controlled. Classification boundaries will also need to be surmounted within the joint force if data from sources such as the F-35 is to be leveraged. Alongside the challenge of processing data, a GBAD system will need to move and receive data across heterogeneous networks, where the available bearer is dependent on the line of effort that it is supporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final challenge that will need to be overcome is the likelihood of capability growth that cannot be perfectly anticipated. For example, the army might invest in an upper-tier defensive system if the task of BMD becomes too much of a drain on RN resources, or it might incorporate directed-energy weapons into its SHORAD architecture. Critically, if SHORAD solutions against C-UAS become highly effective, the demand for UAS to be fitted with IFF will increase, thus expanding the need for C2 over these capabilities. A C2 system’s effectiveness will be determined by its capacity for iterative adaptation such that it can incorporate new sensors, effectors and processes. One of the great successes of the Aegis system, for example, is that its design process presumed that the system would prioritise the capacity for iterative change as new baselines were introduced, even if this meant setting initially conservative goals in capability terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these three challenges, the following design principles for army C2 for air defence assets can be derived:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the system must be capable of translating data across formats at pace. The heterogeneity of the systems operated by allies and coalition partners with which the air defence network must integrate, as well as the need to draw data from a range of sources within the joint force, makes this a sine qua non. In coalition contexts, the heterogeneity of systems will be even more significant, as potential partners such as the UAE operate the Korean L-SAM and the Russian Pantsir. It is also important to emphasise the importance of being able to fuse the feeds from sources that are incidentally related to air defence with organic sensors and effectors. For example, if the effector that is most likely to intercept a target is an organic one, but the rough track data is being provided by a joint asset, while precise track data is being enabled by lining up sensors along the vector of threat, then data from several sources needs to be fused to provide a target solution to the effector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since coordination in capability development across the joint force and allies is unlikely, it follows that the system must depend on backwards integration. This necessitates an architecture that can be regularly updated with middleware to provide additional translation layers as required. As an example, we might think of how software such as BMD Flex was designed to connect Aegis and non-Aegis systems afloat. Another example could be the recent tests by the US Army at its White Sands Range, which connected Patriot with both F-35s and a range of bespoke systems from beyond the army. The hardware requirements that this approach introduces in areas such as processing power will create requirements for thermal and electromagnetic shielding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the data processing architecture of the system must be able to receive data without access to the commercially and militarily sensitive underlying source codes that underpin a given system and its architecture. Without this ability, it will be largely impossible to receive data across coalitions, given likely sensitivities about data exposure, and this may even create impediments within an Alliance context. To the extent that partners can share messages without foundational knowledge, this will be easier. This logic underpins publish/subscribe models in the commercial world, where an enterprise integration bus facilitates the translation of data across formats and acts as a messaging broker. Such systems rely on each publisher placing its raw data (messages) within a shared environment from which they can be translated and pushed on to hosted subscriber platforms. This model requires minimal compatibility in terms of data structuring, and is generally flexible in terms of the specific language types that can be incorporated. Because messaging is brokered through a central data environment, it does not require subscribers or publishers to receive data from one another directly – simplifying the systems engineering challenge that emerges from the addition of new system nodes (sometimes referred to as the N-squared challenge) because platforms do not need to “talk” directly to each other. The use of a central data environment also means that specific coalition partners do not share information directly (an issue that can sometimes prove politically challenging). Examples where this kind of integration already exists include the US military’s universal C2 interface. Any system will also need mechanisms for moving data across classifications within the joint force (for example, the US tests linking F-35s to Patriot were facilitated by an Einstein box on a U-2 Dragon Lady aircraft).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network architecture for air defence must be a heterogeneous one, since the fusion of sensor data and the distribution of a common air picture to units not habitually part of the air defence structure will have to rely on the bearers they already possess, rather than on bespoke bearers. Even for those systems that have habitual but not integral relationships with one another, the fact that a defensive system’s deployment will partly be determined by the forces it is supporting means that the operators of these systems cannot control precisely what bearers may be available at a given time to route information to the air defence headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several solutions are possible. The most obvious would be a software-defined system that can incorporate multiple waveform cards at a central node. However, other palliatives might be more appropriate. Data can be routed to a common node via third-party platforms that receive and retransmit waveforms. This will be especially important when the sensitivity of a network such as MADL (Multifunction Advanced Data Link) means that not every system can have a receiving terminal. Software-defined signal processing might be another way of allowing a system to receive data across multiple waveforms without a requirement for an unmanageable number of waveform cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latency requirements present another challenge: when a habitual connection is taken under command by either the air commander or the headquarters of a formation-level air defence, that connection must take priority on the bearer of opportunity it adopts. The disruption this could cause makes it important that the air defence command exercises restraint and maturity over when it asserts this need for priority, otherwise commanders will likely seek to shield their comms from being available to the air defence headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;organisational-requirements-for-the-command-team&quot;&gt;Organisational Requirements for the Command Team&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, this paper has focused on the system being commanded and how its multiple components must be able to interact. The future threat environment, however, also imposes constraints on the size, disposition and structure of the command team that must operate the GBAD C2 system, and it is important to capture these requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there are a series of vital nodes that the GBAD enterprise must be able to liaise with and draw data from. This is most realistically achieved through established data links, but also through liaison cells with terminals that can replicate the air defence command’s displays and from which data can also be inputted. The relevant points of presence across the force are likely to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Joint Effects cell in the divisional headquarters responsible for planning and controlling divisional fires. In some instances, destroying enemy strike systems on the ground may be a better means of sanitising airspace, and so the air defence organisation may cooperate on triangulating the location of threat systems. There is also the need to be notified of UAS orbits and EW plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) headquarters, and its J5 and J3 fires elements, to ensure that the air defence laydown protects points critical to the corps, and to avoid fratricide, in terms of both air defence engagements and route planning. It is notable, for example, that the defensive plan for 1 German Corps in 1988 Federal Republic of Germany war plans saw the corps logistics area accidentally co-located with the Luftwaffe’s hawk batteries, due to a failure to compare the schemes of manoeuvre between these respective formations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The CAOC where the ATO is generated must be a priority liaison, both to ensure that blue forces are accurately tracked and to benefit from the vast ISR capacity within the air operations enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The commander of the Maritime Component Command, both to benefit from maritime ISR, and because the UK’s BMD capability both for forces at the edge and targets at depth will be, for now at least, at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1 Aviation Brigade, as an organisation that will be generating sorties in support of land forces and controlling air-launched effects, must also be closely tied into the enterprise. Defence of aviation assets on the ground also creates a key responsibility for GBAD units.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Representation in the G5 and G3 shops of the divisional headquarters is critical, so that the distribution and laydown of air defence assets can be planned and deconflicted, and be complementary to the divisional scheme of manoeuvre. It also allows the enterprise to plan the resupply and sustainment of air defence units.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Allied formations and air defence units also require liaison personnel to share a common understanding of the environment and to deconflict or coordinate engagement where effector or sensor coverage overlaps. In NATO this can be formalised, but in the Middle East or other operating environments liaison may have to be ad hoc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There is also a range of sensors built into civilian infrastructure (and operated by civilian agencies) in a number of states where the UK might operate, which could provide critical situational awareness and which would require liaison.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK’s GBAD C2 structures have, historically, met the following obligations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The capacity to provide a corps-level command element subordinate to HQ ARRC air branch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A divisional air defence command formed around one of the air defence regiments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A brigade-level air defence cell.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Liaison with national air defence C2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the C2 of army GBAD is to expand its span of control to provide a wrap for joint and allied capabilities, there is an inherent challenge: the regular force, as it currently exists (12th and 16th Regiments of the Royal Artillery within 7 Air Defence Group) is too small to staff all the liaison functions outlined above. Moreover, air defence officers in the British military are largely generalists, on account of the career structure within the Royal Artillery, whereas the expertise needed to understand partner C2 systems sufficiently to function as an effective liaison requires extensive specialist knowledge and experience. A critical requirement for robust C2 of future GBAD, therefore, is a career structure that can produce staff with the relevant experience and expertise. The expanded responsibility of UK air defence is not simply an army aspiration, or gold plating, but a UK obligation under the country’s commitment to NATO, which includes the ARRC as a Reserve Corps headquarters. As the army is also seeking to field two divisions, the planning assumption for the staffing of 7 Air Defence Group – that it contributes to the fielding of one warfighting division – is no longer valid. The interface of GBAD with the corps echelon is also reinforced by the growing emphasis on corps operations among allies, as a result of US Multi-Domain Operations and the aspiration to leverage data from F-35 and other capabilities, which is difficult to achieve at the divisional level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, an alternative command structure might include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The technical basis for a corps-level command element, along with a skeleton staff that can be augmented by partners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A divisional-level command formed around a regiment, and brigade-level cells below it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aforementioned liaison network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways in which the headcount required to deliver these capabilities can be minimised. Firstly, automation (while not a panacea) can reduce specific burdens and extend an operator’s span of control. A formation of destroyers, for example, has six officers on watch in each destroyer, with the anti-air warfare officer supervising a team of as few as two to three personnel. This formation is expected to perform theatre air and missile defence over areas sometimes spanning hundreds of kilometres. Although this is partly a function of overall command being held elsewhere, it also reflects the fact that most modern destroyers are capable of operating on a partially or fully automated basis, meaning they can independently conduct an air defence battle over an area comparable to a corps’ – or even a field army’s – area of responsibility. While the power and processing requirements involved have historically made this more applicable to the maritime domain, where large ships could support this model, the continued miniaturisation of microprocessors is making significantly greater computational capacity deployable in distributed ISO containers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, liaison officers to allied air defence formations and other allied formations, or to air and maritime component commands, can, if the role is professionalised, act as a force multiplier for joint planning (an analogy might be drawn with the way tactical air controllers are trained within the army). Having such individuals in post would represent an important bridge across organisations and, moreover, cycling officers through liaison roles could provide the organisational capital needed to create a skeleton air defence cell into which allied officers and liaisons from across the joint force could be plugged, if needed. A more ambitious approach to personnel interoperability might see officers from the navy and air force sit alongside army officers for training as part of a joint air defence course (as Joint Terminal Attack Controllers from the British Army and RAF do), so that they can be moved afloat or ashore as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complicating factor for C2 activities is that, historically, these activities would have occurred at fixed locations where the air defence headquarters could have a presence. However, owing to the threat from long-range precision fires, many of the constituent parts of the C2 system are themselves being dispersed in smaller packets. This places a premium on data transfer and compatibility between these formations’ C2 tools and the air defence system. There is also a trade-off to be made: although officers in distributed C2 nodes can gain access to the wider data sets from other similarly distributed nodes, they are unable to physically meet with other elements. The ability to ingest and dispense data becomes critical, therefore, to their utility to both the air defence command and the headquarters to which they are attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adversaries’ expanding capacity to reach into tactical and operational depth means that air defence is now a critical enabler for ground forces, even after the establishment of air superiority. Moreover, given the number and diversity of low-cost air threats, and the competing dilemmas imposed by more capable threat systems, C2 has become the means by which an air defence system can gain the required efficiency to protect the force. This efficiency is derived from assigning appropriate effectors to the different kinds of threat being confronted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve the requisite efficiency, the C2 architecture for British GBAD must be able to distribute track-quality data to a diverse array of organic/inorganic systems and joint/combined assets. Given the increasing number of low-altitude threat systems, this track-quality data will often need to be based upon a composite track derived from numerous bespoke and contingent sensors. The collection and distribution of this data must, moreover, be bearer agnostic, reflecting the fact that partners may use an array of communications systems, and that the best-placed sensors might be embedded in units that are not organically subordinated to the air defence formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further consideration is that both effectors and sensors are likely to adapt rapidly over the course of a conflict in anticipation of and response to an evolving threat. Expenditure of munitions will also invariably drive the use of increasingly irregular interceptors as a conflict protracts. The C2 architecture must therefore be adaptable, so as to be capable of interacting with new systems via software updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C2 architecture itself must be distributed, both to bolster its own survivability and because it must have liaison outposts in disparate formations. Moreover, as the number of friendly UAS and effectors in the operating environment expands (many lacking synchronisation through the CAOC), the ability to access friendly planning cycles to aid with the classification of air targets is vital if the air defence system is not to engage in widespread friendly fire. Another major consideration is the mobility, signature and power requirements of the C2 system, since it risks being targeted if it has a distinct signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has not covered C-UAS capabilities in detail, focusing instead on loitering munitions and one-way attack UAS, as these target air defences or the sites they defend. The layers of tactical UAS that are likely to become organic to all echelons, however, have not been discussed, because defence against these systems is a localised all-arms requirement, rather than something to be managed centrally. Nevertheless, one of the key ancillary questions is how the air defence network can make opportunistic use of the sensors and effectors distributed throughout the force to provide all-arms C-UAS without saturating tactical networks or hijacking a critical enabler of manoeuvre elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Land GBAD programme gives the British Army an opportunity to future-proof air defence across the joint and combined force, with £1.6 billion committed to the project. But realising the programme’s goals will depend on having an open-architecture C2 capability that can integrate the increasing numbers and types of sensors that are proliferating across the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（17日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第62日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他指2019年11月區選之前，李宇軒籌劃邀請外國議員來港監察選舉，並透過他向黎智英的私人助手 Mark Simon 尋求金錢贊助，Mark Simon 得悉監選團主意之後表示「我哋會大力支持」，最終贊助了李50萬元。陳與 Mark Simon 在區選之後第二次親身見面，期間 Mark 指李宇軒每次都是在最後一刻才找他求助，形容「唔係好識做人」，所以希望陳能繼續「喺中間協調佢哋兩個」。陳又指，黎智英和 Mark Simon 將一間離岸公司 LACOCK 的銀行戶口轉讓給他，作為「報酬」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第四天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英不同意年青人組新政黨-因會令社運變質&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英不同意年青人組新政黨 因會令社運變質&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華昨日供稱在2019年11月27日，他與黎智英第三次會面，當時黎提及區選民主派大勝、會見張崑陽，以及眾籌能夠突破傳統框架。陳今早再補充，黎在該次會面中還有提及「佢支持本土嘅力量」，也提及「當時有一個聲音話想另起爐灶，組織新嘅政黨」，惟黎表示不同意，「佢話歷史上嘅經驗係，如果當啲年青人去自己再組織政黨嘅話，就會令到個社會運動變質。」陳指黎認為年青人應該以泛民的思想為中心去爭取民主。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳昨日引述黎講過應該結合街頭、議會和國際力量，延續反修例運動的熱情，迫使政府回應市長訴求。控方追問黎有否提及如何結合三方的力量。陳指黎想建立一個「領袖團隊」，而當中的領袖便是來自上述三個板塊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒籌備監選團需額外25萬-暗示陳向mark-simon尋求資助&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒籌備監選團需額外25萬 「暗示」陳向Mark Simon尋求資助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2019年11月24日的區議會選舉，陳梓華供稱，另一名被告李宇軒事前透過 Telegram Call 告訴他，正計劃籌備一個監察區議會選舉行動（Election Observation Mission，簡稱EOM），「然後佢話佢唔夠錢搞，當時我問佢爭幾多錢，佢話25萬，然後佢問我可唔可以幫手。」陳表示，雖然當時李並沒有明確說出要求，但是「我理解佢暗示我，叫我搵 Mark Simon 或者黎智英」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指他其後聯絡 Mark Simon，轉述李宇軒想籌備監選行動，「Mark Simon 好有興趣，想我講個內容做啲乜嘢、幾時做、點樣做，同埋點解要25萬。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳遂再次致電李宇軒，首先問他：「點解你哋唔直接聯絡？你哋已經見過面，亦都交換咗聯絡方式」，惟李僅回應：「你去講好啲」，然後談及監選行動的目的。陳引述李指，本身只是一名外國議員想前來香港監察選舉，「但係後來佢哋團隊討論過，應該係攬炒團隊，佢哋決定咗將佢發大嚟搞」，所以他們開始邀請不同外國議員，會有英國、日本和澳洲，另外會嘗試邀請美國，故此需要額外25萬元經費，用以支付機票和酒店費用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon大力支持-最終贊助李宇軒50萬元籌辦監選團&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon「大力支持」 最終贊助李宇軒50萬元籌辦監選團&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他將李宇軒製作的來港議員名單轉發給 Mark Simon，不久後 Mark Simon 致電陳，問：「Even Lord Alton is coming?」陳向李查問後，向 Mark Simon 確認 Lord Alton 會來港，於是 Mark Simon 答應幫助，並稱：「我哋會大力支持。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;後來陳從李口中得悉 Mark Simon 給了50萬元，即是雙倍贊助。陳憶述他當時向李打趣道：「佢（Mark Simon）都冇咁樣畀過50萬我」、「你好犀利。」然後李說：「呢樣都唔犀利」，陳指：「佢（李宇軒）話另一個人仲 resourceful，就係 Wilson Li（李宗澤），佢話佢可以 arrange 到嗰啲酒店，畀佢搞到呢場EOM。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華mark-simon指李宇軒唔係好識做人-冀陳能繼續居中協調&quot;&gt;陳梓華：Mark Simon指李宇軒「唔係好識做人」 冀陳能繼續居中協調&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華供稱，區選之後，他於2019年12月頭在沙田君悅酒店與 Mark Simon 見面，為二人第二次親身見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述 Mark Simon 在會面中提及區選監選團：「佢認為做得好好，呢啲就係佢哋想要嘅嘢」，而「佢哋」是指黎智英和 Mark Simon。陳指 Mark Simon 繼而說：「其實呢，好多民主人士會去聯絡佢，或者佢個老細，去尋求金錢上嘅幫助。咁但係呢，我老細好有錢，唔代表佢任何人都要贊助。細額嘅款項佢都可以決定，但係大額呢，就需要佢個老闆決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指：「跟住佢（Mark Simon）就話，李宇軒呢，每次都係最後一刻先搵人或者佢幫手，就話佢唔係好識做人，咁所以希望我可以繼續喺中間協調佢哋兩個。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指 Mark Simon 亦談論他與李的未來方向，「如果未來做文宣嘅話呢，咁應該呢就放棄登報紙喇。應該要做嘅，係喺網上嘅平台宣傳啦，同埋國際游說嘅工作，佢（Mark）認為更有成效。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問為何 Mark Simon 認為要放棄登報紙，陳引述 Mark 當時指：「唔係個個都會讀報紙，而且其實已經好多人關注香港嘅事，唔需要靠登報紙嚟引起關注，反而係啲（外國）官員呀，同埋政府，會更加想知道香港嘅情況係點樣，所以先更加需要國際游說。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又追問國際游說想達到什麼目的。陳指希望國際社會採取措施，去迫使政府回應市民訴求，包括撤回修例和落實雙普選。惟 Mark 並未有提及想外國採取什麼「措施」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英和mark-simon區選後研究初選-冀立法會選舉再次大勝&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英和Mark Simon區選後研究初選 冀立法會選舉再次大勝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另引述 Mark Simon 覺得「黃絲勝選係大勢所趨嘅」，亦聲稱「佢同佢老細都開始研究緊初選，就希望延續呢股氣勢」，能夠在2020年的立法會選舉再次取得大勝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初選47人案的主審法官之一李運騰此時打斷，指該次對話是在2019年12月發生，問陳是否早於當時便已經有人談論初選。陳回答，後來2020年1月的時候，他與黎智英在台灣見面，期間黎有提及初選，甚至已經向一間歐洲公司索取報價，研發一個初選公投程式，而黎聲稱他們其實在2019年11至12月已經講過初選的主意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英和mark-simon轉讓離岸公司銀行戶口給他作為報酬&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英和Mark Simon轉讓離岸公司銀行戶口給他作為「報酬」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱，在第一次與 Mark Simon 見面時，Mark 表示可以幫助他開設離岸公司的銀行戶口，「你就當係個獎勵畀自己。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指第二次見面時，Mark Simon 發現原來在香港很難開設離岸公司的銀行戶口，所以無法幫助陳，「但係佢（Mark）有問過，佢就話佢哋手頭上有兩間空置嘅⋯⋯佢話可以畀其中一間我。」陳並確認這當作是黎智英和 Mark Simon 給他的「報酬（reward）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指 Mark Simon 介紹了一名叫 Evan Lau 的助手，去跟進海外公司轉讓事宜，涉及一間在英屬維爾京群島註冊的公司 LACOCK 及一個本地銀行戶口。陳稱他於2020年1月到壹傳媒大樓簽署文件，期間他留意到文件上有一個簽名，查問下得悉該簽名屬於黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示 LACOCK 的匯豐銀行本地戶口，顯示直至2019年11月30日，戶口存款為8萬元，至2020年2月7日，銀行扣除辦理轉讓的200元手續費之後，存款最終為79,800元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，根據控辯雙方承認事實，在2018年4月26日至2020年1月13日之間，黎智英、Mark Simon 和前壹傳媒財務總裁周達權是 LACOCK 銀行戶口的授權簽署人。由2020年1月14日開始，該銀行戶口唯一授權簽署人轉為陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及陳有否和 Mark Simon 討論如何處理8萬元存款。陳指 Mark Simon 當時以為戶口只有5萬元，並要求陳以現金方式把該8萬元還給他，惟直至陳被捕之前也未還款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon提議使用戶口做國際文宣活動或與海外單位聯絡&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon提議使用戶口做國際文宣活動、或與海外單位聯絡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，他當時只是打算使用 LACOCK 戶口來做生意，不過 Mark Simon 建議「其實都可以用嚟做之前嘅社會運動，或者一啲國際嘅文宣活動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又引述 Mark 指：「因為間公司係匿名，所以如果喺海外同唔同嘅單位聯絡嘅時候，或者可以用到呢間公司。」Mark 亦提及可以使用這間公司來做支援，例如在海外接洽時，需要轉帳金錢，「咁如果你唔想用自己名，咁就可以用間公司做。」不過陳向 Mark Simon 說，他無意如此使用該戶口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（17日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第62日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他指黎智英有見「攬炒團隊發展得好好」，希望與「攬炒巴」劉祖廸見面，了解其想法。陳遂在2019年12月抵英會見劉，替黎轉話，並且應黎的建議會見「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）。回到香港之後，陳與黎再次見面，陳引述黎當時稱：「佢唔係唔支持勇武，只係佢需要去迎合西方，去獲得國際支持，所以佢需要有咁樣嘅姿態，佢認為無可否認地，國際嘅支持比起勇武派嘅支持更加重要。」陳亦形容當時國際線「好亂」，有不同聲音，惟黎不同意年青人搶奪話語權，「佢認為應該用返老泛民嘅嗰種思想作為思想，同埋佢想團結國際線同埋攬炒派。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第四天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華李宇軒準備赴美見政要-尋求mark-simon協助&quot;&gt;陳梓華：李宇軒準備赴美見政要 尋求Mark Simon協助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華供稱，李宇軒告訴他準備赴美國會見政要，但是李當時有憂慮，「佢擔心佢自己一個飛過去，最後一個人都見唔到」，而且李想見多一次美國議員 Rick Scott，所以問陳能否幫忙，「佢想我問吓 Mark Simon 嗰邊可唔可以幫到佢手」。陳又指，他和李均知道，香港民主委員會成員朱牧民與黎智英和 Mark Simon 的關係特別好，故此陳答應幫李問 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳向 Mark Simon 轉達李需要協助，對方問李想在這次旅程達到什麼目標，還有什麼特別事需要幫手。陳引述李說，「佢想去見吓啲官員，去同佢哋講吓香港嘅情況，想做國際游說，同埋考慮將一個制裁名單，睇吓可唔可以交畀美國嘅官員，當時佢話因為唔想兩手空空咁去。」陳把李的說話轉告給 Mark Simon，「然後 Mark Simon 話，放心，佢會 arrange，要我同李宇軒講，唔會一個人都見唔到，同埋叫我鼓勵吓佢。」Mark 又指李至少會見到 Rick Scott。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當時李並沒有傳送制裁名單給他看，而他在 Telegram 群組見過很多版本的制裁名單，後來旅程結束之後，他從李口中得悉，李用了「重光團隊」製作的「Profiles of Perpetrators of Human Rights and Democracy Abuse in Hong Kong（打壓香港人權和民主人士之檔案）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，他與 Mark Simon 通電之後，便向李轉達 Mark Simon 的說話，「放心，Mark Simon 話你唔會一個人都見唔到，同埋放心去 network 吓，加油。」因為建立人際網絡可以方便他將來做游說工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱李宇軒決定打國際線-持續分享其工作-陳將之轉告mark-simon&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱李宇軒決定「打國際線」 持續分享其工作 陳將之轉告Mark Simon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提到，李向他傳送了旅程照片，又告訴他已經將制裁名單交給美國議員。法官李運騰問，似乎李持續向陳匯報自己做過什麼。陳回應：「當時佢的而且確同我分享佢做過乜嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官接著問，李是純粹作為朋友向陳分享，還是李期望陳將他做過的事轉告給其他人。陳表示據他記憶，李當時決定「打國際線」，並會就不同事務與「攬炒巴」劉祖廸聯繫，「比較緊密」，陳說：「而我呢，就唔知道亦都冇參與佢哋國際線嘅游說，所以當時佢想話畀我聽，佢做過啲乜嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就李宇軒決定「打國際線」，陳稱他有把李的說話及做過的事告訴 Mark Simon，包括有一次李去日本，「佢（李）話佢自己展示咗啲催淚彈嘅彈頭。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英想會見攬炒巴了解想法-遂赴英國替黎轉話&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英想會見「攬炒巴」了解想法 遂赴英國替黎轉話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他與黎智英於2019年11月在其座駕見面之後，黎曾經電話聯絡過他，「佢（黎）留意到，攬炒團隊發展得好好」，而黎知道陳聯絡不到勇武派領袖，「佢（黎）話我大概應該可以聯絡到喺國際線上面、文宣線上面比較出名嘅『攬炒巴』」，所以陳便嘗試聯絡「攬炒巴」劉祖廸。至於黎想見「攬炒巴」的原因，陳指黎「想見一見佢，了解一吓佢嘅諗法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，他於2019年12月赴英國與「攬炒巴」劉祖廸見面。陳將黎的想法告訴劉，包括「應該結合鐵三角嘅力量，同埋組成一個領袖團隊嘅諗法」，惟陳形容「劉祖廸有猶豫嘅」，「佢對於黎智英認為應該以和理非嘅手段作為抗爭主旨，有保留。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ Finn Lau 劉祖廸（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，當時他向劉說：「我認為你兩個可以直接對話，反正個會面唔會有人知道，而且所有嘅費用都會由黎智英負責，最後佢（劉）同意（會見黎智英）。」陳其後解釋「費用」是包括前往台北的機票和住宿費用，因為後來會面是在台北進行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英穿針引線下會見羅傑斯-對方提議將反修例問題放上國際法庭處理&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英穿針引線下會見羅傑斯 對方提議將反修例問題放上國際法庭處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示黎智英與陳梓華之間的對話，在2019年12月20日，陳表示想盡用在英國的時間，問黎有沒有建議可以會見什麼人；黎則建議陳會見「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）和英國議員 Lord Alton，並稱可以幫陳安排。陳認為「佢（黎）想我識多啲人，方便我將來參加國際游說嘅工作」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳最後在英國與羅傑斯見面，對方問起香港的情況，二人亦討論「會唔會有一啲途徑解決到香港人嘅矛盾、香港人同政府嘅矛盾」，對方提議：「可唔可以將個社會問題，例如反修例運動，放上去國際嘅法庭去解決，佢話佢相信最尾香港嘅問題都係要通過對話解決。」此外，羅傑斯亦有問陳能否講得出具體的事可以「要求外國人幫手」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當羅傑斯問他接下來的行程、會見什麼人時，自己回答將會見劉祖廸，「當時我用『攬炒』呢個字，而佢（羅傑斯）聽得明呢個字」，並稱認識及見過劉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提到，該次英國之旅的費用原本由他自行支付，但後來黎就英國和台北之行，一併過歸還相關款項給陳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英否認不支持勇武-惟認為國際支持比勇武派支持更加重要&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英否認不支持勇武 惟認為國際支持比勇武派支持更加重要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，他從英國回到香港之後，在2019年12月31日與黎智英再度會面，當時同樣在一架停泊在金鐘的座駕上單獨會面。陳將他會見劉祖廸的情況和對話告知黎，「基本上我就係話，黎智英對於勇武派嘅取態，似乎唔適合佢哋兩個見面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述黎當時回應：「佢希望我明白，佢唔係唔支持勇武，只係佢需要去迎合西方，去獲得國際支持，所以佢需要有咁樣嘅姿態。佢認為無可否認地，國際嘅支持比起勇武派嘅支持更加重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英想主導國際線不同意年青人搶奪話語權&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英想主導國際線、不同意年青人搶奪話語權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當控方追問「國際支持」是代表什麼，陳提到「當時呢國際線上係好亂嘅，有唔同嘅聲音」，有人提倡港獨，同時有人只想捍衛一國兩制，亦有人一直提倡制裁或封鎖香港，「佢（黎）認為年青人喺度搶緊個話語權」，即是年青人希望自己的聲音成為主流。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，黎智英不同意年青人搶奪話語權，「佢認為應該用返老泛民嘅嗰種思想作為思想，同埋佢想團結國際線同埋攬炒派。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到黎智英為何認為應該採用泛民思想。陳指黎只是提及過西方不想見到什麼場面，但是沒有講到為何西方想見到香港採用泛民思想，然而「簡單啲嚟講，佢就係想主導成條國際線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英於2019年11月已經談論民主派初選-稱本土派參與能增加認受性&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英於2019年11月已經談論民主派初選 稱本土派參與能增加認受性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，黎希望他將上述說話內容，以及「初選嗰啲嘢話畀年青人知」。他指黎認為年青人應該多專注在選舉工作，「咁樣啲民氣先會集結到呀，同埋佢講話初選有啲好處。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，黎認為舉辦初選「可以集中到嗰啲黃絲嘅票源」，亦認為初選能夠吸納到參與過反修例運動的年輕人票源，提高投票率。黎曾指，如果素人參與初選的話，他們的票都可以「流返落老泛民度」，因為若果素人在初選中落敗，到正式立法會選舉的時候，其他勝出初選的候選人便可以得到這些素人的票源，「咁最尾泛民喺立法會嘅議席就可以鞏固到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;初選案主審法官之一的李運騰問，陳的意思是否代表在2019年12月的時候，香港社會上已經開始討論初選。惟陳稱還未有相關討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問，當陳在2019年12月31日跟黎見面，而黎談及初選時，陳是否知道黎在談論什麼。陳則表示他當時知道，其實早於2019年11月，他與黎在車上會面的時候，「佢（黎）話佢會支持本土派，如果啲素人參加初選，先會有認受性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問，換言之陳是在2019年11月，從黎的口中首次聽到關於初選的事情。陳確認，並稱當時他理解「初選」是代表在泛民參選之前，他們會舉行初選。陳稱，他其後有在一些文宣和「公海」Telegram 群組中，向年青人轉達黎的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱有向李宇軒轉述黎智英說話-惟李對初選沒有興趣&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱有向李宇軒轉述黎智英說話 惟李對初選沒有興趣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華稱，他在大約2020年1月初的時候，跟李宇軒轉述黎智英的說話，包括「佢（黎）會去見攬炒（劉祖廸）」及「喺國際線上面，黎智英唔想我哋咁搶咪⋯⋯啫係攞咗個話語權。」陳亦有向李轉述：「我哋喺國際線上面都係講番五大訴求」，然後談及黎對於初選的想法。李當時則回應「有排，啫係有一段長時間先到選舉」，所以理解他沒有興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳有否向黎智英提及李宇軒，陳則稱「好少，但係有」，例如他向黎談及眾籌，「我話統籌嗰個係佢（李），唔係我。」後來黎問起，李曾會見前政務司司長陳方安生和民主黨元老李柱銘，「佢（黎）問我，李宇軒其實係咪港獨派。我話我相信唔係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，有一次他與黎講起聯合國，「佢（黎）問我點解唔去，因為當時明明其實應該我去（聯合國）講嘅，點解讓畀人哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱2020年1月到台灣陽明山別墅參與黎智英的飯局-同場有施明德&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱2020年1月到台灣陽明山別墅參與黎智英的飯局 同場有施明德&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，2020年1月10至12日，他到台灣打算觀摩總統大選，並在1月11日下午到達黎智英在陽明山的別墅參與一個飯局，同場有陳本人、黎智英、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸、一名姓林的女示威者、李永達夫婦、何俊仁夫婦和已故台灣民運人士施明德及其妻子。由於時間不足，陳同日晚上留在黎在台的住所觀看電視報導選舉結果，而未有外出觀選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;事前陳有告訴李，他將會去台灣觀摩大選，亦會去見黎智英，屆時他們可以做線上會議。陳又跟李說，他沒有特別問黎可不可以帶李宇軒一同出席飯局，不過李「覺得冇乜所謂，你哋兩個（陳梓華和劉祖廸）知道咪得囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，在抵台的第三天，即1月12日，他連同劉祖廸和林姓示威者一起與施明德見面，然後晚上回到酒店，與劉祖廸和李宇軒進行線上會議，而正是在該次會議中，李和劉均決定「打國際線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件周五（4月19日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（16日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第61日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，2019年9月底，他向李宇軒轉達黎智英私人助理 Mark Simon 的邀請，希望他能一同會見訪港的美國議員 Rick Scott。陳並開設 WhatsApp 群組串連李宇軒和 Mark Simon 等人，商討會面安排。陳另私下以訊息向李轉達 Mark Simon 的提醒，籲李勿在美議員面前提起「攬炒團隊」或「港獨」，因為「攬炒團隊」形象激進，加上「有啲人會將香港獨立同攬炒個概念擺埋一齊」，而「冇任何政客會企出嚟幫港獨背書嘅，所以為免大家傾得唔愉快，所以就唔好提 JD team（攬炒團隊），或者唔好提嗰個 idea」。會面之後，陳指 Mark Simon 認為他和李宇軒「應該識多啲人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第三天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon提及民間游說工作邀海外官員來港觀察&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon提及民間游說工作、邀海外官員來港觀察&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華昨日提到，在2019年8至9月的時候，黎智英的私人助手 Mark Simon 提議租用美國國會山莊的商務辦公室，舉辦關於香港的展覽和設游說中心。陳今補充，Mark Simon 當時說過：「點解當時 Jimmy 可以見到咁多官員，主要係因為畀錢嗰啲顧問公司。然後佢亦都提過可以做一啲民間游說嘅工作。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問 Mark 兩者有什麼分別，Mark 則指：「如果你唔係以一個議員嘅身份，咁你就基本上係一個平民嘅身份同啲官員接觸呀，咁你可以講吓香港嘅情況，亦都可以邀請一啲海外嘅官員嚟香港睇一睇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon-提議找李宇軒一同會見美議員&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon 提議找李宇軒一同會見美議員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就 Mark Simon 與另一名被告李宇軒於2019年9月底第一次見面，陳憶述事前 Mark Simon 告訴他將要會見美國議員斯科特（Rick Scott），並邀請他一同前來。「因為當時有啲突兀，我完全唔知 Rick Scott 係邊個」，在查問之下，Mark Simon 指斯科特是一名美國的議員，而他當時很想知道香港的狀況，所以 Mark Simon 想陳出席「講一講香港𠵱家嘅情況」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，當時他計劃去台灣旅遊，所以向 Mark Simon 稱「我唔得閒」；對方便問陳有否想到其他適合人選。不久後 Mark Simon 問陳：「咁不如 Andy（李宇軒）？」陳指：「因為佢（Mark Simon）知道 Andy，啫係李宇軒，有眾籌經驗啦，佢亦都知道李宇軒曾經去過聯合國。」Mark Simon 則認為「如果佢（李）去到都好好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，不過由於李並不屬於前線示威者，Mark Simon 建議最好找到其他曾經參與前線示威的年青人，故陳到其所屬的 Telegram 群組問，然後有一名叫「Cath」的人表示能夠出席會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指政府不聆聽訴求警方不成比例的暴力-使示威者轉而尋求國際支援&quot;&gt;陳梓華指政府不聆聽訴求、警方不成比例的暴力 使示威者轉而尋求國際支援&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問 Mark Simon 口中的「香港情況」所指為何。陳則說：「因為香港當時經歷過7.21、8.31呢啲事件呢，成個氣氛喺反修例運動係好激進」，雖然「五大訴求」不是不重要，但是已經不是首要的訴求。由於當時「警方不平等、唔成比例嘅暴力，同埋政府完全唔聽市民嘅訴求」，所以當時尋求一種「令大家可以（與政府）平等 bargain 到，啫係開始要向國際政府、同埋議員呀尋求支援」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又追問「前線」是指什麼。陳說：「當時有一個普遍認知，前線示威者會走到去前線戴頭盔呀、遮呀，去同警方對峙；咁同埋比較常見嘅係佢哋會戴護目鏡啦、豬咀啦，呢一種形象或者佢哋參與呢種活動，通常就係被視為前線。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於為何「Cath」被視為「前線」，陳指因為在 Telegram 群組中，「Cath」會跟其他人說「今日去邊度發夢」，而「發夢」即是參與示威。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華向李宇軒轉達mark-simon的邀請-其後就會見美議員開設whatsapp群組&quot;&gt;陳梓華向李宇軒轉達Mark Simon的邀請 其後就會見美議員開設WhatsApp群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就與 Rick Scott 的會面，陳供稱他向李宇軒轉達：「我同話 Mark Simon 有個機會同Rick Scott 有一個 meeting 咁樣」，之後提到「佢（Mark Simon）就想話有啲年青人去同 Rick Scott 講吓香港情況」，而且對方是一名美國參議員，「Mark Simon 講過話，『將來想方便游說嘅話，呢個係一個好好嘅機會，你想唔想去？』」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，因為想出席會面的人士自己商討安排，所以他開設了一個 WhatsApp 群組，然後把李宇軒加入去。控方在庭上展示群組資料，陳於2019年9月29日開設群組「Coffee on Sunday」，成員包括陳本人、李宇軒和 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華在群組中表示稍後會加入另一名成員「Cath」，並介紹「Cath」是「前線」人士，李宇軒則是做國際文宣的人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指激進未必一定是年輕人-例如老人家也會支持年輕政黨很多勇武也是年紀大&quot;&gt;陳梓華指激進未必一定是年輕人 例如老人家也會支持年輕政黨、很多勇武也是年紀大&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到李宇軒是否被視為一名「年青人」，陳起初表示「當時我冇諗過添」，但之後稱：「我諗係呀⋯⋯我諗無論係 Mark Simon 定係 Jimmy（黎智英）呢，佢哋將當時成個反修例運動一啲唔係傳統泛民嘅支持者，佢哋就會覺得佢哋係後生嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問及陳梓華的出生年份，陳回答1991年。法官李素蘭又問，陳是否比李宇軒年輕？陳回答：「係呀，我係91年，佢係90年，劉祖廸係92年。」陳又提到，黎智英和 Mark Simon 等人會覺得，「泛民其實一直就係比較溫和，而2019年反修例運動呢，就多咗好多勇武派啦。而呢種激進嘅思想，佢哋會覺得係年青人主導。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰則問陳是否同意這種歸類方式，因為激進的人未必一定是年輕人。陳表示：「正確，我一直都好反對呢啲標籤。有陣時我唔明點解前線嘅就係一定係前線，文宣就一定係文宣，而泛民就一定係老泛民。但係事實上我見到嘅係，都有唔少老人家都會支持好年輕嘅政黨，例如眾志，甚或乎有好多勇武都係年紀好大。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到：「有一次我同呀黎智英，喺佢屋企見面嘅時候，佢講過一句令我印象好深刻嘅說話：『黃藍是政見，但係黑白係良知。』」當時黎正在談論馬鞍山一名老人家被人點火燒傷的事件，陳引述黎稱：「『咁我哋應該點樣定義或標籤放火嘅人，同埋受傷嘅人呢？』」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒去完聯合國後隆重其事周圍宣傳-為其最大賣點&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒去完聯合國後隆重其事、周圍宣傳 為其「最大賣點」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳為何在群組中介紹李宇軒為做國際文宣的人。陳表示，因為就當時 Stand with Hong Kong（重光團隊，簡稱 SWHK）而言，「佢（李）最令人印象深刻嘅，就係佢喺國際層面上嘅推廣，佢哋搞咗好多啲海外嘅集會呀、billboard 呀，咁所以我就會話佢（李）就係一個國際文宣嘅人。」陳續提及：「尤其係當時李宇軒去咗聯合國啦，有隆重其事，周圍同人講，周圍宣傳，所以我有咁樣嘅印象。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華亦在 WhatsApp 群組中建議李宇軒談及聯合國的經驗。陳庭上解釋，李當時去了聯合國的一個峰會，他私下向陳提及，原本計劃推動一個可以在聯合國大會處理的議案，「佢當時 explore 緊聯合國有冇一個機制或措施可以做到多啲香港嘅嘢，咁但係最尾得個桔，佢話打幾個卡、影吓相，冇乜意思。」陳指，「因為呢個係佢（李）當時本人嘅最大賣點」，否則李只能夠說他做過眾籌，而不能夠講到一些比較特別的東西。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華引述mark-simon籲勿提及攬炒團隊或港獨&quot;&gt;陳梓華引述Mark Simon籲勿提及「攬炒團隊」或港獨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示陳梓華與李宇軒之間的 WhatsApp 對話，陳向李說：「Brother, Mark said do not mention about backer and JD team.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指訊息中的「backer」是指墊支的人，即黎智英和 Mark Simon 在全球登報文宣行動中墊支。而「JD team」則是「攬炒團隊」，陳指 Mark Simon 曾告訴他：「因為唔想提任何關於港獨嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰表示看不到「攬炒團隊」和「港獨」有任何關係，問陳梓華為何兩者有關係。陳回答：「因為 JD team 嘅取態係最激進嘅，思想上、國際層面上」，又提到「有啲人會將香港獨立同攬炒個概念擺埋一齊」。而陳認為：「啫係我諗一般都會明白，冇任何政客會企出嚟幫港獨背書嘅。所以為免大家傾得唔愉快，所以就唔好提 JD team，或者唔好提嗰個 idea。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦形容「攬炒團隊」在國際層面上是「思想上最激進」，「因為當時呢，攬炒團隊同埋攬炒巴（劉祖廸）係好出名嘅，佢（攬炒團隊）嘅形象就係激進」，雖然當時有其他零星組織提倡更加激進的思想，例如「香港建國」等，但是當時最標誌性的是「攬炒團隊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指-mark-simon-認為他和李宇軒應該識多啲人&quot;&gt;陳梓華指 Mark Simon 認為他和李宇軒「應該識多啲人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指李宇軒會見 Rick Scott 之後，曾向他表示：「原來呢個係 Mark Simon」，又指 Rick Scott「肯聽佢哋講囉」；不過陳沒有再問下去，而李之後亦沒有再詳述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於 Mark Simon，陳引述他指「Rick Scott 好 impressed」，不過談論眾籌沒有用處，反而透過會面建立人際網絡更好。陳續指，「簡單啲嚟講，其實當時佢（Mark Simon）覺得我本人、李宇軒，應該識多啲人。」除此之外，二人便沒有再談論或跟進該次會面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（16日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第61日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他提及2019年11月到黎智英的住宅出席飯局，席間黎大力批評馬鞍山火燒人事件，陳引述黎當時說：「佢覺得勇武派冇組織、冇分寸，然後愈嚟愈濫用暴力，如果搞出咗人命嘅話，咁整個運動就會失去道德高地去對抗香港政府，從而亦都會失去國際嘅支持。」黎亦希望勇武派影響力愈少，運動能愈健康，因為「可以迎合番西方嘅期望」，包括在整場運動中「唔可以有警察死亡，亦都唔可以有示威嘅民眾死亡，同埋唔可以有無止境嘅暴力」。陳又稱，黎希望在區選之後建立一個橫跨勇武及和理非的「領導團隊」，陳曾嘗試向自稱勇武派人士轉達黎的主意，惟遭對方質疑：「黎智英？我特朗普添呀！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第三天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱黎智英想領導勇武派-冀以泛民或和理非作為主要抗爭手段&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱黎智英想領導勇武派 冀以泛民或和理非作為主要抗爭手段&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳早前供稱他與黎智英於2019年7月首次親身見面。至同年10月，黎智英致電陳，向陳提供了一個電話號碼，並叫陳可以用這個電話 WhatsApp 聯絡他。在10月18日，陳向黎發送訊息：「你好，黎前輩」，黎回覆很高興認識陳，日後可保持聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月12日，黎向陳傳送訊息，指一名男子在馬鞍山被黑衣人點火，使他感到害怕（dreaded），他認為勇武派應該有人領導，並提議在翌日的會面中詳細討論。據陳所理解，黎訊息的意思是「佢就係想領導或主導勇武派」。陳重提與黎的第一次會面，黎當時亦有談及「應該以以泛民或和理非的手段，作為當時主要嘅抗爭手段」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何黎特地向陳提及馬鞍山火燒人事後，陳相信「我諗佢（黎）都知我自己都唔鍾意呢種做法」，另一個原因是黎認為他可以聯絡到勇武派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指2019年11月到黎智英住宅出席飯局-同場有林卓廷李永達和李卓人&quot;&gt;陳梓華指2019年11月到黎智英住宅出席飯局 同場有林卓廷、李永達和李卓人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳與黎的第二次親身會面，控方展示 WhatsApp 訊息，黎在會面前一日，即11月12日向陳交代司機接送的安排；陳問黎有否方法避開黎住所外的記者。陳庭上解釋，因為黎的私人助手 Mark Simon 曾提及過，「黎智英屋企出面係會有好多記者，基本上佢一舉一動都好可能會被報道。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KB0q2HG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黎智英（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他在11月13日如期到達黎的住宅出席飯局，同場還有民主黨的林卓廷和李永達，以及工黨的李卓人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英大力批評馬鞍山火燒人事件若搞出人命會使運動失道德高地&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英大力批評馬鞍山火燒人事件、若搞出人命會使運動失道德高地&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳講述會面經過，經一輪介紹之後，黎智英開始就當時的反修例運動發表意見，「其中佢大力咁去批評馬鞍山放火燒人嗰件事，佢問我識唔識嗰個人，我話唔識。」然後林卓廷、李永達和李卓人都有發言，不過皆是附和黎的說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述黎當時說：「佢覺得勇武派冇組織、冇分寸，然後愈嚟愈濫用暴力，如果搞出咗人命嘅話，咁整個運動就會失去道德高地去對抗香港政府，從而亦都會失去國際嘅支持。」之後黎說了一句：「黃藍係政見，黑白係良知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，黎說「有啲嘅底線，佢需要堅守嘅」，所以再一次要求陳去聯絡勇武派領袖，希望說服他們去對話、要克制，又重申應該以「和理非」作為主旨或抗爭手段。陳指，「今次就更加清晰喇，佢就想我將頭先講嘅呢一個訊息去傳遞畀其他年輕人。」陳當時回覆：「嘗試吓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英稱泛民有足夠本土資源和割𥱊地位去爭取政府回應訴求&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英稱泛民有足夠本土資源和割𥱊地位去爭取政府回應訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另引述黎：「佢話如果年青人做唔到嘅嘢，佢可以以傳媒嘅力量做到」，而且飯局上有三名泛民領袖，「佢（黎）認為泛民都擁有足夠嘅本土資源，同埋割𥱊地位，去爭取到政府嘅回應」，即是爭取政府落實雙普選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「傳媒力量」的意思，陳指黎並未有仔細講，「但就係話《蘋果日報》唔係要報道啲勇武，只要唔報道佢哋，佢哋嘅影響力已經會細咗好多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英想證明國際力量很重要美國沒有離棄香港&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英想證明國際力量很重要、美國沒有離棄香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月15日，黎傳送香港民主委員會（Hong Kong Democracy Council）的 Twitter 截圖給陳，當中提及《香港人權與民主法案》。黎又表示，美國議會即將表決，沒有理由不通過法案，形容這是一個非常棒的消息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，黎為何會傳送這些訊息給陳。陳稱他認為黎是「想證明國際嘅力量係好重要，同埋美國並沒有離棄或者係唔理香港發生緊咩事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訊息紀錄顯示黎智英向陳梓華查問中大黑衣人身份交流勇武派資訊&quot;&gt;訊息紀錄顯示黎智英向陳梓華查問中大黑衣人身份、交流勇武派資訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月16日，黎智英向陳轉發一則中大校友通訊，當中提及「各類車的司機已經是黑衣人，不是中大職員」、「校內情況惡劣，建築物被破壞，飯堂關門，住在宿舍的師生缺糧」等。黎問陳：「Wetland (Wayland)，你知道這些黑衣人到底是謝（誰）人嗎？謝謝。」陳回覆：「不同組別人士，由屠龍及 Black Boc 等隊伍為首，形成的一幫沒有紀律人士」、「他們希望霸佔中大作據點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上表示，在黎問他之前，他已經問過其他人了解中大情況，「因為個畫面好誇張」，網上討論區有人聲稱「啲嘢全部打爛晒，連嗰啲工程車都塗晒鴉」，所以他想知道是否真有其事。而陳經了解後，所得的資訊就是他回覆黎的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Yq5P46G.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;同年11月17日，陳向黎傳送訊息，叫黎特別留意數隊勇武小隊，包括「屠龍、中移動、閃燈、蜘蛛、V小隊、毒蛇、粉紅、Pink Team」，指他們帶領著不能接受的暴力升級，而《蘋果》曾訪問其中三隊，以及其中一隊的領袖「Max」，他正在理大衝突中領導防守。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳庭上解釋，由於黎一直希望聯絡到勇武小隊，但陳本人無法聯絡，而傳媒很早已經訪問過他們，因此叫黎留意訊息提及的幾隊勇武小隊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;黎智英和陳梓華討論警方團封理大是否陰謀-黎稱希望勇武精銳份子能逃脫&quot;&gt;黎智英和陳梓華討論警方團封理大是否陰謀 黎稱希望勇武精銳份子能逃脫&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年11月19日，黎與陳討論警方團封理大事件是否「警方的陰謀」、「這局面其實很易設計」、「理工在城市，警方封了路就無法逃脫」，又指警方「把我最精銳的人一網打盡，希望昨天逃出來的都是勇武精銳份子」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，當時大家一路都是透過網上資訊去了解理大的情況，「當時我覺得成件事好古怪，你點會走入去一個走唔到嘅地方做示威，咁我諗係咪一個陰謀」，然後黎發表他的個人意見，「但我又喺一啲 Telegram group 度睇到好犀利、令人印象深刻嘅評論，就講緊會唔會係一個『圍點打援』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rlUMrXC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英盡量迎合西方要求-包括不能有警察或示威者死亡暴力不能無止境&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英盡量迎合西方要求 包括不能有警察或示威者死亡、暴力不能無止境&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何黎如此關心勇武派，陳表示：「我認為佢（黎）當時希望勇武影響力愈小，就對整個運動愈健康」，「少咗好多暴力嘅畫面，同埋可以迎合番西方嘅期望？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又表示，他當時並未知道「迎合西方」這回事，「係去到後來，佢有話畀我知，究竟美國政府內部係點樣諗，我先明白，黎智英一直以嚟，並唔係純粹咁想去爭取國際嘅支持，而係佢已經知道某啲嘅需求，然後盡量去滿足呢啲要求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問黎想滿足什麼「要求」。陳指整個運動中，「唔可以有警察死亡，亦都唔可以有示威嘅民眾死亡，同埋唔可以有無止境嘅暴力。」陳指黎在2020年3至4月的訊息中談及美國內部消息，「人哋個立場，係覺得好多民間嘅訴求或者指控，對於個政府，未必有證據，大概係咁嘅意思。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英希望區選前勇武派暫停暴力抗爭-遂應黎要求籲勿生事&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英希望區選前勇武派暫停暴力抗爭 遂應黎要求籲勿生事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年11月20日，黎告知陳，美國參議院一致通過支持香港示威者的措施（Senate Unanimously Approves Measures Backing Hong Kong Protesters）；陳當時回覆已經得悉相關消息，希望該措施能向政府施壓。惟陳庭上表示不肯定該「措施」是指什麼，「我諗佢（黎）係想話畀我知美國做緊嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在2019年區選之前，陳向黎提及「聽說小樺被捕了」，又稱：「我已經呼籲大家24日前別生事。」陳庭上解釋，他當時是應黎的要求向其他人轉達黎的呼籲，「佢希望喺區議會選舉之前，尤其是當日，勇武派唔好暴力抗爭住。佢當時認為應該將焦點集中喺區議會選舉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英希望成立橫跨勇武和理非的領導團隊&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英希望成立橫跨勇武、和理非的「領導團隊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後黎向陳傳送訊息，表示有需要認真考慮成立一個領導團隊，應該在區選之後討論（“It’s time to seriously think about a leadership group. After the election we should talk.”），陳庭上表示以他理解，黎想建立一個「橫跨勇武、和理非」的「大台」，而黎希望陳能夠在這個領導團隊入面，並叫他尋找同路人一起商量。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;後來區議會選舉結果出爐，非建制派奪下近400席，黎向陳表示：「贏到咁，世估唔到！香港人民力量大翻身！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱嘗試向自稱勇武派轉達黎智英想建立大台-惟遭對方質疑身份&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱嘗試向自稱勇武派轉達黎智英想建立「大台」 惟遭對方質疑身份&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三次見面，陳供稱在2019年11月27日，黎智英相約他到金鐘法院道，其座駕停泊在一處，當時黎的私人司機離開車廂並收起陳的電話，然後二人單獨在座駕傾談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳憶述他首先重申「真係聯絡唔到勇武派嘅領袖」，因為先前提及過的困難，加上當時經歷了中大和理大的衝突之後，當陳嘗試跟自稱認識勇武派的人士在 Telegram 群組傾談的時候，「佢哋當時覺得呢件事好衰，當時有一句『打就係佢哋打』，可能喺前線嘅係佢哋，『畀人拉嘅係佢哋，然後你就想有一個大台』，咁我當時話『唔係，唔係我』，我話呢個係黎智英嘅諗法，然後佢就話：『黎智英？我特朗普添呀！』」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，是否代表對方表達一種不信任，即是不相信陳是跟據黎而行事。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，他向黎智英表達正正是因為該些困難而聯絡不到勇武派，不過黎說「唔緊要」，因為「佢大致掌握勇武派嘅資料同動向」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指黎智英認為應結合議會街頭和國際力量延續反修例熱情-從而推爆個政府&quot;&gt;陳梓華指黎智英認為應結合議會、街頭和國際力量延續反修例熱情 從而「推爆個政府」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，黎提到他當時會見了張崑陽，「佢（黎）對佢（張）評價好高。」據陳所理解，二人見面是要商討贊助網上電台事宜，但是張並不需要黎的贊助，而是靠眾籌已經處理得到。然後黎開始說：「眾籌真係好似好過佢一個人嘅贊助，因為眾籌啫係代表嗰件事有認受性」，即使眾籌未能達標，「都可以研究吓可唔可以吱啲錢落去，令到個眾籌可以達標。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指黎繼而談及區議會選舉大勝，「佢（黎）覺得嚟緊應該結合議會嘅力量、街頭嘅力量，同國際嘅力量，先可以延續呢個反修例運動嘅熱情，同埋推爆個政府，push it to the edge，去逼迫個政府去回應市民訴求。」&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple stakeholders have the opportunity to address labor market challenges by expanding and creating workforce development initiatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Northern Triangle of Central America (NTCA) — composed of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras — holds promise as a potential nearshoring hub for U.S. companies with facilities far abroad. With a predominantly youthful population, close proximity to the United States, and emerging sectors such as textiles, agribusiness, manufacturing, and business process outsourcing (BPO), these countries have the potential to achieve higher levels of development similar to Costa Rica or Panama if they can attract significant domestic and foreign direct investment (FDI) and develop their workforces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in human capital — that is, people’s knowledge, skills, and qualifications — and attracting companies into the region are long-term strategies worth pursuing. Since 2019, over 2 million people, particularly youth, have emigrated from the NTCA in search of opportunities elsewhere, mainly in the United States. Attracting new companies and investing in workforce development initiatives could help stabilize the region by providing people with jobs, income, and future opportunities for training and career growth. The U.S. government and the private sector have signaled commitment to increasing investment in the region through the Partnership for Central America and the White House’s Call to Action in the NTCA. Workforce development is not an easy or quick fix and must be a long-term interest for U.S. companies and development agencies as they engage in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-untapped-potential-of-economic-sectors-in-the-ntca&quot;&gt;The Untapped Potential of Economic Sectors in the NTCA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many economic development opportunities that would help NTCA countries increase formal employment and promote cross-sectoral linkages, thus creating compounding economic growth in the region. Among the most promising sectors with high growth potential are agribusiness, textiles, and manufacturing (e.g., in auto parts and electric components), as well as services such as BPO and tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Process Outsourcing:&lt;/strong&gt; BPO refers to services such as accounting, information technology (IT), call centers, payment platforms, and others that larger companies can outsource. About 48,000 Guatemalans, 80 percent of whom are bilingual, are employed by the customer service outsourcing and other BPO services. El Salvador hosts more than 70 call centers and BPO operations, employing 26,000 people, while Honduras has 47 call centers that employ more than 17,000 people. According to a report by the International Finance Corporation titled Digital Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Central America, BPO and financial services firms tend to be the first adopters of technology, including cloud computing, real-time market information tools, cybersecurity technologies, and e-commerce platforms. The report also showed that technology-using firms tend to grow the fastest. To capitalize on these sectors, workers need to be equipped with specific skills, including language competencies, digital literacy, and other “soft” skills such as customer service and good communication.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Textiles:&lt;/strong&gt; The textile and garment sector generates 270,000 direct and indirect jobs in El Salvador, 180,000 in Guatemala, and 105,000 in Honduras. Companies such as Fruit of the Loom, SanMar, Elcatex, Parkdale Mills, and Crowley have established operations in the NTCA and have taken advantage of incentives from the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) with the United States, which took effect in 2006. For example, yarn used to produce garments is covered under CAFTA-DR, and the cotton used is of U.S. origin. President and CEO of the National Council of Textile Organizations, Kim Glas, announced in February 2023 that apparel imports, many containing U.S. textile inputs, had increased 24 percent in the past year. Moreover, the Covid-19 pandemic provided additional incentive for U.S. companies to nearshore U.S. textile trade with China to NTCA countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agribusiness:&lt;/strong&gt; A quarter of the population in the Northern Triangle works in the agricultural sector. Honduras has a variety of microclimates that allow for a diversification of production, and nearly 70 percent of Guatemala’s territory is used for agricultural purposes. All countries in the region enjoy duty-free access for the entry of fresh fruits and vegetables to different markets due to various free trade agreements, including DR-CAFTA. Smallholder farmers in the Northern Triangle account for about 50 percent of agriculture exports, including commodities such as coffee, sugar, bananas, and other tropical fruits. Although there is a lot of potential within this sector, these countries still rely on products with little value added.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturing:&lt;/strong&gt; In 1965, Mexico’s maquiladora policy was adopted by the Northern Triangle countries. The policy, which enables producers and investors “tax-free importation of raw materials and intermediate inputs which they process and/or assemble and then reexport, again tax-free, to the United States,” paved the way for more FDI in the region and regional trade agreements such as NAFTA and CAFTA-DR. According to 2022 survey data from the International Labour Organization (ILO), manufacturing, as defined by the International Standard Industrial Classification, accounts for 13.7 percent of total employment in both Guatemala and Honduras and 14.5 percent in El Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies in these sectors need to continue to hire qualified workers that possess a variety of skills. For example, to conduct BPO services, employees need to master languages, in this case both English and Spanish, and need to know how to use information and communications technology (ICT) equipment. Similarly, to be able to operate specific machinery and technology, workers need to possess technical skills and different levels of digital literacy. To conduct more sophisticated engineering projects or work in advanced technical trades, workers need training in science, technology, engineering, and medicine (STEM) fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these skills, competencies, and knowledge can be imparted at schools, universities, and training institutions, while others can be learned with practice, working on the job. However, proxy studies suggest that citizens from these countries are not likely to be proficient in English and would benefit from higher levels of education achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies that operate in these countries find it hard to hire and retain qualified workers. While the chronic underdevelopment of human capital is preventing many economic sectors from growing, this challenge is not insurmountable. Development institutions, the U.S. government, private companies, and governments in the Northen Triangle have the aligned interest of wanting to see a thriving, self-sufficient market-based economy simultaneously fueled by and contributing to a highly skilled workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;labor-market-challenges-in-the-ntca&quot;&gt;Labor Market Challenges in the NTCA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weak human capital is a barrier for firms operating in the region. According to the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, which examines a combination of education, health, and employment metrics to assess human capital levels in a country, all three NTCA countries score slightly below the 56 percent average for Latin America and the Caribbean. Guatemala’s Human Capital Index score is 0.46, which means that the average child born in 2020 is estimated to be 46 percent as productive when they grow up compared to if the child enjoyed a complete education and full healthcare. Honduras and El Salvador score 48 percent and 55 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, results from the 2016 World Bank Enterprise Survey show that private firms in Honduras recognize human capital as a significant hurdle. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face challenges such as lack of entrepreneurship training and skill development programs, burdensome labor regulations, and financial illiteracy. In Guatemala, SMEs perceive that they are unable to attract talent because they cannot compete with the pay scales of larger companies. At the same time, companies that offer quality technical training often find that individuals have such low levels of primary education that the technical education is too advanced for their mastery of the material. A worker’s inability to absorb technical training due to a low-quality or nonexistent education stifles many career prospects. The private sector is unable to further train workers for in-demand jobs if there is a failure to achieve basic educational standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both access to education and the quality of schooling are major challenges in the NTCA. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) for 2022, students in Guatemala and El Salvador achieved mean mathematics scores of 344 and 343, respectively, well below the OECD average of 472. The 2022 PISA assessment for reading and math shows that El Salvador and Guatemala rank at the bottom of the list. In countries with such low performance, many students drop out and find informal jobs. For example, much of Guatemala’s youth and adolescent populations do not reach high school, with 45.8 percent of secondary education students (typically considered ages 12–17) not enrolled in or attending school. A high dropout rate for high school suggests that education is perceived to have little utility for gaining future employment. In NTCA countries, early school dropout rates are, on average, 22 percent higher than in the rest of the Latin American and Caribbean region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters, students who do not complete high school are more likely to find low-quality employment. Reinforcing this trend is a high correlation between educational attainment and employment in the formal sector. In Guatemala and Honduras, studies have found that workers who only reach lower secondary education are more likely to get jobs in the informal economy than workers with greater levels of education. Furthermore, unemployment and underemployment are common among younger age groups, and many young people remain idle, meaning they are not searching for education, training, or employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond human capital deficiencies, the region’s business environment scores very poorly and has not been able to attract significant FDI. Stringent labor market laws are a disservice for both workers and companies trying to recruit talent. Labor markets in all three NTCA countries are characterized by high levels of informality, a feature that can be attributed in part to overbearing labor regulations. For example, in Honduras, there is strong evidence to suggest that economic actors in the county bypass the constraints of the regulatory environment by maintaining few full-time employees, hiring a higher proportion of temporary workers, or avoiding formalization entirely. Data from the 2016 World Bank Enterprise Survey show that 72.5 percent of Honduran firms compete directly against unregistered or informal firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current labor laws preventing flexibility in the workplace needlessly add opportunity costs for workers, especially for young professionals and women. “Ordinary” working hours add rigidity to the labor market, as they limit the amount of work that must be completed during a certain window of the day. For example, in Honduras, standard working hours cannot exceed 44 hours per week and must be completed between 5:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. This creates scheduling challenges for students that may need to attend classes during the day, or for parents wanting to work while their children are in school during the day and after they go to bed at night. Night work, a separate classification of labor, is performed between 7:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. and cannot exceed 36 hours per week. Guatemala has the same maximum of 44 hours per week for daytime workers but classifies a daytime worker using a smaller window of work occurring between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Such outdated labor laws remove the flexibility enjoyed by remote workers elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, working on a part-time basis or seasonally is not always allowed in the region. Guatemala did not ratify the ILO’s Part-Time Work Convention until 2017, only to have its constitutional court later suspend the framework. The Honduran congress created the National Hourly Employment Program in 2010, which allowed hourly contracts, but the program has since been met with resistance by labor unions, the Honduran Association of Labor Lawyers (AALH), and political opposition. Currently, only indefinite-term contracts, fixed-term contracts, and project contracts are permissible in Honduras and Guatemala. In an attempt to protect workers, these regulations are eliminating options for workers that would make education, skilling, and training outside of work more feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improving-education-and-easing-labor-market-barriers&quot;&gt;Improving Education and Easing Labor Market Barriers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges should not deter action or investment. The U.S. government and the private sector have an opportunity to work together to eliminate impediments and energize the labor market. There are three areas that require policy intervention to improve labor market outcomes in the region: (1) improving the business environment, including worker flexibility, (2) enhancing the quality of work and addressing informality, and (3) supporting educational institutions and workforce development initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve the business environment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Rather than pursuing piecemeal reforms for particular sectors, countries in the region should take a less prescriptive approach by prioritizing legislative reforms that would benefit any sector of the economy. The World Justice Program’s 2023 Rule of Law Index, which includes 142 countries, ranks El Salvador 108th, Guatemala 111th, and Honduras Above regulatory reforms for specific sectors, NTCA countries should prioritize building better business environments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The private sector demands predictable government regulation to allow for more flexible hiring. Hourly wages and other business-friendly adjustments to labor law in the region would allow the workforce to expand in high seasons or work during peak hours only. Requiring all employees to be salaried restrains employers and employees from achieving the most mutually beneficial transactions. Not only would these measures entice prospective companies to invest in the region, but they would also help existing companies and workforce programs scale in size and impact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve working conditions and address informality.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Second, there is also a need to improve the quality of the jobs and working conditions in the region. Studies show that people employed in the formal economy earn 19 percent more than those in the informal sector. In addition to job-matching programs and workforce training, private sector leaders can support formalization in their own supply chains, and governments in the region can lower administrative costs and help informal business navigate requirements for formalization. Likewise, local governments can incentivize corporate social responsibility through tax exemptions and other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Increased digitization is an opportunity to promote formalization, delivery of services, and transparency in the enforcement of contracts. Digitization would help small informal businesses, including in the agricultural sector, to register and conduct operations beyond immediate markets through e-commerce. In addition to expanding market size, digitizing informal businesses can also improve access to credit and risk assessments. This is an important pillar of U.S. vice president Kamala Harris’s Call to Action to remove barriers to private sector investment in the Northern Triangle. El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras ranked 107th, 114th, and 180th, respectively, out of 193 countries in the United Nation’s 2022 E-Government Development Index, an assessment of country-level digital government landscapes. Moreover, the digitization of customs processes would save time and costs, encouraging further investment. Converting bureaucratic processes such as land and business registration to paperless interfaces would also help in the fight against corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support educational institutions and workforce development initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Finally, better education and workforce development efforts should be a high priority. Not all of these programs have to be led by large multinational companies. Supporting local businesses with a high potential to create employment is another avenue to enable private sector growth and job creation. Moreover, development agencies that have a significant footprint in the region, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Inter-American Development Bank, can be force multipliers for companies and governments in the region by absorbing some risk and providing capital. The United States has recognized the strategic significance and economic potential of the region and intends to support efforts to make technical training programs more relevant to employers’ needs. Training programs, boot camps, and other workforce initiatives have been implemented in the region to redeem the situation and provide better opportunities for workers. These initiatives can be replicated and scaled in other sectors (see Box 1 for a list of some of these initiatives).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Collaboration among government entities and the private sector has led to the design and implementation of low-cost, high-reward training programs, helping to guarantee job formalization. For example, Advance, funded by USAID, is a workforce development program in Guatemala and Honduras (as well as the Dominican Republic and Jamaica) that brings together stakeholders from the educational and private sectors to identify priority economic sectors and strengthen technical education to meet labor market needs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) programs overseen by employers can also help guarantee that workers are equipped with the right sets of skills required to succeed in their field. Companies can provide technical expertise in curriculum development so that students are motivated to complete school knowing they will have the tools to succeed in the labor market. In addition, technology is shaping the labor market and redefining what skills are in demand. Ensuring TVET programs remain relevant amid technological changes requires continual curriculum development.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, those who would benefit from programs may not be aware of the opportunity. Local governments and schools should coordinate with those offering workforce development programs to advertise the availability of existing programs, whether through social service professionals or social media campaigns. Low enrollment in existing quality workforce development offerings is a missed opportunity for all parties. Raising awareness of current initiatives could spur further investment and boost enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition, investing in bilingual education can reap significant benefits to build the region’s human capital. In Honduras, bilingual education used to be offered only in private institutions, but the Honduran government has recognized the value of bilingual education and is pushing for the country to be more attractive for bilingual companies. The Honduran minister of education is committed to opening bilingual teaching training centers in pursuit of his vision to have Honduras be a bilingual nation by 2032. A World Bank study found that bilingual students in Guatemala had higher attendance rates, lower dropout rates, and received higher scores on all subject matters. The incentives for school systems to equip students with language skills are clear.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;promising-workforce-models&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Promising Workforce Models&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Domestic private sector leaders have partnered with higher education institutions to ensure that training is equipping students with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in the workplace. Below are several examples of promising models:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Textiles: No formal textile training exists in the region despite industry demand for tens of thousands of workers. Think HUGE, a job creation business council for the region, has partnered with Universidad Tecnológica Centroamericana (UNITEC) in Honduras and the Wilson College of Textiles at North Carolina State University to establish an educational network for the textile industry. The agreement outlines plans for developing professional training courses, certificate programs, degrees, and funding for scholarships, fellowships, and internships.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Electric Components: Yazaki North America announced a pilot-project factory in Guatemala in January 2022, becoming Guatemala’s first automotive parts manufacturer. The company also already operates in El Salvador. Yazaki chose to expand nearshoring efforts after experiencing supply chain difficulties during the Covid-19 pandemic. Another reason Guatemala was attractive for Yazaki was the commitment of El Instituto Técnico de Capacitación y Productividad (INTECAP), a leading Guatemalan organization with the mission of promoting employability and technical development, to create training programs specifically for Yazaki. Dozens of Guatemalan workers have already completed courses on topics ranging from industrial Ethernet and Profibus networks to mechanical and electrical measurements. Yazaki collaborated with USAID and the Guatemalan Ministry of Economy in making the investment.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Value Chains: The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) approved a project in 2021 aimed at strengthening regional value chains in the Northern Triangle. It aims to foster talent development in the three countries by providing finishing school programs to equip workers with English and IT certifications. These skills will be highly valuable for success in the BPO sector, as well as the enhancement of regional and global integration in value chains.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Moreover, Alterna, in partnership with USAID, supports small and growing businesses by providing business and technical services. As of March 2024, 85 businesses had completed Alterna’s cultivation processes to improve business-market intelligence, gain strategic-financial knowledge, hone digital and soft skills, and access value chain connections and financing opportunities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Software: The Kodigo Academy for Creative Technology and the IDB Laboratory, the innovation laboratory of the IDB, invested $1.5 million into launching a software training program. The program aims to train 1,500 people by offering courses in various branches of the growing digital sector. In an era where many existing jobs are under threat of being replaced by artificial intelligence and automation, it is important to develop skills that will remain relevant as technology advances.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies looking to outsource production closer to home are usually turning to Canada and Mexico as their first choices for relocation. They should also consider NTCA countries as potential nearshoring locations. U.S. companies hesitating to invest or expand in the region due to workforce challenges can be a part of the solution, working in tandem with development organizations and international supporters to reduce security risks, energy costs, infrastructure insufficiencies, and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the prerequisites to invest or expand operations in the NTCA is a skilled workforce. Governments, private actors, and donors must work in coordination to reduce barriers for investment while creating and expanding workforce development initiatives. A comprehensive approach is necessary, one that combines the private sector’s expertise and the international community’s access to finance with the public sector’s ability to build inviting regulatory environments and infrastructure. The U.S. government, other international partners, and multilateral development banks should champion the needed policy changes and use their funding of workforce development programs to get commitment from governments in the NTCA to pursue pro-business reforms. By supporting the stated ambitions of all Northern Triangle governments through the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, the U.S. government is investing in increasing the availability of meaningful economic opportunities for citizens in the NTCA. Building a shared vision and investing in proven programs can help the region stem the outflow of people, further stabilize, and unlock its full economic potential.&lt;/p&gt;

It postulates three challenges that increasing battlefield transparency and ubiquitous long-range precision fires pose to logistics:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Logistics must enter the theatre of operations where infrastructure is concentrated, and so key sustainment nodes can be struck throughout operational depth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because supply is projected from known points of origin, it is susceptible to pattern-of-life analysis, enabling highly disruptive targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once forces are fixed in combat, the limited number of ground lines of communication to their positions makes them systemically vulnerable to isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two processes involved in tactical sustainment: the flow of materiel forwards to resupply units; and the recovery of equipment and casualties rearwards. The principles driving tactical adaptation to ensure survivability of these functions are well established and well tested – dispersal, deception and convoys. Technology is transforming how these principles can be applied. For resupply, three technologies and approaches are critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dispersion of caches throughout the rear support area can now be managed through digitised command and control (C2) and planning support tools to avoid concentrating supplies in logistics hubs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of containers and mixed loads can create a uniformity and thus ambiguity to sustainment components that minimises the ability of the adversary to target the logistics structure efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The deliberate support to logistics elements from combat arms during last mile resupply to open windows for safe passage can enable safe delivery to the front. Given the constraints on how often this can be accomplished, it requires the accurate predictive push of materiel to be efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical support is especially vulnerable. This is because of the electromagnetic signature of medical posts, combined with the decline in adherence to international humanitarian law as regards the protected status of hospitals. It is therefore necessary for medical support to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Maximise the mobility of Role 2 hospitals by mounting their constituent parts on vehicles and maintaining modular capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adapt tactics, techniques and procedures to enable surgery with intermittent relocation, to enable medical posts to continue to function in the indirect fire zone, ensuring damage-control resuscitation can be delivered within 60 minutes of injury.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Equipping and crewing Role 1 facilities to maximise the precision of triage to avoid saturating surgical capacity, bypass Role 2 for those who can be safely evacuated further to the rear on a longer timeline, and offer palliative care to those who cannot be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ensure that medical support has resilient C2 that can fully exploit the data necessary to coordinate dispersed operations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data is similarly critical to ensuring the survivability of repair and maintenance support:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The use of digital twins to conduct predictive maintenance on complex systems is a key tool for maximising the efficiency of forwards to support dispersed platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For sophisticated components, platform modularity is critical in enabling sensors and other payloads to be swapped out, so that broken components can be repaired in the rear. For simple parts, additive manufacture can be used to minimise the number of unique spares that must be held at the rear of units and brought forwards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For the repair sites themselves, deception is an increasingly important tool for improving survivability, as concealment is increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these measures can make a supply system robust, even under extensive surveillance. However, a sustainment system working in this way will still impose constraints on combat arms. It is therefore essential that the combat arms adjust their planning assumptions as regards tempo, the sustainable size of force packages, and the force protection they must offer to their service support arms if they are to sustain the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cliché that while amateurs talk tactics, professionals talk logistics may be how militaries ought to function, but it is not reflective of peacetime practice. There is relatively little attention given to sustainment in either the British Army’s “Future Soldier” or the US Army’s “U.S. Army in Multi-Domain Operations”. As the Russian invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated, logistics appear to have played a limited role in the Kremlin’s professional planning, showing that the gap between policy aspirations and capability is far from being a uniquely Western conceptual oversight. Nevertheless, throughout history, logistics and sustainment have dictated the size of armies that can be fielded, their tempo, lethality, endurance and resilience. Furthermore, the threats that are reshaping tactics for combat arms units similarly create serious challenges for combat service support (CSS) elements. This paper seeks, therefore, to outline both the threats to CSS and how these risks can be mitigated through tactical and capability development. The questions the paper hopes to provoke – although not answer here – is how changes in sustainment operations must necessarily shape planning assumptions for the combat arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustainment is a broad doctrinal term encompassing logistics, medical support, engineering support, pay and personnel services, and maintenance. This paper concerns logistics and medical support forward of the corps: those functions that keep fighting formations able to operate, and which require regular transfers of materiel and personnel forwards and rearwards. The questions of theatre and operational sustainment at corps and above are beyond the scope of this paper, partly because they are largely a question of integrated air and missile defence and cyber defence, which are not solely relevant to sustainment. Nor is this paper concerned with tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for tactical resupply by support companies inside fighting battalions, as this subject is specific to the particular sub-units being supported. The paper focuses on the divisional support area, protection of its functions, and the forward and rearward flow of materiel by close support sustainment units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is divided into four chapters. Chapter I outlines the threats to CSS elements, examining how the changing operating environment poses specific tactical problems for CSS. Chapter II examines how tactical and capability adaptation may solve some of these challenges for resupply of formations, focusing on the movement of materiel forwards in a largely proactively planned manner. Chapters III and IV examine how militaries may mitigate threats to sustainment activities that rely on rearward movement, largely imposed by the adversary: medical and maintenance support. The conclusion considers the impact of these considerations on combat arms, indicating areas for further study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has a broad evidence base. The assessment of threat systems is derived from: observation of deep strike capabilities and their kill chains employed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine; practical experimentation with a range of sensor systems and the associated signatures of CSS elements on exercises across NATO; and a review of literature on threat systems, mainly related to the impact on combat arms. The baseline for the potential threat is drawn from core planning assumptions for the sustainment footprint of existing formations. With regard to mitigations, the aim is to identify what a CSS footprint must look like to be survivable given the constraints of the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s conclusions are largely based on practical observation of sustainment operations, mapping timing and footprint, and interviews with CSS practitioners worldwide over several years. Interviews have also been conducted with dozens of figures in the field of medical sustainment, both individually and at conferences, workshops and exercises. Conclusions are also based on the bitter experience of one of the authors of observing the complications that arose around the sustainment of Ukraine’s armed forces, and the innovative solutions that were found. One of the authors is a senior practitioner, who draws on extensive experience from operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper’s methodology is, therefore, essentially an iterative mapping of dependencies. It is important to note that beyond theatre sustainment, military combat service support is, as B A Friedman observed, more of an art than a science. There are numerical inputs that generate the boundaries of possibility but, unlike in a civilian logistics system, the active attempt by an adversary to disrupt processes creates risk in the pursuit of efficiency. For this reason, the authors have sought to focus on the risk calculus that commanders will face, and the constraints the threat will place on their freedom of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-the-emerging-threat-landscape&quot;&gt;I. The Emerging Threat Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2022 it would have been reasonable to assert that the Ukrainian military was being defeated. The enemy had amassed a 10:1 advantage in artillery, was achieving blanket saturation of the electromagnetic spectrum, and had shaped the battlefield to fix Ukrainian forces in killing areas. They were suffering an unsustainable attrition rate, while unable either to find Russian targets or to bring their guns in range to disrupt the Russian fires system. Then everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From late June, Ukrainian Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) began to target Russian command-and-control (C2) nodes and logistics hubs. As stockpile after stockpile of ammunition was destroyed, Russian guns were starved of ammunition. The sudden need to disperse C2 alongside attrition of key electronic warfare platforms opened up seams in the electromagnetic spectrum. Over the course of two weeks, the Ukrainians started locating targets and striking back. The Russians saw their fires dominance evaporate, never to be fully regained. They adapted their logistics system, pulling stockpiles back beyond GMLRS range, but this limited the number of rounds their guns could reach, rendering it impossible to achieve the level of fires saturation demanded by their doctrine. In two weeks, the Russians not only lost fires superiority, but saw a whole way of war fade into obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be reassuring to believe that the threat to logistics is a distinctly Russian problem. After all, it was GMLRS – fielded by several NATO countries – that disrupted the Russian logistics system. The Russians, meanwhile, have struggled to achieve a similar scale of disruption to Ukraine’s logistics infrastructure. This would be a hubristic level of complacency, however. An examination of how Ukrainian forces used satellite imagery to locate and map the Russian supply system, and the munitions necessary to strike its components, reveals that the technology is available and affordable even for non-state actors. Moreover, Western logistics practices are in many respects as vulnerable as Russian sustainment operations. NATO medical doctrine for warfighting is still fundamentally predicated on concentrating capacity in Role 2 and Role 3 field hospitals, with the Red Cross contributing to their protection. Ukrainian forces lost several such facilities, discovering that Russian EW-based targeting will not distinguish field hospitals from other nodes, and that the footprint of one of its Role 2 facilitiess fitted almost precisely within the lethal blast radius of a 122 mm high explosive round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any effective response to these challenges must be based on a realistic analysis of the threat. This paper begins with a summary of the “find and fires revolution”, as it applies to sustainment. There are three elements to this: ISR; connectivity; and precision strike. In turn, there follow three general problems for logisticians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;large-footprints-and-fixed-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Large Footprints and Fixed Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The volume of materiel consumed by a large military formation is immense. An Abrams main battle tank, for example, consumes approximately 1.86 gallons of fuel per mile. A squadron traversing 10 miles of terrain could easily consume 260 gallons of fuel, not counting the fuel required for their supporting vehicles. The volumes necessary to sustain an army require the exploitation of large-scale commercial infrastructure before fuel and supplies can be broken down into deliveries to the front. Sustainment operations are therefore critically dependent on ports, terminals, rail infrastructure, storage tanks, and depots – large, fixed targets that cannot be moved rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of dispersion, viable for tactical formations, is only partially realisable for sustainment operations. This is because the greater the distance that logistics elements need to travel to resupply forces, the less efficient the logistics operation, since a greater proportion of the organisation’s resource must be used to resupply and sustain itself. In Afghanistan, where logistics infrastructure was largely uncontested, sustainment operations absorbed up to half of the force. This is not a historically unusual proportion. Rapid expansion of a logistics operation therefore comes at the expense of the efficiency of the force. Moreover, the greater the level of dispersion of logistics elements, which for reasons of efficiency are necessarily lightly armed and armoured, the greater the force protection requirement, drawing combat arms away from combat tasks. Furthermore, sustainment must flow through civilian infrastructure, such as ports, that is optimised for efficiency in peace and therefore concentrated. After this point they may begin to disperse, but they enter theatre concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is that logistics and sustainment must concentrate at the operational level in large, fixed installations that are identifiable to the enemy and which often constitute single points of failure. In the Falklands campaign, a strike on the logistics hub at Ajax Bay would have immobilised much of the British force. The runway at Ascension Island constituted another potential single point of failure in the ability to maintain momentum. In Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, although there are multiple options for supplying the various fronts, Crimea, which is vital ground, is essentially dependent on two railways for resupply, one of which depends on a single prestige piece of infrastructure: the Kerch Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, many logistics sites were protected by two factors. First, the enemy lacked sufficiently accurate weapons to reliably destroy these targets. The US, for example, had to fly hundreds of sorties to be able to reliably damage bridges before the introduction of precision guided munitions, and even after laser designation increased accuracy, the threat to aircraft from surface-to-air missiles made such targets high risk. The second factor was the number of munitions that needed to be brought to bear to have a decisive effect. Precision munitions were expensive, while the separation of stores by berms across a depot would mean that a large number of munitions would need to be committed to destroy materiel where it was concentrated. It is also worth noting that some classes of sustainment infrastructure – notably hospitals – have protected status and ought not to be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors no longer hold. The proliferation of cruise missile technology means that strikes against critical logistical infrastructure can be sustained without exposing crews to risk. Moreover, the maturation of cheap one-way-attack munitions, capable of damaging soft targets and striking with considerable precision, means that it is now possible to precisely strike a large volume of targets across a logistics depot, destroying stores in place. The destruction by Russian forces of several Ukrainian ammunition dumps with thermite grenades (prior to the full-scale Russian invasion) and the detonation of a Syrian Army ammunition dump at a stadium in Deir ez-Zor with improvised one-way-attack munitions demonstrate the scale of effect that is achievable by these means. The presumption of protected status, moreover, is no longer honoured by many states, rendering these facilities highly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At higher echelon the impact of these trends is relatively straightforward. First, depots are being moved into greater depth to increase the cost of the munitions that can reach them and thereby reduce the number of strikes that are possible. This then allows for the concentration of defensive systems. However, supplies must subsequently traverse a greater area, and satisfactory solutions for the protection of sustainment capabilities in the intervening space have not yet been identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pattern-of-life&quot;&gt;Pattern of Life&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer to the Forward Line of Own Troops (FLOT), the challenge is that sustainment operations create highly predicable and detectable patterns of life. Vehicles must drive through fuelling points and casualties have to be drawn back to medical facilities. Refuelling and casualty movements both require dynamic planning and thus communication, such that the medical facilities and sustainment points acquire pronounced and distinctive electromagnetic signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, unless a signature was maintained for a sustained period, incidental exposure provided limited opportunity to systematically map CSS elements in the deep. Today, however, Ground Moving Target Indication, space-based electromagnetic surveying and other wide-area collection systems enable the sustained observation of patterns of life throughout operational depth, including the tracking of unique signatures. When combined with modern analytical tools, the patterns that emerge over time become highly revealing. For example, if vehicles routinely pause outside a particular building when rotating to and from the front, they immediately become a point of interest, to be placed under close analysis. If synthetic aperture radar imagery can be cued to coincide with a vehicle stopping, it may become possible to confirm that it is a fuelling point. Russian strikes on medical facilities in Syria are a useful case in point. The persistent communication from these facilities, and the presence of cellular phones associated with fighters, made even subterranean facilities distinctive. For Russia, lacking concerns about international law, these facilities became targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The handover of supplies to units in motion must be based on battle drills and standard operating procedures. The selection and communication of cache points, the deconfliction of movement through the rear, and the confirmation of time of handover will all follow pre-agreed procedures that will be replicated. Sustainment, unlike many tactical actions, is a constant task and so there is a consistent pattern of life generated by a force’s tactics, techniques and procedures. These are not only detectable – increasingly so over time – but once a point has been confirmed it becomes possible to track vehicles moving to and from locations to build up a map of logistics nodes, so that the exposure of one point can contaminate others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stand-off sensors that enable this kind of observation – satellites, radar, long-range UAVs and other capabilities – are persistent and survivable. For units conducting tactical actions, the use of electronic warfare and other measures can disrupt enemy kill chains and intelligence collection for limited periods to create windows of opportunity for manoeuvre. But it is not realistic to achieve widespread denial of these capabilities over a sustained period and an expansive area. Consequently, the burden of adaptation falls to the sustainment elements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the more that is done to protect sustainment elements, especially force protection engineering, the greater the signature of the activity and the easier it is to track and map. For example, it was possible just using commercial satellites to track the end-to-end transfer of ammunition for Russia from North Korea to the Ukraine front by observing the loading, unloading and preparations for receipt of shipping containers. The expansion of berms ahead of the arrival of these munitions was a clear indicator of where materiel would be moved, even before it was shipped. With access to real-time ISR – rather than commercial satellites with longer latency between collection and dissemination – it would be possible to track the movement forwards from these dumps and thereby establish the placement of caches or the location of batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-predictability-of-ground-lines-of-communication&quot;&gt;The Predictability of Ground Lines of Communication&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manoeuvre forces have a range of options to prevent them from being located with a high level of accuracy or, worse still, anticipated. Dispersion and the exploitation of multiple axes or unusual approaches to targets can allow them to maintain a high level of ambiguity as to their movements and dispositions while out of contact. For sustainment elements, supporting dispersed forces reduces efficiency, but is achievable. Once combat elements become engaged with the enemy, however, two important things occur. First, sustainment demand spikes, as combat forces use their ammunition at a much greater rate and begin to require evacuation of damaged vehicles and injured and dead personnel. Second, combat forces become fixed and the options for the routes by which resupply can occur become significantly constrained, especially if the contact occurs on vital ground. Resupply may be via only one or two ground lines of communication (GLOCs) to reach the fighting units. Moreover, as artillery targets rotating units or resupply convoys, the available GLOCs are degraded or destroyed, with bridges especially susceptible. Temporary bridging can alleviate this problem somewhat, but between the weight limits and damage to the roads, it is common for traffic to only be able to move in one direction over these points. This risks creating traffic jams, and so careful sequencing of forward and return traffic becomes critical. This planning requirement further constrains sustainment troops’ ability to manoeuvre, because they must deliver a significant proportion of materiel and recover casualties within specified timelines, while also having set windows of opportunity within which they can do so along GLOCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The threat to contested GLOCs has been exacerbated by UAVs. Penetrating the FLOT, UAVs will routinely seek to maintain observation over GLOCs and thereby direct artillery fire onto sustainment troops while they move. This dynamic has occurred repeatedly throughout Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, such that in some instances Ukraine has lost more personnel during troop rotations than it has in contact. The planning challenges created by the sustainment of Severodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka are instructive. In these instances, two GLOCs were preserved but were held under artillery fire. The interdiction of Russian sustainment operations over the bridges in support of Kherson are similarly illustrative of how a force can be disproportionately attrited by fixing its combat power to expose its logistics elements and then using fires to render the position unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defending sustainment assets once fixed in combat can be achieved. Sanitising the airspace above GLOCs for a period can be delivered by electromagnetic warfare troops and air defence. The use of fires to suppress enemy artillery during a resupply can also reduce the threat. Alternatively, engineers can work to expand the quality of the route, or the number of paths that can be taken. In extremis, logistics can be carried out by vehicles with greater off-road mobility, whether amphibious or tracked, to maintain a diversity of avenues of approach. For small and urgent deliveries, unmanned aircraft systems may be able to shuttle material forwards. The problem with all these methods is that they lead to combat arms who are in contact, diverting resources to protect resupply. This in turn increases the sustainment requirements of the force. Even increasing the mobility of the sustainment force through different vehicles necessarily comes with an increase in cost and complexity, and expands their organic support requirements. These all reduce the efficiency of the fighting force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final complication is the handover of materiel to troops. If the support to forces in contact is conducted within a constrained window of time, determined by the period when counterbattery fire and air defence can lift the threat, it encourages the maximum volume of materiel to be pushed in the smallest number of vehicles possible. The combined arms enablement of the resupply, however, means that the enemy will know what is happening. Once the supplies have arrived at the battle area, they must then be distributed to dispersed fighting elements. First, there is the risk of the supplies being struck once unloaded. Second, there is the risk that if a support element moves supplies from the unloading point to the fighting positions it will be traceable – enemy ISR would have been tipped off about the need to focus by the counterbattery fire – and so will reveal the fighting positions and separate them from the decoy fighting positions that forces are increasingly having to use to remain survivable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, therefore, the find and fires revolution risks making supply of forces costly and complicated by holding fixed logistical infrastructure at sustained risk, by unpicking the supply nodes through pattern-of-life analysis in the deep using stand-off sensors, and by contesting the GLOCs to fighting units. The result of this is to diminish the ability of a force to achieve operational tempo and, by constraining the supplies that can be built up, limit the depth that units can plan to threaten and thereby limit the cognitive risk felt by the enemy. If units can only build up the ammunition, fuel and other supplies to punch a limited distance into enemy terrain before pausing, it becomes easier for the enemy to manage the release and commitment of reserves to ensure that offensive operations must always be against a deliberate, rather than a hasty, defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-adapting-resupply-to-sustain-the-force&quot;&gt;II. Adapting Resupply to Sustain the Force&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, in very simple terms, two kinds of sustainment activity. The first is resupply – pushing materiel forwards; the second is recovery – pulling resources backwards, for example, maintenance and medical capabilities. This chapter considers the process by which materiel is moved forwards, while Chapters III and IV consider recovery. Having examined the factors that expose sustainment operations to distinct threats on the future battlefield, several conclusions can be drawn about how combat service support elements will need to adapt, and where adaptation will impose additional demands on the wider force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principles of protection described in this chapter are not new. Dispersion, deception and convoys are techniques that have been used for centuries. However, these concepts can now be applied in particularly important ways because of emerging technologies. This chapter therefore considers the relationship between technology and emerging tactics to address an evolving threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;randomised-dispersed-storage&quot;&gt;Randomised Dispersed Storage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a warehouse. Traditionally, it has comprised rows of shelves on which objects are placed in a systematic order. Books, for example, might be laid out alphabetically, or boxes given serial numbers, to be stacked in sequence. Each shelf stack would have a designation. Goods that were regularly requested would be stacked closest to the door, and those objects least regularly requested stacked further from the entrance, to maximise efficiency. Such a system allowed a human logistician, who could not remember where an object was in the warehouse, to look up its location, quickly proceed to the relevant area and then move along the shelves until arriving at the correct item. Someone who had never visited the warehouse before could find the items they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With their network of depots and storage dumps, divisional and brigade support areas follow similar patterns – orderly sites where paper-based tables allow supply personnel to enter and retrieve specific loads. Such a system means that when a spare part arrives from a higher echelon, as long as it is allocated an appropriate serial number it can be inserted in a location where it can rapidly be found. In NATO militaries, this system has evolved to work in support of a pull logistics system, whereby units flag their requirements and only the requested items are retrieved from their storage locations, reducing waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layout of modern warehouses is changing, however. In a warehouse with a robotic retrieval system, or “smart warehouse”, it is not uncommon for the storage of items to be random. Books might be stored next to toasters and shower gel, with no particular logic other than that dissimilar items are co-located. The reasons for this are simple. For a computer, when an item is placed in the warehouse, its coordinates in three dimensions can be retained as a small data entry and remembered. Unlike the human operator there is no need for a robot to work towards an object by following a building–stack–shelf–location sequence, it can simply go to the coordinates associated with the item. Dissimilar storage reduces the likelihood of mistakes (for example, through a calibration error of a robotic arm). An error is much more likely to be detected if, in attempting to pick up a book, it finds itself clasping a shovel (as opposed to a different book). Even if the machine does not detect the error, a supervisor is more likely to notice. Randomised placement, while reducing the risk of localisation errors for robotic retrieval systems, is not space efficient, so there is much effort put into refining localisation methodologies in civilian logistics. Since the military will continue to retrieve items using humans, however, localisation does not need to be as precise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relevance of this to militaries is not that robotics can replace humans in logistics, but rather that the distribution of materiel across the battlespace need not see the concentration of like materials at centralised locations. Militaries have used GPS tags on shipping containers to assist in retrieving the appropriate boxes for some time. The problem with this is obviously that the boxes broadcast their location and that there is a high risk of GPS disruption. The digitised warehouses, however, hold the location data centrally, based on logging where it was placed. This appears to be a more viable approach, although periodic backups are necessary to avoid corruption of the database. The result is that today it is reasonable to have materiel scattered broadly in small caches all over the rear area in such a manner as to massively complicate tracking and targeting and reduce the efficiency of strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One historical downside to dispersing logistics is the planning complications it introduces of moving materiel from depots to units. With a paper-based planning process creating orders, the need to coordinate movement to a large number of unpredictable dispersed locations every time there is the requirement to resupply a unit would take a great deal of time. It would also create a range of challenges as regards route deconfliction, and a need to coordinate laterally between different logistics units that would entail much communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference today is the ubiquity of smart planning tools. Uber Eats is perhaps the most immediately comprehensible civilian corollary. Uber Eats is premised upon a situation where a recipient will call for supply from a position that was not previously known, for materiel from a location that was not previously known, and the application must calculate the most appropriate carrier given the timing and location of both parties. Moreover, it must coordinate many of these interactions simultaneously. Uber Eats has the advantage of a highly detailed map, terrain that degrades very slowly, and ubiquitous connectivity. Nevertheless, ticketing systems could make it feasible to push jobs to elements with intermittent connectivity. The military today has the capacity to map terrain rapidly using space-based observation. Route planning that accounts for damage is harder to automate, but the process of manually updating this information is fundamentally comparable to the burden of feeding this data into staff planning. A range of technologies today, therefore, allow for storage of materiel to be effectively dispersed throughout the battle area without having a disproportionately negative impact on efficiency. Beyond the key points of theatre entry where civilian logistics anchor logistics, therefore, it becomes possible to break up the concentrated supply areas in the divisional support area, eliminating high pay-off targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ambiguous-loads&quot;&gt;Ambiguous Loads&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety in the carriage of ammunition and fuel is important. Incidents such as that aboard RFA have underscored the sound injunction to separate the carriage of personnel and munitions. This has since been extended to an aversion to mixing loads of most kinds in peacetime. Thus, militaries often field specialist fuel bowsers that have a distinct signature. This helps logistics in peacetime because it means the bowsers can meet safety standards and have greater freedom to drive on civilian roads. There is also an efficiency to the concentration of materiel in transit. For example, a box of ammunition will stack neatly with other boxes of ammunition because they have the same dimensions, and the tracking of materiel is also simpler if each container contains a specific type of item. Thus, a round of ammunition will sit in a box of ammunition, which will sit on a pallet of ammunition within a container shipment of ammunition, for which there will be a clear set of rules governing the transport, tracking and security of the load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of this approach must contend with the need to break down loads in order to actually resupply units. Few tactical units, for example, require a shipping container’s worth of ammunition. A pallet is much more manageable. Unhelpfully, they also require food, water and spares that do not pack neatly, along with many other consumables. Generally, the need to concentrate the shipping containers to be able to draw from multiple different kinds of stores is done at relatively high echelon because of the concentration of containers. Nevertheless, loads tend to remain separated, with a supply convoy having different loads on different vehicles. Resupply convoys will then move to handover points, either with the logistics unit supporting the lower echelon, or once the operation shifts from formation sustainment to unit resupply, the convoy will usually conduct a circuit, handing over several pallets from each vehicle to a receiving group from the unit, to be broken up according to the disposition of the unit and thereafter distributed to the various fighting elements. This approach is noteworthy for its simplicity and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also increasingly vulnerable. It necessarily creates a series of interlinked circles of continuous movement, from known storage hubs to identifiable handover points, and the movement from these points can be traced forward to identify fighting positions. Moreover, the separation and distinctness of loads produces some very particular vulnerabilities. The UK’s 1 Aviation Brigade, for example, fielded eight fuel bowsers as its entire fuel capability until recently. Targeting these could potentially have grounded the brigade. Their movement from the main brigade support area could also indicate the establishment of a forward arming and refuelling point, setting up the conditions for strikes during refuelling. Measures have since been taken to address this and other vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the example is instructive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To break the pattern-of-life vulnerability generated by the existing model and reduce the size of logistical resupply convoys, it is necessary to adopt two measures. The first is to increase the ambiguity of loads by pulling shipping containers further forward in the battlespace. The second is to shift to mixed loads, not of people and ammunition, but of different kinds of stores. Clearly, when containers are shipped into the theatre, efficiency will drive them to be concentrated, as is currently the case. However, at the theatre sustainment level, it becomes desirable to unpack these containers and pack containers with unit-relevant caches comprising mixed loads. Some loads, such as fuel, cannot be readily mixed, but should still be pumped into bladders within containers, thereby rendering the contents of any given shipment ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical stores and facilities have traditionally been visibly distinct, partly as medical elements are specifically protected under international humanitarian law (IHL) if they hold to their duties of neutrality and do not, for example, engage in moving ammunition or other lethal supplies. Critically, this protection has been shown to be ineffective in many current conflicts, with hospitals now becoming specific targets. It may therefore be reasonable, or indeed necessary, to hide medical stores and even units in the plain sight of general supplies. Rendering medical capabilities indistinguishable from other stores, rather than actually mixing loads with them, is compatible with IHL, although it means that enemies who strike these facilities have the defence that it was not possible to discriminate between them and legitimate targets. This approach may be highly context dependent, as some adversaries may show greater respect for non-combatant status than Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact contents of a container cache depends entirely on the formation being supported and the planning assumptions of its levels of consumption. However, to use straw man figures to illustrate the process, in intense periods of fighting an infanteer can expect to need 616 rounds of 5.56 mm ammunition per day, assuming a carriage of 10 magazines, plus one in the rifle, and one full replenishment. Often they carry fewer, but this is the upper limit. If they were carrying fewer, many would use the saved weight to carry additional rounds for machine guns or other support weapons. Thus, a company plus attachments, roughly 150 people, will need approximately 92,400 5.56 mm rounds or equivalents per day in intense fighting. An ammunition box holds approximately 1,200 rounds of 5.56 mm. A standard pallet measuring 100 cm x 120 cm can hold approximately 21 boxes, so that four pallets can carry 100,800 rounds. Four pallets can also carry enough 24-hour ration packs for an equivalent number of troops. Thus, packed with the rations over the ammunitions, food and ammunition for a company for a day can fit into a 10-ft shipping container. A standard lorry could either carry a second 10-ft container for other kinds of stores, like batteries and water, or a single 20-ft shipping container, with all stores in the same container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than a handover point, there could be a process whereby mission caches are carried from the operational hub in small packets of vehicles and the containers dropped in the rear of a unit. The location of the drop and the contents of the container is uploaded to the logistics system. When it comes time for the unit to retrieve its supplies, its close support logistics element raises a ticket with the logistics C2 system and is assigned a location, or several options, where the requested stores can be found. They can then retrieve the pallets, leaving the container, while informing the logistics C2 system of what was taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first instance, this may not sound very different in its implications to the current process. Over a relatively short period of time, however, the effect is to distribute many containers across the rear area, some of which are empty, while others remain full, some of which contain fuel and others not, and some of which contain specialist loads, while others contain standard stores. It rapidly becomes highly ambiguous for the adversary to know where anything is, or what any pattern might be. Containers can, of course, be periodically retrieved. Or one of the containers whose contents have not been depleted may be moved further forward as the force advances. The result, however, is to break any consistent pattern as to where close support logistics elements go, and thus mitigate the threat from pattern-of-life analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;planned-predictive-push-and-last-mile-resupply&quot;&gt;Planned Predictive Push and Last Mile Resupply&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current logistics approach in most NATO militaries is primarily a pull logistics system at tactical echelons. Units call for what they need, and the logisticians work out how to get it to them. Logisticians may well pre-position stores that they anticipate being needed, but this is usually driven by the manoeuvre formations’ planning process, with the logistics plan intended to enable the scheme of manoeuvre. The logisticians work under the manoeuvre forces for several reasons, but an important one is that the manoeuvre forces take the highest burden of the risk, and therefore the logistics troops are combat service support. Ultimately, UK doctrine stipulates that “sustainment is a means to an end. Sustainment should always support the mission”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future operating environment is one in which targeting logistics is likely to be systematic among advanced militaries, because of the disproportionate impact it has on the capacity of combat forces to operate. Moreover, rather than logistics troops being a high pay-off target of opportunity, militaries increasingly have the means to reach over one another and strike the tail. The result is that logisticians must be significantly more proactive in planning their movements. Consequently, movement will often be discontinuous from the wider scheme of manoeuvre. The caching of materiel rather than its handover is a good example of something that facilitates this transition. The logistics planners may also require the support of combat arms in some instances, to shape conditions for access. This is especially true of electronic warfare troops and air defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical enabler for moving to an efficient push model is data. If the distance between centralised supply depots and the front is extending, then the risk is that critical materiel cannot reach units in time. This requires the right volumes of the right things to be pushed forwards in anticipation of need. Historically, push systems have been robust but inefficient. However, accurate predictive modelling can drive efficiency, drawing on data on actual consumption under various conditions. Since the caches are containerised, there is also less of a cost if the materiel is not used. It can be left in the container and recovered later, although it may be necessary to deny some critical materiel if it is at risk of being overrun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combined arms element of the logistics plan becomes especially relevant in last mile resupply, from the caches to the sub-units. This will inevitably require movement along exposed GLOCs. The breakdown of company supplies to roughly four tactical vehicles allows for a small footprint to move rapidly along a GLOC. This ensures that only the most responsive fires are likely to prove a threat. UAVs, however, either directing artillery or striking themselves, are a major threat during this phase. The most effective means of reducing this threat are air defence engagements against larger UAVs and electronic protection against ISR and smaller strike UAVs. Navigational jamming is especially important, as even if an adversary gets a UAV over the convoy, it significantly complicates the accuracy of engagements. Disruption of navigation is not just applied against the UAV but also against the launcher, further corrupting the enemy kill chain. Jamming of control frequencies, meanwhile, is important for protection against terminally guided UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air defence assets are scarce, while electronic warfare capabilities risk causing considerable disruption to friendly C2 if they are not deconflicted with friendly activity. It is therefore very important that the mechanisms exist for logistics units to call upon and receive this support from the combat arms, which in turn requires the planning process to be responsive in processing these requests and applying appropriate control measures and deconfliction procedures. Support engineering, whether for mobility support or force protection, is another function that logisticians may need to call upon to expand their options. Here the deconfliction requirement is in capacity, rather than fratricide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further critical function is logistical reconnaissance. This enables proactive push logistics by identifying areas that are appropriate for caches, and enabling the preparation of optimal sites for receipt of caches. For example, if pushing into an industrial area, warehouses or other facilities with large spaces with overhead protection offer a great opportunity to disguise and conceal dispersed caches. Route access, vehicle clearances and what to do with what might already be in the warehouses all require information to plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning for the positioning of caches also provides an anticipated laydown that can be used by the joint force to plan protection of logistical supplies. The requirement here is not that each cache be allocated a cordon of troops, which would be prohibitively burdensome. Nevertheless, it does make sense for shipping containers containing ammunition to be kept under observation. This could be achieved by remotely rigging a camera and running the feed from it via cable to a hide position. Locking the container can also create a barrier to civilians tampering with the contents. Simply having troops with overwatch of the site, rather than ringing it, is sufficient in many environments. Of course, even having troops in overwatch would be onerous if it is a dedicated task. However, on a battlefield where reserves need to remain dispersed, logistical reconnaissance proves to be the basis to plan hiding positions for reserve troops, such that there is coincidental force protection for stores without driving concentration. A further function of this reconnaissance is that it provides information to identify points to which materiel might be recovered. Via these means, therefore, using digitised C2 to disperse logistics hubs, moving ambiguous loads, and taking a combined arms approach to resupply, it becomes possible to resupply the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-medical-support&quot;&gt;III. Medical Support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although some medical supplies require special handling, the provision of medical logistics forwards can be made robust through the wider techniques discussed in Chapter II. Medical support, however, entails a greater reverse logistical component; significant effort is expended treating casualties and then bringing them away from the frontline. Also, the adversary often sets the level of demand, at a time and location of choosing. This chapter considers necessary adaptations to medical support on the future battlefield. It focuses on discrete medical capabilities – rather than on those intrinsic to the fighting units – and looks in particular at additional pre-hospital care teams and forward Role 2 surgical capabilities, as these are likely to be most impacted by recent developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;prioritising-mobility-in-medical-capability&quot;&gt;Prioritising Mobility in Medical Capability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transparent battlefield will always expose a medical treatment facility (MTF). Even if the MTF itself can be hidden (for example, underground), the casualties flowing to and from it will always set a distinctive pattern; for example, researchers were able to map the first surge in Covid-19 medical attendances in Wuhan using satellite imagery of hospital car parks. They will also be highly visible in the electromagnetic spectrum, because of the C2 required to facilitate casualty movement and reach-back for specialist advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loss of an MTF will hugely complicate the demands placed on other support elements and will directly affect the psyche of the fighting force and the population at home, putting a state’s political will to the test. This combination of visibility and value makes healthcare a logical target. IHL aspired to mitigate this by making medical units non-combatant – taking them out of the fight and protecting them, in return for their duty to treat any and all who need it. Sadly, this protection is ineffective. Attacks on MTFs are commonplace; the WHO recorded 806 in 18 countries in the first 10 months of 2023. In some conflicts, MTF targeting appears to be state policy – most notably Syria, where 274 government-attributed attacks affected hospitals, compared with only one on a school in the same timeframe. Attacks on military medical facilities are rarely publicised in Ukraine, for reasons of operational security, but are nevertheless frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that hospitals will be found and targeted, the enemy imposes a critical decision on planners. Should they place medical facilities beyond the range of attack (and/or harden them to survive), or simply make them very difficult to target? With long-range precision fires, a static MTF can never be close enough to deliver life-saving interventions early and remain safe from attack, unless it is also protected. This concept is not new – underground hospitals were used during the First World War and are commonplace in parts of Syria and Ukraine. However, this brings additional constraints, dramatically reducing the number of feasible deployment sites and fixing the facility. Critically, while this approach protects the hospital, the rest of the network assumes proportionally greater risk; even if varying routes and timings, ambulances and resupply always end up at the same place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is already moving away from fixed canvas or opportunistic hard-standing for C2 nodes, “focus(ing) on mobility as the chief mechanism for survivability”. For Role 2 MTFs to achieve this level of mobility, they must either be smaller, limiting capacity, or subdivided, limiting efficiency. The size of vehicle required to enable truly mobile medical provision has historically been considered unfeasible. But with Boxer command vehicles (7.93 m long and 3 m wide) assessed as survivable on the battlefield, that assumption is no longer tenable. The total size (and hence capacity) of an MTF still presents challenges. A common Role 2 configuration contains: two resuscitation beds; one operating table; two intensive care beds; a ward area (up to 12 beds); as well as x-ray and laboratory equipment, and blood fridges. That significant footprint actually works in favour of the distributed model. Role 2s usually experience relatively little clinical activity. Mass is only required when demand for life-saving damage control resuscitation (DCR) peaks. A modular approach would allow smaller, dispersed units (each containing, for example, an operating table, an intensive care bed and a blood fridge) to move closer to likely points of demand. Modules would only come together and reconstitute mass when absolutely needed, for exactly as long as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highly mobile MTFs bring considerable advantages: they can move whenever there is a risk that they have been targeted; RVs with resupply or evacuation platforms can be different every time; they can easily be redeployed if reinforcement is needed elsewhere; they can operate far closer to the point of wounding, potentially increasing the pool of salvageable patients that can be reached; they can set up in a far wider range of locations; and they can always choose to fix in an ideal location (even a distant, underground, protected one) if that suits the operation, whereas a static hospital can never choose to move in anything approaching a relevant timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobility also brings considerable challenges, most notably the significant changes to TTPs that will be required to cope with movement and their reduced capacity, and the vast increase in coordination (and so communication) and logistical support to manage many moving parts. Perhaps most important, if it fails to move in time, a mobile MTF is much more likely to be destroyed. While dispersal will reduce the likelihood of a strike being mission-killing, it is unlikely to be hardened to the same degree as a static facility, and so there will be losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;adapting-ttps-to-enable-mobility&quot;&gt;Adapting TTPs to Enable Mobility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surgery cannot yet take place in the face of vibration and sudden movements. While a static facility can operate continuously, a mobile unit can only deliver care when stationary. That said, Defence Medical Services surgeons have confirmed that most DCR procedures could be tactically paused for 10 minutes, given five minutes’ notice to move, allowing doctors to “cross-clamp” major blood vessels and then secure safety harnesses. This would allow a targeted vehicle to rapidly relocate, then apply the brakes and continue the procedure. Clearly this would not meet the NHS standard of care – and will likely result in worse outcomes for some than if the operation was never interrupted – but on a battlefield, it offers the best balance of urgency and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment would need to be reconceptualised in tactical bounds, interspersed by very short-notice moves. This applies equally to tactical medical evacuation (MEDEVAC). In Ukraine, enemy air defence coverage means that patients must be transported by ground vehicles; terrain (and the time needed to cross it) becomes critical in determining what treatments can be undertaken and when. Delivery of care in ambulances moving on roads is difficult; over rough terrain it is impossible. The holy grail of “in-transit care”, which brought such improvements in survival in Afghanistan and Iraq, will at best be replaced with “interrupted transit care”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timelines must also be re-evaluated. For logistical enablers, MEDEVAC will compete with the forward movement of ammunition. Commanders will prioritise the latter, as ammunition scarcity will increase casualties through reduced suppression of the enemy, perhaps even leading to defeat of the force, whereas delayed evacuation of casualties will only impact the minority of salvageable wounded. This calculus, along with the practicalities of movement under fire, has at times pushed casualty evacuation in Ukraine to over 15 hours. While enhancements to Role 1 facilities and the continuing focus on prolonged field care will mitigate this problem somewhat, fundamentally, the force must either accept clearly preventable deaths, or move advanced care forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risking scarce medical expertise forwards will demand clarity on who these personnel are there to care for. The human body is remarkably robust and survives most injuries, even if care is significantly delayed – 99.2% of all UK armed forces personnel treated in the hospital at Camp Bastion survived. Sadly, some will die, regardless of the proximity and capability of medical services, as their injuries are simply too severe to recover from. Of all UK service personnel killed in action in Afghanistan, 87% died before reaching hospital – two-thirds within 10 minutes of injury. Even with the current pace of innovation, it is unlikely this figure will improve significantly in the foreseeable future, as access to the necessary advanced care inside that timeframe will rarely be feasible while in contact. The patients who will benefit from advanced medical care in this environment are those who will die if untreated but are “salvageable” given the right level of care (DCR) in the right timeframe. These patients hide among the 35% who were not killed immediately, but died in what is currently the pre-hospital stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long do they have to reach DCR? There is a 33% survival benefit if surgery is accessible within an hour, but the ideal timeframe is probably shorter; giving blood only improves survival within 36 minutes of injury. Experienced military pre-hospital doctors did not believe they could keep salvageable patients alive for two hours pending surgery. The inescapable conclusion is that salvageable patients need advanced pre-hospital care surgery, well within the first hour, not the two proposed in NATO doctrine when the medical system is under strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/W5pBJH1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Analysis of Time to Death for Those Killed in Action.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Stacey Webster et al., “Killed in Action (KIA): An Analysis of Military Personnel Who Died of Their Injuries Before Reaching a Definitive Medical Treatment Facility in Afghanistan”, BMJ Military Health (Vol. 167, 2021), pp. 84–88. Reproduced with permission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each DCR vehicle would probably only have space for one surgeon, an assistant and an anaesthetic practitioner. Single-surgeon teams always run the risk that they are the “wrong” specialist for a given problem; for example, an orthopaedic (limb) surgeon faced with an abdominal wound or a general (abdominal) surgeon treating an amputation of a limb could not typically deal with the injury completely within their normal scope of practice. But in Defence, both can be made competent in the immediate control of any bleeding, even if it is not in their specialist area. The “clamshell thoracotomy”, taught to all UK pre-hospital doctors (who are typically not surgeons at all) is one such technique. With minimal equipment, the practitioner opens the patient’s chest to access the heart and main blood vessels. Once the bleeding is controlled – on average 4.6 minutes later – they have bought some time for rendezvous with the ideal team to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These modules could operate in “pods”, with multiple surgical vehicles supported by a mobile intensive care ward (which could also undertake MEDEVAC). If patients need a larger or reconfigured team, the vehicles could come together for a short period, reorganise to provide the interventions needed and then disperse again. Fresh modules can be en route (bringing critical resupply) while full modules can MEDEVAC back to the next echelon of care. This would also build resilience in the event that a vehicle is hit; the remaining surgical and critical care capability will still endure, ready to be fully regenerated by vehicles moving from another area to support, or battle casualty replacements arriving. In the event of mass casualty incidents (MCI), multiple pods could converge on the affected areas, boosting medical cover at critical moments in a way that static facilities never could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ueukfab.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Patient Movement Towards Modular vs Traditional Role 2.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Containerising these modules allows them to be delivered by any platform “fitted for, rather than with”, enabling far greater transport flexibility. If an operation required them to take up a static position, they could be placed into dug-out scrapes or underground, dramatically increasing their protection. For concealment and deception they could be sited anywhere a container would not look out of place, such as a supermarket supply entrance, ready to be picked up and redeployed when needed. Two-operating table collapsible versions of such modules exist (within standard 6-m ISO-container dimensions). While these cannot contain patients while “collapsed”, they illustrate the feasibility of the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural state of the MTF should be dispersed over a kilometre or more, operating within 30 minutes of the units for which it is providing support, and either in motion or moving frequently (and able to change location immediately). If static, it should be hidden and/or protected. It can be in the vicinity of defences and enablers (excavators and so on), but dispersed enough to not draw fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;precision-triage-treatment-and-palliative-care&quot;&gt;Precision Triage, Treatment and Palliative Care&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This construct only provides the care necessary to save lives that would otherwise be lost. Most medical care falls outside that definition. Disease and non-battle injury will continue to be the predominant source of medical work (and thus logistical effort), as it has for centuries. In general, these risks are predictable and well understood, and force protection (while heavily reduced over the years) remains effective. In contrast, unpredictable demand will normally be driven by enemy action. The general threat of attack is predictable, but the timings and impact of attacks will be highly variable. Intelligent demand planning will enable more routine rather than emergent resupply, but as the enemy always has a say, the system will have to be ready for large and unexpected spikes. NATO modelling suggests high-tempo combat operations might reasonably result in 600 to 1,000 casualties per day, which anecdotally is close to the Ukrainian experience. In such MCI, the 50% or more triaged to the lowest urgency (“walking wounded”) have a survival rate of over 97%, even if care is delayed. Given that small, mobile surgical teams are extremely limited in their capacity, patients who do not need DCR cannot go to them, or they will be overwhelmed almost immediately. Three other treatment and evacuation pathways are therefore needed in parallel to DCR: treatment of minor injuries, returning the soldier to the fight; non-time-critical injuries that exceed the capability of Role 1 and so must move to high-capacity hospitals in the rear; and providing a comfortable, dignified death for those who will succumb regardless of treatment, without consuming resuscitation capacity that others need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To manage four treatment pathways, Role 1 must be empowered to triage patients accurately, putting patients into the correct pipeline as early as possible. While triage is easy in concept, it is very challenging in reality. The systems taught in NATO are designed for the lowest levels of medical provider. They are simple, but that constrains their accuracy. Because medical resources were abundant in recent conflicts, triage was optimised to be sensitive – trying not to miss someone who needs DCR. Sensitivity is bought at the cost of specificity; the ability to protect resources by not allocating them to people who do not need them. Current systems are around 60% sensitive and 70% specific; in a 100-patient incident with “classical” casualty distributions (where 10 need DCR, 20 can be delayed and 70 are walking wounded) these tools would send 12 patients to the Role 2. Unfortunately, six of those would be “over-triaged”, not needing DCR, but displacing six others who did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over-triage can be mitigated by forward deployment of enhanced pre-hospital care. Existing force structures allow for two such teams in every medical regiment, led by an emergency medicine (EM) doctor. Thus far their role has been poorly articulated and rarely exercised. EM doctors have vast trauma experience and are highly capable of selecting out the patients who need DCR. Typically, they operate around 90% sensitivity and 85% specificity; in the above scenario they would also have sent 12 patients to DCR, but nine of these would have needed it. With enhanced capabilities such as ultrasound they may well be even more accurate. This layer of precision triage must be applied as soon after injury as possible, which will require real-time sharing of video and physiological measurements. This will obviate the need for casualties to be physically concentrated at the Role 1 for triage to take place. Forward EM can also start DCR at Role 1 for those who need it (assuming the Role 2 is not able to access them directly, faster), and will increase the capacity of Role 1. Casualties who exceed the capabilities of a reinforced Role 1 but do not need DCR typically require only limited medical input in the forward areas. They need to move to the rear as soon as it is safe. In many cases this might be facilitated by remote advice and monitoring from the enhanced Role 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capacity of Role 1 to return soldiers to the fight must also be increased. At the moment, even relatively minor wounds (for example a 30 cm laceration) would normally move back to an Role 2/3 for management. Advances in pain relief; the ability to cleanse large and complex wounds; and the advent of smart dressings and splints, which could reduce pain, encourage healing and even warn of developing infection, may play pivotal roles in the rapid return to duty. Unfortunately, these areas are not privileged in terms of research funding. There should also be a focus on the “lowest capable provider” concept, artificially increasing the available workforce by protocolising treatments and innovating delivery mechanisms that make treatments safer and easier to administer, making them accessible to lower-trained personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palliation is a normal part of hospital medical care, but to be effective in war it needs to be firmly established at Role 1. It must be supported by effective training and development of protocols and equipment that allow patients to die in comfort and dignity, even in adverse and austere conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;digitising-medical-c2&quot;&gt;Digitising Medical C2&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes proposed above depend on data and effective C2. Mobile Role 2 and highly interconnected Role 1 telemedicine will come at huge cost in terms of bandwidth and assured communications. This will only get worse when commanders harvest the real-time information benefits of wearable devices (such as smart watches). If these become a normal part of the C2 architecture, it is inevitable that medics will take advantage of the ability to monitor the physiological state of the force. Closely linked to the problem of exponentially increasing information is the requirement for the medical C2 system to degrade gracefully in the face of electronic warfare. The system must assume that at times it will not be able to pass information freely, and so effective backup systems will be necessary. These challenges must not be taken on by Defence Medical Services alone, but rather must be rolled up into the similar and far larger problem faced by logistics as a whole. The capabilities and TTPs outlined above should improve the provision of medical support to deployed forces under modern battlefield conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iv-maintenance-recovery-and-repair&quot;&gt;IV. Maintenance, Recovery and Repair&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use vehicles and equipment in combat is to have them damaged. Furthermore, high pressure, heavy weights and sudden travel on uneven surfaces put stress through vehicles and systems that guarantees failures. This is inevitable, irrespective of how well-designed a platform is, with or without the enemy. When the effect of fire comes into play, especially during offensive manoeuvre, it is evident that vehicles will be damaged in large numbers. Being able to recover and repair these damaged vehicles is the difference between the force being able to sustain its operations and degrading rapidly, losing mobility and combat power. Decisive damage to enemy formations is often achieved when maintenance areas are overrun. This chapter, therefore, explores how maintenance and repair can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;digital-twins-and-predictive-maintenance&quot;&gt;Digital Twins and Predictive Maintenance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different approaches to maintaining complex systems around the world. The Soviet model was to track how long a system had been used and replace components at specified intervals. The assumption was that within a given period, some components would have become compromised, but the probability that enough components were damaged to impair the functioning of the device was acceptably low. This allowed for a systematic push logistics system for sustaining complex equipment like helicopters and electronic warfare platforms. NATO’s approach has largely been to continually check systems and repair them based on the identification of faults. This approach is maintenance intensive but allows for the fielding of more precise systems as the tolerances for a system where a proportion of parts are expected to fail are necessarily greater. The NATO system also requires spares to be called forward responsively when faults are discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of a digital twin has been pursued for some time. A digital twin is a digital representation of a system that accurately reflects how it is operating. The concept is becoming increasingly viable for two reasons. First, as platforms increasingly depend on software for their operation, the data they collect during operation on their own functioning is built in. It is not adding complex functionality, but exploiting what is already enabling the system to function. Second, as design has become digitised, files are also created against which the functioning of the system can be compared, so that digital twins can be calibrated at the point of manufacture. Comparison of the data received and the ideal performance characteristics can not only identify what exactly has broken but, as stress begins to move across a system to compensate for the irregular functioning of a component, detect that components are going to fail in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increased efficiency of predictive maintenance based on accurate mission data is best illustrated with helicopters. Using digital twins, Sikorsky has had the approved fatigue life of critical components in its helicopters extended by the Federal Aviation Authority by up to 75%, owing to the accumulation of precise data on fatigue over time compared with the assessed probable fatigue rate based on mathematical projections during the initial testing of the airframes. Using such models, it becomes possible to not only preserve functioning components for longer and reduce the time and tooling required in vulnerable positions to diagnose faults, but also to anticipate what may break, and thereby push forward and cache relevant spare parts before they must be changed. Digital twins therefore offer the opportunity to both reduce the forward logistics required by maintainers and to limit the footprint of those areas where vehicles are maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital twins require that maintainers can plug into the system and download its mission data for transmission to update the twin at periodic intervals. One problem is that this reduces the viability of modifying vehicles in ways that cannot be represented in the twin. If additional armour or armaments, for example, significantly alter the pattern of vibration or weight distribution, there is a risk that faults will appear when the system is operating normally. Furthermore, basic mechanical systems that lack internal monitoring will not be able to generate the data to support digital twins. For this, and a range of other reasons, digital twins will likely be prioritised for those systems that are highly software enabled, such as air defences, and for complex systems such as helicopters. Autonomous vehicles will also be prime candidates to follow this process. Many platforms – where the aim is to reduce their unit cost and to ruggedise their performance – will not have a digital twin nor the sensors to self-monitor. It is therefore important that while this capability is seized where it adds value, it is not pursued by militaries in a manner that drives spiralling complexity and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing an effective digital twin requires a different approach to intellectual property (IP) in contracting. During war, the adaptation of platforms must happen rapidly in response both to threat and to industrial pressures and supply chain disruption. If this adaptation cannot be paired with the digital twin, the system of predictive maintenance breaks down. However, if a company owns the digital twin, it essentially has a monopoly and a great deal of leverage in any adaptations to the platform. Militaries may argue that as they are buying the physical product they should also receive and own the digital product. The problem is that the digital product also necessarily contains IP that companies will wish to retain. The need to avoid being locked in to a single vendor must, therefore, be balanced against offering protection to companies’ IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;additive-manufacture-and-modularity&quot;&gt;Additive Manufacture and Modularity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With digital twins only relevant for a proportion of military systems, simpler mechanical systems and components can be repaired and maintained by other means, while similarly reducing the signature of facilities and the pattern of life caused by a constant flow of forward supply. The two most relevant methods are additive manufacturing and modular platform design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to hold large containerised 3D printers forwards means that mechanical parts can, as long as digitised drawings are available, be printed in response to need. Thus, if a vehicle suffers damage or a component fails, this can be reported and printed at the point of repair, with no need to hold large stocks of spares, locate them and transport them to the front. This reduces not only the movement of materiel but also the number of pieces of information that must be transmitted within the support system. There are issues with the longevity of 3D printed parts, and a risk that different heat treatment may displace stress to another part of a system, cascading damage. Advances in 3D printing will improve the fidelity of the parts, and often the longevity issue surpasses the anticipated life of the vehicle in combat, even if this is a sub-optimal approach for a fleet being maintained in peacetime. 3D printing does require raw materials to work. Raw materials can, however, be moved forwards more efficiently than finished parts. They generally pack more efficiently, and because a body of raw material can be turned into a wide range of parts, there is less wastage through the movement and stockpiling of parts that end up not being needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many vehicles today contain complex systems that are not likely to be 3D printed forwards. Although additive manufacture is being used to print circuitry into the body of systems, for example, this requires highly sophisticated machine tooling that would not be economical to push forwards. Thus, while mechanical components can be printed and replaced on systems, electronic subsystems likely cannot. As the sophistication of these components increases, the skills and tools required to repair them also increase. Rapidly, the maintenance system begins to suffer from workforce constraints. The efficiency of the maintenance system can, however, be greatly bolstered through modular design. For example, vehicles are increasingly carrying complex sensors, from electro-optical balls to radar. These can and will be damaged if the vehicle comes under fire. They are very precise components and the tolerances involved mean that these sensors are unlikely to be able to be printed. The vehicle is also likely to be uncompetitive without its sensors. However, if the vehicle has a hard-point interface for the sensor, with contact surfaces that transfer power and extract data from a sensor, the maintainer can simply remove the entire damaged sensor, replace it with a new sensor and send the damaged sensor rearwards for it to be repaired in a location where appropriate equipment and trained personnel can be safely based. Unlike medical support, time for these repairs is non-critical. Modularity also enables the change of the sensor payload over time, noting that this may require updates to the mission data files on the vehicle to be able to ingest and display different kinds of sensor data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The virtue of modular components in terms of the survivability of repair and maintenance is that they significantly reduce the time window during which maintainers are concentrated with the damaged vehicle. Rather than working on the platform, it becomes possible to simply approach it, remove the damaged modular part, replace it and withdraw with the damaged part. The standardisation of components, and in particular the hard-point interfaces, across a force can further facilitate this process, as it reduces the range of parts that must be held by the logistics system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deception-as-force-protection&quot;&gt;Deception as Force Protection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the reduced signature and increased tempo of repairs achievable through precise systems monitoring, predictive maintenance, additive manufacturing and modular design, many vehicles will need to receive attention for a protracted period and may also require equipment with a large footprint. Changing the engine on a large armoured vehicle, for example, likely requires a crane, and even once a power pack is replaced, it often takes time to confirm that wiring and other sub-systems are interfacing with the system properly. Cranes have a large signature. Many of the systems used by maintainers – additive manufacturing, for example – also rely on power, so there must be an electromagnetic spectrum signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is accepted that repair systems are critical for maintaining tempo, then having repair sites in the indirect fire zone is unavoidable. One of the best means of protecting these facilities is through deception, rather than concealment. One of the advantages that repair workshops have in this context is that they have some of the best decoys possible: actual vehicles that have either been battle damaged or cannibalised and are therefore now disposable. The difference between a damaged or destroyed vehicle and one that is damaged and awaiting repair is not analytically easy to determine. It is also possible for functional vehicles to conceal themselves as damaged. Since maintainers have the tools for moving vehicles, they can hide in the noise of battle damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these measures, however, there is a growing tendency for militaries to strike damaged vehicles to prevent their recovery. In many instances, vehicles can be more cheaply immobilised or damaged than destroyed, but once immobilised they can be economically destroyed when the battle allows. Again, deception is a key technique for preserving damaged vehicles from follow-up strikes. For example, the burning of tyres, or similar material, next to a damaged vehicle will product black smoke, which is almost always perceived as an indicator that the vehicle is on fire and will therefore suffer warping and other permanent damage from heat that will render it non-recoverable. This, and similar techniques like reporting the vehicle as destroyed over communications systems, can allow for damaged vehicles to remain in place for later recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with these techniques, recovery and repair workshops will likely be pushed back. It will also therefore be essential to find protection from overhead observation for key equipment such as cranes. The use of industrial buildings, for example, is ideal because it provides overhead cover, as well as being mainly empty space. Battle damage assessment through corrugated iron roofs, for example, is difficult. Energy provision, meanwhile, can partly be handled through burying generators or drawing from civilian infrastructure in depth. The problem with this approach, like field hospitals established in hardened infrastructure, is that it is not dynamically available for different axes. However, unlike casualties, vehicles do not deteriorate rapidly over time once damaged, so the extended timeline to reach maintenance is not a mission critical constraint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has assessed the challenges presented to tactical sustainment operations during high-intensity warfare. The paper posits that the capacity to find and strike throughout operational depth makes sustainment functions increasingly vulnerable. Past procedures, from centralising sustainment hubs for efficiency to consistent handover points between echelons, and the combat arms setting the demand for sustainment functions, all exacerbate the threat and thus the sustainability of the force. To mitigate these challenges, this paper has argued that clusters of technologies are allowing the expanded application of well-established principles, including dispersion, deception and convoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed adaptations to the sustainment of the force may make the force more resilient, but that does not mean that the planning assumptions with which combat arms plan and execute operations are unaffected. The volume of materiel that can be accumulated from dispersed caches, the duration of the window of opportunities to push or pull materiel along contested GLOCs, and the scale of operations at which genuine ambiguity is achieved all necessarily have significant implications for how the combat arms approach the expenditure and commitment of their units. Attempting to reach exact conclusions on these questions in this paper would be premature. It would require extensive wargaming and experimentation to produce a robust answer. However, several hypotheses as to the impact of contested logistics on combat arms activities can be suggested for further enquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One critical question is the impact of the system described upon the tempo of operations. Mobile medical capability should enable medical provision to keep pace with advancing forces. By contrast, the ability to achieve ambiguity of cargo and to disperse reduces dramatically as caches must follow an advancing force. It follows that even using these techniques, a force has a limit of advance before its logistics can be targeted and its momentum severed. The critical question, therefore, is how far combat arms assess that they can punch, and how wide a salient must be before ambiguity and dispersion of support functions can be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another critical question that arises for combat arms is the judgement of how much equipment can in fact be recovered. Once equipment is pulled back behind the FLOT, the techniques described in this paper may be able to obscure the repair process sufficiently to bring vehicles back into the fight. However, if recovering damaged vehicles proves non-viable, given the ability to cheaply and precisely deliver follow-up strikes, it may be that the proportion of equipment that is destroyed rather than damaged increases. If this is the case it may have profound implications for how vehicles are designed, for if it is not anticipated that they will be recovered and repaired, there will be a drive to minimise the number of specialist systems mounted on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the question of the tail’s tail. A Role 2 hospital that must constantly traverse rough terrain is going to have breakdowns and may need mobility support to cross certain obstacles. A logistics system premised on dispersing caches off road needs a high level of mobility, but will wear out vehicles. Dispersed forces also need greater organic firepower for force protection. There will be a point at which the logistics system is consuming too much materiel and is limiting the efficiency of the force. Finding the balance is critically important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of understanding how many logistics vehicles can be efficiently sustained and how many caches can be pushed into an area before the logistics system loses its protection gives an indication as to how much materiel can be held within a given area. This in turn determines the size of combat arms that can be supported for a given front. This is a vital equation, because it sets the force density that the combat arms must be optimised to deal with, and thus the levels of mutual support, lethality and ammunition consumption that the force can sustain. Getting this equation wrong risks having the force overmatched along the front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of these concluding observations is that far too often force development starts with the combat arms and then allocates sustainment resources based on their anticipated supply requirements. There is still merit to this process, but it is also important – now that sustainment functions are themselves directly threatened – to work in the other direction. Without calculating what size of forces can be sustained, over what distances and at what tempo, the risk is that armies try to build combined arms formations that lack stamina in the fight. Sustainment may be a means to an end rather than an end in itself, but if neglected, it will still lose a force a war.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華：黎智英指「勇武派令到個畫面唔靚」 冀聯絡領袖籲克制免失國際支持&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;陳梓華指登報團隊就去向有分歧 事後李宇軒和攬炒巴等人主導「重光團隊」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lio5E9Q.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（15日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第60日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他提及於2019年7月，在民主黨元老李柱銘的邀請之下出席飯局，並首次與黎智英見面。陳引述黎稱有需要聯絡他的話，可以透過 Mark Simon。黎又特別要求陳嘗試聯絡勇武派領袖，因為「呢啲勇武派令到個畫面唔靚」、「咁樣會失去國際支持，尤其係美國嘅支持」，所以希望與他們聯絡和對話，籲他們克制。惟陳稱難以聯絡勇武派領袖，所以後來坦白跟黎說「我聯絡唔到」。陳另提到，他在香港一個G20報紙展覽中墊支約3萬元，而 Mark Simon 願意贊助，後來便把相關款項歸還給他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第二天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒需使用蘋果新聞圖片-致電mark-simon獲告知已處理&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒需使用《蘋果》新聞圖片 致電Mark Simon獲告知已處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華供稱，在2019年6月G20峰會全球文宣登報行動之後，「攬炒團隊」籌辦第二次登報行動，因為當時「攬炒團隊」認為修訂逃犯條例削弱了香港的自由，亦違反了中英聯合聲明，所以希望透過登報來公開譴責中共違反中英聯合聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，李宇軒「當時佢有嘗試說服我入 group，但我好快拒絕咗」。後來2019年7月，李有找他幫忙，關於一張鄧小平當年簽署中英聯合聲明的新聞圖片，李指相片的版權屬於《蘋果日報》，惟陳不理解李為何要用這張相片。陳當時向李說：「如果唔急，我可以遲少少見黎智英嘅時候問吓」，惟李稱「好急」，所以陳致電黎智英的私人助手 Mark Simon，「然後 Mark Simon 話呢件事早就處理咗喇。」而且使用該相片不需要支付任何費用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱獲李柱銘邀請出席飯局-首次與黎智英親身見面&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱獲李柱銘邀請出席飯局 首次與黎智英親身見面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華上周提到他在2019年7月在中環文華東方酒店咖啡廳，與 Mark Simon 首次親身見面。陳今稱，該次會面之後，他在同月首次親身與黎智英見面。事前他獲李柱銘的邀請，「佢話有個 lunch appointment，會有黎智英，佢想我去參加，而嗰間餐廳係何俊仁細佬開嘅。」惟李柱銘並未有在通話中提及飯局的目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱他有赴約，當他到達餐廳包廂時，黎智英基於保安理由而要求陳交出手機，然後有一名餐廳職員收起他的手機。「當我開始嘗試介紹自己嘅時候，好快就畀黎智英打斷咗，佢話唔使介紹喇，佢話『Mark Simon 已經話畀我聽』，佢已經係咁𠵱查過我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述黎智英在飯局中的說話：「佢話如果我需要聯絡佢嘅話，可以透過 Mark Simon，因為 Mark Simon 會盡量協助同滿足我嘅訴求。」黎又指 Mark Simon 每日都會聯絡他，亦會向他匯報。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華黎智英稱勇武派令到個畫面唔靚失國際支持-冀聯絡他們籲克制&quot;&gt;陳梓華：黎智英稱「勇武派令到個畫面唔靚」、失國際支持 冀聯絡他們籲克制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指：「佢（黎）特別要求我，睇吓可唔可以聯絡到一啲勇武派嘅領袖，因為呢啲勇武派令到個畫面唔靚。」陳表示，以他當時的理解，有一些勇武派在反修例運動入面，在街頭上作出破壞，例如縱火及破壞公共設施等，而黎智英認為「咁樣會失去國際支持，尤其係美國嘅支持」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指黎提出一個「淨化計劃」，「就係聯絡到呢啲勇武派嘅領袖，令到佢哋克制」，又稱「年青人做唔到嘅嘢，利用佢傳媒嘅力量，就可以做到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指黎要求他提供勇武派領袖的聯絡方式，「然後睇吓大家可唔可以對話。」陳指，「因為當時佢（黎）相信，勇武派其實係有一個大台」，即是「一班示威者會聽從一小撮嘅人嘅指揮」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，當時在 Telegram 上有不同群組，而當中有部份群組是由勇武派開設的，所以黎智英相信陳可以聯絡到該些勇武派。陳當時回覆黎：「我會嘗試。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李柱銘有否在飯局中發言。陳指李有說：「試吓啲刺身。」法官杜麗冰聞言笑指：「所以這間是日本餐廳。」陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指聯絡勇武派有困難-後來坦白告知黎智英無法聯絡&quot;&gt;陳梓華指聯絡勇武派有困難 後來坦白告知黎智英無法聯絡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後再解釋，在 Telegram 群組入面，會有一些人自稱勇武派，同時有人自稱是做文宣的人，而勇武派會提出他們的主張，文宣人亦會提出他們的文宣、口號和關注點。在大多數情況之下，兩方的意見不會相反，因為「大家都係鬧緊政府」，但在一些極端情況發生時，「例如當時掟燃燒彈，但係掟咗落去自己人度，咁有啲和理非就會認為，如果係一啲和平嘅示威或者遊行，未必需要咁激進。但係有啲人就會覺得，唯有激進嘅手段，政府先會回應訴求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，他當時有嘗試去接觸勇武派，但是遇到困難，首先是「究竟我點樣去確定嗰個人係咪勇武」，第二是若然對方真的是勇武，「佢又點會同我講佢係勇武。」所以後來黎問陳有沒有可能聯絡到勇武派的時候，「我都坦白同佢講，我聯絡唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon贊助g20報紙展覽&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon贊助G20報紙展覽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，大約在2019年7月尾至8月的時候，Mark Simon 告知他，「佢同黎智英都想喺多個地方搞報紙展，咁就想我去搵嗰二十份報紙，佢有講到德國、紐約美國、台北。」就香港而言，陳亦協助舉辦了一個報紙展覽，並且墊支約3萬元，而 Mark Simon 表示願意贊助，後來便把相關款項歸還給他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指展覽會展出G20登報行動的報紙，目的是「Echo 番我哋當時嘅訴求，啫係反修例同五大訴求，同埋爭取國際關注」。陳指該展覽於2019年7月底，在港島的一幢唐樓舉行，主要搞手還有李宇軒和另一名網友。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指g20和攬炒團隊合作辦第三次眾籌李宇軒是領袖之一&quot;&gt;陳梓華指G20和「攬炒團隊」合作辦第三次眾籌、李宇軒是領袖之一&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，直至2019年8月，第一次登報的G20團隊和第二次登報的「攬炒團隊」合作，籌辦了第三次眾籌和登報行動，「想要求國際關注香港警暴嘅情況，同埋呼籲國際停止出售武器畀香港警察。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，G20團隊和「攬炒團隊」是次合作之後，就變成大家後來所知道的「Stand with Hong Kong（簡稱SWHK）」，所以 SWHK 的骨幹成員會由G20團隊和「攬炒團隊」的人去擔任，例如橫跨兩個團隊的李宇軒、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸，以及來自G20團隊的網民「家樂牌通心粉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指在第三次眾籌之中，李宇軒負責處理所有財政事務，「然後基本上佢就係G20加攬炒團隊嘅其中一個領袖，因為佢係好少數可以橫跨到兩個團隊嘅人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒欲找他代問mark-simon借用戶口收取眾籌款項&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒欲找他代問Mark Simon借用戶口收取眾籌款項&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，李當時致電給他，指無法收取眾籌款項，陳在查問下才得知他們有第三次眾籌，之後李稱需要一個銀行戶口來收取款項。陳詢問為何不能用李自己的銀行戶口，李則回答「佢個團隊唔想筆錢流返嚟香港，所以最好係一個美國嘅戶口」。陳表示，雖然李宇軒當時沒有明說，「但係我知道佢想我去問 Mark Simon 去提供呢個戶口，所以我就打電話畀 Mark Simon。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，據他當時所知，收取眾籌款項的過程「棘住咗喺程序上面」，眾籌平台「唔肯放筆錢，話要做 KYC（know your client）等等嘅情況」，他們想找一個人的銀行戶口來收取款項，於是 Mark Simon 便提供了他的戶口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，他當時致電 Mark Simon 講述眾籌主題和遇到的困難，對方一度問：「唔通佢哋冇其他途徑（支取眾籌款項）？」陳從李口中確認沒有其他途徑之後，便轉達給 Mark Simon，「然後 Mark Simon 就話好啦。」李其後傳送了電郵給陳，該電郵要求索取 Mark Simon 的銀行戶口及個人資料；陳把該電郵轉發給 Mark Simon，Mark Simon 回答問題之後，陳將 Mark Simon 的電郵轉發給李宇軒，要求二人直接聯絡，陳不知道後來事態發展如何。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;據陳所知，Mark Simon 幫忙接收眾籌款項，之後登報團隊成立了一個信託基金來保管該筆錢。對於信託基金誰人「話到事」，他當時理解李宇軒是其中之一，後來從李口中得知還有另一名叫「Surely」的網民，相信其真名是 Shirley Ho。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華mark-simon答應替第三次登報墊支-並建議增網上宣傳&quot;&gt;陳梓華：Mark Simon答應替第三次登報墊支 並建議增網上宣傳&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，陳指 Mark Simon 當時建議登報計劃可以增加網上宣傳，「佢話唔好再局限喺登實體嘅報紙，而係應該數碼化，應該喺網上做呢啲宣傳，同埋喺社交平台，佢有提到 Twitter。」陳又引述 Mark Simon 認為傳播度和受眾人數在網絡上是最多的，而非實體報紙。Mark Simon 亦有問他需否墊支，當時陳回答不需要，「但後來李宇軒又話需要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於是陳跟Mark Simon說李宇軒需要有人墊支，「Mark Simon 就話，咁上次嗰筆都未找，𠵱家又要再墊支」，因2019年6月G20峰會全球文宣登報計劃中，Mark Simon 及黎智英墊支了約150萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳隨即致電李查問：「第一次眾籌筆數做乜仲未找？」但李說他肯定已經還款，所以陳才知道李是把款項還給 Chartwell Holding Limited 的戶口。陳遂向李說：「一開始佢哋話（墊支限額）500萬嘛，咁嗰500萬未到，咁仲有350萬，咁李宇軒就話OKOK。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳之後回電 Mark Simon，告知對方李已還錢，「Mark Simon 就話，（款項）原來唔係去咗加拿大嗰邊（戶口），佢就一路 check 住加拿大嗰邊。」陳指 Mark Simon 其後答應墊支，叫他傳送發票，好像G20登報那樣做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華確認mark-simon及lais-hotel墊支六國報紙廣告費&quot;&gt;陳梓華確認Mark Simon及Lais Hotel墊支六國報紙廣告費&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示不同報館及媒體公司的電郵、發票和收據，就西班牙報紙《世界報》（El Mundo）的廣告費，匯款收據顯示 Lais Hotel Property Limited 在2019年8月16日支付了18,500歐元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《日經新聞》，發票顯示廣告費為2,040萬日圓（時值約147萬元）。陳指，當時登報團隊好想拿下8月19日的《日經新聞》廣告欄，當時「主要係『rip（李宇軒網名）』同我講，佢哋一定要攞到，咁但係又係 last minute」，於是陳聯絡 Mark Simon 從加拿大匯款。「但人哋日本人做嘢好嚴謹，你哋一定要畀咗錢先」，所以李宇軒便將147萬元的支票拿去《日經新聞》的辦公室，「佢當時話佢土下座咁囈（哀求）人哋」，希望對方先不要入該張支票，替他保留廣告版面，待對方收到加拿大的匯款之後便歸還該支票。但因為 Mark Simon 已經從加拿大匯款繳付廣告費，所以《日經新聞》一方同意，先收下李的支票，待他們收到 Mark Simon 的款項之後，便會退款給李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;英國媒體公司所發出的發票顯示《旗幟晚報》（Evening Standard）、《泰晤士報》（The Times）、《衛報》（The Guardian）、英國《時代》雜誌（Time）、The Week、City A.M.和《經濟學人》（Economist UK），合共7份報紙和雜誌的廣告費用合共約12萬英鎊。控方又展示匯款紀錄，陳確認 Mark Simon 預先支付了相關費用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另確認瑞典《每日工業報》（Dagens industri）、《每日新聞報》（Dagens Nyheter）、德國《法蘭克福匯報》（Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung）和南韓《京鄉新聞》的廣告費均由 Mark Simon 預先繳付，合共約65萬港元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（15日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第60日審訊。陳梓華繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他提及於2019年8月的第三次眾籌登報行動之後，G20團隊及「攬炒團隊」討論去向問題，惟「當時有好大分歧」，部份人認為應籌辦下一次登報，部份人則認為應舉辦其他類型的活動。而李宇軒則不贊成繼續登報，更一度退出群組，後來眾人決定不登報，而堅持登報的人便退出群組，留下來的人就慢慢變為大家所知道的「Stand with Hong Kong」（重光團隊，簡稱 SWHK）。陳指經過上述分道揚鑣之後，SWHK 漸漸由李宇軒和「攬炒巴」劉祖廸等少數人主導，並掌控信託基金「Project Hong Kong Trust」。陳另提到，Mark Simon 曾建議在美國國會山莊租用商務辦公室，以舉辦關於香港的展覽，或者做游說中心。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;已認罪的被告陳梓華第二天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒不同意繼續登報行動-曾提轉戰國際游說&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒不同意繼續登報行動 曾提轉戰國際游說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華供稱，2019年8月，G20團隊和「攬炒團隊」合作籌辦第三次眾籌和登報行動，由於 Mark Simon 曾經提議增加網上宣傳，不應再局限於實體報紙登廣告，因此事後陳與李宇軒討論是否繼續做登報行動。陳引述李形容：「登報紙好似放煙花咁，頭一次好好睇好犀利，第二次都仲OK，但再做落去就冇意思喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦記得李提過「係咪要做多啲國際游說嘅工作」，但因為陳當時專注於報紙展覽，所以當時二人的討論沒有結論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指團隊內部對未來路線現分歧-最終決定不再登報&quot;&gt;陳梓華指團隊內部對未來路線現分歧 最終決定不再登報&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提到，G20團隊及「攬炒團隊」亦有討論相關議題，惟「當時有好大分歧」。陳指，「其實當時呢，登報紙做得好好」，G20團隊包辦了眾籌、設計和排版工作，而「攬炒團隊」則根據地在英國，「當時俾到我嘅感覺係，佢哋想 ride on G20 有能力籌到錢同埋登報紙。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，第三次眾籌籌到約1,400萬元，差不多是原訂目標的兩倍，眾人考慮如何使用登報之後的700至800萬元餘款，「係咪全部攞晒嚟登報紙，定係好似 JD team（攬炒團隊）咁樣，可以做多啲唔同活動，例如請顧問公司呀，做啲集會呀，佢哋有好大嘅分歧。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指G20團隊以網名為「家樂牌通心粉」的成員為首；而李宇軒則代表「攬炒團隊」，「然後為咗唔再登報，佢就退出咗群組。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指：「佢（李）問我會唔會撐佢」，又指：「我當時畀佢拉咗入 group，跟住又 quit 咗 group，佢想畀到其他骨幹成員睇到，唔會再有一個 backer（墊支的人）喺個 group 入面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳表示，後來「我靜靜雞入咗返G20嗰邊」，「後來演變到就係，大家決定唔再登報紙喇，然後想登報紙嘅人就全部走晒，就連本身G20個群組都冇埋。」陳續指，留下來的人就慢慢變為大家所知道的「Stand with Hong Kong」（重光團隊，簡稱SWHK）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指swhk骨幹成員包括李宇軒和攬炒巴&quot;&gt;陳梓華指SWHK骨幹成員包括李宇軒和「攬炒巴」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，「經過呢件事之後，成個 Stand with Hong Kong 就基本上係『rip（李宇軒）』，同埋少數人話事咁囉。」他表示以他所理解，SWHK 骨幹成員包括李宇軒、「攬炒巴」劉祖廸、「Madison」、「Surely」（真名 Shirley Ho）和「Always」。惟他從來都不在團隊決策層（board）入面，所以不知道實際上有什麼人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提到，「攬炒團隊」的領袖固之然是「攬炒巴」劉祖廸，更重要的是其身邊有李宇軒、「Madison」和「Always」協助，所以他們的意見和立場基本上是一致。而「Surely」則原本是美國線的人，「但 Stand with Hong Kong 慢慢地由喺英國做好多嘢，到喺美國做好多嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他在上午作供時提到的信託基金「Project Hong Kong Trust」都是由 SWHK 的骨幹成員所控制。因此第三次眾籌餘下的700至800萬元如何使用，「就基本上好睇佢哋同唔同意去做嗰啲嘢喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另指，後來在2019年9月底至10月的時候，部份前G20團隊的人籌辦了另一次眾籌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指swhk正名是重光團隊-但可與攬炒團隊互換&quot;&gt;陳梓華指SWHK正名是「重光團隊」 但可與「攬炒團隊」互換&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問到，換言之，SWHK 是否被「攬炒團隊」主導？陳確認是，也因此後來 SWHK 會以「攬炒團隊」作為中文名稱。不過 SWHK 內部對於中文名稱有爭議，有的人希望繼續使用「攬炒團隊」，但所有人都同意用「重光團隊」。陳指後來也沒有使用到「攬炒團隊」這稱呼，「因為後來攬炒巴同 Stand with Hong Kong 都有啲鬧翻。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後陳指，SWHK 的正名是「重光團隊」，所以之後的眾籌計劃名為「重光計劃」，但是有時視乎負責聲明或文宣的人是團隊內哪些人，有時「攬炒團隊」的人負責活動或文宣，他們便會使用「攬炒團隊」來稱呼 SWHK。至少在2020年8月，大家會依然使用「攬炒團隊」這稱呼，陳表示：「我個人會話呢個係 interchangeable 嘅 term 囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳重提上星期證供，指某個活動中會出現很多 Telegram 的小組，「但 Stand with Hong Kong 會以線、國家嚟分組」，所以在第一次的G20登報行動中，會遍及13個國家和20份報紙，但去到第三次眾籌登報時，便沒有再在意大利報紙登廣告，但是新增了芬蘭和丹麥的報紙，「因為攬炒巴想開拓呢條北歐戰線，慢慢發展落嚟，美國線和英國線就主導咗成個 Stand with Hong Kong，因為佢哋最多人同埋最多 resources。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon提議租用美國國會山莊做香港展覽和游說中心&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon提議租用美國國會山莊做香港展覽和游說中心&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華上午提到，黎智英和 Mark Simon 希望在不同地區舉辦報紙展覽。他下午供稱，Mark Simon 曾催促他盡快提供G20的報紙和文宣海報，讓 Mark Simon 能夠在美國舉辦展覽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，在2019年8月一次 WhatsApp call 之中，Mark Simon 曾提議他和李宇軒「不如會唔會喺 Capitol Hill（美國國會山莊）去租嗰啲好似商務辦公室咁，hold 一啲展覽，或者做游說中心」，並稱「give a taste of Hong Kong」。當陳將相這提議告知李宇軒時，李說：「一早有人講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問 Mark Simon 口中的「游說中心」是關於什麼。陳則指 Mark 只提及一句而已，「因為當時我冇興趣。」至於「展覽」，則是關於反修例運動，想告訴別人香港發生什麼事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問二人有否跟進 Mark Simon 的提議。陳表示：「我印象中冇」，不過李宇軒提及過類似的概念，「佢係想喺全球都有一個咁樣嘅 Hong Kong Centre，但都唔係一啲好認真嘅討論嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒每次最後一刻才要求幫手-使mark-simon不滿&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒每次最後一刻才要求幫手 使Mark Simon不滿&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，Mark Simon 向陳梓華和李宇軒二人提議，是否代表當時 Mark Simon 已經認識李宇軒。陳則指在第一次登報行動的時候，發票和單據上已經出現李宇軒的名字；後來陳和李簽訂借據，Mark Simon 查問詳情時，陳已經提及過李這個人。至於李宇軒與 Mark Simon 親身見面，則是2019年9月二人同場會見美國議員 Rick Scott 的時候。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳另提到：「Mark Simon 脾氣都⋯⋯比較 grumpy（脾氣不好）」，說罷不禁發笑，「所以每次李宇軒都 last minute 咁去要求幫手，其實 Mark Simon 都好唔鍾意，嗰時都會聽吓佢發吓牢騷、講吓李宇軒」，但是 Mark Simon 對於李的能力評價很高。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華舉辦不同街站和展覽-黎智英資助14萬元&quot;&gt;陳梓華舉辦不同街站和展覽 黎智英資助14萬元&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱，他在2019年8月至10月頭持續舉辦街站和數個展覽，就G20的報紙展覽，「後來發現啲人根本唔識嗰啲語言，所以咁就冇意思」，於是他在街站展示多些別人製作的文宣，以及贊助更加多種類的文宣。他指街站和展覽的地點遍及大埔、深井、中環和台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到街站和展覽的活動經費是由誰人出資，陳指最後是 Mark Simon 把他曾墊支的款項歸還給他。控方遂展示陳的銀行戶口紀錄，顯示 Mark Simon 曾把3萬元存入陳的戶口；此外，另一張寫有黎智英名字的支票顯示，抬頭是陳梓華，金額為144,100港元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) currently performs a broad range of mission sets, with well-trained personnel who perform well when part of coalition operations. However, resources and personnel are spread very thinly across multiple small fleets with almost no capacity to absorb combat losses. Fleets also lack sufficient spares or ammunition stockpiles for sustained high-intensity operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February 2022, collective defence and deterrence through NATO has become a more urgent planning concern than overseas crisis management and support to national civilian authorities. This is because the Netherlands faces a dangerous European security environment. Russian military output has increased rapidly, the situation on the ground in Ukraine is deteriorating, and the US is increasingly militarily overstretched and politically fractured. Presidential candidate Donald Trump has also openly questioned US resolve to defend Europe against future Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For conventional deterrence, NATO depends on winning air superiority quickly. This enables relatively small but well-trained armies with close air support to conduct decisive manoeuvre warfare against Russian forces, while air forces conduct strikes on logistics, bases, command and control facilities, and other critical targets in depth. It is necessary because Russia’s ground forces can field far more land-based firepower and politically sustain much higher numbers of casualties for longer than European armies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Russia’s highly capable ground-based air defence system would deny air superiority unless NATO can rapidly locate, suppress and destroy Russian surface-to-air missile systems and radars at scale in the early weeks of any conflict. This task, known as suppression/destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD), is the highest priority shortfall identified by NATO Air Command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, only the US could carry out effective SEAD/DEAD operations against Russian air defences in Europe. Other NATO air forces lack suitable munitions, aircraft and training in the specialised tactics required. Thus, Europe is dangerously exposed if the US is unable (or unwilling) to come to its defence at scale – a real risk if Russian aggression coincides with a US–China standoff or conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNLAF should prioritise investment in its fighter force to help close this gap. The fighter force is the strongest comparative advantage that the Netherlands currently has. It is closer to being able to field credible SEAD/DEAD capabilities than any other European NATO air force, apart from potentially the Norwegian Air Force. The F-35A has the sensors and stealth capabilities required to conduct SEAD/DEAD effectively. The RNLAF also has excellent tactical DNA in terms of pilot training culture, aggressive operational mindset, familiarity with US tactics and a large fighter weapons instructor cadre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment is needed to realise this potential. The RNLAF currently struggles to fly the F-35 enough to maintain the good tactical fundamentals inherited from the F-16 fighter force. It also lacks sufficient stocks of weapons, especially missiles suitable for conducting SEAD/DEAD against Russian forces. Therefore, the Netherlands should allocate additional personnel and funding towards improving RNLAF fighter force maintenance capacity, flying hours for training, and weapons acquisition, even if this requires significant cuts elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons acquisitions and training for the F-35 should be prioritised around SEAD/DEAD to enable RNLAF aircrew to become specialists in this critical role. Investment here could provide an outsized contribution to NATO and do more to improve European security through deterrence against Russia than any other comparable uplift across other parts of the Dutch armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a force with a strong culture of interoperability with allies, the RNLAF should be well placed to coordinate with close European allies to identify mission sets where multinational specialisation can be pursued in a complementary way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If significant additional funding were made available, the RNLAF could also afford to uplift other areas such as missile defence for both national and NATO tasks. The main long-range threat to the Netherlands from Russia is cruise missiles due to range constraints on Russian ballistic systems. The NASAMS air defence system is highly effective against cruise missiles and significantly cheaper than Patriot, so is likely a more efficient way to protect key national assets than Patriot, which should be allocated to NATO missions where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another potentially very useful and efficient investment in the medium term would be to seek to acquire a small number of stealthy uncrewed ISR assets from the US in place of MQ-9 Reaper airframes, which are not suitable for operations in contested airspace. Penetrating ISR is one of the other key NATO bottlenecks where the only existing capability is American, and one where a small number of relatively efficient airframes could have an outsized effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the Netherlands may choose to look to space assets for critical ISR in heavily contested airspace. Here again, however, the US provides the overwhelming bulk of NATO capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report was produced as the primary output of a study requested and funded by the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The request from the Royal Netherlands Air Force was for an independent assessment by RUSI of the current strengths and weaknesses of Dutch air and space power, and for recommendations for how to optimise its contribution to the Dutch Joint Force and to wider NATO deterrence and warfighting capabilities. As such, there was no consultation with the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) on the content of the report itself, and RUSI retained all editorial control and oversight throughout the writing and peer review process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary evidence on which the report is based is several weeks of intensive interviews conducted by the author on multiple visits to the Netherlands. Units and bases visited included: the Air Force Headquarters in Breda; fighter squadrons and Air Combat Command in Volkel and Leeuwarden; helicopter units and the Helicopter Warfare Centre in Gilze-Rijen; a range of planning staffs and subject matter experts from all three services at the Ministry of Defence in The Hague; and the Air Mobility Force in Eindhoven. These interviews involved commanders and senior officers, planners and operators of multiple ranks, as well as civilian subject matter experts from across the RNLAF alongside a smaller number of focused interviews with officers from the Royal Netherlands Army and Navy. For wider contextual awareness, the author also drew on research visits to frontline squadrons and interviews with commanders in the UK, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Italy, Germany, Canada and the US during 2023 and early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusions are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the Dutch armed forces nor the Ministry of Defence of the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-strategic-context-and-imperatives&quot;&gt;I. Strategic Context and Imperatives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its 2022 Defence White Paper, the Netherlands committed to significant increases in defence spending, and to reinforcing and regenerating the operational capabilities of the armed forces. These ongoing reorganisation efforts have been prompted by a recognised need to respond to radical changes in the European security environment and the rising threat of a serious conflict directly involving NATO states in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine has resulted in two years of high-intensity warfare that shows no signs of abating. Ukraine has conducted a highly successful defensive war, but its summer counter-offensive in 2023 failed to achieve its objectives, according to Ukraine’s commander-in-chief General Valery Zaluzhny. In early 2024, Russia’s forces were increasingly better supplied with ammunition, new vehicles and weapons as a result of the Kremlin’s belated decision to mobilise the Russian economy for full-scale war production in late 2022. This trend looks set to increase, as Russia’s military budget for 2024 is a 68% increase over the already boosted amount that it spent in 2023, resulting in a projected spend of around 6.5% of GDP on the war effort. It has also diversified and increased its supply base by acquiring huge quantities of artillery and missile ammunition from Iran, North Korea, Belarus and Syria, including investing in new factories specifically to supply Russian contracts in those countries over the longer term. In other words, Russia has committed itself to fighting and winning a long war against Ukraine, and to long-term confrontation with the West, not simply at the political level but also increasingly through structural economic posture. At the same time, Western support to Ukraine is no longer being sustained at the level required for continued offensive progress. This is because NATO stockpiles have been badly depleted and sufficient European investment has not yet been made in defence industrial production capacity to match Russia’s preparations to fight and win a long war. Political splintering continues in the US, with support deliveries to Ukraine suspended due to a bitter impasse between the Republican and Democratic parties in Congress. Even more seriously, the re-election of Donald Trump in November 2024 is an entirely plausible prospect and could have dire implications for US support to not only Ukraine but also collective deterrence within NATO. In February 2024, Trump told a campaign rally in South Carolina that “if [a NATO country that had not spent 2% of GDP on defence] were attacked by Russia … no I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if a more pro-NATO and pro-Ukrainian president is elected in November 2024, the US faces a major challenge from China that is leading to an ever-greater proportion of American military capability and logistical support capacity being focused on the Indo-Pacific theatre. The serious and growing degree of US military overstretch means that if there is a conflict or serious armed stand-off between China and the US in the Indo-Pacific in the coming years, there will be very little American capacity to send large-scale reinforcements, ammunition resupply and logistical support to help European NATO members against any concurrent Russian military aggression. With Russian industry now on a war footing, supported by Chinese components and Iranian and North Korean production capacity, it will only be a few years before the Kremlin could credibly embark on a wider conflict in Europe if the US military cannot come to the rescue. This threat, which many European countries are belatedly waking up to, is the reason why the Netherlands and many other countries are urgently seeking to rebuild the warfighting capacity of their armed forces. In its 2022 White Paper, the Dutch Ministry of Defence states: “Europe needs to become more self-reliant. The countries of Europe, including the Netherlands, must therefore become stronger together”. Unfortunately, European armed forces have shrunk to a shadow of their former selves under the weight of decades of successive budget cuts and the specific but limited requirements of small counterinsurgency wars overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operationally credible and resilient airpower is essential for rapidly renewing European capacity to deter and, if necessary, defeat Russian aggression against NATO. Russia’s primary conventional military strengths are its ability to mass artillery firepower, armoured vehicles, electronic warfare systems and air defence systems on land against a given axis of advance. It has shown itself capable of fighting long, grinding wars of attrition, despite early setbacks, if initial aggression is not decisively repulsed. Ukraine has also demonstrated that Russian forces have a far greater tolerance for major casualties than Western forces – allowing them to take risks and accept costs that most Western democracies would find unacceptable, without being deterred from continuing offensive operations. Consequently, recruiting demographics, political constraints around conscription in many countries and industrial production capacity mean it is unlikely that European countries could develop the capacity to reliably repel future Russian aggression on land without air superiority. The entire Western military system is predicated on achieving air superiority at the start of any war. ISR capabilities and the raw firepower of massed tactical airpower are what has repeatedly enabled highly trained but relatively small land forces to achieve the sort of rapid battlefield victories over state opponents that would be needed to decisively repulse Russian aggression against NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia responded to the overwhelming battlefield success of this model, especially during the conventional phases of both Gulf Wars, by developing a very potent integrated air defence system (IADS) and electronic warfare capabilities to deny the West air superiority. The failure of the Russian VKS (Aerospace Forces) to achieve air superiority was critical to Russia’s failure to defeat Ukraine in 2022; in a future clash, European forces would be even more seriously handicapped by a similar failure against Russian forces due to having far less capacity to rely on massed firepower on land and lower casualty tolerance. Therefore, regenerating serious suppression and destruction of enemy air defences (SEAD/DEAD) capabilities among European NATO members is essential if the Alliance is to regain a viable joint warfighting credibility to deter and defeat future Russian aggression. Currently, almost all of NATO’s SEAD/DEAD capability is fielded by the US Air Force and US Navy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the VKS has proven distinctly underwhelming in Ukraine, with far less tactical and operational proficiency and inferior technical capabilities in the air-to-air domain compared with the major NATO air forces. Therefore, even without major US force involvement, Europe’s air forces could likely deal with Russia’s tactical airpower relatively easily if the SEAD/DEAD mission could be accomplished as a prerequisite. Russia can field potent long-range strike capabilities with cruise and ballistic missiles. However, the size of the salvos it can launch is limited in practice by the limited number of strategic bombers, naval assets and ground-based Iskander-M launchers. Once actually used in anger, NATO forces would target these launch platforms as a priority – including on their bases with stand-off weapons – and so Russia’s ability to sustain a long-term precision strike campaign against countries outside rocket-artillery range would also probably be more limited than its missile arsenal and production capacity would suggest at face value. In the naval domain, Russia’s submarines are a potent force, but the bulk of its surface fleet is ageing and unlikely to be able to project power at any distance against NATO forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this means that the most vital challenge for European NATO members is to regenerate SEAD/DEAD capabilities sufficient to hunt down and destroy a majority of forward-deployed Russian ground-based surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems in the first week or two of any incursions onto Alliance territory. If that can be accomplished, the rest of the Russian conventional military would likely struggle to prevent NATO establishing air superiority over the contested area. Air superiority, once established, would enable the traditional large-scale use of conventional fourth-generation fast jets, attack helicopters and UAVs to deliver an overwhelming air campaign against Russian forces in the contested area in support of NATO land and naval forces. Many Alliance member states maintain sizeable fleets of fourth-generation fast jets such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, Rafale, Gripen, Mirage 2000 and F-16, and attack helicopters such as the AH-64 Apache and Eurocopter Tiger. Many also have stockpiles of short-ranged but affordable direct attack munitions such as laser- and GPS-guided bombs and anti-tank missiles sufficient to destroy hundreds of Russian vehicles if they could be delivered effectively. Following decades of counterinsurgency and overseas intervention operations, most are also highly experienced in delivering this sort of direct attack firepower efficiently and accurately in close coordination with friendly ground forces. In other words, massed European tactical airpower in conjunction with NATO ground forces could devastate Russian ground forces in an actual clash, but only if a successful SEAD/DEAD campaign could be undertaken against Russia’s SAM systems first to enable non-stealthy fast jets and attack helicopters to sustainably operate in the contested area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The critical nature of the need for SEAD/DEAD to make conventional deterrence credible against Russia is well understood within NATO. The current head of NATO’s Allied Air Command (AIRCOM) General James Hecker has repeatedly stated in public that “counter-anti-access/area denial mission is [the] number-one priority, throughout NATO on the air side”. The most likely scenario in which Russia might risk direct military action against the territory of a NATO member state to discredit Article V and collective deterrence is one in which the US is perceived as either unwilling or unable to come to Europe’s defence at scale. Therefore, to ensure deterrence in such a scenario, European NATO air forces must be able to collectively conduct effective SEAD/DEAD operations against Russian ground-based air defences and follow up with potent battlefield close air support and interdiction strikes at scale without major US help. If they had the capabilities to credibly do so, Russia would be much less likely to risk a ground incursion into NATO territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the key question behind this report is what should the RNLAF do to maximise its relevance and credibility? The report focuses on this primarily through the lens of Dutch contributions to collective European defence because, as a small country, the Netherlands can only satisfactorily offset the growing threat from Russia collectively through NATO. The Dutch government recognised the critical nature of this task in signing the Vilnius Summit Communiqué in July 2023, which pledged to make the new NATO defence plans “the main driver for the organisation of our [national] forces and the specific military requirements NATO asks of them”. In view of this, this report focuses primarily on how the RNLAF can maximise the value it adds to Alliance deterrence and warfighting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-current-dutch-air-and-space-power-strengths-and-weaknesses&quot;&gt;II. Current Dutch Air and Space Power Strengths and Weaknesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many decades, the RNLAF has operated as a capable and well-respected small to medium-sized air force. It has primarily maintained its technological edge by purchasing aircraft, weapons and other key equipment off-the-shelf from the US, most notably its long-serving F-16 and new F-35 multi-role fighter fleets, along with CH-47 Chinook and AH-64 Apache heavy lift and attack helicopters. There are some exceptions, including medium helicopters, where the RNLAF operates the AS532 Cougar made by Airbus, primarily for missions alongside the army’s Air Mobile Brigade, and the NHIndustries NH90 in the maritime helicopter role for the navy. The RNLAF also jointly operates the Airbus A330 MRTT (multi-role tanker transport) as part of the Multinational MRTT Unit (MMU) and has ordered the Brazilian-made C-390 tactical transport aircraft to replace its four ageing C-130H-30 Hercules tactical transport aircraft. For combat aircraft, however, the RNLAF operates US types and has also generally sought to maintain commonality with US-operated versions of its platforms, relying on the US for software, sensor and weapons upgrades. The general policy of remaining in lockstep with US domestic upgrade programmes has allowed the Netherlands to benefit from consistent US investment in iterative capability development, which is on a different scale from other Western countries due to vast disparities in funding. As a result, RNLAF aircraft and weapons have remained relatively up to date throughout their service lives, with comparatively minimal investment required beyond normal foreign military sales acquisition and operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, the RNLAF has maintained a consistent approach of maximising interoperability with the US Air Force through alignment and integration of training, doctrine, and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). Dutch aircrew and maintainers for the F-16 and the F-35 are trained at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, and RNLAF fighter force doctrine and TTPs are based on the US Air Force’s Fighter Integration 3-1 standard. This ensures that they are generally able to integrate seamlessly into complex air operations (COMAOs) led by the US, alongside other NATO members. The RNLAF has long prioritised this seamless interoperability as a policy position – aiming to specialise as a “plug-in” air force for any US-led coalition due to common aircraft, TTPs, doctrine, weapons and training. In recent years, reliance on the US aircrew training pipeline and common doctrine has ensured that, despite difficulties with F-35 availability and flying hours in the Netherlands itself, new pilots are arriving from the “B-Course” at Luke Air Force Base sufficiently well trained to be close to combat-ready wingmen, and only requiring a small amount of supplementary training to reach that level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside to this approach is that the RNLAF is structurally and institutionally limited to being a tactical rather than an operational or strategic force. Training and recent operational experience have been geared around plugging into coalition air campaigns with a multinational air tasking order (ATO) produced and run by combined air operations centres in Uedem in Germany, Torrejón in Spain or Al Udeid in Qatar. These centres are staffed by thousands of American and NATO staff officers, including Dutch personnel, who have long been active and internationally valued participants. However, the lack of national operational-and strategic-level capacity does mean that the RNLAF, like most European air forces, is currently extremely dependent on the US for operational-level planning, targeting and command and control (C2) in order to perform effective combat operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key component of this dependency is in the vital but often overlooked area of targeting, for which the RNLAF uses standardised NATO doctrine, systems and procedures. Targeting is the process by which higher-level commanders’ aims are fused with intelligence and surveillance data about hostile activity in an area of operations to analyse potential targets in terms of importance and priority, and ultimately allocate weapons and aircraft sorties to attack them. In recent years, the RNLAF has made significant progress in generating a national capability to conduct what is known as advanced target development (ATD), which is a comparatively granular and late-stage part of the overall process. This means that the Netherlands now has a national capability to derive the extremely precise (Category 1) target location and elevation coordinates to enable the accurate delivery of standard precision-guided weapons. ATD also involves calculating the appropriate weapon(s) required to provide the necessary effects on targets and the optimal delivery profiles for a strike (weaponeering), and conducting collateral damage estimation and mitigation analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is no Dutch national intermediate target development (ITD) capability at present. This is the process prior to ATD through which intelligence and surveillance information on potential target points are combined and analysed. The aim of ITD is to produce target packs containing information such as relevant use by hostile forces, importance to wider campaign objectives, vulnerabilities, defences, and ultimately weighting that helps determine whether the target is a priority or not. This is vital to be able to develop a joint priority target list and then further refine that into an ATO, where targets and weapons are allocated to aircraft sorties and associated enablers like tankers are coordinated to ultimately deliver the strikes. This is a dependency shared by the majority of European air forces, exacerbated by widespread personnel shortages in key intelligence and staff officer trades, to which the RNLAF is not immune, having around a 20% deficit compared to its authorised personnel strength among most trades. What this means in practice is that the RNLAF would struggle to generate and execute a national air campaign, except one that relied solely on dynamic targeting at the discretion of aircrew against pre-authorised targets of opportunity. However, the RNLAF ATD cell represents a useful contribution to NATO air campaign planning and ATO production during ongoing operations, and one that is currently relatively unusual among comparably sized air forces in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In overall force structure terms, the RNLAF is essentially a broad but fragile structure that is heavily dependent on US support in terms of planning, C2 enablement, ammunition resupply, logistical support, tanker support and training capacity. The fighter fleet is far smaller than at any period in RNLAF history, and while it has a varied and relatively large rotary wing inventory for its size, the inventory of each individual type within the helicopter force is still very small. The RNLAF participates in shared multinational strategic airlift, airborne early warning and control systems (AWACS) and aerial refuelling forces via NATO, but has no ability to task these assets nationally. It has also acquired four MQ-9 Reaper armed unmanned aircraft, has plans to acquire four more primarily for naval support operations, and has a new satellite for initial R&amp;amp;D as part of nascent efforts to field space-based surveillance and monitoring capabilities with other European allies. The RNLAF also provides personnel for the Patriot air defence system that is operated by the Dutch army. Across a force of only 6,400 regular forces, 1,100 civilian workers and 750 reservists, and after decades of ever-shrinking budgets, maintaining this broad spread of capabilities has inevitably resulted in a force that is spread exceptionally thinly. There is no capacity to absorb significant combat losses, a very limited ability to plan operations or conduct detailed targeting at a national level, and Dutch forces have inadequate ammunition, spare parts, logistical support, missile defence cover, force protection capacity and training in key missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Dutch Ministry of Defence is to achieve its goals of rejuvenating the capacity of air and space power to play a meaningful role in the defence of the Netherlands and other NATO allies against Russia, it must be allowed to make major changes quickly and with a ruthless focus on the primary threat. In the absence of a transformative increase in defence spending, the RNLAF will need to choose certain key mission sets to invest in at the expense of cuts elsewhere. Such choices must be made in close coordination with other European allies to ensure that NATO’s collective defence capabilities are balanced and operationally credible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fighter-force&quot;&gt;Fighter Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable current strength of the RNLAF compared with most other European air forces is that it has so far maintained a very high average experience level among its frontline aircrew. The RNLAF places a disproportionately heavy emphasis on weapons instructor training compared with most NATO air forces, with 5–10 crews going through the RNLAF Weapons School every year. The school also trains weapons instructors across a wide range of role specialisation, including intelligence officers, MIM-104 Patriot air defence system operators, helicopter aircrew and air battle managers. This means that most RNLAF fighter squadrons currently have 2–3 fighter weapons instructors (FWIs) tasked specifically with optimising and delivering tactical training for other pilots, and many senior squadron, operations group and wing commanders at each base are also FWIs. For comparison, most RAF squadrons have a single equivalent qualified weapons instructor (QWI) performing the role, and even most US Air Force squadrons have a single dedicated “patch”, although in both cases one or two others still often remain part of the squadron or parent wing in other senior roles. This means that most Dutch FWIs are significantly less overworked than those in most NATO air forces, where burnout among weapons instructors is a significant retention issue for these key personnel. However, the resources required to maintain such a high output of FWIs in a comparatively small force constitute a significant drain in terms of instructor time, programmatic capacity and flying hours, resulting in a trade-off being consciously made to spend less of these resources on regular squadron personnel training. Nevertheless, the trade-off seems to be a good one, since the tactical DNA of the RNLAF fighter (and attack helicopter) aircrew communities is demonstrably excellent. Core skills and procedures are consistently performed to a high standard and are comparable to those found in the US Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many RNLAF fighter squadrons also have a high average level of overall pilot flying experience well in excess of 1,000 hours, which is also unusual in most NATO air forces. This unusually high experience level within the Dutch aircrew cadre is partly due to deliberate RNLAF HR policies which avoid incentivising pilots to take staff jobs for career progression until they have spent at least two three-year flying tours as Majors. Pilots, and also to a lesser extent intelligence personnel and air battle managers, also usually spend most of their careers until at least the rank of Major at the same base they were assigned to when they first completed basic training. This ensures a high degree of continuity that enhances on-the-job training and forges strong bonds and working relationships between different trades working at each location. However, it also reduces the flexibility of the RNLAF in terms of its ability to rapidly move people around between postings and bases to compensate for unexpected gaps or demand signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another contributing factor for specifically high average aircrew experience levels is a legacy of decades of relatively high annual flying hour totals on F-16 squadrons. Although this figure has declined significantly over the past 15 years, the remaining F-16 operator, 312 Squadron, maintained rates of between 160 and 200 flying hours per year in its final six months of operations before shutting down to convert to the F-35. However, the squadrons that have already converted to the F-35 have been flying far fewer hours, and well below NATO targets, at least when operating from their home bases. This means that as older, more experienced pilots retire or move to staff jobs, the new generation is not replacing them with nearly as much “banked” experience, and so the force is losing “crew-room experience” increasingly rapidly. Synthetic training in the simulator is a critical component of training for all F-35 operators, especially for high-threat missions where realistic tactics and threats cannot be easily or securely practised live in most training airspace. Tactics and emergency procedures can be practised efficiently in the simulator, and the Dutch training syllabus is predicated on a 60/40 live/synthetic flying training mix. However, there are core piloting, “G-fitness”, task and risk management skills, especially when operating close to limits in demanding mission sets, that can only be maintained by regular live flying. The serious decline in flying hours during the transition to the F-35 has had significant negative impacts on pilot morale, retention and mission readiness and skills, and has a number of contributing causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the availability issues are caused by difficulties that essentially amount to growing pains. First and foremost is the comparative lack of experience among maintenance personnel with the F-35 compared to the F-16, which the RNLAF has operated for almost 40 years. This not only results in comparable tasks often taking longer with the F-35 due to simple lack of familiarity, but also more seriously a lack of confidence among more senior maintenance personnel to judge potential impact or risk from comparatively minor issues or superficial damage to components. Consequently, there is a tendency to err on the side of caution and mandate corrective or preventative maintenance rather than certify a jet as airworthy/mission ready for minor issues with the F-35, whereas on the F-16 maintenance supervisors would have had sufficient experience and therefore confidence to “own the risk” of signing off on a sortie regardless. These issues are improving over time, but have a particularly heavy impact on squadrons in the initial few years of F-35 conversion and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another contributing difficulty has been the fact that the RNLAF has had to maintain full F-16 operational capability during the transition, rather than retiring the F-16 fleet once some of the F-35 order had arrived in country and concentrating all available fighter force resources on the F-35. This decision was made with the full knowledge that it would create significant challenges, due to the F-16’s nuclear dual-capable aircraft (DCA) role as part of the NATO Nuclear Sharing Arrangement. Because this is a NATO mission that the Netherlands performs alongside four other countries, the RNLAF determined that it had to maintain the F-16 DCA force until the nascent F-35 force had been established and trained to a sufficiently mature degree to take over the DCA role. The coming stand down of 312 Squadron as the final Dutch F-16 unit by October 2024, however, will free up significant additional maintenance capacity and funding for the F-35 fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequent delays in receiving the spare parts required for maintenance tasks and overhauls have also contributed to limiting RNLAF F-35 availability and, therefore, flying hours. There is a limit to the degree that the RNLAF can improve this issue itself, since, unlike most aircraft, it is generally not possible for F-35 users to pay more money to purchase larger national stockpiles of spares. Instead, the F-35 is part of a global user supply chain, in which parts are stored in depots around the world and are shipped to units according to when the predictive maintenance system forecasts that they will be needed – at least in theory. In practice, there have been significant shortages and delays throughout the global F-35 logistics network, meaning that aircraft have frequently been grounded for extended periods of time waiting for critical parts to be delivered. The US and Lockheed Martin have publicly committed to focusing on improving the spare parts supply situation for global users and significant improvement has been seen at the squadron level in the past 18 months. However, since the start of 2024, progress has been interrupted by a major uptick in the requirements of other F-35 partner nations for spares resupply for ongoing combat operations in the Middle East, which has had a noticeable effect on spares delivery delay rates for non-deployed units elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, when the RNLAF F-35 force has deployed on operations in Eastern Europe or to Norway, aircraft availability and flying output has consistently spiked due to receiving priority for spares resupply as a “deployed unit”, and given greater maintenance crew output when on operations overseas compared to at home. For the foreseeable future, however, a shortage of global spare parts remains one of the constraints for RNLAF F-35 availability when operating from home base, and one over which Dutch decision-makers have limited control. There is also a serious question around the impact on RNLAF spares resupply in the event of a major war – especially a concurrent Europe/Indo-Pacific crisis scenario – in which the US and many other F-35 operators globally will all suddenly need to fly combat operations at a far greater scale than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNLAF also currently does not have air-to-ground weapons that are suitable for high-intensity conflict in significant numbers beyond the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) glide weapon that provides a limited degree of stand-off strike capability against fixed targets from F-16s or F-35s. Even against fixed targets, the accuracy of the GBU-39 risks being significantly degraded in GPS-denied environments, which Russia has proven very capable of creating using electronic warfare effects in Ukraine and Kaliningrad. Efforts are underway in the Netherlands to acquire stand-off cruise missiles in the form of air-launched Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles, Extended Range (JASSM-ER) for the F-35 force and Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM) for Navy frigates and submarines. These, however, are expensive weapons that cannot be purchased in large quantities, making them best suited to attacking strategic or high-value fixed targets. The only dedicated weapon so far on order for SEAD/DEAD is the AGM-88G Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile, Extended Range (AARGM-ER) for internal carriage on F-35s. This will provide a significant capability to suppress and potentially also physically destroy modern ground-based air defence radars, but delivery in quantity is unlikely before the late 2020s due to demand for the weapon from the US and other export customers, such as Australia, Norway and Finland, significantly outstripping available stocks and immediate production capacity in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fighter-force-recommendations&quot;&gt;Fighter Force Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core recommendation of this report is that the Netherlands significantly increases the priority given to its fighter force as an overall component of its military air and space power, if necessary at the expense of uncomfortable force reductions elsewhere. The RNLAF is closer than almost any other non-US NATO air force to being able to field the kind of operationally credible SEAD/DEAD capabilities that are currently the most critical bottleneck in Alliance deterrence and warfighting capacity. The pilot training and squadron culture within the RNLAF fighter force, with a heavy emphasis on producing and maintaining a solid core of FWIs, means the competency and cultural building blocks are in place to produce world-class SEAD/DEAD F-35 crews capable of operating against the highest end threats that Russia fields. However, this will only be possible if the force is able to direct a much greater proportion of its available live flying and simulated flying time specifically to this mission set and if appropriate specialised weapons are purchased in significant quantities. The Netherlands now has the second-largest operational F-35 fleet in Europe; one that continues to grow thanks to the funded ambitions for a third operational squadron. Since the RNLAF did not defer F-35 acquisitions, as many NATO air forces did in past years due to in-year budgetary pressures, its planned fleet of 52 should be fully delivered by 2026, with options for six additional aircraft being explored. With two squadrons already operational, there is a lot of latent capability already in place which could be rapidly unlocked, as opposed to the outlook for many NATO F-35 customers who will be waiting several years for most of their aircraft deliveries and who will take years after that learning to maintain, operate and exploit its capabilities effectively. There are three key policy changes that could dramatically increase the RNLAF’s F-35 force capability and value for NATO in the short term:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;RNLAF operational training should be more focused, with prioritisation of the crucial SEAD/DEAD and offensive counter air (OCA) mission sets at the expense of close air support (CAS) in permissive environments, and tactical intercept (TI) missions. The RNLAF has a limited ability to increase live flying hours beyond a certain point within the constraints of the global F-35 spare parts supply chain and maintenance personnel numbers. Therefore, it is vital that RNLAF F-35 crews are allowed to focus the training time they do have on becoming highly capable at the most critical mission sets that most other NATO air forces cannot do, rather than trying to be at best adequate across the wide range of missions that the aircraft is technically capable of. The risk in terms of loss of CAS and TI capacity in the RNLAF F-35 force could be offset by greater strategic and operational integration with and reliance on nearby allies with much larger fourth-generation fast jet fleets such as Germany, France and Sweden. These air forces in turn could benefit from the RNLAF being much more capable in the key SEAD/DEAD mission since they and European NATO more widely lack the capacity to perform this key mission effectively. In other words, the RNLAF should pursue mission specialisation for the fighter force as part of a multinational European task-sharing approach to meeting NATO defence plan requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Additional funding should be urgently allocated to increase maintenance capacity for F-35 squadrons in terms of both uniformed maintainers and civilian contracted support. As already discussed, there are limitations in the Netherlands’ ability to purchase additional stockpiles of spare parts due to the way the global supply chain construct works for the F-35. However, additional maintenance personnel capacity on squadron would still significantly increase aircraft availability in many situations, and thus improve pilot flying hours, mission readiness, morale and retention. The more that the force can fly, the more combat power it represents and the greater return that the Netherlands and NATO as a whole get from the acquisition of these expensive aircraft. Operating them on a lean support budget is a false economy in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The RNLAF should increase the money allocated to urgently increasing weapon stockpile levels for key munitions in the OCA/DEAD mission sets for the F-35 force. Weapons deliveries and integration take years, so rapid orders are essential if the force is to be enabled in time to meet even a medium-term threat. Large orders are also publicly visible signals of intent to adversaries and allies alike due to foreign military scales and governmental oversight requirements, so they may positively affect deterrence calculations even before delivery. One option that might be worth exploring to help get around production bottlenecks in US-made weapons like AARGM-ER would be a rapid joint order of MBDA’s SPEAR 3 miniature DEAD cruise missile with the UK. A joint order would enable a reduction in per-weapon unit costs for both countries and potentially increase the priority allocated to the integration of SPEAR 3 into F-35 software update tranches by the US Joint Programme Office, allowing the weapon to be used on the frontline more quickly. Perhaps more importantly, a SPEAR 3 order would provide some potential redundancy against the risk that deliveries of AARGM-ER are delayed beyond the currently envisaged timelines due to US production being allocated to other customers as a result of unforeseen crises in the interim – something that has previously happened with US deliveries of spare parts and weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-and-missile-defence&quot;&gt;Air and Missile Defence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the two Dutch NASAMS batteries and three Patriot batteries are generally allocated to defending Dutch army formations on notional forward deployments, with the latter more conceptually focused on static defence in forward or domestic positions. There are ongoing policy debates between the armed services as to what assets should receive priority for limited defensive coverage capacity and also how often Dutch Patriot batteries should be temporarily allocated to NATO for use at SACEUR’s discretion to provide wider Alliance integrated air and missile defence capacity. Some favour static defence of key civilian infrastructure such as port facilities, cities and power stations, while others favour defence of key military bases and many with the army place greater conceptual priority on providing defensive cover to forward-deployed ground formations. There is certainly nowhere near enough capacity to meet all the competing demands, and allocation of missile defence capability in most countries historically tends to be driven by political demands rather than military advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current plans include an ongoing one-for-one replacement of the two remaining legacy NASAMS batteries with NASAMS II – an improved version with greater range using the AMRAAM-ER missile, the option to use cheaper AIM-9X missiles for short-range engagements, and improved datalink connectivity to allow it to share situational awareness across other parts of the force. There is also discussion of purchasing two additional NASAMS II batteries as part of increased national defence spending plans, which in theory would allow greater flexibility to both provide protection to key RNLAF bases while still providing cover to army formations when forward deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To increase the credibility of Dutch air power, especially the F-35 force as a potentially critical component of European NATO warfighting and deterrence capabilities, provision of at least limited air and missile defence coverage at the main fighter bases could have an outsized effect. The author’s recommendation is that the Netherlands integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) capacity should be prioritised towards maximising the deterrent effect that the joint force can have against Russian aggression rather than trying to reduce the damage to civilian targets in a war should deterrence fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A war between Russia and NATO is unlikely to start with massed missile strikes on European cities or other critical civilian infrastructure because such attacks would be directly counterproductive to Russia’s interest in preventing a unified, rapid and unambiguous political and military response by the whole Alliance to an Article V invocation. Instead, Russia would more likely try to use the threat of missile strikes on key military bases and command facilities lacking adequate IAMD coverage in order to deter key NATO countries from using military forces in the defence of an Eastern ally. Thus, the requirement for IAMD does not need to be to defend the whole of the Netherlands from the entire Russian missile arsenal – a plainly impossible task. Rather, it only needs to be sufficient to make key Dutch military bases and command facilities difficult enough targets to ensure that the Netherlands could not be easily deterred from using its military forces by the threat of a limited number of Russian missile strikes. Such strikes would necessarily be limited because in such a scenario Russia would have to threaten multiple European countries simultaneously to try to deter the Alliance as a whole from coming to the defence of a member state – thus reducing the number of missiles from its finite salvo capacity that it could use against any one country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian ballistic missile launch options are also limited for targets in the Netherlands itself due to the range from Russian territory being too great for Russian ground-based Iskander-M or older Tochka-U systems. Furthermore, once active hostilities broke out the airspace over the Baltic Sea would rapidly become prohibitively dangerous for crewed Russian Mig-31K, Su-34 or Tu-22M3 aircraft attempting to reach suitable launch altitudes and speeds to fire Kh-47M2 “Kinzhal” aero-ballistic missiles due to numerous NATO defensive combat air patrols by multiple Baltic-adjacent countries. The primary missile threat to the Netherlands, therefore, would come from air-launched Kh-101 and Kh-555 and naval 3M14 cruise missiles fired from the Arctic, where the bombers and submarines launching them would be relatively safe from interception. This would give significant warning time from other allies such as the UK and Norway as the missiles would need to travel several thousand kilometres at subsonic speeds before reaching the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the RNLAF develops the F-35 force to be a core component of European SEAD/DEAD capability, then the bases from which it operates would likely become a higher priority target for any threatened or actual Russian missile attack. Fortunately, NASAMS has already proven highly effective at intercepting even the most capable Russian cruise missiles in Ukraine, with a very high probability of kill per interceptor launched, allowing a single launcher and radar to destroy multiple incoming missiles from large salvoes arriving near-simultaneously at low altitudes. Thus, even a small NASAMS II battery with a single radar and a few launchers at both Volkel and Leeuwarden air bases would greatly increase the number of missiles that Russian targeteers would have to allocate from their limited salvo capacity to guarantee successful hits on any given target point on each base. RNLAF bases already feature significant numbers of Cold War-vintage hardened aircraft shelters, and there are more in a disused state that could be reactivated with limited investment, meaning that even successful precision hits would only destroy a single aircraft at most. Dispersal and hardening of spare parts storage and mission planning facilities on the bases could also significantly reduce vulnerability to Russian strikes. Consequently, if deployed as part of a coherent plan to harden the bases themselves, even minimally sized NASAMS defences could make RNLAF air bases very unattractive targets for the limited salvo weight Russia would be able to count on launching at the outset of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the RNLAF enables its F-35 force to perform the critical SEAD/DEAD mission effectively, it should be allocated high priority for NASAMS cover against Russian cruise missile strikes that might otherwise deter its use in a crisis or, worse, destroy it on the ground. The small size of the Royal Netherlands Army compared to Polish, Finnish or German counterparts also means that providing Patriot cover to national forces in a forward-deployed posture in Eastern Europe would likely have a limited effect on Russia’s calculations of European ability and willingness to fight a successful defensive war. The traditional Cold War task of defending major ports to allow large-scale US forces to arrive is also potentially less relevant in a context where the most likely scenario in which Russia might risk war with NATO is if the US is unable or unwilling to reinforce Europe at scale. In comparison, Dutch Patriot batteries could have a significantly greater deterrence-enhancing effect if assigned to SACEUR’s control in any conflict, where they would almost certainly be used to increase the defensive cover around NATO command centres and logistics hubs that are vital for all Alliance member states’ ability to coordinate and control operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;helicopter-fleets&quot;&gt;Helicopter Fleets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands has a significantly larger helicopter capacity than most comparably sized European air forces. This is for two primary reasons. First, because the army is currently organised around an air manoeuvre brigade alongside its armoured brigade. The air manoeuvre brigade conceptually and doctrinally depends on being inserted, resupplied, supported and, if necessary, extracted by composite squadrons of CH-47 Chinook heavy lift helicopters and AH-64 Apache helicopter gunships. Second, because the Netherlands – like many other NATO member states – has largely deployed its armed forces for counterinsurgency and overseas counterterrorism operations since the end of the Cold War. In these discretionary wars, where domestic political tolerance for friendly casualties was extremely low, and special forces operations played an outsized role, the most critical need for air capabilities was for specialised helicopter fleets to conduct rapid battlefield casualty evacuation, move small forces around large areas of security responsibility, and perform discreet insertion operations. The consequence was a major rebalancing of the RNLAF over time away from the Cold War focus on maintaining a large fighter fleet ready for high-intensity peer warfighting to building up helicopter and fixed-wing mobility fleets that were in heavy demand for those conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing war in Ukraine has illustrated that helicopters and fixed-wing mobility fleets can still be useful in high-intensity wars. The most important role they have played for the Ukrainian armed forces is rapidly transporting scarce anti-tank teams, man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS) teams, commanders and electronic warfare equipment to where they are needed most while staying behind the frontlines. However, when flown in frontline fire support, insertion or evacuation roles, both sides’ mobility and attack helicopters have suffered heavy losses. When helicopters have been used for penetrating operations beyond the frontlines, loss rates have been unsustainable, especially among assault forces on landing zones due to artillery fire, and among helicopters when ambushed by air defence assets during the return leg of penetrating sorties. This has led both sides to rapidly become more cautious with transport helicopters and to largely use attack helicopters for safer but inaccurate suppressive rocket barrage attacks from behind the lines. The exception is Russia’s successful employment of Ka-52 and Mi-28 attack helicopters with anti-tank guided missiles in a reactive, defensive role to contain Ukrainian penetrations of Russian frontlines with armoured vehicles during the unsuccessful 2023 summer offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that is clear from Ukraine is that helicopter operations will be seriously constrained close to the frontlines in any conflict against Russian forces by the layered threat of long-, medium- and short-ranged ground-based SAM systems, fighter patrols with long-range air-to-air missiles like the R-37M, and ground forces with large quantities of MANPADS and short-ranged anti-aircraft and counter-UAV systems. Consequently, traditional helicopter assault operations by air manoeuvre forces to seize objectives beyond enemy frontlines at scale appear highly unlikely to succeed or even be attempted in a NATO/Russia context. Even if assault forces could be successfully inserted onto an objective without prohibitive losses on route, they would likely suffer major casualties from Russian artillery on their drop zone and be impossible to resupply or extract once the element of surprise was lost. In any case, RNLAF helicopter lift capacity is not sufficient to insert the air manoeuvre brigade in a single lift, resulting in the need for repeated insertion waves to make the air assault concept work as traditionally envisaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, there is a debate within the army and the RNLAF helicopter force about the continued relevance of the air manoeuvre brigade concept for a NATO/Russia-centric primary defence task. Even advocates largely accept that the concept has to evolve away from air assault towards air mobility, with a much greater emphasis on moving light infantry into advantageous positions quickly either before active hostilities break out or behind/in the flanks of the main frontline areas. A policy recognition that air mobility and other warfighting tasks are not likely to involve crossing the frontlines en masse would, at least, reduce the mission-specific training and penetration aid requirements for the RNLAF’s Chinook force. It would also help free up capacity in the new AH-64E Apache fleet whose training focus is currently dominated by integrated operations with small formations, providing company- – or at most battalion level – CAS for the air manoeuvre brigade. The viability or lack thereof for traditional air assault operations in a NATO context matters as it is a very expensive capability to maintain and prevents personnel and resources being allocated to other priorities. Unpredictable deployment locations and high-readiness requirements mean that the Tier 1 composite helicopter squadron supporting the air manoeuvre brigade imposes more burdens on the RNLAF’s combat service support and combat support functions than F-35 deployments, which are generally to Allied air bases where partners also operate the aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many within the army are advocating for the purchase of several dozen Leopard 2 main battle tanks and a refocusing of the army’s warfighting output towards a heavy armoured brigade to fight as part of a German-led division in Eastern Europe. The Apache force has not traditionally been seen as a core part of the Dutch armoured brigade concept, and so the Army focusing on regenerating an armoured capability in this fashion at the expense of the post-Cold War emphasis on the air manoeuvre brigade should reduce systemic demand for integral Apache fire support at the tactical level. Instead, for example, the Apache force could train and practise deployments as a self-contained manoeuvre formation to rapidly deploy as a defensive anti-tank capability to bolster multinational NATO ground forces if a Russian attack was feared imminent. Russia’s success with significantly less capable Ka-52 and Mi-28 gunships against Ukrainian breakthrough attempts in summer 2023 suggests that if used defensively, forward-deployed RNLAF Apaches could play a valuable role containing breakthroughs by Russian armoured thrusts against NATO defence lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherlands also operates 19 relatively modern NH90 multirole medium helicopters from naval vessels. The NH90 has matured significantly following a difficult introduction into service around 10 years ago, but now provides good anti-submarine warfare capabilities, forward sensor options and ship-to-shore connector capacity from an expensive but relatively reliable airframe. Since these helicopters are central to the function of multiple weapons systems and mission capabilities of the navy’s frigates and support ships – especially anti-submarine warfare – they will need to continue to operate as they currently do regardless of other prioritisation decisions in the air and space power domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming a relatively continuous demand signal from the Dutch special operations forces (SOF), the 14 new H225M Caracal medium helicopters that have been purchased to replace the 12 AS532 Cougars are also likely to remain a requirement. However, the requirement for helicopter support capacity might be reduced if Dutch SOF capacity and training were to be refocused towards more covert collection and sabotage operations against Russian forces in Eastern Europe as opposed to counterinsurgency, stabilisation and partner force capacity-building deployments in the Middle East and Africa. Equally, however, the Ministry of Defence might choose to counterbalance an increasing focus on conventional deterrence in Europe by the regular Dutch armed forces by increasing SOF focus on out-of-area operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fixed-wing-mobility-and-isr&quot;&gt;Fixed-Wing Mobility and ISR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of fixed-wing mobility fleets, the RNLAF’s room to manoeuvre is limited as most of the major capability decisions have already been made. An ambition to replace the KC-10 tankers with two A-330 MRTTs morphed into Dutch participation in the multinational MRTT fleet, with the Netherlands contributing the crews, funding and support equivalence of two of the 10 that it operates. This model is significantly more cost efficient compared to multiple small national tanker fleets, but also limits the RNLAF’s ability to task them for national requirements, since the entire fleet comes under European Air Transport Command. The same goes for the Netherlands’ longstanding participation and deputy leadership of the NATO E-3A AWACS force, which is tasked by AIRCOM. Equally, the Netherlands can nominally draw on 500 hours of C-17 heavy lift capacity per year in return for the funding and personnel that it contributes to the multinational Heavy Airlift Wing based in Hungary, but does not have sole control of any one of the three aircraft. Thus, the RNLAF currently contributes slightly more to European collective fixed-wing aerial refuelling, AWACS and heavy lift capacity than it could afford to if it deployed national capabilities in these areas, but cannot easily or reliably task these assets in a crisis to support an RNLAF air operation without the agreement of other partner nations. This complicates operational defence planning since partner nations might have different political responses to the initial phases of Russian aggression and/or might also be competing for limited enabler capacity from these multinational fleets to support their own combat air contributions. It is particularly concerning for aerial refuelling tankers, where the Alliance faces a major deficit against requirements, such that pooled fleet capacity is constantly being requested well beyond its ability to support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNLAF is directly replacing its C-130H Hercules tactical transport fleet with four new Embraer C-390s, which should provide a similar lift capacity with higher transit speed and lower operating costs. However, the mobility force as a whole is currently both overtasked and struggling with a lack of policy direction on what the primary requirements are from the rest of the joint force in a NATO/defence of the Netherlands context. This makes it hard for its leadership to plan for an optimal configuration of fixed-wing mobility force capacity in a Russia-dominated threat environment. One option might be to order some of the C-390s fitted with the new L3Harris/Embraer “Agile Tanker” boom refuelling kit that is being developed to provide additional tanker capacity for the RNLAF fighter force. While a KC-390 would lack the capacity and range of the much larger A-330 MRTT, it could operate from smaller, more austere bases and provide additional refuelling capacity for national RNLAF fighter operations in Europe. Furthermore, it would provide a tanker option for any possible F-35 deployments required to reinforce the Dutch overseas territories of Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten, which are not covered by NATO’s collective defence agreements. However, unlike a podded probe-and-drogue refuelling kit for cargo aircraft like the C-390 and C-130, the boom refuelling conversion required to make a KC-390 able to refuel the RNLAF’s F-35As would likely entail major structural changes and the deletion of the rear ramp, which would prevent such modified aircraft from being used in the regular tactical transport role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNLAF has also purchased four MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft that are capable of conducting persistent ISTAR missions in permissive airspace, and can be armed with laser-guided bombs and Hellfire missiles. It has successfully trialled Reapers in the maritime support role in the Dutch Caribbean alongside the navy. The trials suggest that their potential surface search and surveillance capabilities would make them very useful in counter-smuggling and counter-piracy patrols in combination with surface vessels. Therefore, the navy has strongly supported a planned acquisition of an additional four MQ-9 airframes equipped with specialised communications relay pods and maritime radar pods for this role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the MQ-9 is a relatively expensive capability to run, despite its efficient airframe, due to the very large volume of ISR data that it produces and its long endurance. It requires a three-person crew to fly it remotely, with new crew shifts for every eight hours of flight, alongside remote physical launch, recovery, maintenance and servicing teams, and a large staff of intelligence personnel to conduct processing, exploitation and distribution of the data that it collects while in flight. This ironically makes the uncrewed MQ-9 more personnel intensive to operate than most crewed platforms, especially in overstretched intelligence analysis and communications specialisms. It is also not suitable for operations within range of modern air defence systems, due to a relatively large radar cross section, slow cruise speed, and its lack of agility and self-defence capabilities. This makes it unsuitable as a supporting ISTAR or CAS asset against Russian forces in a NATO context. Even in the period leading up to a conflict, it cannot be flown in regular civilian-controlled airspace, meaning that temporary corridors and military training airspace must be used to operate over European territory – limiting operational flexibility and responsiveness. Furthermore, the Netherlands’ strict interpretation of EU privacy laws imposes significant constraints on using the MQ-9 for training with ISR sensors over the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of the many competing demands for funding and scarce intelligence and support personnel across the RNLAF, the author recommends that the MQ-9 fleet be curtailed at four aircraft, but that the planned maritime search radar and communications relay pods be purchased and fitted to the existing four instead. This would provide the capacity for an MQ-9 orbit to support either maritime security operations in the Caribbean or provide efficient ISR and CAS capacity at a small scale to overseas operations in permissive airspace. While it would represent a loss in capacity in both mission sets, it would free up funding and more importantly personnel capacity for higher-priority warfighting tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, however, if a penetrating ISTAR capability were made available to purchase from the US – currently the only NATO operator of such capabilities – this would make an ideal replacement for the entire currently planned MQ-9s. A stealthy, uncrewed ISTAR platform would help fill a major European capability gap against Russian forces and would be extremely useful for SEAD/DEAD operations and deep strike targeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;space-capabilities&quot;&gt;Space Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RNLAF currently lacks national operational space assets, and as such is entirely dependent on NATO allies to provide vital space-based enablers such as satellite communications, precision navigation and timing information through GPS and orbital imagery and signals/electronic intelligence services. Most of these capabilities are provided by the US. The RNLAF space department is currently trying to use NATO regional plans and AIRCOM priorities to assess what the space capability requirements are across the joint force. In other words, the priority for the RNLAF space team is currently gap analysis of national and NATO space capabilities other than US ones. This is an essential first step before coherent requirements can be written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost and scope of most military space capabilities means that it goes without saying that the Netherlands cannot develop or field them alone. However, questions remain over which capabilities should be developed with NATO allies in multinational programmes, whether national development in some areas is required to gain access to suitable partner programmes, and what capabilities could be safely relied on as a service from commercial space providers. As part of this effort, the Netherlands has developed and launched an R&amp;amp;D electronic support measures payload into orbit, with plans underway to continue collaborative testing with a second and third payload with Norway in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that Dutch air power, as well as most of the rest of the joint force, especially the navy for communications support, has a very deep degree of operational dependency on the US and to some extent other NATO allies for critical space capabilities. However, it is difficult to see how even significant increases in investment in space capabilities within the RNLAF’s potential budget could meaningfully change that situation in any relevant timeframe. Therefore, continued reliance on NATO allies and small-scale participation where appropriate in collaborative European capability development programmes seems like the most pragmatic course of action. Understanding and mapping the areas of dependency is nevertheless critical for planning and risk management, so the current efforts to do so in the RNLAF should continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;noise&quot;&gt;Noise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High noise restrictions at all main operating bases in the Netherlands are worth mentioning as they directly impose major restrictions on flexible flying schedules and training for all RNLAF flying units. The political culture of the Netherlands places emphasis on public dialogue and consensus building. This means that noise complaints from residents in the vicinity of air bases – a common friction for almost all European air forces – has led to multiple rounds of noise restrictions being imposed on the RNLAF in the name of compromise. Over time, this has driven a steady ratcheting up of noise-restriction-related operational limitations, to the point that pilot and unit training requirements frequently cannot be met as flying is curtailed due to insufficient quotas of allowable take-offs and landings from their base. It is an indictment of the Dutch political system that when RNLAF fighters deploy to partner bases elsewhere in Europe, such as to Norway or Eastern Europe, their ability to fly and train rises significantly despite the added logistical pressures of temporary basing overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The noise restrictions have also almost totally negated a potentially major strong point of the Netherlands as a contributor to NATO air power credibility and resilience. Due to major force structure cuts since the end of the Cold War, the RNLAF has multiple air bases with significant excess capacity to temporarily host Allied units, including a large number of active and mothballed hardened aircraft shelters that provide good protection from missile and drone attacks. Key partners such as the US Air Force and the RAF are actively looking for suitable European bases to conduct regular short-term deployments as part of the Agile Combat Employment (ACE) concept, which aims to complicate Russian targeting by moving combat power more frequently than Russian targeting can match. In many ways, RNLAF bases such as Leeuwarden, Gilze-Rijen and Volkel are ideal ACE locations, since they are within range of the same North Sea training airspace used by squadrons based in the UK and have excellent facilities. However, the Netherlands’ NATO partners cannot use them as temporary deployment or training locations, as was done constantly during the Cold War, because this would use up noise quotas for take-offs and landings that are already insufficient for the Dutch units based there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These noise restrictions have been steadily imposed despite the fact that the RNLAF has fewer than half the aircraft and squadrons that it had in the 1990s and flies fewer hours per aircraft, so at each stage the actual levels of local noise were already lower than they had ever been. Such measures might have been understandable in an era when major military threats to European peace and security were considered a thing of the past but are manifestly inappropriate given the threats that the RNLAF now has to prepare to defend against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defence of the Netherlands, including its overseas territories in the Caribbean, and contributing to collective defence as part of NATO are the RNLAF’s first tasks. Compared with its traditional post-Cold War role of contributing technically capable but small and tactically focused force packages in US-led out-of-area operations, the task of ensuring deterrence against Russian aggression in Europe without major US support is far more challenging but also far more important. Support to out-of-area operations and to civil resilience and disaster relief in the Netherlands in peacetime are also important, but do not carry nearly the same stakes as a potential failure of collective defence in Europe against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its current form, the RNLAF is not well prepared for serious warfighting. Its mix of aircraft types, ground-based air defence assets and space capabilities are so broad that each capability is too small and lacks adequate stockpiles of ammunition, spare parts or reserves to replace losses in serious combat. Even with significantly increased funding announced in 2022, the Netherlands faces serious limitations in terms of demographics and programmatic capacity that limit the extent to which it can grow its overall force structure. Therefore, the only way to significantly increase the capability and operational credibility of Dutch forces in a relevant timeframe is to take hard choices to cut significant areas of capability to free up personnel, programmatic capacity and money to rebuild stockpiles, resilience and operational expertise in high-end missions in other areas. This is not a new idea. The 2022 Defence White Paper specifically stated that the Ministry of Defence of the Netherlands is committed to a path of driving an increase in specialisation among European countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Defence organisation has decided to make additional investments in those capabilities and qualities that our armed forces excel at and that add the most value to collective operations with our allies and partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, simply adding to existing capabilities while trying to preserve all air and space force elements cannot generate the required uplifts to rebuild serious combat capabilities. Therefore, the key question is what components of air and space power do the Netherlands armed forces excel at, and which would add the most value to collective NATO defence capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary aim of NATO policy in Europe must be to rapidly field sufficiently capable conventional forces to convince Russia’s leaders that they could not achieve a rapid seizure of NATO territory even if the US is unable or politically unwilling to provide rapid reinforcements. The invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was based on the Kremlin’s assumptions that regime change in Kyiv would be achieved quickly and with only a short period of active high-intensity fighting. History offers few examples of countries embarking on aggression where they think the resulting conflict will be long and painful, but plenty of examples of wars that have continued for years and caused vast damage before either an armistice is reached or one side is victorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is well aware of the devastating capabilities of Western tactical airpower and consequently has prioritised the development of a highly capable IADS and electronic warfare capabilities to deny traditional Western aircraft and enablers access to the skies over any contested territory. Thus, if European NATO members can regenerate the credible capability to rapidly locate, suppress and destroy the few hundred SAM systems and key radar sites that Russia relies on for its military effectiveness against Western forces, it is highly unlikely that Moscow would risk territorial aggression against a member state. The risk would simply be too high that European NATO members would respond with a SEAD/DEAD campaign that would rapidly expose Russian forces to devastating conventional air attacks in support of the land and maritime battles. Conversely, without such credible SEAD/DEAD capabilities, it is difficult to see how European armies could field and sustain sufficiently large land forces quickly enough to beat the Russians at their own game without air superiority. European political will to suffer the kind of casualties that such fighting would entail is also open to question and a strategy that relied on doing so might invite Russia to believe it could attack an Eastern ally without facing a unified defensive reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, the RNLAF has a potentially key role to play in European defence and deterrence. While there are many small to medium air forces in NATO, none can currently field credible SEAD/DEAD capabilities – leaving the Alliance totally dependent on the US for this key mission. SEAD/DEAD requires not only aircraft that can get close enough to hostile SAMs within a layered Russian IADS and perform effective weapon deliveries but also ones that can do so with a specialised sensor suite that allows them to rapidly and precisely locate and classify SAMs when they turn on their engagement radars. The F-35 was purpose designed for this role and the Netherlands already operates one of the largest fleets in Europe. Simply having a capable multirole aircraft does not translate to effective SEAD/DEAD capabilities without the appropriate weapons and regular focused training for aircrew, planners and C2 structures. On the aircrew front, the Netherlands is also closer than most countries in Europe to being able to meet the requirement. The RNLAF has one of the most tactically proficient and culturally aggressive aircrew cadres in Europe, who have maintained near-parity and total interoperability with US warfighting tactics and standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, because of limited F-35 flying hours, aircrew are currently unable to maintain the required high levels of tactical proficiency in SEAD/DEAD alongside the host of other multirole missions that they are trained and deployed to perform. If tasked with prioritising training for SEAD/DEAD, they could rapidly become highly tactically proficient at the mission set, despite available flying hours falling well below their planned levels. Given its comparative advantages in F-35 numbers, pilot culture and training mindset, the RNLAF should prioritise SEAD/DEAD as the primary mission for its fighter force. It should accept risk against other mission sets in terms of training time, weapons procurement and operational deployments, relying on close European allies to undertake a greater share of less demanding defensive counter-air, tactical intercept and CAS missions with their larger fleets of fourth-generation fast jets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure maximum benefit from such mission specialisation, the RNLAF should also prioritise increasing the maintenance support provision, targeting cell capacity and force protection assets for the F-35 squadrons, even though that would mean reducing support to other force elements. In terms of planning and targeting procedures, a greater reliance on developing lists of pre-authorised air defence targets of opportunity and training to dynamically find and attack them could also reduce reliance on the relatively slow targeting process within the NATO 72-hour ATO cycle. It would also reduce the seriousness of current reliance on the US for ISTAR and targeting capacity to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A political decision to relax some of the noise-related flying restrictions at RNLAF bases, which are far more restrictive than in other NATO countries, would also significantly improve the RNLAF aircrew’s ability to train effectively and to cooperate more closely with key Allied air forces. It would cost nothing in financial terms, and beyond having significant operational benefits would also be a useful demonstrative measure to show the Dutch public, NATO allies and Russia that the Netherlands is responding in concrete terms to the rapidly degrading security environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of weapons, additional redundancy and capacity in SEAD/DEAD – relevant capabilities should be prioritised. Options including the GBU-53/B Stormbreaker glide bomb and MBDA SPEAR 3 miniature cruise missile. Significant orders of these weapons would add depth to Dutch warfighting stocks and help mitigate the risk of delivery delays for the AGM-88G AARGM-ER that has already been ordered. There is also a strong argument for prioritising the allocation of limited NASAMS II batteries to protect the main F-35 bases from Russian cruise missile strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional priority would be the acquisition of a penetrating, survivable ISTAR capability to provide NATO forces with a non-US ability to detect, classify and designate high-value mobile targets inside Russian air defence system coverage. If such a capability could be acquired, it should be prioritised over the acquisition of MQ-9 Reaper, which is an efficient and useful ISTAR and strike platform, but only in permissive airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the uncertainty over the future utility and role of the air manoeuvre brigade, and the army’s desire to refocus on armoured warfare as part of a German-led division, reductions in helicopter capability could be justified if they enabled serious increases in fighter force SEAD/DEAD munitions stocks, aircraft maintenance and training quality. Assuming the Apache force is retained, it might be of most value to the Alliance and the Netherlands as a self-contained defensive anti-tank blunting force to defend forward-deployed Allied forces against Russian armour breakthroughs in the early phases of a conflict before Russian air defences can be attritted to a point where fixed-wing CAS can be employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritisation means cuts to a broad force structure to enable specialisation, in addition to increased overall investment. Only then can warfighting stocks, readiness and deterrence be rebuilt. A loss of capacity in secondary out-of-area counter-smuggling and counterterrorism missions is unlikely to have any potentially existential implications for deterrence or defence capabilities for the Netherlands and NATO. The inability to conduct SEAD/DEAD without the US does have such existential implications, and the RNLAF is closer than any other European air force to being able to do so effectively, if it can be properly resourced and focused. Therefore, it should prioritise this mission, enabling and defending the fighter force, and the enabling functions that allow it to be delivered. In so doing, the Netherlands could rapidly field a critical capability to address the most serious bottleneck in European defensive options against Russian aggression. This would represent perhaps the most efficient possible allocation of limited national resources from a self-defence and NATO deterrence perspective. It would also make the Netherlands an indispensable framework nation in any European military response to Russian aggression. Consequently, investing in credible SEAD/DEAD capability through the F-35 force could provide the Netherlands with outsized political influence in a way that no other potentially affordable conventional capability could achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（12日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第59日審訊。控方傳召另一名已認罪被告陳梓華以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。陳供稱，2019年6月G20峰會全球文宣登報計劃面對資金問題，在「公海群組」成員的提議下，陳經民主黨創黨主席李柱銘聯絡黎智英，希望黎可以借貸。在李的協助下，陳聯絡上黎的私人助手 Mark Simon，對方表示「呢個計劃好符合佢哋個政治主張」，希望可以令政府回應市民訴求，遂願意墊支500萬元，但事後一定要還款。Mark Simon 又稱黎智英「會願意提供 all kinds of help 去支持呢類型嘅文宣活動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒昨日完成了15日的作供，控方今傳召另一名已認罪被告陳梓華，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華出庭作供-學歷至碩士程度-任職律師樓&quot;&gt;陳梓華出庭作供 學歷至碩士程度 任職律師樓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳身穿灰色西裝、戴眼鏡，在3名懲教人員帶領下，循法庭特別通道進入庭內證人台就坐，並以非宗教儀式宣誓，其後開始作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳供稱他的英文名是 Wayland，大學時修讀法律，碩士課程則修讀中國法律，主要收入來源是在律師樓工作的薪金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦確認，他在2020年8月10日被警方以「協助罪犯」罪名拘捕，之後獲警方擔保。陳在2021年2月15日再次被捕，罪名是「勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」。至同年2月17日，陳被正式起訴「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」，被指與黎智英、Mark Simon 及「攬炒巴」劉祖廸等人串謀呼籲外國機構制裁香港特區及中國，另被控「串謀協助罪犯」。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，陳在2021年7月7日承認「勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全」罪，而「串謀協助罪犯」罪則留法庭存檔，不予起訴。陳確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指冀透過g20登報關注反修例運動-惟出現資金問題&quot;&gt;陳梓華指冀透過G20登報關注反修例運動 惟出現資金問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2019年的事件，控方問陳是否認識黎智英，陳表示：「我認識。」他並稱在2019年6月透過李柱銘聯絡黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當時他在一個關於G20峰會的 Telegram「公海群組」，見到一個叫「rip」的用戶聲稱需要資金去做全球文宣登報，然後陳私訊「rip」了解情況，「rip」便直接打電話給陳，「我聽到把聲係男聲」，因而知道對方是一名男性。陳指「rip」當時解釋，雖然眾籌已經達標，但是他無法立即取得該筆眾籌款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就G20登報計劃，陳指「佢係一個全球登報嘅一個計劃，趁住當時G20個峰會，就希望可以表達到當時反修例運動，同埋關注香港嘅情況」，又指「當時亦都想表達到，暫緩呢個逃犯修訂條例，唔等如撤回」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指後來知道用戶rip真實身份是李宇軒&quot;&gt;陳梓華指後來知道用戶「rip」真實身份是李宇軒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到他的 Telegram 用戶名稱是「T」，但一開始是使用「蜂蜜T奶」這名字。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「rip」，陳表示起初不知道這用戶的真實身份，直至大約2019年7月，他與「rip」簽過一份類似借據的協議，期間看過「rip」的身份證，所以知道他的身份是李宇軒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指公海群組有人提議經李柱銘聯絡黎智英-以解決資金問題&quot;&gt;陳梓華指「公海群組」有人提議經李柱銘聯絡黎智英 以解決資金問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，當時「公海群組」有過千或過萬人，其中有一個叫「Uncle Walkie」的用戶提議可以聯絡黎智英或其朋友去解決資金問題。陳看到訊息後，在群組入面問：「咁有冇人認識黎智英？」然後有人提議，如果沒有人認識黎的話，可以聯絡李柱銘，「因為眾所周知，佢兩個關係好好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，他便在群組中問：「咁有冇人識李柱銘呀？」然後有人把李柱銘的電話號碼傳送至群組。「當我見到個電話號碼，我以為嗰個人係搞笑，因為個電話號碼好特別，有六個字係一模一樣，然後我就大膽打電話過去，然後聯絡到李柱銘。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳稱，在電話中「我話我冒眛唐突咁打擾你，但係呢當時有一個G20嘅全球文宣登報計劃，個宗旨係想喺G20峰會度，表達到香港人嘅訴求」，但是眾籌計劃在程序上面，無法直接取得該筆款項，「所以我哋冇辦法按照當時所想嘅去俾到錢報章，去 hold 住啲版位，我哋需要一筆 bridge loan。」陳亦在電話中提及需要金額為300萬元，並稱這筆貸款一定會還，所以想看看李柱銘能否幫忙聯絡黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YO6VGMz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 李柱銘（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳憶述當時李柱銘在電話中表示明白，「但係我𠵱家唔得閒，我晏少少打返電話畀你。」後來李回電，要求陳再一次解釋為何需要貸款，因為按照李的理解，既然眾籌已經達標，理論上可以做到他們想做的事；陳遂向李解釋，「的而且確眾籌達標，但係眾籌平台 Gogetfund hold 住嗰筆錢，未能夠馬上就俾到我哋。」陳指李聽罷表示明白，「佢話佢會聯絡黎智英。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指李柱銘其後回電，指中「黎智英已經知道呢件事喇，但係佢唔喺香港，所以我可以搵佢個助手 Mark Simon，直接同 Mark Simon 對話。」陳引述李指：「但係初步聽落去，黎智英係 OK 呢件事（借貸）。」李傳送了 Mark Simon 的電話號碼給陳，之後陳「幾乎馬上」聯絡 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華引述黎智英助手mark-simon稱g20登報計劃符合其政治主張-故會聯絡老闆&quot;&gt;陳梓華引述黎智英助手Mark Simon稱G20登報計劃符合其政治主張 故會聯絡老闆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指聯絡到 Mark Simon 之後，「我將我哋遇到嘅困難去話俾佢聽，然後我哋需要呢個 bridge loan 去完成 G20 之前可以登到報紙。」陳轉述 Mark Simon 指，他大概知道這件事情，而陳並非第一個就此事聯絡他的人，「但我表達得比較清楚，所以佢願意同我合作。」陳又引述 Mark Simon 的說話：「佢話呢個計劃好符合佢哋個政治主張，佢都希望呢個計劃可以令政府回應市民訴求」，他聲稱會「同佢老細聯絡」，惟 Mark Simon 並沒未有在該次通話中提及其政治主張是什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，相隔10至15分鐘之後，Mark Simon 再次來電，「佢話呢個 bridge loan 冇問題，佢願意墊支500萬，但係要還。」陳理解當時 Mark Simon 所指的500萬元是限額，不能再多。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華mark-simon稱黎智英會願意提供任何形式協助&quot;&gt;陳梓華：Mark Simon稱黎智英會願意提供任何形式協助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，Mark Simon 有否在電話中提及其老闆。陳則指：「當時佢話 Jimmy 會願意提供 all kinds of help 去支持呢類型嘅文宣活動。」而以陳所理解，Jimmy 即是黎智英。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦引述 Mark Simon 說：「呢一筆錢唔可以經我哋任何人手，佢希望個方式係，當啲報章去出一個invoice 嘅時候，然後佢去直接付款畀呢啲報章。」Mark Simon 又說，如果他們想在《蘋果》旗下報章登廣告的話，「係可以先行登報，然後再付款。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華告知李宇軒資金問題解決-並承諾若有需要可以再聯絡黎智英同mark-simon&quot;&gt;陳梓華告知李宇軒資金問題解決 並承諾若有需要「可以再聯絡黎智英同Mark Simon」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他與 Mark Simon 通話之後，同日便透過 Telegram 聯絡李宇軒，告知「蘋果黎智英嗰邊願意墊支500萬」，並叫李將報館的廣告費發票電郵給他們「找數」。陳形容李「當初一開始唔相信呢件事，然後我再同佢講，我好確定我哋可以做到」，他並向李表示「若然你之後喺文宣國際線上面需要幫忙嘅話，我可以再聯絡黎智英同 Mark Simon」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，李聽罷之後，「佢當時好興奮，話要搞咗啲報紙先，然後就大家開始處理喺邊啲地區國家登報紙。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，為何陳當時特別聯絡網名「rip」的李宇軒，而不是其他人。陳表示，因為見到「rip」有權限把訊息置頂，因此相信「rip」當時是「群主」。加上當時他較早前就財務事宜聯絡過「rip」，相信「rip」負責財政，所以才會聯絡「rip」而不是其他人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒在登報計劃中是資助者及協調者&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒在登報計劃中是資助者及協調者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就陳梓華在登報計劃之中的角色，陳稱自己負責協調報館發票和收據的往來，就《衛報》、《華盛頓郵報》、兩間法國報紙及一份意大利報紙，李宇軒會將發票電郵給他，他會將之轉發給 Mark Simon，其後當 Mark Simon 繳付款項之後，就會將收據傳送給陳，然後陳轉發給李。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於其他報紙的發票和收據，陳並沒有收到，他當時知道李宇軒會收到所有報館的發票，而李會繳付廣告費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就李宇軒的角色，陳表示以他的認知，李在「高登」或「連登」討論區得知G20全球登報計劃，當李參與眾籌計劃時，李負責選擇使用哪一個眾籌平台，然後將收款人設定為自己；當他們確定在哪些報紙登報的時候，李便用自己的錢繳付廣告費。因此陳認為李的角色除了是一個資助者（funder）之外，還是一個匯總、協調者，「去將唔同報章嘅內容，最尾擺埋一齊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;兩公司墊支部份廣告費-mark-simon事後提供還款戶口資料-稱都係屬於佢老細&quot;&gt;兩公司墊支部份廣告費 Mark Simon事後提供還款戶口資料 稱都係「屬於佢老細」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方在庭上展示不同報館的發票和匯款紀錄，顯示《華盛頓郵報》的廣告費用是85,050美元，由 Lais Hotel Property Limited 代表李宇軒繳付。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;《衛報》發出的收據顯示 Lais Hotel Property Limited 代表李宇軒支付了18,000英鎊廣告費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就意大利《晚郵報》（Corriere Della Sera）的廣告費，匯豐銀行的付款紀錄顯示，力高顧問有限公司（Dico Consultants Limited）代表李宇軒支付2萬元歐羅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問陳，當時 Mark Simon 有否提及 Lais Hotel Property Limited 和力高顧問有限公司的事。陳則回答當時沒有，但之後在2019年7月，第一次與 Mark Simon 見面的時候，對方則有提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就歸還墊支款項事宜，陳指他在2019年7月與 Mark Simon 見面時，從對方手上接過單據和3個用以還款的戶口資料，然後轉交給李宇軒。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指3個戶口分別是加拿大、香港和台灣的戶口，當時 Mark Simon 跟他說：「希望、如果可以，可以 send 返啲錢去加拿大，但若然方便你哋，你哋揀任何一個戶口都可以，因為3個戶口都係屬於佢老細。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（12日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第59日審訊。控方傳召另一名已認罪被告陳梓華以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。陳供稱，在2019年6月籌辦G20峰會全球文宣登報計劃期間，他與李宇軒首次親身見面，他問李為何願意墊支400萬元，李當時回應：「為咗香港，都一定要咁做，就算按咗層樓，佢都會咁做。」同年7月，陳與 Mark Simon 首次親身見面，對方「大讚」登報文宣，表示非常滿意成果和效果。Mark Simon 又提議舉辦展覽以延續G20登報的影響力，若果符合他與黎智英的政治理念，「佢哋願意提供經濟上、人脈上，同埋傳媒方面嘅協助。」Mark Simon 亦提到「國際上面嘅 lobbying」，惟陳「當時對 lobbying 冇乜認知」，所以僅向對方說會嘗試參與報紙展覽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒昨日完成了15日的作供，控方今傳召另一名已認罪被告陳梓華，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華問李宇軒為何墊支巨額-李稱為咗香港都一定要咁做&quot;&gt;陳梓華問李宇軒為何墊支巨額 李稱「為咗香港，都一定要咁做」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華上午提到，2019年6月G20峰會全球文宣登報計劃遇到資金問題，故他嘗試經李柱銘聯絡黎智英，後來聯絡上黎的私人助手 Mark Simon。Mark Simon 稱他及黎願意墊支500萬元，惟事後須要還款。最終 Mark Simon 及黎一方墊支了約150萬元，其餘廣告費則由李宇軒墊支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有關陳梓華與李宇軒第一次見面，陳指在籌辦G20登報期間，即2019年6月25至29日之間，二人在金鐘親身見面，「嗰次係純粹大家見個面，我問佢點解要佢自己墊支嗰筆錢」，因為據陳所知，李差不多要墊支400萬元，然後黎智英一方要墊支約200萬元，但是李當時回應：「為咗香港，都一定要咁做，就算按咗層樓，佢都會咁做。」此外，陳確認在該次見面中，有把一些匯款通知書交給李。惟陳當時並未知道李宇軒的真名。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華g20後詢問李宇軒還款安排惟李唔應機-遂要求簽借據&quot;&gt;陳梓華：G20後詢問李宇軒還款安排惟李「唔應機」 遂要求簽借據&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，G20登報計劃在13個國家、20份報紙刊登廣告之後，他便開始問李宇軒是否已經成功收到眾籌款項，「但佢一直都唔應機，於是乎我就喺群組入面問咗幾個網友點算。」陳指其中一個網友提議陳和李之間簽署借據，「令佢（李）個人承擔返嗰150萬元。」陳表示：「我認為呢種做法，係無論對 Mark Simon 定黎智英，定抑或係G20本身，都係負責任嘅做法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他準備好借據之後便打電話給李宇軒，打了數次後李才接電話，他向李解釋情況，「因為阿 Mark 都話有人問過嗰筆錢幾時會返番去、有冇時間表，但李宇軒乜都冇覆。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;於是陳相約李到金鐘力寶中心見面，並在哪裡與李共同簽署一份借據。陳指同場有兩名見證人，皆是群組入面的網友，而簽署好的借據由兩名見證人保管。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指借據上並沒有規定還款日期，只是提及李宇軒向代表 Mark Simon 的陳梓華借錢，欠款約150萬元。該次是陳和李第二次見面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指李宇軒獲得還款戶口號碼後-便稱已還款-不需利息&quot;&gt;陳梓華指李宇軒獲得還款戶口號碼後 便稱已還款 不需利息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，在簽署借據當日的晚上，他與 Mark Simon 透過 WhatsApp call 通話，陳向對方稱，「李宇軒係願意個人去承擔呢筆債務，所以佢唔會拖數。」陳又解釋，因為 Mark Simon 提供了3個還款戶口，分別是加拿大、台灣和香港的戶口，所以李不知道如何還錢，究竟是一次過還錢，還是分別還去3個戶口。Mark Simon 則稱會稍後回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，大概在7月底，Mark Simon 回覆他，指李可以還款去任何一個戶口，但最好是一筆過地還款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問 Mark Simon 有否提及該3個戶口的持有人是誰。陳引述 Mark Simon 指3個戶口「都係佢老細」，但是沒有提及戶口持有人是誰，換言之 Mark Simon 實際上只提供了3個戶口號碼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，他其後把 Mark Simon 的說話及3個還款戶口號碼轉述給李宇軒，數天之後，李宇軒「佢就話佢找咗筆錢喇」。控方問該筆貸款是否有利息，陳則指沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華mark-simon和黎智英滿意g20登報效果-並稱可就展覽提供協助&quot;&gt;陳梓華：Mark Simon和黎智英滿意G20登報效果 並稱可就展覽提供協助&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳梓華提到他與 Mark Simon 於2019年7月首次親身見面，當日在中環文華酒店的咖啡廳，同場還有 Mark Simon 的兒子，「係一個細路仔嚟嘅，然後 Mark Simon 就話呢個係佢個仔。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指二人會合後，Mark Simon 介紹自己為黎智英的助手，「咁佢就 basically 執行佢個 boss 嘅order。」陳續指，「佢（Mark Simon）首先大讚G20全球登報文宣，佢哋好滿意，佢話佢哋非常滿意個成果同效果。」而陳指「佢哋」是代表黎智英和 Mark Simon。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳引述 Mark Simon 稱：「佢認為未來嘅文宣方向，應該係延續返G20登報嘅影響力。」Mark Simon 舉例指可舉辦展覽，「因為佢話，並唔係人人都會睇報紙，若然我哋可以喺呢方面做多啲，亦都符合佢哋嘅政治理念，佢哋願意提供經濟上、人脈上，同埋傳媒方面嘅協助。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問當時 Mark Simon 有否談及其政治理念是什麼。陳指 Mark Simon 沒有特別講到政治理念，「但佢有幾次強調『民主』呢個單字。」此外，在該次會面中，Mark Simon 把一個棕色信封交給他，內含G20廣告費的發票和收據，以及3個還款戶口的資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱開離岸公司戶口有困難-mark-simon稱可幫忙當係個獎勵俾自己&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱開離岸公司戶口有困難 Mark Simon稱可幫忙、「當係個獎勵俾自己」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，Mark Simon 有問他未來想做什麼，陳當時稱有朋友想邀請他一起做生意，「其實我鍾意做生意多啲」，然後他談論了想做什麼類型的生意。Mark Simon 一度問陳是否遇到什麼困難，陳則指好難在香港開設到一間離岸公司的銀行戶口。Mark Simon 則稱「應該唔難」，並表示「其實我可以幫到你，你就當係個獎勵畀自己」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華指mark-simon有提及國際游說-惟當時對國際游說沒有認知&quot;&gt;陳梓華指Mark Simon有提及國際游說 惟當時對國際游說沒有認知&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指 Mark Simon 還有問他會否繼續參與文宣工作，陳當時回答「我會繼續」。Mark Simon 有談及本土的文宣工作，也有談及「國際上面嘅 lobbying」。陳表示，「但我當時對 lobbying 冇乜認知，所以我就同佢講，我會嘗試參與更加多喺報紙展覽。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問 Mark Simon 口中的「國際上 lobbying」是指什麼。陳則表示當時不清楚。被問到游說的目的，陳指是爭取「五大訴求」，即要求政府撤回逃犯條例修訂、推翻612暴動定性及承諾不檢控被捕人士、成立獨立調查委員會調查警暴，以及落實雙普選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華視李宇軒為攬炒團隊一員&quot;&gt;陳梓華視李宇軒為「攬炒團隊」一員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指，2019年6月之後，由「攬炒巴」劉祖廸帶領的「攬炒團隊」籌辦另一次登報行動，但主題與G20不同，因G20是關於反修例和「五大訴求」，但是「攬炒團隊」的登報行動則是關於中英聯合聲明，「希望英國政府可以履行佢哋道德責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳提到當時有大量「公海群組」，目的是聚集更多志同道合的人，俗稱「圈人」，至於實際工作則不是在「公海」討論，而是有另外一些非公開小組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;以陳的理解，李宇軒是「攬炒團隊」成員之一，因為當時李告訴陳，「攬炒團隊」需要有人幫手做眾籌，「我當時嘅理解係佢又想搵人墊支」，然後陳跟李說「你去做啦」，因他相信「攬炒團隊」需要一個有經驗、做過眾籌的人，而李有足夠能力協助他們處理。陳不記得李當時怎樣回覆，「但係我哋下次對話嘅時候，佢已經喺攬炒團隊入面做緊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一（4月15日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 5 March 2024 – just days after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine entered its third year – the head of Russia’s State Space Cooperation Roscosmos, Yuri Borisov, announced plans for Russia and China to build an automated nuclear power plant on the Moon between 2033 and 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is not the first joint Sino-Russian venture into the final frontier – indeed, the plant’s stated purpose is to power the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) that Russia and China introduced in 2021 – its announcement further indicates that Moscow and Beijing intend to more brazenly cooperate in space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-the-stars-with-nuclear&quot;&gt;To the Stars, with Nuclear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borisov’s announcement came on the heels of rumours the month prior about Russia’s intention to put a nuclear weapon into orbit – a claim denied by Russian President Vladimir Putin but that nonetheless elicited blowback and concern from officials in Washington and further afield, given the potential catastrophic consequences and international legal ramifications (in particular, for the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty) for the potential nuclear weaponisation of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the use of nuclear weapons in space would violate a flurry of international treaties, as well as physically degrade the environment it is used in, the use of nuclear power in space is not outside the bounds of international law. For example, like their contemporaries at NASA and the European Space Agency, Roscosmos and the China National Space Administration (CNSA) are funding research into nuclear power for space travel, which would drastically reduce transit times and the associated health risks of prolonged radiation exposure for astronauts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As governments seek not only to go further, but to stay longer, in space, broader applications for nuclear technology are emerging. Challenges arise about the logistical challenges facing more permanent presences on the Moon – among them the consistent supply of energy to operate stations and bases for astronauts. Solar panels, which have sufficed for smaller-scale operations such as lunar rovers and are often the energy source of choice for space assets, would not be as efficient for larger and more permanent activities on the Moon, where the sun cycle means that “night” lasts a little over two weeks on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;By positioning itself with China, Russia is sending a further clear signal of stepping away from Western initiatives&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise, then, that space agencies are also considering nuclear power as an energy source for lunar bases. In 2022, China was reportedly considering a nuclear energy source for its base on the Moon’s south pole. Similarly, NASA is developing a Fission Surface Power Project for operation on the Moon that would be available to other space agency partners, and the UK Space Agency recently awarded Rolls-Royce research funding for an eventual lunar nuclear reactor. Although specific timelines vary, each lunar nuclear reactor plan – including the joint China–Russia one envisaged by Borisov – anticipates completion by the mid-2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That completion deadline is, of course, subject to everything running smoothly – something which even Borisov seemed to acknowledge in his remarks, mentioning that the power plant would need to be constructed by robots and that Russia (and, presumably, China) have yet to develop the materials capable of withstanding the intense heat generated by the nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sino-russo-ambitions-in-space&quot;&gt;Sino-Russo Ambitions in Space&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the proposition of a nuclear power plant on the Moon is not revelatory, neither is cooperation between Russia and China in space more broadly. The space partnership between Russia and China gained traction in 2014 and gradually grew over the next seven years, ultimately leading to the ILRS announcement in early March 2021 – potentially in response to the unveiling of NASA’s Artemis programme, which prioritises multinational collaboration and intends to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2025, with a continuous presence by 2028. This project is a continuation of this wider partnership and leverages the comparative advantages of both Moscow and Beijing. Russia’s nuclear expertise surpasses that of China, while China – despite its shorter history as a spacefaring country – has more to offer in space, especially in terms of funding. In 2023, the CNSA allocated $14.15 billion for space programmes (a nearly 19% increase from $11.17 billion in 2022), while Russia only allocated $3.41 billion (a slight decrease from $3.42 billion in 2022).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia does not just need the extra money however – the status that is conferred on Russia by being one of the original space powers has more to do with its legacy than the reality of its current capabilities. The renewed sanctions, also specifically targeting the aerospace sector, in 2022 have added to Russia’s long list of problems in space. Simply put, if Moscow wants to continue to be a significant player in space, as it has been as a partner aboard the International Space Station (ISS), it needs to find a strong partner. This goes especially for costly and long-term projects such as lunar bases. By positioning itself with China, Russia is sending a further clear signal of stepping away from Western initiatives. The baseline requirement for this collaboration is a willingness to work alongside each other – something that China appeared to distance itself from immediately following the invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-course-change&quot;&gt;China’s Course Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just under one year after the signing of the memorandum of understanding on the ILRS, Russia commenced its illegal invasion and occupation of Ukrainian sovereign territory, drawing ire, condemnation and swift retribution from the international community. In response, China appeared to quickly distance itself from its northern neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Space has never been an apolitical place and the hardened political lines that can be observed on Earth are also clearly visible there&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the September 2022 International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Paris, China kept quiet about Russian involvement in its space projects, with a session run by the CNSA framing the ILRS as an extension of previous Chinese space exploration initiatives. Following the 2022 IAC, China continued to downplay or outright omit its space partnership with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Borisov’s public announcement of his country’s ambitious collaboration with China in the next decade was made without the implicit approval of the Chinese government, it would likely not bode well for future cooperation. So, assuming that was not the case, his statements may indicate that China is increasingly committed to publicly associating with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-russia-a-disruptive-business-partner-for-china&quot;&gt;Is Russia a Disruptive Business Partner for China?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although China’s implicit consent to the announcement of a joint lunar nuclear plant with Russia is not a radical policy pivot – the Chinese government has yet to make a direct announcement about the initiative, and tensions between Russia and China on myriad other issues still remain – it indicates an increasingly likely future where interstellar cooperation is mired in polarised geopolitics. This is an especially pivotal moment, given the worries that emerged over Russian plans of a nuclear weapon in space. China, which has developed its space capabilities rapidly over the past few decades, could be set to lose a lot should such a weapon be deployed. In this case, China may be calculating to keep a disruptive Russia close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, this apparent renewal of earlier Sino-Soviet space cooperation reveals Russia’s intention to more closely align with China in space travel and exploration, and China’s willingness to embrace its role as an emerging centre of space pioneering. The soft power element of this development should not be overlooked. China will soon be the only country with a continuous human presence in orbit through its Tiangong space station, as the ISS – a collaboration between several partners, including the US and Russia – is set to be decommissioned around 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If recent ramifications of great power competition between Russia and China and the West – such as concerns about a looming renewal of the nuclear arms race – are any indication of the state of the geopolitical arena, the polarisation of space could have similar destructive consequences. Space has never been an apolitical place and the hardened political lines that can be observed on Earth are also clearly visible there – if not more obviously so. As such, NASA is legally barred from spending public funds on cooperation with China – making a collaboration between the two, as seen with Roscosmos, impossible at this point. After Russia’s previously problematic statements about the future of the ISS, it is now clearly positioning itself with emerged space power China. What remains to be seen is how Russia acts within this relationship and if, more broadly, the two countries can continue their uneasy business partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, unprecedented and comprehensive sanctions have been imposed on it. Among the measures taken in the first several months of the war were the immobilisation of the Bank of Russia’s reserves, sanctions on several large Russian financial institutions and their disconnection from SWIFT, the EU’s embargo on Russian oil, the G7 oil price cap regime, and comprehensive export controls on dual-use goods. More restrictions have been added since. However, the focus of the work of governments, think tanks and wider civil society has shifted to questions of implementation and enforcement. As the Russia sanctions regime is likely to remain in place for years, these issues will continue to play a major role. In addition, they are of utmost importance for the future credibility of sanctions beyond the Russia case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition’s actions have had a significant impact on Russia – curtailing export earnings, reducing policy space and limiting access to critical inputs for its military industry. But clearly, they have not succeeded yet at achieving their ultimate objective: to bring the war to an end and rein in the threat to peace and prosperity in Europe – as well as to the rules-based international order – that Russia poses. In fact, serious issues hinder effective implementation and enforcement of key measures such as the oil price cap and export controls. Over a period of more than two years, the RUSI-led European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (SIFMANet) has contributed to efforts aimed at understanding which sanctions work, which are plagued by practical challenges, and what needs to be done to improve their effectiveness and ensure their credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous SIFMANet events have established that all stakeholders – whether governments monitoring sanctions circumvention and evasion, private sector actors seeking to ensure their compliance with the restrictions, or civil society attempting to shed light on key developments – need more and better data. To gain further insights on this issue, the Centre for Finance and Security at RUSI hosted a roundtable discussion in Riga in March 2024, with the support of the Financial Intelligence Unit of Latvia, the National Endowment for Democracy and the Latvian Institute of International Affairs. The event gathered experts from public and private sectors across Europe to explore, under the Chatham House rule, the critical importance of data sharing and develop proposals for improvements in this area. This report summarises the main findings from the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-is-critical-for-effective-sanctions-implementation&quot;&gt;Data is Critical for Effective Sanctions Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way sanctions are thought about has changed dramatically in recent years – and with it, the approach to implementation and enforcement. Participants of the roundtable agreed that, for many years, sanctions – if they were more than simply a foreign policy messaging tool – largely fell on to the compliance departments of financial institutions. A global economy made traditional trade embargoes much more difficult to enforce. In response, the US began to leverage the primacy of its financial system to extend the reach of its sanctions. The threat of disconnection from correspondent banking accounts and loss of access to the US dollar meant that most financial institutions around the world had no choice but to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion described the Russia sanctions regime as fundamentally different from past cases in several respects. First, the sanctions coalition’s measures target an economy more integrated into trade and global financial flows than in any previous case. Second, the measures go far beyond restrictions on the financial system – they include interventions into global energy markets as well as complex supply chains and distribution networks for dual-use goods. Third, the Russia sanctions aim to restrict an aggressor’s capacities during an ongoing military confrontation, putting a much greater sense of urgency on making them work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As SIFMANet discussions have established previously, data is key. Governments need as much information as possible to guide the implementation of sanctions at home, to investigate and prosecute violators, and to target circumvention networks in third countries. But it is not only the public sector that relies on data. Financial and non-financial corporates can only ensure that their business activities comply with sanctions if they have access to a wide range of information. Finally, think tanks such as RUSI and its partners use data to complement governments’ efforts in the area of sanctions. The complexity of the issues at hand as well as resource constraints in the public sector mean that ensuring their effective implementation and enforcement truly must be a whole-of-society effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants of the roundtable recognised that the use of data has improved noticeably over the past two years. Many of the agencies involved in analysing and improving the effectiveness of sanctions now have access to a wealth of critical information. In addition, they have stepped up their efforts to analyse this data by linking information from different sources. Furthermore, cooperation between different agencies – within governments and across jurisdictions – has increased significantly over the past two years. Important challenges on data access and sharing remain, but participants agreed that substantial progress has been made in understanding how sanctions work in practice and on the operation of Russian evasion schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-changing-focus-from-red-flags-to-actionable-evidence&quot;&gt;A Changing Focus: From “Red Flags” to Actionable Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing complexity of the Russia sanctions regime poses major challenges for implementation and enforcement – and calls for a different approach to the use of data. For instance, assessing the effectiveness of the G7 oil price cap requires that government agencies not only establish that a certain transaction involving Russian oil as well as a coalition-based entity took place, but also identify the specific contractual terms – that is, the price – at which it did. This information must be collected from a variety of sources – which are not always publicly available and whose reliability raises legitimate concerns – and be merged to develop a comprehensive picture. Think tanks face essentially the same limitations and challenges when it comes to their work in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of the magnitude of the task concerns the private sector. Many large economies do not participate in the sanctions, pushing trade and financial transactions to places with far less transparency. For instance, participants highlighted that a large share of Russia’s imports of so-called “battlefield goods” continues to come from coalition-based producers but via third-country intermediaries in China, Turkey and the UAE, as well as countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Non-financial corporates are being asked to go well beyond traditional sanctions screening of business partners. Instead, they are tasked with controlling complex supply chains and distribution networks – a task for which they are neither prepared nor properly incentivised. In addition, the cross-jurisdictional nature of the transactions itself provides considerable room to conceal illicit activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For civil society, the task has also changed. Participating authorities emphasised that governments are looking for researchers and think tanks to identify much more than suspicious patterns or “red flags”. Rather, enforcement agencies are seeking actionable information that can be used to prosecute sanctions violators and/or target entities with new restrictions. In addition, they seek concrete and detailed assessments of how their measures impact transactions and sanctions compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-challenges-surrounding-data-availability-sharing-and-use&quot;&gt;Key Challenges Surrounding Data Availability, Sharing and Use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the discussion in Riga, several key points emerged on the challenges of acquiring, sharing and properly using data for effective sanctions implementation and enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;missing-and-inconsistent-information&quot;&gt;Missing and Inconsistent Information&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the Russia sanctions regime differs from past cases (such as Iran and North Korea) insofar as it imposes complex restrictions on trade and financial transactions. In addition, it has led to multi-layered and cross-jurisdictional circumvention and evasion schemes. This means that authorities in coalition countries must acquire and merge information from a wide variety of sources. This is often challenging. For instance, identifying a violation of the G7 oil price cap requires data on the entities involved in oil transport as well as on the price of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if access to the information is secured, it is often difficult to match it to other data and develop a comprehensive picture. On export controls, participants added that an understanding of the entire supply chain and distribution network is needed to determine if a coalition-based producer of battlefield goods has violated sanctions. As the physical shipments of such goods largely take place outside of coalition countries, their own customs data is of little help. And many countries through which the bulk of this trade is conducted do not share information because they do not participate in the sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorities can certainly establish that suspicious activities take place, but their ultimate objective of generating actionable intelligence is severely impacted by data constraints. To an extent, these are also the result of regulatory gaps. For instance, incomplete customs declarations can be penalised or prosecuted – but rarely are. And important fields in SWIFT are optional. This includes some that would be critical for the monitoring and identification of potential violations, including locations where physical shipments related to financial flows took place as well as trade codes identifying goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;access-to-and-quality-of-external-data&quot;&gt;Access to and Quality of External Data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a large extent, governments, the private sector and civil society have relied on Russian trade data to assess the effectiveness of sanctions. But with Russia increasingly restricting access to its data, representatives from these three sectors acknowledge that their ability to monitor developments is at risk. While some important information is commercially available, its reliability can be legitimately questioned. And such questions extend beyond Russian data. Outreach to countries that are strongly suspected to function as circumvention hubs – Turkey, countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia – has been a focus of coalition governments and the EU. One of the key objectives is to acquire data which can shine light on the extent of illicit transactions and the people and entities involved. Beyond capacity constraints that compromise the quality of the information, customs data is often incomplete (for example, due to smuggling) and/or subject to falsification. In fact, coalition authorities often find significant inconsistencies when comparing data related to the exact same transaction from different sources. Most often, codes identifying the goods in question – so-called Harmonised System (HS) codes – differ between exports to Russia as reported in coalition or third-country customs declarations and imports from those countries to Russia as reflected in the Russian trade data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-sharing-within-the-public-sector&quot;&gt;Data Sharing Within the Public Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia have decentralised implementation and enforcement structures. Participants provided several examples for responsibilities being divided between multiple institutions – ministries of foreign affairs, finance, and economy as well as customs services, banking supervisors, financial intelligence units (FIUs) and law enforcement agencies. This inevitably leads to a less-than-optimal exchange of information and can slow down procedures. Challenges related to data sharing go beyond issues related to institutional setup, however. In many countries, data protection standards are high, making it difficult for key agencies to access information. This can be the case, for instance, for information on physical flows of goods provided by customs services, and on financial transactions provided by central banks and FIUs. Barriers can generally be overcome in the case of suspicions of concrete illicit actions, but they often inhibit efforts to monitor sanctions-related developments more broadly. Detecting problematic patterns and developing strategies to improve the effectiveness of sanctions is, thus, made more complicated. Similar challenges exist for data sharing between governments. In addition, existing systems for information exchange – such as the Egmont Group, which facilitates cooperation between FIUs – are set up for very specific purposes and are limited to specific types of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;decentralised-enforcement-in-the-eu&quot;&gt;Decentralised Enforcement in the EU&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of decentralisation extends beyond individual governments. In the EU, despite 13 sanctions packages at the union level, member states are responsible for carrying out these measures in practice. And, not surprisingly, participants of the discussion reported that the 27 countries do things very differently. This concerns the institutional setup (that is, who is in charge of sanctions-related issues), staffing and resources (that is, what capacities are available for the task at hand), legal frameworks (that is, national legislation and regulations, criminalisation of violations, among others), access to critical information and political priorities. Inevitably, this leads to the fragmentation of sanctions enforcement and implementation in the EU. The involvement of government agencies from 27 member states – where responsibilities are also often split up between multiple players (as outlined above) – and the EU’s own institutions poses serious practical challenges to an effective exchange of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;private-sector-capacity-constraints&quot;&gt;Private Sector Capacity Constraints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, sanctions implementation has often fallen on the private sector, especially the compliance departments of financial institutions. The Russia sanctions regime is only exacerbating this dynamic. For instance, non-financial corporates have to control their supply chains and distribution networks related to goods critical for the Russian military industry. While buy-in from the private sector is essential, participants pointed out that governments must recognise existing capacity constraints to develop a sanctions implementation approach that works in practice. Many of the producers whose goods continue to reach Russia are large multinational corporations with significant resources to establish compliance structures and carry out the due diligence that is required of them – but not all of the involved companies are. Many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are involved as well, especially in the manufacturing of hi-tech machinery such as CNC machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;slow-pace-of-adaptation-to-challenges&quot;&gt;Slow Pace of Adaptation to Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognise that economic sanctions are not static. Rather, they require frequent adjustments as their target adapts to restrictions and establishes evasion and circumvention schemes. This is particularly relevant in the current case of a far-from-global sanctions regime and an adversary – Russia – that has considerable experience with manoeuvring around such restrictions. After all, it has done so for roughly 10 years since sanctions were first imposed in 2014. Participants expressed serious concerns about the ability of coalition government to react swiftly to Russia’s actions and, more fundamentally, questioned if the issue is treated with a proper sense of urgency. For Russia on the other hand, the existential nature of the challenge is clear. And, as an increasingly repressive dictatorship, Russia has more flexibility to act compared with the democratic systems of the coalition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leveraging-the-role-of-the-financial-industry&quot;&gt;Leveraging the Role of the Financial Industry&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A topic that had emerged at previous SIFMANet events was again the focus in Riga: the financial industry’s role in sanctions implementation and enforcement. As mentioned above, banks have been involved in these efforts for a long time, but their responsibilities are likely to grow significantly. US President Joe Biden’s Executive Order of 22 December 2023 sent a clear message to foreign financial institutions that they risk losing access to the US financial system if they facilitate significant transactions relating to Russia’s military-industrial base. This represents a clear threat of secondary sanctions in the area of export controls. However, it will likely also make banks much more careful when it comes to any other transactions that involve Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants expressed support for leveraging the role of banks in cross-border transactions to improve the effectiveness of the Russia sanctions regime. But they also urged caution regarding such an approach’s practical execution. For instance, simply adding new requirements to the industry’s compliance efforts is unlikely to result in functional procedures without proper guidance. What is more, efforts to involve the financial industry will need to go beyond those global banks that have traditionally been tasked with the implementation of sanctions. Financial flows are fungible and, especially when related to illicit activities, will be quickly redirected through any entities not in focus. This concerns smaller traditional banks as well as non-bank financial institutions such as payments services providers or actors in the crypto sphere. These entities, however, are not insulated from sanctions. Many of them also rely on access to the US financial system and the US dollar. They are also connected, through correspondent accounts and other business dealings, with those large global banks that have substantial experience with sanctions compliance and could hand on due diligence requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations-data-is-key-to-making-sanctions-work&quot;&gt;Recommendations: Data is Key to Making Sanctions Work&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way sanctions are viewed has changed dramatically. Implementation and enforcement of an ever-more comprehensive and complex sanctions regime poses new and growing challenges to governments, the private sector and civil society more broadly. Data is key to making these measures work as effectively as possible and constrain Russia’s ability to continue its war of aggression against Ukraine. Specifically, access to data as well as its effective exchange and use are critical to assessing and improving the implementation of sanctions at home, investigating and prosecuting violations, and informing steps to rein in circumvention networks abroad. Throughout the roundtable, participants discussed ideas to improve data-related efforts. The specific recommendations from the event are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralise sanctions responsibilities within countries.&lt;/strong&gt; Some EU member states are leading the way when it comes to centralising sanctions-related functions by designating competent authorities for implementation and enforcement. Participants expressed that cooperation and coordination within governments and across borders, including for data, would benefit from other countries following suit. As sanctions will remain a key element of foreign policy in the coming years, now is the time to equip institutions with proper resources and procedures. Clearly assigning responsibilities and mandates must be an integral part of this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve cooperation and data sharing across jurisdictions.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the key findings of the roundtable is that authorities across the coalition have much better access to information now than two years ago. In addition, efforts are underway to link different data sources to develop a comprehensive view on the effectiveness of sanctions. However, improvements are needed when it comes to the exchange of information across jurisdictions. Existing systems require modifications so that they can be used to address the challenges emerging from the type of unprecedented and comprehensive sanctions that have been imposed on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exchange best practices and learn from one another.&lt;/strong&gt; Some jurisdictions, mainly the US, have significantly more experience with comprehensive financial and technology sanctions. All involved countries should cooperate closely on best practices and learn from one another’s successes and failures. Specifically, authorities across the coalition should look at jurisdictions where sanctions violations have been successfully prosecuted in the past and assess how they can implement the most-effective procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage the role of financial institutions in trade.&lt;/strong&gt; Banks have emerged as a key player in sanctions implementation and enforcement and their role will only grow in areas such as export controls as it may be easier to trace trade-related financial transactions than physical shipments. While banks have established compliance resources and procedures and already provide much information to supervisory bodies and other enforcement agencies, it is critical to enable them to play an expanded role by adapting the regulatory framework. For instance, certain fields in SWIFT such as HS trade codes should be made mandatory. Otherwise, it will be extremely difficult for banks to identify red flags and stop illicit transactions in their tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand interactions with non-financial corporates.&lt;/strong&gt; Many coalition governments have taken steps to reach out to the private sector beyond the financial industry to provide guidance and offer technical assistance. It is critical that they continue to do so regularly and intensify this cooperation. With sanctions evasion and circumvention networks adapting rapidly to changing conditions on the ground, government agencies must engage in an ongoing dialogue with the private sector. Importantly, this should include establishing clear feedback mechanisms through which they can tap into companies’ expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with trade organisations to extend reach.&lt;/strong&gt; As more comprehensive and complex sanctions place growing responsibilities on the private sector, it is critical to make sure that SMEs can also play their role. Given their relative lack of resources and experience with sanctions compliance, governments should work closely with trade organisations to provide guidance and technical assistance to companies. Industry bodies should be leveraged to ensure that due diligence efforts go beyond large multinationals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Involve civil society in sanctions monitoring efforts.&lt;/strong&gt; The experience of the past two years has shown that civil society – including institutes such as RUSI and research networks such as SIFMANet – plays an essential role in using data to assess the effectiveness of sanctions and develop concrete recommendations for their improvement. Think tanks, NGOs and other similar organisations not only complement scarce resources in the public sector but can also provide a more strategic vision, which is often crowded out by governments’ urgent policy design and implementation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue diplomatic outreach to third countries.&lt;/strong&gt; Considering the limits of data availability and important gaps in the tracing of supply chains and distribution networks, coalition governments need to undertake efforts to gain access to information from third countries. While not the case for all jurisdictions involved in sanctions evasion and circumvention (such as China and the UAE), many, especially in the Caucasus and Central Asia, can be incentivised to share more data as they are interested in deeper commercial ties with the EU and other coalition countries. Data sharing, however, will not be sufficient if not accompanied by technical assistance to public and private sectors alike to build capacities and improve data reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roundtable participants stressed that it will become clear in the coming months if coalition countries are up to the task of responding decisively and quickly to Russia’s attempts to work around the sanctions regime. Fundamentally, they were optimistic that, if the extraordinary wealth of information available is leveraged to assess the effectiveness of existing measures, identify and prosecute violators, as well as develop strategies to improve the implementation and enforcement of sanctions, Russia’s capacity to wage war on Ukraine and undermine the rules-based international order can be constrained. It will require improvements to institutional setups and the facilitation of information exchange within governments and across borders, as well as leveraging the role of the private sector and involving civil society. More fundamentally, it will need an understanding of the existential nature of the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（11日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第58日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，他表示在《國安法》之前理解自己會見外國議員等活動是合法。在《國安法》生效之後，李和另一名被告陳梓華曾討論是否繼續國際游說和倡議工作，還是到美國任職非政府組織「中國人權」，後來李決定繼續游說工作，「呢個決定唔係一個令我特別 comfortable 嘅決定，但對我嚟講，佢似乎係一個 least evil 嘅決定。」李形容《國安法》條文含糊，又預料北京會「搬龍門」來針對政敵，法官問李為何不停止游說工作，李則表示：「因為如果北京覺得你係政敵嘅話，就算你做唔做某啲嘢，佢都會搵到方法嚟政治檢控你。所以我繼唔繼續做一啲嘢，無關係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第15天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。代表黎智英的新西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;曾赴聯合國及會見外國議員-李宇軒國安法之前是合法活動&quot;&gt;曾赴聯合國及會見外國議員 李宇軒：國安法之前是合法活動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在2020年7月1日《國安法》生效之前，李曾會見訪港的美國議員 Rick Scott、到訪聯合國和法國，以及協助「攬炒巴」劉祖廸接待訪港的英國議員 Bob Seely。辯方問以李的理解，上述活動在《國安法》生效之前是否合法。李回答：「合法嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，李所面對的控罪涵蓋2020年7月1日至2021年2月15日，所以並沒有因為上述的活動而被起訴，而李直到現在仍然相信這些活動是合法的。李同意：「全部合法嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方的盤問下，李確認在2019年6月至2020年7月期間，「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）內部從來沒有共識推舉李代表 SWHK 做任何違法行為，而李也沒有基於協議而同意做違法行為，以及沒有協助其他人去做違法行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並確認，他不知道上述活動是違法，直至2020年6月30日午夜《國安法》條文出爐，又指：「《國安法》會令之前合法的行為變成不合法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示李宇軒與「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC）創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）之間的 Telegram 訊息對話。李向裴倫德指《國安法》條文中文版已公佈，條文內容比想像中更差（“it’s worse than we thought”），又指根據條文裴倫德已經犯了法（“you have committed a crime according to the text :)”）：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李庭上解釋，上述訊息的意思是裴倫德既不是香港公民也不身處於香港的司法管轄區之內，但《國安法》第38條提及「域外效力」，所以根據條文定義，裴倫德已經是犯了法，「同埋《國安法》個條文，我係覺得好 vague（含糊）嘅」，因此可以廣闊到涵蓋裴倫德正在做的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒憂北京用國安法針對政敵-向裴倫德提議游說各國取消引渡協議&quot;&gt;李宇軒：憂北京用國安法針對政敵 向裴倫德提議游說各國取消引渡協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月2日，李宇軒向裴倫德徵詢意見，問他是否應該游說其他國家取消與香港的司法互助和引渡協議，以及國際倡議的效用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李庭上解釋：「我理解《國安法》第29條個用字係好闊，而第38條係講緊全球嘅人都適用，類似咁解」，加上北京對於條文的廣闊詮釋，預料《國安法》「會用落 political enemy 度」，所以他透過訊息告訴裴倫德「《國安法》會 reach 到你個國家，同埋其他國家嘅 citizens」，為了保障其他國家的公民，有需要檢視是否取消與香港的司法互助和引渡逃犯協議，「防止《國安法》的政治檢控落到去你個國家同其他國家嘅公民度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱北京總會找到方法針對政敵-與是否繼續做手上工作沒有關係&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱北京總會找到方法針對政敵 與是否繼續做手上工作沒有關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問李對於《國安法》「紅線」有什麼理解，包括有什麼事可做、有什麼事不可以做。李回答：「我嘅 understanding 係北京會搬龍門，所以冇得由我或者其他嘅 citizens 去知道個紅線喺邊，rather 我嘅 understanding 會係有一個 broad 嘅 interpretation 去畀北京搬龍門。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，既然李有上述擔憂，為何不直接叫裴倫德停止他手上的工作。李則回答：「因為我覺得北京會搬龍門，所以即使你唔做一樣嘢，如果北京要政治檢控你，佢就會用第二啲嘢嚟 charge 你。」李續指，無論是否《國安法》也好，北京會「搬龍門」說現在起訴的罪名已經是法律所涵蓋範圍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問，《國安法》條文有提及對於《國安法》生效之前的行為沒有追溯力。惟李表示：「我唔信嗰條文會係好似字面咁解地去被 interpreted。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官又問，為何他不停止正在做的事。李宇軒表示：「因為如果北京覺得你係政敵嘅話，就算你做唔做某啲嘢，佢都會搵到方法嚟政治檢控你。所以我繼唔繼續做一啲嘢，無關係。」李官說，所以李決定繼續做下去。李宇軒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;國安法後決定繼續國際游說-李宇軒指似乎係一個least-evil嘅決定&quot;&gt;國安法後決定繼續國際游說 李宇軒指「似乎係一個least evil嘅決定」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方另展示李宇軒與另一名被告陳梓華（網名T）在2020年7月23日的 Signal 訊息對話，二人討論李是否應該到美國的非政府組織「中國人權」工作，或者繼續做國際游說工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，直到當天，李就《國安法》對他是否有影響的理解，是否與《國安法》剛開始生效的時候差不多，還是有改變。李則表示，「我當時覺得反而係 confirm 咗我對《國安法》嘅 suspicion，因為真係用咗佢嚟拉嗰啲社運人士。」所以他在7月2日與裴倫德傳送訊息時提及對於《國安法》的理解，直至7月23日時仍然一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問李後來決定繼續做游說工作，是否他自己的決定。李則表示有跟陳梓華討論過，又表示：「呢個決定唔係一個令我特別 comfortable 嘅決定，但對我嚟講，佢似乎係一個 least evil 嘅決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，李當時面對兩個選項，一是冒著更大觸犯法律和被拘捕的風險，二是不繼續游說工作，然而李卻選擇了前者。李則回答：「唔係，我當時個 mind 入面唔係呢兩個選項」，當時他懷疑北京可能已經將他視為政敵，所以政權已經有方法拘捕及起訴他，但是擺在他面前的問題是「即使繼唔繼續，都會被拘捕」，因此他當時考慮的問題是應否繼續游說工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認swhk從沒公開提流亡政府&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認SWHK從沒公開提流亡政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，李宇軒和陳梓華曾經討論在外地成立流亡政府，問李是否同意 SWHK 從來沒有在其網站發布相關內容。李同意，他又指 SWHK 內部從來沒有討論過成立流亡政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指李從沒有採取任何行動成立流亡政府。李則表示他曾經問過梁頌恆、陳浩天、黃台仰和梁繼平等人是否願意籌組流亡政府，但他們均表示不會做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指更新swhk和ipac網站之前不會徵詢黎智英mark-simon或陳梓華&quot;&gt;李宇軒指更新SWHK和IPAC網站之前不會徵詢黎智英、Mark Simon或陳梓華&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前供稱他協助 SWHK 將內容上載至網站。在辯方的盤問下，李確認他並沒有負責將內容發佈至 SWHK 的 Facebook 和 Twitter，新聞稿也不是他撰寫的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問李，他上載文章等內容至 SWHK 網站之前，並沒有與黎智英或其私人助手 Mark Simon 討論過。李確認。至於陳梓華，李表示他與陳有討論過一些 SWHK 的活動，但是他把活動資料上載至網站時，並不會事先徵詢陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，《國安法》生效之後，李繼續協助 IPAC 更新網站，和列席會議，並指李事前從沒與黎智英和 Mark Simon 討論。李同意：「冇討論過。」至於陳梓華，李表示他有時與陳討論 IPAC 的事，但不會在更新網站之前徵詢陳的意見或批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又確認他在不會對其他人作出指示，「我可以邀請人哋去幫手，as an individual activist」，例如有一份 IPAC 會議紀錄，他會問日本群組的會否自願幫手，但他不可以落指示：「喂，你一定要過嚟翻譯啦！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（11日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第58日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。辯方盤問時指，另一名被告陳梓華曾經告訴李，如果香港成立到軍隊的話，以色列軍隊可以協助訓練「勇武」人士，李確認陳曾提出這想法，但「我唔知佢有幾認真」。此外，李亦確認陳提及其「勇武隊」涉及7.21白衣人事件，以及2020年農曆新年期間邊境口岸的爆炸品事件。李於2020年8月10日被捕，他確認從警署獲釋之後，陳在電話中聲稱會安排他離開香港。李指，其後有不同的帳戶使用「化名」告知他入住「安全屋」、乘坐專車到布袋澳碼頭和聯絡「船家」等，並叫他乘船到達台灣之後自動投案，因已將李的個人資料交給陸委會。李又指有人告訴他，當時有捷克代表訪台，當李獲釋之後，若果趕得及的話，應該跟隨捷克的代表乘坐回程的私人包機，到達捷克之後便找方法前往倫敦。惟「走鬼」計劃未能成事，李最終被大陸公安拘捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第15天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。代表黎智英的新西蘭御用大律師 Marc Corlett 盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方陳梓華把勇武小隊隊長介紹給李宇軒&quot;&gt;辯方：陳梓華把「勇武小隊隊長」介紹給李宇軒&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於另一名被告陳梓華（網名T）是否帶領多於一隊「勇武小隊」，李宇軒表示不知道。辯方又問以李所理解，陳是否視「勇武」為削弱香港政府管治的方法。李則表示，以他對陳的理解，陳認為「勇武」能夠「做到一個政權唔係實際上管治到一個領土」。至於陳是否認同使用「勇武」，李則指：「部份同意，或者 conditionally agree。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方提到，陳梓華曾經叫李宇軒到火炭工業區一幢建築物見面，並將一名叫「Cap」的人介紹給李，同場還有一名叫「Cath」的女子和一名叫「廢老」的男子。辯方問，陳介紹「Cap」時，有否形容他是「勇武小隊隊長」。李指「Cap」即是「Captain」，所以他估計其名稱是這個意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳梓華有否告訴李「Cath」是負責製造爆炸品和汽油彈。李則指「冇咁 detail」，當時陳使用「科學實驗」字眼，而且作出「引號」的手勢。辯方又問，陳有否提及「勇武隊」儲藏爆炸品的地方。李指：「應該係話，T 嗰隊勇武有自己嘅地方擺佢自己嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指陳梓華曾提及口岸爆炸品事件與其勇武隊有關不滿有人咁快玩槍&quot;&gt;李宇軒指陳梓華曾提及口岸爆炸品事件與其「勇武隊」有關、不滿有人「咁快玩槍」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳有否告訴李，陳的「勇武隊」曾經涉及7.21白衣人事件之中。李確認有，但不肯定陳是否在火炭那次會面中講過。辯方又問，陳有否提及他的隊伍涉及中聯辦外的騷亂事件。李則指陳並沒有詳述，只說過「搞中聯辦嗰次」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳有否提及其隊伍牽涉在2020年農曆新年期間邊境口岸放置爆炸品的事件。李指陳曾提及事件與他的「勇武隊」有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又問，就大埔有人開槍的事件，陳有否向李提及過。李指陳只說過「有人喺大埔玩槍」，之後說了類似：「屌，做乜咁快玩槍呀！」李並指，「屌」一字在該句說話中是重要，「一來我係理解 T 係知道呢件事，同埋佢 disapproved of 嗰個人，同埋屌嗰個人咁 pre-maturely 玩槍。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認陳梓華曾提及以色列軍隊可協助訓練勇武-惟不知是否認真&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認陳梓華曾提及以色列軍隊可協助訓練「勇武」 惟不知是否認真&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在另一個場合之中，陳梓華曾向李宇軒談及如果成立到流亡政府的話，陳會負責成立和訓練軍隊。李則指這是兩條不同戰線，「如果將國際游說推到盡，就係成立流亡政府；如果將啲勇武推到盡，就係軍隊。」辯方追問，陳有否說過會訓練軍隊。李指如果成立到軍隊的話，會由陳或其他發展出來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，在另一個場合中，陳告訴李，如果成立到軍隊的話，以色列軍隊可以協助訓練「勇武」。李則指上述似乎不是陳說話原文，而且陳好像是在談論其他事的時候提出這想法，但「我唔知佢有幾認真」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認被捕後陳梓華稱會安排他離開香港&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認被捕後陳梓華稱會安排他離開香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，李宇軒在2020年8月23日涉非法偷越邊境罪而被拘捕。李確認，並指「畀大陸公安拉」：「大陸嗰啲著住藍色衫，膊頭有個牌寫住公安嗰啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，李原本在2020年8月10日在香港被拘捕，其後在8月12日獲警方批准擔保。李獲釋之後，曾與陳梓華透過電話通話，而陳稱會替李安排離開香港。李確認，但實際安排方面，「我唔知係佢（陳）做，定係第二啲人做，然後由佢傳話。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在2020年8月18日，陳梓華叫李前往將軍澳日出康城。惟李指他原本的手機被警方沒收，從警署獲釋之後，他使用另一部手機作為「鬼機」，而他百份之一百肯定所有聯絡他的人都是使用「化名（pseudo name）」。李表示，雖然陳知悉他的「鬼機」電話號碼，但是當有一個人叫他前往日出康城時，他不肯定對方是否與陳梓華有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又指，有人安排「走鬼」期間，會有不同的帳戶聯絡他，中間這些帳戶甚至通訊軟件也換過幾次，雖然他不肯定是否一個人聯絡他，但是從訊息來看，「好似 pick up 到當時發生咩事個 thread，咁我就 trust it。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指除了陳梓華之外，知道他使用「鬼機」的人還有其大妹 Beatrice。而李相信陳梓華和其大妹將他的情況告知其他人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認有人安排安全屋專車和船家-並叫他到台灣後投案&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認有人安排「安全屋」、專車和「船家」 並叫他到台灣後投案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦確認曾經有一個帳戶叫他提防被跟蹤，但是不肯定對方是否陳梓華。此外，李確認有一個人將「安全屋」業主的聯絡方法交給他，告訴他有專車接送他去另一間「安全屋」，而且車上有「畀我換嘅衫」，但李不知道對方是否陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，陳梓華或另一個帳戶是否在2020年8月23日凌晨3時，叫李前往西貢布袋澳碼頭。李記得當時是深夜，但不知道是什麼時間。李又確認，陳梓華或另一個帳戶將「船家」的聯絡方法交給他，而此前他已經知道他將會去台灣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李確認，陳梓華或另一個帳戶曾叫他乘船到達台灣之後自動投案，對方亦稱已經將李的個人資料交給陸委會。李指有人告訴他，當時捷克有代表訪台，當李獲釋之後，若果趕得及的話，應該跟隨捷克的代表乘坐返回捷克的私人包機，到達捷克之後便找方法前往倫敦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問如何能有300萬元積蓄-李宇軒指靠寫電腦程式獲取收入&quot;&gt;官問如何能有300萬元積蓄 李宇軒指靠寫電腦程式獲取收入&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方盤問完畢之後，法官李素蘭問及李宇軒的個人背景。李稱在2019年的時候，他任職電腦程式編寫員，會接一些專案來做，有時是他一手包辦，有時他會找認識的程式編寫員一起做。李素蘭指，李宇軒在2019年時積極參與社運，有否繼續做編寫程式的工作。李確認他繼續工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又表示，他自大學畢業起便開始任職電腦程式編寫員，至2019年僅僅接近10年，而他的主要收入來源是這份工作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李素蘭問，李如何能夠儲存到300萬元銀行積蓄。李則表示閱讀銀行紀錄之後，發覺自己記錯金額，正確金額應該有逾400萬元，這是靠「做 programming 嘅錢」而累積而來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，李到訪日內瓦的聯合國總部、法國、日本等地方，有否獲得任何資助。李稱他支付自己的機票、酒店和大部份費用，但是有部份行程的費用則是向眾籌基金報銷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;稅單顯示李宇軒年薪達120萬元&quot;&gt;稅單顯示李宇軒年薪達120萬元&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示李宇軒在2018至2019年度的稅單，當中顯示他的年薪達120萬元，扣除強積金和免稅額後，應課稅入息實額為105萬元，應繳稅款為約14萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱，就編寫電腦程式的工作，一開始時薪是15美元，幾個月後升至時薪40美元，後來接多了專案，時薪再慢慢升至40至50多美元，其後時薪繼續上升。李又補充，因為工作是以專案為單位，有時可以接多些專案，但有時可以沒有任何專案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒作供完畢。控方替下一名「從犯證人」陳梓華申請「提犯令」，料明日傳召他出庭作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has led to the extensive employment of UAVs to deliver precision effects at scale. Militaries observing the conflict are assessing how they can integrate these capabilities into their own forces and mitigate the threat from them. This paper is the first in a series. It examines how UAVs offer the most utility to land forces; subsequent papers will consider counter-UAV methodologies and their role across the joint force. There are six critical conclusions that can be drawn from the present paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, UAVs’ primary offer is their ability to deliver effect at either a cost or a scale that cannot be matched by other means. This means that UAV designs should be ruthlessly simplified and optimised for defined tasks. However, there are also limits to the extent to which costs can be driven down if a system is to be reliable and resilient. There are, in fact, very particular intersections between price and capability where UAVs are optimally effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, UAVs should be treated not as platforms but as systems. Any UAV becomes increasingly ineffective over time as the adversary refines its countermeasures. Ensuring that a UAV complex can continue to function effectively requires updates to software, behavioural logic, sensors and radios, every six to 12 weeks. The airframe is the constant but least important component. UAV procurement must reflect this, with suppliers contracted to provide subsystems, not integrated packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the effectiveness of UAVs is largely determined by their layered employment, by crew skill, and by the capacity to plan flights. The latter requires access to electromagnetic surveys, meteorological data, intelligence on enemy air defences, and awareness of other UAV activity. The need to scale effect, and to have access to a support structure that must often draw on highly classified capabilities, means that while some UAVs may be widely distributed as tactical tools, most classes of UAV are better grouped into a specialist formation that is able to use different kinds of UAV in combination, and that has the in-house capacity to update and reconfigure its UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, a UAV battalion, equipped to deliver close and deep strike, deep ISR and enabling action, can support a large area of battlespace. While the capabilities they offer can pose challenges to the enemy, however, UAV effectiveness is ultimately dependent upon their interaction with artillery, electronic warfare, air defence and other force elements. UAVs may redistribute the balance of missions assigned to different systems, but they do not eliminate the requirement for traditional artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth critical conclusion is that regulation of UAVs is a major constraint upon their effective design, procurement and employment, and thus on their battlefield effectiveness. There are trade-offs between the speed of evolution necessary to keep these systems competitive and the safety requirements for airspace deconfliction. It is evident that the structures that exist in NATO countries today tend to increase cost and slow down development to such an extent as to prevent NATO states from employing UAVs effectively. The approach to regulation should be scrutinised, as it has an impact on the operational outputs of the force in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a force that is aware of and equipped to counter the threat of massed UAVs can degrade their efficiency. There are many limitations to UAVs that can be worked around through adaptive tactics. These methods are difficult to scale. However, a force that is not aware of or equipped to counter UAVs risks ceding the enemy an insurmountable advantage in situational awareness, and suffering from a scale of precision effects that will prove crippling. Armies cannot, therefore, afford to be unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study addresses the question of what components are necessary for land forces to field a UAV complex that can deliver precision effects en masse to maximise the efficiency of exchange with an enemy. The study pursues this question by exploring three questions in sequence. The first chapter surveys the technological enablers of UAVs and the design trade-offs that ensue. The intent is to bound the resilience and scale of effect deliverable at a given price point. Having mapped where the utility and cost balance lies, the second chapter then explores the types of system a force must field in combination to maximise its effect. Having considered the number and type of UAV systems involved, the third chapter maps what is necessary as an enabling structure to deploy this scale of effect. The study also seeks to outline the limits of what can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper draws on practical experimentation by the authors with most classes of military UAVs in NATO arsenals, and visits to sites and units engaged in the manufacture and testing of bespoke UAVs. The fieldwork included physical examination and technical inspection of Russian and Iranian UAVs, observation of UAV combat employment in Ukraine, and extensive interviews with manufacturers, operators, and troops responsible for countering UAVs. The authors also conducted a literature review of work on airframe design. Much of this research was undertaken in contexts where operational security or commercial sensitivity prevent direct attribution of data points in the present study. Therefore, the authors have attempted to find open-source material which replicates important data points or principles accurately where possible. This is the first study in a series: the second will outline a methodology for countering mass precision UAV strike complexes, while the third will consider how UAV and counter-UAV capabilities redistribute responsibilities and interactions across the joint force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the 1980s, precision has been at the heart of the concept of a revolution in military affairs. The efficiency of targeting using precision weapons was perceived by the Soviet Union to be as consequential for the conduct of war as the advent of nuclear weapons, while such capabilities sat at the centre of the US offset strategy during the Cold War. The volume of precision strikes that a force can deliver has, however, been constrained by the cost and complexity of these munitions, making their allocation a key prioritisation decision in operation design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advent of machine learning, miniaturised sensors and UAVs has driven widespread speculation about the ability to deliver precision strike at a previously unattainable scale. UAVs carrying small payloads, delivering munitions precisely at the most vulnerable points, across the front, have dominated visions of future war in both science fiction and military theory. Conceptually, the emphasis on precision strike has moved from limited numbers of prestige systems to cheap, attritable mass effects, especially in the land domain. These capabilities are not only presented as a novel strike system but are often touted as rendering a wide range of established military systems obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most visions of mass precision strike do little to outline the limitations of cheap and attritable platforms. Nor do most of these studies outline how such a capability may drive an adversary to adapt its dispositions and capabilities. Furthermore, much of the emphasis in the literature is on the delivery mechanism – the UAV – while very little attention is given to supporting enablers or the formations required to field UAVs at scale. These enablers create vulnerabilities in a mass precision complex that have rarely been mapped, and consequently there has been little consideration of how a mass precision complex may need to be employed in order to assure its own survivability and effectiveness. Unpacking these considerations is vital as militaries begin to invest significantly in UAV technology. In the UK, for example, the Ministry of Defence has just committed £4.5 billion to UAV acquisition, while Project Replicator in the US is set to receive several hundred million dollars’ worth of funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to bound the scope of this study. One of the enduring sources of confusion about the impact of UAVs on the battlefield is the elasticity of the word “drone”. This term is used to cover everything from hand-sized UAVs designed for scouting buildings to long-endurance high-altitude aircraft such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk, which are comparable in size to a regional airliner and cost more than $100 million each. There is a perennial tendency in the literature to describe a quadcopter costing around $2,500, and then to casually endow it with capabilities that would require processing power, battery, sensors, communications links and lift that are unlikely to be viable below a price point of around $80,000. This paper does not assume that a single airframe can achieve the range of effects required; this is why it is premised on the study of a mass precision strike complex. By “complex”, the paper means a grouping of UAV platforms that, as a system, offers a commander the ability to deliver mass precision effects. Complexes include the airframes and their payloads, and the launch crews, command links, planning tools, intelligence support and design teams required to field the capability. The precision strike complex is discussed as being formed of five UAV classes: situational awareness UAVs optimised for tactical reconnaissance; tactical strike UAVs; ISR UAVs able to penetrate into operational depth; operational strike UAVs; and platform-launched effects designed specifically to synchronise with and enable other weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several systems that fall under the highly general term “drone” that are excluded from this study. This study does not examine hand-held micro-UAVs, nor does it examine remotely piloted medium-altitude long-endurance UAVs such as the MQ-9 Reaper or the Bayraktar TB2, because these are optimised for operating in uncontested airspace. The study considers expendable systems that might be launched by air forces, but does not consider full-scale loyal wingmen or uncrewed combat aerial vehicle-type platforms. Nor is this paper concerned with blue-water naval capabilities. The capabilities described are relevant to littoral naval operations, but naval engagements at sea are likely to employ UAVs in a range of bespoke roles that are beyond the scope of this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-uav-design-trade-offs&quot;&gt;I. UAV Design Trade-offs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amass precision strike complex is not just a question of UAVs. Traditional barrel or rocket artillery will deliver precision effects, while electronic warfare (EW), geospatial and other ISR assets are fundamental to a robust reconnaissance strike complex. In theory, however, UAVs allow this complex to scale and mesh across echelons because of the ability to generate large numbers of ISR feeds and to economically deliver a high volume of precision effects, either by exploiting UAV-based ISR to make traditional artillery precise, or by delivering effects with UAVs. Given that it is the UAVs that sit at the nexus between precise and mass effect, understanding the design limitations and trade-offs inherent to UAVs is vital to grounding concepts of employment within the bounds of what is physically possible and worthwhile from a cost versus effect point of view. This chapter, therefore, details the design considerations that make up a UAV, from the airframe, propulsion and power requirements to the navigation and control mechanisms, sensors and payload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;airframe&quot;&gt;Airframe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The airframe for any given UAV sets both the aerodynamic parameters and many of the performance and payload parameters. There are fundamental trade-off decisions that must be made during the formative design stages of any system. The starting point is to determine the range and payload weight and size required to perform a UAV’s role in the mission set. These parameters will determine the options in terms of propulsion solutions, which in turn will impose fuel or battery capacity requirements on the airframe. Through a process called fuel match sizing – illustrated in Figure 1 – the required size of the airframe can be determined based on the fuel or battery capacity that must be carried to allow the available propulsion and aerodynamic configuration to carry the mission payload the distance and for the duration needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OBjH5hO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Fuel Match Sizing.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA192214.pdf&quot;&gt;J L Parker, “Mission Requirements and Aircraft Sizing”, in “Special Course on Fundamentals of Fighter Aircraft Design”, NATO Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development, AGARD Report No. 740, October 1987&lt;/a&gt;, p. 2-16.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Figure 1 shows, the range and endurance required are crucial to determining the size, configuration and cost of the platform. The more range required, the greater the weight and size of the fuel or battery packs necessary to run the motors for a sufficient length of time, and therefore the greater the size and weight of the airframe. As the size and weight of the airframe increase, the power required for sustained flight at a given level of performance will also increase, meaning that the propulsion solution will consume more power per minute and thus the fuel/battery capacity needed will further increase, driving a commensurate increase in airframe size, and so on. Thus, relatively small increases in mission payload or range requirements can drive significant increases in overall airframe size, weight and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Airframe configuration will also depend on the range and flight performance required. Broadly speaking, rotary engine configurations such as multi-copter UAVs are significantly less efficient in terms of fuel/battery power consumption over a given range and endurance compared to fixed-wing configurations. However, they are capable of hovering in place, launching and recovering vertically in complex terrain, and making sharper turns than fixed-wing systems. Therefore, for many mission sets, the flexibility that a rotary configuration brings is worth the trade-off in endurance and payload for a given size and power. Fixed-wing configurations are more efficient in terms of how far and how long a given payload can be carried at a given price point and size. However, they also require a flat, open space to launch and recover (proportionate to the size of the platform), are unable to make sharp turns or stop and hover, and are more predictable in flight, making them easier for hostile forces to detect and engage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The airframe configuration of a traditional aircraft is a relatively fixed constraint once initially fuel-match sized and specified. The complexity of redoing aerodynamic, weight and balance, lift/drag and other calculations, and retooling factories to significantly different airframe specifications, has generally precluded major changes in size and layout once an aircraft is in production. However, recent developments in additive manufacturing and advanced machine-learning-enabled aerodynamics and flight control analysis have combined to make it easier to change airframe configurations rapidly, especially for smaller systems. In Ukraine, both sides make regular use of modular UAV components to iterate new and flexible copter-type configurations. Firms also use additive manufacturing and computer-aided design suites to print UAV airframes for fixed-wing designs and tweak internal and even wing configurations as mission requirements evolve and operational usage data is collected. Therefore, airframe designs for massed strike complex assets are likely to be significantly more flexible and adaptable even once in production than traditional aircraft or even UAVs have been over the past century. This does come at the expense of reliability and safety, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are limits to this adaptability, since changing the aerodynamics, size and payload needed for a system will unavoidably affect the power and lift required to keep the system airborne within its performance parameters. This will affect the fuel or battery power required, and so may drive further spiralling increases in required airframe power, size and ultimately cost. At a certain point, asking for just a little more range or a heavier or more power-hungry payload may drive the airframe configuration to a point where it is no longer economical to use in the quantities desired, or there may be a significant impact on platform reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other potentially significant airframe considerations include weather tolerances. Waterproofing for internal components to enable sustained operations in bad weather, as well as, potentially, heat dissipation or cooling features to enable payloads to function in very hot weather and de-icing features to enable winter operations, all add cost, weight and complexity. A good example of such a trade-off is where a UAV’s intakes are located. Because UAVs often fly low, in a hot, dusty environment, a dorsally mounted intake improves reliability over a ventrally mounted intake. A dorsal intake tends, however, to have reduced reliability in rainy conditions. Some companies have developed novel methods for thermal management to get around these issues, but such bespoke solutions push UAVs well outside the realm of commercial off-the-shelf components and so add significant cost. For all-weather capabilities, most airframes will need to be bespoke military designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;propulsion-and-power&quot;&gt;Propulsion and Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice of propulsion type is one of the fundamental factors that will set the boundaries of possibility for a UAV, weapon or aircraft. No matter what software or sensors an airframe is fitted with, the laws of physics will still determine the ranges, speeds and durations it can operate over, based on the amount of engine thrust available and the length of time for which this can be sustained. The three primary options for propulsion categories are propellers, jet turbines or rocket engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propellers provide by far the greatest efficiency in terms of the amount of distance that can be covered for a given amount of fuel or battery power. They are also the simplest and cheapest solution, meaning that for assets that are intended to be fielded in very large numbers and be truly expendable, they are often the first choice. However, they are also the slowest in terms of cruise and dash speeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propeller solutions can be powered by either electric motors or internal combustion engines, with electric power providing quieter operation, often cheaper and simpler installation, and potentially simpler logistics. However, a study in 2020 found that for UAVs, batteries store around 260 times less power for a given weight compared with gasoline. Furthermore, this battery weight penalty for flight increases in a non-linear fashion with increases in the required range/endurance of a UAV mission. This is because, unlike fuel, which is burned over time and so decreases in weight as it is used up, spent battery packs still weigh the same as charged ones. This means that adding additional battery capacity to increase range gives less and less benefit as range increases, especially for systems that are not intended to be single-use one-way attack (OWA) assets. By contrast, combustion engines burning fuel generally involve a more complex airframe installation and make more noise but provide significantly greater potential thrust and range. As a result, for applications requiring light payloads over short ranges for limited periods, electrical power is generally the preferred solution, while the longer the required range and the heavier the payload, the more compelling combustion engines powered by fuels become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Propeller-based propulsion solutions generally also produce a significant rotor sound signature that is easier than other forms of propulsion to detect, classify and track using passive acoustic sensors. This can be mitigated to some extent with specially designed propellers. Small and/or light rotor blades such as those found on most multi-copter UAVs also generally have significant limitations in cold weather environments due to icing problems, and at altitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second option for propulsion is jet turbines. The main attraction of a turbine solution is that it enables significantly higher airspeeds and potentially operational altitudes than propeller-based solutions. Therefore, where a system needs to cover distances quickly, a turbine propulsion solution is attractive. Depending on the design and size of the turbine, such a solution can also offer respectable fuel economy over long distances, but would still require more fuel than a propeller propulsion solution for a given range in most circumstances. Jet turbines cannot be used on purely electric platforms, and they are also significantly louder than propeller-based systems. Turbine engines are much more expensive than propeller engines, and their installation and the speeds at which they allow platforms to operate generally imply a more complex and sophisticated airframe configuration, increasing cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final propulsion option is rocket motors. These can be powered by liquid or solid fuels, although for small systems, solid fuels are preferable because of their greater stability, which enables systems to be transported and stored in a “ready to use” state. Solid-fuel rocket motors are also much simpler and cheaper than liquid-fuelled systems. Compared with both jet turbine and propeller propulsion options, rocket motors offer far greater static thrust and, therefore, much greater acceleration and top speed for a given size. However, they also burn fuel at a vastly greater rate and so only provide power for the initial few seconds of flight, leaving the platform to glide to its target from that point on using the kinetic and gravitational energy built up during launch. Rocket motor solutions offer much greater responsiveness but over a much shorter range than other propulsion options. Solid-fuel rocket motors are generally cheaper than a jet turbine propulsion solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;Navigation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precision is dependent upon accurate navigation and timing. If a UAV (or its operator) does not know where it is, then it cannot guide a munition, or itself, to an identified target unless the target is already in line of sight. The robustness of a UAV’s navigation is fundamental to its utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ubiquitous approach to navigation is to rely on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), including GPS, Galileo, BeiDou and GLONASS. These systems all work through a similar logic. A constellation of satellites broadcast their location with a timestamp of the emission. A receiver can measure the difference between the time at which the signal was received and the timestamp of when it was sent to establish an accurate line of bearing. By comparing four lines of bearing from different satellites, the receiver can triangulate its own relative position. The power of these navigational emissions is very low; they are, therefore, easy to receive, but also easy to jam through saturation of the frequencies used. Alternatively, adversaries can deliver false signals such that the receiver is spoofed into locating itself in an erroneous position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One partial solution to this is to receive on multiple GPS frequencies and even to have antennae scanning frequencies between GPS, BeiDou, Galileo and GLONASS, and compare the results. If the results not only vary but also diverge or converge, then the receiver can either seek to confirm which signal to trust or else revert to another mode of navigation. This increases the complexity and cost of the receiving unit. Although it is possible for an enemy force to fully jam these navigational frequencies, it will rarely jam all of them because it will often be using some of them to determine the location of its own equipment. Nevertheless, if for a limited period the threat from UAVs renders it worthwhile to deny one’s own navigation, then GNSS can be denied. To rely on this method of navigation is to make the capability hostage to the enemy’s risk calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normal reversionary method is inertial navigation, enabling the UAV to plot its own location relative to a known starting position. To do this, the UAV must first know that it is being jammed and therefore assess when to revert, or else use inertial navigation with its launch point as its point of reference. The system must have a laser gyroscopic compass, a precise clock, a pitot tube measuring airspeed, and a barometric or radar altimeter to establish altitude. These requirements all add significant cost, meaning that it is difficult to produce UAVs which include such navigational capabilities and that can be sustainably expended en masse. Some of these systems – barometric altimeters, for example – are also more accurate when they are larger. In the case of barometric altimeters, a larger capacity of vacuum chamber improves sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inertial navigation systems are highly susceptible to becoming increasingly inaccurate over time, because they struggle to determine drift. It is therefore usually necessary for inertial navigation to intermittently recalibrate through external confirmation. This can be done with GNSS if it is available, with the potential for gaps in jamming, whether because of terrain or the enemy periodically lifting electronic protection. It can also be done through periodic triangulation using civilian infrastructure such as mobile phone masts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the reliability of location confirmation can, however, be achieved via other means. One such method is terrain recognition. If a platform has an electro-optical sensor and a pre-loaded map of the terrain over which it is flying, computer vision can be used to match the UAV’s camera view against identifiable terrain features and physical markers such as rivers, roads and forests. In some contexts, more novel navigation techniques can be employed. If a platform can roll and fly inverted, or if it has an additional electro-optical sensor facing upwards, then it can use triangulation from astronomical points of reference to confirm its position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if a platform has a laser range finder and flies at a low and level altitude, it can compare changes in contour of the ground over time to track its progress over its pre-loaded map. Novel methods, however, are mission-specific and present significant vulnerabilities. Following terrain contours, for example, does not work if there is low cloud or if the ground is flat, featureless or snow-covered. Astral navigation is restricted to clear nights and requires medium-altitude flight. These techniques may, therefore, enable navigation for specific missions, but they are not generalisable. They also tend to be sufficiently accurate to get a munition over a target, but insufficient to strike it precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very specific navigational tool, which can overcome limitations of terminal accuracy, is an emissions seeker that aligns a UAV to a particular target, such as specified radar emitters. Loitering munitions including Harpy and Harop can home in on enemy emitters and loiter when signals are lost. In this way, they can have a suppressive effect. Such capabilities, however, are optimised for limited classes of target, and are susceptible to hard counters unless paired with other threat systems that impose conflicting imperatives on an adversary. Other systems, such as radar, can be used to align a munition in terminal dive in order to strike a specified area on an object. This kind of system works at short range, and while suitable for ensuring that a system working on inertial navigation can course correct to hit a specified target during its terminal dive, it requires an additional sensor to the inertial navigation system. Each additional sensor imposes an increase in cost, complexity, size and weight. Image recognition is another solution, but unless assisted by offboard data or human oversight, it is vulnerable to decoys, camouflage and other countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The navigation methods discussed above are primarily for platforms that are designed to perform much of their navigation automatically, rather than under real-time human control. The latter requires an active command link between the UAV and the human operator during flight. For ISR platforms, such a link is necessary to offboard detections. For all UAVs, however, flying under control, with navigation conducted by a human operator, can obviate the need for the UAV to know its location. Where periodic human control in a contested electromagnetic spectrum is possible, this can also allow recalibration of inertial systems. The viability of this method is dependent upon power and the sophistication of the datalink being used to maintain control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;datalinks&quot;&gt;Datalinks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radio frequency command links are generally only effective within line of sight, unless a relay is used. Power ultimately determines the strength of the command link and the ease with which it can be jammed. Jamming tends to affect the receiver through saturation. Thus, many UAVs can offboard data even when they are not able to receive it. For UAVs operating in tactical depth, their proximity to their controllers and the limitations on how far forward enemy jammers can be pushed makes it easier to maintain command links. For UAVs pushing into enemy territory where the receiver is closer to enemy jammers than to friendly command transmitters, this becomes problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The robustness of these connections depends upon the complexity of the radio employed. If a UAV has a frequency-hopping radio, rapidly moving over a sufficient portion of the spectrum, then it is difficult to jam, though interference may corrupt or degrade data being transferred. A dual-frequency receiver is often an effective way of giving some resilience without incurring the cost of a high-end frequency-hopping radio. Reliability can also be improved through directional beam riding, whereby only commands passed on a specific vector are accepted, thereby rendering jamming that is not aligned ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some specialist jamming equipment can track patterns in frequency hopping and craft bespoke interference patterns that degrade command links. One way of obviating this is to have a group of UAVs passing data to one another, with each programmed to receive on different frequency regimes. If the contents of the data include a certification of authenticity, then each UAV that successfully receives authenticated data can confirm that it has received a correct command and then relay this to other UAVs in the same formation. Another way in which UAVs can collaborate to overcome jamming, as well as extending the range of command, is to act as relays for one another, such that the command signal is emitted and received closer than the jammer is to the receiver, significantly increasing the power required by the jammer to suppress the signal. Although these kinds of techniques are viable, they depend upon sophisticated and therefore costly radios. They also rely on skilled operators to programme and set up the communications architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another form of command link that can be robust is a satellite link, since it is difficult for a jammer to achieve alignment against the antenna. Satellite links are also valuable for offboarding data over the horizon. The problem with satellite links is that they introduce significant latency into a system and are generally unsuitable for maintaining a platform under direct control. Updating orders via satellite link is viable, but continuous correction of flight surfaces is more problematic. Robust satellite links depend upon highly effective gyro-stabilisation of the antenna, and are therefore only viable on larger airframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sensors&quot;&gt;Sensors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sensors required for a UAV are dependent on both the effect needed when the component reaches its operational area and the navigation solution(s) being relied on to get it to that operational area. In an ideal world, the same sensor or group of sensors can be used for both, since minimising sensors required is crucial for conserving space, weight, power and computing (SWAP-C) capacity, and overall unit cost. This is not always possible, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensors can broadly be divided by the parts of the spectrum in which they operate. The simplest and most ubiquitous sensors are electro-optical (EO) cameras. Drawing on technological innovation and cost reduction driven by the commercial mobile phone sector, even small UAVs can be cheaply equipped with high-resolution EO cameras purchased in bulk from the civilian market. Advanced optical systems with high levels of magnification rely on more complex lens and stabilisation/vibration dampening technologies to be effective. Therefore, the greater the stand-off range and altitudes that an optical sensor needs to be effective over, the more expensive, large and costly it will be. Another major driver of cost, size and complexity is the need for flexible, trainable mountings, as opposed to fixed camera mounts in an airframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to EO sensors are infra-red (IR) cameras, which use thermal imaging and can function in low light conditions. IR sensors can either be standalone or integrated into multispectral cameras that combine EO and IR capabilities. Both are more costly than basic EO cameras. However, if a UAV is to operate at night, the cameras must either be IR-capable, or the system must be modular and able to accept either an EO or an IR sensor fit – either way, complexity and cost increase. Image-intensifying capabilities, which take an EO sensor and maximise its performance in low light, can extend a UAV’s utility into the night, but will struggle when there is minimal ambient light. Both EO and IR cameras offer notable advantages for smaller UAVs. They require limited power to operate and are passive. They do not rely on emitting electromagnetic energy to function and so do not risk giving away the presence of the platform to hostile passive sensors when used. They are also difficult to jam, although they are vulnerable to camouflage measures and potentially to defensive laser-based systems that can use retro-reflection to detect cameras, or dazzle or damage the optical sensors. EO and IR cameras also do not work through clouds, fog, snow or heavy rain. Therefore, UAVs cannot exclusively rely on cameras if the complex that they are part of needs an all-weather capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another category of sensor is radio detection and ranging (radar). Radar can be subdivided into passive and active systems, and by the frequency band that each system is designed to operate in. In general, the higher the frequency and shorter the wavelength a radar operates at, the higher resolution it can offer, but the shorter its effective range for any given power level. Longer-wavelength systems also require larger apertures to function effectively, and so most radar sensors small enough to be mounted on a UAV will be higher-frequency, shorter-range systems. Passive radar systems only have the ability to “listen” for reflected radar energy from external emitters, while active radar systems broadcast and then “listen for” the returns from their own energy. The latter is more flexible and reliable, but allows for tracking of the UAV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For UAVs, radars are often used for synthetic aperture radar mapping, where active radar signals are emitted and the returns from all ground objects and terrain are used to build up a radar “image” of an area. Radars can also be used for detection of other airborne objects, and for terrain mapping for navigation in any weather. Some advanced weapons and OWA UAV designs also use millimetric radar seekers to scan for and provide pinpoint terminal guidance against vehicles and other reflective targets. This allows weapons to perform automatic target search and guidance, but at a significant cost and complexity premium. In general, the biggest benefit of radar-based sensors is that they work equally well in bad weather or at night, while the disadvantages include greatly increased power and cooling requirements, as well as significant cost. For sensing at long range using radar – for example, for stand-off ISR – the power and aperture size required limits such sensors to being carried by fairly large, complex and expensive airframes such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk, most of which are not survivable in contested airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Passive radars and electronic and signals intelligence (ELINT/SIGINT) sensors require significantly less power to operate than active radars and can often be mounted in more flexible ways to suit different airframe configurations. However, they still require the capacity to conduct complex signal analysis and processing functions on the platform, or the ability to pass the raw returns data back to a ground station or other airborne asset for offboard exploitation and processing. This ensures that a capable passive radar or ELINT/SIGINT sensor payload requirement will increase the SWAP-C, cost and complexity for a given system well beyond those of an EO/IR sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is worth mentioning lasers as a joint sensor/effector capability. Lasers are most commonly employed for precise ranging, for designation of targets for strikes with laser-guided weapons, and increasingly, for directional, high-bandwidth line-of-sight communications. They are generally incorporated into an EO/IR sensor as an additional component within the optics, but generate additional requirements for power and cooling when in operation. They also entail additional cost, since EO/IR sensors that incorporate a laser designator/rangefinder are more expensive and larger than basic cameras, and come with additional stabilisation and tracking requirements. There is also a processing demand generated by the logic that aligns the laser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;effectors&quot;&gt;Effectors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is little point in building a mass precision strike complex without the ability to deliver suitable effectors to the target area. Effectors are divided into two primary categories: kinetic; and non-kinetic. For kinetic effectors, there are three primary classes of warhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these are general-purpose warheads that rely on a combination of high-explosive blast and fragmentation effects to kill personnel and damage structures. HE-FRAG-type warheads have lethality that scales linearly with size against soft targets such as unarmoured vehicles, personnel and civilian structures. For small multi-copter UAVs, HE-FRAG payloads are roughly the size of a hand grenade and have a lethal radius of several metres, but offer little destructive effect against buildings. They can be effective against vehicles, but only if delivered accurately into hatches or on to fuel tanks or ammunition. Meanwhile, a roughly 200 kg OWA UAV such as a Shahed-136 can carry a warhead of up to 50.2 kg of various types, including thermobaric payloads. This can have destructive effects against non-hardened buildings and offers a lethal radius of tens of metres and the ability to reliably damage lightly armoured vehicles with near misses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major category of kinetic effectors are shaped-charge warheads designed for anti-armour use. These use a small explosive charge to project a focused jet of molten copper that can penetrate through thick armour plating, creating red-hot fragments that kill crew and ignite fuel or ammunition stored inside a vehicle. These types of effectors are also known as explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs. Shaped charges enable relatively light warheads to destroy well-protected armoured vehicles, including main battle tanks (MBTs), if they hit the right sections at a relatively flat angle. In Ukraine, these effectors have been demonstrated by the large-scale use of small first-person view (FPV) racing quadcopters fitted with modified 2 kg RPG-7 warheads as short-ranged OWA UAVs. The downside of shaped-charge warheads is that they have very limited blast and fragmentation effects compared with simple HE-FRAG warheads, rendering them less effective against personnel or buildings for a given weight of explosive. They are also more expensive. A specialised subset of shaped-charge warheads are two-stage warheads: some of these combine an initial charge designed to penetrate either armour or buried structures with a follow-on HE-FRAG charge that bursts inside, while in others, the primary charge is designed to set off reactive armour in order to enable a second shaped charge to defeat the main armour of well-protected modern armoured vehicles. These are more complex, and thus more expensive, than single-stage shaped-charge warheads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third type of kinetic effectors are multirole warheads. These are increasingly common on high-end missiles and loitering munitions that need to be able to destroy a wide range of different targets. Such weapons typically use a dual-stage design, with a penetrating shaped charge as a primary stage and a compact HE-FRAG second stage. These warheads have much in common with two-stage penetrating warheads but are conceptually designed with anti-armour/anti-personnel/anti-structure mission flexibility in mind, rather than the ability to specifically penetrate either buried structures or vehicles protected by reactive armour layers. Like two-stage warheads, they are much more expensive than either HE-FRAG or single-stage shaped-charge warheads and are used when the economies of scale of ordering large volumes of a single multipurpose weapon are perceived to outweigh the additional cost of the warhead itself. The latter relationship is important to understand when examining the multirole utility of a mass precision strike capability. The requirement to be used en masse and thus be affordable conflicts directly with the very significant warhead costs per platform associated with true multitarget flexibility. Multirole warheads also necessarily have a lesser effect on most individual target sets than an appropriate single-role warhead of the same weight. Therefore, for small UAVs or other payload-constrained systems, the additional warhead weight for a given explosive or penetrating effect of designing a single warhead with multitarget flexibility may impose an unacceptable trade-off against fuel/battery capacity and range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-kinetic effectors are, largely, EW payloads designed to degrade hostile sensors, either through noise jamming or through more sophisticated signal timing manipulation or protocol-based electronic attack techniques. The advantage of deploying such payloads forward into hostile terrain on UAVs is that the physics governing radar and communications signals mean that effective jamming requires greatly diminished power input the closer the emitter can be placed to the target receiver, and the better it can be aligned to the centre of the target sensor array. The drawbacks of EW payloads are that they are more complex and expensive than kinetic warheads, require significant onboard power generation and cooling to operate for any sustained period, and rely on up-to-date mission data files and signal coding to be effective. They may still be relatively efficient and effective for larger systems being used as part of, for example, a suppression of enemy air defences campaign, where the alternatives are cruise missiles. However, EW payloads tend to be much more expensive than most kinetic effectors used in UAVs in support of the land fight. This constrains their use to complex and survivable platforms, and means that their effectiveness against hostile sensors will diminish rapidly in any conflict once used, as the enemy adapts its countermeasures to nullify the jamming. Therefore, while the airframe to carry an EW payload could be made relatively cheaply, the payloads themselves will be not only expensive but also sensitive. Furthermore, such payloads are reliant on a complex and expensive national ELINT/SIGINT collection, analysis and mission data file generation apparatus to create and rapidly update the signals that they use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;regulation&quot;&gt;Regulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not part of the core design trade-offs in a UAV as a platform, regulation has an outsized impact on design choices and whether the system that produces UAVs is fit for purpose. Because early UAVs were predominantly large airframes with significant range and endurance, the certification of UAVs developed from the process that regulates aircraft. As the speed of UAV development accelerates, in terms of alterations to payload configuration, navigational logic, command link resilience and airframe, the assurance work needed to guarantee that a UAV will reliably function without crashing or deviating from its anticipated behaviour increases. Assurance of the system’s reliability not only imposes time on the development process but also expands the platform cost, both to conduct the trials and to take on the risk of designing a UAV that may not be certified, thereby delaying the sequencing of design and investment in production capacity. There is, therefore, a trade-off between safety and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another consideration is regulation’s indirect impact on doctrine. Safety has often imposed strict airspace management on how UAVs are integrated into exercises. The greater these constraints, however, the less realistic is the use of UAVs during training compared with their actual employment on the battlefield. Since organisations will shape themselves to solve the problems they encounter as regards novel technology, it follows that communications procedures, command relationships and other structural components of a mass precision complex will be heavily shaped by how regulation allows UAVs to be employed on exercise. The level of risk a state is prepared to accept as regards air safety in order to enable realistic training will therefore determine the extent to which UAV formations will need to be restructured in war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final point about regulation concerns targeting. Many of the methods for making strike UAVs more robust involve the use of autonomous target recognition. Even for ISR UAVs, object recognition is a valuable means of accelerating the targeting cycle. In principle, anti-tank mines, anti-radiation missiles and missiles with active seekers such as Brimstone are all autonomous weapons. The novelty of this should not be overstated. However, the capacity for UAVs to fly significant distances in different directions introduces safety considerations for autonomy that are more easily mitigated with older weapons. Furthermore, declarations that states expect a “human in the loop” impose very significant constraints upon how UAVs can function. The regulation of data, assurance, and the algorithms that process the data all impose cost and time restrictions on the adaptability of UAVs. These processes therefore have tangible military consequences, especially if they are underpinned by international agreements or law, rather than policy that can be adapted in the event of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various components that make up a UAV, outlined above, highlight how there are significant trade-offs involved in designing a UAV for a given mission. There is also the challenge of scaling a capability that may have a limited period of maximum utility before the adversary can map its characteristics and field hard counters. Furthermore, many of the constraints outlined above demonstrate why endeavouring to do too much with a UAV either risks preventing it from being fielded at scale or actually increases its vulnerability. Yet UAVs that are not sophisticated will often struggle to sustain the delivery of effects in the way that traditional strike systems can. This places a premium on the ability to align UAV designs to their tasks, and taking a ruthless approach to simplifying the platform. It is this matching of capabilities to tasks that is covered in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-assembling-the-complex&quot;&gt;II. Assembling the Complex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having considered the trade-offs in UAV design, it becomes possible to outline the key mission sets that different components of a mass precision strike complex may be designed to carry out in support of land operations. In turn, analysis of these tasks can help determine the cost, complexity, volume and parameters of the UAVs required to deliver these missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mission-sets&quot;&gt;Mission Sets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be worth investing in at scale, a mass precision strike complex must deliver precision effects against a sufficient volume of targets to disrupt or degrade the enemy’s capacity to competitively fight. This task may be broken down into five mission sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mission set is ISR in the close fight, over the battlespace occupied by an equivalent echelon to the formation in contact. The requirement is to provide tactical formations with persistent visibility of the battlespace in order to coordinate traditional fires, or to call in mass precision strikes on identified targets. Density of sensor coverage is a key driver of capability here, as is the ability for these assets to operate from tactical formations without absorbing disproportionate cognitive load from a section or platoon. As these systems must operate persistently, little can be done to shape or route-plan where they will operate. Consequently, they will be required to fly in heavily contested airspace without shaping effects being sequenced to reduce threats prior to launch. It must therefore be assumed that these platforms will be lost in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second mission set is to deliver precision strikes in volume in the close. This primarily involves strikes on groups of armoured fighting vehicles, firing positions, and communications equipment. The number of targets for a strike will vary, but could number as many as 12 platforms. Range requirements likely sit at up to 10 km of depth from the forward line of own troops (FLOT), requiring an effective range of approximately 20 to 30 km to be able to launch from a safe distance behind the FLOT and cover a sufficient arc of battlespace. Targets are highly likely to be mobile and time-sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third mission set comprises over-the-horizon reconnaissance against targets in the deep battle area. The range requirement would cover the enemy’s close-support artillery and reconnaissance-fires system, requiring approximately 80 km to be traversed from point of launch. Maximum penetration range is likely constrained by transit speed as much as fuel, since beyond a certain distance many longer-range effectors will no longer be able to reliably reach targets before they have displaced. Static targets, identifiable by other means of detection such as geospatial or electromagnetic reconnaissance, are not the primary targets for these systems. Instead, the object is to precisely locate enemy artillery, air defence, and command and control infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth mission set comprises long-range strikes against operationally significant targets. Ranges may be up to 500 km, and targets could include tactical systems or fixed targets such as airfields or occupied structures of military utility. Owing to limitations on the weight that can be carried such distances by systems cheap enough to be used en masse, targets are unlikely to include hardened infrastructure, which would remain the preserve of larger and more expensive cruise and ballistic missiles. Given the long transit time implied by travelling so far from the point of launch, long-range strikes in this fourth mission set would require careful mission planning and would not involve dynamic targets. However, by offering a persistent threat of precision strike against logistical infrastructure and command and control elements, these capabilities would add significant friction to the enemy’s ability to resupply and coordinate forces, and therefore to achieve concentration. These capabilities also represent a concern for air and naval forces insofar as they threaten infrastructure and basing. The planning involved means that strikes will prioritise operationally significant and therefore defended targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final mission set comprises enablement of joint strike. This could be by providing airborne communications relays for other UAVs. It could also involve the delivery of loitering EW effects to degrade defences and enable them to be bypassed by more capable strike systems. A key variable in the design of such enablers is the speed of engagement for the strike that is being enabled, since this will determine the duration that the effector will need to be on target and the time it has to reach that point. Without a complicated kill chain, it may also require commonality of launch platform with the effector that the platform is enabling, and such commonality is not guaranteed. For example, penetration aids dispensed by cruise missiles will quickly be left behind by the munition. A UAV loitering over defensive systems, by contrast, can present defensive radar with a persistent variety of false targets throughout the duration of a cruise missile engagement, increasing the probability of a successful strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;close-isr&quot;&gt;Close ISR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core mission for close ISR is to provide persistent and widespread coverage for units in the close fight. Units that have uncompetitive situational awareness are liable to suffer disproportionately in engagements. The rough requirement is for each platoon to be able to generate two UAVs. The platforms must be attritable because they are needed in a confined battlespace and are required to fly irrespective of the level of EW interference – this means that they will be lost in large numbers. Since the operator cannot select the time and place of their use, and because many of them are needed, the platforms must be as cheap and simple to operate as possible, as well as having a low logistical burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rotary system is the most efficient design. Since the system will likely need to be carried by dismounted personnel, a target weight below 2 kg is optimal. The platform must be usable during the day and at night, and able to identify targets in cover, meaning that a thermal optic is highly desirable – this is likely to be the most expensive component of the UAV, followed by its antenna and battery. Overall, the target price is likely to be below $2,500 per airframe, in order to enable militaries to procure the UAVs in sufficiently large numbers for training and operations as disposable assets akin to munitions. Some units that anticipate operating with a lower signature and which need greater environmental assurance will likely see the price point for their UAVs rise to $8,000 per unit. The rough flight requirements are for 40 minutes’ endurance and an operating range of approximately 10 km. The cost target required to sustainably field these systems as expendable massed assets imposes limitations in terms of being able to incorporate EW resilience and non-GPS-dependent navigation and other features discussed in Chapter I. To make investing in more expensive systems affordable, the anticipated attrition rates and thus numbers required would need to be commensurately lower. Large-scale, as opposed to ad hoc, procurement may help drive prices down, thanks to economies of scale that allow vendors to manufacture more cost effectively, but this approach also makes rapid design iteration to stay ahead of enemy adaptation more difficult. One of the simplest means of increasing survivability is to make sure that the UAV utilises a different control frequency for each flight, thus requiring the adversary to identify the frequency before its EW can attack the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Command and control for such a system must be hands-off, because the operator is liable to be distracted by threats to their person. The platform requires the ability to maintain its position, likely by fixing itself above a visually identified point on the ground. The presumption should be that the platform is able to operate without GPS, as this will be routinely denied. The best means of achieving this is probably for the platform to measure its distance and bearing from the control station, certified as genuine through a mission-specific pre-loaded encryption key. Commands can thereafter be given to the system to move a specified distance in three dimensions, or to fly under direct control. The determination of locations of detected objects would likely be achieved by the operator based on alignment of the images with their own map. Given the need to keep the cost of the platform to a minimum, object recognition and other AI-enabled capabilities would likely be cost-prohibitive on these platforms. The optimal behaviour of the UAV if it were to lose connectivity for a sustained period would be to fly towards its last-detected direction of certified command for a comparable distance to the assessed range to the emitter, and then land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present there is no competitive alternative to the products of DJI, the Chinese manufacturer that dominates the market in small civilian uncrewed aerial systems (UAS). Comparable products are manufactured by NATO members, but not at a competitive price for quality. The basic reason for this is that because DJI has cornered the global civilian market, it has economies of scale in production that reduce its prices – as well as having had heavy financial support from the Chinese government. In this way, NATO’s civilian market is directly subsidising the development of People’s Liberation Army military systems. To compete, NATO members must first increase the order volumes on a smaller selection of UAVs and enable the progressive refinement of designs. Second, it is necessary to allow sale of simplified products but with substantial parts commonality on the civilian market. Systems produced by Western vendors must be modular in design and support upgrades of certain components such as processors, sensors and radios, in order to allow initial vendor production and military procurement ramp-up to take place without resulting in obsolete equipment too quickly, and to allow for a fast pace of innovation. Without these measures, assured Western access to the necessary production volumes of UAVs in this class at a viable price point is precarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;close-strike&quot;&gt;Close Strike&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of this mission set is to provide the joint force with a means to degrade the fighting effectiveness and ideally halt the movement of hostile forces before they can close to within direct-fire weapons range of friendly forces. This could be achieved by destroying significant numbers of either key enablers in depth; close-support artillery and other support platforms such as vehicles extending electronic protection to advancing forces; or manoeuvre elements. Since movement of effective fighting formations over tens of kilometres tends to be vehicle dependent, most of the key target sets that must be struck to accomplish this task will be armoured vehicles. This class of massed strike assets is more likely to be required to launch on detection of targets, rather than loiter for extended periods. This is because the mission requires a large number of weapons to arrive in a short period of time, to rapidly degrade formations as they advance and to overwhelm point defence systems. It is also because the armoured nature of many key targets, particularly hostile MBTs, means that a shaped-charge warhead must be carried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To degrade the effectiveness and/or stall the advance of enemy formations, catastrophic kills on vehicles are unnecessary; damage sufficient to immobilise a majority of the vehicles present should suffice. Combat experience in Ukraine suggests that this level of damage is reliably achievable with relatively light and cheap massed OWA UAVs such as the Russian Lancet-3M with a 5 kg shaped-charge warhead. Once vehicles have been damaged sufficiently by hits to their engines, running gear or other key components, they will become stationary targets for artillery or other less specialised massed fires components such as FPV drones. Thus, in conjunction with other capabilities, the critical task for mass precision strike effects in the close is to be able to immobilise most of the tanks and armoured fighting vehicles in a hostile company-sized formation before they can close to within direct-fire range (approximately 2.5 km away from the FLOT). If this can be achieved in a manner that is significantly more cost effective and efficient than massed artillery or attack aviation, then it is likely to represent a compelling investment case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A standard Russian tank company in a battalion has 10 MBTs, while a standard motor rifle company has between two and four MBTs and between six and eight infantry fighting vehicles or armoured personnel carriers. Therefore, as a planning assumption, stopping a company-sized assault requires the ability to reliably immobilise or otherwise mission-kill four to six armoured vehicles, which are often equipped with explosive reactive armour. The number of precision effectors required will depend on the terminal survivability of the weapon, the effectiveness of the warhead, and the accuracy and robustness of the weapon’s guidance/control system. Increasing the speed of flight by using a small turbojet rather than a propeller will increase response times between launch and impact, and potentially make the weapon harder to intercept, but will increase cost and thus reduce the number that can be procured and launched for a given budget; it will also reduce terminal manoeuvrability. The same can be said for warhead effectiveness – a larger or tandem warhead will give greater probability of mission-killing an armoured vehicle for each hit, but it will also necessitate a larger, more powerful airframe/propulsion configuration, which will increase cost and thus reduce affordable mass of munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a sense of the cost boundaries, an FPV UAV with an anti-tank grenade attached to it may have a unit price of approximately $800 to $1,800. However, operational data from Ukraine demonstrates that only approximately one in five of these munitions reaches a target, because of the manufacturing quality and reliability, the pilot skills required and the effect of EW on their control channels. Indeed, there are large parts of the day when EW means that FPVs simply cannot be used. FPVs also have an unreliable effect on armoured targets, requiring multiple hits to kill. Moreover, because of their short range – made even shorter in cold temperatures – and the problems associated with spectrum crowding in cheap FPVs due to simple, low-quality radios, it is difficult to concentrate FPVs. Ukrainian FPV teams often need to disperse 500 m apart to avoid spectrum interference. There are more advanced FPV systems emerging, which are more reliable and have higher hit ratios, but cost in the region of $3,000. FPVs nevertheless remain tools that are primarily effective when the enemy decides to accept the risk from them by turning off jamming. They are a useful section-level tool, able to deliver precise effects from cover, but are not a sufficiently reliable system to form a core capability in a mass precision strike complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a weapon such as the Lancet-3M, which has a fairly reliable effect on targets that are not protected by reactive armour, and is guided by a cheap FPV control system that operates on a dual frequency and a reserve frequency to complicate jamming, the destruction of the target might be reasonably accomplished by launching between two and three weapons per target. With object designation allowing for autonomous terminal homing, the Lancet-3M can also reduce its vulnerability to interference once it is descending upon its target. With a range of approximately 35 km, Lancets can converge from multiple axes, and their size allows them to carry an antenna to interface with relay UAVs that significantly complicate attempts to jam their control frequencies. Thus, to stop a company-strength Russian formation with around 10 armoured vehicles, the launch of 20 Lancet-3M type effectors should be enough. Given a publicly available cost estimate for a Lancet-3M of $30,000, on munitions expenditure alone, this would suggest a cost of around $600,000 to achieve the mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the US-made FGM-148 Javelin has a cost per missile of around $170,000, with a range of between 1,200 m and 4,000 m depending on conditions, while the AGM-179 Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) is being offered to the British Army’s AH-64E Apache fleet at up to $319,000 per missile. In practice, the price of the JAGM is likely to be closer to $200,000. The cost of these two weapons reflects their additional speed, range, terminal accuracy and warhead complexity, giving them a probability of kill that is close to one, even against heavily armoured targets, though there are bespoke countermeasures that can be used to reduce this. A Lancet-style munition with a warhead comparable to a dedicated air-to-ground missile, a rocket motor to complicate interception and a more robust command link is technically feasible; however, such a design would be similar to the existing Israeli SPIKE NLOS anti-tank missile, reaching a price point of around $200,000 if it is to have comparable range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outlining these cost point and capability benchmarks is important, because the public discourse surrounding UAVs often takes its cost assumptions from FPVs, but ascribes to them the capabilities of a Lancet, with the further enhancements of networked AI. This is unrealistic. Operational analysis is clear that while FPVs are a useful infantry weapon and additional tool, they are not reliable or dependable, and their effects do not currently scale. Moreover, a more capable UAV in the price range of existing air-to-ground missiles is likely rather redundant. However, Lancet-style UAVs deliver air-to-ground-missile-like effects at much greater range. They are easier to counter, but flexible enough to be employed when the necessary countermeasures are not in place. They are also a large enough munition to be upgraded with some modularity. The aim, therefore, should be for a munition with around 30 km range, carrying a 5 kg warhead, manufactured at a price point below $40,000 per unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deep-isr&quot;&gt;Deep ISR&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to fly and loiter in depth requires an airframe with a fixed wing and an endurance, with its necessary payload, of approximately 2.5 hours. If we assume a minimum 30-minute loiter time in the target area to identify relevant targets at a maximum depth of 70 km – determined by the maximum range of effectors available in quantity – then this would leave 120 minutes to cover up to 90 km of battlespace, including the distance behind the FLOT from which the platform is launched. If the system is to remain capable of this in moderate-to-high winds of 25 knots gusting 40 knots, with an assumption that this may be a headwind, and that the benefit of the tailwind on the return flight is taken to maintain the loiter, this requires the platform to be able to cover approximately 250 km of distance in 120 minutes, producing a target airspeed of 125 km/h. Smaller platforms may be suitable for supporting tube artillery units, given their limited range, but this constitutes a reasonable maximum requirement for an ISR UAV. The resultant airframe is likely to have a wingspan of approximately 4 m and be driven by a propeller, not least because it must be able to loiter efficiently at low speeds while over the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of sensors, ISR UAVs need EO/IR sensors. These must be gyro-stabilised to counteract vibration in order to be clear even when zoomed in. The platform must also have the ability to offboard information on detected targets. There is a design choice between a platform that conducts object recognition using its own sensors and offboards merely the classification and position of observed objects, as compared with one that offboards full-motion video. The former is significantly more complicated but resilient, while the latter pushes the analytical burden onto the receiver and requires a persistent link, which is targetable by adversary EW assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep ISR platforms are likely to be required to operate in a GPS-denied environment, and if they are to obtain an accurate fix on targets, they must also be able to determine the precise position of an identified object despite denial of navigational signals. The most likely method to achieve this is inertial navigation supported by periodic updates from terrain recognition working from pre-loaded maps. This could be overlaid with an updated calibration from a control station using an elevated narrow-beam transmission. Offboarding data would most reliably be achieved via satellite link, or a directional antenna using a software- defined radio. The ability to precisely locate target objects for strikes by other assets would likely require a laser rangefinder to calculate bearing and distance from its own position in order to obtain an accurate grid reference. Some advanced systems can calculate an accurate position of a camera impact point using high-fidelity terrain maps, slant range calculations and terrain feature matching – however, these capabilities depend on relatively complex components on the UAV to provide it with the required onboard data points. A target located by a UAV using these means could then be compared with the fixed location of the visual image in identified maps for verification purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirement to maintain coverage over areas of interest means that it would be necessary to deploy concurrent orbits, such that a unit of action of these UAVs would need to comprise three airframes. The expensive components would be the software-defined radio, the processing power to store and interrogate the pre-loaded map, and the sensor ball. Collectively, these are likely to bring a unit cost of up to $200,000 per airframe. Survivability would not just depend upon the relatively small radar cross-section of the platform and its slow flight but also on careful route planning. Persistent high-fidelity reconnaissance in this depth is not a mission that other capabilities reliably offer. Attempting to achieve similar effects with crewed rotary aviation is prohibitively risky. Furthermore, while a unit cost of $200,000 may sound expensive, it compares favourably with the kinds of air defence munitions that would be used to endeavour to intercept this class of UAV. As an enabler of reconnaissance and strike, such a capability is therefore probably the easiest to justify as a stand-alone capability, with minimal overlap with other means of collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a strong tendency with these platforms to complicate them by expanding the effects they can offer. The argument is that since the system can arrive over targets, why not enable it to prosecute them itself? The short answer is that munitions are heavy, and their carriage would significantly increase drag. The result would be a substantially larger platform and in practice this would see a spiralling increase in cost, with a corresponding decrease in survivability. This is why strike-capable UAVs with these ranges rapidly see costs rise into the millions of dollars, such as Turkey’s TB2. Beyond a more favourable rate of exchange, such UAVs also begin to expose themselves more to threat systems; additionally, command and control at such depth is difficult to ensure, increasing the requirements for autonomy and further increasing cost and complexity. On balance, it usually makes sense to separate ISR from strike if the aim is to keep the airframe light and cheap, and to maximise volume of the capability at a price point that prohibits many adversary systems from risking illumination to prioritise engaging them. The separation of UAVs into task modules is a common architectural approach known as “separation of concerns”, and it delivers a more modular, resilient complex of systems that is more survivable than a monolithic module. A significant exception to this is where the UAV can carry non-kinetic payloads. Using its software-defined radio, if mounting a suitable antenna, such a UAV can collect both ELINT and SIGINT, or be a vector for electronic attack. Modularity of payload makes this an option, but it would not be a routine mission set, not least because the effects would be bespoke. New systems are constantly being developed by NATO nations, and consequently smaller ELINT and SIGINT devices are emerging, meaning that the weight penalty of such capabilities is decreasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deep-strike&quot;&gt;Deep Strike&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to reach and strike targets in strategic depth with a mass precision strike complex offers the potential to add to enemy operational-level dilemmas, and to combine a range of new effects with existing but contested air force mission sets. The transit times inherent in long-range strike over hundreds of kilometres make it impractical to target mobile assets in a dynamic way using such systems. Thus, in terms of navigation complexity, a system only has to be capable of navigating accurately to a pre-planned location. As detailed in Chapter I, there are many different approaches to this challenge, with cost and complexity increasing significantly if the system needs to be able to operate independently of GPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To travel hundreds of kilometres into enemy territory, systems must carry significant fuel reserves, a robust automated navigation system, and a sizeable warhead to allow them to have an effect on targets commensurate with their cost. This means that even systems optimised for cost efficiency over speed or sophistication, such as the first generations of the propeller-driven Iranian Shahed-136, cost upwards of $30,000 and weigh around 200 kg. Russia has significantly hardened and upgraded the platform over several iterations, but has also brought the production cost up to around $80,000. Thus, the targets that are being attacked in strategic depth will generally be deliberately targeted according to a centralised process, rather than being selected ad hoc. Moreover, whereas tactical engagements can be rapidly exploited, effects in strategic depth generally take weeks, months or even years to have a decisive effect on an opposing state’s capacity to fight. All the while, defence systems and tactics will adapt, meaning that simply massing a single type of long-range strike effector is unlikely to generate decisive effects before defensive tactics evolve to mitigate its ability to reach targets reliably. Instead, the navigation, guidance and terminal behaviour of mass long-range strike systems will need to iterate to stay ahead of hostile defence system adaptation during a campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of strike methodologies, the two approaches visible in Ukraine (used by both sides) are dispersed targeting with single platforms, and massed salvos to overwhelm defences at key defended sites. The mission requirements for dispersed targeting with single platforms are simple and can consequently be met with comparatively cheap effectors. With the 50 kg warheads that can be carried by affordable propeller-driven systems such as Shahed-136, accuracy to within several metres is required for reliable destructive effects on specific facilities or installations. With this accuracy, however, it is possible to supplement the destructive effects of a wider long-range strike campaign by using cheap precision strike effectors to hit targets that are not valuable enough to warrant using an expensive cruise missile or penetrating air strike, but still add to national warfighting and logistics capacity. This will force an opposing force to either spread out air defences, reducing coverage at critical sites, or accept significant attrition and/or logistics inefficiency over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second strike methodology is to mass deep strike effectors with systems launched and mission planned to arrive at a more valuable and heavily defended target simultaneously. This requires complex mission planning, navigation and potentially datalink capabilities, if weapons are to coordinate their behaviour as a swarm in flight. These attributes raise unit cost, and also reduce the number of such strike operations that can be conducted in any given span of time with a given amount of resources. However, use of relatively affordable long-range precision effects en masse can present opponents with serious air defence dilemmas in terms of terminal lethality and interceptor missile consumption over time if used as part of a wider deep strike campaign alongside more traditional assets. The systems likely to be affordable at scale in a sustained way will probably not have complex radar cross-section reduction features or defensive aids suites, or be capable of complex or very high-speed terminal flight behaviour. This ensures that they are individually relatively easy to shoot down using conventional short-ranged air defence (SHORAD) systems such as Gepard, Tor or Pantsir. However, the threat that they can pose if allowed to get through to fixed logistics infrastructure, airbases, maintenance depots or other fixed nodes means that air defences must engage them. If enough arrive at once, some may get through due to defensive systems being overwhelmed or running short of ready-to-fire interceptor ammunition. If used to directly attack defensive systems, or launched alongside aerial decoys that complicate the positioning of air defences, such saturation attacks can also improve the mission success rates for more expensive and scarce cruise missiles or penetrating combat aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The potential of massed long-range precision strike effectors to be used as a key enabler for a wider strategic air and missile strike campaign would be greatly increased if the effectors were able to actively target air and missile defence systems. However, this requires active seekers, since most modern air defence systems are at least semi-mobile and will frequently reposition between different pre-set locations even when defending a fixed site. EO/IR seekers with sufficient processing power behind them to recognise, categorise and home in on air defence assets, or more sophisticated anti-radiation homing or millimetric radar seekers, are all technically possible additions to a long-range precision strike platform. However, all will greatly increase the cost to many times the figures associated with more basic fixed-target coordinate-attack systems such as Shahed-136. The efficient propeller or even small turbojet powerplants that can provide sufficient range in a relatively compact and affordable platform also limit the terminal survivability of such systems. Therefore, given that most Russian air defence systems are capable of intercepting much more challenging targets, such as AGM-88 HARM missiles, large numbers of propeller or jet-powered effectors would be needed to have a high probability of kill against aware air defence systems. At that point, it may become less competitive, in terms of cost, than simply investing a similar amount of money in increasing stocks of existing air-launched munitions natures designed for destruction of enemy air defences. A cheaper option would be for ISR UAVs to designate targets for terminal guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering these trade-offs, therefore, the value of a long-range precision strike capability appears most evident either in being able to strike targets that do not in themselves justify the exposure or expenditure of more capable assets, or in how they contribute to complex strikes. In both cases, it is cheapness and simplicity that ultimately differentiate these systems, and so the target should be to design and acquire a point attack system with a unit cost below $100,000 that is sufficiently modular to allow its navigational logic to be altered and adapted to stay ahead of adversary hard counters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enabling-effects&quot;&gt;Enabling Effects&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a range of enabling effects likely to form part of the requirement set for a mass precision strike complex. The most obvious of these are communications and datalink relay assets, EW effectors, and decoys. In all cases, the mission requires a platform able to carry a sophisticated electronics payload, with the requisite power and cooling to enable its operation and sufficient power and fuel to keep it airborne at the required depth for a sustained period of time. Therefore, this category of assets is likely to be larger and more expensive than precision strike in the close or even over-the-horizon ISR classes. These assets are also likely to be fixed-wing and propeller-driven to enable slow, aerodynamically efficient flight at several thousand feet in order to provide good lines of sight to the various systems they are designed to interact with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For datalink/communications relay functions, the key parameters are likely to be endurance on station, signal transmission range and bandwidth capacity of onboard processors, and a modern digital software-defined radio suite with frequency agility to make it harder for hostile forces to degrade its functionality when the rest of the complex is operating. The payload is, therefore, likely to be significantly more valuable than the airframe and engine combination of the platform, and will represent the cost and manufacturing bottleneck for deployable numbers. However, since relay UAVs can generally operate back from the target location(s) being engaged by kinetic components of the complex, they are unlikely to be regular targets for kinetic engagements, and so are less likely to be lost in large numbers. However, the value of their payloads means that this class of UAV will need a robust automatic navigation and safe landing/recovery function to avoid being overly vulnerable to hostile electronic attack. The number of relay UAVs required, and their centrality to the functioning of a mass precision strike complex, will ultimately be determined by the level of automation built into other elements of the system. The more automated the search and strike functions of the complex are at various operational depths, the less reliance on very low-latency assured datalink connectivity there will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For EW effectors as part of a mass precision strike complex, platform size and power generation limitations are likely to require a stand-in approach, rather than a stand-off one. Due to the way that electromagnetic energy propagates, the closer an EW emitter is to the receiver it is attempting to jam, the less power it will require relative to the power output of the target. For small UAV-type platforms, therefore, stand-in jamming is likely to be the only viable approach to degrading key hostile systems such as surveillance and air defence radars. This means that not only must a precision effector carry a sophisticated electronic attack payload and sufficient power and cooling to operate it for the duration that the effect is required, but it must also carry this payload some distance inside hostile airspace. The penetration distances required will vary according to which components of the mass precision strike complex the EW effector is required to enable. However, as a rule, such systems will be more complex and more expensive than a kinetic effector with a similar range, propulsion and guidance/navigation configuration. Their effects must also be carefully tailored and tested to avoid interfering with the sensors and communications elements required for the rest of the precision strike complex to function as intended, or with any other joint force elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decoys carry a form of EW payload calibrated to send signals to hostile radars that make them generate false targets, thus making it harder for operators to discern and engage real ones. Just as with electronic attack assets, such payloads tend to be complex and expensive and to rely on a sophisticated national ELINT collection, analysis and mission data production capability to be effective. If such decoys are also intended to mimic larger combat aircraft or cruise missile targets, then they may also require more expensive jet propulsion and specialised airframe designs to enable them to fly at speeds and altitudes that are not easily identifiable as decoy tracks by hostile radar operators. Such decoys already exist as air- and ground-launched effects, and so the application of such techniques to a more novel massed precision effects complex would need to demonstrate a more convincing operational effect for significantly less investment compared with simply purchasing additional systems such as the US-made Miniature Air-Launched Decoy family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-fielding-the-mass-uav-precision-complex&quot;&gt;III. Fielding the Mass UAV Precision Complex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having outlined the parameters of the technologies that make up a mass precision strike complex, and the platforms involved, it becomes possible to outline the units of action, enablers and structures required to deliver these platforms at a tactically relevant scale. This chapter covers, therefore, the enabling capabilities necessary to operate a mass precision complex and the requisite units of action to field the systems. The chapter thereafter addresses some of the implications of technological trends for how the complex may function collaboratively. The last section covers the question of swarming, which is endlessly theorised but rarely detailed in terms of practical scale and purpose on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dependencies&quot;&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most fundamentally important capabilities for enabling the sustainable and effective employment of any mass precision strike complex is close-to-real-time monitoring of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) across the area of operations. Neither side can deny access to all parts of the EMS at all times, even if it possesses large quantities of advanced EW equipment. This is because denial of the EMS also affects friendly units, and because the emissions that enable wide-area and wide-spectrum jamming are easily identified and targeted. Therefore, even an adversary with EW superiority will have to leave parts of the spectrum open for use at certain times in certain places. The same applies to friendly EW effects being employed at the strategic, operational and tactical levels – effects being employed must be understood and deconflicted with massed precision complex operations to avoid electronic fratricide. Most small UAV losses on both sides in Ukraine are caused by EW rather than kinetic defences and, for both sides, fratricide accounts for a significant proportion of those losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, for effective mission planning and real-time command and control of a mass precision strike complex, the ability to map, interpret and respond to hostile and friendly EW effects and EMS usage in the round is a prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The degree of access to or denial of each band of the spectrum will vary geographically, as well as over time, due to the impact of EW asset location, geography and the altitude bands within which assets are operating. This means a requirement for granular information on the real-time use of the EMS over such a wide area that the only likely source of such data is orbital collection. Hence, a core dependency for fielding a mass precision strike complex is access to high-fidelity orbital EMS monitoring assets, suitable downlink and ground stations, and a processing and dissemination architecture to interpret the data gathered and rapidly push it out to units of action on or near the frontlines. However cheap the UAVs making up a mass precision strike complex might be, this EMS monitoring, analysis, dissemination and mission planning capability is unavoidably very expensive, and is something only states can currently achieve. Much less reliable EMS mapping can be achieved from ground systems, but it will not offer a comparable breadth of high-fidelity returns. One approach to building an EMS survey for deep strike missions in the absence of space-based collection is to use a scouting UAV to conduct dynamic, real-time safe route planning for follow-on salvos, a tactic already employed by Russia with Shahed-136 variants that push EMS and telemetry data to the weapon’s launch station. At the same time, such planning also relies on detailed and up-to-date terrain and feature mapping to allow flight paths to take into account terrain masking, obstacle avoidance and defences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survivability and effectiveness of all elements of a mass precision strike complex hinge on the effectiveness or otherwise of mission planning. The aim is to maximise mission effectiveness within the capability bounds of the various component assets while minimising loss rates likely to be suffered through risk mitigation. The level of dependency on detailed mission planning increases the further the penetration distances required into contested airspace. Routes must be more detailed, exposure to defence systems is more likely and sustained, and communications challenges are more likely to be encountered between operators and assets as penetration distances increase. Furthermore, the requirement to fly further means larger, more expensive platforms whose loss is more consequential than for small, short-range UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important planning input is up-to-date data on the location and activity of air defence assets within potential range of the route to be flown. Some will give away their location by actively scanning with long-range radars, but others will spend most of their time in a passive state or emitting at a power level or in a frequency band that makes long-range ELINT triangulation challenging. Thus, accurate intelligence on the laydown of hostile air defence assets requires fusing data from multiple orbital, stand-off and stand-in assets across all domains. All this information will feed into mission planning for navigation modes, flight routing and altitude profile, reversionary courses of action, and assumptions on connectivity to assets in flight for real-time control, re-tasking and data offboarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI and other less advanced automated processing tools have already made such planning far quicker and easier than it was in the past, and such advances will no doubt continue. Therefore, mission planning teams are likely over time to become significantly smaller and to require less specialised training to be capable. However, the core input data required cannot be generated by AI, so the dependency of mission planning tools on inputs such as up-to-date geospatial and EMS data will remain, regardless of how advanced the tools themselves become. This requirement also means that UAV operators need access to feeds derived from Above Secret capabilities, and so must be appropriately cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking lessons from the large-scale use of UAVs during the war in Ukraine has been the speed at which software, and sometimes hardware, must be iteratively adapted to retain operational utility. As of mid-2023, the average period of peak effectiveness for a newly deployed UAV navigation and/or control system on the battlefield was around two weeks, with degrading effectiveness over four more weeks. Between six and 12 weeks, the adversary would have gathered sufficient data on the waveforms and techniques being used to start effectively jamming and/or spoofing the system across the front. If a new UAV control technique is used near to a specialised counter-UAV EW asset such as the Russian Shipovnik-Aero, then the process of enemy adaptation is significantly faster – typically around two weeks. The development of AI-enabled signals analysis and EW signal development means that these timeframes for hostile adaptation against newly deployed UAV control and navigation techniques are likely to converge towards the shorter timeframe, with the primarily limitation being assurance of countermeasures and the distribution of mission data files across defensive systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, a mass precision strike complex will require organic software development teams. They will need to be empowered to rapidly iterate the software and signal types used for control and navigation in order to allow the systems that the units operate to remain effective in the face of rapid and continuous adversary adaptation. It also requires the military to have the intellectual property rights to interfere with and adjust the functioning of the system. Vendors must expose more controls to their systems in order to allow lower-level adjustments through intuitive interfaces, scripting abilities and clear, comprehensive documentation. There is also a fundamental requirement for modular platforms, where adjustments can be made to airframes or sensors can be swapped out in the field by design, rather than the currently fairly monolithic design seen in most systems. In many respects, the body of a UAV is the least important part of it, with the interfaces for wings and mission systems being critical. This rapid iteration of software and control signal frequency patterns will also need to be deconflicted with concurrent friendly-force EW efforts. Just as adversary EW techniques will be constantly adapting, friendly ones will need to do the same to remain effective against adversary UAVs, sensors and communications channels. The interplay between the constant development of EW and counter-EW software is likely to be one of the defining tests for forces seeking to effectively employ mass precision strike complexes, with the side that can better integrate and deconflict these efforts having a huge advantage. Systems which cannot be upgraded post-delivery to new radio and EW-related modules will quickly become obsolete. Equally, national regulatory and certification approaches that do not adapt to enable the required rapid pace of constant experimentation and adaptation will prevent those states from remaining competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scaling-effect&quot;&gt;Scaling Effect&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fielding a UAV is simple in technical – if not always in regulatory or acquisition – terms. In contrast, coordinating large numbers of UAVs so that strike systems arrive while an ISR UAV remains over the target, in an EW-contested environment where different systems have variable setup times and fly at different speeds, is a complex process. Having appropriate command and control links so that UAV operators can set up and plan missions for their UAVs drawing on the intelligence feeds outlined in the previous section means that employing these systems effectively is anything but simple. This section aims to outline hypothetical units of action to deliver scale of effect for the systems described in the previous chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For tactical ISR, these systems are organic capabilities within combat formations, with a density of around two UAVs per platoon. They will be attrited at a constant rate and must be resupplied. The main requirement is that the detections from these systems are not held at the platoon but are classified and passed up-echelon to the battalion or brigade command post. This could be through operators indicating what they observe; it can also be achieved by patching the feeds back via satellite uplink or other rebroadcasting systems. For mounted platoons, the ability to have the feed interrogated by a processor in order to generate detections means that what is offboarded could comprise a list of objects and locations – still images or even simple text – rather than full-motion video, reducing bandwidth requirements and helping with emissions control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond tactical ISR, the mission support necessary to maintain the efficiency of, and access to, trained operators, planning tools and maintenance favours grouping multiple UAV types into formations allocated to support parts of the front. This is consistent with lessons from Ukraine, where the efficiency of UAV operations when conducted by a dedicated formation has risen from 10% up to 70% for some mission sets. This is especially necessary if capabilities such as tactical strike are to scale. Although individual strikes may be called in because of detections from tactical formations, the scaling of effect requires a large salvo of strike platforms to converge simultaneously. Given the number of munitions identified in the previous chapter as optimal for immobilising a company group, we may hypothesise that a unit of action must be able to generate 24 strike UAVs simultaneously. Assuming approximate dimensions of 2 m in length and 40 cm width with folding wings, a pack of six such UAVs should be mountable on a tactical utility vehicle. A grouping of four such vehicles, each with three crew – a driver, a communicator and an operator – would make up a platoon. Operating in two pairs, this would allow peer recovery between the launch platforms, and for offset communications antennae to be established in two separate locations, helping to make the command link to the strike wave more resilient. This would also enable strike systems to converge on a target from different vectors without staggering launches. Given the need for repeat salvos, groupings of three such platoons comprising the tactical strike company of a UAV battalion would create units of action that could be assigned in support of frontages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep ISR requires a different tempo of launch and recovery. Although one UAV would be used to cover a given direction, the need to maintain an orbit generates a requirement for three UAVs to constitute a unit of action, with one being recovered, one being prepared for launch or transiting to station, and one in flight at any given time. Given a two-part disassembling wing construction and detachable tail, two airframes should fit in a tactical utility vehicle. Three platforms, therefore, should fit in two vehicles, with the spare space in the second vehicle taken up with ideally two antennae and the command and control equipment for the UAVs. A crew of three per vehicle could comprise a driver/mechanic, a communicator and sensor operator, and a pilot. This would allow one mechanic to prepare a UAV for launch and one to recover a UAV, while one operator and pilot pair rested or maintained communications with other force elements, and the other pilot and sensor operator focused on programming and flying a mission. Six such vehicle pairs could, therefore, generate six orbits in depth at surge, or three sustained orbits across the battlespace, comprising a deep reconnaissance company in a mass precision strike battalion, collectively surveying approximately 60 km of front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of effectors for a given deep strike will vary considerably based on the target set. However, the minimum size of the strike platforms and their requirements allows units of action to be described. Assuming an effector weighing between 140 kg and 200 kg with a warhead between 20 kg and 50 kg, it is reasonable to launch between eight and 12 effectors from a containerised set of canisters on a standard military truck. There is a trade-off, with folding wings allowing for more to be carried while adding some cost and complexity to the munition. In any case, a spring-based catapult in the canister allows accelerated launch. Assuming three such vehicles comprising a launch battery, with a fourth vehicle carrying tools, spare parts and communications equipment, a standard unit of action should be able to launch up to 36 munitions, with three separate launch positions. Premising the launch unit on standard military trucks helps to disguise the launchers. The cab would then require the ability to programme the route for the munitions. Each truck would be assumed to have three crew, comprising a driver, an engineer and a communications specialist. It would be assumed that the battalion would field three platoons of such launchers, forming a deep strike company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final two companies in a mass precision strike battalion have several important functions. First, there is a logistics company, responsible for resupplying the different elements. Along with a platoon supporting each UAV company, the logistics company would also need a platoon responsible for fabricating and fitting parts and repairing and modifying UAVs. The second company would comprise the intelligence and headquarters company. This company would require a headquarters element and an intelligence platoon responsible for liaising with wider headquarters to plan mission sets and strikes, and for plotting flight paths. It would also need a software development platoon responsible for harvesting and analysing mission data from across the formation, patching systems, updating mission data files, and designing novel algorithms to enable concepts of employment. Finally, there would be the novel effects platoon, responsible for designing enabling effects and integrating them into payloads. This platoon would also be responsible for employing bespoke UAVs delivering enabling effects. Thus, the full battalion constitutes five companies: a deep ISR company, a close strike company, a deep strike company, an intelligence and headquarters company, and a support company. The reason to group these capabilities is that although different elements may be assigned to various lines of effort, the need to train and certify, and the requirement for supporting enablers to persistently use UAVs, make the administrative concentration of the capabilities sensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;swarming-and-the-impact-of-autonomy&quot;&gt;Swarming and the Impact of Autonomy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple working definitions of swarming as a capability, but for the purposes of this study, the term will be used to refer to UAVs that are networked together to allow the exchange of data and coordination of behaviour in flight between four or more assets simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swarming capabilities are commonly touted as the most significant area of capability development in the small UAV defence sector. However, the requirement to swarm introduces significant hardware and software complexity, which in turn drives cost growth and reduces the number of individual assets that can be fielded for any given budget. Massed UAV groupings, as seen regularly in light shows at civilian displays, rely on a ground control station tracking the position of all UAVs in a formation at all times and a central mission computer sending commands to each one to coordinate their movements. This allows large numbers of very simple small UAVs to fly in a coordinated fashion, but it is not a practical approach for military UAVs and weapons in a contested battlespace, due to terrain masking, EW, signal range and emissions control challenges – the ground control station would be struck, decapitating the whole swarm. Instead, for a mass precision strike complex to be capable of swarming tactics, the individual assets involved must have onboard sensors and low-latency datalinks that are resistant to hostile EW disruption. In addition, each asset must carry a mission computer powerful enough, and software complex enough, to fuse the information about terrain, threats and targets received from its own sensors and those of other UAVs in the formation through datalinks, and to react to that information dynamically in real time. These capabilities are not inherently new, nor are they reliant on advances in AI or complex machine learning models. However, what the requirements for sensors, datalinks and advanced software do is raise component costs, even if used with an inherently cheap airframe/engine combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if a mass precision strike system is premised on swarming tactics for its effectiveness against its core target sets, then the number of assets required to use it in a sustained fashion will be increased, due to the need to consistently project sufficient assets into the target area to swarm. In conjunction with the increased hardware and software complexity required, this requirement to sustainably field swarming UAVs in large quantities over time means that fielding this sort of system as more than a “Night One” theatre entry tool is likely to be uneconomical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of where swarming capabilities are likely to add value commensurate with the additional cost implied by their inclusion as part of a precision strike complex, the primary application will be to improve the capability to overwhelm air defence systems. The most effective way to overwhelm air defence systems is to present them with multiple simultaneous threats from different directions. This is especially effective against SHORAD systems that use automatic cannons, or directionally mounted missile racks rather than vertical-launch missile racks. Directional systems such as Gepard or Pantsir must traverse their turret in the direction of each incoming threat to engage them sequentially, which takes time, even if the air defence system’s radar or other sensors can track 360°. However, it is also important to note that mission planning can achieve this sort of effect against defences protecting fixed sites without needing assets capable of swarming behaviour. Russian attacks with Shahed-136s frequently present Ukrainian defences with this challenge by simply sequencing launches and route planning so that multiple UAVs arrive at the target area from different directions near-simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other advantages of swarming capabilities are that they can help reduce wasted warheads by deconflicting target selection so that multiple assets do not hit the same target. However, doing so in a way that can differentiate between a target having been hit and successfully disabled versus a target having been hit ineffectively and thus requiring a repeat strike with another asset requires significantly more advanced sensor and processing capabilities than simple deconfliction. Ultimately, for target deconfliction and strike optimisation, the value added question will come down to whether the additional efficiency against defended and undefended target sets gained from functional swarming capabilities outweighs the strike weight foregone by the increase in individual asset cost and the resultant reduction in quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some collaborative behaviours that fall short of swarming, but which may be worthwhile. A long-range mass strike using UAVs is most effective when defensive systems have minimal time to respond, and it is therefore advantageous for the UAVs to fly low; however, if there is any requirement for communications, then low-altitude flight makes it much harder to maintain a command link. This can be resolved if one UAV flies at a high altitude and acts as a relay for those below. If the relay bird is shot down, a different UAV can rise to take station. In a context without a command link, higher-altitude flight may also allow one UAV to use navigational techniques that are not possible during lower-altitude flight, such as astral navigation. In this way, periodic lifts by one UAV may allow it to reconfirm its position and then calibrate the position of other UAVs such that inertial navigation remains accurate. So long as UAVs have software-defined radios, this kind of behaviour is relatively straightforward. It is the same functionality that is built into Russian anti-ship cruise missiles, which have one loft to search for targets while the majority retain a sea-skimming profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has laid out the primary dependencies and variables involved in designing and fielding a mass precision strike complex using UAVs as a core part of a modern Western land force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary conclusion is that there are significantly more aggressive trade-offs and costs involved in creating a massed UAV precision strike capability that can form a core part of a land force, as opposed to one that can function as a niche tool set for specific use cases. The land forces of a medium power such as the UK must be able to reliably conduct operations in a wide range of operational environments and conditions. It is no good, therefore, relying on massed precision strike effects for core capabilities if the systems that deliver those effects do not function reliably in bad weather, extreme temperatures, at night or in an EMS-contested environment. As outlined in Chapter I, it is possible to fit UAVs with sensors and navigation, mission system and airframe features that allow them to operate in such conditions. However, if those requirements are seen as essential, then said sensors, navigation suites and mission systems will themselves add significant cost to each asset, even if the airframes can be produced cheaply en masse by additive manufacturing or reliance on the civil sector. Furthermore, once expensive sensors, payloads and hardware are added, the economic case for investing in propulsion and airframe features that will enhance survivability (but further increase costs) is strengthened, since the loss of each cheap airframe will be accompanied by the loss of expensive components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, developing and exploiting the capabilities potentially offered by mass precision strike complexes is not simply a matter of achieving a viable cost-per-effect in specific scenarios. No investment in military forces in the modern world comes without opportunity costs, since budget and personnel resources allocated to realising the capability must be diverted from other things. In other words, the use case for mass precision strike complexes must not only be predicated on finding mission areas where they can be sustainably procured and used at scale within available funding. They must also represent a better return on investment than other weapons systems and effectors to which resources and personnel are already/could alternatively be dedicated. This must also hold true in all likely operational scenarios that the joint force might be called upon to fight in, if such capabilities are to be fielded at scale as a core force element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in AI and software development are radically reducing the cost of achieving various levels of capability in terms of mission planning, mission systems and sensor exploitation. However, these advances come with their own – sometimes onerous – hardware and onboard power requirements, and they do not change core trade-offs in other areas. For instance, battery and fuel energy storage density is not increasing at a rapid enough rate over time to radically alter the core relationship between a platform’s size and its potential range, endurance, transit speed and payload capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One enduring debate regarding UAVs is the extent to which they should be operated by a specialist community, as opposed to being distributed widely. The conclusion of this study is that UAVs may be distributed to provide units with situational awareness, but mass precision strike should be managed by a specialist formation. This is not only because of the significant improvement in effectiveness achievable with skilled mission planning. Experience from contemporary theatres shows that almost all UAV capabilities are highly susceptible to hard counters as the adversary learns how the UAV functions; capabilities must therefore be continuously adapted and their supporting mission data files updated. This requires scarce skills such as UAV design and programming and the accumulation of data centrally. It therefore makes sense to concentrate UAV operation if UAVs are parts of a mass precision strike complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this paper has argued that there are limitations on mass precision strike efficiency when compared with legacy strike systems, it has demonstrated that against targets that lack proper defences, UAVs offer a means to achieve extremely disproportionate attrition. If they are cheap, UAVs can also impose substantial inefficiency on enemy logistics and enablement. It follows that forces are likely to endeavour to field counter-UAV capabilities, which, like mass precision strike capabilities, impose an opportunity cost on the force. Since the UAVs making up a mass precision strike complex are also available to potential state adversaries and non-state armed groups, Western militaries will need to develop and field counter-UAV and integrated air defence capabilities at scale. This paper has not addressed how counter-UAV capabilities are to be fielded. The development of counter-UAV capability will be the subject of the second study in this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final observation that arises from this paper is that most NATO states lack the regulatory structures to be able to field and maintain a competitive mass UAV precision strike complex. This paper has demonstrated what features and capabilities can be used to make UAVs survivable and able to achieve their mission, but almost all techniques are contestable. In this context, preserving the effects deliverable at scale through UAVs over the course of the fight requires constant updates, the adjustment of tactics, techniques and procedures, airframe and payload optimisation and software changes. In Ukraine, this process can, at its most intense, take place in 48-hour cycles. Since most NATO members treat UAVs as aircraft and therefore require their re-certification whenever they are modified if they are to be flown for testing, it follows that NATO’s regulatory structures render it almost impossible to adapt the necessary capabilities at the speed of relevance. This paper, by setting out the processes required to field those capabilities, hopefully provides a realistic outline of what must be permissible if NATO forces are to retain military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李宇軒：從未與黎智英見面或交談、「重光團隊」靠眾籌運作無收黎錢&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HGctlcq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（10日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第57日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。在辯方的盤問下，李表示：「我冇見過黎智英」，也從沒以任何形式與他交談。李亦確認，他本人及「重光團隊（SWHK）」沒有接收過黎智英或其助手 Mark Simon 任何錢。就 SWHK 的性質，李確認它是一個鬆散、沒有會章的組織，成員之間的共同點是「想去為香港爭取自由民主」。此外，對於辯方形容 SWHK 是一個草根階層、依靠眾籌來營運的倡議組織（grassroots crowdfunded advocacy group），李表示同意。惟法官李運騰指李廿多歲的時候戶口便有300萬元積蓄，質疑他依然形容自己是「草根」，李則回答：「冇諗過呢個問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第14天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行完成主問，接著由代表黎智英的大律師 Marc Corlett 盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱從沒見過黎智英沒任何直接溝通&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱從沒見過黎智英、沒任何直接溝通&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問李宇軒與黎智英是否從來沒有見面，李回答：「我冇見過黎智英。」辯方續問，李是否從來沒有與黎交談過，李表示不論是電話、線上會議還是其他方式都好，他沒有與黎交談過。李亦確認，在2020年7月1日《國安法》生效之前，他與黎沒有任何直接的溝通，《國安法》之後也沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱僅見過mark-simon一次-國安法前後均沒接觸&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱僅見過Mark Simon一次 國安法前後均沒接觸&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於黎的私人助手 Mark Simon ，李早前供稱 2019年9月29日會見訪港的美議員斯科特（Rick Scott）的時候，有同場見過 Mark Simon。李今在辯方的盤問下，確認該場合是他第一次，也是唯一一次見過 Mark Simon。李另確認，他從來沒有透過電話或者視像通話與 Mark Simon 交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;電郵方面，李則指在另一名被告陳梓華與 Mark Simon 在一系列電郵商討墊支款項時，李不肯定陳有否副本抄送至他的電郵。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp 群組方面，辯方指李宇軒與 Mark Simon 的共同群組只有「Coffee on Sunday」和「Sunday Meeting」，兩個群組均是因為會見美議員斯科特而開設。辯方問，除了電郵和 WhatsApp 群組之外，李在2020年7月1日《國安法》生效之前，便沒有與 Mark Simon 有任何接觸。李同意。辯方續問，《國安法》生效之後，李與 Mark Simon 也沒有任何接觸。李同意：「完全冇聯繫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指mark-simon就會見美議員沒有給予指示&quot;&gt;李宇軒指Mark Simon就會見美議員沒有給予指示&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指，上述兩個 WhatsApp 群組僅談論會見斯科特的安排。李則把兩個群組內容總結為會面流程安排、人選及「見面講啲咩」。辯方指，群組從沒談論制裁、封鎖或禁售人群管理武器等話題，李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，Mark Simon 從沒有在群組中指示或要求李去做什麼事。惟法官杜麗冰指，Mark Simon 的確有在群組中提及見到斯科特時要說什麼。李則回答，他同意群組入面談論的都是流程和建議，但不是「指示」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦同意辯方所指，他們會見斯科特的目的是讓他知道更多香港情況。他亦有在會面期間跟斯科特說美國可以做一些事，但沒有提及任何特定行動，也沒有同場人士提及美國可做什麼特定行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指 Mark Simon 在該次會面中基本上發言不多，李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認重光團隊從沒接收黎智英或mark-simon的錢&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認「重光團隊」從沒接收黎智英或Mark Simon的錢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒早前作供提及2019年8月的第三次眾籌「G攬運動」，Mark Simon 借出其美國銀行帳戶接收眾籌平台的180萬美元款項，然後轉帳至「The Project Hong Kong Trust」的戶口。李宇軒又提及 Mark Simon 仍有欠款，因此整理相關帳戶後傳送給另一名被告陳梓華（網名T）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;財務收支紀錄顯示，Mark Simon 在2019年9月30日從眾籌平台「Gofundme」接收約170萬美元，然後分別在2019年11月4日、2020年1月7日和2月3日，把款項分三筆還給「The Project Hong Kong Trust」，亦在2019年11月21日將50萬美元轉帳至李宇軒的戶口。該紀錄顯示 Mark Simon 仍拖欠約26,000美元，需要歸還給「The Project Hong Kong Trust」。李宇軒庭上指，他曾叫陳梓華安排 Mark Simon 還款，但是因為在陳著手處理之前已經被拘捕，所以最後不了了之。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就 Mark Simon 轉帳給他的50萬美元，李宇軒指它本質上並非 Mark Simon 的錢，而是「The Project Hong Kong Trust」的錢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，在2019年9月30日之後，除了獲歸還曾經墊支的款項50萬美元之外，李便沒有接收過 Mark Simon 或與其有聯繫的人的任何錢。李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，李亦沒有接收過黎智英任何錢。李回應：「從來都冇。」辯方續指，李亦沒有接收過力高顧問有限公司、Lais Hotel Property Limited、Chartwell Holding Limited ，或任何與黎有聯繫的人士或公司的錢。李確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK），李確認據他所知，在2019年9月30日之後，SWHK 沒有從黎智英、Mark Simon 或與他們有聯繫的人士接收過任何款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方指成立信託基金乃由swhk成員而非mark-simon提出&quot;&gt;辯方指成立信託基金乃由SWHK成員而非Mark Simon提出&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前作供提及，Mark Simon 答應借用戶口接收眾籌款項時，提議在美國開設一個信託基金來儲存款項，以避開款項遭香港銀行凍結的風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方今展示李於2019年9月傳送給陳梓華的電郵，當中列出尋找願意接收眾籌款項的人選期間面對的困難，其中一點提到網名「Surely」的美國 SWHK 成員 Shirley Ho 不能接收眾籌款項，因為對於她及其家人過於冒險；Shirley Ho 研究相關法例後提議可以成立一個非牟利的機構（non-profit entity）去接收眾籌款項，以及作日後用途。辯方指，成立信託基金這個主意其實是由 Shirley Ho 提出的。李同意，不過同時指 Shirley Ho 當時僅提及非牟利機構。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指swhk是鬆散組織-成員共同點是為香港爭取自由民主&quot;&gt;李宇軒指SWHK是鬆散組織 成員共同點是為香港爭取自由民主&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前作供時形容 SWHK 是一個鬆散的組織、定義含糊而且沒有會章。李再次確認：「佢（SWHK）係一個 loose 嘅 organisation，佢係一個冇 articles（會章）嘅 organisation ，佢入面大家嘅 common ground 係想去為香港爭取自由民主。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示李宇軒在 Telegram 傳送給自己的訊息，當中提到 SWHK 本身有很多定義，包括「SWHK元祖」、「SWHK JP」、「SWHK global」和、「SWHK UK」。辯方問「SWHK元祖」是代表什麼，李則指一開始籌辦「中英聯合聲明登報」期間，組員之間投票選出「Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong」口號作為團體的名稱，並以這個團體的名義登報，從而引申出來的概念便是「SWHK元祖」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李提到因為 SWHK 不是一個有會章或正確的組織，若果不同的人認同某個 SWHK 的身份的話，例如 SWHK 或 SWHK Japan，就會由他們個人自行決定去認同這個「label」。在不同活動之中，也會交給不同行動者自行決定以哪一個身份去參與活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官質疑李宇軒廿多歲有300萬仍說自己是草根&quot;&gt;法官質疑李宇軒廿多歲有300萬仍說自己是「草根」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，沒有任何人能夠壟斷 SWHK 的名義。李回應：「冇人。」李官又指，人們可以自己決定以什麼名義參與，李宇軒確認：「係。」李又補充，因為當時香港的運動是「無大台（decentralised）」，所以會有如此的現象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指，SWHK 沒有正式會員架構、沒有會員登記制度，或者需要經任何程序去認證會員身份。李表示：「同意呢個。」辯方又形容 SWHK 是一個草根階層、依靠眾籌來營運的倡議組織（grassroots crowdfunded advocacy group）。李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時法官李運騰打斷，指李宇軒廿多歲的時候戶口便有300萬元積蓄，但李依然形容自己是「草根」嗎？李沉默數秒後，才回答：「冇諗過呢個問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認swhk無任何領導架構-成員可選擇不參與活動&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認SWHK無任何領導架構 成員可選擇不參與活動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在辯方盤問下，李同意不同 SWHK 成員，不論是以網名或是真名示人也好，都會就如何達成 SWHK 目標表達不同意見。辯方續指，SWHK 並沒有任何領導架構，李同意沒有，不過隨著時間過去，一些比較活躍的成員傾向在不同活動中都會提出意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方又指，若果有成員對某個活動不支持，大可以不參與。李回答，他們可以選擇不參加活動，或者去說服其他人不去籌辦該活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又確認，他可以自行決定是否參與某個活動，當中取決於很多理由，其中一個理由是他是否同意該活動，另一個因素是視乎他有否技能協助到活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方指李不能主導 SWHK 成員的意見。李同意：「我唔可以 dictate，我只可以同大家傾㗎啫。」辯方續指，其他人亦不能主導 SWHK，正如李剛才提到這是一個「無大台」的組織（decentralised organisation）。李則表示：「呢個係其中一個方面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒同意陳梓華屬年輕一代-但不知道陳是否視自己為swhk成員之一&quot;&gt;李宇軒同意陳梓華屬年輕一代 但不知道陳是否視自己為SWHK成員之一&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前供稱曾獲時任英國駐港領事賀恩德（Andy Heyn）邀請到其住所參與會議，同場的民主黨創黨主席李柱銘和前政務司司長陳方安生代表「老一啲嘅民主派」；時任立法會議員郭榮鏗和莫乃光「就喺中間」，而李自己就是「再後生嘅 generation」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問李，可否形容 SWHK 為年輕一代的一員？李表示，就他所認識的 SWHK 成員，「佢哋的確大部份係年輕一代」，例如「攬炒巴」劉祖廸是其中之一。至於一些只透過網名溝通的成員，李指憑他們的說話方式、感覺和觀點，似乎都符合他對「年輕一代」的印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰聞言指，如果他們不是年輕的話，他們也是心態上年輕（young at heart）。法官李素蘭問及李何時出生，李回答他在1990年出生。李素蘭又問，在李眼中，是否在1990年以後出生的人就是年輕人。李則說：「我諗冇乜 definition，望落去 young。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官問另一名被告陳梓華是否算年輕人。李則表示，如果把陳都視為 SWHK 成員的話「佢都係年輕一代」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方追問陳梓華是否 SWHK 成員，李指如果陳視自己為 SWHK 成員的話，「我就當係」；但如果陳覺得自己只是個人或者義工「咁我冇得話佢係 SWHK」。李指他沒有與陳討論過這個問題，不過二人過往在交談期間，陳似乎將 SWHK 和李「擺埋喺同一邊」。李表示簡而言之他不知道陳視自己為 SWHK 一員與否。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方李宇軒和陳梓華都是年輕人-均對民主運動有興趣-所以保持聯繫&quot;&gt;辯方：李宇軒和陳梓華都是年輕人 均對民主運動有興趣 所以保持聯繫&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒另確認他本來在網上認識陳梓華，之後透過 Telegram 保持聯絡，就共同感興趣的話題討論和互相交流觀點。辯方指，陳就如李一樣都是年輕一代，或心態上年輕。李同意：「係，同埋佢仲後生過我。」辯方續指，除了年輕以外，二人均對於香港的民主運動感興趣，所以二人之間有連結（connection）和共同點（common ground）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過辯方指，根據李早前的證供，陳屬於「前線的人」，而李則屬於「較後線的人」，因此二人不會就所有問題都討論。李同意，例如 IPAC 正式公布成立之前，他遵守保密承諾而沒有告訴陳，又指「唔係全部嘅活動都有同T傾」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方盤問未完，案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李宇軒與陳梓華曾討論籌組流亡政府 陳因人脈廣被懷疑是「肥佬黎嘅仔」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/86XFLp2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（9日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第56日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。2020年7月，李與另一名被告陳梓華曾經透過 Signal 訊息討論在外地籌組「流亡政府」，前提是需要找人願意「浮上枱面做枱面人」，期間李和陳均有考慮擔任「枱面人」，惟陳告訴李如果他做「枱面人」，可能會面臨政治檢控或政治迫害。至同年8月10日，黎智英被警方拘捕，李指一些 Telegram 群組成員覺得陳的人脈甚廣（well connected），懷疑他是「肥佬黎嘅仔」，於是討論「洗唔洗踢肥佬黎個仔出 TG group」。李又指，二人不時討論應否離開香港，陳曾向李表示，作為一名領袖需要留下直至最後一刻，反問「走走走，我若離開，誰來帶隊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第13天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒若做枱面人或面臨政治檢控或迫害&quot;&gt;李宇軒：若做「枱面人」或面臨政治檢控或迫害&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方昨日展示李宇軒與另一名被告陳梓華（網名T）之間的 Signal 對話，當中陳問李：「你安排好哂香港D野未」、「你去打最終件事會係你身邊所有人都會照肺」；李則回覆「我搞掂咗要搞嘅家人s」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李今再解釋，陳之所以問他「安排好哂香港D野未」，是因為香港有政治壓迫，無論他選擇留在香港還是離開都好，他都需要處理好香港的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指二人的對話中提及前「青年新政」成員梁頌恆、前「香港民族黨」召集人陳浩天、前英國駐港總領事館職員鄭文傑、前「本土民主前線」發言人黃台仰以及梁繼平，李宇軒又提到他去聯合國會見職員，李官問二人在怎樣的情況下討論上述話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李回答有兩方面，第一是他當時與陳梓華討論他的個人未來方向，包括在譚競嫦（Sharon Hom）的組織「中國人權」工作，或者跟裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）協助 IPAC（對華政策跨國議會聯盟）的工作；第二方面是陳梓華認為 SWHK 需要轉型。李指本來二人討論 SWHK，之後討論到國際和社運形勢，後來他和陳梓華得出結論是有樽頸位（bottle neck）或權力真空（power vacuum）的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，他們然後討論會否推舉一個「枱面人」，可以對運動提供推動力，後來結論是需要一個「枱面人」，二人繼而討論誰人適合擔任「枱面人」，所以陳在之後的訊息中指「你去打最終件事會係你身邊所有人都會照肺」，意思是如果李「浮上枱面做枱面人」的話，可能會面臨政治檢控或政治迫害。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指另一被告陳梓華亦曾考慮做枱面人&quot;&gt;李宇軒指另一被告陳梓華亦曾考慮做「枱面人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰好奇一問，為何陳梓華沒有自動請纓做「枱面人」。李則指陳有考慮過，所以在之前的訊息中，當李說：「數完一圈⋯⋯總結無人」，陳便回覆：「Shit」、「咁我做啦屌」，不過陳隨即說：「唔係喎」、「仲有本記（本土派）果班問過未？」李指陳有考慮過，只是想先詢問本土派有沒有人願意做「枱面人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指枱面人需離開香港籌組流亡政府&quot;&gt;李宇軒指「枱面人」需離開香港籌組「流亡政府」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李提到，當他們找到「枱面人」之後，該「枱面人」需要離開香港，在外地籌組「流亡政府」。法官李運騰聞言一度問：「這討論是否認真？」不過李指，因為找不到「枱面人」，所以最後沒有結論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官指，二人的訊息討論是在2020年7月23日，當時《港區國安法》已經生效，問李宇軒為何仍然考慮是否做「枱面人」。李表示，「因為唔企出嚟嘅話，香港依然會畀中國共產黨操控嘅政權統治，所以已經跌入咗一個有政治迫害嘅環境入面，即係已經夠差。」李官續問，在如此的情況下，李依然討論在香港以外籌組流亡政府？李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李並指，籌組流亡政府有兩個先決條件，一是要離開香港，因為若果留在香港的話，「會畀香港政府冚佢檔。」另一個條件是要有「枱面人」，「因為淨係得枱底人嘅流亡政府，係唔會有人 take it seriously。」李指，如果有流亡政府的話，會以流亡政府的名義進行國際游說，但是如果沒有的話，亦可以繼續以個人名義做國際游說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒黎智英被捕後-有組員懷疑陳梓華是肥佬黎嘅仔&quot;&gt;李宇軒：黎智英被捕後 有組員懷疑陳梓華是「肥佬黎嘅仔」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年8月10日早上，黎智英等人被拘捕。李宇軒在 Signal 傳送訊息給陳梓華，指有組員問是否需要把陳「踢出」 Telegram 群組，「因為肥佬黎出咗事」；陳其後回覆「No need」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QaDopl9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黎智英（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李庭上解釋，他當時向陳轉達 Telegram 群組成員的說話，有人覺得陳的 Telegram 帳戶「太過 well connected」，並且「估計呢度係咪有個人係肥佬黎嘅仔」。當時黎智英被警方國安處拘捕，因此組員討論「洗唔洗踢肥佬黎個仔出 TG group」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華稱作為領袖需留至最後一刻-反問我若離開誰來帶隊&quot;&gt;陳梓華稱作為領袖需留至最後一刻 反問「我若離開，誰來帶隊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，陳向李表示，作為一名領袖，他需要留下直至最後一刻，「走走走，我若離開，誰來帶隊」；李則回應自己只是純粹轉達組員的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李庭上解釋，每當有人被拘捕，的確有人叫他及其他仍在香港的人離開，因為他曾經數次使用真名行事。法官李素蘭問到，陳梓華訊息提及「帶隊」，而李是否其中一個隊員？李則表示，他並不屬於任何一個陳梓華所帶領的團隊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到二人此前有否討論過離開香港，李指相關話題「耐唔耐有浮過出嚟」，因為這並不是一個特別的話題，時不時便會討論，「好似晏晝食飯食咩呀呢種 topic」，討論內容大多圍繞應否離港、離港之後可以做什麼等等。李表示，不論他是否有任何罪名，預計到香港政權總會想到辦法去拘捕他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，陳梓華在同日下午約3時半傳送訊息給李宇軒，叫李離開香港，留下陳一個在香港，因為承受不了國際線再失去多一人（“Brother, leave me here - we can’t afford one more lost in international line.”）。李表示印象中他在同日大約中午時份被拘捕，所以陳傳送上述訊息給他時，「啲差佬搜緊我屋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒提供立法會選舉被dq名單-並協助把ipac聲明翻譯成日文&quot;&gt;李宇軒提供立法會選舉被DQ名單 並協助把IPAC聲明翻譯成日文&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示 Telegram 群組「SWHK IPAC」的訊息紀錄，就原定於2020年9月舉行的立法會選舉（後來政府以疫情為由取消），李宇軒轉發「氣象巴打」的帖文及被 DQ 候選人的名單，包括黃之鋒、劉頴匡、何桂藍、岑敖暉、袁嘉蔚、梁晃維及公民黨的楊岳橋等。後來裴倫德把草擬好的聲明傳送至群組，題為「Statement on the obstruction of the democratic process ahead of the 2020 Hong Kong Legislative Council Elections（就2020年香港立法會選舉阻撓民主進程的聲明）」。李確認他在群組提供了被DQ名單之後，IPAC 等人才開始撰寫聲明，然後李和其他在日港人一起把聲明翻譯成日文。&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, a systematic analysis of the entire chip smuggling pipeline, from initial procurement to unlawful distribution, remains conspicuously absent.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;This study aims to bridge that methodological gap. It dissects the smuggling pipeline into four distinct stages: (1) initial procurement; (2) evasion of customs controls; (3) port exit; and (4) transshipment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report advocates for a first-principles approach in assessing export control evasion risks. Estimates should be anchored on specific vulnerabilities within the supply chain and actual smuggling tactics. To this end, this report identifies 11 potential tactics across the smuggling pipeline. It finds that export control evasion is likely more prevalent than suspected due to an underappreciation of the range and dimensionality of individual smuggling tactics. Importantly, the compounding risk profile that emerges when multiple tactics are layered together is underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, this report observes that as soon as illicit goods depart the port of origin and get buried in transshipment networks, untangling the knotted snarl becomes impractical. As such, policymakers should focus on interventions upstream in the smuggling pipeline. In addition, this report suggests a reorientation in how export control compliance should be approached. Rather than fixating on who to bar from the game, regulators should shift their focus toward who gets to play, moving from a system of exclusion based on the reactive blacklisting of suspicious entities to a system of inclusion built on preapprovals. This will be implemented through a series of policies that will sequentially disable each part of the smuggling pipeline before the illicit cargo can depart the port of origin: (1) a certification program during initial procurement to create a marketplace of trusted sellers and increase compliance know-how; (2) the use of digital waybills to reduce documentation fraud and facilitate traceability in order to address evasion of customs controls; and (3) the use of preapproved logistics providers, tagged at the point of sale, to inoculate against the risk of illicit diversion when exiting a port. Logistics providers will be mandated to report to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) monthly on any consignments not received within a specified timeframe of two to four weeks, pinpointing suspicious entities and facilitating targeted and timely spot checks by the BIS on vendors identified as potential weak links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is ultimately how the United States wins the proverbial “whack-a-mole” game, where smuggling networks surface momentarily, vanish, and reemerge elsewhere as quickly as they can be identified. First, it limits the number of tunnels made available to the moles. This will be operationalized through a stringent preapprovals regime that only permits thoroughly screened chip sellers and logistics providers to operate. Second, by collaborating with partner countries, the United States multiplies the hammers in play, to collectively flush the quarry out of the remaining tunnels. This step can be functionalized through dedicated regional units comprising a few experts from the BIS, along with secondees from individual customs authorities, to strengthen intelligence sharing, risk profiling, interdiction, and investigation competence. Lastly, through the use of modern analytics software, third countries can better and more reliably predict where and how the remaining moles will appear. Collectively, these efforts will allow the United States to reclaim control over the rules of the game and tilt the odds in favor of success against slippery evasion strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevailing overconfidence in the efficacy of export controls for chips, guided by the “chokepoint theory,” and the related underestimation of export control evasion, first proceeds from an incomplete and cursory understanding of individual smuggling tactics. This is the case for even well-known methods such as the use of shell companies and transshipment networks. For example, the former may be supplemented by front and shell companies and the activation of dormant shelf companies. This defense-in-depth approach makes quick detection and punitive action far more difficult. Similarly, the transshipment challenge extends beyond the circuitous routing of illicit consignments through multiple third countries to muddy the trail. Along the way, smugglers also often utilize multimodal tactics combining air, sea, and land to further confound tracking efforts. In this manner, smugglers exploit regulatory arbitrage not only across different jurisdictions, but also between siloed domestic authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this only scratches the surface. This report further considers nine other smuggling tactics, ranging from the pedestrian, such as utilizing human carriers or mules and concealing chips in ordinary commodities, to progressively more difficult-to-detect methods such as embedding chips in electrical products, disassembling chips, contaminating container cargo, and even using small submersible vessels. While the last suggestion appears fantastical, a study in the 2000s estimated that “narco-subs” accounted for one-third of maritime cocaine trafficking between South America and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these graft onto the fact that chips are particularly amenable to smuggling. Unlike semiconductor manufacturing equipment — which is large, produced in low quantities, sold at extortionate prices, and requires significant amounts of post-sales support — chips are portable enough to fit in a shoe box, are produced in the millions, are high cost but not prohibitively so, and require little to no post-sales support whatsoever. For comparison, a single state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machine costs $350 million and requires 13 truck-sized containers and 250 crates for transportation. Meanwhile, an H100 chip costs roughly $40,000 and is sufficiently compact that 609 of them can be hidden within a single small freight box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, while this report provides a primer on tactics that may be used, given the dizzying profit margins to be made, these are likely only the tip of the iceberg. Take a hypothetical example of an H100 being sold in the black market at three times its retail value, for a markup of an additional $80,000 per chip. If a smuggler sells ten chips, they start to skirt the edges of a millionaire’s lifestyle; if they sell a thousand, they are elevated from nouveau riche to the landed gentry. There are few greater motivators for the imagination than greed, and policymakers should not underestimate that ancient playwright. As a result, customs officials are always working off a playbook that does not accurately render both the range and dimensionality of smuggling tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the depths of what makes the smuggling enterprise so difficult to detect have scarcely been grazed. The principal challenge of intercepting smuggling operations is not related to the difficulty of detecting individual tactics per se. Rather, it arises from a variety of tactics being combined with one another in a complex chain of overlapping mini-sequences, with tactics recalibrated and refined at each transshipment point. Each supplemental tactic and layer of obfuscation compounds the risk profile. Even if each individual tactic has a seemingly manageable risk of detection, by threading through interstitial gaps at each vulnerability and layering tactics as the context demands to always seek the path of least resistance, the compounding probability of evasion by smugglers drastically increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the risk profile for export control evasion does not scale linearly. All else equal, it surges almost exponentially with the length and complexity of the smuggling sequence. It should be qualified that a single weak point, such as a poorly forged document or an improperly concealed illicit item, can compromise the entire operation. But given the high stakes and margins of the operations at play here, it is reasonable to expect that the smuggling syndicates involved are at least half-competent and, with the attacker’s advantage, are more likely than not to evade detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laslty, because chips command the forefront of innovation, there is a reflexive instinct to assume that any chip-related challenge, including the bypassing of export controls, demands a similarly high-tech remedy. Without discounting the merits of technical interventions, this report suggests that instead of centering chips as the primary object of attention and smuggling as the backdrop, the reverse may be more instructive. By focusing on smuggling rather than technology, it becomes apparent that chip smuggling will likely not be entirely different from the trafficking of drugs or conflict diamonds, and is beholden to similar attributes, such as compactness, ease of concealment, and unit economics. Importantly, the factors facilitating evasion are steadfastly pre-modern. Seven out of the eleven tactics highlighted in this report hinge on the human element (e.g., bribery) and poor customs infrastructure. Chip smuggling is not a novel issue, but the age-old story of traditional contraband. As such, policymakers should be attentive to the persistent points of failure and timeworn tactics that have sustained this industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report puts forward an alternative methodology for assessing export control evasion risks. The traditional approach leans on historical analogues, such as Russia’s circumvention of U.S. export controls for semiconductors following the invasion of Ukraine. While useful, particularly in the absence of reliable information, such approaches are inherently limited and risk overextending region-and country-specific factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report advocates for a first-principles approach. It suggests that estimates for export control evasion be anchored on specific vulnerabilities within the supply chain and potential smuggling tactics. This not only promotes a more grounded representation of the evasion landscape but also equips stakeholders with a more precise and actionable framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each method is scrutinized to assess the likelihood of successful evasion (classified as low, medium, or high), pinpointing specific facilitators or barriers to success. This analysis is further supported with real-world case studies and hypothetical scenarios to illustrate each technique in practice. The report thereafter identifies key conclusions and policy recommendations aimed at improving existing control mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-export-control-evasion-pipeline&quot;&gt;The Export Control Evasion Pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explores the four elements of the export control evasion pipeline — (1) initial procurement, (2) evasion of customs controls, (3) port exit, and (4) transshipment — and component tactics and strategies within each category. Table 1 provides a short summary of each area, as well as the probability for each of evading detection. The rest of the section then unpacks each element in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Summary of the Export Control Evasion Pipeline and Key Takeaways.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stage-1-initial-procurement&quot;&gt;Stage 1: Initial Procurement&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major chipmakers do not engage in direct sales to businesses. NVIDIA, for instance, routes sales through official distributors and authorized original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and resellers. To demonstrate just how few of these entities exist, Japan, which has the largest NVIDIA sales presence in the Asia-Pacific, only has five official distributors, three authorized OEMs, and ten authorized resellers. Account managers at these intermediaries typically adhere to strict Know Your Client (KYC) procedures and assess non-association with parties on blacklists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE USE OF FRONT, SHELL, AND SHELF COMPANIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyer screening relies heavily on the accurate identification of the real end user. As such, smugglers often use front and shell companies with stand-in directors or shareholders to obscure the ultimate beneficiaries. They then misrepresent the intended recipient to bypass export licensing requirements, especially for countries that face a presumption of denial. In addition, by activating long-standing but dormant shelf companies, smugglers further complicate the task of differentiating between legitimate and deceptive transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood of Evading Detection: Medium–High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Detection: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This defense-in-depth approach limits the effectiveness of even the most stringent KYC procedures, creating a disorientating maze of corporate entities that sellers must attempt to understand. Moreover, as soon as an actionable level of suspicion can be established, these companies are torn down as quickly as they were propped up. This makes quick detection and punitive action far more difficult, contributing to the proverbial “whack-a-mole” situation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;igital Detection: Medium–High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Large distributors, resellers, and OEMs often incorporate advanced KYC and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) tools that look beyond surface-level information, delving into the origins, financial flows, and relationships of entities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, there are always workarounds. A practiced shell company might (1) conduct some legitimate business activities to establish a trail of normal commercial transactions; (2) utilize informal banking systems that are not integrated with international banking protocols for illicit transactions; and (3) generate high-quality fabricated business records and financial statements that can withstand scrutiny by standard document verification processes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the efficacy of advanced digital KYC and EDD systems rests on the integrity of the data they analyze. Compromised or fabricated data can undermine the ability of these systems to identify and flag suspicious entities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Entity Y with ties to the defense sector in Regime X may establish a front company in another country alongside various affiliates of the shell company in third countries. It may also use a shelf company, alongside the front company, to further muddy the trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Procurement agents, operating covertly on behalf of Entity Y, will orchestrate purchases of chips by the front or shelf company, which receives funding from a shell company’s foreign bank account and in turn transmits funds through a U.S. correspondent bank account to the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, the front or shelf company may order and receive chips from multiple suppliers. In order to avoid drawing attention with large transactions, it will conduct numerous below-threshold transactions that avoid triggering transaction alerts, gradually accumulating significant holdings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The company will then route the goods to Regime X, often through permissive jurisdictions such as known transshipment points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-1&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CASE STUDY 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;smuggling-us-microelectronics-to-post-sanctions-russia&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Smuggling U.S. Microelectronics to Post-sanctions Russia&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Arthur Petrov, a 33-year-old dual citizen of Russia and Germany, was arrested on August 26, 2023, for his involvement in a scheme to illicitly transport U.S. microelectronics technology, which has military uses, to Russia.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Petrov procured the controlled microelectronics from U.S.-based electronics exporters using a Cyprus-based shell company, Astrafteros Technokosmos LTD (Astrafteros), which he operated.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Petrov misled U.S. suppliers by claiming that Astrafteros was acquiring the components for use in fire safety systems and other civilian applications, asserting that the final recipients and locations for these items were companies in Cyprus or other third countries. In reality, however, these sensitive electronics were intended for Electrocom in Russia, a company that provides equipment to Russian military manufacturers.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACQUIRING EXCESS STOCK FROM SMALLER RESELLERS AND OEMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official distributors and authorized resellers and OEMs often purchase excess stock due to bulk discount incentives or to preempt potential shortages. Leading-edge chips such as NVIDIA H100s, facing tight demand-supply constraints, are unlikely candidates for stockpiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting, however, that following the October 17, 2023, export controls update, controlled chips now also include high-end gaming chips and lower-performing data-center chips. Surplus stock from this expanded category may occasionally be offloaded to smaller resellers or OEMs, who may not enforce stringent KYC protocols compared to larger, established distributors. These are consequently attractive targets for smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood of Evading Detection: High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Detection: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Industry insiders note that these lesser-known distributors may not rigorously enforce KYC procedures. This is not driven by conspiratorial intent, but simply due to a lack of capacity and an experience deficit. Smaller resellers lack the financial and human resources to invest in rigorous training for compliance and do not have the extensive experience of larger distributors, which is crucial for spotting sophisticated evasion tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Detection: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, there are advanced KYC and EDD tools available, but these are costly and typically out of reach for smaller resellers and OEMs in developing countries. In addition, unlike larger distributors and OEMs such as Dell or Fujitsu, they likely do not have access to databases that aggregate global information, which is necessary for effective digital scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stage-2-evasion-of-customs-controls&quot;&gt;Stage 2: Evasion of Customs Controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range of tactics to sidestep customs can be broadly collapsed into one key facilitating factor — bribery — and four primary strategies: (1) utilizing human carriers, (2) concealing chips in ordinary commodities, (3) concealing chips in electrical products, (4) disassembling chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRIBING CUSTOMS OFFICIALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption can facilitate several smuggling tactics. Smugglers may bribe customs officials to provide insider information on shift patterns, inspection routines, or red flags officials look for; turn a blind eye to falsified documents; or even digitally manipulate or alter customs records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood of Evading Detection: High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Susceptibility of Customs Officials: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Smugglers often have an in-depth understanding of which countries are more susceptible to corruption. As a result, they are likely to exploit customs officials in developing countries, who are often paid meager salaries. For example, a customs inspector in Cambodia, which is the second-poorest country in Southeast Asia by GDP per capita, is paid an average salary of $6,635 per year, which works out to $553 per month. According to an Economist Intelligence Unit report, it is not uncommon for frontline border officers in less developed economies in Asia to make $100 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is not a depressed outlier number supplied to advance this point. For reference, a customs inspector in Malaysia, which is the third-richest country in Southeast Asia by GDP per capita, is still only paid an average salary of $9,336 per year, which works out to $778 per month. Accordingly, officials are less likely to be susceptible to bribery in a country such as Singapore, the richest country in Southeast Asia by GDP per capita, which has a strong anti-corruption culture and where customs inspectors are paid an average salary of $28,979 per year, or $2,415 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTILIZING HUMAN CARRIERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the use of carriers, or “mules,” might seem rudimentary, but it is worth analyzing both for completeness and its continued prevalence. This tactic has the highest likelihood of detection and is not the most efficient method for smuggling at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood of Evading Detection: Low&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Detection: Low&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Border control screeners, faced with the overwhelming task of screening thousands of travelers, can only scrutinize a fraction in detail. However, the uniformity of the standard security protocol and internal intelligence provides a counterbalance to this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Seasoned border control screeners are also trained to observe behavioral cues, body language, inconsistencies in travelers’ responses, and other subtle indicators that might hint at deceptive activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Detection: Low&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Full-body scanners (e.g., millimetre-wave scanners) can detect metallic and non-metallic objects as well as items hidden under clothing. However, they do not penetrate the skin and as such are unable to detect illicit goods hidden within body cavities. But unlike contraband such as drugs or conflict diamonds, hiding sensitive electrical products within body cavities may be impractical as chips, especially those on boards, are too rigid and large to be concealed in this manner and the functionality of the chips can be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-2&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CASE STUDY 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;trafficking-of-cpus-in-gongbei-port-macau&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Trafficking of CPUs in Gongbei Port, Macau&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In March 2023, a smuggler was caught at Gongbei Port, the entry point from Macau to China, with 239 central processing units (CPUs) wrapped around his abdomen and legs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Customs officials became suspicious due to his ill-fitting black clothing and strange gait. The CPUs were confiscated, and the man was detained.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCEALING CHIPS IN ORDINARY COMMODITIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tactic is a play on misdirection. Customs officials rely on the accuracy and integrity of declared goods to efficiently process vast quantities of imports and exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Harmonized System (HS) code (see box below) serves as a beacon, directing authorities’ attention and shaping their expectations about a product. The use of incorrect HS codes effectively hides contraband in plain sight, making it appear as routine cargo. This makes smuggling detection an even bigger needle-in-a-haystack challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;primer-on-harmonized-system-codes&quot;&gt;Primer on Harmonized System Codes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Harmonized System (HS) is an international framework that assigns standardized codes to traded products, facilitating global trade classification. The HS code classification is illustrated below using semiconductors as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An HS code is a six-digit number, structured in three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The first two digits (HS-85) indicate the general category or chapter. For example, 85 pertains to “Electrical Machinery and Equipment and Parts Thereof.”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The subsequent two digits (.42) pinpoint subcategories within that chapter. Taking the earlier example, 85.42 specifies “Electrical Integrated Circuits; Parts Thereof.”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The final two digits (.31) provide even greater detail. For instance, 85.42.31 is reserved for “Processors and Controllers.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, controlled chips can be hidden in almost any conceivable manner. Semiconductors (HS 85.42.31) could be concealed in a bag of rice (HS 10.06.30), hermetically sealed in a barrel of crude oil (HS 15.15.11), or simply hidden in a consignment of electronic waste (HS 85.49.39).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood of Evading Detection: Medium–High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Detection: Medium–High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of customs checks are routine. Ordinary commodities are handled with a cursory, less suspicious eye with customs officers inadvertently adopting a pattern of expedited checks for such goods.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Even well-trained officers might miss chips adeptly hidden within routine shipments, especially if the overall shipment does not raise suspicions. Additionally, the compact size of chips makes this a “needle-in-a-haystack” challenge. A smuggler could discreetly hide as many as 609 H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) in just one small FedEx freight box, which would be outwardly indistinguishable from other identical boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, many customs personnel are trained to recognize common smuggling tactics and are aware of the propensity to hide illicit goods in everyday shipments. As a countermeasure, random intensive checks are conducted, even on seemingly mundane shipments. In addition, customs officials have databases that store information on previous shipments. As a result, a sudden change in the pattern, frequency, or nature of shipments from a particular company or to a particular address can raise suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Detection: Medium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While the dimunitive size of GPUs can make them nearly imperceptible, especially when masked among bulkier items, they are still likely to show up on modern X-ray scans. X-ray and scanning technologies are also continually improving. Dual-energy X-ray systems can distinguish between organic and inorganic materials, potentially flagging a semiconductor hidden within a bag of rice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-3&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CASE STUDY 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;concealment-of-intregrated-circuits-in-a-wood-pulp-consignment&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Concealment of Intregrated Circuits in a Wood Pulp Consignment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In June 2023, Hong Kong customs officers seized $153.4 million worth of new integrated circuits stashed in 15 shipping containers. X-rays of the 15 containers, declared to be carrying wood pulp, revealed suspicious images. Two boxes containing wood pulp were placed at the top of each container, underneath which contraband items were stored.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCEALING CHIPS IN ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smugglers may disguise chips within the casings of other electronics such as power supply units or modified computer cases, which would naturally house similar-looking circuitry and components. More concerning, however, is the potential concealment of GPU servers within high-performance workstations or even commercial servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, GPU servers, which are crucial for enabling high-performance computing with minimal latency at the data-center scale, could be made to look like standard, non-descript internal components and will be less likely to arouse suspicion than when hidden within ordinary commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood of Evading Detection: Medium–High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Detection: Medium–High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Everyday electronics are likely to experience relatively expedited checks. Unless specially trained, officers may overlook embedded chips in an otherwise ordinary-looking electronics product, especially if there is no external indication of tampering. However, some major customs checkpoints could employ electronics experts for random reviews. These experts, familiar with the architecture of common devices, might spot irregularities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If customs receives a tip or is randomly conducting in-depth inspections, the physical feel, weight, or even the boot-up process of a tampered laptop, for example, could give away the presence of an embedded chip.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, as previously mentioned, customs officials have databases that store information on previous shipments, and sudden changes to the pattern, frequency, or nature of electronic shipments could be a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Detection: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Even with X-ray inspections, the embedded chips will appear like integral components, effectively camouflaged among the device’s internal components. However, laptops or devices embedded with non-standard components might produce more heat or even specific sounds under operation. Such differences, if detected, could alert inspectors during a power-on test.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISASSEMBLY OF CHIPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smugglers could deconstruct chips into their constituent parts, which are no longer classified as controlled chips by HS code, effectively bypassing export controls. This would mostly be used for the purposes of reverse-engineering advanced chips, as the process of disassembling or delayering a chip is damaging. Once a chip undergoes this process, it likely cannot be restored to its original functional state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;hypothetical-scenario-2&quot;&gt;Hypothetical Scenario 2&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;disassembling-chips&quot;&gt;Disassembling Chips&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Technically, a chip can be disassembled, but not in the traditional sense of taking apart larger mechanical assemblies. Instead, “disassembling” a semiconductor chip usually involves chip “decapsulation” and “delayering.” It is typically done for purposes such as failure analysis, competitive analysis, research, and intellectual property verification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First, the protective package needs to be removed through decapsulation. This can be done one of two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Chemical decapsulation, which uses strong acids or bases to dissolve the package&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mechanical decapsulation, which involves grinding, polishing, or cutting away the package&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Delayering describes the process by which the many layers of an integrated circuit can be removed one by one. This process can involve various methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Wet etching, where the chip is dipped in specific chemicals to dissolve certain layers while leaving others intact&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Dry etching, which uses plasma or ions to selectively remove layers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mechanical polishing, which uses very fine abrasives to polish away the top layer without damaging the underlying structures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood of Evading Detection: High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Detection: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Disassembled semiconductor components, if high in volume and lacking distinctive, recognizable features, may not raise suspicions or warrant detailed inspection against their declared descriptions, particularly when inspections are based on random sampling or partial checks of shipments. As the smuggling technique becomes known, customs may employ experts to recognize disassembled chips, although there will be a time lag.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Detection: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Standard X-ray examinations would merely reflect components as inconspicuous, smaller semiconductor fragments, bypassing customs scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stage-3-port-exit&quot;&gt;Stage 3: Port Exit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a range of tactics smugglers use, but three are worth highlighting: (1) leveraging private couriers; (2) contaminating containger cargo; and (3) use of submersible vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEVERAGING PRIVATE COURIERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smugglers often prefer private courier services, which typically apply less rigorous inspection protocols than major, well-established companies. Smaller private couriers might be more susceptible to inducements or bribes due to the nature of their operations and potential financial pressures. In contrast, established logistics providers have more to lose and are less likely to risk severe penalties or reputational damage for illicit gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larger companies also adhere to predetermined routes, minimizing the chances of clandestine diversions that could be used to bypass regulatory checkpoints. Moreover, they often partake in collaborative platforms that allow for real-time information sharing with customs and other regulatory authorities, fostering an environment of cooperation and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, established logistics providers have more compliance capabilities at their disposal. Larger companies utilize advanced package screening technologies. They also maintain thorough and standardized document verification procedures, employing expert personnel trained to detect discrepancies that may indicate smuggling. For instance, global logistics giants such as UPS engage security vendors for the express purpose of screening cargo items (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bU7Slb8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;UPS Cargo X-Ray Screener Job Ad.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The posting is no longer online but was available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jobs-ups.uk/job/stansted-mountfitchet/cargo-screener/20477/54285091248&quot;&gt;“Jobs &amp;amp; Careers: Cargo Screener,” UPS, September 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood of Evading Detection: Medium–High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Detection Prior to Leaving Port: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are a number of tools that private couriers, unlike major global logistics companies, do not have:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Advanced inspection equipment, which results in less detailed or less accurate scans, potentially allowing contraband to pass through undetected&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Standardized operating protocols, leading to variability in the depth and thoroughness of inspections&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comprehensive training programs or intelligence sharing on emerging threats, which can lead to oversights or missed cues of smuggling activity&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition, private couriers, especially smaller-scale operations, may be more vulnerable to internal collusion or corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subsequent Detection: Medium–High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Smugglers could use less-traveled maritime routes to sidestep routine patrol routes. Furthermore, the compact size of their vessels might make them less detectable in open waters, providing an edge in evasion. However, private couriers, being lesser-known entities compared to giants such as UPS, might be viewed with a greater degree of suspicion by maritime patrols, leading to more frequent random inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONTAMINATING CONTAINER CARGO (“RIP-ON, RIP-OFF” METHOD)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One concealment strategy frequently employed by drug syndicates, especially from Brazil, involves exploiting legitimate, often containerized shipments. In this method, illicit cargo is secretly added to a legitimate shipment without the knowledge of the shipper or consignee. According to TradeWinds, the world’s biggest shipping news service, “drug traffickers can open a shipping container and remove a 100-kilogram consignment of cocaine in as little as three minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the strategy to work, collaboration is necessary at both the origin and destination. At the departure dock, the insertion or “rip-on” team introduces the illicit goods into the selected container. To mask any interference, they frequently replace the genuine security seal with a counterfeit. At the destination port, retrieval of the concealed items is crucial. This is either done by compromised port staff or by specialized extraction or “rip-off” teams who infiltrate the terminal. After this operation, the container might be either left unsealed or be relocked with another duplicate seal. Locating such containers in large terminals is a challenge. Simply knowing the container identification number is insufficient; it must also be easily reachable, which often demands insider help to adjust the placement of the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-4&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CASE STUDY 4:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;rip-on-rip-off-cocaine-container-bust-at-port-botany&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;“Rip-On, Rip-Off” Cocaine Container Bust at Port Botany&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Authorities detained two individuals in Sydney following the discovery of 120 kilograms of cocaine, valued at approximately $60 million, concealed within a shipping container they were attempting to break into.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The pair from Athens were suspected to be local operatives involved in a compromised “rip-on, rip-off” narcotics trafficking scheme. The police interception was prompted by a reported break-in at a Port Botany logistics firm, situated in the vicinity of Sydney’s main maritime terminal, where they uncovered 120 bricks of cocaine, each weighing one kilogram.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood of Evading Detection: High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Detection Prior to Leaving Port: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;By embedding illicit items within genuine shipments, the chances of arousing suspicion are reduced. Since the original shippers and consignees are typically unaware that their containers are being used for smuggling, their documentation and behavior do not raise red flags. With the right network and bribed officials, the drugs can be successfully loaded onto containers without drawing attention.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, the process of breaking and replacing the container seals, even if replaced with duplicates, can sometimes be detected if the seals are not placed correctly or if there are visible signs of tampering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subsequent Detection: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If smugglers successfully load chips onto containers of a reputed logistics provider, the odds of detection decrease significantly for several reasons. First, large logistics providers have built a trustworthy reputation over years, and maritime authorities are less likely to scrutinize these companies as intensely as smaller or less-known shippers. Second, if smugglers manage to bypass the advanced security measures of reputed logistics providers, it may create a false sense of security for officials. However, there are still risks from intelligence tip-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USE OF SUBMERSIBLE VESSELS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drug smugglers have been known to use smaller semi-submersible and even fully submersible vessels, particularly from South America to the United States, to evade radar and visual identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction suggests that larger crewed vessels can transport as much as eight tons of cocaine, a load potentially valued at over $1 billion. According to Colombian navy estimates, the average cost to the drug smugglers for one of these boats is just under $1 million, making this a potentially higly profitable smuggling method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood of Evading Detection: High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Detection Prior to Leaving Port: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Chips are precision engineered and susceptible to environmental factors. Loading them onto submersible vessels demands specialized handling and extended timeframes, necessitating remote loading locations. Countries with sprawling coastlines, underdeveloped maritime infrastructure, and often lax maritime surveillance offer numerous such potential locations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;However, major ports are equipped with comprehensive CCTV systems, frequent patrols, and stringent entry and exit procedures. Any unexpected loading activities, especially involving atypical vessels such as submersibles, would likely raise alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subsequent Maritime Detection: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In addition to having a low radar signature and being able to submerge quickly when maritime enforcement is detected, submersibles, especially those used in illicit activities, are engineered to be as stealthy as possible. The following are examples of such measures:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A reduced acoustic profile (e.g., quieter engines, vibration-damping materials, streamlined shapes) to evade passive sonar systems&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Air-independent propulsion systems to reduce heat emissions&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remote guidance or onboard autonomous systems, which allow them to run riskier routes and further reduce their acoustic profile (e.g., no need for life-support systems)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, they often employ advanced logistics tactics, such as deploying a network of fishing vessels to alert crews about nearby patrols or utilizing offshore refueling vessels to bypass coastal areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;case-study-5&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CASE STUDY 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;narco-submarines-in-costa-rica&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Narco-Submarines in Costa Rica&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;During the 1980s, go-fast boats were the smuggling vessel of choice in many parts of the world. Go-fast boats became more vulnerable to radar detection as radar technology improved, leading to the development of semi-submersibles.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the 1990s, there were rumours that smugglers were using vessels that were nearly fully submersible to reduce detection by visual, radar, sonar, or infrared systems. However, it was only in 2006 that the U.S. Coast Guard successfully seized a 50-foot narco-submarine with three tons of cocaine some 166 km southwest of Costa Rica.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stage-4-transshipment&quot;&gt;Stage 4: Transshipment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon leaving the initial port, smugglers may redirect the chips for consistency to a third country where customs controls are less stringent. To further obfuscate the trail, they often engage various intermediaries, utilize diverse transportation methods, and transship the chips through multiple countries, further muddying the trail (see Hypothetical Scenario 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;hypothetical-scenario-3&quot;&gt;Hypothetical Scenario 3&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;a-sample-transshipment-journey&quot;&gt;A Sample Transshipment Journey&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country A → Country B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversionary Tactic:&lt;/strong&gt; Smuggler X first moves the chips overland to Country A, classifying them as generic computer parts for a technology roadshow in a provincial city. In reality, they never make it there. They are rerouted to a small coastal village and loaded onto a fishing vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country B → Country C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Lost Cargo” Tactic:&lt;/strong&gt; Near Country B, the chips are reportedly “lost at sea.” Instead, they are actually anchored and buoyed just beneath the surface, waiting for retrieval by another party. A recreational diving group (in on the operation) “discovers” the “lost cargo.” They retrieve it and bring it to a port in Country C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country C → Country D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shell Companies and Ghost Transactions:&lt;/strong&gt; In Country C, a shell company purchases the “recovered treasure” and then sells it to another entity in Country D as antique electronics for collectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country D → Country E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Container Mixing:&lt;/strong&gt; Once in Country D, the chips are embedded within laptops. The products (and chips hidden within) are loaded into containers and shipped to Country E with proper customs declarations for electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country E → Country F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trade Show:&lt;/strong&gt; Upon arrival in Country E, the chips are quietly retrieved and repackaged inside dummy prototypes of new technology devices. A buyer from Country F visits the trade show and purchases these prototypes as cutting-edge technology from Country E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country F → Country G&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extraction of Chips:&lt;/strong&gt; Here, the chips are extracted by an intermediary agent and sent to Country G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Country G → Country H&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Journey Overland:&lt;/strong&gt; The final purchaser, having trustworthy trade relations with Country H, sends the devices overland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likelihood of Evading Detection: High&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cumulative Detection: High&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The use of multiple third countries as transit points compounds the difficulty of detecting illicit cargo. Even if each individual country has a seemingly manageable risk of detection, by exploiting interstitial gaps between each transit point, the cumulative probability of evasion drastically increases.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Transshipment is not just about the simple math of probabilities. It is about deliberately and tactically manuevering through a patchwork of customs controls, always seeking the path of least resistance and exploiting the unevenness of the regional and international enforcement landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-observations&quot;&gt;Key Observations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;early-interdiction-is-more-effective-than-reactive-enforcement&quot;&gt;Early interdiction is more effective than reactive enforcement.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studying the pipeline of export control evasion (see Table 1), there is a noticeable increase in the difficulty of detecting evasion tactics from Stage 1 (the initial procurement of chips) to Stage 4 (the transshipment phase). As soon as illicit goods depart the port of origin and get funneled through transshipment networks, the supply chain becomes a tortuously fragmented puzzle. Untangling this knotted snarl often requires vast resources, regional and international cooperation, and, often, specific intelligence, making the task daunting for even the best-equipped customs and enforcement agencies. A superior approach is therefore to focus on mitigating export control evasion risks upstream rather than downstream. To the extent possible, it is necessary to dam the river at its source, as neglecting to do so allows the stream to branch out unpredictably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;focus-should-be-placed-on-improving-detection-capabilities-in-third-countries-not-just-bis-enforcement&quot;&gt;Focus should be placed on improving detection capabilities in third countries, not just BIS enforcement.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most extant proposals focus on increasing the BIS’s resources to enhance its enforcement capabilities. But if detection precedes enforcement, and if the challenges of doing the former are non-trivial, then perhaps these efforts are putting the horse before the cart. Moreover, given how understaffed and underinvested the BIS continues to be despite the pleas of key voices, can it reliably be expected to police global smuggling networks that span scores of countries, each with multiple ports? Importantly, this singular dependence on the BIS introduces a single point of failure. The BIS may not always recognize specific localized tactics used in transshipment hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;capacity-building-is-more-constructive-than-punitive-actions&quot;&gt;Capacity building is more constructive than punitive actions.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report suggests a corrective in the nature of U.S. engagement with third countries. There is too often an assumption that countries that are key transshipment hubs are directly abetting illicit networks. This shapes the language for necessary instruments such as sanctions, country quotas, and outright bans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report finds that seven out of eleven of the smuggling tactics identified are more likely to happen in developing countries, which often have poor customs infrastructure. This lack of ability to identify smuggling is not due to wilful negligence but a consequence of infrastructural gaps. These nations typically cannot afford advanced X-ray and scanning technologies (e.g., dual-energy X-ray systems), next-generation KYC and EDD software, or experts who may more reliably spot irregularities, such as chips concealed in electronic products. In addition, such ports are commonly not equipped with comprehensive CCTV systems or stringent entry and exit procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterintuitively, technonationalism may demand that the United States find greater security not by turning inward but through outward engagement and extending support for capacity building in select third countries. Otherwise, these countries are unlikely to independently invest in improved export control compliance measures themselves (see next observation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;understanding-partner-countries-incentives-is-crucial&quot;&gt;Understanding partner countries’ incentives is crucial.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the focus of national customs agencies has been on import controls rather than export controls. This was shaped by the demands of collecting tariffs and protecting domestic industries from foreign competition, as well as the assumption that outbound goods, which contribute to national wealth through trade surpluses, pose less of a risk. The emergence of dual-use goods has heightened the necessity for export controls, but a marked imbalance persists between the attention given to import controls versus export controls at the national level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States might emphasize the importance of increased export control measures, many customs agencies will not prioritize them. Having too restrictive a compliance sieve detracts from their core focus, which is to facilitate trade and increase port revenues. As such, in urging partner nations to increase their efforts, the United States must consider such countries’ domestic priorities. Ultimately, the primary mission of these countries’ customs agencies is to advance their own national development goals, not to aid the United States in its AI ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;detailed-policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Detailed Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the challenges of detecting illicit consignments after they become obscured in transshipment networks, policymakers should focus on upstream sections of the smuggling pipeline, from the initial procurement of chips to before it leaves the port of origin. Importantly, these recommendations should be agreeable to and easily implementable by third countries. They should also be business-friendly, meaning they should be as frictionessless as possible and paired with incentives to match or dampen obligations. Regulatory interventions that work with the market are almost always more effective than those that swim upstream against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, to allay the reflexive reactions of U.S. policymakers to the phrase “capacity building,” the three recommendations proposed here are entirely modest. They include workshops, a regional unit that will only require two to four BIS personnel with shared commitments from partner countries, and the provision of modern analytics software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-1-mandate-use-of-custom-digital-waybills-and-preapproved-logistics-providers&quot;&gt;Recommendation 1: Mandate use of custom digital waybills and preapproved logistics providers.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A custom digital waybill for chips, incorporating a unique identifier, can mitigate the risks associated with the falsification of customs documents. Digital authentication further ensures the integrity of the waybill, making it difficult for smugglers to forge documents without detection. These waybills will be integrated with sales procedures as well as digital sales platforms for ease of business incorporation, and will include several key features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Unique Identifier:&lt;/strong&gt; A unique QR code or equivalent tag for easy, tamper-proof scanning&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Authentication:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital verification mechanisms to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the waybill&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Item Specifics:&lt;/strong&gt; Details that clearly state the nature of the controlled item as well as its quantity, value, origin, and destination&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics Providers Details:&lt;/strong&gt; Details of the logistics provider, including its preapproval status&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standardized Sections:&lt;/strong&gt; Sections for customs officials to stamp or digitally sign upon inspection, ensuring traceability at every checkpoint&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, purchasers of chips will only be permitted to use prescreened logistics providers and routes. The buyer must identify their logistics provider of choice at the point of sale. Failure to do so should lead to cancellation of the sale. Tagging shipments at the point of sale enhances the BIS’s ability to efficiently conduct targeted audits. Logistics providers will be mandated to report to the BIS monthly on any consignments not received within a specified timeframe of two to four weeks. This process will flag discrepancies between recorded sales and actual shipments, facilitating swift spot checks on vendors identified as potential weak links. This will also better pinpoint suspicious entities that could be operating as front, shell, or shelf companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criteria for preapproval of logistics providers should broadly include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Integrity:&lt;/strong&gt; A five-year track record that includes major incidents, policy breaches, or violations&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological Capabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Adoption and integration of advanced package screening technologies&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular training for employees handling controlled items&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background Checks:&lt;/strong&gt; Mandatory checks for staff involved in the shipping of controlled items&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Assessment:&lt;/strong&gt; Financial audits to ensure stability and solvency (a company in good financial standing is typically less prone to corrupt practices)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation Adherence:&lt;/strong&gt; A demonstrated record of correctly filling, maintaining, and providing necessary shipment documentation&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route Security:&lt;/strong&gt; An assessment of chosen routes, favoring direct routes over transshipments to minimize risks&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration with Customs:&lt;/strong&gt; Established rapport and history of cooperation with customs and enforcement agencies in the region&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, to incentivize the use of the waybill by distributors and resellers, this report proposes implementing a revenue-sharing program where distributors and resellers receive a small percentage of the transaction fee from every digital waybill issued. This turns compliance into a direct revenue stream. As for logistics providers, those who submit to BIS audits after the first year will be eligible for green-lane customs treatment in ports of call. In addition, there is room for negotiation with insurance companies to offer lower premiums for shipments that use digital waybills, as they are easier to track and thus present a lower risk of theft or loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-2-require-compulsory-certification-for-official-distributors-resellers-and-logistics-providers&quot;&gt;Recommendation 2: Require compulsory certification for official distributors, resellers, and logistics providers.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promoting a culture of compliance relies on a willingness on the part of exporters to comply with controls. While there certainly will be companies or individuals seeking to willfully circumvent or violate export controls, as mentioned previously, smaller resellers may inadvertently do so out of a lack of awareness or due to limited capacity. Hence, they should not be indiscriminately excluded entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recommendation seeks to reduce evasion, particularly among these unintentional violators. But in order to be added to the approved list, they will have to undergo and complete the requirements of a certification workshop alongside official distributors, authorized OEMs and resellers, and logistics providers. To ensure that the new policy on custom waybills and use of preapproved logistics providers is well comprehended and implemented by these stakeholders, this report proposes holding a series of targeted capacity-building certification workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CERTIFICATION WORKSHOP CURRICULUM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed certification workshop should focus on the following goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Outline in detail U.S. regulations surrounding the export of controlled chips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conduct training on emergent tactics used by smugglers and how to spot and report front, shell, and shelf companies using easy-to-understand KYC guidelines (see sample guidelines below).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Explain the rationale for the custom waybills as well as criteria for preapproval of logistics providers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide hands-on sessions on how to correctly fill and process custom waybills.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide distributors and logistics providers with technical assistance to integrate the waybill system with existing inventory and sales software.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CERTIFICATION WORKSHOP MODALITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop will be facilitated by BIS export controls experts and customs officials from partner countries in an interactive format consisting of a detailed presentation, case studies, and a Q&amp;amp;A session with hands-on practice. There should also be recorded versions for remote stakeholders or those unable to attend in person, with periodic live Q&amp;amp;A sessions. If possible, e-guides, video tutorials, and FAQs should be made available on a dedicated portal. To reduce costs, this can be integrated to the extent possible with existing capacity-building work that BIS is already undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CERTIFICATION WORKSHOP EVALUATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An evaluation will be conducted following the workshop by either a BIS or customs official from the host country to ensure comprehension. This could include a mix of multiple-choice questions, waybill filling exercises, and scenario-based questions. Successful participants will receive a certificate, which will be a prerequisite for being listed as an approved distributor, reseller, or logistics provider. This will cost little beyond the logistical costs of organizing the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECERTIFICATION AND REVOCATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the dynamic nature of the industry and the regulatory landscape, periodic refresher workshops should be held at least annually. Updates or changes to the policy can be communicated during these sessions. Moreover, authorized sellers found negligent in conducting KYC procedures during BIS audits or random spot checks risk revocation of their certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAMPLE KYC GUIDELINES (RED-FLAG INDICATORS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Watchlist Matches: The customer, their address, or affiliated parties resemble entries on the Commerce Control List.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Business Mismatch: The chip’s capabilities are inconsistent with the customer’s purported business activities (e.g., an advanced GPU order for a steel mill).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unusual Payment Methods: The customer prefers to pay in cash for high-value orders, despite more standard financing or credit terms being available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Declined Services: The buyer turns down standard post-purchase offerings, such as installation or training.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sketchy Business Background: The customer lacks a clear business history, previous transactions, or an online presence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lack of Product Familiarity: The customer shows little knowledge about the chip’s specifications and capabilities but is insistent on the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ambiguous Delivery Details: The order has vague delivery dates or requests for delivery to remote or unusual destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unusual Routes: The proposed transportation route is circuitous or unusual for the given product and end destination.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inconsistent Packaging: The packaging requested does not match the method of shipment or seems overdone or inadequate for the type of product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-3-set-up-dedicated-regional-units-consisting-of-bis-staff-and-secondees-from-partner-countries-and-incorporate-use-of-modern-data-analytics&quot;&gt;Recommendation 3: Set up dedicated regional units consisting of BIS staff and secondees from partner countries and incorporate use of modern data analytics.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SETTING UP A DEDICATED REGIONAL UNIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National customs operations have historically been driven by revenue collection and import controls, relegating the task of export controls to the periphery. While the United States might emphasize the importance of such controls, many customs agencies do not prioritize them. Moreover, the infrequent cases related to export control evasion result in an experiential deficit among customs staff, further diminishing its precedence. For reference, even in Germany, the European Union’s largest exporter, the number of criminal proceedings relating to export control violations processed each year is relatively low, in the double digits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paucity, coupled with the complexity of such cases, has deterred the establishment of specialized procedures or dedicated departments to detect export control evasion. Consequently, this limited exposure leaves customs officers and even prosecutors and judges ill-equipped to credibly deal with export control evasion cases, potentially overlooking critical aspects due to insufficient experience or a lack of technical or legal familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, to improve risk profiling, interdiction, investigation competence, and intelligence sharing, this report recommends the formation of a dedicated regional unit comprised of two to four specialist advisory experts from the United States, along with secondees from partners’ customs authorities. In this model, when a frontline officer detects a suspicious transaction, they can immediately seek guidance from the specialized team. In turn, the unit proactively disseminates its intelligence to partner countries. This model takes reference in part from specialized national units like in the Netherlands (see Case Study 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the efficacy of this system depends on robust interagency information sharing at both the national and international levels. Collaboration between customs and intelligence agencies is paramount. This will necessitate granting security clearances for both U.S. experts and secondees in the risk-profiling unit. Furthermore, intelligence data will need to be transformed into a redacted, yet actionable format, ensuring broader dissemination within the customs department without compromising sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the Netherlands, a specialist team, Precursors, Strategic Goods and Sanctions (POSS), is responsible for the enforcement of export controls and sanctions under the customs administration. POSS monitors and enforces exporters’ compliance and can also conduct (criminal) investigations. To perform its tasks, the team has the power to demand extensive information from any entity (e.g., manufacturers, traders, and brokers) that deals with the export of dual-use and military goods, including the right to access company premises.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USE OF MODERN DATA ANALYTICS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leans on the work by Gregory C. Allen, Emily Benson, and William Alan Reinsch in their paper “Improved Export Controls Enforcement Technology Needed for U.S. National Security,” which recommends the incorporation of data-driven approaches in place of the dated software and databases BIS currently uses. However, whereas their recommendations focus on improving the BIS’s detection capabilities, this recommendation instead looks at improving detection at the customs level, which are the physical points of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, ensuring that the Commerce Control List is improved and regularly updated to pinpoint companies affiliated to bad-faith actors or regimes is crucial to ensure that ports downstream can more effectively sift out front, shell, and shelf companies. However, this also introduces a single point of failure in the detection system due to the reliance on the BIS to fulfill its role perfectly. Furthermore, the BIS might not always recognize specific tactics used in major transshipment hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the United States should collaborate with partner countries and key circumvention nodes to incorporate modern data analytics for improved detection of evasive entities. Below is a sample implementation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample Recommendations to Enhance Surveillance Capabilities to Detect Evasive Actors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customized Risk Profiling:&lt;/strong&gt; Implement machine-learning algorithms tailored to each port’s unique profile to auto-score incoming and outgoing shipments based on the history of evasive activities and identified patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply Chain Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Employ supply chain analytics tools to trace the origins and destinations of shipments, identifying unusual routes or odd combinations of cargo that might indicate evasion tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time Vessel Monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate real-time tracking systems to monitor vessel movements, especially those taking irregular routes or making unexpected stops, often indicators of evasive or illegal activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Document Verification:&lt;/strong&gt; Introduce optical character recognition (OCR) and natural-language processing (NLP) systems to scan, verify, and highlight discrepancies in shipment documents, bills of lading, or manifests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port Data Integration System:&lt;/strong&gt; Consolidate data from different ports to create a holistic database, improving collaborative efforts in detecting evasive actors across the continent. This system can track entities as they move through various checkpoints, making evasion harder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Analytics:&lt;/strong&gt; Utilize algorithms to study behavior patterns of freight forwarders, shipping companies, and other stakeholders. A sudden change in patterns could be indicative of evasive or illicit activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative Stakeholder Reporting:&lt;/strong&gt; Foster an environment where port staff, customs officials, and third-party stakeholders can anonymously report suspicious activities, with the system analyzing these reports for recurring patterns or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Sanctions and Blacklist Checks:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate updated international and regional sanctions lists and run real-time checks on entities, ensuring that any newly blacklisted or suspicious entities are promptly flagged during transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insights in this report are admittedly mostly qualitative. However, it seeks to provide a sufficient base for readers to infer the complexities of export control evasion through straightforward inductive reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommendations in this report also likely do not go far enough. Recent compute governance proposals suggest establishing a “tracking regime” to monitor the distribution and ownership of AI chips. However, practical implementation details of how chains of custody and a chip registry can be established in such a scheme remain largely poorly defined. In addition, the privacy challenges of doing so have not been sufficiently addressed. For example, when Intel introduced the Pentium III processor in 1999, which had a unique serial number embedded in each chip, the ensuing privacy backlash caused Intel to hastily create a disablement tool and exclude serial numbers in subsequent chip models. This is why this report proposes the less invasive and more modest recommendation of a waybill with a unique identifier instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the recommendations proposed in this report will likely be imperfect. Determined smugglers will try to hack the waybill system by forging or altering it. Shell companies will still overcome enhanced KYC checks and engage private couriers. But this is precisely the point. Export controls are an inherently leaky instrument. Guiding principles must therefore be practical. What chokepoints in the smuggling pipeline can realistically be targeted, thereby sufficiently increasing both the cost of compliance and the likelihood of good-faith actions? It is not about guaranteeing success, but defining the level of failure that is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（8日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第55日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。在《國安法》生效之後，IPAC 開始討論游說各國終止與香港的引渡協議，電郵紀錄顯示，李將 IPAC 相關小組會議紀錄翻譯成日文，並以電郵傳送給日本議員山尾志櫻里。同年7月，山尾志櫻里和另一名日本議員中谷元成立 JPAC（Japanese Parliamentary Alliance on China），宗旨是請求中國不要肆意侵害普世價值和基本人權。李供稱他曾協助山尾籌備成立 JPAC，又協助 JPAC 與 IPAC 之間的訊息傳遞和翻譯，並聯絡數個在日港人組織。訊息和電郵紀錄又顯示，李曾串連 IPAC 創辦人裴倫德和英國金融家 Bill Browder 與山尾志櫻里開會，希望協助山尾在日本議會上推動人權法案，惟李在該會議之前已被捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第12天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李確認與會者包括裴倫德、英國國會議員 Iain Duncan Smith 、新西蘭眾議員 Simon O’Connor、澳洲參議員 Kimberly Kitching 和加拿大眾議員 Garnett Genuis 等，而李則是列席者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指李宇軒事後把小組會議紀錄翻譯成日文，並以電郵傳送給日本議員山尾志櫻里（本名「菅野志桜里」）。庭上展示的會議紀錄指稱習近平利用經濟發展來進行統治，有與會者指不應該有任何人引渡回港受審，控方問李，以上是否小組會議的共識。李則指該次會議並沒有達成任何共識，會議紀錄不見提及任何將會採取的行動，只見不同國家的聯盟代表發言及意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月4日，裴倫德傳送一則 Twitter 帖文給李，內容提及 IPAC 經過開會討論國安法和引渡協議之後，一致同意不應有逃犯引渡協議，裴倫德希望 SWHK 轉發此帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;swhk曾去信捷克愛爾蘭和葡萄牙-要求終止引渡協議&quot;&gt;SWHK曾去信捷克、愛爾蘭和葡萄牙 要求終止引渡協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指在李宇軒的電腦發現3封由「重光團隊」（Stand with Hong Kong, Fight for Freedom, SWHK）分別撰寫給捷克、愛爾蘭和葡萄牙首長和外交部的信件，要求上述3個國家終止與香港的引渡逃犯協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示以他理解，愛爾蘭和葡萄牙均沒有 IPAC 的成員，捷克則不肯定，但上述3封信均是由 SWHK 其他成員與顧問公司 Whitehouse Consultancy 合作撰寫，亦有其他團隊成員作出跟進，所以李並沒有協助跟進這3封信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;日本關注對華政策聯盟成立-李宇軒協助山尾志櫻里籌備&quot;&gt;日本關注對華政策聯盟成立 李宇軒協助山尾志櫻里籌備&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月19日，李宇軒透過 Telegram 告知裴倫德，兩名日本議員山尾志櫻里和中谷元將會正式成立日本的「IPAC衛星組織（satellite IPAC）」，名叫 JPAC（Japanese Parliamentary Alliance on China）。李庭上稱，JPAC 的成立目的是讓一些關心對華政策的日本議員「好似 IPAC 咁走埋一齊」，以討論對華政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息顯示，李告訴裴倫德，JPAC 會在2020年7月29日舉行記者會公布成立，日本團隊的發言者將會談及「救生艇」、馬格尼茨基人權問責法（Magnitsky Act）、暫緩日本與香港的司法互助協議，以及阻止日本企業或組織向香港政府提供協助。李庭上指以上四點並不是 JPAC 的目標，只是記者會當日的發言重點，因記者會除了宣布成立 JPAC 之外，也會有一些關心中國和香港的社運人士發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又表示，他在 JPAC 並沒有任何角色，在山尾志櫻里籌備 JPAC 的階段，他僅以義工的身份協助山尾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱向日本議員提供語言支援及聯絡日本港人組織&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱向日本議員提供語言支援及聯絡日本港人組織&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在 Telegram 訊息中，裴倫德表示想認識山尾志櫻里，邀請李宇軒作為介紹橋樑。李則回覆，他與山尾之間的溝通似乎只有日語，而「溝通鏈」似乎是山尾及其團隊經日本港人組織與李溝通，然後李將相關信息轉達給 IPAC，以及裴倫德將 IPAC 的信息轉達給李，之後由李轉達給山尾。李又指，山尾的團隊並沒有人具備足夠英語能力，所以來自香港的義工會協助山尾處理英文材料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李庭上確認：「我的確係有將啲訊息 pass 嚟 pass 去」，他在日本線的工作主要有兩方面，一是在山尾志櫻里和中谷元參與會議的時候，提供語言支援；二是協助聯絡日本的港人組織，包括「Act with HK」、「SWHK@JPN」和「香港之黎明（香港の夜明け）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，李將 JPAC 的成員名單傳送給裴倫德，當中包括山尾志櫻里、中谷元、長島昭久、有村治子、山田宏、櫻井周、井上一德和串田誠一等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上展示 JPAC 的會章，以日文撰寫。李指該會章第二條提及 JPAC 的宗旨是請求中國不要肆意侵害普世價值和基本人權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;裴倫德邀李穿針引線介紹bill-browder給山尾志櫻里&quot;&gt;裴倫德邀李穿針引線介紹Bill Browder給山尾志櫻里&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telegram 訊息顯示，裴倫德告知李宇軒，英國金融家 Bill Browder 希望協助山尾志櫻里在日本推動人權法案，邀請李穿針引線安排一次線上會議，讓 Bill Browder 與「SWHK@JPN」成員溝通，然後一同協助山尾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李解釋，Bill Browder 是一名想幫手在全球各地推動馬格尼茨基人權問責法（Magnitsky Act）的人，但他不想猜測 Bill Browder 的目的，而法案是針對人權侵害事件。因為當時有港人組織想推動馬格尼茨基法案，而 Bill Browder 同樣想推動，所以兩者有共同的利益，至於 Bill Browder 想法案應用在哪些地方，李則不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指裴倫德希望能把 Bill Browder 介紹給山尾志櫻里，然後雙方可以合作。由於山尾以日語溝通較自在，所以會議中需要有義工協助山尾翻譯，作為 Bill Browder 和山尾之間的溝通橋樑，該義工人選可能是「Act with HK」、「SWHK@JPN」和「香港之黎明（香港の夜明け）」的成員，或者李本人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒會議定於8月12日-惟此前被拘捕&quot;&gt;李宇軒：會議定於8月12日 惟此前被拘捕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;裴倫德在2020年8月4日開設 Signal 群組「Magnitsky Japan」，成員還有李宇軒和 Bill Browder。裴倫德在群組中介紹李，指他與日本團隊溝通，並會協助轉達。李則在群組中發送訊息，表示會安排一個會議，告知山尾志櫻里有什麼支援，又表示需要與山尾和其他日本議員商討策略，包括論調及在什麼時機推動法案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示一系列電郵紀錄，山尾向 Bill Browder 表示想在8月12日開會。李庭上確認會議定於8月12日舉行，但是他在當日之前被警方拘捕，不知道會議最終有否如期進行。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示李宇軒與另一名被告陳梓華（網名T）之間的 Signal 對話，當中陳問李：「你安排好哂香港D野未」、「你去打最終件事會係你身邊所有人都會照肺」；李則回覆「我搞掂咗要搞嘅家人s」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李庭上解釋，訊息意思是「如果要打嘅話，身邊嘅人包括T會被照肺」，所以他回覆陳的訊息意思是：「如果要照肺嘅話都會照，唔會取決於我打唔打。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問李要「打」什麼，李僅指：「浮上枱面做枱面人。」法官李運騰問，是否很多社運人士都是「枱底的人」？李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

Ukraine and its partners have to be creative and determined in finding new trade corridors to support business operations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transport and logistics infrastructure serves as a country’s main trade arteries, facilitating the flow of people, goods, and services. Without this vital infrastructure, a country’s economic potential is stifled. In the case of Ukraine, Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 had devastating effects on its economy, including its ability to trade. Due to constant and indiscriminate Russian missile attacks, Ukraine suffered massive destruction of its transport and logistics infrastructure, with air cargo totally suspended and port activity severely interrupted. As a result, Ukraine has to be creative in finding new trade corridors to support business operations and enable the flow of humanitarian and military aid. To that effect, this white paper analyzes how the country has been adapting its trade routes and related infrastructure in wartime and provides recommendations to sustain trade and economic activity now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-trade-challenges&quot;&gt;Current Trade Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine is facing numerous challenges to its trade-related infrastructure. Even before the full-scale invasion, the quality of Ukraine’s infrastructure was low due to the decades-long absence of critical investments. The 2022 invasion has added more complexities to this situation. First, Russian air strikes have destroyed and damaged transport and logistics infrastructure including key ports, roads, and grain silos, rendering these assets unusable or in need of repair and rebuilding. Second, shipping through the Black Sea, a main artery for trade for agricultural products, has partially rebounded but remains susceptible to attacks. Moreover, finding alternative routes for grain shipments via train and roads through Ukraine’s western borders has led to disruptions with neighboring countries and additional time and transportation costs. Third, given the unpredictability of Russian attacks and the duration of the war, insurance for physical assets, such as vessels and silos, and business operations is expensive or lacking altogether. Lastly, all these transportation modes are labor intensive. Personnel shortages abound across sectors as many Ukrainians have left the country or have been mobilized for the army. Transportation is not immune to these trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seaports-and-waterways&quot;&gt;Seaports and Waterways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s seaports have been crucial modes for exporting agricultural commodities and metals. Before the full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s top five ports in the Black Sea cities of Pivdennyi, Mykolayiv, Chornomorsk, Odesa, and Mariupol — were responsible for over 90 percent of Ukraine’s seaport freight turnover. Moreover, 98 percent of grain exports flowed through the Black Sea ports, with Mykolayiv seaport playing an imperative role. Companies such as U.S. Bunge, Ukrainian Nibulon, and Chinese COFCO all had major investments there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, commerce through the Black Sea was significantly interrupted. Grain exports via the Black Sea were subject to constant Russian attacks (the heaviest period being February to July of 2022), including aerial (missile and drone) attacks on port infrastructure and sea mines destroying cargo ships. Due to the invasion, Ukraine fully lost control of the port of Mariupol in May 2022 after Russia brutally invaded it on February 24, 2022. Of the other four important ports, Mykolaiv became inoperative due to Russia’s full-scale invasion, while the ports of Chornomorsk, Pivdennyi, and Odesa have operated at partial capacity since February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help ease the flow of goods to and from Ukraine, in May 2022, the European Commission launched the Solidarity Lanes action plan. The EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes provide logistics alternatives to Ukraine’s seaports, including rail, road, and inland waterways (Figure 1). A total of €2 billion (around $2.2 billion) has been mobilized to meet this demand. According to the European Council, as of July 2023, almost 33 million metric tons of grain (and other foodstuffs) had been exported via the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is about half of what it exported prior to the full-scale invasion. At the same time Ukraine imported essential goods such as fuel, and military and humanitarian aid was allowed to flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wWvs0mW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, in July 2022, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and the United Nations brokered the Black Sea Grain Initiative. This provided partial safety for Ukraine’s grain exports via the Black Sea ports of Odesa, Chornomorsk, and Pivdennyi for a year. Since August 2022, the initiative has enabled 32 million metric tons of Ukrainian grain and foodstuffs to be shipped across the globe. Furthermore, the initiative helped Ukraine export over 36 million metric tons of nonagricultural goods such as iron, steel, ores, and wood. However, Russia suspended the deal in July 2023 and consequently resumed heavy attacks on Ukraine’s port infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Russia fully compromised the Solidarity Lanes through the Black Sea, Ukraine launched its own alternative Black Sea corridor in August 2023. Established with the help of its Western partners, the corridor between Ukrainian ports and the Bosporus Strait has proved successful. Ships are now traveling on the western coast of the Black Sea through Romanian and Bulgarian territorial waters. Ukraine has also been exporting grain through the ports of Reni and Izmail, both on the Danube River. This new corridor allows Ukraine to continue exporting wheat, corn, sunflower oil, and barley to the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Since Russia’s refusal to continue the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Ukraine claims it has exported, as of December 2023, approximately seven million metric tons of cargo through its seaports, five million of which were Ukrainian agricultural products. According to recent reports, Ukraine is on track to export all its grain from the 2023 harvest. Nevertheless, there are still major risks as Russia continues to attack commercial ships and infrastructure and as mines float in the Black Sea waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, due to Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine is using more road and rail infrastructure to trade. Before the full-scale invasion, nonmarine modes of transportation were responsible for over 40 percent of Ukraine’s trade turnover and seaports for about 60 percent. According to author interviews with Ukrainian infrastructure and transportation experts, for most of 2023, the picture almost flipped, where rail and roads accounted for about three-fourths of Ukraine’s total trade volume and seaports accounted for about one-fourth. This situation changed dramatically after Ukraine reopened its ports in the fourth quarter of 2023. According to the experts, today, the balance between seaport and non-seaport trade turnover is about 50-50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;roads&quot;&gt;Roads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important mode of transportation for Ukraine is the road network. However, the 170,000-kilometer road network Ukraine inherited from the Soviet era was in poor condition and needed much updating. With Ukraine’s pro-Western trajectory after 2014, the government took road repair more seriously, allocating substantial sums from the state budget. Ukraine’s roads began to be brought back to life as Ukraine repaired up to 10 percent of the roads between 2016 and 2019. Moreover, in 2019, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky announced the Big Construction initiative aimed at building or repairing roads and other important infrastructure. As a result, more than 14,000 kilometers of roads were constructed or repaired in the first two years of the projectbut still not enough to cover the immense needs). This initiative then ran into problems, including lack of transparency in the bidding processes and severe corruption allegations in the state-run road agency Ukravtodor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s roads were mainly transporting higher value-added products such as finished goods (both for imports and exports), in addition to some commodities. The war has considerably changed trade dynamics as Ukraine’s roads had to absorb part of the commodities transported via seaports, mainly metals and grain. Ukraine can now export some of the grain using road and rail cargo routes via Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova, albeit with limited capacities and in some cases with political tensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Russia’s full-scale invasion, the European Union allowed tariff-free food imports from Ukraine, but that created problems for neighboring countries. In April 2023, Poland closed its border to Ukrainian grain as Polish farmers protested that their grain became less competitive. Slovakia and Hungary took similar action earlier that month. The EU farmers gained partial victory by making the European Commission impose restrictions against imports of Ukrainian grain (wheat, maize, rapeseed, sunflower seed) to Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Bulgaria. Initially, the ban was to last until June 5, 2023, but then it was extended until September 15, 2023, after which it became obsolete. However, in response to lifting the ban, Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia said they would impose unilateral import bans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift in transportation has also generated discontent among truckers in neighboring countries. In November 2023, Polish truckers initiated a boycott of one of Poland’s largest Ukraine border crossings, Medyka, in fear that an influx of Ukraine’s truckers are creating unfair competition. Polish truckers have been demanding more support from their government, including reinstating of permits and limiting the number of licenses for Ukrainian truckers. Slovakia and Hungary joined the boycotting of their own border control points a few weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This caused thousands of trucks to be stranded for miles near the borders in freezing weather, costing Ukraine’s government and the private sector a hefty sum. The total amount of trucks in queue at one point was nearing 4,000. Altogether, Poland blocked four border crossings: Korczowa-Krakivets, Hrebenne-Rava-Ruska, Dorohusk-Yahodyn, and Medyka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional potential problem is that the stranded trucks could be carrying critical humanitarian aid for Ukrainians, considering that some of these border crossings are close to transit points for humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the blockade affected a diverse range of businesses, Polish truckers are damaging Ukraine’s wood, furniture, car parts, and vegetable oil exporters and a quarter of Ukraine’s fuel supplies imports in particular. A Ukrainian trucker association estimated the blockage has already cost €400 million ($436 million) in revenue for companies. The European Business Association estimates the total losses to be much lower — around $8.5 million — based on poll results among its members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2024, Polish truckers reached an agreement with the government under certain conditions. Polish farmers also stopped a protest at Medyka after they negotiated a deal with the Polish government. Poland and Ukraine also said that they were close to an agreement on agricultural imports on March 28. However, this does not mean Ukraine will be immune to similar boycotts in the future, which presents an ongoing major risk for Ukrainian trade capacity as road transportation has become increasingly important for Ukraine. Traditionally, even before the full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s border checkpoints leading to the European Union were congested and depleted. In addition, there is still ongoing corruption at Ukraine’s customs, though authorities have been attempting to crack down on high-level officials. These fundamental challenges need to be addressed in addition to future boycotts and protests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rail&quot;&gt;Rail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with its seaports and roads, Ukraine has a strong rail infrastructure to transport goods and people — one of the biggest and most resilient in the world. According to Transparency International, before the full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s railway system — controlled by Ukrzaliznytsia (UZ), the country’s state-run rail monopoly and largest employer — was responsible for 60–75 percent of the country’s total cargo turnover, which included all of Ukraine’s major commodities: construction materials, grain, and steel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the war, almost 6,300 kilometers of track were destroyed. Along with increases in fuel costs and constant rebuilding due to Russian air strikes, the government of Ukraine decided to increase rail tariffs by 70 percent in June 2022 to make the company economically sustainable. This allowed the monopoly to achieve a financial surplus. In 2022, UZ had a deficit of 11 billion hryvnias ($290 million) as the company had to transport humanitarian aid and evacuate 3.7 million Ukrainians for free. In 2023, the situation dramatically changed, and UZ predicted it would reach 7 billion hryvnias ($190 million) in net profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2023, UZ transported 14 million metric tons of cargo, a 34 percent increase year over year. About half of this was transported domestically, and the rest was exported (of which 2.4 million was grain). Goods transported via rail today include many of the same transported before the full-scale invasion: construction materials, iron and manganese ore, and coal. What has changed are the volumes and pressure on the railway system. During war, these volumes can vary dramatically, and there is little consistency with figures (for example, grain transportation will strongly depend on whether Ukraine has the ability to export grain via the Black Sea). Furthermore, cargo routes have changed since the full-scale invasion: whereas before 2022, most of the railway cargo transportation was for domestic trade purposes, the full-scale invasion pushed the railways to fill in the export void for commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the rail sector needs reform and much work to attract international companies that could compete with their rolling stock. To reform and liberalize Ukraine’s railway system, the monopoly should become more transparent, unbundle into at least three separate businesses — infrastructure, passenger, and cargo — and uproot corruption, archaic regulation, and inefficient management. Furthermore, Ukraine’s railway infrastructure must meet the requirements of EU directives. Ukraine’s railways should integrate in unison with the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), meaning it will have to solve its gauge issue: Western Europe uses 1,435-millimeter gauge, whereas post-Soviet countries tend to use 1,540-millimeter gauge. Importantly, in coordination with the reform agenda, multilaterals will be valuable partners in providing significant financing to modernize and fix UZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air&quot;&gt;Air&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the 2022 invasion, Ukraine had bustling airport traffic, with Kyiv’s Boryspil International Airport having the highest activity by far, followed by the Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport, Kyiv International Airport–Zhuliany, Odesa International Airport, and Kharkiv International Airport. Ukraine’s airport infrastructure was up and coming since 2014, when Ukraine signed an association agreement with the European Union and has been making it easier for airline businesses — including from the United States — to operate within the country ever since. Ukraine’s airports were mainly active with passenger traffic as well as parcel transportation. Today its commercial air activity is completely on pause, and some have been severely damaged. Until the country’s skies are protected, air travel will not operate throughout the country for civilian transportation, and there is limited opportunity for some airports to be active in delivering cargo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;short-term-and-longer-term-solutions&quot;&gt;Short-Term and Longer-Term Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the war is likely to continue, Ukraine’s trade corridors in the short run need to be fully utilized and protected from Russian attacks. In the long term, Ukraine needs to rethink its existing trade corridors and reconfigure its transport and logistics infrastructure toward the EU market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the European Union has heavily supported Ukraine’s adoption and implementation of the TEN-T proposal, which would incorporate roads, inland waterways, and railways to allow more Ukrainian grain and products to be exported. There has already been €110 billion (around $119 billion) worth of investments completed along the TEN-T, including the interconnectivity of maritime, aviation, and land infrastructure. Many new standards are being optimized for more efficient rail (track speed requirements of 100 kilometers per hour for freight and 160 kilometers per hour for passenger rail), sea (alternative vessel fuels and adequate mooring/resting areas), air (new spaceports), and road transit (safe and interconnected roads to infrastructure), aiming to decrease shipping time and ensure lower carbon emissions. This initiative could create 840,000 jobs and increase EU gross domestic product by 2.4 percentage points. Of the nine TEN-T transportation corridors, four are planned to fully connect with Ukraine by 2030: the North Sea–Baltic corridor, the Baltic Sea–Black Sea–Aegean Sea corridor, the Baltic–Adriatic corridor, and the Rhine–Danube corridor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;short-term-solutions&quot;&gt;Short-Term Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;seaports&quot;&gt;Seaports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Ukraine wants to ramp up its seaport usage, it ultimately needs to deal with Russia’s continuous military threats. In this regard, stronger military protection of the region and active demining of both land and waterways are key measures to improve the security of seaports. Ukraine’s seaports could be propped up by long-range missiles and air defense that will deter Russia’s fleet farther away from Ukraine’s coast. Plenty of evidence shows this has been effective in the past. Furthermore, Ukraine’s inland waterways should be protected and cleared from mines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tool that can enable more trade via Ukraine’s seaports is war risk insurance. Currently, risk management company Marsh McLennan, in collaboration with Lloyd’s of London and the Ukrainian government, created a war insurance facility called Unity, which is meant to provide affordable insurance for grain export from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Unity will insure up to $50 million in hull and separate protection and indemnity war risk insurance, which is not a large amount in overall terms for the industry. This is where international financial institutions and development finance institutions could step in to provide additional insurance support. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is working on such a scheme, but it is still not operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;roads-and-rail&quot;&gt;Roads and Rail&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For roads and railways, there is a need to expedite border crossings. The business communities in both Ukraine and Poland have provided a list of ways to improve border control inspections by removing red tape and providing more transparency. Moreover, joint road checkpoints could be expanded to ease the flow of trucks. The Ukrainian government is already partially engaging in checkpoint expansion: just recently U.S.-based company DAI Global signed a contract with Miyamoto International to modernize crossing points on Ukraine’s border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another barrier for both transportation companies is the licensing requirements for international postal carriers. Currently, not all private sector players are allowed to receive licenses for international mail processing centers (IMPCs). The only holders of IMPCs in Ukraine are state-owned Ukrposhta and Ukrainian-Canadian company Rosan (part of the Meest Group), which curtails competition. Resolving this matter would expedite the processing and delivery of packages to and from Ukraine. In addition, Ukraine will have to fully adapt its environmental and licensing regulations for cargo transportation vehicles in line with those of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;air-1&quot;&gt;Air&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding air transport, Ukraine could boost its cargo if its western airports (for example, Lviv and Uzhhorod) are more secure and if air cargo carriers are allowed to operate. This will increase Ukraine’s trade turnover capacity, though air transport cannot fully substitute Ukraine’s road freight because it is a more expensive means of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine and the European Union could negotiate air cargo transportation by reopening the Lviv airport as an initial hub, followed by other airports in western Ukraine, which are only minutes away from EU airspace. Such air travel could be accompanied by a commercial air defense dome or a negotiation similar to the Black Sea grain corridor but only for air cargo transportation. Furthermore, if private sector players were allowed to receive licenses for IMPCs, these companies could transport goods via the skies, alleviating some of the cargo burden from the roads and diversifying the means of transportation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-term-solutions&quot;&gt;Long-Term Solutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with these short-term measures, Ukraine could envision new and expanded logistics routes to serve trade activity along the EU border. In this regard, EU membership will be a major incentive to improve the transport and logistics network and align regulations and standards to the EU market. To increase trade with the European Union, Ukraine will need to construct new roads, widen existing ones, modernize the railway system, and increase the capacity of the border checkpoints. In the long run, Ukraine will have to prioritize EU accession requirements related to infrastructure, such as TEN-T-related policies and its overall transport policy. However, Ukraine’s progress in this realm so far has been limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On road infrastructure, there is still plenty of work to be done to modernize the current system and build new infrastructure. Private capital and Western companies will play a vital role in the reconstruction of Ukraine’s roads. According to a study by the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank, public-private partnerships (PPPs) had the potential to attract approximately $2 billion in road investments from the private sector between 2021 and 2023. Ukraine could also build more roads that lead toward borders with Moldova and Romania. However, highway construction in Ukraine inherited a reputation as one of the most corrupt sectors in transportation. To address this issue, Ukraine has been implementing reforms since 2014 and needs to continue on this path. The Ukrainian government now requires each company that has won a tender must hire an engineer from the International Federation of Consulting Engineers, which provides more professionalism, transparency, efficiency, and accountability to management. Furthermore, the country’s public e-procurement system (ProZorro) has made the bidding procedure for government contracts more transparent. Ukraine has also decentralized its state roads agency, Ukravtodor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The port infrastructure requires upgrading as well, including dredging and construction of docking sites. Ukraine’s Odesa port infrastructure has ample potential to develop further, as it is connected to the Dnipro River, which has also been majorly underutilized for cargo transportation during the past decades. If Ukraine advances its river infrastructure, it will put less pressure on roads (which are more expensive for the government to maintain) and expand the overall trade capacity. Furthermore, Ukraine has the advantage of having access to the largest EU river, the Danube, which stretches to the largest EU economy — Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this regard, Romania has become a critical player in exporting Ukrainian grain in the past year, though more investments in Romanian port infrastructure may be necessary if it is to accommodate further increases in the coming months and years. The European Union and the United States have already sent a delegation to visit Izmail, as the port is key to ferrying cargo down the Danube River into Romania, which then transports the grain to Constanta for its journey into the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, maritime insurance needs to be more readily available, along with infrastructure investments in grain storage capacity in Romanian and Moldovan silos, to accommodate the increased fertilizer and grain surpluses inevitable in an unpredictable war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, countries bordering Ukraine’s western regions will have to expand their road and rail capacities as well. Land corridors that allow for trucking are still beneficial to exports, and there is a sense of urgency to widen and expand current roads that traverse out toward Moldova and Romania. With support from the European Investment Bank and EBRD, Moldova is also improving its railway network to ease Ukrainian grain shipments through Moldovan roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the freight throughput capacity of rail border crossing points between Ukraine and the European Union is low. This can be resolved by increasing administrative staff (e.g., customs, border police), modernizing equipment, and expanding infrastructure. The European Union has already contributed to the development of Ukraine’s cross-border railway infrastructure via the Connecting Europe Facility. Furthermore, Ukraine needs to have easier access to main EU distribution points such as in the Adriatic and Baltic Seas and at Danube ports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel to border issues, Ukraine’s rail system requires deep reforms to create a more competitive rail cargo transportation market that corresponds to EU standards. Currently, this is difficult considering the centralized nature of management during war where rail transportation of humanitarian goods and citizens is important for the country’s functioning. However, this does not mean Ukraine cannot start reforming UZ in the meantime. For example, Ukraine could create an independent railways regulator responsible for tariffs and overall regulation of the monopoly. Furthermore, UZ’s activities should eventually be unbundled, since currently, it has a monopoly both within rail infrastructure and within the cargo transit. The latter could be operated by private sector locomotives and transit companies, which would significantly modernize and expand the fleet. Allowing Western companies to enter would also make Ukraine less dependent on Soviet infrastructure and fleet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s current rail fleet is a remnant of the Soviet Union. Considering the increase of wear and tear on the rail fleet since Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine has not been able to keep up with the maintenance. More than 70,000 (or 70 percent) of UZ’s wagons have expired their service life, a quarter of which are in critical condition. Western companies specializing in the mechanical management of rail systems could play a significant role in modernizing Ukraine’s rail. In addition, a key problem is that the European Union and Ukraine use different gauges and wagon types, which limits the number of wagons Ukraine can use. A short-term solution could be the construction of multimodal cargo terminals located close to EU borders to convert Ukrainian rail gauge to EU gauge. Such locations can also be industrial and manufacturing hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s long-term reforms should prioritize the independence of industry regulators to ensure the market is fair and competitive. This will significantly strengthen Ukraine’s image in front of investors. As discussed, PPPs will be an important tool in attracting private investment in infrastructure. Ukraine’s lawmakers have been working on reforming Ukraine’s PPP legislation to make partnerships more transparent and create a more competitive business environment. This tool can be applied toward highway development, as done in many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s ability to trade will remain restricted as long as the Russian military threats remain high. Of the numerous challenges Ukraine faces with trade corridors, one of the primary priorities is to find solutions to protect Ukrainian ports from Russian missile strikes. Second, railways and roads need to be upgraded. Although imperfect substitutes for the existing port infrastructure, railway and road infrastructure must be modernized to complement seaport trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s vision for its economy and its future drivers will also help define the nature of its transportation network. Will the economy produce and export at higher levels than those before the full-scale invasion? Will Ukraine add more value to its raw materials and export finished goods, or will it continue to be primarily a commodity exporter? Ultimately, Ukraine’s infrastructure modernization will be intimately linked to the country’s EU accession path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Societies will be held hostage through cyberspace by states and non-state actors seeking to target the most vulnerable as part of larger political warfare campaigns waged online. In place of costly offensive cyber campaigns, malign actors will seek to undermine trust and confidence in government through disrupting basic needs and services such as food aid and medical assistance, creating an insidious new form of countervalue targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gender dynamics will increasingly play a significant role in shaping perceptions of cyber threats, especially in the context of misinformation campaigns. The manipulation of gender-based differences through deepfakes and computational propaganda will exacerbate fault lines adversaries can use to further polarize society and undermine trust and confidence in governing institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Distrust in government will be further compounded as citizens struggle to understand cybersecurity strategy and the funding levels required to protect critical infrastructure. Governments will continue to face challenges in educating the public about evolving cyber threats and balancing the ways and means required to protect the ability to provide public goods online.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the future of cyber war? Over the last 20 years, most accounts stress large-scale operations waged by states targeting rival military networks and power grids through a mix of espionage and offensive information campaigns. In these scenarios, planes fall out of the sky and entire cities go dark. Yet this vision discounts the prospects of a more indirect and insidious approach: holding a society hostage through targeting its ability to credibly share information and deliver public goods and services online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This edition of the On Future War series combines tabletop exercises, a public survey, and scenarios created with generative artificial intelligence to analyze how cyber threats are evolving. The best prediction of an uncertain future is based on combining expert opinion and public attitudes to visualize and describe cyber operations almost certain to change the character of war.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installment of On Future War uses a novel mix of expert forecasts, public surveys, and future threat scenarios generated by artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the changing character of cyber campaigns targeting the U.S. federal government. Based on data gathered from six tabletop exercises (TTXs) with over 50 leading cyber experts and foreign policy practitioners, as well as a public survey of over 1,000 participants from across the United States, experts and the public see a cyber future marked by attacks on government services, critical infrastructure, and trust in society itself. The findings highlight a preference among potential adversaries for undermining the United States through cyberattacks that cause widespread disruption in essential services and small businesses coupled with espionage campaigns designed to steal patents and support long-term technological competition. Furthermore, the findings indicate a trend toward using cyber operations to destabilize social order and undermine public trust, particularly in the context of significant political events such as elections and foreign policy crises. This finding points to a future where cyber warfare is not only a tool for direct socioeconomic disruption but also a means to sow discord and manipulate public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public survey, modeled on the project’s TTX framework, revealed a general lack of clarity and awareness about the U.S. government’s cybersecurity funding. It also unveiled a striking gender gap in perceptions: men were considerably more inclined to deem the current cybersecurity funding as sufficient compared to women. Similarly, women exhibited greater concern over the consequences of deepfake technologies compared to men. Furthermore, integrating U.S. Census Bureau and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Election Data and Science Lab data with survey results revealed that the political preferences of participants’ congressional districts had minimal influence on individual player perceptions and strategies. The research team also controlled and tested environmental socioeconomic variables at the district level — including majority–minority districts by population, household median income, educational achievement, healthcare coverage, and social net benefits — but did not find them significantly impactful on individual player perceptions. In other words, the U.S. public shares a common concern about the future of cyber war that transcends political and regional differences assumed to divide the nation. These ideas echo in Future Lab’s recent study on defending the .gov ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the evolving cyber threat landscape, a multifaceted approach is recommended. First, a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy is essential to protect social services such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, particularly during critical events such as elections. The United States cannot risk malign actors holding the most vulnerable U.S. citizens hostage during a major crisis or political transition. Second, enhancing public awareness and transparency in cybersecurity funding is vital, necessitating extensive educational campaigns and the establishment of an organization for collecting and analyzing cyber statistics. The U.S. government must engage the public with data about threats and trends. An informed polis is more resilient, but currently the U.S. government lacks a coherent, data-driven collection of cyber statistics to inform the private sector and general public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government is unlikely to mobilize sufficient attention and resources if it does not invest in public-facing data, a lesson learned long ago with respect to economic statistics. Additionally, fostering real-time information sharing among federal agencies and the private sector is key to a cohesive cyber defense strategy and maintaining public trust. With a pool of data, the government can make forecasts about future threats and better align federal resources, including money, labor, and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-changing-character-of-cyber-warfare&quot;&gt;The Changing Character of Cyber Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While scholars and practitioners once perceived cyber operations as decisive battlefield instruments that heralded a new way of war, the reality has proved to be different. States are increasingly crafting multifaceted cyber strategies that incorporate coercion and a blend of mis-, dis-, and malinformation campaigns. In place of traditional military operations, more espionage and information operations are taking place. As cyber strategies evolve beyond conventional military tactics and traditional espionage, there appears to be a marked shift in focus toward critical civilian infrastructure, reflecting a strategy aimed at exploiting the interconnectedness and vulnerabilities of modern societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;critical-infrastructure&quot;&gt;Critical Infrastructure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional focus on military and intelligence targets in cyber operations has expanded to encompass a broader spectrum of targets, including civilian critical infrastructure. This shift represents a strategic move toward countervalue targeting, where the aim is to undermine governments by digitally taking citizens hostage, thereby changing the character of the threat environment. For instance, the Volt Typhoon espionage campaign by the Chinese Communist Party in 2023 targeted critical infrastructure networks through a service provider, demonstrating the strategic value placed on these targets. Similarly, on December 23, 2015, Ukrainian energy firms suffered unexpected blackouts affecting vast customer areas, alongside reports of malicious software in various essential service sectors. Technical investigations revealed the presence of BlackEnergy malware on their systems, though its exact contribution to the incidents remains under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countervalue targeting inverts decades of military strategy and introduces a new form of cyber warfare that threatens the very foundations of civilian life. The focal point is the critical infrastructure of modern states, which is integral to the welfare of its citizens. These sectors have emerged as key battlefields in cyberspace. In fact, according to the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Campaign Dataset, states are 4.5 times more likely to see a rival target the non-security agencies of their government and the private sector than their military and intelligence agencies. This type of cyber operation is especially alarming because it threatens to severely disrupt everyday civilian services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing frequency of indiscriminate ransomware attacks across critical infrastructure sectors underscores countervalue targeting and vulnerabilities to civilian services. For example, the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, which rapidly disseminated across the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, had a highly specific and targeted nature and impacted multiple municipal emergency service providers. The convergence of digital and critical infrastructure networks opens new vulnerabilities, transforming these sectors into attractive targets for adversaries aiming to inflict economic and societal damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;political-warfare&quot;&gt;Political Warfare&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political and cognitive warfare have emerged as recent themes in the literature on modern conflict, reflecting the strategic evolution of cyber operations. Research has examined how the manipulation of digital information ecosystems, particularly through “fake news,” disinformation, and online manipulation, poses significant threats to trust in democratic institutions and processes. This manipulation is not merely an act of disinformation, but a strategic component of political warfare designed to influence and control public perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political warfare has evolved with the digital age, becoming a tool for states to achieve objectives without open conflict. Cyber operations against critical infrastructure are now part of this strategy. These actions undermine trust in democratic processes and can sway public opinion through “fake news,” disinformation, and online manipulation. Cyberattacks on infrastructure serve a dual purpose: they cause immediate disruption and exert long-term psychological impact, aligning with political warfare aims. Cognitive warfare specifically targets the way people think, influencing their actions during sensitive times such as elections. This form of warfare uses the global reach of digital technology to manipulate collective intelligence. By changing perceptions, adversaries can weaken the credibility of governments and destabilize societies from within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber operations have thus become a critical component of political and cognitive warfare. By disrupting essential services, attackers can magnify societal divisions and erode trust in public institutions, potentially manipulating the political landscape to their advantage. This is exemplified by Russia’s cyber activities, where such operations are viewed not only as a breach of digital security but as an active measure in a broader campaign of political warfare. The targeting of critical infrastructure through cyber operations becomes a tool to exacerbate existing societal divisions, weaken trust in public institutions, and ultimately alter the political landscape to favor the attacking state’s objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-trends-to-games-scenarios-and-surveys&quot;&gt;From Trends to Games, Scenarios, and Surveys&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding how these trends shape the future of cyber operations and deterrence requires pivoting from policy analysis by case study to more diverse, multi-method assessments of twenty-first-century strategic competition. Methods such as games and public surveys provide a way to compare expert assessments and attitudes among the general population. These approaches provide valuable insights into the strategic logic behind various types of cyberattacks, their impact on government services, and the necessary measures required to strengthen cybersecurity. Furthermore, public surveys can help shed light on the general awareness and perceptions of cybersecurity threats, highlighting gaps in public education and government communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using generative AI to build scenarios offers a novel mechanism for synthesizing findings and supporting policy analysis. AI-generated scenarios — especially when fine-tuned and calibrated — offer a method for turning preliminary research findings into narrative, slice-of-time scenarios. This combination of human insight and machine synthesis is a key component of the ongoing research relationship between the CSIS Futures Lab and ScaleAI. The ongoing research explores the human-machine interaction and its effect on scenario building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;would-you-like-to-play-a-game&quot;&gt;Would You Like to Play a Game?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyze how experts in cybersecurity assess emerging threats and approach cyber strategy, the researchers in the CSIS Futures Lab designed a TTX entitled Shadow Table. Shadow Table had these experts assess the optimal targets for holding the United States hostage during the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election, including recommendations for hypothetical state and non-state actors. Unbeknownst to the participants, they were randomly assigned to different groups based on how the U.S. government would seek to counter their selected strategy. As a result, the design captured adversary feedback loops while increasing the ability of the researchers to collect data on the underlying strategic logic, target preferences, and resource allocations of would-be attackers (i.e., the ends, ways, and means of cyber strategy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Futures Lab ran Shadow Table virtually with six separate groups totaling 55 participants. In each session, participants included experts in cybersecurity and cyber strategy, ranging from public and private sector chief information security officers (CISOs) to academics and national security experts. During each session, the participants played two scenarios covering major threat vectors: (1) advise a major nation-state and (2) advise a non-state actor network. In each scenario, participants could select the malign actor they wanted to advise, with states including China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea and non-state actors including right-wing extremists, left-wing extremists, and criminal groups. As a result, researchers in the CSIS Futures Lab could compare and contrast different state and non-state approaches while controlling for actor type and assess motivations through a mix of data capture and moderated discussions. Put simply, the games were built to capture strategic preferences and examine how experts anticipate malign cyber actors might target the United States during the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the state and non-state scenarios, players gave recommendations on how best to undermine U.S. elections by targeting public services administered by the federal government. These services span a broad range, encompassing essential basic needs such as food and medical assistance to economic programs such as farm loans and critical research conducted by universities and national research institutes. Specifically, players first selected how much time and effort they recommended allocating toward building malware targeting federal programs and services in three areas: (1) the provision of basic needs, (2) small and medium-sized businesses, and (3) science and technology. Second, players recommended their preferred attack method for each, recommending how to allocate a finite set of resources among four methods: (1) low-cost deepfakes, (2) low-cost disruption, (3) espionage, or (4) higher-cost, more complex degradation. Of note, these attack methods are linked to commonly accepted categories used in academic studies on cyber strategy. By forcing players to allocate scarce resources against different attack targets and methods, the game captured how experts approach cyber strategies designed to disrupt core government services during a key political transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on this design, Shadow Table served as a forum to both discuss strategy and capture statistical data on preferences. The use of TTXs as a quantitative approach to inform decisionmaking processes is an established line of practice dating back to the nineteenth century. The game design used in Shadow Table reflects emerging trends in analytical wargaming that adapt simulations to capture data in a manner that supports evidence-based policy recommendations. It expands the application of these methods from international to domestic crises, blending traditional elements such as comparing expert-vs.-public outcomes and statistical analysis with new dimensions such as electoral periods and socioeconomic factors. The methodology allows for creative self-selection by participants, focusing on their perception of roles and objectives as a mechanism for identifying different strategic approaches. This approach facilitates a quantitative analysis of political and cognitive warfare by these actors, drawing on political psychology in international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cyberattack Methods&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Deepfakes: The creation of fake images, text, and videos designed to skew public perception.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Disruption: Low-cost, temporary operations that deface websites or lead to temporary denial of service.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Espionage: Stealing sensitive information and creating access for future cyberattacks.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Degradation: More complex attacks that shut down core functions, destroy data, or take networks offline for a longer period of time.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shadow-table-findings&quot;&gt;Shadow Table Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, experts selected the option to disrupt basic needs more than other targets, and the preference was statistically significant in both the state and non-state threat scenarios. Figures 2.1 and 2.2 illustrate expert targeting preferences most likely to disrupt trust and confidence in the U.S. federal government during a key political transition such as an election or during a foreign policy crisis. The majority of experts prioritized attacks on the provision of basic needs, reflecting a strategy to disrupt the lives of civilians and potentially cause unrest during elections. This preference for targeting basic needs was consistent regardless of whether participants were playing as state or non-state actors, underscoring the perceived effectiveness of such attacks in destabilizing the U.S. federal government and its executive agencies. Furthermore, the choice of target indicates that attackers prefer to sow chaos or tap into the deep personal fears of civilians that rely on such basic needs. For example, SNAP food assistance alone serves as a lifeline for over 40 million socioeconomically disadvantaged U.S. citizens. Disrupting food access during an election could catalyze further polarization and even unrest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During discussions, participants detailed their strategic logic and the utility of targeting basic needs. Experts saw this attack vector as the best placed to create chaos and increase public mistrust in institutions. Furthermore, groups discussed how these attacks — if effective — could lead to protests, unrest, and a loss of trust in the U.S. government’s ability to protect basic needs. In addition, experts saw the resulting economic distress and fear amplify public discontent and raise questions about the competence and reliability of government institutions. Expert discussions revealed a prevailing assessment that compromising people’s basic needs could also make the population at large more susceptible to dis- and misinformation campaigns, thereby opening up additional vectors for foreign manipulation and radicalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, experts saw targeting vulnerable groups as the best way to undermine the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2.2: State Actor Targeting Preferences.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Futures Lab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, experts noted opportunities for sowing chaos by targeting federal agencies supporting small and medium-sized businesses. For example, targeting federal grants administrated through agencies such as the Small Business Administration could produce a cascading economic effect. In 2023, the agency delivered over $50 billion in assistance, with much of it focused on underserved communities that experts perceived as likely to amplify political discord. Even more disturbing, cyberattacks that manipulated economic data produced by the U.S. Departments of Labor and Commerce could easily cause disruption to financial markets that rely on credible government statistics. Experts saw federal agencies that support economic activity as being most susceptible to cascading effects, with even small intrusions creating fear and panic likely to undermine trust and confidence in the federal government. The participants shared a perception that such attacks would not only cause direct harm but also create a domino effect, impacting the economy and increasing public discontent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to target preferences, researchers in the CSIS Futures Lab analyzed how experts allocated resources to different attack types across the two scenarios. To capture this data, the TTX forced players to allocate notional resource points across four potential cyberattack methods: (1) the use of deepfakes to alter public perception, (2) low-cost disruptions (e.g., website defacement and limited denial-of-service attacks), (3) espionage campaigns designed to steal data and gain access for future attacks, and (4) more complex degradation attacks capable of shutting down entire networks or services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in Figure 3.1, when analyzing non-state attack vectors, experts had a fairly balanced approach outside of deepfakes and had preferences for conducting espionage against agencies involved in science and technology. During the discussions, participants assessed that unlike traditional state-based cyber operations, their espionage preference with respect to non-state actors was more about extracting information for follow-on mis-, dis-, and malinformation campaigns linked to the use of deepfakes. By compromising scientific data or spreading misinformation, adversaries could increase doubt in government policies and actions, leading to public confusion and weakened trust in the current presidential administration. Participants acknowledged the role of science and technology in responding to national emergencies and health crises, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. They saw the potential to undermine public trust in government responses by targeting and distorting scientific data related to vaccination efficacy, treatment protocols, or disease spread. Participants noted that adversaries could amplify existing controversies, such as those surrounding climate change or vaccinations, to intensify polarization and create a society where truth is obscured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in Figure 3.2, when participants analyzed optimal targets for state actors, they adopted a similar set of preferences. Experts see espionage as a tool to win long-term technology competition with authoritarian states eager to steal intellectual property (IP), a finding that parallels previous CSIS research efforts. Second, while disruption was the preferred attack method for basic services and agencies supporting small and medium-sized businesses, experts assumed that states such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea would invest more effort in disrupting basic services. This was consistent across the state and non-state actor scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BoF1pTF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking across the games, it is clear that experts see vulnerabilities in the federal agencies. These experts see viable attack options for authoritarian states seeking to create chaos during an election by disrupting the delivery of food and medical care to vulnerable populations and distorting economic data and assistance to U.S. businesses. They see non-state actors as eager to launch similar campaigns but leverage mis-, dis-, and malinformation to further polarize the country by distorting public health research. This attack logic speaks to the importance of federal services and associated critical infrastructure and how these critical requirements for modern society are also critical vulnerabilities if left unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-games-to-public-surveys&quot;&gt;From Games to Public Surveys&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compare observations from experts gathered during the TTX with the general public, researchers at the CSIS Futures Lab converted the game into a public survey using the online platform Prolific. The researchers ensured that the participants were from sufficiently diverse backgrounds and geographic locations to reflect the demographic makeup of the United States. In adapting Shadow Table, the research team also built in attention checks and only recorded responses where the respondents passed these checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the original TTX, participants were randomly assigned into either a state or non-state malign actor group and asked to make recommendations about their preferred target (i.e., basic needs, small and medium-sized businesses, or science and technology) and method (i.e., deepfakes, disruptions, espionage, or degradation). Unlike the expert TTX, the researchers did not have the general public weight assign resource values to their attack methods, given that the general public was likely to be less familiar with cybersecurity and foreign policy issues. Thus, when juxtaposing the outcomes from both expert and public samples, the research team focused on their initial choices. These choices reflect how different groups image cyber strategy preferences of malign actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were presented with descriptions of two types of cyberattacks. The first was a conventional distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, while the second involved the use of deepfakes and disinformation to tamper with health records. When asked which type of attack was more worrisome, respondents indicated that the attack involving deepfakes was of greater concern than the traditional DDoS cyberattack. Deepfakes are emerging as a significant concern in cyber warfare tactics. This was supported by the TTX, which highlighted that deepfakes are increasingly used to spread hostility and disrupt societal harmony for political gains. These digitally manipulated videos or images can convincingly depict individuals saying or doing things they never did, thereby posing unique challenges in ensuring information authenticity and maintaining trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To deepen the understanding of participant preferences, the research integrated U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2021 American Community Survey five-year estimate, providing socioeconomic and geometric details at the congressional district level. In addition, the researchers integrated data from the MIT Election Data and Science Lab, focusing on congressional elections. As seen in Figure 4, the player sample is distributed across the continental United States. The player population can be observed through its density, whereby increments increase the size of each circle. In addition, this map is colored by party affiliation for each district as of the 116th Congress (2019–20). The color schemes follow blue for Democratic districts and red for Republican districts. As the map shows, the sample is geographically and politically representative of the U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final dataset included players’ congressional district information; socioeconomic variables on race, income, healthcare coverage, social net benefits, and poverty; and MIT election data, confirming that the survey was geographically representative of the U.S. population. At a granular level, zip code analysis was also conducted, but results did not deviate from the orginal analysis at the congressional district level. The detailed statistical results are available in the accompanying methodology annex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;findings&quot;&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the public thinks that the most likely states to target U.S. federal agencies and critical infrastructure are Russia and China. Similar to the experts, they see these states as focused on disrupting how the U.S. federal government and executive agencies distribute basic services such as food and medical assistance and as likely to use deepfakes to undermine trust in institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in Table 1, both experts and the public view Russia and China as the predominant authoritarian states interested in undermining U.S. public institutions. Similar to the TTX, the public survey started with adopting an adversary role (either state or non-state). Participants were tasked with selecting the entities in both categories. Experts that engaged in the virtual TTX leaned more toward Russia (57 percent), while the public favored China (47 percent). Apart from this divergence, results show that experts and the public converge on similar preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/07BVKe4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general public is worried about Russia and China and sees these states as most likely to target federal executive services and critical infrastructure linked to basic needs. As seen in Figure 5, 49 percent of participants selected basic needs as their first choice overall. These findings are consistent with the expert TTX observations in which players identified disrupting basic services as the optimal mechanism for causing chaos sufficient to undermine trust and confidence in the U.S. government during an election and, by extension, future foreign policy crises. In other words, the traditional defensive advantages provided by the United States’ geography, including separation from adversaries across oceans, is fading fast as malign actors seek ways of launching attacks through cyberspace against core government functions and critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5wIyj78.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5: Public Federal Service Targeting Preferences.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS Futures Lab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategy — the alignment of ends, ways, and means — proved consistent between expert TTXs and the survey of the general public. Both groups prioritized low-cost cyber disruptions against federal agencies and critical infrastructure linked to basic needs and deepfakes linked to science and technology. Figure 6 shows that 60 percent of participants chose to disrupt when targeting basic needs, and 28 percent chose deepfakes when targeting services related to science and technology. The shared preference for using deepfakes to target science and technology is consistent with documented disinformation campaigns during the pandemic that had polarizing effects. In other words, it is not just basic services and critical infrastructure that are vulnerable and at risk during political transitions and crises. Malign actors at home and abroad will target the very foundations of scientific truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the public survey, there are clear differences in how different genders and demographic cohorts’ approach cyber strategy. Men are less concerned about deepfakes and believe the government is allocating enough money to cybersecurity. For example, men were 48 percent more likely than women to believe that current spending is sufficient. These concerns are not affected by median household income or party preferences. In other words, gender differences can predict cyber strategy preferences. One possible explanation is that women have disproportionately been victimized by social media and deepfakes, including revenge porn and fabricated images, which likely shapes how they view the future of federal cybersecurity. This dark truth translates into the rational calculation for women to be both more concerned about the risks of deepfakes and more likely to want increased U.S. government funding for cybersecurity. Notably, this does not appear to be a partisan issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IVLOYLW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cybersecurity and Gender&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The odds that a man is concerned about deepfakes as a form of political warfare are 27 percent lower than surveyed women. Men are also 48 percent more likely to believe the federal government is allocating sufficient funds for cybersecurity.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, age matters. There are clear demographic cohort effects that shape how U.S. citizens see future cyber campaigns designed to hold the .gov ecosystem at risk. Older cohorts (i.e., aged 55 to 64 or over 65) tend to recommend espionage and targeting science and technology more than basic needs and federal services that assist small and medium-sized businesses. The most likely explanation for this divergence is rational. Older Americans, especially those over 65, are more likely to draw on federal programs associated with basic needs, including Medicare and Social Security. Similar to the findings associated with gender, even when survey respondents imagine future cyber campaigns, they tend to avoid targets that would bring them harm in their daily lives. An alternative explanation is that older Americans came of age in an era more defined by public sector basic research and major programs — such as during the Space Race — that they associate with national power and pride. However, both of these explanations are best guesses as to why there are age cohort effects associated with how Americans imagine future malign campaigns designed to hold the nation hostage in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team used zip code-level data to conduct robustness checks. The analysis confirmed that gender and age are associated with how groups think malign actors will target the U.S. federal government in cyberspace. Specifically, older cohorts (i.e., aged 55 to 64 and over 65) remain less likely to target basic services and government programs associated with supporting small and medium-sized businesses. These cohorts are more likely to recommend cyber campaigns targeting science and technology. Factors such as political party affiliation, income levels, and majority-minority districts are not statistically significant. This contrast implies that gender and demographic cohorts play a larger role than political ideology, income, or race and ethnicity in shaping how Americans imagine the risks from cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the district-level analysis, party linkage emerges as possible factors shaping malign cyber strategy preferences in the zip code-level robustness check. In Democratic and mixed political zip codes, participants were less likely to target small and medium-sized businesses. This finding further demonstrates rational preferences by the U.S. public with respect to cyber strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, political ideology did not appear to alter which rival foreign state participants perceived as likely to hold the U.S. government hostage during the upcoming 2024 presidential election. Where participants live (i.e., Democratic- or Republican-leaning zip codes) did not have an impact on the state actor they selected (i.e., Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea). This finding extends to non-state actors. While one might assume Republican-leaning districts would be more likely to select left-wing groups as the malign actor, and Democrats the opposite, this was not the case. The only difference appeared with respect to non-state actor motivation, with Democrat-leaning zip codes being more associated with “lone wolf” cyber actors as opposed to financially motivated cyberattacks (i.e., cybercrime). This difference may suggest that political ideology shapes how people view opposing group motivations, with Democrat-leaning areas more inclined to see malign activity in cyberspace by non-state actors associated with isolated political radicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-surveys-to-scenarios&quot;&gt;From Surveys to Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To visualize and describe the findings from experts and general public TTXs, the research team employed a novel approach to constructing scenarios that drew on generative AI. Specifically, the CSIS Futures Lab loaded the text transcripts from the TTXs, comments from the public surveys, and a corpus of over 300 documents on cyber operations and modern strategy to fine-tune a model using Scale AI’s Donovan platform and a retrieval assisted generation (RAG) large language model (LLM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A Recipe for AI-Generated Scenarios&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Select a base LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, or Llama).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Add a corpus of authoritative texts on strategy and critical factors the model can reference.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mix in structured observations about ends, ways, means, and feedback loops (e.g., TTX transcripts).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Garnish with tailored prompts (e.g., using trends and themes to refine questions about alternative futures).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RAG works to optimize how the base model classifies text (i.e., fine-tuning) and predicts the next logical sequence. By using a select corpus trained on cyber and great power competition, the expectation is that text generated in response to queries is more accurate and aligns with key concepts. This fine-tuning is further enhanced by training the model with the prompts that are based on the emerging themes of TTX discussions. To facilitate this process of refinement and structure prompts given to the LLM, the CSIS Futures Lab defined a series of trends based on analyzing the TTX results. In other words, the model used thousands of pages of texts and transcripts to answer prompts about how discrete trends could comingle to produce alternative futures. The result is a series of “slices-of-time” that provide portraits of alternative futures in which malign actors seek to hold the United States hostage by launching cyber campaigns targeting federal executive agencies and critical infrastructure during political transitions and foreign policy crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of LLMs in this context is a time-efficient method that enhances understanding but requires skilled handling to avoid biases. In military planning, the effective use of LLMs depends on translating critical thinking and research into structured queries for the AI model. These models complement, rather than replace, human expertise, and military professionals must adeptly convert their knowledge and concepts into AI-interrogable formats. Generative AI, increasingly used in social science, offers significant opportunities and challenges when integrated into wargaming, red teaming, and scenario construction. It can subtly influence crucial leadership decisions and is subject to the “black box” challenge, where the reasoning behind AI-generated outcomes is not always clear. This necessitates ethical governance, transparent methods, and accountability to responsibly manage AI’s role in wargaming, a key factor in determining future conflict outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;societies-held-hostage&quot;&gt;Societies Held Hostage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first major trend that emerged from the TTX discussions concerned how interdependence creates new forms of vulnerability. A connected society requires a mix of online government services and critical infrastructure to function. As a result, the disruption of basic needs and polarizing deepfakes (i.e., disinformation) can amplify underlying fault lines in society during political transitions and foreign policy crises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differences in State Actors’ Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TTX participants pointed out that there are significant differences in the strategies of different state actors. During the TTXs, Russia, for instance, was more engaged in disruptive cyber activities, while China was more focused on strategic and espionage-oriented approaches. This assumption is consistent with academic literature on different state strategies in cyberspace. As a result, cyber defense strategies — in both the public and private sectors — need to adapt to different threat characteristics. This process of adaptation will require access to public data on different threat vectors, including statistics on how new attacks compare to past efforts (i.e., cyber statistics).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaos and Instability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An overarching theme was the creation of chaos and instability, especially with the upcoming 2024 election in mind. By targeting critical services and undermining public confidence, state actors could weaken the U.S. federal government’s legitimacy and provoke divisive reactions among the population. This focus on windows of political vulnerability highlights a need to ensure there are sufficient resources as well as collaboration with the private sector to deny adversaries the ability to hold the United States hostage during its political transitions or foreign policy crises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priority on Disruption and Immediate Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The immediate disruption of services and the ensuing chaos was identified as a key strategy that attackers may prioritize. These tactics aim to impact public perception in the short term leading up to the 2024 election. By causing immediate and visible disruptions, the attackers could potentially cause widespread panic and a loss of confidence among the public in the government’s capabilities. This emphasizes the need for robust disaster recovery plans and the ability to quickly restore services after an attack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Domain Attacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another emerging pattern was the idea of cross-domain attacks that not only involve cyberattacks but also physical disruptions. For instance, cyber-physical attacks on critical infrastructure could amplify the overall impact of the attacks, increasing their effectiveness in sowing discord and undermining public confidence. This highlights the need for defenses that extend beyond purely digital assets and can also protect against physical disruptions resulting from cyberattacks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these dynamics, the CSIS Futures Lab generated the following scenario using Donovan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Fracturing Trust&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the run-up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, two distinct trends of cyber activity involving Russian and Chinese actors emerge. Leveraging cyber strategies that have been evident in previous conflicts, Russian state operatives appear intent on fanning the flames of political discord within the U.S. electorate. Concurrently, Chinese state-sponsored black-hat hackers are continuously launching large-scale operations aimed at pilfering unprotected IP databases within the United States.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russian cyber activities cast a long shadow of a Cold War-style influence operation that deploys strategically crafted disinformation and propaganda campaigns. These campaigns, which are designed to fracture public resolutions and incite social chaos, allude to the tactics used to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. There appears to be an orchestrated effort to manipulate political perceptions and beliefs in an attempt to shift the electoral landscape in a direction favorable to Russian strategic interests.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;China’s cyber activities, in stark contrast, possess apparent economic drivers. The IP of the United States, held in the form of patents, methodologies, and blueprints, are the primary focus of these cyber breaches. By syphoning off such data, China could potentially undercut U.S. economic competitiveness on a global platform.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inevitably, these trends converge, resulting in a dire situation for the United States. The effects of these cyber operations are not restricted to abstract sociopolitical and economic dimensions. Both Russian and Chinese operations have displayed a propensity to target U.S. critical infrastructure, specifically the federal systems that deliver basic assistance programs. Such activities could severely undermine the trust and confidence of U.S. citizens in the government’s ability to ensure their welfare.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is a good example of how these developments could take place in the near future given the vulnerabilities identified during the TTXs and public survey. Of note, the scenario is also the most logical extrapolation from recent trends in cyber operations and great power competition. According to the scenario, the focus of Russian operatives on disseminating disinformation and propaganda to influence public perception and create social chaos is consistent with the document’s findings on political and cognitive warfare. Similarly, in line with findings from the TTXs, espionage, particularly in the science and technology domain, has a strategic emphasis on cyber threats. This resonates with the activities of Chinese hackers, which center on IP theft to undercut U.S. economic competitiveness. This scenario shows the need for robust measures against potential disinformation campaigns using deepfakes and espionage activities against research and development. If the U.S. government cannot find a way to address deepfakes and protect its science and technology enterprise, the country will be increasingly vulnerable and subject to coercion in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gender-dynamics-will-continue-to-shape-how-the-public-views-cybersecurity&quot;&gt;Gender Dynamics Will Continue to Shape How the Public Views Cybersecurity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second major trend observed concerns the rise of mis-, dis-, and malinformation. During the TTXs, participants focused on rising threats related to deepfakes and AI. The public survey confirmed these concerns but highlighted a clear divide between how self-identified men and women view the threat of deepfakes. As a result, future campaigns to hold the United States hostage during a political transition or foreign policy crisis are likely to see disinformation campaigns tailored to different segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disinformation and Manipulation of Stolen Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During the TTXs, there was a debate regarding the effectiveness of deepfakes and disinformation campaigns in swaying public opinion. Some participants argued that these tactics might sow discord rather than significantly change people’s minds. This discussion pointed toward the potential for dis- and misinformation campaigns to amplify existing social cleavages. Even small groups with hardened worldviews can amplify disinformation and spread it outside their networks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gender Gap and Utilization of Deepfakes and Disinformation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During the TTXs, participants highlighted how malign actors could use deepfakes to make the government appear incompetent or even outright malicious in delivering essential needs. Combining real information leaks with deepfakes could further erode trust in the government’s crisis management capabilities. Additionally, the public survey highlighted how gender and age cohort differences shape how the U.S. public views cybersecurity. This disparity in sensitivity offers adversaries an opportunity to tailor attacks that exacerbate confusion, complicating the development of effective strategies to counter these threats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Gender Divide in Cyber Warfare&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Heading into the contentious 2024 U.S. presidential election, extensive studies revealed that women voters expressed far greater concern about potential deepfake videos and manipulated information than men. This gender disparity offered a prime opportunity for exploitation by foreign adversaries keen on disrupting U.S. democracy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the months before the election, Russian state-sponsored disinformation campaigns specifically targeted women voters across social media. Fake news stories and doctored videos portrayed female political candidates as corrupt, unqualified, and even mentally unstable. Some deepfake footage depicted female candidates making inflammatory racist and misogynistic remarks. Other manipulated videos showed women lawmakers struggling to respond coherently to basic policy questions. Many appeared designed to prey on gender biases that question women’s competency for high office. The goal was to suppress support for female candidates among women voters.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, Chinese cyber operatives stole massive datasets from women’s health organizations and services. They threatened to leak sensitive medical records of female patients from Planned Parenthood and OBGYN practices unless demands were met. This sparked fears that hacked personal health information could be used for blackmail or extortion. Patients worried that intimate details about reproductive health, pregnancies, and sexual health could be made public in an attempt to ruin reputations and lives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In the wake of the election, Russian disinformation tactics continued preying on female voter anxieties. Deepfake videos portrayed female members of the cabinet as inept crisis managers unable to deliver basic government assistance to struggling Americans. Doctored footage showed relief supplies rotting in warehouses due to incompetence as Americans suffered.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the first scenario, the above vignette shows how generative AI can help visualize alternative futures based on critical outcomes. AI is not magic. It is math. And the integration of datasets on strategy, net assessment, and cyber operations, alongside transcripts from the games, alters how the underlying model weights different text combinations to write the story. This story is best characterized as a “what if” scenario and a demonstration of how a particular outcome — regardless of party — intersects with observed patterns and trends in cyber operations as they relate to disinformation. Here the model assumes that a woman — regardless of party — wins the 2024 presidential election, a prospect current polling suggests as unlikely but not impossible. Rather than interpret the results as forecasts about elections, the better perspective is to use the fictional future scenario as a foundation for discussing how authoritarian states are and will likely continue to target gender fault lines in the United States. This focus of discontent could create new preferences for how malign actors will seek to target federal executive agencies and critical infrastructure, with a particular focus on health and human services as well as medical providers highlighted in the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;distrust-in-government-will-continue&quot;&gt;Distrust in Government Will Continue&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third major trend observed across the TTXs and public survey responses concerns the declining trust in government across democratic societies and the United States, in particular. There was an underlying assumption across different groups that free people currently experience a trust deficit. According to a recent Pew Research, the U.S. trust in the federal government decline from 73 percent in 1958 to 16 percent in 2023. A second major trend observed concerns the rise of mis-, dis-, and malinformation. During the TTXs, participants focused on rising threats related to deepfakes and AI. The public survey confirmed these concerns but highlighted a clear divide between how self-identified men and women view the threat of deepfakes. As a result, the future campaigns to hold the United States hostage during a political transition or foreign policy crisis are likely to see such campaigns tailored to different segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Propaganda by Deed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A nineteenth- and twentieth-century tactic of using protests, terrorist attacks, and other subversive deeds to catalyze further unrest and even open revolt. The idea is closely linked to revolutionary theory and the concept of a “foco” used by Che Guerva. The concept has been used by modern terrorist organizations and is increasingly associated with far right-wing and Islamic extremists.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disrupting State and Local Elections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participants in the TTX underscored the value of targeting state and local election systems, perceiving them to be more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Such attacks could disrupt the electoral process and weaken faith in the democratic system. More important, this reflected a desire to sow discontent by making it appear that every local disruption was a function of systemic issues at the federal level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Espionage and Long-Term Goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Across the TTX and public surveys, participants saw espionage as more than just a means to steal information and technology. They also saw it as a way to undermine trust in government, as Americans perceived each new breach as a sign of a breakdown of sovereignty and the ability of the federal government to safeguard U.S. innovation and the personal information its citizens. This desire to steal IP and undermine trust was seen by participants as a long-term goal beyond any one political transition or foreign policy crisis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance of Insider Threats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The threat posed by insiders, whether intentional or accidental, was a key point in the TTX discussions. Participants noted that insiders, whether in the United States or other countries, could potentially compromise federal networks. This highlights the need for a holistic approach to cybersecurity that goes beyond protecting against external threats and also addresses the potential risks posed by insiders. It also shows how the breakdown in trust creates new threat vectors as disenfranchised citizens look for new forms of protest and “propaganda by deed.” This threat parallels the broader phenomenon also on display in the rise of activities such as swatting involving federal or local elected officials, which involves falsely calling in SWAT teams to a’ residence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Timing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TTX discussions also pointed to the importance of timing in launching cyber operations designed to undermine trust and confidence in the U.S. government. The participants noted that attackers are likely to time their attacks to coincide with critical events, such as elections or other moments of national significance, to maximize their impact and influence public sentiment. This underlines the need for heightened vigilance during such periods and the importance of having contingency plans in place. It also suggests that cyber operations have become a form of propaganda by deed in networked societies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on these dynamics, the CSIS Futures Lab generated the following scenario using Donovan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Chaos at the Ballot Box&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The 2024 U.S. presidential election highlights intensifying cyber threats seeking to undermine democracy and national security. Russian hackers disrupt local election systems and infrastructure, timing attacks for maximum impact. Chinese operatives focus on espionage targeting confidential data to advance long-term strategic interests. Meanwhile, insider threats pose increasing risks of unauthorized disclosures and system compromises.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Prior to the election, a disgruntled federal contractor with access to classified systems leaks troves of confidential documents revealing the government’s cyber capabilities and gaps. Adversaries gain insight, enabling more successful future attacks on exploited weaknesses.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Weeks before the 2024 election, ransomware strikes voter registration databases in six key battleground states right before registration deadlines. Chaos ensues at local election offices as critical voter rolls are locked down. Tens of thousands lose the ability to update their registration status, request absentee ballots, or fix errors ahead of election day.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;On election day, reporting systems crash in counties across swing states, delaying results. Claims of voter suppression and fraud spread. Protests form amid the uncertainty calling the election’s integrity into question.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Throughout the election, Chinese hackers steal datasets from both political parties and all levels of government. In the long term, this facilitates future blackmail and enormous economic advantage from pilfered trade secrets, IP, and proprietary research.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the second scenario (The Gender Divide in Cyber Warfare), the above vignette shows how generative AI can help visualize alternative futures based on the convergence of key trends. Here the prompts based on trends observed during the TTXs change how the model weights words and their sequence to write a dystopian story. Like wargames, these scenarios are not predictive as much they are illustrative, a helpful mechanism for catalyzing policy debates and security assessments. As a result, the story is a gateway to a larger set of stress tests and red-teaming efforts required to identify vulnerabilities that a mix of foreign states and insiders could use to attack federal agencies and critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-implications&quot;&gt;Policy Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A connected society is as vulnerable as it prosperous. Each connection creates possibilities for exchanging goods and ideas but opens a vector for spreading malware and holding the entire system hostage. As a result, modern resilience starts with cybersecurity and ensuring that the federal government and critical infrastructure are sufficiently protected from both foreign and domestic threats. Seen in this light, the following policy recommendations warrant further debate and considerations based on the findings from the TTXs, public survey, and generative AI scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;charting-a-path-toward-comprehensive-cybersecurity-for-essential-services&quot;&gt;Charting a Path toward Comprehensive Cybersecurity for Essential Services&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major finding across all the games, surveys, and scenarios was that future cyber threats will increasingly target the basic needs provided by the federal government as a way of holding the United States hostage during political transitions and foreign policy crises. Traditionally, cyber defense focused on sensitive military and intelligence infrastructure, but this observation changes the logic. Increasingly both federal CISOs and actors such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will need to prioritize protecting services such as providing food and healthcare to large segments of the U.S. public. These ideas echo the larger recent study on defending the .gov ecosystem. Furthermore, this new focus on public needs will likely require expanding core programs such as threat hunting to include more active red teaming and dynamic consequence management exercises that include stress testing how best to engage the public during a cyber crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;addressing-gender-and-age-dynamics-in-cyber-threat-perception&quot;&gt;Addressing Gender and Age Dynamics in Cyber Threat Perception&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that gender and age are playing a significant role in shaping perceptions of cyber threats — particularly in the context of misinformation campaigns — means the federal government has to change how it assesses threats and communicates with the U.S. public. Women’s heightened concern about deepfakes and misinformation calls for targeted strategies to address and counter these threats that will likely involve working with private sector social media companies. More generally, CISOs across the federal government, and CISA in particular, will need to incorporate gendered perspectives into cybersecurity policies and awareness campaigns. This could involve conducting gender-specific studies to understand varying threat perceptions and developing tailored public awareness initiatives that address these concerns. By acknowledging and addressing gender-based and age-based differences in cyber threat perception, public communication strategy can become more effective in countering misinformation campaigns and preventing societal divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-public-awareness-and-transparency-in-cybersecurity-funding&quot;&gt;Enhancing Public Awareness and Transparency in Cybersecurity Funding&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apparent lack of public awareness about government funding and efforts in cybersecurity underscores the need for transparent and persistent communication strategies. The federal government must actively engage with the public to explain the complexities of the cyber threat landscape and the importance of resilience building. This recommendation involves not only investing in robust cybersecurity measures but also in extensive public education and information campaigns. By improving public understanding and involvement in cybersecurity matters, governments can strengthen societal resilience against cyber threats and ensure a more informed and cooperative approach to national cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;funding-an-entity-to-collect-analyze-and-share-cyber-statistics&quot;&gt;Funding an Entity to Collect, Analyze, and Share Cyber Statistics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were expert debates and disagreement across demographic cohorts about whether or not the U.S. government sufficiently resources cybersecurity. This divergence likely speaks to a larger issue: the public does not understand the full extent of the threat and experts are often lost in debating different aspects. There is no, single credible source of information about cyberattacks in the same way that there are public databases on everything from weather patterns to crime statistics to economic data. It should come as no surprise that large segments of the U.S. population see a threat but struggle to understand what the right balance of ways and means is to reach the goal of secure online services and critical infrastructure. Therefore, the U.S. government — whether in the Office of the Cyber Director or CISA — needs to establish an outlet for publishing cyber statistics. This effort should build on new public and private sector data pooling initiatives and ensure cyber dashboards are as accessible to a woman in rural Kansas as they are to a federal CISO in Washington. With a pool of data, the government can make forecasts about future threats and better align federal resources, including money, labor, and technology. This will allow the government to better inform the private sector and general public about the cyber threats and cybersecurity measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shape of the threat is clear. As science fiction writer William Gibson puts it, “The future is already here, it is just not evenly distributed.” The United States has already seen massive data breaches, IP theft, and efforts to plant malware on its critical infrastructure. Foreign actors increasingly look like they are employing cyberattack vectors targeting the federal government and critical infrastructure to “wreak havoc.” The open question is what the United States will do about it. The games, surveys, and generative AI scenarios in this paper represent an effort by the CSIS Futures Lab to employ novel research methods to understand modern policy challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addressing these threats requires open, honest debate that embraces not just opinion but also large datasets, facts, and even creative scenarios. Diversity of thought and perspective will lead to deeper insights. Too often security questions are treated as sensitive and closed policy discussions, limiting the ability of an educated public to debate the best course of action. Democracy requires these debates and a vibrant marketplace of ideas. Securing the connectivity the U.S. citizens rely on is too important to be left to unaccountable experts debating a handful of marquee case studies and opaque security programs. The public has a stake in understanding the threat and debating how best to confront it. That debate will be messy, but then again so is democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has reshaped perceptions of influence, Central Asia has surged to prominence in the 21st-century geopolitical arena. Recognising its newfound importance, the West seems to have pivoted its focus towards the region, one which Russia has long viewed as its backyard and where China has become increasingly economically dominant. Summits in the 5+1 format (with Central Asia’s five republics) have already been organised by the US (September 2023) and Germany (October 2023), with the UK and Italy also expected to host their own. Added to this, European politicians have embarked on tours of Central Asia, such as German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (June 2023), French President Emmanuel Macron (November 2023) and Italian President Sergio Mattarella (November 2023). Do these activities allow us to speculate that we are witnessing a Great Game 2.0., a sequel to the multifaceted geopolitical competition that once took place over Central Asia between the Russian and British Empires? Whether this is the case or not, it is a fact that the current Central Asian geopolitical context features more actors, including multiple Western powers, China and, to some extent, India and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Azerbaijan, which is determined to become an integral piece in the puzzle of Central Asian geopolitics. In its pivot to Central Asia, Baku’s ambitions, position and attitude are certainly different from those of the above-mentioned countries. Since its independence in 1991, Azerbaijan has directed almost all of its resources toward the resolution of the decades-long Karabakh conflict. Now, with the finalisation of the Karabakh chapter and the restoration of its territorial integrity, Azerbaijan needs to rethink and reshape its foreign policy priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baku’s foreign policy over the past 15–16 years has been marked by a balancing or “equidistance” between Russo-centric Eurasian structures and the Western power bloc. The hostility between Russia and the West has only strengthened Azerbaijan’s determination not to align itself with either of the confronting parties. At the same time, this has led to a quest for a new geopolitical structure and direction for Baku’s foreign policy and economic development. Here, Central Asia emerges as a potential strategic partner for Azerbaijan, offering a mutually beneficial geopolitical and economic alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This geopolitical calculation is driven by several factors, but mostly by common roots, ethnolinguistic kinship and a shared historical legacy. The concept of Turkic unity itself originated in Azerbaijan during the late 19th century, while Azerbaijan together with Turkey has been zealously pushing the Turkic agenda and integrationist projects since the 1990s. Although these initiatives were initially rooted in and designed to promote cultural ties between Turkic societies, there has been a noticeable shift, in recent years, towards greater political and economic convergence among the Turkic states. The Organization of Turkic States (OTS), loosely modelled on the EU, possesses the potential to evolve into a supranational organisation if effectively managed. OTS member states have also had the chance to turn their integrationist ideas into tangible projects such as the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route – also known as the Middle Corridor – whose significance has only been growing in light of the Russo-Ukrainian war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Azerbaijan aims to position itself not only as a Caucasian or Caspian state but also as a bridge to Central Asia&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increased importance of the Middle Corridor is also attracting greater international attention to the region. The EU recently announced the allocation of €10 billion for the development of this massive connectivity project, which would circumvent Russian infrastructure. Within this substantial investment, 33 infrastructure projects, with a particular focus on rail initiatives, are earmarked for financing. The Middle Corridor further accentuates the key position of Azerbaijan, which plays a crucial role in this framework by serving as a vital link between Europe and Asia. This significance is attributed to its well-established transportation infrastructure, featuring ports along the Caspian Sea and robust connections with neighbouring countries such as Georgia and Turkey, which comprise the European leg of the Middle Corridor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Azerbaijan – or more precisely, the Azerbaijan–Turkey tandem (as the two countries usually work together in such geopolitical and geo-economic projects) – can become a bottleneck for the West, which seeks to establish deeper connections with Central Asia. Having economically expanded into Central Asia since the 1990s, Turkey has also grown its political and even military presence in the region by signing military agreements with Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan and selling Turkish UAVs (drones) to Kyrgyzstan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of Azerbaijan’s relations with Central Asia is being fostered on both shores of the Caspian Sea. This explains Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev’s participation as an “honoured guest” at the 5th Consultative Meeting of the Heads of State of Central Asia, held in Dushanbe in September 2023. The inclusion of Aliyev indicates that Central Asian countries are increasingly acknowledging Azerbaijan as an integral participant in their regional dynamics. At the same time, Aliyev himself, in his latest remarks – especially in his inauguration speech in February – has placed special emphasis on relations with the Turkic states of Central Asia when announcing “our family is the Turkic world” slogan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Azerbaijan aims to position itself not only as a Caucasian or Caspian state but also as a bridge to Central Asia. This strategic positioning sends a clear message, particularly to Western powers who seek deeper cooperation with Central Asia: Azerbaijan, together with Turkey, is the gateway for engagement with the region. Azerbaijan’s pivot towards Central Asia is underpinned by a calculated evaluation of the region as a less risky alternative compared to alignment with either the Russo-centric Eurasian structures or the Western power bloc. As a means of avoiding the potentially destabilising entanglements associated with alignment with more dominant powers, Central Asia has emerged as a geopolitical structure that offers relative stability and opportunity for Baku.&lt;/p&gt;

This report calls for an alliance that is more integrated across the economic and security realms to uphold the rules-based order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan and the United States today confront an international environment more fragmented and divided than at any time since the end of World War II. Hamas’s brutal attack on Israel in October 2023 has rekindled major conflict in the Middle East, including attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, with a risk of expansion as Iran and its proxies seek to capitalize on the violence. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shaken the international system and raised the specter of a world dividing into blocs. China has provided Russia with an economic lifeline, and North Korea has provided millions of rounds of ammunition that have sustained the war effort and helped Moscow to avoid defeat — and perhaps even to prevail, absent additional international assistance to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For its part, China is pursuing revisionist aims across the Indo-Pacific and beyond, adopting tools of coercion — military, political, and economic — to press territorial claims and advance its interests. Russia and China have largely ceased cooperation with the West, including at the United Nations and even in areas where they previously found common cause, such as efforts to restrain North Korean behavior. Kim Jong-un has capitalized on these divisions to advance his nuclear and missile programs and has forged a close relationship with Vladimir Putin. With Moscow and Beijing effectively in his corner, Kim has abandoned any pretext of engagement with the United States. He is on the brink of a full-spectrum nuclear capability, from tactical weapons for use on the battlefield to strategic weapons that can credibly threaten the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, both the United States and Japan are seeking to define the strategic competition with China in terms that avoid a new Cold War. On the one hand, both the United States and Japan have pursued policies to defend commercial and technological advantages in key sectors from China’s predatory and other unfair practices. In 2022, Japan passed new laws to promote “economic security” through enhanced screening for inbound investment, subsidies and protections for critical materials, and a new classified patent system for sensitive technologies. In the United States, Washington is pursuing a “small yard, high fence” approach to protecting critical technologies — limiting Beijing’s access to advanced technologies and promoting supply chain diversification — while otherwise allowing commerce with China to continue. But the size of the “yard” of critical technologies and the height of the “fence” around it remain subject to hot political debate. While managing this competition, Washington and Tokyo must preserve room to cooperate with China on issues of common interest and to sustain economic exchange key to the world’s prosperity. Building cooperation on climate change is of particular importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this uncertain environment, the U.S.-Japan alliance has never been more important — but doubts about the future of American leadership have never been more profound. Under the Biden administration, the United States has focused on strengthening alliances and partnerships, including by elevating the Quad, launching AUKUS, and promoting deeper “minilateral” cooperation among allies, particularly Japan, South Korea, and Australia. This strategy has achieved noteworthy successes, but it has failed to advance an economic agenda that meets the demand for credible and durable U.S. engagement, especially in the trade arena. And the future of U.S. engagement is uncertain, given a presidential campaign that features radically different visions of the United States’ role in the world and its relationships with allies. Regardless of which candidate wins, the concerns about American isolationism and reliability will continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burdens of global and regional leadership will therefore fall more heavily on Tokyo in the near term. Fortunately, Japan is well positioned to take on this role. Former prime minister Abe Shinzo was the architect of the ambitious diplomatic strategy known as the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP), and his successors have fully embraced his vision. Prime Minister Kishida Fumio announced a second phase of FOIP in March 2023, and it continues to enjoy broad political support in Japan. Japan has responded to a challenging security environment with unprecedented policy change, with plans to nearly double defense spending by 2027 and to acquire new capabilities that will contribute to deterrence in East Asia, including long-range precision strike missiles. Under Kishida’s leadership, Japan has played a major role in supporting Ukraine and was an effective leader of the G7 in 2023. Unlike many Western democracies, Japan has avoided the worst impulses of populism and isolationism. Its role in supporting a free and open international order grounded in the rule of law is therefore more important than ever. But looking ahead, the urgency of the international environment will demand more from Japan, and from the U.S.-Japan alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toward-an-integrated-alliance&quot;&gt;Toward an Integrated Alliance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the year 2000, the lead authors of this report brought together a bipartisan group to develop a vision for the U.S.-Japan alliance before the presidential election to serve as a roadmap for the relationship regardless of which party won. That report helped to shape George W. Bush’s approach to the alliance, and since then this group has built on this tradition of bipartisanship in the U.S.-Japan relationship through reports in 2007, 2012, 2018, and 2020. The broad political support for the alliance today in Washington and Tokyo did not fully exist before 2000 — and it has been crucial to the successful development of the relationship ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors behind earlier reports were not mere cheerleaders for the alliance — they were committed to honesty and candor about the challenges ahead and the need for action in Washington and Tokyo. The first report, issued in October 2000, called for “renewed attention to improving, reinvigorating, and refocusing the U.S.-Japan alliance.” In the most recent report, issued on the eve of President Biden’s inauguration, the authors called for an alliance that is more equal and expects more of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic environment that the United States and Japan face today, and the urgency of action needed to address it, demands an even stronger call to action. With Japan now embarked on an ambitious strategic trajectory, this report urges Washington and Tokyo to take the next step: to move toward an alliance that is more integrated, from planning and executing military operations to linking economic and security concerns, including by coordinating industrial policy and promoting secure supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In security terms, Washington must recognize that Japan’s new course is fundamentally different from the past, and that a more integrated alliance, including at the command level, can make a vital contribution to deterrence by enabling rapid decisionmaking and reducing seams between the two countries’ systems. On the economic side, Washington and Tokyo should collaborate on critical technologies and advance a robust friend-shoring agenda, working closely with other partners in Asia and Europe. Furthermore, the United States and Japan should work together to build the new bilateral and multilateral mechanisms needed to support a strategy of selective de-risking with China. Japan and the United States should sustain close cooperation globally to uphold a free and open international order grounded in the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;advancing-the-security-alliance&quot;&gt;Advancing the Security Alliance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan’s 2022 National Defense Strategy represents an opportunity to move toward a far more operational and credible alliance. Despite the significant strengthening of the security relationship over the last decade, much of the alliance architecture remains rooted in an era when the United States expected little of Japan as a strategic partner. In the past, the alliance could be effective without formal mechanisms of military coordination, but today it cannot. A more integrated alliance will require modernizing its command structure, deepening intelligence cooperation, and actively promoting defense industry and technology cooperation. To enable these transformative steps, Japan will need to adopt stronger cybersecurity practices and further enhance and expand its security clearance system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restructure alliance command and control.&lt;/strong&gt; Japan’s establishment of a new Joint Operational Command (J-JOC) by March 2025, to oversee joint operations of the Self Defense Forces (SDF), is an opportunity to modernize the alliance’s command structure. The United States should upgrade the leadership of U.S. forces in Japan by establishing a standing three- or four-star joint operational command, subordinate to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, with a more robust staff and the authority to plan and execute bilateral exercises and operations. This command could be a revamped U.S. Forces Japan or a new joint operational element established in Japan. Critically, however, the new headquarters should be primarily focused on the bilateral alliance and serve as a one-stop shop on all alliance matters for the Japanese government. The commander should not be dual hatted with U.S. service command responsibilities. With this new structure in place, Tokyo and Washington should establish a standing, combined bilateral planning and coordination office to support closer coordination of military operations while preserving separate chains of command. To the degree possible, the J-JOC and U.S. operational command in Japan should be co-located to ensure seamless coordination during contingencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen the intelligence relationship and cybersecurity.&lt;/strong&gt; The intelligence relationship remains a weak link in the U.S.-Japan alliance, with Japan’s intelligence community — despite reforms in recent years — still plagued by stovepiping and the absence of a true all-source analytic capability. Japan should establish a centralized analytic organization under the Cabinet Secretariat, staffed with personnel from across the intelligence community with access to all national security information produced by the Japanese government. In addition, Japan should place a high priority on passing legislation to create an economic security clearance system and strengthen Japan’s cyber defenses, including by enhancing public-private information sharing on cyber threats. These steps are prerequisites to deeper intelligence and defense cooperation in the alliance and must not be delayed. To support this effort, the United States should set out a clear road map of steps needed to elevate the intelligence-sharing relationship to the equivalent of the Five Eyes partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize defense industry and technology cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt; The war in Ukraine has underscored the importance of robust allied defense industrial capacity. Supporting an innovative Japanese defense industry is in the U.S. interest, and Japan’s loosening of restrictions on defense equipment exports — though still insufficient — is an opportunity to expand collaboration. Doing so will require adjustments to mindsets on both sides. For example, leadership in the U.S. Department of Defense should prioritize collaborative programs with Japan, from expanded licensed production of existing munitions lines to codevelopment of new technologies and systems. It should also streamline technology release policies to reflect the progress Japan has made on information security. In addition, the United States should support Japanese collaboration with other partners, including projects under Pillar Two of AUKUS. For its part, Japan should resist the instinct to pursue indigenous solutions to defense requirements, which place at risk timely delivery of the capabilities needed to sustain deterrence. To be competitive, and ultimately to provide the capabilities Japan and the United States need, Japanese industry needs to shed its nearly exclusive focus on building capabilities for the SDF and embrace the international marketplace, including partnerships with foreign defense companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expanding-partnerships-and-coalitions&quot;&gt;Expanding Partnerships and Coalitions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deeper integration of the U.S.-Japan relationship at the bilateral level should be combined with accelerated efforts to improve connectivity to other allies and like-minded partners — in particular, Australia, the Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan. When needed and interests align, the alliance should have global reach — and Japan should play a larger role in addressing the crisis in the Middle East, including by helping to protect commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The U.S.-Japan relationship is rooted in common values and a commitment to democracy; in a world in which democracy is under strain globally, Washington and Tokyo should work together to strengthen democratic resilience and the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridge the U.S.-ROK alliance.&lt;/strong&gt; With Japan rapidly moving to expand defense capabilities, including long-range counterstrike, the need for connective tissue between the U.S.-Japan and the U.S.-ROK alliances is greater than ever before. Following the Camp David meetings in August 2023, structures of trilateral dialogue at the strategic level are in place. The allies should now move to establish formal connections at the operational level, including through exchanges of liaison officers at respective commands, the inclusion of observers at bilateral exercises, and the establishment of a trilateral contingency planning cell. To support these changes, Japan and South Korea should move purposefully and promptly to normalize bilateral defense relations through a first-ever joint security declaration. Such a declaration could be modeled on the 2007 Japan-Australia Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation, which set out broad areas of common interest and cooperation in a non-binding political statement. These government actions should be accompanied by efforts to deepen ties among individuals and civil society in Japan and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operationalize U.S.-Japan-Australia security cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt; Japan and Australia have advanced their defense cooperation with a Reciprocal Access Agreement and enhanced Japanese military exercises in northern Australia. Australia’s focus on guided weapons and stand-off strike parallels Japan’s objectives and offers opportunities for federated defense production and forward sustainment. Australia’s geography offers critical defense in depth and a connection to the Indian Ocean. As the United States modernizes its command and control in Japan and defense industrial policies, emphasis should be placed on operationalizing the trilateral security cooperation already underway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance cooperation with the Philippines.&lt;/strong&gt; The Marcos government’s decisions to stand up to Chinese coercion in the South China Sea and rebuild the U.S. alliance represent a significant strategic opportunity for Washington and Tokyo, who should do everything possible to reinforce and support Manila’s actions. Including Manila in minilateral engagement should continue to be a high priority, and the United States and Japan should coordinate closely in providing security assistance, to avoid duplication and ensure interoperability. Tokyo should prioritize concluding a Reciprocal Access Agreement with Manila.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Taiwan’s resilience and quietly deepen trilateral dialogue with Taipei.&lt;/strong&gt; Taiwan’s free and fair elections in January 2024 were an inspiration for the world, and the incoming Lai government deserves support from Washington, Tokyo, and other democracies. Within the parameters of the United States’ and Japan’s long-standing “One China” policies, both countries should support Taiwan’s capacity to resist military and economic coercion. In particular, Tokyo should expand low-profile ties with Taiwan’s national security establishment, including through regularized participation in some of Washington’s regular security policy dialogues with Taipei. The absence of these links today is a critical weakness in preparing for the possibility of a Taiwan Strait contingency. In addition, Washington and Tokyo should explore ways to help Taiwan harden critical infrastructure, to include communications networks, energy supplies, and transportation links.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen cooperation in the Middle East.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite Japan’s heavy dependence on sea lanes from the Middle East, Tokyo has been notably absent from the international response to terrorist attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Leveraging the SDF facility in Djibouti, Japan should play a larger and more visible role in defending the commercial sea lanes. Japan depends more heavily on sea lanes from the Middle East than does the United States, and its stance in the region should reflect that reality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote democratic norms and the rule of law.&lt;/strong&gt; Japan’s National Security Strategy emphasizes the importance of democratic norms and the rule of law to Japan’s national interests. Weak governance and poor transparency and accountability have allowed China to engage in elite capture, build dual-use infrastructure for the military, and turn cash-poor media against the United States and its allies in strategically important parts of the Indo-Pacific. These same conditions limit opportunities for investment by U.S. and Japanese firms that would reinforce anti-corruption measures and the rule of law. The most important work is countering corruption, foreign interference, and disinformation in countries that are strategically important. The United States and Japan should work closely through the Quad and G7 and with South Korea to develop a strategy and coordination mechanism to reinforce democratic resilience, combat disinformation, and strengthen the rule of law in the Indo-Pacific to counter Beijing’s strategies of co-option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthening-economic-and-technology-cooperation&quot;&gt;Strengthening Economic and Technology Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While economic cooperation is enshrined in Article II of the U.S.-Japan bilateral security treaty, it has historically been difficult to implement, largely due to trade friction. However, both countries have come a long way in transforming their economic relationship from one of adversity to one of genuine cooperation. Indeed, issues at the nexus of economic and national security — such as protecting critical technologies, strengthening supply chain resilience, and promoting friend-shoring in key strategic sectors — have become among the most important on the policy agenda today and should be a central focus for the United States and Japan in the years ahead, particularly as both countries continue to work to advance their preferred economic rules, values, and norms in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drive the G7 process on economic security.&lt;/strong&gt; Japan deserves strong credit for its leadership at the 2023 G7 meeting in Hiroshima, and in particular its success in shepherding the “G7 Leaders’ Statement on Economic Resilience and Economic Security.” Implementation of this vision is essential and will require continued leadership by the United States and Japan to press the other G7 members to take concrete measures to enhance supply chain resilience, counter economic coercion, and build resilient critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooperate in combating China’s excess capacity and dumping.&lt;/strong&gt; Excess capacity prompted by massive subsidies and other types of financial assistance, as well as insufficient domestic demand in China, is precipitating a flood of Chinese exports to the rest of the world and putting industries in the United States, Japan, and Europe at risk. Working with like-minded partners, including in the G7, the United States and Japan should coordinate approaches and, where possible, develop collective policy responses. These could include relying on traditional trade tools, such as anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures, but should also involve employing new and creative approaches to address this growing concern. As a first step, the United States, Japan, Europe, and South Korea should initiate a dialogue on coordinated responses to excess capacity in the critical sector of electric vehicles, where the Chinese industry has rapidly become a global leader.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore new models for free trade arrangements.&lt;/strong&gt; The consensus in the United States in support of an affirmative and market-opening trade policy has frayed in both parties, with few signs of it being rebuilt any time soon. Although the authors of this report strongly support the return of the United States to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), such a step is unlikely for the foreseeable future. As an interim measure, the United States and Japan should explore the possibility of developing a new and forward-looking template for free trade agreements that includes some traditional elements but goes further to address emerging issues, such as supply chain resilience, economic coercion, climate and trade, and advanced technology standards. The two governments could also consider pursuing and building on existing agreements in specific sectors, such as electric vehicles, batteries, semiconductors, and critical minerals. Such agreements, aimed to promote secure supply chains, could be deepened to include market access, harmonized or mutually recognized standards, and trade facilitation provisions to make them genuine supply chain agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop common and updated rules governing two-way investment.&lt;/strong&gt; A new free trade agreement template could provide more certainty on related investment matters, given the anticipated continued increase in investment flows between both countries. The positions of both presidential candidates on the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel do not reflect a careful assessment of the U.S. national interest. The proposed deal would likely support U.S. economic growth, jobs, and innovation without in any way jeopardizing national security. Although it would not have exempted this transaction from review, Japan should be granted “excepted foreign state” (“whitelist”) status from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow new exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Japan.&lt;/strong&gt; In light of the importance of LNG imports to Japan as a transitional source of energy, even as it continues to invest heavily in renewables and rebuild its nuclear energy capacity, the U.S. government should consider exempting Japan from the temporary pause on new LNG export approvals announced by President Biden in January 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deepen cooperation on development globally.&lt;/strong&gt; Opportunities to deepen U.S.-Japan development cooperation in the coming years should build on the strong foundation already established between the partners and assess strategic opportunities to leverage Japan’s private sector to advance key development cooperation priorities. Japan and the United States could further align efforts to advance global health security and outcomes; advance their partnership on energy cooperation and youth leadership in sub-Saharan Africa; invest in sustainable economic development and livelihood opportunities in Latin America; and expand access to mobile telecommunication technology in the Indo-Pacific that is open, safe, secure, and accessible to all. The two countries should also enhance their work through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) to mobilize public and private capital to invest in sustainable infrastructure. These efforts are vital to providing countries in the developing world with high-quality alternatives to China’s Belt and Road Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support the expansion of the G7 to include Australia and South Korea.&lt;/strong&gt; Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the G7 has emerged as the primary international forum for upholding the international rules-based order, from support to Ukraine to combating Chinese economic coercion. But as an increasingly important global governance institution, and perhaps the only effective one, its membership needs expansion to include other like-minded partners with the values and resources to buttress the rules-based international order. The United States and Japan should consider G7 expansion to include Australia and South Korea, the world’s next two largest advanced democracies and partners that are increasingly critical to global political and economic responses. This is not charity. Given the challenges facing today’s international environment, it is time to bring additional voices with meaningful capacity and aligned views to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen coordination of economic security policy through a new Economic Security Dialogue led by the U.S. National Security Council and Japan’s National Security Secretariat.&lt;/strong&gt; The Economic 2+2, launched in 2022, has proven to be a useful forum for coordinating geoeconomic strategy, but alone it is insufficient to drive aligned decisionmaking in both countries. Given the political sensitivity and coordination challenges on economic security issues and industrial policy, Washington and Tokyo should establish a new dialogue mechanism, led by the White House and the Cabinet Secretariat, to facilitate coordination of industrial policy, technology promotion, export controls, and other economic security policies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report closes with an admonition. As strong as the U.S.-Japan alliance is today, the authors share a concern about its future. The dramatic decline in recent years in Japanese students studying in the United States, and U.S. students studying in Japan, risks eroding the foundation of U.S.-Japan relations over the long term. Both governments should focus on rebuilding these ties, which represent the lifeblood of the relationship across government, industry, and civil society. Programs in both countries should focus on student exchanges and promoting the role of women in the relationship. The U.S.-Japan Conference on Cultural and Educational Interchange (CULCON) continues to be a vital forum in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Japan relationship is at a moment of historic strength, even as both countries confront daunting challenges in the international system. The partnership today was almost unimaginable at the time of the authors’ first report in the year 2000. This evolution was not inevitable. It has been built by people from all walks of life in both countries who are deeply committed to the relationship. The authors of this report have had the good fortune to be part of this effort over many years — and in some cases decades. It is the enduring task of both countries to cultivate new generations of leaders who recognize the value of the two countries’ partnership and who share a commitment to sustaining it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it remarkable that an organisation that is 75 years old is still absolutely at the heart of European and transatlantic security issues? Other parts of the post-Cold War’s international security architecture are all looking their age and finding it increasingly challenging. Think of the UN Security Council: inevitably, when the major powers are at loggerheads, the Security Council cannot act on issues such as Ukraine, or indeed on anything to do with the growing menace from China. That blockage was foreseen by those who negotiated the UN Charter; the British were very prominent on that point with the Americans. And even when the delegations were signing the UN Charter in San Francisco in the summer of 1945, the British Foreign Office negotiators, including my own personal hero, the permanent secretary at the time, my lineal predecessor, Alec Cadogan, knew that the Security Council was flawed because at any time when the great powers were against each other, it could not work. And so even then, in 1945, the Foreign Office started planning for a Western security organisation for the post-war period. It did not share the optimism that Winston Churchill had in those days that the tactical alliance of the “Big Three” during the war would continue into the post-war period. And that scepticism was shared when we had a new foreign secretary. The Labour government came in at the time of Potsdam in the summer of 1945. Ernest Bevin had absolutely no illusions about Joseph Stalin, and he turned immediately to his Foreign Office officials who had in their files the first plans for organising European security. We had the Dunkirk Treaty with France in 1947. We had the Western European Union, the Brussels Treaty, in 1948. And then, even as the Brussels Treaty was being signed, Bevin was sending papers to George Marshall, the US secretary of state, with his ideas for an Atlantic Pact. And it was really Bevin and Marshall and people such as Senator Arthur Vandenberg in the US who were the godfathers of the NATO Treaty signed 75 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can one explain NATO’s longevity? Why is it still an effective organisation 75 years on? The answer lies – partly – by looking at the treaty. The NATO Washington Treaty is terse. It sticks to principles and objectives. It is 14 articles long. Compare that with the Treaty of Rome at 248 articles, four annexes, countless protocols. They are very, very different things because, of course, the EU is a supranational, law-based organisation, with all the complexity that has. And the NATO treaty, to my mind, found an elusive point of balance between being a very solemn political commitment between the allies, but leaving each ally maximum discretion as to how it carries out that commitment. I am sure everybody taking part in the celebrations can recite Article 5 by heart: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all”. And that, consequently, they agree that they “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area”. So, there is no binding obligation to do anything. The US Senate would never have accepted that for the Americans. But it has given NATO a strength in its flexibility. NATO’s strength is not in its treaty text, but in its shared political objectives and trust between allies. And that is why it has had a capacity to flex and adapt as security priorities have changed. In the Cold War it was the essential vehicle for deterrence and territorial defence against the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am old enough that I first joined the UK Delegation to NATO in 1978. It was at the height of the Cold War. We used to practise nuclear release procedures every winter in a Wintex exercise. So, the nuclear deterrence of NATO was a real thing and was exercised and practised regularly. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO turned to so-called out-of-area operations: expeditionary interventions. These have a rather a bad name now, but it is worth bearing in mind that the interventions in Bosnia, in 1995, and in Kosovo, in 1999, did succeed in their objective of damping down ethnic cleansing, which was the terrible crisis at that point. And although not every country in the region has taken the opportunity, they were given the chance to build more stable, peaceful societies. I might note that in this year of anniversaries, it is the NATO-led KFOR’s (Kosovo Force) 25th anniversary. KFOR is still at work in Kosovo, helping peace and stability there. Of course, interventions then got more difficult. During the early period of ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) in Afghanistan, it did succeed in working in and around Kabul to help the Hamid Karzai government put down roots. Things went wrong after that. But it is not true to say that the expeditionary interventions of NATO all proved to be disastrous. NATO was not directly involved in the Iraq intervention in 2003. That was a very difficult period in the Alliance. At that time, I was back as permanent representative for the UK and there were deep divisions between allies, genuinely held differences of conviction, which made life quite interesting around the North Atlantic Council table for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But within a year after that, NATO was back together again, and the NATO Training Mission in Iraq was established at the Istanbul Conference summit in 2004 and helped to bring allies together again after that very bruising period. One more piece of reminiscence: by 2011, I was national security adviser. The Libya air campaign was another test for NATO’s capacity to flex, adapt and innovate. Because, as you remember, President Barack Obama decided that the US would not be directly involved. So, senior US officers in the command structure were pulled back. European officers and Canadian officers took their place and NATO managed a complex air campaign, in that rather new guise. Again, things did not turn out too well. We did not have boots on the ground. We were not able to control the situation, but the NATO machine, in my mind, worked well and showed once again it could adapt to new circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NATO’s strength is not in its treaty text, but in its shared political objectives and trust between allies. And that is why it has had a capacity to flex and adapt as security priorities have changed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are back to NATO at its original purpose. Thank you, President Putin, for that! We are facing the most serious threat to European security since 1945. And I think NATO has risen very well to the challenge. I can say that as an outsider. But watching NATO function was very impressive. The US reinforced Europe using those plans that had been in SHAPE’s filing cabinets for decades. Other allies pushed their forces under the enhanced forward presence operation into the territories of the NATO allies, eight battle groups at the moment, with the UK playing a major role. NATO deterrence has worked: President Vladimir Putin has not put one Russian boot across a NATO border. And in many ways, the aggression against Ukraine has already been a strategic disaster for Putin. The Russians have achieved none of their objectives, despite taking enormous numbers of casualties. The Russian armed forces have been shown up to be poorly equipped, badly led with low morale. And when confronted with Western weapons, the Russians have not done well. Their economy will be weakened by sanctions in the medium term; at the moment, it is surfing on the oil price. But in terms of technology and investment, Russia will increasingly lag behind. We now proudly have Finland and Sweden as staunch members of the Alliance, enormously strengthening the northern flank. I remember in my time as NATO permanent representative that Finland and Sweden were proud neutrals, extremely active in the partnership council, in many ways more active than many allies. But I could never have imagined them being members. Thank you again, President Putin, for that. It is a change that will long outlast Putin and what he has been trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, NATO feels more united, more purposeful, and, of course, larger, than it has been certainly since the end of the Cold War. I would also say that the EU has responded effectively as well. The fact that Western Europe has weaned itself off dependence on Russian oil and gas is a major strategic advantage for us. It has broken a piece of leverage that Putin held in his hands. We have seen the EU break through some very long-held taboos about the use of the EU budget to fund arms deliveries to Ukraine. Again, this is not something I would have expected from decades of watching the very slow process of European political cooperation. And the decision to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and many other countries – Georgia, Moldova, and countries in the Western Balkans – is a very significant downpayment on future European stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, such an enlargement will take many years to achieve, but it is a big step in the right direction. Personally, I would like to see NATO sending even stronger signals in the same direction at the Washington summit. NATO–EU cooperation was for decades not easy; there were all kinds of complexities. I am sure they are still there, in the institutional sense, but things are improving, certainly. In the Vilnius summit conclusions, I read some very positive words about NATO–EU cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chair a House of Lords European Affairs Committee, and we recently published a report on the impact of Ukraine on UK and EU relations. We expressed our hope that the undertaking in Vilnius for the non-EU allies – that of the fullest involvement in EU defence – is something that the British government will take active steps to lead on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I give high marks to Western countries for the response to Ukraine so far. But there are major problems ahead. Everybody is very well aware of the central issue, which seems to me to be that of finding the political will as well as the resources to sustain Ukraine into the next phase of this grinding long war that it is facing. And the stakes are very high. The Ukrainian armed forces have shown extraordinary courage and resilience, as has the whole population, but they are more and more dependent on continuing Western military and economic support. It is clear beyond doubt that Ukraine needs right now a lot more artillery shells, anti-missile interceptors and other weapons. So far, looking at the figures, the US has supplied the lion’s share of military resources for Ukraine. The figures that I have indicate that, in the first two years of the war, US military support amounted to around $43 billion, against about $38 billion for European countries collectively, including the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The threat landscape in Europe has changed durably, and whoever is in the Oval Office next year, Europeans need to be showing that they are on a path to take on more of the burden of security in Europe than has been true in the past&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, we are all watching very carefully the fate of this $60-billion package, which is now stuck in the US House of Representatives. If it continues to be delayed, and given how depleted our own stockpiles are in most growing non-US NATO countries, it seems to me the only solution in the short term is to do the sort of thing that the Czech government has been very forward in pursuing: buying in materials from South Korea and other places. But that, in itself, is a wake-up call to all countries in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The honest truth is that for far too long, far too many European countries have been spending far too little on defence. Of course, that has been changing and it has been changing since 2014. Thank you again, President Putin. Perhaps we should also give credit to the pressure Donald Trump exerted when he was president, but it is mainly due to President Putin. RUSI’s Malcolm Chalmers has a very recent paper about the trends in this area, and he identified a 60% increase in European defence spending in real terms since 2014. If that is right, then that is a very impressive figure. And it looks like we should get to 18, perhaps 20, members of NATO meeting the 2% of GDP defence spending target this year. This is definitely better late than never. The new cash, of course, now needs to be turned into real capability. And that is not going to happen immediately. It means removing, as far as possible, the obstacles in the way of European defence-industrial cooperation. The House of Lords report has some points about that, in particular in relation to the pretty restrictive arrangements for the European Defence Fund, which do not make it easy for the UK to partner with other European defence industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another element to consider about rising defence spending in Europe is it has to be sustained, if it is going to be of any use. The threat landscape in Europe has changed durably, and whoever is in the Oval Office next year, Europeans need to be showing that they are on a path to take on more of the burden of security in Europe than has been true in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure NATO also needs to review its own collective defence in the light of what we have learned from watching the first drone-age war in Europe. Ukrainian armed forces, I am sure, will have a great deal to tell us which will be important for NATO’s collective defence planning. There are all sorts of other issues on NATO’s agenda. I am very conscious that China is a rising concern in many of our countries. Consultations on China are vital between allies. This is also the case between NATO allies and the Asian allies, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan. And I personally wonder whether some sort of NATO+ format could be the right forum for wider consultations on the threats from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, the breadth of the agenda is proof of the vitality of this sprightly 75-year-old that is NATO. But if it is going to survive for another generation, it has to ensure that Putin does not win in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

The first in a series of three, this report discusses the processing and refining stage of the lithium-ion supply chain.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;It evaluates domestic efforts to ramp up extraction and processing capabilities as well as “friendshore” portions of the supply chain to economic partners and allies in light of China’s dominance. The report closes with a set of recommendations to better leverage economic and trade tools to enhance access and processing of critical minerals and materials, with a focus on expanding critical mineral agreements with allied nations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-ion batteries are among the most critical industrial items necessary to achieve the transition to lower carbon emissions worldwide. Essential to electric vehicles (EVs) and the effective delivery of solar and wind power throughout the electric grid, these batteries also charge a majority of consumer electronics products. While the supply chain for batteries is dispersed throughout the globe, the mining and processing of key minerals and materials is concentrated in just a few countries, with China dominating. As changing trade relationships, sanctions, and other geopolitical disruptions ripple through the global economy, the dispersion of supply chains and concentration of key inputs constitutes a significant vulnerability for maintaining and growing production in this key manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sourcing and processing challenges in the lithium-ion battery sector are formidable. As U.S industries strive to grow in this sector, they face complexities surrounding battery supply chains that have been generated by overlapping — and at times incompatible — government policies that aim to: (1) protect national security, (2) facilitate the green transition, and (3) improve U.S. economic competitiveness while re-shoring domestic industrial capabilities. Policies designed to address these serious and varied global challenges have at once offered generous market stimulating incentives while introducing non-market economic headwinds that may eventually threaten the survival of U.S. supply chains for lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has embraced the vision of achieving an economy that emits less carbon by providing demand-inducing subsidies for EVs and lithium-ion batteries, which are the heart of these cars. Adding difficulty to achieving climate goals is the dominant role played by China in this sector, coupled with a bipartisan consensus in the United States on the need to reduce economic dependence on China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As changing trade relationships, sanctions, and other geopolitical disruptions ripple through the global economy, the dispersion of supply chains and concentration of key inputs constitutes a significant vulnerability for maintaining and growing production in this key manufacturing sector.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business community, for its part, is engaged in extensive risk reassessment with respect to doing business in and with China to ensure greater resiliency in their supply chains. Depending on the current level of investment, the business model, and the structure of individual supply chains, risk reassessment can lead U.S. companies to take the decision to sever ties with China. More often, companies are identifying possible chokepoints for inputs and embarking on a quest for redundant sources of supply to backstop against future export restrictions and trade sanctions should economic relations with China further deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A profound shift in trade, economic, climate, and national security policy is underway. The Biden administration has followed the European Union in articulating its goal as “de-risking” rather than decoupling from China, but as a practical matter, policies still under development have so far been disjointed and difficult for industry to follow. These policies, combined with tough rhetoric by various government officials and members of Congress who propose even more draconian measures to require local sourcing, have injected uncertainty into the commercial decisionmaking governing U.S. manufacturing capabilities. In the end, government measures to restrict commerce with China, in advance of alternative sources of supply of key inputs coming online, threaten to derail this range of overlapping policy objectives. In short, the United States is pursuing three conflicting goals: accelerating the green transition, reshoring production capabilities in critical sectors, and diversifying away from China in these key areas. Efforts to achieve the last two goals compromise the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration and Congress have undertaken a full suite of industrial policy measures that are set to skyrocket demand for lithium-ion batteries, especially when it comes to EVs. The Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act (IIJA) set up funding meant to create a “Made-in-America” EV network of 500,000 chargers. The law invests $7.5 billion in EV charging. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)’s tax incentives, which provide billions in tax benefits for manufacturers and consumers of EV batteries, is making lithium-ion technology more in demand than ever. Certain tax credit qualifications in the IRA include domestic content requirements for batteries and battery materials, including those used to support clean energy project deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first of three papers examining the lithium-ion battery supply chain and prospects for bringing more production on shore. This paper outlines the basic makeup of a lithium-ion battery and some of the complexities surrounding the purifying processes for several different scarce critical mineral inputs. In addition, it describes the role that the United States plays in the global sourcing of key minerals now and in the future by examining several trends expected to impact the market going forward. Lastly, this paper lays out what actions the Biden administration and Congress have undertaken to date to improve the security of critical mineral supply chains and proposes some recommendations to build upon that foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the processing of battery materials is concentrated in a few nations outside of the United States, representing a daunting challenge for building resiliency in an environment of heightened geopolitical tension. According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, “The clean energy transition will necessitate an overall 400–600 percent increase in global demand for key critical minerals like lithium, graphite, cobalt and nickel and for some minerals the increase will be many times higher.” U.S. reliance on Chinese extraction, refining, and processing of critical minerals creates a serious vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several stages of the lithium-ion battery supply chain need to be considered to understand how the United States can reach its goal of diversifying its supply of battery inputs while keeping the green transition moving. To reduce critical dependencies and build stronger global supply chains in this sector, the administration should consider balancing domestic production incentives with modernized trade relationships to best ensure that U.S. firms maintain an adequate supply of these key inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-makeup-of-a-lithium-ion-battery&quot;&gt;The Makeup of a Lithium-Ion Battery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic makeup of a lithium-ion battery consists of three main components: multiple lithium-ion cells, the wires connecting these cells, and a battery management system (BMS) to monitor the functioning and temperature of the battery. In turn, each lithium-ion cell is individually made up of four main components: the cathode, the anode, an electrolyte, and a separator. The anode and cathode components store the lithium. What creates electricity from a lithium-ion battery is the movement of the lithium between the anode to the cathode components, carried by the electrolyte via the separator, creating free electrons and thus a charge that flows through the device being powered. Each of these components are made of several constituent materials and chemicals that are critical to enhancing the performance of the lithium-ion battery, which will be discussed in more detail in subsequent papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cathode&quot;&gt;Cathode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Batteries are composed of positive and negative electrodes to enable the creation of electrons to create electrical current. In a battery, the cathode is the positive electrode. Cathode active materials (CAMs), which define the output and application of the batteries, are generally composed of metal oxides. The most common metal oxides that make up CAMs are lithium cobalt oxide, lithium manganese oxide, lithium iron phosphate, and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide. Different cathode materials contain varying amounts of lithium: the higher the lithium content, the larger the battery capacity, as lithium storage has a direct impact on the battery’s ability to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;anode&quot;&gt;Anode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the cathode is the positive electrode enabling the flow of electrons, the anode is the negative electrode. Much like cathodes, anodes require active materials to function. Anode active materials (AAMs) are generally made from carbon-based materials such as graphite, silicon, or a combination of both. Graphite is the most commonly used because of its high electrical conductivity, lower cost, and stable structure, while silicon possesses higher energy density (the amount of energy stored in a given substance per unit volume) but presents challenges due to higher volume expansion and shorter life cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electrolyte&quot;&gt;Electrolyte&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A battery electrolyte is a solution inside batteries, the consistency and makeup of which varies based on the type of battery. However, electrolytes ultimately are used for the same purpose: they transport positively charged ions between the cathode and the anode — enabling the free flow of electrons and creating an electrical charge. The chemical in question allows the electrical charge to pass between the cathode and anode terminals and puts the chemicals required for a reaction in contact with the terminals, which converts stored energy into useful electrical energy. The most commonly used electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries is a lithium salt solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;Separator&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separators are placed in lithium-ion batteries between the anode and cathode to avoid a short circuit and facilitate a lithium-ion cell’s stability and safety. Because separators are not part of the reactions that produce the flow of electricity mentioned above, they have to be chemically stable relative to the electrolyte and electrode materials. Materials in a separator include nonwoven fabrics consisting of “a manufactured sheet, web, or mat of directionally or randomly oriented fibers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concentration-and-purification-of-the-materials&quot;&gt;Concentration and Purification of the Materials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several critical minerals and raw materials are key to the lithium-ion battery supply chain. This paper highlights minerals that are currently used in batteries, but there may be new battery chemistries and types that could change what critical minerals and raw materials are required for renewable power generation. As stated by the Congressional Research Service, processes of obtaining permits, acquiring land and capital, and other necessary steps can vary considerably and may take years. The Government Accountability Office assessed that the amount of time needed simply to reach the approval stage “ranged from about 1 month to over 11 years and averaged approximately 2 years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals key to lithium-ion battery manufacturing require rigorous, lengthy technical processes to avoid negative spillover effects on the environment and workers’ health. For instance, cobalt mining has come under scrutiny due to the issue of child labor as well as poor safety standards: a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development notes that a mine owned by the Kamoto Copper Company in the Democratic Republic of Congo collapsed, killing an estimated 36 workers. Setting up and operating these processes is therefore a difficult task, made all the more challenging by two features. First, demand for these minerals and materials is set to increase significantly. A report by the International Energy Agency found that, in order to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement, demand for nickel, cobalt, and graphite is expected to grow by about 20 times, while lithium demand is expected to grow to 40 times its current level. Second, the movement to diversify away from China, which extracts a large amount of these minerals and materials and processes an even larger share, will require the significant retooling of current processing activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cathode-1&quot;&gt;Cathode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LITHIUM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithium is generally extracted from brines and mines. For the former, lithium-rich brine comes to the Earth’s surface and forms shallow ponds in which sunlight and wind evaporate the water and slowly concentrate the solution. It then undergoes thorough chemical treatments, such as precipitation and ion exchange, to reduce impurities and improve lithium-ion concentration. That concentrated solution is then turned into lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide through precipitation and purification processes which convert it to battery-grade material. Lithium carbonate is a more commonly made compound used in lithium-ion battery production, while lithium hydroxide is becoming increasingly popular because of enhanced performance in cathode chemistries with high nickel content. Lithium extraction from brines is particularly significant because of the relative abundance of lithium in brine deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to mines, the process is centered around sourcing minerals that carry lithium. The ore-containing lithium is first extracted and undergoes separation steps to get rid of any contaminants. The resulting lithium-rich concentrate is then used to extract lithium ions through a leaching process which mingles the concentrate with chemicals that are made for the purpose of leaching. There are other alternative sources of lithium aside from brines and mines; conventional mining operations can also source lithium from solid rock ore deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to ongoing exploration, identified resources of lithium around the globe have increased significantly. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, identified lithium resources in the United States total 12 million tons and total 86 million tons in other countries. South America is particularly relevant when it comes to sourcing the mineral. Bolivia leads the world with 21 million tons, followed by Argentina’s 20 million tons and Chile’s 11 million tons. Other countries with sizable lithium reserves include Australia (8 million tons) and China (about 7 million tons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COBALT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cobalt deposits are found throughout different mineral formations, including igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks. Cobalt is generally retrieved as a byproduct from copper and nickel production, and its pricing therefore follows the demand of these primary metals. Cobalt has several applications, such as EV batteries, superalloys, cutting tools, and industrial catalysts, to name a few. Cobalt can be produced from three main types of ore deposits: copper deposits, for example, located in the central African copper belt comprising the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia; magmatic nickel sulfide deposits, for example, found at Sudbury, Canada, and at Norilsk, Russia; and, lastly, nickel laterite deposits, located in tropical regions. Cobalt can also be found on the deep-sea floor, although such deposits are generally not being extracted. A majority of the world’s cobalt mine production — about 70 percent — is located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, followed by Russia (about 4 percent) and Australia (4 percent). According to the U.S. Geological Survey, around 70 percent of domestic production is from recycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because cobalt is often a byproduct of copper and nickel production, and since the ores of these two metals are intertwined in sedimentary deposits, it is not possible to mine cobalt without mining these other metals. Therefore, the extraction process is essentially the same as mining and refining copper or nickel. Several processing methods can be used for cobalt. In short, crushed sulfite from mines is heaped up to extract a mineral soup leached from the rock by sulfuric acid. Copper, for instance, is extracted from the solution by electrolysis, which leaves behind a solution fairly rich in cobalt (along with other metals). Another set of chemical precipitation and second leaching removes these metals from the electrolyte, which slowly enriches the cobalt in the solution until it can be extracted out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the purification of cobalt involves several steps to extract and separate the mineral from the ore. During the first step, the ore is crushed into small pieces and ground into a powder. That ground ore is mixed with water and chemicals and agitated in flotation cells, creating bubbles that attach to the valuable minerals and form a froth layer while the non-valuable minerals sink to the bottom. The froth containing the valuable minerals goes through a series of concentration steps, including more processing to remove impurities. That concentrated ore is then smelted — which involves heating the ore at very high temperatures to separate the individual metals. The separated component concentrates, copper and cobalt, are further processed to remove additional impurities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MANGANESE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manganese is a relatively abundant metal and is widely available throughout the Earth’s crust, including on the seafloor. Ores that contain over 35 percent manganese are considered commercially viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impurities in manganese include oxides of other metals, and these are reduced during smelting. Nonmetallic impurities remain in the post-smelting slag. Smelting processes depend on the kind of manganese destined for final application: pure manganese, ferromanganese, or silicomanganese. For uses requiring pure manganese, the process of producing electrolytic manganese is preferred. In this method, manganese ores are roasted to obtain a calcine that is dissolved in sulfuric acid to make a manganous sulfate solution. The addition of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide then precipitates unwanted materials. Ferromanganese and silicomanganese are made through smelting ores in a furnace. South Africa leads the way in terms of manganese reserves at 640 million metric tons, followed by China (280 million metric tons), and Australia (270 million metric tons). Other large players include Ukraine (140 million metric tons) and Gabon (61 million metric tons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICKEL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nickel, primarily used in stainless steel, is also used in alloys as well as chemicals and batteries due to its resistance to corrosion. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, nickel can be found primarily in two types of ore deposits: laterites and magmatic sulfides. Nickel deposits can generally be found in rocks rich in iron and magnesium. The extraction of nickel from ore is similar to the extraction of copper, and often the same equipment is used in both processes. Nickel, however, does require higher-temperature refractories and therefore enhanced cooling capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purification processes depend on whether the ore-containing nickel is a sulfide or a laterite. For sulfides, the ores are ground to separate waste materials from the nickel mineral by selective flotation processes (in which the ore is mixed with reagents and agitated by devices to create air bubbles; the sulfide clings to surfaces and then is collected as a concentrate). The resulting concentrate is then either leached or dried and smelted. That product is converted to an oxide and combines with a silica flux to form a slag drawn off to leave a matte with a high nickel content. The matte is then further treated using a variety of processes such as ammonia pressure leach, roasting, or electrorefining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For laterite ores, because they are oxides and are not suitable for conventional concentration processes, large amounts must be smelted together. The moisture and water are chemically removed in furnaces. The oxide is then reduced to nickel metal using furnaces and then cooled. A large portion of laterite smelters make a crude ferronickel meant to be an alloying agent in steel production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2021, Indonesia and Australia had the largest global reserves of nickel with around 21 million metric tons each, followed by Brazil (16 million metric tons) and Russia (about 8 million metric tons). The United States itself possesses around 340,000 metric tons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LITHIUM IRON PHOSPHATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic production of lithium iron phosphate chiefly includes four elements: the production of iron phosphate precursor, wet ball milling, spray drying, and sintering. The synthesis of phosphate can come in two forms, solid or liquid. The solid-phase synthesis method is the most commonly used to prepare electrode materials because it is a relatively simple process that can be more quickly industrialized. Carbothermal reduction, which reduces substances using carbon as an agent, is likely the most common solid-phase method, as it involves using inexpensive ferric iron. Liquid-phase synthesis, on the other hand, adds a solvent such as water to obtain the calcination of lithium iron phosphate at high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia has the largest reserves of iron content ore, with 27 billion metric tons, followed by Brazil’s 15 billion metric tons and Russia’s 14 billion metric tons. China possesses close to 7 billion metric tons, whereas the United States has around 1 billion metric tons of reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;anode-1&quot;&gt;Anode&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRAPHITE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite is a pure form of carbon that comes in three main commercial forms: spherical graphite, coated spherical graphite, and synthetic graphite. The first is not involved in EV-battery applications as it is not processed enough to be suitable to be used in a vehicle. Graphite is a particularly attractive material for lithium-ion battery manufacturers, as it is widely available in a broad range of countries, such as Turkey, Brazil, China, Russia, and Sweden. In addition, the size and shape of graphite particles can be modified depending on the required application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main sources of graphite: natural graphite extracted directly from minerals, synthetic graphite, and bio-graphite. While natural graphite is an important source of graphite materials today, it can contain a large number of impurities, making its use difficult. Synthetic graphite is made out of calcined petroleum coke and coal tar pitch, and bio-graphite is obtained by pyrolysis of carbon-containing components. The carbon content of natural graphite is, in general, fairly low when mined, requiring several enrichment processes. The first stage is the crushing process, in which the crushing methods (for instance, ball, hammer, air-jet, or rod mills) are determined by the type of graphite ore. The second stage is grinding and screening to graphite flakes, and the last stage is purification through a number of methods, such as flotation and high-temperature purification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synthetic graphite, also known as artificial graphite, is produced through heating formless carbon materials. These chiefly include calcined petroleum coke and coal tar pitch. To produce synthetic graphite, the petroleum is first ground and sieved, and the coal tar pitch is used as a binder to form a paste. The actual shape of the graphite is formed and then heated to carbonize the pitch. A pitch is used to fill pores caused by that carbonization process, and the product is once again calcined to be carbonized and densified. Lastly, the temperature is raised to between 2700 and 3000 °C, where its shape transforms into graphitic crystallites that eventually become a stable graphitic structure. Synthetic graphite has no cost advantage to natural graphite, though it does present higher carbon content, better cyclability, and a more stable performance — as well as enhanced compatibility with electrolytes. There are several experimental ways to achieve the third type, bio-graphite, which refers to graphite produced from biomass. These methods have included, for instance, high-temperature heating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the different source and production methods of graphite mentioned above, the types of impurities they present also vary. A number of purification methods have been applied to natural graphite. Flotation, for instance, is the simplest type but obtains a lower amount of graphite purity. Acid-based methods can remove more impurities through their chemical reactions, as well as the high-temperature method, but they require large amounts of energy and create more environmental pollution. Because synthetic graphite is already graphitized at a very high temperature, its purification process is similar to its initial impurity removal method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey leads the way globally when it comes to graphite reserves, with around 90 million metric tons, followed by Brazil (74 million metric tons) and China (52 million metric tons). Other large players include Madagascar (26 million metric tons), Mozambique (25 million metric tons), and Tanzania (18 million metric tons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SILICON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graphite has been the technology of choice for lithium-ion batteries since its inception in the 1990s. However, as graphite hits energy-density limits, elements of the industry are championing silicon to play a larger role in battery anodes. Supporters of silicon argue that using the material could significantly increase the energy density of the anode and provide the battery longer runtimes. In theory, silicon anodes have tenfold the energy density of graphite anodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silicon is the most abundant mineral in the Earth’s crust. The production of pure silicon for batteries occurs in two stages, as each stage yields two different types of silicon based on varying levels of purity that are meant for different end uses. Silica occurs naturally in the form of quartz. It is purified by oxygen removal through a reaction with carbon in an electrode arc furnace, resulting in metallurgical-grade silicon that is 98 percent pure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical-grade silicon is further refined by grinding it into a powder and reacting it with acid. The resulting chemical has a low boiling point and is distilled to remove further impurities. Lastly, it is reacted with hydrogen at a high temperature for 200 to 300 hours to produce a silicon of a very high purity level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excluding the United States, ferrosilicon accounted for almost 70 percent of world silicon production on a silicon-content basis in 2021. The leading countries for ferrosilicon production were, on a silicon-content basis, China (6 million metric tons), Russia (580,000 metric tons), and Norway (350,000 metric tons), highlighting China’s dominance of the mineral’s production. For silicon metal, the leading producers were China, Brazil, and Norway. China accounted for approximately 70 percent of total global estimated production of silicon materials in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-capabilities&quot;&gt;U.S. Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several nations, especially China, are ahead in the production, ownership, and control of refining, purification, and concentration of several critical minerals and raw materials key to the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries. For instance, as of 2019, China was processing 65 percent of the world’s cobalt. Likewise, China refines more than 90 percent of global natural graphite. China also processes 58 percent of global lithium, 35 percent of the world’s nickel, and 87 percent of rare earths. Even critical minerals that are mined in the United States are often exported to China to be processed and then returned for domestic use. Whereas the United States has some reserves in a few critical minerals that are inputs in lithium-ion batteries, the country is not a significant player in processing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, years of focused industrial policy in China — including trade protectionism, low environmental standards, and the use of state subsidies to enable operations to run at a loss — has paid off exceptionally. Nevertheless, while China is by far the leader in refining minerals, it is important to recognize that other countries have capabilities as well. Chile for example, processes 29 percent of the world’s lithium while Malaysia processes 12 percent of rare earths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-biden-administrations-approach-to-building-more-resilient-supply-chains&quot;&gt;The Biden Administration’s Approach to Building More Resilient Supply Chains&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many months of research, the Biden administration identified several sectors whose supply chains are critical to U.S. economic security. In its 100-Day Reviews under Executive Order 14017, part of the report Building Resilient Supply Chains, Revitalizing American Manufacturing, and Fostering Broad-based Growth, the White House assessed supply chain vulnerabilities across four key sectors: semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging; large-capacity batteries, such as those for EVs; critical minerals and materials; and pharmaceuticals and advanced pharmaceutical ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals are recognized as the building blocks for modern technologies at the cornerstone of national security and economic prosperity, and in February 2022, the White House announced several investment packages to remedy the United States’ vulnerabilities in the critical minerals and raw materials sector. In addition, the Department of the Interior released a list of 50 critical minerals to inform these efforts. These investments aim to secure, among other essential technologies, the supply chains of lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the Department of Defense’s Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment program had awarded $35 million to separate and process heavy rare-earth elements in Mountain Pass, California. The Department of Energy is currently managing a $140 million demonstration project to recover rare-earth elements and critical minerals from coal ash and other mine waste as part of the IIJA. The Department of Energy likewise injects $3 billion in investments to refine battery materials and recycle them. Berkshire Hathaway Energy Renewables announced a new demonstration facility in Imperial County, California, to test a lithium extraction process from geothermal brine as part of a multibillion-dollar investment in lithium. Altogether, Sections 40207 of the IIJA requires the Department of Energy to fund more than $6 billion in grants related to the research, supply, processing, and recycling of materials and minerals critical for lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense has also entered into agreements with mining companies to enhance domestic mining capabilities, such as the $90 million project signed with Albemarle to reopen the company’s Kings Mountain lithium mine in North Carolina. These agreements are entered into under the Defense Production Act (DPA) and utilize appropriated funds authorized in the IRA. A DPA determination issued in 2022 authorized the Department of Defense to conduct feasibility studies for mature mining and processing projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legislation has also strived to enhance research in the critical minerals sector, particularly as it pertains to assessing and enhancing current U.S. capabilities. For instance, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act establishes an Earth Mapping Resources Initiative within the U.S. Geological Survey, which aims to speed up efforts to acquire integrated topographic, geologic, geochemical, and geophysical mapping. The section prioritizes critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s “Securing a Made in America Supply Chain for Critical Minerals” announcement emphasizes that the administration is undertaking action across the federal government to secure critical minerals and raw materials supply chains. First, the Biden administration states that it aims to update outdated mining laws and regulations — chief among them the Mining Law of 1872, which “still governs mining of most critical minerals on federal public lands” — with the establishment of an interagency working group led by the Department of the Interior. The working group has produced several recommendations to enhance various features of mining operations. The announcement likewise directs the United States Geological Survey within the Department of the Interior to update the federal list of minerals essential to economic or national security and vulnerable to disruption. Second, the White House announced a memorandum of understanding between the Departments of Energy, Defense, and State to coordinate stockpiling operations. National Defense Stockpile authority was given to the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment in an October 2021 executive order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trade-tools-and-tax-incentives&quot;&gt;Trade Tools and Tax Incentives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRA is perhaps the most significant legislation to accelerate transportation electrification and clean energy project deployment in U.S. history and stands as the flagship policy to accelerate the transition to lower carbon emissions in the future. However, provisions in the IRA prohibiting reliance on China in the EV supply chain have come at the cost of added difficulty in the sourcing and processing of critical minerals that works at cross purposes with the goals of the green transition. The Biden administration’s current quest to diversify away from China is thus compromising efforts to spur a transition to renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A layer of laws and regulations have put restrictions on how firms can source and produce critical minerals to remain eligible for subsidies. In March 2023, the Department of Commerce updated rules on how it applies the term Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC), limiting the universe of suppliers (most notably China) that car manufacturers can use if they desire to have their vehicles remain eligible for the IRA EV tax credit. If any critical mineral used in the production of an EV was extracted, processed, or recycled in an FEOC, the end vehicle becomes ineligible for the $7,500 tax credit that consumers receive after purchase. Additionally, in December 2023, the Department of the Treasury released proposed guidance on clean vehicle provisions in the IRA where it set critical mineral sourcing requirements for the tax credit. Beginning at 40 percent in 2023 and increasing year over year, certain percentages of critical minerals must be extracted in the United States or a country that the United States has an FTA with (with an additional exception made for batteries recycled in North America). These policies, while having the laudable goal of diversifying dependence on China in EV supply chains, make sourcing and processing critical minerals for EVs more difficult and costly for manufacturers. Indeed, given market realities and scarcity of supply from countries other than China, IRA requirements for eligibility for tax credits appear impossible to meet in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognizant of the soaring demand for critical minerals related to the energy transition, the administration has lessened, through regulation, the sourcing and manufacturing requirements of the IRA with two novel interpretations of the statute. In December 2022, guidance from the Department of the Treasury permitted the “lease loophole,” in which EVs that are not assembled in North America, do not meet the origin requirements on battery content and critical minerals, and are above price caps are still eligible for the $7,500 tax credit if they are classified as “commercial vehicles.” This guidance has supported an increase in EV sales as more consumers have opted for leasing instead of outright purchasing an EV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second workaround to a strict reading of the IRA, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) attempted to negotiate critical mineral agreements (CMAs) with supplying countries. These agreements could in turn ensure that partner countries would be considered as “FTA Countries” under the IRA, an approach that seems to have floundered. The United States signed the first, and so far only, CMA in March 2023 with Japan. The objective of this novel trade and cooperation agreement is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . to strengthen and diversify critical minerals supply chains and promote the adoption of electric vehicle battery technologies by formalizing the shared commitment of the Parties to facilitate trade, promote fair competition and market-oriented conditions for trade in critical minerals, ensure robust labor and environmental standards, and cooperate in efforts to ensure secure, sustainable, and equitable critical minerals supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Japan is not a critical minerals source, the country possesses related capabilities, including mineral processing and EV battery production. This CMA sparked interest by other nations and blocs, notably Indonesia, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, which have expressed a desire to negotiate similar agreements. Indonesia and the United States have held preliminary talks on a deal involving Indonesian nickel, a critical mineral of which they hold the largest natural reserves globally. The United States and the United Kingdom’s trade representatives have touted “significant progress” in a bilateral CMA between the two trading blocs, although the agreement has yet to be concluded. Likewise, the European Union and the United States have discussed reaching a Japan-like CMA, although talks seem to have stumbled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, U.S. policymakers have engaged allies Canada and Australia on critical minerals cooperation. The United States and Canada announced a previous Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals collaboration, while the United States has established a Critical Minerals Working Group with Australia. In all, the United States is engaging its economic allies and partners to enhance the trade of critical minerals as they ramp up domestic capabilities. However, that engagement has so far been lackluster due to significant pushback domestically, including from lawmakers who either wish to be more engaged in negotiations or believe more agreements would undermine the reshoring objectives of current U.S. trade policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-drive-for-cmas-sputters&quot;&gt;The Drive for CMAs Sputters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to strike additional CMA deals with allies and trading partners have met pushback domestically, including from the bipartisan leadership of the congressional committees with jurisdiction over trade, as well as from Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and an important author of the IRA. Senator Manchin has sharply criticized the workarounds, characterizing them as weakening the sourcing and manufacturing requirements in the IRA. Saying that the Biden administration is “distorting the plain text of U.S. law,” Representative Jason Smith (R-MO), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who generally objects to “corporate green welfare” contained in the IRA, has also decried the proposal to deem CMAs as FTAs under the IRA. Even strong proponents of the IRA, such as Senator Rony Wyden (D-OR), chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, and Representative Richard Neal (D-MA), ranking member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, have risen up against the USTR’s current CMA strategy, citing workers’ rights and environmental concerns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The critical minerals agreement announced today is unacceptable . . . the Administration does not have the authority to unilaterally enter into free trade agreements. Human rights, environmental rights, and economic opportunity are all closely interwoven, and had the Administration wanted to include meaningful labor or environmental protections in this agreement, they would’ve engaged Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another camp of opposition to administration policy and the IRA is led by Senator Mike Crapo (R-ID), ranking member on the Senate Committee on Finance, which argues: “Additionally, the Treasury Department has announced several sets of rules and planned rules that will enable Chinese minerals, materials and entities to qualify for IRA subsidies, while potentially also excluding domestic players who are connected to traditional energy source.” The rushed, disjointed policies at the heart of these provisions were unworkable from the outset. In October 2024, following diplomatic outreach by Vice President Kamala Harris and while the USTR engaged with Indonesia on CMA negotiations, more widespread opposition was expressed from another broad-based coalition of senators, including Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Tammy Baldwin (D-MN), Amy Klobuchar (D-WI), and Lisa Murkowski (R-Al), among others, who noted: “Given the extraordinary taxpayer resources at play we strongly believe that eligibility for the critical minerals credit must prioritize domestic producers and existing free trade agreement partners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[U.S.] engagement has so far been lackluster due to significant pushback domestically, including from lawmakers who either wish to be more engaged in negotiations or believe more agreements would undermine the reshoring objectives of current U.S. trade policy.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a multilateral forum, the United States has engaged its partners and allies on critical minerals through the Department of State-led Minerals Security Partnership (MSP). This partnership, which includes 13 states and the European Union, seeks to develop sustainable critical mineral supply chains through public-private partnership, targeted financial support, and diplomatic work. In June, the MSP shortlisted a list of 15 projects that it intends to fund by the end of 2023. In September 2023, Norway, Italy, and — most importantly — India joined the MSP, signaling that the desire to diversify critical minerals supply away from China is strong throughout the international community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are nascent talks mostly touted by Europe, where negotiations on a CMA are seemingly stalled, to create a “critical minerals club” or a “buyers club.” This club would benefit its members (in theory, Brussels and its allies) by setting more consistent prices for minerals purchasers, seeking to avoid unstable prices in a time of high demand and fluctuating supply. While meeting with the U.S. Treasury secretary in early 2023, a senior German official raised the possibility of a minerals club, but the idea has yet to gain much traction in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;Policy Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building U.S. and allied capacity to rebalance this dependency while achieving green transition goals will require a coherent, well-articulated industrial policy with U.S. leadership that expressly balances domestic production goals, objectives for the green energy transition, and domestic demand for imported inputs from allies and partners, as well as from China, when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The president should task an interagency team to draft an industrial policy plan for growing domestic production of lithium-ion batteries. Given its resources and the extensive work already done, the administration should prepare specific estimates and projections for future needs for key critical minerals, constituent minerals and chemistries that are necessary to reach its goals. This assessment could also include what CMAs and other enhanced trade relationships will be necessary to secure supply for projected needs. For example, a recent S&amp;amp;P report assessed that while lithium sourcing was fairly likely to meet the IRA’s requirements by 2035, it is very unlikely that enough cobalt and nickel supply will be able to keep up. Does the administration agree? How can trade relationships be improved to create access for U.S. manufacturers to a greater and more consistent supply of inputs critical to scaling up domestic production?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of diversification, working effectively with other countries is essential. CSIS’s previous work on this subject concluded that an exclusive focus on domestic manufacturing was not the most productive path to resiliency and instead focused on “friendshoring” — encouraging the movement of supply chains to countries that do not pose a national security threat — and the development of “trusted trade partnerships” with them. The U.S. government should do more to ramp up friendshoring efforts in the form of new agreements and should attempt to build up the United States’ own processing capabilities to ensure the future competitiveness of the U.S. lithium-ion battery sector. Additionally, the United States should also foster increased regulatory cooperation with other countries in key areas of the battery supply chain by building upon existing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Administration statements on supply chain policy regularly reference the importance of cooperation with friends and allies, but it is becoming clear that this administration may not be capable of actually concluding a viable set of international trade and cooperation agreements that would increase supply chain security in this sector, absent support of Congress and domestic stakeholders. Without this support, the administration’s campaign for additional CMAs has faltered, and business uncertainty continues to grow surrounding the viability of lithium-ion battery production in the United States. It is urgent that the administration engage with Congress to achieve a solid bipartisan consensus on how the United States should balance trade and industrial and climate policy objectives in this sector. Concluding several CMAs with key countries such as the United Kingdom, Europe, Indonesia, Argentina, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be important to shoring up supply chain resiliency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discriminatory aspects of the IRA, to be discussed in the next paper, have engendered sharp criticism and may result in retaliation from trading partners that could unnecessarily threaten a strategy built on trusted trade partners and the green transition. Again, a multilateral approach to friendshoring and reducing dependency on China cannot be achieved without more active involvement by Congress in shaping trade agreements and better calibration of the legislative requirements for domestic sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is urgent that the administration engage with Congress to achieve a solid bipartisan consensus on how the United States should balance trade and industrial and climate policy objectives in this sector.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the language in the IRA reflecting preference for FTA partners to heart, the administration should investigate options for increasing investment in FTA partners that possess significant reserves of key minerals (such as lithium deposits in FTA partner Chile or Canada’s cobalt, graphite, lithium, and nickel deposits). If the United States is to reach such agreements successfully, it will have to negotiate not only extraction opportunities but also responses to the other countries’ demands to establish more value-added refining operations in their countries. Additionally, the United States should push for regulatory reforms that could be made to incentivize domestic production of key constituent materials for the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, China’s domestic industrial policy has over time “effectively monopolized numerous critical mineral supply chains, including mining, mineral processing, refining, metallurgy, and end-use manufacturing,” making the United States and much of the world dependent on China. An uncomfortable reality is that the United States is not currently a significant player in the global mineral extraction and processing markets. The United States depends on imports for renewable technologies, chief among them the lithium-ion battery, and the critical mineral inputs essential to accomplishing a green transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to processing the materials necessary for lithium-ion battery production, the Biden administration is making multifaceted efforts to incentivize more production in the United States. However, subsidies in the IRA are set to significantly increase the demand for lithium-ion batteries to a level that will far exceed the country’s current manufacturing capabilities and available supply of certain critical mineral inputs. Leveraging subsidy packages (chief among them IRA tax credits) and trade tools (such as CMAs) to incentivize production by U.S. partners and allies is therefore a critical piece of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hindering U.S. producers from sourcing even small quantities of scarce inputs of critical materials for battery production from China and enforcing domestic content requirements that constrict the ability of U.S. businesses to turn to other nations to satisfy demand for manufacturing inputs will make it more difficult to achieve green transition goals. The three elements of current U.S. policy — incentivizing the green transition via ambitious policy packages such as the IRA, reshoring capabilities in critical sectors, and diversifying away from China — reflects conflicting goals. Policies to diversify away from China and reshore production capabilities will hinder long-term environmental objectives. It is thus imperative that the United States adopt a friendshoring approach to the green transition and allow U.S. businesses further down the lithium-ion battery supply chain to access enough minerals and materials to scale up production. In two subsequent papers, the CSIS Scholl Chair will discuss views on pursuing a more coherent industrial policy that balances these competing objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies (CFCS) at RUSI convened an online workshop entitled “The Resilience and Integrity of the Financial System in Ukraine: Two Years after Russia’s Full-Scale Invasion”. As Ukraine continues its commitment to strengthening anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and implementing EU reforms, it recognises the significance of preparing for the upcoming enhanced follow-up procedure and 6th round of the MONEYVAL mutual evaluation, the regional body of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to which the country belongs. In light of this, the virtual workshop addressed key issues crucial for ensuring Ukraine’s readiness for the assessment. The workshop forms part of CFCS’s Supervising and Monitoring Ukraine’s Reconstruction Funds (SMURF) project, supported by the National Endowment for Democracy. The workshop, held under the Chatham House Rule, gathered representatives from key Ukrainian financial institutions and relevant authorities, including the State Financial Monitoring Service of Ukraine, the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Ministry of the Digital Transformation of Ukraine and others. This report summarises the main findings of the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s second enhanced follow-up MONEYVAL report, published in June 2020, identified several deficiencies in the country’s technical compliance with standards set by the FATF, the global standard-setter in anti-financial crime. The report flagged areas including risk assessments of new technologies, risk-based supervision and regulation of virtual assets, statistical data on AML and counterterrorist finance (CTF), and others as key issues where the country still has significant work to undertake. During the online workshop, participants reflected on these flagged areas, offering insights in how to effectively tackle these challenges. The workshop not only focused on Ukraine’s technical compliance with AML standards but also delved into the effectiveness of the country’s existing response to financial crime. It focused on four principal areas: development of the law on virtual assets; a path to creating a single register of bank accounts of individuals and legal entities; public–private partnerships; and recovery of the proceeds of crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ukraines-technical-compliance-with-aml-standards&quot;&gt;Ukraine’s Technical Compliance with AML Standards&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;development-of-the-law-on-virtual-assets&quot;&gt;Development of the Law on Virtual Assets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual assets and the laws on their regulation emerged as a key topic during the workshop. This was largely due to the spotlight cast on the topic following the downgrade of Ukraine’s rating to “partially compliant” in its second enhanced follow-up MONEYVAL report to in relation to FATF Recommendation 15 on new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first attempt to regulate virtual assets in Ukraine, aligning the country with international standards on AML/CTF and comprehensive financial monitoring, was made in 2022, when the Law on Virtual Assets No. 2074-IX was adopted and signed. However, participants noted that the law is not yet in effect due to delays caused by required amendments to the Tax Code of Ukraine. A participant clarified that the reason behind the delay is that the necessary draft law for taxing operations with virtual assets has not been developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than developing the necessary technical amendments to the Tax Code of Ukraine, a different pathway was chosen to address the issues around the regulation of virtual assets. Two alternative draft laws were registered in Ukraine’s legislature, the Verkhovna Rada, to revise the already-adopted Law on Virtual Assets and legalise the market and solve the taxation issue. However, neither has yet been passed. One participant noted that the main difference between the two draft laws lies in the taxation rules and classification of virtual assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draft Law No. 10225, developed by Ukraine’s National Securities and Stock Market Commission in cooperation with EY (Ernst &amp;amp; Young), translates the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) standards into the Ukrainian context and proposes a standard tax rate of 18%, with a 1.5% military tax. Draft Law No. 10225-1, on the other hand, was developed by the Ministry of the Digital Transformation of Ukraine, and proposes the combination of the Base Law No. 2074-IX with MiCA standards. This draft law proposes a three-year transition period during which the tax rate would be only 5%, with an increase of this rate to 9% over the subsequent five years and 18% after eight years of market regulation. This second draft law aims to simplify the creation of the virtual asset market, streamline the authorisation process for service providers, and promote market development in accordance with EU standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Ukraine has not adopted either of the two draft laws, workshop participants noted that there is already widespread use of virtual assets in Ukraine and a growing demand among the population, underscoring the need to regulate the industry. Ukraine was ranked fifth on the Global Crypto Adoption Index in 2023, and approximately 6.5 million Ukrainians, 15.72% of the population, owned digital currency in 2022. It should also be noted that while Ukraine’s AML Law offers a legal framework for launching AML/CTF regulation of virtual assets, the law has not be enforced since it came into effect in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As market regulations continue to develop, it is also becoming necessary to understand what effective financial monitoring of the virtual asset industry would look like. Participants agreed that effective monitoring relies on a strong market framework. This includes having a diverse range of service providers that serve a broad user base. Without such an ecosystem, the necessary data for effective monitoring would be lacking. Therefore, it is essential to simplify the authorisation procedures for these services, especially during the initial stages, to foster market growth and stimulate demand among a wider population. In the first period of market development, the authorisation process should be as straightforward as possible, as this will help to shape the market and create demand for the service providers from a larger population. Once the market is shaped, additional tools for regulatory influence, impact and review/control will be implemented and become a regular element of the financial market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pseudonymity of virtual assets was another key topic that emerged during the discussion. One participant posited that most users and customers of virtual assets do not consider anonymity the most important aspect of virtual assets, and would be willing to comply with Know Your Customer measures and allow themselves to be identified to ensure they have no criminal intent. Both of the draft laws noted above propose that all service providers must fully identify their users in every case. With the implementation of the law, virtual asset users will have the opportunity to participate in a regulated and transparent market. Another issue identified during the workshop was the lack of crypto-to-fiat gateways in the market. It is important for customers to have the freedom to move their money, especially for exchanging between fiat currency and virtual currencies. However, due to various complications and currency regulations, this task remains quite challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the above-mentioned challenges, one participant drew attention to the benefits of legalising virtual assets in Ukraine, particularly the impact on technical compliance with AML standards and market developments. They noted that legalisation of virtual assets can provide opportunities for business growth, technological advancement, and an increase in state revenue. Additionally, it can help to eliminate the use of Ukraine’s market by criminals for money laundering of crypto assets and sanctions evasion. In the long term, it can also provide access to EU markets in crypto assets and offer additional channels for money flows towards Ukraine’s reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next important steps for the legalisation of the market are expected from the Tax Committee of the Verkhovna Rada. The Committee is currently reviewing the draft laws and will choose one as the main law for market development. Workshop participants acknowledged that it is difficult to provide a timeline because of the obstacles caused by the war. Nonetheless, the representative of the Ministry of the Digital Transformation of Ukraine noted that the decision as to which law will move forward is expected by the end of summer 2024. After that, amendments to the basic law could take effect by the end of 2024. With virtual asset companies already working in Ukraine, differing opinions were expressed as to whether the market can operate without waiting for a specific regulation to be adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants in the workshop and authors of the draft laws have been in constant dialogue with the community, the market and potential participants. Overall, workshop participants agreed that there is a need to create a regulatory environment as soon as possible and pass the relevant law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-path-to-creating-a-single-register-of-bank-accounts-and-safe-deposit-holders&quot;&gt;A Path to Creating a Single Register of Bank Accounts and Safe-Deposit Holders&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Ukraine’s progress towards EU accession, another concern identified by workshop participants was the necessity of creating a central register of bank accounts and safe-deposit holders, stemming from the requirements of the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Ukraine has in fact initiated the development of a single register of bank accounts. During the workshop, participants noted that the register of bank accounts of legal entities is already in place, administered by the State Tax Service of Ukraine, and that law enforcement authorities have access to it. However, information about the bank accounts of individuals is not included in the register, and it was agreed that this should be the focus of future work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant drew attention to efforts by the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine in this regard. The Ministry had prepared a draft law entitled “On Amendments to the Tax Code of Ukraine and Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine Regarding the Establishment of the Unified Register of Accounts of Individuals and Legal Entities and Individual Bank Safes”. Yet the participant said that in 2023, after the draft law was submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, concerns about privacy, confidentiality and human rights compliance were raised, and the matter was approached with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passage of the law was delayed as specific legislative amendments in relation to confidentiality were required, which the Ministry of Finance continues to work on. The law’s drafters were asked to research the confidentiality issue and prepare the necessary amendments to provide safeguards in relation to private information. Currently there is a concern among government officials regarding how personal data could be leaked or misused for malicious purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant noted that officials have identified as a major obstacle a lack of coherence of Ukraine’s data protection regulations in relation to the EU framework. The country has not yet adopted the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation provisions, which would impact the entire process. Participants also noted that Russia has made attempts to abuse the register and use the information included in it. To deal with cyber security threats, a deadline for the establishment of the register has been set for 2027. This will give Ukrainian authorities time to involve cyber security experts in its development and prepare the appropriate procedures and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One participant recalled that the EU’s Ukraine Facility programme requirements mandate the implementation of a single register by 2027. Ukraine’s National Revenue Strategy for 2024–30 acknowledges the importance of building trust and confidence within the population in the use of private information about bank accounts in the register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-effectiveness-of-ukraines-response-to-financial-crime&quot;&gt;The Effectiveness of Ukraine’s Response to Financial Crime&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;publicprivate-partnerships-ppps&quot;&gt;Public–Private Partnerships (PPPs)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the discussion of Ukraine’s technical compliance with AML standards, the workshop also placed a spotlight on the issue of the effectiveness of the country’s response to financial crime. The 2017 Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) on Ukraine concluded that the implementation of measures necessary to fight financial crime in the country was not sufficiently effective. Consequently, the workshop discussion extended beyond the technical ratings of the FATF. Among the topics raised against this backdrop was the current status of public–private partnerships (PPPs) in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants emphasised the key role of PPPs, particularly in the evolving landscape of AML technology. They underscored how PPPs significantly enhance the formulation of efficient market rules and regulations in two key ways. First, they serve as effective deterrents against market violations, while driving progress. Second, given the potential unfamiliarity of state officials with emerging technologies and their business applications, PPPs offer a collaborative platform for knowledge sharing to facilitate deeper understanding of these technologies. However, it was noted that the bureaucratic nature of certain authorities can cause challenges in establishing robust PPPs. Nevertheless, one participant argued that the key to initiating and sustaining PPPs lies in their voluntary nature. Thus, there needs to be a strong emphasis on fostering willingness and providing incentives for the private sector to collaborate with the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positive examples of PPPs in Ukraine emerged during the discussion, although these were not always in relation to conventional financial crime. Participants argued that PPPs in Ukraine are often used for such purposes as raising awareness and establishing communication channels, showcasing the diverse and innovative ways in which they can be leveraged for mutual benefit. On this, one participant highlighted the efforts of the National Bank of Ukraine in raising awareness and establishing a direct communication channel with the private sector. Also mentioned as a good example of a PPP was the Public Council under the Ukrainian Ministry of Finance, a group that includes representatives of public organisations, trade unions and other citizen associations, which gathers annually to discuss issues related to financial services and their impact on society. It was noted that the State Financial Monitoring Service has also set up a Public Council on AML issues. Another participant highlighted that the Ministry of Digital Transformation is actively working on developing a regulatory “sandbox”, scheduled for completion by the end of 2024. This sandbox aims to streamline communication between businesses and government authorities, fostering an environment conducive to PPPs. While some of the initiatives mentioned by the participants suggested promising steps towards PPP development in Ukraine, it was agreed that there remains a need to further strengthen and expand these efforts and learn from foreign experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recovery-of-the-proceeds-of-crime&quot;&gt;Recovery of the Proceeds of Crime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key topic raised concerning the effectiveness of Ukraine’s anti-financial crime measures related to the country’s efforts to recover the proceeds of crime. Asset recovery is a key FATF priority, particularly under the current Singaporean presidency. In fact, Ukraine’s MER noted that the country needs to ensure that prosecutors handling proceeds-generating cases are well-trained in modern financial investigative techniques, and highlighted a need for focused guidance on the importance of early restraint and confiscation of proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Ukraine’s efforts to recover assets, a participant from the Prosecutor General’s Office noted that considerable effort has gone into developing the efficiency of pre-trial investigations of criminal cases. The Prosecutor General’s website has published reports on the results of AML investigations, noting that 7,832 criminal offences related to AML and CTF were investigated in 2023. The report also shows that, according to indictments, the established value of legalised property obtained by criminal means in this period was UAH 2,998,290,540 ($78,263,910), of which UAH 212,426,030 ($5,544,923.50) has been seized. However, despite these achievements, it was highlighted that the key to ensuring effectiveness in recovering the proceeds of crime lies in taking a comprehensive approach during pre-trial investigations. Participants noted that while accessing information about assets or accounts within Ukraine is swift, investigations involving international partners take a long time and can be delayed by prolonged procedures. That said, Ukraine’s formal and informal cooperation with EU countries on mutual legal assistance was reported as working well. Additionally, attention was drawn to the importance of court judgements authorising confiscation, highlighting the key role that these play in asset recovery. It was noted that Ukraine’s particularly low score on Immediate Outcome 7 of its MER – which relates to the effectiveness of a country’s money laundering investigations and prosecutions – should serve as a reminder of the need to demonstrate effective use of financial investigations to recover assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, one workshop participant emphasised that it is crucial to recognise that the impact of the FATF assessment of Ukraine is still ongoing. Ukraine’s 2020 MER requires the country to continually report on its efforts to address the deficiencies identified in the MER, and it must submit a progress report by December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, while Ukraine’s next MONEYVAL Assessment will not occur until 2027, workshop participants emphasised that all relevant stakeholders in the country should take the necessary measures to both uphold high standards of technical compliance by passing relevant legislation and ensure their effectiveness by ensuring that these laws are implemented. The world – and the EU in particular – is watching.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李宇軒：推翻中共可達至解放香港 國安法後提議游說外國取消與港引渡條例&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2zOtMj3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（28日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第54日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。庭上展示李與「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）之間的訊息對話，二人在《國安法》實施之前討論對策，裴倫德指香港在整個地緣政治的大局裡會被殃及，李則表示香港人樂意「攬炒」。李的訊息又指香港人嘗試以示威來說服國際社會作出改變，但是至今仍未見有任何制裁措施針對侵犯人權者，只有「譴責聲明」。李指上述訊息的潛台詞是希望 IPAC 除了「譴責聲明」之外，可以為香港做更多事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;二人另就運動手段和目標辯論，裴倫德認為如果最終目標是香港自治的話，毀滅中共是一個手段，因香港自由化的敵人是中共；李雖然同意推翻中共可能是達至解放香港的一種手段，但是香港人的目標並不是在北京層面推動民主化。李亦認為外界期望香港人透過上街來推翻中共是不切實際，因香港年輕一代已經開始覺得悼念六四不關自己事，現時統治香港的人是「香港政權」加上「北京政權」，但香港社會暫未有足夠意見認為要擴展至「推翻中共」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指裴倫德的訊息是在說服他嘗試把眼光集中在中共身上，而非只聚焦在香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第11天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;裴倫德訊息指香港會遭受殃及-李宇軒覺得香港人樂意攬炒&quot;&gt;裴倫德訊息指香港會遭受殃及 李宇軒覺得香港人樂意「攬炒」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示李宇軒與「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC）創辦人裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）之間的訊息紀錄。在2020年6月27日，裴倫德向李稱他們的策略需要調整（“Andy I think our strategy need to pivot.”），又指現時問題是如何懲罰和征服，並如何利用降臨在香港的「可怕東西」，在六個月內「殺死中共」：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The question now is how to punish, divide and conquer. And how to use the terrible things that will happen in HK over the next six months to kill the CCP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;裴倫德補充，香港會遭受殃及（“HK will be collateral.”）。李回應，香港人知道並且樂意扮演這個角色（“this we know and we are very happy to play this role”）。李庭上解釋，訊息中「play this role」的意思是「攬炒」，即是不論對於自己一方、對方還是各方，「對大家都有傷害嘅嘢。」至於裴倫德的訊息「HK will be collateral.」，李指他意思是在整個地緣政治的大局裡，香港會變成遭受殃及，而李認為香港人樂意「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問李的意思是否香港會遭到破壞，對方同樣會遭到破壞，而李樂意付出這個代價。李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒預料香港不會再有大型示威-因示威只換來譴責聲明不值得-未見任何制裁&quot;&gt;李宇軒預料香港不會再有大型示威 因示威只換來「譴責聲明」不值得 未見任何制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒其後向裴倫德說，中共已經做了非常可怕的事，即是他們的陣營沒有任何人要求訂立《國安法》，也沒有人設局誘使中共這樣做，中共只是出其不意地立法及實質上重燃運動，李認為他們只需要說出真相。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;裴倫德問李，示威有什麼前景（“What are the prospects for a demo?”）。李則指香港人嘗試以示威來說服國際社會作出改變，但是至今仍未見有任何制裁措施針對已退休的指揮官陶輝或其他侵犯人權者，他們仍然在自由自在，但香港人得到的只有「譴責聲明」（“so far we haven’t seen concrete sanctions falling upon, say, Dover or other perpetrators; they still roam free and all we get are ‘condemn’ statements”）。李又指，香港人的性命只換來一些聲明並不值得（“the lives of HKers aren’t worth just in exchange for some statements”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李庭上解釋，他當時的判斷是香港短期內不會再有大型示威，因為香港人不認為有用，經過示威後除了「譴責聲明」外便什麼也得不到，所以李在訊息中向裴倫德解釋為什麼香港不會再有大型示威出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指當李說香港人不認為示威有用時，李是否該些香港人之一？李回答：「我當然係香港人。」控方又問，李認為示威沒有用，那他認為做什麼才有用。李則表示：「我唔知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，裴倫德是否不建議再進行大型示威。李表示不是，當時《國安法》即將生效，裴倫德希望他可以預計會發生什麼事，以便日後在英國或美國層面作出回應，所以李告訴裴倫德大型示威似乎不會再發生。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰再問，李是否在訊息中說服裴倫德或 IPAC 要採取什麼行動。李則指上述訊息的潛台詞是：「如果你哋做多過出譴責聲明嘅話會更好喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱為香港而運動推翻中共僅次要動機-裴倫德則認為應先推翻中共才能解決香港問題&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱為香港而運動、推翻中共僅次要動機 裴倫德則認為應先推翻中共才能解決香港問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又向裴倫德表示，他們的目標是建立香港，推翻中共可能是一個次要動機，但這動機從不會強大到足以令香港人考慮犧牲自己（“the thing is, our aim is to first establish HK, taking down CCP might be a secondary motive but it will never be a strong enough motive for HKers to consider sacrificing themselves”），因他們是為香港而參與運動，而不是在北京層面推動民主化（“we campaign for Hong Kong, not for some democratic change at Beijing level”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;裴倫德則回應，「推翻中共」與「建立香港」兩者是密不可分，如果最終目標是香港自治的話，毀滅中共是一個手段（“If the end is self government, the means is the destruction of the CCP”）。李宇軒則回應，這是手段與最終目標的問題（“it’s the means vs end perception”），而推翻中共可能是達至解放香港的一種手段（“take down CCP might be a mean to liberate HK (the end)”），但不是掉轉過來。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問李和裴倫德是否在訊息中辯論，李表示「都有啲」；李官又問二人是否有意見上的分歧。李指分歧可以總結為，他自己當時的形勢判斷是以香港為中心，而「Luke de Pulford 應該認為呢個係要由北京嗰度開始睇嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官追問，所以裴倫德的視野比李看得更遠和更大，因為他想中國作出改變。李則理解：「應該係 Luke de Pulford 認為首先要係中國做咗改變，然後先至可以解決香港問題，但我就覺得無論中國有冇改變都好，我個 focus 係喺香港嗰度。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問李所說的「中國改變」是否意指推翻中共。李同意。控方又問，想透過推翻中共達到什麼目標。李回答：「Liberate Hong Kong⋯⋯啫係解放香港，由中共手中解放出嚟，做返香港人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官則表示不解，昨天的「SWHK IPAC」群組訊息顯示，李並不主張香港獨立，與上述李和裴倫德之間的對話內容不同。李則解釋，在「SWHK IPAC」群組討論的語境之中，他的確不主張港獨，但是在與裴倫德討論的語境下，「我唔反對呢條 line。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;裴倫德稱香港自由化的敵人是中共-惟李宇軒指香港人不認為要擴展至推翻中共&quot;&gt;裴倫德稱香港自由化的敵人是中共 惟李宇軒指香港人不認為要擴展至「推翻中共」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;裴倫德向李解釋，從政的首項要點是「你永遠有一個敵人」，第二點是打敗敵人的方法是打散它的部隊、狠擊它和佔領它的領土。裴倫德又強調任何未能認清敵人的策略都不是策略，而香港自由化的敵人是中共。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李則指第二點是他們一直嘗試做的事，所以制裁是「願望清單」首位（“that’s why Sanctions have been on top of wishlists”），尤其是有針對目標的制裁（“esp targeted sanctions”）。李在庭上解釋，他在訊息所說的制裁對象是涉及侵犯人權的人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李在訊息中向裴倫德表示，他認為外界期望香港人透過上街來推翻中共是不切實際，香港年輕一代已經開始覺得悼念六四事不關己，所以敵人並不是中共本身。李續指，如果要談論敵人的話，現時統治香港的人是「香港政權」和「北京政權」，但暫時香港社會未有足夠意見認為要擴展至「推翻中共」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李庭上解釋，因為當時香港自由民主被壓縮的政治環境，是由香港政權所造成，而香港政權背後有北京政權撐腰，「叫香港嘅政權咁樣去管治」，所以他在訊息中說統治香港的人是「香港政權」和「北京政權」。他認為裴倫德是在說服他嘗試把眼光集中在中共身上，而非只聚焦在香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，所以裴倫德認為中共是敵人，有需要推翻它，過程中香港會被殃及。李同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒託裴倫德邀請外國政客參與反國安法聯署&quot;&gt;李宇軒託裴倫德邀請外國政客參與反國安法聯署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年6月29日，李宇軒向裴倫德傳送一份反《國安法》聯署聲明連結，指暫時收集了21個簽署，包括17名香港區議員和4名日本議員。李託裴倫德邀請更多外國政客、社運人士和組織參與聯署，並指聲明會安排在6月30日凌晨發布，因要趕及在國安法實施之前發布，以保護參與聯署的香港區議員和在港組織。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李供稱，SWHK 成員有共識不在 SWHK 的網站發布該聲明，他其後開設了一個名為「Anti NSL」的網站，在《國安法》生效之前發布了聲明，從6月30日至7月初，他仍然持續收集聯署及更新聯署名單。至於為何李在訊息中稱該聯署聲明可以補足 IPAC 的聲明，李庭上解釋該聯署聲明有香港區議員的支持，又開放予組織參與聯署，加上有日本議員，「呢啲係當時我覺得 IPAC 聲明做唔到嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後，李向裴倫德傳送新聞稿，顯示聲明標題為〈香港民選區議員及各國議員等組織聯署 反對港版《國安法》並呼籲國際社會推行政策回應〉，共有83名議員、政界人物和民間組織參與聯署，涵蓋14個國家。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方庭上展示「Anti NSL」網站截圖，顯示聯署人士包括「香港監察」創辦人羅傑斯和山尾志櫻里（本名「菅野志桜里」）。聲明內容要求各國針對有份侵犯人權和削弱法治的中國和香港官員實施制裁，包括禁止入境、凍結資產等，又促請各國持續監察中國的行為，例如是否有違反《中英聯合聲明》。聲明又要求民主政體提供誘因支持企業將生產線和營運基地轉移至民主國家，以減少經濟方面對中國的依賴，各國應聯手在經濟層面脫離中國的影響，以及檢視中國資本的滲透。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;網站提供3種語言版本，即英語、德語和「香港話」。至於為何只有這三種語言，李表示沒有特別原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指國安法後出現政治罪行-研游說外國取消司法互助協議或引渡逃犯&quot;&gt;李宇軒指國安法後出現「政治罪行」 研游說外國取消司法互助協議或引渡逃犯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月2日，李宇軒問裴倫德是否應該游說外國取消與香港簽訂的司法互助協議或引渡逃犯措施，又問裴倫德或 IPAC 是否會就此展開工作，或者交給各地的港人組織去做。李庭上解釋，因為《國安法》實施之後，香港便開始有「政治罪行（political crimes）」，所以其他國家需要因應香港的政治罪行而重新檢視司法互助協議或引渡逃犯措施，以及考慮是否繼續簽訂協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，IPAC 部份成員成立了一個小組來研究這範疇，但他不是小組成員之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒協助-ipac-聯絡山尾志櫻里討論取消與港引渡協議&quot;&gt;李宇軒協助 IPAC 聯絡山尾志櫻里討論取消與港引渡協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，裴倫德要求李幫忙問日本議員山尾志櫻里翌日是否有空出席小組會議，討論引渡協議。李之後稱已問了山尾。控方問該次會議是關於什麼，李指不同 IPAC 成員會講各自地區與中國和香港司法管轄區之間的司法互助和引渡協議，以及有沒有機會要求政府重新檢視該些協議，之後成員會各自跟進。李亦確認除了山尾之外，還有英國、澳洲、加拿大和德國的 IPAC 成員出席會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;裴倫德告訴李，IPAC 之中有9個成員國家與香港仍有引渡協議，所以目標是游說這9個國家。他其後向李傳送一條 Google 線上會議連結，邀請李參與小組會議。李確認他有列席該會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;會議之後，裴倫德叫李向山尾確認她有意在日本議會提出修訂與香港之間的司法協議，並告訴李加拿大已經宣布撤回與香港簽訂的引渡條例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020年7月4日，裴倫德傳送一則 Twitter 帖文給李，內容提及 IPAC 經過開會討論《國安法》和引渡協議之後，確定他們的立場是不應有逃犯引渡協議，與會者包括加拿大眾議員 Garnett Genuis 和 加拿大律師 Irwin Cotler。他並託李叫 SWHK 轉發此帖文。李庭上確認他有列席上述帖文提及的會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;由於法官杜麗冰在午膳期間不慎被剪刀割傷，她稱雖然能夠止血，但決定提早至3時半休庭，以前往急症室治理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件將於4月8日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

But how do locals feel about the mercenaries?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wagner Group, a Russian private military company (PMC), appeared in Mali in December 2021 and is still operating there as of March 2024. There was some disruption in the immediate aftermath of the Wagner mutiny and then after the death of the group’s leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, with Wagner staff seemingly panicking, salaries being delayed and operations being suspended or downsized for some months. At the time of writing, however, the activities of Wagner have changed little overall compared to the first quarter of 2023, at least as far the perceptions of the Malians are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons why the Malian government began the discussions in early 2021 that eventually led to Wagner arriving in Mali are complex. This article will focus on one particular aspect, which is Wagner’s expected contribution to achieving the aims of a range of actors: the Malian government, the armed forces and various communities that make up the Malian social and political space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are strong perceptions that Wagner has contributed relatively little to Mali’s struggle against jihadist groups and may even have presided over a deterioration in the situation. Sectors of the population may indeed have expected that Wagner would help restore security and service delivery in areas affected by the jihadist insurgencies, but that does not appear to have been the primary reason why Wagner was called in, as far as the Malian authorities are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With just over 2,000 men in the country at the peak of its operations in early 2023 (according to Wagner sources), including a team handling the small air force that Wagner had established there, another team protecting the ruling elite and all support elements, Wagner simply did not have the resources to even contemplate reclaiming substantial portions of territory from Mali’s disparate opposition groups, which include five jihadist groups (Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, Ansar al-Din, Al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb, Al-Mourabitoun and Katibat Macina) and three coalitions of northern secessionist (or former secessionist) groups. Pro-Russian propagandists certainly celebrated the departure of French forces, but the Malian authorities originally had not intended to replace MINUSMA and French forces with Wagner. The intent had rather been to establish Wagner alongside the two missions, according to a senior source in the Malian government. As noted above, negotiations with Wagner and with the Russian authorities started even before the May 2021 coup that deposed President Bah N’daw (who had reportedly opposed his government colleagues’ enthusiasm for bringing Wagner in).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malians’ rationale was that MINUSMA and the French were too combat-shy and would never defeat the opposition with their soft counterinsurgency approach. French cosiness with some of the Tuareg groups in the north was viewed with particular apprehension and concern in Bamako, giving rise to a range of conspiracy theories. Bamako’s hypersensitivity on this issue has recently led to a diplomatic clash with the Algerian government. The Malian government does not like the reconciliation route to pacification with the Tuareg rebels in the north, which was sponsored by the French, and wants a military solution instead, which Wagner is happy to support. Wagner was thus meant to strengthen the offensive capability of the Malian armed forces, undermining the territorial control exercised by opposition groups and taking the war back to the north. Indeed, to this day, the recapture of Kidal in the north in November 2023 remains the main achievement of Wagner in Mali, as far as the Malian authorities are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;There are strong perceptions that Wagner has contributed relatively little to Mali’s struggle against jihadist groups and may even have presided over a deterioration in the situation&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malian authorities may have miscalculated when they decided to bring the Wagner Group in, underestimating the depth of geopolitical rivalries. However, when asked to choose between the French and Wagner, they opted for the latter and rejected French efforts to prevent the contract being signed in the second half of 2021. Among the reasons for this are likely to be Wagner’s commitment to securing the regime and to doing whatever it asks for. Many who supported Wagner’s entry regret that this resulted in the departure of MINUSMA and of the French, with a destabilising impact in some areas. However, it is not clear to what extent the regime that emerged from the May 2021 coup sees this as a problem now. Wagner might have deliberately manipulated the situation to create a long-term Malian dependency on its services, but it is also perfectly plausible that the Malian regime (perhaps unwittingly) manoeuvred itself into this position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Malian government and the military leadership pay Wagner for its activities in Mali and still seem supportive. This might be less of an elective choice than in early 2021, given the resulting international isolation and how the departure of other foreign military forces has made Bamako dependent on Wagner. Without Wagner, the Malian armed forces lack the punch to challenge insurgent control. In any case, at least according to Wagner sources, the Malians are asking the Russian PMC to do more, particularly in terms of expanding its training effort and air force capabilities. In part also thanks to regime control over the media and to the powerful propaganda machine set up by Wagner, the population of Bamako and of some other cities also appears to be mostly supportive of Wagner’s presence and of its role, as even local critics of the government tend to acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In rural areas, the picture is much more mixed. In areas directly affected by Wagner’s operations there is strong resentment against its ruthless approach and its penchant for violence. This is particularly the case for Fulani communities in central Mali, which have been targeted because many of their younger members have joined jihadist groups. Especially in the early months of the group’s deployment, when Wagner forces were often deploying alone and lacked adequate local intelligence or often even interpreters, their policy of executing suspects wreaked havoc. Even sections of the local Fulani population who used to oppose the jihadists have been alienated by the looting and arrogant behaviour of Wagner forces and associated militias, according to local notables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, Wagner appears to be very unpopular among the Tuaregs in the north as well, given its role in bringing the war back to the region and in destroying the June 2015 agreement with the Tuareg rebels (which was finally abrogated by Bamako in January).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the Malian armed forces, the tactical units that share operating space with Wagner units often experience friction with them, not least because Wagner operates under a separate chain of command (it is under the National State Security Agency) and the two chains appear to be poorly coordinated. In extreme cases, there have even been episodes of violence, typically ending in injuries and loss of life among Malian soldiers. There have been frequent accusations of racism levelled against Wagner fighters from the ranks of the Malian armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Malian regime is clearly unconcerned about popular support in remote areas and appears to believe that the way forward lies in increasing its coercive capabilities&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, Wagner forces started being accompanied by Malian armed forces units, often special forces; by various local militias, in particular the Donzo, who mostly operate as scouts; or by defectors from armed groups associated with the JNIM. While some sources report that the presence of the Malian army has a mitigating impact on the behaviour of Wagner mercenaries, the same is not true of the militias. Much of the violence perpetrated by Wagner forces appears to be driven by the Donzo militias, which have rivalries with local communities – typically Fulani, who have signed “survival pacts” with the insurgents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the friction, local sources say that Wagner forces, which typically operate in groups of around 50, share many of the same attitudes towards counterinsurgency operations as the Malian armed forces. Neither believe in soft or population-centric approaches, even if Wagner forces are remarkably more violent towards the civilian population than the Malian army is. Prisoners and locals are coerced into cooperating with Wagner and its pro-government allies, yielding information and even being forced to lead them towards insurgent hideouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Wagner’s modus operandi aligns more closely (although not perfectly) with that of the Malian armed forces than the French or MINUSMA, it is clear even to the Malian authorities that as it stands the Russian PMC will not decisively defeat the insurgents. Wagner is training the Malian special forces, but that will hardly be enough to lead to a major expansion in Malian capabilities. The Malian regime is clearly unconcerned about popular support in remote areas and appears to believe that the way forward lies in increasing its coercive capabilities – hence the desire for a more powerful air force and for expanded training of its ground forces, as mentioned above. Perhaps securing “useful Mali” (cities, roads, mines) is what Bamako is prioritising right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main risk to Wagner’s position in Mali has paradoxically appeared to emanate (for a period at least) from the Russian government itself, with considerable turmoil for months after Prigozhin’s death. As of February 2024, the Wagner presence in Mali had been halved to about 1,000 men, and sources within the PMC say that it is unable to meet the Malian regime’s request for additional assistance. This appears to be mainly a result of Wagner’s difficulties in retaining and replacing staff (many left the company after Prigozhin’s death), which might in turn be due at least in part to the Russian government’s lack of desire for Wagner to grow again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some months of friction, an agreement appears to have been reached whereby Wagner operates under the control of the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD), according to sources within Wagner. Under the deal, the MoD no longer charges Wagner for the rented vehicles and air fleet deployed to Mali or for ammunition. Nonetheless, it is not clear how stable this deal is, given the bad blood between the two entities. The Russian authorities reportedly still want to replace Wagner with Redut PMC, but negotiations over this have been sluggish. For now at least, the MoD is accepting a continuing role for a diminished Wagner Group, especially in combat operations, while looking for ways to replace it with Wagner’s competitor Redut or even direct assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（27日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第53日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。李稱在「對華政策跨國議會聯盟（IPAC）」成立之後，他與另一名被告陳梓華曾討論應否繼續留在 IPAC 幫忙，因李可以透過 IPAC 接觸不同外國政客，有利於建立人際網絡作游說工作；李亦考慮過會否任職美國非政府組織「中國人權」。後來李決定留在香港協助「重光團隊（SWHK）」的工作。庭上展示李宇軒、IPAC 創辦人兼執行總監裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）及其他 SWHK 成員的 Telegram 群組，當中討論到如何回應北京決定訂立《港區國安法》，李曾提出馬格尼茨基人權問責法（Magnitsky Act），即個人層面的制裁或經濟制裁某國家，似乎是最有力的措施。惟裴倫德則指馬格尼茨基法立法過程緩慢、證據門檻高，以及在歐盟成員國等地區不能達成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第十天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指ipac聯盟成員關心與中國議題&quot;&gt;李宇軒指IPAC聯盟成員關心與中國議題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」（Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China，簡稱 IPAC），李宇軒指它裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）是創辦人之一，而聯盟成員均關心與中國有關的議題。李表示他以義工形式協助 IPAC，包括替 IPAC 開設和編輯網站，及協助聯繫日本議員如山尾志櫻里（本名「菅野志桜里」）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱除了裴倫德之外，IPAC 中央秘書處成員 Sam Armstrong 和 Andrew Lawrence，以及另一名來自 Henry Jackson Society 的人士也會提供資料，以供李發布於 IPAC 網站。控方展示 IPAC 網站發布的文章〈Statement from Simon O’Connor MP and Louisa Wall MP〉和〈The Bear in the Room〉。李確認他有份協助發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示李與裴倫德之間的訊息，在 IPAC 正式公布成立之前，李問裴倫德是否需要香港傳媒的協助（“For media, do you need support at HK side”）；裴倫德則表示需要，而且他剛剛向黎智英作簡介，稍後會將新聞稿交給李（“Yes. I’m just briefing Jimmy L. Will give you press release”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指根據訊息紀錄，當中裴倫德提及上載了 IPAC 成立的宣傳影片，可見 IPAC 的成立日期是2020年6月5日。李確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒曾與陳梓華討論透過ipac建立網絡-有利游說工作&quot;&gt;李宇軒：曾與陳梓華討論透過IPAC建立網絡 有利游說工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示他有將 IPAC 的工作告訴另一名被告陳梓華（網名T），由於 IPAC 未正式公佈成立之前，裴倫德要求李保密，所以李當時只向陳暗示過，但沒有談及細節。直至 IPAC 成立之後，李有告訴陳 IPAC 已正式成立，故此陳會知道李有份協助。李轉述陳當時的回應大概是「Good job」、「加油咁上下啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李為何會將 IPAC 的事告訴陳。李指當時會向陳談及有關香港的活動，例如「做緊啲咩」、「香港咩環境」等，「係一啲 general 嘅 conversation 嚟嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPAC 成立之後，李稱他有繼續與陳梓華討論，當時「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）已經在不同國家嘗試接觸不同政客，作游說工作。而他們看過聯盟成員名單之後，發現名單上大部份都是他們想接觸的政客，甚至還有更多人。李當時認為，既然他可以直接接觸到裴倫德，意味著他可以透過裴倫德接觸到名單上的政客，「如果我可以 develop 到呢啲 connection 嘅話，international lobby 就會 effective 好多喇」，結論是他可以繼續在 IPAC 幫手，「啫係佢（IPAC 工作）同我嘅 international lobbying 冇衝突，反而仲會更加 efficient。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒曾考慮是否參與ipac中央秘書處工作-憂予人印象香港人搶咪&quot;&gt;李宇軒：曾考慮是否參與IPAC中央秘書處工作 憂予人印象「香港人搶咪」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至2020年6至7月，李稱他曾與陳梓華、裴倫德和 SWHK 團隊之間有一系列的討論，關於李應否以個人身份加入 IPAC 的中央秘書處，協助資訊科技或其他崗位。一方面有人擔心此舉會否使李的身份曝光，或者令李備受外界關注，而且擔心「畀人一個 undeserved 嘅感覺，啫係好似一個香港人搶咪咁」，若果他當時未知 IPAC 的運作的話，「無端端一個香港人嚟，好似搶咪、搶光環咁，反而對成個 movement 仲衰。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，他們亦考慮過李應否以 SWHK 的身份參與 IPAC，可是不論是 SWHK 一方還是 IPAC 一方均有擔憂。SWHK 需要考慮是否在這個時候引人注目（rise profile）、會否引致不必要的風險，而加入 IPAC 是否 SWHK 想走的方向，以及是否所有成員都同意此做法。至於 IPAC 一方，李透過裴倫德得悉有 IPAC 聯盟成員反對 SWHK 加入聯盟，因為這違反 IPAC 避免有其他聯繫的原則。李又提到初時有很多社運組織和游說組織想加入 IPAC，但是裴倫德基於上述原則而一一拒絕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱他與陳梓華亦有就此討論，而陳不反對李以 SWHK 的身份參與 IPAC，因衡量過李的個人作風和方向，直到他被警方拘捕的時候，討論仍在進行中，未有結論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示裴倫德於2020年6月傳送給李宇軒的訊息：「攬炒團隊正式加入『國際聯軍』IPAC」，李確認 SWHK 後來有加入 IPAC 的中央秘書處，惟不是所有成員都同意 SWHK 的中文名稱是「攬炒團隊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒曾考慮任職美國非政府組織-但最後決定留在swhk幫忙&quot;&gt;李宇軒：曾考慮任職美國非政府組織 但最後決定留在SWHK幫忙&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李另提到，有見《國安法》即將立法，他與陳梓華曾討論過應該留在香港，還是到外國工作。另一名身處美國的 SWHK 成員 Shirley Ho 問李會否想去美國非政府組織「中國人權」工作，做執行主任譚競嫦（Sharon Hom）的下屬，或者形勢許可的話，李可以留在香港，但繼續任職「中國人權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱他當時考慮，如果他決定任職「中國人權」和做譚競嫦的下屬，需為時2年，與此同時，他可以在工餘時間做有關香港社運的活動，所以他當時正在 SWHK、IPAC 和「中國人權」之間考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李憶述，陳梓華當時認為任職「中國人權」並非有效地運用時間，所以二人均不傾向李任職「中國人權」，改為決定留在 SWHK 幫忙。二人亦傾向認為李應該到英國協助裴倫德，可能擔任 IPAC 某些職位或者協助其他英國的非政府組織。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，最後在這個時候，SWHK 已經決定加入 IPAC，而不是李以個人身份加入 IPAC。李則一直留在香港協助 SWHK 事務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;重光團隊與ipac開設群組交流-李宇軒分析指北京搏外國不會制裁&quot;&gt;重光團隊與IPAC開設群組交流 李宇軒分析指北京搏外國不會制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示 Telegram 群組「SWHK IPAC」訊息紀錄，群組成員包括李宇軒（網名「RIP@?」）、裴倫德、Shirley Ho 和「攬炒巴」劉祖廸（網名「HK 再離開一下」）等。群組於2020年6月21日成立，李在開首訊息指，此群組的作用是與 IPAC 協調有關香港的聲明和回應，主要是近期的《國安法》議題。他又指如果 IPAC 沒有發表聲明的話，SWHK 可以出聲明以填補空白（fill the gap）；但如果 IPAC 打算出聲明的話，SWHK 不會與之重疊，而轉為在社交媒體分享或轉載 IPAC 的聲明，使曝光率推至最高（maximize coverage）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;裴倫德問及發表聲明的最佳時機。李宇軒則分析指聲明目標有兩個效果，其一是國際向北京施壓，使北京放棄訂立《港區國安法》，其二是他們容讓《國安法》通過立法，之後以負面角度定性《國安法》，迫使香港或國際社會更加反抗中國，而發表聲明的時機則視乎他們想達至以上哪一種效果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又在群組中表示，他的判斷是北京想證實國際社會並不會真的實施制裁或強硬政策，似乎北京會發表外交聲明，聲稱卑躬屈膝的話便可得到經濟利益，之後外國政府便會讓步，北京從而可以避免承擔後果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;裴倫德在群組中指-ipac-成員在議會權力有限&quot;&gt;裴倫德在群組中指 IPAC 成員在議會權力有限&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;裴倫德則在群組中指，他不希望作出不切實際的承諾，英國議員的權力有限，而 IPAC 的威脅需要是可行的，否則北京不會害怕任何人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒回應指，「市面上」已經有很多譴責中國的聲明，包括外國政要、外交大臣等，而 IPAC 則有一群議員，似乎有一個合適位置向中國聲稱，「如果你做了某些事的話，我們便會在議會上提交政策議案進行討論」，因為這是議員的職能範圍之內。之後裴倫德指李似乎誤解了 IPAC 政客有能力提交政策議案，但事實上他們作為「後座議員」權力有限。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒庭上解釋，他認為如果 IPAC 的成員可以在各自國家的議會提交政策議案討論的話，便會更加有效，但裴倫德指他有誤解，因 IPAC 的成員職能上可以動議法案（propose bills），但不可以提出討論政策議案（table policies）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;群組中提出馬格尼茨基法-李宇軒自己沒有想法旨在引起討論&quot;&gt;群組中提出馬格尼茨基法 李宇軒：自己沒有想法、旨在引起討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;裴倫德在群組中表示，他認為 IPAC 應該發表聲明之餘，輔以一項實質行動。惟李宇軒卻認為已經有很多譴責中國的聲明，應該集中在特定行動。裴倫德問李認為 IPAC 就香港議題做什麼是最有力，又提到有 IPAC 成員不喜歡「救生艇計劃」，因認為它代表「承認被打敗」。李亦表示不喜歡「救生艇計劃」，他無意推動一項放棄香港的政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李其後提到，馬格尼茨基人權問責法（Magnitsky Act），即個人層面的制裁或經濟制裁某國家，似乎是最有力的措施，而且當英國議員集齊足夠簽署提出動議，便不是不可能達成。李又提到，日本議員山尾志櫻里曾經在一次線上會面提出馬格尼茨基法（Magnitsky Act），他認為如果可以說服日本通過馬格尼茨基法，便可以與國際配合一同實施。惟裴倫德指馬格尼茨基法立法過程緩慢、證據門檻高，以及在某一些地區不能達成，例如歐盟成員國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒庭上解釋，當時他在群組中提及馬格尼茨基法，只是想提出一些想法，希望引起其他人討論，而他並沒有主張自己的想法。法官李運騰問，李的意思是否他提出一些不成熟的想法，想其他人一起討論。李確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於控方問及山尾志櫻里何時提及馬格尼茨基法，李則表示不肯定山尾在哪一次線上會議中談論過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李在群組中提到另一個選項，就是要求取消香港特殊地位，但他認為這與「救生艇計劃」沒有分別，都是放棄自己所屬的城市。他又指 IPAC 並不會主張香港獨立，也不會叫其他國家承認香港作為一個獨立國家，因他理解這在外交層面是不切實際。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past five years, the G7 and its member states have made significant progress in specifying ethical principles for AI. Advancing global AI governance in 2024 demands translating these high-level principles into concrete practices for AI developers and government organizations. Rather than address this challenge in isolation, G7 leaders stated in their 2023 Leaders’ Communiqué they would work together and with others to “advance international discussions on inclusive artificial intelligence (AI) governance and interoperability to achieve our common vision and goal of trustworthy AI, in line with our shared democratic values.” The March 2024 Industry, Technology and Digital Ministerial declaration recently reaffirmed this commitment, stressing “the importance of international discussions on AI governance and interoperability” with like-minded partners and developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the G7 has already had a tangible impact in productively shaping the domestic AI regulatory approach of multiple G7 members, including the United States (through the 2023 AI executive order), Japan (the updated AI regulatory guidance), and the European Union (the AI Act). In conversations with CSIS, government officials from each of these members stated that the G7 was substantive and helpful to their regulatory efforts. Notably, members of the European Parliament involved in drafting the EU AI Act told CSIS that some sections of the act were directly inspired by the Hiroshima AI Process (HAIP) Code of Conduct the G7 published in October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such section of the EU AI Act is Article 52, which outlines transparency obligations for Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) models above a computational threshold of 1025 floating point operations per second (FLOPS). According to Article 52, the European Union’s AI Office shall “encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union level as an element to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking into account international approaches.” Industry developers are directed to coregulate these codes of practice by collaborating directly with the European Commission on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the European Parliament told CSIS they believe the HAIP Code of Conduct is the best available starting point for what will ultimately become the EU AI Office’s officially recognized codes of practice for certain GPAI models. Parliament members stated their support for maturing the G7’s code of conduct to a degree that meets EU requirements, such that providers of GPAI models who demonstrate compliance with the G7’s HAIP Code of Conduct would enjoy a “presumption of conformity” to the EU AI Act’s GPAI codes of practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union, while it has the sole final decision over the AI Act’s implementation, should be commended for its demonstrated commitment to interoperability, openness to international input during the codes of practice design process, and willingness to take advantage of the work already done under the Japanese 2023 G7 presidency. Maturing the code of conduct to confer a presumption of conformity to the EU AI Act would not only help the European Commission develop a key piece of regulation for GPAI models but also offer an opportunity for other G7 members to help shape language that will set an informative precedent for how global AI regulations are designed and implemented. Moreover, aligning the code of conduct to the European Union’s codes of practice would be hugely impactful for the G7’s stated goals of establishing interoperable AI regulations and broadening the dissemination of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the European Commission does not ultimately use the code of conduct to inform or stand in for the European Union’s official codes of practice, the G7 would still achieve a substantially more mature code by aiming to meet this ambitious goal. In its current state, the code of conduct’s 11 high-level principles are too vague for AI developers to subscribe to or implement without further specification. Translating these principles into monitorable and enforceable tasks for AI developers would therefore be a meaningful achievement alone. This process will require extensive input from the private sector to determine what is relevant, technically feasible, and reflective of existing industry best practices in AI governance. Cooperation with and public endorsement from a diverse group of leading international AI firms will also be needed to help to demonstrate the code’s building momentum within the AI industry. While maturing the code of conduct through these avenues and more would already fulfil one of the G7’s stated priorities for 2024, the G7 could go further by aligning the code of conduct with the European Union’s codes of practice to achieve its broader goals of enhancing regulatory interoperability and widening the adoption of the code of conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;Timeline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expected timeline for EU AI Act implementation suggests that a draft version of the GPAI codes of practice must be ready by February 2025 (see Figure 1). Comparing the EU and G7 timelines highlights that the G7 code of conduct should be substantially elaborated by February 2025 if the European Union is to consider the code of conduct as a presumption of conformity to the European Union’s code of practice on GPAI models when the regulations take effect. This gives the G7 approximately 11 months from the writing of this white paper to mature the code of conduct ahead of the European Union’s February 2025 deadline. While the HAIP Code of Conduct could inform a later, updated EU AI codes of practice, meeting the February 2025 deadline would certainly have greater impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Expected EU AI Act Implementation Time Frame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Italian G7 presidency therefore comes at a critical window of opportunity to substantially advance the HAIP and the interoperability of allied AI regulatory frameworks. The Italian presidency recently restated the G7’s commitment to maturing the HAIP and the code of conduct at the Industry, Technology, and Digital Ministerial Meeting in Verona and Trento on March 14 and 15, 2024. The ministerial declaration from this meeting promises to advance the HAIP outcomes on page 10, “including through expanding support and awareness among key partners and organisations, as well as increasing their involvement, as appropriate.” Specifically, per Annex 3, the G7 will develop monitoring mechanisms for assessing organizations’ voluntary implementation of the code of conduct, increase stakeholder engagement in maturing the code of conduct and its adoption, and collaborate with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), UNESCO, and GPAI on challenges posed by AI systems. Progress on these issues will be presented at the leaders’ summit in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the G7’s 2024 agenda for the HAIP and the European Commission’s deadline of February 2025 for developing the GPAI codes of practice, the Italian G7 presidency should strive to accomplish the following this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue working on the HAIP Code of Conduct after the March 15 ministerial meeting, including a second digital and industry ministerial meeting toward the end of 2024.&lt;/strong&gt; Developing the code of conduct will take substantive effort from both G7 members and AI developers in the private sector and academia. CSIS supports the Italian presidency’s year-round approach to maturing the HAIP ending, with a second ministerial meeting showcasing the G7’s work toward the end of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop the HAIP Code of Conduct’s monitoring and evaluation mechanisms through the OECD.&lt;/strong&gt; While the G7 has done excellent work on advancing AI governance principles thus far, its lack of permanent staff makes it challenging to continue this work alone in the long-term. The March Industry, Technology, and Digital Ministerial declaration indicates that the OECD will provide this missing institutional support to the G7 on the Hiroshima AI Process, continuing a long-standing partnership between the two fora.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The OECD has a strong record of developing monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, which the G7 should draw on to meaningfully mature the code of conduct in 2024. Japan chairs this year’s OECD’s Ministerial Council, offering continuity between the G7 Hiroshima Process, which Japanese government officials continue to staff and support, and the OECD. Developing the code of conduct through the Ministerial Council and other OECD channels, including the Global Partnership on AI, will offer essential capacity and expertise to the 2024 G7.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Close collaboration with the OECD would also offer a longer-term path to expand the HAIP beyond the G7, first to like-minded democratic market-driven economies among the OECD countries. The OECD could also serve as a first step in further expansion to a wider set of non-OECD countries through the OECD-hosted Global Partnership on AI, which includes countries such as Brazil and India.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gather input from private sector AI organizations on the code of conduct through requests for comment and formalized convenings of relevant stakeholders.&lt;/strong&gt; In a speech to the Italian government’s Digital Transition Committee in November 2023, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni stated that establishing AI governance guidelines “does not mean working against companies” but instead “engaging in dialogue” between the public and private sector. Dialogue between relevant stakeholders is indeed essential for ensuring the code of conduct is translated into specific actions that are technically feasible and reflect the rapidly changing capabilities of advanced AI systems. To ensure that this dialogue remains consistent and constructive, input from private sector AI developers should be organized through specific initiatives such as requests for comment, working groups, and feasibility studies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these recommendation in place, CSIS hopes the following occur by the end of the Italian G7 presidency:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;G7 members and EU AI Act officials expand, finalize, and accept the HAIP Code of Conduct language.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A substantial number of companies support the drafting of and publicly subscribe to the code of conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The OECD serves as the principal forum in which to develop monitoring and transparency functions of the code of conduct as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By late 2024 or early 2025, there is a clear path to expanding the code of conduct beyond the G7 and OECD forums, including non-G7 and OECD countries potentially through the OECD’s Global Partnership on AI forum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean actors have stolen billions of dollars over the past decade as part of a massive campaign to generate illicit revenue through cybercrime. In recent years, they have devoted particular effort to stealing virtual assets. The proceeds of these operations help fund the Kim regime’s ballistic missile programme and the development of more robust cyber capabilities, among other initiatives. North Korea’s cyber-criminal activities undermine UN sanctions and represent a distinct threat to international security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A US-led coalition has responded to North Korea’s exploitation of cryptocurrency by prioritising enforcement against the virtual asset platforms that facilitate money laundering, especially mixing services. Mixers enable users to obfuscate the origins of their cryptocurrency funds by commingling them in a large pool with other users’ assets. Recognising the key role non-compliant mixers such as Tornado Cash have played in North Korea’s cyber-criminal enterprise, US authorities and international partners have launched an aggressive crackdown. Authorities have supplemented their primary enforcement tools – sanctions and platform takedowns – with asset seizures, arrests and the adoption of new laws and regulatory measures. Over the past few months, governments have experimented with novel approaches to combating digital illicit finance, such as the possibility of designating all mixer transactions as suspicious by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper forms part of a series of research projects funded by the US Department of State to understand and mitigate obstacles to UN sanctions implementation. It aims to examine cryptocurrency mixers’ distinct technical, legal and regulatory dimensions and the challenges they pose to the sanctions regime. The paper provides detailed background information on North Korea’s cyber-criminal statecraft, focusing on North Korean actors’ use of mixers to launder illicitly obtained cryptocurrency. It takes stock of the government response to date, concluding that while actions against non-compliant virtual asset platforms have been effective individually, the campaign’s overall impact on North Korea’s laundering capacity has been limited. It also seeks to grapple with the unintended consequences of interventions, some of which have yet to manifest fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper offers 14 recommendations for policymakers and practitioners. The first cluster includes suggestions for broadening the current approach to countering North Korean mixer exploitation through unconventional partnerships and new conceptual frameworks. It advocates for empowering the disparate teams fighting cross-cutting North Korean cyber threats to collaborate more closely, and for expanding consideration of the second- and third-order marketplace effects enforcement actions may trigger. The next cluster focuses on cultivating stronger cooperative relations with the private sector. These recommendations emphasise nurturing the development of compliant blockchain privacy alternatives and tailoring government communications to the idiosyncratic virtual asset industry audience. The final cluster of recommendations focuses on raising global cyber security and anti-money laundering and counterterrorist finance standards. Achieving wider implementation of current best practices, with an eye toward augmenting them in light of emerging digital illicit finance risks, would substantially degrade North Korea’s ability to monetise cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s innovative and highly motivated e-crime groups have emerged over the past decade as among the world’s most prolific cyber-criminals. Under the direction of the Kim regime, North Korean actors have pioneered a unique model that combines their technical acumen with the state’s experience in conducting illicit financial activities, honed over more than half a century, to cultivate a potent new revenue stream. The results speak for themselves. North Korea has stolen billions of dollars through electronic means from victims around the globe, including more than $3 billion in cryptocurrency. In 2022, North Korean groups accounted for roughly half of the nearly $4 billion stolen across the virtual asset ecosystem and a large portion of the funds taken from decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols, which have quickly become crypto hackers’ primary target. Following each theft, North Korean cyber-criminals steer their ill-gotten gains through a sophisticated laundering process and ultimately into state coffers. The profits from these operations fund much of Pyongyang’s ballistic missile programme, enable deeper investment in its cyber capabilities, bankroll slush funds for the North Korean elite, and help insulate the regime from the effects of sanctions. Through their direct and indirect effects, North Korea’s ongoing cyber-criminal activities pose an acute threat to international security and the global financial system. This paper explores North Korea’s use of these novel technologies to evade sanctions, considers the efficacy of states’ countermeasures, and provides recommendations on how authorities can further impede North Korea’s illicit cyber revenue-generating activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency mixers play a key role in the laundering process underpinning the North Korean cyber-criminal model. Mixing services, also known as tumblers, obfuscate the provenance and ownership of cryptocurrency funds by blending many users’ holdings together and disbursing each customer’s “mixed” funds to new addresses under their control. By obscuring the otherwise transparent trail of blockchain transactions, mixers make it harder for victims and law enforcement to trace stolen assets, let alone recover them, and help convert dirty cryptocurrency into more usable funds. Recognising these advantages, North Korean actors have enthusiastically incorporated mixers into their repertoire. Their heavy use of mixers presents both a problem and an opportunity: while these technologies protect a crucial revenue stream, North Korea’s reliance on mixers creates vulnerability to interventions that could significantly degrade their ability to monetise crypto theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US-led approach to countering North Korean mixer use is still taking shape. Thus far, the toolkit has mainly featured sanctions, platform takedowns, asset seizures, arrests and regulation, which authorities typically deploy simultaneously and in coordination with international partners. These tactics have proven effective across several cases, rendering certain major platforms much less functional and removing others from availability outright. All told, the ongoing campaign has reshaped key elements of the mixer landscape, and large recent asset seizures have generated a cautious optimism that law enforcement and private partners may be building their capacity to reclaim stolen funds. However, the strategic impact of these interventions on North Korea’s overall illicit finance capabilities is ambiguous, and even the successful platform takedowns may not prove to be enduring achievements. Moreover, the interventions have already triggered unintended consequences, the full scope of which remains to be seen. New platforms are emerging to fill the void predecessors have left, and the replacements may ultimately prove trickier to counter. The interventions have prompted cyber-criminals to adapt their operational procedures and spurred innovation by both legitimate and illicit market actors that promises to catalyse further change. The tough approach to mixers has also exacerbated divisions between the public and private sectors over the character and trajectory of the virtual asset space, undermining efforts to make it less hospitable to criminality. As the strategy for countering North Korean illicit digital finance continues to develop, authorities will need to reckon carefully with the second-order effects of their actions and continually refine their approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper forms part of a series of research projects funded by the US Department of State to understand and mitigate obstacles to UN sanctions implementation. It aims to examine the distinct technical, legal and regulatory dimensions of cryptocurrency mixers and the challenges they pose to the sanctions regime. The paper concludes a four-month research project, commencing in June 2023 and ending in September 2023, on the use of cryptocurrency mixers for illicit financial purposes by North Korean actors. The analysis is based on a close review of US government documents, such as indictments, sanctions designations, statements of policy and press releases; reports by the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea (“the Panel”); publicly available threat intelligence and blockchain analysis reporting from firms such as BAE Systems, Chainalysis, Elliptic and TRM Labs; and primary data that certain firms have collected on North Korean cyber operations and cryptocurrency transactions. The paper has also benefited from interviews with 16 experts in relevant fields, including compliance specialists, anti-money laundering and counterterrorist finance (AML/CTF) practitioners, leading figures in the cryptocurrency industry, threat intelligence and blockchain analysts, policy researchers, and multiple former senior officials from the US Department of the Treasury, the US Department of Justice and the National Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper contains three chapters. Chapter I offers background on Pyongyang’s cybercrime programme, the factors that draw cyber-criminals to mixers and the countermeasures governments have started taking. Chapter II analyses government interventions to date, focusing on the Blender, Tornado Cash, ChipMixer and Sinbad actions. It identifies unintended consequences that government action may trigger and suggests possible strategies for mitigating them. Chapter III offers a series of policy recommendations for augmenting the current approach to countering North Korean mixers, building stronger cooperative relations with the private sector, and raising global cyber security and AML/CTF standards. The paper concludes by flagging areas for further research and reflecting on how this issue could evolve in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-background&quot;&gt;I. Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides background information on North Korea’s cyber-criminal activities and explains why mixers have become appealing tools for money laundering. It also outlines the measures governments and international bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) have undertaken in response to virtual asset crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-north-korean-cybercrime-programme&quot;&gt;The North Korean Cybercrime Programme&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cybercrime has quickly become an essential pillar of North Korean statecraft. In the mid-2010s, having already developed a capacity for destructive and espionage cyber activities, Pyongyang launched a global campaign of financially motivated intrusions whose early results prefigured an enormous return on investment. The 2016 Bank of Bangladesh heist, in which threat actors submitted fraudulent SWIFT requests to the bank’s accounts at the New York Federal Reserve, extracted more than $80 million and might have yielded 10 times more if not for a typo in the phoney wire instructions that exposed the ruse. In May 2017, the WannaCry ransomware affected several hundred thousand machines in at least 150 countries, demonstrating the ease with which hackers cloistered untouchably in faraway jurisdictions could commit digital extortion at massive scale. These and subsequent operations validated the idea that state-directed computer crime could pay quite handsomely. Over the past decade, North Korea has assembled a web of interlocking threat actor sets whose primary or secondary aims are to generate revenue, including the groups known as APT38, Andariel and the Lazarus Group, some of the world’s most active and successful e-crime syndicates. Their combined operations have generated several billion dollars for the Kim regime. That North Korea’s annual foreign trade volume, long its chief source of hard currency, has not surpassed $3 billion since 2019 underscores the impact of this new revenue stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among national cyber strategies, Pyongyang’s is unique. North Korea was likely the first country to generate illicit revenue via cybercrime, and to the extent that any other countries have experimented with cyber-criminal statecraft, North Korea remains by far its largest practitioner. Its threat actors have benefited from robust ties to the global underground, from hacker forums and off-the-shelf malware vendors to high-level network access brokers and transnational money laundering networks. North Korea’s repertoire comprises a wide range of activities typically associated with non-state criminals rather than state actors. Of these, theft from major enterprises is the most profitable, but by no means the only, core element. North Korean threat actors have launched ransomware campaigns, solicited fraudulent investments, hijacked other users’ processing power to mine cryptocurrency, stolen customer payment information from e-commerce websites, and programmed ATMs to dispense cash for collection by networks of money mules, among other pursuits. Capitalising on the prevalence of remote work and outsourcing since the Covid-19 pandemic, North Korea has steered many of its skilled programmers into freelance IT work, performing services such as web development and database creation for foreign companies under false identities – activities that would be legal if not for sanctions. The thousands of workers engaging in these activities, many of whom operate from Russia or China, cumulatively bring in millions of dollars per year. In addition to generating income, they may enable future compromises by planting malware in company systems or gathering data to inform social engineering schemes that involve deception of unsuspecting employees. Lesser North Korean cyber-criminals engage in petty e-crime, such as online gaming and casino scams, which are not lucrative individually but scale easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characteristics that distinguish virtual assets make them attractive targets for criminal exploitation. Having surpassed the trillion-dollar market capitalisation threshold in 2021 and remained near or above it since, the cryptocurrency space is awash with cash, the critical factor for opportunistic cyber-criminals, who follow the money above all. Market actors have often prioritised breakneck innovation and user growth at the expense of due attention to compliance and cyber security, leaving large pots of assets under-protected against highly motivated thieves. Users and investors drawn to the prospect of fast and high returns frequently exercise insufficient care in guarding against scammers. Criminals looking to fly under the radar benefit from the space’s emphasis on privacy and, in many circles, its scepticism or outright antagonism toward regulatory authorities and traditional compliance practices perceived as intrusive or burdensome. Instantaneous, borderless transactions enable malign actors to quickly abscond with ill-gotten funds, while decentralisation enables buck-passing with respect to compliance, investigation and victim support. The rapid rise of DeFi and the advances in decentralisation, speed and automation it heralds have increased virtual assets’ appeal to North Korean cyber-criminals in particular. As the US Department of the Treasury assessed in April 2023, “many existing DeFi services covered by the BSA [Bank Secrecy Act] fail to comply with AML/CFT obligations, a vulnerability that illicit actors exploit”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;embracing-mixers&quot;&gt;Embracing Mixers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixers enable North Korean cyber-criminals to launder dirty cryptocurrency with increased speed and anonymity by blending their holdings together with those of many other users. Traditional mixers operate a custodial model, commingling user deposits in a large pool and then returning “clean” funds to their original owners, less a small fee. Relying on a central operator, however, presents counterparty risk and creates opportunities for compromise or law enforcement interdiction, as cases such as the ChipMixer seizure have demonstrated. To solve these problems, some newer mixers employ a non-custodial approach, in which smart contracts – blockchain-based programs that execute automatically when given conditions are met – tumble users’ holdings without ever placing them under a central operator’s control. Non-custodial mixers such as Tornado Cash offer enhanced security, reduce platform administrators’ direct involvement in daily operations, and greatly diminish the possibility of unauthorised asset seizure. While there are plenty of legitimate reasons for law-abiding cryptocurrency owners to wish to use these sorts of privacy tools, most mixers practise minimal compliance, if any, and many were designed explicitly to facilitate illegal transactions. As Chainalysis noted in a mid-2022 review of mixing services’ regulatory obligations, “We aren’t aware of any custodial mixers currently following [US compliance] rules”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jPaSjv9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 1: Life Cycle of a Sample North Korean Mixer Transaction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean cyber-criminals have embraced using mixers to launder stolen funds, which now represents a core component of North Korea’s cryptocurrency theft protocols. According to Chainalysis, the percentage of ill-gotten North Korean cryptocurrency that flowed through mixing services grew from under 10% in 2018 to 65% in 2021. North Korean actors laundered more than $1 billion from at least 10 separate operations through Tornado Cash alone prior to the mixer’s designation in August 2022, including from the January 2022 Qubit hack and the June 2022 Horizon Bridge hack. They processed $20 million from the massive March 2022 Axie Infinity hack through Blender and several tens of millions from the aforementioned operations and others, like the September 2020 KuCoin heist, through ChipMixer. In 2023, North Korean cyber-criminals turned to alternative platforms, whisking funds from the Atomic Wallet hack through a new Bitcoin mixer called Sinbad and more than $60 million of Ethereum from Horizon Bridge through the Railgun privacy protocol. Employing a variety of mixers distributes risk across multiple platforms, but also reflects the need to replace services that have shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most illicit actors use mixers in similar fashion – after all, the point is to blend in with the crowd – but certain characteristics mark North Korea’s use. For one, North Korean actors are among the largest mixer users in the world, accounting for 30% of the funds that sanctioned entities tumbled in 2022, behind only the Hydra darknet marketplace. They appear more inclined toward using mixers than most other cryptocurrency thieves, as less than 20% of the proceeds of non-North Korean cryptocurrency hacks flowed through mixers in 2022. According to Elliptic, illicit North Korean funds comprised 70% of Railgun’s total receipts as of early 2023. In practice, North Korean cyber-criminals have fewer mixer options to choose from than less prolific outfits. As a general rule, the larger a mixer’s pool of assets and users, the stronger the anonymity it can provide; conversely, investigators are generally better able to trace dirty assets through a tumbling protocol with lower volume. Only a handful of platforms can accommodate tens of millions of dollars in North Korean-controlled cryptocurrency in one shot without becoming useless, and authorities can even “de-mix” transactions through certain larger platforms. North Korean launderers often add further layers of obfuscation by employing multiple mixers and bridging funds across blockchains, a practice known as chain-hopping. Of course, the end uses of North Korean virtual asset crime – supporting the regime’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, among other purposes – distinguish it from operations whose perpetrators seek personal profit. Nonetheless, North Korea’s money-laundering methodologies largely overlap with those of other sophisticated cyber-criminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;government-responses&quot;&gt;Government Responses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having begun formulating AML/CTF frameworks for virtual assets in the decade prior, global regulators moved in the late 2010s to account for the emergence of mixers. The FATF, the international standard-setting organisation, updated its core recommendations in October 2018 to apply to virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs), and in June 2019 it adopted an Interpretive Note to Recommendation 15 detailing how its rules should apply to that ecosystem in practice. Accompanying guidance for implementing a risk-based approach to regulating virtual assets and VASPs expressed concern at “the rise of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies (AECs), mixers and tumblers, decentralised platforms and exchanges, and other types of products and services that enable or allow for reduced transparency and increased obfuscation of financial flows”. The FATF subsequently identified mixer use as a “red flag” indicating users’ possible “intent to obscure the flow of illicit funds”. The FATF urges governments to ensure that VASPs can manage the risks associated with operating or transacting with mixers, and to ban providers that are incapable of or unwilling to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US and UK regulators have established similar frameworks. The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a pair of documents in May 2019 to clarify VASPs’ obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and to warn that “FinCEN and US law enforcement have observed unregistered entities being exploited or wittingly allowing their platforms to be utilised by criminals in the United States and abroad to further illicit activity”. The FinCEN guidance asserts explicitly that mixers fall under the purview of the BSA, building on a 2008 administrative ruling that classified anonymising services as money transmitters and on 2013 guidance concerning virtual currency use and exchange. Importantly, these determinations oblige regulable VASPs to comply with key AML policies such as the Travel Rule, which requires financial institutions to convey certain information about funds they transmit. Heeding encouragement from the FATF and calls from its own National Crime Agency to address mixers “churning criminal cash”, the British government revised its AML legislation in 2022 and implemented the Travel Rule for virtual assets in September 2023. US and UK regulators are working actively with global partners to strengthen the framework governing anonymising technologies such as mixers and to achieve more robust implementation of AML/CTF standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mixers initially appeared on law enforcement authorities’ radar as facilitators for money laundering and internet crime, rather than as vectors of North Korean national security threats. In May 2019, the Dutch financial crime agency and Europol took down BestMixer, at the time one of the three largest mixing platforms, with Europol commenting that “the investigation so far into this case shows that many of the mixed cryptocurrencies on BestMixer.io had a criminal origin or destination”. Culminating an investigation launched the previous summer, the BestMixer intervention appears to have been the first such law enforcement action. In 2020, FinCEN levied a $60 million civil penalty against the primary operator of the Helix Bitcoin mixer for wilfully and systematically violating the BSA in the course of servicing more than three dozen illicit darknet marketplaces, a few months after his indictment on federal money laundering charges. In April 2021, US authorities arrested a dual Russian–Swedish national “on criminal charges related to his alleged operation of the longest-running bitcoin money laundering service on the darknet”, the Bitcoin Fog mixer, which achieved “notoriety as a go-to money laundering service for criminals seeking to hide their illicit proceeds from law enforcement”. That summer, FinCEN assessed a $100-million penalty against BitMEX, a cryptocurrency exchange and derivative trading platform, for BSA infractions that included facilitating thousands of transactions with mixers like Helix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s brazen string of cryptocurrency hacks in 2021 and 2022, as well as the high-profile Colonial Pipeline and JBS ransomware crises of 2021 and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, prompted an evolution in how officials tend to view illicit mixer use, from a criminal tool to a direct national security threat. In October 2021, the White House launched the Counter Ransomware Initiative (CRI), bringing together dozens of governments to develop cyber-security and AML standards and to coordinate action against the perpetrators and facilitators of cyber-criminal extortion. The UK and Singapore have jointly spearheaded much of the CRI’s work on mixers, co-leading a working group on countering illicit finance in 2022 and the CRI’s policy arm in 2023. The US Department of the Treasury’s February 2022 National Money Laundering Risk Assessment, which includes a full sub-section on virtual assets and a sub-header therein on anonymity-enhancing technologies, names North Korean, Russian and Iranian threat actors as primary exploiters of those services, noting that “ransomware attacks … frequently stem from jurisdictions with elevated sanctions risk” and that “ransomware payments may … fund activities that harm US national security”. The Department’s April 2023 report, Illicit Finance Risk Assessment of Decentralized Finance, the most comprehensive government report on this topic at the time of writing, treats North Korean mixer use extensively, noting that “the DPRK … increasingly steals virtual assets from both centralized VASPs and DeFi services” and that North Korean cyber-criminals “are using DeFi services in the process of transferring and laundering their illicit proceeds”. The report offers in-depth suggestions for curtailing this activity by building regulatory capacity and expanding collaboration with foreign and private sector partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since early 2022, global authorities have dramatically ramped up efforts to disrupt North Korean illicit mixer use and experimented with new tools for doing so. The US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued its first-ever designation of a mixing service in May 2022, sanctioning Blender for obfuscating tens of millions of dollars in North Korean proceeds from the Axie Infinity heist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asked a few months later about North Korea’s cyber activities, Anne Neuberger, US Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, commented, “Given that cyber is such a core driver of revenue, it’s something we must address … We’re doubling down and planning to do much more work to make it riskier, costlier, and harder for North Korea to gain funds that way”. The US government’s most prominent mixer action to date has been its August 2022 designation of Tornado Cash, which demonstrated OFAC’s ability to target platforms without a traditional centralised operating entity while also provoking much private sector ire, including well-funded legal challenges. Undeterred, US authorities revised and expanded the Tornado Cash designation and recently indicted two of the service’s alleged operators, one of whom was arrested in Washington state. Last year, international coalitions took down ChipMixer, whose servers and nearly $50 million in cryptocurrency holdings were seized by the German Federal Criminal Police, and Sinbad, which OFAC designated in November. In a noteworthy development, in October 2023 FinCEN proposed a new rule that would classify mixing as a transaction class of primary money laundering concern and impose substantial new record-keeping and reporting requirements on domestic participants. If implemented, the proposal would represent a novel exercise of the US Department of the Treasury’s authorities under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, with which it has previously targeted only individual foreign jurisdictions and financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-analysis&quot;&gt;II. Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;evaluating-interventions-to-date&quot;&gt;Evaluating Interventions to Date&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter takes stock of the US-led campaign against virtual asset mixers through its first two years. The first portion assesses seven major interventions against platforms and considers their overall impact on North Korea’s money laundering capacity. The second portion outlines the unintended consequences that actions against mixers can trigger, and explores possible mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed through the narrow lens of impact on the target platform, government interventions against mixers facilitating North Korean money laundering have achieved success. Blender shut down shortly after its designation, removing one of North Korean cyber-criminals’ favourite options for mixing Bitcoin. Indeed, Chainalysis reports that roughly 90% of the funds North Korean actors mixed in Q2 2021 passed through Blender. ChipMixer likewise ceased operations following the Germany- and US-led intervention, and Europol anticipates that the four servers and seven terabytes of data seized in the takedown will catalyse further investigations. In the more complicated case of Tornado Cash, the OFAC designation has resulted in a transaction volume decrease of over 80% as of late 2023, shrinking the platform’s pool of mixable funds and in turn significantly degrading its effectiveness at obfuscating asset movements, especially for larger-volume users. According to Chainalysis, after the designation “Tornado Cash … saw drops in inflows from virtually every category” of sender, including funds from thieves and sanctioned entities. As a portion of the total funds North Korean cyber-criminals mixed, Tornado Cash flows declined to under 25% in Q4 2022, following four consecutive quarters of these actors’ pushing essentially all their stolen cryptocurrency through Tornado Cash at some point in the laundering process, which typically involved bridging and layering with other services. Western authorities have arrested two of Tornado Cash’s three alleged “principal” co-founders and in August 2023 unsealed a remarkably detailed indictment indicating that the men deliberately sought to create a “haven for criminals to engage in large-scale money laundering and sanctions evasion”. On an individual basis, these tactics have proven potent, removing or seriously compromising platforms North Korea has relied on to launder dirty virtual assets. Considered together, they have reshaped the cryptocurrency mixer landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/B1bRseB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Table 1: Notable Interventions Against Mixers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, in some cases governments have fallen short. Despite its reduced functionality, Tornado Cash continues to operate because it runs on smart contracts that authorities are unable to seize or shut down directly, as they could a centralised server or custodial entity. Some users, including North Korean actors, have continued engaging the platform to obscure illicit fund trails, albeit in lesser amounts. This situation reveals a major limitation on authorities’ ability to counter decentralised, smart contract-based mixers, and raises questions about whether measures against similar platforms will be effective in the future. The first action against such an entity, the Tornado Cash designation, has also suffered from a lack of clarity, which generated marketplace confusion as to the extent of the restrictions and liability for interacting, even unwittingly, with the service. These issues and the aforementioned court challenges prompted OFAC in November 2022 to de-list the platform and redesignate it under a broader justification, as well as to publish answers to market actors’ frequently asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the complexities of the Tornado Cash case, several other interventions that met the core goal of taking a malign service offline did not accomplish secondary goals such as arrests or property seizures. The operators of ChipMixer and Blender remain at large, and reports indicate that the administrator of the latter may have absconded with as much as $22 million in Bitcoin and remains involved in operating dirty mixers. While multimillion dollar virtual asset seizures impose heavy costs on criminals and may help compensate their victims, few have accounted for more than a small fraction of the total amount the illicit actors in question are known to have processed or taken in profits. These shortcomings should not take away from the altogether impressive results that government interventions have achieved against mixing platforms themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/L8pIIu0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Table 2: Tactical Outcomes of Notable Interventions Against Mixers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate strategic outcome of authorities’ campaign to disrupt North Korean revenue streams by pursuing dirty mixers remains to be seen, but initial indications have been somewhat discouraging. Every intervention so far has achieved degradation of the target platform, only for replacements or reincarnations to quickly absorb much of its transaction volume. A prominent blockchain investigator privately described the Tornado Cash designation, whose bite on the platform itself has been evident, as a “blip” for North Korean cyber-criminals, who adapted quickly by re-routing illicit asset flows through other service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elliptic reported in February 2023 that Sinbad, one of the preferred tumblers of North Korean threat actors from late 2022 until its designation last November, was very likely a relaunched version of Blender. In fact, as discussed at length in the next section, taking down a platform may prompt users to shift not just to comparable substitutes but to more powerful anonymising tools. Considering the abundant alternatives and the ease with which developers can launch a new mixer, it has become apparent that compromising individual platforms may not have an enduring effect on the mixer ecosystem’s overall capacity. It is plausible that these interventions have delayed cash-outs to North Korean actors and raised transaction costs, and authorities have managed to interdict small but non-trivial North Korean illicit fund movements. These actions have injected a degree of uncertainty into the laundering process, demonstrating that stolen funds are always vulnerable and forcing cyber-criminals to engage with platforms of unknown pedigree. Nevertheless, the campaign so far has not substantially impaired North Korea’s ability to mix cryptocurrency. With this conundrum in mind, FinCEN’s October 2023 proposal that mixing be classified as a transaction category of primary money-laundering concern is especially intriguing. Could targeting mixing transactions as a class have greater impact than going after facilitators one by one? Whether through this type of action or other means, authorities may need to broaden their approach in order to curtail North Korea’s monetisation of cyber-criminal statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reckoning-with-unintended-consequences&quot;&gt;Reckoning with Unintended Consequences&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unintended consequences can undermine or even reverse achievements in the fight against North Korea’s digital illicit finance. For example, intervening may require authorities to expose sensitive capabilities such as the ability to trace funds through reputedly opaque technologies or to secure cooperation from a state or platform regarded as hospitable to criminals. Revealing valuable sources and methods may prompt cyber-criminals to adapt by shifting away from compromised partners and improving operational security. In 2017, for example, US and European law enforcement took down AlphaBay, a massive darknet marketplace for illegal goods and services of all kinds. A few years later, the platform relaunched with stronger security protocols designed to prevent such disruptions, including a requirement that users transact only in the “anonymity-enhanced” Monero cryptocurrency as well as a decentralised hosting system that purports to defend against seizures and infrastructure compromises. A related drawback is that shutting down platforms that authorities have quietly infiltrated reduces visibility into malign actors’ fund movements and evolving tactics, techniques and procedures. Several blockchain analysts from firms that work with governments expressed concern in interviews that the Blender, ChipMixer and Sinbad actions, among others, had shuttered key windows into North Korean criminals’ activities, which they argued could leave authorities less well positioned to track and act against future activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking out non-compliant platforms may simply push bad actors further into the shadows of the underground, where they can be harder for law enforcement to reach. A few days after the AlphaBay intervention, administrators of BitMixer – then the most popular tumbler – shut down their platform too, citing the realisation that truly anonymising Bitcoin transactions was impossible, and encouraging illicit-minded users to switch to anonymous-by-design privacy coins instead. Blockchain analysts and government officials report significant difficulty tracking privacy coins, whose utility to North Korean actors seems to be constrained more by impermanent challenges such as low liquidity and exchangeability than by any inherent operational shortcoming. Troublingly, use by North Korean actors of privacy coins, especially Monero, and privacy-enhanced operating systems like TRON, a favourite of terrorist groups, has grown sharply in recent years. Beyond mixers, North Korean threat actors have increasingly turned for laundering solutions to technologies like privacy wallets, which enable users to participate in obfuscating procedures known as CoinJoins. As with decentralised mixers like Tornado Cash, CoinJoins involve non-custodial transactions, meaning privacy wallets are not vulnerable to disruption or seizure in the way that centralised platforms such as Blender or ChipMixer are. Providers such as Wasabi Wallet and Samourai Wallet have facilitated North Korean money laundering after major heists, such as the $281-million KuCoin exchange hack in September 2020, and strike many investigators as substantially more difficult to crack than the mixers that authorities have dismantled so far. On the whole, while shutting down a dirty mixer or rendering it ineffective may be a short-term tactical victory, the net strategic result may be to induce North Korean cyber-criminals to pivot toward more hardened protocols, exacerbating the challenge overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interventions may cause detrimental second-order impacts in the broader virtual asset ecosystem. Popular mixers and illicit marketplaces can be highly profitable to run, and the unexpected shutdown of a market leader creates a tremendous incentive for other actors to offer replacement services in order to meet the unfulfilled user demand. Reviewing the effects of an important recent action, analysts at TRM Labs commented, “The vacuum left by Hydra’s takedown resulted in a veritable ‘Cambrian explosion’ in [darknet markets], with at least a dozen illicit projects having surfaced in its place”. Elliptic found in late 2022 that the Tornado Cash designation had led to an analogous situation, and identified several new or as yet relatively unknown platforms that had begun competing for suddenly available market share. In addition to Sinbad, North Korean actors have passed tens of millions of dollars of virtual assets from recent heists through Railgun, a decentralised privacy protocol that purports to serve professional investors but which FinCEN considers a mixer. Although less established services tend to have lower throughput and fewer users, limiting the privacy benefits they can provide, dispersal across multiple nascent platforms may make it harder to build a complete picture of North Korean activity. Similarly, targeted bans or punitive measures levied against specific entity categories may spur responsive innovation outside the scope of the action. This phenomenon might manifest as a negative or a positive: developers could seek to build compliant solutions or to innovate around the letter of the law just enough to avoid punishment. Other possible market effects include spooking developers into offshoring – moving to more permissive jurisdictions beyond the reach of responsible authorities – and, counterintuitively, enhancing sanctioned actors’ capabilities by raising the prices criminal facilitators can command, thereby attracting more sophisticated partners to enter the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an industry where relations between authorities and developers are often particularly antagonistic, aggressive measures against virtual asset platforms risk further alienating the private sector and intensifying the misalignment that undermines efforts to combat North Korean cybercrime. Since market actors drive digital financial innovation and serve as the gatekeepers of the virtual asset marketplace, building an ecosystem inhospitable to crime will depend at least as much on private sector buy-in as on government intervention. While widespread industry adoption of standards such as Know Your Customer would go a long way towards curbing malign activity, sustained apathy or resistance to cyber security and compliance will only worsen endemic cybercrime. In other words, whatever an enforcement action’s short-term outcome, the private sector’s response may shape much of its net effect in the long run. Accordingly, while authorities must react firmly to threats and misconduct, officials should be mindful of how industry is likely to perceive their actions, and seek to shrink the gulf between the public and private sectors. Moreover, the fact that most mixer users are not criminals means that interventions inflict collateral damage on law abiding customers. Just as they do for criminals, enforcement actions may restrict ordinary users’ access to mixers, reduce their efficacy, or raise the cost of using them. Chainalysis has determined that, since early 2022, the proportion of mixed funds originating from illicit sources has grown, which may increase the risk to non-criminal users of violating sanctions or of having their assets caught in a seizure. Regrettably, until platforms with the will and capacity to perform sufficient compliance emerge – some do appear to be in development or in preliminary stages of deployment – infringement on ordinary users will likely remain a necessary cost of fighting North Korean cybercrime. As is practicable, authorities should seek to minimise these impacts and mitigate their actions’ negative unintended consequences overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, authorities should seek to encourage favourable knock-on effects. Actions designed to target North Korea may impose costs on other malign actors, including some outside the traditional cyber-criminal set. Financially motivated North Korean groups interact regularly with other elements of the global digital underground to purchase malware kits and network accesses, arrange digital infrastructure and cash-outs, and exchange technical know-how. In the course of their operations, threat actors across borders rely on an overlapping suite of tools and platforms, of which mixers are just one prominent example. According to the US Department of the Treasury, “OFAC’s investigation also identified Blender’s facilitation of money-laundering for, among others, Russian-linked malign ransomware groups including Trickbot, Conti, Ryuk, Sodinokibi, and Gandcrab”. Blender likewise processed funds from the massive Russian-language Hydra marketplace, which authorities took down a month before the US Department of the Treasury designated Blender. Criminal filings against ChipMixer describe it as “one of the most popular mixing services used by ransomware operators”, darknet markets, and even Russia’s GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate), whose operators used mixed Bitcoin to surreptitiously purchase infrastructure for hosting malware. Prominent dirty mixers and the North Korean actors who engage heavily with them share additional nexuses with illegal weapons and narcotics distributors, counterfeiters, purveyors of exploitative sexual material, and countless other criminal enterprises whose architects have gravitated toward virtual assets and digital privacy technology. These groups’ convergence of interests and tradecraft creates an opportunity for authorities to strike at multiple malign actor sets simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-recommendations&quot;&gt;III. Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper offers 14 recommendations for policymakers, national security practitioners, regulatory agencies and law enforcement working to counter North Korean cyber-criminals’ abuse of mixing services. The recommendations fall into three interrelated categories: broadening the approach to countering mixer exploitation through unconventional partnerships and new conceptual frameworks; building stronger cooperative relations with the private sector; and raising global cyber security and AML/CTF standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;broadening-the-approach-to-countering-north-korean-mixer-exploitation&quot;&gt;Broadening the Approach to Countering North Korean Mixer Exploitation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Institutions responsible for countering malign cyber operations should reduce barriers between teams focused on state-level and criminal threats, as well as strengthen collaboration between nation-state-specific teams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A core theme of this paper is that the lines between state and criminal activities in cyberspace and between disparate threat actor sets have become increasingly blurred. Government agencies around the world have often struggled to keep pace with these cross-cutting threats; former practitioners report burdensome delays in interagency processes, difficulty sharing information across institutions and inefficient allocations of scarce technical resources. Authorities should adjust to these trends by promoting further integration between teams responsible for state Advanced Persistent Threats, ransomware groups, virtual asset exploitation and traditional e-crime. Doing so would empower practitioners to more effectively identify and respond to overlapping threats, such as collaboration between North Korean and Russian-speaking cyber-criminal groups, as well as to capitalise on opportunities to achieve multiple victories in one fell swoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US Justice Department has taken laudable steps to de-silo its approach to cyber-criminal threats, having recently merged the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team into the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and established the National Security Cyber Section (“NatSec Cyber”), which seeks to promote “Department-wide and intragovernmental partnerships in tackling increasingly sophisticated and aggressive cyber threats by hostile nation-state adversaries”. It could be beneficial for national financial, cyber security and regulatory authorities, as well as international partnerships countering malign cyber activity, to consider forming analogous ad hoc task forces with wider mandates and more adaptable capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Practitioners should incorporate a robust analysis of potential unintended consequences as a standard element when planning any mixer intervention.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practitioners would benefit from adopting an expanded standard assessment of the potential second- and third-order effects of a proposed mixer action. Practitioners might consider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether the target platform can be easily relaunched or reconstituted elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The operational security adaptations the action is likely to trigger among cyber-criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The replaceability of the service being targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The likely alternatives cyber-criminals will adopt, and those platforms’ vulnerability to surveillance and disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The extent to which the action’s success depends on industry cooperation, and the likelihood that market actors will cooperate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The action’s probable effects on legitimate financial technology innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collateral damage to non-criminal virtual asset holders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. When taking action against mixers, authorities should seek out opportunities to make arrests, seize assets and operational infrastructure and instigate favourable knock-on effects, with an eye toward achieving enduring impact on malign actor groups.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actions against non-compliant mixers that remove key personnel and their resources from the field are more likely to have staying power. As the Blender and Sinbad cases reveal, motivated cyber-criminals can circumvent designations and takedowns rather nimbly. With arrests and infrastructure seizures, not to mention financial asset confiscation, authorities prevent threat actors from re-engaging in malign activity as easily and may glean useful intelligence. Targeting platforms and facilitators that service multiple malign actor sets can boost the return on investment of a single action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Policymakers and law enforcement should invest in better understanding developments in the virtual asset space and their implications for national security.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the Illicit Finance Risk Assessment of Decentralized Finance, the US Department of the Treasury should launch a standing Virtual Asset Risk Board modelled on the Emerging Technology Board the US Department of Justice envisioned in its 2022 Comprehensive Cyber Review. Such a board should meet regularly and produce biannual reports analysing the economic and national security implications of developments in the virtual asset space. UK bodies such as HM Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority should explore establishing a similar organ with a particular focus on the robust domestic virtual asset industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed below, offices charged with countering North Korean digital illicit finance, such as OFAC and FinCEN in the US, and the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) in the UK, should increase engagement with the private sector, which is naturally better positioned to track the cutting edge of advances in virtual assets and DeFi. Tapping more deeply into the expertise of investors and developers would usefully complement national security practitioners’ points of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;building-stronger-cooperative-relations-with-the-private-sector&quot;&gt;Building Stronger Cooperative Relations with the Private Sector&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Regulators and financial authorities such as the US Department of the Treasury and HM Treasury should nurture the development of compliant virtual asset privacy solutions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials should encourage the private sector to bring to market new platforms that can offer enhanced privacy for cryptocurrency holders without blindly enabling money laundering. Providing clear guidance on what is or is not permissible, as well as meeting with investors and developers, would reassure upstanding market actors who otherwise might not risk their energy and capital on projects they fear will not be approved or, worse, could lead to their arrest or designation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The widespread availability of compliant solutions would further mark the use of non-compliant platforms as an AML/CTF red flag and likely reduce the fund volume travelling through them, making it more difficult for bad actors to disappear in the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Authorities with mandates to intervene against virtual asset platforms, especially OFAC, FinCEN and the US Justice Department, should more clearly delineate the behaviours that will prompt enforcement action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justified or not, many virtual asset industry stakeholders, including some former senior government officials who now work in the private sector, have perceived US authorities’ enforcement approach as capricious and heavy handed. For the enforcement “deterrent” to work, authorities must make clear what malfeasance or inaction constitutes punishable bad behaviour – as distinct from the lesser legal and regulatory shortcomings that seem usually not to result in serious penalties in this burgeoning industry – as well as show that genuine good faith effort to avoid such bad behaviours will be rewarded with greater patience and leniency. While this issue appears most pronounced in the US, the lesson is applicable to all jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Regulators and national security practitioners should tailor their communications to the virtual asset industry on North Korean cybercrime by reframing the issue in economic terms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When encouraging market actors to comply with regulations and cooperate with law enforcement, authorities should frame North Korean digital illicit finance as a threat to the survival and prosperity of the virtual asset ecosystem, rather than as a “national security” issue, or a matter of right and wrong. Those kinds of appeals may ring hollow or simply not register, especially to users and developers based outside the relevant authority’s jurisdiction and to those who view government as an adversary. Emphasising that compliance and transparency benefit market actors’ economic interests is likely to yield more enthusiastic cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. As is practicable, governments should channel messaging to the virtual asset private sector through prominent senior officials, rather than practitioners.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authorities should issue more communications on North Korean cybercrime through high-level officials. Participants in the virtual asset industry are more likely to encounter and appreciate the gravity of these kinds of statements when they come directly from principals and senior deputies in speeches or media engagements than when they come from more obscure, technical or impersonal routes, such as the official channels of national security organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Regulators and national security practitioners should institutionalise dialogue with the virtual asset industry and adapt to market actors’ preferred communication channels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of expanding efforts to meet with legitimate virtual asset investors and developers, bodies such as OFAC, OFSI, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Conduct Authority should send more officials to speak at virtual asset conferences and appear on podcasts and livestreams – influential platforms that rarely feature government perspectives. The public engagement strategies developed at the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Office of the National Cyber Director, whose top leaders regularly headline both industry and grassroots events, could serve as a model. Authorities should also increase efforts to host industry stakeholders in government facilities, particularly those who are actively seeking to create compliant anonymity-enhancing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;raising-global-cyber-security-and-amlctf-standards&quot;&gt;Raising Global Cyber Security and AML/CTF Standards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Regulators and cyber security officials should work with the private sector to establish an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) for the virtual asset industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber security officials should engage private sector stakeholders as well as the architects of successful ISACs, such as those serving traditional finance and the North American electric grid, to help conceptualise and implement one for the virtual asset industry. To help assuage market actors’ concerns about revealing potentially sensitive customer information, officials should inform would-be ISAC participants of their special rights and liability protections under the law. Accomplishing the creation of such a body – which experts have suggested – will require champions in both government and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Financial authorities should continue efforts to build global AML/CTF capacity and advance implementation of FATF standards, and political leaders should renew their support, especially for the virtual asset Travel Rule.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognising that cyber-criminals and money launderers frequently exploit gaps in financial regulatory regimes, increasing global AML capacity and patching loopholes remains a fundamental component of any strategy for countering North Korean malign activity. Without the resources, technical expertise and will to perform monitoring and enforcement, even the most robust regulatory frameworks are toothless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the FATF’s latest implementation report, “jurisdictions are making limited progress implementing the FATF’s requirements on [virtual assets] and VASPs”, and “many jurisdictions seemingly do not know where to start when it comes to regulating the [virtual asset] sector for AML/CFT”. Of the 98 jurisdictions the FATF assessed in mid-2023, just 25 are largely or fully compliant. With respect to the FATF’s virtual asset Travel Rule, only 62 jurisdictions have adopted or are in the process of adopting the policy, while 127 appear to have taken no action towards implementation. Actual enforcement of the Travel Rule is presumably even less common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several RUSI projects have highlighted opportunities for tightening regulations and building capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. The FATF and the governments spearheading the campaign against North Korean digital illicit finance should explore ways to expand lower income countries’ access to cyber security and blockchain analysis tools.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korean cyber-criminals and money launderers often take advantage of countries that struggle to prevent illicit financial activity and cyber intrusions within their borders. Governments leading the charge against North Korean malign activity should seek to expand global access to the technical training and advanced software packages required to track illicit virtual asset flows and to protect computer networks. They should consider purchasing or subsidising those services for countries that cannot afford them at the required scale, in addition to encouraging firms to provide their services at reduced cost. Authorities should also conduct more capacity-building exchanges and expand partnerships with the private sector to train more international practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Regulators and cyber security authorities should encourage or require market actors to adopt industry-standard security practices, especially code audits.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022 alone, TRM Labs documented more than 100 major cases of cryptocurrency theft involving code exploits, which take advantage of vulnerabilities in a virtual asset platform’s architecture, or protocol attacks, which “target weaknesses in the underlying protocol or business logic of a cryptocurrency system”. The Wormhole and Qubit hacks, which led respectively to $325 million and $80 million in losses, are two recent examples of these kinds of compromises. Authorities should strongly encourage, and consider requiring, virtual asset firms to invest in robust cyber security practices, offer “bug bounties”, and engage third parties to perform thorough code audits before bringing a protocol to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Authorities should establish resource centres covering security and compliance best practices, incident response procedures and other important information for virtual asset developers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, far less official guidance is available to entrepreneurs looking to start a virtual asset business than to those in better established industries. Publishing basic resources that emphasise security and compliance in the virtual asset industry could go a long way towards raising standards. In addition, providing incident response templates – particularly instructions on who to contact in the event of an intrusion, which many local police teams are not equipped to handle – would encourage more victims to engage with authorities and enable swifter reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;further-research&quot;&gt;Further Research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As governments devote growing attention to virtual asset crime, a number of critical topics remain understudied. One blind spot involves early-stage technologies that have not yet received much scrutiny. Under the current paradigm, in which market actors function as the primary drivers of innovation, authorities are stuck playing catch-up as potentially risky platforms and practices come rapidly into being. Further, most of the detailed, up-to-date commentary on developments in virtual assets is aimed at prospective users or investors, rather than at legislators, regulators, law enforcement officers or national security practitioners. Of the security-focused research in this area, some of which has been quite impactful, nearly all projects look retrospectively at events from months or years prior. Given the pace of development in this space, officials would benefit greatly from a more proactive approach on the part of researchers. What new virtual asset technologies and platforms are emerging, and what are their implications for AML/CTF and national security? It would be especially valuable to assess the privacy-enhancing services that have appeared since the Blender and Tornado Cash designations in 2022, such as Privacy Pools, and whether they may help resolve the privacy/security dilemma. Researchers can also contribute by helping translate into policy terms the complexity of important new technologies and practices, which can require specialised knowledge to understand fully. These efforts help create a window into the rather insular virtual asset developer community, building the familiarity of officials and informing their decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The murky legal picture surrounding virtual asset technology is another area in need of additional research. Scholars and practitioners studying international security, cybercrime and digital finance often have no formal training in law and may be insufficiently prepared to evaluate the field’s novel legal questions. In many cases, there exists no legal basis for classifying these technologies, let alone taking action to address them in real-world contexts. Indeed, several former senior US Department of Justice and Treasury officials expressed concern that new technologies and practices could seek to exploit legal grey areas, such as outdated definitions of financial institutions and legal persons subject to sanctions, or to operate beyond the current scope of government authority. Are OFAC and OFSI, law enforcement, regulators and other relevant agencies properly equipped to handle virtual asset technologies that may pose security or money-laundering risks? Do they, or will they, require new legal authorities in order to continue fulfilling their mandates? In light of FinCEN’s recent proposal to increase scrutiny of mixers under its USA PATRIOT Act powers, do governments possess capabilities for virtual asset AML/CTF that have gone undiscovered or underused? Moreover, what standards should guide officials who are navigating dual imperatives to counter urgent national security threats without infringing excessively on legitimate expression and privacy interests? These questions demand thoughtful, evidence-based answers to supplement the cacophony of op eds, lawsuits and social media posts that have so far made up much of the public discourse, which has often been dominated by participants with vested interests in resolving the debate one way or another. RUSI and other outlets have offered valuable initial efforts, but more research is sorely needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having stolen more than half a billion dollars from the virtual asset ecosystem in 2023, North Korean cyber-criminals represent a serious ongoing threat to global security. Mixing platforms such as Tornado Cash, Blender, ChipMixer and Sinbad have played a critical role in North Korean actors’ laundering of illicit cryptocurrency, enabling them to funnel ill-gotten gains into the Kim regime’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes. Although ordinary thieves and scammers are ubiquitous in the virtual asset space, North Korean cybercrime is distinguished by its sheer scale and ultimate beneficiaries. The industry’s indefatigable pace of innovation, along with the complex entanglement of malign actors and legitimate users, has only served to compound the problem facing authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since early 2022, governments have redoubled efforts to curtail these dangerous practices, intervening directly against non-compliant mixers through takedowns and designations, whilst investing in the teams responsible for countering virtual asset crime. Taking stock of the past two years of aggressive action, authorities should be heartened by their impressive victories against individual dirty platforms, but concerned about North Korean cyber-criminals’ adaptiveness, not to mention unanticipated second-order effects in the dynamic virtual asset marketplace. Moving forward, governments should seek to broaden their approach to countering North Korean digital illicit finance through unconventional partnerships and new conceptual frameworks to cultivate stronger cooperation with the private sector and to raise global cyber security and AML standards.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet in many ways, they have reaffirmed the existing constitutional orthodoxy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2023, 20 countries gathered to take part in Operation Prosperity Guardian, conducting freedom of navigation exercises off the Gulf of Aden. They did so in response to a series of attacks against international shipping by the Yemeni Houthi rebels, which began with the hijacking of a container ship the previous month. The attacks have caused significant disruption to international trade ever since, sending vessels sailing thousands of miles around the Cape of Good Hope and adding weeks to their journey time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early January 2024, after ignoring an ultimatum and attacking allied warships, the Houthis provoked a response. UK and US forces conducted limited, joint strikes across Yemen to “degrade the Houthis’ capacity to make further attacks”. More operations followed throughout January and February, with the promise to take additional action, as necessary and appropriate, to address further threats or attacks. Such actions are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strikes have prompted fresh discussions about the UK’s war powers, particularly those involving the use of force below the threshold of war. Historically, the role of the legislature has been limited in the UK. Parliament is responsible for passing budgets to finance the armed forces and providing the statutory authority to maintain their existence. Yet the authority to declare and wage war remains a prerogative power vested formally in the monarch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By convention, this wide-ranging and discretionary authority has been regarded as a “political prerogative”, exercised not by the monarch personally, but by ministers of the crown. Over the centuries, the power to make and declare war was gradually transferred from the monarch to their Cabinet, chaired by the prime minister, who possesses the final authority for any decision to use military force without a vote in Parliament. With some notable exceptions, this has been tempered by a long-standing practice of keeping the House informed on war and foreign affairs, offering debates – if not decisions – on these most serious matters of state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This view was considered orthodox until 2003 when then Prime Minister Tony Blair called an unprecedented, “one-off” parliamentary vote aimed at securing legitimacy for Operation Telic prior to the invasion of Iraq. Rebellious factions within the governing Labour Party threatened to prevent UK involvement, so he framed it as a confidence motion in both his leadership and his government, promising to resign if he lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event, Blair experienced the largest rebellion within a governing party in a century. His foreign secretary resigned, and he would have suffered a heavy defeat without support from the Conservative benches; only 254 Labour MPs supported the government, far short of the 330 majority needed. Yet a mass resignation of Labour frontbenchers did not materialise, removing the possibility that political pressure would force Blair to resign, and the vote easily passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was suggested that this process established a political rule known as the “war powers convention”, whereby, “save in exceptional circumstances, the House of Commons is given the opportunity to debate and vote on the deployment of armed force overseas”. Although Blair argued the vote was “entirely symbolic” and “non-binding”, both the opposition leader William Hague and successive prime ministers made explicit political commitments to uphold the convention’s spirit. Some even saw it as a stopgap prior to full statutory displacement of the prerogative, an idea prominent, if not dominant, in New Labour circles. Regardless, it has become commonplace to view the debate in terms of a “convention narrative”, with Parliament enjoying an ever-greater role in military deployments since 2011, and the prerogative ever-shrinking from view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As Brown’s 2009 report demonstrated, a statutory war power would be either “undesirably broad” or “insufficiently flexible”, fraught with difficulties for little substantive benefit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was always somewhat illusory. Blair argued that existing practice regarding the prerogative was sufficient. There was no vote on deployments between 2003 and 2011, while a war powers statute was explored and disbanded by Gordon Brown. As Brown’s 2009 report demonstrated, a statutory war power would be either “undesirably broad” or “insufficiently flexible”, fraught with difficulties for little substantive benefit. As such, although the prerogative could be put on a statutory footing, there should be good reason for doing so. In the event, Brown argued for strengthening the convention in lieu of legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convention thus became the only major change to the war powers to survive the Blair-Brown governments, persisting in various guises under David Cameron and Theresa May, albeit subject to an increasing number of caveats and exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameron, an advocate of prerogative reform since 2006, clearly internalised much of the narrative within his understanding of foreign policy. However, his plans for reform never materialised, and his practice was far more telling than his promises. He subjected the 2011 Libyan airstrike campaign, Operation Ellamy, to a vote, winning it decisively. However, operations had already been underway for three days before this was held. When he next sought prior approval for airstrikes against Syria in 2013, he suffered a significant defeat. It proved the first time that any prime minister had been denied the authority to launch military action – authority that, legally speaking, he already had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, when Theresa May authorised identical airstrikes against Islamic State in 2018, she preserved the substance of the convention while reinterpreting it. Relying partly on the framework set out by Cameron’s defence secretary, Michael Fallon, May launched strikes without a debate, arguing their “emergency nature” precluded consultation. She merely asserted that she was observing the convention, and that her government was acting within the framework that had been set out, even while reinterpreting its bounds to enlarge their scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chequered history has led many to revise their position on the convention. Consensus suggests it exists in a state of limbo. Others have gone further, arguing it no longer exists in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is certainly true if one views it through the lens of the “convention narrative”. From this perspective, the government has evaded Parliamentary scrutiny through novel reinterpretations of its authority to act. Moreover, by refusing to displace the prerogative by statute, its actions remain effectively unconstrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the convention narrative presents an inaccurate picture of the prerogative. Past practice can help contextualise this. The convention has always been driven by the judgement of the prime minister as well as the authority they command in the House. Blair and Cameron chose to put their use of the war powers to a vote because their authority on these issues was relatively weak. Blair struggled to unite the sceptical left wing of the Labour Party around the idea of intervention, while Cameron’s coalition with the Liberal Democrats would probably have collapsed without a vote. The choice to put these issues to Parliament reflected both the fragile politics sustaining their governing coalitions and their own judgement of the proper relationship between Parliament and the prerogative. In the end, Blair convinced a significant majority to back his decision, while Cameron put forward a weak case and mishandled his political strategy, struggling to make the case for UK involvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;When seen in context, the convention narrative looks rather thinner than its advocates suggest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, whenever the convention has been reinterpreted, the government has possessed a strong or united majority in Parliament, and could be confident of victory even if a vote was held. Operation Ellamy is the outlier, though Cameron avoided the dilemma faced by Blair in 2003, as he had international authority to act. He took strike actions over the weekend and held both a debate and a vote the following Monday, in line with what the House expected post-Iraq. The Syrian airstrikes in 2018 and the recent strikes against the Houthis were both initiated over weekends, yet debates were held the following Monday also. The first was a light-footprint operation without UK troops, the second a direct response to an attack on the Royal Navy. Neither proved controversial in the aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this came at the expense of the convention. On the contrary, every prime minister since Blair has framed their actions in its terms, even when responding to novel circumstances. May asserted she had acted within its limits and worked hard to prove it, outlining a strong framework for the future exercise of the prerogative. Had she appealed to Parliament in 2018, she would likely have received the support she sought. The Conservatives enjoyed a slim majority, and divisions between opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn and his backbench MPs, many of whom supported intervention, led to rifts within the Labour Party which May could probably have used to gain cross-party support. However, she chose not to put this to the test. It was a gamble that turned on her own political judgement, and which ultimately paid off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When seen in context, the convention narrative looks rather thinner than its advocates suggest. Yet this should come as no surprise. The range of military actions the government can take varies widely, and the executive is afforded room to interpret what counts as emergency action, as well as broad discretion to act in defence of protect critical national interests. These determinations rest with the prime minister and Cabinet, who assess, interpret, and authorise the use of force. Although the perceived erosion of the convention has led to calls for a US-style War Powers Act, this has remained a fringe position for reasons beyond those in the Brown report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, owing to the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, any government which enjoys a cohesive enough majority in the Commons to ignore the substance of the convention could, by extension, overturn any War Powers Act intended to limit its authority. It would have to expend political capital to do so, but no more than a government seeking to ignore the current practice around the convention itself would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, and more importantly, the US experience refutes the assumptions of the convention narrative. The US president has been nominally constrained by the War Powers Resolution since 1973. Passed as a reaction to the Vietnam War, this statute was aimed at restricting the executive’s unilateral authority to wage war without Congressional involvement. While it has succeeded in preventing Vietnam-style creeping escalations, and although presidents have consistently sought Congressional approval before the major deployment of ground forces, it has fallen substantially short of its legislative intent. Noted for its own unhappy history and failure to live up to expectations, successive Republican and Democrat administrations have frustrated its provisions, adopting creative interpretations of reporting requirements and the phrase “hostilities” to authorise extended campaigns beyond statutory time limits. When pressed, presidents have argued that their actions are merely “consistent” with the Resolution’s requirements, refusing to acknowledge that they take action under its authority, and asserting the statute is an unconstitutional infringement on their office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important element of the Resolution hinges on the 60–90 day time limit within which a president must withdraw US troops they have committed to hostilities, unless Congressional approval is granted to extend this. For the Houthi action, this was triggered when the Biden administration submitted its first War Powers Resolution report on 12 January, notifying Congress that strikes were conducted alongside the UK pursuant to the president’s authority as Commander-in-Chief, in accordance with the conditions of the Resolution. This would theoretically limit the duration of the campaign to 12 April, at a maximum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Biden has already laid the groundwork for extending the campaign beyond this formal window. The administration has submitted a series of reports for each joint action with the UK, but none for strikes conducted without UK involvement. This has led many to speculate that Biden will continue the practice of claiming the 60-day time limit resets with each new report, or else that the US is not technically involved in “hostilities”. The Resolution’s substantive constraints are, despite appearances, quite limited in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Houthi case highlights the fact that debates and votes have been used as tools to overcome issues of authority and legitimacy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all of this, what do the recent Houthi strikes say about the war powers in the UK today? In many ways, they reaffirmed the old constitutional orthodoxy. Both the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and opposition leader Keir Starmer unequivocally stated that the actions were conducted in accordance with the convention framework and past precedent. However, the prime minister also noted that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, we need to maintain the prerogative powers that allow the Executive to act in such emergencies… I am responsible for those decisions, I do not take them lightly, and Parliament is responsible for holding me to account for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This position preserves the substance of the convention, though it is more forthright in asserting the government’s prerogative to act as it sees fit, without prior or retrospective Parliamentary assent. In this respect, Sunak followed a similar formulation to Fallon, May and US presidential practice, arguing that he acted “in accordance with” the convention while adapting it to the circumstances. He could be confident that his large majority, united behind current UK foreign policy, would support him regardless of whether he approached the House beforehand. And, like May, his decision to authorise strikes without consultation demonstrated his own personal understanding of how the war powers should operate within the bounds of the convention, and the authority he possessed to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunak was also strengthened by the fact that, in line with convention, Starmer and the shadow defence secretary were also briefed prior to the strikes, and have endorsed the government’s actions both in public and the Commons, albeit on a case-by-case basis. Had they opposed them or been unable to convince a significant majority to support this position, pressure would have mounted on the government to change course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Houthi case highlights the fact that debates and votes have been used as tools to overcome issues of authority and legitimacy. Equally, it shows how prime ministerial interpretations of the legal and political limits to their office, be that the conventions, norms or even the foundations of their authority, are of great significance. Non-legal, unwritten constitutional rules such as norms, conventions or practices all wield power when those in high office believe they exist, and war is the preeminent example of a convention-dominated realm of government, where the practice of constitutional actors matters, and where such practice largely constitutes the substance of that realm itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strikes provide further evidence that the political rule we know as the “war powers convention” is less of a convention, and more of a practice. This is a small difference, but it has important consequences. Practices exist as political rules because there are good practical reasons for them to do so. Conventions are somewhat stronger, relying not just on reasons but on stable and consistent precedent, backed up by a general agreement that their provisions are binding on constitutional actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The convention narrative may have over-promised and under-delivered precisely because it overlooks this distinction. Since 2003, this narrative has downplayed the virtues of the war prerogative, focusing on its archaic or anachronistic form rather than its valuable substance, while misunderstanding the strengths of the “convention” itself. Its aims are far more limited and subtle – forcing debates, structuring the conversation and linking the use of force more directly to the support of the House, particularly grey-zone activities below the formal threshold of war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of current practice and with an eye on future challenges, we may well want to keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，當裴倫德把他加入群組時，他並未有獲得 SWHK 其他成員的授權，所以他只是「in a loose sense」地代表 SWHK，並且基於他對其他 SWHK 成員意見的大概理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;裴倫德在訊息中形容，他們面對很多障礙，以致無法向國際社會清晰地發出信息，而這些障礙必須克服。（“For loads of reasons, I think the obstacle preventing you from speaking more clearly into the international community ‘must’ be overcome.”）控方追問「障礙」是指什麼。李指，其一是很多人都想維持以匿名身份，「所以有啲 idea 喺度，但唔會有人講到呢啲 idea。」再者，不同人分散在不同的地方、時區，而且討論不夠集中，「有時講呢樣，有時講嗰樣。」李又指，沒有一個授權的機制可讓人代表特定群體，當不同人接觸國際社會的時候，對方無法得知一個人可以代表到多少群體入面多少人，例如某人會見英國國會議員時，對方不知道這個人可以代表到多少香港人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，裴倫德在訊息亦提及香港的運動正處於關鍵性時刻（“I believe the movement is at a critical juncture.”），惟仍未有任何傳統民主派、政黨或者組織有意去擔任香港的代表，「結果從 international community 嘅角度，冇一啲好 clear 嘅 message 出到嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，裴倫德設立這個群組，原意是集合意見和進行討論。控方追問，為何裴倫德只將上述4人加入群組。李則表示：「我諗係 Luke 啱啱識我哋四個。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;群組訊息顯示李宇軒傳送制裁名單連結&quot;&gt;群組訊息顯示李宇軒傳送制裁名單連結&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，群組成員 Dimon 在2020年1月19日發訊息，提及「Dr. Warren Mann」想要一份應受制裁的香港高級警員名單，因為他曾經在「前線」處理傷者，希望向美國政府施壓以制裁該些警察。李在1月21日傳送一條 Google Drive 連結，可通向制裁名單的公開版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指 Dr. Mann 是一名醫生，以他理解，Dr. Mann 想建議一些制裁對象。至於 Dimon 提及 Dr.Mann曾在「前線」處理傷者，李不肯定是指打仗的「前線」還是示威「前線」，他對此沒有認知。李又指，他傳送制裁名單的連結之後，似乎便沒有下文，「我記得呢個 group 最尾不了了之」，但他不記得是否在這一個時間點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」網頁，「Darren Mann」被列為醫療範疇的顧問，簡介指他是一名英籍手術師，持有香港永久性居民資格，有在戰場和衝突地區工作的經驗，並且曾在國際上提出有關香港示威中違反「國際人道規範」的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問在製作制裁名單一事上，「香港大專學界國際事務代表團（IAD）」的角色是什麼。李則表示「我唔清楚」，只記得 IAD 曾就游說之旅向「G攬」報銷開支，而他則負責處理相關單據和向 IAD 歸還款項。李又指 IAD 不只會見政治人物，也會會見社運組織，以他所理解，IAD 會講述香港情況和支持香港自由民主。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒赴日會見議員討論人權法案-稱可阻嚇香港人權侵犯者&quot;&gt;李宇軒：赴日會見議員討論人權法案 稱可阻嚇香港人權侵犯者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李供稱在2020年頭曾到訪日本，在日本國會議員山尾志櫻里（Shiori, YAMAO；本名「菅野志桜里」）位於東京的辦事處與她會面，同場人士包括山尾的助理倉持麟太郎、張亦澄和一名叫「村長」的在日港人，其中倉持麟太郎是協助草擬法案及處理法律技術問題。李上周五供稱張亦澄已草擬了法案的草稿，李並透過電郵傳送給山尾志櫻里和高井崇志，惟當他會見山尾時，卻發現山尾已經準備好另一份法案草稿，變相當日會面好像是山尾向李和張匯報法案詳情，「我哋去到，『嘩！既然你哋已經準備好晒』，咁我哋就禮貌上『好好好』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，後來他們便開始嘗試爭取其他日本議員支持山尾所準備的人權法案。李形容法案可以達至阻嚇作用，如果發現與香港有關的人權侵犯事件的話，「咁日本嗰邊就可以經呢個 process 去 deal with 佢喇。」法官李素蘭追問，李剛才指法案並不同於馬格尼茨基人權問責法（Magnitsky Act），那麼當某人被視為人權侵犯者（perpetrators of human rights）的時候，他們會有什麼後果。李僅指：「同一啲同日本 jurisdiction 有關嘅嘢會 restricted」，但他不記得有哪些範疇會受到限制，所以無法舉例。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒疫情期間繼續爭取其他日本議員支持人權法案&quot;&gt;李宇軒：疫情期間繼續爭取其他日本議員支持人權法案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，其後全球爆發新冠肺炎疫情，所以有關法案的程序都停滯，日本國會亦未能開會。在這段時間，李透過電郵嘗試爭取高井崇志、井上哲志和山添拓支持山尾志櫻里的法案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，後來大約在2020年夏天，3個日本港人組織包括「Act with HK」、「SWHK@JPN」和「香港之黎明（香港の夜明け）」，在日本舉辦了一個活動，期間前香港眾志成員周庭透過錄像影片發表言論，她表示支持法案，並多謝日本人，希望日本的人可以繼續關心香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示李宇軒在2020年4月12日發送給高井崇志的電郵，當中以日文表示香港人抗疫之餘還要爭取民主和自由，並質疑日本政府將訪日的國家主席習近平視為「國賓」。電郵又指，法案一旦通過，能夠帶動日本更多有關香港民主化、疫情亂局和人權議題的討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指沒參與重光計劃眾籌-因仍身處香港國安法將臨-免款項遭凍結&quot;&gt;李宇軒指沒參與「重光計劃」眾籌 因仍身處香港、國安法將臨 免款項遭凍結&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼而就2020年5月的「重光計劃」提問。李表示他曾分別與「攬炒巴」劉祖廸和另一名被告陳梓華（網名T）討論。他指其時「攬炒巴」已經不在香港，與他之間的討論「主要係隔走我，唔畀我參與」，因為「攬炒巴」一方知道李仍身處香港，銀行戶口也是在香港，當時消息指香港會訂立國安法，惟外界仍未知條文內容，為了安全起見，「所以話唔好俾一個喺香港 jurisdiction 裡面嘅人 hold 住啲錢」，以避免遭指控「洗黑錢」或遭香港銀行凍結款項。李又指，當時「Project Hong Kong Trust」已經成立、在美國開設了銀行戶口，能夠處理眾籌而得的款項，所以不需要借用李的個人戶口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於陳梓華，李指因為「T嗰邊」曾經墊支，所以他亦需要與陳討論，「啫係意思係T嗰邊都唔好再墊支喇」，改為使用「Project Hong Kong Trust」的戶口處理錢銀。李指討論的結論是：「𠵱家唔洗你搞，同埋隔走T嗰邊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何會有「重光計劃」。李指當時檢視「G攬」眾籌之後的收支情況，根據 SWHK 網站所載，截至2020年5月，「G攬」錄得餘款約69.8萬美元（約546萬港元），所以決定舉辦第四次眾籌。李表示，由於他並沒有參與籌備是次眾籌，故此不知道他們使用哪一個眾籌平台，當時也不知道最後籌得多少款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方庭上展示的眾籌網站 gofundme.com 「攬炒團隊《重光香港計劃》— 攬炒過後是晨曦！[美金]」，顯示是次眾籌籌得175.5萬元美金。被問到眾籌款項由哪一個銀行戶口接收，李表示不知道，但他記得「傾嗰陣話係 Project Hong Kong Trust」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;網站載有呼籲人捐款的文字：「2020年5月，國安法兵臨城下，但我地香港人已經準備好攬炒。天助自助者，琴晚國務卿 Pompeo 亦措辭強硬，直言香港自治已死，全面制裁即將降臨。」李指憑相關行文風格，相信這些文字是由「攬炒巴」撰寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件周三（3月27日）續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李宇軒稱曾帶日本議員到中大二號橋視察、傳送法案初稿及展示催淚彈彈頭&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（22日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第51日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。李供稱，他與另一名被告陳梓華於2020年初曾到陳方安生的辦公室開會，二人被問及如何達至終局（Endgame），惟二人均說不出相關路線圖。控方亦未有要求李澄清「終局」的意思。此外，李稱在2019年區議會外國監選團來港期間，曾帶日本議員高井崇志到中大二號橋視察衝突後情況，事後二人有透過電郵聯絡，李亦將一份由義工撰寫的法案初稿轉發給高井崇志，冀議員能在日本議會上提出有關香港人權的法案。他亦在2019年12月曾赴日本與兩名日本共產黨議員見面，包括井上哲志和山添拓，「同埋帶咗啲催淚彈彈頭畀佢哋睇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第八天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒補充指印尼爆眼記者veby和聲稱被性侵sonia-一同會見美議員&quot;&gt;李宇軒補充指印尼爆眼記者Veby和聲稱被性侵Sonia 一同會見美議員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒昨日供稱於2019年底，在時任香港民主委員會（Hong Kong Democracy Council）成員、朱耀明兒子朱牧民（Samuel Chu）的安排下，赴美國國會山莊會見參議員斯科特（Rick Scott）、Todd Young 、克魯茲（Ted Cruz）和 Marsha Blackburn。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李昨供稱一同會見美議員的人有 Sonia 、Diana 和 Veby，控方追問二人是誰。李指 Sonia 曾經聲稱被性侵，因為會見美議員是為了展示香港示威入面，「原來就有呢啲有血有肉嘅人呢，就係 victims 嚟，佢（Sonia）就係講佢畀人性侵嘅故事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qCY24zi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 左起：吳傲雪（Sonia Ng）、Katherine Cheng、Todd Young 、李宇軒、朱牧民（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指 Diana 是一名空姐，相信她的角色是講述她被航空公司施壓，「叫人唔好參加香港嘅民主運動」。至於 Veby，李指她是「印尼爆眼記者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨日庭上提到李傳送一份建議制裁名單給朱牧民，控方今展示「重光團隊」的 Facebook 專頁截圖，顯示制裁名單的第三版本上載於專頁。控方指共有141名人士，包括前特首林鄭、前警務處處長曾偉雄、警司陶輝和行政會議成員湯家驊，以及整個警隊被列於名單上。惟李表示他並非專頁的管理人之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指-swhk-沒有中文名非所有人同意稱呼攬炒團隊&quot;&gt;李宇軒指 SWHK 沒有中文名、非所有人同意稱呼「攬炒團隊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;昨日庭上展示李宇軒與朱牧民之間的 Telegram 對話，訊息當中一度提及「攬炒團隊」，李昨稱「攬炒團隊」並非指「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong，簡稱 SWHK）。控方今日要求李澄清 SWHK 的中文名稱。李則指並非所有 SWHK 的成員都同意以「攬炒團隊」作為中文名稱。法官杜麗冰問李的意思是否指 SWHK 沒有中文名，李確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李亦提到「G攬」登報結束之後，組員逐漸不再使用「G攬」這稱呼，因為其後的活動不再與登報相關，「如果你喺某一個活動好認同嘅話，就用 SWHK 呢個label」，惟直至李被捕一刻，組員仍然未能統一使用 SWHK 這名義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李能否辨認出 SWHK 有哪些成員，李表示：「In a loose sense，可以」，例如有的人多次參與籌辦 SWHK 的活動，而該些人又認同 SWHK 這個參與身份。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱曾到英領事住所參與會議-出席者包括李柱銘陳方安生郭榮鏗和莫乃光&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱曾到英領事住所參與會議 出席者包括李柱銘、陳方安生、郭榮鏗和莫乃光&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒昨稱，在2019年11月區選之後，曾經參與民主黨創黨主席李柱銘、前政務司司長陳方安生、英國議員 Lord Alton 和裴倫德在 W Hotel 的會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李供稱，他不記得在2019年底還是2020年初，曾獲時任英國駐港領事賀恩德（Andy Heyn）邀請到其住所參與會議，同場出席者還有民主黨創黨主席李柱銘、前政務司司長陳方安生、時任立法會議員郭榮鏗和莫乃光。李指在該次會議中，李柱銘和陳方安生屬於「老一啲嘅民主派」，郭榮鏗和莫乃光「就喺中間」，而「我就係再後生嘅 generation」，因此賀恩德想聆聽年輕一代的意見。李並指會議曾討論「大家對香港民主嗰個睇法」，亦曾提及《中英聯合聲明》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱事前有告訴陳梓華（網名T）他將會出席這會議，而陳有作出回應，大概意思是：「去見吓，network 吓」、「加油」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指陳方安生會上問及endgame-惟他與陳梓華均說不出路線圖&quot;&gt;李宇軒指陳方安生會上問及endgame 惟他與陳梓華均說不出路線圖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直至2020年年頭，李稱他與陳梓華一同到陳方安生的辦公室見面，是他第三次與陳方安生見面。控方問，陳為何會邀請李一同會見陳方安生，李則稱以他所知，陳方安生與陳梓華本來相識，「唔知 T（陳梓華）同陳方安生講咗啲咩，咁就 invite 咗我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kEx4BAF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳方安生（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指討論內容「大概意思係我同T（陳梓華）當係𠵱個 generation 嘅 activists，即係話陳方安生問 T 同我，我哋最尾想點做」，李表示他和陳均「答唔出一啲 concrete 嘅 roadmap（路線圖）」。因為當時香港發生很多示威、行動和集會，「啫係（陳方安生問）如果我哋有 endgame 嘅話，我哋會點樣去達到，同埋想點樣做」，惟李表示：「但我同 T 都冇 endgame」，又稱：「我哋冇嚟緊做呢樣、做嗰樣嘅 roadmap（路線圖）。」李形容該次會議「冇結果」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒曾與陳梓華和攬炒巴討論-三人共識李繼續做國際游說工作&quot;&gt;李宇軒：曾與陳梓華和攬炒巴討論 三人共識李繼續做國際游說工作&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒早前作供提及於2019年底或2020年初的時候，在軟件 Jitsi 上與「攬炒巴」進行視像會議，因而知道對方真實身份是劉祖廸。李今詳述會議內容，指陳梓華親身去找劉祖廸，「因為佢哋喺同一個 screen 度」，三人討論提及：「攬炒巴就去做一個精神領袖或者一個 influencer 嘅角色，我就係繼續國際線游說，T 就會喺香港 local 度做一啲ground work，大概意思係咁」，目的是推進為香港爭取自由民主的運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問「ground work」的意思，李舉例指他自己屬於「後線」，所以不屬於做「ground work」；相反陳梓華則會做「ground work」，例如參加集會以及「真人喺香港落場嘅活動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就上述會議所提出的建議，李憶述他自己當時回應「OK」，「因為同我本來做緊嘅嘢冇分別。」控方問李日後是否根據三人之間的共識來行事。李則澄清，對於陳梓華叫他繼續做國際游說，「其實同我做緊嘅嘢冇分別，對於我嚟講，啫係講咗等於冇講過咁，事實上我的確係有做 international lobbying，咁算唔算做緊 in accordance with 佢講嘅嘢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李，為何三人會在這個時間點進行視像會議？李回答當時大家主要想討論香港運動的方向。法官李運騰問李當時如何看待自己的角色，李宇軒稱他理解自己是「其中一個喺 international 做 lobbying 嘅香港人。」李官又問，為何只有他們三人參與會議。李則表示：「我當時冇諗過呢個問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱曾帶日本議員高井崇志-事後電郵傳送法案初稿&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱曾帶日本議員高井崇志 事後電郵傳送法案初稿&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，在不同國家均有 SWHK 成員，包括美國、英國、加拿大、澳洲和日本等。而他在日本有進行國際游說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李憶述，在2019年區議會選舉期間，時任日本國會議員高井崇志（Takashi, TAKAI）來港監察選舉，於是李與他在香港見面，談及香港當時民主情況和示威情況。李又稱在中大二號橋衝突之後，他帶了高井崇志到二號橋視察。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，他與高井崇志事後有經電郵聯絡。在2020年，一個日本港人組織的義工張亦澄草擬了一份法案初稿，而李則於同年1月7日將此法案初稿電郵至高井崇志，詢問他的意見。李指他亦有傳送該電郵給另一名日本議員菅野志櫻里（Shiori, YAMAO [née KANNO]）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問法案草稿的內容是關於什麼。李指是關於香港一些人權問題，擴展至國際層面的人權侵犯。他指上述電郵目的是希望日本議員能考慮會否採用這法案草稿的提議，並在議會上提出此法案，另外此電郵同時副本抄送給草擬人張亦澄，類似是李將張亦澄和高井崇志串連在一起，讓二人可加以討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關於張亦澄的背景，李指張並非香港人，相信他應該是中國內地人，但不肯定他有否入籍日本，而他的 Telegram 網名是「Katatsuki Hayashi」。李又指張曾經修讀法律，所以對法律範疇比較熟悉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒2019年12月帶同催淚彈殼赴日本見議員&quot;&gt;李宇軒：2019年12月帶同催淚彈殼赴日本見議員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李另提及，他在2019年12月曾赴日本與兩名日本共產黨議員見面，包括井上哲志和山添拓，「同埋帶咗啲催淚彈彈頭畀佢哋睇⋯⋯啫係用過嗰啲。」李指是次會面是由日本一些關心香港的人士安排，可能是「Act with HK」或「SWHK@JPN」的成員，由於該兩個組織的人士「本來唔係特別有做 lobbying 嘅嘢」，同時「未有人想真身去見議員住，所以就彈咗畀我」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李宇軒：由登報轉型做國際游說 傳送建議制裁名單予朱牧民 冀轉交美議員&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/g0W5e3s.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（21日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第50日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。李稱他籌辦全球登報活動，以及會見聯合國人權事務高級專員辦事處職員之後，與另一名被告陳梓華討論之下，便決定「慢慢將我轉型做 international lobbying」。於是李參與會見美議員斯科特、安排外國人來港觀察區議會選舉，以及參與民主黨創黨主席李柱銘、前政務司司長陳方安生、英國議員 Lord Alton 和裴倫德的會議。2019年底，李赴美國國會山莊會見數名共和黨議員，為了展示香港示威及相關事件裡面的「受害者」個案，讓美議員有基礎去推動支持香港的法案，包括制裁侵犯香港人權民主的人士。同場香港代表包括朱牧民，事後李向朱傳送一份建議制裁對象名單，希望朱代為轉交給美議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第七天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指獲邀見美議員斯科特-因陳梓華認為其游說工作特別有效&quot;&gt;李宇軒指獲邀見美議員斯科特 因陳梓華認為其游說工作「特別有效」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李昨日證供提到2019年9月29日獲另一名被告陳梓華（網名「T」）邀請會見美國參議員斯科特（Rick Scott），因為李曾經籌辦全球登報活動，又曾經赴聯合國會見人權事務高級專員辦事處（OHCHR）職員 Sébastien Gillioz，「咁喺國際呢條線度做過嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李今日加以補充，他們會見 Sébastien Gillioz 之後，「除咗 secure 到一個官方嘅 reply，即係 special procedure，我另外搵到 Sébastien Gillioz，佢話有職員幫我哋 prioritise （優先處理香港的事務和材料）」，陳梓華當時對此結果印象深刻，認為李的游說工作「特別有效」，所以邀請李會見斯科特。李形容：「當時慢慢有個 transition 由登報去到 lobbying。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又提到，除了聯合國之行外，他在會見斯科特之前還去了法國，「係一個 lobbying 嘅 trip 嚟嘅。」該旅程完結後，李正在考慮「應唔應該繼續做法國嘅 lobbying」，以及是否應該與當地港人組織「Le Comité pour la Liberté à Hong-Kong」合作，或者經該組織進行游說工作，惟當時他並不懂法文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱與陳梓華討論後決定轉型做國際游說&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱與陳梓華討論後決定轉型做國際游說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就會見 Rick Scott 一事，陳梓華設立了一個 WhatsApp 群組「Coffee on Sunday」，成員有陳、李和 Mark Simon。控方展示該群組訊息，陳在訊息中介紹李為「international propaganda people」。李指因為他曾經籌辦全球登報活動，他和陳經過討論，便決定「慢慢將我轉型做 international lobbying」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Simon 在群組中提議，李應該向斯科特談及較早前的眾籌，以留下深刻印象。（“Also, what would really impress him is if you talk about the go fund me, shows support”）李表示，他不知道為何 Mark Simon 會認為提及眾籌會打動到斯科特，可能 Mark 掌握到斯科特的背景資料，故此提醒李要談論哪些話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華訊息提醒不要提及資助人-李宇軒指可能指墊支人&quot;&gt;陳梓華訊息提醒不要提及「資助人」 李宇軒指可能指墊支人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另指，在陳梓華成立 WhatsApp 群組之前，李和陳之間曾經有 WhatsApp 對話，並展示相關紀錄截圖。陳轉述 Mark Simon 提醒李不要提及「Backer（資助人）」和「中英聯合聲明登報」團隊。（“Brother, Mark said do not mention about backer and JD team”）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「Backer」的身份，李表示不肯定，「不過我理解係 T（陳梓華）嗰邊，作為 crowdfunding 嘅 backer，即係有墊過支。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李提到當時斯科特有意參選總統，陳梓華和 Mark Simon 希望他避免談及墊支事宜，因為避免可能觸犯美國總統選舉的規矩。李表示他在會面期間有遵從陳在訊息中的指示。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李會見斯科特之後，有否與陳梓華談論該會面。李回答有，指自己「大概講咗會面講嘅嘢」，又引述陳回應他「『Good, Keep up, good work』呀咁」。至於 Mark Simon，李則稱事後沒有與他討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指陳梓華支持他安排區選監察團-以擴展人脈作國際游說&quot;&gt;李宇軒指陳梓華支持他安排區選監察團 以擴展人脈作國際游說&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼而就2019年區議會選舉監察團提問，並展示「Election Observation Mission Report（下稱「EOM」）」，當中提到監選團由「重光團隊」和李成立的「香港故事」籌辦。法官杜麗冰留意到報告上除了有「重光團隊」標誌之外，還有「IAD」標誌。控方提供相關資料，指這是「香港大專學界國際事務代表團」的標誌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱監選團是邀請不同觀察員來港觀察區議會選舉，而他是香港那邊的其中一個搞手。控方問誰人指示李參與。李則澄清：「因為唔係一個指示嚟，係一個 story 嚟」，當時他與陳梓華、轉型中的「重光團隊」以及「攬炒巴」劉祖廸等人進行討論，而「攬炒巴」與顧問公司「Whitehouse Consultancy」曾討論英國上議院議員 Lord David Alton 有意來港觀察選舉，「但唔想好似 Lord Alton 主動過嚟咁」，反而想由一個社運團體邀請他來港，於是李直接給他們使用「香港故事」的名義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，「攬炒巴」和「Whitehouse Consultancy」提議除了邀請 Lord Alton 之外，還邀請更加多人，而上次有份接待 Bob Seely 的李宗澤（Wilson Li）表示願意協助處理流程，於是「攬炒巴」和「Whitehouse Consultancy」便著手邀請更多人來港監選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒稱有跟陳梓華討論安排「監選團」，「佢都支持我去整呢個 EOM，同埋希望喺 EOM 𠵱個場合度擴展我嘅人脈」，這關乎他轉型做國際游說，以爭取香港自由民主。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒要求裴倫德刪除監選團相關訊息-免被港府禁入境&quot;&gt;李宇軒要求裴倫德刪除監選團相關訊息 免被港府禁入境&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示2019年11月22日，即區選之前兩日，李宇軒與「對華政策跨國議會聯盟」創辦人兼執行總監裴倫德（Luke de Pulford）之間的 WhatsApp 對話，當中提及要刪除訊息紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李解釋，以當時的政治環境而言，根據籌辦監選團的人士的判斷，當時香港政府並不歡迎外國人來港監選，叫裴倫德刪除訊息是因為擔心若果他被發現有監選團相關的訊息，會被港府標籤為「不受歡迎人士」，被禁止來港。李續指，若然來港監選的人最終被視為「不受歡迎人士」及不能入境，後備方案是他們把情況告知相應國家的領事館和傳媒。因此在裴倫德過關期間，李表示需要與裴倫德保持訊息聯繫，以確保他順利過關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱監選團分成港九新界不同小隊，而他屬於其中一個新界小隊，同隊成員包括 Lord Alton。李憶述當時陳梓華叫他把握機會建立人脈網絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒銀行紀錄顯示mark-simon曾借50萬元&quot;&gt;李宇軒銀行紀錄顯示Mark Simon曾借50萬元&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指是次邀請外國人來港監選的開支約有幾十萬元，由「G攬運動」眾籌款項支付，也有的外國代表是自費來港，包括瑞典和丹麥的代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，李的銀行戶口紀錄顯示， Mark Simon 在2019年11月21日向李轉帳一筆50萬港元款項。李解釋，當時有見即將籌備監選團，惟其個人戶口只剩下約26萬元，「所以我就要去搵T（陳梓華），我可能唔夠錢去搞 EOM，咁就睇吓佢可唔可以諗吓辦法」，例如找人墊支，於是 Mark Simon 便轉帳了50萬元給他，「我諗就因為嗱嗱臨，佢直情就用 personal account 就畀我喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，他並不需要還款給 Mark Simon，因為 Mark Simon 幫忙接收「G攬」眾籌款項，他之後歸還款項給「Project Hong Kong Trust」時，已經直接扣除了上述50萬元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指根據收支帳目表，李合共墊支了約55.2萬港元。昨日提到「Project Hong Kong Trust」在2020年2月28日向李轉帳約42萬元美金（約328萬港元），以歸還李所有活動墊支過的開支。李解釋42萬元美金的計算方法，他先計算所有活動墊支款項的總和，然後扣除已經歸還了給他的款項，例如上述 Mark Simon 的50萬元，最終得出42萬美元這數目。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指李柱銘和陳方安生會見斯科特和裴倫德-談論香港民主情況&quot;&gt;李宇軒指李柱銘和陳方安生會見斯科特和裴倫德 談論香港民主情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒指，在監選團結束之後，Lord Alton、裴倫德、民主黨創黨主席李柱銘和前政務司司長陳方安生在西九龍的 W Hotel 開會，而李宇軒得知有這個會議，於是陳梓華叫李參與這個會議。在會議中，李曾經與 Lord Alton 和裴倫德交談。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李憶述，李柱銘和陳方安生在會議中「講香港民主情況」，而 Lord Alton 則表示會盡力以英國議員的身份引起關注，李理解裴倫德是作為 Lord Alton 的助理。控方追問他們談論的是引起什麼「關注」，李指是「對香港嘅民主情況」的關注；控方再問有什麼情況值得關注，李僅說：「Deteriorate 緊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2019年底赴美會見議員-李宇軒為推動支持香港法案使侵犯人權者負責任&quot;&gt;2019年底赴美會見議員 李宇軒：為推動支持香港法案、使侵犯人權者負責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒確認曾在2019年底到美國國會山莊會見參議員斯科特（Rick Scott）、Todd Young 、克魯茲（Ted Cruz）和 Marsha Blackburn。是次會見議員是由時任香港民主委員會（Hong Kong Democracy Council）成員、朱耀明兒子朱牧民（Samuel Chu）安排，隨團人士包括天文物理學家 Shirley Ho 和李宗澤（Wilson Li），不過二人並沒有出席會面。李稱事前有告知陳梓華相關行程，而陳回應「好」、「加油」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及是次會面目的，李指會面是為了向美國的議員展示香港示威及相關事件裡面的「受害者」個案，「等佢哋有 grounds （基礎）去 push（推動）幾個同香港有關嘅 Acts（法案）。」而該些法案即「廣義上當時 support 香港嘅法案」，例如《香港人權與民主法案》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問，通過這些法案是為了什麼目的。李一度問：「你想我講 sanctions（制裁）？」他其後解釋，首項目的是作為一個政治氣勢（political momentum），在美國推動一些支持香港的法案；另一個目的是使一些「侵犯人權者（Perpetrators of Human Rights）」負上責任，例如制裁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指會面由朱牧民安排-會上不需談細節-由雙方職員事後跟進實務&quot;&gt;李宇軒指會面由朱牧民安排 會上不需談細節 由雙方職員事後跟進實務&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，如果沒有記錯的話，他們會見的美國議員均是共和黨黨員，而且全部都是關心香港議題的議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李憶述朱牧民在事前簡單解釋過，在會議期間並不需要談及太多細節，因為在會面之後，雙方的職員（staffer）會再商討細節和跟進實務工作，所以會議上只需主要談論幾個受害人的故事，「同埋即係有禮貌地多謝佢哋關心香港嘅事務。」而香港這邊的職員（staffer）就是朱牧民。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;當控方追問他們想美國議員採取什麼行動，以及針對對象時，李表示：「唔好意思，我頭先已經答咗」，重申「我哋喺 meeting 唔可以特定要求佢哋（美議員）concrete 做乜嘢，啫係呢個係等 staffer 大家之後去夾嘅。」不過李表示，從廣義上來說，他們希望美議員通過法案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就是次旅程的開支，李稱由他先作墊支，之後向「Project Hong Kong Trust」報銷。控方又展示「重光團隊」的 Facebook 專頁在2019年12月11日的帖文，附有一張 Todd Young 與李宇軒、朱牧民、吳傲雪（Sonia Ng）和 Katherine Cheng 的合照。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒向朱牧民傳送建議制裁對象名單-冀轉交美議員&quot;&gt;李宇軒向朱牧民傳送建議制裁對象名單 冀轉交美議員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示李宇軒與朱牧民之間的 Telegram 訊息，李在訪美旅程之後，向朱轉發了一份文件檔案，題為「Profiles of Perpetrators of Human Rights and Democracy Abuse in Hong Kong（打壓香港人權和民主人士之檔案）」，封面並標註「Confidential（機密）」。文件內容列出四類建議制裁對象，包括發出指令侵犯人權的政府人士（“State actors who condone and give orders for human right violations”）、促使侵犯人權的政府人士和政治人物（“State actors, including politicians, who instigate human rights violations”）、協助和教唆侵犯人權的公私營機構人士（“State and Private Actors who Aid and Abet Human Rights Violations”）和促使侵犯人權的機構（“Organisations who facilitate human rights violations”）。庭上所見時任特首林鄭月娥位居榜首，其他官員和港鐵行政總裁等人亦榜上有名。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李相信文件是由「重光團隊」其他人製作，但是他稱：「我冇去參與整呢個文件，但我喺 SWHK 入面，我有參與嗰啲有關 sanctions 嘅討論。」被問到傳送這份文件給朱牧民的原因，李解釋，當「重光團隊」成員知道他見完美國議員之後，希望他能向美議員提議制裁對象，因此他需經由香港一方的職員，即朱牧民去向議員提供材料，所以李向朱提供相關文件，讓朱判斷何時及如何把這些材料交給美國議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到有否閱讀過上述文件，李表示「應該𥄫咗一眼」、「跟住碌一碌，哦原來好多人」，但是並沒有詳細閱讀。至於醞釀製作這份文件的時間，李則稱有一段長時間，因為「重光團隊」的大群組不時有人提起制裁，組員討論一段時間之後，可能會轉談其他話題，「啫係溝埋晒其他 discussion」，所以未能肯定相關討論實際歷時多久。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒希望建議制裁名單保密-籲勿傳至群組&quot;&gt;李宇軒：希望建議制裁名單保密 籲勿傳至群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;訊息紀錄顯示，李傳送完文件給朱之後，表示他不相信群組內所有人會保密（“I don’t trust everybody in the group to keep this confidential”），朱回覆他也不會（I wouldn’t either）。李庭上解釋，他不想文件被傳送至大群組供人傳閱，因為文件性質是「機密」，所以要求朱不要傳送文件至群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又表示，以他理解這份文件是為美國而設，如果有需要向美國以外的國家提供制裁名單的話，便需要找擁有這份文件的人製作另一份。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

Hezbollah has also repeatedly violated UN Security Council Resolution 1701 by deploying forces and firing anti-tank guided missiles and other stand-off weapons against Israel from the zone between the Blue Line and the Litani River, according to CSIS geolocation analysis. The United States needs to increase its diplomatic engagement to prevent what could become a much wider and more violent war in the Middle East.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Hamas’s brutal terrorist attacks in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, Israel nearly launched a preventive war against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Israeli intelligence assessed that Hezbollah fighters were on the verge of crossing the border into northern Israel as part of a multi-pronged attack. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) deployed fighter aircraft that awaited orders to strike targets in Lebanon. Israeli officials apparently notified the White House around 6:30 a.m. on October 11, 2023, that they were considering preventive strikes and requested U.S. support. But senior U.S. officials, including President Joe Biden, pushed back. According to CSIS interviews with U.S. officials, they were worried that Israeli strikes in Lebanon would unnecessarily trigger a regional war and were skeptical of Israel’s intelligence that an attack was imminent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Israel did not launch a preventive war, the possibility of an Israel-Hezbollah conflict looms over the region. Israel faces a dilemma. It can risk war with Hezbollah, but in the process, a war would broaden the fighting in a way that makes the current war in Gaza look like a minor dust-up. Israel could also wait, which would avoid war now with Hezbollah, but this could risk a more serious conflict in the future with a foe that is better armed and capable and that could control the timing of a war to its advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the prospects of war, this brief asks several questions. What factors shape the possibility of war? What are Hezbollah’s capabilities today? What are Israel’s options? What options does the United States have to mitigate or prevent a war?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, this analysis includes a mixture of both quantitative and qualitative information. It compiles data on Israeli and Hezbollah strikes along the Israel-Lebanon-Syria border, geolocates Hezbollah attacks against Israel in the zone between the Blue Line and the Litani River, and examines satellite imagery of Israeli strikes against Hezbollah targets. It also assesses Hezbollah’s military capabilities, including compiling data on Hezbollah’s stockpile of 120,000 to 200,000 short-range guided ballistic missiles, short- and intermediate-range unguided ballistic missiles, and short- and long-range unguided rockets. Finally, it draws on interviews the authors conducted with U.S. and Israeli officials on a trip to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis makes three main arguments. First, the security situation has dramatically worsened in recent months for several reasons: the October 7 attacks profoundly increased Israeli insecurity; the displacement of over 150,000 civilians on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border has created growing pressure, particularly in Israel, to alter the security situation so that civilians can return; Hezbollah and Iranian-linked groups in Lebanon and Syria continue to stockpile stand-off weapons that can hit Israel; and Hezbollah continues to violate UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1701. Taken together, these factors have created a volatile situation in an already tense Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, violence between Israel and Hezbollah has already started to climb after nearly two decades of low-level conflict. Since October 7, there have been more than 4,400 violent incidents concentrated around the Blue Line and the Golan Heights involving Israel and Hezbollah, according to CSIS analysis. In addition, CSIS analysis indicates that Hezbollah’s anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) have struck Israeli forces from concealed launch sites less than three kilometers from the Blue Line on at least 17 occasions since October 7, a clear violation of UNSCR 1701.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the United States needs to increase diplomatic efforts to prevent an all-out war, which would be devastating for both Lebanon and Israel and ignite a broader conflagration in an already combustible region, including triggering more attacks on U.S. forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this brief is divided into four sections. The first examines the evolving security landscape. The second section assesses Hezbollah’s capabilities and force disposition, particularly along the Israel-Lebanon border. The third section analyzes Israel’s objectives and options. The fourth section explores U.S. policy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-changing-security-landscape&quot;&gt;The Changing Security Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel has repeatedly fought Hezbollah since the group’s inception in the early 1980s. Indeed, Hezbollah has defined itself from the start in opposition to Israel and dedicated itself to driving Israel out of Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah conducted periodic operations against each other in the 1980s and 1990s despite the presence of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), and Hezbollah succeeded in forcing the Israeli military to withdraw from Lebanon in 2000. In the process, Hezbollah conducted an array of terrorist attacks against Israel around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon, Hezbollah continued occasional attacks on Israel, using the pretext that Israel occupied Shebaa Farms, a small area at the intersection of the Lebanon-Syria-Israel border. Hezbollah claimed Shebaa Farms was Lebanese territory and thus that Israel’s occupation continued, despite the United Nations concluding that Shebaa Farms is Syrian and that Israel had evacuated its forces from Lebanon completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area of dispute was the village of Ghajar, just west of Shebaa Farms and bisected by the Israel-Lebanon border. Its residents have both Lebanese and Israeli citizenship. For years, a fence divided Ghajar, but Israeli forces reoccupied all of Ghajar in 2006 and today retain control there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low-level conflict between Israel and Hezbollah flared into an all-out war in 2006 after a Hezbollah cross-border kidnapping operation. The war left over 100 Israelis and around 500 Hezbollah fighters dead, as well as devastated Lebanon. Hezbollah likely did not anticipate its operation would spark an all-out war, and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah later announced that he would not have conducted the operation if he had known a war would occur. Although Hezbollah suffered far more dead, some Israelis saw the war as a disaster due to the large number of Israelis killed, and the IDF’s battlefield performance was widely criticized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2006 war ended with UNSCR 1701, which created a zone between the Blue Line and the Litani River along the borders of Israel, Lebanon, and Syria. According to UNSCR 1701, the area between the Blue Line and the Litani River should be free from any armed personnel, assets, and weapons except for those of the government of Lebanon and UNIFIL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VHti587.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: UNSCR 1701 Zone in Southern Lebanon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2006, an uneasy deterrence prevailed. Israel occasionally attacked Hezbollah fighters and Iranian arms shipments headed to Hezbollah and other groups in Syria, and there were intermittent rockets, drones, and other stand-off attacks back and forth across the border. For the most part, however, the border was the calmest it had been in decades, with both sides eager to avoid another all-out war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, however, the situation is delicate for several reasons. First, the October 7 attacks dramatically increased Israeli insecurity. It is difficult for most outsiders to fully comprehend the psychological impact and trauma caused by the gruesome attacks. Israel was surprised on October 6, 1973, when Egypt and Syria launched an attack on Israeli forces in the Sinai and Golan Heights. But October 7, 2024, was largely a surprise attack that killed Israeli civilians, including women, children, and the elderly, and involved numerous atrocities and sexual violence, much of it captured on video. Indeed, it was the third-deadliest terrorist attack around the globe since the University of Maryland began collecting terrorism data in 1970, and on a per capita basis, it was 15 times more deadly than the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001. In interviews conducted by several of the authors in Israel in December 2023, Israelis of all sorts stressed the failure of their intelligence services and military forces on October 7, and many Israelis felt they could no longer rely on deterrence given its failure against Hamas on October 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attacks took a psychological toll on Israelis. According to an analysis published in the medical journal The Lancet, the attacks led to notably higher levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) among Israeli citizens. It concluded, “Our findings show that the deleterious effects of these attacks were not restricted to those directly exposed to the brutal acts of terror but also to those indirectly exposed. Thus, these attacks are to be considered as a mass trauma event affecting an unprecedented proportion of the country/s population.” According to a Gallup opinion poll, Israelis’ emotional health plummeted after the attack, with record-high majorities saying they experienced higher-than-normal levels of worry (67 percent), stress (62 percent), and sadness (51 percent). As Gallup concluded, “No other country has ever seen such a large year-on-year increase in negative experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Israel’s risk tolerance has likely changed. If Hamas, less well-armed and trained than Hezbollah, can brutally kill over 1,100 Israelis, what might the more formidable Hezbollah do? Hezbollah’s close relationship with Iran and its ties to Hamas reinforce this fear. Reducing the risk Hezbollah poses includes ensuring that Hezbollah’s elite Radwan forces are not poised on Israel’s border, as they were before October 7, 2023. Israel would also like curbs on Hezbollah’s arms and other, more expansive restrictions, though they are aware this is unlikely. Israeli officials profess to prefer a diplomatic solution but warn that “we will have to act on our own” should diplomacy fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, in addition to increasing Israel’s sense of insecurity, the repercussions of the October 7 attack and clashes between Hezbollah and Israel have displaced more than 150,000 people on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border since October 2023, including roughly 80,000 civilians from northern Israel and 75,000 from southern Lebanon. For Israel, resettling its internally displaced persons back to their homes and villages in northern Israel will require creating — and ensuring — a security environment that currently does not exist. Israeli leaders need to convince their population that, this time, the intelligence services can anticipate any attack and the military can stop it — a difficult task given Hezbollah’s capabilities and one far harder due to the discrediting of military and intelligence officials on October 7. Domestic pressure has been growing to improve the security situation. According to Avigdor Liberman, a former minister of finance who leads an opposition party, the Israeli government has been weak in the north: “The red line became a white flag — the war cabinet surrendered to Hezbollah and lost the north.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Hezbollah has dramatically improved its military since 2006 and stockpiled over 120,000 stand-off weapons in Lebanon and Syria, as discussed in more detail in the next section. With Iranian partner and proxy forces active in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and other countries across the region, the threat from the north could get worse over time, not better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Assessed Areas of Operations of Hezbollah ATGM Teams (October 8, 2023–March 5, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, Hezbollah has repeatedly violated UNSCR 1701 by stationing its forces in the zone between the Blue Line and the Litani River, sometimes under the cover of the fake nongovernmental organization “Green Without Borders.” Geolocated footage from Hezbollah propaganda videos indicates that Hezbollah ATGMs have struck Israeli forces from concealed launch sites less than five kilometers from the Blue Line on at least 17 occasions since October 7, as shown in Figure 2, a clear violation of UNSCR 1701. These attacks have mostly been against Israeli military bases and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems. At least seven Israeli civilians and approximately 10 IDF soldiers have been killed in the attacks. ATGMs played a major role in the 2006 war, during which they accounted for the majority of Israeli infantry casualties, including the loss of 24 tank crewmen and penetration of about 20 tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: Violent Incidents Related to the Israel-Hezbollah Conflict by Week&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 3, there was little fighting between Hezbollah and Israel in the months prior to the October 7 attack. But the 15 weeks after the attack have witnessed more than 4,400 violent incidents involving Israel and Hezbollah. Hezbollah began to launch limited attacks on Israel as a way of showing solidarity with Hamas. This led to an Israeli response, resulting in a bloody tit-for-tat. As Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned, “You expand, we expand. You escalate, we escalate.” The incidents have been concentrated around the Blue Line, as illustrated in Figure 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hezbollahs-objectives-military-forces-and-capabilities&quot;&gt;Hezbollah’s Objectives, Military Forces and Capabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines Hezbollah’s overall objectives, force design, defensive positions, rocket, missile, and unmanned aircraft system (UAS) arsenal, anti-tank capabilities, air defense capabilities, and proficiency as a fighting force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Hezbollah has several objectives that could lead to a conflict with Israel, though the organization has numerous, and at times competing, goals, some of which make a conflict less likely or at least would lead Hezbollah to be cautious. Hezbollah sees itself as a revolutionary organization that is one of the leaders of the broader Muslim struggle against Israel. Destroying Israel has been a part of its core ideology since its founding, and most of its members are sincerely against the very existence of the Jewish state. Hezbollah shares this goal with Iran, which also rejects Israel ideologically and sees it as a threat to the Islamic Republic: for decades, Iran and Israel have engaged in a shadow war, with Israel conducting assassinations against Iran and building alliances with regional rivals of the Islamic Republic like Saudi Arabia. Iran, for its part, has backed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah against Israel, used terrorism, and otherwise tried to weaken Israel. Hezbollah also sees itself as the defender of Lebanon, and various territorial disputes and Israeli incursions are a constant source of tension. Finally, Hezbollah, like Hamas, seeks the release of prisoners in Israeli custody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah, however, has important reasons for caution. Most importantly, Hezbollah seeks broader popularity in Lebanon, and triggering a destructive war could grievously undermine support, particularly outside its Shiite core constituency. Iran also may seek to keep Hezbollah in reserve as a weapon to use should Israel or the United States launch a major attack on Iran itself. Finally, Hezbollah recognizes the military power of Israel and would not lightly provoke a conflict it might lose or, at the very least, lead to widespread destruction in Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force Design:&lt;/strong&gt; Hezbollah has approximately 30,000 active fighters and up to 20,000 reserves. Its forces primarily consist of light infantry, which have historically been trained and built for stealth, mobility, and autonomy. Hezbollah has employed a version of what the United States calls “mission command,” empowering subordinates to make independent battlefield decisions based on a commander’s intent. This force design has allowed Hezbollah to operate effectively under conditions of overwhelming Israeli firepower. In 2006, for example, its rocket units were designed to set up a launch site, fire, and disperse in less than 28 seconds, relying on prepositioned equipment, underground shelters, and mountain bicycles to achieve such a small window of exposure. In the wake of the 2006 war, Hezbollah continued to build on the strengths of this approach, decentralizing its command and control and reorganizing to force the IDF into more urbanized terrain where its fighters can take advantage of concealed, fortified positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah’s experience fighting in support of Bashar al-Assad in Syria for the past decade has given it access to capabilities and competencies used by conventional armies. Hezbollah can now conduct coordinated maneuvers of larger forces, employ suppressive artillery, and conduct logistics to support larger groupings of forces. Fighting in Syria has also given Hezbollah access to T-72, T-54/-55, and T-62 main battle tanks (MBTs). Its ability to employ armor inside Lebanon, however, is questionable. MBTs require dedicated sustainment formations and supply chains that may not exist in Hezbollah’s areas of control in Lebanon itself, and Israel would aggressively target MBTs with fighter aircraft, drones, and artillery. Hezbollah also fought against a different enemy in Syria — irregular forces that look very different from the modern military of the IDF. Hezbollah’s ability to effectively employ the capabilities it has gained since 2006 in the face of IDF firepower, especially airpower, is also unclear, and indeed, it is likely that any large, heavy forces would be quickly destroyed if they were deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geography and Defensive Positions:&lt;/strong&gt; The geography of southern Lebanon offers several advantages that Hezbollah fighters could exploit in a war with Israel. The region, including much of the area directly across the Israeli border, predominantly consists of rocky hills. In 2006 and in other clashes with Israel, small and mobile groups of Hezbollah militants used trees, patches of vegetation, caves, surface irregularities, and buildings along the slopes of the hills to conceal their movements and fire rockets, UASs, and ATGMs at Israeli positions on the border. Any heavy Israeli military ground force attempting to move throughout the region would likely be restricted to the major hard-packed roadways due to the hilly terrain and would, therefore, be vulnerable to harassment with ATGMs, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and ambushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah has built a network of tunnels and bunkers in the hills of southern Lebanon to host and move equipment and personnel relatively securely. Hezbollah also uses this infrastructure to launch ambushes and rocket attacks. Where it lacks purpose-built military fortifications, Hezbollah fighters can exploit existing civilian infrastructure in the cities, towns, and villages throughout the region. During the 2006 war, civilian infrastructure was critical to Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon. They used it in place of formal military fortifications to hide command centers, complicate Israeli targeting, conceal fighters for ambushes, and enable fighters to disperse, maneuver, and defend in depth. Thousands of civilians fled from southern Lebanon as strikes between Hezbollah and Israel intensified after October 7, 2023. Some of the towns and villages along Lebanon’s southern border almost completely emptied. In a war with Israel, Hezbollah could exploit civilian infrastructure and its network of tunnels and bunkers to attack Israeli ground forces and quickly retreat. Aware of Hezbollah’s fortifications and probable tactics, Israeli attacks would likely emphasize clearing and destroying Hezbollah’s tunnel network in southern Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of rivers run through southern Lebanon, including the Litani River, which flows south from the Lebanon Mountains before bending west where it empties into the Mediterranean. Control of these rivers and their features represents an important strategic objective, including controlling the movement of troops, equipment, and supplies. These rivers also serve as natural defensive fortifications that can be exploited for tactical advantages in combat by defending forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rockets, Missiles, and Unmanned Aerial Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Hezbollah’s rockets and missiles pose two distinct threats to Israel. The first is their coercive effect: continuous rocket, missile, and UAS barrages can kill or wound Israelis — both civilians and military personnel — or destroy important political or economic infrastructure in Israel. This is the way Hezbollah’s rockets and missiles were primarily used in 2006 and how they are usually discussed in the context of war with Israel. The second threat comes from the tactical and operational effects of these systems: suppressing or attritting IDF forces to limit the effectiveness of Israeli operations. Hezbollah gained experience conducting combined arms operations in Syria, and the group may attempt to use rockets and missiles as part of ground operations against Israeli forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah is probably the most heavily armed non-state group in the world, and its stockpiles of rockets, missiles, and UASs are a major part of its arsenal. Estimates of how many rockets and missiles Hezbollah possesses vary from 120,000 to 200,000. Because of Hezbollah’s close relationship with Iran, it is likely that Tehran would resupply Hezbollah quickly if it used this arsenal in a conflict with Israel. This resupply is easier than in the past, as Iran’s presence in Syria expanded considerably after Tehran came to the rescue of the Syrian regime when civil war broke out after 2011, creating a land bridge that enables weapons to go from Iraq to Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon. This stands in sharp contrast to Hamas, where weapons and people must be smuggled via tunnels from Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Table 1, the bulk of Hezbollah’s arsenal consists of short-range unguided projectiles. Hezbollah has also dramatically increased its access to long-range missiles since 2006, meaning that most of Israel will feel the threat of Hezbollah attacks if the conflict escalates. Finally, Hezbollah’s precision-guided missiles pose an acute threat to Israel’s most important political, military, and economic centers — a threat that did not exist in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xO91cwF.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Hezbollah’s Rocket and Missile Arsenal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliminating the threat from Hezbollah’s rockets will be extremely difficult. The rockets can be launched from trucks, increasing their mobility and therefore survivability, or from underground bunkers, as was common during the 2006 war. Finding and destroying Hezbollah’s rocket and missile capabilities would involve an enormous reconnaissance-strike effort involving a variety of intelligence assets, precision strike capabilities, and ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah’s rocket and missile arsenal also includes long-range missiles. These are also likely to be used mainly in a coercive capacity, with Hezbollah undertaking long-range strikes against Israeli population centers to undermine Israeli support for the war. Hezbollah used its long-range rockets and missiles throughout the 2006 war despite an Israeli air campaign aimed at destroying their launchers and Hezbollah’s apparent unwillingness or inability to make much use of its Iranian-made long-range weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah’s guided missiles make up an even smaller number of those long-range missiles — a few hundred at most. The accuracy of these weapons makes each attack more devastating and creates greater pressure on Israeli air defense systems. They provide Hezbollah with the capability to strike high-value targets, vital economic centers, and critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Hezbollah has historically used its rockets and missiles to impose pain on Israel rather than as part of combined arms operations, an important unknown is how Hezbollah might use its rocket and (to a lesser extent) missile capabilities in support of ground operations against the IDF. Hezbollah could attempt to capture territory in northern Israel or the Golan Heights in a Hezbollah-Israel war, or at least conduct raids there. This would require ground maneuver, which modern militaries usually enable using suppressive fire from artillery or air platforms. Hezbollah demonstrated the ability to integrate ground maneuver with suppressive fires in Syria, and it may attempt to do so in a war with Israel. Such tactics are difficult in practice, and expertise is probably unevenly distributed across Hezbollah’s military forces. IDF air defenses and air power would also limit Hezbollah’s ability to use its rockets and missiles in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qch9xH2.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Satellite Imagery of Damaged Runway in Qalaat Jabbour Mountain Region, Lebanon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its rocket and missile stockpiles, Hezbollah possesses a significant arsenal of UASs that include commercial quadcopters, suicide drones, loitering munitions, and more sophisticated platforms with surveillance and strike capabilities. Hezbollah’s UASs are almost entirely supplied by Iran and are used to conduct surveillance of — and strikes against — Israeli targets. On January 25, 2024, the IDF struck a 1,200-meter runway in southern Lebanon that it alleges Hezbollah built with Iranian assistance and was used by Hezbollah to launch large UASs. The airstrip and the surrounding base illustrate the advancement of Hezbollah’s UAS capabilities to include larger and more sophisticated systems. The base also contained a helicopter landing pad, support and storage facilities, and warehouses and UAS hangers under construction. The damage to the airstrip caused by the Israeli airstrikes can be seen in Figure 5, including four bomb craters on the runway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since October 7, Hezbollah has attempted at least 40 UAS attacks against Israeli targets, as shown in Figure 6. Several of these attacks have successfully penetrated Israeli air defense systems, killing IDF soldiers and damaging military sites in precision strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BIBUDzh.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: UAS Incidents in Israel (October 8, 2023–March 15, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen in Table 2, Hezbollah UAS systems come in a wide variety. This list is not exhaustive, and Hezbollah likely possesses additional Iranian or indigenous drone models. Also not shown are the variety of commercial drones, such as Chinese DJI quadcopters, that Hezbollah possesses and which can be used to conduct surveillance or modified to deliver explosive payloads. Should war with Israel break out, Hezbollah would likely receive additional imports of drones from Iran and emphasize adapting commercial off-the-shelf systems to their needs. After all, Iran has established logistics supply routes — both air and land bridges — that can bring weapon systems and other equipment from Iran to Lebanon through Iraq and Syria. The result is that Hezbollah would probably be able to sustain a campaign of UAS attacks against Israeli targets in Lebanon and Israel unless supply routes were cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sGbr0WF.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Select Iranian UAS Exported to Hezbollah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah’s tactical employment of UASs in a war with Israel is difficult to predict. Hezbollah drone operators have received training from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps–Quds Force, have performed military exercises with drones, and are observing the war in Ukraine, where a variety of new uses and techniques for drones on a battlefield have emerged. Hezbollah could attempt to use its UASs as part of a reconnaissance-strike complex, relaying targeting information for indirect fires or attacking mobile Israeli targets, but Hezbollah’s ability to coordinate its UAS and ground-based capabilities remains to be seen. Hezbollah could also use UASs to detect, surveil, and attack Israeli forces should they enter southern Lebanon or to overwhelm Israeli air defenses through swarming attacks, possibly in combination with rockets and missiles. The effectiveness of these tactics will likely be limited, however, by Israel’s sophisticated counter-UAS capabilities, including electronic warfare systems, air defense systems, and other countermeasures that could disrupt UAS communications with ground systems or knock them out of the sky altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-tank Guided Missiles and Improvised Explosive Devices:&lt;/strong&gt; ATGMs and IEDs give Hezbollah potent capabilities to attack armored vehicles and fortified locations. These capabilities were vital to its tactical successes in the 2006 war, although Israeli tactical failures contributed to the loss rate it experienced in 2006. The IDF is unlikely to repeat those mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah has almost certainly improved its anti-tank capabilities since 2006. It currently fields an ATGM system, Tharallah, that is designed to overcome the active protection system used by the IDF’s Merkava MBTs, although its efficacy is unclear from open sources. Hezbollah has taken steps to improve the mobility of its anti-tank units, mounting Kornet anti-tank missiles on all-terrain vehicles. Several news outlets also reported in late January 2024 that Hezbollah had used a more advanced Kornet-EM to attack an Israeli air control base, which would represent a significant increase in ATGM range and destructive power. On the tactical side, analysis of Hezbollah’s combat performance in Syria suggests that its members remain well schooled in using ATGMs against armored vehicles and fortified infantry positions. The result is that Hezbollah’s ATGMs are likely to remain one of its deadliest capabilities, even if they do not attain the success rate of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah also has a considerable IED capacity. Hezbollah employed IEDs with explosively formed penetrators (EFPs) against Israel in the 1990s and will almost certainly seek to do so again. EFPs are shaped charges with a concave end, which typically send a molten copper slug through targets and then create a deadly spray of hot metal. Hezbollah’s expertise in using IEDs probably allowed it to contribute to IED attacks against U.S. and British forces in Iraq. During the war in Iraq, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps–Quds Force — which aids Hezbollah — built infrared triggers, explosive circuits, and other EFP components in Iran and smuggled them across the border in Iraq to be used against U.S. forces. Hezbollah could also conduct attacks on Israeli forces using tunnel bombs, which were used in Iraq and Syria to literally undermine fortified positions, or improvised rocket-assisted munitions, which Hezbollah used. These IED capabilities, combined with Hezbollah’s ATGMs, would allow the group to harass and disrupt the advance of Israeli ground forces in Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These weapons, however, will not be decisive in battle. They are suited for killing one vehicle at a time or striking a small, fortified position, not for defeating a combined force integrating infantry, armor, indirect fires, and air power. Israeli countermeasures, such as the Trophy active protection system, will also limit their efficacy. IEDs will, however, inflict casualties, which Hezbollah leaders probably believe would undermine political will in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Defense:&lt;/strong&gt; Since the 2006 war, Hezbollah has emphasized the advancement and expansion of its air defense capabilities in an effort to degrade Israeli air superiority. Hezbollah’s air defenses include a range of systems primarily manufactured by Iran and Russia, including anti-aircraft guns, man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), and short- and medium-range surface-to-air (SAM) missile systems, as seen in Table 3. These systems most commonly make their way into Lebanon smuggled through Syria, and Hezbollah has occasionally used them to engage Israeli UASs flying over southern Lebanon in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JetWRE8.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: Hezbollah’s Air Defense Systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2023, U.S. intelligence officials reportedly believed that Russia’s Wagner Group intended to transfer another SA-22 system to Hezbollah from Syria. There have also been recent allegations that militias in Syria are actively training to use Iran’s most advanced air defense system, the Khordad-15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 7, Israeli aerial activity has decreased in recent years and remains at historically low levels today, suggesting that Israel takes the threat of Hezbollah’s air defense systems to its aircraft seriously. Statements from Israeli military officials confirm as much. In 2022, the outgoing chief of Israel’s air force stated that Israel no longer had unimpeded air superiority over southern Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4fqhwz7.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 7: Average Daily IDF Flight Hours over Lebanon by UN Reporting Period&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of war, Hezbollah’s air defenses would likely force Israeli aircraft to fly at higher altitudes, reducing their ability to accurately hit targets on the ground. At the same time, Hezbollah’s air defense systems would be high-priority targets for Israel. On February 26, 2024, the IDF announced that it had struck Hezbollah’s air defense sites in the Beqaa Valley in response to Hezbollah shooting down an Israeli drone over Lebanon earlier that day. In an escalated conflict, Israel would likely continue to favor the use of UASs over manned aircraft to reduce the risk posed by air defense systems to its pilots, though Israel does have fifth-generation aircraft such as the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter. A successful downing by Hezbollah of a manned Israeli aircraft would be a strategically significant event. Although Hezbollah’s upgraded air defense systems pose a greater threat to Israeli aircraft than they did in previous conflicts, Israel still has immense air superiority over Lebanon. Israel’s air force boasts some of the most advanced aircraft in the world, including U.S. and indigenously designed systems. Since the October 7 attack, Israel’s air force has successfully struck targets across Lebanon on almost a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Hezbollah’s tactical proficiency, combat experience, and will to fight make it a much deadlier threat than Hamas — and even other regional militaries. Western analysts praised Hezbollah’s efficacy in the 2006 war with Israel, and its forces have only since grown more effective. Hezbollah’s combat experience in Syria has given its troops experience in ground combat that few regional militaries possess, forcing them to learn how to conduct offensive operations and exposing them to the tactics, techniques, and procedures of the Russian military. Hezbollah members have also repeatedly displayed a willingness to accept decisive engagement and fight to the last soldier — attitudes that will only be increased by the desire to defend their homes from an Israeli offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the Hezbollah that Israel would face if violence were to escalate to major ground operations is more capable than in 2006. Hezbollah is larger, better armed, and more experienced, thanks in part to its experience fighting in Syria. It is most effectively designed to fight a coercive campaign aimed at killing Israeli soldiers and civilians at a steady rate through rocket, long-range missiles, ATGM, and UAS attacks. But it may also have some ability to conduct combined arms offensives against Israeli troops and limit Israeli air dominance. Even so, it remains technologically outmatched by the IDF, which has long prepared for a rematch of the 2006 war, has been engaged in a war with Hamas since October 2023, and will be able to bring much greater firepower to bear from its land- and air-based platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;israeli-objectives-and-options&quot;&gt;Israeli Objectives and Options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the changing strategic landscape and Hezbollah’s evolving capabilities, what options does Israel have? There are at least four options: (1) return to the pre–October 7 status quo and emphasize deterrence, (2) start an all-out war with Hezbollah to destroy the group’s capabilities and force it to comply with Israel’s demands, (3) engage in a limited war with Hezbollah to put pressure on the group and push its forces further from the Israeli border, and (4) use coercive diplomacy to better implement UNSCR 1701.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-1-the-status-quo-ante-and-a-return-to-deterrence&quot;&gt;Option 1: The Status Quo Ante and a Return to Deterrence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel might try to return to a deterrent approach, which has uneasily kept the peace for almost 20 years. Deterring Hezbollah rests on the idea that the threat of war — including the potential destruction of portions of Lebanon — and punitive strikes on the group and Lebanese infrastructure will keep the group from launching attacks or at least massive strikes on Israel. This threat works by endangering something Hezbollah holds dear, such as the lives of its leaders, its power in Lebanon, and the well-being of its constituents. After Israel left Lebanon in 2000, it retaliated against the occasional rocket strike or other violation of the peace with the threat of more massive strikes should Hezbollah mount a larger attack. As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned in December 2023, “If Hezbollah chooses to start an all-out war, then it will single-handedly turn Beirut and South Lebanon, not far from here, into Gaza and Khan Yunis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence seems to be alive even after October 7. Nasrallah has stressed in public statements that Hezbollah does not plan a broader war even as it supports the Palestinians and will not rule out escalation if circumstances change. Hezbollah strikes focus on a discreet target set along the border even though the group has the capacity to launch far more attacks and to strike all of Israel. It is clearly trying to limit its attacks even as it shows solidarity. Hezbollah cares about its constituents and recognizes that a repeat of the 2006 war, let alone something much worse, would be a disaster for these supporters. In recent years, Lebanon’s economy has plummeted, and Hezbollah does not want to take the blame for a war that would further devastate the country. Israeli threats have made clear to Hezbollah that Lebanon would be hit hard if an all-out conflict resumes, and the devastation of Gaza reinforces the credibility of this threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence, however, could fail for several reasons. A strike that kills large numbers of Israeli civilians, even if accidental, would inflame the situation. Deterrence also rests on understanding an adversary’s decision calculus, and Israel might misunderstand Hezbollah’s tolerance for attacks on Hamas leaders or the continued loss of Hezbollah cadre, including important operational leaders. As previously noted, Israel’s risk tolerance has changed, and Israeli leaders might decide that even a small chance of Hezbollah attacking Israel needs to be preempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-2-an-all-out-war&quot;&gt;Option 2: An All-Out War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should deterrence fail, whether by accident or by choice, an all-out war is possible. Israel’s chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, told Israeli soldiers that the chances of war against Hezbollah are growing. Part of Israel’s logic is that a war with Hezbollah at some point is inevitable and that Israel should not wait for a surprise attack. Chuck Freilich, a former Israeli deputy national security adviser, noted, “If you believe that with Hezbollah is inevitable, as many in Israel do, then now is as good a time as any to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A war would likely focus on preventing a more dangerous repeat of October 7, going after Hezbollah’s rocket, missile, and drone capabilities and trying to push the group’s fighters farther from the border, probably to the other side of the Litani River. Even a decisive defeat of Hezbollah, however, would not lead to the group’s destruction given its deep roots in Lebanon and strong support from Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel possesses considerable capacity for war with Hezbollah, though the Lebanese group would be a formidable foe. Israeli intelligence tries to continuously monitor Hezbollah missile and UAS sites. Indeed, part of why Hamas was able to surprise Israel on October 7 was likely because Israeli intelligence was more focused on Hezbollah, which it saw as the greater threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDF outnumbers Hezbollah in troops, tanks, artillery, and other forms of military power. Israel’s equipment is also far more sophisticated, and its forces are better trained. Since its poor performance in the 2006 war, Israel has prepared for war with Hezbollah, in contrast to its lack of preparation for the invasion of Gaza. Israel has prepared a target set it can draw on at any time for strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Israeli attack would probably involve massive airstrikes that would seek to target Hezbollah leaders, disrupt command and control (which would also involve cyberattacks), and hit Hezbollah’s rocket launcher sites, especially those that involve Hezbollah’s precision munitions arsenal. Although Israel would target Hezbollah leadership and military sites in Beirut and in the Beqaa Valley, it would likely focus most of its effort on Hezbollah’s presence near the border. Using lessons learned in Gaza, Israel would likely also attempt to destroy Hezbollah’s tunnel network. Finding and targeting Hezbollah tunnels has been an Israeli military and intelligence priority for years, though Hezbollah showed in 2006 that it could successfully use deception to build an extensive network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Israeli leaders, such as Benny Gantz, a member of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s war cabinet, remarked in February 2024 that Israel could strike the Lebanese military as part of a broader war. “It is important that we be clear — the one responsible for the fire from Lebanon is not only Hezbollah or the terrorist elements that carry it out, but also the government of Lebanon and the Lebanese state that allows the shooting from its territory,” Gantz said. He also added: “There is no target or military infrastructure in the area of the north and Lebanon that is not in our sights.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel might then invade Lebanon with several divisions (it used four in Gaza, where the dense urban terrain required extensive manpower), seeking to uncover and destroy hidden tunnels and force Hezbollah fighters to the other side of the Litani River. Although southern Lebanon is not densely populated like Gaza, some of the fighting would involve urban warfare. If Israel were to successfully remove Hezbollah forces, it would then carefully monitor the area and conduct extensive strikes if necessary to prevent any return. Israel might push for a more robust UNIFIL force to monitor the area or seek to create a buffer zone, working with Lebanese proxies, as it did before 2000, though both of these approaches have proved insufficient in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hezbollah would respond in several ways. Hezbollah forces would conduct guerrilla attacks, likely using an extensive tunnel network and well-prepared defensive positions near the Israeli border, taking advantage of the rough terrain there. Hezbollah would also attempt cross-border attacks as well as perhaps maritime infiltration in order to strike at Israel directly. In addition, Hezbollah would use its massive rocket and missile arsenal to attack Israel, overwhelming Israel’s defensive systems and striking at targets throughout the entire country: in 2006, Hezbollah was able to conduct rocket and missile attacks for all 34 days of the war, and its arsenal today is far larger. Finally, Hezbollah might conduct international terrorist attacks at Israeli targets around the world, working extensively with Iran to do so. Hezbollah would also use its influence over the Lebanese government to ensure that any ceasefire was on its own terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-3-limited-war&quot;&gt;Option 3: Limited War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to continue the current level of conflict, in which there is no all-out war, but dozens of Hezbollah fighters are killed every month, as well as a small number of Israelis. Civilians would die on both sides, but if current patterns continue, far more Lebanese would be killed than Israelis. Limited war would involve regular Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah forces near the border and on the occasional Hezbollah commander, while Hezbollah would fire anti-tank missiles at military and civilian infrastructure across the border, allow Palestinian groups based in Lebanon to attempt the occasional cross-border attack, and launch rocket and mortar attacks on Israeli positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limited war would serve several purposes for both Israel and Hezbollah. For Israel, such strikes keep Hezbollah off balance, forcing its commanders to hide or risk being killed and putting its weapons caches at risk. In addition, the strikes show the Israeli people that the government is actively trying to defend them and make it hard for Hezbollah to amass forces that might conduct a surprise attack across the border. For Hezbollah, limited war allows it to show solidarity with Hamas and affirm Iran’s “resistance” agenda. Although Hezbollah has lost over 100 fighters since October 7, this level of casualties is manageable for a large organization with many skilled personnel. For both Hezbollah and Israel, limits to the conflict help avoid the costs of an all-out war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, limited war poses problems for both groups, in addition to the regular casualties. The biggest problem is the impact on civilians along the border. The conflict worsens Lebanon’s always-simmering instability and mounting economic problems, and Hezbollah risks taking the blame. Perhaps 75,000 Lebanese have fled southern Lebanon, with no immediate prospect of return: a similar political problem for Hezbollah to what Israel faces, with its displaced citizens, who are unlikely to return to their homes en masse as long as limited war continues. Finally, it is unclear whether a limited war would actually remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;option-4-coercive-diplomacy&quot;&gt;Option 4: Coercive Diplomacy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to use coercive diplomacy to compel Hezbollah to abide by UNSCR 1701. To this end, the United States, often represented by mediator Amos Hochstein, is using diplomacy to negotiate with Lebanese leaders, and thus indirectly with Hezbollah, while Israel is putting military pressure on the group through a mix of strikes on Hezbollah forces and leaders. The renewed threat of an all-out war gives this pressure additional strength. Hezbollah, however, does not want to be seen as surrendering to Israeli pressure, particularly at a time when Israeli attacks on Palestinians are dominating the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to ending Hezbollah attacks on Israel, the goal for Israel would be for Hezbollah to move its armed forces back, as promised under UNSCR 1701, to the Litani River. It is possible that Israel would also accept a less comprehensive withdrawal that moves Hezbollah farther back from the Israel-Lebanon border but not all the way to the Litani River. UNIFIL might need to be bolstered substantially and be far more aggressive in its use of force in response to any incursion, both of which would be difficult to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel, too, would be asked to make concessions and changes in response to UNSCR 1701 and to appease Hezbollah. Israel regularly violates Lebanese airspace, which Israel does to strike and monitor Hezbollah positions. Hezbollah would also likely seek an Israeli evacuation of Shebaa Farms and the village of Ghajar, perhaps placing them under UNIFIL so that the group could claim a political victory even as it made concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-the-crisis&quot;&gt;Managing the Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a high risk of conflict, Washington needs to step up efforts to prevent an all-out war (Option 2), which would have significant and negative implications for the United States at home, in the Middle East, and around the globe. Restoring deterrence (Option 1) and limited war (Option 3), while better from a U.S. perspective, both have their limits. Option 1 appears, at best, a temporary solution that could easily fall apart, while Option 3 could spiral into an all-out war and, even in limited form, could be disastrous for both Lebanon and Israel. The U.S. military is already overstretched in countering a range of threats, such as China in the Indo-Pacific, including around Taiwan and the South and East China Seas; North Korea, which is accelerating its conventional and nuclear capabilities and issuing provocative threats of nuclear conflict with South Korea; and Russia, which is waging an attrition war against Ukraine and developing land, air, naval, space, and cyber capabilities that threaten the United States and its allies. The U.S. defense industrial base is also overstretched. An all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah would likely require additional U.S. military assets — such as one or more carrier strike groups as well as fixed-wing aircraft, ISR platforms, and munitions — that are needed in other theaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A war could dramatically raise tensions with populations across the Middle East and beyond — including in the United States and Europe — and lead to increased attacks by Iranian-backed groups against Israel, the United States, and commercial targets in the region and littoral areas. U.S. forces in the region, already facing limited attacks from Iranian-backed groups, would likely face more frequent and larger strikes. Although the economic implications of the Gaza war have been limited, an all-out war would likely have significant implications on trade, supply chains, energy prices (including oil and gas), investment, and tourism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major war would also have significant humanitarian costs. Hezbollah’s rocket and missile systems put all of Israel under threat, and its ground forces are far more formidable than those of Hamas. Israel’s promise to devastate Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon as it has in Gaza is credible, and thousands could die in these attacks. Lebanon’s economy, already under severe strain, could collapse completely as hundreds of thousands of people are displaced and the country’s infrastructure is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the United States should focus its efforts on implementing a policy of coercive diplomacy (Option 4). There has been some movement toward negotiations. For example, U.S. officials like Amos Hochstein have made energetic efforts to restore stability and discussed a proposal that calls for the withdrawal of non-state armed actors from southern Lebanon, a deployment of Lebanese armed forces, and a development plan for southern Lebanon. In addition, France presented a three-step proposal to Israel, Lebanon’s government, and Hezbollah (and briefed it to the United States) that outlines a 10-day process of de-escalation and calls for Hezbollah to withdraw its fighters to a distance of about six miles (10 kilometers) from the border. Negotiations are critical, but they will not be easy. Hezbollah has formally rejected negotiating a de-escalation proposal until the war in Gaza ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. leadership will be important. As Henry Kissinger remarked, “One has to remember that every progress that has been made towards peace in the Middle East has come under American leadership.” Preventing an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah is likely the next test.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李宇軒指「重光團隊」組織鬆散 非所有成員支持制裁 共識是爭取香港自由民主&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/H20ee0I.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（20日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第49日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。李稱2019年9月美國參議員斯科特訪港，由於當時他籌辦過國際登報活動，又出席過聯合國人權理事會會議，「咁喺國際呢條線度做過嘢」，所以獲另一名被告陳梓華邀請會見斯科特。李指會面目的是提高對香港人權自由狀況的關注，「同埋當時 SWHK （重光團隊）有啲想做國際游說，去做一啲嘢去應對香港 deteriorating 嘅自由民主狀況。」李提到當天是他首次見到 Mark Simon，惟未曾與他直接傾談，後來才知道他是黎智英的得力助手。此外，李宇軒形容「重光團隊」是「一個鬆散嘅港人組織」，並非所有成員和活動都支持制裁，「我都唔同意 SWHK 係為咗制裁而去成立嘅一個組織」，並重申當時共識是爭取香港的自由民主。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第六天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供，由控方代表、副刑事檢控專員周天行作主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指重光團隊組織鬆散-不同活動論述或有不一致&quot;&gt;李宇軒指「重光團隊」組織鬆散 不同活動論述或有不一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;剛開始時，李宇軒主動提及昨日作供期間，有關「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong， SWHK）的描述，希望就此澄清。李表示：「我會話 SWHK 係一個鬆散嘅港人組織，一個 loose 嘅組織，至少一開始係咁。」他指SWHK並沒有一個會章或會員制度，不過有一個共識是 SWHK 會爭取當時香港的自由民主，而在特定活動中便會有支持該活動的人去參加，「所以可能會見到就住 SWHK 活動嗰陣，嗰個論述會有少少 inconsistent」，他表示會在稍後作供時就特定活動去憶述當時群組內的討論重點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指重光團隊非為呼籲制裁而成立-非全部成員支持制裁&quot;&gt;李宇軒指重光團隊非為呼籲制裁而成立 非全部成員支持制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，從這個角度去理解 SWHK 的活動，「所以我會同意一部份 SWHK members 同一部份 SWHK 嘅活動，係同制裁有關嘅，但係我唔同意全部嘅活動、全部嘅 members 都支持制裁。」李續指：「我都唔同意 SWHK 係為咗制裁而去成立嘅一個組織」，他重申有一個共識是爭取當時香港的自由民主，「而頭先講嘅制裁就係一個 means（手段），同意𠵱個 course of action 嘅 member 就同意咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指眾籌收支表中文版會用花巧言辭-例如制裁港共-以鼓勵人捐錢&quot;&gt;李宇軒指眾籌收支表中文版會用花巧言辭 例如「制裁港共」 以鼓勵人捐錢&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李提及昨日庭上展示的「重光團隊」網站截圖，有「全球登報制裁港共眾籌計劃」的收支報表，當時組員討論如何鼓勵其他人捐款，「我記得當時有𠵱個共識，就住中文版嚟講，flowery language（花巧的言辭）會比較容易鼓勵識睇嘅人捐錢」，而對於不懂中文或閱讀英文的人，「當時就覺得係比較用中性啲嘅字眼，就會比較容易 encourage 到人捐錢」，因此網站上公佈的收支報表，中英版本之間會有不一致的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問到，李所說的花巧言辭是哪些。李指「制裁港共」，與英文版的「Advocacy for Hong Kong」有出入。被問到「港共」的意思，李指這字眼是「形容香港政府與中共相關」，但並非意指香港政府就等如中共。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表黎智英的資深大律師彭耀鴻則提議，「港共」的英文翻譯可以是「Hong Kong Communists」。李同意這譯法接近「港共」的原本意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到「港共」一詞想帶出什麼訊息，李指即是香港政權與共產政權有關，暗示共產黨。他又指，雖然當時字眼沒有提及「中共」，但當時覺得「港共」相比起「香港」是一個帶較強烈感情（more charged）的描述，可用以呼籲人們捐錢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認他曾管理重光團隊網站&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認他曾管理「重光團隊」網站&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及「重光團隊」網站是何時設立。李表示不記得，因為若果沒記錯的話，網站應該是由一名叫 Kirin Bumper 的人設立，而他在後來才被加入管理網站。不過他當時並沒有在網站編輯或發布過任何內容，直至後來 Kirin Bumper 打算將網站完全交給李和其他組員管理，李相信可翻查網頁編輯紀錄來得知相關日子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「重光團隊」的事務由誰管理，李指「由組員一齊傾」，負責執行活動的人則是大家透過共識來決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示由李宇軒製作的「G攬運動」收支報表和李的花旗銀行戶口紀錄，顯示在2020年2月28日，有一筆約42萬元美金（約327萬港元）的款項歸還給李，而轉帳人是「Project Hong Kong Trust」的美國 Amalgamated Bank 帳戶。李確認他當時要求 Project Hong Kong Trust 歸還他曾墊支的款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指-mark-simon-歸還款項條數唔夾-惟陳梓華未安排歸還差額&quot;&gt;李宇軒指 Mark Simon 歸還款項「條數唔夾」 惟陳梓華未安排歸還差額&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又指，「G攬運動」收支報表可見三筆交易，金額分別為40萬、約33萬和約46.9萬美元，分別在2019年11月4日、2020年1月7日和2月3日，由「Funder 2」轉帳至「Project Hong Kong Trust」戶口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李解釋，這三筆款項是 Mark Simon 將眾籌款項轉帳給「Project Hong Kong Trust」，因為 Mark Simon 較早前借出銀行戶口替「G攬運動」接收和「hold 住」眾籌款項，直至後來「Project Hong Kong Trust」準備好銀行戶口，Mark Simon 便歸還眾籌款項。而 Mark Simon 屬於「T（陳梓華）嗰邊」，換言之「Funder 2」即是代表「T（陳梓華）嗰邊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，上述三筆 Mark Simon 歸還的款項總和是120萬美元，惟網站公佈的「G攬運動」收支報表顯示，代號「Funder 2」的 Mark Simon 接收了約177.2萬元美金，兩筆數有差距。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李解釋，因為「T（陳梓華）嗰邊」曾經墊支登報費用，所以這部份款項不需要歸還，若 Mark Simon 把眾籌款項扣除墊支了的登報費，便當作是直接發還了開支。不過李指，若將 Mark Simon的 三筆還款加上墊支費用，總數不是相等於177.2萬元美金，他曾就此問題與陳梓華商討，「就話條數唔夾，其實應該有多啲嘅錢畀返 Project Hong Kong Trust。」他並製作了收支報表，要求陳安排歸還差額。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指相關款項是大約一萬或者幾萬元美金，不會多於10萬元美金，當時陳僅回覆「佢會搞」，但以李所知，陳並沒有安排歸還欠款。李指由於 Project Hong Kong Trust 帳戶非由他控制，「所以到最尾我唔清楚有冇多咗錢入去個戶口⋯⋯ in any event，至少T（陳梓華）冇同我講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指群組成員就是否籌辦第四次登報意見不一-最終決定不登報-部份人因而離開群組&quot;&gt;李宇軒指群組成員就是否籌辦第四次登報意見不一 最終決定不登報 部份人因而離開群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李供稱，第三次眾籌及登報的「G攬運動」中，錄得大約一半餘款，當時在其中一個「G攬」群組中，組員關注若果任由剩下的款項原封不動，便可能引來懷疑或指控「G攬嗰度會唔會落格」，大家曾經作出討論，有人認為籌辦多一次登報便可花費剩下的款項，也有人質疑登報是否爭取香港自由民主的最好方法。李指組員最終決定不籌辦多一次登報，但同時沒有其他活動方案，「就真係由得啲錢擺喺度，睇吓嚟緊有咩想做、有咩值得去做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，在上述討論尾聲「咁就有個 split」，有一部份同意不登報的組員，便繼續留在群組中；「而覺得淨係想登報嘅嗰啲人，就離開咗個『G攬』team」，因為該些人想辦多一次登報，「而你哋決定唔繼續做，所以佢哋就走。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，該些想登報的人離開群組之後，在大約2019年10月1日前後籌辦了一個「賀你老母」的眾籌登報計劃，不過他並沒有參與其中。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指2019年底g攬和重光團隊整合&quot;&gt;李宇軒指2019年底「G攬」和「重光團隊」整合&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，在群組成員討論期間，他和網名「T」的陳梓華均不同意進行第四次登報。二人曾經一度離開群組，但在實務層面考慮，如果李和陳都離開群組的話，未來的登報計劃便會面臨財政壓力，因為未必有另一個人能夠墊支廣告費用，「唔知係咪因為咁樣，定係後來大家共識係唔再登報」，結果群組成員決定不籌辦登報，之後李便重新被加入群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李憶述，他重新加入群組之後，曾經有一段時間，群組成員之中有部分人認同「G攬」團隊的身份，同時也有部份人認同「重光團隊」的身份，不過當時沒有迫切性去處理這個形式問題。李指，以他所理解，反而「攬炒巴」劉祖廸等人在英國當地舉辦公開活動、印製橫額或會見國會議員時，他們會逐漸使用「重光團隊」的口號和標誌。不過直到大約2019年底，「G攬」和「重光團隊」有進行整合，並將一些合併了的群組重新命名為「重光團隊」，但實際上的日常運作與之前並沒有分別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱2019年831曾與英議員bob-seely晚飯-談論香港狀況&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱2019年8.31曾與英議員Bob Seely晚飯 談論香港狀況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示「重光團隊」網站公佈的工作匯報，其中一項提到「成功邀請 Bob Seely MP 於8月31日到港觀察示威」。李憶述，在2019年8月31日之前，「攬炒巴」透過 Telegram 告知他英國國會議員 Bob Seely 想來港觀察示威，希望香港方面會有人接應，於是李宇軒、前學民思潮成員李宗澤（Wilson Li）和其他人一同幫忙。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒記得李宗澤負責大部份流程相關的工作，而他曾經與 Bob Seely、李宗澤和其他人，在銅鑼灣一間酒店食晚飯，期間向 Bob Seely 談論有關香港發生的事。李續指，「唔知係 Wilson 定係另一啲人，咁就帶 Bob Seely 落咗場去睇示威，因為嗰晚附近都有出咗 tear gas。」而李宇軒則沒有落場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，帶 Bob Seely 觀察示威現場的目的是什麼。李指：「Bob Seely 佢想親身用佢對眼去睇香港發生咩事，咁當時香港一啲街頭示威，以當時嘅香港嚟講，係比較重要嘅事，所以 Bob Seely 就去咗睇示威喇。」控方問是否關於香港當時的社會動亂（social unrest）。李則表示：「我諗我會總結做當時香港嘅自由同民主」，又指：「啲人對於當時人權自由狀況有好多不滿，所以有好多 street demonstration。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;有關是次接見 Bob Seely 想達到什麼目標，李指為了幫助「攬炒巴嗰邊」接見 Bob Seely，然後 Bob Seely 回到英國後，「就可以繼續 whatever 佢同攬炒巴搞緊嘅嘢」，而相關工作整體而言是有關提高對香港民主自由的關注，惟李對二人之間的具體工作並不清楚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，有關是次會見 Bob Seely 的支出，他向第二次眾籌的「中英聯合聲明登報」計劃報銷費用，因為是次會見與英國有關。他並指，款額「我諗應該唔夠幾萬蚊港紙」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰留意到工作匯報所使用的字眼是「成功邀請 Bob Seely MP」，意味 Bob Seely 是受邀，而非主動提出來港。惟李宇軒稱他不知道事前 Bob Seely 與「攬炒巴」是如何溝通，因此他不會揣測「成功邀請」一詞的意思，他亦不知道 Bob Seely 來港的主意是由誰人主動提出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就李宗澤的身份，李宇軒形容「佢好似對於 book 機票、酒店好熟悉」，但他除了是次接見 Bob Seely 和後來的區議會監選團之外，「平時喺 SWHK 同『G攬』嗰度，係完全見唔到佢嘅」，因此他理解李宗澤並不是任何一個團隊的成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱成立香港故事公司-為處理籌款和參與社運名義問題&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱成立「香港故事」公司 為處理籌款和參與社運名義問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到，公司註冊處紀錄顯示李宇軒在2019年9月9日註冊「香港故事有限公司」，而李是首任董事兼創辦成員。李稱除他自己之外，公司便沒有牽涉其他人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就成立公司的原因，李解釋上次眾籌遇到提取款項的問題，他曾經與陳梓華討論是否需要成立一間有限責任公司（Limited Liability Company）。李亦留意到提款時牽涉了一些個人戶口，例如他自己的戶口，或非社運團體的的戶口，於是考慮開設一個社運團體的銀行戶口。李又表示，「既然我已經用咗真身份去做眾籌眾籌活動，咁就會唔會⋯⋯接住落嚟我會唔會用真身份去做 activist activities 呢？」他考慮：「如果係嘅話，會係 under 咩 activist organisation 呢？」，其中一個選項便是「我直情起一個 activist organisation 出嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，他與陳梓華商討之後，有共識去研究上述議題，最終開設了「香港故事」這間公司。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過李補充，後來這間公司實際上並未能處理到上述議題，因為隨著「Project Hong Kong Trust」的銀行戶口成立，可以用來處理眾籌款項，所以沒有需要用到「香港故事」的戶口。至於「香港故事」作為一個社運身份，李則認為「SWHK 作為一個 pseudo organisation，佢係更加有效」，所以後來派卡片也是直接使用「重光團隊」的卡片。例如他在2019年尾會見美國參議員 Marsha Blackburn、斯科特（Rick Scott）、Todd Young 和共和黨議員克魯茲（Ted Cruz）的時候，便是使用「重光團隊」的卡片，而沒有使用「香港故事」的卡片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱曾以香港故事身份會見聯合國人權事務高級專員&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱曾以「香港故事」身份會見聯合國人權事務高級專員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問「香港故事」曾經進行什麼活動。李指他在2019年8月的時候，曾赴聯合國會見 Sébastien Gillioz，即聯合國人權事務高級專員辦事處（OHCHR）中負責亞太地區的職員，當時使用了「香港故事」的身份。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李憶述相關背景，有一名叫「Sheep」的人士是聯合國的職員，在2019年8月中旬，「Sheep」告知他聯合國人權事務高級專員辦事處發表一份關注香港自由民主狀況的聲明，「佢話呢個好唔尋常，因為有史以來淨係出過兩個同香港有關嘅聲明」，所以是次聲明意味「OHCHR 都重視嗰陣時香港嘅狀況」，即有關民主、自由和示威。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續轉述「Sheep」告訴他，聯合國人權理事會（United Nations Human Rights Council）將於2019年9月在日內瓦舉行會議，如果想準備參與會議，便最好事前去聯絡 Sébastien Gillioz，因為他在 OHCHR 裡是負責中國事務的人之一。因此李便在8月赴日內瓦會見 Sébastien Gillioz，以了解當時 OHCHR 如何看香港發生的情況，同行人士還有天文物理學家 Shirley Ho 和一名叫 Adder 的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李提到會見 Sébastien Gillioz 時，他們得悉OHCHR的職員並不滿意當時中國代表團所聲稱「development based 嘅 human right」。惟當李想進一步解釋時，法官杜麗冰打斷指，現在只需要了解相關事件背景，而不是審判在聯合國的游說工作，因此不需要詳述。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李總結指，經過8月的會面後，他便預備資料去9月的聯合國人權理事會會議，又開設 Telegram 群組「地球香港分部」，成員包括他、「Sheep」和「我要做飯」，以討論9月的旅程。李並指曾經與陳梓華談論過此事，「佢亦都支持我去聯合國。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;因會見美議員-李宇軒與mark-simon被加入同一群組&quot;&gt;因會見美議員 李宇軒與Mark Simon被加入同一群組&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示 WhatsApp 群組「Coffee on Sunday」，紀錄顯示陳梓華於2019年9月29日創立群組，當時群組成員有陳、李和 Mark Simon。李解釋，陳梓華當時問他會否會見美國參議員斯科特（Rick Scott），「我話OK」，然後陳便把他加進群組。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;群組顯示 Mark Simon 傳送訊息，指美國參議員斯科特正身處香港，問李和陳是否有空會見。Mark Simon 其後表示會加入斯科特的助手 Scott Sciretta 及美國領事職員 Alan Brinker。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，在加入群組之前，他對於 Mark Simon 沒有任何認知，也不知 Mark Simon 將會一同會見斯科特。李表示，看過群組討論之後，「其後我知道佢（Mark Simon）係T（陳梓華）同黎智英嗰邊嘅」，也是收取 GoFundMe 款項及之後轉移去 Project Hong Kong Trust 戶口的人士。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李何以知道 Mark Simon 與黎智英有關，李表示加入群組時並不知道，「後來唔記得喺邊度定報紙，話 Mark Simon 就係黎智英嘅 right hand man（得力助手）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱會見美議員時談及香港示威-希望美國政府可以做啲嘢&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱會見美議員時談及香港示威 「希望美國政府可以做啲嘢」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問為何李會被邀請會見斯科特。李表示，因為當時他籌辦過國際登報活動，又出席過聯合國人權理事會會議，「咁喺國際呢條線度做過嘢，所以就想我去見 Rick Scott 喇。」他指會面目的是提高對香港人權自由狀況的關注，「同埋當時 SWHK 有啲想做國際游說，去做一啲嘢去應對香港 deteriorating 嘅自由民主狀況。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過李提到，當時眾人未有任何共識提出實質方案，所以當時共識是先提高關注，之後才「去做一啲嘢」，「就係希望美國去做一啲嘢」來應對香港的狀況。李續指，因此他會見議員時，僅使用一些很籠統的字眼，例如「希望美國政府採取行動」之類。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就會見議員的討論內容，李指另一位同行的「Cath」描述她在示威前線見到的場景，另外「我亦都簡單講咗香港人眾籌運動，同埋希望美國政府可以做啲嘢，同埋佢（Rick Scott）作為一個參議員，佢可以做啲嘢咁」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱當天的會面是他首次見到同場的 Mark Simon，惟他並未與 Mark Simon 有任何直接交談，「我淨係記得佢係肥肥地。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers are striving to understand the use, associated risks and benefits of AI technologies. The technologies are developing at pace and often involve highly technical details. Coumpounded by the persistent hype around AI, this complexity can make it challenging for non-specialists to understand AI’s impact, including in a geopolitical context. Yet, the need to respond to disruptive technological developments is not new: International Relations scholarship has often provided useful tools, frameworks or concepts to understand how such changes impact interstate relations. Can policymakers turn to such scholarship to provide valid analytical tools to better understand AI’s impact on geopolitics? This workshop report summarises the discussion of 10 scholars, debating what impact AI has on geopolitics, whether there is a need for a new analytical framework to capture AI’s impact on international relations, and what we can learn from other technologies and their respective impact on geopolitical developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2023, RUSI hosted an invitation-only workshop to discuss whether there is a genuine need for a new analytical framework in International Relations scholarship to grasp AI’s impact on geopolitics. RUSI convened a deliberately small number of leading International Relations scholars working on AI and other technologies to discuss the impact of AI on international relations, what can be learned from previous technological inventions on the interplay of technology and international relations, and whether a new framework or concept to analyse AI’s impact on geopolitics is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop included 10 scholars and was chaired by Anthony Finkelstein, President of City, University of London, and a RUSI Distinguished Fellow. In addition to the findings from the workshop itself, invited participants were asked to fill out a survey in advance of the workshop (please see the Annex for the survey questions). Of the 10 participants who attended the workshop, six provided a survey response. An additional two responses were provided by those who were invited but did not attend. This workshop report relies on the contributions from both the survey and the workshop. All views expressed in the workshop and the survey are non-attributable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI technologies, their risks and opportunities, as well as their regulation and ethical challenges, are highly debated topics in UK policy circles. This is particularly the case since the launch of the UK National AI Strategy, setting out the aim of making the UK an “AI superpower”, and in the context of the UK AI Safety Summit held in November 2023. Policymakers in the UK increasingly turn to questions of AI benefits, implications and risks, including its relationship with foreign affairs and international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too often, however, it is difficult for policymakers and non-technicians to grasp AI’s novel implications for familiar fields like International Relations. This is partially due to the knowledge gap on how AI technology works and how it will develop. This gap exists between technology experts and those in the social sciences and policy circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are the tools and methods currently available adequate to frame and explain AI’s impact on international relations? Or are new ones required to capture AI’s implications for interstate relations? Only where there are adequate methods to understand and communicate such impact will non-technicians and policymakers be appropriately equipped to grasp and communicate the implications that follow from AI technologies for international relations. These might be considered decisively different or similar to those of existing technologies. Reaching such understanding is, of course, a necessary pre-condition for policymakers to design effective policy interventions for AI technologies that will allow countries such as the UK to secure a strategic advantage from AI by harnessing its advantages and mitigating any arising risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academic scholarship can provide suitable and widely applied frameworks and concepts to understand technologies’ impact on international relations – such as, for example, deterrence theory as it applies to nuclear weapons and their impact on international relations during the Cold War. Even where such theory’s ability to accurately capture a technology’s impact on international relations is debatable, it can nevertheless serve as a starting point of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI technologies are not a completely new topic in social sciences and International Relations. That said, the recent trend has certainly led to more academic attention to AI. Whereas much academic discussion has traditionally focused on ethical implications of so-called “killer robots” and the use of AI by lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS), scholars in the social sciences are now expanding their research to include areas such as AI governance and AI-enabled disinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RUSI’s workshop included International Relations scholars working on the implications of AI, or other technologies such as space or nuclear technologies, for international relations. Participants were invited to discuss three subject areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;AI’s impact on geopolitics (Part One).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What can be learned from the way International Relations theory and scholarship has explained previous technological inventions (Part Two).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether a new framework is needed to conceptualise AI’s impact on international relations (Part Three).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-one-ais-impact-on-geopolitics-and-international-relations&quot;&gt;Part One: AI’s Impact on Geopolitics and International Relations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was widespread agreement that AI has a noticeable and manifold impact on international relations as well as International Relations scholarship – not least because states are addressing issues of AI governance and risk management. The impacts have also been felt as AI potentially has an effect on interstate power dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of how AI impacts geopolitical dynamics included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Applications in the military domain, including strategic stability, the laws and ethics of war, and the public perception of warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increased danger of digital authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Work in diplomacy, such as efficiency of consular work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Normative challenges to existing values and considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The race to be leading AI development, research and implementation, including through data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The perceived need for international governance of AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;narrowing-down-what-and-when-constitutes-impact&quot;&gt;Narrowing Down What and When Constitutes “Impact”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants repeatedly debated the timeframe that applies to the question of AI’s impacts on geopolitics. The contemporary landscape differs from potential future scenarios given the rapid development of AI technologies. The assessment of what kind of development to expect and the capabilities AI technologies may develop, however, strongly depends on the taken approach: tech-optimist or doomsday scenario. The timeline envisaged is also relevant. One participant pointed out that “the actual impacts in the short, mid- and long term are somewhat unclear”. Even the question of what timeframe constitutes “the future” or “long term” is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timeline considerations also tied to questions on whether to focus on long-term, potentially existential, risks that largely rely on speculation or to focus on AI’s contemporary impact and potential harm. One academic pointed out that this discussion was now highly politicised, tied to narratives of US–China competition and other broader trends. They argued, however, that long- and short-term impact cannot be disintegrated so easily but that these questions are instead closely tied to political considerations underlying them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political implications that follow from the narrative of distinguishing between long- and short-term impact were picked up by other participants. One scholar argued that such distinction is not contradictory. Nonetheless, it is vital to bridge the gap between various communities, each focusing on different types of risks (for example, the national security community and the military community).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially when discussing long-term and existential risk of AI technologies, academics stressed the need to consider where the information underlying assumptions comes from. Who circulates what information with what kind of intentions? What vision of technology are they trying to sell? One participant found that this increased politicisation is making their job harder. Another academic also pointed to the lack of diversity among many technology companies. Many of these companies hold a lot of information and knowledge. They shape the discourse on the impact of AI, especially when it comes to discussing potential long-term and existential risks. They may do so in a one-sided way. Another participant added that technology companies often even determine what is labelled as AI, thereby holding additional power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these points on the different perspectives, the timeframe applied and the information underlying any assumptions shape the understanding of AI’s impact on geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-approach-of-international-relations-scholarship-to-ai&quot;&gt;The Approach of International Relations Scholarship to AI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion identified several areas of the impact of AI on geopolitics that are – to varying degrees – addressed in International Relations scholarship. For example, one participant’s introductory remarks argued that International Relations scholars primarily address the impact of AI by focusing on four areas of study. First, the influence of AI on the balance of power is primarily addressed in areas such as war studies or strategic studies. Second, issues of AI governance are analysed by a more diverse set of scholars driven by a shared sense that some form of global AI governance is needed. Third, the same scholar further remarked that ethics questions are often primarily looked at within a military context but should be considered more broadly. Finally, disinformation and social media are widely discussed in International Relations scholarship, particularly considering the impact of deepfakes, but research in this area is often inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion on AI’s impact on geopolitics underlined the implications that different framings have, whether on the temporal framework applied, the community and the political environment that discusses AI’s impact on international relations, or the source of information such assessment is based on in the first place. These challenges, particularly the question of timeframes, were raised throughout all stages of the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-two-learning-from-other-technologies&quot;&gt;Part Two: Learning from Other Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI technologies are by no means the first technological invention to impact international relations. From nuclear to space, and military inventions to maritime technologies, technology impacts many areas of interstate relations. Workshop participants therefore also debated how far AI technologies and their impact on geopolitics resemble that of other technologies or whether they pose unique, unprecedented challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-different-is-ai-from-previous-technological-inventions&quot;&gt;How Different is AI from Previous Technological Inventions?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessments of how far AI is “a gamechanger” differed among the participants. Again, varying timeframes applied to the question. On the one hand, some considered that AI, at least in the current context, primarily amplified existing challenges or power dynamics without fundamentally challenging interstate relations. Some participants tied the impact of AI on international relations to other technologies (for example, to quantum sensing or information communication infrastructure [ICT] and cyber technologies), pointing to possible similarities and interdependencies. One participant also argued that “AI has far more in common with earlier technological inventions than is often implied in the existing literature”, at least in its current form. This could, in theory, change if artificial general intelligence comes into existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some participants found that the impact of AI is already groundbreaking. They stressed its ability to replace human factors as – unlike other technologies – it is a decision-making technology with “a degree of agency”. AI’s ability to not just replace motor skills – as was the case with previous technologies – but also “chiefly cognitive skills” was perceived as a decisive difference. As such, AI has the ability to change the quality of decision-making, with implications for the nature of international society and relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More abstractly, as International Relations as a discipline concerns the study of interstate relations, not humans, AI fundamentally challenges this assumption, according to one discussant. Here lies the challenge to International Relations as a discipline. At the same time, it can also add to the discourse: while computer scientists focus on individual intelligence, International Relations scholars focus on collective social intelligence because the discipline is the study of groups, not the individual. As such, the field’s scholarship can make a meaningful contribution to often technology-dominated discussions on how the impact of AI on international relations is understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-lessons-were-learned-from-other-technologies-and-their-impact-on-international-relations&quot;&gt;What Lessons Were Learned from Other Technologies and Their Impact on International Relations?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On lessons learned from other disciplines, including on how to deal with increased hype around new technological inventions, one participant remarked that in the area of space technology, camps form around “futurists” and those paying more attention to contemporary developments. While futurists primarily focus on potential technological inventions in the more distant future, possibly developed by engineers without guiding policy and strategy, those who are perhaps more grounded in pragmatism focus on the technologies that are actually being deployed. The participant remarked that a lesson learned from the space context is to “look away from the shiny stuff” and instead focus on where mass investments are being made and mass adoption is being advanced. A similar shift in attention in an AI context would contribute to moving away from the contemporary hype around AI and to guide non-technicians in navigating the technological landscape and seeing the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting lessons were also drawn in comparison to the development of nuclear technologies. A participant noted that the ownership of the development of AI – unlike that of nuclear weapons – lies with technology companies rather than states. This, for them, challenges the state-centric assumptions often underlying International Relations theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another comparison was made to the nuclear domain. Like the sanctions there, one participant expected future geopolitical considerations on AI development would likely include further sanctioning of semiconductors. This is already a powerful tool of US foreign and technology policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others stressed that AI technologies cannot be seen in isolation and that they do “not exist in a social vacuum”. Instead, AI technologies must be seen as a collection of technologies which are also linked to broader questions such as supply chain issues or labour market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While participants’ observations of how far AI technologies constitute a game changer or resemble previous technologies’ impact on international relations differed, some interesting parallels and differences were drawn. These highlighted the value of situating our understanding of AI in the broader context, both in relation to parallel political developments and dynamics around other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-three-applying-existing-theories-and-frameworks-to-ai-and-the-need-for-a-new-concept&quot;&gt;Part Three: Applying Existing Theories and Frameworks to AI and the Need for a New Concept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of the workshop, participants were asked to place themselves on a spectrum ranging from “no new framework needed” to “new framework needed” to analyse AI’s impact on geopolitics (see Figure 1 for a rough indication). The allocations are merely indicators replicated from a whiteboard in the room and do not follow a scientific measurement. Nevertheless, they provide an overview of the different sentiments represented during the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cjRyzgR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Do We Need a New Framework to Understand AI’s Impact on Geopolitics?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-need-for-a-new-framework-to-capture-the-impact-of-ai-on-international-relations&quot;&gt;The Need for a New Framework to Capture the Impact of AI on International Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in Figure 1, participants offered a wide range of perspectives and arguments on whether a new analytical framework in International Relations scholarship is needed to adequately capture and explain the impact of AI on international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some thought that a new framework is needed to go beyond the descriptions of aspects of AI’s impact offered by existing theories and concepts. A new framework would especially need to address AI’s ability to perform cognitive tasks and its impact on political decision-making. One participant also deemed a new framework necessary to move away from the dominant perception of AI as an arms race between big powers, overlooking smaller and medium states as well as private technology companies, which are at the heart of AI development. Whether such a new framework would rely on existing concepts that needed updating and enhancing, including from an interdisciplinary perspective, or whether a new, comprehensive theory should be developed remained subject to debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others pointed to the many theories of International Relations scholarship that already apply to technological inventions more broadly. For example, the framing of the governance and technology lag, describing how technology develops faster than its respective governance, applies to an AI context. Another participant pointed to critical norm theory as a way to build on existing theoretical thinking on how AI technologies shape international norms. For specific areas such as trade and international political economy, the new trade theory was named as an example of an existing theory, adding insights to AI’s impact on geopolitics. Similarly, the theory of organisational reputation was given as an example of how an existing theory can “provide insights into why agencies react to and regulate disruptive innovations”. One scholar added that existing concepts from other disciplines such as neuroscience, psychology and philosophy are also useful tools in contributing to explaining AI’s impact on international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;one-theory-to-rule-them-all&quot;&gt;One Theory to Rule Them All?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion arguing in favour of one new concept or against it was far from binary. Instead, it was often a matter of the degree to which existing theories can adequately capture AI’s impact. Participants further questioned whether there can be one theory to address AI’s impact on international relations in the first place. While one participant pointed out that the big theories – realism, constructivism and institutionalism – each offer “valuable insights into AI and the impact it may have on geopolitics”, others stressed the move away from “the big ‘isms’”. Instead, there are many more nuanced, mid-level theories aiming to address aspects of International Relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one scholar argued that “no single theory, concept or framework can comprehensively and adequately describe, analyse and reflect on the various impacts of AI. Each theory in International Relations can, however, illuminate certain aspects, risks and opportunities of AI, but none can on its own discuss, analyse and reflect on it in a comprehensive manner”. Others agreed, stating that they did not think “that one single theory, concept or framework can fully capture the impact of AI technologies as they all have their own comparative strengths and weaknesses. For this reason, a multiple theory, concept or framework is the most analytically productive”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some noted that a comprehensive approach would be desirable to accomplish a new, overarching theory, acknowledging the tremendous challenge of developing such a theory. Others argued in favour of basing work on existing theories and updating them in line with new developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-tool-for-what-purpose&quot;&gt;What Tool for What Purpose?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussions on the need of a new framework or theory repeatedly linked back to questions of purpose, scope and intention. Participants discussed both what aspect of AI technologies a concrete framework should focus on but also what the purpose of International Relations scholarship is more fundamentally. Again, defining purpose also tied to the question of timeframes – whether a new theory would address the impact of AI on international relations now or in the future. One participant argued that, as it stands, existing concepts “have a lot to say” but that it is harder to predict future developments and how existing concepts would be able to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to the purpose of a new framework, participants asked why a framework is needed, and whether it is to better understand AI’s impact on geopolitics as opposed to drawing attention to previously unnoticed phenomena. One participant argued that, in some sense, International Relations scholarship “had a technology problem” – while technology was part of many considerations, it was never conceptualised as such. This status quo is now challenged, as new developments in AI technology arguably have the potential to fundamentally challenge how International Relations theories work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This linked to the broader and fundamental question of the purpose of International Relations theory. Participants critically discussed whether it is the purpose of International Relations theory to predict the future; a challenge some considered too great given that the “past and present are already difficult enough” to conceptualise. Others felt that it is indeed the idea of the discipline to predict geopolitics but that it has also been historically poor at doing so. This also raised the question of how far International Relations theory is contributing to preventing war or harm and whether that is its purpose and, if so, whether it needs to get better at doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, how International Relations scholars understand their discipline and interpret existing theories heavily influenced their assessment of whether a new framework is necessary or feasible and, if so, what purpose it might serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop identified that whether participants considered a new framework necessary to adequately capture AI’s impact on international relations was influenced by three key factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What experts considered AI’s impact to be in the first place – and how unprecedented they found it compared to previous technological inventions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How far they believed existing theories in various fields can capture such impact and whether a single theory could ever do so.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Experts’ assessment of how useful existing theories are also depended on what they considered the objective and purpose of both a new theory and International Relations scholarship more widely to be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conversation repeatedly returned to themes such as the applicable timeframe to define the impact of AI, the definition of AI, and the bias of available information and their implications on scholars’ understanding of AI. These factors, the assessment of which varied depending on participants’ areas of specialism, were often considered underlying questions that need to be answered before a suitable framework can be developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further research could provide a fuller and more systematic understanding of AI’s impact on geopolitics but also help identify concrete examples of how far existing theories already capture various aspects of the impact of AI on geopolitics. Research could also provide a more detailed analysis of parallels and differences between AI and previous technologies and their impact on international relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What impact do AI technologies have on international relations?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To what extent does this resemble or differ from previous technological inventions?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Can existing theory, concepts or frameworks in your field adequately describe the impact of AI technologies? (Please expand and include field and theory.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If applying existing theories does not work, why not? And what do new analytical frameworks need to offer to successfully reflect the impact of AI technologies on geopolitics?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;美加登報廣告促制裁及禁售武器予港警 李宇軒：由不同人設計、有關香港民主自由&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ELaCoJi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（19日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第48日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。就2019年8月的第三次眾籌即「G攬運動」，庭上展示的加拿大《環球郵報》和《紐約時報》國際版廣告，分別促請加國和美國政府禁止出售武器給香港警方，又呼籲美國讀者促請議員動議通過《香港人權與民主法案》。其中一份匯款紀錄顯示西班牙《世界報》的廣告費由 Lais Hotel Property Limited 繳付，根據控方開案陳詞，該公司由 Mark Simon 持有或控制。另外，李確認截至2020年5月，「G攬運動」錄得餘款約69.8萬美元（約546萬港元），而這筆錢之後用在「各地有關 support 香港自由民主嘅活動」，即有關「重光團隊」的活動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指曾與陳梓華討論在美國成立公司來收取眾籌款項&quot;&gt;李宇軒指曾與陳梓華討論在美國成立公司來收取眾籌款項&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第五天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。李昨日供稱，在2019年8月第三次眾籌活動期間，他和「攬炒巴」劉祖廸等人成立「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong），並以此團體名義在各地登報。就他們所籌得的180萬美元，李稱在另一名被告陳梓華的協助下，找來了黎智英的私人助手 Mark Simon 借出美國的銀行戶口收取眾籌款項，然後轉帳至「Project Hong Kong Trust」的戶口。李並指當時 Mark Simon 要求在美國成立一個基金來保管眾籌款項，需要找美國公民來擔任受託人，以減少香港銀行凍結款項的風險。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方今展示從李宇軒電腦檢取的電郵紀錄，可見在2019年9月6日至17日期間，李和網名「T」的陳梓華經電郵與眾籌平台職員溝通，提及第一次提取眾籌款項時，銀行「啷住咗」相關帳目，於是轉用另一人的戶口來收款。李表示當時他並未有留意第二名收款人的身份。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李供稱，當時他和陳梓華有討論過考慮在美國成立一間公司，以其銀行戶口來收取眾籌款項，因此曾經問眾籌平台的職員是否可行。在2019年9月10日的電郵中，李問職員可否選擇提供一個「責任有限公司」（Limited Liability Company, LLC）的銀行帳戶來收款。在翌日的電郵中，職員表示這方案是可行，要求李提供相關公司名稱和負責人身份，又問「Freedom Hong Kong」會否考慮在美國成立一間「責任有限公司」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳梓華電郵傳送mark-simon作為收款人資料-李宇軒當時未留意收款人資料&quot;&gt;陳梓華電郵傳送Mark Simon作為收款人資料 李宇軒：當時未留意收款人資料&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後在9月17日，陳梓華向眾籌平台職員傳送電郵，內容含有收款人 Mark Simon 的資料，包括法律上名稱（Legal Name）「Mark H Simon」、地址、電話號碼、銀行戶口資料等。相關電郵同時副本抄送至李的電郵。李表示，他當時並沒有留意收款人的法律地位（legal status），因為只要陳梓華和眾籌平台能夠將款項轉移至收款人的銀行戶口，便能夠處理到問題，後來他才知道當時陳梓華找了 Mark Simon 介入。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，李早前供稱在美國參議員斯科特（Rick Scott）訪港時，有安排他會見斯科特，並介紹 Mark Simon 給他認識，而上述陳梓華的電郵寫有 Mark Simon 的資料，問李當時陳梓華是否已經向他介紹了 Mark Simon。李則表示，視乎會見斯科特的時間是在上述電郵之前，還是之後，因為當時他並未有將會見參議員和提取眾籌款項的事宜「link up 埋一齊」，但他可以確認在2019年9月時已獲介紹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年9月17日的電郵顯示，李向眾籌平台職員確認 Mark Simon 是收款人，並籲職員與陳梓華和 Mark 合作處理提取款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;單據顯示lais-hotel-墊支西班牙報紙廣告費18500歐元&quot;&gt;單據顯示Lais Hotel 墊支西班牙報紙廣告費18,500歐元&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第三次眾籌的登報廣告，控方指收支表顯示廣告支出合共為633.7萬港元，而李昨日供稱陳梓華等人墊支了約300萬元，其他廣告費則全部由李墊支，由此推論李墊支了約270萬元。李表示：「大概。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方繼而展示由西班牙報紙《世界報》（El Mundo）發出的發票，顯示廣告費為18,500歐元。李供稱當時相關費用由「T（陳梓華）嗰邊」墊支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂展示匯款收據，顯示上述費用由 Lais Hotel Property Limited 在2019年8月16日支付。李確認，並指這收據是陳梓華交給他的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;電郵紀錄顯示周庭曾就登廣告聯絡日經新聞&quot;&gt;電郵紀錄顯示周庭曾就登廣告聯絡《日經新聞》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《日經新聞》的廣告，控方展示一封由《日經》傳送給前「香港眾志」成員周庭的電郵，附件有一個發票檔案，顯示廣告費為2,040萬日圓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李供稱，當時「T（陳梓華）嗰邊」早於8月15日從加拿大匯款繳付了《日經新聞》廣告費，大約為147萬港元，但是由於國際交易需時數個工作日，所以《日經新聞》趕不及在廣告刊登的日子（8月19日）之前收到該筆款項，李遂先以現金額外支付約147萬港元的廣告費，作為臨時方案，待《日經新聞》收到加拿大的匯款之後，便會將多付的款項還給李。李指這做法可以確保《日經新聞》在廣告刊登之前收到廣告費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指李的銀行紀錄顯示，李於8月16日從銀行戶口提款約147萬港元，李確認之後以現金向《日經新聞》支付廣告費。控方並展示支票入帳紀錄，顯示以支票向李退還合共約147萬港元，李確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指陳梓華等相關人士墊支英國瑞典德國和韓國報章的廣告費&quot;&gt;李宇軒指陳梓華等相關人士墊支英國、瑞典、德國和韓國報章的廣告費&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示由一間英國媒體公司所發出的發票，顯示分別於《旗幟晚報》（Evening Standard）、《泰晤士報》（The Times）、《衛報》（The Guardian）、英國《時代》雜誌（Time）、The Week、City A.M.和《經濟學人》（Economist UK），合共7份報紙和雜誌刊登廣告，費用合共約12萬英鎊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又展示匯款紀錄，顯示某人將加拿大貨幣轉換至12萬英鎊，並繳付了上述廣告費。李指這張單據是「T（陳梓華）嗰邊」交給他，「就話英國嗰條數找咗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，李宇軒確認庭上展示的瑞典、德國和韓國報章的廣告費發票、匯款紀錄等，均由「T（陳梓華）嗰邊」交給他，詳情如下：&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又確認，他在支付法國《世界報》的廣告費時，是經一間公司 COGITO LAB COMPANY LIMITED 匯款，而李是該間公司銀行戶口的唯一授權簽署人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;加拿大環球郵報廣告稱港府干犯人道罪行-促加國政府施壓-包括制裁&quot;&gt;加拿大《環球郵報》廣告稱港府干犯人道罪行 促加國政府施壓 包括制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示刊登在加拿大《環球郵報》的廣告，標題為「STAND WITH HONG KONG UNTIL DAWN」，內文要求加國政府支持香港人，因香港人正在爭取自由和民主，但是面臨與香港政府相關的暴力，包括催淚彈和橡膠子彈，香港已成為了一個「警察國家」（a police state）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FjWdc0Z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;該廣告並指，在香港政府的施政下，沒有人是安全的，要求讀者採取行動，促使加國政府保護30萬名在港的加拿大公民，例如促請加國政府向北京和特區政府施壓，包括實施制裁和禁止出售武器給香港警方；要求加國政府確認香港特區政府和警方干犯人道罪行；以及在來屆選舉中投票給支持香港爭取民主自由的候選人等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李宇軒確認上述是「G攬運動」期間，刊登在加拿大《環球郵報》的廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;紐約時報國際版廣告促美國政府向香港警方禁售武器&quot;&gt;《紐約時報》國際版廣告促美國政府向香港警方禁售武器&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示刊登於《紐約時報》國際版的廣告，標題為「CATCH HONG KONG AS WE FALL」、「THE LAST STAND FOR FREEDOM」。內文求美國讀者聯絡眾議員和參議員，成為《香港人權與民主法案》的共同動議人，並促請美國政府向香港警方禁售武器。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李，有關「G攬運動」的登報廣告是否與上述廣告大致相似。李則表示：「我諗唯一嘅共識係同當時嘅香港自由民主有關」，雖然不同國家的廣告文字和設計就由其他人去負責，但是「唔會否認（話）呢份廣告唔係我哋整嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指第三次眾籌餘款約698萬美元-用在重光團隊有關的活動&quot;&gt;李宇軒指第三次眾籌餘款約69.8萬美元 用在「重光團隊」有關的活動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前提及第四次的眾籌運動「重光計劃」，以及相關網站有最新的財務紀錄，控方庭上展示「重光團隊」（Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong）的網站截圖，可見「全球登報制裁港共眾籌計劃」標題。李確認此標題反映眾籌運動的主題，並補充指截圖所顯示的，是「G攬運動」的財務收支報告，總結「G攬運動」眾籌了多少款項、花費了多少款項，用以向公眾交代和解釋為何在2020年5月籌辦第四次眾籌即「重光計劃」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李確認根據收支報告，截至2020年5月，「G攬運動」錄得餘款約69.8萬美元（約546萬港元），但他指這筆錢之後會一直使用，花費在「各地有關 support 香港自由民主嘅活動」。控方問是否有關「重光團隊」的活動，李表示：「可以咁樣理解。」控方表示會在稍後時間就此提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

The new Qinling station, located on Inexpressible Island in the Ross Sea, joins the existing Great Wall (Antarctic Peninsula), Zhongshan (eastern Antarctica), Taishan (eastern Antarctic highlands), and Kunlun (Dome A) stations.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;China, with five, now has the fourth most stations in Antarctica behind Argentina, Chile, and Russia, and has the fastest-growing presence in Antarctica, having opened three stations since 2009.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese president Xi Jinping declared in 2014 that the country intends to be a “polar power,” and its growth in Antarctica is consistent with achieving that goal in the southern hemisphere. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said upon the opening of Qinling that the station “will contribute to humanity’s scientific understanding of the Antarctic, provide a platform for joint scientific exploration and cooperation between China and other countries, and help advance peace and sustainable development in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is China doing in Antarctica? And do its intentions, capabilities, and actions in that remote region threaten the national security of the United States and its allies? In 2023, CSIS published two publications on Antarctica that started to address these questions: “Great Power Competition Comes for the South Pole” and “Frozen Frontiers: China’s Great Power Ambitions in the Polar Regions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than a few such articles, there is generally little focus in the United States on Antarctic geopolitics or their potential to affect U.S. and allied national security interests. The quiet in the United States is in stark contrast to the regular discussions on the topic in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. However, this does not mean that no one in the United States is paying attention or that U.S. officials have no tools for learning what other countries are doing in Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the Antarctic Treaty permits certain countries to conduct unannounced, in-person inspections in the region and requires countries operating there to provide advance notification of their activities, equipment, and personnel. In the United States, the responsibility to use these tools to monitor other countries’ capabilities in Antarctica falls to the Department of State. For example, as a State Department official, the author led the U.S. team that conducted a 2020 inspection of the Chinese station being built at Inexpressible Island, the same station that just opened. So while some commentators may have been caught unawares by the construction, which started in 2017, U.S. officials have already conducted a surprise inspection of the Qinling station in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the rapidly growing Chinese presence in Antarctica — as well as concerns about how the Chinese stations might employ dual-use technology — now is a good time to review the tools the Antarctic Treaty provides for monitoring the presence, activities, and equipment of all countries operating in the region. In addition to knowing these tools exist, policymakers should be aware of the opportunities and limits of these tools so they can best use and strengthen them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-non-armament-and-monitoring-provisions-in-the-antarctic-treaty&quot;&gt;Key Non-armament and Monitoring Provisions in the Antarctic Treaty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1959, 12 countries signed the Antarctic Treaty, which sought to prevent the use of Antarctica for military purposes while providing for freedom of scientific investigation and freedom of access. This decision headed off the growing possibility of violence between Argentina, Chile, and the United Kingdom over their overlapping sovereignty claims; locked in the cooperation demonstrated during the successful 1957–58 International Geophysical Year; and prevented Cold War competition from spreading to the coldest continent. Signatories to the document — the first Cold War non-armament and arms control treaty — agreed to significantly restrict military action (Article I), prohibit nuclear explosive devices and their waste (Article V), and establish a strong monitoring system (Article VII). Per the treaty, “Antarctica” is defined as everything below 60 degrees south latitude, regardless of whether it is land, any category of ice, or water. Any country can join the treaty, although only ones that conduct substantial scientific research in Antarctica can participate in the consensus-based decisionmaking process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;restricting-military-and-nuclear-uses&quot;&gt;Restricting Military and Nuclear Uses&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Limiting the risk that Antarctica could be used as a launchpad for conventional military forces, dumping ground for nuclear waste, or nuclear weapons testing site was particularly important to the countries closest to the continent. Article I addressed this by establishing that the region “shall be used for peaceful purposes only” and prohibiting, “inter alia, any measures of a military nature, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military maneuvers, as well as the testing of any type of weapons.” This provision is remarkably broad, presumably so it can cover non-peaceful uses of the region comprehensively. It provides one example of what is prohibited — “any measures of a military nature” — and three examples of what could be considered as such. Given the structure of the provision, it would be normal, but incorrect, to conclude that these three examples are the main determinants of what needs to be prohibited to reserve Antarctica for peaceful use. However, focusing on only three examples would be insufficiently narrow. The correct reading is that “any measures of a military nature” is but one way that Antarctica cannot be used for non-peaceful purposes. In recognition of the importance of military logistical capabilities in particular, Article I does not prohibit the presence of military forces in Antarctica so long as their activities there are for scientific research or other peaceful purposes. Similarly, while Article V prohibits nuclear explosions and the disposal of radioactive waste in Antarctica, it does not prohibit the peaceful use of nuclear energy to fuel stations or vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articles I and V were vital for the 12 countries that negotiated the treaty since Article IV holds in abeyance all sovereignty claims. There are seven countries that claim sovereignty over specific portions of Antarctica (Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom) plus two countries that maintain a basis to make claims in Antarctica (Russia and the United States). So long as the treaty remains in force, Article IV prevents new claimants from coming forward, freezes the current claims, and prevents any country from enforcing or applying its claim. Article IV therefore prompted the seven claimants to insist on Articles I and V due to their reasonable desire to prevent their national homelands from being threatened from territory they claim but cannot administer in Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-two-tier-monitoring-program-in-action&quot;&gt;The Two-Tier Monitoring Program in Action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding that restrictions without monitoring are just dreams, negotiators went beyond just having words on paper and established a two-tier monitoring program to verify compliance with the Antarctic Treaty. These mechanisms — an inspections regime and a requirement for advance notification of activities in Antarctica — are found in Article VII. As a result, the 12 countries that negotiated the treaty and the 47 other countries that have signed onto its provisions (as of March 1, 2024) significantly reduced the possibility of Antarctica being used to threaten others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Understanding that restrictions without monitoring are just dreams, negotiators went beyond just having words on paper and established a two-tier monitoring program to verify compliance with the Antarctic Treaty.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-inspection-regime&quot;&gt;The Inspection Regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the two monitoring tools established by the treaty, the inspections regime has received more attention. This tool permits certain countries operating in Antarctica to conduct unannounced inspections. Per the treaty, the inspectors have complete freedom of access to all areas in Antarctica, including any station, installation, ship, aircraft, or equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This remarkably open provision was intended to advance both U.S. foreign policy goals and protect Antarctica. Per Ambassador Herman Phleger, the lead U.S. negotiator for the treaty, the United States’ intent was to use Antarctica to facilitate potential future treaties with the Soviet Union on “such vitally important matters as nuclear testing, surprise attack, and general disarmament” — agreements Moscow had been unwilling to accept at the time. According to Phleger’s testimony to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the inspection provisions “will not only serve to protect the parties against any violation of the treaty, but should also prove a valuable source of practical experience in the detailed processes of international inspection.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If obtaining agreement to this broad inspection regime was the first step, the second step was to use this right. The first inspection was completed in 1963 by New Zealand of two U.S. stations (McMurdo and South Pole) followed by the U.S. inspection in 1964 of a number of facilities, including two Soviet ones. When planning for the first U.S. inspection, one of the norms important to U.S. officials was that the unannounced visits to Soviet and other stations “should not disrupt the very harmony and international cooperation which it is the primary purpose of the Treaty to preserve.” Consistent with this goal, Secretary of State Dean Rusk instructed the U.S. inspection team, “While performing inspections, you should bear constantly in mind that all states active in Antarctica have been both friendly and cooperative with the United States in matters relating to the continent, and it is the policy of the United States to preserve and enhance this situation.” The United States and other countries also made public the inspection findings rather than burying them in government bureaucracies under heavy classification restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By promptly using the inspection provisions, publicizing the results, and making it clear that the inspections were not hostile or indicative of any specific treaty or national security concern, the United States and its allies reinforced that Antarctica was a place of cooperation and transparency reserved for peaceful scientific research. That they did so via surprise inspections indicated they did not believe in Antarctic exceptionalism or that the treaty’s words alone were sufficient to uphold it. This posture was also shaped by the desire to create favorable conditions for future arms-control agreements with the Soviet Union by demonstrating that in-person inspections would not necessarily be hostile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty, there have been 60 inspections since the treaty entered into force in 1961. The most recent — by the United States to certain Ross Sea sites and Australia to various stations throughout the continent — concluded in February 2020. The United States has conducted the most inspections overall (17), with Australia conducting the most during the twenty-first century (6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are significant differences between earlier and more recent inspections. Only 12 countries conducted inspections during the first three decades, while 22 did during the second three decades. This trend reinforces that the inspection regime is neither just a U.S. interest nor merely a Cold War tool, but that it is important for many countries active in Antarctica, including those that have no territorial claim or are not leading participants in great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing number of inspecting countries and inspected sites is vital since the number of stations has grown over the decades. Having a wider range of states monitoring treaty compliance is particularly important since the seven claimant countries generally focus their inspections on the area they claim, likely due to having logistical capability and familiarity with that region as well as to learn the details of the activities of other countries in “their” area. For example, the United Kingdom has conducted eight inspections, only two of which were outside its territorial claim while both Argentina and Chile have conducted all of their six inspections in their claimed areas. Australia is the main exception to this observation, having sent officials to the Ross Sea and Peninsula regions, both of which are outside of its Antarctic claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise in joint or multilateral inspections reflects their potential benefits, including the sharing of costs (political and logistical) and rewards (both practical and what was found). However, there is no treaty requirement for joint or multilateral inspections or provisions for neutral monitoring teams. This is because during the treaty negotiations, the United States insisted on the right to organize unilateral inspections due to challenges learned from attempting to conduct inspections with multiple countries during the Korean War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States have consistently been the most active countries in using the inspection tools. After conducting only one inspection in the first 20 years of the treaty, Australia has increased the pace of its inspections. Although the United Kingdom has conducted eight inspections it has inspected 138 sites — the most by far. It is also the leader in joint inspections, having undertaken seven joint inspections with different countries, followed by Argentina and Chile (which have conducted three joint inspections with each other in the past decade), France, Germany, and the United States. The pace of U.S. inspections has slowed significantly since the Cold War: The United States conducted eight of the 13 inspections prior to 1985 but has conducted only two inspections since 2013, only one of which included national security officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union’s global stance against inspections likely reduced its willingness to use the treaty inspection regime despite its interest in monitoring its Cold War competitors. However, Russia did conduct two joint inspections with the United States in January and December 2012 during the “reset” period of U.S.-Russian relations. In addition, since China became a consultative party to the Antarctic Treaty in 1985, it has conducted two inspections, one in 2015 and one in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;advance-notification-in-practice&quot;&gt;Advance Notification in Practice&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per Article VII, the second monitoring tool requires a country to give advance notice regarding “all expeditions to and within Antarctica, on the part of its ships or nationals, and all expeditions to Antarctica organized in or proceeding from its territory,” all its stations, and “any military personnel or equipment intended to be introduced by it into Antarctica.” This provides transparency about upcoming activities, which benefits both national security interests and scientific collaboration. Since traveling to the region is remarkably expensive and challenging, this process gives more countries greater insight into a wider area of Antarctica than could be achieved via in-person inspections. In addition, Article III requires parties to share plans for future and results from previous scientific programs “to the greatest extent feasible and practicable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advance notification process has evolved but is currently failing. For many years, parties met these obligations via diplomatic notes. However, this was inefficient, so representatives at the 2012 Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) decided they would use the web-based Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES) maintained by the treaty’s secretariat. On top of the information required by the treaty — most notably on expeditions and military personnel and equipment — parties agreed to provide additional information on areas such as the use of research rockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three troubling trends were salient at the 2023 ATCM. First, only 10 of the 29 consultative parties submitted their annual report for each of the past 10 years. Second, during this time, there was a 20 percent decrease in the number of parties that submitted their information. Third, when a party files its annual report, the document usually does not cover all topics, including treaty-required information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the major actors in Antarctica, China is the most significant party that has not consistently submitted information to the EIES, notably not filing any reports between 2017–2022 and recently filing the reports for the last two seasons. China’s failure to regularly report on its annual expeditions, station construction, and operations contributes to an information void that calls into question Chinese motives and capabilities. But as the secretariat has indicated, some topics are almost never reported on by any party, including the obligatory information on forward plans for scientific research and military personnel and equipment. This widespread failure by parties to meet agreed-upon transparency requirements amplifies stress on the Antarctic Treaty system even as concerns mount about its health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This widespread failure by parties to meet agreed-upon transparency requirements amplifies stress on the Antarctic Treaty system even as concerns mount about its health.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;us-inspections-in-2020&quot;&gt;U.S. Inspections in 2020&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the U.S. interagency team inspected five sites at three stations — Jang Bogo (South Korea), Mario Zucchelli (Italy), and the station later dubbed Qinling under construction on Inexpressible Island (China) — as well as Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 161 and the runway under construction near Mario Zucchelli Station. The United States chose to inspect these five sites due to operational, scientific, and environmental reasons, in addition to national security ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composition of the team was consistent with the goal of inspection and included national security experts from the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Coast Guard, as well as experts in Antarctic scientific operations and environmental topics from the National Science Foundation and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All inspectors had the responsibility and ability to collect information on any of the priority issues up for inspection and were not restricted to a particular topic. Additionally, all inspectors used the EIES and other publicly available information to research the sites before arrival. As noted above, the EIES process is designed to satisfy not only the advance notification requirements of the Antarctic Treaty but also, as parties agreed to in 2012, provide additional information on other topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per the terms of the treaty and as subsequently illuminated by treaty meetings, the United States informed other parties of the names and affiliated U.S. government agency of the inspection team members in December 2019 but provided no information about the destinations or goals of the inspection. The United States informed the three selected stations of the team’s impending arrival roughly 36 hours before they reached the first site, the South Korean Jang Bogo station. Providing short-term advance notification is a customary courtesy, given how receptive all countries have been to these inspections, to reduce disruptions to scientific and operational activities and reduce risk of a transportation emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States was interested in the operational aspects of the chosen sites in the Ross Sea region largely due to the new infrastructure that had been (and was being) constructed there since the previous U.S. inspection in 2012: the Jang Bogo Station was opened in 2014, Italy was building a new runway, and China was building a new year-round station on Inexpressible Island. The Italian runway was of particular interest since it could serve as an alternative landing point for intercontinental flights to the U.S. McMurdo Station — a major transit and logistical hub 200 miles away — that would otherwise need to return to their departure point if weather at McMurdo was inhospitable. Having an alternative landing site in Antarctica could prevent “boomerang” flights that return to New Zealand, for example, thereby saving time, fuel, and money. Additionally, since the United States has the largest presence in the region, U.S. officials wanted to be prepared in case McMurdo personnel are called on to respond to an emergency. Decreasing the possibility that the finite U.S. resources at the station would be diverted from planned scientific or operational activity to provide emergency assistance to the Chinese, Italian, or South Korean stations along the Ross Sea was the main concern in the report, which therefore encouraged the then-unnamed Chinese station to increase communication with its Italian and South Korean neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to having the largest presence in Antarctica, the United States conducts the most scientific research on the continent. U.S. officials are always interested in learning about new activities and new approaches being pursued there, including ongoing Italian maritime research, new South Korean preparations for an inland traverse, and potential Chinese contributions to understanding the variation of the climate, cryosphere, and ocean in the Ross Sea region. At the time, these three parties were collaborating to designate a new ASPA to assist in monitoring one of the oldest Adélie penguin colonies and a breeding site of south polar skua, as well as serve as a reference point for sea-ice dynamics; ASPA 178 was approved at the 2021 ATCM in Paris. The United States also uses inspections to learn how parties are engaging with the environment, including but not limited to how a station is implementing the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty’s Protocol on Environmental Protection, a complementary agreement that entered into force in 1998. Notably, the inspectors “strongly encouraged” China to submit a final comprehensive environmental evaluation for its station, a requirement China subsequently completed in October 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the countries whose stations were inspected have made or can make territorial claims so long as the treaty is in force, so Article IV sovereignty considerations were of the less priority for the inspectors. However, New Zealand maintains a territorial claim over the Ross Sea area where the stations are located, so having U.S. officials travel there without informing New Zealand underscored that no country’s claim can impede an unannounced inspection. Inspection officials, who were warmly welcomed at all visited sites, focused on reviewing compliance with Article I and other treaty provisions and, as the report concluded, “found no violations of Treaty provisions reserving Antarctica solely for peaceful purposes.” Rather, “each of the stations was well-managed and impressive in terms of their general facilities and professional character.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the U.S. team very much considered Articles I and V and other provisions. Each station allowed the inspectors access to all parts of the station. Inspectors found no weapons, military equipment, or explosives at any of them; however, both Italy’s Mario Zucchelli station and Korea’s Jang Bogo station had military personnel present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the stations, the United States chose to inspect ASPA 161, which reinforced the point that giving an area protected status does not exempt it from the broader monitoring regime. Other countries had inspected protected areas, including Australia in 2016 and New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States in 2005. Doing so also demonstrated how to conduct an inspection without harming the ecology of the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the U.S. inspectors chose to highlight the importance of transparency. For example, the report encouraged countries to “maintain or increase the information they share” and noted the “significant disparity in the use of the [EIES],” as noted above, China has been particularly derelict at using this mandated transparency tool. By contrast, as has been the norm since the treaty was signed, the United States released its report not only to the Antarctic Treaty parties but also to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the Antarctic Treaty does not resolve differences over Antarctica but addresses them by agreeing to disagree on key topics such as sovereignty and by curtailing military interests and activities, there is justifiable concern about how increased geopolitical rivalry may affect the future of the treaty. In particular, strategic rivalries may increase suspicion that certain countries are not complying with key provisions such as the obligation to use Antarctica for peaceful purposes only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, existing tools do provide some solutions to these challenges and worries, and there is much the United States can do to ensure its own situational awareness of what is happening in Antarctica. Specifically, the United States should do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase the frequency of in-person, unannounced inspections.&lt;/strong&gt; Although the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted and continues to affect Antarctic operations, and weather will always be the biggest challenge to any sort of movement, conducting only one full inspection during the past decade demonstrates a lack of commitment by the United States to monitoring the capabilities and activities of other countries in Antarctica in person. Every three to five years, the United States should aim to undertake inspections that cover an appropriate array of sites and use U.S.-flagged operated transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase collaboration with like-minded countries on inspections.&lt;/strong&gt; Inspections are time-consuming and expensive. To mitigate these practical challenges, the United States should consider collaborating with other like-minded countries, such as by conducting joint inspections or sharing detailed information afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote the idea that inspections can in turn reinforce collaboration.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should consider conducting in-person inspections with other countries to achieve specific goals. For example, a joint inspection of Antarctic Peninsula sites with Argentina, Chile, and the United Kingdom — the three countries laying claim to the region — could send a powerful signal of cooperation. Like the U.S.-Russian inspections in 2012, a joint inspection by the United States and China could also provide a practical and discrete way for the two countries to demonstrate their collaboration in Antarctica and commitment to the treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage compliance with advance notification requirements.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should continue to push all countries to supply the information they agreed to provide to the EIES. It should encourage work by neutral knowledgeable authorities, such as the Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty, to report on EIES compliance annually. In addition to reviewing the submissions of other countries, the United States should set a positive example of compliance with the EIES reporting requirements. It should make sure its own submissions are timely and complete.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase attention paid to dual-use equipment.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should analyze the information already collected during previous inspections and submitted to the EIES regarding telescopes, telecommunications equipment such as submarine cables if and when they are built, and satellite infrastructure such as the U.S. Global Positioning System, Russia’s Global Navigation Satellite System, China’s BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, and the EU Galileo system. If Washington feels the existing requirements to report on military equipment are not sufficient to supply the information it needs, it should also consider proposing to add additional fields to the EIES. Countries should also prioritize in-person inspections of key sites to verify the information submitted is consistent with what is on the ground. Knowing what equipment is in Antarctica is the first step to determining related risks and mitigation actions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;李宇軒指Mark Simon借出戶口收眾籌款項 冀成立基金不留港銀行 免受凍結風險&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cVGoitS.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（18日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第47日審訊。「十二港人」之一李宇軒繼續以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。李談及2019年8月的第三次眾籌活動，籌得約180萬美元，在提取眾籌款項過程中經歷了一些困難，後來在另一名被告陳梓華的協助下，找來了黎智英的私人助手、被指為本案共謀者之一的 Mark Simon 借出美國的銀行戶口收取眾籌款項，然後轉帳至「Project Hong Kong Trust」的戶口。李提到，當時 Mark Simon 要求成立一個基金來保管眾籌款項，而非把款項轉帳至李的渣打銀行個人戶口，而且需要找美國公民來擔任基金信託人，「盡量將啲錢唔留喺香港銀行系統入面，去減少香港銀行例如凍結呢啲錢嘅風險。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指英國登報計劃花光308萬英鎊籌款&quot;&gt;李宇軒指英國登報計劃花光30.8萬英鎊籌款&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第四天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。就2019年7月的「中英聯合聲明登報」計劃，控方展示報館發票、李宇軒的銀行戶口紀錄，顯示《衛報》（The Guardian）的廣告費用是4萬英鎊。此外，NewStatesman 的廣告費是1,200英鎊，The Spectator 的廣告費則是2,333英鎊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指是次登報的總支出是大約30.8萬英鎊，即是花光所有眾籌款項。李又指除了登報紙廣告費用之外，相關支出還有在「89up」的廣告版、Facebook、Twitter 和 Google 登廣告，也有分別向「89up」和「Whitehouse consultancy」兩間顧問公司支付顧問費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;活動開支方面，李指包括印製單張、租借會議室、訂製T恤等雜費。控方問到這些活動是什麼性質。李則指一般來說是「支持香港的活動」，但他不清楚每個活動的性質，因為是「攬炒巴」劉祖廸以及在英國當地的人所舉辦的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;英國登報廣告呼籲英政府制裁有份打壓香港自由人權的人士&quot;&gt;英國登報廣告呼籲英政府制裁有份打壓香港自由人權的人士&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示從李的手機檢取的廣告相片，當中的文字呼籲英國政府向有份打壓香港自由和人權的人實施制裁，又指英國一定要支持香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又留意到廣告提供一個聯署網址，李指「攬炒巴」等人希望將一些廣告轉變成實質的政治行動（concrete political actions），因此以他記憶所及，該聯署是讓英國當地選民找回自己有份投選的國會議員，「跟住搵返佢哋做咩，我唔記得。」李指意思是：「我係你嘅 voter，我想你做一樣嘢，咁我就繼續投票俾你。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒表示有份成立fight-for-freedom-stand-with-hong-kong&quot;&gt;李宇軒表示有份成立「Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指廣告下方有一組字「Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong」，問這是否一個組織。李確認是一個組織，並稱：「我係佢嘅一部份。」李指：「係由一班國際嘅香港人，同埋關心香港嘅人去組成，去組成一個 activism 嘅組織，就去爭取當時香港嘅自由民主。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱這個組織的創辦人除了他自己之外，還有「攬炒巴」、「Always」、「Madison」和「Shirley Ho」等人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後逐一追問各人身份。李稱「Always」和「Madison」均是網名，但不知他們真實身份。而「Shirley Ho」則是真名，她是一名天文物理學家，當時居住於美國。李指 Shirley Ho 曾經在2019年7月底或8月頭與他一同前往日內瓦，她在同年11月底或12月與他前往美國華盛頓，該次她作為一個監管者（chaperone）角色。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到「Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong」如何成立。李指，在2019年6月的G20登報計劃時，有的報紙會要求登廣告的人使用實名，也有的報紙接受籠統的名字，例如「Free Hong Kong」或「Hongkonger」。李指後來在7月的「中英聯合聲明」登報計劃中，大家希望成立一個統一或大家安心的團體，能夠使用它的名義登廣告，所以 Telegram 群組的人設立一個投票，最終投選出「Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong」作為團體的名稱，所以是次登報的廣告都是以這個團體的名義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指：「到再後期嘅事，呢一個組織或呢班人嗰 scope 擴闊到唔淨只報紙登廣告，不過呢個係後話。」控方追問他們會做什麼事，李則指例如舉辦一些支持香港的活動、與顧問公司合作和在社交媒體登廣告等等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認攬炒巴角色是精神領袖在連登上有號召力&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認「攬炒巴」角色是精神領袖、在連登上有號召力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及「攬炒巴」在「Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong」（後稱SWHK）團隊中的角色。李指「佢最 prominent 嘅角色係作為『攬炒巴』。」控方追問是什麼意思，李則指：「啫係佢就係連登上面嘅『攬炒巴』，呢個就係佢最 prominent 嘅 role。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問「攬炒巴」實際做過什麼事。李稱「攬炒巴」的角色有如早前提及的另一個連登帳號「家樂牌通心粉」，在G20登報期間「家樂牌通心粉」在連登討論區上有號召力，直至「中英聯合聲明」登報期間，就輪到「攬炒巴」在連登上有號召力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官再問，「攬炒巴」的角色是否作為一名精神領袖。李表示：「可以咁樣理解。」李又指「攬炒巴」是其中一個在「中英聯合聲明登報」計劃中積極參與討論的人，而他的主意與其他 Telegram 群組成員一致，「最 prominent 嘅 role 係佢會喺連登出 post。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李形容：「而佢喺連登出嘅 post，我理解大部份嘅 post 都會有好大嘅迴響，即係好多人會睇佢嘅 post。」法官李運騰問，連登上是否有很多人跟蹤「攬炒巴」的帖文？李則表示不肯定連登有否「追蹤」這個功能，只能說有很多人回應（react to）「攬炒巴」的帖文。李官又問「攬炒巴」是否有很多追隨者？李指：「喺連登上面係。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指swhk曾經舉辦g20報紙展覽-據陳梓華稱蘋果日報資助3至4萬元-惟記憶模糊&quot;&gt;李宇軒指SWHK曾經舉辦G20報紙展覽 據陳梓華稱《蘋果日報》資助3至4萬元 惟記憶模糊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問及SWHK有否在香港舉辦活動，李宇軒提到，SWHK曾經在大約2019年8月或9月，在灣仔富德樓舉辦一個報紙展，「可以話，去畀喺香港嘅香港人去睇返，原來G20，6月嗰陣，有啲香港人做咗國際登報喎。」因為G20廣告是登在外國的報紙，反而身處香港的人未曾看過這些實體報紙，所以便舉辦這個報紙展覽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/pSo39uQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又表示，相信是一個「G20殘留落嚟嘅小組」，裡面有人提議舉辦展覽。他記得他曾經做過一日義工，負責看管場地和做介紹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問到展覽由誰人出資舉辦。李表示開頭不知道，但是在後來知道陳梓華等人，或者陳梓華穿針引線去《蘋果日報》那邊，便資助了3萬或4萬元。他相信當時是陳梓華告訴他，或者陳梓華等人轉達過來的說法（hearsay），不過他不肯定相關詳情。法官遂打斷指，既然李對於自己的證供不肯定，便沒有需要詳述下去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;在午飯後，李再補充，T曾經就這個展覽跟他談及有關《蘋果日報》基金的事，不過他不記得詳情，但他肯定他從沒從陳梓華那邊接收過任何錢。就《蘋果》基金在展覽中的角色，李指在活動後段，若他沒有記錯的話《蘋果》基金有提供資助，但是「記憶好模糊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指2019年8月籌辦第三次眾籌登報&quot;&gt;李宇軒指2019年8月籌辦第三次眾籌登報&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就2019年8月的第三次眾籌活動，李指因為G20和「中英聯合聲明」先後兩次眾籌登報計劃「都OK成功」，所以兩次眾籌的部份籌辦者，包括李、「攬炒巴」和網名「T」的陳梓華，聯手籌辦了第三次運動，即是「G攬運動」。李指是次運動的主題是喚起國際關注當時香港的民主自由狀況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，是次運動分別在美國、英國、加拿大、法國、德國、西班牙、意大利、瑞典、芬蘭和丹麥等國家的報紙登廣告。有人負責聯絡報館，有人負責設計廣告，而負責處理眾籌和墊支的人則是李自己。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李又提到「攬炒巴」的角色是在「連登」討論區出帖文，因為當時「『攬炒巴』個 account 勁過『家樂牌通心粉』，我意思係『攬炒巴』個 account 會有多啲迴響，所以由『攬炒巴』喺連登出 post」，宣傳及簡介眾籌計劃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指第三次眾籌款項達180萬元美金-需找美國的有錢人借出戶口收款&quot;&gt;李宇軒指第三次眾籌款項達180萬元美金 需找美國的有錢人借出戶口收款&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指第三次眾籌不是限於英國，所以決定使用國際通用的美元為單位，同樣使用眾籌平台「gofundme.com」。至於眾籌款項當時提取至哪一個銀戶口，李則形容「呢個係好長嘅故事」，他指眾籌款項最後被轉移至「Project Hong Kong Trust」在美國 Amalgamated Bank 的戶口，但中間卻經歷了一些困難。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李解釋，他們需要借用一個在美國開設的美金戶口來收取眾籌款項，加上款項達180萬元美金，為了避免被懷疑「洗黑錢」，所以不能借用一般的銀行戶口，「咁就要搵喺美國、又咁上下有錢嘅人」來借出銀行戶口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李記得他們首先找到一個在美國的有錢人願意借出戶口，但是當這個人嘗試將款項從眾籌戶口轉移至其銀行個人戶口時，銀行卻未能完成此程序，他理解該筆款項是離開了眾籌戶口，「但是去到收款人戶口時，銀行 hold 住咗條數，就冇入到去個銀行戶口」，可能正在等待釐清一些資料。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指陳梓華找到mark-simon借出戶口&quot;&gt;李宇軒指陳梓華找到Mark Simon借出戶口&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指，後來他們找到另一名在美國的有錢人士協助，當時他不知道該人的身份，後來才知道他是Mark Simon。而李知道眾籌款項成功地轉移至該有錢人的銀行戶口，不久之後，Mark Simon 的銀行戶口便將相關款項轉帳至「Project Hong Kong Trust」的戶口。李補充，嚴格來說他並不知道從眾籌戶口提取款項的人是否 Mark Simon，而他只知道 Mark Simon 轉帳了一筆錢給「Project Hong Kong Trust」戶口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李憶述，他曾經在 Telegram 與網名是「T」的陳梓華討論有關事宜，當第一名美國有錢人未能接收眾籌款項的時候，「我問 T 有冇計，咁佢話佢嗰邊諗吓辦法，eventually 佢話『我搵到人』。」控方問李，陳梓華當時有否提及該人的身份，李回答：「我唔記得佢有冇講，定係佢講咗但我唔記得。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李憶述，直至大約2020年2月，他整理第三次眾籌的收支紀錄期間，查看「Project Hong Kong Trust」的銀行戶口紀錄時，「我見到，噢，原來入錢嗰度寫住 Mark Simon」，而轉帳日子是2019年底或2020年初。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指mark-simon要求成立基金保管眾籌款項-美國公民擔任信託人免受風險&quot;&gt;李宇軒指Mark Simon要求成立基金保管眾籌款項 美國公民擔任信託人免受風險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「Project Hong Kong Trust」，李指主要有3名美國公民作為這個基金的法律上持有人，其中一個人是 Katherine Cheng ，另外兩名人士則不知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，Mark Simon 當時提出一個要求，他希望把這一筆眾籌款項轉移至一個基金，而不是李的渣打銀行戶口，所以 Mark Simon 替他們聯絡律師並與美國當地的人商討，希望成立一個基金保管這筆錢，而且需要找人擔任信託人，「希望呢啲 trustee 係美國公民，去減低佢哋有可能受到，譬如話香港銀行系統要求佢哋要對啲錢點樣做嘅風險。」李相信以上是由陳梓華轉述給他的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何 Mark Simon 想成立一個基金，李稱記得當時的討論和分析是，「盡量將啲錢唔留喺香港銀行系統入面，去減少香港銀行例如凍結呢啲錢嘅風險。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指陳梓華安排他會見美議員-mark-simon亦在場&quot;&gt;李宇軒指陳梓華安排他會見美議員 Mark Simon亦在場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示當時未曾跟 Mark Simon 溝通，「我知 T（陳梓華）係有同 Mark Simon 傾計」，不過「喺呢個時間點，T 已經 link up 咗我同 Mark Simon」。李提到大約在2019年8或9月，美國參議員斯科特（Rick Scott）訪港，陳梓華安排了他會見斯科特、其助手 Scott Sciretta 及美國領事職員 Alan Brinker，而且 Mark Simon 及其他人亦在場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示「G攬運動」的財務收支紀錄，李確認是次眾籌籌得180萬美元，大約是1,400萬港元。截至2020年3月，支出是大約730萬港元，其中630萬港元用作登報廣告費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李提到後來第四次的眾籌計劃名叫「重光香港計劃」，惟他並沒有參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme was part of a Preventing Violent Extremism (PVE) project, intended to create community resources for resilience, in the information sphere, towards conflict issues contributing to recruitment by non-state armed groups such as Islamic State–Khorasan Province (IS–KP). Peace Journalism is familiar as the basis for media development aid in contexts of conflict; however, its use in an intervention aimed specifically at PVE is relatively new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the programme was effective, it is argued, in terms of benefits transferred to and applied by participating journalists. A sample of articles after the training showed a markedly higher Peace Journalism quotient than a baseline sample of articles by the same journalists before it. This suggested that the training and mentorship had successfully stimulated and enabled journalistic agency, taking account of constraints imposed by media structures and wider political and social contexts. The latter have become steadily more onerous under the Islamic Emirate (Taliban) government, in power since August 2021, according to international monitoring organisations. Implications are considered, in light of the findings, for future media development aid to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Peace Journalism (PJ) model, originally proposed by Johan Galtung as a set of ideational distinctions in news representations of conflict, has served as the organising principle for both scholarly research and practical application. Much of the latter has come through media development aid, often taking the form of professional training courses for editors and reporters. The effectiveness of such schemes depends on activating and galvanising journalistic agency to change the content of reporting. The extent of this activity can be gauged from grey literature such as The Peace Journalist, published biannually by the Global Peace Journalism Center at Park University, Missouri. Lynch and Tiripelli (2022) found 55 reports of such interventions, in 33 countries, in the magazine’s first 19 editions, from April 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the early days of such interventions, however, trainers were reporting such risks as “creating cycles of empowerment and disempowerment” (Lloyd 2003, p. 118), as trainees, enthused with new ideas, returned afterwards to the same office settings, with the same constraints. Adebayo found that journalist participants in a PJ workshop in Nigeria wanted to “set a positive developmental agenda for public discourse”, but found themselves “act[ing] as muffled drums because of the overbearing influence of media owners and draconian government policies” (Adebayo 2016, p. 375). An early scholarly critique complained that PJ exponents tended to adopt “an overly individualistic and voluntaristic perspective” (Hanitzsch 2008, p. 75), giving rise to exaggerated assessments of the extent of change in news practices that could be brought about through such means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting of conflict issues by Afghan media, from the time of the abortive US-sponsored peace talks with the then insurgent Taliban in September 2020, was found (Lynch and Freear 2023) to display a predominant pattern of War Journalism, and little or no Peace Journalism, on the distinctions in the Galtung model. In the same study, Afghan journalists were interviewed (n = 16), and asked whether, how, and to what extent this pattern of reporting matched their own aspirations for their journalism. “The dominant pattern of coverage did not align with their own notions of how the conflict and the issues in the peace negotiations should be reported… Afghan journalists interviewed for this study wanted to do more Peace Journalism”, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such receptiveness to the tenets of PJ is not untypical among journalists in non-Western settings, Hussain writes. However, “the main obstacles to Peace Journalism in the non-Western world are lack of media freedom, threats to life and security, unfavourable socio-cultural conditions and lack of resources for journalists” (Hussain 2022, p. 116). Aside from the direct obstacles brought about by political and security considerations, the constraint on reporting by Afghan media most often identified by the interview subjects was “a lack of suitable training, particularly in Peace Journalism” (ibid.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to these findings, over a period of five months in 2023, a journalist training programme was devised and implemented, in several stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A group of five Afghan journalist trainers themselves underwent training, provided online through an international aid programme, in Peace Journalism;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They then facilitated a week-long residential training workshop for Afghan journalists, held in neighbouring Pakistan. Thirty journalists were trained in total, 20 residing in Afghanistan and 10 in Pakistan (of whom three were living in Peshawar and seven in Islamabad). Of the 30 trainees, seven were women.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The trainees continued to be mentored as they returned to their newsrooms and produced pieces of Peace Journalism, integrating new ideas with the work they had brought to the training, and publishing and/or broadcasting it. They contributed to 49 news outlets in total, including television, radio, magazines, and newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context for this intervention was conceived with reference to the United Nations Secretary-General’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism (2016). This “involves aligning ongoing humanitarian, development, peacebuilding, security, and political interventions with the goals of preventing violent extremism”, across many fields (Thiessen 2019, p. 1). One specifically mentioned in a contemporaneous policy document from the United Nations Development Programme is “promoting messages of tolerance in the media”. Integrating Peace Journalism — or Conflict Sensitive Journalism, as it is sometimes called — within a P/CVE programme is an approach that has been applied previously to address factors associated with violent extremism in Kenya, including under-representation in media, historical grievances and complaints over poor governance (Freear and Glazzard 2021). However, the present study deals with the first intervention of its kind in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an intervention can, in turn, be seen to align with the UN’s Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, intended as a framework for activities in the international aid sector. Within it, “peaceful and inclusive societies” are nominated as an essential co-requisite of sustainable development, in Goal 16, within which Target 10 mentions “public access to information” as a means by which these conditions are to be engendered. So, distinctions of Peace Journalism coding, for evaluation purposes, were adjusted accordingly (see full discussion below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-research-questions-and-method&quot;&gt;2. Research Questions and Method&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overarching aim of the research was to ascertain whether, how, and how far the participating journalists changed their approach to reporting of overlapping issues pertaining to conflict, preventing violent extremism, and sustainable development, after the training, by comparing their new outputs with those they had previously produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Research Questions were, therefore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How much War Journalism and how much Peace Journalism were the journalists producing in their work before entering the programme of training and mentoring?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How did this compare with the extent of War Journalism and Peace Journalism in stories produced by the same journalists, through and after the programme?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, the participating journalists were asked to provide examples of their work, comprising news articles on conflict and related issues, before the programme of mentoring and training began. These were translated then analysed and taken as a baseline sample, then compared with a second sample, comprising articles they had prepared, published and/or broadcast during or after the programme. The latter reflected new ideas they had developed in the training, in close consultation with the mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unit of analysis was therefore the individual story. The content analysis was carried out using evaluative criteria derived from distinctions in the Peace Journalism Model, which takes the form of a table setting out a series of dyads. Table 1 sets out Galtung’s original Peace Journalism model (Lynch and Galtung 2010, p. 13).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/64caqYo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1. The Peace Journalism model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This yielded eight coding categories, with a ninth added, to denote the provision or otherwise in the reports of a “framework of understanding” to connect the story material to broader conflict frames (see discussion below). The coding was carried out with due attention to the gendered implications of conflict issues in Afghanistan over the time frame from which the sample material was taken (again, see discussion below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The samples were coded manually by the two co-authors. The content in each story was analysed for the presence of indicators from any of the four orientations on either side of the table: War Journalism and Peace Journalism. A score of 1 was recorded each time an indicator was found. Scott’s pi, a measure of inter-rater agreement used to establish reliability of findings by two raters, was calculated, and used to validate the results. To calculate observed agreement using this method, the number of items on which raters agree is divided by the total number of items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To elaborate on the coding categories, as adapted for the current context: in a war and violence-orientation, conflict is represented as a zero-sum game, where two antagonistic parties contest the single goal of victory (which, for the other, means inevitable defeat). Significantly, such representations are also characteristic of messaging by violent extremist groups, which typically counterposes “us against them” (Post 1987).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causes of — and possible exits from — the conflict are confined to the immediate arena of hostilities, whereas peace- and conflict-orientation mean going beyond the familiar tit-for-tat sequence of direct violence, instead allowing for multiple parties and goals, with causes and exits anywhere in time and/or space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, by reporting only violent incidents, or ritualised denunciations of the “enemy” by leaders on either of two “sides”, War Journalism typically omits the goals of the parties, or the issues (of grievance, relative deprivation, injustice, unmet needs and interests) that lead them to engage in the conflict, including through violence, in the first place. Generally, their reasons for acting as they do remain obscured by the sophisticated and aggressive communication of violent ideological dogma. In the case of violent extremism, this enhances the appearance of acting beyond the realm of reason, so there is no point reasoning (negotiating) with any of “them”. This can render news audiences cognitively primed for violent responses. “By focusing on physical violence divorced from context, and on win–lose scenarios… news unwittingly incentivises conflict escalation and ‘crackdowns’” (Hackett 2011, p. 40).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth-orientation may refer to the familiar duty of public service media to accurate reporting. At any rate, it indicates, in the specific context of reporting conflict, the inclusion and/or juxtaposition of material calculated or likely to activate critical thinking by audiences served up with propaganda, or partial, self-serving claims and statements, by one or more parties. In PVE initiatives, this could take the form of furnishing public discourse with insights into the grievances, economic and social factors, and individual stories behind violent extremism, in addition to the ideological discourse that is propagated as the “reason for violence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting that adopts these two orientations — peace-and-conflict, and truth — in tandem may help to contextualise and relativise a group such as IS–KP, for instance: revealing commonalities in its composition, patterns of recruitment, orientation to authority, and motivating issues, with those of many other armed groups around the world, thus de-bunking the myth of its special status. This may enable audiences to understand its activities and messaging in the context of a constant challenge to prove relevance and impact in competition with rivals; the related search for secure funding and a steady stream of fighters, and arms; and the need to present strategy within a higher, ideological framework for the purposes of recruitment and morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A people-orientation is often fulfilled by featuring efforts at conflict resolution, bridge-building, and peaceful coexistence by actors and institutions at sub-elite levels. The ability to surface a range of perspectives, issues, and voices from the population at large is of significance and dilutes the polarising effects of violent extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict coverage can be seen, finally, as solution-oriented if causes are explained, and problems diagnosed, in terms of intelligible sequences of stimulus and response. If audiences can see how the processes of a conflict lead up to events — including violent events — that dominate the news, they are more likely to be receptive to treatment recommendations in the shape of proposals for nonviolent policy responses, which can be seen as peace initiatives. In this, such reporting may be consistent with PVE approaches that seek to explain violence from a range of perspectives — from broad historical and socio-economic trends to the specific circumstances of individuals and groups, and why they come to support and join VE organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Peace Journalism model is typically operationalised in relevant research by treating the above orientations as a set of headings, and allotting particular dyadic distinctions of representation, in samples of news reporting about particular conflicts, under each heading — a method pioneered by Lee and Maslog (2005). This process is guided by attention to the conflict milieu — and in this case the particularities of violent extremism in Afghanistan, manifested in IS–KP — considered with reference to established precepts of conflict analysis — to pinpoint the differentials of newsgathering and story-telling that are likely to produce the strongest interactions in audience meaning-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Nohrstedt and Ottosen point out, “journalistic products are perceived to carry and contain meanings on several levels. These cannot be collapsed into a single ‘manifest content’ level” (Nohrstedt and Ottosen 2011, pp. 224–25). In all studies where the PJ model is used as the basis for deriving evaluative criteria to use in content analysis, therefore, some further allowance is made for the discursive context into which the sample of reporting would have entered, and how the distinctions “caught” by such criteria would be likely to influence audience responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dyrstad and Hillesund (2020) use comparative survey research to show how a combination of “grievances… actual or perceived [and] lack of political efficacy” predicates “individual support for political violence”, with particular reference to appeals for support by non-state armed groups. This, therefore, influenced coding for the third of the Peace Journalism orientations, “people-oriented”, to emphasise reporting that highlighted political and/or social agency being exerted from sub-elite levels, with people taking matters into their own hands rather than simply appealing for intervention by authorities, or indeed by violent groups. Such initiatives could be seen as supplying some actual or prospective political efficacy in respect of grievances, and therefore as a community resource to safeguard against the messaging of violent extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the dynamics of cause and effect in any conflict can be differentiated according to gender, White urges, in programming designed to create community resources to prevent violent extremism, a “focus… on the socio-culturally constructed nature of gender roles, and how the unequal socialisation of these roles can… be challenged” (White 2022, p. 588). Contestation over these processes of construction and socialisation has been highlighted by monitoring groups in Afghanistan, with women’s presence in public life characterised as having changed “from almost everywhere to almost nowhere” since the Taliban takeover in 2021. Hence the PJ distinctions were applied with attention to issues in the construction and socialisation of gender roles, particularly as they affected participation by women in any form of public life — and indeed this fed through into the biggest single theme of material in the reporting by trainees. A particularly poignant note within media came with a story about women journalists whose radio station was taken off air — following a process of negotiation with the new authorities — before being put back on, albeit without the music broadcasting that previously accompanied the factual content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gendered impact of the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan will doubtless manifest itself in many contexts, and take time to evolve. A corollary of the exclusion of women from consequential social roles outside the private sphere may be to tilt women’s participation towards non-state armed groups, thus adding to the germinal layers of violent extremism. Margolin notes that, when Islamic State emerged “from the ashes of Al Qaida in Iraq”, it used female suicide bombers while US troops were still in the country. “The use of women in combat roles” had a dual purpose: “both shaming men into action and allowing for women’s participation under special circumstances” (Margolin 2019, p. 44). However, this changed after the end of US combat operations, she notes, with women then explicitly encouraged, by ideologues of the group, to remain in the home. For Afghanistan, then — with a persistent threat from an offshoot of the same organisation, Islamic State–Khorasan Province, or IS–KP, but now similarly emptied of international forces — the auguries, with regard to the impact on gender roles, are mixed. However, this specific issue, of women’s potential participation in violent extremist activity, did not crop up as story material of interest to the journalists in the training programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-limitations&quot;&gt;3. Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from the comparative content analysis could be expected to show how far Afghan journalists could change the content of the news they produce, to incorporate more Peace Journalism, under the controlled conditions of a sustained intervention in training and mentorship, in which they participated with permission and support from their editors and employers. Such a study cannot, by itself, indicate the likelihood of a change in news content overall, even from participating journalists, following the conclusion of such an intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoemaker and Reese (1996) model influences on news content in a “hierarchy”, arranged on five nested (though often overlapping) levels: (1) personal influences, operating directly on the individual journalist; (2) professional influences (reporting routines and news values); (3) organizational influences (economic imperatives and editorial control); (4) extra-media influences (including threats and intimidation from state and non-state actors); and (5) broader societal influences. The nature of a training course, intended to take effect by resourcing participants to exert greater individual agency in their professional work, points to levels (1) and (2) of this model as fields of influence, but not the other levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant factor, which could be expected to influence the conduct and content of news — and therefore required allowances to be made in the coding — concerned the working lives of journalists amid a rapidly tightening set of constraints on media freedom. A report released in 2023 by the International Federation of Journalists referenced “unprecedented restrictions on journalists and media”, and cited a survey by its Afghan affiliate union, according to which just 292 out of 579 media outlets previously operating in the country were still in business. “Women journalists have been especially hard hit”, it went on, and “80 percent of women journalists in Afghanistan lost their jobs”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IFJ report specified the modalities of restriction on journalism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Numerous players within the Taliban regularly intervene in media affairs. The Ministry of Information and Culture (MoIC), the Government Media Information Center (GMIC), and the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue (MPVV) have all issued vague rules with unclear legal bases or consequences for the media… Other rules call on media to refer to the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan”, respect Islamic values, and coordinate reporting with state overseers. Meanwhile, General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) operatives have cracked down on the press, by watching, detaining, and beating journalists and visiting newsrooms to threaten workers and complain about coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these factors were built into the coding, with an additional indicator denoted by the concept of a “framework of understanding” (FWU). Many items, in both the pre-training and post-training samples, included interview material with non-elite sources to score in the people-orientation of the PJ model, which previous research has shown is the most widespread aspect of take-up among alumni of such courses as in the present example (Lynch and Tiripelli 2022). Lynch and McGoldrick (2005) characterise the training or pedagogical issue, arising from such a practice, in the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The challenge is to convey their connection with the conflict, and the outlook for its likely development, in the course of a news story… you need… to construct a framework of understanding, in which the relevance of new perspectives to the story… can be made clear” (Lynch and McGoldrick 2005, pp. 165–66, emphasis in the original). To make the relevance clear, in the repressive context spelled out in the IFJ report, of sub-elite initiatives to support the visibility or social participation of women, would carry obvious risks. In the coding, therefore, especial care was taken to detect even the most inferential signalling of this kind, and denote it through adopting a separate Framework of Understanding indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Peace journalism is supported by framing theory”, Lee and Maslog (2005) point out, and Entman (1993) indicates an active role for framing with the formulation of “making salient” the archetypical factors of “problem definition, moral evaluation and causal explanation”, on the one hand, as validating different “treatment recommendations”, on the other. To make them salient, he continues, requires more than the provision of “scattered oppositional facts” to “challenge a dominant frame”, thereby enabling and activating critical thinking, in fulfilment of the PJM heading of truth-orientation. The samples both before and after the training and mentorship programme included some stories that merely presented “feature material”, typically about ordinary Afghans going about their daily business — in a generalized social context, to be sure, but without explicit connecting content between them. So, these were coded at 0 for FWU, whereas stories that did make such explicit connections were coded at 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-results-and-discussion&quot;&gt;4. Results and Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 30 participating journalists in the training and mentorship programme were asked to submit up to five articles each, as examples of their work on any aspect of conflict (broadly defined) from before the training, for analysis. This yielded a baseline sample of 80 articles, with the oldest dating from 2017, up to and including the period since the Taliban takeover in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the training workshop and with mentorship from trainers, they then created, published, and/or broadcast a total of 85 articles between them, in which they attempted to apply the principles presented in the training to stories on any aspect of conflict (again, broadly defined). These were gathered and submitted for comparative analysis, using the same evaluative criteria. Table 2 shows results from the content analysis before the training and mentorship programme, and Table 3 shows results from content analysis after the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4B6LKnW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3. War Journalism and Peace Journalism coding, after training. Post-training n = 85.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the pre-training sample, n = 80, so the maximum score for each category, WJ and PJ, was 320. Overall, this sample showed a WJ quotient of 73, or 23%, and a PJ quotient of 67, or 21%. Under half of these (45%) showed how the material being reported on fitted in with broader themes of conflict, in a framework of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the post-training sample, n = 85, so the maximum score for each category, WJ and PJ, was 340. Overall, this sample showed a WJ quotient of 18, or 5%, and a PJ quotient of 183, or 57%. Fully 68 out of the sample of 85 (or 80%) constructed a framework of understanding in which connections, between the sources for the stories, their words and deeds, and larger or more general issues of conflict, were clearly indicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a comparison of coding between the two raters, Scott’s pi was calculated at 0.91, indicating a high level of agreement. For comparison, in the Lee and Maslog study (Lee and Maslog 2005) quoted above, “a coding of 100 stories produced Scott’s pi of between 0.76 and 0.93”, on a range of different dyads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;41-pre-training-examples&quot;&gt;4.1. Pre-Training Examples&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly all the trainees were performing some aspects of PJ in their existing reporting, chiefly in the people-orientation. The material covered a wide range of different story types and media, from amateur-style (possibly smartphone) video pictures stitched together in rudimentary edits, often with no reporter voiceover, to professionally shot and edited longer packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the more technically rudimentary pieces in the sample was a video piece of just over a minute’s duration about an Art Centre in Nangarhar province offering, on a voluntary basis, free education for orphans, including “girls up to the age of 12” — the oldest that are presently allowed to attend school under the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It edited together statements from two pupils, a boy and a girl, then the centre’s Director, who explained the initiative to camera. There was no reporter voiceover. It could, then, be assessed as a piece of PJ, in the domains of people- and peace-orientation, since it is contributing to quotidian security. A positive score was allotted for a framework of understanding. The example is worth dwelling on because it illustrated the subtlety of signalling that could be deemed, in the codebook and adjusted for context, to “count” in this respect. The girl pupil was interviewed in front of a background that prominently included a picture of a dove carrying an olive branch, perched on the barrel of a gun and causing it to bend downwards. As Fahmy and Neumann note, “the framing that occurs through visuals is… potentially more effective in communicating specific interpretation of news events than framing that occurs via print and/or in written and spoken parts of broadcast news” (Fahmy and Neumann 2012, p. NP4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to speculate that this visual juxtaposition, along with the evident joy and excitement of the young girl as she spoke about her studies, could lead audiences to respond by referencing this situation to the controversy over girls’ school attendance at the secondary stage. Whether consciously or not, that would potentially enter the process of meaning-making. Any who viewed the article after 27 March 2023 would also most likely be aware of the arrest of Matiullah Wesa, an “education activist… [who] helped to set up or restore schools. And along the way, emboldened whole communities to keep pushing for greater education opportunities” (Latifi 2023).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A report of a car bomb in Logar province, dating from the early days after the Taliban takeover in 2021, was allotted a War Journalism point for violence-orientation, but also some Peace Journalism points. These included a people-orientation, as local citizens spoke about the impact on them and their community, but also the provincial governor, Abdul Qayum Rahimi, offering his analysis of the nature and extent of Taliban responsibility for the blast, blame for which was not explicitly apportioned, in the piece, to any one group. Instead, in general terms, the governor said: “Talib is a ceiling and different groups work under this ceiling like Jesh Mohammad to Al-Qaida, Tajik militants, Uzbek militants, Kazakh, Arora, Pakistanis all are those groups that fight in Logar and empower the Taliban” — thus scoring positively under the supplementary indication for a framework of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an issue that clearly needs careful handling and response. On the one hand, pointing the finger at ethnic minorities can clearly be dangerous. On the other, the governor was not alone in raising the alarm over the need for the Taliban authorities to take concrete steps to distance and dissociate themselves from non-state armed groups, to allow clearer and more effective policies to counter violent extremism. In a sample piece that included a television interview with EU Special Representative Tomas Niklasson, the latter stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Afghanistan’s USD$9 billion capital that is outside Afghanistan, this capital has been frozen due to the type of takeover of power by Taliban. It’s a normal procedure. No other country has tried to make the frozen capital closed to Afghanistan, but USA is the leading country in this regard. The reasons for freezing this money are these: that there isn’t any description of Afghanistan Bank independence, there isn’t any description of the Afghanistan Bank for preventing the use of this money for terrorist activities, and this money cannot be given to Afghanistan until an assurance is provided in this regard. You can always see a half empty glass, but I see it as a half glass of water and if Taliban take reasonable measures, some amount of this money will be released and all the money should be transferred back to Afghanistan in the future”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the submitted sample material dated from before the Taliban takeover. A report from RTA Afghanistan, the state broadcaster, offered a highly professional piece of television War Journalism: a facility with a military patrol shown discovering and defusing enemy munitions secreted by Taliban forces in or near Kabul. A transcript of a television studio discussion from Sediqa Faramarz referred to Abdullah Abdullah as leading negotiations on behalf of the Afghan government, and US and UK troops entering the country. Both arguably exemplified the dominant War Journalism settings of reporting under the Republic, as recorded in content analysis by Lynch and Freear (2023). A typical excerpt from the latter showed a victory orientation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The First Vice President of the Republic says that we will not accept any kind of conditions and any kind of compromise of Taliban rule to the people of Afghanistan, and we will not agree to any kind of deal and conditions that the Taliban will comply with. For any reason, we will not accept the peace of Taliban for the people of Afghanistan, and we will not agree to any deal dictated by the Taliban”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By way of contrast, a more recent submission from the same trainee, though still in the pre-training sample, contained transcripts of several video news stories illustrating social problems and challenges, with sources recommending cooperation, even efforts to engender peace, as solutions. These adopted a strong watchdog role, pointing up situations where governmental action under the Islamic Emirate departed from its apparent commitments, or was criticised by international organisations, but also giving credit for a successful effort by Afghanistan to reduce corruption, as reflected by its improving position in the “league table” compiled by Transparency International, since the change of regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;42-post-training-examples&quot;&gt;4.2. Post-Training Examples&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following articles from the “after” sample were among those with noteworthy elements of content, based on the observations above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story for Deutsche Welle, “Scholars”, aired on 26 May 2023 as the training was still underway, exemplified several aspects of PJ. It represented an issue of conflict — girls’ education — over which many parties’ views are aired, including those of eminent Islamic scholars but also a student and political commentators. The representation was not entirely dyadic, since the government’s position was nuanced, in some ways contradictory and possibly evolving. The article heard from sources about the impact on national productivity of keeping girls from being educated. It was conflict-oriented, people-oriented, truth-oriented, and solution-oriented. It constructed a framework of understanding in which everyday lived reality was connected to broader conflict issues. Those criticising the Taliban’s rescission of education rights for girls beyond elementary level appeared in roles allotted by Fahmy and Neumann, in a study of visual effects in news about conflict, as belonging to the Peace Journalism end of the spectrum, being “negotiators or demonstrators… [rather than] victims [or] belligerents” (Fahmy and Neumann 2012, p. NP 17).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story titled “Carpet”, for a television channel, Khama News, showed girls forced out of school who now worked as weavers in a nearby factory. It carried the now familiar line that the government was working towards re-opening schools for girls, which, again, provided a solution orientation. The comments from the girls themselves, which included an observation that the schools had now been closed for 600 days, may be interpreted in context as truth-orientation, prompting and enabling the reader to see through propaganda. This is mentioned here as an example of the subtle inferential coding required to detect salient framing content in the process of meaning-making in the Afghan context of 2023. To select such an example for attention, in the context of a news channel, may reflect the resourcefulness required of the journalist operating in constrained conditions, typical of non-Western settings, and adopting an approach that Hussain characterises as “critical pragmatism… [which] focuses on practice and at the same time, is aware of the structures that contribute to systemic inequalities in the outcomes. To ensure more purposeful activities, it stresses on critical reflections to develop better solutions to the social problems” (Hussain 2022, p. 117).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A transcript from an Azadi Radio newsmagazine programme showed how international agencies, including the World Food Programme, were being forced to suspend their operations in Afghanistan, blaming interference by the Taliban authorities. The segment was scored positively in the Peace Journalism coding categories of being peace-and-conflict oriented, by explaining backgrounds and contexts, including the economic disruption brought about by the change of government; people-oriented, by interviewing social actors from sub-elite levels; and solution-oriented, due to the time given over to allowing these interviewees to call for specific policy responses to alleviate the situation. It constructed a framework of understanding in which their perspectives could be seen as directly relevant to broader conflict issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;43-coding-for-gender&quot;&gt;4.3. Coding for Gender&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gradual withdrawal of US and allied forces starting in May 2021 enabled the Taliban’s military takeover of the entire country by August of that year, thus reducing the level of direct violence and bringing peace to the country, on “the most popular (Western) view… as an absence of war [which is] also the primary dictionary definition” (Rummel 1981). This, in turn, delivered security, but only of a kind which “assumes a short-term outlook and presents physical threats as the main risks, largely overlooking the long-term drivers of insecurity”, according to a critical expert group in the UK. It “proposes to respond by extending control over the strategic environment, achieved principally through offensive military capabilities, a superpower alliance, and restrictions on civil liberties” (Ammerdown Group 2016, p. 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reardon identifies this as a distinctively gendered view, since it sustains “the present highly militarized, war prone, patriarchal nation state system” (Reardon and Snauwaert 2015, p. 112). As an alternative, she shows how peace and social activism by women, in a range of contexts, bequeath a concept of human security as “in essence the conditions that make possible the experience and expectation of well-being” (ibid., p. 117).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This connects with the typical concerns of such activism, which “stem from… conditions of quotidian security for families and communities… They have been active in environmental protection movements, efforts to overcome and compensate for poverty, the human rights movement for gender equality and rights of the excluded and oppressed” (Reardon and Snauwaert 2015, p. 120).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the post-training sample, such concerns are prominent, notably over the lack of access to education for girls of secondary school age, but also including the unmet humanitarian needs of the Afghan population. These issues can be seen, therefore, as elements of a consciously re-gendered security concept, with salience to the Afghan context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the connection is made in some of the articles between provision for women’s rights, on the one hand, and protecting communities from a recrudescence of non-state armed groups, on the other. In an episode of Shamshad News, submitted by trainee Sabir Khan, reports from an international conclave quoted a Russian spokesperson as criticising Western countries for “isolating” Afghanistan. It was “not easy to fight against terrorism alone”, the programme voice-over observed. To the extent that this isolation is linked with Taliban refusal to allow women to work for agencies in the country, the programme interviewed an analyst, Shir Hasan Hasan, who commented: “The Taliban should take themselves out of isolation to success in this regard and they should work on national and international legitimacy, they should work on Afghanistan’s constitution, they should work on the freedom of political and civil activities, and they should work on women’s rights”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research in Afghan communities before the Taliban takeover highlighted “everyday peace indicators” (Firchow and Mac Ginty 2017), or community-sourced indicators of change, perceived as important by the people themselves, according to a USIP study based on FGD data. A thousand participants from 18 villages in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar and Kunar provinces nominated, as a community indicator for peace while countering violent extremism, “the visibility of women and girls — especially seeing them going to school and traveling to the market. This indicator was universally prioritized by men, women, and youth interviewees, implying that women’s mobility is equated with feelings of security across demographics” (Urwin and Ahmadi 2018, p. 3). The clear consonance with Reardon’s emphasis on the “quotidian” in a re-gendered definition of security represents another sign that journalism by the Afghan trainees, after training, was constructing and exploring a set of security issues as yet untackled by the country’s new rulers, who were, in some cases, credibly presented as making them worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Emirati authorities could deploy force around their territory where necessary, including in “crackdowns” on rare open fronts of internal dissent — but only at the risk of overriding the everyday expectation and experience of wellbeing, and exacerbating the long-term drivers of insecurity. Again, the experiences of women, in such security contexts, could be seen as a touchstone. Latifi (2022) quotes Sadullah, a villager from Panjshir province, on the impact of the Taliban armed security response to the NRF insurgency: “Sadullah said he had tried to make the best of the situation back in Panjshir, but the presence of up to 150 Taliban fighters in their village made resuming normal life impossible. ‘We are a traditional people’, he explained. ‘Our women didn’t feel comfortable going out with strange Taliban fighters around’”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted above, Peace Journalism is “supported by framing theory” (Lee and Maslog 2005). The dominant context-specific, gender-adjusted framing according to the elements in Entman’s formulation (Entman 1993) — to “make salient… [the] moral evaluation, problem definition, causal explanation and treatment recommendation” in the representation of a typical contested or ambiguous social scenario — can be read, from the post-training articles, in the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A moral evaluation that depriving girls and women of opportunities is wrong;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A problem definition that includes violation of their human rights, as well as more pragmatic, consequentialist issues such as alienating the international community whose support is needed for both humanitarian relief and security, and leading to increased outward migration, thus costing Afghanistan human capital and talent;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A causal explanation that these problems are connected with doctrinaire decisions by the Emirati authorities;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treatment recommendations that involve changes in policy, with not-infrequent signs that debate among the Taliban rulers is underway, and also referred to Islamic scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;44-implications-for-future-media-development-aid&quot;&gt;4.4. Implications for Future Media Development Aid&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trainees produced a strong and impressive body of Peace Journalism after the training. This shows a “benefit applied”: a key indicator, in a proposal from a senior practitioner Alan Davis of the London-based Institute for War and Peace Reporting, in monitoring and evaluating interventions in media development aid. Such initiatives all contain a “benefit transferred”, he writes; what is more valuable is when trainees then change the content of their reporting to reflect the new ideas. A third category is the “benefit beyond” or the expected influence on audience meaning-making, source behaviours, and/or societal development as a whole (Davis 2008, pp. 90–91).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may have specific benefits for communities at risk from violent extremism such as the activities — and messaging to match — promulgated by such groups as IS–KP. Communication by such groups is akin to marketing, a recent policy guide by USAID notes. However, it is likely that “counter-narratives” are ineffective. Instead, “communication strategies should convey accessible alternatives that dilute the potency of violent extremists’ arguments while creating positive identities, opportunities for engagement, and expressions of agency” — that relate to the concerns and priorities of people, and are thereby closely akin to the orientations of Peace Journalism and the coding adopted to operationalise them in the Afghan context of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How far can this Peace Journalism training, for journalists in the new Afghanistan, afford insights capable of informing future interventions, and capable of taking effect by delivering benefits both applied and beyond? Lynch and Freear (2023) cite evidence from grey literature of specialist agencies being forced to adapt as international support for the media sector was “drawn down”, in the early 2000s. Some such aid continued to be available, albeit under the Islamic Republic government, and supplemented by paid advertising on behalf of international organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afghan journalism and media may therefore offer continuing affordances for Peace Journalism training. Afghan journalists interviewed for the antecedent study “wanted to do more Peace Journalism” (Lynch and Freear 2023, np). Their role perceptions proved consonant with earlier findings by Mitra, who interviewed Afghan photojournalists, finding them motivated by a “wish to depict positive, peaceful Afghanistan”. This showed “concurrence with PJ norms and point[ed] to the opportunities for acceptance of PJ” (Mitra 2017, p. 23). In both of these studies, therefore, Afghan journalists’ role perceptions gravitated towards those of journalists in developing countries more generally. In the collaborative Worlds of Journalism study, in which over 6000 journalists, from 60 countries, were interviewed, the single most widespread ethical precept was “non-involvement” in the stories covered, or detached “reporting of the facts”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Western critics of Peace Journalism, such as the then BBC correspondent David Loyn, rejected it as an attempt to “prescribe” methods of reporting conflict — an approach that risked, he averred, creating a “new orthodoxy… [something that would be] uniquely unhelpful” to reporters in the field. Rather, Loyn argued, they should be left to decide how to report on a case-by-case basis, by empirical methods, save in certain circumstances — such as those covered by libel laws — where specified activities are “proscribed” (Loyn 2008, pp. 53–54). In the WoJ study, however, majority-world participants — drawn from countries in east Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America — tended to a different view. Their responses revealed ethical precepts which emphasised values of “social intervention, national development and educating people” (Kalyango et al. 2017, p. 576).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Federation of Journalists report, referenced earlier, raises the alarm over a rupture in the system of support for Afghan journalists, catalysed by the collapse of the Republic and its replacement by the Taliban Islamic Emirate, with the consequent humanitarian crisis in the country now dominating the attention of aid agencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Though some media aid implementers are finding ways to continue working in Afghanistan, the overall system for news organisations to solicit support from donors and implementers has broken down. Donor governments are focused on diplomacy and humanitarian relief rather than media development”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, the United Nations was awaiting, from the Secretary General on a mandate directly from the Security Council, “forward-looking recommendations for an integrated and coherent approach [in the country] among relevant political, humanitarian, and development actors, within and outside of the United Nations”. These were due by mid-November 2023, with hopes high among some in the sector for the inclusion of a strategy to ensure “public access to information”, as called for in Goal 16, Target 10 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, some interventions were already underway, having been devised specifically for implementation in the newly restricted media space under the Taliban, and focused on conflict-sensitive or Peace Journalism content. UNESCO announced a new partnership with the European Union in late 2022, to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Provide support to Afghan media outlets in the production of conflict-sensitive, humanitarian, health and educational public interest content. The project will benefit at least 6 million Afghan citizens, with a specific focus on reporting addressed at women, girls and youth. UNESCO will also be partnering with civil society organizations and local journalists’ unions to train an estimated six hundred journalists on conflict-sensitive reporting”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of this research, showing how such training can lead to changes in the content of news produced by Afghan journalists, suggest the potential of such initiatives to yield measurable results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IFJ, for its part, called on “aid [to be] directed towards independent media. International supporters can facilitate communication among Afghan media outlets and encourage the strengthening of inter-organisational associations. Though such groups, media and CSOs can form a united front to engage both the Taliban and international donor community”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results from the comparative content analysis of articles by the same journalists before and after undergoing training in Peace Journalism indicate the potential impact of such interventions at the level of a media approach to be applied, and to catalyse new creative practices, awareness, and critical reflexivity of particular importance amidst the highly emotive words and deeds of violent extremists. On a second level, changes to journalists’ professional environment, stimulating new techniques for fieldwork and news production, can sustain and spread the impact of the first. This can, in turn, lead to new relations with sources and other social groups, collaborating to create “public records of truth” (Waisbord 2019, p. 4), surfacing hitherto under-reported voices and issues. On a fourth level, Davis’ notion of a “benefit beyond” may be discerned in a public furnished with access to information that prompts and enables their appreciation of nonviolent policy responses to conflict issues foregrounded by ambiguous causal scenarios, identified as a crucial component of both communication for sustainable development and community resilience against communication strategies by groups associated with violent extremism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peace Journalism training can be effective, therefore, even among a group of participating trainees who face significant constraints in their working lives and pressure on a range of issues evident in the everyday lives of their readers and audiences, which present themselves for journalistic attention and coverage. With ongoing mentorship and encouragement to adapt the PJ approach to the exigencies of conflict, discernible extra value can be added to the supply of news reaching publics who remain vulnerable to the messaging of authoritarian rulers and violent extremists alike. Such interventions can deliver benefits both applied in news coverage itself and potentially beyond the training to enable cognitive resources to be developed and brought to bear in communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attritional wars require their own “Art of War” and are fought with a “force-centric” approach, unlike wars of manoeuvre which are “terrain-focused”. They are rooted in massive industrial capacity to enable the replacement of losses, geographical depth to absorb a series of defeats, and technological conditions that prevent rapid ground movement. In attritional wars, military operations are shaped by a state’s ability to replace losses and generate new formations, not tactical and operational manoeuvres. The side that accepts the attritional nature of war and focuses on destroying enemy forces rather than gaining terrain is most likely to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West is not prepared for this kind of war. To most Western experts, attritional strategy is counterintuitive. Historically, the West preferred the short “winner takes all” clash of professional armies. Recent war games such as CSIS’s war over Taiwan covered one month of fighting. The possibility that the war would go on never entered the discussion. This is a reflection of a common Western attitude. Wars of attrition are treated as exceptions, something to be avoided at all costs and generally products of leaders’ ineptitude. Unfortunately, wars between near-peer powers are likely to be attritional, thanks to a large pool of resources available to replace initial losses. The attritional nature of combat, including the erosion of professionalism due to casualties, levels the battlefield no matter which army started with better trained forces. As conflict drags on, the war is won by economies, not armies. States that grasp this and fight such a war via an attritional strategy aimed at exhausting enemy resources while preserving their own are more likely to win. The fastest way to lose a war of attrition is to focus on manoeuvre, expending valuable resources on near-term territorial objectives. Recognising that wars of attrition have their own art is vital to winning them without sustaining crippling losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-economic-dimension&quot;&gt;The Economic Dimension&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wars of attrition are won by economies enabling mass mobilisation of militaries via their industrial sectors. Armies expand rapidly during such a conflict, requiring massive quantities of armoured vehicles, drones, electronic products, and other combat equipment. Because high-end weaponry is very complex to manufacture and consumes vast resources, a high-low mixture of forces and weapons is imperative in order to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-end weapons have exceptional performance but are difficult to manufacture, especially when needed to arm a rapidly mobilised army subjected to a high rate of attrition. For example, during the Second World War German Panzers were superb tanks, but using approximately the same production resources, the Soviets rolled out eight T-34s for every German Panzer. The difference in performance did not justify the numerical disparity in production. High-end weapons also require high-end troops. These take significant time to train – time which is unavailable in a war with high attrition rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easier and faster to produce large numbers of cheap weapons and munitions, especially if their subcomponents are interchangeable with civilian goods, ensuring mass quantity without the expansion of production lines. New recruits also absorb simpler weapons faster, allowing rapid generation of new formations or the reconstitution of existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving mass is difficult for higher-end Western economies. To achieve hyper-efficiency, they shed excess capacity and struggle to rapidly expand, especially since lower-tier industries have been transferred abroad for economic reasons. During war, global supply chains are disrupted and subcomponents can no longer be secured. Added to this conundrum is the lack of a skilled workforce with experience in a particular industry. These skills are acquired over decades, and once an industry is shuttered it takes decades to rebuild. The 2018 US government interagency report on US industrial capacity highlighted these problems. The bottom line is that the West must take a hard look at ensuring peacetime excess capacity in its military industrial complex, or risk losing the next war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;force-generation&quot;&gt;Force Generation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial output exists so it can be channelled into replacing losses and generating new formations. This requires appropriate doctrine and command and control structures. There are two main models; NATO (most Western armies) and the old Soviet model, with most states fielding something in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO armies are highly professional, backed by a strong non-commissioned officer (NCO) Corps, with extensive peacetime military education and experience. They build upon this professionalism for their military doctrine (fundamentals, tactics and techniques) to stress individual initiative, delegating a great deal of leeway to junior officers and NCOs. NATO formations enjoy tremendous agility and flexibility to exploit opportunities on a dynamic battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In attritional war, this method has a downside. The officers and NCOs required to execute this doctrine require extensive training and, above all, experience. A US Army NCO takes years to develop. A squad leader generally has at least three years in service and a platoon sergeant has at least seven. In an attritional war characterised by heavy casualties, there simply isn’t time to replace lost NCOs or generate them for new units. The idea that civilians can be given three-month training courses, sergeant’s chevrons and then expected to perform in the same manner as a seven-year veteran is a recipe for disaster. Only time can generate leaders capable of executing NATO doctrine, and time is one thing that the massive demands of attritional war do not give.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Soviet Union built its army for large-scale conflict with NATO. It was intended to be able to rapidly expand by calling up massed reserves. Every male in the Soviet Union underwent two years of basic training right out of high school. The constant turnover of enlisted personnel precluded creation of a Western-style NCO corps but generated a massive pool of semi-trained reserves available in times of war. The absence of reliable NCOs created an officer-centric command model, less flexible than NATO’s but more adaptable to the large-scale expansion required by attritional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as a war progresses past a one-year mark, front-line units will gain experience and an improved NCO corps is likely to emerge, giving the Soviet model greater flexibility. By 1943, the Red Army had developed a robust NCO corps, which then disappeared after the Second World War as combat formations were demobilised. A key difference between the models is that NATO doctrine cannot function without high-performing NCOs. The Soviet doctrine was enhanced by experienced NCOs but did not require them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Instead of a decisive battle achieved through rapid manoeuvre, attritional war focuses on destroying enemy forces and their ability to regenerate combat power, while preserving one’s own&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective model is a mixture of the two, in which a state maintains a medium-sized professional army, together with a mass of draftees available for mobilisation. This leads directly to a high/low mixture. Professional pre-war forces form the high end of this army, becoming fire brigades – moving from sector to sector in battle to stabilise the situation and conduct decisive attacks. Low-end formations hold the line and gain experience slowly, increasing their quality until they gain the capability to conduct offensive operations. Victory is attained by creating the highest quality low-end formations possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forging new units into combat-capable soldiers instead of civilian mobs is done through training and combat experience. A new formation should train for at least six months, and only if manned by reservists with previous individual training. Conscripts take longer. These units should also have professional soldiers and NCOs brought in from the pre-war army to add professionalism. Once initial training is complete, they should only be fed into the battle in secondary sectors. No formation should be allowed to fall below 70% strength. Withdrawing formations early allows experience to proliferate among the new replacements as veterans pass on their skills. Otherwise, valuable experience is lost, causing the process to start all over. Another implication is that resources should prioritise replacements over new formations, preserving combat edge in both the pre-war army (high) and newly raised (low) formations. It’s advisable to disband several pre-war (high-end) formations to spread professional soldiers among newly created low-end formations in order to raise initial quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-military-dimension&quot;&gt;The Military Dimension&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military operations in an attritional conflict are very distinct from those in a war of manoeuvre. Instead of a decisive battle achieved through rapid manoeuvre, attritional war focuses on destroying enemy forces and their ability to regenerate combat power, while preserving one’s own. In this context, a successful strategy accepts that the war will last at least two years and be broken into two distinct phases. The first phase ranges from initiation of hostilities to the point where sufficient combat power has been mobilised to allow decisive action. It will see little positional shifting on the ground, focusing on favourable exchange of losses and building up combat power in the rear. The dominant form of combat is fires rather than manoeuvre, complemented by extensive fortifications and camouflage. The peacetime army starts the war and conducts holding actions, providing time to mobilise resources and train the new army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second phase can commence after one side has met the following conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Newly mobilised forces have completed their training and gained sufficient experience to make them combat-effective formations, capable of rapidly integrating all their assets in a cohesive manner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The enemy’s strategic reserve is exhausted, leaving it unable to reinforce the threatened sector.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fires and reconnaissance superiority are achieved, allowing the attacker to effectively mass fires on a key sector while denying the enemy the same.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The enemy’s industrial sector is degraded to the point where it is unable to replace battlefield losses. In the case of fighting against a coalition of countries, their industrial resources must also be exhausted or at least accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only after meeting these criteria should offensive operations commence. They should be launched across a broad front, seeking to overwhelm the enemy at multiple points with shallow attacks. The intent is to remain inside a layered bubble of friendly protective systems, while stretching depleted enemy reserves until the front collapses. Only then should the offensive extend towards objectives deeper in the enemy rear. Concentration of forces on one main effort should be avoided as this gives an indication of the offensive’s location and an opportunity for the enemy to concentrate their reserves against this key point. The Brusilov Offensive of 1916, which resulted in the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian army, is a good example of a successful attritional offensive at the tactical and operational level. By attacking along a broad front, the Russian army prevented the Austro-Hungarians from concentrating their reserves, resulting in a collapse all along the front. At the strategic level, however, the Brusilov Offensive is an example of failure. Russian forces failed to set conditions against the whole enemy coalition, focusing only on the Austro-Hungarian Empire and neglecting German capacity. The Russians expended crucial resources which they could not replace, without defeating the strongest coalition member. To reemphasise the key point, an offensive will only succeed once key criteria are met. Attempting to launch an offensive earlier will result in losses without any strategic gains, playing directly into enemy hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modern-war&quot;&gt;Modern War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern battlefield is an integrated system of systems which includes various types of electronic warfare (EW), three basic types of air defences, four different types of artillery, countless aircraft types, strike and reconnaissance drones, construction and sapper engineers, traditional infantry, armour formations and, above all, logistics. Artillery has become more dangerous thanks to increased ranges and advanced targeting, stretching the depth of the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means it is easier to mass fires than forces. Deep manoeuvre, which requires the massing of combat power, is no longer possible because any massed force will be destroyed by indirect fires before it can achieve success in depth. Instead, a ground offensive requires a tight protective bubble to ward off enemy strike systems. This bubble is generated through layering friendly counter-fire, air defence and EW assets. Moving numerous interdependent systems is highly complicated and unlikely to be successful. Shallow attacks along the forward line of troops are most likely to be successful at an acceptable cost ratio; attempts at deep penetration will be exposed to massed fires the moment they exit the protection of the defensive bubble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integration of these overlapping assets requires centralised planning and exceptionally well-trained staff officers, capable of integrating multiple capabilities on the fly. It takes years to train such officers, and even combat experience does not generate such skills in a short time. Checklists and mandatory procedures can alleviate these deficiencies, but only on a less-complicated, static front. Dynamic offensive operations require fast reaction times, which semi-trained officers are incapable of performing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of this complexity is an attack by a platoon of 30 soldiers. This would require EW systems to jam enemy drones; another EW system to jam enemy communications preventing adjustment of enemy fires; and a third EW system to jam space navigation systems denying use of precision guided munitions. In addition, fires require counterbattery radars to defeat enemy artillery. Further complicating planning is the fact that enemy EW will locate and destroy any friendly radar or EW emitter that is emitting for too long. Engineers will have to clear paths through minefields, while friendly drones provide time-sensitive ISR and fire support if needed. (This task requires a great deal of training with the supporting units to avoid dropping munitions on friendly attacking troops.) Finally, artillery needs to provide support both on the objective and enemy rear, targeting reserves and suppressing artillery. All these systems need to work as an integrated team just to support 30 men in several vehicles attacking another 30 men or less. A lack of coordination between these assets will result in failed attacks and horrific losses without ever seeing the enemy. As the size of formation conducting operations increases, so do the number and complexity of assets that need to be integrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-for-combat-operations&quot;&gt;Implications for Combat Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep fires – further than 100–150 km (the average range of tactical rockets) behind the front line – target an enemy’s ability to generate combat power. This includes production facilities, munitions dumps, repair depots, and energy and transportation infrastructure. Of particular importance are targets that require significant production capabilities and that are difficult to replace/repair, as their destruction will inflict long term damage. As with all aspects of attritional war, such strikes will take significant time to have an effect, with timelines running into years. The low global production volumes of long-range precision-guided munitions, effective deception and concealment actions, large stockpiles of anti-aircraft missiles and the sheer repair capacities of strong, determined states all combine to prolong conflicts. Effective layering of air defences must include high-end systems at all altitudes coupled with cheaper systems to counter the enemy’s massed low-end attack platforms. Combined with mass-scale manufacturing and effective EW, this is the only way to defeat enemy deep fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Victory in an attritional war is assured by careful planning, industrial base development and development of mobilisation infrastructure in times of peace, and even more careful management of resources in wartime&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful attritional war focuses on the preservation of one’s own combat power. This usually translates into a relatively static front interrupted by limited local attacks to improve positions, using artillery for most of the fighting. Fortification and concealment of all forces including logistics is the key to minimising losses. The long time required to construct fortifications prevents significant ground movement. An attacking force which cannot rapidly entrench will suffer significant losses from enemy artillery fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defensive operations buy time to develop low-end combat formations, allowing newly mobilised troops to gain combat experience without suffering heavy losses in large-scale attacks. Building up experienced low-tier combat formations generates the capability for future offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early stages of attritional war range from initiation of hostilities to the point where mobilised resources are available in large numbers and are ready for combat operations. In the case of a surprise attack, a rapid offensive by one side may be possible until the defender can form a solid front. After that, combat solidifies. This period lasts at least a year-and-a-half to two years. During this period, major offensive operations should be avoided. Even if large attacks are successful, they will result in significant casualties, often for meaningless territorial gains. An army should never accept a battle on unfavourable terms. In attritional war, any terrain that does not have a vital industrial centre is irrelevant. It is always better to retreat and preserve forces, regardless of the political consequences. Fighting on disadvantageous terrain burns up units, losing experienced soldiers who are key to victory. The German obsession with Stalingrad in 1942 is a prime example of fighting on unfavourable terrain for political reasons. Germany burned up vital units that it could not afford to lose, simply to capture a city bearing Stalin’s name. It is also wise to push the enemy into fighting on disadvantageous terrain through information operations, exploiting politically sensitive enemy objectives. The goal is to force the enemy to expend vital material and strategic reserves on strategically meaningless operations. A key pitfall to avoid is being dragged into the very same trap that has been set for the enemy. In the First World War, Germans did just that at Verdun, where it planned to use surprise to capture key, politically sensitive terrain, provoking costly French counterattacks. Unfortunately for the Germans, they fell into their own trap. They failed to gain key, defendable terrain early on, and the battle devolved instead into a series of costly infantry assaults by both sides, with artillery fires devastating attacking infantry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the second phase begins, the offensive should be launched across a broad front, seeking to overwhelm the enemy at multiple points using shallow attacks. The intent is to remain inside the layered bubble of friendly protective systems, while stretching depleted enemy reserves until the front collapses. There is a cascading effect in which a crisis in one sector forces the defenders to shift reserves from a second sector, only to generate a crisis there in turn. As forces start falling back and leaving prepared fortifications, morale plummets, with the obvious question: “If we can’t hold the mega-fortress, how can we hold these new trenches?” Retreat then turns into rout. Only then should the offensive extend towards objectives deeper in the enemy rear. The Allies’ Offensive in 1918 is an example. The Allies attacked along a broad front, while the Germans lacked sufficient resources to defend the entire line. Once the German Army began to retreat it proved impossible to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attritional strategy, centred on defence, is counterintuitive to most Western military officers. Western military thought views the offensive as the only means of achieving the decisive strategic goal of forcing the enemy to come to the negotiating table on unfavourable terms. The strategic patience required to set the conditions for an offensive runs against their combat experience acquired in overseas counterinsurgency operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conduct of attritional wars is vastly different from wars of manoeuvre. They last longer and end up testing a country’s industrial capacity. Victory is assured by careful planning, industrial base development and development of mobilisation infrastructure in times of peace, and even more careful management of resources in wartime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victory is attainable by carefully analysing one’s own and the enemy’s political objectives. The key is recognising the strengths and weaknesses of competing economic models and identifying the economic strategies that are most likely to generate maximum resources. These resources can then be utilised to build a massive army using the high/low force and weapons mixture. The military conduct of war is driven by overall political strategic objectives, military realities and economic limitations. Combat operations are shallow and focus on destroying enemy resources, not on gaining terrain. Propaganda is used to support military operations, not the other way around. With patience and careful planning, a war can be won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many in the West have a very cavalier attitude that future conflicts will be short and decisive. This is not true for the very reasons outlined above. Even middling global powers have both the geography and the population and industrial resources needed to conduct an attritional war. The thought that any major power would back down in the case of an initial military defeat is wishful thinking at its best. Any conflict between great powers would be viewed by adversary elites as existential and pursued with the full resources available to the state. The resulting war will become attritional and will favour the state which has the economy, doctrine and military structure that is better suited towards this form of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the West is serious about a possible great power conflict, it needs to take a hard look at its industrial capacity, mobilisation doctrine and means of waging a protracted war, rather than conducting wargames covering a single month of conflict and hoping that the war will end afterwards. As the Iraq War taught us, hope is not a method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問及G20登報計劃結束之後，李宇軒與T商討還款的細節。李宇軒供稱，他與 T 在7月的時候，就還款事宜在 Telegram 上溝通，大概意思是「T嗰邊」墊支過登報費，李問可以怎樣還款，T則說要安排一下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李前天提到，等待還款安排期間，T曾告訴他「上頭嘅人」對於「拖住嚿錢」感到不安，於是雙方簽訂借據。控方今追問，T有否告訴李，「上頭嘅人」實際上是指哪些人。李指沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問，T有否告訴李，為何「上頭嘅人」感到不安。李則指，因為墊支登廣告的公司「唔 suppose 係做登廣告嘅業務」，所以李理應盡快還款，以免「唔關公司本身業務嘅嘢喺度拖住」，不過他表示：「唔記得係我咁樣諗，定係佢同我講佢咁樣諗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李其後承認這是他的假設，因為籌辦G20登報的一般都是社運組織，「以我知道，Lais Hotel 和 Dico（力高）都唔係一啲 activist 嘅 organisation。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒簽借據時首次得知t真名為陳梓華&quot;&gt;李宇軒：簽借據時首次得知T真名為陳梓華&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李早前作供又指，他與T相約到金鐘力寶中心的一間咖啡店簽署借據，作為一個臨時措施（stop gap measure）。李今再解釋，若T手上有一份借據，T便可以跟「上面嘅人」說：「嗱，依家有 promissory note，條數一定會還嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問李是否記得借據上的「收款人」一欄寫什麼。李則表示記得有類似「收款人」一欄，但是不記得內容是什麼。他又指，合共有4個人在借據上簽名，包括他、T 和兩名見證人，期間「拎咗身份證出嚟畀大家睇」，但他不記得需否寫下身份證號碼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，在該次簽借據的過程中，是首次得知T真名叫陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認經chartwell-holding戶口還款156萬-惟陳梓華未有談及公司背景&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認經Chartwell Holding戶口還款156萬 惟陳梓華未有談及公司背景&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示李的銀行戶口紀錄，顯示李在2019年8月1日把100萬元轉帳至 Chartwell Holding，其後8月2日再次把約55.9萬元轉帳至 Chartwell Holding。李確認兩筆款項是用以清還有關G20登報的費用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李，陳梓華向他提供 Chartwell Holding 的戶口資料時，有否談及這間公司的背景。李回答沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱登報計劃15萬餘款捐給612基金&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱登報計劃15萬餘款捐給612基金&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指，據G20登報計劃的收支列表，該次錄得15萬港元餘款，問李當時如何處理這些餘款。李稱：「捐咗畀612。」控方追問「612」是什麼意思，李回答：「啫係612基金。」他又解釋，因為登報計劃有一筆餘款，「唔可以落袋」，因此後來將這筆餘款捐給612基金。控方再追問612基金是用作什麼目的，李僅指：「支援 legal fee 嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後問，612基金的全名是否「612人道支援基金」。李表示：「啱啱你幫我記得起佢全名，我淨係記得612。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何選擇捐給612基金，陳表示他理解612基金其中一項工作是支援被捕人士的法律開支，「咁係完全合法嘅，同埋我理解公眾唔會反對嘅」，所以當他們有一筆餘款時，「唔知做咩咁，同埋擔心有人唔知係咪袋咗自己袋」，所以便決定捐出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李有否就眾籌計劃接受過任何傳媒訪問。李表示記得在其中一次眾籌期間，《蘋果》曾經採訪過眾籌團隊，不過他不記得是6月那次眾籌，還是7月那次眾籌。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指2019年7月參與英國登報眾籌計劃-攬炒巴有份&quot;&gt;李宇軒指2019年7月參與英國登報眾籌計劃 「攬炒巴」有份&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李接著談及2019年7月的另一次眾籌計劃，是有關在英國登廣告的活動。他記得當時有一個人將「攬炒巴」介紹給他認識，「因為攬炒巴想喺英國嗰邊去搞眾籌登報，同埋相關嘅事。」李指，因為對方知道他籌辦G20登報眾籌「係幾成功」，所以便邀請他幫手「睇吓攬炒巴喺 crowdfund 嗰度有冇嘢可以幫到手」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李表示，當時知道「攬炒巴」即是「連登」討論區上一個帳號「我要攬炒」，「而連登上面男仔係叫『巴打』嘅」，所以「攬炒巴」便是這一個帳號。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李稱，後來他知道「攬炒巴」即是劉祖廸，因為大約在2019年尾至2020年初，陳梓華和「攬炒巴」與他曾經在網上平台 Jitsi 進行線上會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於李在是次眾籌的角色，李稱主要都是幫手處理眾籌。其他參與者包括「攬炒巴」、一個叫「Always」的人、向他介紹「攬炒巴」的人，以及後來有 Jack Hazlewood，其他參與者則記不起。他指是次活動「主要係攬炒巴嗰邊嘅人搞」，據他所知，運作模式與G20登報計劃相若，有的人處理眾籌，有的人聯絡報館，有的人設計廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指蘋果專欄作家jack-hazlewood借出銀行戶口接收眾籌款項&quot;&gt;李宇軒指《蘋果》專欄作家Jack Hazlewood借出銀行戶口接收眾籌款項&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，該次英國眾籌登報是關於1984年簽署的《中英聯合聲明》，而當時「攬炒巴」希望以此作為主題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就眾籌方法，李指在第一次就G20登報眾籌時使用的平台「GoGetFund」，手續費頗貴，當時籌到接近700萬元，但是卻扣除了50至60萬元手續費。於是他們找了另一個眾籌平台「gofundme.com」，可以選擇不給予貼士或手續費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指，不過在「攬炒巴嗰邊嘅人」當中，沒有人願意借出自己的銀行戶口作為眾籌的收款人。李當時認為，因為他在第一次眾籌時已經使用了其個人戶口，「即使再嚟多次，都唔會增加我嘅風險」，於是決定借出他的渣打銀行戶口去接收眾籌款項。惟後來李發現，「gofundme.com」規定款項必須經由英國開設的英鎊戶口接收，他不記得在陳梓華還是另一名群組成員的介紹下，最終認識了 Jack Hazlewood，對方亦同意借出銀行戶口。後來李知道 Jack Hazlewood 是「《蘋果》嘅寫手」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問李提到的「風險」是什麼意思。李指是被指控「洗黑錢」的風險，雖然他有妥善保存所有關於眾籌的單據，能夠證明到他不是「洗黑錢」，「但中間有畀人懷疑洗黑錢同埋凍結戶口的風險。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒陳梓華聲稱與黎智英食飯後-獲允使用蘋果新聞圖片&quot;&gt;李宇軒：陳梓華聲稱與黎智英食飯後 獲允使用《蘋果》新聞圖片&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續指：「後來我又知陳梓華識 Mark Simon 同肥佬黎」，當法庭翻譯主任把「肥佬黎」翻譯成「Fatty Lai」時，李補充道：「Sorry，黎智英。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李提到「攬炒巴」想使用當年簽署《中英聯合聲明》的新聞圖片，即是中方代表與時任英國首相戴卓爾夫人握手的相片。有組員留意到《蘋果》網站上有這一張相片，陳梓華聲稱會去問《蘋果日報》，李說：「嗰時 for some reasons，我覺得佢同《蘋果》有啲關係，之前我唔記得佢幾時暗示過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李轉述陳當時稱：「等佢（陳）下個禮拜四，咁佢去同唔記得『黎生』定係『肥佬黎』食飯嗰陣，佢（陳）就會問佢（黎）。」李表示：「嗰陣時我知，原來佢（陳）可以去同黎生食飯。跟住過咗禮拜四之後，T（陳梓華）就話：『張相OK喇。』」李稱，其後與《蘋果》職員經過一輪正式的電郵溝通，他們便可以使用高清版的新聞圖片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示一份《蘋果》報導〈遊行被圍捕險洩身份 攬炒巴死裏逃生 帶署歷警暴 拒保後返英〉，版面下方含有眾籌網站截圖，顯示計劃名稱是「中英聯合聲明登報」。李確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒稱第二次登報活動中再度墊支-控方指事後有餘款約20萬英鎊&quot;&gt;李宇軒稱第二次登報活動中再度墊支 控方指事後有餘款約20萬英鎊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指第一次的G20登報與第二次的「中英聯合聲明登報」眾籌，同樣遇到未能立即動用籌得款項的問題，所以李需要協助墊支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示李的銀行戶口紀錄，可見李在2019年7月19日至25日期間，先後向《旗幟晚報》（Evening Standard）、《衛報》（The Guardian）、台灣《自由時報》等合共6間媒體公司轉帳。李表示不肯定台灣《自由時報》那一次轉帳是關於「中英聯合聲明登報」計劃，還是第三次的眾籌活動，但其餘5間媒體公司的轉帳則確認有關。控方指，若果把台灣《自由時報》計算在內，李合共墊支了約10萬英鎊，即130萬港元。李確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指，李的銀行戶口紀錄顯示，Jack Henry Hazlewood 在2019年8月9日轉帳了約30.8萬英鎊給李。控方要求李確認第二次的登報活動錄得餘款約20萬英鎊，惟李表示不記得金額，但他相信控方的推論是正確。李亦記得該些餘款均存放在他的銀行戶口內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指眾籌餘款用以支付英國活動開支-實報實銷&quot;&gt;李宇軒指眾籌餘款用以支付英國活動開支 實報實銷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到如何處理這一筆餘款，李指「一路攬炒巴嗰邊呢，就將佢（餘款）用喺佢同英國相關嘅嘢度」，例如他們舉辦一個支持香港的集會，可能涉及零星開支，例如泊車費，那便會動用「中英聯合聲明登報」的餘款來支付。李指實際操作是有人先墊支，事後給他單據，他便會向相關人士還款。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官杜麗冰問李是否認識報銷開支的人士，李則表示不知道，並指：「只要攬炒巴嗰邊彈一個人嚟，話『呢個人係關事嘅，你 reimburse 佢啦』，咁我就會 reimburse。」李又指：「Whatever 佢寫咩，佢話係咩就係咩」，有點似「攬炒巴」批核相關開支，而李就像一個司庫般償還款項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒除舉辦活動外-眾籌餘款用於顧問費&quot;&gt;李宇軒：除舉辦活動外 眾籌餘款用於顧問費&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方再次問李有關餘款的用途，李補充指除了用於舉辦英國相關的活動之外，還會用於支付顧問費、籌辦一些支持香港的遊行和支付網絡伺服器的費用等等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李所指的「遊行」是支持香港什麼，李僅回答：「民主。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就剛才提及的「顧問費」，李指涉及兩間顧問公司，其中一間為「89up」，以他所知是比較集中於媒體範疇的顧問公司，後來他們覺得「89up」在政治方面較弱，於是轉用另一間顧問公司「Whitehouse Consultancy」。李特別強調，這間「Whitehouse Consultancy」與美國的白宮無關，純粹因為老闆名叫 Chris Whitehouse。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指顧問公司安排攬炒巴會見英議員監察區議會選舉等&quot;&gt;李宇軒指顧問公司安排「攬炒巴」會見英議員、監察區議會選舉等&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方遂追問關於「Whitehouse Consultancy」的性質和活動。李指這間公司曾經安排過「攬炒巴喺英國嘅 members」去會見英國國會議員，後來在2019年11月香港區議會選舉期間，「佢哋有幫手去用佢哋嘅人脈搵咗一啲人去監選」。李續指，到後期直至2020年，這間公司一直與「香港監察」的羅傑斯（Benedict Rogers）合作，也有一次協助前港督彭定康（Chris Patten）處理一個聯署行動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方追問該次聯署行動的目的，李指當時是2020年5月，有消息傳出香港會訂立《國安法》，「嗰個聯署就係話表達 concern」，尤其在英國角度，他們會認為《國安法》與《中英聯合聲明》不一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方又問會見英國國會議員的目的是什麼。李指是有關當時對香港人權民主問題的關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒戶口紀錄顯示曾轉帳至兩間顧問公司&quot;&gt;李宇軒戶口紀錄顯示曾轉帳至兩間顧問公司&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示李的銀行戶口紀錄，可見他分別於2019年7月23日、8月15日和8月21日，向顧問公司「89up」支付1.3萬元港幣、9,663英鎊和12,375英鎊。李確認他使用眾籌的餘款來支付上述顧問費。他又舉例指，「攬炒巴」在英國與「89up」合作，「佢哋租咗一架大巴士，喺倫敦度周圍走。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「Whitehouse Consultancy」，李的銀行戶口紀錄顯示他分別在2019年11月29日、12月31日和2020年2月4日，向「The Whitehouse Consultancy Limited」轉帳9,500英鎊、14,750英鎊和15,492.85英鎊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milorad Dodik, president of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian Republika Srpska (a majority Serb region), met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on 21 February 2024. At the meeting, he complained about the US and the UK sanctions against him and his associates. Dodik also promised to prevent his country’s NATO membership and bragged about his “excellent relations with [Serbian President Aleksandar] Vučić and [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor] Orbán”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three top politicians – Orbán, Vučić and Dodik – have built a brotherhood in the triangle between Budapest, Belgrade and Banja Luka. They share similar worldviews, authoritarian tendencies and comparable political paths. Their positions are quite aligned: from Russia and China to hopes for Donald Trump’s return to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brotherhood, Dodik explained to Putin, made the relationship with the EU easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Hungary is the most vocal opponent to the imposition of EU individual sanctions against Dodik and any restrictive measures against Serbia. Orbán’s man in Brussels, Olivér Várhelyi, has been an EU commissioner since 2019. He has significant influence over the disbursement of EU funds. As if that was not enough, earlier this year Hungary took over the command of the EUFOR Althea mission, a 1,600-strong EU-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Orbán, this brotherhood shows that he is a leader capable of exporting his model of governance. There is, of course, also some economic interest involved. But for Vučić and Dodik, Orbán is their key ally and disrupter inside the two transatlantic alliances: the EU and NATO. Orbán is both their protector and promoter, someone who strengthens their position at home and gives their words and deeds a stamp of approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this year’s celebration of the Day of Republika Srpska.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 9 January 1992 a group of ethnic Serbs left the first democratically elected parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina and decided to proclaim the Republika Srpska – the Serb Republic. Their primary aim was to carve out a mono-ethnic territory where Serbs would be a dominant majority. Their longer-term aim was to then unite it with neighbouring Serbia. To achieve this, the country’s multi-ethnic fabric had to be destroyed. What followed was the most brutal conflict in Europe since the end of Second World War. It culminated with genocide in Srebrenica, leaving some 100,000 dead, 2.2 million displaced and tens of thousands raped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina has repeatedly declared the celebration of this day to be unconstitutional. The country’s highest court ruled that this discriminates against non-Serbs living in that region. While the Republika Srpska retains its name – the Serb Republic – according to its constitution, it is no longer only that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;For Vučić and Dodik, Orbán is both their protector and promoter, someone who strengthens their position at home and gives their words and deeds a stamp of approval&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key aims set in the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords signed by all warring sides was to restore the multi-ethnic character of the country. This required a large-scale return of displaced people and their property, persecution of war criminals, as well as making sure that constitutional and legal provisions provide equal rights for all ethnic groups and others throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With significant international military, financial and diplomatic efforts, much has been achieved since. Almost 20% of the population in the Republika Srpska are non-Serbs. Four out of six most important positions in the region’s executive, legislature and judiciary must be occupied by non-Serbs, as well as half of all regional ministries. Also, changing the region’s constitution is impossible without the support of non-Serbs siting in the upper chamber of the regional parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Milorad Dodik’s first term as Republika Srpska’s prime minister in 1998, he has been an arch-pragmatist, always adapting his rhetoric and actions to the circumstances. He supported the return of displaced persons and the reconstruction of mosques when this looked inevitable. He supported comprehensive constitutional reforms when the US pushed them in 2006. He was also once in favour of the country’s NATO membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whenever it looked more politically promising to embrace nationalist causes – denying the Srebrenica Genocide, challenging state institutions – he has done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, Dodik has continually defied the Constitutional Court’s decision on the 9 January celebration. In 2016 he organised an illegal referendum, asking citizens to support his rejection of the court’s ruling. It took a coordinated diplomatic effort by the EU and NATO allies to convince neighbouring Serbia’s leadership to publicly state that it “did not support the referendum”. It was part of the West’s firm position to stand behind the Constitutional Court and its decisions, no matter how trivial or bizarre the issue might have seemed to some outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 January has since turned into a parade of nationalistic celebrations and secessionist rhetoric, fully supported by Russia. In 2018, Anatoly Bibilov, then the Russian-backed president of the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia, attended the 9 January celebration. He signed a cooperation agreement with Milorad Dodik and was quoted saying that “our two republics are like twins with identical strategic partnership with Russia”. Since 2019, members of the Night Wolves, the biggest Russian motorcycle club and a far-right group supporting the Kremlin, have become a regular feature of parades. In 2023, Putin was awarded the highest order of Republika Srpska and flags of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Republic were paraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2024, as in all years before, at the centre of this day was Milorad Dodik. Standing next to him was the Russian ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina. But what was different is the regional and wider European context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serbia sent a large delegation led by the defence minister and leader of Vučić’s Serb Progressive Party. He was accompanied by the Chief of General Staff and several ministers. In his congratulatory letter, Vučić, who was not present in Banja Luka, wrote the usual and important assurance that he recognised Bosnia and Herzegovina within its current borders. But he then warned gloomily that Serbia and Republika Srpska would soon jointly face difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Serb leaders bet on US disengagement and on a divided and hapless EU and NATO – and they see that from Ukraine to Nagorno-Karabakh it is military force, not diplomacy, that changes reality&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Vučić’s ministers present in Banja Luka was awarded with a long and warm applause after saying that “Republika Srpska needs to exist as a state”. Aleksandar Vulin, a recently replaced director of Serbian intelligence agency, and Vučić’s former defence and interior minister, made it clear that several years ago the integrity of Republika Srpska was made the number one priority in Serbia’s military doctrine. Vulin also said that “this generation of Serb politicians should work on making sure that no border exists” between majority-Serb territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was also different this year is that Orbán was awarded the same order of Republika Srpska that Putin received year before. Orbán gratefully accepted it and is expected to receive it in person later this month in Banja Luka. As the head of an EU and NATO government, Orbán’s embrace of Dodik’s narrative and anti-constitutional behaviour provides Dodik with additional credibility and political capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a dangerous development because Dodik and his closest associates can only convince the institutions in Republika Srpska of possible secession if he has clearly visible support from outside. That is why the EU and NATO must now show Budapest and Belgrade the red lines. Hungary is even more important in this arrangement because it can use its veto to protect both Republika Srpska and Serbia from Western sanctions and interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his recent interviews, Dodik spoke at length about the need for Serbs to use the potential return of Trump in the White House to push towards unification of Serbia and Serb-majority territories, from north Kosovo to Republika Srpska. According to him, the Americans “are wounded beast. They have left Afghanistan, they were crushed in Syria. They rallied the West against Russia in Ukraine and they are being crushed there as well. We must understand that this is the key moment”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Serbian leaders in Belgrade are rearming. Since Vučić came to power in 2012, Serbia’s military budget has almost tripled, from €500 million in 2013 to €1.4 billion in 2023. This makes it larger than that of all other five Western Balkan countries combined. In 2023 alone, Serbia spent €600 million on new weapons and equipment, and its military industry’s exports were worth over €1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Serb leaders bet on US disengagement and on a divided and hapless EU and NATO. And they see that from Ukraine to Nagorno-Karabakh it is military force, not diplomacy, that changes reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24 September 2023 in north Kosovo, Serb paramilitaries have returned – using force. They were praised as heroes in Serbia and Republika Srpska, with vocal support from Russia. In the days that followed, the US government warned that it had detected “an unprecedented staging of advanced Serbian artillery, tanks, and mechanized infantry units, along the border with Kosovo”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the Serb Armed Forces have partially retreated. But as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on 26 January 2024: the situation “remains unstable”. This is an ever more dangerous spiral of escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

These include inefficient agricultural practices, supply chain bottlenecks, changing consumption habits, international trade dynamics, domestic environmental degradation, corruption and data misrepresentation, and a history of food safety scandals. Diagnosing a more contentious international environment, Xi Jinping has placed greater emphasis on agricultural self-sufficiency and diversified sourcing of critical inputs, foodstuffs, technology and know-how. This brief explores key trends, challenges, and policy measures in China’s pursuit of food security. It is part of a joint CSIS-Brookings Institution project, Advancing Collaboration in an Era of Strategic Competition, which seeks to explore and expand the space for U.S.-China collaboration on matters of shared concern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2013, Chinese president Xi Jinping gave a speech at the Central Rural Work Conference of the Communist Party of China stating that China “cannot allow the recent, steady gains we have achieved in grain production to lull us into a false sense of security. We should not forget about the suffering caused by previous famines just because we have managed to recover. Rather, we should recognize that the issue of food security is a red line that would trigger terrible consequences were it ever to be compromised . . . we must adhere to the national food security strategy that puts [China] first.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any nation’s food security is essential to the prosperity and health of its people. And China must feed nearly 20 percent of the global population, despite being home to less than 10 percent of the world’s arable land and 6 percent of the world’s water resources. This translates into just 0.08 hectares per capita of arable land for the people of China, far lower than the 0.48 hectares of arable land per capita in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, famines and food crises in China have sometimes catalyzed political upheavals and regime collapse, underscoring for Beijing the national stability ramifications of securing a steady supply of food. Indeed, China’s State Council has cast food security as a “ballast stone” of the country’s overall national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s leaders are seeking to sustain and improve the country’s food security amid myriad challenges, including inefficient agricultural practices, supply chain logistics bottlenecks, international trade dynamics, changing consumption habits, water scarcity, and domestic environmental degradation. This research paper details China’s pursuit of food security — highlighting key trends, challenges, and policy measures, along with their impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-significance-of-food-security-in-china&quot;&gt;The Significance of Food Security in China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For millennia in China, food security has been inextricably tied with social stability. Food scarcity and famine have often played a central role in triggering violent upheaval. The last Chinese imperial government — the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) — saw major famines between 1810 to 1907 that resulted in the deaths of tens of millions. These periods of starvation were often followed by or served as catalysts for major rebellions and deadly conflicts that weakened imperial control and worsened socioeconomic conditions in the empire — all of which contributed to the dynasty’s collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, the country’s Communist-led government faced several immediate challenges to ensure a steady and sufficient food supply. In the aftermath of decades of foreign invasion and civil war, China’s citizens were among the poorest in the world. The country’s agricultural labor force was barely recovering from years of mass conscription and movements from the countryside to escape the war. Furthermore, the populace of around 550 million people was rapidly growing. Under Chairman Mao Zedong, the PRC carried out land reforms in the countryside, eliminated private landownership, and established agricultural collectives along similar lines to the Soviet Union’s state-controlled collectivized approach. China saw initial success in increasing agricultural output by nearly 4 percent annually from 1952 to 1958. Increased irrigation throughout the country also improved yields from the collectivized farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, many of the gains made would soon be reversed under Mao’s attempt to achieve rapid industrialization through the policies of the Great Leap Forward (1958–1962). Under this initiative, farmers were assigned to make steel in backyard furnaces instead of cultivating crops — which, given their inexperience, often resulted in inefficient production that generated commercially unusable pig iron. Local officials inflated crop production numbers to obscure the adverse effects of Mao’s policies, creating an illusion of superabundance. Cadres had farmers following badly planned directives, such as the abandonment of traditional Chinese agricultural techniques in favor of disastrous pseudo-scientific ideas influenced by Soviet agronomist Trofim Lysenko.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agricultural sector was further strained by a series of natural disasters, including the 1958 flooding of large parts of northern China and droughts in 1960–1961. These failures contributed to the food security crisis known as the “Three Years of Great Famine,” which caused upwards of 30 to 40 million deaths throughout China — the largest famine in modern history. In the aftermath, Mao would briefly step down, and the Communist Party returned to a more science-based set of agricultural practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese scientists played a key role in alleviating starvation and contributing to the global Green Revolution. Renowned agronomist Yuan Longping rejected the theories of Lysenko and discovered a type of hybrid rice in the 1960s that could increase crop yields by over 20 percent. By the late 1990s, this hybrid rice would go on to feed an additional 100 million Chinese citizens. In 2017, Yuan’s hybrid rice would make up over 60 percent of the country’s rice production and would be grown in over 60 countries worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ascension of Chairman Deng Xiaoping in 1978 led to gradual market-oriented economic reforms. In the countryside, this meant phasing out collective farms in favor of household ownership. Households were allowed to sell crops that were grown beyond government quotas, thus incentivizing increased yields. Agricultural outputs rose from 2.7 percent per year in 1978 to 7.1 percent annually during the five years following the reforms. This contributed to a significant reduction in undernourishment, defined by the World Bank as habitual food consumption insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels required to maintain a normal active and healthy life. As late as 2001, around 10 percent of China’s population faced undernourishment, a figure that declined to below 2.5 percent by around 2010 (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fAPKTqT.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Prevalence of Undernourishment in China&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2002 exposed the country’s agricultural producers to global markets, leading to increasing exports and imports of foodstuffs. The availability of imports enabled a meaningful shift in Chinese consumer preferences. In addition, attention to food safety grew in the aftermath of a series of food and agricultural contamination scandals in the early 2000s. Under President Hu Jintao, the PRC would codify new laws standardizing food production and prosecute hazardous food distribution practices in 2009. Given their country’s history, China’s leaders today are acutely aware of the stakes of food security — as a failure to secure a stable food supply could kindle collective grievances and provoke challenges to their authority, potentially destabilizing the regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strategies-for-food-security-under-xi-jinping&quot;&gt;Strategies for Food Security under Xi Jinping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since coming to power, Xi Jinping’s government has made food security a national priority. Reflecting the importance Beijing places on the issue, in March 2023 a book of “Excerpts of Xi Jinping’s Discussions on National Food Security” was published by the Chinese Central Literature Publishing House. The book covered more than 80 speeches, reports, talks, letters, and instructions from Xi Jinping related to food security since 2012. A central theme of the book is Xi’s admonition that food security is a matter of economic and political importance. The book includes a warning published by the People’s Daily, the party’s mouthpiece, that “whether [the Chinese government] can give the common people a satisfactory account of food [security] is a major test of our ability to govern. If our party is in power in China, if we can’t even do a good job in food safety, and if we can’t do it well for a long time, some people will ask whether it is enough or not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An April 2019 white paper by the State Council names 16 recent major laws related to food security matters, from seed intellectual property (IP) rights to pesticide administration to grain circulation. In April 2020, the government also published “six guarantees” to inform prioritization of economic policy following Covid-19: employment, basic livelihood, market entities, operations of grassroots organizations and structure, stability of supply chains, and energy and food security. The Central Document No. 1 published in 2023 focused on rural revitalization, and five of the nine areas of focus directly related to food security — specifically grain production, agricultural infrastructure, technology and equipment support, high-quality development of rural industries, and expanding agricultural employment. These documents reflect the central leadership’s framing of food security as an important foundation for achieving economic development, social stability, and national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FbW1Pqs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Distribution of Involvement by Xi Jinping in Food Security Initiat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2012 to 2022, Xi Jinping engaged directly on food security topics 67 times, including through domestic province inspections and instructions to local governors on how to manage agricultural production. Xi’s frequent direct monitoring serves as a signal to the rest of the Chinese leadership apparatus of his personal attention to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Xi Jinping, China has undertaken a multipronged strategy to pursue self-sufficiency in food security, addressing the top challenges facing China today (see Figure 3), as detailed in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-top-food-security-challenges&quot;&gt;China’s Top Food Security Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ri23gl0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 3: China’s Responses to Food Security Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;diminishing-arable-land&quot;&gt;Diminishing Arable Land&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2013 and 2019, China reported a decline of over 5 percent of its arable land, largely attributed to destructive farming practices and local governments repurposing agricultural land for infrastructure and real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counteract this decrease, China has embarked on a few pivotal strategies, including the National High-Standard Farmland Construction Plan (2021–2030), a national blueprint for enhancing farmland quality. The blueprint sets goals for farmland creation and upgrading by 2025, 2030, and 2035. It specifies where funding is coming from (a combination of general public budget, bonds, land transfers, etc.), provides annual measures, and lists ways to encourage private entities to invest in the development of high-quality farmland. China has also sought to alleviate some of its demographic shifts by increasing the sustainability and productivity of China’s agricultural output in urban-adjacent locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Central Document No. 1 from 2019 sets out a “red line” for arable land: no less than 1.8 billion mu (120 million hectares) nationally. In pursuit of this goal, China has introduced farmland restoration measures, crop rotation practices, and fallow land systems. Additionally, Chinese authorities created a strategy for “reclaiming” farmland by reverting agricultural land that had been repurposed for industry, real estate, and infrastructure. As shown in Figure 4, from 1990 to 2021 China increased the amount of land being sown for crops by 17.45 percent. Furthermore, from 2021 to 2023, Chinese authorities reclaimed more than 170,000 hectares (420,000 acres) of farmland. Nonetheless, reclaiming farmland does not automatically reset its value. Often, the land has become unsuitable for growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/E0tYfen.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 4: Sown Area of Farm Crops in China (1990–2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also grapples with pronounced geographical disparities in water resources, and many critical grain-producing provinces are water-scarce. Traditional flood irrigation methods, used by most small farms, often result in significant wastage. Overreliance on groundwater extraction, a direct response to this disparity, has spawned significant environmental concerns. To tackle these issues, China is making substantial investments in water-saving technologies, enhancing agricultural irrigation systems, and allocating significant funds — totaling trillions of RMB — to mega projects like the South-North Water Diversion project. The results have been mixed, with some projects showing improved crop production, an increase in farmers’ incomes, and substantial reduction in water usage, while others have created significant inter-provincial conflict over resources and financing. Additionally, long-term environmental impacts of these projects are subject to debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;governance-challenges&quot;&gt;Governance Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s pursuit of food security has been stymied by corruption and data misrepresentation. For example, in 2022, the former top official at the National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration (responsible for centralized control over stockpiled grain), Zhang Wufeng, was felled for corruption. Another inherent problem has been the misrepresentation of data by regional and local officials — a consequence of the prevalent incentive structure in the Chinese bureaucratic system, which promotes cadres who report good news and penalizes those who relay unfavorable news. In response, the central government has clarified that it oversees national food security policies, while provincial and local governments bear primary responsibility for making sure every Chinese citizen has enough food to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s legacy of decentralizing farmland, stemming from the household responsibility system (HRS) that originated post-collectivization, also poses challenges. The government’s restrictions on corporate entities acquiring farmland have resulted in a significant dispersion of agricultural resources among individual farmers. This fragmentation hinders technological advancement, marketing, standardization, and coordination within the sector. It also has incentivized farmers to produce cash crops like fruits and vegetables, given their higher returns compared to staple grains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;changing-consumer-demands&quot;&gt;Changing Consumer Demands&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dietary preferences and demands of China’s populace — and especially the rapidly expanding urban middle class — have changed substantially over the past few decades. With increasing disposable income and exposure to global cultures, there is growing demand for safer, more varied, and higher-quality food options. The traditional Chinese diet is based on staple grain, high in vegetables, and low in animal products. But as incomes have risen, so too has consumption of refined grains, meats, oils, and sugars. Except for a dip at the beginning of Covid-19 that can be attributed to lack of supply, consumption of meat has more than tripled since 1990, as shown in Figure 5. In urban markets, consumers now seek out specialty items such as organic produce, dairy alternatives, and imported meats. As China’s growing middle class looks set to encompass over 50 percent of its population by 2025, the increasingly affluent population’s demand for meat products will steadily increase — corresponding to growing demand for soy and grain inputs to feed livestock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ed1aRjH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 5: Consumption of Meat Products in China (1991–2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 6, food imports have increased dramatically, making China the world’s top importer of foodstuffs. In 2022, China imported approximately 98.3 billion USD in agricultural products, a record high. Even amid geopolitical tensions, China has continued to increase the amount of food it purchases from the United States, specifically non-staple foods like beef and nuts, along with products used for feeding livestock like corn and sorghum grain (see Figure 7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Yd7yi01.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 6: Food Imports to China by Country (2011–2021)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 7: Percent Change in Top 10 U.S. Agricultural Exports to China (2017–2022)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, China has poured resources into research, development, and imports of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and alternative foods. Precision gene-edited crops have been at the forefront of boosting crop yields in the United States for decades. However, despite being the first country to commercialize a transgenic crop in 1992, China has been slow to adopt overarching global GMO technologies. To support local companies in developing GMO IP, Chinese leaders have been reluctant in accepting foreign GMO seed producing companies in the Chinese market. Consumers were also initially hesitant, but public perceptions of genetically modified foods have become more positive in recent years. Recently, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (China’s national agricultural scientific research organization) laid out a five-year development plan calling for “construction of new key laboratories, a grain crop science center, a molecular design breeding center, a national crop germplasm resource bank, a livestock and poultry bank, and an agricultural microorganism bank.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand for imported foods also stems from long-standing concerns about domestic food safety. Imported goods are perceived as meeting higher safety and quality standards, making them particularly appealing to a population increasingly concerned with health and wellness. Over the years, the country has faced numerous high-visibility food safety scandals involving adulterated or toxic domestic products, leading to widespread perception that imports are safer than domestic products. One particularly impactful incident in 2008 involved the adulteration of baby formula with melamine, which led to the deaths of six infants and sickened nearly 300,000 others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, China has improved oversight and regulation of its food industry. The country’s first comprehensive food safety law was enacted in 2009 and has since been amended multiple times. The law encompasses a wide range of regulations aimed at ensuring food quality and consumer safety. It established a licensing system for food production and food operation, along with a safety review system for new foods entering the market. The law also addresses the logistics of food storage and distribution and sets national standards for various aspects of food products — including additives, hygiene, labeling, examination, and packaging — to bring China’s food industry up to international standards. Additionally, the law outlines specific food safety responsibilities for businesses, ranging from manufacturers to retailers, thereby aiming to make the entire food supply chain accountable for adhering to safety norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workforce-dynamics&quot;&gt;Workforce Dynamics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allure of urban life, combined with the promise of better wages, has seen many Chinese individuals leaving the agricultural sector for city-based jobs. Migrant jobs in urban centers offer better pay and seemingly improved prospects for future generations. Sectors such as transportation and logistics that have huge impacts on the agricultural sector also face workforce challenges. By the end of 2021, China faced a shortfall of 4 million truck drivers, an issue that will continue to be exacerbated as the working-age population in the country begins to shrink and people look toward more white-collar jobs. As birth rates decline and the population ages, fewer young people are available to replace the aging workforce, further compounding labor shortages in sectors like agriculture, transportation, and logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government has taken steps to make farming more lucrative and economically viable, beginning in the early 2000s with the abolition of the 2,600-year-old agricultural tax (similar to modern property taxes). Since then, central authorities have continued to reduce or remove taxes on agriculture, aiming to alleviate financial pressures on farmers. In 2006, the government also introduced a support price for wheat: when market prices dip below the annually set minimum price, the government commits to purchasing wheat from farmers at the support price, guaranteeing a level of income for farmers and incentivizing continued cultivation of this specific staple crop. The success of the strategy to support wheat is demonstrated in China’s grain output, which increased between the early 2000s and 2020 (see Figure 8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c8fjSI3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 8: China’s Grain Output (1980–2020)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the government introduced initiatives to bolster farmers’ incomes directly. In April 2023, the Chinese government allocated 10 billion yuan (approximately 1.38 billion USD), in one-time financial subsidies for farmers. However, despite these efforts, attracting younger generations to the farming profession remains a challenge. As recently as 2019, studies have shown that aging populations in rural areas continue to place a drag on agricultural productivity and negatively affect agricultural wages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;technological-and-productivity-issues&quot;&gt;Technological and Productivity Issues&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s agricultural landscape is uniquely characterized by the prevalence of small family farms dispersed throughout the country, rather than the large factory-farming models in many developed countries. While this model is a cornerstone of the Chinese economy, providing employment to millions, the fragmented nature of farms complicates the dissemination of new agricultural technologies and makes coordination among farmers, standardization of practices, and effective marketing difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bridge this divide, China launched the National Agricultural Technology and Education Cloud Platform in 2015. This digital platform promotes knowledge sharing and independent learning among agricultural workers. Farmers provide data on crops, pests, and on-the-ground conditions, and in return they can access online training courses, diagnostic AI, and helplines. Start-ups for strategic AI technologies can tell farmers which insects they are looking at with just a picture and which pesticides they should use to protect their crops. The central government also dispatches specialized expert teams to provinces affected by natural disasters or falling behind in agricultural output to deliver on-the-ground support and promote the popularization of advanced agricultural technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early twenty-first century, initiatives like expanding irrigation systems propelled China’s agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) growth — from under 1 percent in the 1970s to an average of 2.48 percent from 2001 to 2010. However, this expansion has fallen in the years since, as China has been unable to maintain a steady rate of agricultural TFP growth through continued policy improvements and investments in agricultural research and development (R&amp;amp;D). China still outperforms every other region except South Asia and the so-called transition countries (former Soviet Union) for agricultural TFP growth, but it will have to work increasingly hard to maintain this advantage. China’s public sector expenditures on agricultural R&amp;amp;D were approximately 6.6 billion USD in 2021, larger than those of India, the United States, and Brazil combined. However, in the United States, the private sector accounts for an additional 15 to 20 billion USD, while in China this number is functionally zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the productivity conundrum, China has embraced R&amp;amp;D solutions. Substantial financial inflows have been directed toward hybrid seed technologies, particularly in the domain of hybrid rice, corn, soybeans, and wheat. China also established “core areas” for production of certain products (e.g., potatoes in Southeast China, double-cropping rice in the Yangtze River Economic Belt). In 2021, amendments to China’s Seed Law strengthened the protection of legal rights and interests of owners of new plant varieties, encouraging R&amp;amp;D of seeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;climate-change&quot;&gt;Climate Change&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s agricultural sector is heavily exposed to climate change. Between 1981 and 2010, shifting climate patterns and ozone pollution collectively slashed China’s crop yields by 10 percent, an annual loss of 55 million tons of crops. As temperatures rise, extreme weather events, melting glaciers, environmental degradation, and water scarcity and contamination will intensify the implications for China’s agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s focus has been on building resilience and adaptation mechanisms to confront these challenges and shoring up the system’s response to natural disasters. Throughout the 2010s, China made significant investments in mega projects to ameliorate the effects of climate change. More recently, there has been a palpable shift toward promoting the green development of agriculture and encouraging farmers to switch to higher-yield and stress-resistant crops. China is also looking to the oceans to bolster food security, as evidenced in a series of recent initiatives aimed at promoting and streamlining marine aquaculture. In November 2017, the Ministry of Agriculture unveiled the National Mariculture Development Plan (2017–2025). As per this blueprint, China aspires to establish 200 national-level demonstration marine ranches by 2025. In April 2023, President Xi coined the term “blue granary” to describe marine fisheries and mariculture, specifically deep-sea fishing and ranching. Shortly thereafter, Chinese authorities released guidelines on deep-water aquaculture as a key piece of fortifying the agricultural supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;food-waste&quot;&gt;Food Waste&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2014 and 2018, an estimated 27 percent of all food in China was lost or wasted, comparable to global averages. Food waste and loss can occur at any point in the supply chain, from death of livestock to crops damaged by improper storage to expired products thrown out in households. China has made a concerted effort to address food waste through a series of “campaign-style” reforms. In August 2020, President Xi Jinping launched the “Clean Your Plate Campaign 2.0,” modeled on an earlier homonymous anti-corruption initiative. Following the “Clean Your Plate Campaign 2.0,” China introduced the Anti-Food Waste Law in April 2021. This State Council–spearheaded initiative included educational campaigns, regulatory measures against businesses, the introduction of systems for enhanced procurement, storage, and handling practices, and methods for increasing efficiency in food production, with relevant incentives and penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;geopolitical-dynamics&quot;&gt;Geopolitical Dynamics&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following geopolitical shocks including the 2017 trade war with the United States, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, China has sought to reduce its exposure to external dependencies. This strategy includes ramping up international land acquisition, increasing bilateral and multilateral trade deals, diversifying international supply chains, expanding overseas agricultural activities through projects like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and encouraging domestic companies to take their operations global.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Chinese acquisition of farmland in the United States has garnered attention in Washington, most of its international land purchases are in Asia and Africa. According to Land Matrix, a European land monitoring organization, between 2011 and 2020 Chinese companies purchased or leased 6.48 million hectares of land for agriculture, forestry, or mining — equivalent to the size of Latvia. Chinese companies purchase arable land in other countries and sell their products back to consumers in China through individual deals as well as through BRI projects and other similar initiatives; China has signed over 100 agricultural cooperation agreements with BRI countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, China has sought to grow its global influence in food security and governance. China has held the director-generalship of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) since August 2019 and has a position on the World Food Programme (WFP) executive board. China also hosts the WFP Centre of Excellence in China, which takes advantage of China’s experience in reducing poverty and hunger to facilitate activities relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals through training, policy dialogue, and capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2019, the State Council Information Office published a white paper titled “Food Security in China” to “provide a full picture of how food security operates in China, in order to increase the international community’s understanding in this important field.” It frames China’s role in global food security as opening its market further, upholding WTO obligations, sharing food security expertise and resources, promoting top domestic food businesses to expand internationally, forging food and agriculture cooperation agreements on bilateral and multilateral levels, collaborating on research with nations and global entities, offering emergency food aid as per its capabilities, and actively engaging in global food security governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has brought into focus the fragility of international food supply chains. The war in Ukraine generated a global spike in food prices, which impacted China disproportionately, given its position as the world’s top importer of foodstuffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar challenge arose from China’s draconian Covid-19 regulations. As China scrambled to enforce lockdowns in a bid to curb the virus’s spread, transportation bottlenecks, labor shortages, and logistical challenges threatened the steady flow of essential commodities — including food — both domestically and internationally. While headlines of people locked in their houses in Shanghai made the news, lack of food during lockdowns appears to have been prevalent throughout rural China as well. A study of 2,631 rural households showed that an increase of 100 confirmed Covid-19 cases in a county corresponded with a statistically significant decrease in per capita intake of dietary energy, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, an effect that was especially pronounced in low-income groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To buffer against such shocks, China has traditionally maintained vast food reserves. Estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture projected that in 2022, China possessed 69 percent of global corn reserves, 60 percent of rice, 51 percent of wheat, and 37 percent of soybeans. In recent years, China has increased its investment in stockpiling. The Chinese National Bureau of Statistics reported that 2022 pork production was at its highest level since 2014 and that China bought a record number of soybeans in 2023, both attributed to replenishment of reserves depleted during the pandemic. China also inked an agreement with Russia in September 2023 establishing a new 159 million USD grain hub strategically located on both sides of the border between the Russian Jewish Autonomous Oblast and China’s Heilongjiang Province. Accompanying this deal were agreements to enhance storage and transportation capabilities. A 26 billion USD deal was also inked between Beijing and Moscow in October 2023 to export 70 million tons of grain over the next 12 years. Beijing and Moscow also sought to accelerate the construction of the New Russia–China Land Grain Corridor — a Sino-Russian initiative established in 2012 that would build out infrastructure to allow for the export of more grain by Russia and other Eurasian countries to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-future-food-security-path-and-implications&quot;&gt;China’s Future Food Security Path and Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many challenges will likely influence the PRC’s food security approach in the coming years and decades. On the policymaking front, China’s Food Security Law was recently submitted for deliberation at the third session of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People’s Congress on June 26, 2023. Although the draft is not yet public, writer Gong Yixi from the People’s Congress Multimedia Office has stated that the purpose of the law is to “guarantee effective food supply, ensure national food security, and enhance the ability to prevent and defend against food security risks.” He also states that the law will include provisions on protecting farmland, food production, food reserves, food circulation, food processing, food emergencies, food conservation, supervision, and management. Earlier food security publications from the central government focused on domestic facets of food security, such as farmland reclamation and increasing employment in the agricultural sector. The forthcoming law, by comparison, seems to take a more national security–focused lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As outlined in Figure 9, the newest iteration of the National People’s Congress five-year legislation plan, which sets priority for legislation through 2028, names 10 laws directly related to food security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RsC7pG2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 9: Five-Year Legislative Plan of China’s National People’s Congress for 2023–2028 (Laws related to food security)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has made significant efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in feeding its population. Under Xi, it has channeled substantial resources into strategies for enhancing agricultural productivity, reducing waste, and diversifying sources of supply to avoid overreliance on single markets for food imports. However, the pursuit of absolute self-sufficiency in food security is an improbable, if not impossible, goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer scale of China’s population compared to its share of arable land will continue to pose a significant problem, compounded by environmental constraints. Even with advanced technologies, there are natural limits to how much food can be sustainably produced. Achieving self-sufficiency would likely mean reverting to a diet based primarily on staple foods that does not meet modern nutritional standards and food preferences. Moreover, the concept of self-sufficiency in the globalized era is increasingly outdated. The global food market is intricately connected, and any pursuit of autarkic food self-sufficiency would cause China to lose out on the benefits of a functioning global agricultural market which, while imperfect, does benefit from year-round output and market-based adjustments to address imbalances in supply and demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By necessity, if not by choice, China will have to continue to depend upon imports to meet the food demands of its population. To guard against risks of dependencies, China likely will continue seeking to diversify its sourcing of critical inputs, foodstuffs, technology, and know-how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study makes clear that Xi has set food security as a leader-level priority. He views such efforts as directly linked to China’s national security and to the legitimacy and survivability of the Chinese Communist Party. As the world’s leading importer of foodstuffs, the strategies that China has proposed and initiated will have significant spillover effects on the rest of the world. This makes China’s efforts to enhance its food security not just a matter of concern for China, but indeed an issue of importance across the world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;財務文件顯示眾志參與G20登報 李宇軒估計周庭有份聯絡《朝日新聞》&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/eF3UgIi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】壹傳媒創辦人黎智英及3間蘋果公司被控串謀勾結外國勢力及串謀刊印煽動刊物等罪，案件今（14日）於高院（移師西九龍法院）踏入第45日審訊。控方傳召「十二港人」之一李宇軒，以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。控方提問繼續圍繞2019年6月G20峰會前夕的登報計劃，以及相關財務紀錄。李確認他向台灣《蘋果日報》、《南德意志報》、《紐約時報》、《泰晤士報》和三份南韓報紙等，分別支付了登報廣告費用，款額逾385萬港元。其中《朝日新聞》和歐洲版 POLITICO 的發票均顯示上款為「Demosisto（香港眾志）」，李估計當時的眾志成員周庭有份聯絡《朝日新聞》，因為估計只有她懂得日文。而《紐約時報》的發票顯示上款除了李宇軒之外，還有「Anna Kwok」，李相信當時他與「Anna Kwok」一同聯絡報館，惟控方未有就「Anna Kwok」的身份提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;「十二港人」之一李宇軒第二天以「從犯證人」身份出庭作供。李昨日提及，在2019年6月G20峰會舉行之前，為了爭取國際關注香港的示威活動，遂發起眾籌及籌備在不同國家報紙登頭版廣告計劃。期間案中另一名被告陳梓華經 Telegram 接觸李，並以「T」的身份與李商討墊支廣告費，惟李當時並未知道「T」名叫陳梓華。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指陳梓華後來介紹mark-simon給他認識&quot;&gt;李宇軒指陳梓華後來介紹Mark Simon給他認識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示兩封由「T」轉發給李宇軒的電郵，可見電郵原初發送者為「Terrie Lam」。李指當時T把《華盛頓郵報》的廣告費收據，由「Terrie Lam」的電郵轉發給他。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指其中一個電郵提及一個名叫「Mark」的人。李表示當他收到這封電郵時，並不知道 Mark 是誰，但「其後我知道呢個係 Mark Simon」，因為在不遲於2019年9月的時候， T 把 Mark Simon 介紹給他認識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒相信以自己信用卡支付日本時報廣告費&quot;&gt;李宇軒相信以自己信用卡支付《日本時報》廣告費&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提及刊登於《日本時報》的G20廣告，李指《日本時報》是當年G20峰會會場內會派發的報紙，並確認上述廣告是其中一份在日本報紙刊登的廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示由《日本時報》發出的發票，以及收據，並指這是從李的住所檢取的，顯示某人在2019年6月28日以信用卡支付了200萬日圓廣告費。李表示，若果他沒有記錯的話，應該是使用了他的信用卡付款，不過需要翻查信用卡紀錄確認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方後來向李出示他的信用卡交易紀錄，惟未見任何有關《日本時報》的交易。李遂對於是否由他的信用卡支付廣告費表示不肯定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒指陳梓華起初聲稱會處理台蘋廣告費-惟後來要求他自行處理&quot;&gt;李宇軒指陳梓華起初聲稱會處理台蘋廣告費 惟後來要求他自行處理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方提到於2019年6月28日刊於台灣《蘋果日報》的廣告，寫有「港台同行 唇亡齒寒」。發票顯示李須於2019年7月5日或之前繳付120萬元新台幣廣告費。另一份匯款申請表顯示，李宇軒在7月15日申請以台幣匯率匯款307,692.31元港幣。李的銀行戶口紀錄顯示，廣告費最後在7月16日付清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李確認發票上的付款期限是7月5日，但因為當時 T 告訴他：「佢同埋佢嗰邊會 handle 嘅，即係有關俾錢嗰樣嘢，佢都會搞掂」，所以李一開始收到發票後並未有理會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;直至廣告刊出之後，「咁後來冇人去追我數」，當時他亦不知道自己收到的文件是要求他付款的發票，「咁我覺得 T 嗰邊已經搞掂咗條數喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;可是大約7月的時候，「T 就話，你都係找返台灣《蘋果》呢條數啦。」李續指，既然 T 叫他付款，「咁我就嗱嗱臨找咗條數囉」，因此他在7月15日遞交匯款申請表，最終於7月16日付清廣告費。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;紐約時報發票顯示anna-kwok參與落廣告&quot;&gt;《紐約時報》發票顯示「Anna Kwok」參與落廣告&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示在2019年6月27日刊登於《南德意志報》（Süddeutsche Zeitung）的G20廣告。李表示記得在登報計劃中，只在一份德國報紙登廣告，所以確認是《南德意志報》。李確認他就此廣告支付了85,300歐元，即大約67萬港元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方另展示兩份刊登於《紐約時報》的G20廣告，日期均是2019年6月28日。就第一份廣告，李的銀行戶口紀錄顯示，他於6月26日向《紐約時報》支付了83,752美元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰留意到，《紐約時報》發票抬頭除了寫有李宇軒的英文名字 Li Yu Hin 之外，還有另一個名字 Anna Kwok，並澄清向報館落單的人是否李。李回答，他相信他本人和 Anna Kwok 一同負責向《紐約時報》落廣告，至於為何發票上出現兩個名字，李表示不知道。控方庭上未有就 Anna Kwok 的身份提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李官表示，純粹好奇一問，李在聯絡報館期間使用了真實姓名，是否代表 Telegram 群組成員知道他的真實姓名。李回答不是，因為他只曾向報館提供真實姓名，所以報館可能知道他的真名，如果相關文件透過電郵被轉發或副本抄送至其他有份聯絡報館的人時，該些人便會知道他的真名。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一份在《紐約時報》刊登的G20廣告，李確認支付了36,000美元。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;朝日新聞發票顯示客戶為香港眾志-李宇軒估計周庭有份聯絡報館&quot;&gt;《朝日新聞》發票顯示客戶為香港眾志 李宇軒估計周庭有份聯絡報館&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示於2019年6月28日刊登於《朝日新聞》的廣告，並向李出示相關發票，客戶名稱寫有「Demosisto」，要求支付700萬日圓。控方問這個客戶是誰、為何會出現在發票上。李指它是「眾志」，「因為眾志入面有人去負責搵 Asahi Shimbun（《朝日新聞》）」，但是他不知道該人是否 Telegram 群組的成員之一。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問李所指的「眾志」是否一個政治團體，李僅回答：「以我理解，淨係得一個眾志。」控方追問是哪一位眾志成員負責聯絡《朝日新聞》，李表示：「我唔直接知道，但我 speculation（估計）係周庭。」他補充：「因為，我 speculation 係，得佢一個識講日文。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李的銀行個人戶口紀錄顯示，在同年6月27日有一筆700萬日圓的支帳紀錄，李確認這是有關登報的廣告費。控方問李當時如何收到上述發票，李則稱不記得，因為在籌備登報計劃期間，有些人負責聯絡不同報館，包括《朝日新聞》，他相信一些負責聯絡報館的人，「喺畀錢嘅時候彈咗張單俾我」，即是上述抬頭為「Demosisto」的發票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李宇軒確認由他支付南韓英國西班牙等報廣告費&quot;&gt;李宇軒確認由他支付南韓、英國、西班牙等報廣告費&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就南韓報紙，李宇軒指當時一共在三份南韓報紙登廣告，分別是《韓國日報》（한국 일보）、《朝鮮日報》（조선일보）和《東亞日報》（동아일보），並確認上述三份報紙廣告費合共是8,325萬韓圜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就《泰晤士報》（The UK Times）刊登的廣告，李的信用卡交易紀錄顯示他支付了27,195英鎊，即大約275,763.90港元。李確認相關紀錄。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就西班牙報紙《世界報》（El Mundo），李確認他支付了2萬歐羅。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就加拿大報紙《環球郵報》（The Globe and Mail），李確認發票上要求他繳付的金額是84,750元加幣，不過實際上廣告費只是75,000元加幣，他當時告訴報館職員自己不是身處加拿大，問對方可否免除增值稅（value added tax），對方表示不用支付增值稅，所以李最終只繳付了75,000元加幣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後展示由歐洲版 POLITICO 發出的發票，抬頭是「Demosisto」，需就2019年6月27至29日期間刊登網上廣告繳付5,000歐羅。李確認他向 POLITICO 支付了5,000歐羅，並確認 POLITICO 的公司總部位於比利時，但是該G20廣告是網上的廣告。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明日續審。&lt;/p&gt;
