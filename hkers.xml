Yet other signs, such as Prigozhin shaking hands with officials from the Central African Republic (CAR) in Saint Petersburg while the 2023 Russia-Africa summit was unfolding, or Russian flags being flown during the Niger coup this July, suggest that Russia’s influence in Africa is here to stay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current volatile situation calls for a coolheaded look at the fundamentals of Russia’s existing footprint and its forays across the continent, to better assess how they might evolve and how to address them. Russia’s breakthroughs in Africa are owed in part to a rekindling of Soviet-era relations. Yet the Kremlin’s remarkable advances on the continent throughout the last decade also result from twin contemporary efforts: adept diplomatic reengagement with key regional players and opportunistic predation in areas where Western powers are either absent or in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the U.S.-led effort to form a global coalition aimed at isolating Russia internationally has indeed strengthened the transatlantic alliance, it has not yet fully convinced the rest of the world, including countries on the African continent, to break ties with Moscow. In fact, many across Africa regard the war in Ukraine as primarily a Western problem and are preoccupied with protecting their own national interests. Even with the war and sanctions straining Russia’s economy and defense sector, the Kremlin retains sufficient ties with the continent to challenge Western narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper examines Russia’s creeping influence over Africa, assessing Moscow’s historic legacy as well as the current diplomatic, economic, and military-security links that contribute to the region’s continued willingness to engage with Russia. In doing so, particular attention is paid to the Russian private military company (PMC) Wagner Group, which has been playing an important role in forging ties between the Kremlin and different African nations, despite the uncertainty following Prigozhin’s rebellion in June 2023. It then offers analysis and recommendations to Western policymakers, outlining new approaches the transatlantic community should adopt to counter a rising Russia in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-kremlins-playbook-in-africa-from-diplomatic-to-military-footprint&quot;&gt;The Kremlin’s Playbook in Africa: From Diplomatic to Military Footprint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is commonly argued that the hesitancy of many African states to openly condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is rooted in the deep Soviet-era ties Moscow forged with the continent, which continue to generate a lot of sympathy and respect toward Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from the mid-1950s, as Africa turned into another important Cold War battleground, the Soviet Union became actively involved in reshaping the continent’s political and security landscape by granting generous economic and security assistance programs to many different local Marxist, anti-colonial, or anti-U.S. groups. By supporting independence movements during a period of colonial conflict and aiding governments that faced internal or external confrontation, the Soviet Union managed to penetrate all the major countries across Africa, including but not limited to Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and Mozambique. The Kremlin supplied those states with weapons and equipment, provided military training and advisers, and developed relations between the Soviet and various African intelligence communities, ultimately creating “a long-term legacy of Soviet hardware and operational culture throughout Africa.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8G7xTQu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Leonid Brezhnev, general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, meets with the new Egyptian president, Anwar al-Sadat, in Moscow, the latter seeking political support and military hardware from the Soviet Union for use in Egypt’s imminent war with Israel, 1971.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the newly established Russian Federation—finding itself in political and socioeconomic turmoil—was forced to disengage from the continent, which meant that its generous economic and military assistance programs came to an abrupt halt. For around two decades after the Soviet collapse, Russian activity in Africa was marginal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-diplomatic-reengagement-with-africa&quot;&gt;Russia’s Diplomatic Reengagement with Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow’s first visible attempts to reengage with the continent started in the mid-2000s. In 2006, President Vladimir Putin visited the Republic of South Africa, followed by his successor Dmitry Medvedev’s trips to Egypt, Angola, Nigeria, and Namibia in 2009. The Kremlin doubled down on its diplomatic efforts following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, when the first round of Western sanctions against Russia forced Moscow to actively seek new geopolitical partners and business opportunities. Since 2014, various high-ranking Russian state officials—including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov—have frequented different African states and signed multiple bilateral military, economic, and security cooperation agreements, as well as written off billions of dollars in African debts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s return to Africa has also coincided with (and has been encouraged by) the reduced U.S. engagement with the continent, including the 2018 decision under the Trump administration to scale back U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the region despite the growing terror threat in many African nations. Moscow was quick to fill that security void. In 2019, President Putin hosted the first-ever Russia-Africa summit at the Black Sea retreat of Sochi, aimed at reinforcing Russia’s standing as a reliable strategic partner on the continent and securing military contract agreements with different nations, including the Nigerian government, which agreed to purchase Russian attack helicopters. In July 2023, despite the war, sanctions, and Western pressure, 17 heads of African states attended the second Russia-Africa summit, signing several agreements with Russia on prevention of arms race in space, cooperation in informational security, and combating terrorism on the continent. Moscow also promised to write off additional debts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wW9NlK4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ President Putin, African leaders, and heads of delegations pose for a group photo at the second Russia-Africa summit held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on July 28, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ongoing diplomatic efforts, encompassing high-level visits, debt relief, and strategic partnership agreements, have proved to be particularly useful at the United Nations. The Kremlin has been able to count on the backing of many African nations on key UN votes, including the 2014 General Assembly resolution condemning the Russian annexation of Crimea, the 2018 resolution urging Moscow to demilitarize the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, and the 2022 resolution decrying Russia’s attempted annexation of four Ukrainian regions. In all three cases, a considerable number of African countries voted against the proposed resolutions, abstained, or did not show up for the vote, thus directly or indirectly contributing to the Kremlin’s efforts at challenging the United States and its allies within international frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russo-african-economic-and-trade-relations&quot;&gt;Russo-African Economic and Trade Relations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to strengthening diplomatic ties with African states, the Kremlin has also expanded its economic footprint on the continent. For instance, trade revenue between Russia and African countries almost doubled from $9.9 billion in 2013 to $17.7 billion by 2021. Grain exports are of particular importance, as nearly 30 percent of Africa’s grain supplies come from Russia. Moscow’s leading trade partners in the region are countries in North Africa—particularly Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco—which together account for approximately 67 percent of Russia’s total trade with the continent. Moscow mainly exports wheat, coal, refined petroleum, and electronics to these states, while importing fruits, sugar, and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s recent withdrawal from the Black Sea grain deal—which enabled Ukraine to safely export grain to different parts of the world, including Africa—may benefit Moscow’s own grain exports by cutting Kyiv out of the global market and increasing the dependence of a number of African republics on Russian grain. Moscow has maintained that it will do “all it can” to shield Africa from the negative consequences of the halted grain deal, with President Putin asserting that “our country is capable of replacing Ukrainian grain on a commercial and a gratuitous basis.” During the 2023 Russia-Africa summit, Putin even promised to start shipping free grain in the next several months to six African nations significantly impacted by the cancellation of the grain deal: Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Mali, Somalia, Eritrea, and the CAR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of Russia’s economic outreach to Africa is that it is dominated by Russian companies that are either partially or fully owned by the state, including oil and gas giants Rosneft, Tatneft, and Gazprom, which carry out major hydrocarbon projects in North Africa. Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear power company, has also been actively engaged with different countries across the continent. For instance, in summer 2022, it received permission from an Egyptian regulator to start building Egypt’s first nuclear power plant, based on the 2017 agreement signed between President Putin and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The plant is expected to become fully operational by 2030. Rosatom also funds different educational and cultural exchange opportunities in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields to support the Kremlin’s soft power efforts in Africa. In addition to energy deals, Moscow has also boosted cooperation with different states rich in natural resources, primarily diamonds. For instance, Alrosa, Russia’s top diamond mining company, has expanded its operations in Angola, Congo, and Zimbabwe. Importantly, according to some African scholars, “Russia is highlighting collaboration over aid” when seeking lucrative business opportunities in Africa, thus stressing partnerships of equals, “and that message is tempting to some leaders who view the West’s outreach as patronizing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, despite Russia’s ongoing efforts to build stronger business and trade ties with the continent, the Kremlin’s economic engagements in Africa today are modest when compared to those of the Soviet Union, as well as those of the modern-day China, United States, and European Union. While trade revenue between Russia and African countries comprises around $17.7 billion, Africa’s trade value with the European Union, China, and the United States currently stands at $295 billion, $254 billion, and $65 billion, respectively. Russia also invests little in Africa, representing less than 1 percent of total foreign direct investment (FDI) going to the continent. Moscow’s main competitive advantage against the global powers seeking to expand their footprint on the continent is therefore its ability to render relatively cheap security and military services, including arms transfers, as well as anti-insurgency training and consultancy services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russo-african-defense-and-security-cooperation&quot;&gt;Russo-African Defense and Security Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Kremlin continues to be a small player in Africa when measured by its economic and trade relations, it retains strong defense and security ties with the continent, spanning arms sales, joint military training programs, and Russian PMC activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is the chief arms supplier to Africa, accounting for 40 percent of African imports of major weapons systems between 2018 and 2022. This has been higher than the total arms imports from the United States (16 percent), China (9.8 percent), and France (7.6 percent) during those years. According to a report by the RAND Corporation, Russian weapons sales to Africa have increased from around $500 million to over $2 billion annually in recent years. The key importers of Russian weapons systems are the North African countries Algeria and Egypt, with 73 percent and 34 percent of their arms imports, respectively, coming from Russia. Both states have purchased billions of dollars’ worth of weapons and equipment from Moscow since 2013, including the Su-24, Su-30, and MiG-29 combat aircraft, as well as the S-300 missile systems, among others. Besides Algeria and Egypt, many other countries across the continent also receive Russian matériel, including but not limited to Mali, Sudan, the CAR, and Angola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons explaining the dependency of African countries on Russian-made weapons and equipment. Modern Russian arms are usually cheaper than their Western alternatives and compatible with Soviet-era stocks retained by many states on the continent. Additionally, unlike the United States and its allies, the Kremlin does not make its arms deliveries contingent upon adherence to democratic principles or the protection of basic human rights; it has sent armor, combat aircraft, and missile systems to different war-torn countries in Africa—including Libya, where it has supported eastern Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar’s fight against the UN-recognized Government of National Accord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides arms transfers, Moscow has advanced military diplomacy in the region by engaging different African countries in Russian-led military forums and exercises, including the International Army Games, which since 2015 has been attended by around a dozen African states, such as Angola, Algeria, Congo, Mali, and Zimbabwe. The Kremlin has also organized the annual naval (“Friendship Bridge”) and aerial (“Defenders of Friendship”) exercises between the Russian and Egyptian armies and supported UN peace operations in Congo, Western Sahara, Sudan, and South Sudan by providing a limited number of military observers. Yet, while the official Russian military presence might seem modest, it is usually supplemented by Russian PMC activities, which have been rather extensive on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the exact numbers of Russian private military companies or operations in Africa are difficult to estimate, available reporting shows that there have been at least seven Russian PMCs that have carried out at a minimum 34 operations in 16 African countries since 2005. PMCs became particularly active in the mid-2010s following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its intervention in the Syrian war in 2015, both of which enabled Russia to advertise and offer its PMC services—from providing private security and military training to conducting combat operations—to different governments and separatist groups across Africa. According to RAND, Russian PMCs have a substantial presence in the CAR, Sudan, and South Sudan. They are also found in a number of other African states, including Congo, Gabon, Libya, Mali, and Madagascar. What makes the proliferation of Russian PMCs in Africa particularly noteworthy is that, in virtually all cases, they have strong ties with the Kremlin. As Major Thomas D. Arnold of the U.S. Army argues, “Russia effectively trades PMSC [private military and security company] services for access and economic concessions in resource-endowed fragile states.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most prominent among the Russian PMCs operating in Africa is the Wagner Group, owned by Prigozhin, an infamous Russian businessman dubbed “Putin’s Chef” whose notoriety increased immensely following his June 2023 short-lived armed mutiny against the Russian government, and particularly the Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD). However, prior to the June uprising, the Wagner chief was known as one of President Putin’s most loyal subordinates. For instance, in 2018, the United States indicted Prigozhin for financing a Russian troll factory that had spearheaded Moscow’s efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. As for having strong links to the Russian government, Wagner forces were allegedly trained along with the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation’s (GRU) special forces units. The PMC gained notoriety for its participation in the 2014 Ukrainian and 2015 Syrian conflicts. In Syria, due to Wagner’s assistance to the Assad regime, several Prigozhin-owned or closely linked companies struck exclusive oil and gas deals with the government, thus enabling the Kremlin to get its share of Syria’s energy revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner adopted and further developed a similar strategy in Africa, where it has advised tottering leaders, run pro-government and disinformation campaigns, conducted military training and anti-insurgency operations, and, in return, secured concessions in extractive industries, particularly gold, diamond, and uranium mining. For instance, in CAR, at various times since 2018 up to 1,900 “Russian instructors” (i.e., Wagner and its subsidiaries) have provided escort protection to the country’s senior officials, including President Touadéra, and have assisted the Russian MOD with arms deliveries and on-site military training. In return, the Kremlin has been able to explore “the possibilities of the mutually beneficial development of Central African natural resources,” with Prigozhin-linked companies spearheading gold and diamond mining efforts in the republic. In Sudan, Wagner has provided site security to Prigozhin-owned gold mining companies and has been actively involved in strengthening ties with General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), a deputy head of Sudan’s ruling council, to establish its first naval base in Port Sudan. Similarly, in Libya, the Kremlin reportedly sent up to 1,200 Wagner contractors to aid General Khalifa Haftar, a de facto ruler of eastern Libya in control of a significant share of the country’s oil reserves, in exchange for securing economic concessions that included Russian oil giant Rosneft’s access to the country’s lucrative oil market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LulnYGp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Demonstrators hold banners and a Russian flag in the capital city of Bangui, CAR, in March 2023. Taking advantage of the security vacuum created by the departure of French troops from the country, Moscow first sent “military instructors” to CAR in 2018, followed by hundreds of Wagner troops in 2020 at the request of President Touadéra to help him fend off a dangerous rebellion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia’s military presence in Africa, focused on the strengthening of both official and unofficial channels of defense-security cooperation with different African states, has proved to be a cost-effective way for the Kremlin to gain considerable political and economic leverage on the continent that even the 2022 war in Ukraine has been unable to undermine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russias-continued-progress-in-africa-despite-the-war-in-ukraine-and-domestic-fissure&quot;&gt;Russia’s Continued Progress in Africa, despite the War in Ukraine and Domestic Fissure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Russia’s military shortcomings in Ukraine—including incurring significant personnel and equipment losses, struggling to produce advanced weapons systems, and increasing reliance on Soviet-era defense equipment—there have not yet been any tangible signs of African countries actively seeking to replace Moscow as a chief arms supplier or military partner. In fact, throughout 2022, a number of countries on the continent initiated new or continued existing military cooperation agreements with the Kremlin. Cameroon, for instance, signed a new defense deal with the Russian MOD entailing joint military trainings, and Mali received military equipment from Moscow. In 2023, the Russia-Africa summit participants agreed to establish a new permanent Russo-African security mechanism, aimed at combating terrorism and extremism on the continent. However, some negative trends have also been observed. For example, Algeria and Egypt, which have long been listed among Russia’s top five arms purchasers globally, slowly started to lessen defense ties with the Kremlin in 2022. Yet, considering the large reliance of both countries on Russian-origin arms, they will most likely maintain defense cooperation with Moscow in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the Russian armed forces, Wagner has sustained significant losses in Ukraine. In May 2023, Prigozhin openly accused the Russian MOD for not supplying his PMC with enough ammunition during the fight for the city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. A month later, this disagreement led to the Prigozhin-orchestrated “march for justice” against Moscow, which, even if brief, has given rise to a number of questions connected with the stability of the Putin regime, as well as the future of Wagner in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HkpDe1i.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Wagner soldiers sit on the top of a tank in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, on June 24, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the uprising, experts believed that, even if Wagner were to be sidelined in Ukraine, the PMC would not “fade into obscurity.” Instead, it would pivot back to Africa, where it still retained a comparative advantage against the backdrop of a new wave of insurgencies spanning the continent, resuming limited-scale “expeditionary operations and supplying muscle to fragile states in exchange for access to valuable resources.” Indeed, in March 2023, Wagner was already actively recruiting new contractors willing to serve terms ranging from 9 to 14 months in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also argued that, by putting a private army to work in the region, Prigozhin was able to at least partially fund Wagner’s war effort in Ukraine. This, in most cases, was achieved by expanding the PMC-linked mining operations across the continent. For instance, in exchange for supporting regime stability in CAR, Wagner reportedly gained some degree of control over the country’s international airport, flying gold worth billions of U.S. dollars that it had been mining in CAR from the capital of Bangui straight to Moscow. According to some estimates, despite the allied sanctions imposed on Russia, Moscow’s gold reserves reached an all-time high in the first quarter of 2023. Similar to in CAR, Wagner continued to exploit the existing power struggle in Sudan, allegedly assisting the country’s General Hemedti through Wagner’s Libyan partner General Haftar, and thus attempting to preserve Russia’s ongoing gold mining operations in Sudan and advance the Kremlin’s interests of building a naval base along the Red Sea in Port Sudan. Experts believe that, if Moscow is ultimately successful at gaining port access in Africa, it will be well positioned to “disrupt naval and maritime passage along the central and eastern Mediterranean, and establish coastal airfields that would make global transit of Russian aircraft—including anti-submarine aircraft—possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the June mutiny, the Kremlin is now forced to come up with a plan dealing with the reorganization of Wagner’s ongoing operations in Africa as seamlessly as possible. As one of Prigozhin’s people stated after the uprising, “entire sectors of Russian foreign policy are dependent on the assets of Wagner PMC abroad, and if they are removed, there will be a rapid compression of Russian influence, more in Africa, to a lesser extent in Syria.” In fact, the CAR leadership has already expressed concerns regarding the Wagner chief’s highly precarious position inside Russia and how this would impact the PMC’s presence in the country; yet the leadership has also declared readiness to sign contracts with other Russian “instructors,” should Moscow decide so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, no matter how the war in Ukraine plays out or how the fate of Prigozhin is ultimately decided, the Kremlin will likely have strong incentives to maintain its use of PMCs—including a restructured Wagner Group or its subsidiaries—in Africa to ensure uninterrupted access to the continent’s gold reserves, among other benefits, and to destabilize Western strategic partnerships with different African states. Importantly, as the invasion of Ukraine will inevitably produce more veterans seeking adequate remuneration amid Russia’s wartime economy, it can be expected that Russian PMCs might expand the size and scale of their current operations in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-do-now-new-offer-new-tactics-and-new-branding&quot;&gt;What to Do Now? New Offer, New Tactics, and New Branding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s forays in Africa present the West with serious strategic dilemmas, as letting Russia expand further affects the United States and allied interests, but attacking it head-on can backfire and end up fueling Moscow’s narrative, something recently experienced by France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, the West cannot afford to stand idle and resort only to “strategic patience,” as the stakes are too high considering that Africa is the continent with the youngest and fastest-growing population, with daunting challenges that have direct consequences for global security and stability. Russia is both uninterested and unable to foster sound and sustainable development in Africa, as it does not provide substantial aid nor capacity building beyond the military-security realm. Instead, its entrenchment can only compound the challenges that Africa faces and comes with major risks, especially for Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it would be delusive to expect new grand strategies at times when the United States and Europe struggle to sustain their joint efforts in the two most pressing theaters of strategic competition: Eurasia and the Indo-Pacific. Traditional key Western stakeholders in Africa such as the United States and France have both recently heralded a “reframing” of their approaches, in which the security component is relegated to the background, to the benefit of political, economic, and social engagements. This is a sound evolution—especially considering that ongoing Russian efforts in these arenas are rather limited—but it leaves free ground for Russian progress in the security realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new rules of engagement for the West to confront Russia in Africa therefore stand somewhere between “strategic patience” and “grand strategy.” This section lays out recommendations for Western policymakers, stressing the importance of equal footing cooperation with African partners in order to offer attractive and efficient alternatives catered to the region’s security and prosperity aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overarching-recommendations&quot;&gt;Overarching Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devise a security cooperation package that will be principled but not transactional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s current approach of providing security assistance through Wagner remains attractive to many African nations despite it being expensive in the longer term (local governments have to pay the PMC for its services in addition to accepting its multiyear commercial conditions, while also losing at least part of Western aid and risking sanctions). This is because the “regime survival package” offered by Russia in the region, which is beset by chronic instability and military coups, supersedes any other potential gains from traditional cooperation agreements advanced by Western partners, which are usually based on institutional capacity building instead of securing the authorities themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mali, for instance, Wagner agreed to provide the Malian authorities with helicopters and ammunition that the French were always reluctant to consider due to rising levels of violence and continued insurgencies, among other reasons. This issue calls for a more horizontal and less vertical Western approach to cooperation that will remain principled, but not based on conditions. Western security assistance should thus ultimately serve political objectives that are consistent with the transatlantic community’s values and principles, but due diligence should be conducted upstream through arms control policies and downstream through accompaniment and monitoring—not during the negotiation phase or political engagement, so as to alleviate the sentiment that Western support is a politically motivated bargaining chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redouble efforts in the energy domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia does not thrive in Africa only through Wagner and security assistance, even though its efforts in this regard are particularly extensive. Moscow also offers assistance in the energy domain, notably through a push for nuclear energy to meet the continent’s growing needs. While Western countries are late to engage in energy diplomacy in Africa, they should redouble their efforts, as this will be one of the key parameters of strategic competition on the continent. Engaging in energy diplomacy is also central to countering the widespread narrative that Western countries are only interested in plundering the continent’s resources for their own prosperity, without benefiting Africans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build strategic partnerships free from “neo–Cold War” perceptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be recognized as a preferable alternative to Russia, the West should direct its efforts toward the key “swing states”: major regional players that maintain close ties with the Kremlin, such as Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Egypt. Yet the Western reengagement should not resemble a neo–Cold War approach, forcing the countries to take sides through “carrots and sticks.” Instead, it should take the form of a strategic dialogue aimed at better understanding why these African states maintain ties with Russia, in order to assess if the West can offer something more attractive. The West should also strengthen partnerships with other countries on the continent committed to building functioning institutions, robust militaries, and strong technological bases, including but not limited to Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, and Botswana, especially when those countries are courted by Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Actively prove Russian narratives wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West should continue exposing the failures of corrupt regimes, especially those that engage in mafia-type deals with the Russian government, as well as widespread atrocities and human rights abuses committed by Russia-linked groups—including Wagner paramilitaries—in Africa. But perhaps more importantly, the United States and the European Union should promote their own success stories in the region, while also reflecting on the legitimate concerns of many African nations. The West should also invest more in establishing or supporting reliable local pan-African media outlets promoting African voices and perspectives on key regional issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engage with new partners that are more palatable to the African public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many African countries are enthusiastic about increased “South to South” cooperation and would welcome engagement with leaders from the Global South. However, these relations remain largely nascent at this stage, as the major nonaligned states such as Brazil or India are also figuring out how to best engage with Africa. In the longer term, increased “triangulation” between Africa, the Global South, and the West could prove mutually beneficial, with India and Brazil becoming the key partners in this effort as they are pro-democracy without appearing anti-Russian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preserve an ability to act against traditional and potential new threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s continued advances in Africa are also risk multipliers, with the most prominent one being rising levels of terrorism in the countries where Russians, including Wagner fighters, set foot. According to the 2022 Global Terrorism Index, 48 percent of all terrorism-related deaths worldwide occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, with three of the top ten countries—Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger—all having a Wagner presence. Increased levels of terrorism coupled with the ongoing Russian hybrid warfare efforts in the region—including information warfare and cyberattacks, weaponization of migration, and disruption of critical infrastructure—have the potential to further fuel instability and insecurity on the continent. Facing these threats implies that the West should retain certain capabilities in the region, including defensive equipment and airlift options, to protect both Western citizens and African partners in case of serious violent outbreaks, as well as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to disclose intelligence on Wagner’s nefarious activities on the continent to partners in Africa and dissuade them from partnering with the PMC. Finally, the United States and its allies should also retain an ability to carry out defensive strikes against Wagner in the event of an assault, as happened in Syria in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The United States: Africa is too important to be let down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently published public documents, as well as statements by U.S. government officials, show Washington’s eagerness to treat African countries as peer partners, which undoubtedly is a positive development. But to be effective, the United States should adopt a whole of Africa strategy rather than only a sub-Saharan strategy, especially when it comes to challenging Russian advances across the continent, given the interconnectedness between North Africa, the Sahel strip, and sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Europe: Get serious about “Europeanisation.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France has been the main prey of Russia’s forays in Africa. Anti-French sentiment and the Russian disinformation apparatus have become so entrenched in certain parts of the continent that any French-led effort to turn the tide tends to result in adverse outcomes. France has therefore opted for a transformation of its relations with Africa, presented by President Macron on February 27, 2023, as an intention to build a “new, balanced, reciprocal, and responsible relationship” underpinned by the expressed needs of African partners. This entails a reduction of France’s military personnel across the continent, following the termination of the Barkhane counterterrorism operation in Sahel late last year, and co-management with African partners of French military bases on the continent (except for the one in Djibouti dedicated to the Indo-Pacific strategy). The expectation is that reducing the focus on security and defense will move the otherwise rich Franco-African cooperation into the limelight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Europeans welcome the ongoing reorientations in France’s strategic thinking. Yet if Paris lowers its profile, this requires others to step up, both at the national and EU levels. Paris has pushed for years for Europeans to get more involved in Africa—for example through the Takuba task force in the Sahel, or more recently through the “Team Europe” coordinated initiative between member states and EU institutions resulting in trips to Ethiopia, Niger, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Despite genuine French efforts at coordination, the view in some European capitals has sometimes been that France looks after its own interests in Africa, and then seeks partners to share the burden. Right or wrong, this view could prove an obstacle for Paris. In the meantime, France’s unique know-how and assets, let alone francophone connections and the importance of the African diaspora in France—the largest in Europe—will remain indispensable. Paris should therefore be genuine in its effort to empower other Europeans to take on increased responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the national level, some European countries are expected to step up and seem to be willing to do so. This is the case for Germany, which has steadily increased its presence in the Sahel and recently completed its first-ever Sahel strategy. With a less visible colonial record on the continent, Germany could appear as a more acceptable partner than France in many places. Some perceived German weaknesses at the European level, such as its absence from the UN Security Council or its alleged leniency vis-à-vis Russia, could conversely prove to be assets for building confidence with Africans. But Germany will need to convince African states that it can be not only an assistance provider but also a partner for security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain also nurtures ambitions to become a strategic partner to Africa. Madrid has repeatedly voiced its interests for increased collective engagement with the Global South—notably Latin America and Africa—through EU or NATO efforts, and it will continue advocating for this cause during its presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 2023. In its recently released “Africa strategy,” Madrid pledges to send a warship to the Gulf of Guinea to fight piracy and increase security in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the United Kingdom, although not a member of the European Union, remains one of the most knowledgeable European players on Africa-related issues, as well as one of the most active and experienced actors confronting Russian threats worldwide. Despite a low interest for Africa in its Integrated Review, London heralds that it will keep prioritizing Europe’s “wider neighborhood.” Therefore, the country could become an important player in the region, should it have the political will to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, at the European level, the most recent declaration of the European Union–African Union summit held in February 2022 has committed to renewing and enhancing “cooperation for peace and security.” EU missions in Africa, which were generally assembled upon French request, have been collateral victims of Russia’s progress. The European Union seems aware of the need to change its approach and is experimenting with new forms of partnership—such as the one with Niger, in which the African country was given the lead on operations, with European supply of equipment through the European Peace Facility and growing bilateral support from several member states. Although the coup in Niger has put an end to this experiment in a very fragile state, this approach was certainly going in the right direction and could be replicated in other, more stable countries. In general, the European Peace Facility, as an instrument initially conceived of in Paris to support its own efforts in Africa (taking over the Africa Peace Facility) and later reoriented to support the Ukrainian Armed Forces, should be supported in a way to fund efforts in both theaters. The European Peace Facility has the potential to be a very competitive instrument, with due diligence carried out up front to ensure that arms are supplied into safe hands, for clear and shared objectives. Failing to do so could add to the sentiment of double standards and frustration in the relations between Africa and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成：「墨落無悔」寫法諷刺戴耀廷「講咗唔算數」、惟非替戴填補空白&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成完成作供 指若政府五大訴求僅不回應雙普選會「袋住先」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hZ6rsFw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第104天。鄒家成繼續接受盤問，表示戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議只是發起「墨落無悔」的「導火線」，刺激他們思考「要簽啲乜嘢」去展現抗爭意志，但他們並非想製作一份以協調會議為基礎的協議、聲明無寫上會議已達成共識的項目，「墨落」中會運用否決權迫特首回應五大訴求、及支持度不足須停止選舉工程兩點聲明，均是具爭議或暫時未有共識。法官陳慶偉問，發起「墨落無悔」是否填補戴耀廷留下的空白（fill the gap of Benny Tai）？鄒不同意。而就主控萬德豪指，鄒發起「墨落」是想集結人一起否決預算案，鄒說：「萬專員，我哋之間係唔係有咩誤會呀？唔同意」，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，張可森當時加上「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」，是承上啟下，諷刺戴耀廷「講咗嘅嘢唔算數」及帶出「墨落」兩點聲明；亦「畫龍點睛」，精要之處在「選民」，強調參選人如反悔要接受選民問責。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議與墨落無悔僅導火線未必有密切因果關係&quot;&gt;鄒稱戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議與「墨落無悔」僅導火線、未必有密切因果關係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成第6日作供，今續接受控方盤問。開庭前，有旁聽親友向鄒家成說：「今日最後一日」，鄒說「希望係啦」，有親友回應：「加油呀捱埋今日呀。」甫開庭，鄒笑着向主控萬德豪問：「Mr. Man, you don’t need Monday right?」林卓廷等發笑，萬德豪笑問：「Why are you asking me?」鄒答：「我會全力配合。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方盤問焦點，在於鄒家成等人發起的「墨落無悔」聲明，是否戴耀廷原擬要求參選人簽署的協調會議共識。控方先引鄒家成2020年6月與張可森和梁晃維的訪問發問，被問「點解發起抗爭聲明」時，鄒表示：「一路開幾次會都話係有一個共同綱領大家要簽，但喺無通知我哋嘅情況底下，跟住就開咗個記招跟住就話唔需要簽，嗰陣先知原來係唔需要簽。我哋第一個感覺就話我哋要簽返啲嘢喎，唔可以畀泛民主派單方面去撕毀約章。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒同意，他提及「一路開幾次會」是指新東協調會議。陳慶偉指理解鄒說法亦是指向其他兩人，鄒否認，並重申訪問前「我哋冇夾過」，3人均是「自說自話」，記者問題也是「當場先知」。李運騰提到，而鄒提到的感受，是其他兩人也有的感覺？鄒說根據當時討論，「我估佢哋應該都有呢個感覺」，追問下稱「我相信嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就訪問提到要簽「共同綱領」，鄒同意是指「已達成共識的共同綱領」，而提到不想被泛民撕毀約章，是想就已達成的共識簽署。萬問，因此3人發起「墨落無悔」？鄒認為「未必有一個好密切嘅因果關係」，指戴稱毋須簽文件的說法只是發起「墨落」的背景和「導火線（triggering point）」，刺激他們思考要簽什麼文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無將4點協調共識放墨落-因無助展現抗爭意志&quot;&gt;鄒稱無將4點協調共識放「墨落」 因無助展現抗爭意志&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續說，而「墨落」不一定反映協調會議已同意的事項，可能「更進一步」？鄒同意，指「因為我哋唔係想整一個以協調會議為基礎嘅協議呀嘛」，故聲明「其實冇寫一啲已達成共識嘅項目喺度」。李提到，但聲明提及「最大公因數」，「墨落」兩點聲明（即會運用否決權，及如支持度不足會停止選舉工程），是否就是「最大公因數」？鄒否認，指辦初選、辦論壇、「贏咗有得選，輸咗冇得選」、及以靈童制為替補機制4點共識，才是他們討論時「搵到五區嘅最大公因數」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並強調，沒有將上述4點放進「墨落」，「因為對我嚟講一件事還一件事」，發起「墨落」目的就是想「展現抗爭意志」和「保障返一啲政治素人」。鄒指他的確同意想簽一份由初選籌組平台提供的文件，因這是他參加兩次新東會議後的想法；不過當戴稱毋須簽，就刺激他們思考「我哋需要簽啲乜嘢去展現我哋嘅抗爭意志」，經討論後得出兩點聲明。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪再問，鄒認為「墨落」是一個好機會，讓他放進4點共識讓人們簽署嗎？鄒說不會，「因為嗰4點係無助於展現抗爭意志嘅，我覺得一般市民大眾根本就唔 care 嗰4點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指張可森擬墨落理應無悔一句-諷刺戴耀廷講咗嘅嘢唔算數&quot;&gt;鄒指張可森擬「墨落理應無悔」一句 諷刺戴耀廷「講咗嘅嘢唔算數」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落」提到「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」，鄒引張可森指這是「畫龍點眼」的說法，精要之處在於「選民」兩字，張想強調「墨落」是面向公眾的聲明，「要接受問責嘅對象係選民，而唔係我哋三個或者其他參選人」。萬德豪說任何公開聲明也是面向公眾，鄒說：「所以佢想畫龍點睛加呢句說話囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續主動交代背景，「畀大家再了解多啲個 picture」，指「墨落」初稿標題原只是「本土派立場聲明書」，但張可森「想昇華成個聲明，叫我哋畀啲時間佢再諗多一個標題」，終加上「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭」，並改為「抗爭派立場聲明書」，內文亦加入「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」一句。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，「點睛」之處是運用否決權迫使特首回應五大訴求？鄒指「墨落」兩點聲明當然是重點，但重申精要之處在「選民」。李運騰問，即鄒想透過聲明告訴選民他們進入立法會會做的事？鄒說：「我同意㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續說，但看到聲明的選民並不會知道參與者之間達成過的協議，根本不存在「失信」，鄒重申「之前協調會議達成咗嘅共識係唔重要嘅……選民根本冇興趣知道嗰4點」，而「墨落理應無悔」一句主要指參選人簽了「墨落」並同意聲明中的兩點，如最後違反承諾就等於「失信於選民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指如那是真的，該句便應附在提及兩點聲明的第三段。鄒指因此他曾提過據張可森說法，該句是「過渡句」，「佢話想產生一個承上啟下同畫龍點睛嘅作用」，張一方面想「承上」諷刺戴耀廷「講咗嘅嘢唔算數」，另一方面想「啟下」談及兩點聲明，「佢有佢嘅堅持啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指草擬聲明時亦考慮該點是否具爭議-指會運用否決權重要亦具爭議&quot;&gt;鄒指草擬聲明時亦考慮該點是否具爭議 指會運用否決權重要亦具爭議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒在盤問下續指，協調會議4點共識對選民不重要，是因無助展現抗爭意志，但認為辦初選和論壇、及贏輸機制是對參選人重要，至於靈童制他則不太重視。陳慶偉打斷指，認為靈童制對參選人和選民重要，指黃之鋒於九東會議就此爭論，如他投選黃之鋒，也想知道誰是他的 Plan B；陳亦認為贏輸機制對選民重要，舉例若他投票予萬德豪，而萬落敗仍參加正式選舉，他一定不會投選他。陳又主動提到「三投三不投」，指如果贏輸機制不重要，「吳政亨為什麼要花這麼多錢在《蘋果日報》賣廣告？要賣給誰看？《蘋果日報》的目標讀者是誰？是公眾！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒說「嗱我初選真係唔識佢（吳政亨）㗎」，又笑着回應，「其實我同意你講嘅嘢，我啱啱已經準備講你啱啱講嘅嘢喇」，被告和旁聽席發笑。鄒並指討論以靈童制抑或排名制作替補機制時，大家都不想被DQ後自己主張的理念無人繼承，舉例如他被DQ，用排名制便會由范國威代表他，但「支持我嘅人未必係會投畀佢范國威嘅」。鄒續指對他而言，靈童制「我覺得係常識嚟㗎喇」，新東亦幾乎無爭拗，在2016年立法會選舉亦已開始使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又重申，沒有將靈童制寫進「墨落」，是因屬五區共同共識，並指「我喺 set 一個聲明嘅時候，決定咩 point 呢，除咗係覺得能夠展現抗爭意志呢個考慮之外，亦都有具爭議性或者當時未有共識嘅考慮」。陳仲衡問，鄒是指因戴耀廷未能就參與者同意的事項提供聲明簽署，故3人決定就未取得共識的事項發布聲明？鄒說：「呢個真係我哋當時討論個次序。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉表示明白，但若然如此為何不在聲明表明：戴耀廷曾提出就已同意的事項簽協議但食言、而這不重要，重要的是有未取得共識的事項，而發起人望邀請人就此簽署。鄒說：「我覺得交代咗喎，你啱啱講嘅嘢都正正係我哋嘅諗法嚟。」陳慶偉問，因此「墨落」是一份補充文件，補充（complement）共同綱領？鄒重申，原本達成的共識是「墨落」的背景，而會運用否決權一點有很大爭議性，他們三人亦覺得重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒不同意墨落是嘗試填補戴耀廷留下的空白&quot;&gt;鄒不同意「墨落」是嘗試填補戴耀廷留下的空白&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問到，梁晃維於訪問稱：「既然如果戴教授佢唔希望好似送上一個魔鬼嘅祝福，令到好多人被DQ嘅話，咁就不如我哋作為有意參選人 take up 返嗰個責任，所以就會有呢個聲明書出現」，問是否指因戴耀廷不想簽署文件，故3人發聲明就是承擔製造DQ風險的責任？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒重申，戴稱不想製造「DQ紅書」，故三人決定發起一個自願性質的聲明，讓參選人自行承擔被DQ風險。陳慶偉續問，即3人嘗試填補戴留下的空白（「fill the gap of Benny Tai」，即頂替戴無做的事）？鄒不同意，亦不同意會予聲明讀者此印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱草擬墨落時將項目分成有共識及具爭議或暫未有共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱草擬「墨落」時將項目分成有共識、及具爭議或暫未有共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒盤問下續指，不知道新西和港島有否就否決財案達成共識。萬德豪問他有無興趣知道？鄒說「其實都唔係話咁有興趣」，旁聽發笑。鄒續提到討論草擬「墨落」時，曾將協調會議上討論過的項目分成兩個類別，有如「兩個籃」，一個是「最大公因數」，即已達成共識的事項；另一個是「具爭議性」或「暫時未有共識」的項目。而當時他帶領以新東協調會議為藍本一起討論，並第一時間說明第二次新東會議的爭拗，將否決預算案「揼咗落去具爭議性呢個籃度」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪追問他不想知道新西和港島會議的事？鄒指因當時主要想梳理兩個籃內有什麼，「既然我搵到喇，咁我哋就冇再進一步去討論，即係份『墨落無悔』趕住出街呀。」鄒並指，其後找出辦初選等4點共識，放進有共識一籃。至於就「我認同若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」一點，則放進「暫時未有共識」一籃。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱出線人數未達共識-故停止選舉工程一點寫得較籠統&quot;&gt;鄒稱出線人數未達共識 故停止選舉工程一點寫得較「籠統」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒解釋，雖然這點在新東無爭議，但梁晃維當時提到港島「好煩好複雜」，出線人數未傾好、「又無啦啦話有四票」；張可森則稱九西連目標議席亦未傾好，亦有區指要「n（目標議席）+1」或「n+2」，故他們終將該點聲明「寫得籠統少少」，讓其他區參選人未來仍有一個商討的空間。他們亦認為該點「幾重要」，因是保障政治素人，故也放進「墨落無悔」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉指，如這是鄒的關注，聲明卻無提及出線名單數目、或該數目如何決定。鄒同意沒寫明，解釋因當時有數個區連出線人數和目標議席都未達共識，故只寫上「可得議席範圍」；亦因有選區會於初選後再討論出線名單，遂故意無寫上棄選的時間點，以讓簽署人跟從該區得出的結果。鄒又強調，棄選機制是初選邏輯，亦保障本土政治素人，「可能因為我哋三個都係政治素人，我哋睇到個重要性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指他明白該點精神如「三投三不投」，及對素人的重要性，但再指如鄒關注出線名單數，為何不在聲明寫明，又指三人當時應在想戴耀廷遺漏了一個重要的事項，「重要到認為你們要填補空白！」鄒回應，認為各區協調會議並非沒有處理棄選機制，而在可見的未來亦不是會沒有共識，他認為聲明已清晰交代，至於法官指議席數目不清晰、沒有寫明「6 6 4 4 3」，「係因為其他區都仲傾緊吖嘛」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指，控方的立場就是，這兩點其實就是參與者達成最重要的共識，所以鄒家成3人才決定將這兩點放進「墨落」，但鄒說有關目標議席未有共識，故是測試鄒的邏輯，問鄒是否明白，惟鄒搖頭，亦指沒有要再解釋的事項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落無悔非35計劃參選人共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落無悔」非「35+計劃」參選人共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就鄒早前稱「墨落無悔」與「35+計劃」無關，萬問若然如此，鄒實可自己發表聲明，無需叫其他人簽署一份聯合聲明？鄒回應：「我係可以有呢個選項，但我冇選擇呢個選項。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬指鄒沒有這樣做，是因為想集結其他人一同在立會過半後否決財政預算案？鄒望着萬說：「萬專員，我哋之間係唔係有咩誤會呀？」引來哄堂大笑，鄒續說「唔同意」。萬再問，「墨落無悔」的內容，是否「35+計劃」參選人達成的共識？鄒說「不是」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第104天。鄒家成繼續接受盤問，表示五大訴求中最重視雙普選，但若政府回應除雙普選以外的四個訴求，他也會接受，指爭取訴求需要長時間、五大訴求並非一步登天：「袋住先啦！爭取雙普選真係唔係一時三刻做到。」控方質疑鄒是「妥協」，鄒不同意，並指若政府不回應五大訴求，只是給予「甜頭」來「氹」議員投贊成票，此情況下投贊成才屬妥協；但在這情況下，他仍會對預算案投反對票，強調「有回應（五大訴求）先至有得傾」，亦同意張可森稱「抗爭就係不容妥協嘅藝術」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒今完成6日作供，步入囚室前頻頻向旁聽和律師席抱拳致謝。新東餘下3名被告林卓廷、梁國雄及柯耀林均不出庭作供，柯耀林一方將傳召一名辯方證人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;張可森曾發文稱新西與會者同意會運用否決權-鄒指沒看過&quot;&gt;張可森曾發文稱新西與會者同意會運用否決權 鄒指沒看過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成繼續接受盤問。他在盤問下同意，知道張可森和梁晃維有 Facebook，但「未 friend 到成日睇」，對他們有關初選的帖文也未必有興趣。控方續展示張可森6月11日、即「墨落」發布後翌日的帖文，提到與鄒和梁晃維一同發起「墨落」，及新西協調會議上所有人都逐一表明，同意「會運用立法會權員的權力，包括否決財政預算案，要求政府落實五大訴求」。鄒指沒有看過該帖文，亦無獲張告知，他亦無出席過新西協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱政府回應五大訴求才有得傾即使有甜頭亦不妥協&quot;&gt;鄒稱政府回應五大訴求才「有得傾」、即使有「甜頭」亦不妥協&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就張可森於3名發起人的訪問提及，「香港而家討論緊嘅唔係政治，唔係咩妥協嘅藝術，唔係開天殺價、落地還錢，唔係我哋一開始話攬炒，然後佢回一回價我哋又唔攬炒」，鄒指理解張意思是不會看到預算案「派吓錢、或者講吓起醫院咁樣」就會「妥協」。萬德豪指張意思是3人一開始就想「攬炒」？鄒指應無此意思，張亦無向他解釋過如何看「攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引張提及，「我哋香港而家討論緊嘅係抗爭，即係如果政治係妥協嘅藝術，抗爭就係不容妥協嘅藝術」，鄒同意其說法。萬追問，即不會妥協、不會談判（negotiate）？鄒說要視乎如何看「妥協」，並指理解張可森稱不容妥協意思是，如果政府在財政預算案可能「畀咗啲甜頭」予立法會議員或民眾、但不回應五大訴求，「我都係投反對票㗎喇」；而「除非你回應咗五大訴求啦、除非你喺 budget 度畀我睇到你有回應啦，有回應先至有得傾囉」，鄒亦同意張的看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問若只回應部分訴求會否談判-鄒稱視乎政府是否有心推動&quot;&gt;被問若只回應部分訴求會否談判 鄒稱視乎政府是否「有心推動」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬問，而即使政府只回應一個或兩個訴求，鄒亦會同意與政府談判？鄒指，「最重要係睇政府個態度係咪有心去推動」，指看過財政預算案、與政府官員有對話，「傾完之後其實你都大概有個了解㗎喇，呢個過程我覺得都係一個談判過程。」鄒又指，如果政府不回應五大訴求，用其他方法「氹啲立法會議員去投贊成票」，此情況下投贊成便屬「妥協」，故張稱「抗爭係不容妥協」，是指「爭取五大訴求係唔可以妥協」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬指，但如果政府無回應雙普選，鄒會滿意嗎？鄒承認五大訴求中最重視爭取雙普選，但「真係要好整體睇吓政府如何回應」，亦「真係好難逐個逐個訴求抽走再問我點樣睇」。鄒又指要視乎回應時間：「我假設去到十年之後，其實啲示威者都坐完監咁濟㗎喇，咁要求政府釋放示威者仲有冇意義呢？所以其實係好複雜㗎答呢條問題」，並指除了政府已回應的兩個訴求（撤回逃犯條例和6.12暴動定性），餘下三個訴求中（釋放所有示威者、成立獨立調查委員會及雙普選）「雙普選係應該要堅持到底嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱若政府僅不回應雙普選會袋住先-控方質疑屬妥協惟鄒否認&quot;&gt;鄒稱若政府僅不回應雙普選會「袋住先」 控方質疑屬「妥協」惟鄒否認&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，如果在2021年預算案，政府願回應除雙普選以外的四個訴求，鄒會滿意嗎？鄒說：「我會呀。」萬追問：「你會？你會接受？」鄒再說「我會呀」，指「因為爭取訴求係需要長時間」，重申爭取五大訴求「唔係要一步登天，背後更重要嘅精神係，一種鍥而不捨、繼續爭取嘅精神，所以要逐步逐步嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬追問，即使對鄒來說，雙普選是最重要的訴求？鄒笑言：「袋住先啦！」多人發笑，鄒續說：「爭取雙普選真係唔係一時三刻做到嘅，要搞諮詢都要時間。」法官李運騰續指，但由當選至政府翌年發表預算案，只有很短、以月計的時間，鄒同意。萬續問，那鄒認為他所說的是妥協嗎？鄒再重申：「我唔同意喎，因為我爭取緊五大訴求吖嘛。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續引張可森提及：「當你簽咗呢張嘢（「墨落無悔」）應承咗嘅時候，你絕對唔可以反悔，唔可以話我哋政治就係妥協㗎嘞，所以我哋一開始開個價咁高希望可以落返嚟」，惟鄒說：「佢冇講爭取五大訴求要一步登天喎，Mr. Man。」萬再問，那鄒曾否告知選民他不是要一步登天？鄒指沒有，指他甚少與選民就五大訴求溝通，他在初選期間「主要都係宣揚香港民族理念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒重申運用否決權無達共識-墨落無悔並非重申立場&quot;&gt;鄒重申運用否決權無達共識 「墨落無悔」並非「重申」立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦再質疑「墨落無悔」是協調會議共識。就3名發起人在6月19日向組織者發出的訊息，提到當時共39位以上參與者以個人或政黨名義簽署，並指「初選原設共同綱領，有意以『運用包括否決財政預算案之基本法賦予的立法會權力，迫使特首回應五大訴求。』的素人以及政黨因此共同目標而集結」。萬德豪問「共同目標」是否否決預算案。鄒指應是按「墨落」的結果理解，即有39人因為「墨落」的第一點聲明而「集結」簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬亦指訊息提到「初選原設共同綱領」，鄒解釋是指協調會議原本有討論過否決權議題，但中間有些拗撬，最後有39個人或政黨同意。法官陳仲衡指，但似乎整段也是談及戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽協議之前的事，鄒不同意，指「如果唔係唔會出到『墨落無悔』39個人嘅結果出嚟啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，而訊息提到「在戴教授決定參與者毋須簽署共同綱領後，雖然大部份參與者有簽署『抗爭派立場聲明書』重申自己堅定的立場」，故「墨落」是「重申」運用否決權的立場？鄒問控方是否指參與者原本一直同意會運用否決權一點，而他們有「墨落」後簽署，故是「重申」立場，萬同意。鄒說：「我只能夠講，我個人上，我由持至終都係支持嘅」，而他不是代表其他簽署者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱不獲發新東協議文件癱瘓議會不包括解散立會&quot;&gt;鄒稱不獲發新東協議文件、「癱瘓議會」不包括解散立會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續確認，就「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」文件，「冇發過畀我。」萬續問鄒是否沒有反對協議內容，惟法官陳慶偉指鄒沒收過文件。萬指這是控方案情，林卓廷說「吓」。李運騰續指若證人已否認，控方沒有基礎繼續提問，但引文件提及首7張名單參與官方選舉，問是否有達成共識，鄒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就鄒家成於新東初選民間論壇提到，每個代議士都應有心理準備「用任何手段，癱瘓每一個議會嘅進行」，鄒指不包括解散立法會。萬續指，而鄒當時知道否決預算案，特首可解散立法會？鄒說：「《基本法》係咁寫，」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後指出案情，指鄒家成與其他被告串謀取得立法會主導權，無差別否決預算案，迫使特首或政府回應五大訴求，並意圖顛覆國家政權，鄒表示不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒作供完畢-林卓廷梁國雄柯耀林不出庭作供&quot;&gt;鄒作供完畢 林卓廷、梁國雄、柯耀林不出庭作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示盤問完結，大律師陳世傑指沒有覆問，亦不會傳召證人，辯方案情完結。鄒完成6日作供，在懲教陪同下步回被告欄，一度向旁聽席微笑戚眉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表林卓廷的大律師沈士文及代表梁國雄的大律師黃宇逸其後分別表示，林卓廷和梁國雄均選擇不作供亦沒有證人。代表柯耀林的大律師唐樂山則指，柯選擇不作供，但會傳召一名事實證人，意味新東案情將完結。法官李運騰笑指：「我必須說這星期的尾聲有些驚喜（surprises）。」案件押至下周一（11日）續審，除柯耀林外，尚餘參選超區的李予信和衞生服務界余慧明未開展辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，鄒不住向旁聽親友揮手，又指向自己做睡覺手勢，步入囚室時又不停雙手抱拳作揖，向旁聽人士和律師道謝。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成：「五大訴求，缺一不可」精神是鍥而不捨爭取、非求一步登天&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/9PSRQLV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）踏入審訊第103天。鄒家成繼續作供，表示受邀出席抗爭派記者會，理解「冇一個確切嘅人去組織」，而會上除讀出的立場聲明外並無共同發言。就岑敖暉會上指若「暴政當道、魔警橫行」，相信不論內容也會否決預算案，鄒認為岑並非主張無差別否決，因岑曾向他提過「唔通政府掟幾千萬查警暴我都投反對票？」，鄒亦認為只要政府於預算案有回應五大訴求已足夠。法官陳慶偉指，但「五大訴求」口號是「缺一不可」而非「一個即可」，鄒回應「五大訴求，缺一不可」的精神不是要求「一步登天」，而是即使政府回應一個或兩個訴求後，仍鍥而不捨繼續爭取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒今完成主問，續接受控方盤問，表示雖認為35+不可能，但無於初選論壇表明，是因論壇始終由一班「相信35+有可能」的人舉辦，故想「禮貌少少」，「費事搞禍人哋個場」。而就《國安法》後帖文稱「有啲嘢我唔可以繼續講」、但相信過去理念已表達清楚，鄒同意當時仍擁抱過去表達過的理念，無論《國安法》有否落實，其理念也一樣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱受邀出席抗爭派記者會標準為非傳統泛民初選勝出者&quot;&gt;鄒稱受邀出席抗爭派記者會、標準為非傳統泛民初選勝出者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成第5日作供，辯方就2020年7月15日抗爭派記者會發問。鄒同意，本土抗爭派於初選有很好的成績，召開記招是為了多謝選民，並向泛民主派「伸出橄欖枝」。法官陳仲衡問記招由誰發起，鄒認為「冇一個確切嘅人去組織」，而他是前一日受邀出席，印象中是張崑陽、岑敖暉、黃之鋒其中一個，「但我真係唔肯定係邊個。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/asM8jKk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年7月15日 抗爭派記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指邀請他的人有提及出席人士的標準，他理解是「非傳統泛民嘅初選勝出者」，而該人無特別講為何想開記招，鄒亦覺得，選舉完結後開記招向民眾宣布一些訊息「係好正常嘅事」。法官陳慶偉提及陳志全無被邀請（陳早前稱獲朱凱廸邀請但拒絕），因他不是傳統泛民，鄒指他不知道陳有否被邀請，但「我自己唔會將佢咁樣分類」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱除抗爭派聲明外無共同發言會上發言僅代表發言者自己&quot;&gt;鄒稱除抗爭派聲明外無共同發言、會上發言僅代表發言者自己&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，於同月14日約好時間、地點，並於翌日早上約10時到達記招場地學聯會址，指有關記招事宜「全部都係嗰日朝早先至一齊傾」，他們首先討論當日發布、後於會上讀出的「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」。陳仲衡問誰帶領討論？鄒說「其實冇㗎，大家有意見就講出嚟」，而他們當時使用「Google Doc」，「有幾個人一齊打（字）緊」，認為每個出席者均看過該篇聲明，「大家都同意咗。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師陳世傑問，那除了該聲明，記者會上還有否任何共同發言（joint announcement or statement）？鄒指「除咗呢個聲明冇喇」。鄒並指，記招前有討論如何處理記者提問，「除咗指名道姓之外，其他問題呢就大家想答就自己答⋯⋯如果自己想補充，就自己攞支咪去講。」陳世傑問，會上回應是代表在場所有人抑或發言者自己？鄒說：「佢自己。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒同意王百羽梁晃維就否決財案及攬炒議會等發言&quot;&gt;鄒同意王百羽、梁晃維就否決財案及攬炒議會等發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續就其他人發言回應，法官陳仲衡問到王百羽提及：「我哋嗰個最大公因數就一定係講緊堅決反對財政預算案，如果五大訴求無落實嘅話，依個係我哋共同嘅諗法」，是代表所有人發言？鄒說：「其他人我唔知，我自己個立場一直都係話，如果財政預算案我見唔到關於五大訴求嘅內容，我個人都係會投反對票」，指他同意王的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3A1obQr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 王百羽（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於梁晃維強調一旦進入立法會，「無論我哋係對政府嘅提案定係財政預算案去投下反對票，呢一個都係我哋作為代議士嘅一個合法權利…我哋亦都繼續提倡議會攬炒嘅路線，係逼使政府係向人民低頭」，鄒表示「我同意呀」，其後在盤問下稱與梁從無就「攬炒」有任何討論，故不完全知道梁當時意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gnqNxtq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒不同意岑敖暉主張無差別否決指岑曾反問唔通政府掟幾千萬查警暴也反對&quot;&gt;鄒不同意岑敖暉主張無差別否決、指岑曾反問「唔通政府掟幾千萬查警暴」也反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而被問會否否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，岑敖暉回答如能進入議會，「我哋係會好堅定行使基本法賦予畀代議士嘅權力，所以答案係：是嘅。」鄒指不同意岑這句話，認為他「答得唔係好清楚」，不過指岑其後被追問「即係無論嗰個財政預算案嘅內容係咩嘢都會否決？」時，有提到「唔係㗎」，並重新再答：「如果香港係已經落實咗五大訴求，如果係有真普選嘅話，我相信我哋係會有磋商嘅空間；但係如果仍然今日係暴政當道、魔警橫行嘅話，我相信我哋係無論咩嘢內容都係會否決呢一個財政預算案嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JQsSrgy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 岑敖暉（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒表示，認為岑不是談及「無差別」否決財案，而他同意岑此說法。惟陳慶偉指岑雖無用「無差別」一詞，但提及「無論咩嘢內容都係會否決」，實際上傳達了該訊息。鄒不同意，認為岑當時提到「暴政當道、魔警橫行」是指政府不回應五大訴求的表現，如政府有回應五大訴求，這些情況應不會出現，而如果繼續出現，則代表政府無回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指認為政府有回應五大訴求已足夠非一定全落實才不反對&quot;&gt;鄒指認為政府有回應五大訴求已足夠、非一定全落實才不反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問，岑敖暉是指否決預算案的決定性因素（determining factor），是五大訴求有否「落實」？鄒同意，但補充就他而言「我覺得係『回應』已經夠」，「唔一定要五個（訴求）齊晒之後先⋯⋯」李運騰打斷，質疑岑要求五大訴求「落實」、但鄒只是要求「回應」，二人立場是否不同？鄒指「可能因為我識佢」，故認為岑用「落實」一字「唔係話一定要晒五大訴求先會再同政府傾」，並在李追問下稱不同意岑說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰笑指，鄒早前稱同意，現在又說不同意。鄒重申，理解岑敖暉該句表達如政府無回應五大訴求，即「暴政當道、魔警橫行」繼續持續的情況下，「budget 入面都唔會見到關於五大訴求嘅內容，咁就投反對票喇」。而他記招前無與岑就預算案有任何討論，但記招後岑曾向他提及：「唔通政府掟幾千萬查警暴我都投反對票？」，令他知道岑並非主張無差別否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱五大訴求非一步登天為鍥而不捨繼續爭取精神&quot;&gt;鄒稱五大訴求非一步登天、為鍥而不捨繼續爭取精神&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉即指，「五大訴求」的口號並非只有「五大訴求」，是「五大訴求，缺一不可」，而非「五大訴求，一個即可（only one met）」。鄒回應：「我覺得『五大訴求，缺一不可』背後嘅精神，並唔係要求一步登天，而係一個即使政府回應咗一個或者兩個（訴求）之後，一種鍥而不捨繼續爭取嘅精神。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，最後政府永遠也不能滿足他們的要求（appetite），指「你看，政府已經落實了其中一個訴求，即撤回《逃犯條例》」，鄒說「同意做咗」，陳說而撤回修例後又發生了這一連串事件。不過陳指理解鄒的回應，相信岑敖暉當時不是指落實所有訴求，而是如政府將回應部分訴求、部分訴求有機會落實，就不會否決，鄒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱極權是不受制約有權勢者欺壓無權勢者-官打斷稱毋須深究&quot;&gt;鄒稱極權是不受制約有權勢者欺壓無權勢者 官打斷稱毋須深究&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於岑敖暉其後再提到立法會議員「絕對有權利喺每一個法案、每一個議案、每一個撥款都係投否決，呢一個係喺《基本法》賦予立法會議員非常之清晰嘅權利」，鄒表示同意，並理解岑只是強調「立法會議員係可以投反對票」、是《基本法》賦予立法會議員的權利，「佢並沒有話佢將來要每一樣嘢都投反對票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方亦問及鄒家成會上提到「我哋係時候要向世界，向香港人展示，我哋同呢個極權搏鬥嘅決心」，「極權」的意思。鄒指「我覺得極權係一個狀態嚟嘅，一種不受制約嘅有權勢者欺壓無權勢者嘅狀態，形成呢個狀態有兩個條件⋯⋯」，不過陳慶偉打斷說對政治看法無興趣。陳世傑追問「極權」與香港有何關係，惟陳慶偉再打斷說不認為需深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒同意若預算案無反映五大訴求開支-會向政府提問談判&quot;&gt;鄒同意若預算案無反映五大訴求開支 會向政府提問談判&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成其後接受代表黃碧雲及林卓廷的大律師沈士文盤問，同意2020年時已知道，議員可向各部門就預算案開支提問，而他曾提及以五大訴求為「唯一優先標準」審視財案，是將五大訴求與預算案連繫，並同意至少就成立獨立調查委員會、及重啟政改達至雙普選兩個訴求，均「需要用錢」，他打算當選後於討論預算案時就此發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉庭上早前提及「鉛水事件」獨立調查委員會，指無出現在預算案。沈士文續展示2016至17年度立法會財委會時任議員單仲偕就預算案的查詢，以及行政署長的回覆。主控萬德豪質疑，鄒當時並不在立法會會議，為何要就文件發問，沈士文指想問鄒當時是否打算入議會後利用此機制問這類問題。陳慶偉指太空泛，並認為毋須深入這些細節，指他提到鉛水事件獨立調查委員會，只因該調查突然出現，而他意思是如果調查委員會突然出現，預算案不會為該項目有所準備，但明白如預算案有項目是查警暴，鄒家成當然會表示小心審視預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文回應，展示該文件是指出鉛水事件獨立調查委員會的開支，於翌年預算案反映，陳慶偉指那與現時要裁決的議題無關，指鄒已表明會審視財案有否五大訴求的內容。鄒續同意，2020年時政府無回應成立獨立調查委員會等訴求，而他一旦當選，會優先向政府施壓要求成立調查委員會和落實雙普選，如政府回應會預期在2021年預算案反映，如看不到相關開支便會向政府提問，「到底對於呢兩個訴求，佢哋會點樣處理」，亦可謂在財委會與政府的「談判」階段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指不認識柯耀林不知李永成是沙田區政成員&quot;&gt;鄒指不認識柯耀林、不知李永成是沙田區政成員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表區政聯盟前召集人柯耀林的大律師唐樂山其後盤問，鄒同意，首次新東會議上人們「出出入入」，他不認識柯耀林，不知道他有否出席會議。而鄒第二次會議有與兩名民主黨代表就「會運用」否決權字眼爭論，辯方問鄒是否認得李永成是其中一個反對其動議的人？鄒指「如果坐喺我對面嗰個人係李永成，咁佢係有反對嘅」，又指「其中一個（反對）一定係林卓廷嘅代表」，但不知另一人身分。鄒又指，不知道李永成自2018年已不再屬民主黨，亦不知他是「區政聯盟」下「沙田區政」的成員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒同意國安法後仍擁抱過去理念&quot;&gt;鄒同意《國安法》後仍擁抱過去理念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成其後接受主控萬德豪盤問，就鄒家成7月5日帖文〈對不起，我回來了〉，提及「国安法過咗，或者有啲嘢我唔可以繼續講，以前準備嘅好多文宣、易拉架都已經用唔著，但相信我嘅理念喺過去已經表達得清清楚楚，亦都希望各位香港人會理解」，萬德豪指鄒沒有表明放棄過去理念，鄒說：「的確冇呢個意思。」萬問，因此當時鄒仍擁抱過去表達過的理念？鄒答「係」。萬指而不論《國安法》有否落實，鄒的理念也一樣？鄒再答「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方追問有否提過dq-官指替補機制一直是協調會議題肯定有提&quot;&gt;控方追問有否提過DQ 官指替補機制一直是協調會議題肯定有提&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成又同意，於參選宣言提到「我唔奢望喺殖民者嘅制度下可以議會過半奪取政治權力」，是表達35+不可能，因政府會以DQ阻民主派取35+，又指就個人會否被DQ，「我唔會評估為低（風險）嘅」。鄒續指，無在協調會議向人表示他會被DQ、也不記得有無人這樣提及，而他認為DQ議題貫徹整個初選，「一定有」參選人提過，但講不到是在何時何地由誰提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪欲追問，陳慶偉打斷指看不到為何要就此盤問，指替補機制一直是協調會議的議題，因此肯定有提到DQ，並着控方直接問問題。萬追問，有參選人提及會有DQ風險？惟陳慶偉打斷指「當然，不然呢？」。萬遂問，而沒有人說過他一定會被DQ？鄒答：「黃之鋒一定有講過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無在論壇直接提35不可能因費事搞禍人哋個場&quot;&gt;鄒稱無在論壇直接提35+不可能因費事「搞禍」人哋個場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒遂同意，於初選論壇提過35+的可能性「非常之低」，但「的確冇用呢個『不可能』嘅字眼」。萬質疑若鄒一直認為35+不可能，為何不直接在論壇說出，鄒說「因為我諗住有禮貌少少，即係個論壇始終都係由一班相信35+有可能嘅人搞嘅，費事去人個場，好似搞禍人哋個場咁，所以就講非常之低」，並指「如果睇返成個初選論壇嘅 transcript，應該唔會覺得我覺得35+有可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱與團隊較專注香港民族論述無看過戴耀廷文章&quot;&gt;鄒稱與團隊較專注「香港民族」論述、無看過戴耀廷文章&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於有否看過戴耀廷文章，鄒盤問下指當時較少留意時事，因準備選舉時與團隊較專注「香港民族」的論述、花較多時間製作單張。而他知道戴是知名政治人物，但案發時不知道他在《蘋果日報》和Facebook專頁撰文，沒有「like」戴Facebook，亦從沒讀過戴3至4月發表的文章，沒聽過戴談及有關「攬炒」的意思。控方追問沒有人告訴鄒？鄒說「真係冇」，指與團隊成員「傾香港民族比較多」，他與協調會議參與者亦「冇乜交流」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成早前承認與張可森和梁晃維發起「墨落無悔」聲明，今指4月時知道二人有興趣參與立法會選舉，遂「friend 搭 friend 咁樣見吓面、傾吓偈」，但初時無特別留意他們有否參加協調會議、無就此討論，只是「傾吓閒偈」，但在討論「墨落」的「嗰一刻」，「我肯定佢哋有出席過協調會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒否認戴耀廷首次會議介紹攬炒文章提運用否決權&quot;&gt;鄒否認戴耀廷首次會議介紹攬炒文章、提運用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新東協調會議情況，萬德豪引述趙家賢證供，問首次會議是否有一名本土抗爭派向戴耀廷表示，曾讀過他在《蘋果日報》的文章並支持其主張。鄒指首先他不認同當時已有「本土抗爭派」的概念，其次他無留意當時有與會者提及戴耀廷的文章。惟萬續追問該人發言取態、戴之後是否再介紹「攬炒」文章，鄒重申無聽到亦無印象有介紹，戴亦無提及會運用基本法權力否決預算案、以此作為籌碼與中共談判，亦無印象戴提及當選後任期或只有7個月。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱一直理解否決veto為投反對票vote-against&quot;&gt;鄒稱一直理解「否決（veto）」為「投反對票（vote against）」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就鄒稱於第二次會議動議「會運用」否決權，萬指鄒在協調會和在「墨落無悔」都用了「否決（veto）」，鄒同意中文是用「否決」。萬指，但「否決」只能在立會過半後達到？鄒說「否決呢個中文字對我嚟講，一直都係 vote against（投反對票）呢個意思，唔係得我一個咁諗嘅，前立法會議員都一直係咁樣形容」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬遂問，鄒曾否告訴公眾，「否決」不是指取得過半後否決議案？惟法官陳仲衡打斷，指如鄒家成一直認為兩字意思一樣，如何向公眾解釋，萬終指留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒重申預算案無回應五大訴求會反對墨落已向選民交代對財案立場&quot;&gt;鄒重申預算案無回應五大訴求會反對、「墨落」已向選民交代對財案立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就抗爭派記者會岑敖暉的發言，法官陳慶偉問及若今天仍「暴政當道、魔警橫行」，鄒家成會否不論內容仍否決預算案。鄒指最重要的核心是政府有否在預算案回應人民訴求，「如果有，我相信都唔會暴政當道、魔警橫行」。陳慶偉指那不是其問題，並重複問題，鄒指「咁要首先處理咩係暴政，咩係魔警」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指其問題非常直接，認為鄒不想答他問題，鄒說「唔係」。陳問那是否要就他問的每隻字下定義？鄒說「如果有疑問我會照問」。陳說所以鄒不明白他的問題，鄒說「問多一次，唔好意思」，陳指他已問了兩次，鄒續說「答案係不會」。陳說因此鄒完全明白他的問題，鄒稱「我想嘗試吓進一步……」，但遭法官陳仲衡打斷，再問如到了辯論預算案時，政府和警察仍與舉行抗爭派記者會時的一樣，鄒會否否決，鄒重申：「審視完財政預算案之後，如果入面都係冇同五大訴求相關嘅內容，我都係會投反對票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬其後問，鄒有否告訴選民他不同意岑敖暉的說話，鄒說沒有，並指「『墨落無悔』已經係其中一個地方話畀選民知道，我會點樣處理財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後就6月17日鄒家成與張可森和梁晃維受訪片段發問，並指片中顯示訪問問題，但無寫在謄本，望即場播片截圖。法官陳慶偉後下令休庭。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成稱倡「香港民族」並非港獨 指一國兩制下港人理應享自主權&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FUwsVuj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（9日）踏入審訊第102天。鄒家成繼續作供，就初選論壇提到「對抗中華民族嘅入侵」，鄒指民族是建基於文化、價值等形成的共同體，「中華民族」與「香港民族」有別，是合理化損害港人利益和干預港人自主權的宣傳工具，他宣揚「香港民族主義」旨在高舉族群利益。法官質疑鄒稱無推動港獨，但又提自主是有矛盾，鄒不同意，指港人在《中英聯合聲明》下除國防、外交，理應享有一系列自主權，惟在無落實雙普選下，一國兩制無真正落實過。鄒早前稱「香港民族」與港獨不同，法官李運騰今指鄒是否實際上推動港獨或屬爭議點之一，法官陳慶偉亦指明白兩者分別，但不代表不會考慮，鄒為了建立香港民族理念是意圖顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另就論壇提到議員應入議會「打交」，鄒指意指「自衛」，從無想過開會期間「主動冚佢（建制派）一巴」，「呢個太痴線喇」；至於用任何手段癱瘓每個會議，他只是望盡力阻止「惡法」通過，承認「誇張咗」。鄒又同意帖文故意以簡體字陳述「国安法」是表達反對，但無想過違法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱國安法後調整選舉文宣-刪香港民族殖民字眼&quot;&gt;鄒稱《國安法》後調整選舉文宣 刪「香港民族」、「殖民」字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成今第4日作供，鄒昨提及《國安法》頒布後曾考慮退出初選，但哽咽稱：「我發覺我根本就做唔出退選嘅決定，我覺得我無法離群眾而去。」鄒今甫開庭向代表大律師陳世傑表示：「唔好意思陳大狀，我琴日表現有啲失禮」，陳笑着叫他向法庭道歉，法官陳仲衡笑說記不起鄒有什麼失禮，陳慶偉亦笑說要喚醒記憶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續引鄒2020年7月5日發布的帖文〈對不起，我回來了〉，提及「如果我繼續原本嗰套主張，唔單止我，我嘅團隊成員，幫手派 leaflet 嘅義工，同埋幫我貼海報嘅黃店都一定會出事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指當時擔憂過往發表的言論會否有機會違反《國安法》，亦憂如果繼續參選，「被捕嘅未必只係我自己，而係我嘅團隊成員、我嘅義工等等，都可能受到牽連」，故當時除了調整選舉文宣、嘗試避免違反《國安法》，亦安排團隊成員聯絡義工表示：「如果你感到恐懼嘅話你就退出，我哋唔會介意嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱過去宣揚過係一個事實-但在肅殺環境下港人會知道為何調整&quot;&gt;鄒稱「過去宣揚過係一個事實」 但在肅殺環境下港人會知道為何調整&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，鄒提到「如果我繼續原本嗰套主張」，是提出假設、抑或實際放棄某些主張？鄒指是後者，並重申如他繼續派原有文宣「全部都有機會被捕」。李追問那除了口號，實質內容（substance）有否改變？鄒指有，指整套選舉文宣口號有更改，所有旗幟、易拉架、傳單亦全部重新印過，主要減少用一些對體制批評較尖銳的字眼，亦無再談及「香港民族」或「殖民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續指，但帖文最後提及「但相信我嘅理念喺過去已經表達得清清楚楚，亦都希望各位香港人會理解」，指鄒不是說會改變政綱，而是過去已表達清楚。鄒同意，表示「即係過咗去嘅嘢我都捉唔返㗎啦，過去宣揚過係一個事實，我改咗啲文宣係一個事實」，而「喺一個咁肅殺嘅環境底下，其實香港人會知道點解參選人會做呢啲調整」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱帖文故意用簡體字国安法-指表達反對但冇諗過違反國安法&quot;&gt;鄒稱帖文故意用簡體字「国安法」 指表達反對「但冇諗過違反《國安法》」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，理解鄒指推動「香港民族」不代表推動「香港獨立」，若這一直是其理念，為何帖文不解釋清楚他不是推動香港獨立。鄒解釋，因認為「香港民族主義」會被理解為分裂國家或港獨言論是來自部分人的「誤解」，而他於選舉如此提出主要是想「高舉族群利益」；而他與團隊當時思考繼續參選的意義，「我哋覺得係堅持埋最後呢十日左右嘅選舉嘅日子已經足夠喇，所以喺啲政治理念上面我哋唔想再解釋太多、講太多。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，留意到帖文全部用繁體字，只有在提及「国安法」時才用簡體字，問是否故意（deliberate），鄒答「係」，解釋因《國安法》經「附件三」立法，並非經立法會立法。惟李運騰質疑《基本法》也沒有經立法會立法，鄒停頓了一下續回應：「我唔鍾意用返繁體字去講《國安法》」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒在法官陳仲衡追問下，同意提及「国安法」可理解為抗議的標誌（sign），並指「我的確反對《國安法》」，當時其中一個繼續參選的意義亦是「表達一種反對《國安法》嘅聲音，但冇諗過違反《國安法》」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱中華民族是合理化損害港人利益宣傳工具香港民族與中華民族不同&quot;&gt;鄒稱「中華民族」是合理化損害港人利益宣傳工具、香港民族與中華民族不同&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就6月28日的新東初選論壇發問，就鄒提及「我諗我今次參選嘅目的非常之旗幟鮮明，我就係要宣揚香港民族主義，因為要建立一個民族出嚟，我哋先能夠對抗到中華民族嘅入侵」，陳仲衡問「中華民族嘅入侵」是否指中國共產黨，鄒否認，指「中華民族對我嚟講，係一個用嚟合理化損害港人利益、干預港人自主權嘅宣傳工具」，又指「我認為喺殖民統治之下，背後操控嘅人，正正就係擁抱中華民族思想嘅人，而呢種殖民嘅統治方式係會弱化一個民族嘅根基，所以我就喺選舉入面宣揚香港民族嘅理念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指他概念上有困難，問鄒是否認為「香港民族」作為一個族群（ethnic group），與「中華民族」是不同，鄒說：「我認為係嘅，因為一個民族係建基於語言、文化、價值、歷史、命運而形成嘅共同體，香港人喺歷史上面對於價值嘅追求……」，惟陳慶偉打斷，指不認為需要深究（“I don’t think we have to go into all these.”）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱港人理應享自主權-除非落實雙普選-否則一國兩制無真正落實&quot;&gt;鄒稱港人理應享自主權 除非落實雙普選 否則一國兩制無真正落實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，鄒一方面說並非推動港獨，但一方面又提到「自主權」，是否有矛盾（inconsistency）？鄒不同意，表示認為在《中英聯合聲明》和一國兩制下，「除咗國防同外交之外，香港人理應係享有一系列嘅自主權」，法庭傳譯一度未能譯出《中英聯合聲明》，被告欄的林卓廷即說：「Sino British Joint Declaration 呀！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，認為中國與香港之間的關係，基礎是建基於《中英聯合聲明》，而一國兩制是源於兩地族群的利益和所擁抱的價值均不同，因此認為「除非落實雙普選，否則一國兩制都冇真正落實過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官稱明白香港民族與港獨分別-但不代表不會考慮建香港民族概念屬意圖顛覆政權&quot;&gt;官稱明白香港民族與港獨分別 但不代表不會考慮建香港民族概念屬意圖顛覆政權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指鄒可能是對、可能是錯，法庭毋須判斷，但鄒同意《中英聯合聲明》只是由英國和中國政府決定，而非香港人決定嗎？鄒說「呢個亦都係好多香港人耿耿於懷嘅地方」，李運騰即打斷指可以問下一議題，並指被告到底是否實際上推動香港獨立，或是一個當前爭議的問題（live issue），問辯方是否需澄清。陳世傑續問鄒，香港獨立和自主權概念的分別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過陳慶偉打斷指認為已聽夠了，指辯方只是問同一問題，鄒家成亦只會重複答案，並指鄒已表示他不是提倡香港獨立、或香港應成為獨立的主權國（sovereign），只是認為一國兩制無按《中英聯合聲明》完全落實、香港無被給予完整的自主權；不過陳慶偉亦指，李運騰說法或許也有道理，因本案是控告被告意圖顛覆國家政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續補充，一如既往，無論控方或辯方證人的說法也不一定能當成真實（taken as face value）。而鄒早前稱「香港民族」與港獨「唔一樣」，陳慶偉指他們明白「香港獨立」和「香港民族」的分別，但與此同時，這不代表他們不會考慮，鄒為了建立香港民族理念，是意圖顛覆國家政權（“We are not saying that we would not take into the evidence that in order to build up the Hong Kong Ethnic idea, that he was intending to subvert the state power.”），指這是兩回事。陳世傑最後再問，鄒有否意圖提倡香港獨立，惟陳慶偉指鄒已答過他從無此意圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;稱擁護基本法同時指屬殖民工具-鄒如忽略現實考慮-信仰只淪為自我麻醉&quot;&gt;稱擁護《基本法》同時指屬「殖民工具」 鄒：如忽略現實考慮 信仰只淪為「自我麻醉」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒昨供稱擁護《基本法》，惟法官李運騰指，鄒論壇亦提及「一國兩制、基本法、立法會通通都係精心設計嘅殖民工具」，與其說法如何一致。鄒說「呢個有啲複雜嘅，等我用好簡單嘅方式講解吓」，續指擁護或效忠是從「信仰」的角度去看，「信仰能否強化，必須結合現實嘅考慮，如果忽略現實嘅考慮，你嘅信仰只會淪為一種自我麻醉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，人大釋法和不落實雙普選，是令一國兩制、基本法和立法會被視為殖民工具的「條件」，他反對這些條件，並認為要落實雙普選，一國兩制、基本法和立法會「先至能夠產生佢哋本身應該產生嘅功能」，又指「當我哋見到佢落實得唔完美嘅地方，再受到我哋信仰嘅驅使，我哋先會調整我哋當下嘅決定，令到自己嘅信仰得以實踐」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問是否支持想像中基本法-鄒支持本身應該要產生嘅功能&quot;&gt;官問是否支持想像中《基本法》 鄒：支持本身應該要產生嘅功能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即鄒支持一個不存在的、或只存在於其想像中的《基本法》（exists only in your imagination）？鄒回應：「我係支持佢本身應該要產生嘅功能。」陳慶偉說，或許不是想像，而是鄒的解讀（interpretation），並舉例不同人對聖經也有不同解讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續指，鄒論壇提及立法會仍是港人「覺得要維護嘅一個制度」，李運騰問，即鄒對立法會功能和工作有自己看法，並認為當時立法會無行使其正當功能？鄒表示，議會理應產生的功能是「普世」的，就是「制衡行政機關」，但他之所以說是殖民工具，「係因為佢嘅制度並不民主，行政機關亦都會用一啲唔公義嘅手段去阻止人參選」，並依賴立法會「去落實好多損害香港人利益同意願嘅政策、法案、議案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇稱不再讓泛民繼續主導話語權-鄒指2020年世代更替下望改變立法會格局&quot;&gt;論壇稱「不再讓泛民繼續主導話語權」 鄒指2020年世代更替下望改變立法會格局&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡關注，鄒提到想以議會制衡，但論壇亦提及「更加重要就係唔可以再畀泛民主派繼續主導呢個香港嘅話語權」。鄒解釋，話語權是透過立法會原本的「反抗格局」而形成，如立法會只有泛民主派一把聲音，「市民大眾就會接收到啲乜嘢嘅聲音。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，當時是針對議會內議政內容的數量及質素，指如只是審視一些「鎂光燈」下的議案和法案，再加上提出的私人草案或修正案不足，「話語內容就會變得單調乏味」，故他一直望選出最多抗爭意志的代議士，就是「希望透過改變原本立法會入面嘅反抗格局，從而產生一股更加強大制衡行政機關嘅力量」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，即鄒認為傳統泛民主派做得不好，想有人取代他們？鄒答「有好有唔好」，並指「我認為當時時代嘅改變，市民大眾要求立法會議員做得更多……」李打斷指，簡言之當時泛民並非代表主流聲音，鄒不同意，指正因覺得他們「代表緊好多市民嘅聲音」，才說他們主導香港的話語權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，但若大部分人支持傳統泛民，有什麼問題？鄒指：「2020年就出現緊呢個巨變」，簡單而言「係世代更替，經歷緊、演變緊、進化緊」。陳仲衡問，而鄒認為應由像他的人取代傳統泛民？鄒說：「我當然唔能夠取代，但我希望我係其中一把可以改變嘅聲音」，認為泛民「可以做得更好」，採取更主動的做法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱2020年dq性質由阻港獨聲音改為阻民主派取35&quot;&gt;鄒稱2020年DQ性質由阻港獨聲音、改為阻民主派取35+&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒論壇提到：「我諗DQ喺2016年嚟講，嗰條實嘅紅線就係香港獨立吖嘛，而家政權就係阻止緊香港獨立嘅聲音去進入呢個議會。但係到今日2020年，呢一個DQ，已經唔再係阻止異見嘅聲音，佢係阻止緊香港人奪權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒解釋，「奪權」是指「奪取議會控制權」，而據2016年選舉經驗，DQ紅線是主張「香港獨立」的參選人，但2020年DQ性質已改為「要阻止民主派攞35+」、所有參選人都可能會被DQ，「因為有DQ嘅存在，我哋唔會攞到35+㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇稱入議會打交-鄒指意指自衛&quot;&gt;論壇稱入議會「打交」 鄒指意指「自衛」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;除了組織者籌辦的初選論壇，鄒家成稱於7月初亦出席了由將軍澳居民舉辦的新東初選民間論壇。鄒的 Facebook 於7月7日發布該論壇片段節錄，提及鄒被問到「有冇做開運動？入到議會會唔會打交？入到去最想揪低邊個？」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並於論壇回答：「如果你話喺入面揀一個對手去揪低佢呢，咁我諗，所有嘅親中派，每一個都應該我要砌低佢嘅」，又指「入去會唔會打交，呢一個唔單止係我鄒家成要做嘅事，係每一個今日參選嘅代議士都應該要做嘅事」，而就算有無《國安法》和以言入罪，每個代議士都應有心理準備「用任何手段，癱瘓每一個議會嘅進行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒表示，「打交」是網民提問的用字，他的意思是「自衛」，當時腦海浮現陳志全被工聯會（郭偉強）使用暴力的畫面。李運騰指提問者顯然不是指「自衛」，鄒是迴避問題、不想得罪提問者？鄒指當時論壇講求「快問快答」，「真係冇咁多考慮」，而「打交」亦非他入議會的目的。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，帖文並非由他發布、是由團隊成員幫手，因該論壇「應該唔係咁多人睇」，他們想幫他「宣揚得遠少少」，印象中團隊發文前沒告知他，他翌日才知道。鄒又指，7月前所有 Facebook 帖文均由他或團隊另外一兩人幫手執筆，他全部知道亦同意，但7月起競選活動越來越多，故他很少處理 Facebook，當時亦無認為應移除帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇稱砌低每個親中派-鄒指望多方面取勝&quot;&gt;論壇稱「砌低」每個親中派 鄒指望多方面取勝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於鄒稱要「砌低」每一個親中派，鄒解釋在議會辯論上、甚至長遠而言，「我希望佢哋喺場選舉會輸，即係多方面都希望可以贏佢哋。」被問是否指肢體暴力，鄒說：「如果受到襲擊，咁當然都包括埋啦，但我真係從來冇諗過要開開吓會，去主動冚佢（建制派）一巴咁……呢個太痴線喇」，有被告和旁聽人士輕輕發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇提癱瘓每一個會議-鄒稱望盡力阻惡法通過認誇張咗&quot;&gt;論壇提「癱瘓每一個會議」 鄒稱望盡力阻惡法通過、認「誇張咗」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「用任何手段，癱瘓每一個議會嘅進行」，鄒指是口誤，應是「每一個會議」，並笑言「『癱瘓』呢度個意思係阻止個會議進行啫，呢度的確係誇張咗」，又指要「癱瘓」會議是「因為惡法嚟緊」，但不是指《國安法》，而是議會內政府想推動的「惡法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，但鄒是提到「每一個會議」，意思是政府提出的所有議案也是惡法（evil）？鄒指整句意思是對其他參選人表達一個「期望」，即就算有《國安法》，入到立法會也要盡力阻止惡法通過，又望他們有心理準備、做心理建設，每個會議也有機會面對這種情況。鄒並重申提及「任何手段」和「癱瘓」，「係真係誇張咗」，「只係想表達大家要盡力去做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟法官陳慶偉指，鄒家成此前稱立法會是應除去的殖民工具，認為鄒並沒有誇張，實是與其證供符合。鄒回應，「除去殖民工具」是指「反對立法會被視為殖民工具的條件」，主要指不民主的制度和不公義的政治操作；至於阻止惡法「係喺呢一個體制之下會做嘅事情」，兩者有分別。陳仲衡亦指，鄒回答時無提及「惡法」，鄒同意，但指當時面對「入去會唔會打交」的問題時，已預設了是因推動惡法而出現「打交」的混亂場合。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續表示，就論壇發問完畢，會問及抗爭派記者會，但關注「共謀者原則」的應用，望再審視相關內容。陳世傑申押至明日續審獲法官批准，並預計明天會完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭時，鄒家成向步出被告欄的施德來說：「好攰呀！」，並向前彎身。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（8日）踏入審訊第101天。鄒家成繼續作供，表示《國安法》頒布後曾考慮退出初選，因當時與團隊研究條文，判斷參選人最多只因過往言論有機會被捕，而他過往對體制及政府批評較「尖銳」，「香港民族主義」亦可能被扭曲成分裂國家和港獨言論，加上條文「涵蓋範圍好廣、字眼好模糊、刑罰好重」，如「盲人摸象」。惟鄒指他終決定繼續參加初選，庭上哽咽稱：「我發覺我根本就做唔出退選嘅決定，我覺得我無法離群眾而去」。鄒續指，當時與團隊重新尋覓參選的意義，認為「繼續參選本身就係一個意義」，他亦商討如何調整競選工程以繼續參選，遂更改選舉口號和單張，將口號由「拒絕殖民 民族抗暴」改為「抗擊暴政 捍衛尊嚴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就提名表格條款「擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特區」，鄒指他效忠的是理應能產生憲法應有功能的《基本法》，及「會受憲法約束」和「保障市民大眾權利」的政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方引鄒家成3人向組織者發訊息-鄒稱由團隊成員草擬&quot;&gt;辯方引鄒家成3人向組織者發訊息 鄒稱由團隊成員草擬&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成今第3天作供，辯方展示初選組織者 WhatsApp 群組訊息，顯示趙家賢於6月19日曾轉發署名為「抗爭派立場聲明書」發起人鄒家成、張可森和梁晃維，上款為「致初選籌組平台」的訊息，鄒指由張可森負責發出，由鄒其中一名團隊成員幫手草擬，他負責批准。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;該訊息提及3人發起聲明已逾一星期，共收到39位以上參與者以個人或政黨名義簽署，意味除民主黨、街工及社民連等外大部分人已簽署。聲明續提及「初選原設共同綱領，有意以『運用包括否決財政預算案之基本法賦予的立法會權力，迫使特首回應五大訴求。』的素人以及政黨因此共同目標而集結，期望以初選方式讓香港選民選出合適的代表披甲上陣。若無此共同綱領，恐怕初選只會淪為議席的『分餅機』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明又指，戴耀廷決定參與者毋須簽署共同綱領後，雖大部分參與者有簽署「墨落」重申堅定立場，但亦有原先出席協調會議的參與者明言杯葛初選。聲明又指協調會議的共識及「墨落無悔」亦包括認同若支持度不足須表明停止選舉工程，「這是否代表部分拒絕簽署聲明書的參選人可以無視我們早前的共識，甚至無視初選的結果？有見及此，希望初選主辦單位回應。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱如無法展現抗爭意志不如抽籤惟重申否決財案非協調共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱如無法展現抗爭意志「不如抽籤」、惟重申否決財案非協調共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成表示，當時着團隊成員按「墨落無悔」原文草擬一段訊息予初選籌組平台，告知他們有多少人已簽署，並就「墨落」的兩點聲明寫一些訊息，但無特別指明如何寫，「我由佢發揮然之後我再睇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續解釋訊息內容，指「墨落無悔」聲明運用否決權一點是想展現抗爭意志，「我哋認為如果無法向選民展現抗爭意志嘅話，呢個初選就失去一個意義，咁不如抽籤就算啦」，亦是上述恐怕初選只淪為議席「分餅機」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過法官李運騰關注，「初選原設共同綱領」一段似乎談及已達成共識的事項，鄒不同意，重申在新東並無就運用否決權達成共識；而「共同綱領」指協調會議上「原本傾過嘅嘢」，但不代表有達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱大黨不簽墨落令素人擔心參選無保障-望組織者提供保障&quot;&gt;鄒稱大黨不簽「墨落」令素人擔心參選無保障 望組織者提供保障&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於杯葛初選，鄒指記得當時新西協調會議，有街工的人想杯葛初選。法官陳慶偉問是否因街工認為不能否決有利草根的預算案？鄒說「應該唔係」，指爭議應是街工「好似係想輸咗初選都繼續選官方選舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問，訊息是否想向組織者表達應有簽署的協議？鄒不同意，解釋是想發訊息予初選籌組平台，通知他們發起了「墨落」，而較關鍵信息是「墨落」的第二點（「認同若支持度跌出各預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」），因當時不少政治素人擔心，部分大黨不簽署甚至公開批評「墨落無悔」，到底是因為運用否決權一點、抑或是因為第二點，即他們初選落敗仍想繼續參加官方選舉。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 2020年6月19日，街工舉行記者會宣佈有意參選立法會，6月29日發佈聲明改為表示不會參選。（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指這些素人擔心參加初選「好似冇一個保障」，因此發訊息望平台能保障其他參加者。鄒並同意，他與張可森和梁晃維均是政治素人，也有相同擔憂，惟最終組織者並沒有回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱簽署提名表格時無細心留意條款-理解目標為攞35&quot;&gt;鄒稱簽署提名表格時無細心留意條款 理解目標為「攞35+」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成確認，於6月20日提交初選提名表格。就表格第二段：「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，鄒指理解是新東協調會議達成的共識，亦沒有將「民主派35+公民投票計劃」理解為一份文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡追問那他簽署時如何理解，鄒笑指「其實我當時冇細心睇呢句句子，我諗住簽個名就參加初選」，又指「我有留意到有呢句嘢喺度嘅，但我冇細緻去逐粒字睇呢一句」。鄒後在法官追問下指，理解「目標」為「攞35+」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問提名表格是否對鄒家成回應-鄒稱無將擔憂與提名表格聯想埋一齊&quot;&gt;官問提名表格是否對鄒家成回應 鄒稱無將擔憂與提名表格「聯想埋一齊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續提到，鄒家成3人此前發訊息要求組織者保障政治素人的利益，擔心傳統政黨參選人食言、初選落敗仍參加正式選舉，而提名表格第二段，字面上似乎就是回應此關注，問鄒為何不要求組織者澄清該點的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/31U5jsX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 左起：張可森、鄒家成、梁晃維（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒先回應嚴格而言，他們「冇要求佢哋要做一啲嘢去保障我哋，其實只係問吓佢哋，其他人係咪真係想反悔呀咁樣嘅啫」，又指「當時真係冇諗過」問組織者，因覺得部分傳統泛民主派食言「其實都係佢哋嘅事，初選籌組平台其實都好難控制佢哋嘅」，訊息「純粹係表達擔憂嘅啫」。陳仲衡指，但訊息提到望組織者回應，鄒同意，「但係佢哋最後冇回應。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉指，鄒稱組織者沒有回應，但提名表格第二段可能就是組織者的回應，再問鄒有否問組織者究竟談及什麼「共識」？又指區諾軒提過，如有人問他「目標」的意思，他會指是「共同綱領」文件，並問鄒是否明白。鄒回應：「盡力去理解啦，我理解阿陳慶偉法官你啱啱講嘅嘢，只不過係有人問初選平台嘅人，佢哋就會答啦」，但鄒表示：「我冇將當時關於 WhatsApp 入面個擔憂，同呢個 nomination form 聯想埋一齊， 我的確冇呢個聯想。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，即使當時有這個「小擔憂」，即其他參選人落敗或仍繼續參加官方選舉，「其實我都係會繼續參加個初選㗎喇」，而即使他們真的這樣做，「已經係初選完結咗之後嘅事喇，既然係咁，不如到時再算啦」，只是6月中時他覺得要向組織者表達此擔憂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱效忠理應產生功能的基本法會受憲法約束及保障權利的政府&quot;&gt;鄒稱效忠理應產生功能的《基本法》、會受憲法約束及保障權利的政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於提名表格第6點「我特此聲明，我會擁護《基本法》和保證效忠香港特別行政區」，被問為何認同該點，鄒指《基本法》是香港的憲法，「憲法理應產生嘅功能係約束當權者嘅權力，同埋保障市民大眾嘅權利」，而他認為立法會議員所奉行的精神，與《基本法》理應要產生的功能是吻合，「我效忠嘅係會受憲法約束，同埋會保障市民大眾權利嘅政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，鄒有否區分《基本法》應該的說法，和實際上的說法（“… what the Basic Law should say or what the Basic Law in fact says”）？鄒指有。李再問，故鄒說擁護《基本法》，是擁護哪種《基本法》？鄒回答：「我覺得《基本法》喺香港嘅實踐係未如理想嘅。」惟陳仲衡即打斷，指問題並非《基本法》的實踐，又嚴厲指：「不要嘗試迴避問題，面對問題並回答，你有足夠的經驗知道你是否在回答我們的問題。（“You are experienced enough to know whether you are answering our question.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續回答：「我效忠一本，理應能夠產生憲法理應產生功能嘅《基本法》。擁護又好，效忠又好，我覺得係一個好私人嘅情感，同一個人嘅信仰係有密切嘅關係，你要強化一個信仰……」，惟陳慶偉打斷，指認為已聽夠了，指簡言之鄒是擁護他所相信的《基本法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱參選宣言無意圖顛覆政權-官稱帖文不證自明&quot;&gt;鄒稱參選宣言無意圖顛覆政權 官稱帖文不證自明&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就鄒家成 Facebook 帖文發問。就6月21日的〈繼承民族意志，掀起反殖浪潮——立法會新界東初選參選宣言〉，鄒解釋主要宣布會參加初選和交代政治理念。陳世傑問他想傳遞什麼訊息，惟法官陳慶偉指不認為需要問（go through that），認為帖文內容不證自明（self-explanatory）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問及「生於九七主權移交之年，自我有記憶以來，就只係不斷見證住香港嘅沉淪同赤化」中「沉淪同赤化」的意思，鄒向法官表示：「法官閣下，我知道你哋未必想我好詳細咁樣解釋呢個參選宣言，我用一個好簡短嘅方式快快趣趣講咗佢好冇呀」，被告席傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉笑說他完全明白鄒的聲明，只是辯方大狀問及字詞意思，並指除非字詞是模糊，否則會按字面理解，又指基本上「赤化」就是指「一國一制」、「香港成為中國的一部分」、「香港受共產黨管治」，指「我們全都知道那是什麼意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問，那鄒在帖文中的用字，有沒有意圖顛覆香港或中國政府？鄒說：「不論係呢度用嘅赤化又好、殖民又好，撕破畫皮都好，都沒有呢個意圖。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示6月25日帖文〈我只係一個普通香港人〉，指鄒昨提及「攬炒」的意思，並問帖文「同殖民者設計嘅議會制度攬炒到底」一句中，「攬炒到底」的意思與鄒昨提到的有否分別？鄒說「冇分別，『攬炒』同我主張嘅議會抗爭，同剛才嗰篇嘅參選宣言入面嘅『撕破畫皮』，同埋『衝擊體制』一樣意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱國安法頒布後曾考慮退出初選-指字眼模糊刑罰重如盲人摸象&quot;&gt;鄒稱《國安法》頒布後曾考慮退出初選 指字眼模糊刑罰重如「盲人摸象」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後展示「35+計劃新東信息發布區」群組紀錄，顯示由6月24日設立，鄒家成同日加入，但於7月2日退出。被問為何退出，鄒指「因為《國安法》頒布之後，我諗過退出初選」，並指基本上是6月30日《國安法》頒布後已「諗緊呢件事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問鄒做了什麼，鄒說「交代少少個背景啦，可能有少少長」，陳問：「可以簡短嗎？」，庭上傳出笑聲，鄒說「盡力」。鄒續說，6月30日晚擺完最後一個街站後，他返回辦公室，與選舉團隊一起等待《國安法》條文，至晚上11時他們已立即看條文，「我哋研究過《國安法》條例，當時嘅判斷係，參選人最多只係因為過往嘅言論而有機會被捕。」陳世傑指這是鄒的恐懼，陳慶偉說或是鄒的印象，鄒說「可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，他其後與團隊研究過往發表的言論，覺得過往對於體制和政府的批評都「比較尖銳」，加上當時認為「香港民族主義」有機會被扭曲成「分裂國家」和「港獨」的言論，亦因覺得《國安法》「涵蓋範圍好廣、字眼好模糊、刑罰好重，情況如同盲人摸象」，「所以睇完之後，我一度考慮緊係咪要退出初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱發現根本做不出退選決定-我覺得我無法離群眾而去&quot;&gt;鄒稱發現根本做不出退選決定 「我覺得我無法離群眾而去」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問那他決定是？鄒家成說：「繼續參加初選。咁中間發生嘅嘢我唔詳細去講，主要就係處理完情緒之後，恢復咗思緒……」，說罷微微低頭沒有作聲。陳說：「你選擇繼續（“You decided to press on.”）」，鄒停頓一兩秒後抬頭，略哽咽說「係」，並清了兩下喉嚨。陳續問，而鄒7月2日退出群組時，仍在考慮是否繼續初選？鄒再略哽咽說：「當時考慮緊」，身旁的法庭傳譯主任遞上紙巾，鄒輕輕擦拭眼和鼻。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示7月5日〈對不起，我回來了〉，問是什麼帖文，鄒續哽咽說：「簡單嚟講，我喺考慮緊初選嘅時候，我發覺我根本就做唔出退選嘅決定，我覺得我無法離群眾而去」。鄒續說：「總之有一晚我就打電話比我團隊嘅成員，我就同佢講，不如繼續，咁佢就話『全部人都ready，爭你一個』，咁我就同佢講，咁你幫我 call 齊人，第二日開會，我今晚返屋企準備一下」，鄒說時聲線持續微微顫抖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱認為繼續參選本身就是意義-國安法後改用較溫和口號&quot;&gt;鄒稱認為繼續參選本身就是意義 《國安法》後改用較溫和口號&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續說，團隊其後開會，主要談及兩件事，他欲談及第一件事時，陳慶偉打斷稱不認為需深究，總之最後鄒決定繼續參選。陳世傑問，但鄒有否做什麼改善在《國安法》下的處境？鄒聲音開始平復：「我下一句就準備講喇，我哋重新尋覓繼續參選嘅意義啦，我哋認為繼續參選本身就係一個意義」，而第二項討論就是「如何調整個競選工程，繼續參選」，他們遂更改了選舉口號和調整一些選舉單張。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/8zNxgka.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 鄒家成（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒遂確認，他將口號由「拒絕殖民 民族抗暴」改為「抗擊暴政 捍衛尊嚴」，解釋想盡量避免用一些可能會被認為「好尖銳」、或「可能會被扭曲成會違反《國安法》」的字眼。陳世傑問是用較溫和（softer）的字眼？鄒說「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉說，認為「抗擊暴政」和「民族抗暴」意思大致一樣（more or less the same），但理解鄒是想要令口號變得更溫和（tone down），並問鄒何時決定改口號。鄒說7月5日〈對不起，我回來了〉的文章，可理解為「我正式決定繼續參選嘅一個時間點」，他亦是在當時更改口號。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後就該帖文發文，呈堂文件呈黑白，左上角寫有「Telegram」，法官李運騰一度稱該帖文在 Telegram 發布。鄒指左上角的「Telegram」字眼只代表「我開緊 Facebook 前一個 app，我用緊 Telegram」，而「眼前見到呢個 page 其實係 Facebook嚟嘅」。法官陳慶偉其後下令休庭，明續就該帖文發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成步入被告欄前，向旁聽親友說：「好渣呀真係！」，又笑說：「Sorry, unexpected.」，親友發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

The continued economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, China’s more insular nationalism, the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and widening U.S.-China strategic competition are shuffling U.S. and Chinese comparative advantages across the region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local attitudes toward the United States and China — and views of their respective strategic and economic roles in the region — are a vital component in this strategic competition. They constitute the metrics of soft power and influence and need to be considered when predicting where regional governments are likely to align on any given issue. But there are huge gaps in country-by-country opinion polling on these fronts, and there has been little rigorous analysis of the elite and public opinion polls that do exist. Instead, policymakers in Washington and regional capitals alike tend to make assumptions about Southeast Asian opinion using anecdotes or tiny elite samples, often from just a couple of countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper collates and weights available country-level polling data to provide a more rigorous assessment of elite and public opinion regarding the United States and China. To find comparable data across a range of polls, the analysis is limited to just three questions for both public and elite opinion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do the (elites/public) of this country have warmer feelings toward the United States or China?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which of the two do they consider the most important strategic power in the region?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which do they consider the most important economic power in the region?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these assessments is assigned a level of confidence — low, medium, or high — based on sample size, national representativeness, and volatility in the available polling. The table below shows the assessments that can be made with medium or high confidence. In all other cases, there has either been no polling or assessments can only be made with low confidence — meaning pronouncements that “Country X thinks Y” should be treated with skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ErMwqfj.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Southeast Asian Public and Elite Opinion toward the United States and China.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: P indicates public opinion, E indicates elite opinion. Source: Author’s analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each country section below details the available polling, along with a brief overview of the state of U.S. relations and a survey of relevant economic indicators to provide context for some of the polling data. In all cases, China is the leading trading partner (often by a very wide margin) and in many cases the leading investor. The United States is a significant provider of development assistance as defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but this pales in comparison to the trade and investment figures, as well as nontraditional loans and other forms of assistance. This economic imbalance is reflected in public and elite opinion that China is the leading economic power in the region — a finding shared in every country for which there is sufficient data, except the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reasonable to assume that in most of the countries for which there is insufficient data, publics and elites would identify China as the region’s leading economic power. But no such assumptions can be made about which nation they would deem the region’s leading strategic power or which they have warmer feelings toward. In the available data, Chinese economic influence is not correlated either positively or negatively with overall public and elite attitudes toward it, nor are public and elite feelings about China and the United States necessarily aligned. Of the three countries for which the data allows confident assessments, public and elite preferences for one power over the other only align in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Southeast Asia Program hopes to expand this research in the future with additional polling data and other indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;public-opinion&quot;&gt;PUBLIC OPINION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For public opinion polling, this white paper relies on a range of surveys conducted either by international organizations that cover a broad span of countries or country-specific public opinion survey institutions or think tanks. Both use nationally representative samples and are generally reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that most public opinion polls are country-specific limits their utility for cross-country assessments of attitudes toward the United States and China. The surveys ask different questions of respondents, many of which are rooted in specific cultural or linguistic contexts. This is why the analysis in this white paper is limited to just three broad questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/interactives/international-methodology/all-survey/all-country/all-year/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pew Global Attitudes survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled nationally representative samples of 1,003 adults in Malaysia and 1,001 in Singapore. The margin of error was 4 percentage points in Malaysia and 3.7 percentage points in Singapore. The 2019 Pew Global Attitudes survey polled a nationally representative sample of 1,035 adults in the Philippines with a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points. Findings from these surveys are treated with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2017/08/01/globally-people-point-to-isis-and-climate-change-as-leading-security-threats/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pew Global Attitudes survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled a nationally representative sample of 1,000 adults in Vietnam. The margin of error was 5.2 percentage points. Findings from this survey are treated with medium confidence because of their age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 &lt;a href=&quot;https://6389062.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6389062/Canva%20images/Democracy%20Perception%20Index%202023.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Democracy Perception Index&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled 1,053 online respondents from Indonesia, 1,054 from Malaysia, 1,057 from the Philippines, 1,007 from Singapore, 1,051 from Thailand, and 1,053 from Vietnam. The poll was commissioned by the Alliance of Democracies and conducted by Latana, which describes itself as “an AI-powered brand tracking solution.” The sample sizes in each country were large enough to be statistically rigorous, and results for each were weighted by age, gender, and education level. But as an online-only poll that reaches respondents using third-party news, shopping, sports, and gaming apps and websites, its samples are unlikely to be as representative as those from traditional pollsters. The poll likely overrepresents those who are wealthier, live in urban and suburban areas, and are the most online. In addition, Latana does not make clear whether the polling questions were asked in local languages or only in English, and the exact role of its machine-learning technologies in collecting and analyzing results is unclear. For these reasons, the findings from this survey are treated with medium confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://interactives.lowyinstitute.org/features/indonesia-poll-2021/topic/global-powers-and-leaders/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lowy Institute’s 2021 Indonesia Poll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; surveyed a nationally representative sample of 3,000 Indonesian adults across every province. The margin of error was 1.8 percentage points. Findings from the survey are treated with high confidence except where a plurality of respondents chose “don’t know,” in which case they are treated with medium confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://merdeka.org/v2/download/china-poll-2022-report/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Merdeka Center’s 2022 public opinion survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on perceptions toward China polled a nationally representative sample of 1,204 adults across all Malaysian states, with a margin of error of 2.9 percent. Findings from this survey are treated with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pulseasia.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MR4-UB2022-2-MR-on-Trust-in-Selected-Countries.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pulse Asia’s June 2022 survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on public trust in selected countries polled a nationally representative sample of 1,200 Filipino adults across all regions of the country, with a margin of error of 2.8 percent. Findings from this survey are treated with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sws.org.ph/downloads/media_release/pr20230207%20-%20The%202023%20SWS%20Survey%20Review.pdf#page=27&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;December 2022 SWS quarterly survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled a nationally representative sample of 1,200 Filipino adults across all regions of the country, with a margin of error of 2.8 percent. Findings from the survey are treated with high confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://egfound.org/2023/06/modeling-democracy-caught-in-the-middle/#Specific-Findings&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurasia Group Foundation’s 2023 survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; polled a nationally representative sample of 500 Singaporean adults and a sample of 500 Filipino adults representative of the online population in the country. Findings from this survey are treated with high confidence for Singapore, and medium confidence for the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion&quot;&gt;ELITE OPINION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to public opinion polling, elite opinion surveys center specifically on policy experts, academics, civil society representatives, business leaders, and in some cases, government officials. For elite opinion, this report relies mainly on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iseas.edu.sg/articles-commentaries/state-of-southeast-asia-survey/the-state-of-southeast-asia-2023-survey-report-2/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;State of Southeast Asia survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. ISEAS polls a mixture of academics, business leaders, civil society and media representatives, government officials, and personnel at international organizations. Its surveys are extremely valuable to policymakers and analysts of Southeast Asia, and they provide data points that cannot be found anywhere else. But as with any survey, it has its limitations and does not claim to be equally rigorous for every country in the region. To the contrary, ISEAS presents its results as a reflection of elite opinion in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as an institution, rather than that of Southeast Asia as a region or of its constituent countries. It drives home that point by weighting each country’s responses not by population or number of respondents, but as 10 percent of the total, reflecting their coequal status within ASEAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 ISEAS survey included 1,308 individuals, down from 1,507 in 2022. The largest number of respondents, 208, came from Singapore, where ISEAS is based. The smallest number, 99, came from the Philippines. In all other cases, the number of respondents was over 100. The size of these response pools relative to each country’s population, and therefore the extent to which they are representative of each country’s elite, varies widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no agreed-upon standard for how large a response pool must be for an elite survey to be considered representative. And given the nature of elite surveys, it is impossible to create truly representative samples. But as one point of comparison, the East-West Center’s 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://asiamattersforamerica.org/uploads/publications/2022-Asia-Matters-for-America-Public-and-Elite-Opinion.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asia Matters for America survey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. government and business elites included 1,446 respondents, or 1 for every 230,000 Americans. For 2023, the ISEAS survey appears most representative of elite opinion in Brunei, where it surveyed roughly 1 out of every 4,000 residents, and Singapore, where it surveyed roughly 1 in every 30,000. Answers for these two countries are assigned a high confidence score in this white paper. After that, the ratio of respondents to population was about 1:75,000 in Laos, 1:125,000 in Cambodia, and 1:275,000 in Malaysia. These countries’ answers are assigned medium confidence scores except in cases of extreme year-over-year volatility, which reduces some to low confidence. Answers for the remainder of countries are assigned low confidence due to the small ratio of respondents to population, which was about 1:500,000 in Myanmar and Thailand, 1:740,000 in Vietnam, 1:1,200,000 in the Philippines, and 1:2,300,000 in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amadorresearchservices.com/publications/national-security-survey-2022%3A-results-%26-findings&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amador Research Services poll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Philippines included 1,249 respondents, mainly from academia and the military or security services, with a much smaller number from civilian government, business, and civil society. It surveyed roughly 1 in every 90,000 residents of the Philippines, for which it is assigned a medium confidence score. By combining this with the ISEAS 2023 and 2022 surveys (the latter having surveyed 1 in every 285,000 residents, warranting a medium confidence score), it is possible to assess with high confidence whether Philippine elites have warmer feelings toward the United States or China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CSIS Southeast Asia Program is aware of other elite opinion polling conducted in the region (e.g., the Foreign Policy Council of Indonesia’s annual ASEAN-China Survey) but none that ask comparable questions about both China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assessing-toss-ups&quot;&gt;ASSESSING TOSS-UPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This white paper determines public opinion on each question to be a “toss-up” if the findings are within the margin of error. Since elite polls do not have margins of error, toss-ups are assessed if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the results for the United States and China on a given question are within 5 percentage points;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;different polling questions touching on the same issue provide contradictory answers; and/or&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;responses to a specific question alternate between the United States and China in consecutive years. Responses that alternate in consecutive years between one power and a toss-up are still assessed to favor that power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For trade statistics, this report relies on the UN Comtrade Database. Where discrepancies exist between reported import and export flows between the United States, China, and Southeast Asian countries, this report relies on the figures reported by Southeast Asian countries; this not only allows for a common base from which the authors can assess Washington and Beijing’s trade engagement with a country relative to its overall trade balance, but one rooted in Southeast Asian economies’ perspectives. Meanwhile, for statistics related to foreign capital investment and aid, this report relies on the Lowy Institute’s Asia Power Index and Southeast Asia Aid Map, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brunei&quot;&gt;Brunei&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States’ ties to Brunei are underdeveloped, but the sultanate is a key partner in regional diplomacy and economic affairs; the 2021 Myanmar coup took place during Brunei’s chairmanship of the ASEAN, whose initial approach to the crisis was shaped by Bruneian interlocutors. In terms of economic affairs, Brunei remains forward-leaning on trade issues: It was a party to the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (P4) agreement that eventually expanded into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), is now a signatory to both the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and is participating in negotiations on the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/g0qwJXW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no rigorous public opinion polling of Bruneian views on the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion-1&quot;&gt;Elite Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MS1DCIC.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elite opinion surveys conducted by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore suggest an ongoing shift in Bruneian views among government, business, media, and academic experts toward power dynamics in the region. When asked about a hypothetical scenario in which the region was forced to align with one of the two strategic rivals, a slim majority of Bruneian respondents in the 2023 survey, 55 percent, selected China over the United States. This is down from 64.2 percent in 2022 — but the Bruneian sample size of 53 respondents in the 2022 survey was problematically small and should be treated with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a crosscutting piece of evidence, Bruneian elites in the ISEAS survey evinced more negative feelings about China than the United States. In 2023, 21.7 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a steep fall from the (again, to be treated skeptically) 67.9 percent who responded this way in 2022. Only 13.3 percent of respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to the 50.9 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruneian elite opinion is much clearer when it comes to which power has more influence in the region. Just 13 percent of respondents in 2023 identified the United States as holding the most political and strategic influence in the region, down from 34 percent the previous year. By contrast, 45 percent of respondents identified China as the primary political and strategic power in Southeast Asia, up from 39.6 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISEAS survey respondents were even more lopsided on economic issues. About 44 percent of Bruneian respondents viewed China as the most influential economic power in the region, though this is way down from 85 percent in 2022. By contrast, less than 7 percent identified the United States as the most economically influential in 2023, up from the 2 percent who said so in 2022. These sentiments accurately reflect China’s outsized role in Brunei’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 120 Bruneian individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to just 53 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-1&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the UN Comtrade Database, trade in goods between Brunei and the United States amounted to $230 million in 202l, or just 1 percent of Brunei’s trade volume that year. This was down from $359 million in 2019 and $373 million in 2020. Meanwhile, China’s trade with Brunei stood at $2.8 billion in 2021, or approximately 14 percent of the sultanate’s total trade that year. This is a sharp increase from $1.1 billion in 2019 and $1.75 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is also Brunei’s most important source of foreign direct investment, according to the Lowy Institute’s Asia Power Index, accounting for an astounding 94 percent of the country’s inbound foreign capital investment between 2012 and 2021. By contrast, the United States accounted for only 1 percent of all foreign capital investment into Brunei over that period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brunei does not currently receive Official Development Assistance (ODA) from the United States, as categorized by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD. China does not provide ODA in the traditional sense but does offer loans and other assistance that may be interpreted as aid by recipient governments and publics. According to the Lowy Institute’s Southeast Asia Aid Map, between 2015 and 2021 China spent and committed $1.08 million in assistance to Brunei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cambodia&quot;&gt;Cambodia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cambodia and the United States have maintained a strained, often tense relationship in the decade since Prime Minister Hun Sen cracked down on political opposition, independent media, and organized labor in the country. The deteriorating state of human rights and democracy in Cambodia, exemplified by opposition figure Kem Sokha’s recent sentencing to 27 years’ house arrest under spurious charges of treason and the banning of the opposition Candlelight Party ahead of national elections, complicate Washington’s efforts to forge closer ties with Phnom Penh. And while the United States should continue to emphasize human rights concerns in its engagement with Cambodia, it also should constructively engage with Cambodian leadership, not least because of the kingdom’s growing political and economic reliance on China. This reliance — and the perception that Cambodia has irrevocably aligned itself with China — masks the fact that Phnom Penh still sees significant value in enhancing ties with Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no rigorous public opinion polling of Cambodian views on the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion-2&quot;&gt;Elite Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1R67Lkc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute’s 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey provides a window into the thinking of at least some Cambodian elites. Surprisingly, 73 percent of Cambodian respondents selected the United States when forced to choose between one or the other great power. This was one of the highest levels of elite support for the United States among the countries surveyed by ISEAS — and a complete reversal from 2022, when only 18.5 percent of Cambodian respondents chose the United States. Such a huge swing in opinion needs to be taken with an equally large measure of caution. Rather than signaling a radical shift in worldview within Phnom Penh’s elite circles, it seems more likely that respondents are treating the question as a barometer for their feelings about recent events, such as Hun Sen’s 2022 visit to Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 18.6 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a slight increase from the 17.2 percent who responded this way in 2022. In contrast, among Cambodian elites in 2023, only 9.7 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to the 28.4 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other responses to the ISEAS survey were more consistent over time and therefore seem more illuminating. A meager 17.9 percent of elites surveyed in the 2023 survey identified the United States as the most important political and security power in the region, compared to 17.3 percent in 2022. This stands in contrast to the 72.4 and 75.3 percent of elites who identified China as the most significant political and security power in 2023 and 2022, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, 75.4 percent of Cambodian respondents identified China as the predominant economic power in Southeast Asia. This was the largest share of any country in the region and reflects Cambodia’s growing economic dependence on China. This figure represents a slight dip from 84 percent in 2022 but still far surpasses the percentage of respondents who believe the United States is the predominant economic power in the region (2.2 percent and 4.9 percent in 2023 and 2022, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 133 Cambodian individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 80 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-2&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary U.S. economic weakness in Cambodia is investment — not trade, where it remains competitive. Trade in goods between Cambodia and the United States amounted to $7.8 billion in 202l, or 17 percent of Cambodia’s trade volume that year. This is a substantial increase from $4.7 billion in 2019 and $5.6 billion in 2020. China’s trade with Cambodia stood at $11.2 billion in 2021, or approximately 24 percent of the kingdom’s total trade. This is up from $8.6 billion in 2019 and $8.2 billion in 2020. But the directionality of Cambodia-U.S. and Cambodia-China trade is reversed. An overwhelming majority of Cambodia-U.S. trade — $7.5 billion out of $7.8 billion in 2021 — consists of Cambodian exports to the United States. By contrast, Cambodia exported just $1.5 billion in goods to China in 2021 while importing $9.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2012 and 2021, U.S. foreign capital investment into Cambodia amounted to just 5 percent of the country’s inbound foreign investment. China accounted for 24 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $912 million and committed $1.04 billion in assistance to Cambodia between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $4.27 billion and committed approximately $6.25 billion in assistance to Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indonesia&quot;&gt;Indonesia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guided by its longstanding “free and active” foreign policy and history of nonalignment, Indonesia has sought to maintain balance in its relations with Washington and Beijing. While the presidency of Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has seen significant developments in Sino-Indonesian cooperation, primarily due to congruity between the president’s development and infrastructure agenda and Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, Indonesia has also boosted security ties with the United States and its allies. This includes Indonesia’s participation in the Garuda Shield exercises, which expanded last year to the Super Garuda Shield, now “one of the biggest joint, multinational exercises in the Indo-Pacific region.” Yet while the Indonesian public is more inclined toward the United States than China, Indonesian strategic elites appear more divided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;public-opinion-3&quot;&gt;Public Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nsXtnh1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lowy Institute’s Indonesia Poll 2021, a nationally representative survey of Indonesian public opinion, demonstrates a modest preference for the United States among the public. Only 42 percent of respondents trusted China to act responsibly in the world, a decline of 18 points since 2011, while approximately 56 percent signaled that they trust the United States, a decline of 16 points over the past decade. However, the surveys were taken 12 years apart, so there have probably been a lot of ups and downs not captured in those numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has risen to the top of the Indonesian public’s threat perception, with 49 percent of respondents believing that China poses a threat to Indonesia over the next 10 years. And when asked to rank perceptions toward countries on a “feelings thermometer” scale ranging from 0 degrees (coldest feelings) to 100 degrees (warmest feelings), Indonesian respondents ranked the United States at 60 degrees and China at 53 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked which country will be the leading military power in Asia in 20 years, 36 percent of Indonesians identified the United States, down from 58 percent in 2011. Just 22 percent expected China to be the region’s leading military power, largely unchanged from 25 percent in 2011. Those who lost confidence regarding the United States moved to the “don’t know/refused” category, which accounted for 36 percent of responses, up from 11 percent in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quarter of Indonesian respondents in 2021 expected the United States to be the leading economic power in Asia in 20 years, basically the same as the 23 percent who answered this way in 2011. Slightly more, 31 percent in 2021, expected China to be the leading economic power in 20 years, which is significantly less than the 52 percent in 2011. As with the question about military power, the number of Indonesians saying they don’t know which country will be the leading economic power leapt, reaching 36 percent in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to military and economic power, the Indonesian public seems to give a slight edge to the United States and China, respectively. But a plurality in both cases is unsure. This suggests that the balance of public opinion on either question could change; in fact, it may have already in the year and a half since Lowy conducted its last poll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other recent poll of Indonesian public opinion on China and the United States appears to be the 2023 Democracy Perceptions Index, conducted by Latana on behalf of the Alliance of Democracies. This online-only, artificial intelligence-driven poll is not as rigorous or representative as Lowy’s but provides useful data points. Respondents were evenly split, with 27 percent holding a positive view of the United States and 24 percent a negative view, for a net approval of +3 percentage points. In comparison, 27 percent held a positive view of China and 22 percent a negative view, for a net approval of +5 percentage points. This difference is within the margin of error, and nearly half of respondents held a neutral view or had no opinion about each power, making it a toss-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion-3&quot;&gt;Elite Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EaQFdH7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opinions of the Indonesian elites surveyed by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute are ambiguous and sometimes contradictory. They provide useful data points, but the sample sizes involved are not sufficient to assess Indonesian elite opinion with confidence. The 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey found that if forced to choose between major powers, only 46 percent of Indonesian respondents would side with the United States, down from 56 percent the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the same Indonesian elites evinced stronger negative feelings toward China than the United States. Approximately 57.8 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a slight rise from the 51.1 percent who responded this way in 2022. Meanwhile, 50.4 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” a difficult-to-explain swing from the 29.8 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 35.5 percent of surveyed elites identified the United States as the most important political and security power in the region, effectively unchanged from 35.1 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, 29.8 percent of elites surveyed in 2023 identified China as the region’s primary political and security power, a fall from the 38.2 percent who responded this way in 2022. The narrow margins and year-over-year reversal of fortunes suggest these should be treated as a toss-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly 71.1 percent of Indonesian strategic elites surveyed by ISEAS in 2023 identified China as the most influential economic power in Southeast Asia (up from 67.9 percent in 2022), with only 5 percent selecting the United States (down from 8.4 percent in 2022). This is an accurate reflection of their respective levels of economic engagement in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 120 Indonesian individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 130 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-3&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Indonesia and the United States amounted to $37.1 billion in 2021, or 9 percent of Indonesia’s trade volume that year. This reflects a boost in trade flows between the United States and Indonesia, up from $27.2 billion in 2019 and $27.3 billion in 2020. But China’s trade with Indonesia, at $110 billion in 2021, was triple that of the United States and accounted for approximately 26 percent of Indonesia’s total trade. China-Indonesia trade rose sharply since the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, up from $72.9 billion in 2019 and $71.4 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States also lags far behind China on the investment front. Between 2012 and 2021, the United States provided foreign direct investment amounting to 8 percent of all of Indonesia’s inbound foreign investment. China more than doubled that, accounting for approximately 20 percent of inbound investment in that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $1.89 billion and committed $1.42 billion in assistance to Indonesia between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $15.1 billion and committed a whopping $18.2 billion in assistance to Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;laos&quot;&gt;Laos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Laos relations are underdeveloped, although Vientiane is an active player in both ASEAN and the latticework of Mekong-related subregional arrangements, including the Mekong-U.S. Partnership. Its proximity and economic exposure to China has led to assumptions that Laos is closely aligned with Beijing. This perception is heightened by Laos’s debt crisis, which is driven mainly by loans from China and gives Beijing enormous leverage over Vientiane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OaLxkas.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be no rigorous public opinion polling of Lao views on the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion-4&quot;&gt;Elite Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ieeXnWk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISEAS 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey found that 59 percent of Lao respondents would favor the United States if forced to choose between the two major powers. This is a significant reversal from 2022, when only 18 percent responded this way. The scale of this shift warrants skepticism, especially because the size of the Lao response pool in 2022 was problematically small and more than doubled between the two surveys. It might indicate the directionality of a shift in Lao elite feelings about China or the United States but should not be taken at face value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to negative perceptions, 16.8 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a significant drop from the 40.9 percent who responded this way in 2022. Only 5.6 percent of Lao respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 50 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 13.1 percent of elites surveyed in 2023 identified the United States as the most important political and security power in the region, a slight increase from 9.1 in 2022. This stands in contrast to the 30.8 percent of respondents who believed that China is the most important political and security power, a steep decline from the 75 percent who responded this way in 2022. This nearly 45-point swing warrants caution, but the gap between the responses for China and the United States remains large enough to say with some confidence that Lao elites view China as the predominant strategic power in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 20.6 percent of Lao respondents identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, an immense drop from 86 percent in 2022. The enormity of this change is highly suspicious, especially given China’s continued economic dominance in Laos. Rather than an honest assessment of China’s economic power, respondents may have been signaling their growing unease with the degree of Vientiane’s dependency on Beijing amid the debt crisis. In terms of Lao views of U.S. economic influence, only 5.6 percent of respondents believed that the United States is the region’s predominant economic power, up slightly from 4.5 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 107 Lao individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 43 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-4&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Laos and the United States amounted to only $334 million in 2021, or 3 percent of Laos’s trade volume that year. This is a significant improvement from $108 million in 2019 and $155 million in 2020. But it is less than a tenth of China’s trade with Laos, which stood at $3.6 billion, or 27 percent of Laos’s total trade, in 2021. Trade volume between China and Laos that year narrowly exceeded its 2019 total of $3.4 billion after having fallen to $2.8 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is nearly as dominant on the investment front. It accounted for 25 percent of Laos’s inbound foreign capital investment between 2012 and 2021. The United States provided only 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $366 million and committed $427 million in assistance to Laos between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $6.48 billion and committed $8.08 billion in assistance to Laos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;malaysia&quot;&gt;Malaysia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S.-Malaysia cooperation remains robust, but domestic political instability and successive changes in government have impaired Washington’s ability to forge deeper ties with Putrajaya. Defense cooperation has become routinized, including through the Keris Strike and Bersama Warrior exercises, and economic cooperation remains a key area of opportunity, including through Malaysia’s participation in IPEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PmH6FTR.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although views toward China have declined worldwide, nationally representative surveys conducted by Pew demonstrate that the Malaysian public generally favors China over the United States. Approximately 60 percent of Malaysian respondents in 2022 held favorable views toward China, compared to 44 percent who held favorable views toward the United States. And 62 percent of Malaysian respondents trusted Xi Jinping to “do the right thing regarding world affairs,” compared to 53 percent for Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Merdeka Center’s 2022 survey of Malaysian public opinion toward China found that approximately 39 percent of respondents viewed China favorably, compared to 45 percent with a neutral impression of China, and just 12 percent with a negative impression. Moreover, approximately 70 percent of respondents perceived the current relationship between China and Malaysia to be “good,” a slight increase from the 67 percent who responded this way in 2016. The Merdeka Center has not conducted recent public opinion polling of Malaysian attitudes toward the United States, but these results provide greater confidence in Pew’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2023 Democracy Perception Index, Malaysians were more evenly split. This poll found that 37 percent of Malaysian respondents held a positive view of the United States and 25 percent held a negative view, for a net approval of +11 percentage points. By comparison, 39 percent held a positive view of China and 26 percent a negative view, for a net approval of +14 percentage points. The difference is within the poll’s margin of error, making it a toss-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/AUEzl6k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When forced to choose between the United States and China in the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 54.8 percent of Malaysian strategic elites selected China and 45.2 percent selected the United States. This is an inversion of 2022, when 43 percent selected China and 57 percent selected the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States does moderately better when it comes to negative perceptions. Approximately 48.4 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, a slight decrease from the 51.1 percent who responded this way in 2022. In contrast, 38.7 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 34.1 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slim plurality of Malaysian respondents in 2023, 35.5 percent, believed that China is the predominant political and strategic power in the region, while 33.9 percent believed the same for the United States. This represents a decline for China from 51.1 percent in 2022 and an increase for the United States from 24.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 65.3 percent of Malaysian respondents believed China is the predominant economic power in the region, down from 72.6 percent in 2022. In contrast, just 13.7 percent of respondents believed the United States is the primary economic power in Southeast Asia, up slightly from 11.9 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 124 Malaysian individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 135 Malaysian respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-5&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China nearly doubles the United States in both trade and investment flows in Malaysia. Trade in goods between Malaysia and the United States amounted to $52.4 billion in 2021, or 10 percent of Malaysia’s total trade volume that year. This reflects a general upward trend in recent years, with trade up from $39.9 billion in 2019 and $42.6 billion in 2020. China’s trade with Malaysia stood at $101.6 billion in 2021, or approximately 19 percent of Malaysia’s total trade that year. That is a substantial increase from $76.4 billion in 2019 and $78.8 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of foreign direct investment, the United States accounted for approximately 15 percent of Malaysia’s inbound foreign investment between 2012 and 2021, while China accounted for 29 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $57.7 million and committed $79.1 million in assistance to Malaysia between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $4.96 billion and committed $17.1 billion in assistance to Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;myanmar&quot;&gt;Myanmar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. ties with the military junta in Myanmar have been all but nonexistent since the February 2021 coup. The United States has frequent informal engagements with the opposition National Unity Government (NUG) but limited contact with the various ethnic armed organizations and Peoples’ Defense Forces that make up the bulk of the country’s resistance forces. The junta has turned toward China — along with India, Russia, and a few others — in the face of isolation by the wider international community. China also maintains informal contacts with the NUG and some ethnic armed organizations, though probably with limited ability to reverse widespread anti-China narratives among the opposition. These shifts mean that the generals in Naypyidaw have shifted decisively toward Beijing, while most of the opposition likely prefers the United States. But given the civil war, these assumptions are impossible to test rigorously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CRRzMxu.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There does not appear to be any rigorous public opinion polling of Myanmar views on the United States and China either before or since the coup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;elite-opinion-6&quot;&gt;Elite Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YtKzzvJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most elites polled by ISEAS in 2022 and 2023 were likely to have been either part of the civilian government ousted in 2021 or affiliated with media, academia, business, and nongovernmental organizations sympathetic to the opposition. They provide useful data points, but the sample sizes involved are not sufficient to assess Myanmar elite opinion with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When forced to choose between the United States and China in the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 67.8 percent of Myanmar respondents selected the United States, a fall from 92 percent in 2022. On this and all other Myanmar responses to the ISEAS survey, the opinions of broadly defined “elites” are likely very different from those of the narrower band of military, government, and business elites running the current junta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about their confidence in China’s ability to “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, about 80 percent of these respondents said they had little to no confidence, a slight decline from the 88.8 percent who responded this way in 2022. In contrast, approximately 30.5 percent of respondents stated that they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to the 11.5 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in terms of political and strategic significance, approximately 49.6 percent of Myanmar respondents believed the United States is the predominant political and strategic power in the region, up from 19.7 percent in 2022. This compares to 40 percent who believed China is the primary power, a precipitous drop from 70.9 percent in 2022. These huge swings seem to reflect a significant shift in the kinds of elites ISEAS surveyed. The Myanmar sample size in 2023 was less than a third of 2022’s, and it had a much larger proportion of businesspeople — 29 percent compared to just 3 percent — and a much smaller proportion of self-identified government officials — 26 percent compared to 45 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, given the scale of China’s economic engagement in Myanmar, 72 percent of respondents to the 2023 ISEAS survey identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, compared to only 14 percent for the United States. By contrast, in the 2022 ISEAS report, 83.4 percent of respondents selected China as the region’s primary economic power, with only 6 percent selecting the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 115 Myanmar individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 350 Myanmar respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-6&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Myanmar and the United States amounted to $799 million in 2021, or less than 3 percent of Myanmar’s trade volume that year. This figure is reflective of the overall collapse of U.S. engagement and the country’s economic tailspin since the coup. But trade flows were not that much larger before the coup — $1.2 billion in 2019 and $1.3 billion in 2020. China’s trade with Myanmar, by contrast, stood at $8.7 billion in 2021, or 29 percent of Myanmar’s total trade that year. This is a marked decline from $12.2 billion in 2019 and $11.9 billion in 2020 but shows that the junta remains reliant on China amid international isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with trade, China was a much larger investor in Myanmar before the coup and remains one today. Over the past 10 years, the United States has accounted for less than 4 percent of foreign direct investment into Myanmar, while China has accounted for more than 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $1.18 billion and committed $1.41 billion in assistance to Myanmar between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $2.23 billion and committed $10.9 billion in assistance to Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;philippines&quot;&gt;Philippines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all the United States’ Southeast Asian partners, the Philippines has received the most time and attention from Washington under the Biden administration. Political and security cooperation with the United States has grown during the first year of the Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. government, resulting in the recent expansion of the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, as well as more serious thinking in Manila on how to better network with the broader web of U.S. alliances in the region. Major shifts in U.S.-Philippines relations reflect not only longstanding support for the alliance among strategic elites and the public, but also growing anxieties about China and its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;public-opinion-7&quot;&gt;Public Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ncWkfWv.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public opinion polling conducted by PulseAsia in June 2022 found that 89 percent of respondents evinced either a “great deal” or a “fair amount” of trust in the United States. This represents an upward shift of 5 percentage points from the last time Pulse Asia conducted this survey in September 2019. By contrast, only 33 percent of respondents expressed trust in China, a slight increase from 25 percent in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results are largely consistent with public opinion polling conducted in December 2022 by Social Weather Stations (SWS). The SWS survey found that the Filipino public broadly trusts the United States, which holds a net trust score of +74 percentage points, calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents selecting “little trust” from the percentage selecting “much trust.” These results mirror SWS’s past findings, with the United States not having dipped below +55 net percentage points since the start of the Benigno Aquino III administration in 2010. By contrast, China’s net trust score was -6 percentage points, a slight rise from recent years but still significantly lower than that of other regional partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results in turn echo surveys conducted by Pew on Filipino attitudes toward the United States and China. Pew’s 2019 Global Attitudes Survey, the last to ask Filipinos about their opinions and which surveyed 1,035 Filipinos from May–June 2019, found that 80 percent of Filipino respondents held a favorable opinion of the United States, compared to the 42 percent who held a favorable opinion of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Democracy Perception Index found a similar preference for the United States among Filipino respondents. In that poll, 67 percent of Filipinos held a positive view of the United States and just 5 percent negative, for a net approval of +61 percentage points. In contrast, 31 percent each held positive and negative views of China, for a net approval of 0 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the Eurasia Group Foundation’s 2023 Caught in the Middle: Views of US-China Competition Across Asia report found that, across a survey of 500 Filipino respondents representative of the online population in the Philippines, approximately 81.6 percent of respondents held a positive view of the United States, compared to the 18.4 percent who held a negative view. This stands in stark contrast to the 30.2 percent of Filipino respondents who held a positive view of China and the 69.8 percent of respondents who held a negative view. Approximately 64 percent of respondents who held negative views of China attribute this sentiment to Beijing’s military destabilization of the region. When asked to consider the impact of U.S.-Philippine military cooperation, 85 percent of respondents believed that such cooperation has had a positive impact, compared to 33.5 percent of respondents who believed that China-Philippines military cooperation has had a positive impact. In terms of diplomatic influence — interpreted here as being akin to strategic influence — 49 percent of Filipino respondents believe that the United States holds the most influence, compared to 22 percent of respondents who selected China. While a plurality of Filipino respondents selected ASEAN as the region’s predominant economic power, approximately 24 percent of respondents selected the United States, while roughly 20 percent selected China, assessed here as a “toss-up.” The report also found that, when aggregating the mean score of four soft power variables to form an overall soft power measurement, the United States scored 10.3 out of a 1–16-point scale in the eyes of Filipino respondents, compared to 6.4 for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CvxSrZo.png&quot; alt=&quot;image15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elite polling by ISEAS in the Philippines provides useful data points, but the sample size involved in 2023 is not sufficient to assess Filipino elite opinion with confidence. Comparing its findings to other elite surveys with larger sample sizes, however, allows a confident assessment of the topline question of whether Filipino elites have warmer feelings toward the United States or China. When forced to choose between the two in the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 78.8 percent of Filipino respondents selected the United States, a slight fall from 83.5 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about their confidence in China’s ability to “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, approximately 62.7 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence, a drop from the 82 percent who responded this way in 2022. Meanwhile, among Filipino elites in 2023, only 20.2 percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” roughly on par with the 22 percent who responded this way in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A survey of approximately 1,200 Filipino strategic elites — including policy experts, uniformed personnel, and academics — conducted by Amador Research Services in November and December 2022 provides greater confidence to the finding that Filipino elites prefer the United States to China. Asked with which countries the Philippines should strengthen partnerships, 69 percent of respondents said the United States, compared to just 39 percent for China. This survey represents a much larger number of elites but is more heavily weighted toward academia (44 percent of respondents) and the military (38 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plurality of Filipino respondents to the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 44.4 percent, identified the United States as the primary political and strategic power in the region, down slightly from 51 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, about 30.3 percent of respondents believed China is the predominant strategic power in the region, down from 37 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a plurality of 36.4 percent of Filipino respondents identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, a significant drop from the 65.8 percent who answered this way in 2022. The size of this swing should be treated with a high degree of skepticism, especially because the number of Filipino respondents to the ISEAS survey plummeted by more than 75 percent in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 99 Filipino individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 400 Filipino respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-7&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between the Philippines and the United States amounted to $20.1 billion in 2021, or 10 percent of the Philippines’ trade volume. This represents a return to pre–Covid-19 levels, which stood at $20.1 billion in 2019 before dipping to $17.4 billion in 2020. But China’s trade with the Philippines is nearly double that of the United States. It reached $39.7 billion, or about 20 percent of the Philippines’ total trade, in 2021. This surpasses the $36.6 billion in bilateral trade in 2019, after which there was a sharp drop to $31.8 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States is more competitive with China on foreign direct investment in the Philippines than in most of the rest of the region, though it still lags. The United States provided 15 percent of the Philippines’ inbound foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, compared to 22 percent provided by China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $1.40 billion and committed $1.27 billion in assistance to the Philippines between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent only $262 million in assistance to the Philippines, a figure that pales against the $6.28 billion it committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;singapore&quot;&gt;Singapore&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not a formal treaty ally, Singapore is of critical importance to U.S. interests in the region. The city-state’s longstanding defense partnership with Washington is vital to U.S. forward presence, providing access, basing, and overflight privileges. Singapore has also played a leading role in shaping the region’s economic architecture, exemplified by its participation in the CPTPP and IPEF, in addition to its efforts to forge a web of digital economy agreements with partners worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;public-opinion-8&quot;&gt;Public Opinion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rm9WE0t.png&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While views toward China have slumped in much of the world, nationally representative surveys conducted by Pew demonstrate that the Singaporean public favors China over the United States. Approximately 67 percent of Singaporean respondents in 2022 held favorable views toward China, compared to 51 percent who held favorable views toward the United States. These findings are largely consistent with Pew’s data from 2021, in which approximately 64 percent of respondents held favorable views toward China and 51 percent held favorable views toward the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Pew Global Attitudes Survey also asked Singaporean respondents with which country it is most important for the city-state to have close economic relations. Respondents chose China more often than the United States (49 and 33 percent, respectively). Given the context, it is reasonable to treat this as analogous to asking which country Singaporeans see as the leading economic power now and in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2023 Democracy Perception Index, Singaporean respondents were more evenly split, but still favored China slightly. This survey found that 44 percent of Singaporeans held a positive view of the United States and 24 percent a negative view, for a net approval of +20 percentage points. A slightly higher 49 percent held a positive view of China and 20 percent held a negative one, for a net approval of +29 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the Eurasia Group Foundation’s 2023 Caught in the Middle: Views of US-China Competition Across Asia report found that, across a nationally representative survey of 500 Singaporean respondents, approximately 47.8 percent of respondents held a positive view of the United States, compared to 52.2 percent who held a negative view. This falls short of the 55.7 percent of Singaporean respondents who held a positive view of China and the 44.3 percent of respondents who held a negative view. When asked to consider the impact of U.S.-Singapore military cooperation, 81.7 percent of respondents believed that such cooperation has had a positive impact, compared to 71.9 percent of respondents who believed that China-Singapore military cooperation has had a positive impact. In terms of diplomatic influence — interpreted here as being akin to strategic influence — 42 percent of Singaporean respondents believe that the United States holds the most influence, compared to 38 percent of respondents who selected China. Moreover, some 52 percent of Singaporean respondents also hold the view that China is the most influential economic power in Asia. The report also found that, when aggregating the mean score of four soft power variables to form an overall soft power measurement, the United States scored 7.7 out of a 1–16-point scale in the eyes of Singaporean respondents, compared to 7.9 for China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/gpfMAmz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image17&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singaporean elite opinion as reflected by the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey is markedly different than that of the public. Considering that ISEAS is a Singapore-based institute, its elite network in the city-state is probably its most robust, and the answers for Singapore therefore the most representative of any country in its dataset. About 61 percent of Singaporean respondents favored the United States if forced to choose between the two major powers, though this is down from 77.9 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, 56.3 percent said they had little to no confidence that China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, compared to the 69.8 percent who responded this way in 2022. In contrast, only 38.5 percent of respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 31.1 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of political and strategic importance, 33.2 percent of Singaporean respondents viewed China as the region’s primary political and strategic power, down from 48.2 percent in 2022. Approximately 48.1 percent of Singaporean respondents selected the United States as the region’s primary political and strategic power, up slightly from 46.8 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like their neighbors, most Singaporean elites view China as the primary economic power in Asia, with 70.7 percent of respondents to the State of Southeast Asia saying as much in 2023, down from 81.1 percent in 2022. This is in stark contrast to the mere 13.5 percent who selected the United States as the primary economic power in Asia, up slightly from 12.2 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 208 Singaporean individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 222 Singaporean respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-8&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States remains more competitive when it comes to trade with Singapore than it is in most of the region, but the gap is widening. U.S.-Singapore trade amounted to $79.8 billion in 2021, or 9 percent of the city-state’s total trade volume that year. That was largely unchanged from $78.3 billion in 2019 and $75.4 billion in 2020. Meanwhile, China’s trade with Singapore stood at $122.3 billion in 2021, or approximately 14 percent of the city-state’s total. That was up substantially from $100.7 billion in 2019 and $98.7 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the United States maintains a sizeable advantage when it comes to investment in Singapore, providing 27 percent of the country’s inbound foreign direct investment over the past 10 years. China provided just 11 percent during this timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore does not currently receive ODA from the United States as categorized by the OECD, nor does it seem to receive anything that might be considered aid from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thailand&quot;&gt;Thailand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Thailand is one of the United States’ five Indo-Pacific allies, the U.S.-Thailand relationship has stagnated in recent years, partially due to ongoing political instability following Thailand’s 2014 coup. Although cooperation at the operational level remains robust, Thailand receives less attention from the Biden administration than non-allies such as Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only recent public opinion polling of Thai views on the United States and China appears to be the Democracy Perception Index, which can only be treated with medium rather than high confidence for reasons explored in the methodology section. The 2023 survey found that 49 percent of Thai respondents held a positive view of the United States and just 9 percent held a negative one, for a net approval of +40 percentage points. By comparison, 49 percent held a positive view of China versus 18 percent negative, for a net approval of +22 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISEAS surveys of Thai elites provide useful data points, but the sample sizes involved are not sufficient to assess Thai elite opinion with confidence. A narrow majority of Thai respondents to the 2023 State of Southeast Asia poll, approximately 57 percent, picked the United States in a hypothetical scenario in which the region were forced to choose sides between the two powers, which is unchanged from 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked whether China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, 56.9 percent of Thai respondents said they had little to no confidence, up from 47.9 percent in 2022. In contrast, 34.7 percent of respondents in 2023 had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 26.5 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 45.8 percent of Thai respondents identified China as the region’s predominant political and strategic power, down from 55.6 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, only 36.1 percent selected the United States as the region’s predominant political and strategic power, though this is up from 27.4 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 74 percent of Thai respondents to the 2023 State of Southeast Asia poll identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, a slight rise from 69.2 percent in 2022. Meanwhile, only 9 percent of respondents selected the United States as the predominant economic power in the region, a slight fall from 13.7 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 114 Thai elites responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 91 Thai respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-9&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Thailand and the United States amounted to $55.8 billion in 2021, or 10 percent of Thailand’s trade volume that year. This was up from $45.8 billion in 2019 and $49.5 billion in 2020. China’s goods trade with Thailand was nearly twice as large, at $103 billion in 2021, or approximately 19 percent of Thailand’s total trade and nearly a quarter of its imports. This was up substantially from $73.9 billion in 2019 and $79.6 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States remains the larger investor in Thailand by a narrow margin. It provided over 13 percent of Thailand’s inbound foreign direct investment in the past decade, during which China accounted for approximately 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $374 million and committed $473 million in assistance to Thailand between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $2.27 billion and committed $21.6 billion in assistance to Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vietnam&quot;&gt;Vietnam&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam has been a focal point of U.S. diplomatic engagement during the Biden administration. Its status as a claimant in the South China Sea disputes and the harassment the country regularly faces at the hands of the China Coast Guard and its maritime militia have led Hanoi to take incremental steps to boost security cooperation with the United States. And Vietnam’s emergence as a hub for high-end manufacturing makes it an attractive destination for companies seeking to diversify away from reliance on China, meaning Hanoi will inevitably play a key role in the region’s increasingly complex economic architecture, including the Biden administration’s IPEF. While Vietnam maintains strong ties with China, particularly at the party level, historic animosity and current tensions limit the level of influence Beijing has over Hanoi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hx7oC7O.png&quot; alt=&quot;image20&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only recent public opinion polling of Vietnamese views on the United States and China appears to be the Democracy Perception Index, which can only be treated with medium rather than high confidence. The 2023 survey found that 70 percent of Vietnamese respondents held a positive view of the United States and just 5 percent held a negative one, for a net approval of +65 percentage points. Meanwhile, 35 percent held a positive view of China, compared to 25 percent negative, for a net approval of +12 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This echoes the older but more rigorous findings of the spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey, in which Pew found that about 80 percent of Vietnamese respondents identified China’s power and influence as a major threat to global peace and security, while only 21 percent said the same of the United States. This far surpassed the second most identified threat, climate change, which was selected by 61 percent of Vietnamese respondents. Vietnam was the only country polled in which China was identified as the top global threat, suggesting a unique and deep-seated antipathy. But without more recent polling, the Vietnamese public’s preference for the United States over China can only be assessed with medium confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fbSXwAz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image21&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISEAS surveys of Vietnamese elites provide useful data points, but the sample sizes involved are not sufficient to assess Vietnamese elite opinion with confidence. When forced to choose between the two major powers in the 2023 State of Southeast Asia survey, 77.9 percent of Vietnamese respondents selected the United States, an increase from 73.6 in 2022. This was second only to respondents from the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked whether China would “do the right thing” to contribute to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, 78.7 percent of Vietnamese respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence, up from the 64.6 percent in 2022. In contrast, only 19.8 percent of Vietnamese respondents in 2023 said they had little to no confidence in the United States to “do the right thing,” compared to 12.5 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, 55.2 percent of Vietnamese respondents identified China as the region’s predominant political and strategic power, up slightly from 52.8 percent in 2022. Only 27.2 percent of respondents in 2023 selected the United States as the region’s predominant political and strategic power, down from 32.6 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, 69 percent of Vietnamese respondents in 2023 identified China as the predominant economic power in the region, down slightly from 71.5 percent in 2022. Only 9.6 percent of respondents selected the United States as the predominant economic power in the region, a slight fall from 16.7 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximately 136 Vietnamese individuals responded to the ISEAS survey in 2023, compared to roughly 112 Vietnamese respondents in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-indicators-10&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC INDICATORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade in goods between Vietnam and the United States amounted to $111.5 billion in 2021, or approximately 17 percent of Vietnam’s trade volume that year. These trade flows are growing rapidly, up from $75.8 billion in 2019 and $90.8 billion in 2020. But they are also imbalanced, consisting of $96.3 billion of goods flowing from Vietnam to the United States, or 29 percent of Vietnam’s total exports, and $15.2 billion flowing the other direction, less than 5 percent of Vietnam’s imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s trade with Vietnam stood at $165.8 billion in 2021, or approximately 25 percent of the country’s total trade that year. It is not outpacing the United States in Vietnam as badly as it does in most of the region, but this trade is also growing rapidly, up from $117 billion in 2019 and $133 billion in 2020. And it is imbalanced in the other direction, with $55.9 billion in Vietnamese exports to China in 2021, accounting for 17 percent of Vietnam’s total export volume, and $109.9 billion in Chinese imports, or 33 percent of Vietnam’s total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two great powers are on par with each other when it comes to investment in Vietnam. Over the past decade, the United States was the source of approximately 7 percent of Vietnam’s inbound foreign direct investment, while China accounted for approximately 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States spent $896 million and committed $1.10 billion in assistance to Vietnam between 2015 and 2021. In the same period, China spent $2.37 billion and committed $7.29 billion in assistance to Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Southeast Asia resides at the forefront of U.S.-China competition. The region has significant leverage to shape those relations, but country-by-country variance in Southeast Asian perspectives toward the United States and China helps explain why regional institutions such as ASEAN struggle to navigate great power rivalry. This variance also carries important implications for whether Washington and Beijing can successfully carry out their agendas. The one who is more responsive to intra-regional differences is likely to find more success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The available polling indicates that the United States enjoys more soft power and popularity than China across most of the region. Even with major gaps in public polling, majorities in the most populous states — Indonesia, and especially the Philippines and Vietnam — prefer the United States to China. Whether that is still true of most elites in Southeast Asia is unclear. In any case, the overall preference for the United States among regional publics is a significant advantage for Washington as it endeavors to coax governments into aligning with it on a range of issues, or at least keep regional states from aligning with China on issues that would damage U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soft power and popularity matter, but so do perceptions of hard power and the ability to deliver concrete benefits. Elites and publics in every country for which there is sufficient data, except the Philippines, see China as the predominant economic power in Asia. Most of their counterparts in places where the data is lacking probably do too. And the reality is that on most metrics, China is widening the economic influence gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Indonesian and Philippine publics still views the United States as the leading strategic power in the region, but who knows whether their counterparts in the rest of Southeast Asia agree. The same is true of most elites. Other than in Singapore, it is unclear whether elites among the United States’ most important Southeast Asian allies and partners — Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam — still see it as the predominant strategic power in Asia. This would accurately reflect the United States’ still considerable military advantages, as detailed for instance by the Lowy Institute’s Asia Power Index. But perceptions do not always match reality; more polling is needed on this front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington needs to be more attuned to how individual countries perceive their relations with the United States and China and shape its levers of engagement accordingly. Growing concern regarding China’s behavior and intentions create diplomatic and economic openings across the region, and Washington should advance a positive political, security, and economic agenda to meet the moment. One component should be an expansion of public and elite opinion polling in Southeast Asia so the United States can better understand how it is being perceived, target initiatives where they can have the greatest impact, and judge year-over-year progress.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成稱發起「墨落無悔」為展抗爭意志 聲明無約束力亦非協調會議共識&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;鄒家成稱不信「35+」、惟有「政棍」明知不可能仍「販賣假希望」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZBBPqXG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）踏入審訊第100天。鄒家成今就「墨落無悔」聲明作供，表示戴耀廷2020年6月9日記者會宣布參選人毋須簽文件以免製造「DQ紅書」，是他和張可森、梁晃維發起「墨落無悔」的「導火線」，他質疑戴做法「有冇咁兒戲」、是「退縮」表現，望透過聲明展現抗爭意志、防範初選落敗者繼續參選，而參選人是自願簽署，自行承擔DQ風險。鄒又指，「墨落」並無約束力，如簽署者反悔發起人「咩都做唔到」，但聲明面向公眾，故如違承諾「要接受問責嘅對象都係選民」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，「墨落聲明」的結構是由他制定，再由張可森草擬，當中談及會運用否決權的字句是來自戴耀廷在新東協調會議上的說法。惟鄒強調，該點雖會上有討論，但無達成共識、亦非初選協調會議共識，而參選人簽署「墨落」後，是就「墨落」所寫聲明形成表面共識，但無提倡無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱戴耀廷宣布參選人毋須簽文件-為他與張可森梁晃維發起墨落無悔導火線&quot;&gt;鄒稱戴耀廷宣布參選人毋須簽文件 為他與張可森梁晃維發起「墨落無悔」導火線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選新界東的鄒家成今繼續作供，步入法庭後向旁聽席微笑揮手。鄒在大律師陳世傑主問下表示，無收過「35+立會過半計劃 民主派新界東協調機制協議」的文件。法官李運騰關注文件提及「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，問新東是否有協議使用「會運用」，鄒不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就「墨落無悔」發問，鄒家成表示，理解戴耀廷6月9日記者會表示毋須參選人簽文件，因不想製造一個「DQ紅書」予藉口行政機關DQ候選人，而「我認為6月9號個記招，係一條導火線，令到我同埋另外兩位，即係張可森同埋梁晃維，發起『墨落無悔』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒質疑戴耀廷決定有冇咁兒戲係一個退縮&quot;&gt;鄒質疑戴耀廷決定「有冇咁兒戲」、「係一個退縮」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，他約於6月10日中午才從網媒得知戴耀廷曾於6月9日召記者會，當時他有兩個想法，首先戴在協調會上一直表示，能達成共識的項目「會變成一份文件畀參選人簽署」，亦是他接收到的訊息，但戴在無通知過參選人的情況下，突然開記招指不需要簽署文件，「我就覺得：有冇咁兒戲呀？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，其次是戴耀廷稱不想製造「DQ紅書」，但鄒認為據2016年選舉經驗，DQ紅線應是「主張香港獨立」，但協調會上無討論與港獨有關，「所以我唔明驚啲乜嘢」。鄒並指，「如果係因為一啲消息人士去施壓又好、定唔知點樣啦，而選擇突然宣布唔需要簽署文件呢，係一個退縮。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱先後聯絡張可森梁晃維-表示要簽返啲嘢去展現抗爭意志&quot;&gt;鄒稱先後聯絡張可森梁晃維 表示「要簽返啲嘢去展現抗爭意志」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續指當時約為下午3時，「我記得我係先同張可森聯絡」，分享上述想法，張有看記招亦同意其想法，鄒續指「要簽返啲嘢去展現抗爭意志」，張同意；鄒其後再聯絡梁晃維說相同的話，梁也同意，三人遂開設一個 Telegram 群組討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EQlFcM5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 左起：張可森、鄒家成、梁晃維（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注，為何鄒家成會聯絡參選新界西的張可森，鄒指他大概4月時已認識張可森和參選港島的梁晃維，「我哋見過面、傾過偈，覺得幾啱傾」；至於為何要找其他區的參選人，「其實冇諗咁多嘅嗰一刻」。鄒並同意法官陳仲衡指，他是為整個初選、而非只是其選區做一些事情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱聲明自願簽署無約束力-如違承諾接受問責對象是選民&quot;&gt;鄒稱聲明自願簽署無約束力 如違承諾接受問責對象是選民&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，三人很快決定要發起一個網絡聲明，主要有三個目的：一，向公眾展現抗爭意志；二，防範其他人初選落敗都繼續參加官方選舉；三，「呢份聲明係比大家自願去簽嘅，咁就由得其他參選人自行去承擔返可能會被DQ嘅風險」，這亦是回應戴耀廷6月9日記招的擔憂。陳世傑問，該聲明是一份聲明抑或協議？鄒答「佢只係一個聲明」，如人們同意就可選擇簽署，他一度指「情況類似民建聯喺街頭搞一個簽名活動咁樣」，惟法官指不感興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，「墨落無悔」是一份「無約束力」的聲明，「事實上佢簽完『墨落無悔』，佢最後係反悔嘅話，其實我哋三位發起人，咩都做唔到。」法官陳仲衡指，但聲明提到「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」，鄒同意，指「墨落」是一份「面向公眾」的聲明，「如果參選人違反承諾，佢要接受問責嘅對象都係選民。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱三人討論約一小時後-由張可森執筆起草&quot;&gt;鄒稱三人討論約一小時後 由張可森執筆起草&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」的草擬過程，鄒家成解釋「負責執筆起草嗰個，係張可森」，而張正式草擬前三人曾討論了約一小時，張約於4時開始「閉門草擬」，草擬途中遇到問題也會再問，最終他們6時半左右收到初稿，三人修改一次後，接近8時完成最終版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，3人一早決定晚上9時發文，並於8至9時期間嘗試分別私下將「墨落」的最終版本發給他們認識的參選人。鄒解釋，此做法一來「純粹禮貌上，早少少通知我哋認識嘅參選人」，二來亦因「正式出街嗰一刻，我哋都想多返少少人名喺呢度，唔係淨係得我哋三個」，而他們只是通知而非諮詢他們意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱發布墨落前曾各自通知非同區參選人&quot;&gt;鄒稱發布「墨落」前曾各自通知非同區參選人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，他只曾將聲明發給黃子悅，解釋「只係因為我電話有佢 number 啫，冇咩特別」，他並不知道張和梁分別私下發給誰。鄒並指當時向黃指聲明於9時會「正式出街」，問黃有否興趣簽署，黃說「好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注，為何參選新東的鄒，會聯絡參選新西的黃子悅，問鄒沒有其他新東候選人的聯絡電話嗎？鄒指，三人事前已表示不想將聲明私下發給同區參選人，「因為始終覺得好似係同區嘅競爭者，咁就唔想好似私底下 send 畀你好似教你點樣選舉咁樣」，形容是「刻意安排」。鄒並指就其他新東參選人，「如果我話係咪要搵佢哋搵唔到呢，唔係」，但當時無特意將新東參選人加入電話簿。鄒並在法官追問下指，三人就聯絡其他人沒有分工，「只係避免 send 畀自己同區。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒重申，不記得張可森和梁晃維聯絡了什麼人，而他們各自聯絡參選人後將收集到的名字整合，並於9時一起在 Facebook 發布，但聲明發布時有多少名字他「真係唔記得」，不過連同三人在內「應該係10個內」。鄒亦指沒有指示過其他人要在自己 Facebook 發布，供他們自行考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒供述簽署流程-包括在google-doc加名及聯絡發起人&quot;&gt;鄒供述簽署流程 包括在Google Doc加名及聯絡發起人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」加名的方法，鄒家成解釋，當時「反應都叫做幾踴躍，啲名都好亂」，故他於6月10日晚或11日早上曾開設一個所有人都可以編輯的「Google doc」檔案，讓自己整理名單，而張可森和梁晃維有向其他人私下發布該文件的連結，他亦會「隨緣」在 Facebook 看有沒有人發布聲明，並更新「Google Doc」的名單，間中就會按名單編輯 Facebook 的帖文。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，為何聲明最底有「*如希望參與聯署，請聯絡鄒家成/張可森/梁晃維」一句，鄒答：「咁搞得一個公開嘅聲明，都叫做打開門做生意，咁就梗係想越多人簽越好啦，因為個目的係要展現抗爭意志啊嘛。」鄒同意，除上述兩方法，亦可透過聯絡發起人簽署，當時亦有人私下 Facebook inbox 他表示想加名，但並非參加初選的人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落是以五區為基礎的聲明-曾獲張可森和梁晃維提供九西九東資訊&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落」是以五區為基礎的聲明 曾獲張可森和梁晃維提供九西九東資訊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就「墨落無悔」的內容，鄒家成表明「『墨落無悔』個結構，係我制定嘅」，即包括第一至四段和兩點聲明，但不包括第五段。鄒其後就聲明內容解釋，就「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎」，鄒稱是指五個地區的初選協調會議，「『墨落無悔』係一份以五區作為基礎嘅聲明。」至於「共同綱領」，鄒指是五區協調會議上的「議程（agenda）」，即協調會議上「所有傾過嘅項目」，但不一定有取得共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官關注，聲明發起人只來自3個選區，他們如何得知其他區都有討論同樣的綱領？鄒指三人有各自分享自己區協調會議的情況，而九西的資訊由張可森提供，但不知道他聯絡誰，而張可森或梁晃維亦有告知他九東的資訊，但他不記得是誰說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱協調會議共識包括辦初選等4點-惟亦有未達共識項目存差異&quot;&gt;鄒稱協調會議共識包括辦初選等4點 惟亦有未達共識項目、存「差異」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問協調會議達成什麼共識，鄒指有4點：辦初選、辦初選論壇、以靈童制為替補機制、及「贏咗有得選、輸咗冇得選」。法官陳慶偉問，最後一點即與「墨落」的第二點聲明「我認同若支持度跌出各區預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」一樣？鄒指「唔完全一樣」，指前者是「棄選機制」其中一個分支，另一分支是目標議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就聲明「考慮到立場差異，此一綱領已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數」一句提到的「差異」，鄒解釋「喺初選協調會議上面，大家係有啲爭拗嘅」，可理解為在討論「墨落無悔」一刻「暫時未有共識嘅項目」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱兩點聲明為焦點所在引張可森稱畫龍點睛處在向選民交代&quot;&gt;鄒稱兩點聲明為「焦點所在」、引張可森稱「畫龍點睛」處在向選民交代&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」一句，鄒解釋是一個「過渡句」，「根據張可森嘅講法，佢係話想產生一種承上啟下，同埋畫龍點睛嘅作用」，林卓廷、陳志全和施德來等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，是否即想令讀者注意到該句之後出現的兩點聲明為重點？鄒同意，亦同意因此聲明標題為「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭」。鄒並指，該兩點「當然係聲明嘅焦點所在」、「當然係聲明嘅重點」，而據張可森的說法，「嗰個畫龍點睛嘅精要之處，在於向選民交代。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落會運用否決權一句非協調會議共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落」會運用否決權一句非協調會議共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，若協調會議的共識只是鄒家成所說的4點，究竟有什麼爭議（controversial）令戴耀廷不想人簽署有該些共識的文件？並笑指戴也宣布了會有初選、之後也會有論壇直播、「贏咗有得選」亦是協調根本概念，該4點有什麼如此秘密（secretive）或具爭議性，令戴不想簽文件？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成回應，看到6月9日記招後「的確係有少少詫異嘅」，他亦不清楚各區達成了什麼共識。但就「墨落」第一點聲明：「我認同『五大訴求，缺一不可』。我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求，撤銷所有抗爭者控罪，令相關人士為警暴問責，並重啟政改達致雙普選」，他指並非共識，舉例戴在新東會議只表達他個人對五大訴求的看法，但並非大家「真係 round 一圈」去討論的議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱戴耀廷新東會上重複否決權句子-自己憑記憶寫予張可森草擬墨落&quot;&gt;鄒稱戴耀廷新東會上重複否決權句子 自己憑記憶寫予張可森草擬「墨落」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，就「我認同『五大訴求，缺一不可』。我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」這一部分字眼，「係我喺 Telegram 打（字）畀張可森嘅」；至於之後「撤銷所有抗爭者控罪，令相關人士為警暴問責，並重啟政改達致雙普選」的部分，他則不知道，應是張自己寫，但他們曾討論五大訴求的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續展示新界西的協議文件，指會運用否決權一句與「墨落」幾乎一樣。鄒同意兩者有相似之處，並解釋戴耀廷有在第二次協調會議讀出該句。法官關注李運騰是從文件讀出、抑或是憑記憶讀出，惟鄒沒有正面回應，並指不記得當時有否抄低整句句子，但該句在協調會議有重複數次，他是「憑記憶打返出嚟畀張可森去寫呢句嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官主動展示新東及新西協議文件-稱與墨落字句一致問是否巧合&quot;&gt;官主動展示新東及新西協議文件 稱與「墨落」字句一致、問是否巧合&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰笑着問，會上重複的次數足以令他記清楚該句？鄒說「其實呢句好好記㗎」，後答「係」。李亦問，因此該段其實是受戴耀廷影響，即鄒是跟隨戴的說法？鄒指戴耀廷讀出該句時有提到「積極」，但他就根據新東爭拗改為「會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再要求展示新東協議文件，用字為「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，問「墨落」出現相似句子，是否只是巧合？鄒重申「墨落」用「會運用」是他在第二次新東協調會議的動議，因此「未必稱得上為巧合，而係嚟自我嘅經驗」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落聲明起源並非共識簽署後是就墨落聲明形成共識&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落」聲明起源並非共識、簽署後是就「墨落」聲明形成共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，因此鄒家成是將一些並無達成共識的內容放進聲明？鄒說「我的確係想推銷聲明裡面第一點」，重申目的是聲明所列「為確保抗爭陣營參選人，有最基本的抗爭意志」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指但那會減低彈性，因戴耀廷曾稱加入「積極」是為保留彈性。鄒指戴無特別提「係唔係想保持彈性」，只提到意思是「可以否決、可以唔否決」。李指那正是彈性，鄒即說：「可以否決可以唔否決嘅話，咁我唔知寫嚟做乜嘢。」李運騰笑指他同意，並指因此鄒是想展示抗爭意志，望用最清楚的寫法，避免模棱兩可？鄒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒再同意，就運用否決權的第一點聲明會上有討論，但沒有達成共識，強調「墨落無悔」聲明起源並非來自共識，「當有人同意兩點聲明，佢簽署之後，我哋就會形成一個表面上嘅共識，就係有某一個數量嘅人同意呢兩點。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒不同意墨落無悔向組織者施壓重申無提倡無差別否決財案&quot;&gt;鄒不同意「墨落無悔」向組織者施壓、重申無提倡無差別否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問，而鄒是想將聲明通知組織者？李運騰亦問，鄒是想透過聲明的簽署人數，向組織者施壓？鄒不同意，並同意李運騰指聲明是面向公眾，無意向組織者施壓。不過鄒亦同意，之後曾將聲明及簽署人數發給組織者，陳問是想讓組織者知道情況？鄒說「呢個係之後嘅事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就鄒早前供稱，會以五大訴求為「唯一優先標準」審視預算案，他今同意認為議員的責任是爭取五大訴求，而以五大訴求為審視預算案的基礎，亦是恰當履行議員職責。鄒亦指，他在「墨落」並無提倡無差別否決預算案，亦對簽署者沒有任何約束性。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rtPh4uq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）踏入審訊第100天。鄒家成繼續作供，表示與發起「墨落無悔」聲明的張可森和梁晃維均不相信「35+」，而初選意義是選出最多具抗爭意志代議士，「墨落」與「35+」無關，只是將參選人政治理念帶到選民面前，展示抗爭意志。鄒又提及，有三類人表面主張35+有可能，包括明知35+不可能但仍「販賣假希望」的「政棍」、覺得35+有可能的天真理想主義者、及覺得35+無可能，但有政治勇氣和承擔望讓全世界知道，無論如何努力「當權者係唔會畀民主派攞到35+」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又表示，曾聽聞不少傳統泛民要求戴耀廷勿要大家簽文件，認為戴稱毋須簽文件是來自傳統泛民意思；而他直至收到審訊文件夾前無聽過「攬炒十步」，並理解「攬炒」為「側重於自我犧牲」的態度，從不是禁忌，反而很常見，「有權勢者打壓無權勢者，有反抗，就會形成『攬炒』」，而攬炒目的是拉近雙方政治勢力，為和談帶來可能。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落並無以35作為前提遵守棄選機制不代表能取35&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落」並無以「35+」作為前提、遵守棄選機制不代表能取「35+」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續就「墨落無悔」聲明作供，他今早供稱發起聲明為展示抗爭意志，惟並無約束力。鄒下午被問及聲明與「35+」的關係，他同意「35+計劃」目的是取得立會過半，但「墨落無悔」並沒有以「35+」作為前提。法官陳仲衡指，但就聲明支持度不足須停止選舉工程的一點，與「35+計劃」很有關。鄒不同意有很大關係，指棄選機制概念的確來自「35+計劃」，但參選人遵守不代表會取得「35+」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒重申，「墨落」的主要目的是「為確保抗爭陣營參選人，有最基本的抗爭意志」，法官李運騰即質疑，棄選機制與「抗爭意志」無關。鄒承認兩者的確無直接關係，放在聲明是因認為這是初選的「基本邏輯」，以保障出線者勝出的機會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱發起人俱不信35選出最多具抗爭意志代議士方為初選意義&quot;&gt;鄒稱發起人俱不信「35+」、選出最多具抗爭意志代議士方為初選意義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，留意到鄒將「35+計劃」和「初選」進行區分，鄒同意，並同意初選是「35+計劃」的一部分，而35+計劃「只係一個名嚟㗎啫」，「35+」代表議席的目標、亦是組織者想達到的目標，但這不是他的目標，並強調「個議席目標點樣決定，唔會影響到初選個意義」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師陳世傑續問，那初選是否用來達到「35+」的手段？鄒指「個人認為唔係」，指「選出最多具備抗爭意志嘅代議士，先係（初選）最大嘅意義」，同意其看法與組織者不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱聲明將參選人政治理念帶到選民前競爭惟不知其他簽署者動機&quot;&gt;鄒稱聲明將參選人政治理念帶到選民前競爭、惟不知其他簽署者動機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問及，因此無論「35+」或「35-」，對鄒家成來說也是沒有分別，他仍然會繼續發起「墨落無悔」？鄒回應，「基本上我哋三位發起人，都唔相信35+」，而正因他們對未來議會想像都是「35-」，在此前提下，他們認為選出最多具備抗爭意志的代議士才是比較「合情合理」和「實際可行」，並覺得要用一些方法向選民展現抗爭意志，「將參選人嘅政治理念，帶去選民面前競爭」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰笑言，而結果是差不多所有人都有簽署聲明。鄒續指，「墨落」是初選競選時其中一個有爭拗的議題，「其他簽署人簽嘅動機係咩，我的確唔知」，「我哋三個做嘅嘢就係提供一個聲明畀大家去簽署，佢哋點樣用呢個聲明，我哋亦都唔知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱表面對35積極有三類人-包括明知不可能仍販賣假希望&quot;&gt;鄒稱表面對35+積極有三類人 包括明知不可能仍「販賣假希望」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成其後在法官追問下重申，以他對張可森和梁晃維的認識，他們3人均不相信「35+」。李運騰笑言，似乎有很多參與者均不相信35+，那鄒協調會上聽過人向戴耀廷稱35+是不可能、或說戴天真嗎？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒說沒有，並主動表示認為對35+採取「比較積極」態度的人，主要分為三類，第一類是「明知35+冇可能，但佢不停去講35+，然之後講35+之後，好似民主會立即降臨咁樣」，鄒並指曾於傳單和街站形容該些人「販賣假希望」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而第二類人「可能真係覺得35+有可能嘅，帶住一絲嘅希望睇吓可唔可以搵到一個攞到35+嘅機會」，鄒認為他們「類似一種帶一點天真嘅理想主義者」，但當時沒有直接這樣說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三類人，鄒指是「有一啲嘅政治嘅勇氣或者政治嘅承擔」，認為他們「覺得35+係冇可能，但佢哋都會盡力去完成呢個任務，目的其實係想話畀全世界知道，無論我哋點樣努力都好，當權者都係唔會比我哋攞到35+」，亦即「撕破假象嘅表面」。鄒並指他是因應第一類人而有自己的主張。李運騰問，所以他將自己視為第三類人？鄒說：「我係第四類人」，即引來哄堂大笑，惟鄒欲再解釋時被法官打斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官追問時着鄒想清楚-鄒自言諗得好清楚並稱墨落與35無關&quot;&gt;官追問時着鄒想清楚 鄒自言「諗得好清楚」、並稱「墨落」與「35+」無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉要求鄒再想清楚共有多少類人，鄒笑言「其實數唔晒嘅」，因每個小區也可產生一類人，並指頭三類「表面上都會主張35+係有可能」，惟陳慶偉指不是，指頭一類人是認為35+不可能但「販賣假希望」，而「假希望」即是不真實的。鄒苦笑說：「我知、我知……我明呀，我啱啱所講嗰三類人……」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉打斷說：「聽着，想清楚」，鄒說：「我諗得好清楚㗎喇。」陳再說：「因為我不想你現在捏造（make up）證據」，鄒反問：「咁我而家，要點？」旁聽席傳來笑聲，陳遂要求鄒給出最後答案。大律師陳世傑一度問鄒有關第四類人，鄒微笑說「搞掂頭三類先啦」，重申表面上會看到他們主張35+，李運騰問即告訴人35+是可能？鄒說「exactly!」，並指上述純粹是他對他們內在想法的分析。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後說，鄒是指第一大組可分成三個小組，而他們都是相信35+是可能？鄒兩度重申只是「表面上」。陳追問，即他們是否相信35+是可能？鄒說：「不如我哋掉走個大組啦。」陳說：「聽着，我沒有建立大組，是你建立」，又指「我不想你亂說話和一時衝動（“… say something randomly and at the spur of the moment”）」，並嚴厲說「我再給你多一次機會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒其後再次重複對3類人的看法，並形容首類人「係政棍嚟嘅呢類，我形容呢一類係政棍、販賣假希望嘅政棍」，至於第3類人，鄒重申雖然他們明知35+不可能，但目的是想讓香港人或世界知道，「無論我哋點努力都好，當權者係唔會畀民主派攞到35+。」鄒最後指，「墨落無悔」與35+沒有關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒認為戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽文件-是來自傳統泛民主派意思&quot;&gt;鄒認為戴耀廷記者會稱毋須簽文件 是來自傳統泛民主派意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後就約於6月17日後進行、由媒體「Spark」對「墨落無悔」3名發起人的訪問發問。被問到是哪家媒體，鄒指有些模糊，記得是由「張可森搵返嚟」、應是某大學的媒體，張向他和梁晃維稱記者想找他們「講一講『墨落無悔』」，和順便介紹自己和講述政治理念，而訪問中「我哋自說自話，事前冇夾過嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示謄本，鄒家成在訪問被問為何發起「墨落無悔」聲明時，提及開會時一直指有共同綱領要大家簽署，但在無通知他們情況下就召開記招指不需要簽：「我哋第一個感覺就話我哋要簽返啲嘢喎，唔可以畀泛民主派單方面去撕毀約章……撕毀緊成個香港民族對於未來嘅想像。」鄒解釋是指戴耀廷稱會讓大家簽文件，其後又突然稱「唔畀簽」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡關注，鄒提及不可讓「泛民」單方面撕毀約章，是不視自己為「泛民」一部分？鄒指此處「泛民」是指「傳統泛民主派」，並指6月9日戴耀廷開記者會前，曾聽聞不少傳統泛民主派約見戴耀廷，並要求戴勿要求大家簽文件，故認為戴記者會所說「其實係嚟自傳統泛民主派嘅意思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱部分傳統泛民包括岑子杰批評墨落是夾人&quot;&gt;鄒稱部分傳統泛民包括岑子杰批評「墨落」是「夾人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續引張可森訪問提及「如果佢哋係可以了解到呢個時代係需要啲咩，係回應到呢個時代要前進嘅方向嘅話，其實你唔會覺我哋係夾你嘅」，被問「夾」是什麼意思，鄒指張當時是回應就「墨落無悔」是「夾緊人」的批評，該些批評來自部分傳統泛民主派，他當時意識到或留意到的是社民連岑子杰。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱攬炒為自我犧牲態度目的拉近雙方勢力為和談帶來可能&quot;&gt;鄒稱「攬炒」為自我犧牲態度、目的拉近雙方勢力為和談帶來可能&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張可森訪問亦提及「攬炒」，陳世傑問鄒對「攬炒」的理解，鄒指「『攬炒』對我嚟講係一種態度、一種側重於自我犧牲嘅態度」，並認為2020年初選要延續這種「攬炒」精神，有兩種具體表現，第一是他早前提及實踐議會內「寸土必爭」，第二是「不惜自我犧牲都要阻止惡法」，即「盡力喺議會裡面阻止」的態度。鄒並認為，上述兩種實踐均是在2020年立法會有機會被政權針對、DQ、追討薪金，而行政機關要付出的代價就是「受到制衡」和「推動唔到佢哋想推動嘅惡法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒又指，「『攬炒』從來都唔係一個禁忌」，而且很常見，舉例勞工向資方提出一些改善工作環境的條件，如加薪或減低工作時數，並表明如資方不改善工作環境就會罷工，鄒認為罷工本身就是「攬炒」。鄒又指，「有權勢者打壓無權勢者，有反抗，就會形成『攬炒』」，並認為「攬炒」目的，就是「拉近雙方嘅政治勢力，為和談帶來可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無看過戴耀廷攬炒十步&quot;&gt;鄒稱無看過戴耀廷「攬炒十步」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問，鄒家成當時留意到戴耀廷提倡「攬炒十步」嗎？鄒說「我冇睇過」，亦不知道戴當時有關「攬炒」的主張。鄒並指，首次聽到「攬炒十步」是在收到審訊文件夾時，陳指是2021年，鄒稱不記得當時是否已收到文件夾。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問張可森梁晃維訪問發言是否代表鄒-鄒都可以呀&quot;&gt;官問張可森梁晃維訪問發言是否代表鄒 鄒：都可以呀&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉其後要求播片，被問到為何發起「墨落無悔」，梁晃維提及如初選協議在如此鬆散情況下定下、無確切文件證明大家也同意，實在不能估算初選後各派人會否繼續堅持參與，甚至入議會後是否會履行當初對港人的承諾，而既然戴耀廷不希望令到多人被DQ，「咁就不如我哋作為有意參選人 take up 返嗰個責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;張可森則表示，「墨落無悔」四字是他所寫，望港人或從政者意識到「我哋有啲嘢根本上係唔同咗」，現時不再是討論政治、妥協的藝術、或一開始說要「攬炒」但「回一回價」又不「攬炒」，現時討論的是「抗爭」，而抗爭是不妥協的藝術，「當你簽咗呢張嘢應承咗嘅時候，你絕對唔可以反悔。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;片段播畢後法官陳仲衡問，因三人是一起發起「墨落」，張可森和梁晃維談及為何發起「墨落無悔」的部分，也是代表鄒所說？鄒答：「都可以呀。」陳慶偉亦指，留意到鄒在另外兩人說話時不時點頭，鄒說「我有留意到」。陳續問，那鄒是否不同意他們說法？抑或指他們只是在表達自己意見？鄒回應：「唔會唔同意佢哋嘅諗法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方稱主問大約到一半&quot;&gt;辯方稱主問大約到一半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑最後問到，鄒訪問提及初選論壇「係唯一一個場地去同泛民主派一個交鋒」，問他為何這樣說，鄒稱因以往也沒試過有一個像初選論壇的平台「畀各門各派嘅人去交流」，而論壇可讓大家就不同政治理念交鋒，繼而尋找民主運動出路。陳仲衡指鄒訪問不是提到「交流」、而是「交鋒」，鄒認為「差唔多啫」，指在論壇語境就是「交鋒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方表示，已完成就「墨落無悔」的盤問，並指現時大約已到主問一半。法官陳慶偉笑言只到一半？李運騰亦關注下一個議題。陳指會問及提名表格、Facebook 帖文、選舉論壇、WhatsApp 群組等，預計星期四或之前完成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天續審，只於下午開庭。散庭時，鄒向親友說：「好鬼攰、真係好鬼攰。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第99天。參選新界東的鄒家成開始作供，表示參選立會原因是宣揚「香港民族」理念、爭取五大訴求，及執行立法會議員監察制衡政府和「為人民發聲」的職務。鄒指，五大訴求具壓倒性民意支持，且合情合理合法合憲，作為議員應為人民爭取；又指確立香港民族地位是他從政最大願景，而香港民族核心是港人治港，與五大訴求追求民主政制、自由自主的精神相通，故支持五大訴求。鄒庭上解釋本土派理念時，被法官打斷指毋須深究，惟鄒亦指出「香港民族」理念與港獨「唔一樣」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，認為35+目的就是奪取立法會過半議席，理論上可增加談判籌碼，而他參加初選目的同樣為宣揚香港民族理念、望選取最多「具備抗爭意志」的代議士進入立法會，及認為「無篩選」的初選可讓參選人獲民意授權。鄒亦指，曾擔心作為政治素人要在初選勝出相當困難，但回歸宣揚香港民族理念的「初心」，終放低贏輸考慮，把握初選作為平台宣揚他擁抱的理念。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成開始作供-稱參選立會為宣揚香港民族理念&quot;&gt;鄒家成開始作供 稱參選立會為宣揚「香港民族」理念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成今開始作供，他身穿黑色西裝、打黑色領帶，在兩名懲教陪同下步入法庭，向旁聽席及律師點頭。鄒到達座位時向旁聽席雙手合十鞠躬，並微笑舉起拳頭，坐下後與身旁法庭傳譯交談。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 鄒家成&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成其後宣誓，接受大律師陳世傑主問。鄒同意，他於1997年2月出生，現正還柙，此前與母親和4個姐姐同住。鄒案發時23歲，正修讀大學護理系，2020年4月向學校申請休學，為參加立法會選舉準備，而他2019年有參加區議會選舉但落敗。陳世傑問為何他想參選，鄒說：「第一，宣揚香港民族理念；第二，爭取五大訴求；第三，執行立法會議員嘅職務，即係監察政府、制衡政府、為人民發聲等等。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指五大訴求追求民主政制-與香港民族核心理念相通故支持&quot;&gt;鄒指「五大訴求」追求民主政制 與「香港民族」核心理念相通故支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問為何想爭取五大訴求，鄒家成指以兩個角度回答，首先從立法會議員職務的角度，五大訴求是「具壓倒性民意支持」的訴求，而且「合情合理合法合憲」，可在《基本法》框架下達成，「作為立法會議員，應該係要為人民爭取訴求同埋發聲」；而從政治理念角度，「確立香港民族嘅地位係我從政嘅最大願景」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指：「『香港民族』嘅核心，係港人治港；『五大訴求』背後嘅精神，係追求民主政制、自由自主、制度公義，即係港人治港嘅表現。基於我認為五大訴求同我嘅政治理念相通，所以我支持。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問鄒認為何謂五大訴求，鄒表示：「第一，撤回逃犯修訂條例；第二，撤回612暴動定性；第三，釋放所有因為反修例而被捕嘅示威者；第四，成立獨立調查委員會調查警暴；第五，要求重啟政改，達致雙普選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續指，鄒家成提到本土意識和「香港民族」，能否簡單解釋是什麼意思。鄒指「本土派」即是「以本土嘅利益為優先，致力守護本土嘅價值、文化、語言等等，我認為本土理念同香港民族理念相通」。惟法官李運騰打斷指不認為需要深究，鄒說「最後一句講埋得唔得呀，唔好意思」，惟李說「No.」。陳世傑續問，「本土意識」和「香港民族」與香港獨立有關嗎？鄒答：「唔一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指奪過半議席本身就是35目的-理論上可增談判籌碼&quot;&gt;鄒指奪過半議席本身就是35+目的 理論上可增談判籌碼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問及協調會議，鄒家成表示，理解協調會議是為9月立法會選舉而準備的工作，最初聽到由戴耀廷和區諾軒提議舉辦，而「35+」意思就是「奪取立法會過半議席」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑問那「35+」的目的是什麼？鄒說「個目的就係爭取立法會奪取過半議席囉」。法官陳仲衡問，那取得過半後的目的是什麼？鄒說：「佢本身就係一個目的。」李運騰追問，要達至什麼目的（to what end）？鄒重申：「過半議席囉。」李追問：「但之後呢？（“But then what?”）」鄒答：「理論上就係增加一個談判籌碼。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無人邀請下主動報名參與新東首次協調會&quot;&gt;鄒稱無人邀請下主動「報名」參與新東首次協調會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒確認，他有出席兩次新東協調會議，但「沒有人邀請我」，而他於2020年3月尾至4月頭時已萌生參加立法會選舉的念頭，當時有朋友告知他戴耀廷和區諾軒「好似搞緊協調會議」並告知他時間地點，他遂向此朋友「報名」，表示想出席首次會議。鄒指該朋友並非圈內人，純粹認識一些區議員，而當時辦協調會議的消息傳播得很遠，幾乎所有區議員都會知。而鄒稱參加首次會議的原因，「純粹想聽吓啲人講啲乜嘢，睇吓啲人就住9月立法會選舉有啲咩嘢嘅睇法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒參加初選目的宣揚香港民族理念選出最多具備抗爭意志代議士&quot;&gt;鄒：參加初選目的宣揚香港民族理念、選出最多「具備抗爭意志」代議士&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問參加初選的主要原因，鄒家成指有三點，首先「選舉本質上係一個廣受市民大眾關注嘅政治活動，係一個宣揚政治理念嘅好平台」，故他參加初選的首個目的「係希望可以宣揚香港民族理念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其次，鄒指初選本質上是一個「去蕪存菁」、「具競爭性」的政治活動，加上他認為35+不可能，故認為「選出最多具備抗爭意志嘅代議士進入立法會，係初選嘅意義」。李運騰指他不明白，鄒提到35+不可能和選出最多具抗爭意志的人入立會之間邏輯上的關係。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒解釋，基於他認為35+不可能的議會想像，故「要喺35-嘅可預期嘅未來底下，去尋求更大力度嘅制衡行政機關嘅力量」，「協助香港人選出最多具備抗爭意志嘅代議士」，指這是他當時思考的理路，想告知法庭「我嗰陣係咁樣諗嘢嘅啫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指判斷參選人有否抗爭意志交選民決定&quot;&gt;鄒指判斷參選人有否抗爭意志交選民決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰仍面露疑惑，惟陳慶偉笑指「那沒有邏輯的」，並指鄒意思是因為35+不可能，所以初選本質上是選擇最具抗爭意志的人與政府抗爭，鄒同意，指「類似就係更新球隊球員嘅諗法」。陳續說，而球隊人數並不重要，鄒只是想隊伍有最強的球員，鄒同意。法官陳仲衡續以足球隊為例，指鄒如不能組成11人隊伍，也嘗試組成10人隊伍？陳慶偉補充：「甚至只有1人」，鄒同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後問，鄒指初選是要找出最強抗爭意志的鬥士（fighter），但初選如何達致這點？陳並手指向被告席，指他們均來自很闊的政治光譜。鄒回應，要回答此問題，「就回歸到，到底我哋有一張選票，我哋點樣去判斷一個參選人有沒有抗爭意志嘅問題」，陳慶偉指，即是看選民的選擇？鄒指「我的確認為判斷一個參選人有冇抗爭意志係交畀選民決定」，但在競爭過程內，參選人當然可以互相質疑、互相比併。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指初選為無篩選選舉戴耀廷從無提誰有資格參加初選&quot;&gt;鄒指初選為「無篩選」選舉、戴耀廷從無提誰有資格參加初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，第三個參加初選目的，是因初選是一個「無篩選」的選舉。惟陳慶偉即打斷問為什麼，質疑鄒說法不全然正確，指戴耀廷說過只有認同五大訴求的人才能參與，而劉偉聰也提過初選性質不民主，因為會令選民無法選擇大批候選人。鄒解釋，因在新東協調會議，他從無聽過戴耀廷提及「邊個有資格參加初選、邊個冇資格參加初選」；而他認為一般指的「篩選」，是指「第三方嘅權力機構行使公權力去阻止人參選」，而初選並無出現過這個過程。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指他明白，但認為只有第三方篩選的說法不全然正確，因立法會選舉是由政府舉辦，由政府進行篩選，而政府嚴格而言不是第三方；而就初選，雖戴耀廷在新東會議沒有這樣說，但不認為戴會讓建制派人士參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱初選可予參選人獲民意授權奉行為人民請命精神&quot;&gt;鄒稱初選可予參選人獲民意授權、奉行為人民請命精神&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒回應，第三方不是指第三或第四、第五個機構，但選舉主任DQ候選人，「我理解為已經僭建咗一個權力嘅部門去處理呢個事情」，並指最關鍵的是「係唔係行使緊公權力去阻止人參選」。鄒又指，戴耀廷「當然係可以阻止建制派參加初選啦，因為呢個係民主派嘅初選」，情況就如社民連辦黨內初選，也要社民連黨員才可參加，「因此我哋又返到去到底咩人先係可以參加民主派初選啦係咪？我會答㗎喇，我覺得五大訴求……」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟李運騰打斷，指毋須知道鄒的意見，而是關注鄒的證供，指戴耀廷無提參加初選資格，似乎與區諾軒證供不同。法官陳慶偉則指，「35+計劃」文件也有提及參選資格，惟鄒指他無收過該份文件，會上也沒有討論、提及或傳閱該份文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒其後補充有關參加初選的第三個目的：「我覺得初選係一個冇篩選嘅選舉，佢係一個機會畀參選人獲得民意授權，奉行為人民請命嘅精神。關於初選嘅參加目的，我冇嘢補充。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指選舉理應是參選人與選民間的事-行政機關以公權力阻參選便屬第三方&quot;&gt;鄒指選舉理應是參選人與選民間的事 行政機關以公權力阻參選便屬第三方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而鄒小休後就政治篩選的說法補充，表示認為選舉「理應係參選人同埋選民之間嘅事」，行政機關有責任提供一個公平公正的選舉，「如果行政機關行使公權力去阻止人參選，呢個行為本身就係第三方行使公權力去做呢個篩選，因此行政機關就係第三方。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱為宣揚民族理念-放低贏輸考慮參加初選&quot;&gt;鄒稱為宣揚民族理念 放低贏輸考慮參加初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問，參加立法會選舉是否一定要參加初選？鄒指參加首次協調會議前，他無期望過一定會搞初選，而會上決定辦初選後，「我都冇諗過要參加初選住」，因作為「政治素人」，「我自己知道相對於其他參選人，我嘅政治資本冇咁豐富，例如我冇參選好豐富嘅經驗啦、冇大黨支持、亦冇足夠嘅選舉籌備資金去支持我參加選舉」，因此他當時已經擔心，「我要用一個半月嘅時間，由無人認識，到要初選勝出，係相當困難嘅事情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;不過鄒指會議後，他與選舉團隊討論，「我哋回歸到我哋嘅初心，就係宣揚香港民族理念，所以我哋放低咗贏輸呢個考慮，把握一啲焦點平台，去宣揚一啲我哋擁抱嘅政治理念」，這亦扣連他參加初選的第一個目的，並指「冇嘢補充」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉笑指他明白，就是鄒不一定要參加初選，但想透過參選提倡其理念，鄒同意，並強調這是他參加完首次協調會議後產生的想法，「因為當時我已經尋找緊參加初選嘅意義。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZczsbzU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第99天。鄒家成繼續作供，新東焦點落在協調會議就否決權的討論，鄒今表示，戴耀廷在第二次會議首度提出「會積極運用《基本法》權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，他當時動議改為「會」運用，惟感覺遭主持的程張迎「敷衍」。鄒承認當時有少少「着咗（ignited）」，並向戴稱不應用如此「模棱兩可」的字眼，民主黨代表則反對其動議，表示這會令他們失去中產和「淺藍」的票，亦指不獲授權投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指當時回應為何經歷完2019年運動，「你哋仲可以講呢啲嘢？你哋瞓醒未呀？」最終戴出來「打圓場」，指「『積極』比冇已經係行前一步」，並轉為討論其他事宜，會上終無舉行投票亦無達成協議。鄒指，他說話時有用肢體語言，但氣氛未去到面紅耳赤、拍枱說粗口的地步，而會後他有就會上不禮貌態度向戴耀廷道歉。鄒並指戴曾稱如有時間會再開多一次會，惟最終並沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指戴耀廷首次新東會議提出擬共同綱領預期有文件簽署&quot;&gt;鄒指戴耀廷首次新東會議提出擬「共同綱領」、預期有文件簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選新界東的鄒家成繼續作供，談及新東協調會議情況。鄒同意，2020年4月可謂他首次參與「35+計劃」的事情，而4月14日首次會上由戴耀廷帶起討論，戴提及將就「共同綱領」的項目討論，達成共識的項目就會變成一份文件讓大家簽署。鄒指當時無特別說誰會簽，但合乎邏輯去想應是參加初選的人會簽；並同意首次會議後，預期之後會有一份文件予大家簽署。鄒亦指會上沒有討論亦沒有人問及誰可參加初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱由始至終不相信35神話&quot;&gt;鄒稱由始至終不相信35+神話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉追問鄒是否期望所有選區都簽同一份文件，鄒先說「應該各區各一份」，其後更正指是「新東自己有一份」，至於其他區「我真係唔知」、亦無預期過會有，他亦沒有想過要所有區有同一份文件。陳慶偉指，但這會很奇怪，因若各區想法不同，如有選區想否決預算案來爭五大訴求、有選區不想，「35+計劃」成功的機會就會減少。鄒回應：「我當時冇諗咁多，可能因為我由始至終，都唔相信35+呢個神話」，並在法官問追下指他協調會議沒有這樣表達，但有在 Facebook 和選舉論壇表達。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指戴曾稱或有第三次會議但終無召開&quot;&gt;鄒指戴曾稱或有第三次會議但終無召開&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，至5月5日第二次會議同樣期望會簽署協議。陳仲衡問他有沒有問及文件的去向？鄒指他沒問過何時有文件，直到6月9日戴耀廷記者會；而他當時亦期望會有第三次協調會議。李運騰問為何有此期望，鄒指因戴耀廷於第二次會議曾表示，如之後有時間會再開多一次協調會議，「但要睇有冇空間」，惟最終沒有開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱協調共識包括61指戴耀廷認為新東有潛質多取一席&quot;&gt;鄒稱協調共識包括「6+1」、指戴耀廷認為新東有潛質多取一席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續確認，第一次會議達成3點共識，包括辦初選、「贏咗有得選，輸咗冇得選」、及出選名單數目為「6+1」，並指後兩者統稱為「棄選機制」。至於第二次會議則達成兩點共識，包括辦論壇和以靈童制為替補機制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問及，鄒稱想選出最多意志最強的鬥士入立法會，但「6+1」安排不會令成功機會減少嗎？鄒指最終會否派7隊出選是依賴民調結果，而他不熟悉民調如何運作亦無問過，亦無就此表達意見。鄒並指印象中「6+1」由戴耀廷提議，但沒有參與者反對。李運騰問故雖戴提議「6 6 4 4 3」，但他本人在新東卻提議「n+1」？鄒說以其理解，新東以6為目標議席是根據上屆立選結果而暫定，但戴覺得「新東有潛質攞多一席」，故用民調看看「有冇機會攞多一席」。鄒亦不知其他區有否「+1」的安排。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱第二次會議戴耀廷首提會積極運用否決權&quot;&gt;鄒稱第二次會議戴耀廷首提「會積極運用」否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，在首次新東會議後，鄒家成有否收過總結會議的文件、即名為「35+新東」的協調文件初稿，鄒指「我冇收過」，而首次會議亦無討論過否決權事宜。鄒指他第一次聽到相關討論，是在5月5日第二次會議，大家自我介紹後不久，戴耀廷提出「會積極運用《基本法》嘅權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，戴並補充意思是「可以投，可以唔投」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱動議改為會運用否決權並要求投票-惟遭程張迎敷衍致討論激烈&quot;&gt;鄒稱動議改為「會」運用否決權並要求投票 惟遭程張迎「敷衍」致討論激烈&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒表示他續提出動議，「我動議用『會』而唔要『積極』兩個字」，並要求投票。陳慶偉問，為何戴耀廷一開始就用「會積極運用」的字眼？指此前證供指，那是一個用來妥協的字眼，鄒說「我唔知」。法官追問鄒為何這樣提出，鄒說：「我會解釋嘅，但係唔知可唔可以我依照返當時事件發生嘅次序，然後我再慢慢解答。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續表示，他提出動議後，其中一位主持會議的「（時任沙田區議會主席）程張迎先生」，「佢敷衍我嘅動議、敷衍我嘅睇法，俗啲講就係，我覺得佢 hea 緊我啦」，陳志全和柯耀林等發笑。鄒指，覺得程當時「打算無視我嘅動議」，並想直接討論下一個議題，而對他來說，「我覺得程張迎先生呢一個主持會議嘅方式，先係令到個討論開始激烈嘅原因。」翻譯將激烈討論譯為「heated exchange」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y178xfX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 程張迎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問，激烈（heated）是什麼意思？從何而來？陳慶偉說：「Because 程張迎 hea him」，多人發笑。陳世傑再問激烈從何而來（“Where does the heat come from?”）？鄒重申是不滿程主持會議的方式，但他具體說過什麼，「我覺得佢敷衍緊我，我真係唔記得」。法官陳仲衡續問，「你當時『着咗』（ignited）？」法庭傳譯翻譯為「跟住你着咗燈」，多人大笑，鄒說：「少少啦。」法官陳慶偉笑說：「他當時很年輕，可以理解的（“He was young, you see, understandable.”）」，庭上再傳出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指向戴耀廷稱不應用模棱兩可字眼氣氛未去到面紅耳赤&quot;&gt;鄒指向戴耀廷稱不應用「模棱兩可」字眼、氣氛「未去到面紅耳赤」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續指，他當時開始解釋其動議，並對戴耀廷說：「唔使你講我夠知道，作為立法會議員，可以否決、可以唔否決啦。（但）我哋唔應該用啲咁模棱兩可嘅字眼，既然五大訴求咁清晰，政府冇喺 budget 回應，咁咪投否決囉。」法官陳慶偉續說，「當然你當時會提高了一點聲量，不會像今天這麼平靜」，鄒笑說：「我而家內在都好激動㗎！」林卓廷哈哈大笑，庭上笑聲一片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，「其實嗰個『激烈咗』呢，係相對於本身水靜鵝飛嘅協調會議氣氛，真係未去到面紅耳赤、又拍晒枱企晒起身講晒粗口咁嘅」，而他當時講完後，戴耀廷就冷靜回應「咁你個意思即係點？」，鄒說完並問法官「呢 part OK？」，一直托頭專心望向鄒的陳慶偉說：「If you are OK, I’m OK.」，再引來大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒庭上畫出新東會議座位表-坐民主黨代表對面但不認得是誰&quot;&gt;鄒庭上畫出新東會議座位表 坐民主黨代表對面但不認得是誰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，他遂向戴重申動議「會」運用權力一字，其後就有人反對。鄒續主動向法官提議：「不如我進入下一個部分之前，我簡單講一講當時個座位啦，唔知道法官閣下有冇興趣？」，並即場以法庭比劃當時會議場地面積，指房間大小從被告席後方的牆到大律師 Trevor Beel 的位置；長度則由另一面牆到大律師黃宇逸的位置，黃宇逸一度舉手和笑着站起身，鄒與他打招呼，李運騰指面積約為400呎。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YeFtkj1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 大律師 黃宇逸&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒指房內以很多桌子砌成一個長方型，並在陳慶偉要求下即場畫出座位表，笑言「但我畫功唔係好靚」。鄒續解釋，若分為兩個「U」型，右邊坐着程張迎、戴耀廷、區諾軒，而程的右邊是民主黨代表，區的左邊則是他、再到何桂藍，換言之他與民主黨代表坐在對方對面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而U的左邊有劉頴匡、呂智恆、社民連代表、沙田區政代表和將軍澳青年力量代表，但鄒不記得他們座位，並指兩次會議均有約30多人出席，主要發言者才坐在桌子旁，部分人則坐在後面。鄒並指，他當時不認識民主黨代表，是庭上聽過莊榮輝和李永成的名字，才知民主黨代表有機會是他們，「但因為我真係唔識佢哋，我唔知邊個打邊個。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱會上有人批評傳統泛民行禮如儀不記得社民連代表發言&quot;&gt;鄒稱會上有人批評傳統泛民「行禮如儀」、不記得社民連代表發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續問及鄒講述與程張迎的「激烈」討論，鄒微笑說「激烈」的並非討論，他只是要求程重新就他提出的動議做討論，「我冇鬧佢嘅」，林卓廷大笑。鄒續指，他重提動議後，兩名男民主黨黨員出聲反對，其中一個是林卓廷代表、另一個則無提是代表林卓廷。鄒續在法官陳慶偉追問下，指他記得會上有人批評傳統泛民主派「行禮如儀」，但不是由他所說，亦記得不是特別指民主黨；鄒亦不記得街工有否出席，指有關否決財案的辯論，他主要與民主黨代表對話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指就對話過程「咁肢體語言一定有啦」。陳慶偉指他與民主黨代表「隔住張枱喎」，鄒補充是「手勢嗰隻肢體語言、唔係肢體衝突」，陳問有「手指指（finger pointing）」？鄒說：「我係講嘢有肢體語言啫，我唔係咁樣指住」，邊說邊舉起手指做指人的動作，並笑說：「咁你話有冇一兩下指住佢，我唔知呀。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，陳寶瑩有否站起表達社民連立場。鄒稱記得陳寶瑩無出席，而是吳文遠出席，但記得他無「企起身」、亦不記得他說過什麼；至於首次會議，他亦記得陳寶瑩無出席。李運騰追問，即陳寶瑩沒出席過任何一次會議？鄒笑說：「咁講啦，其實我係坐監之後先知道陳寶瑩個樣係點樣嘅」，引來哄堂大笑，坐在旁聽席的陳寶瑩亦跟着發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Xp9Ztof.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳寶瑩&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉說，因此若陳當時在場，鄒也不知道？鄒同意，但補充記得首次會議社民連代表是吳文遠和岑子杰，「咁佢兩個係我喺電視見得比較多嘅政治人物，所以我認得佢哋」，至於「你話會唔會佢哋旁聽仲有多一個女士呢，我就真係唔知喇」。陳慶偉追問，那會上有人提過若政府落實全民退保，社民連會支持預算案嗎？鄒說不記得，至於街工有否提過若預算案對基層有利便不會否決，鄒指「可能有人講咁上下嘅說話」，但不知發言者是否街工代表。小休時，鄒家成與陳寶瑩互相揮手笑着打招呼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱提出動議後民主黨代表反對-稱會失中產和淺藍票中委會無授權&quot;&gt;鄒稱提出動議後民主黨代表反對 稱會失中產和淺藍票、中委會無授權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續講述民主黨代表對其動議的反對情況，指有黨員提及「呢個主張會令到佢哋失去中產票同埋淺藍嘅票」及「中委會冇授權佢哋去投票」，但不記得是由誰說，亦有提出很多他覺得「模棱兩可」的審視標準，如反問「做呢樣、做嗰樣，又投反對票呀？」，但不記得舉了什麼例子。鄒並指當時回應：「點解經歷完2019年以五大訴求為主軸嘅社會運動之後，你哋仲可以講呢啲嘢？你哋瞓醒未呀？」，又質問他們「搞初選嘅意義係乜嘢」，「到底點解香港人2020年需要搞一場初選？」，惟他們無回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，但鄒今早提及初選目的是取得過半議席，既然如此為何仍要問民主黨取得答案，鄒回應因他覺得初選意義「不在於此」，並理解「35+」為一個「大會嘅目的」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒指戴耀廷以時間有限擱置討論-終未達協議&quot;&gt;鄒指戴耀廷以時間有限擱置討論 終未達協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續指，之後還有其他人發表意見，「但我真係唔記得喇」，並指由戴耀廷提出該議題到爭拗接近尾聲大約歷時15至20分鐘，有人反對也有人支持，之後戴「就叫做出嚟打圓場咁啦」，表示「時間有限，仲有嘢未傾」、「之後有時間再傾」，並決定將此議題擱置，續討論論壇和替補機制事宜，最終沒有就否決權字眼舉行投票，亦沒有達成協議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，因此不是戴耀廷以「積極」用字嘗試迎合否決和不否決兩方的分歧？鄒指在新東第二次會議，「我的確唔覺得佢有咁嘅表現」，但戴在「打圓場」時有表示「『積極』比『冇』已經係行前一步」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒否認會上提無差別否決及癱瘓政府等-會後就不禮貌態度向戴道歉&quot;&gt;鄒否認會上提無差別否決及癱瘓政府等 會後就不禮貌態度向戴道歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問及，鄒家成在第二次會議有否提過會無差別否決預算案，及會用盡一切手段迫政府回應五大訴求，鄒否認，並指當時的爭拗主要關於審視預算案的標準，及批評泛民以往言行，而非爭取五大訴求的方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就黎敬輝筆記指鄒曾說「如我們不決意，如何說服香港人於初選投票，推我地入去立法會癱瘓政府」，鄒亦沒有說過，也沒說過癱瘓政府。陳慶偉望着鄒家成笑出聲，並問：「你肯定沒有？」鄒答：「係」，他亦不認識黎敬輝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，在會議完結後與戴耀廷有一個短暫對話，他向戴表示「我會參加初選」，並就剛才會上的不禮貌態度向他道歉，之後戴就叫了一個他不認識的人前來取得他的電話號碼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第99天。鄒家成繼續作供，就他在協調會議主張「會」否決預算案，鄒稱與「無差別」否決有別，因他目的是爭取五大訴求、以五大訴求為「唯一優先標準」審視財案，若預算案「一蚊都唔關（五大訴求）事」便要反對。鄒又強調，若政府落實五大訴求會在預算案反映，惟法官李運騰質疑鄒無做過立法會議員，法官陳慶偉亦提到過往曾主持的「鉛水事件」獨立調查委員會無列在預算案。鄒並指，會透過積極審議和將議會資訊帶去社區和網絡，向政府施壓要求回應五大訴求，但他無意以癱瘓立法會及要求特首下台為施壓手段，認為林鄭下台「冇意思」，「個制度一日唔變，邊個上台都一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，當局曾於2016年回覆議員就預算案的提問，指2016/2017年行政署「其他僱用服務及專業費用」較上一年度增加4,400萬，主因包括食水含鉛超標調查委員會所需法律服務開支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱會否決與無差別否決有別是以五大訴求為唯一優先標準審視財案&quot;&gt;鄒稱「會否決」與「無差別否決」有別、是以五大訴求為「唯一優先標準」審視財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成今作供，提及第二次新東協調會議上，曾就戴耀廷提出的「會積極運用《基本法》權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，動議改為「會」運用字眼，因認為不應用如此「模棱兩可」的字眼，但遭民主黨代表反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方大律師陳世傑續問，鄒提到的「會否決」和「無差別否決」一樣嗎？鄒說「唔一樣」，表示他所說的「會否決財政預算案」，目的是「爭取五大訴求」，「對我嚟講，就係以五大訴求作為唯一優先嘅標準，去審視財政預算案。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，即是作為談判籌碼？鄒指當時無特別去想是否談判籌碼，「我純粹覺得，群眾要求五大訴求，咁我哋就要入議會，為人民爭取五大訴求」，並解釋政府如在預算案有一些促成五大訴求落實的撥款內容，就會再根據整份預算案的利弊，再決定投票取態；而「如果審視完財政預算案，入面係一蚊都唔關事嘅話，我覺得就要投反對票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續解釋，他是第二次協調會議後才萌生這想法，認為是會上有關否決權的爭拗刺激到他有此想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱墨落無悔已向政府表明就財案看法談判存在於審視財案過程內&quot;&gt;鄒稱「墨落無悔」已向政府表明就財案看法、談判存在於審視財案過程內&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續關注預算案如何反映五大訴求，指首先政府已撤回《逃犯條例》，故不會在預算案反映，鄒同意。陳慶偉並指鄒當然要先向政府提出訴求並作商討，才會反映在預算案。鄒回應稱「墨落無悔」聲明書本身是一個公開及事先表達的立場，「我覺得呢個已經係向緊政府表達，我哋對財政預算案嘅睇法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒續認為，談判「根本就存在喺審視財政預算案嘅過程裡面」，指財政司司長發表預算案前，議員會收到司長二讀時發表的演辭，及牽涉每個部門撥款的管制人員報告，議員其後可向各部門提交書面提問，「基本上就問乜都得」，而之後進入特別財委會階段，「根本就係一個談判嘅階段」，在談判過程可看到預算案有否回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒引盧偉聰說法-指個人認為撤回612暴動定性早落實&quot;&gt;鄒引盧偉聰說法 指個人認為撤回612暴動定性早落實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉追問，但像「撤回暴動定性」如何反映在預算案？鄒提到第一次協調會議上，戴耀廷有就「五大訴求」發表意見，提及當時社會已在討論不用再提撤回612暴動定性，因不想影響爭取雙普選的進度；而鄒個人亦認為此訴求「一早已經落實咗」，指2019年6月12日後不久，時任警務處處長盧偉聰曾見記者說：「我唔係話大家係暴徒。」法官李運騰打斷，指不認為需知道所有細節，並指最終是否暴徒並不是警務處長決定，而是法庭決定。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 時任警務處處長 盧偉聰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並在法官追問下指，戴會上提到對五大訴求的理解，與他的理解並無不同，而戴當時並非談及參加初選資格，只是提到「出面有好多人爭取五大訴求、要求五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑鄒家成未做過立法會議員-如何得知預算案必反映五大訴求&quot;&gt;官質疑鄒家成未做過立法會議員 如何得知預算案必反映五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰亦追問，鄒是想看到政府花錢回應五大訴求、抑或想政府回應五大訴求？指兩者或不一樣。鄒回應：「以撥款嘅方式回應五大訴求，就係促成五大訴求嘅落實」。李運騰續說，但鄒從來無做過立法會議員，鄒說：「係，但我識得睇電視同睇 YouTube」，李再說：「所有人都可以，中學生都可以」，再指鄒未做過立法會議員。鄒續說：「正因為我唔係一個立法會議員，所以我會嘗試喺唔同嘅途徑去學習點樣做一個立法會議員，我中學嘅時候……」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟李運騰打斷，並說「我知道你想學習一些東西，亦有不少東西是你要學習，其中一樣就是聆聽問題」，並指其問題是鄒如何知道政府對五大訴求的回應必然會花錢，而即使要花錢，又必然會反映在預算案？鄒再回應指，財政預算案是政府未來如何用錢的計劃，「要落實五大訴求，就會喺 budget 反映」，鄒欲舉例，惟李運騰打斷指知道這是鄒當時所相信的就可以了&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官以鉛水事件為例-指獨立調查委員會訴求不會反映在預算案&quot;&gt;法官以「鉛水事件」為例 指「獨立調查委員會」訴求不會反映在預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後續問，成立獨立調查委員會的訴求，會如何反映在預算案。惟李運騰認為不需要問，指是鄒家成相信預算案會反映，而他不是會計、沒有金融背景、沒做過立法會議員，法庭只關注他當時的想法。鄒家成一度望向被告席方向搖頭苦笑，並主動謂：「如果覺得我講得好空泛，不如我試吓畀例子啦」，惟法官陳慶偉阻止，並主動提到他本人曾主持由前立法會議員黃碧雲有份要求成立、有關「鉛水事件」的獨立調查委員會，而該調查委員會從來沒有反映在預算案。陳慶偉提到黃碧雲時，黃一度在座位上舉手示意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KIcVDGF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
▲ 黃碧雲&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，他不是要批評鄒，只是以此為例，指「鉛水事件」突然出現，從沒有寫在任何預算案，因此即使當局回應鄒家成這個訴求，也不會反映在預算案。陳又指這可以是鄒家成的想法，「但我在告訴你我的真實經驗（“But I am telling you my real experience.”）」，又指獨立調查委員會涉數以千萬開支。陳說話時何桂藍不斷在位上說話，林卓廷和陳志全等亦有討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續表示，法庭並不關注鄒家成想法的對錯，而是關注他當刻所信的如何影響其行為，「他可能是對、可能是錯，但我們無需就此下決定。」陳世傑追問，因此該訴求可能或可能不會反映在預算案？鄒回應就「鉛水事件」的例子，獨立調查委員會是由立法會主導，該提案方式是不會在預算案顯示。李運騰重申不關注其想法對錯，而是他所相信的如何影響他行為，不用再深究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，食水含鉛超標調查委員會由行政長官會同行政會議根據《調查委員會條例》於2015年委任，獨立調查委員會相關開支，由財政預算案總目142「政府總部：政務司司長辦公室及財政司司長辦公室」下分目000「運作開支」中支付。當局曾於2016年回覆時任民主黨立法會議員單仲楷就預算案的提問，指2016/2017年行政署「其他僱用服務及專業費用」較上一年度增加4,400萬，主因包括食水含鉛超標調查委員會所需法律服務開支。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年，時任公民黨立法會議員陳淑莊在審議財政預算案時，亦曾向當局問及沙中線獨立調查委員會的開支，行政署長當時回覆指截至2019年2月28日，開支合共約3,550萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019年，時任公民黨立法會議員陳淑莊在審議財政預算案時，亦曾向當局問及沙中線獨立調查委員會的開支，行政署長當時回覆指截至2019年2月28日，開支合共約3,550萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成稱議會內寸土必爭以五大訴求為標準審視財案-迫政府回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;鄒家成稱議會內「寸土必爭」、以五大訴求為標準審視財案 迫政府回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒家成續表示，同意向政府施壓，迫使政府回應五大訴求。被問用什麼手段，鄒指涉他主張議會內「寸土必爭」的抗爭方式，即積極審議每一個議案和法案、積極提出修正案和私人草案，並將議會資訊帶去社區和提升到網絡層面，「希望借此產生一股更加強大制衡行政機關嘅力量，為落實五大訴求帶來可能」；至於另一手段就是已提及的「以五大訴求作為唯一優先標準，審視財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒並指，施壓手段不包括癱瘓立法會，亦不認為立法會會被癱瘓。陳世傑追問原因，鄒說「如果根據法庭一直講嗰個35+之後係癱瘓到立法會……」，惟李運騰即打斷，並以手指指向鄒家成嚴肅指出：「我必須澄清，法庭從來沒有這樣說過，你或許之前聽過，但這不是法庭的說法，你要非常清楚區分。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒說「明白，唔好意思」，續指就庭上聽到民主派取得35+後可癱瘓立法會的說法，「我認為唔可能，因為我覺得35+從來都唔可能」，又一度稱解散立法會權力「從來都喺特首度」。法官指解散立法會是另一回事，陳仲衡則指陳志全曾稱如立法會有35+，立法會或開不到會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒稱無意圖癱瘓立會及要求特首下台&quot;&gt;鄒稱無意圖癱瘓立會及要求特首下台&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;鄒說：「如果咁樣為之癱瘓立法會嘅話，咁我覺得係會有可能發生」，但指他從沒有意圖癱瘓立法會。至於以迫特首下台為手段來迫使政府回應五大訴求，鄒表示：「我從來冇打算要求林鄭下台，我覺得佢下台冇意思，個制度一日唔變，邊個上台都一樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳世傑續指將就「墨落無悔」聲明發問，望下一日處理。李運騰關注陳曾稱有200條問題，現時問了多少，陳指問到第46條，李問他能否再縮短提問，陳表示在嘗試。案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/BIc0FU6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（3日）踏入審訊第98天。控方引述陳志全街站發言，問他參選目標是否對抗「港共政權」，陳指民主派在議會的對手是建制派和政府，要求改變政策不完善之處、並就港人想得到的向政府施壓，「咁呢個係咪叫做對抗政權呢？如果呢個係咁咪係囉」。控方又質疑，陳於街站提到願望是達成35+，但沒提35+是無法實現，陳即反問：「當你生日許願話世界和平嘅時候，你覺得世界和平可唔可以達到吖？」，並指雖認為35+可能性低，但「贏到多過人哋咁梗係好事」、「係你個願望嚟咋嘛」。法官問他是「抱最好的希望，但做最壞的打算」？陳答：「我做人不嬲都係咁樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方引譚得志在初選論壇稱，會以否決預算案爭取五大訴求，及如政府「一人派十皮嘢」也會反對，陳否認代表其立場，直言「人人派十萬你都否決，畀人斬啊真係」。陳今完成3天作供，散庭後興奮說：「哇做完喇，真係開心喇！」，而下一名作供的被告鄒家成今特意穿上西裝上庭，他將於明天開始作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱抗爭到底是指盡力開會發言等-因有議員未盡全力抗爭&quot;&gt;陳稱「抗爭到底」是指盡力開會發言等 因有議員未盡全力抗爭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全今繼續接受盤問，開庭前，料在陳志全之後作供的鄒家成，首度身穿黑色西裝、打上黑色領帶入庭，多名旁聽人士起哄，紛紛驚嘆：「哇，好靚仔呀！」、「原來咁靚仔嘅！」，鄒微笑，有旁聽人士亦上前對他舉起拇指，鄒報以拇指微笑回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;開庭後，周天行再次引述昨播放陳2020年6月底的將軍澳街站片段，提到無論誰當選，「喺未來都要同心協力抗爭到底，包括我哋之前話，不惜運用基本法賦予立法會議員嘅權力，嚟去否決財政預算案，迫使林鄭月娥政府重啟政改，回應五大訴求，達至雙普選」，指陳的發言清楚說明「抗爭到底」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 副刑事檢控專員(V) 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳笑着反問：「你認為係咩呢？」李運騰指控方是指陳發言提到「抗爭到底」的意思，問抑或有其他意思。陳指昨日已看畢片段，強調「抗爭到底」意思就是議員要開會、加入委員會、發言質詢等，不可因作為少數派輸了，就說「你投我多啲，投我入去下次先可以改變到」；而陳推銷「抗爭到底」口號，是因過去有議員抗爭「未盡全力」、「未做足」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指雖以前提否決財案但林鄭無法話事-惟即使如此也要投票展現力量&quot;&gt;陳指雖以前提否決財案但林鄭無法話事 惟即使如此也要投票展現力量&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全續補充，「運用基本法權力，包括否決財政預算案」一說他當然在街站講過，「我都唔需要迴避呢樣嘢。」惟法官陳仲衡即指陳志全不是說「包括」否決財案，而是「不惜」否決，指兩者有別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全同意，但如昨日重申，他之後有說「今時今日依個 step 已經跳咗」，意思就是他以前雖在不同情況說過運用基本法權力否決預算案，但現在「我已經唔係同你講呢樣嘢、呢個唔係我嘅主題」；而他續提到林鄭月娥是「傀儡」，就是指「其實邊個做都係咁㗎啦，不過即使係咁，大家都要出嚟投票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問對抗林鄭無用應對抗中共-陳就算是傀儡不代表可完全不理&quot;&gt;控方問對抗林鄭無用應對抗中共？ 陳：就算是「傀儡」不代表可完全不理&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問何謂「邊個做都係咁」，陳解釋是指林鄭只是執行指令、「話唔到事」。李追問，意思是即使特首下台，也不會改變政府政策？陳指「我驚我過份解讀、為咗自己辯護咁樣，但應該有呢個意思囉」，並重申他當時是指無論如何，大家都要出來投票，「唔好講話要唔要政府回應、改變呀，（最低限度）都可以展現到香港人嘅力量。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行追問，因此陳志全意思是對抗（fight against）林鄭月娥無用，應對抗中共？陳說：「咁又絕對唔可以咁講」，並以修訂《逃犯條例》一事為例，指也是由林鄭月娥宣布「壽終正寢」。陳續說，雖然相信林鄭要有中央政府「首肯」才可做此決定，但在議會或香港「我哋對口單位都係特區政府」，「所以你又唔能夠話就算佢係傀儡，可以完全唔理佢，因為佢都係透過佢嘅手佢嘅口佢嘅政策，令到香港人生活可以改善。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦主動補充，就「包括我哋之前話」一句提到「我哋」，「我唔想拖其他人落水」，指他用「我哋」其實是令人「唔好覺得咁自我中心」的說法，「即係有時唔講『I』，講『we』咁解啫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳反問向政府施壓是否對抗政權指自己是可合作對象為鐵一般事實&quot;&gt;陳反問向政府施壓是否「對抗政權」、指自己是可合作對象為「鐵一般事實」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續引陳於街站提到，議會戰線是抗爭運動的一部分，而議席和議會均是「工具」，「抗爭至係我哋嘅目標，對付呢個港共政權，對付呢個國安惡法至係我哋嘅目標」。周指陳參加初選的目標，就是要對抗「港共政權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳回應，民主派作為反對派，在議會內的對手就是建制派和特區政府，他們每日都要「鬥智鬥力」找出政策上不完善之處要求改變，並向政府施壓要求落實港人想得到但政府不肯落實的事，「咁呢個係咪叫做對抗政權呢？如果呢個係咁咪係囉」。但陳補充，他與建制派和政府，很多情況下也要合作，才能達成改善港人生活的政策，而無論在建制派抑或政府官員之間，「我都係一個可以合作可以溝通嘅對象，呢個係鐵一般嘅事實。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全其後欲舉例，惟陳慶偉打斷，指明白陳過去會與政府合作、亦知道陳的往續，但陳同意他在街站上從沒有提及他會與政府合作通過議案，反而提到會對政權「抗爭到底」嗎？陳說「當然」，指當時街站除了呼籲在初選投票，亦是告知市民《國安法》的危險，並笑言：「當你講緊呢樣嘢嘅時候，你唔會再話我又同政府好合作、我又幫佢過過咩草案咁，咁好分裂㗎嘛個人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dT9Dfc7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 陳志全&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱議會戰線指積極發言提問不讓建制派快刀斬亂麻通過大量議案&quot;&gt;陳稱議會戰線指積極發言提問、不讓建制派「快刀斬亂麻」通過大量議案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續指，但「對付（港共政權）」一詞應與陳志全提到「議會戰線」、「抗爭」等一同解讀。陳回應在街站也有提及「唔好畀佢有好日子過」，意指如議員不在場、不積極提問發言，可能政府一日已可通過很多議案撥款，而「守住議會戰線」就是指「唔好畀佢快刀斬亂麻」，在港人不知情下通過很多撥款議案，舉例政府可能想一星期內通過議案，「咁我哋守住不斷發言或者提問就可以令佢兩三個禮拜過到」，亦是一直以來他講議會戰線的原則。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又主動指，以往民主派與建制派矛盾「冇咁大」時，可能立法會星期三黃昏就開完會；但他進入議會後，多數都要星期四下午或夜晚才開得完，「咁我話冇畀佢哋有好日子過呢，就係佢哋星期三晚想去馬場跑馬呢都去唔到。」陳欲再補充，惟陳慶偉打斷指相信已聽夠了。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑提35為願望但無提無法實現-陳生日許願世界和平你覺得可否達到&quot;&gt;控方質疑提35+為願望但無提無法實現 陳：生日許願世界和平你覺得可否達到？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續引陳志全街站提及今年有3個願望：「第一個當然係民主派嘅議席過半；第二呢，我係希望快必可以當選；第三呢，先至到我自己連任。」周質疑早前稱認為35+機會很微的陳，提到願望是達成35+，但卻從沒有提及35+是無法實現（not achievable），陳志全即加快語速反問：「當你生日許願話世界和平嘅時候，你覺得世界和平可唔可以達到吖？」被告席的鄒家成微笑以手勢示意陳冷靜。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續指，可以理解陳的答案是「不」？陳欲解釋，惟法官李運騰打斷，指不認為證人需要再解釋，指：「願望是一個渴望，能否達成是另一回事。（“A wish is a desire, whether it is achievable is a different aspect.”）」陳慶偉續問，那陳志全在街站是說自己也不相信的話嗎？陳指認為「希望」和「相信」沒有衝突，雖然認為35+可能性很低，「但係呢個贏多一席得一席、贏到多過人哋咁梗係好事嚟㗎，咁係你個願望嚟咋嘛。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指發言最後也有提到對於有人說35+，「得到咁梗係好啦」，但「就算唔得，我哋都要好努力喺議會裡面工作」，並重申「就算覺得佢（35+）唔能夠得到或者唔係好大可能性，但係希望得到呢個，係冇衝突囉我覺得」。法官陳仲衡問，所以陳志全是「抱最好的希望，但做最壞的打算（“So you were hoping for the best, but prepared for the worst?”）」？陳回應：「我做人不嬲都係咁樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問陳是否知戴耀廷對35目標看法-官打斷稱已問過&quot;&gt;控方問陳是否知戴耀廷對35+目標看法 官打斷稱已問過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續再問及陳志全對初選目的之認知，問陳是否知道戴耀廷於7月6日記者會，提到35+目標是運用基本法賦予的權力否決預算案，迫特首下台。陳指無看記者會直播、僅看事後報導，當時無特別留意。李運騰續問，由3月至7月，陳知道戴形容否決權為「大殺傷力憲制武器」嗎？陳重申從報導或「攬炒十步」文章知道大約意思，「但係咪 exact wording 我講唔到。」周再問，而陳同意戴有關35+目標的想法？惟陳慶偉打斷指昨天已問過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周再問陳是否知道戴於7月9日記者會，亦提及35+目標是取得立會主導權，行使憲制權力令港府問責，陳指不記得，因戴「講嚟講去都係嗰啲，都係差唔多㗎啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方就譚得志論壇發言發問-官指兩人同政黨不代表譚代表陳說話&quot;&gt;控方就譚得志論壇發言發問 官指兩人同政黨不代表譚代表陳說話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後就選舉論壇發問，周天行指沒爭議譚得志6月26日出席九東論壇，而陳志全出席6月28日新東論壇，並向陳指「兩者相隔兩日」，惟法官陳仲衡即不耐煩說：「你不需問這問題，對嗎？（“You don’t need to ask that question, do you?”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全在盤問下指，事前沒有與譚得志討論他論壇上會說什麼。周天行問，陳對譚論壇上要說的話不感興趣？陳答：「我哋唔係第一次選舉，選舉都係各自照顧自己，邊有咁得閒去傾吓你個論壇講咩、我個論壇講咩啫。」周追問二人屬同一政黨，不需商討出一致的做法嗎？惟陳慶偉即打斷說「thank you」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳志全稱無與譚得志討論論壇發言&quot;&gt;陳志全稱無與譚得志討論論壇發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續在盤問下指，沒有看九東論壇，但譚得志去完後有告訴陳自己「畀黃之鋒捅咗一嘢」，指黃「話佢（譚）曾經鬧過梁天琦係『無賴本土派』，問佢認唔認、問佢會唔會道歉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周欲追問，惟法官李運騰打斷，要求控方交代盤問的相關性，指兩人同屬一個政黨，不代表譚得志是代表陳志全說話，周回應會在結案陳詞處理。李運騰再指，控方要記住法庭已裁定「共謀者原則」並不適於《國安法》前的言行，除非有基礎譚得志在論壇上是代表陳志全說話。陳慶偉亦着控方直接問問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問譚得志提否決財案是否陳立場-陳人人派十萬都否決畀人斬啊真係&quot;&gt;控方問譚得志提否決財案是否陳立場 陳：人人派十萬都否決，畀人斬啊真係&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示謄本，譚得志提及：「如果我真係有幸入到去，兩次否決《財政預算案》丶癱瘓個政府、林鄭柒婆落台嚟到做 bargaining power（籌碼），爭取五大訴求、缺一不可，尤其是係獨立調查委員會，查嗰個警暴嘅問題，同埋公民提名嘅雙真普選」，又指「如果嗰個財政預算案，每個香港人派一幢樓喎、一人派十皮嘢喎咁，即係志偉呀，同埋阿文豪嗰啲，就平時都反對派錢㗎喇，但係今次派十皮嘢喎咁點呀？一樣反對，因為呢個係我哋嘅選舉承諾」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行問，這也是陳志全參與初選的立場？陳大聲答：「絕對不是呀，呢個仲違反人民力量所講嘅『全民直接回水』」，指人力「爭取咗咁多年」，由「Day 1」已要財政司司長「回水」，「人人派十萬你都否決，畀人斬啊真係」，林卓廷說「哇」。陳續說，譚從來沒有向他講過「人人派層樓、或者人人派十萬」也會否決財政預算案，「我覺得佢都可能係即場爆肚，不過我唔幫佢解釋啦，唔揣測。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳志全作供完畢-料明由鄒家成作供&quot;&gt;陳志全作供完畢 料明由鄒家成作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周最後指出，陳在2020年7月1日至2021年1月7日，與其他被告同意立會過半後無差別否決預算案，以迫使政府回應五大訴求，陳說「絕不同意」。周再指陳意圖顛覆國家政權，陳再說「不同意」，控方表示完成盤問。馬維騉表示沒有覆問，陳完成作供，微笑手執水杯和背包步入被告席，坐下後與鄒家成說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/JdEvrfm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉表示完成辯方案情，料由鄒家成作供。代表鄒的大律師陳世傑表示，需更多時間索取指示，望押至明早開始案情。李運騰指望辯方能令主問盡量簡短，陳說：「你知道我會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;散庭後，鄒家成向律師雙手合十，又主動搭陳志全的肩膊，步入囚室前李予信與鄒簡單交談。陳志全步出被告欄時，則興奮說：「哇做完喇，真係開心喇！」&lt;/p&gt;

As African leaders make their way back from the Russia–Africa Summit in St Petersburg, will we get hints about the company’s future on the continent and how should others respond?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 27 July African leaders made their way to St Petersburg for the second Russia–Africa Summit. The first summit four years ago majored on trade, investment and development. These are issues of concern to Africa but the agenda was Moscow’s. Discussions this time will be tainted by African states’ growing agitation at their place in the world, the economic costs of the Ukraine War, and by persistent problems of insecurity across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wagner Group has been one of many imperfect answers to insecurity in Africa, or at least regime insecurity. Starting in Sudan, Wagner has been developing its presence on the continent since 2017. Under the Omar Al-Bashir government the company trained the Sudanese armed forces, guarded mineral resources and helped to suppress political opposition. In what has become a familiar pattern, Wagner received exclusive access to mineral and resource extraction by occupying mines and agreeing special deals and concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working alongside front and sister companies, since then the company has sold a menu of services to embattled African governments, including strategic communications, close protection, military training, offensive military operations and logistics. The Touadéra government in the Central African Republic (CAR) signed a contract with Wagner in 2018. Although now fully reliant on Wagner for regime security, it has survived despite effective state failure. In 2019 an ill-fated Wagner deployment to Mozambique saw company fighters bested by an Islamist insurgency. The company also supported rebel Libyan Arab Armed Forces. In Mali since 2021, Wagner has propped up the military government with force and crafted strategic communication campaigns that helped to exacerbate anti-French sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;understanding-the-appeal&quot;&gt;Understanding the Appeal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, Wagner has been effective in quelling insurgency and bolstering government authority, although not necessarily legitimacy. It has faced accusations of human rights abuses and international humanitarian law violations on several occasions. In Mali and CAR the UN working group on the use of mercenaries called for investigations following a number of reported rapes, attacks and killings of civilians. Among other things, in Libya in 2020 Wagner was accused of using landmines that killed civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;In some cases, Wagner has been effective in quelling insurgency and bolstering government authority, although not necessarily legitimacy. It has faced accusations of human rights abuses and international humanitarian law violations on several occasions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the country-level, Wagner’s services are marketed by Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) representatives within embassies. Host governments such as CAR and Mali have agreements not with Wagner but with the Russian government. The government-to-government negotiations have allowed Wagner and linked Russian companies to benefit financially. Exploitation of commodities such as gold or timber in Sudan or CAR has in turn contributed to Russia’s sanction-busting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Wagner has also proven an effective foreign policy tool. In recent years, Africa was not high on Moscow’s priority list, but the Ukraine War gave it added significance. Russia has tried to win the narrative argument with key African states to avoid isolation. Both the St Petersburg Summit and Wagner are part of a “charm offensive”. With some success, Russia brands itself as an anti-colonial friend to African governments, untainted in comparison to France, the UK and the rest. The Wagner operation in Mali for example helped to change attitudes to the UN and French security missions, paving the way for France’s humiliating exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For selected African governments, then, the package of services on offer has proved appealing. Lectured by domestic and external critics, unable to persuade the UN or allies such as France to fight and die at scale in the face of insurgencies, they have been offered regime protection – at a price. Investigations have illustrated the risks associated with Wagner, but these are largely borne by marginalised populations in the periphery of host countries. Lawlessness may actually be an attraction in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implications-of-the-prigozhin-mutiny&quot;&gt;Implications of the Prigozhin Mutiny&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moscow knows that African host governments viewed its handling of the mutiny closely. Two days later, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov used Russia Today to reassure Mali and CAR that Wagner’s “work” in both countries would continue. It was therefore reassuring that around 500 new personnel arrived in CAR on a scheduled rotation in mid-July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, so good? Perhaps. But behind the scenes at the summit a sub-set of African leaders will press for clarity on Wagner’s continental operations. Yevgeny Prigozhin was on hand in St Petersburg to meet government representatives, and presumably to court new suitors. The target list could include a dozen or more states with whom there have been reports of Wagner interaction, from Zimbabwe, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and South Africa. The embattled military government of Burkina Faso and the fledgling junta in Niger will be front-runners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-scenarios&quot;&gt;Future Scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin will not “abandon” Africa – that would taint its burgeoning brand as a trusted partner for needy governments. But that tells us little about Wagner which is being restructured and largely absorbed into the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Kremlin will not “abandon” Africa – that would taint its burgeoning brand as a trusted partner for needy governments&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One scenario is that the company is disbanded. There are around 20 other companies linked to the Russian government that could play “host” to Wagner personnel and services. Three are controlled by Gazprom, one by Rosatom. By going down this route, the Russian government would retain Wagner’s capabilities and might even enhance the aspect of deniability that has proven useful in the past. But the move would be disruptive. African field operations are managed by men loyal to Prigozhin, such as Dmitri Utkin or Ivan Aleksandrovich Maslov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if Wagner is downsized in Europe but licensed to continue its overseas operations, perhaps Prigozhin could remain at the helm in Belarus. The Kremlin could also reduce any residual risks that it felt around Prigozhin’s leadership by hiving off some of the “menu” of services to sister companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several factors will shape the direction of travel from now on. The fate of Russia’s combat operations in Ukraine will be one. A sound defeat for Russia in Ukraine would probably spell an end to Wagner’s Africa operations. But this is looking very unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second is resourcing. Until now, the Russian government has not had the bandwidth or resources to invest heavily in Africa and has had to subsidise the company nearly $1 billion per annum despite its income-generation schemes. With the Russian economy in a growth phase, there could be fresh resource on offer to promote or to support Wagner in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third issue will be the Kremlin’s overall prioritisation of Africa. The continent has been a low priority overall, hence the “outsourcing” of policy to the MFA. Whether or not the Kremlin takes a stronger hand in future, the tone and the commitments announced at the summit indicate a sharper focus by Russia. But the events in Niger also highlight the importance of elite and public opinion on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wagner-in-context&quot;&gt;Wagner in Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week a UK Foreign Affairs Committee report charged the UK government with having for a decade “under-played and under-estimated the Wagner Network’s activities, as well as the security implications of its significant expansion”. It lamented the early withdrawal of UK troops from Mali in 2022 and pushed for further information on how the government will “tackle the challenge of states’ malign use of proxy PMCs”. The UK and the US have now sanctioned Wagner members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the report, coupled with events in St Petersburg will prompt some reflection. Wagner is a player in selected parts of Africa, and a feature of Russia’s foreign policy toolkit. But its wider importance can be exaggerated. A quick internet search throws up a small selection of the numerous private security and military operations in Africa which originate everywhere from Israel to France, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wagner may be projecting Russian foreign policy goals but it is useful to see it in this wider context. Wagner is one of many private military companies operating in Africa. When taken together with other admittedly very different “non-state” security providers and interventions (peacekeeping and stabilisation missions, train and equip projects, private security companies and community militias) it is striking how little has been achieved in improving security in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Western countries and the UN should be reflecting. They will not and should not match the Wagner offer. Sending troops or mercenaries to fight and advise during aggressive counterinsurgency operations is not on the cards for most. But hard thinking is needed about the persistent insecurity that Wagner and others latch on to. Better external security assistance – well mandated and overseen – can help. But there are also some uncomfortable truths that need airing about everything from state corruption, to extractive economic relations, destabilising military interventions as well as previous reluctance to resource peacebuilding or to back the regulation of private military and security operations. It may be too early to predict Wagner’s next move but the continent will remain open for the security business until all this changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yiqB3vi.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（2日）踏入審訊第97天。陳志全今開始接受盤問，就法官關注初選是以立會過半為手段，達至否決預算案的目的，陳表示由始至終不認同否決預算案是初選目的，指理解初選最終目的就是贏得最多議席向政府施壓，要求回應五大訴求等。陳又指，取得過半自然有很多權力，「你唔講，政府都知道你有咩權力」，但認為否決預算案是很遙遠的事，當時想法是「選到至算」。法官問否決預算案是否迫使政府回應的最強大權力，陳指理論上很多人以為是，但操作上則不然，解釋若民主派過半，拒絕合作湊夠35人的法定開會人數，建制派連啟動會議的能力都沒有，「第一日都唔知開唔開到會」，財政預算案「首讀二讀都讀唔到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，陳表示不知道有新東協議文件，指該文件提到會派7張名單，但他認知一直是派6張名單，強調新東能獲6席已是奇蹟，若派7張名單會有很大風險，如他看過「一定會出聲」。陳亦強調，簽署「墨落無悔」聲明是因認同當中兩點聲明，而非因是協調會議共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱於2016年起任人力主席-直至被捕後退出人力&quot;&gt;陳稱於2016年起任人力主席 直至被捕後退出人力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉今早表示已完成主問，陳志全先接受李予信一方盤問，再接受主控周天行盤問。陳在控方盤問下指，應於2016年起任人民力量主席，直至2021年被捕後退出人力。他記不清譚得志何時開始任副主席，但一定是於2020年前，解釋自己本來打算做兩年主席再交予譚，但譚當時說「未ready」，「咁我唯有做多兩年。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 譚得志（左）、陳志全（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問譚是否於整個2020年都任副主席，陳說「應該都係」，並補充於原定的立法會選舉日2020年9月6日，「佢就被捕收押到而家喇。」翻查資料，譚當天因煽動罪被捕，後因該案及初選案還柙至今。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於曾代表陳出席新東會議的蘇浩，陳指他應於2018至2021年任人力副主席，是自己其中一個議員助理，指「每個同事都係向我負責」。至於曾帶證人X出席新西會議的梁家聲，陳記得他2020至2021年是人力執委。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問何時決定參加初選-陳如搞得成初選冇乜得揀都要參與&quot;&gt;被問何時決定參加初選 陳：如搞得成初選，冇乜得揀都要參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問何時決定參加初選，陳志全指「好難講話邊一日」，因民主派都知道該段日子正在辦初選，「如果係傾得成嘅話，咁我哋九成都係會參加㗎喇。」陳並指在庭上才得知有2020年1月飯局，而新東4月14日首次協調會議時，「唔係100%我諗都係8、90%（打算參與初選）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問譚得志何時決定參加初選，陳指要視乎九東何時決定辦初選，又指「其實我哋都係如果個初選搞得成，都冇乜得揀㗎嘛，都要參與」，並謂「可能我哋真係太熟喇，大家都假定大家會參加，冇問你參唔參加，我參唔參加咁」，加上執委會亦有討論，故譚無在某一日向他表明會參加。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱黨內參選需決議-指不能黑箱作業幾個人圍威喂&quot;&gt;陳稱黨內參選需決議 指不能「黑箱作業」幾個人「圍威喂」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問二人參選有否黨的正式決議，陳說人民力量是一個很細的組織，「但係呢我哋啲功夫都會做嘅」，確認初選前其中一次執委會會議有公告決定，人力派他們兩人出選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指雖大家都知人民力量只有他和譚得志會參選立會，「但係我哋唔可以話黑箱作業咁，自己執委會幾個人圍威喂就話我哋出選喇咁樣」，故此前有發訊息予所有會員問有否興趣參與立選及初選，但直至5月13日執委會會議也未有人報名，故昨展示的會議紀錄提到立法會選舉「黨內初選」暫時無會員報名。陳並形容，此操作目的「就係唔好後來畀人話你哋自己決定晒啲嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱初選目的是令民主派取得最多議席-惟無大殺傷力憲制武器概念&quot;&gt;陳稱初選目的是令民主派取得最多議席 惟無「大殺傷力憲制武器」概念&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問及初選目的，展示戴耀廷3月22日發布的〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉，問陳志全有否看過。陳說不記得，並主動指「你逐篇問我我真係唔記得，但我肯定我睇過『攬炒十步』嗰篇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續確認，有看過3月26日戴耀廷等人所召記者會的報導，周天行遂指戴會上提及立會過半為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，問陳是否知道35+計劃的目標就是取得「大殺傷力憲制武器」，包括否決預算案的權力。陳說「周生嘅問題不斷強調嗰個憲制性武器」，但他不記得相關報導有否引述此說法；又指他當時知道初選目的就是令民主派取得最多議席，「如果議席過半，有好多嘢都可以做到」，但並無「大殺傷力憲制武器」的概念，對此也無特別想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱否決財案並非35計劃目的-終極目的是施壓要求政府回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;陳稱否決財案並非35+計劃目的 終極目的是施壓要求政府回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續問，而陳知道35+計劃的目標（objective）是要取得否決權？陳慶偉糾正指初選目標是取得過半數，並指那只是用來達到目的之手段（a means to an end），而目的包括否決預算案。惟陳志全即表示：「由始至終我都唔認同嗰個end、嗰個目的係否決財政預算案喎」。陳慶偉說：「其中一個目的」，惟陳志全再說：「嗰個唔係end、唔係目的嚟㗎喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，那陳志全理解初選最終目的是什麼？陳回應：「最終極嘅目的咪就係贏到最多嘅議席，跟住可以畀到最大嘅壓力比政府，要佢回應，其中最主要嘅就係五大訴求囉」，並補充此整體概念並非單從記者會報導而得知。周追問，而迫使政府回應五大訴求的「目標」是否決預算案？陳慶偉糾正是「手段」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指否決是好遙遠嘅嘢選到至算&quot;&gt;陳指否決是「好遙遠嘅嘢」、「選到至算」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全回應，「你攞到過半你自然有好多權力」，其中一個權力是否決預算案，而以他的認知、理解或者相信，如民主派僥倖取得35席以上，「由開票嗰剎那，你唔講，政府都知道你有咩權力啦。」陳又強調，「唔係去到話出年嘅4、5月先至去做嘢，而係整個過程」，解釋開票後政府已要找不同陣營去傾，否決預算案只是「其中一樣嘢，而且係好遙遠嘅一樣嘢」，「即係當其時我嘅諗法就係選到至算啦！你講到上天落水都係咁話啦！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問否決財案是否迫政府回應最強大權力-陳稱建制35-連會都開唔成&quot;&gt;官問否決財案是否迫政府回應最強大權力 陳稱建制35-連「會都開唔成」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問，那陳志全認為《基本法》賦予立法會的權力中，否決預算案是迫使政府回應五大訴求的最強大（powerful）權力嗎？陳搖頭說：「概念上、理論層面上，可能好多人都以為係，但係操作層面上，其實唔係囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續着法官「畀多少少時間我，畀少少耐性」，並解釋35+下政府面對的問題，是支持政府的建制派不足35席。陳續解釋立法會法定人數為全體議員一半，即35席，故如民主派不合作湊夠法定人數，「其實單憑建制派，係連啟動會議嘅能力都冇。」陳又指，「如果建制派係35-嘅話，佢哋連法定人數都唔足夠，如果民主派唔幫手湊法定人數，根本個會都開唔成，連個財政預算案嚟立法會首讀二讀都讀唔到！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問，但若沒有否決預算案兩次，就不會造成特首下台？陳志全答：「根據嗰個《基本法》嘅條文係。」陳慶偉續向陳志全說：「我想我知道你在說什麼，你說沒有35席，立法會不能開會，故根本無需否決，因為根本不能討論預算案」，陳志全說：「係第一日都唔知開唔開到會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指情況可能是這樣，但陳仲衡意思是「特首依然會是特首」。陳志全說：「係，大家坐喺度你眼望我眼咁樣」，陳慶偉笑說不，因為沒有召開會議，「你們可能透過電視你眼望我眼」，陳笑說「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱譚得志曾告知九東會另交文件-惟無討論亦無看過內容&quot;&gt;陳稱譚得志曾告知九東會另交文件 惟無討論亦無看過內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;另外，參選九東的譚得志提交表格時附上共同綱領，陳指曾獲譚告知九東會交多一份文件，他當時掌握不到是否叫「共同綱領」，並僅回應「我哋新東就冇喎」，而二人無討論文件內容，他亦沒問譚拿文件來看，指選舉期間二人「各自照顧自己嘅嘢」，沒有討論政綱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳在盤問下也指不知該共同綱領上的條款是九東共識。周天行問即譚沒告訴他？陳說「其實佢知唔知道我都唔知」，笑言譚有否出席九東協調會抑或由其他人代出席，「我到今日都搞唔清楚。」陳亦指，當時沒有主動問代表他出席新東會議的蘇浩，新東有否類似文件，笑指「如果有佢就話畀我知啦，冇理由有，佢唔話畀我知㗎嘛」，蘇亦已在執委會報告。陳指區諾軒亦沒有告知他新東有類似文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱不知新東協議文件-指如看過定會出聲-因新東派7席好大風險&quot;&gt;陳稱不知新東協議文件 指如看過定會出聲 因新東派7席好大風險&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳盤問下續指，不知道有「民主派新界東協調機制協議」文件，而除提名表格外，亦無印象從組織者收過其他文件。陳昨供稱，理解初選共識是辦公民投票、目標議席數量、以靈童制為替補機制和辦選舉論壇4點，他今補充對當中目標議席數目也「有啲糊塗、或者唔係好清晰」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋，蘇浩曾提及新東最嚴謹，他理解是目標議席為6席就派6張名單出選，惟控方展示的協議文件卻提到首7張名單可參選。陳指「如果我當其時睇到呢張嘢，我一定會出聲囉」，並指他對該4點共識「其實真係好模糊㗎，因為連議席都有個問號仔喺度㗎」。法官指文件提到目標議席6席，只是派出7張名單，陳是對出選名單數目不確定，陳同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳並指，他首次得悉可派7張名單出選，是在初選完結後，排第7的范國威也報名參加正式選舉，而他初選論壇時「冇諗過呢條問題」，因一直認為新東能獲6席已是奇蹟，「保住6席已經係個目標喇」，而派7張名單報名「真係會有好大嘅風險，係連6席都保唔到嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑陳志全早知派7張名單出選-陳可能講錯&quot;&gt;控方質疑陳志全早知派7張名單出選 陳：可能講錯&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後引述陳於6月底的街站片段，提到民主動力宣布新東有12張參選名單，會從中「選出7張參與9月立法會選舉」，質疑陳當時已知道有7張名單。陳指「而家諗返可能係嗰陣時講錯囉」，指該街站是一兩個小時的街站，「我係冇稿，隨心咁揸住個咪不停不停咁講嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又強調，一直認知新東是派6張名單，重申新東取得6席已是奇蹟，「7席係接近冇可能，甚至係會有反效果」，並記得初選後他曾做訪問提到勝出的6人「拖住手一齊贏」，惟其後排第7的范國威發訊息給他說：「慢必，你咁講我唔使選啦！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳確認同意墨落兩點聲明遂簽署-理解聲明我們是指抗爭派&quot;&gt;陳確認同意「墨落」兩點聲明遂簽署 理解聲明「我們」是指抗爭派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「墨落無悔」聲明，控方問陳志全是否將自己與抗爭派連繫（associate yourself）？陳不同意。李運騰指「連繫」可有很不同的意思，若控方只是說陳認同（endorse）聲明，是並無爭議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引聲明提到戴耀廷前一日召記者會表示不會要求參選人簽署共同綱領，問陳是否知道。陳指當然他簽署時，「我有成個聲明䁽過嘅」，但他簽名就是同意聲明書中的兩點聲明，至於兩點外其他字，「其實我係冇好嚴謹咁去考究。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而對聲明中多次用「我們」，陳指「嗰啲我都係理解為佢哋嘅聲明，佢哋講嘅嘢」，即草擬聲明書的「抗爭派」，但他當時無考究誰執筆寫該聲明書。陳又指，他不肯定當時有否看畢6月9日記者會或知戴有這樣提過，但笑指「佢咁樣寫出嚟，我諗佢都唔會屈阿戴耀廷無中生有啩」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指簽署墨落時無考慮是否協調會議共識&quot;&gt;陳指簽署「墨落」時無考慮是否協調會議共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎」，陳重申「共識」就是蘇浩告知他辦初選的4點共識。周天行續問，「墨落」兩點聲明與陳提到的4點共識如何相關？法官李運騰指，控方是問陳確認的4點共識並不包括「墨落」的兩點（即會運用基本法權力和支持度不足須停止選舉工程），為何仍會認同這篇聲明？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就支持度不足須停止選舉工程一點，陳指「願賭服輸」是「成個初選嘅精神嚟㗎嘛」，「應承咗如果輸就唔選，呢個係好正常嘅嘢。」陳又強調他簽署聲明是因認為該兩點「冇乜問題」，但就沒有如控方般分析，他同意的兩點「唔係所謂嘅初選協調會議共識」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指簡言之，即陳認同這份聲明，是因為他同意這兩點？陳同意。李追問，而不是因為在協調會議有協議？陳停頓了約5秒，說他能知道協調會上的事情是相當有限，「啫係如果你話最嚴謹，就係叫返蘇浩嚟問呢兩點協調會有冇傾過呀」，但他沒有這樣做，並補充他只有在不同意或對某點質疑或猶豫時，才會向蘇查詢。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳重申不認為墨落綑綁否決財案-控方欲追問遭官質疑不明白證人證供&quot;&gt;陳重申不認為「墨落」綑綁否決財案 控方欲追問遭官質疑不明白證人證供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳其後重申，不認為「墨落無悔」是指「贏咗選舉嘅人要一致投票去否決財政預算案」，認為聲明意思是要運用基本法賦予的權力去爭取五大訴求，而其中一樣是否決預算案的權力。周天行再問，但35+計劃的目的，不就是取得參與者共識去取得立會過半嗎？陳說：「咁『35+計劃』話明『35+』，梗係希望攞多一席得一席，就係希望攞到35+啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周再指因此他不太明白陳為何說35+計劃不是綑綁所有當選人，惟陳慶偉打斷指這是兩回事，反問「你明白他的證供嗎，周先生？」，周說他明白，他正嘗試澄清，惟陳說沒有事要澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;人力墨落配圖寫團結必須共同綱領-陳指為對民主派期望不代表已達到&quot;&gt;人力「墨落」配圖寫「團結必須共同綱領」 陳指為對民主派期望不代表已達到&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示人民力量 Facebook 有黃底黑字「團結必須 共同綱領」的配圖，問與陳昨提到的「共同政治行動綱領」是否一樣。陳解釋圖片是他和譚簽「墨落無悔」後義工製作的配圖，他理解是強調一直以來對民主派合作的期望，「如果我哋要合作、我哋要畀外界覺得我哋團結，我哋就要共同綱領囉。」陳又指以此圖作為「墨落」配圖，不代表「墨落」已達到他對共同政治行動綱領的期許，只是重申如民主派要合作要予市民團結感覺。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳確認為新東whatsapp群組成員與戴耀廷通唔夠5個訊息&quot;&gt;陳確認為新東WhatsApp群組成員、與戴耀廷通唔夠5個訊息&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉亦一度關注，陳志全是否認識戴耀廷。陳指「叫做識啦，我諗從政嘅人個個都會認識呢個人」，並指他有戴的電話，但直至今日「夾埋通過唔夠5個 message」，他亦不知戴和蘇浩有否溝通。陳並指譚得志認識戴，亦應互相有電話，指佔中時戴曾辦很多商討日，「譚得志係比較熱衷同戴教授商討嘅。」陳另確認他是新東信息發布區群組成員，控方指陳在群組與組織者溝通，陳說：「我只能夠話我係呢個 WhatsApp 群組嘅成員囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李予信一方展示立會投票紀錄-指公民黨投票立場不一致&quot;&gt;李予信一方展示立會投票紀錄 指公民黨投票立場不一致&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，代表李予信的大律師關文渭今早盤問陳志全時，展示2016年《醫生註冊修訂條例草案》二讀的投票紀錄，指公民黨有人投贊成、反對和棄權；至於2017年《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集修訂條例草案》，關指當時法律界不支持，而公民黨除時任法律界議員郭榮鏗投棄權，其餘議員均投贊成。陳志全確認並指類似情況「唔係少出現」，很多時功能組別不會跟大隊投票，會因業界利益而棄權或「行咗去唔投票唔表態」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;關文渭欲再展示另一投票紀錄，惟法官問及相關性。關解釋是有關鄭達鴻提到公民黨的「豁免跟隨黨立場投票機制」，望顯示直至2020年6月，公民黨仍然不一致投票。惟李運騰質疑，陳志全如何得知該些議員申請了豁免、或出現該些情況是因運用了該機制，陳慶偉亦指可能該議員是與黨爭論並主動違背黨立場。陳慶偉續問有沒有人質疑沒有豁免機制，關說沒有，陳說「正是！那問來有什麼意思？」，關說是要證人確認該紀錄，陳再問為何要他確認，關續指完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（2日）踏入審訊第97天。陳志全接受盤問，法官關注陳於2020年6月底初選街站提及「不惜」運用基本法權力，以否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，陳強調他當時是鼓勵選民投票，或「隨口噏」。庭上續播放街站完整片段，陳志全提到以往參選如「爭獎牌」，但今時今日是「爭住去犧牲」，並指當時擺街站遭警察抄身分證，亦可能有拍片，但他說「你唔使拍我吖」，指「無論係DQ嘅罪證又好，未來呢個國安惡法嘅罪證又好，我哋都係光明正大嘅」，有被告聞言發笑。陳在街站又質疑，國安法指定法官由特首揀選，一定是選被告斬人也讚他有「高尚情操」的法官；又批評《國安法》如「強姦香港市民」之餘還要說是「性交轉運」，指香港人「最低限度都要識嗌唔好」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方問陳是否代表人民力量-官指受審是被告非人民力量&quot;&gt;控方問陳是否代表人民力量 官指受審是被告非人民力量&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續就陳志全6月底的將軍澳街站發問，指他提到「抗爭到底」，陳指是選舉口號。周天行問該口號是否陳志全、譚得志和人民力量的口號，陳笑說：「其實冇分得咁清楚，我又係人民力量，快必又係人民力量」。周指，故陳說的話代表人民力量？惟李運騰打斷周天行：「為何你對於被告是否代表人民力量這麼執着（obsessed）？最終受審的是這名被告，不是人民力量。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;街站提否決財案迫林鄭回應五大訴求-陳重申為鼓勵選民投票&quot;&gt;街站提否決財案迫林鄭回應五大訴求 陳重申為鼓勵選民投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周續引述陳志全曾於街站提及：「今次大家搞初選，已經將個人或者黨派嘅利益係放埋一邊㗎喇，無論邊個出線邊個當選，喺未來都要同心協力抗爭到底，包括我哋之前話，不惜運用基本法賦予立法會議員嘅權力，嚟去否決財政預算案，迫使林鄭月娥政府重啟政改，回應五大訴求，達至雙普選。」周問「抗爭到底」的口號，是否包括否決預算案，迫使政府回應五大訴求？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指不同意，又稱「嗱我都預咗你會問我呢題，但你都唔可以淨係睇呢一句嘅」，並重申昨已提到在街站或宣傳片均有提及35+可做到的事，但不會講得「太過誇或者實得」，以免予選民「empty promise（空頭支票）」。陳並建議法庭留意他完整發言，指他說出上述發言後，有提及「但係今時今日似乎呢個 step 已經跳咗喇」，着選民不要太大期望，因林鄭月娥已變成「話唔到事」的「中共傀儡」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指當天街站主軸是鼓勵人投票，「對峙一啲無力感，對峙一啲覺得投票冇用、議會冇用嘅人」，強調就算達不到35+、不能令林鄭回應，初選如果有很多人出來投票，已是選民力量的展現，比起建制派指「簽咗百幾萬嘅簽名（支持《國安法》）運動」的力量「大好多」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官關注陳志全提不惜是準備好運用否決權-陳指隨口噏&quot;&gt;法官關注陳志全提「不惜」是準備好運用否決權 陳指「隨口噏」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡關注，陳志全提到「不惜」，故不只是以此作為《基本法》權力的例子，而是表示已準備好運用否決權。陳指可能現時「睇文字就好似個語氣係重啲」，並問能否回放片段，因當天「冇稿冇盛，我當時就係隨口咁樣噏出嚟」。陳仲衡指，是辯方大狀馬維騉決定不播片。陳指片段很長，他不是強烈要求法庭要立即看，也不想浪費法庭時間。惟陳慶偉指這並非浪費時間，並要求播放全長38分鐘的片段。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳街站指以往議員爭獎牌今時今日爭住去犧牲&quot;&gt;陳街站指以往議員「爭獎牌」、今時今日「爭住去犧牲」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續播放片段，陳志全提及香港人過去一年「變咗好多」，「返唔到轉頭」，故要「抗爭到底」，而抗爭包括街頭、網上、議會、國際和黃色經濟圈戰線，強調每一條戰線都要盡最大努力，入到議會要盡全力抗爭，與港共政權、中共抗爭到底。陳又指，以往民主派參選猶如「爭獎牌」，但今時今日是「爭住去犧牲」，「攞到嘅議席唔係話畀我哋去享受呢個議席帶嚟嘅榮耀，而係準備作出最大嘅犧牲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指國安法下初選或是投票表態最後機會&quot;&gt;陳指《國安法》下初選或是投票表態最後機會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指初選目的就是盡量減少同路人競爭，不會「鷸蚌相爭」，亦是「推動呢一場運動」。陳單張提到「儘管民間初選不盡完善，卻可能成為投票表態嘅最後機會」，解釋因「《國安法》壓境，可能都已經拉咗去坐監喇⋯⋯你未報名已經拉咗你喇」，而香港眾志的年輕人提到「初選得到越多嘅支持，係代表中共要DQ佢哋係越樣衰，但係中共真係唔怕樣衰呀」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到被問是否怕DQ，「我就話冇得怕㗎，因為把刀喺中共嘅手上，喺港共嘅手上」，並形容政府2016年引入的參選人「確認書」為「僭建物」，指若政府要求簽署支持《國安法》，「我覺得所有民主派嘅朋友唔應該簽，因為咁樣係背叛香港人，係背叛呢場運動。」陳又指，已作最壞打算未必能參選，因可能所有現任民主派議員也會被DQ、「全部民主派冇得入閘」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指國安惡法強姦香港市民之餘還要說性交轉運&quot;&gt;陳指國安惡法強姦香港市民之餘還要說「性交轉運」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳亦談及對司法制度和《國安法》看法，指就張舉能委任首席法官議案投反對票，「唔好再畀個假象大家睇話香港有咩嘢司法獨立呀，我哋要尊重法庭嘅司法系統。」陳又形容現時中共推「國安惡法」，「可以架空我哋法庭」，甚至「拎返去北京審都仲得」，而法官由林鄭月娥揀選，「佢會揀一啲咩嘢法官呢？梗係揀啲有高尚情操嗰啲法官喇，即係斬人都有高尚情操嘅法官⋯⋯呢啲仲係咪我哋以前香港所謂嘅司法獨立？」三名法官聞言時面無表情，繼續觀看電腦螢幕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，當局「將國安惡法講成好似香港嘅救命護身符」，是「守護神」、「中共送畀香港嘅大禮」，但「我就要踢爆佢國安法唔單止唔係一啲好嘢，簡直係要強姦香港市民，喺強姦香港市民之餘，仲要話呢個係性交轉運喎……仲話對你好呀，係對香港好呀，立咗國安惡法呢就繁榮穩定喇、長久至遠喇」，「我哋覺得中共而家係咁同香港人攬炒。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，香港如步入文革時代、以言入罪，「如果香港人唔反抗，係逆來順受，即係佢強姦你，你話哦，好舒服呀咁樣，咁樣冇人可以幫到我哋㗎」，「所以香港人，最低限度都要識嗌唔好。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指街站遭拍片如成國安法罪證也光明正大&quot;&gt;陳指街站遭拍片如成《國安法》罪證也「光明正大」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，「未來呢場抗爭運動，我哋唔知道我仲可以行幾遠，可能聽日佢就拉咗我」，並指剛才開街站被一班警察圍住，「我從來都未試過候選人或者議員呢要抄身份證嘅」，但還是遭抄身分證，又被要求拍攝單張相片，「可能亦都係拍低晒我哋講咩嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指「我話成份（單張）畀你，畀多幾份你都得啦，啊警察，係咪呀」，又說「你唔使拍我吖，我而家 Facebook Live 緊嘅，你上我網咁咪睇得晒囉，我講乜嘢你覺得係罪證，無論係DQ嘅罪證又好，未來呢個國安惡法嘅罪證又好，我哋都係光明正大嘅」，林卓廷、鄒家成等聞言發笑，旁聽席亦傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又提到，「抗爭到底」的意思是「咬住唔放」，「邊個可以咬住唔放呢，邊個就係最尾有機會贏」，「對啲保皇黨如此，對林鄭政府如此，對共產黨亦都如此。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方播畢片段後，法官下令休庭，案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Political warfare is the employment of all the means at a nation’s command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executive-summary&quot;&gt;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An ambitious blueprint has been drawn for building a modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, sounding a clarion call of the times for us forging ahead on a new journey.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-xi-jinping&quot;&gt;– Xi Jinping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;China is conducting an unprecedented campaign below the threshold of armed conflict to expand the influence of the Chinese Communist Party and weaken the United States and its partners.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This campaign involves sophisticated Chinese espionage activities, offensive cyber operations, disinformation on social media platforms, economic coercion, and influence operations targeting companies, universities, and other organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report offers one of the most comprehensive analyses to date of Chinese political warfare activities and examines China’s main actions, primary goals, and options for the United States and its partners. It sheds new light on the scope and breadth of Chinese activities and comes to several conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, China is conducting an increasingly active and aggressive campaign to penetrate a wide range of U.S. academic institutions, companies, government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The scale of China’s actions in the United States is unparalleled. As one Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) senior official told the authors, “The system is blinking red right now. We have not seen this level of Chinese intelligence and influence activity in and around the U.S. homeland ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, for example, the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) have arrested or indicted numerous individuals for espionage, cyber operations, and illegal influence campaigns. The list includes an indictment against the codirector of a U.S.-based think tank for acting as an unregistered foreign agent for China and other actions, a series of aggressive cyberattacks against senior U.S. government officials and companies such as Microsoft, and the expansion of Chinese intelligence collection sites in such countries as Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, China has been involved in an expansive campaign to monitor, harass, and coerce residents of the United States and other countries as part of an extralegal repatriation effort known as Operation Fox Hunt. In 2023, for example, the FBI arrested two individuals, “Harry” Lu Jianwang and Chen Jinping, in connection with operating an illegal police station in Manhattan, New York City, for China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS). In 2023, DOJ also indicted dozens of MPS officials for conducing online intimidation against Chinese nationals residing in the United States who were critical of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the report details that China’s top target for political warfare — by far — is the United States. Chinese actions against the United States are more expansive than is generally known and include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s intelligence services, such as the Ministry of State Security (MSS) and MPS, are engaged in extensive human intelligence, signals intelligence, and other types of intelligence collection as part of political warfare — including intimidating Chinese diaspora in the United States. In examining over 100 Chinese espionage cases directed at the United States and U.S. entities, this report concludes that Chinese intelligence operations are not just pervasive, but they are used to plan and execute all of China’s other political warfare activities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese organizations, including units within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), are involved in a cyber campaign against U.S. and other international corporations, universities, government agencies, media, think tanks, nongovernmental organizations, and other targets. These efforts are designed to help China leapfrog ahead of the West by skipping the extensive and time-consuming research and development phases for new technologies. China’s cyber operations are also intended to influence foreign and domestic audiences, assist with offensive military campaigns, and improve the country’s artificial intelligence and big data analytics capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information and Disinformation Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; China is engaged in extensive  information and disinformation activities overseas — including in the U.S. homeland — designed to influence decisionmaking and popular support to gain a competitive advantage. Beijing seeks to tightly control the image of China abroad, including by influencing companies, organizations, and individuals that criticize China, from the National Basketball Association to Hollywood studios.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United Front Work:&lt;/strong&gt; The CCP is involved in aggressive efforts to extend its reach overseas through united front work, which involves activity to protect and bolster the image of China and the CCP. United front work includes activities to influence individuals in such countries as the United States who are well positioned to amplify China’s preferred messaging on political, economic, and other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular Military Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; The PLA, PLA Navy, PLA Air Force, PLA Rocket Forces, People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia, research organizations, and private security companies linked to China are involved in widespread efforts to expand Chinese influence below the threshold of armed conflict. Chinese organizations are involved in near-seas activities (which focus on securing Chinese interests around such areas as the South and East China Seas) and farseas activities (which are global in scope). This report constructs a dataset of Chinese private security companies that shows that there are nearly two dozen Chinese private security companies operating overseas, including in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Coercion:&lt;/strong&gt; China has penetrated — or attempted to penetrate — virtually every sector of the U.S. economy, as well as many of its partners such as the United Kingdom. In addition, China is engaged in the threat or imposition of economic costs or inducements to influence decisionmaking and popular support in other countries to gain a competitive advantage. There has been considerable focus on the Belt and Road Initiative as part of a broader effort to influence foreign governments. As this report highlights, however, another concerning Chinese initiative is the Digital Silk Road, which aims to spread Chinese influence through telecommunications, e-commerce, hardware, software, big data, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and other digital infrastructure across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools are part of a broad strategy of &lt;em&gt;political warfare&lt;/em&gt;, which U.S. diplomat George Kennan described as “the employment of all the means at a nation’s command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives.” The U.S. public and other international audiences are often unaware of the full nature and scope of these Chinese activities, including those that target U.S. and other Western companies, government agencies, universities, news media, digital platforms, and other NGOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools are not mutually exclusive but are sometimes overlapping, reinforcing, and occasionally even duplicative and competitive. China presents a “whole-of-state” approach to political warfare. Multiple organizations are involved, such as the PLA, MSS, MPS, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, United Front Work Department, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A wide range of non-state or quasi-state actors are also involved, from hacktivists to private security companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, China has several strategic goals in conducting political warfare. The most important is preservation of the CCP’s rule. Another is expanding Chinese influence and weakening the United States as part of balance-of-power competition. These goals are in line with China’s national strategy of achieving “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts.” China also conducts political warfare — rather than armed conflict — to avoid conventional war and refrain from provoking other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of these activities, the United States and its partners have been slow to identify and counter Chinese political warfare. This needs to change. Moving forward, there are several core components of an effective strategy to compete with China. These components include continuing to ground U.S. responses in democratic principles; improving the United States’ understanding of China through a more systematic analysis of the country; improving defensive measures, including increasing U.S. counterintelligence resources; conducting a more effective offensive campaign; and deepening relationships with partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. policymakers have been more comfortable with defensive measures to protect the United States from Chinese intelligence operations, cyber operations, propaganda, united front work, and other activity. But U.S. and partner offensive measures are also essential to help achieve several goals, such as reversing China’s expansionism and influence by competing on a sustained basis across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the Cold War, Kennan authored a U.S. State Department Policy Planning Staff memorandum on political warfare that remains relevant to today’s competition with China. He noted that a significant part of great power competition involves activities below the threshold of conventional and nuclear warfare. Today, China is heavily involved in many of these activities. As this report documents, China also has significant weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Together with its partners, the United States now needs to develop a comprehensive approach to compete in this arena that is consistent with its democratic principles and values. The clock is ticking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Confronted with drastic changes in the international landscape, especially external attempts to blackmail, contain, blockade, and exert maximum pressure on China, we have put our national interests first, focused on internal political concerns, and maintained firm strategic resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-xi-jinping-1&quot;&gt;– Xi Jinping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This report examines Chinese political warfare, which includes actions below the threshold of conventional warfare designed to achieve a state’s national objectives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Examples include intelligence operations, cyber operations, information and disinformation operations, united front work, irregular military action, and economic coercion. These measures have also been referred to as gray zone actions, irregular warfare, asymmetric activities, or even unrestricted warfare. An analysis of political warfare is essential for two main reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, much of the U.S. focus on China has been on the growing conventional or nuclear capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and other organizations. As one report from the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) concludes, the PLA is “developing the capabilities to conduct joint long-range precision strikes across domains, increasingly sophisticated space, counterspace, and cyber capabilities, and accelerating the large-scale expansion of its nuclear forces.” Based on these concerns, the United States has concentrated on building conventional and nuclear capabilities to deter China with the help of its partners — and to fight China if deterrence fails. The United States’ 2022 &lt;em&gt;National Defense Strategy&lt;/em&gt; focuses on the conventional and nuclear threat from China and ways that the United States and its partners could sustain and strengthen conventional and nuclear deterrence. In addition, the majority of DOD planning scenarios and operational plans (OPLANs) center on conventional war with China. The same is true with wargames over the past few years, which have focused on such scenarios as a Chinese conventional invasion of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actions are necessary. The United States and its partners need to continue developing military capabilities for deterrence and — if deterrence fails — warfighting. But these measures are not sufficient. As this report finds, Beijing is conducting a wide range of activities below the level of armed conflict designed to protect the CCP, weaken the United States and its allies, and expand Chinese power and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there is a growing body of work on Chinese political warfare and related activities. But most assessments have been relatively narrow and focused on one of the following areas: PLA gray zone activities, especially by the PLA Navy, PLA Air Force, PLA Army, People’s Armed Police, China Coast Guard, and People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia; cyber and disinformation operations, including activity by the PLA Strategic Support Force; or intelligence operations, including activity by the MSS and MPS. For example, there has been a great deal of research and analysis on Chinese gray zone activity, particularly actions by the PLA. Yet most of this work has focused on military actions by the PLA — not broader political warfare by a range of Chinese organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disaggregating Chinese political warfare into various parts — and not analyzing the sum of its parts — misses China’s broad and systematic attempts to expand power and influence across multiple areas. Chinese political warfare cannot be fully understood piecemeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-design&quot;&gt;RESEARCH DESIGN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report asks several questions. What actions is China conducting against the United States and its partners as part of political warfare? What are China’s main goals in conducting political warfare? Finally, what options do the United States and its partners have to counter these Chinese activities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, this report applies a mixed-methods approach. It compiles quantitative data on several issues — such as counterintelligence cases, cyber incidents, and Chinese private security companies — to better understand Chinese political warfare and assess trends over time. For example, the chapter on intelligence operations reviews more than 100 U.S. indictments of individuals accused of conducting activities on behalf of China. The chapter on Chinese irregular military activities constructs a database of Chinese private security companies that have operated outside of China, sample locations in which they are reported to operate, the types of services they have provided, and some of their known clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the report utilizes several types of qualitative information to better understand Chinese political warfare. Members of the research team collected and analyzed Chinese documents, including documents from CSIS’s open-source project, &lt;em&gt;Interpret: China&lt;/em&gt;. The chapter on information and disinformation relies on a body of English-language primary source speeches from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the CSIS &lt;em&gt;Interpret: China&lt;/em&gt; database. The CSIS team also scraped and analyzed the tweets of prominent Chinese Communist Party (CCP) spokespersons. Furthermore, the intelligence chapter analyzes one of the few unclassified Chinese-language documents illuminating China’s approach to intelligence: a book by two Chinese intelligence veterans, Huo Zhongwen and Wang Zongxiao. The chapter on irregular military activities relies on a variety of primary and secondary sources, including Chinese research publications, government white papers, press releases, and speeches by officials; analysis and data reported by U.S. and partner governments and research institutions; and satellite imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, CSIS analysts conducted interviews with U.S. government officials, academic and corporate subject matter experts, and officials from several foreign countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-warfare&quot;&gt;POLITICAL WARFARE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As used in this report, political warfare refers to activities short of conventional and nuclear warfare that are designed to expand a country’s influence and legitimacy, as well as weaken its adversaries. Political warfare is not new. As historian Hal Brands concludes, “During the Peloponnesian War, Athens and Sparta sought to widen each other’s internal divisions. During the Cold War, it would have been odd had America not waged political warfare against the Kremlin, since the nuclear revolution made it so essential to win without violence.” The Soviet Union and United States utilized political warfare during the Cold War to achieve several goals: weaken a population’s trust in its institutions of government (whether in the United States, the Soviet Union, or their allied countries), establish or widen cleavages between individuals and groups in society, and establish or exploit divisions between allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, political warfare includes tools of statecraft that governments can use to shift the balance of power in their favor without fighting each other directly, such as disinformation, cyber operations, intelligence operations, and economic coercion. Political warfare is designed to strengthen a state and weaken its adversaries by sowing or exploiting internal divisions, creating schisms within and among its partners, and draining its resources and energy. Other government officials and scholars have used different terms — such as irregular warfare, hybrid warfare, gray zone activity, asymmetric conflict, and the indirect approach — to capture some or all of these activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As U.S. State Department diplomat George Kennan observed, “Political warfare is the logical application of Clausewitz’s doctrine in times of peace” — that is, in the absence of direct armed conflict. “Such operations are both overt and covert,” Kennan explained. “They range from such overt actions as political alliances, economic measures [such as the Marshall Plan during the Cold War], and ‘white’ propaganda to such covert operations as clandestine support of ‘friendly’ foreign elements, ‘black’ psychological warfare and even encouragement of underground resistance in hostile states.” As Kennan argued, the creation and survival of the British Empire and the Soviet Union were in part caused by their effective application of political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political warfare involves actions that impact the cost-benefit calculations of states and their populations without resorting to brute force, which can often have high costs in blood and treasure. Political warfare can include several components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; The practice of obtaining political, military, economic, and other intelligence to coerce or otherwise gain a competitive advantage over an adversary. For the purpose of political warfare, these intelligence activities are more than just routine espionage since they are designed to weaken adversaries below the level of armed conflict. In addition, intelligence collection plays a critical role in informing and supporting all other components of political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Actions taken through unauthorized access to computer networks to coerce or otherwise gain a competitive advantage over an adversary, ranging from denial of service to disruption and confusion, to physical, real-world effects like destruction of equipment through penetration of an industrial control system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information and Disinformation Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; The collection and dissemination of information to influence decisionmaking or popular support. As highlighted in Chapter 6, China has also used a specific type of influence operation, termed “united front work,” to gather information on, manage relations with, and attempt to influence individuals inside and outside of China — including individuals in overseas communities that hold political, economic, or academic influence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular Military Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; Activities taken by military forces — or units directly or indirectly linked to military forces — to coerce or otherwise gain a competitive advantage over an adversary below the threshold of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Coercion:&lt;/strong&gt; The threat or actual imposition of economic costs or inducements on a target to influence decisionmaking or popular support and to gain a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political warfare is distinct from conventional warfare, which has sometimes been referred to as “regular” warfare. Conventional warfare involves the direct use of army, navy, air force, and other military capabilities to defeat an adversary’s armed forces on a battlefield; control territory, populations, and forces; or annihilate an enemy’s war-making capacity. Political warfare is also different from nuclear warfare, which involves the use of — or threat to use — nuclear weapons against adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might object that the concept of political warfare can include almost anything a state does below the threshold of armed conflict. But this would be incorrect. The vast majority of state activity overseas — such as routine diplomacy, development work, humanitarian assistance, and trade — are not examples of political warfare. States engage in numerous other actions that have nothing to do with political warfare, such as public financial management, infrastructure construction, asset management, market engagement, rule of law, and governance. What pushes an activity into the arena of political warfare is when its goal is to expand a country’s power and weaken its adversaries as part of balance-of-power competition. Political warfare is &lt;em&gt;power politics short of conventional war&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might also be uncomfortable with using the term “warfare” to describe nonviolent actions such as economic coercion and information operations. But that is not how countries such as China see it. They apply a broad view of warfare as a struggle between competing entities and not just the use of brute force. China has used terms such as the “three warfares” (三战), which includes media, psychological, and legal warfare. None of the three warfares involves the use of violence. As the Chinese general Sun Tzu remarked, the supreme art of war is to “subdue the enemy &lt;em&gt;without fighting&lt;/em&gt;.” Other countries have also conceptualized warfare as including nonviolent actions. For example, Iran has utilized terms such as &lt;em&gt;jang-e narm&lt;/em&gt; (soft war), which includes such activities as propaganda and disinformation to influence others. Likewise, Russia has used terms such as &lt;em&gt;aktivnyye meropriyatiya&lt;/em&gt; (active measures) as a tool of warfare against the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The political nature of political warfare is a critical component because states can use a range of tools below the threshold of armed conflict to influence, deter, or coerce others. Chinese activities are particularly well suited for examining the concept of political warfare because of the ubiquitous role of the CCP, a political party, in society. The party has only strengthened under President and General Secretary Xi Jinping. As China expert Jude Blanchette contends, “Xi is surrounded by advisers who think primarily in political, not military terms.” The result has been that political warfare is an important component of China’s tool kit. “Chinese military planners began to focus on ‘informationalization’ of the PLA,” notes David Kilcullen, “bringing it into the modern digital era and renewing their emphasis on political warfare.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All countries — or at least all aspiring powers — utilize political warfare. But the Chinese practice of political warfare is different from many other countries in several respects. First is its size and scope. A much larger component of the Chinese government is engaged in political warfare than is typical of historical cases, and Chinese organizations are involved in a wide range of activities. During the Cold War, for instance, U.S. special operations forces and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were primarily engaged in political warfare for the United States, while the KGB was the main actor for the Soviet Union. But China has leveraged the PLA, MSS, MPS, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, United Front Work Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other agencies. Second, China is heavily engaged in co-opting, attempting to co-opt, and coercing Chinese diaspora populations overseas. This has led to a growth in extraterritorial activity — such as the establishment of so-called police stations overseas — to monitor, co-opt, and even harass Chinese citizens. Third, China under Xi Jinping is unusually concerned about protecting its image overseas and countering criticism from a wide range of actors, such as educational institutions, corporations, research organizations, media (including social media), and governments. This paranoia may be partly a desire to preserve the CCP’s rule — and indeed Xi Jinping’s legacy — and to prevent domestic opposition and instability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;caveats&quot;&gt;CAVEATS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several limitations of this research. First, there are notable challenges in understanding China’s intentions, capabilities, and actions. China — including such organizations as the PLA — is opaque. China translates a limited amount of information into English. Western governments and academics have failed to translate into English and make publicly available some of China’s most important military documents, speeches, and reports. Most Americans have to rely on what the CCP chooses to translate into English using state-run media and propaganda outlets. In addition, the Chinese system is structured in such a way that there is tremendous secrecy about the role that senior officials play and the mechanisms of government. To deal with these challenges, this report qualifies its judgments based on analyzing the available evidence, sourcing information, and highlighting information gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, some Chinese political warfare activities are designed to be clandestine, making it difficult to assess what the Chinese government is doing, either directly or indirectly through proxies or partners. These proxies and partners can include front organizations, hackers, private security companies, fishing vessels, media organizations, spies, non-governmental institutions, and others. Because of the clandestine nature of some aspects of political warfare, it is sometimes impossible to know with certainty whether and how the Chinese government was involved. Again, this report has tried to qualify its judgments and document its primary and secondary sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, this report relies on unclassified and open-source information. Even classified assessments that use signals intelligence, human intelligence, satellite intelligence, and other types of intelligence face information hurdles and gaps in knowledge. A reliance on open-source information presents even greater hurdles. Nevertheless, taking pre-cautionary steps — such as qualifying judgments where appropriate and identifying gaps in information — still leads to a useful understanding of Chinese political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, this report is still able to compile a useful overview and understanding of Chinese political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overview-of-the-report&quot;&gt;OVERVIEW OF THE REPORT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this report is divided into the following chapters to better understand Chinese political warfare. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the strategic logic of Chinese political warfare. Chapter 3 analyzes Chinese intelligence operations, which are important to all other aspects of political warfare. Chapter 4 focuses on Chinese cyber operations, including offensive cyber activities. Chapter 5 examines Chinese influence efforts, including information and disinformation operations. Chapter 6 explores united front work. Chapter 7 examines China’s irregular military actions, including using such means as fishing vessels, the People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia, and private security companies. Chapter 8 explores Beijing’s global economic coercion. Finally, Chapter 9 outlines how the United States and its partners can better counter Chinese political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-strategic-logic-of-chinese-political-warfare&quot;&gt;THE STRATEGIC LOGIC OF CHINESE POLITICAL WARFARE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sino-U.S. relations already cannot return to their former state. In response to the United States’ multi-pronged attack and wide-ranging suppression, China must consider and formulate long-term and strategic response strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-ni-guihua-and-zhu-feng&quot;&gt;– Ni Guihua and Zhu Feng&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;China has a long history of political warfare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Between the third and fifth centuries BC, for example, Wu Qi, Sima Rangju, Sun Bin, Sun Tzu, and others were influential in the art of covert and clandestine activities. More recently, an assessment by two People’s Liberation Army (PLA) officers concluded that the “use of asymmetrical measures, which create power for oneself and make the situation develop as you want it to, is often hugely effective.” This chapter provides an overview of Chinese political warfare. It asks two sets of questions: What are China’s main goals in conducting political warfare, and how does China conceptualize the use of these activities? What are the primary organizations involved in political warfare? To answer these questions, the chapter examines Chinese and other primary and secondary sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter makes two main arguments. First, China has several strategic goals in conducting political warfare. One set of goals is preserving the CCP, expanding Chinese power and influence, and weakening adversaries as part of balance-of-power competition. In addition, China aims to compete with the United States and other countries while avoiding conventional war and limiting security fears that might come from conventional military activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, numerous Chinese institutions are involved in political warfare, such as the PLA, Ministry of State Security, Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, United Front Work Department, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. There are also a wide range of non-state entities involved in political warfare, such as hacktivist organizations, member of the Chinese diaspora, and private security companies. While the Chinese government attempts to establish a whole-of-nation approach to domestic and international security, there is neither one clear strategic concept for political warfare nor one lead agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two arguments suggest a complex bureaucratic structure of concepts, agencies, and actions involved in planning and executing political warfare. In some areas, such as intelligence operations and united front work, there is likely more centralization through the Ministry of State Security and United Front Work Department, respectively. But these activities are not always well synchronized. As the U.S. commander of the Office of Naval Intelligence assessed, “We have strong indications that Xi Jinping . . . is not aware of everything his security forces are doing. We think it’s a function of the unwieldiness of China’s governance model.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter is divided into four sections. The first examines Chinese strategic goals in using political warfare. The second discusses major Chinese concepts for political warfare, which include a mix of military, economic, ideological, and other efforts designed to gain a competitive advantage. The third section describes the main organizations involved in Chinese political warfare. And the fourth provides a brief conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strategic-goals&quot;&gt;STRATEGIC GOALS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In utilizing political warfare, Chinese leaders likely have several goals that are interlinked. If implemented effectively, they can maximize benefits (such as expanding power and influence) and minimize risks (such as triggering security concerns and a balancing coalition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, China utilizes political warfare to preserve the CCP’s rule, expand Chinese power and influence, and weaken its adversaries — especially the United States. These goals are in line with China’s national strategy of achieving “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts.” Chinese leaders view the international security environment as increasingly hostile and the United States as a major competitor. “The Central Committee has brought together the entire Party, the military, and the Chinese people and led them in effectively responding to grave, intricate international developments and a series of immense risks and challenges,” Xi noted in his report to the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of “strategic advantage” (势 or shi) has long been an important aspect of Chinese strategic thinking and an influential component of military, diplomatic, intelligence, and other actions. Under shi, a state seeks a relative advantage over its opponent, no matter how slight. In this approach, shi is a dynamic — rather than fixed — concept and may evolve as the balance of power changes. As the Chinese scholar Zhongqi Pan argued: “What China fights for is not just national interests, but relative advantage in shi. . . . In terms of the strategic goal, China aims to build, accumulate and maintain a relative advantage of shi vis-à-vis other countries including the U.S. at regional level, and probably at global level as well.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expanding Chinese power is part of Xi Jinping’s desire for a “great national rejuvenation” and for the PLA to become a world-class military by 2049. For Xi and other officials, the process of rejuvenation is in part a process of competition with its chief rival, the United States. This competition may not occur primarily on a conventional battlefield but rather in the economic, technological, informational, and diplomatic spheres. In the 20th National Congress report, Xi tasked the PLA with achieving the same three-stage military modernization plan (including a range of targets for 2027, 2035, and 2049) that has been in place since 2020. Part of China’s focus is maintaining a favorable external environment, including in the Indo-Pacific, in which countries align with and acquiesce to China’s policies and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China likely utilizes political warfare to limit provoking other countries. The tools of political warfare are critical for expanding Chinese power and influence without triggering major pushback — including causing a conventional war or, at the very least, prompting an adversary to establish a balancing coalition. The desire to prevent a balancing coalition has a long tradition in balance-of-power politics. The growing strength and potential threat of a rising power have historically led one or more states to balance against the emerging power. Balancing states can increase their own economic and military power (internal balancing) or band together with a coalition of countries (external balancing). Military conquest by the rising power invariably causes fear among neighboring states and potential challengers. But it is less clear that political warfare elicits the same type of security concerns. As Bonny Lin argues in her analysis of Chinese gray zone actions, “These international tactics offer China more indirect and, in some cases, less visible and seemingly legitimate ways to pressure countries that could invite less regional or international criticism and pushback.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, China likely pursues political warfare in a competitive environment to increase its power and minimize potential opposition. These activities are part of the broader goals of China’s rejuvenation by increasing military, economic, technological, political, and other forms of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-concepts&quot;&gt;KEY CONCEPTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve these goals, there are several concepts that China uses to capture aspects of political warfare. Table 2.1 highlights some of the key concepts, from strategic advantage (势) to military operations other than war (非战争军事行动).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of China’s most frequently used terms is military operations other than war (非战争军事行动, or MOOTW). For example, the 2020 edition of The Science of Military Strategy, published by the PLA’s National Defense University, includes a comprehensive chapter on MOOTW, which it defines as “non-war military operations carried out by a country or political group to achieve a certain political goal.” The PLA’s dictionary of military terms similarly defines MOOTW as “the armed forces’ use of military operations to protect national security and development interests that do not directly lead to war.” MOOTW has generally included stability operations, maritime rights enforcement, and other actions designed to expand Chinese influence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overseas Strategic Strong Points&lt;/strong&gt; (海外战略支点): Establish Chinese-operated ports abroad, such as seaports, using diplomatic and other means to provide easier and more cost-effective means of conducting military operations than working with a foreign port authority or commercial entity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peacetime Employment of Military Force&lt;/strong&gt; (和平时期军事力量运用): Conduct military activities to deter or coerce an adversary that poses a threat — but without resorting to conventional war.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Advantage&lt;/strong&gt; (势): Gain a relative advantage over the opponent, no matter how slight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Struggle&lt;/strong&gt; (斗争): Strive through violent or non-violent means to resolve what Marxist-Leninists deem to be “contradictions” in domestic and international society.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Warfares&lt;/strong&gt; (三战): Create an information advantage through public opinion warfare (舆论战), psychological warfare (心理战), and legal warfare (法律战).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United Front&lt;/strong&gt; (统战): Protect and bolster the image of China and the CCP, including by monitoring and countering criticism overseas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2003, the CCP’s Central Committee and the Central Military Commission approved an important concept for the PLA called the “three warfares” (三战). It includes three components: public opinion warfare (舆论战), psychological warfare (心理战), and legal warfare (法律战). Building on Mao Zedong’s contention that the military’s goal is to carry out “the political tasks of the revolution,” the three warfares offer a way for the PLA to establish and expand Chinese political power and influence at home and abroad without resorting to armed conflict. In this sense, the PLA is not a national military but rather the armed wing of the CCP, which defends the political power of the CCP. The components of the three warfares are intended to be reinforcing rather than mutually exclusive. Together, they are designed to help China wage information warfare against the United States and other competitors across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first component, media warfare, involves the use of broadcast, print, and online efforts to influence domestic and international public opinion in ways that support Chinese interests and undermine its competitors. China recognizes that newspapers, television, radio, social media, and even organizations such as civilian institutions are all legitimate mediums to influence populations. Overseas, China has waged media warfare through broadcasts of the state-run China Central Television (CCTV) and China Global Television Network (CGTN), inserts paid for by the Chinese government in newspapers such as the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, and educational institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second component, psychological warfare, is designed to sow dissent, disaffection, and discord among soldiers and the civilian population of competitors such as the United States. Psychological warfare also leverages television, radio broadcasts, leaflets, and other mediums — much like media warfare — but it is designed to achieve military purposes. As one analysis in the PLA journal &lt;em&gt;China Military Science&lt;/em&gt; concluded, the goal of psychological warfare should be to “sap the enemy’s morale, disintegrate their will to fight, ignite the anti-war sentiment among citizens at home, heighten international and domestic conflict, weaken and sway the will to fight among its high-level decision makers, and in turn lessen their superiority in military strength.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third component, legal warfare, involves the exploitation of international and domestic law to assert the legitimacy of Chinese claims. &lt;em&gt;The Science of Military Strategy&lt;/em&gt; argued that for the PLA, “international law is a powerful weapon to expose the enemy, win over sympathy and support of the international community [for China], and to strive to gain the position of strategic initiative.” It went on to explain that China needed to publicize its “own humanitarianism and reveal a lot of the war crimes committed by the opponent in violation of law . . . to compel [the] opponent to bog down in isolation and passivity.” Influential Chinese military texts emphasize that the PLA should justify its military actions through legal means before beginning any conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Chinese leaders and experts have utilized other concepts to describe elements of political warfare, which are highlighted in Figure 2.1. These include asymmetric means (非对称), civil-military fusion (军民融合), cognitive domain operations (认知域作战), discursive power (话语权), discourse war (话语战), economic diplomacy (经济外交), gray zone (灰色地带), hybrid warfare (混合战争), overseas strategic strong points (海外战略支点), peacetime employment of military force (和平时期军事力量运用), strategic advantage (势), struggle (斗争), and united front (统战). China has also utilized such notions as the “holistic security concept” (整体安全概念) to expand the definition of security at home and abroad to include nearly a dozen fields, including political, territorial, military, economic, cultural, social, scientific and technological, information, ecological, financial, and nuclear security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;main-organizations&quot;&gt;MAIN ORGANIZATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several organizations involved in spearheading political warfare, such as the PLA, Ministry of State Security, Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, United Front Work Department, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As this report highlights, there are also nongovernment actors — from hacktivists to private security companies and Chinese citizens — involved in political warfare. Figure 2.2 highlights some of the most important state organizations and examples of their activities. While the Chinese government — especially the CCP — attempts to establish a whole-of-nation approach, there is no single, centralized organization involved in all of these political warfare activities. Instead, there are multiple overlapping entities that span the military, economic, political, ideological, intelligence, law enforcement, and other realms. As this section notes, there are a range of non-state actors — from fishing vessels to hackers — that are also involved in political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PEOPLE’S LIBERATION ARMY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA is involved in a range of political warfare activities in addition to preparing for conventional and nuclear war and deterrence. The PLA sits under the broader command and control of the Central Military Commission, which is China and the CCP’s main national defense organization and is chaired by Xi Jinping. The PLA Navy (PLAN), PLA Air Force (PLAAF), PLA Army (PLAA), PLA Rocket Force (PLARF), and other organizations play important roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLAN, for example, has been involved in harassing and disrupting commercial activities in disputed territories as well as sailing into contested territory in the East China Sea, Senkaku Islands, Thitu Island, and other areas. The PLAAF has conducted air operations — including with unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) — in disputed territories and harassed specific commercial activities, including around the Spratly Islands, the Taiwan Strait, and other locations. The PLAA and PLARF have also conducted political warfare activities against such countries as India, including around the disputed China-India border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the People’s Armed Police (PAP) and the China Coast Guard (CCG) have been involved in political warfare activities. The PAP is a paramilitary force within China’s armed forces charged with maritime security and internal security. The CCG, which is subordinate to the PAP, is responsible for a broad range of maritime security missions and has as many as 1,040 regional and oceangoing patrol vessels. The People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM), which is a subset of China’s national militia, is involved in protecting maritime claims, conducting surveillance and reconnaissance, protecting fisheries, and conducting search and rescue missions. It is also involved in political warfare, especially to advance China’s disputed sovereignty claims in such areas as the South and East China Seas. These Chinese organizations have also leveraged non-state actors, including those involved in fishing. Mao Zedong argued that the PLA needed to leverage fishermen as an important component of competition, stating “The navy must also rely on the people; it must rely on fishermen. It must plant roots among the fishermen.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA Army&lt;/strong&gt; Orchestrates land-based operations to collect intelligence and conduct subversive activities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA Navy&lt;/strong&gt; Harasses and disrupts specific commercial activities in disputed territories and sails into contested territory in the East China Sea, Senkaku Islands, and other areas.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLA Strategic Support Force&lt;/strong&gt; Conducts offensive cyber operations, intelligence collection, and information operations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/strong&gt; Orchestrates information, disinformation, and misinformation activity and engages in subversive efforts to expand Chinese influence and power.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ministry of Industry and Information Technology&lt;/strong&gt; Oversees China’s network infrastructure and coordinates with technology companies and universities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ministry of Public Security&lt;/strong&gt; Monitors dissidents and foreigners, particularly those located within China.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ministry of State Security&lt;/strong&gt; Conducts intelligence operations (including against members of the Chinese diaspora) through human intelligence, signals intelligence, and other means; oversees counterintelligence; conducts cyber operations, including offensive cyber operations; and orchestrates a range of subversive activity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United Front Work Department&lt;/strong&gt; Conducts information, disinformation, and misinformation activity to protect and bolster the image of China and the CCP, including by pressuring individuals and organizations overseas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLA has also been involved in influence operations through the Strategic Support Force (SSF), a theater-level organization established to centralize the PLA’s space, cyber, electronic, information, communications, and psychological warfare missions. The SSF combines technology and information systems into an organization that is critical for offensive cyber operations as well as intelligence gathering and technical reconnaissance. As part of its modernization effort, the PLA consolidated previously decentralized cyber units into the SSF beginning in late 2015 and throughout 2016 to improve the PLA’s combat capabilities. This effort was designed to create a more efficient and effective organization that could conduct cyber defense, espionage, and offensive operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber operations are centralized under the Networks Systems Department. It includes the previous Third Department (3PLA), which housed the majority of cyber operations; Fourth Department (4PLA), which was responsible for computer network attacks; and the Informatization Department, which handled network defense. The Network Systems Department includes such elements as the 61726 Unit (Wuhan) and the 61786 Unit (Beijing). The 311 Base that oversees the three warfares is directly under the PLASSF, as are PLA Units 61486 and 61419, which have been tied to cyberattacks against European, U.S., Japanese, and South Korean officials. Figure 2.3 highlights some of China’s main military organizations, which all sit under the Central Military Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of State Security (MSS) is China’s main civilian intelligence and counterintelligence authority responsible for domestic and foreign intelligence operations. The organizational structure of the MSS consists of a central ministry, provincial state security departments, and state security bureaus. The 2017 National Intelligence Act gave the MSS broad powers to compel Chinese citizens and organizations to assist with intelligence activities as well as to monitor domestic and foreign individuals and entities. This power allows China to leverage a range of non-state actors to assist with intelligence collection. Indeed, China has historically relied on front organizations, contractors, and private citizens to conduct state-sponsored offensive cyber operations, which allows the government to claim deniability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSS is heavily involved in influence operations overseas, which is a critical aspect of political warfare. For example, the MSS’s Tenth Bureau infiltrates overseas Chinese student and dissident groups, the Eleventh Bureau engages Western diplomats and others, and the Twelfth Bureau manages front organizations designed to influence Western targets of influence. As MI5, the United Kingdom’s domestic intelligence agency, warned UK citizens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The motive behind Chinese intelligence service cultivation of Westerners is primarily to make “friends”: once a “friendship” is formed [they] will use the relationship to obtain information which is not legally or commercially available to China and to promote China’s interest. Cultivation of a contact of interest is likely to develop slowly: [they] are very patient. . . . The aim of these tactics is to create a debt of obligation on the part of the target, who will eventually find it difficult to refuse inevitable requests for favours in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) is the lead domestic civilian police force, with responsibility for establishing public order, supervising public information networks, and conducting other law enforcement functions. It shares the counterintelligence mission with, and is directed by, the MSS. This shared mission with the MSS typically involves monitoring dissidents and foreigners located within China as well as policing the internet and social media platforms. The MPS’s Eleventh Bureau, the Cybersecurity Protection Bureau, is involved in targeting cybercrime and overseeing the protection system for information security. The MPS is involved in a range of political warfare activities, including influence operations, cyber activity, and monitoring members of the Chinese diaspora overseas through extraterritorial police stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) oversees China’s network infrastructure, including data security. The MIIT has coordinated with technology companies, including Huawei and Tencent, as well as elite universities to develop an open-source hosting platform in China, relying on Gitee, the Chinese alternative to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UNITED FRONT WORK DEPARTMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overseen by the Central Committee of the CCP, the United Front Work Department (UFWD) attempts to protect and bolster the image of the party by monitoring and countering criticism overseas — often by recruiting or pressuring the Chinese diaspora. The Chinese government considers members of the diaspora to be “overseas compatriots” (侨同胞们), who owe a measure of loyalty to the Chinese homeland. There is purposefully some confusion about UFWD activity, as MSS personnel have operated under the cover of the UFWD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the CCP has long emphasized the importance of united front work to conduct influence operations, with Xi Jinping calling it a “magic weapon” (法宝). Since 2015, Xi has advocated for the “Great United Front” and endeavored to reinvigorate united front work across the globe. Rather than leaving united front work only up to the UFWD, the Great United Front initiative supports united front work as a critical aspect of the CCP. United front work focuses on several targets: members of minority political parties (parties other than the CCP which are legally allowed to exist); general individuals who are not members of the CCP; intellectuals who are not members of the CCP; ethnic minorities; important religious figures; key corporate officials; members of the new social strata; students that are overseas or who have recently returned, including their relatives in the mainland; compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, including their relatives in the mainland; and overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and relatives of overseas Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is responsible for the foreign relations of China, including formulating foreign policy, administering the nation’s diplomatic missions, representing Chinese interests at the United Nations, negotiating foreign treaties, and advising the State Council on foreign affairs. Foreign affairs officials have also been involved in political warfare actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the outbreak of Covid-19, for example, senior officials from the MFA were heavily involved in disinformation and misinformation — including efforts directed at the United States. Zhao Lijian, an MFA spokesman, wrote on Twitter in March 2020 that the U.S. military might have spread Covid-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” he wrote. “Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” The claim that the U.S. Army had infected individuals in Wuhan was utterly false. Undeterred, the Chinese government amplified the claim on the official Twitter accounts of Chinese embassies and consulates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MFA was also involved in an influence campaign directed at the National Basketball Association, which is discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. In 2019, the Chinese government reacted angrily when Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team, supported protesters in Hong Kong. He tweeted: “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” In response, the Chinese consulate in Houston released a statement expressing its “strong dissatisfaction” with Morey’s tweet, noting that “anybody with conscience would support the efforts made by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to safeguard Hong Kong’s social stability.” In 2020, the U.S. government retaliated by ordering China to close its consulate in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a range of state organizations — such as the PLA, MSS, MPS, MIIT, UFWD, and MFA — are integral to the planning and execution of political warfare. These organizations have frequently leveraged private citizens (including overseas Chinese), companies, and non-governmental organizations to assist in irregular activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this chapter shows, political warfare is an important aspect of China’s strategy of national rejuvenation. China conducts political warfare to expand its power and influence below the level of armed conflict and to minimize security concerns that might be triggered by conventional warfare. Chinese leaders are sensitive about being perceived as revanchist. During the 20th National Congress, Xi Jinping adamantly noted that China was only interested in “peaceful development,” including a desire to “further consolidate national security; fulfill the goals for the centenary of the People’s Liberation Army in 2027; make solid progress in building a Peaceful China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese state and non-state actors have conducted several types of activities as part of political warfare: intelligence operations, cyber operations, information and disinformation operations, united front activity, irregular military actions, and economic coercion. For example, the CCP has used its economic clout to suppress international criticism of its own violations of democratic principles and human rights. It has also pressured governments, international institutions, and the private sector to echo its preferred narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high. For the United States and the West at large, China is the chief ideological opponent, largest economic and technological competitor (including in such battlegrounds as microelectronics, 5G wireless technology, and artificial intelligence), most capable military challenger, and greatest geopolitical rival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help understand the nuances of China’s political warfare, the next chapter focuses on intelligence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intelligence-operations&quot;&gt;INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The ability of foreign affairs, news, military, security, and other departments to collect information and intelligence has been significantly improved, and the ability of relevant leading departments to comprehensively evaluate information and intelligence has continuously strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-zhang-tuosheng&quot;&gt;– Zhang Tuosheng&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This chapter examines Chinese intelligence operations as part of political warfare, particularly Chinese actions against the United States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; While espionage is a normal part of statecraft, this report focuses on the political warfare aspects of intelligence operations. Intelligence operations play a critical role in political warfare by helping states — in this case China — obtain political, military, economic, and other information to coerce or otherwise gain a competitive advantage over an adversary. Intelligence operations also play an important role in informing and supporting other components of political warfare, such as information and disinformation campaigns, united front activity, and economic coercion. As Linda Robinson concludes in her study of political warfare, “Political warfare places a high demand on intelligence.” As another assessment concludes, “Conducting political warfare by trying to build up foreign groups requires reliable intelligence about those groups’ motivations as well as about their capacities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few characterizations better describe the modern Chinese intelligence apparatus than a passage from the 2,400-year-old military treatise &lt;em&gt;The Methods of the Sima&lt;/em&gt;: “In general, to wage war: employ spies against the distant, observe the near.” Along these lines, this chapter analyzes how China’s military and civilian intelligence services employ spies as part of political warfare, with the primary intent of illuminating Chinese human intelligence (HUMINT) tradecraft and collection priorities. Overall, Chinese overseas intelligence activities are more centrally directed and driven by specific intelligence priorities than is typically acknowledged. Many — including the chief of the United Kingdom’s Security Service (MI5) — describe China pursuing a “thousand grains of sand” intelligence strategy, describing how China uses citizens in key positions to collect small pieces of information that together form a more complete intelligence picture. Such a strategy is much harder to disrupt. As this chapter shows, the empirical, open-source record indicates that Chinese HUMINT operations are methodical, resource intensive, and driven by well-defined intelligence priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter diverges from most existing literature on Chinese intelligence activities by analyzing Beijing’s HUMINT services through the lens of the HUMINT agent acquisition cycle, the five-phase process used by intelligence officers to spot, assess, develop, recruit, and handle human sources. This process is important in understanding Chinese political warfare. The analysis relies on a review of cases of known or suspected Chinese intelligence activities, with a particular focus on cases dating from 2015 to present. It includes an evaluation of court records from more than 100 U.S. indictments of individuals accused of conducting activities on behalf of China as well as analysis of similar cases overseas where that data is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Chinese primary source documents describing the structure and operations of the country’s civilian and military intelligence services are scarce, recent Chinese counterintelligence investigations and disclosures by intelligence and law enforcement agencies worldwide are generating an increasing volume of data that illuminates the operational tradecraft of China’s intelligence services. These disclosures expose key patterns and commonalities across cases during each phase of China’s efforts to recruit sources and to shape these sources’ collection. While the majority of data analyzed in support of this chapter were derived from U.S. federal court documents, there is ample evidence that the Chinese intelligence tradecraft and collection priorities apply equally to U.S. partners. As such, these findings — although largely focused on U.S. examples — can contribute to global efforts to detect and disrupt Chinese intelligence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this chapter begins with a brief overview of China’s intelligence services. It then proceeds into further analysis of how the Chinese intelligence services execute overseas operations across the spotting, assessing, developing, recruiting, and handling phases, which are critical for political warfare. Finally, this chapter examines Chinese intelligence and law enforcement efforts to intimidate and harass members of the Chinese diaspora living overseas — including in the United States — by such organizations as the Ministry of Public Security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-intelligence-services&quot;&gt;CHINA’S INTELLIGENCE SERVICES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemporary Chinese intelligence activities are primarily conducted under the 2017 National Intelligence Law. The law does not explicitly define the roles and responsibilities of the civilian and military agencies that comprise China’s intelligence community, but it describes many of the intelligence services’ broader authorities. For example, Article 7 requires that “all organizations and citizens shall support, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts in accordance with the law, and shall protect national intelligence work secrets they are aware of.” Article 12 authorizes China’s intelligence services to “establish cooperative relationships with relevant individuals and organizations and retain them to carry out related work.” Both of these provisions establish the legal basis for some of the Chinese intelligence services’ key patterns of behavior, specifically their heavy reliance on various cut-outs and proxies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intelligence serves a central role in broader Chinese Communist Party (CCP) history and lore. In 1931, three CCP spies who had penetrated the Kuomintang security apparatus provided early warning that a high-level CCP intelligence official had defected to the Kuomintang. Mao Zedong later claimed that this operation — known as the Three Heroes of the Dragon’s Lair — changed the course of the revolution by warning key underground cadre that they would soon be exposed. Among those who were saved was China’s future premier Zhou Enlai, who served a key role in Chinese intelligence and security affairs until his death in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese intelligence apparatus has been reorganized repeatedly since the founding of the CCP and the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). While roles, missions, and organizational structure have changed, the one constant is that the CCP and China have maintained formalized, professional intelligence services since the party’s founding in 1927. This structure has evolved today into a broader Chinese intelligence community that includes both civilian and military elements, as outlined in Figure 3.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the civilian side, the Ministry of State Security (MSS) has been Beijing’s premier foreign intelligence service since it was established in 1983. The MSS is often described as combining the foreign intelligence collection responsibilities of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) with the domestic counterintelligence and counterespionage authorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). This analogy is useful — up to a point — in describing the overarching mission of the MSS. However, the MSS combines these foreign and domestic authorities in unique ways when conducting its operations. This results in several hallmark characteristics of Chinese intelligence operations. Perhaps most notable is Beijing’s continued reliance on mainland China not just as a hub for operational oversight and coordination but for the actual business of recruiting and handling foreign sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSS is composed of a headquarters component and approximately 18 component bureaus. Each of these subordinate bureaus is assigned a number and charged with a specific functional or regional portfolio. For example, as of 2018, the Sixth Bureau was responsible for overseas collection on science and technology issues. The MSS also maintains provincial and city divisions and bureaus, such as the Shanghai State Security Bureau, the Beijing State Security Bureau, and the Jiangsu State Security Department (JSSD). Each of these regional MSS offices mirrors the numbered component structure of MSS headquarters so that the JSSD, for example, has its own Sixth Bureau that likely coordinates with the Sixth Bureau at MSS headquarters in Beijing. Several scholars over the years have scoured Chinese primary sources in an effort to map the specific structure, roles, and responsibilities of the MSS. However, the accuracy of this work is variable and often becomes quickly dated. One attribute that the Chinese intelligence services share with their Western counterparts is a tendency to reorganize, including the MSS’s rearrangement of bureau numbers. For example, MSS files disclosed in a U.S. court case revealed that the overseas science and technology bureau in the JSSD was renumbered from the Fourth Bureau to the Sixth Bureau in December 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) is China’s primary domestic security service. The MPS is mainly responsible for police work within China, but it also has extensive internal security authorities. Since the initiation of Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign at the 18th Party Congress in 2012, the MPS has been increasingly tied to overseas operations. These activities are less focused on collecting political, economic, or military intelligence information. Instead, they are an extension of a decades-long role for the MPS in “political security,” which includes efforts to exert pressure on overseas dissidents and perceived enemies. The MPS traditionally has undertaken domestic activities to send messages to its targets overseas, such as by arresting family members in China. The MPS continues this specific technique but is now augmenting this domestic pressure with deployments overseas to harass, intimidate, and repatriate overseas Chinese citizens who Beijing accuses of political or financial corruption. These activities are likely spearheaded by the MPS’s First Bureau, which is reportedly responsible for monitoring Chinese political dissidents who live outside of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the United States and its partners, the MPS’s overseas operations are arguably the most concerning of any of China’s overseas intelligence activities. This is because the MPS is engaged in operations that extend far beyond the boundaries of traditional espionage. Espionage — that is, spying on other nations to glean insights about their capabilities and intentions — is an accepted, acknowledged, and normal practice by intelligence agencies in the arena of geopolitics. MPS operations, however, are often something entirely different. In many circumstances, they manifest in egregious violations of another nation’s sovereignty or reflect a blatant refusal to accept international law. These operations involve attempts by Beijing to extend the arm of its increasingly authoritarian governance to any of its perceived enemies, anywhere in the world — even if it means violating the constitutions and laws of the democratic nations where the MPS conducts these activities. Examples include uncoordinated law enforcement activities on a global scale, with recent reports indicating that Chinese law enforcement elements have quietly established more than 50 “overseas police service centers” in 21 countries across five continents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), two branches are primarily charged with intelligence duties. The Intelligence Bureau of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission is the PLA’s primary HUMINT arm, roughly equivalent to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Prior to the large-scale reorganization and modernization of the PLA in late 2015, the Intelligence Bureau was known as the Second Department of the General Staff Department of the PLA, more commonly known as 2PLA. The bureau was traditionally complemented by signals intelligence, electronic warfare, information operations, and offensive cyber capabilities within the Third Department (3PLA) and Fourth Department (4PLA). Of these groups, 3PLA maintains the highest public profile outside of China. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted five 3PLA computer network operators in 2014, and the economic espionage activities of one of the organization’s components (Unit 61398) were exposed by a U.S. cybersecurity firm in 2013 Both 3PLA and 4PLA were renamed and reorganized during a series of PLA reforms in late 2015, with both components likely integrated into the Network Systems Department of the PLA’s Strategic Support Force (SSF), which is also subordinate to the Central Military Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinas-intelligence-doctrine-and-the-agent-acquisition-cycle&quot;&gt;CHINA’S INTELLIGENCE DOCTRINE AND THE AGENT ACQUISITION CYCLE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter’s focus on examining Chinese intelligence operations through the lens of the agent acquisition cycle serves two purposes. The first purpose is to illuminate how China’s national-level intelligence collection priorities are operationalized by the intelligence services. This includes describing how the MSS and its counterparts identify and approach potential sources, task and handle these sources, and how the services work with specific customers to refine information needs and requirements. The second purpose is to examine how the various elements of the Chinese state — including the CCP, state research institutions, private companies, and the technical, cyber, and HUMINT elements of the intelligence services — contribute to Chinese intelligence operations. The goal is to provide a more coherent alternative to the common characterization of the Chinese intelligence threat as “one thousand grains of sand.” This term can lend the inaccurate impression that China’s activities are decentralized and opportunistic, while also opening the United States and its allies to criticism that they are indiscriminately targeting Chinese academics, students, businesspeople, and journalists by labeling them all as suspected agents of the CCP. The intent is to use fact-based, empirical evidence to illuminate Chinese intelligence tradecraft, which includes the activities of the state organs, affiliated research and development institutions, and various cut-outs, co-optees, and nontraditional collectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese primary sources describing Beijing’s modern approach to intelligence theory, doctrine, and operations are less abundant compared to writings on other security topics, particularly Beijing’s views on military modernization and strategy. Nevertheless, Chinese documents across the spectrum of national security strategy and doctrine reflect the abiding importance of intelligence in statecraft and warfare. Information is at the heart of Beijing’s military modernization efforts, which emphasize the pursuit of “information dominance.” While these documents reflect the enduring importance of intelligence to modern China, much of what Western scholars know about the specifics of how China’s clandestine services advance Beijing’s interests come from the U.S. prosecution of Chinese officers and agents, public warnings from Western leaders, and non-government analysts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the few Chinese-language documents available in the West illuminating China’s approach to intelligence work is a book published in 1991 by two Chinese intelligence veterans — Huo Zhongwen and Wang Zongxiao — titled &lt;em&gt;Sources and Techniques of Obtaining National Defense Science and Technology Intelligence&lt;/em&gt;. It describes a broader Chinese intelligence apparatus that is built to advance both national security and commercial interests. The book examines how science and technology collection is a shared responsibility across the intelligence services, research and academic institutions, and state-owned enterprises. It is a system that maintains no clear lines between military modernization and economic growth, a distinction that — at least in the United States — is a line established in intelligence policy and doctrine. As Huo and Wang conclude: “Intelligence work will become the heart of the new industrial revolution.” This perspective on intelligence can be observed in cases where China’s professional intelligence officers collaborate with science and technology institutions to identify collection requirements that advance China’s commercial interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huo and Wang’s work also describes China’s historical reliance on open-source information, which in their estimation accounted for 80 percent of China’s science and technology intelligence collection. Like the Soviets during the Cold War, China recognized the intelligence value of various Western periodicals and government reports, and Huo and Wang’s work methodically details the specific governmental and nongovernmental sources of technical insights that were of particular benefit to China’s commercial and military modernization. Nevertheless, they acknowledge that the remaining 20 percent of China’s intelligence needs “must come through the collection of information using special means, such as reconnaissance satellites, electronic eavesdropping, and the activities of special agents (purchasing or stealing), etc.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the blurring of national security and commercial interests in China’s approach to intelligence collection, Huo and Wang argue that China shares with the West similar perspectives on the broader intelligence collection process, specifically the intelligence cycle. They emphasize the importance of developing collection requirements, identifying the most effective means of collecting against certain requirements, and “immediately [analyzing and studying] the feedback that has been received from the information consumer and adjust the collection process in a timely manner, thus improving the work of collection.” Although there is no definitive open-source Chinese intelligence doctrine available, the cases reviewed in support of this chapter strongly suggest that the MSS and its counterparts adhere to many of the same fundamentals of the traditional intelligence cycle and, as an extension of that cycle, the recruitment of human agents using techniques that are shared historically with China’s foreign counterparts, including the CIA, MI6, and Russian intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spotting-and-assessing&quot;&gt;SPOTTING AND ASSESSING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall agent recruiting process can be thought of as a filter, as illustrated in Figure 3.1. At the top are the two broadest phases: spotting and assessing. Activities within these two phases are highly interconnected, as they are both largely analytic and, in most circumstances, passive. It is also in these two phases where there is ample evidence demonstrating how the Chinese intelligence services integrate all-source capabilities into their efforts to identify and evaluate potential human sources. Specifically, China’s intelligence services employ and often blend three primary techniques during the spotting and assessing phase: open-source intelligence analysis; domestic and overseas cut-outs, co-optees, and proxies; and technical operations, including computer network intrusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is during the spot and assess phases that HUMINT collectors begin the process of transforming customer intelligence requirements into actual collection. Depending on the specificity of the information need, the potential pool of sources that are initially spotted and assessed can range from exceptionally large to exceptionally small. For example, one U.S.-based spotter for the MSS simply sought contact with individuals with current or prior military or intelligence experience. Initial contacts would be routed back to MSS officers in China for further assessment of the individual’s potential access to classified or other non-public information that would be responsive to China’s information needs. In other circumstances, the spotting and assessing pool will be narrowly tailored, such as focusing on individuals who may have access to highly specialized technologies that would contribute to China’s economic or military modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CUT-OUTS, CO-OPTEES, AND PROXIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important trademark of Chinese intelligence operations is the use of various cut-outs, co-optees, and proxies. The use of such individuals — who often present themselves as businesspeople, students, or academics — creates a buffer of plausible deniability between China’s intelligence apparatus and its potential human sources. China’s clandestine services have not traditionally adopted the same operating models as their U.S., UK, Russian, or other counterparts. In these countries, intelligence officers are often celebrated for their ability to navigate hostile or denied environments. Leveraging various types of official or nonofficial cover, CIA, MI6, and KGB officers during the Cold War developed innovative and sophisticated tradecraft that they used to recruit and handle high-level sources within an adversary’s government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPOT&lt;/strong&gt; individuals who have the potential to fulfill intelligence requirements as identified by analysts or policymakers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASSESS&lt;/strong&gt; the placement and access of these individuals to determine if they can provide the desired information and initiate an evaluation of their motivations, vulnerabilities, and suitability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEVELOP&lt;/strong&gt; relationships with these individuals to further assess their motivations, vulnerabilities, and suitability and to explore their receptiveness to initial tasking for intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECRUIT&lt;/strong&gt; agents and formalize the relationship with an overt recruitment pitch or by paying them for information they provide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HANDLE&lt;/strong&gt; agents by relaying collection requirements, receiving reporting information, and conducting continued assessments of their placement and access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SOURCE: CSIS RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS; AND BURKETT, “AN ALTERNATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR AGENT RECRUITMENT.”&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s isolation during most of the Cold War fostered a very different HUMINT culture, one that involved a much less prominent overseas role for the intelligence cadre. Compounding this isolation was the paranoia of the Cultural Revolution, where the relentless focus on ideological purity and widespread suspicions of foreign influence resulted in purges within the intelligence and security apparatus. The MSS did deploy some personnel abroad — for example, under journalistic cover — during the Cold War, but their primary mission was unclear. They likely assisted broader efforts to spot and assess potential sources while also collecting insights and non-public information from individuals who believed they were speaking with Chinese state media. However, none were definitively tied to sensitive recruitments within the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Chinese intelligence services have traditionally preferred that recruitments and subsequent source meetings occur inside of China or a third country. The comparatively limited overseas footprint of China’s HUMINT officers likely nurtured the culture of using proxies and cut-outs as key components in the spotting and assessing phase. In the current era, social media and the internet are increasingly used for the spotting and assessing phases, though recent cases reinforce that overseas proxies continue to be key contributors to early-stage recruiting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes the case of Jun Wei Yeo, a Singaporean national who was convicted in the United States on charges that he was serving as a spotter and assessor for the MSS. Yeo received intelligence requirements from China-based MSS officers, who relied on Yeo to spot and assess potential U.S.-based sources. Yeo’s MSS handlers had a wide range of intelligence interests, with a particular focus on non-public U.S. government information. These taskings included requests for Yeo to identify sources who could report on Southeast Asia, the U.S. Department of Commerce, artificial intelligence, and the trade war between the United States and China. On multiple occasions, Yeo met separately with different MSS officers in China, all of whom issued identical tasking. These incidents further reinforce this chapter’s broader contention that Chinese intelligence collection is more centrally directed and organized than is often appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE ROLE OF OPEN-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE AND SOCIAL MEDIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the spotting and assessing phases, recent investigations and global intelligence service statements reflect that open-source intelligence analysis — particularly the exploitation of social media — has become a preferred technique for China’s intelligence services. According to U.S., UK, and German intelligence officials, Chinese intelligence officers and proxies have conducted thousands of soft approaches on LinkedIn in recent years. More than 10,000 such incidents have occurred in the United Kingdom alone, according to MI5 chief Ken McCallum. A 2017 study conducted by Germany’s domestic intelligence service, the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), found China’s intelligence approaches on LinkedIn to match the scale observed by MI5. In its report, the BfV disclosed several inauthentic profiles and front organizations, posting as headhunters, consultants, think tanks, and scholars, who the service assessed were working for Chinese intelligence. This shift toward social media in the early phases of the recruitment process offers the Chinese intelligence services a platform to conduct low-cost, low-risk activities in the early phases of the recruitment cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several notable investigations in the United States since 2017 reflect how China’s intelligence services use LinkedIn to identify and evaluate potential sources of classified information, trade secrets, and other non-public information. In many instances, Chinese intelligence uses LinkedIn to identify and contact current and former cleared government employees or to advertise various business, consulting, and employment opportunities that may interest former members of the intelligence community or U.S. Department of Defense. Jun Wei Yeo used social media, particularly LinkedIn, extensively in his activities on behalf of the MSS. Yeo created a fake consulting company and posted job opportunities on LinkedIn. He later claimed he received over 400 resumes, 90 percent of which were submitted by current and former U.S. government and military personnel with security clearances. Yeo then forwarded the resumes to MSS officers in China for further evaluation and guidance on potential recruitment options. Yeo augmented his efforts on LinkedIn by attending public events to contact individuals from lobbying firms or defense contracting companies who could be possible targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;COMPUTER NETWORK OPERATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s bulk data theft campaigns — including operations targeting the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Equifax, Anthem, Marriott, and others — are examined in this report’s chapter on Chinese cyber operations (Chapter 4). Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the extent to which Beijing’s acquisition of this data can contribute to HUMINT operations. While these operations have been attributed to various elements of the Chinese intelligence services — primarily regional components of the MSS and the 3PLA — there is little definitive evidence available detailing how China may be weaponizing this data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the information from these operations could help HUMINT officers assess potential avenues to recruit a source. Examples might include verifying an individual’s current or prior relationship with the U.S. government, identifying whether that individual is in financial distress or poor health, scrutinizing their travel history, or shaping ways to develop an initial approach and a source development plan. Four factors typically influence an individual’s decision to spy for a foreign government: money, ideology, compromise, or ego, often referred to as “MICE.” What is known about the personal data that China has exfiltrated suggests that the information could be highly valuable for Chinese HUMINT recruiters weighing whether an individual may be vulnerable to certain recruitment approaches. The U.S.-based MSS spotter Jun Wei Yeo attested that these types of vulnerabilities, including financial troubles, job dissatisfaction, or familial issues, were what he was trained by the MSS to evaluate when assessing source candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;developing-and-recruiting&quot;&gt;DEVELOPING AND RECRUITING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotting and assessing are intended to narrow a pool of potential source candidates. It is against this smaller group that intelligence officers initiate the process of building a relationship with prospective sources. Key markers of this phase for Chinese intelligence operations include increased face-to-face contact, often in China during the source development phase. Overall, the majority of development approaches analyzed in support of this research involved offers of employment, business, consulting, or other financial opportunities, with a smaller set of individuals driven by ideological support for China and the CCP. Ultimately, postmortems of historic American espionage cases find that most spies are motivated by a combination of the MICE factors rather than by one factor alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developing and recruiting phases of the agent acquisition cycle substantially increase the volume of risk that a recruiting organization incurs. The spotting and assessing phases are largely passive, while the developing and recruiting phases are active and increasingly expose recruiters to potential discovery. China partially compensates for this risk during the development and recruitment phases by continuing its reliance on cut-outs, proxies, and other forms of cover. Chinese intelligence officers and their proxies primarily approach developmental sources under commercial or academic cover. There is a dual logic in this approach, providing plausible deniability to both recruiter and target. Recruiters present themselves as representing private or academic interests rather than China and the CCP. This approach may appeal to prospective recruits interested in rationalizing their openness to providing information to a foreign entity. In the case of Kevin Mallory, his responsiveness to initial contact via LinkedIn translated into an introduction to an individual who represented himself as working for a Chinese think tank, the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Despite these efforts to operate under the nominal cover of the academy, which is known to have close ties to the MSS, Mallory — as a former CIA and DIA officer — appears to have been aware that the individuals he met with were representatives of Chinese intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of approaches and initial taskings epitomize the developmental phases of HUMINT operations. Developmental recruits are often asked to share information that may be somewhat sensitive — though not classified — as a means to gauge the source’s responsiveness to tasking, as well as to lay the groundwork for gradually expanding the information-sharing relationship into more sensitive areas. The added exchange of money at this phase — even before any formal recruitment pitch — also establishes the terms of what will ultimately become a transactional relationship. In cases where the source is a U.S. government employee or cleared defense contractor, this information exposes the recruit to legal jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s development and recruitment of Shapour Moinian followed a similar pattern. After an initial approach on LinkedIn, Moinian traveled to Hong Kong to meet with an individual who claimed to represent a technical recruiting company seeking out aviation industry consultants. The Chinese recruiter claimed she was seeking Moinian’s “rich experiences and skills” for a client who was working on aircraft design. Moinian agreed to provide information and materials regarding various aircraft designed or manufactured in the United States, for which he was financially compensated. An unnamed UK aviation expert mentioned by MI5 in July 2022 also traveled repeatedly to China to be “wined and dined.” The Chinese interlocutors then asked and paid him for detailed technical information on military aircraft, at which point the UK government intervened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commercial cover was also a key feature of China’s recruitment of former FBI electronics technician Kun Shan “Joey” Chun. However, unlike the Mallory and Moinian cases, where the developmental phase required only of a handful of meetings, Chun’s relationship with Chinese intelligence took several years to reach the stage where he began meeting directly with Chinese government officials and providing them with sensitive FBI information. Chun’s relationship originated in 2005, when a China-based printer company solicited an investment from one of Chun’s relatives. Over the next five years, the Chinese company paid for Chun to travel on an annual basis, travel that he actively concealed from the FBI. In 2011, the company paid for a trip to Europe, where Chun met directly with a Chinese government official who told Chun he knew he worked for the FBI. At this stage, Chun began reporting information about FBI personnel, structure, technological capabilities, surveillance practices, and surveillance targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One variation of China’s efforts to appeal to commercial and economic interests of potential sources is the manner in which the intelligence services work through research institutes and universities. This includes recruitment into China’s so-called “talent plans,” such as the Thousand Talents Plan and the Hundred Talents Plan. Disaggregating the numerous licit and illicit mechanisms that China relies upon to acquire advanced technology from the United States is beyond the scope of this chapter. Nevertheless, several recent cases reveal how China’s state-affiliated research institutions and the talent plans have served as critical platforms for China to extract trade secrets and intellectual property (IP) from U.S.-based sources. Although many cases do not involve a direct connection between China’s research institutions and the intelligence services, there are some striking exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notable is the trial of Yanjun Xu, an MSS officer who was the deputy division director of the Sixth Bureau in the JSSD. In that case, the United States disclosed how the Sixth Bureau, which is responsible for overseas collection of science and technology information, worked directly with organizations such as the Jiangsu Science and Technology Promotion Association, the Aviation Industry of China (AVIC), and the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronomics (NUAA) to arrange presentations and exchanges with overseas experts known to be working on technologies that were Chinese collection priorities. This included Xu in his capacity as an MSS officer directly arranging a set of discussions in China with experts from across the global aviation industry, including representatives of at least six of the world’s leading aerospace companies. As reflected in Xu’s communications with his intelligence customers within the Chinese science and technology apparatus, the purpose of these exchanges was to elicit sensitive IP and trade secrets, including items such as design manuals, design and simulation software, composites, power systems, and other information about civilian and military aircraft. The MSS often augments its human source development efforts during “exchanges” in China by conducting technical operations against their visitors’ devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the primary methods that China uses to spot, assess, develop, and recruit sources, the final element involves the specific tradecraft that China uses to handle its human sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;handling-sources-operationalizing-intelligence-requirements&quot;&gt;HANDLING SOURCES: OPERATIONALIZING INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s global intelligence activities are merely one element of broader political warfare. Nevertheless, they are a critical element of Beijing’s approach to security competition. China’s pursuit of various forms of classified U.S. defense and intelligence information contributes to broader efforts to secure an information advantage over the United States, particularly if Beijing were to learn information about the United States that Washington believes to be protected. This logic extends into the science and technology sphere, where Chinese intelligence operations are designed to fulfill key knowledge gaps for China’s commercial and military technology research and development efforts. China’s intelligence services play a crucial role in recruiting human sources to fulfill specific customer science and technology requirements for China’s economic and military advantage. It is in this area that the case of MSS officer Yanjun Xu is so striking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously noted, Xu was a senior MSS officer assigned to the JSSD Sixth Bureau, where he was responsible for collecting overseas science and technology information. In his activities, Xu worked closely with officials in various state entities, including AVIC and the NUAA, to refine aviation-related collection requirements. For example, in 2013, Xu exchanged messages with an official at AVIC who relayed specific information that the AVIC official was seeking from Boeing, including analytical tools for Boeing’s proprietary airframe and specific portions of the &lt;em&gt;Boeing Design Manual&lt;/em&gt;. These types of exchanges are critical in understanding the specificity of Chinese science and technology collection requirements that were directly passed from state-owned enterprises and research institutions to China’s foreign intelligence service. Separate communications revealed how Xu and the MSS would report back information that had been collected. In one instance, Xu sent detailed technical information about various aspects of the KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft, requesting that the recipient review the information and provide feedback on the MSS’s report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of insights into the inner workings of the MSS and its customers manifest in the ways that China handles its human sources. In Xu’s case, the MSS and the NUAA directly collaborated to shape the specific topics that visitors would brief during their presentations in China. In one case, Xu and the NUAA official worked in tandem to encourage a U.S.-based aerospace engineer to provide a presentation on highly technical topics related to GE Aviation’s trade secrets and IP. As the relationship between Xu and the engineer progressed, Xu was clear about how information requirements were being developed, writing to the engineer: “I will touch base with the scientific research department here to see what technology is desired and I will let you know what to prepare.” Xu later refined the specific areas of interest for the engineer, expressing that there was particular interest in software, system specifications, and design processes. Later, when the engineer expressed concern about sending certain information from his GE Aviation e-mail address, Xu responded: “It might be inappropriate to send directly from the company, right?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;overseas-harassment-and-repression&quot;&gt;OVERSEAS HARASSMENT AND REPRESSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese intelligence agencies have also been increasingly active in intimidating members of the Chinese diaspora overseas and in conducting influence operations. Many of these instances are part of Operation Fox Hunt, a global and extralegal PRC effort to monitor, harass, and in some cases repatriate Chinese diaspora living abroad. In June 2023, for example, a federal jury in New York convicted three individuals of stalking and coercing several residents of the United States. In April 2023, the FBI arrested two individuals, “Harry” Lu Jianwang and Chen Jinping, in connection with opening and operating an illegal police station in Manhattan, New York City. According to the FBI and DOJ, the two individuals were working for the Fuzhou branch of the MPS to locate and conduct coercive activities against Chinese dissidents living in the United States. Lu Jianwang’s official role was president of the America Changle Association NY, a nonprofit organization whose offices housed the police outpost. In its response to the arrests, the Chinese embassy in Washington described the organization as being “provided by local overseas Chinese communities who would like to be helpful” and that “they are not police personnel from China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a separate case, the DOJ charged 40 MPS officers in April 2023 with conducting an intimidation campaign against Chinese nationals residing in the United States whose political views and actions were critical of China. The DOJ has referred to this type of activity as “repression schemes.” Also in April 2023, a federal jury convicted Pras Michel, a Grammy-winning artist and former member of the hip-hop group Fugees, of working with the MPS to conduct a clandestine campaign to influence senior U.S. officials. More broadly, the Chinese government has conducted widespread harassment of Chinese critics of China abroad, though it is not always clear if — and to what degree — Chinese intelligence and law enforcement organizations are involved. Beginning in October 2022, for example, China was allegedly involved in making more than a dozen false bomb threats at luxury hotels and embassies in Europe, the United States, the Middle East, and Asia using the names of Chinese dissidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Operation Fox Hunt, China has also engaged in Operation Skynet, a parallel program to target the finances of Chinese citizens, including dissidents, residing overseas. According to the FBI, Operation Skynet includes PRC efforts to repatriate money by some Chinese living abroad “by both restricting and seizing assets still located in the PRC.” In 2022, for example, DOJ charged Sun Hoi Ying with conducting illegal activities as part of Operation Skynet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese diplomatic officials argued that these organizations — including the so-called police stations — were not actually engaged in police and intelligence work and that they were staffed by “volunteers” who were responsible for assisting Chinese nationals with routine tasks, such as renewing drivers’ licenses. In some cases, researchers identified connections between various overseas police outposts and specific regional components of the MPS, tying such stations directly back to Chinese intelligence and law enforcement. One study of these MPS stations assessed that there are at least 104 of these outposts across 53 countries. As an FBI investigation into a Chinese police station in New York City found, the MPS was unambiguously involved in harassing members of the Chinese diaspora in the United States. According to the lead FBI agent involved in the investigation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the MPS is generally identified as the PRC’s primary domestic law enforcement agency — responsible for public safety, general criminal investigation, national security and internet security — its mission extends beyond law enforcement and into functions more associated with an intelligence service. The MPS routinely monitors, among others, Chinese political dissidents who live in the United States and in other locations outside the PRC. The MPS has used cooperative contacts both inside the PRC and around the world to influence, threaten and coerce political dissidents abroad. Indeed, I am aware that the PRC government has threatened and coerced Chinese political dissidents living in the United States in an effort to silence them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-1&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring the impact of Chinese intelligence operations as part of political warfare is challenging on several levels. The first challenge is defining what counts as intelligence operations in the modern era. China employs a wide range of licit and quasi-licit means to acquire sensitive and critical information. This includes investing in foreign firms that possess valuable IP that can support China’s military or commercial interests. It includes the use of “talent programs” and other joint research initiatives to facilitate the transfer of valuable technical knowledge back to Chinese institutions. As the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence acknowledged in a comprehensive study of the U.S. counterintelligence enterprise, competitors need not break U.S. laws to fulfill key intelligence collection needs. In one noteworthy recent study, a U.S. private intelligence firm identified 167 individuals connected to Los Alamos National Laboratory who had returned to China to work in areas critical to the PLA’s military modernization, including hypersonic weapons, deep-penetrating munitions, and undersea systems. A separate investigation by the Washington Post found that Chinese hypersonic researchers are simply purchasing from U.S. suppliers software that aids in designing and modeling hypersonic systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are concerns about cyber-enabled economic intelligence efforts, which are analyzed in this report’s chapter on Chinese cyber operations (Chapter 4). The economic and strategic benefits of these activities are vast, particularly in terms of trade secrets, military technology, and sensitive U.S. government information stolen. In 2012, then head of the National Security Agency (NSA) General Keith Alexander described cyber-enabled economic espionage as “the greatest transfer of wealth in history.” The economic loss to the United States alone is often estimated at $30–600 billion annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. economic losses also translate directly into Chinese military advances. Su Bin, a Chinese-Canadian businessman, assisted Chinese PLA cyber officers in their efforts to steal trade secrets regarding the C-17, F-22, and F-35 aircraft. This included more than 630,000 files — totaling more than 65 gigabytes — on the C-17 aircraft. Such theft allows China to evade the costs, both in time and money, to modernize its systems. For a sense of the scale of the investments that went into the three aircraft targeted during the Su Bin case, the U.S. government spent more than $100 billion over a period of more than three decades to modernize these airlift and fighter systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall economic damage caused by Chinese licit, quasi-licit, and cyber collection likely far outpaces that which can be attributed to the country’s HUMINT services. However, this is not to undersell the economic damage caused by HUMINT collection operations. Although not explicitly connected to the MSS, one recent U.S. conviction involved a scientist stealing trade secrets valued at $1 billion from a U.S. petroleum company. MSS officer Xu Yanjun worked to target GE Aviation’s processes for manufacturing composite jet engine fan blades, a technology that no other global company has duplicated in the more than 25 years since it was first certified by the Federal Aviation Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also difficult to measure the impact of Chinese efforts to acquire private information about U.S. and allied decisionmaking and policy, though it is critical to assess the totality of Chinese cases rather than isolated incidents. The reason is that Chinese intelligence officers have long recognized the value of what is often referred to as the “mosaic theory” of secrecy, in which individual facts can illuminate an otherwise opaque picture when integrated into a broader body of knowledge. As Huo and Wang wrote, “By picking here and there among the vast amount of public materials and accumulating information a drop at a time, often it is possible to basically reveal the outlines of some secret intelligence, and this is particularly true in the case of the Western countries.” Correspondingly, cases such as China’s successful recruitment of Candace Claiborne, a comparatively low-ranking U.S. State Department official, should be viewed merely as one piece within a broader mosaic. While Claiborne may not have operated within the inner circles of U.S. decisionmaking, her reporting on the periphery of these circles undoubtedly contributed to Beijing’s broader efforts to penetrate U.S. policy deliberations with respect to China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a subset of cases that have undermined U.S. and allied national security in ways that are difficult to measure — but are likely significant. Consider the damage associated with the 2015 OPM breach, during which Chinese cyber actors stole detailed background investigation information for nearly 20 million U.S. citizens. This data included “Social Security Numbers; residency and educational history; employment history; information about immediate family and other personal and business acquaintances; health, criminal and financial history; and other details,” as well as “findings from interviews conducted by background investigators and fingerprints” for some individuals. From a HUMINT targeting perspective, the Chinese government — at a minimum — is in possession of detailed dossiers on nearly 20 million Americans who have applied for access to classified information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are the instances where Chinese agents have successfully penetrated U.S. intelligence agencies and gained access to government secrets, details of overseas intelligence operations, and the identities of U.S. sources in China. The first American intelligence officer charged with spying for China was Larry Wu-Tai Chin, a retired career linguist for the CIA’s Foreign Broadcast Information Service who passed classified information to Beijing for decades before his conviction in 1986. Prosecutors said of Chin at his trial, “For 30 years, he was a direct funnel from the American intelligence community to the People’s Republic of China.” Two more recent cases are those of Jerry Chun Shing Lee and Alexander Yuk Ching Ma, both former CIA case officers. Ma’s case, which is still pending, includes the submission into evidence of a 2001 video recording of Ma and a colleague meeting with MSS officers and revealing CIA officer identities, human asset identities, operational tradecraft, and security communication practices. Lee was convicted in a 2019 case where he was discovered traveling with a notebook that included “CIA-related operational notes from asset meetings, operational meeting locations, operational phone numbers, true names of assets, and information about covert facilities.” More broadly, China has expanded its signals intelligence collection capabilities against the United States by establishing intelligence collection facilities in Cuba, roughly 100 miles from Florida, and other locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s U.S. counterparts can attest, the public often only hears about intelligence failures, not successes. Nevertheless, the cases analyzed in connection to this chapter all included notable tradecraft failures on the part of the Chinese intelligence services. One of the more amusing is that, in the closing arguments at Yanjun Xu’s trial, his defense attorneys pointed to his poor tradecraft skills as a reason to doubt the U.S. government’s contention that he was a senior MSS officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some historians of Chinese intelligence have cited the country’s lack of a strong external HUMINT tradition as one of the reasons why Beijing has compensated by building a massive cyber operations capability. However, there are some types of information critical to China’s broader strategic interests that can only be pursued with human sources. Many of the cases cited in this chapter involved tradecraft that is likely unworkable in an era of heightened technical surveillance. This observation is doubly ironic given that China itself has built the world’s most advanced surveillance state. But China’s surveillance state only resolves half of the guidance from the 2,400-year-old &lt;em&gt;Methods of the Sima&lt;/em&gt; noted at the beginning of this chapter. While Beijing has nearly perfected its ability to “observe the near,” the current era of HUMINT will require China’s spies to modernize how they “employ spies against the distant.” And the success of Chinese political warfare will hinge, to some degree, on how well China can improve its HUMINT capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyber-operations&quot;&gt;CYBER OPERATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cyberspace has become a new pillar of economic and social development, and a new domain of national security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-chinas-military-strategy-2015&quot;&gt;– China’s Military Strategy (2015)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In January 2021, Microsoft’s John Lambert was on the edge of his seat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It felt like “the moment before a firecracker goes off. You know something’s going to happen and you want to know: How loud is this going to be?” The firecracker was a massive hack of Microsoft Exchange, a product used by an estimated 1 million businesses worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial hack was concerning but not historic. An attacker used a curiously specific piece of data — targeted email addresses — to break into servers and steal address books, calendars, and email. Then, as Microsoft prepared to issue a patch, a second wave hit. Tom Burt, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for security and trust, said “All of a sudden we saw hundreds a day and then that continued to escalate until we were seeing north of several thousand a day. It was a very significant and noisy escalation.” Victims included local governments, police, hospitals, Covid-19 facilities, entities in the energy and transportation sector, airports, and prisons. Security researchers estimated that China breached more than 30,000 servers in the United States and hundreds of thousands worldwide. One former national security official called the attack “massive” and said, “We’re talking thousands of servers compromised per hour, globally.” A security researcher told Wired magazine: “China just owned the world — or at least everyone with Outlook Web Access,” the researcher said. “When was the last time someone was so bold as to just hit everyone?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft publicly attributed the attack to China relatively quickly. Researchers at the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center indicated that the culprits were both known and unknown. Several known Chinese actors had been involved, along with a wide range of unknown groups apparently operating from inside China. All were using the same exploit. The attack was stunning in its scope and brazenness but was also the latest in a long line of increasingly aggressive Chinese attacks in the cyber domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines China’s cyber operations, which play an important role in political warfare. As Benjamin Jensen argues, “Cyber coercive campaigns are online political warfare. They work in an indirect and additive manner to coerce rivals and signal resolve.” Since 2014, China has hacked and stolen the data of about 80 percent of Americans. In early 2014, Beijing hacked the health insurance company Anthem and then over the next year exfiltrated an estimated 78 million names, birth dates, and social security numbers. Beijing also hacked the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in late 2014, an attack that became public in 2015, and stole 22.1 million records, including security clearance background checks. Then in 2017, Beijing hacked credit reporting agency Equifax and stole credit information for 147.9 million Americans. Between 2014 and 2018 Beijing hacked Starwood Hotels (later purchased by Marriott) and stole reservation, credit card, passport, and other travel information from an estimated 500 million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This repeated collection of vast amounts of data means that Beijing knows more about Americans than Americans likely know about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since 2014, China has hacked and stolen the data of about 80 percent of Americans.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this chapter shows, China has developed a robust set of capabilities in the cyber domain, complete with a revamped bureaucratic structure designed to transition seamlessly between political warfare and conflict. Attacks have intensified, mirroring the “wolf warrior diplomacy” and other increasingly assertive elements of Chinese state power. Beijing’s data theft is perhaps the best known of its endeavors, but it is only one part of China’s cyber operations. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) also uses cyber tools for intelligence collection, military operations, corporate advantage, and even personal financial gain for the operators. China almost certainly is turning a massive databank into a training field for advanced artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) systems. In addition, the Chinese government is using cyber tools to create sophisticated influence campaigns and appears poised to use cyber operations for real-world effects, including attacks that could endanger lives. China’s growing sophistication and increasing aggressiveness in its campaigns mean it can compete effectively with the United States and Russia, from penetrating defense contractors to holding critical infrastructure in the United States at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the CCP and its cyber tools are not 10 feet tall. As Chinese offensive capabilities have improved, defenses in the United States have become more focused and have been given increased resources. Government entities such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) have bolstered the security of U.S. government weak spots and raised awareness in the private sector about both the threat and the responsibility to secure one’s own systems. And China’s approach is hardly foolproof. Smoothing out the seams of the massive reorganizations within the bureaucracy from 2015 and 2018 will be challenging, just as adaptation is hard for every bureaucracy. Further, in contrast to Russia, which has hidden behind ambiguity over whether actors are criminals or state-supported or both, Beijing has been public about its attempts to bring a sprawling group of hackers under the close control of the state. The rest of the world would be justified in putting Beijing on notice that attacks emanating from Chinese territory are at the very least presumed acceptable to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along these lines, this chapter seeks to explore a set of tools that function in the cyber domain to further the CCP’s larger foreign policy goals in the area of political warfare. There is crossover with other chapters — particularly those covering intelligence operations (Chapter 3), information and disinformation operations (Chapter 5), and economic coercion (Chapter 8) — because they are partially achieved using tools in the cyber domain. Examining cyber tools in its own chapter allows a thorough understanding of how China organizes itself to make the most out of use of these tools, from the bureaucratic structures in place to the decisions about how to focus efforts and deploy resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offensive cyber tools are programs designed to identify and exploit a vulnerability in an adversary’s networks, leading to the ability to map a network, find and extract data, damage computer systems, or potentially cause a system managed by a vulnerable network to function inappropriately, causing death or damage. Offensive cyber tools can establish a persistent presence for a wide range of uses, from information gathering to potential kinetic operations. Along that spectrum lie acts of cyber sabotage and eventually cyber warfare, which could include destruction of property or deaths of personnel. This chapter draws on Chinese strategy documents and military academic work to explore how Beijing approaches offensive cyber operations, nesting that activity under China’s larger strategy of “information warfare.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter is divided into the following sections. It reviews the creation and development of China’s cyber capability, maps the agencies and main actors responsible for China’s cyber program, and establishes China’s goals for its cyber program. Finally, it discusses the implications of China’s increasing skill set in cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-operations-a-key-element-of-information-warfare&quot;&gt;CYBER OPERATIONS: A KEY ELEMENT OF INFORMATION WARFARE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese doctrine views cyber operations as a core element of information warfare. The father of Chinese information warfare, Major General Wang Pufeng, summarized how information has become central to all aspects of warfighting in his seminal 1995 work &lt;em&gt;Information Warfare and the Revolution in Military Affairs&lt;/em&gt;. He wrote: “Information war is a crucial stage of high-tech war. . . . At its heart are information technologies, fusing intelligence war, strategic war, electronic war, guided missile war, a war of ‘motorization’ [jidong zhan], a war of firepower [huoli] — a total war. It is a new type of warfare.” Twenty years later, China’s 2015 Military Strategy spelled out the role of computer network operations, calling it a “new pillar of economic and social development” and a “new domain of national security.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;网络空间是经济社会发展新支柱和国家安全新领域。网络空间国际战略竞争日趋激烈，不少国家都在发展网络空间军事力量。中国是黑客攻击最大的受害国之一，网络基础设施安全面临严峻威胁，网络空间对军事安全影响逐步上升。加快网络空间力量建设，提高网络空间态势感知、网络防御、支援国家网络空间斗争和参与国际合作的能力，遏控网络空间重大危机，保障国家网络与信息安全，维护国家安全和社会稳定。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Cyberspace has become a new pillar of economic and social development, and a new domain of national security. As international strategic competition in cyberspace has been turning increasingly fierce, quite a few countries are developing their cyber military forces. Being one of the major victims of hacker attacks, China is confronted with grave security threats to its cyber infrastructure. As cyberspace weighs more in military security, China will expedite the development of a cyber force, and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defense, support for the country’s endeavors in cyberspace and participation in international cyber cooperation, so as to stem major cyber crises, ensure national network and information security, and maintain national security and social stability.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s strategy for information warfare developed over decades, and to implement this vision, China has established a robust cyber capability, both in-house in the security services and on a contract or volunteer basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-evolution-of-chinas-cyber-capabilities&quot;&gt;THE EVOLUTION OF CHINA’S CYBER CAPABILITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s cyber program started as most others, with a group of cutting-edge hackers in a small community testing out new talents and capabilities as a side job or a hobby. In May 1999, the United States became a major target. In retaliation for the United States’ accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, “patriotic hackers” defaced U.S. government websites with messages denouncing the North American Treaty Organization. Then in August 1999, Chinese private hackers targeted 10 Taiwanese government pages and left statements saying, “There is only one China in the world and the world only needs one China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military and civilian organizations grew over time, and by the early 2010s, China was a robust and increasingly sophisticated cyber power. U.S. cybersecurity firms began to uncover the scope of Chinese activity. Between 2013 and early 2016, leading cybersecurity firm Mandiant tracked at least 72 civilian, military, and ostensibly private Chinese cyber organizations operating on the world stage. Another firm, CrowdStrike, evaluated China’s cyber posture in its 2015 Global Threat Report. It found 28 Chinese cyber groups pursuing defense and law enforcement targets and many other groups attacking targets in energy, transportation, government, technology, healthcare, finance, telecommunications, media, manufacturing, and agriculture. One such unit was People’s Liberation Army (PLA) operated Unit 61398, which has reportedly stolen terabytes of data from organizations worldwide since 2006. Mandiant identified 141 companies targeted by Unit 61398, of which 115 were in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2014, Chinese cyber activity had become widespread, aggressive, and noisy, likely in part because of the sheer number of actors engaging in cyber activity with unclear deconfliction and organization. China had three departments overseeing cyber activities: the PLA, which operated 12 specialized operation bureaus; Technical Reconnaissance Bureaus (TRB) for each military region; and the Ministry of State Security (MSS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the exact reasons for the timing are unclear, 2015 became a watershed moment for China’s cyber capabilities. Beijing appears to have decided that its cyber efforts needed better coordination and centralized control, and it embarked on a massive reorganization of its military cyber units. These efforts were likely built from Xi Jinping’s reforms launched in 2012, when he became general secretary of the CCP. At the 18th Central Committee meeting that same year, Xi told the Third Plenary that “in the face of the rapid development of Internet technology and applications, the current management system has obvious drawbacks, such as multi-management, overlapping functions, inconsistent powers and responsibilities, and efficiency.” A Xinhua article at the time compared the organization of China’s cyber operations to “water control at Kowloon,” suggesting uncontrolled growth and lack of organization, with a degree of improvisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some commentators have suggested that a summit between President Obama and President Xi in 2015 was a turning point. The United States had been increasingly vocal about its impatience with Chinese intellectual property (IP) and other data theft and had been increasing diplomatic pressure. That diplomacy culminated in a summit in Washington, D.C., in September 2015. At the summit, both powers agreed not to conduct economically motivated cyber espionage — a subset of China’s collection, but a large one. At the press conference announcing the agreement, Xi said, “China strongly opposes and combats the theft of commercial secrets and other kinds of hacking attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little evidence exists that the summit was causal. Given the timing of the rollout of a complicated reorganization in December, just a few months later, it was more likely the CCP had already planned the policy shift and used the summit as a way to win diplomatic points for a decision that was already made. Within a year of the summit, serious doubts had emerged about whether China had slowed down its cyber espionage activity, or whether it had in fact refocused its efforts. As a Council on Foreign Relations analysis concluded in 2016, Chinese entities “may be becoming more stealthy and sophisticated in their attacks,” noting that Assistant Attorney General John Carlin said China had reduced the volume of attacks but had become more focused and calculated. Leading cybersecurity researchers published papers reporting that the volume of Chinese cyberattacks on the United States had lessened, but espionage continued in particular strategically significant sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE GREAT REFOCUSING: THE CREATION OF THE PLA STRATEGIC SUPPORT FORCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s 2015 Military Strategy laid out a clear goal: “China will expedite the development of a cyber force and enhance its capabilities of cyberspace situation awareness, cyber defense, [and] support for the country’s endeavors in cyberspace.” In 2015, to further that goal, the PLA moved cyber capabilities from widely scattered and loosely coordinated forces into a largely coherent, centralized group within a new organization: the Strategic Support Force (SSF). SSF was created to prepare China for twenty-first century warfare, uniting most of the PLA’s cyber, space, electromagnetic, and psychological warfare capabilities under one chain of command. The SSF seeks to disrupt an adversary’s capabilities to conduct warfare, in particular by sabotaging command systems — or systems of systems — in the early stages of a conflict. Further, it seeks to create a nearly seamless transition to a war footing by creating permanent operational groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the SSF, the Network Systems Department (NSD) oversees cyber and information warfare. The reorganization pursued a “bricks, not clay” approach, which means that units were generally kept whole as the bigger structures were deconstructed and rearranged. For example, PLA Unit 69010 pre-2015 was the Lanzhou Military Region’s second TRB. In the reorganization, it was reassigned largely intact to the SSF NSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2015, Mandiant described a much more targeted effort by Chinese cyber entities associated with the PLA. They assessed that the focus for many Chinese actors shifted from IP theft to strategic intelligence collection and the establishment of persistent accesses for potential future use. The number of actors decreased precipitously as well. Mandiant reported in 2016 that they had seen a dramatic drop in cyber espionage from 72 suspected China-based groups. Mandiant researchers cited several factors, “including President Xi’s military and political initiatives, the widespread exposure of Chinese cyberoperations, and mounting pressure from the U.S. Government.” Similarly, the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology hypothesized that China was attempting to control its operatives and better focus its efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment five years later laid out what the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) saw as the main targets of MSS-affiliated actors, which reflect this narrower focus on strategic topics: high-tech manufacturing; medical device, civil, and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; and defense. One DOJ indictment charges the defendants with conspiring to steal trade secrets, including “technology designs, manufacturing processes, test mechanisms and results, source code, and pharmaceutical chemical structures.” There is a clear selection bias in this kind of data collection. The U.S. government only knows about the activity it has found, or that victims have reported, and such reporting is highly inconsistent. Further, the publicly available data are from only those cases the DOJ felt it had the evidence to pursue. However, the conjunction of a reorganization of China’s cyber activity and a seemingly narrower scope of targets can logically be seen as more than a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY’S EVOLUTION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the SSF looms large in China’s cyber posture, the MSS has a robust set of activities at least partially focused on the United States. Civil-military cyber integration is a core tenet of the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development, which was created in January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSS undertook its own reorganization in 2018 to better focus its activities. As of 2022, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission reported that the MSS “conducts most [of China’s] global cyberespionage operations and targets political, economic, and personally identifiable information to achieve China’s strategic objectives.” Indeed, the MSS was almost certainly responsible for the Microsoft Exchange hack detailed at the beginning of this chapter. Microsoft dubbed that threat group “HAFNIUM.” Recorded Future named MSS as the actor behind APT3/GOTHIC PANDA in 2017, and Crowdstrike pointed to the MSS as the actor behind APT10/STONE PANDA in 2018. GOTHIC PANDA pursued a variety of technology and other targets in the United States until 2015, then shifted its focus to Hong Kong in 2016, likely in advance of Hong Kong’s elections. GOTHIC PANDA was also likely involved in the 2018 attack on the Winter Games in South Korea. STONE PANDA has been responsible for attacks on managed service providers and their customers to secure IP and confidential business data, including in Brazil, Canada, Sweden, India, Switzerland, Finland, Japan, Germany, France, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSS also oversees two civilian agencies: the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations and the China Information Technology Security Evaluation Center. The former ostensibly acts as a think tank, carrying out track 1.5 dialogues and engaging in discussions about cyber norms with European and U.S. think tanks. The latter collects information about vulnerabilities in software and hardware products, which it likely passes along to the MSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another civilian agency, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), is the central internet regulator and primary control, oversight, and censor agency of the country. While the relationship between the MSS and CAC is not clear from publicly available documents, they likely at least share information. In October 2017, the CAC released a key policy document highlighting the CCP’s perspectives on cyberspace ahead of the National Congress. The document included a directive to “promote the deepened development of military-civilian integration for cybersecurity and informatization,” which prompted the PLA to strengthen its partnerships with the civilian sector, notably giants such as Huawei and ZTE. Following the 2018 round of governmental reform, the CAC was elevated to the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF PRIVATE AND SEMI-PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has a further, expansive set of ostensibly private or semi-private organizations working on the cybersecurity mission. For example, the National Cybersecurity Center (NCC), formerly the National Cybersecurity Talent and Innovation Base, lies at the heart of realizing China’s ambition to become a cyber powerhouse. The new center has been under construction since 2017 in Wuhan and houses multiple research and talent centers, laboratories, and an operational national cybersecurity school. The NCC’s two non-private laboratories, the Combined Cybersecurity Research Institute and the Offense-Defense Lab, both perform cybersecurity research for the Chinese government. Under civil-military fusion, the NCC has established links to the PLA so that the military can harness the new research and tools being developed in their asymmetric operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development, which was established in December 2017. The center, which currently operates within one of China’s premier cybersecurity companies, 360 Enterprise Security Group, is charged with enhancing private sector cooperation to help ensure the military wins future cyber wars. Other examples of national agencies include the China National Cyber Threat Intelligence Collaboration (CNTIC), established in 2017 by government agencies and leading cybersecurity companies, and the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team, which supports the CNTIC. Both are defensively oriented, with a mission to collect cyber threat data, analyze it, and share it among national elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the CCP’s military and civilian agencies are likely to employ a large hacking community to conduct offensive cyber operations. Before the 2015 reorganization, one theory of China’s cyber activity suggested intelligence officers loosely oversaw an unstructured cluster of patriotic hackers. Since these groups could undermine the more political objectives of regular PLA cyber units if allowed to operate unrestrained, they were likely tasked with surveillance and espionage only rather than offensive cyber operations that would target critical infrastructure or cause physical damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to state-affiliated hackers, a group of cyber volunteers called “hacktivists” operates independently. These web-based communities are layered by several interest groups, such as malware tool developers, legitimate security researchers, and novices seeking training. These groups have engaged in large-scale politically motivated denial-of-service attacks, web defacement of foreign networks, and data destruction — activities that fall under “hacktivism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSS continues to empower its hacker community by hiring them as contractors to launch offensive cyber activities against foreign actors — including the United States — to steal trade secrets and exfiltrate data. DOJ indictments link the MSS to private contractors for cyber espionage activity. For example, one such indictment alleges that Ding Xiaoyang, Chen Qingmin, and Zhu Yunmin were Hainan State Security Department officers “responsible for coordinating, facilitating, and managing hackers at MSS front companies.” In 2007 and 2008, the First Research Institute of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), which supports the operational elements of the MPS, posted information security and programming job vacancies on EvilOctal.com and XFOcus.net, two of the largest and most established hacker communities in China. This action demonstrates the government’s efforts to recruit from the hacker community and likely build consulting relationships. The founding member of Chinese hacker group Javaphile, who led attacks on the White House in 2001, maintains a formal consulting relationship with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and also possesses researcher credentials at the information security engineering institute of a leading Chinese university. As the U.S.-China Commission reported:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s cybersecurity legislation weaponizes the country’s cybersecurity industry and research by requiring companies and researchers to submit all discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities to the government before providing them to the vendors that can patch them. This policy, leveraged in combination with domestic hacking competitions and cooperative agreements with Chinese universities, provides China’s security services with a steady stream of vulnerabilities to exploit for state-sponsored operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the same evolution that most nation-state cyber efforts experienced from the 1990s through today, China’s cyber structures have undergone rapid and comprehensive reform in two bouts, in 2015 and 2018. As of 2023, the rapid reform efforts seem to have concluded, leaving the hard work of creating new internal norms, sharing practices, and developing bureaucratic fixes to new processes. While any new bureaucracy takes time to form and smooth out practices across new silos, it is likely that these reforms will largely accomplish the intended goal of centralizing decisionmaking and gaining stronger command and control over cyber efforts, given the new decisionmaking structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-goals-of-offensive-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;THE GOALS OF OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese actors pursue activity in the cyber domain for three main reasons. The first is to steal secrets about adversary intent or capability. The second reason is to establish access points for disruption or pre-positioned destructive tools for conflict contingencies. The third reason is to help Chinese businesses leapfrog their Western competition or to enable personal financial gain. To identify these three main goals and assess the weight of each line of effort, CSIS researchers created a dataset of Chinese cyber operations from 2010 to 2022, examining 49 major incidents that were publicly reported and credibly attributed to the Chinese government. While the data is imperfect — some incidents reported as one campaign had several sub-components, and other incidents have imprecise details — there are some preliminary trends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Twelve of the major attacks were directed at a government entity, including several U.S. state governments in 2022;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An estimated 12 of these incidents involved an attack on a defense entity, including the U.S. Navy and aerospace contractors in 2018;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eight were upstream attacks where hackers breached a service provider that would in turn provide access to other potential targets. For example, one attack encompassed hacks of 13 telecom networks beginning in 2016;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In more than half of the incidents, Chinese actors sought to steal industrial secrets, IP, or sensitive government data; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At least three of the attacks could be characterized as operational preparation of the environment, where the Chinese hackers sought vulnerabilities in U.S. and Australian government systems and in oil and gas infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited dataset makes drawing conclusions about trend lines in types of attacks risky, but the variety of targets is noteworthy, as is the focus on stealing information. One cluster is worth highlighting: a series of attacks on defense contractors in 2018 and 2019, corresponding with MSS reorganization. This cluster of attacks suggests that a concerted effort to go after defense secrets corresponded with a refocusing of MSS activities in the reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these reasons could encompass potentially dangerous and escalatory activity, but they are well in line with what other nations attempt. Under the goal of espionage, the hallmark of Chinese activity is the quantity of data stolen and the diversity of the target set. This practice reveals a secondary strategic goal: a likely attempt to create and train a world-class AI/ML capability. The most worrisome of the three goals is China’s ability to create kinetic effects, including potential destruction of critical infrastructure, a problem set discussed below in more detail. The next section explores each of the three goals in more depth: espionage, operations, and financial motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-tools-for-espionage&quot;&gt;CYBER TOOLS FOR ESPIONAGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most nation-states, China has worked to create a cyber operations capability to collect information on its adversaries. Those activities include normal nation-state goals, such as attempting to discern intentions. For example, in 2008 entities linked to the Chinese government broke into the campaigns of both Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama to gain insight into each potential administration’s China policy. One item apparently stolen was a draft letter from McCain to the newly elected president of Taiwan, in which McCain pledged his support for the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. But before the McCain staff finalized the letter, the Chinese embassy called to complain. Randall Scriver, then serving as a McCain campaign aide, was thoroughly surprised by the call. He said, “It certainly struck me as odd that they would be so well-informed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s efforts have spanned political and military targets, with a focus on defense contractors. China attempted to break into TRANSCOM systems about 50 times between 2012 and 2013, with 20 of those attacks successful. A Senate Armed Services Committee investigation found that TRANSCOM was only aware of two of those intrusions. From 2007 to 2009, Chinese hackers broke into defense contractors responsible for building the F-35 fighter and stole information about the design and electronics systems. At the same time, attackers accessed the U.S. Air Force’s air traffic control system, which showed the locations of U.S. military aircraft in flight. In early 2018, a Naval Undersea Warfare Centre contractor lost signals and sensor data, cryptographic information related to communications, and the submarine development unit’s electronic warfare library. Two China-linked advanced persistent threats (APTs) even targeted universities engaged in naval research with military applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has also worked to develop a robust offensive counterintelligence capability for both tactical and strategic purposes, some of which is discussed in Chapter 3. In advance of a Chinese official’s visit to an unnamed country, an APT stole local call records and the guest list at his hotel, suggesting a security sweep. On a strategic level, the massive data breaches of OPM in 2015, in which the data of an estimated 22.1 million people was stolen, and Starwood/Marriott hotels, in which the data of an estimated 500 million guests was stolen, might show which Americans with security clearances travelled where and when, potentially exposing sensitive military or intelligence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OPERATIONAL PREPARATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An eye-popping headline about a massive breach makes the operation seem sudden, but computer network operations usually require months of preparation. Operators must research vulnerabilities, create a tool, find a way into the target, and map the target’s network, all before data extraction or kinetic effects. As a result, China has put significant effort into operational preparation of the environment (OPE): identifying vulnerabilities and establishing access points for future exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a prominent Chinese defense journal, &lt;em&gt;Guofang Keji&lt;/em&gt;, scholars highlighted the importance of this kind of reconnaissance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cyberspace reconnaissance operations are mission behaviors to obtain information about opponents or potential opponents’ cyberspace operations and network resources. The network information of reconnaissance is the prerequisite basis for all cyber combat operations and can also be used to verify current intelligence or predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors describe two types of attacks. The first is “information utilization,” or “soft kill” attacks; the second is “high-precision physical destruction of hardware,” such as information technology infrastructure. These forms of attack have the benefits of “remote control, flexible maneuverability, strong destructive power, and small collateral damage. It is also a basic means of network warfare.” OPE is necessary for precision and effectiveness in both types of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The danger of OPE, however, is that the tactics, tools, and procedures look similar — if not identical — to activity designed to destroy or disable an adversary’s capabilities. As a result, the target may not be able to tell whether the activity is designed to steal information or cause destruction. The escalatory implications of this dynamic have yet to be tested in a real-world, high-tension situation. However, Chinese scholars have identified the potential for problems: “Active cyber reconnaissance can mislead opponents into believing that cyber combat operations have begun, prompting them to be exposed as soon as possible, so as to achieve better reconnaissance results. Therefore, the cyber reconnaissance capability is the primary core capability of the cyberspace support force construction.” They seem to suggest this activity is not to be taken lightly, which may help Western nations to persuade Beijing to adopt international norms about state behavior. China’s OPE includes recruiting routers and networks for potential future operations. In October, the National Security Agency (NSA), CISA, and the FBI issued a cybersecurity advisory warning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Chinese hacking groups have exploited publicly known vulnerabilities to breach anything from unpatched small office/home office (SOHO) routers to medium and even large enterprise networks. Once compromised, the threat actors used the devices as part of their own attack infrastructure as command-and-control servers and proxy systems they could use to breach more networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, considerable amounts of Chinese cyber activities have been devoted to penetrating telecoms. These access points are force multipliers for intelligence services because an upstream attack on a telecommunications company can provide access to a host of additional targets — including all the customers of that telecommunications company. A researcher at Michigan State University found that penetrating the telecommunication sector had become the number one Chinese cyber espionage focus as of 2021, above even government targets. He wrote: “The versatility offered by telecommunications targeting combined with the more efficient and stealthier methods used is believed to indicate a higher level of maturity among active Chinese APTs.” In 2022, Chinese hackers went after Middle Eastern telecoms, using keylogger and PowerShell scripts designed to gather email content. The threat group, known as BackDoorDiplomacy, had been targeting diplomatic entities and telecommunications companies in Africa and the Middle East since at least 2017 — an apparent shift from its early government-focused efforts starting in 2010. A joint cybersecurity advisory in June 2022 from NSA, CISA, and the FBI outlined how Chinese actors compromise major telecommunications companies and network service providers, noting “they establish a broad network of compromised infrastructure and use the network to exploit a wide variety of targets worldwide.” As another assessment concludes, “Telecommunication firms are extremely high-value targets for intelligence agencies. . . . Successfully hacking them can mean opening doors to an even bigger world of prized spying opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI TRAINING&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After China’s first big data breaches, some commentators wondered how it might make so much data usable. William Evanina, former director of the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center, described China as “shop-vac oriented,” referring to the vast quantities of apparently non-differentiated information pulled into Beijing’s control between 2015 and 2018. The leading theory among security researchers on the purpose of that data collection effort is based on China’s stated intent to create a world-leading AI/ML capability. Data holdings from these entities were probably already structured, making it easier to use them to train AI algorithms. Further, U.S. data sets are likely more diverse than Chinese data sets, making them much better training data for AI/ML systems. The Anthem hack, which gave Beijing 78 million customer records, likely provided useful information on medical conditions and treatment plans that could further China’s biotech and pharmacological efforts. These data sets have the added benefit of providing insight potentially useful for future influence operations. In another example, TikTok’s data-gathering capability reveals what media Americans find most engaging and what kinds of messages are most effective, which enables China to develop compelling messages that serve China’s larger interests. TikTok, which is also discussed in Chapter 5, could be both an effective research tool and an efficient delivery mechanism for messages promoting China’s view of state surveillance and Taiwan as part of China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-tools-for-operations-information-operations-disruption-and-kinetic-effects&quot;&gt;CYBER TOOLS FOR OPERATIONS: INFORMATION OPERATIONS, DISRUPTION, AND KINETIC EFFECTS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cyber domain has proven fruitful for collecting information and for conducting a range of other operations, from creating access for information operations to disrupting adversary plans and causing physical damage. China has become a premier player in information operations, in line with their stated strategies, and cyber tools have facilitated some of those propaganda campaigns. Cyber operations can also harass or disrupt an adversary — increasing friction of decisionmaking in a crisis, making communication challenging, or blocking access to important data. Finally, cyber operations can cause physical harm, for example, if a cyber tool is used to break equipment, cause a fire, or take a hospital offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explores this set of operations and what is known about Chinese capabilities. Thebroader goals and capabilities in the information operations space are discussed in Chapter 5, but this section deals with cyber operations that create accesses or collect information that can later be used to shape ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CYBER OPERATIONS TO ENABLE INFORMATION OPERATIONS: ACCESS TO MEDIA AND ELECTION SYSTEMS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information operations contain a broad bucket of activity, including efforts to shape an adversary’s view of a conflict or potential conflict or efforts to weaken an adversary from within. Information operations take place in multiple ways with many tools, but increasingly they are executed in the cyber domain through social media or using tools such as deepfakes. This section briefly touches on using the cyber domain not just for spreading information payloads but for accessing force multipliers for information operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyber actors seek unauthorized access to websites, media outlets, or election systems in order to spread information payloads seemingly from inside the system or to disrupt operations. For example, China’s first recorded cyber operation against the United States was an information operation: the 1999 defacement of U.S. government websites with messages denouncing NATO in retaliation for the United States’ accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is increasing its attacks on the media and entertainment sector, with an estimated 75 percent of China’s media targets based in the Asia-Pacific. In 2013, Beijing-linked hackers retaliated against the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; after both newspapers published articles alleging that the Chinese prime minister’s family had accumulated tremendous wealth. Nearly a decade later, Mandiant uncovered that hackers linked to the Chinese government had compromised email accounts at the Wall Street Journal and maintained a presence on their systems for at least two years, from 2020 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While election influence is attempting to influence voters’ minds to vote a certain way, or not to vote at all, interference is an attempt to disrupt the election systems themselves. This disruption can occur by deleting voter information so that voters cannot check in at a polling station or spreading misinformation about where, when, or how to vote in order to prevent people from voting. In 2022, China conducted operations that may have been aimed at election interference. China exploited the “log4j” vulnerability — a critical flaw in a widely used logging tool — and zero-day vulnerabilities to gain access to at least six state governments, and probably more. One ingress route was through an application called USAHerds, which U.S. states use to detect and track livestock disease outbreaks. China has previously also shown interest in stealing IP related to U.S. agriculture, suggesting cyber operators may have used an older access point to pivot to a new use — election interference. Separately, NSA issued a warning in 2022 that Chinese hackers scanned more than 100 state-level political party domains “likely so the PRC cyber actor could build a target network for possible future operations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISRUPTION AND KINETIC EFFECTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it does not appear that China has attempted kinetic operations in the cyber domain, Chinese military theory acknowledges the possibility. The Chinese military has also endeavored to find gaps in the defenses of critical infrastructure. Writing in &lt;em&gt;Guofang Keji&lt;/em&gt;, several Chinese military scholars noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The physical level requires the realization of the vertical and horizontal connection and integration of various combat units and combat elements, unified command, unified control and unified coordination. The information level requires the controllability, sharing, and robustness of command information. The above-mentioned command and control capabilities play a decisive role in the control of cyberspace and the success or failure of operations, so they have become one of the core capabilities of cyberspace combat power construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FBI and CISA have warned of long-standing Chinese efforts to identify gaps in the security of critical infrastructure such as oil and gas systems. CISA recently revealed details about Chinese attacks on oil and gas companies from 2011 to 2013. China has targeted at least 23 natural gas pipelines with spearphishing emails. Of these, 13 were confirmed compromises, 3 were “near misses,” and 8 intrusions were successful but of unknown severity. FBI and CISA assessed that Chinese government actors were seeking the ability to hold pipeline infrastructure at risk in order to potentially physically damage pipelines or disrupt operations. Mandiant confirmed that this line of effort is a persistent one for Beijing. Multiple threat actors tied to China have targeted industrial control systems (ICSs), including “an energy company, multiple natural gas pipeline companies, an ICS equipment manufacturer, and an ICS security firm.” Mandiant also identified the “Pulse Attacks,” which exploited a weakness in a software system called Pulse Secure, which allows people to work remotely. Chinese entities used the vulnerability to target the U.S. government and critical infrastructure, including the country’s largest water agency, the New York City subway system, and Verizon. A security researcher called it a targeted attack against a few dozen networks that all have national significance in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to critical infrastructure systems is one thing; use of that access is another. China’s intentions are still unclear. China may be exploring vulnerabilities to identify what kind of disruptive effects are possible, or it could hope for a deterrent effect, betting that the U.S. government will identify the activity. It could also be collecting accesses as OPE or contingency plans in case of conflict. The ODNI in its 2021 annual threat assessment warned that China can, “at a minimum” bring “temporary and localized” disruptions to U.S. critical infrastructure through cyberattacks. In 2022, the annual threat assessment went even further, saying “China almost certainly is capable of launching cyberattacks that would disrupt critical infrastructure services within the United States, including against oil and gas pipelines and rail systems.” Both were silent on intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-tools-for-financial-gain&quot;&gt;CYBER TOOLS FOR FINANCIAL GAIN&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government approaches public-private partnerships in a far different way than most Western governments. Beijing can and does compel businesses to cooperate with state priorities whether or not the outcome is helpful to the company’s bottom line. Beijing has also used state resources to advance the business interests of purportedly private entities. Cyber operations have long played a role in China’s larger strategy of IP theft to leap ahead of competitors. According to at least one assessment, China has stolen more secrets from businesses and governments than any other country. In 2011, China breached the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to such an extent that even the thermostats were communicating with a computer in China and a printer began printing in Chinese. In 2012, General Keith Alexander, then head of NSA, described cyber-enabled economic espionage as “the greatest transfer of wealth in history.” The economic loss to the United States alone is often estimated at $30–600 billion annually. Industrial and economic espionage tends to track with China’s five-year economic development plans. The Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology assessed that “most of the technology needed to realize the 13th five-year plan will likely be acquired by stealing trade secrets from companies in other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI has been working to raise public awareness about this threat and to encourage businesses to better secure their systems. In 2018, then deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein said, “More than 90 percent of the department’s cases alleging economic espionage over the past seven years involve China and more than two-thirds of the department’s cases involving thefts of trade secrets are connected to China.” Rosenstein explicitly tied several of these crimes back to the MSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large-scale industrial hacking for research and development helps Chinese industry, but individual or small groups of hackers also moonlight for their own personal financial gain. China’s cadres of contractor hackers have been known to pursue both goals. For example, APT41, also known as BARIUM or WICKED PANDA, has used the same malware for espionage and also for financially motivated activity, largely directed at the video game industry. Mandiant wrote in their groundbreaking paper on APT41 that while purely financial goals are unusual among Chinese state-sponsored groups, “evidence suggests APT41 has conducted simultaneous cyber crime and cyber espionage operations from 2014 onward.” The DOJ indicted seven alleged members of APT41 in 2020 and tied them to a contractor known as Chengdu 404, who has worked for the MSS. The DOJ cited espionage on behalf of the MSS and cybercrime in the indictment. While little information exists on the extent to which government authorities condone or support such activity, condemnation by the government would almost certainly result in cessation of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;attribution&quot;&gt;ATTRIBUTION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing clear standards for attribution, along with confidence levels for those standards, will be important for reacting to Chinese cyber activity quickly. Standards for attribution are different in the private sector than in the intelligence community, resulting in an occasional mismatch where a private researcher attempting to make headlines is willing to be forward leaning in an assessment, but the intelligence community disagrees or expresses uncertainty. That mismatch can make the U.S. government look indecisive and vulnerable. Policymakers should fully understand the intelligence community’s attribution standards and be ready to publicly explain their posture regarding investigating an attack. They should also be prepared to act in the face of some uncertainty. Perfect knowledge is an unrealistic standard in war and intelligence work, and the cyber domain is no different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mandiant’s 2013 report &lt;em&gt;APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units&lt;/em&gt; was one of the first and still most high-profile cases of public attribution of a cyberattack to the Chinese government. The report traced APT1’s activity back to Shanghai and identified the group as the Second Bureau of the PLA General Staff Department’s Third Department, also known as Unit 61398. A year later, the DOJ indicted five Chinese army officials for engaging in the economic espionage exposed in the Mandiant report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indictments are rare in comparison to the scope of Chinese hacking activity, but DOJ has pursued charges several times in the last five years. In 2021, the United States charged four Chinese nationals in a global hacking campaign that targeted dozens of U.S. companies, universities, and government agencies in the United States and abroad. In December 2018, the DOJ indicted two Chinese hackers from the MSS-affiliated group APT10, who infiltrated U.S. Navy contractors’ systems to steal ship maintenance data and missile plans. Earlier the same year, the DOJ indicted MSS officers and hackers who had conspired over several years to steal commercial aviation and technological data from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases where the CCP has responded to public attribution of cyberattacks, there has always been strict denial and often condemnation of what the CCP describes as efforts to intentionally tarnish China’s reputation. In 2013, the Obama administration publicly and directly accused China’s military of conducting cyber operations against U.S. defense contractors and network systems. The Pentagon’s annual report to Congress stated, “computer systems . . . owned by the U.S. government continued to be targeted for intrusions, some of which appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military.” In response, the CCP condemned the report, instead claiming that China is against all forms of cyberattacks and is open to conversing with the United States on internet security. After a Chinese threat actor was suspected of infiltrating the networks of Afghan telecommunications providers in 2020 and 2021, a Chinese embassy spokesperson said, “Linking cyber attacks directly to one certain government is a highly sensitive political issue. China hopes that relevant parties will adopt a professional and responsible attitude.” Xinhua News Agency, China’s official state news agency, described the West’s attributions as slander and instead argued that “the United States, posing a grave threat to global cybersecurity, is commanding the allies it spies on to slander China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-2&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Crowdstrike declared that China surpassed Russia as the most prolific nation-state mounting attacks on Western entities. At the time, China was shifting its targets from largely commercial secrets to strategically targeted collection. Since 2018, Beijing has cemented its cyber strategy, developed its capabilities, and cultivated a certain boldness in its operations that reflects its larger posture toward the world and increased use of political warfare. As highlighted in Chapter 8, projects such as the Digital Silk Road have embedded Chinese communications equipment in systems around the globe, potentially making access for the purposes of both surveillance and control quite easy. U.S. businesses have increasingly become aware of the threat from China to their IP and realized they are a target, but Chinese offensive capabilities are expanding just as defense is improving. The future will need to include layered defense and a mindset of unity of effort, whereby businesses see the incentive for sharing information about attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these tremendous advances, China still suffers from several weaknesses, and its vulnerabilities are exploitable. Beijing’s cyber cadre is generally composed of fast followers, meaning they copy other approaches. For example, China seemed to copycat some of Russia’s influence tactics after 2016, but slowly. U.S. policymakers were already on the lookout for similar tactics, making China’s activity more easily identifiable. Likewise, businesses are aware of the threat and are shoring up defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s centralized approach could be an additional weakness. Xi’s attempt to exert more centralized control over cyber operations will lead to more unity of effort and less rogue or vigilante activity. However, approvals for actions likely would need to run through official processes, dramatically reducing agility and limiting opportunistic action. Decisions made by committee also tend to squelch more innovative approaches. Further, the CCP has hardly demonstrated an appetite for risk, and the reorganization was likely in part to limit the chances that an unapproved operation went forward. U.S. policymakers could build on this concern and make clear that Beijing will be held responsible for operations emanating from its territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for exploitable vulnerabilities, China has several. The financial motivation of some of their top hacking talent could be used against them, in particular if their freelancing has attracted the ire of Chinese leadership. Hackers in trouble could be encouraged to defect, bringing valuable knowledge of Chinese cyber operations and adding to the United States’ pool of talent. Chinese scholars have also admitted in journal articles that the CCP does not truly understand its own defensive posture or its own gaps. Beijing remains concerned about the West’s capabilities. Their new structure and goal of jointness have not been tested, so the capability of running joint operations with a cyber overlay is still theoretical. Finally, the more China seeks to protect its hacking cadre from the outside world, the more stovepiped they will become as well as less knowledgeable about tactics, techniques, and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;information-and-disinformation-operations&quot;&gt;INFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION OPERATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will accelerate the development of China’s discourse and narrative systems, better tell China’s stories, make China’s voice heard, and present a China that is credible, appealing, and respectable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-xi-jinping-2&quot;&gt;– Xi Jinping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This chapter examines Chinese information and disinformation operations, an important component of political warfare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As Thomas Rid argues in his study of political warfare during the Cold War:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At-scale disinformation campaigns are attacks against a liberal epistemic order, or a political system that places its trust in essential custodians of factual authority. These institutions — law enforcement and the criminal justice system, public administration, empirical science, investigative journalism democratically control intelligence agencies — prize facts over feelings, evidence over emotion, observations over opinion. . . . Disinformation operations, in essence, erode the very foundation of open societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China views the information environment as central to its internal stability, as a key domain through which to compete with the United States, and as a core element of its military strategy across the entire spectrum of warfare and competition. While several other chapters touch on influence in various ways — including those that deal with intelligence operations, cyber operations, the united front, and economic coercion — this chapter provides the most in-depth analysis of Chinese information and disinformation efforts. As used here, disinformation includes false information that is deliberately intended to mislead an audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter finds that Xi Jinping has prioritized the central role of information and disinformation operations in China’s global strategy. Speaking at the 20th Party Congress in October 2022, for example, Xi said: “We will accelerate the development of China’s discourse and narrative systems, better tell China’s stories, make China’s voice heard, and present a China that is credible, appealing, and respectable.” Xi used his platform at the 20th National Congress to promote the narrative that Beijing must bolster its “international discourse power” (国际话语权) to exert the influence that a nation of its political, economic, and military strength is entitled to on the global stage. Accordingly, China makes extensive use of information and disinformation that promote bias and misleading information to publicize and advance its international political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter is divided into four sections. First, it examines Chinese public diplomacy. Second, it analyzes Chinese media — including social media — overseas. Third, it assesses lawful political influence and information activities. Fourth, it concludes by highlighting some of the main trends in Chinese information and disinformation operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-public-diplomacy&quot;&gt;CHINESE PUBLIC DIPLOMACY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s official representatives amplify key messaging themes that China employs to promote its interests abroad by leveraging various public diplomacy mechanisms, including speeches, articles, social media, and foreign broadcast engagements. These activities exist at the lowest end of the spectrum of aggression of Chinese information and disinformation operations. Their connection to the state, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and increasingly Xi Jinping’s vision of China’s role in global affairs is almost entirely overt. In many respects, Beijing’s public diplomacy practices are consistent with routine state behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China uses two mechanisms to execute its public diplomacy strategy. The first is a wide body of highly positive messaging designed to promote and advance China’s narrative about building alternative models for global governance untethered from the post-war Anglocentric “rules-based order.” These activities directly reflect Xi’s guidance to “tell China’s story well” (讲好中国故事) and to bolster the country’s “international discourse power” (国际话语权). This positivist messaging is complemented by the more confrontational, antagonistic approach of China’s “wolf warrior” diplomats. If Beijing’s positivist messaging is intended to promote China’s efforts to “guide reforms of the global governance system with the principle of fairness and justice,” then the purpose of the more confrontational approach is to point out the hypocrisies and contradictions in the existing world order that justify a power shift away from the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore the dynamics of both the positivist and negativist elements of Chinese public diplomacy, CSIS compiled and analyzed two datasets. First, the team analyzed Chinese speeches and articles, including those by Xi Jinping, from such sources as CSIS’s &lt;em&gt;Interpret: China&lt;/em&gt; library. Second, the team scraped and analyzed the tweets of prominent CCP spokespersons. Together, these sources enable the research team to identify and analyze key themes in China’s messaging and consider China’s two contrasting but complimentary approaches to public diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-positivist-approach&quot;&gt;THE POSITIVIST APPROACH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s positivist messaging is designed to promote positive narratives about China’s strategy, policy, and intentions. Xi Jinping and other CCP leaders frequently tout China’s accomplishments and describe China, and more specifically the CCP, as a benevolent force for good in the world. For example, in his keynote address at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit, Xi described the achievements and ambitions of the CCP:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Working for the people’s wellbeing has been the original aspiration the Chinese Communist Party cherishes all the way. With the goal of moderate prosperity in all respects achieved, China has embarked on a new journey towards building a modern socialist country. The Chinese people are brimming with a greater sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security with each passing day. It is the unswerving goal of the CCP to run our own house well, ensure a happy life for the 1.4 billion plus Chinese people, and advance the lofty cause of promoting peace and development of all mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-wolf-warrior-approach&quot;&gt;THE WOLF WARRIOR APPROACH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Xi Jinping, China’s public diplomacy is increasingly designed not only to elevate China but to discredit and ultimately displace the United States and its allies. This “wolf warrior” style of diplomacy consists of an assertiveness by Chinese government officials that embraces confrontation, denounces criticism, and emphasizes perceived hypocrisy. In the body of foreign policy speeches compiled by CSIS, one of the most common phrases identified is the term “true multilateralism” (真正的多边主义). The phrase was used frequently — appearing 52 times in the 80 speeches analyzed — and also appeared in an extraordinarily diverse range of contexts. In 2022 alone, this included high-level Chinese government remarks to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the G20, the Munich Security Conference, and the UN Climate Change Conference. Despite serving as a cornerstone of Chinese public messaging about China’s views on the nature of the international system, the phrase is rarely contextualized or further defined. Instead, it has become a shorthand in Chinese public remarks and writings to criticize U.S. initiatives that China classifies as exclusionary and pursued to sustain Washington’s interests. The use of oblique and euphemistic terminology in high-profile multilateral settings is not uncommon in the speeches analyzed by CSIS. Often wrapped in messages about China’s positivist and inclusive vision of global leadership are phrases accusing Washington of maintaining a “Cold War mentality” or pursuing a “new Cold War.” These accusations are particularly common in the area of technology policy, where Xi Jinping and others have alleged that the United States is pursuing “parallel systems” or building “exclusive yards with high walls” (小院高墙).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also applies its wolf warrior approach to shape international narratives on various items that Beijing classifies as “domestic affairs,” including the matters of Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, maritime issues, and other human rights topics. These efforts portray international condemnation of China’s human rights record as hypocritical and driven by actors with “ulterior motives” while putting forth alternative perspectives on issues such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong. Chinese leaders repeatedly argue that “Xinjiang’s door is open, and we welcome people from all over the world who harbor no bias to come to Xinjiang for visits and exchanges,” and that “Hong Kong residents enjoy far more rights and freedoms according to law than under British colonial rule.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amplification of messages issued by China’s senior leaders serves as a crucial step in the country’s broader approach to propaganda. The key themes that party leadership repeatedly emphasize in their remarks are embraced and repackaged by a wide range of official and quasi-official state and party actors and media outlets, often in increasingly negative and aggressive forms. This is perhaps most evident in the ways that China’s diplomats exploit social media and other platforms to seed confrontational rhetoric about the United States and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent practitioners of this type of rhetorical escalation is Zhao Lijian, a former deputy director general and official spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)’ Information Department. Zhao maintains an active presence on Twitter, with nearly two million followers, where he frequently uses his account to amplify anti-Western rhetoric and to propagate various conspiracy theories. For example, in tweets since April 2022, he has suggested that Covid-19 originated in a U.S. biological laboratory, that a biological accident caused the 2022 monkey pox outbreak in the United States, and that the United States was developing biological weapons at laboratories in Ukraine. Zhao often uses Twitter as an English-language venue to question the legitimacy of U.S. democracy and to challenge the authority of the United States to serve as — in his words — a “self-claimed ‘human rights lecturer.’” Zhao contrasts confrontational posts about topics such as school shootings in the United States, the murder of George Floyd, U.S. wars in the developing world, and U.S. “democrazy” with highly positive tweets about China’s relationship with the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhao’s two most viral tweets of 2022 were posts of memes depicting the destruction associated with various post-World War II U.S. military operations. In 2021, Xinhua — the official state news agency of the CCP — released a short video titled “Ameri-cracy.” The video purports to be a children’s song, but it levels a barrage of accusations against the United States, claiming that the United States seeks to subjugate the world with its own version of destructive democracy. Set to the tune of “the Wellerman,” a New Zealand sea ballad that gained notoriety on TikTok last year, the song alleges bad behavior by the United States, from military adventurism to election fraud, with lines such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inside of the country, money talks. All policies submit to the corp[oration.] Disinformation, Gerrymandering skew election results. Trillions of dollars burned on wars yet lack money for the sick and poor; Play human rights cop across the world yet backyard you ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the video, the main singer is surrounded by four animals, which represent nations that the United States has imposed so-called “Ameri-cracy” on: Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, and the nations that saw “chaos” during the Arab Spring protests. The host interviews each of the animals at the beginning of the video about how the United States imposed this false system of democracy, thereby harming each nation. The main message is that everyone should be able to choose their own system of governance, as illustrated by the refrain: “Democracy of our own, reflects our culture, will and soul. If your system can cure all, why did it cause so many woes?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another short video geared toward a younger audience also highlights Chinese propaganda. “Once upon a virus,” released by Xinhua, features a Lego terracotta warrior warning the United States early and often about the seriousness of the pandemic. A Lego Statue of Liberty replies with nonsensical statements and denial, then blames China, in a clear satire on the Trump administration’s response to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, Beijing’s wolf warrior diplomacy is designed to characterize China’s competitors as rank hypocrites in their approach to human rights and support for the developing world. The intensely negative messaging creates more space for efforts to tell China’s story and promote Beijing’s claim to building an alternative model for global governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although public diplomacy is the most overt manifestation of Chinese propaganda, it is also enabled by semi-transparent elements. Chinese public diplomacy frequently relies on amplifying articles in Chinese state media to lend further legitimacy to its claims. During the last 100 days of 2022, nearly 20 percent of all of Zhao’s tweets were links to articles written by a single commentator on international affairs. This “commentator” reliably posts opinion articles on Chinese state media to comment on U.S. domestic issues, including alleged partisanship in the U.S. Supreme Court, the “Twitter Files,” and the origins of Covid-19. The author’s name is “Xin Ping.” Although he has a Gmail address, there is little evidence beyond the dozens of English-language articles and the favor of Zhao Lijian to suggest Xin Ping is a real person rather than a pen name used for generating and amplifying Chinese state messaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolf warrior diplomats circulate these types of articles widely online to help create the image of robust support. Upon inspection, one may fail to notice the source of the information and risk lending credence to Chinese propaganda. For example, at a committee hearing on February 28, 2023, U.S. representative Matt Gaetz cited unsubstantiated information from a &lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt; article without apparent knowledge of the source’s ties to the CCP. In 2020, the &lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt; was designated as a “foreign mission” by the U.S. State Department for its adherence to promoting the interests of the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in tandem, China’s positivist and wolf warrior public diplomacy approaches are essential in setting the direction of the CCP’s propaganda strategy. The themes and messages crafted by political leadership in the CCP inform activities explored in the rest of this chapter. In addition, China’s propaganda efforts begin to shift from routine statecraft to public manipulation in the creation and control of media abroad. China employs three strategies to spread propaganda and control messaging about issues related to China in information environments overseas. First, China creates new media platforms in overseas markets, exercising control over the content, with varying levels of transparency. Second, it uses existing media platforms in foreign countries to promote its messaging through paid advertisements and content that often provide limited transparency to their Chinese origin. Third, China leverages access to its domestic market to aggressively censor foreign media and information ecosystems. Combined, these three strategies enable China to further spread propaganda and often hide its manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-media-platforms&quot;&gt;NEW MEDIA PLATFORMS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s growing influence in global information environments is partly a result of its expanded creation of Chinese-owned media platforms. This section explores China’s gains in the areas of television and social media. In recent years, the most significant example of China’s expanding media prowess has been the creation and proliferation of the social media platform TikTok. The idea for TikTok began as a domestic Chinese video sharing app. ByteDance, its parent company, then reinvented the app for a worldwide audience. The United States is its largest market, including a multiyear marketing deal with the National Football League. TikTok’s business model is to provide the users with a never-ending stream of short, fun videos. The user does not curate their own feed with likes or other active feedback. Rather the app monitors whether a user lingers on a video or passes it by and collects detailed information on the user’s behavior surrounding a video. Its proprietary algorithm then feeds that user more content designed to maximize engagement with the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through these feedback loops and logging user activity, TikTok gathers significant amounts of information about a huge number of users, allowing anyone with access to the data to construct not only broad facts about the user base but also highly detailed profiles about specific users. TikTok collects so much data on users that U.S. officials have gone so far as to characterize it as a foreign surveillance tool. As a result of its popularity and data collection capabilities, TikTok poses at least two threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the user data collected poses cybersecurity risks. China could use the app to seize the data or access the software of millions of users, including gaining access to the camera and microphone on users’ mobile devices. Second, TikTok provides Beijing an opportunity to control information and promote propaganda to overseas audiences, with a keen understanding of how users respond to content and transparency. Documents revealed by the Guardian in 2019 showed how ByteDance sought to advance Chinese foreign policy with TikTok, in part by requiring TikTok employees to remove content about the Tiananmen Square massacre and Falun Gong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Searches about the Hong Kong protests have returned few results. In 2019, searches for specific politically sensitive terms, such as the hashtag “#antielab,” indicated suppression of discussions on TikTok. The hashtag “#antielab” had more than 34,000 posts on Instagram but only about 11 posts on TikTok. The hashtags “#HongKongProtests” and “#HongKongProtestors,” which served to rally support for the protests on Twitter, turned up either a single video or an error message on TikTok. Searching with Chinese characters returned similar results. Such results have led to concerns that TikTok can filter out news unfriendly to China and shape Americans’ views of the truth. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director Christopher Wray remarked that he was “extremely concerned” about TikTok and about China using the app to both steal user data and shape public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TikTok’s response to these criticisms is two-fold. First, TikTok claims that many of these policies have been rescinded since 2019. Second, TikTok reports that it is moving U.S. user data onshore with the help of Oracle’s cloud and that it has not and will not provide that data to China. TikTok announced Project Texas in 2021, which would wall off “protected” data for U.S. users, including phone numbers and birthdays. In June 2022, TikTok claimed it was migrating all U.S. user traffic to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, with data centers in the United States and Singapore as backups. These moves were conducted with an eye toward successfully making it through examination by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media is not the only medium where China has made a push to increase its influence through the creation of new information streams. China also uses its global television presence to broadcast a positive image of China into areas that could not otherwise afford digital television and inject a pro-Beijing viewpoint into media in the developed world. The top two global Chinese TV outlets are China Global Television Network (CGTN) and state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV). These state media outlets reach hundreds of millions of television viewers, radio listeners, and social media users abroad, and Freedom House reports that in many cases the outlets provide little to no transparency on who publishes the content. CGTN broadcasts in five languages and has hundreds of journalists stationed overseas. As one assessment concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;SinoVision, a Chinese-language TV broadcaster, and Qiaobao, one of the largest Chinese-language newspapers in the U.S., are subsidiaries of the Asian Culture and Media Group, an arm of the Chinese government. Staff at both places cut their teeth at the state-owned China News Service and are often dispatched to the U.S. for propaganda purposes. Once there, most of their stories on China, Sino-American relations, Taiwan, Hong Kong and related subjects are reproduced from state-owned media such as Xinhua and the People’s Daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can trace narratives through these news outlets, as vetted talking points get repeated. Chinese television outlets have a presence around the world, as solo entities and in joint partnerships. In Africa, Zimbabwe’s state-run television and CCTV signed an agreement in 2011 to share news programing. In Kenya, a popular television service includes Chinese state television in its most affordable package but omits other international news outlets. In a small town in southern Kenya, a new recipient of cheap Chinese digital TV service said, “I didn’t know about China before. . . . I can say it’s good. They have changed this country in a big way, very fast.” Guo Ziqi, the vice chairman of Chinese media company StarTimes, remarked that “Our aim is to enable every African household to afford digital TV, watch good digital TV and enjoy the digital life.” But StarTimes is also heavily subsidized by the Chinese government and has a mandate to portray a rosy picture of China to Africans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Asia, the Thai News Network signed a deal with Xinhua in 2014 to broadcast the &lt;em&gt;China Report&lt;/em&gt; program daily. The Pakistan Television Corporation partnered with ZTE in 2017 to expand digital TV service to rural areas. ZTE issued a statement saying that the agreement “will cover collaboration across R&amp;amp;D of digital terrestrial television technologies, staff training, and content.” Pakistan adopted the Chinese standard for digital television broadcasts in an event officiated by Xi Jinping and Pakistan’s former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. In Laos, Chinese aid facilitated the transition to digital transmission, with the state broadcaster subsequently signing an agreement with a Chinese media company to create joint content, including news programs. In Cambodia, a joint venture has been transmitting Chinese news on local Cambodian stations since 2017. Timor-Leste also agreed with two Chinese companies to embark on a digital television expansion program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CGTN broadcasts in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, and Russian around the globe via satellite, cable, and over the internet. Other global examples of China’s reach include TV Peru’s Channel 7, which broadcast documentaries produced by CGTN about China as Lima hosted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in 2016. In Cuba, Huawei led the transition from analog to digital television. Portuguese TV launched a prime-time “China Hour” featuring content from Chinese state media, and a German public station aired a current affairs program called &lt;em&gt;Dialogue with China&lt;/em&gt;, coproduced with a controversial CGTN host. In Africa and the Middle East, Chinese state media has also developed unique publications geared toward local populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s control over social media platforms and television networks overseas gives the CCP the opportunity to influence billions of individuals with Chinese propaganda. By exporting information streams that it has the power to control, the CCP can spread a positive image of China and limit or otherwise manipulate negative narratives about China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;existing-media-platforms&quot;&gt;EXISTING MEDIA PLATFORMS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s second strategy to spread information and disinformation overseas is to use existing media platforms to host content that advances its political objectives. China’s print strategy has frequently pursued this approach, which China refers to as “borrowing the boat to reach the sea” (借船出海). The idea is to use existing outlets as a conveyance for Chinese propaganda. As Xi Jinping stated in 2016, “Wherever the readers are, wherever the viewers are, that is where propaganda reports must extend their tentacles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, China Watch has appeared in the folds of the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. The paid advertising supplement, published by &lt;em&gt;China Daily&lt;/em&gt;, has featured stories that depict the CCP’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic in a positive light, claim that the Hong Kong protestors are sponsored by the United States, and protest U.S. trade policy. The inserts generally come with a warning, with the one in the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; clearly stating, “Content in this advertising section was prepared by China Daily, and did not involve the news or opinion staff of The Washington Post.” But criticism of giving the CCP a prominent outlet through which to broadcast its message has led many outlets to drop the insert, passing on millions in ad revenue. Similar inserts have appeared in major newspapers in Spain, the United Kingdom, Australia, Argentina, Peru, Senegal, and India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese outlets also provide free content to partners, in particular Chinese-language papers serving Chinese diaspora communities. The Financial Times reported that there was a sharp uptick in content-sharing agreements in 2016 and 2017, with 200 Chinese-language publications around the world broadcasting content created by party-affiliated outlets. However, content sharing is not exclusively limited to Chinese-language outlets. Chinese state news agencies provide content and photos free of charge to appear under the masthead of overseas publications. Freedom House reports that Xinhua has exchange agreements with local counterparts in Australia, Bangladesh, Belarus, Egypt, India, Italy, Laos, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam. Such content often appears native to the independent publication. At best, the fine print identifies the source. These types of content agreements also extend beyond print publications into television and radio programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, China’s approach of “borrowing the boat to reach the sea” is designed to exploit the popularity of existing platforms and co-opt the trust of consumers. Across all mediums, the content is designed to promote a positive image of China while obfuscating the country’s involvement. By appearing in native outlets or as native content, Chinese propaganda is likely to deceive many consumers, who may fail to realize the information they are consuming is possibly biased or misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-censorship-overseas&quot;&gt;CHINESE CENSORSHIP OVERSEAS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing seeks to tightly control the image of China seen by its domestic audience and also seen by those abroad. To do so, the CCP wields a tight grip over the Chinese market to influence information environments globally. This section uses two case studies, the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Hollywood, to examine how the CCP leverages access to China’s massive consumer base to influence foreign media to promote CCP narratives and self-censor to align with Chinese propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2019, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey posted a tweet that said: “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China was outraged. In the following days, nearly 170,000 tweets flooded out of China back at Morey, an effort the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; said “appears to be a coordinated harassment campaign.” Pro-Chinese government accounts mentioned Morey more than 16,000 times. Those accounts most likely were humans at keyboards — “a troll mob,” according to Ben Nimmo, the head of investigations at Graphika Inc. Approximately 4,700 of those replies included “NMSL,” a Chinese acronym meaning “your mother is dead.” This high volume of activity is all the more anomalous given that Twitter is banned in China. Morey quickly deleted his tweet and posted an apology, but the situation continued to escalate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, the Rockets were the second-most popular team in China, but Chinese state priorities trumped fan support. Chinese state institutions cut ties with the Rockets, as did China’s leading sportswear brand and the club’s main sponsor in China, a bank. The Rockets’ owner, who bought the team in part because of its market share in China, immediately distanced himself from Morey’s tweet. Then Chinese state media and Tencent, both of which held exclusive rights to broadcast NBA games in China, stopped airing NBA games. Tencent resumed airing NBA games 11 days after the tweet — with the exception of games featuring the Rockets. When Morey moved to manage the Philadelphia 76ers in October 2020, that team was removed from Tencent’s broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SOURCE: SCREENSHOT OF&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20191008092754/https://twitter.com/dmorey/status/1181000809363857409&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SINCE DELETED TWEET BY DARYL MOREY, TWITTER POST, OCTOBER 6, 2019, 5:18 P.M.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morey was not the only one to apologize. Numerous NBA officials and players scrambled to either distance themselves from Morey or describe the NBA as apolitical. Rockets star James Harden apologized and said, “We love China.” The NBA issued a statement in English that said: “We recognize that the views expressed by the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. While Daryl has made it clear that this tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals’ educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them.” However, a version translated to Mandarin and published on Weibo said that the league was “extremely disappointed” by the “inappropriate” tweet, which “severely hurt the feelings of Chinese fans.” The NBA spokesman said the English version was the “official” statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some U.S. political leaders on both sides of the aisle accused the NBA of bowing to China’s economic power and excusing Beijing’s human rights violations. The relationship thawed temporarily in October 2020 when Chinese media broadcast the NBA Finals. The broadcast was accompanied by an announcement that the NBA had expressed goodwill and had “made active efforts to support the Chinese people in their fight against COVID-19.” CCTV then renewed the blackout until March 2022, after the Beijing Olympics, when games unceremoniously began reappearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the three-year gap in coverage, NBA team owners and players largely stayed silent while the league worked behind the scenes to repair the relationship. An ESPN in-depth investigation found that while the NBA’s presence in China was worth an estimated $5 billion that was shared equally among the teams — including $1.5 billion for Tencent streaming — many team owners also had “significant personal stakes” in China through their business interests. As the investigation concluded: “ESPN examined the investments of 40 principal owners and found that they collectively have more than $10 billion tied up in China — including one owner whose company has a joint venture with an entity that has been sanctioned by the U.S. government.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same owner, Micky Arison of the Miami Heat, was a prominent advocate for human rights in the United States. In 2020, Arison described the Miami Heat’s commitment to social justice as “never-ending,” in the context of racial justice. ESPN cited Robert Kuhn, an adviser to multinational corporations operating in China and to Chinese political leaders, explaining this conundrum: “It’s a tension between those two poles . . . to see companies promoting social justice in the U.S. but staying silent on what would be perceived to be far worse issues in China. This is going to be an issue for the rest of our working lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long after the Daryl Morey incident, Enes Kanter Freedom, who played for the Boston Celtics, publicly criticized human rights abuses in China. Kanter Freedom called on his teammates and others in the NBA to speak out against Chinese human rights abuses, and he decorated his game sneakers with phrases about Uyghurs, forced labor, and related issues. Tencent dropped Celtics games in response. The NBA responded that Freedom was allowed to wear shoes advocating his causes and supported his right to speak out. However, Freedom told CNN in 2021 that he was heavily criticized for speaking out against China. “I’ve been talking about all the human rights violations and injustices happening in Turkey for 10 years, and I did not get one phone call,” he said. “I talk about China one day, and I was getting a phone call once every two hours.” Freedom was traded in February 2022 to the Houston Rockets, who waived his contract less than a week later. A Chinese journalist from China Daily, an English-language newspaper owned by the CCP, trolled Freedom. “Now you don’t play basketball,” the journalist said. “John Bolton can play you more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HOLLYWOOD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, China’s soft power has been most significant in its relationship with Hollywood. The size of the Chinese movie market can substantially influence the profitability of a film, Chinese censors let a limited number of films into its market each year, and those censors have a long and inconsistently implemented set of criteria for what makes a good movie. As a result, Hollywood producers will self-censor by removing any elements that could be perceived as critical of China. Producers sometimes also add elements that appeal to Chinese audiences and bureaucrats. As a report by PEN America, a nonprofit organization that supports artistic freedom and human rights, summarized, “The result is a system in which Beijing bureaucrats can demand changes to Hollywood movies — or expect Hollywood insiders to anticipate and make these changes, unprompted — without any significant hue or cry over such censorship.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese influence on Hollywood has escalated in the last decade, but the trendline began in the mid-1990s after Mao’s death. Beijing agreed to allow 10 imported movies a year, starting with The Fugitive. But it was Titanic’s box office numbers in China — with $44 million in revenue — that made Hollywood take notice of the potential scale of the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two movies about Tibet in 1997 demonstrated that Beijing had both the will and the muscle to influence the movie market. &lt;em&gt;Kundun&lt;/em&gt;, produced by Disney, and &lt;em&gt;Seven Years in Tibet&lt;/em&gt;, produced by Sony, both featured the Dalai Lama and his Tibetan homeland. Neither film ever appeared on Chinese screens, and Beijing banned both companies entirely from China. While discussing his 2022 book &lt;em&gt;Red Carpet: Hollywood, China and the Global Battle for Cultural Supremacy&lt;/em&gt; with NPR, Erich Schwartzel described the following scene:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The executives at Disney . . . knew if they canceled the production [of &lt;em&gt;Kundun&lt;/em&gt;] as the Chinese authorities had requested, they would have been tarred in the Hollywood community for squelching free expression, for muzzling Martin Scorsese. They knew that they would have a lot of domestic blowback if they did that, too. So they had to really thread the needle. And what they ultimately decided to do was release Kundun into theaters, but bury it. And so Kundun was released on Christmas Day on four screens, and then when it didn’t perform well, the Disney executives used that lousy performance to justify not expanding it much further. And actually, despite all their efforts, they still were banned in China, and the then CEO Michael Eisner had to fly over to Beijing a year later and meet with officials and apologize. There’s a fascinating transcript that exists of his meeting with a Chinese official in which he says, “The bad news is that the movie was released. The good news is that nobody saw it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hollywood’s incentive to play to China’s interests grew considerably in 2012 after then vice president Biden and his counterpart, then vice president Xi Jinping, negotiated a higher quota of 34 movies per year, along with a hike in the percentage of ticket sales that go to back to the studios. By 2018, China surpassed the United States in quarterly box office revenue. In 2020, China officially surpassed the United States as the world’s biggest box office. China had more than 80,000 screens, compared to approximately 39,000 in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any film that hopes to capture some of this vast revenue must first get past Chinese censors in the Central Propaganda Department, the Ministry of State Security, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Public Security, the State Bureau of Religious Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Justice, the MFA, and numerous other bureaucratic entities. In 2016, Beijing passed the Film Industry Promotion Law, including the following list of reasons content could be banned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Violations of the basic principles of the constitution, incitement of resistance to or undermining of implementation of the constitution, laws, or administrative regulations;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Endangerment of the national unity, sovereignty or territorial integrity; leaking state secrets; endangering national security; harming national dignity, honor or interests; advocating terrorism or extremism;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Belittling exceptional ethnic cultural traditions, incitement of ethnic hatred or ethnic discrimination, violations of ethnic customs, distortion of ethnic history or ethnic historical figures, injuring ethnic sentiments or undermining ethnic unity;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Inciting the undermining of national religious policy, advocating cults or superstitions;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Endangerment of social morality, disturbing social order, undermining social stability; promoting pornography, gambling, drug use, violence, or terror; instigation of crimes or imparting criminal methods;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Violations of the lawful rights and interests of minors or harming the physical and psychological health of minors;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Insults or defamation of others, or spreading others’ private information and infringement of others’ lawful rights and interests;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other content prohibited by laws or administrative regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 36 of the same law goes further, saying that the Chinese state supports films that “transmit the glorious Chinese culture or promote core socialist values.” To reach these vague and arbitrary standards, studios have cast mainland Chinese actors, shot parts of films in China, and even invited Chinese regulators to visit their sets. In the 2014 film &lt;em&gt;Transformers: Age of Extinction&lt;/em&gt;, Mark Wahlberg’s character withdraws money from a China Construction Bank ATM while in Texas. In another scene from the same film, a character buys Chinese protein powder at a Chicago convenience store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One studio was shocked by the vague objection that got its film, &lt;em&gt;In Good Company&lt;/em&gt;, banned. In the film, a young businessman gets a job and displaces his older boss. Chinese censors said that they would not allow a movie centered on a younger generation challenging the system. The Marvel Studios film &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; was designed with China in mind, but China banned the film — almost certainly for political reasons. Simu Liu, the lead actor in the movie, left China in the mid-1990s and criticized his former country as a third world country whose people “were dying of starvation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such themes getting films banned, film studios do not dare take on third rail topics, such as the Uyghur oppression, Taiwanese independence, or Hong Kong. As one Hollywood producer acknowledged: “All of us are fearful of being named in an article even generally discussing China in Hollywood.” Another Hollywood producer put it bluntly: “It’s hard for people to speak on the record if they want to keep their jobs.” In an additional example of Chinese influence, Chloe Zhao was lauded by Beijing as an acclaimed director until an old interview surfaced where she said that in China “there are lies everywhere.” Beijing responded by deleting social media celebrations of her Oscar win, canceling the release of her celebrated film &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt;, and banning the movie &lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;, which she directed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also begun to produce higher-quality films, squeezing the space available for Hollywood blockbusters. In 2020, the top 25 highest-grossing movies of all time in the box office in China included only seven Hollywood films. The rest were produced in China or Hong Kong. One example of a made-in-China blockbuster was &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior 2&lt;/em&gt;. As one U.S. academic wrote, the movie “hammers away at a single message: China is bringing security, prosperity, and modern health care to Africa, while the United States is bringing only misery.” The movie made $802 million, making it one of the highest-grossing films in Chinese history. Similarly, the movies &lt;em&gt;Operation Mekong&lt;/em&gt; (2016) and &lt;em&gt;Operation Red Sea&lt;/em&gt; (2018) describe Chinese soldiers as virtuous and brave and are explicitly anti-American. In 2021, China released &lt;em&gt;The Battle at Lake Changjin&lt;/em&gt;, a fictitious account of the 1950 Battle of the Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War. The movie, which centers around a conventional battle between U.S. and Chinese forces, garnered nearly $1 billion at the worldwide box office, making it the highest-grossing Chinese film of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In yet another example of Chinese influence in Hollywood, the U.S. actor John Cena, one of the stars of F9 (from the “Fast and Furious” series), referred to Taiwan as a country — and then went to great lengths to apologize. The producers had worked hard to position the movie for success in China. It was coproduced with the state-owned China Film Group Corp., and it premiered in China more than a month before it appeared in the United States, at a time suitable for the Chinese centenary celebrations. But Cena, who was taking Mandarin lessons, told a Taiwanese broadcaster in Mandarin that “Taiwan is the first country that can watch F9.” Cena then issued a rambling apology in Mandarin on Weibo: “I made a mistake, I must say right now. It’s so, so, so, so, so, so important. I love and respect Chinese people . . . I’m very sorry for my mistakes. Sorry. Sorry. I’m really sorry. You have to understand that I love and respect China and Chinese people.” F9 then grossed $136 million in its first weekend in China, more than double its North American box office take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executives in the NBA, Hollywood, and other businesses understand that China is watching them, including what their executives say in public. For anyone hoping to tap into China’s enormous consumer market, the deal is clear: align with the approved narratives of the CCP or jeopardize profits. In this way, the fear of losing access to the Chinese market advances the CCP’s propaganda efforts in foreign information environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lawful-political-influence-and-information-activities&quot;&gt;LAWFUL POLITICAL INFLUENCE AND INFORMATION ACTIVITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to targeting the media environments of foreign countries, China attempts to spread propaganda by directly influencing political leaders and institutions. China — like other nation-states — enlists overseas consultants, lobbyists, and public relations experts to conduct a wide range of information activities on its behalf. In many countries, political campaign financing and foreign agent registration laws are designed to prevent interference in domestic policy deliberations and elections. Such regulations include the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) and the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) in the United States, the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme (FITS) and the Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform Act in Australia, and the proposed Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS) in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although governed by certain country-specific prohibitions and reporting requirements, mechanisms such as FARA, LDA, and FITS are primarily designed as disclosure statutes in that they are intended to ensure that government officials and the public are aware of the true source or sponsor of certain sources of information. As such, many of the public relations, lobbying, and other political activities of registered “agents of foreign principals” are not forms of covert influence, as the connection between the domestic “agent” and the “foreign principal” is a matter of public record. Nevertheless, China and other countries recognize that adept navigation of these disclosure requirements provides an important vehicle for shaping policy, opinions, and broader discourse about issues of strategic concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While transparency regulations provide tools for governments and their citizens to identify direct connections between certain activities and their foreign sponsors, these regulations are often not set up to disclose incidents in which foreign agent activities have indirect or second-order impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the types of activities that Chinese actors undertake under transparency statutes, the CSIS research team focused on documents that are made available to the public under the United States’ FARA and LDA statutes as well as documentation made available to the public pursuant to Australia’s FITS program. Overall, these transparency statutes reveal the range of activities that are conducted by registered agents in the United States and Australia, which includes work for four general categories of foreign principals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese government establishments, including embassies and local consulates (which are required to be disclosed under FARA);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Organizations widely attributed to the CCP’s united front efforts, including the China-United States Exchange Foundation and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (which are typically disclosed under FARA);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category 3:&lt;/strong&gt; State-owned or state-affiliated enterprises, such as Huawei, Hikvision, DJI, and Bytedance (which could be disclosed under FARA or the LDA, depending on the type of activity); and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category 4:&lt;/strong&gt; State-owned media franchises, such as &lt;em&gt;China Daily&lt;/em&gt; and CGTN (which are typically disclosed under FARA).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, for example, 15 Chinese “foreign principals” were actively registered under FARA, with a total of 22 U.S.-based “foreign agents” representing these entities. Since 2017, a total of 38 Chinese foreign principals have registered under FARA, several of them repeatedly as they commissioned new work on China’s behalf. Since 2010, a total of 75 FARA registrations have been associated with China, ranking Beijing seventh among all foreign powers, ahead of the eighth-place United Arab Emirates (64 registrations) and behind South Korea and Turkey (tied at 78 registrations). U.S. entities engaged in certain lobbying activities are exempt from FARA if they opt to register under the LDA, as long as they are not lobbying on behalf of a foreign government or a foreign political party. Much of the lobbying activity that is conducted on behalf of a Chinese state-owned and state-affiliated enterprise is disclosed through the U.S. Congress’s LDA reporting system rather than through FARA. Since 2005, a total of 116 Chinese-owned entities have registered lobbying activities under the LDA, which includes the U.S.-based lobbying activities of many high-profile Chinese technology companies, such as Hikvision, Lexmark, Lenovo, DJI, Bytedance, and Huawei.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this section focuses on the activities undertaken on behalf of entities registered under FARA that fall under the first two categories referenced above. It is within the activities of these two types of foreign principals where an “influence the influencer” approach to Chinese propaganda is most pronounced, as will be described in specific examples below. Moreover, these activities are often different from those conducted on behalf of the entities included in the third and fourth categories. The connections between the foreign principal and the foreign agent are often much clearer, as the activities of the foreign agent are often conducted clearly under the banner of the foreign principal. Examples include the rebroadcast and distribution of Chinese state media as well as instances in which U.S. public relations firms may assist with brand awareness and marketing, such as in the case of a U.S. firm that managed Huawei’s U.S.-based social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following example highlights how the Chinese government and organizations associated with the CCP’s broader united front work navigate FARA requirements to conduct information operations and perception management activities that can be difficult to measure and complicated to attribute to China. In December 2021, a U.S.-based public relations firm registered as a foreign agent after signing a $300,000 contract with the Consulate General of the People’s Republic of China in New York to develop a social media campaign to promote the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. As stipulated in the contract, the Chinese government had the authority to approve all content generated in support of the campaign and directed the specific themes that the campaign should emphasize, including “Beijing’s history, cultural relics, modern life of people, new trends, etc.” and “any good things in China-US relations.” The U.S.-based public relations firm subsequently worked through an intermediary firm to hire 11 social media influencers to conduct the consulate’s social media campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As disclosed at the conclusion of the contract, a total of 26 social media posts were paid for by the Chinese government that reached 4 million interactions across Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. None of these social media posts needed to disclose the actual sponsor of the content, which was the Chinese government. Exacerbating the challenge surrounding this type of influence, the media firm working as China’s foreign agent operated according to its obligations under FARA. It disclosed its activities to U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), including the various individuals contacted pursuant to the work on behalf of the Chinese consulate. Nevertheless, the social media influencers hired as part of these efforts were not subject to the same disclosure requirements. Their social media posts needed no disclaimer that their posts had ultimately been paid for by China. The millions of social media users who encountered the 26 sponsored posts could not have known that the posts were connected to — and paid for by — the Chinese government until the details of the campaign were filed with the DOJ in April 2022. This date came two months after the Olympics concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-3&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explored several ways that China is extending the reach of its information and disinformation into foreign media and political environments, but it is by no means an exhaustive analysis. Though the tool kit for spreading information and disinformation is constantly evolving, China’s goal remains the same: to increase Chinese power and influence and decrease U.S. power and influence. The CCP advances its goals through propaganda by promoting a positive view of China and suppressing and delegitimizing criticism. Without access to unbiased information, international audiences may fail to recognize and hold Beijing accountable for its part in controversial issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the effects of information and disinformation alone are difficult to measure, one can look for indicators of China’s success. The CCP has successfully established dominance over Chinese-language media in the diaspora; created self-censorship in some Western industries, including Hollywood; and influenced content on some of the largest international social media platforms. However, there are limits to Beijing’s propaganda efforts. China has also orchestrated an aggressive intimidation and pressure campaign against multinational companies — including conducting police raids of U.S. companies Bain &amp;amp; Company and the Mintz Group — in China. As U.S. Congressman Mike Gallagher remarked in April 2023, “The CCP’s updated counter-espionage law sends a loud, clear signal to the world: there is no such thing as a private company in China. . . . Our business leaders need to take off their golden blindfolds and recognize that the recent police raids of American companies Bain and Mintz are not one-offs but part of a long, proud tradition of exploitation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media outlets and digital platforms still publish content that is critical of China. In addition, views of China in the United States have become increasingly negative over the past several years, according to public opinion polls. Unfavorable views of China are also high in numerous Indo-Pacific countries (such as South Korea, Japan, Australia, and India) and European countries (such as Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Germany). Nevertheless, China’s propaganda efforts should not be underestimated as the country continues to grow its sprawling tool kit to control information internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-united-front&quot;&gt;THE UNITED FRONT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone must remember: no matter where you are, you are sons and daughters of China.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-xi-jinping-3&quot;&gt;– Xi Jinping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This chapter focuses on Chinese Communist Party (CCP) efforts to disrupt perceived security and reputational harm through “united front” work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Used in this context, united front work involves activity to protect and bolster the image of China and the CCP by monitoring and countering criticism overseas. United front work includes widespread intimidation and harassment of Chinese students, diaspora communities, and critics of Chinese domestic and foreign policy on a global scale. It also includes activities conducted in support of China’s soft-power agenda, which seeks to influence individuals who are potentially well positioned to amplify China’s preferred messaging on political, economic, and academic issues. As Stanford University professor Larry Diamond summarized, “China is deploying classic Communist Party ‘united front’ tactics to penetrate and coopt the soft tissues of democracy — universities, think tanks, research centers, new media, the arts, corporations, community organizations, political parties, and local governments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United front work has evolved under Xi Jinping as one of the cornerstones of the CCP’s efforts to conduct a wide range of political influence and information operations globally. The CCP’s main organization for conducting united front work is the United Front Work Department (UFWD). However, there are also dozens of organizations with both direct and indirect links to the UFWD which are responsible for promoting CCP discipline on a global scale, focusing primarily on Chinese students and diaspora communities, and building bonds with influential global political, business, and academic leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter illustrates how united front work materializes across core elements of China’s political warfare strategy. It focuses on how the united front intersects with global institutions of higher learning, how the united front and its affiliates engage in overseas political influence and interference, and how the united front is deployed to extend the reach of the CCP and China into worldwide Chinese diaspora communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this chapter argues, one of the most significant impacts of China’s overseas united front work is undermining the sovereignty of the countries where these activities take place. In democracies, united front activities often undermine the freedoms that Chinese students and diaspora communities are entitled to while residing in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and many European states. China, often operating under the guise of various united front affiliated organizations, uses multiple tools to harass, intimidate, and punish perceived enemies overseas and their families in China. In other cases, united front activities undermine sovereignty by manifesting in varying levels of covert influence. Beijing — often operating through various united front-affiliated organizations — is adept at complying with foreign influence transparency regimes in ways that often limit the public’s ability to fully understand the scope of Beijing’s activities. This chapter identifies several specific examples where existing U.S. laws governing foreign media, lobbying, and academic activities may not be capable of shedding sufficient light on Beijing’s engagement in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this chapter provides an overview of the history of the united front and its resurgence under the leadership of Xi Jinping. It then analyzes available open-source evidence of overseas united front work in the areas of higher education, politics, and diaspora communities. Next, it closes with a broader analysis of the impact of these activities. As will be evident in all three of the case studies, broader united front work integrates efforts to make friends and punish enemies, with the primary focus — as described by Xi Jinping in early 2023 — to build on the theme of “following the party unswervingly and forging ahead in the new era hand in hand.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-fronts-historic-importance-to-the-ccp&quot;&gt;THE UNITED FRONT’S HISTORIC IMPORTANCE TO THE CCP&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The united front is deeply rooted in the idea of the modern People’s Republic of China (PRC) as a unitary party state, with the CCP overseeing all aspects of social, political, and economic life. The concept of the “united front” (统战), which is rooted in Leninism, has served a central role in the CCP since Mao Zedong described it as one of the party’s “three magic weapons” (三个法宝) — alongside armed struggle and party building — in 1939. Mao was writing of the CCP’s temporary alliances with Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang nationalists in the 1920s and, as he wrote in 1939, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The concept, as he envisioned it, emphasized unifying diverse elements under the central control and direction of the CCP. In the early years of the PRC, this included the establishment of dozens of party-affiliated organizations designed to exert control over the vast majority of Chinese citizens who were not members of the CCP. Although Chinese leaders since Mao have rhetorically highlighted the importance of the united front as a concept, the party’s commitment to such work languished for decades. It was not until the ascendance of Xi Jinping that united front work reemerged as a CCP priority, particularly as a key pillar of China’s efforts to expand its global influence. As this chapter describes, the united front has reemerged under Xi as a key component of Chinese political warfare, with different elements operating under the broader banner of “united front work” overseas to shape perceptions, influence powerful friends, and intimidate and punish the CCP’s enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since taking power, Xi Jinping has reenergized and reformed united front work and made it a critical element of China’s domestic and foreign policies. This focus on united front work as part of his leadership should come as little surprise in light of his own prior writings on the subject. In 1995, while still a CCP official in Fujian province, Xi urged that united front efforts should be expanded and prioritized: “We believe that the work of overseas Chinese affairs in the new era should break through geographical boundaries, jump out of the scope of overseas Chinese affairs departments, and make it a major event of the party and governments at all levels, and a major event of common concern and participation of the whole society.” Once in power, Xi echoed Mao’s vision of united front work, including in a September 2014 speech to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a key united front organ: “The united front is an important magic weapon for the Communist Party of China to win the cause of revolution, construction, and reform, and also to realize the greatness of the Chinese nation. An important magic weapon for revival.” These remarks were quickly followed by a reorganization of the party’s approach to united front work, which included the April 2015 release of new “Regulations on the Work of the United Front of the Communist Party of China,” hailed by the CCP as “the first intra-party regulation of our party on the work of the united front.” Ushering in this new era for the united front, in May 2015, Xi presided over the first United Front Work Conference in nine years. Notably, this convening represented the first time in the party’s history that the conference was held at the central, rather than national, level, a significant elevation in status within CCP governance. At this first ever “Central United Front Work Conference,” Xi made the overarching intent abundantly clear: “The policies implemented and the measures taken must be conducive to maintaining and consolidating the party’s leadership and ruling position.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the enduring importance and continued evolution of united front work under Xi’s leadership, the united front regulations were revised again in late 2020. Additionally, in a series of reorganizations that occurred in 2018 and 2019, Xi transferred several critical overseas responsibilities from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and merged the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office into the CCP’s primary united front organ — the UFWD. These moves consolidated many of the responsibilities for monitoring, influencing, and coopting diaspora communities into the UFWD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of the CCP’s united front work, both domestically and abroad, is massive, and a full accounting of the various entities through which the party and the Chinese government advance efforts through united front work would not be practical to include in this chapter. Moreover, the full scope of what formally distinguishes united front work from other efforts to promote the interests of the CCP is often blurry. As such, it is difficult to fully disaggregate China’s approach to united front work from its broader global intelligence and information warfare activities. As reflected in the chapter on Chinese espionage operations (Chapter 3), there is significant overlap between China’s efforts to monitor, co-opt, and intimidate overseas dissident groups and the priorities of united front work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many circumstances, various patterns of China’s overseas activities cannot be attributed to a specific entity. For example, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), Ministry of Public Security (MPS), People’s Liberation Army (PLA), Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and various united front organizations engage in similar patterns of behavior, particularly when antagonizing overseas diaspora groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several scholars have described the UFWD as a form of intelligence service. There are justified reasons for viewing the UFWD and the broader campaign of united front work through this lens. Zhou Enlai — an architect of China’s intelligence and security apparatus — advocated for “nestling intelligence within the United Front” and “using the United Front to push forth intelligence.” As Zhou also reportedly pointed out, “intelligence work should be done by making friends and talking to each other, building bases, establishing relationships, and going deep into society.” These are all core elements of united front work in the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-front-in-academia&quot;&gt;THE UNITED FRONT IN ACADEMIA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, concerns about China’s influence within global higher education have steadily increased. This has included scrutiny of the Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes on campuses worldwide. The Chinese government established the Confucius Institute program in 2004. Hanban, a Chinese government agency chaired by a member of the Politburo and the vice premier of China, oversees the program. Its goals are to promote Chinese language and culture, support local Chinese teaching overseas, and facilitate cultural exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Confucius Institutes have stifled open and free debate. Hanban hired and trained teachers to oversee academic courses within U.S. universities, and research proposals had to be approved by Hanban. Numerous examples of censorship began to emerge by Confucius Institutes across the globe — such as in Sweden, Portugal, Australia, and Canada — stifling discussion in classrooms and at conferences. Hanban instructed teachers in Confucius Institutes to prevent the discussion of issues that were politically taboo in China, such as the status of Taiwan, the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre orchestrated by PLA forces, human rights, China’s pro-democracy movement, and the status of China’s beleaguered Uyghur population. Marshall Sahlins, an anthropology professor at the University of Chicago, argued that “by hosting a Confucius Institute, they [universities] have become engaged in the political and propaganda efforts of a foreign government in a way that contradicts the values of free inquiry and human welfare to which they are otherwise committed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials also expressed alarm that the MSS was using Confucius Institutes to recruit spies and collect intelligence on Chinese individuals in the United States. “The Chinese have multiple goals with Confucius Institutes, including to monitor Chinese communities in the United States and other Western countries,” said the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)’s Mark Kelton. “The Chinese have also been interested in influencing the tone of debate on campuses and traditional espionage — including spotting and recruiting individuals.” James Olson, chief of counterintelligence at the CIA, explained that China’s MSS “has an elaborate spotting program to identify those students who show political or cultural sympathy for China.” By 2009, there were 90 Confucius Institutes housed at U.S. universities — including prestigious institutions such as Columbia, Stanford, and Chicago — and a total of 440 across the globe. But widespread national security and other concerns about Confucius Institutes led to a substantial reduction in the number of these entities operating on campuses in the United States and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other united front activities targeting higher education include pro-China campaigns, particularly through various Chinese cultural and academic exchange initiatives. These united front activities integrate tools to intimidate and punish enemies, as Beijing deploys an increasingly strident and aggressive approach to shaping and controlling narratives around issues the CCP views as sensitive. These activities manifest in a wide range of global incidents — including in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States — in which Chinese government entities and proxies have engaged in acts of intimidation, harassment, and censorship targeting both Chinese nationals and students and faculty who are critical of Chinese policy on topics such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjian, the South China Sea, and Tibet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key factor in the threat to higher education is the financial dependency that some universities have on various forms of Chinese funding. According to a U.S. Department of Education (DOE) database documenting foreign donations, China is the fifth-largest foreign source of financial contributions to U.S. universities, accounting for more than $2.8 billion in grants and contracts since 1987. As acknowledged by the DOE in 2021, however, these numbers are “systematically underinclusive and inaccurate,” as existing obligations only require donations that exceed $250,000 in a calendar year to be reported. The DOE referred to existing reporting as “unaudited, self-reported data” and suggested that “the public have real reason for concern that foreign money buys influence or control over teaching, research, and possibly even U.S. government policy.” A 2019 U.S. Senate investigation corroborated the DOE’s contention, finding that nearly 70 percent of U.S. schools that received more than $250,000 to establish Confucius Institutes did not report the donations to the DOE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign student tuition is also a critical source of revenue for many U.S. colleges and universities, as these students — including Chinese students — often pay full tuition. In some cases, such arrangements have created significant financial dependencies and, as fewer Chinese students have sought U.S. visas following the Covid-19 pandemic, many universities have experienced declines in Chinese student populations and the corresponding revenue. For several U.S. universities, the decline in Chinese students may have decreased revenue by more than $20 million per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This level of financial dependence creates conditions where Chinese united front and information activities may be more impactful. As discussed throughout this report, Beijing is increasingly weaponizing its global market power to control speech on topics that it deems sensitive. China’s ability to inflict financial harm has contributed to several university decisions to comply with Beijing’s efforts to suppress unwelcome narratives and debate. This includes incidents such as the University of Sydney’s 2013 effort to withdraw support for an on-campus speech by the Dalai Lama, despite having hosted a lecture the year before about the Dalai Lama that was sponsored by the campus’s Confucius Institute. After widespread negative attention, the university reversed course and allowed the speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigations in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States have uncovered several methods that the CCP leverages to shape perceptions and control speech on university campuses. Many of these threats reflect the long arm of the Chinese party-state, which works through multiple united front affiliated organizations — including Chinese Student and Scholars Associations (CSSAs), the Western Returned Scholars Association, and party cells on foreign university campuses — in coordination with components such as the MSS, MPS, and Central Commission for Discipline Inspection to monitor and threaten students suspected of speaking out on sensitive topics. Speaking before the Western Returned Scholars Association in 2013, Xi Jinping admonished: “Everyone must remember: no matter where you are, you are sons and daughters of China.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As documented in a testimony before an Australian parliamentary committee and similar studies in the United States and United Kingdom, this policy stance has resulted in cases where Chinese students are harassed or intimidated by fellow students or reported to the Chinese consulate or embassy. Chinese law enforcement and security agencies assist by intimidating or threatening the China-based families of overseas students. Students have also been jailed after returning to China because of social media posts they made while studying abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts by the state security services and the CCP to exercise control over overseas Chinese students and discussions on the campuses where they study is augmented by various united front entities, such as the CSSAs that operate on hundreds of university campuses worldwide. While CSSAs provide important services to students studying abroad, they have also been directly tied to efforts to amplify Chinese messaging or suppress freedom of expression. In one 2022 example, the CSSA at George Washington University launched a series of protests after posters created by an Australia-based Chinese dissident artist appeared on campus. The posters, which were designed to raise awareness of Chinese human rights abuses in connection to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, were decried by the CSSA as “a naked attack on the Chinese nation” and purportedly reflected “extremely vicious attacks on all international students from China and Asian groups.” The university’s president responded by ordering the posters removed. He later reversed this position after widespread condemnation because of the posters’ origin as a form of political protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSSAs are often mobilized to denounce critics, stage counterprotests, or greet visiting Chinese dignitaries. A Chinese diplomat who defected to Australia in 2005 claimed that CSSAs “are in fact controlled by the Chinese [diplomatic] mission and are an extension of the Chinese communist regime abroad.” This contention is supported by various incidents, including disclosures on various CSSA websites and the acknowledged collaboration in 2017 between the CSSA at the University of California, San Diego and the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles to protest the Dalai Lama speaking at the university’s commencement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the CCP’s efforts to suppress freedom of expression and speech on global university campuses represent the most acute united front threat to higher education, united front work extends onto university campuses in other ways that are more reflective of China’s soft-power strategy. Globally, there are numerous groups — similar to the Confucius Institutes — that focus on promoting friendship and telling China’s story. One notable example of how these programs work can be observed in the activities of an organization associated with the united front known as the China-U.S. Exchange Foundation (CUSEF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUSEF was founded in 2008 by Tung Chee-hwa, a Hong Kong-based billionaire, “to encourage constructive dialogue and diverse exchanges between the people of the U.S. and China.” Tung, a former chief executive of Hong Kong, is a vice chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the CCP body that provides overall strategic guidance to the UFWD. CUSEF sponsors several programs in the United States, some of which are disclosed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). These include work conducted on behalf of CUSEF by a U.S. firm that arranges CUSEF-sponsored travel to China for presidents and students from historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as well as to manage a free Mandarin-language course of study for HBCU students. Other CUSEF activities have included funding various initiatives, research, and events at universities and think tanks. Although some involved in these efforts attest that CUSEF put no specific conditions or limitations on funding, other experts such as Peter Mattis suggest the intent is to pursue “ecological change.” As Mattis noted, “If they cultivate enough people in the right places, they start to change the debate without having to directly inject their own voice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;political-influence-and-interference&quot;&gt;POLITICAL INFLUENCE AND INTERFERENCE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soft-power approach to united front work of groups such as CUSEF is particularly relevant to CCP efforts to influence domestic political discourse in foreign countries. This includes additional work by CUSEF — working through another FARA-registered foreign agent — to arrange travel for former members of U.S. Congress to China “on educational trips to exchange views on U.S.-China relations.” In addition to facilitating travel, this representative works with CUSEF to engage with other influential Americans, such as current and former members of Congress and their staff and conducting “policy and political intelligence gathering and analysis on China issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another Chinese-affiliated entity, the U.S.-China Transpacific Foundation, works through the same U.S.-based representative to arrange travel to China for current congressional staff, paying for such travel pursuant to the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act, which allows U.S. government personnel to accept travel paid for by foreign governments. These exchange visits are often co-sponsored by the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs, which, according to its mission statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . [is] guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy; is committed to “making friends for the country” by taking concerted actions with China’s overall diplomacy, expanding foreign exchanges, telling Chinese stories, promoting interaction between China and the rest of the world, and facilitating the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the development of these exchange programs can be directly correlated to China’s broader united front work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing also pursues broader campaigns of foreign political influence and interference that are closely tied to the united front. In the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and across continental Europe, China conducts a range of political influence activities via several united front-affiliated organizations. In some circumstances, these activities can be interpreted as efforts in long-term seeding and influence. As Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director Christopher Wray argued in 2022: “The Chinese government understands that politicians in smaller roles today may rise to become more influential over time. So they look to cultivate talent early — often state and local officials — to ensure that politicians at all levels of government will be ready to take a call and advocate on behalf of Beijing’s agenda.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s efforts to influence domestic politics emerged as a firestorm after events in 2016 revealed several links between CCP money and Australian politicians. The most prominent case involved billionaire property developer Huang Xiangmo, who moved from China to Australia in 2011. In the weeks leading up to the 2016 federal elections, Xiangmo and Australian senator Sam Dastyari came under scrutiny after Dastyari spoke at a press conference organized by the Australian Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China. The council’s mission is to build relationships and promote messaging in Australia in support of the reunification of China and Taiwan. It is an official branch of the China Council for Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China, which is a prominent component of the united front. In reference to territorial disputes in the South China Sea, Dastyari said at the press conference: “The Chinese integrity of its borders is a matter for China, and the role that Australia should be playing, as a friend, is to know, that with the several thousand years of history, thousands of years of history, where it is and isn’t our place to be involved.” Dastyari’s remarks parroted a common CCP talking point and were in direct contradiction to the position taken by Labor Party shadow minister Stephen Conroy just the day before, who had sharply criticized China’s island building and pledged that a Labor government would support freedom of navigation operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dastyari initially denied making the remarks, but recordings released in 2017 confirmed that he did. Although no laws were broken, the event and Dastyari’s association with Xiangmo sparked political backlash that led to Dastyari apologizing and resigning from his position within the party. A series of ensuing media investigations revealed that Xiangmo had previously paid legal bills for Dastyari and threatened to withhold a $450,000 donation to the Labor Party if it did not soften its stance on China’s activities in the South China Sea. In the end, Dastyari resigned from parliament in December 2017 after it was revealed that he had alerted Xiangmo to the possibility that his phone was being monitored by Australian and U.S. intelligence agencies. Huang Xiangmo’s Australian residency was canceled in 2019 over concerns about his political donations and connections to the united front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the Dastyari affair and other similar controversies, Australia passed a series of campaign finance, counter-interference, and espionage laws. In July 2022, a Chinese man accused of planning foreign interference was committed to stand trial in Victoria’s County Court. Di Sanh Duong was the first person to be charged under Australia’s new foreign interference laws, and his case provides the first test of the scope of the law, which criminalizes the intent to interfere with Australia’s political institutions or support the intelligence activities of a foreign government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar influence campaigns involving the united front have been identified in the United Kingdom. In January 2022, the United Kingdom’s Security Service (MI5) issued a rare interference alert to the UK parliament warning of a Chinese agent seeking to establish links between the CCP and current and aspiring members. Christine Ching Kui Lee was active in UK political circles for more than a decade, and her law firm made several sizeable donations to members of the UK government. Although none of Lee’s activities were explicitly illegal and she had been on MI5’s radar for several years, the formal alert was issued after she deliberately concealed her connection to the UFWD. Following MI5’s warning, Lee reportedly stepped down from leadership positions of her UK businesses. Speaking on the issue during a joint address with FBI director Christopher Wray in July 2022, director general of MI5 Ken McCallum said, “The UK is a free country and people are free to hold whatever opinions they choose. But if their advocacy of CCP positions is a consequence of hidden manipulation, I would prefer for them — and us — to be conscious of that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the preceding U.S., Australian, and UK examples reflect how China successfully navigates the idiosyncrasies of these legal systems to conduct influence activities without breaking laws, the same cannot be said of other incidents — most notably recent reports of Chinese bribery in the Solomon Islands. Recent controversies on the islands involving the country’s current prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, have caused political unrest and drawn concern from the United States and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sogavare has served four terms as prime minister of the Solomon Islands. Two of his previous terms were cut short by no-confidence motions, and his current term began amid no less controversy. In 2019, he ran for parliament and eventually became the prime minister after several days of intense backroom negotiations. Shortly after taking office, Sogavare announced that the Solomon Islands would recognize the Chinese government in Beijing, despite having personally called for the UN General Assembly to recognize Taiwan just two years earlier. This reversal led to accusations that Beijing had influenced Sogavare’s return to office. Several members of parliament claim that they were approached with bribes from Beijing to support the decision to recognize China around the same time. The deputy leader of the opposition, Peter Kenilorea, Jr., claimed he was made an offer of $1 million to “say nice things about China” and that it was “an open secret that money is always involved in these things.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2021, Sogavare survived another vote of no confidence. Ahead of the vote, the prime minister’s office legally distributed $2.49 million from a national fund to 39 of the parliament’s 50 members. The money in the fund was provided by the Chinese government, who agreed to continue the practice originally established by Taiwan. Critics argued Sogavare was engaged in vote buying to remain in office and advance China’s political interests. Four months later, Sogavare announced that the Solomon Islands had signed a security agreement with China, sparking fears that Beijing was moving closer to establishing military basing on the islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-4&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this chapter noted, the activities implemented under the banner of the united front mirror broader patterns of activity that align with China’s approach to political warfare. There is a clear pattern of harassment and intimidation that serves a key role in the activities of the united front. The CCP’s overarching mission is to consolidate direction and control over all elements of Chinese society. Since the party’s founding, the mission of exerting control over individuals and groups that are not directly subordinate to the party has been the primary purpose of united front work. China’s increasingly global ambitions, alongside the onset of the digital age, has dramatically expanded the areas that the party-state views as central to sustaining its unquestioned control over domestic and foreign discourse about China. It is in this area where China’s repressive efforts under the banner of the united front are most corrosive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending the party’s arm beyond China’s borders — to suppress freedom of expression implicitly or explicitly in countries where that freedom is a protected right — is a violation of sovereignty and responsible statecraft. Investigations across academia and civil society suggest that these efforts disproportionately affect diaspora communities, but they also extend beyond direct threats and into forms of self-censorship. In one example, 25 academics in Australia acknowledged that they were hesitant to speak on issues such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong out of fear that they would be recorded, doxxed, or harassed. The stakes for diaspora communities are much higher. This can be observed across multiple lines of effort, including in activities carried out under Operation Fox Hunt (as noted in Chapter 3) and in the intimidation and threats that Chinese citizens and their families in the mainland endure when they are perceived as deviating from the party’s strict control over thought and speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of China’s soft-power efforts under the banner of the united front is also difficult to measure. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that Chinese money and influence can translate into favorable policies, even in Western-style democracies. These soft-power efforts include hundreds, if not thousands, of united front-connected groups that focus on shaping perceptions about China’s views on issues of strategic importance, such as reunification with Taiwan, territorial rights in the South China Sea, democracy, and human rights. Reflecting the integration of multiple tools of national power in support of Beijing’s information warfare strategy, the soft-power elements of united front work augment China’s public diplomacy, economic development, and perception management efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple investigations of political influence and interference in Europe further underscore how various state organs, such as elements of the Ministry of Commerce and MFA, align with non-state actors operating under various united front banners to build networks of influence at the national and subnational levels. This includes synchronizing the domestic political activities of overseas united front organizations (such as the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, the Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China, and the Soong Ching Ling Foundation) with overseas state media and China’s bureaucratic organizations (such as the MFA’s Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the Ministry of Commerce’s China Council for the Promotion of International Trade). Ultimately, these efforts are designed to promote positive perceptions of China’s strategic efforts, focusing on cultivating influential voices and decisionmakers across all elements of society, often integrating economic benefits and other enticements like the bribes used in the case of the Solomon Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irregular-military-actions&quot;&gt;IRREGULAR MILITARY ACTIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Constructing a maritime superpower” is an important component of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and is the essence of Xi Jinping’s maritime strategy, which has been developed on the basis of thinking on the seas by successive generations of collective leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-jia-yu-and-zhang-xiaoyi&quot;&gt;– Jia Yu and Zhang Xiaoyi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equipped with a spiral of sharp, gnawing metal teeth and measuring 140 meters (459 feet) in length and 2,800 tons in deadweight, the Tian Kun Hao is the largest ship of its kind in Asia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As the ship sets to work, it lowers its steel-tooth-lined cutter head into the sea floor — up to 35 meters below the surface — and tears apart the earth, breaking through anything from soft clay to solid rock at a rate of 6,000 cubic meters per hour. The resulting sand is pumped up and out of the water, then sent to be used in a variety of ways, from components of concrete and mortar for buildings to the foundations of artificial island chains. This operation, however, is far from just a technologically advanced construction project; it is also an example of political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter examines Chinese irregular military activities, which are an important part of political warfare. As used here, irregular military actions consist of activities short of conventional warfare that are conducted by forces linked directly or indirectly to the state and that are designed to expand a country’s influence and legitimacy. As highlighted later in this chapter, one example is the use of sand dredgers — rather than destroyers or battleships — to build islands in disputed territory and turn them into military bases. Irregular military activities appeal to China because they enable Beijing to expand its geopolitical power and influence — including territorial claims — in a manner that avoids provoking major pushback from other states or escalation into conventional warfare. This chapter considers actors such as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), PLA Navy (PLAN), the PLA Air Force, the PLA Rocket Forces, and the People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia (PAFMM), as well as private security companies and other non-state actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s irregular military capabilities are closely tied to the nation’s growing emphasis on maritime power and reach, which is deeply rooted in its understanding of both Western and Chinese history. China views itself as one of the first nations to leverage the power and resources of the sea. Chinese historical accounts and state rhetoric typically trace this thread to Guan Zhong, a high-ranking philosopher who lived from approximately 720 to 645 BCE. He advised that the Qi state should pursue a “monopoly on mineral and maritime resources” (唯官山海为可耳), which led to comprehensive economic, political, military, and cultural development. Furthermore, the Chinese government completed a study in 2006, titled The Rise of Great Powers, that assessed the reasons for the assent of nine Western nations to “great power” status. The study’s conclusions linked state power to economic development resulting from trade and facilitated by naval power — highlighting the importance of maritime economic connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Xi Jinping argued to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Politburo in 2013, “Historical experience tells us that orienting to the ocean will lead to prosperity, while abandoning the ocean will lead to decline. A strong country is a strong maritime power, and a weak country is a weak maritime power.” He therefore argued in favor of building China into a maritime superpower, which would be strong and outward looking. It would aim to secure China’s local security and sovereignty claims as well as to expand and protect Chinese economic and geopolitical interests abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, China’s maritime strategy rests on the concepts of “near-seas defense” (近海防御) and “far-seas protection” (远海防卫). Although these ideas were publicized in 2015 as the strategy of the PLAN, they also appeared in earlier Chinese strategic documents and were largely inspired by the ideas of Mao Zedong and Alfred Thayer Mahan. Near-seas defense refers to efforts to secure and defend territorial claims, while far-seas protection encompasses “distant ocean mobile operations and non-warfare military activities” that serve to spread and protect Chinese geopolitical and economic influence globally. Chinese strategists have typically defined the far seas as the waters beyond the First Island Chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dichotomy between near and far seas does not imply full, systematic coordination of strategy, either within each realm or across the two. In fact, the concept of a “unified maritime strategy” (海洋战略) is relatively rare within Chinese strategic analyses, and coordination across maritime operations has only begun to improve in recent years. The juxtaposition between near and far seas in this analysis also is not intended to imply that all irregular military activities must be maritime. Still, it is a useful framing device to understand how Beijing conceptualizes its spheres of power, particularly as the country increasingly turns to irregular activities both to enforce its territorial claims near the mainland and to spread influence and power abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many past analyses of Chinese irregular activities focus on Beijing’s activities in and around the South and East China Seas and territorial disputes with neighboring states, this chapter expands the scope of activities assessed to include military-linked channels through which Beijing advances geopolitical goals further abroad. This includes the role of private security companies in advancing China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), research efforts that feed directly into Chinese strategic goals, and China’s newest international project: the Global Security Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of China’s irregular military activities rely on allegedly routine military activities and commercial entities, enabling Beijing to spread power and influence under a guise of deniability. The majority of these activities, including those that rely on civil-military fusion, are not illegal and can pass as routine economic activity, research, or statecraft. Xi Jinping perceives “civil-military fusion” (軍民融合) as a key component of China’s strategic advancement. In his address to the 19th Party Congress, he pledged to “deepen reform of defense-related science, technology, and industry, achieve greater military-civilian integration, and build integrated national strategies and strategic capabilities.” During his address to the 20th Party Congress, Xi similarly vowed to “better coordinate strategies and plans, align policies and systems, and share resources and production factors between the military and civilian sectors.” Furthermore, the emphasis on companies and other economically driven actors as tools of strategic advancement is also connected to China’s perception of economic development and advancements in technology as the key drivers of interstate competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number and diversity of these efforts are highly concerning and may become more threatening as China increasingly focuses on global ambitions, such as its newly formulated Global Security Initiative. While it is possible to comprehensively examine the state of Chinese activities in, for example, the South China Sea, it becomes increasingly difficult to track and counter the totality of Chinese political warfare efforts on a global scale. Still, the absence of centralized, strategic oversight to coordinate these diverse and deniable activities may limit their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter draws on a variety of primary and secondary sources, including Chinese research publications, government white papers and press releases, and speeches by officials; analysis and data reported by U.S. and partner governments and research institutions; satellite imagery; and a new CSIS-created data set of Chinese private security companies operating abroad, including their locations and primary services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this chapter is divided into three main sections. The first section provides an overview of China’s primary near-seas activities, including the use of sand dredgers; coercion through military exercises, harassment campaigns, and forward deployments; the PAFMM; and electronic warfare. The second assesses China’s main far-seas activities, including private security companies, strategy-driven research, and the Global Security Initiative. The final section provides a brief analysis of recent trends in Chinese irregular military activity and their implications for the United States and its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;near-seas-activities&quot;&gt;NEAR-SEAS ACTIVITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s near-seas activities primarily focus on maintaining or securing its claims of sovereignty in the South and East China Seas — the world’s most contested waters. Despite Beijing’s phrasing of near-seas defense, the majority of these activities are offensive, justified by the CCP as constituting a response to existential threats. In the same speech in which Xi Jinping declared that China would become a maritime superpower, he explained:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the one hand, we must persist in resolving [territorial] disputes through peaceful methods and negotiation methods. . . . On the other hand, we must be prepared to deal with various complex situations, strengthen the building of forces for the protection of maritime rights and law enforcement, accelerate the pace of construction of a modernized navy, improve maritime rights protection capabilities, and resolutely safeguard China’s maritime rights and interests. We love peace and adhere to the path of peaceful development, but we must never give up our legitimate rights and interests, let alone sacrifice our country’s core interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is willing to push the boundaries of “peaceful methods” when disputes threaten what the state believes to be its legitimate and core interests. In order to avoid broader military escalation, however, China typically aims to maintain or secure its territorial claims through irregular means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section outlines four such irregular methods: the use of sand dredgers; military exercises, harassment campaigns, and forward deployments; the PAFMM; and electronic warfare. It examines the nature of these methods and their relationship with the Chinese government, examples of recent activity, and the results and implications of their use to further China’s near-seas goals. These military-linked activities are also frequently accompanied by actions in the legal and information spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SAND DREDGERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sand dredgers, such as the Tian Kun Hao discussed at the beginning of this chapter, are specialized pieces of equipment that use cutter bars or drills on booms to break up the dirt and rock at the bottom of a body of water and then remove and transport the resulting sand and debris for processing and use in various construction projects. Figure 7.2 depicts the typical components of this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 2017 unveiling of the &lt;em&gt;Tian Kun Hao&lt;/em&gt; — described by its designers as a “magical island-maker” — the crown jewel of Beijing’s dredging fleet was the &lt;em&gt;Tian Jing Hong&lt;/em&gt;, which measures 127 meters (417 feet) long and weighs 2,400 tons. Over the past decade, this self-propelled cutter suction dredger spearheaded many of China’s geographic construction projects in the disputed waters of the South China Sea. In addition to these enormous vessels, Beijing maintains a fleet of smaller dredging vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dredging activities in the water near China and disputed territories have been directly orchestrated by the Chinese government, and Beijing has defended these projects from international criticism across multiple domains. For example, after marine biologists in the United States and other nations criticized China’s island-building project for having devastating effects on local ecosystems, the Chinese government repeatedly defended its efforts as being environmentally friendly. The State Oceanic Administration claimed in 2015 that during these projects, “ecological environmental protection and engineering planning, design, and construction are carried out simultaneously.” Similarly, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) claimed the following year that the construction activities “strictly follow the principle of conducting green project” and are “based on thorough studies and scientific proof.” International scientific consensus indicates the opposite of these statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has pursued two major types of activity using sand dredgers in recent years: artificial island construction and land theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, China has used its dredgers to construct manmade islands in the East and South China Seas, which it then militarized as part of ongoing efforts to assert its claims of sovereignty. Settlements and military installations on these artificial islands permit Beijing to expand the area in which it claims to hold exclusive economic zone (EEZ) jurisdiction. Since 2013, China has created 3,200 acres of land in the Spratly Islands. For example, in early 2015, clusters of Chinese dredgers pulled sand from the seabed and deposited it onto the sparse, undeveloped atoll at Mischief Reef in the eastern Spratly Islands, an area reportedly rich in undeveloped gas and oil resources. Once the land itself was constructed, China set to work establishing military facilities and equipment on the new artificial island, including an airfield and control tower, radar installations, HQ-9B surface-to-air missiles, and YJ-12B anti-ship cruise missiles. Beijing has followed a similar process with other artificial islands in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China has used its sand dredgers to, quite literally, steal land over which it has asserted sovereignty. Driven largely by mainland cities’ efforts to build skyscrapers and large-scale projects such as the construction of the Beijing Daxing International Airport, China has begun to meet its construction industry’s demand for sand by directly harvesting it from Taiwanese coastal territory and outlying islands. To fend off these Chinese incursions and thefts, the Taiwanese coast guard uses radar, watch, and patrol screens, and it has increasingly deployed large patrol ships over the past decade to deter and expel Chinese dredgers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown in Figure 7.3, there was a dramatic increase in the number of Chinese sand dredgers expelled from Taiwanese waters in 2020, according to data compiled by the Taiwanese coast guard. In 2019, the coast guard reported 605 expulsions — already more than an eightfold increase from 2018. But in 2020, the total number of expulsions skyrocketed to 3,991. The number of incidents has decreased but remains higher than the historical norms, with 665 reported in 2021 and 209 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is no definitive explanation for the sudden increase in Chinese sand dredger expulsions in 2020, this surge correlates with a period of rapid infrastructure development in China driven by Covid-19 recovery policies. The resulting high demand for sand to facilitate construction projects could explain the timing of the peak in 2020. Following the outbreak of Covid-19, Chinese GDP dropped 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2020 — the largest year-on-year decrease it has ever experienced. In April 2020, the Politburo requested efforts “expanding effective investment, strengthening investment in traditional and new infrastructure, expediting upgrades to traditional industry, and expanding investment in emerging strategic industries” in order to mitigate economic harms from the pandemic. The Chinese government defined infrastructure broadly to include information infrastructure, big data and computing capabilities, research and development, and more traditional construction projects, including railways, dams, undersea tunnels, and large-scale water transfer projects. This likely drove a significant increase in demand for sand to support construction efforts. China was likely already facing growing demand for sand due to other infrastructure projects with development timelines within this time period as well, such as the Xiamen Xiangan Airport, which is expected to be completed in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of these incursions have occurred in Penghu and Lienchiang Counties. Of the 3,991 expulsions by the Taiwanese coast guard in 2020, for example, 3,422 (86 percent) occurred in Penghu County and 552 (14 percent) occurred in Lienchiang County, while less than 1 percent of incidents in 2020 occurred elsewhere in Taiwanese waters. The geographic positioning of these islands is significant both because their proximity to mainland China would make them early targets during a potential invasion of Taiwan and because it may provide clues to Beijing’s intent. Lienchiang County — otherwise known as the Matsu Islands — is located northwest of Taiwan’s main island in the East China Sea, a short distance from Fuzhou on the Chinese coast. Penghu County, consisting of the Penghu Islands, is located in the Taiwan Strait approximately 50 km west of the main island. By violating Taiwanese waters in these two counties, China moderates the threat it poses — escalating tensions far less than if it routinely approached the main island — while still gaining efficient access to Taiwanese sand. Beijing is also involved in a secretive build-up on Myanmar’s Great Coco Island, including an expanded airstrip, aircraft hangars, and radar equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese island building advances Beijing’s goals to project military power and to defend or reassert sovereign claims, particularly in the South China Sea and surrounding waters. By expanding its presence and capabilities in the region, China aims to coerce other claimants to abandon their rights over maritime areas or islands in favor of Chinese control. Furthermore, by establishing artificial islands with facilities and basing, China has expanded the reach of its claimed EEZs, which now ostensibly can be measured out from the shores of these islands as well. China continues to flout international laws concerning sovereignty and maritime activities as part of a broader “lawfare” campaign to erode trust in the existing international order and norms and to instead shape the international legal environment to better fit its own needs. Lawfare involves the exploitation of international and domestic law to assert the legitimacy of a country’s claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from accessing sand necessary for construction purposes — China uses 40 percent of global sand aggregates annually and has used more sand in the past four years than the United States has over the past century — the Chinese dredger incursions in Taiwanese waters are likely an effort to harass Taiwan, exhaust its civilian coast guard, and disrupt its economy. In addition to losing sand — one of Taiwan’s most valuable maritime resources — Chinese dredger activities have forced Taiwan to divert and overextend coast guard patrols and monitoring, increase expenses to expand coast guard capabilities, and risk physical aggression when confronting intruding vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese dredging activities also have substantial negative impacts on the local ecosystem and may therefore violate Chinese commitments under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which it ratified. This is not Beijing’s first attempt to selectively apply the UN convention, and it serves as an example of Chinese lawfare. By continuing to violate international law, Beijing seeks to cast doubt on the interpretation or legitimacy of previously decided international legal standards and norms in pursuit of a new order of its own making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MILITARY EXERCISES, HARASSMENT CAMPAIGNS, AND FORWARD DEPLOYMENTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China regularly uses the threat and disruption that results from military exercises, harassment campaigns, and forward deployments to coerce and intimidate neighboring states and to assert its claims of sovereignty, all under the guise of routine military activity. This section describes the use of each of these activities to advance Chinese interests and provides examples of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, China regularly conducts large-scale, cross-service military exercises that serve as a threat to other regional countries and that frequently block sea and air lanes and disrupt commercial activity in the South China Sea. These are often strategically timed to serve as retaliation or punishment. In August 2022, for example, Beijing initiated its largest-ever military exercise — including the use of fighter jets, military helicopters, anti-submarine aircraft, combat ships, and Dongfeng-class ballistic missiles — around Taiwan in response to U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, which China perceived as a violation of its sovereignty. This exercise served not only as an overt signal that China rejects Taiwan’s sovereignty but also disrupted 18 flight paths as well as commercial shipping routes used by manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PLAAF, PLAN, China Coast Guard (CCG), and other PLA-linked forces also conduct patrols and air operations — including with unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) — in disputed territories. Through these efforts, the Chinese military has regularly harassed commercial activities, including around the Spratly Islands, Taiwan Strait, and other locations in the South China Sea. Beginning in June 2019, for example, CCG patrols harassed and initiated a standoff with Malaysian and Vietnamese vessels conducting surveying and drilling operations in oil and gas fields in the South China Sea. The PLAAF has even buzzed — flown over very close and quickly — adversaries’ aircraft, including outside of Chinese airspace. In one case, described by U.S. Air Force brigadier general Pat Ryder in March 2023, a Chinese aircraft flew within 20 feet of a U.S. military plane while in international airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China regularly forward deploys troops and equipment in disputed territories, including anchoring ships, particularly in the South China Sea. As part of this effort, it also establishes military or dual-use bases on constructed islands, as described earlier in this chapter. For example, Mischief Reef — depicted previously in Figure 7.3 — has been fully militarized to include hangars, runways, seaports, warehouses, storage facilities, and radar systems. The facilities are equipped with HQ-9B surface-to-air missiles and YJ-12B anti-ship cruise missiles, close-in weapon system emplacements, Type 022 Houbei-class fast-attack boats, and other military equipment. Similarly, the PLA has developed and staffed facilities along the disputed China-India border in the Ladakh region to prepare for future conflict, facilitate the logistics of troop and equipment transfers in the disputed region, and intimidate India. In the fall of 2022, for example, despite publicly coordinating with the Indian government for joint withdrawals from the Gogra-Hotsprings border area, China continued to develop and expand its long-term military presence 50 km south of the withdrawal point, at Pangong Tso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PEOPLE’S ARMED FORCES MARITIME MILITIA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PAFMM is a fleet of ostensibly commercial fishing ships that operate as an independent reserve force and serve as an “assistant to the PLAN” (解放军的助手) in the South China Sea. China has used the PAFMM since at least 1974, when militia ships helped to seize the Paracel Islands from Vietnamese control. But the PAFMM escalated its aggression against competitor ships in the 2000s and increased its collaboration with other Chinese forces to enforce claims of sovereignty in the 2010s. Since China completed a series of artificial island construction projects in the mid-2010s around the Spratly Islands, the PAFMM has regularly participated in law enforcement missions alongside the CCG and People’s Armed Police (PAP) in the region, including in efforts to harass and impede other nations’ commercial vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Chinese government has long defined its militia fleet as “an armed mass organization composed of civilians retaining their regular jobs,” it is important to understand the PAFMM as a direct tool of the government. The PAFMM works in close cooperation with the PLAN, and like all entities operating within China, it is ultimately an instrument for the Chinese government to use to pursue its interests. Given that the PAFMM has not only survived but sustained a key role in Chinese operations in the South China Sea through an assortment of PLAN modernization efforts, some U.S. experts speculate that Beijing may continue to develop and rely on the PAFMM alongside its other PLAN and CCG forces, and it may even rely on the militia as a cheaper option for low-intensity operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of ships in the PAFMM: professional and commercial. Professional “Maritime Militia Fishing Vessels” (MMFVs, or 海上民兵渔船) are built and equipped for the purpose of carrying out maritime military missions on behalf of the Chinese government. The commercial vessels, or “Spratly Backbone Fishing Vessels” (SBFVs, or 南沙骨干渔船), are owned by small or medium enterprises located along the Chinese coast that meet certain size and power requirements to be eligible to participate in militia activities. SBFVs receive payment from the Chinese government to remain present in designated disputed waters — typically with minimal crew onboard to reduce costs since the resulting profit renders fishing activities unnecessary — and to assist the PLA as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most vessels that constitute the PAFMM receive at least one type of central or local government subsidy. MMFVs receive subsidies for professional-grade construction, SBFVs receive subsidies for fuel if they operate around the Spratlys, and either type of vessel is eligible for subsidies that cover general construction, communication, navigation, and safety gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PAFMM has grown more assertive over the past decade, and it regularly works alongside the CCG and in coordination with the PLAN to assert China’s sovereign claims in the South China Sea, particularly around the Spratly Islands. As many as 300 PAFMM vessels are active in the Spratly Islands on an average day, and they regularly trespass within EEZs, harass other vessels, and violate various other international laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PAFMM allows China to assert and defend its sovereign claims, secure resources, coerce neighboring states, limit freedom of navigation, and extend its economic and military reach. These actions are all under the guise of civilian fishing activity, which may limit the threat perception of China’s adversaries or their ability to respond to PAFMM activities. Weaker states may hesitate to confront PAFMM vessels out of fear of provoking an aggressive response from China, while stronger powers may hesitate over the risk of inadvertently confronting a civilian vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2019, for example, a fleet of approximately 275 militia vessels surrounded Sandy Cay, a disputed set of three sand bars located near the Spratly Islands and between Thitu Island (occupied by the Philippines) and Subi Reef (occupied by China). To avoid the state-on-state escalation that would occur if an official CCG vessel that routinely patrols the area were to engage a Philippine vessel, civilian PAFMM vessels harassed Philippine ships in an attempt to coerce them to withdraw, which ultimately led the Philippines to denounce China in April 2019. China refused to withdraw the vessels. But in March 2022, the Philippines launched efforts to begin pushing Chinese vessels out of the waters near Thitu and away from other segments of the Philippine EEZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PAFMM vessels are also ideally positioned to assist with intelligence-gathering operations. Their ongoing presence in contested regions enables these vessels to regularly collect intelligence and monitor adversaries’ activities. Furthermore, in a combat scenario, their size and minimal signal broadcasts make PAFMM vessels difficult to detect, thus enabling them to conduct reconnaissance missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ELECTRONIC WARFARE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beginning in roughly 2018, China expanded its use of electronic warfare to spoof and jam navigation systems in pursuit of its political interests. Spoofing refers to a technique in which an attacker generates a fake signal and tricks a receiver into believing that the signal is genuine. Jamming refers to the process of generating noise in a specific radio frequency in order to interfere with signals traveling to or from satellites. Broadly, these techniques pose navigational risks, can disrupt shipping lanes, and may conceal criminal activity. The primary objectives of these activities appear to be to obscure imports and infrastructure in Chinese ports and to force shipping vessels and aircraft away from Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has used these types of electronic warfare both at domestic ports and throughout the South China Sea. Shipping vessels have reported patterns of Global Navigational Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing at more than 20 Chinese ports since 2019, including Shanghai. With China’s BeiDou Navigation Satellite System operational, Beijing may be emboldened to interfere more with GNSS since Chinese vessels can instead rely on BeiDou. Nearly three-quarters of these spoofing operations center on oil terminals, while the remainder include government offices and a major infrastructure company. This obfuscation may be an attempt to conceal imports of Iranian oil and the visits of high-profile government officials. In the South China Sea, Chinese government and military facilities — including those installed on artificially constructed territory in locations such as the Spratly Islands and Mischief Reef — have routinely used jamming and spoofing technology since at least 2018 to obscure their presence and to redirect foreign vessels away from contested territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of electronic warfare technology could also create additional threats beyond the recorded spoofing and jamming incidents. For example, the Chinese military could use manipulated signals to draw a target vessel off course — a technique known as “meaconing” — and instead lure it to an alternative location for nefarious purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;far-seas-activities&quot;&gt;FAR-SEAS ACTIVITIES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese far-seas activities use tools similar to those employed in its near-seas operations. But rather than pursuing goals related to defense or sovereignty, these activities aim to advance China’s geopolitical and economic reach worldwide, including in Latin America and Africa. This section outlines three such tools: private security companies, strategy-driven research, and the Global Security Initiative. It also examines the nature of these tools and their relationship with the Chinese government, their recent activities, and the results and implications of their use for China’s global objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private security companies (PSCs) include organizations available for hire to provide security and protection services, typically for static personnel and assets or on escort trips. PSCs are not exclusively a Chinese phenomenon, but Beijing has increasingly used them in recent years to protect Chinese nationals and property abroad and to build security-based partnerships, particularly as it continues to expand its BRI investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern PSCs began to form in China in the early 1990s as a mechanism to protect mainland companies from theft and worker revolts. Nearly three decades later, more than 5,000 PSCs operate within China and employ roughly 3 million employees. After China launched the BRI, both Chinese personnel and assets faced growing security challenges, and the demand for Chinese PSCs also increased globally. As the Chinese Ministry of Commerce explained in its 2018 update to the guidelines that regulate overseas enterprises and personnel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With China’s changing participation in global governance and the implementation of the “Belt and Road” cooperation initiative, the scale of China’s outbound investment and cooperation is expanding, and the number of people going abroad each year is increasing. . . . The international situation is increasingly complex and volatile, and various kinds of overseas security risks occur from time to time, which not only affect the overseas operation of our enterprises, but also seriously threaten our overseas personnel. . . . Since 2012, security incidents against Chinese institutions and personnel in high-risk areas abroad have been frequent, and it is urgent to enhance and strengthen the security risk prevention capability of overseas institutions and personnel of Chinese enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few of China’s domestic PSCs had the capability to shift their work abroad, but the ones that did — roughly 20 companies — increasingly took advantage of the chance to contract with entities linked to the Chinese government and its BRI investments. Most are relatively small — on the scale of a few hundred or a few thousand personnel — but expansion follows success, and in recent years some companies have grown by acquiring former competitors. This section focuses only on the activities of Chinese PSCs operating abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PSCs are technically distinct from private military companies (PMCs), which are military contractors for hire, more colloquially thought of as mercenaries. In practice, however, the distinction can be murky. While PMCs are not legal in China, the CCP formally legalized PSCs in September 2009, and the following year the Ministry of Commerce released strict regulations and requirements to govern PSC activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the legalization of PSCs, however, legal restrictions on their activities abroad have remained murky. The Ministry of Commerce regulations predominantly govern PSCs’ domestic activities. While there are legal restrictions on PSC activities abroad during active conflicts, typical overseas operations remain largely unregulated. One significant area of ambiguity is contractors’ ability to carry firearms. Officially this is forbidden, but the Chinese government has permitted some PSCs, such as Hua Xin Zhong An (Beijing) Security Services, to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese government agencies, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and smaller entities that contract with SOEs regularly employ Chinese PSCs for protection and assistance in their overseas ventures. The size and scope of PSC foreign deployments grew over the past decade alongside BRI activities. Amid this expansion and the heightened demand for security services abroad, the Chinese government and insurance sector began to organize the PSC sector into a more formal, professionalized marketplace. International presence and experience will likely be seen as a boon for professionalizing PSC personnel, many of whom are PLA or PAP veterans who lack the knowledge and managerial skills needed to succeed or Singaporean contractors lacking language fluency and cultural knowledge. Since the private security sector and the PLA are undergoing reform simultaneously, it is possible that the Chinese government will coordinate further development and restructuring efforts for each to make the two more interoperable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Appendix provides examples of major Chinese PSCs that operate outside of China, sample locations in which they have been reported to operate, the types of services they provide, and some of their known clients. This list is not exhaustive, but it is representative of major PSC entities and activities based on open-source information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Appendix indicates, most Chinese PSC activity is focused on supporting other Chinese entities as they operate abroad, with an emphasis on economic and development activities. The companies’ tasks focus on defensive security services — including physical security, security training, and security escort services — and consulting on logistics, risk assessment, and emergency response. In Kyrgyzstan, for example, “Zhongjun Junhong” (中军军弘安保集团) has provided security services since 2016, when the car bombing at the Chinese embassy in Bishkek raised concerns about regional security. Most recently, the PSC contracted with the China Railway Group, which is working to establish the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Railway. Similarly, in Kenya, “Beijing DeWe Security Service Group” (德威国际安保集团) provides security for China’s embassy, and additional support for Chinese-backed development projects in Kenya comes from Zhongjun Junhong, “China Security Technology Group” (中国安保技术集团), “Frontier Services Group” (先锋服务集团), and “Shandong Huawei Security Group” (山东华威保安集团).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support role of Chinese PSCs stands in stark contrast to Russian PMCs, which often serve as proxies and force multipliers for Moscow, with a growing emphasis on offensive combat training and operations. As a result, Chinese PSC operations are understudied in the United States and other Western countries. Rather than directly pursuing political and military goals as a substitute for formal military forces, Chinese PSCs facilitate economic and political influence through a security pathway. Chinese security and training services are yet another way to spread trust and influence abroad, particularly with nations that Beijing is already courting through diplomatic and economic partnerships. Even if the activities conducted by a given PSC are not directly related to China’s geopolitical goals, they present an additional threat vector that allows Beijing to build nontraditional security and political relationships through market forces. Simultaneously, PSC activities protect Chinese business and economic interests — providing both an additional benefit and a plausible justification for their routine use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most significantly, the use of PSCs to secure Chinese personnel and assets enables the longevity of Beijing’s BRI investments, most of which are in medium- to high-risk locations in which there has historically been little direct investment. The demand for security services is also unlikely to go away. Regions with heavy BRI presence, including Southeast, Central, and South Asia and East Africa, continue to face instability related to weak governance, terrorism, civil war, and interstate conflict. Beyond the security threats in these areas, Chinese firms risk being targeted as a result of cultural differences, poor working conditions, or negative externalities of their projects. By securing its assets in these regions, China is able to continue to reap the benefits of its economic investments — which are explored in greater detail in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STRATEGY-DRIVEN RESEARCH EFFORTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although government-supported scientific research is routine and not typically defined as a form of warfare, the CCP’s control over the military and all government initiatives has allowed it to operationalize common research methods to gain military intelligence and influence directly connected to its strategic goals. This section details two such efforts: the use of weather balloons and scientific instruments to conduct long-range surveillance, and the use of maritime research efforts to advance China’s strategic goals in the Arctic region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long-Range Surveillance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese long-range surveillance efforts disguised as scientific research burst into the public eye on February 2, 2023, when the U.S. government publicly identified what appeared to be a weather balloon violating U.S. air space as a high-altitude Chinese surveillance platform. However, this was not an isolated incident. Similar balloons had passed over the United States in previous years, though none had previously lingered as long as this balloon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence officers have linked some of these balloon incidents to a broader PLA-led aerospace program that uses airships and balloons, which have been detected operating over five continents. In the wake of the February 2023 incident, the U.S. government imposed restrictions on U.S. companies with links to the program, effectively denying the PLA use of U.S. technology for future surveillance efforts. Still, most of the technology and resources used by the PLA for this project come from a Chinese company that participates in the nation’s civil-military fusion initiative, through which private commercial entities develop and produce technology and equipment for the PLA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese satellites are growing in sophistication and provide extensive coverage of targets of interest within the United States and other countries. Still, balloons and airships offer some advantages: they are cheaper than satellites and can provide persistent overwatch from within the atmosphere, enabling them to gather certain types of information. Additionally, their wayward paths make them more difficult to track, and if they are detected, their appearance as standard weather balloons offers the PLA plausible deniability to conceal surveillance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strategy-Driven Maritime Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s recent maritime research activities have included an emphasis on seabed resources and polar exploration, both of which will advance Chinese strategic priorities in addition to scientific knowledge. These focuses are aligned with Xi Jinping’s instruction to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo that “it is necessary to carry out in-depth scientific investigations in open ocean and polar regions, carry out deep-sea and far-off-shore surveys and research . . . and make preliminary preparations for the utilization of ocean and polar resources.” The Chinese government controls most of these research efforts, thereby giving the CCP influence over research priorities. The Chinese Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) owns and operates the majority of out-of-area oceanographic research vessels that constitute the state’s National Marine Research Fleet. The MNR, which reports to the State Council, formed in March 2018 as a merger of the former Ministry of Land and Resources; State Oceanic Administration; National Bureau of Surveying, Mapping, and Geological Information; and miscellaneous components of several other agencies. In addition to the MNR, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Ocean Mineral Resources R&amp;amp;D Association operate ships within the fleet, as do various Chinese universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep-sea surveys for energy resources and minerals — particularly polymetallic nodules and sulfides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts — are one of the primary focuses of Chinese maritime research activities. China has focused its resource exploration efforts within a set of four zones in which it obtained contract rights from the International Seabed Authority. These include two areas southeast of Hawaii, one east of Guam, and another southeast of Madagascar. China’s focus on identifying and exploiting natural resources is tied to both its economic goals and ambition to become a global maritime superpower. By securing a wealth of seabed resources, China can secure its monopoly over rare-earth minerals that are key components of advanced weapons systems and other advanced technology, improve its technological and economic standing, and potentially gain an important advantage in its competition with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also increased its research focus on the polar regions, likely as a result of China’s Arctic ambitions and strategic interests. In January 2018, the State Council Information Office published a white paper titled “China’s Arctic Policy.” The white paper claimed that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . geographically, China is a ‘Near-Arctic State,’ one of the continental States that are closest to the Arctic Circle. . . . China is also closely involved in the trans-regional and global issues in the Arctic, especially in such areas as climate change, environment, scientific research, utilization of shipping routes, resource exploration and exploitation, security, and global governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s growing strategic emphasis on the Arctic stems from its perception of the region as yet another theater for global competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has used state-led research efforts to assert its presence in the Arctic and to establish sites capable of collecting intelligence on activities in the region. China maintains two permanent Arctic research stations, in Svalbard and Iceland. Although Beijing established a satellite ground station at the Esrange Space Center in Sweden in 2016, the Swedish Space Corporation declined to renew China’s contract to operate the station in 2020 amid reports of the research initiatives’ links to the PLA and intelligence-collection activities. These reports are consistent with U.S. assessments that China uses its Arctic engagements to conduct dual-use research in support of military and intelligence objectives. Moreover, this is a strategy Beijing has explicitly praised — the 2020 Science of Military Strategy identifies the mixing of civilian and military tasks in the polar regions as an ideal method for great powers to “achieve a polar military presence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Polar Research Institute of China, which operates under the oversight of the MNR, conducts much of China’s polar research with its icebreaking research vessel, &lt;em&gt;Xuelong&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Snow Dragon&lt;/em&gt;). The Xuelong completed its ninth Arctic expedition, which covered 12,500 nautical miles, in 2018. In the course of this trip, the research team deployed China’s first unmanned ice station in the Arctic as well as various types of unmanned observation equipment. In 2019, the Polar Research Institute participated in the Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition — the largest in history — alongside teams from Germany, Russia, and Sweden. Other research institutes, including the MNR’s First and Second Institutes of Oceanography, also conduct research expeditions to the polar regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLOBAL SECURITY INITIATIVE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various methods through which China asserts its military and security influence abroad — including those discussed in this chapter as well as international outreach and partnerships pursued by Chinese law enforcement — will likely tie together in Beijing’s Global Security Initiative (GSI). The GSI focuses on expanding China’s involvement in international security governance and conflict resolution, and it serves as a link between Chinese domestic security policy and foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping announced the GSI in his opening remarks at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference in April 2022, explaining that this initiative proposed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;. . . to stay committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to maintain world peace and security; stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs, and respect the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries; stay committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, reject the Cold War mentality, oppose unilateralism, and say no to group politics and bloc confrontation; stay committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, uphold the principle of indivisible security, build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the pursuit of one’s own security at the cost of others’ security; stay committed to peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation, support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises, reject double standards, and oppose the wanton use of unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction; stay committed to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains, and work together on regional disputes and global challenges such as terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity and biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi’s announcement of the GSI was largely overshadowed at the time by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but the Chinese government continued to develop the concept. For example, researchers at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations — a think tank affiliated with the MSS that exerts strong influence over state and party foreign policy decisions — conceptualized the GSI as an effort to demonstrate “China’s shouldering responsibilities as a major country.” An important goal was to respond to traditional and non-traditional security challenges and to ensure “continuation and development of China’s traditional culture and wisdom and an integration and innovation of international security thinking with Chinese characteristics” and the “sublation and transcendence of Western security theory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2023, the Chinese MFA released a white paper outlining the core principles of the GSI and the ways in which China will promote bilateral and multilateral security cooperation with foreign governments and international institutions within the GSI framework. While much of the description provided in this paper is presented through rhetoric that emphasizes peace, inclusion, and cooperation, Beijing’s priorities imply that one of the central objectives of the GSI is to shape global security norms in pursuit of China’s own interests. While China plans to work alongside partner nations and organizations to pursue peaceful resolutions to global security challenges, Beijing will likely operationalize this initiative to promote Chinese technologies and security strategies to foreign governments. As this initiative becomes more established, it may lead Beijing to expand the use of some of its other military and security tools. For example, PSCs may be deployed to resolve security threats in a more active posture rather than serving only as guardians of Chinese personnel and assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-5&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several key takeaways from these irregular military activities, which are an important part of Chinese political warfare. Beijing relies on commercial entities and plausibly routine military activities to further its geopolitical goals, uses legal violations and new sovereign claims to erode international norms and standards, and spreads influence and projects power capabilities through its irregular military actions. While the scale and scope of these activities are concerning, the effectiveness of Beijing’s campaigns to spread geopolitical influence and assert territorial claims is somewhat limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it is notable that most security-based irregular activities rely on ostensibly commercial actors or routine military activities, providing Beijing with plausible deniability while still advancing its geopolitical goals and influence. In Chinese strategic thinking, this concept is known as military-civil fusion: “economic and social development takes into account military needs, and national defense and military modernization are deeply integrated into the economic and social development system. The strategic thinking of military-civilian integration is the inheritance and development of military-civilian dual-use, military-civilian integration, and military-civilian ideas.” Military-civil fusion strategies date back to Mao Zedong, but Xi Jinping has significantly increased China’s emphasis on both this concept and the role of the military in statecraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike nations such as the United States, whose civil-military relationships involve cooperation between separate entities, the Chinese government makes no distinction between civilian and government interests or control. Rather, it relies on a state-led “all-of-society” approach in which all actions and goals must strive to advance the interests of the CCP and in which the military is prioritized above civil concerns. Even the private in “private security company” is a misnomer. In China, the CCP ultimately controls all enterprises, and all companies must work toward the state’s goals. The Chinese government also requires that all security companies are either state-owned sole proprietorships or that more than half of the company’s capital be state-owned.16 Although commercial, political, and military assets are innately united in the Chinese political context, this is not necessarily the case in the countries that China targets with its irregular action, putting other nations in a more challenging legal position when determining responses to Chinese aggression. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to distinguish whether the CCP has directed commercial expansion abroad or if it is seizing the opportunity to capitalize on existing commercial interests both regionally and abroad — or some combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, China intentionally and repeatedly violates international norms and legal standards during its irregular military activities — either directly or through the operations of Chinese corporations. These infractions include EEZ incursions and other challenges to national sovereignty, economic and environmental harms, and violation of international agreements governing maritime activities (including those which China has ratified). These activities raise substantial regional concerns about sovereignty, economic rights and access, environmental protection, and freedom of movement. China likely will also continue to use lawfare strategies to challenge international law, established global norms, and the rules-based international order in favor of a reimagined system tailored to Beijing’s own needs and ideology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Chinese irregular military actions allow Beijing to project influence — whether benevolently through research cooperation or coercively through violations of sovereignty and theft of resources — and economic and military strength. None of these actions are intended to start a regular military conflict. In Xi Jinping’s words, the Chinese government seeks to “resolutely safeguard China’s maritime rights and interests” and build the nation into a “maritime superpower.” Irregular action to reinvent geographic boundaries, influence opinion, and mold international norms in China’s favor allows the state to advance its own strategic and political objectives at relatively low risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;economic-coercion&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC COERCION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The [Belt and Road] Initiative is harmonious and inclusive. It advocates tolerance among civilizations, respects the paths and modes of development chosen by different countries, and supports dialogues among different civilizations on the principles of seeking common ground while shelving differences and drawing on each other’s strengths, so that all countries can coexist in peace for common prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-action-plan-on-the-belt-and-road-initiative&quot;&gt;– Action Plan on the Belt and Road Initiative&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This chapter examines Chinese economic coercion, which is a key component of political warfare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As Linda Robinson argues in her study of modern political warfare, the “tactic of economic subversion can be seen in the overlap of the diplomatic/political (routine diplomacy) and economic (trade) spheres. Political is often — but not necessarily — carried out covertly, but it must be undertaken outside the context of conventional war.” U.S. diplomat George Kennan similarly noted that economic measures are an important tool of political warfare to weaken an adversary short of armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic coercion is a tool of political warfare as old as diplomacy itself and not one unique to China. Indeed, Pericles issued the Megarian Decrees in the 5th century BCE, blocking Megara’s traders from Athenian markets in an attempt to reincorporate the city-state into the Athenian empire. The United States has also employed these tools during the Cold War. The rapid rise of China’s economy, as well as its role as the world’s largest manufacturer and the world’s largest economy on a purchasing power parity basis, affords it unprecedented economic power to use for diplomatic and political ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government views economic competition over emerging technologies as a central pillar of competition with the United States. Within that context, Beijing views the ability to influence global standards and leverage economic partnerships as a means to shape the economic “battlefield” to gain an advantage over the United States and other competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is particularly well placed to employ coercive economic tools due to several features of its economic system beyond its sheer size. Chinese leaders have both the willingness and ability to employ domestic capital for political ends by, for example, directing the investment of its numerous state-owned enterprises. This extends to China’s private firms as well. One survey of China’s 100 largest private firms by revenue found that 95 of their founders or de facto heads belonged to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) organs, a decision that signals allegiance to China and maintains important relationships with state political agents. Because of the networked nature of China’s economic sector that encompasses levers of state power, China faces fewer obstacles to directing capital flows in coercive ways than in more liberal market systems. Moreover, international perception of Chinese markets enhances the efficacy of Chinese economic coercion. For example, many international industries and states simply view the Chinese domestic market as too large to forego and conclude that China’s meteoric economic growth will impose large future costs should an industry go against China in the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic coercion is multifaceted, and elements of it are captured in adjacent terms such as “geo-economics” and “economic statecraft.” As used in this chapter, economic coercion is defined as the implied, threatened, or actual imposition of economic costs in order to weaken a target. A state, in this case China, can use a variety of economic levers as part of political warfare. This may include implementing trade restrictions, such as sanctions and boycotts, or taking an action that inflicts negative second-order economic effects, such as imposing limits on the number of Chinese tourists to a country. While these tools are regularly employed as part of standard international trade, the key to classifying these actions as economic coercion is through their explicit or implicit linkage to the Chinese government’s desire to expand Beijing’s influence and legitimacy, as well as weaken its adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government routinely employs various forms of economic coercion to overtly or covertly encourage political and economic dependence on China, shape standards and norms in line with CCP goals and philosophy, and punish or deter activities that run counter to its own political interests. These strategies largely seek long-term impacts, but the steady development of relationships with Chinese companies and government financial entities portends that the economic dimension of Chinese political warfare will be long-lasting and potentially highly impactful. Unlike some of China’s more overt acts, most forms of economic coercion can be plausibly denied as routine statecraft, and many — such as direct investments or provision of affordable technology — are beneficial to partner nations. With these Chinese economic activities accepted and even encouraged, Beijing is likely to continue expanding its irregular economic playbook in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter explores economic coercion as practiced by China as a method of political warfare. This chapter asks two main questions: How is economic coercion understood and employed by Chinese policymakers? And what are its effects on the conduct of international politics? To do this, the chapter explores Chinese economic coercion in three contexts: Belt and Road Initiative investments, the expansion of the Digital Silk Road, and international political disputes. It concludes with key takeaways related to economic coercion as a tool of Chinese political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;belt-and-road-initiative&quot;&gt;BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI, 一带一路) — originally known as the One Belt, One Road Initiative — during state visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia in 2013. During his September 2013 speech at Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan, Xi proclaimed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In order to make the economic ties between European and Asian countries closer, the mutual cooperation deeper and the development space wider, we can build the “Silk Road Economic Belt” together with an innovative cooperation model. This is an important project that will benefit all the people along the route. We can start from the following aspects, leading from point to point, from line to line, and gradually form a large regional cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2022, Beijing had reached BRI development agreements with more than 140 nations. However, as Figure 8.1 demonstrates, annual investments in BRI projects have been lower since 2020 than in the preceding years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section explores three ways in which China uses the BRI to coerce partners: leveraging political support as an unofficial condition for economic partnership, using large sums of debt to China as leverage, and capitalizing on the appeal of bilateral debt relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;INVESTMENTS LEAD TO POLITICAL INFLUENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s BRI agreements allow it to reinforce existing partnerships and forge new relationships that result in additional international political support, including through the disruption of existing relationships between partner countries and Taiwan. How overtly China exchanges BRI investments for political influence varies by country type. The exchange is most overt in developing countries, where China provides development finance and in return receives political support on issues such as Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang. However, Chinese efforts to gain political influence often change as partners’ economies become more advanced. In states with mid-sized economies, China typically uses state-owned enterprises and investment funds to garner influence, while in advanced economies China’s leverage depends on state-backed funds and private investors. In less subtle cases, a country may quickly reverse its positions on issues of interest to China in conjunction with BRI agreements, clearly demonstrating the political gains that Beijing secures alongside its development endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panama, for example, severed all diplomatic relations with Taiwan and strongly endorsed the One-China Principle in June 2017. This switch — which Taiwan perceived as a significant setback to its diplomatic goals in the region — was quickly rewarded. In November 2017, Panama became the first country in the Americas to join the BRI when it reached an agreement with China to support the construction of the Panama-Chiriquí Railway. During the same year, the Panamanian government awarded contracts to Chinese companies to construct a cruise terminal at the Pacific end of the Panama Canal and a container port and liquid natural gas plant at the Atlantic end. Various development projects along the canal continued to receive heavy investments from Chinese firms in subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in September 2019, the Solomon Islands ended its relationship with Taiwan and established official ties with China. Shortly thereafter, four cabinet officials who had opposed the switch were removed from office, and a fifth resigned. Within weeks, Prime Minister Manasseh Damukana Sogavare traveled to Beijing and signed five memorandums of understanding (MOUs), including a formal BRI partnership agreement. China agreed to construct a multimillion-dollar stadium for the 2023 Pacific Games and infrastructure projects in support of the redevelopment of the Solomons’ most lucrative gold mine. In addition, the state-owned conglomerate China Sam Enterprise Group signed an agreement with the Tulagi provincial government for exclusive rights to the entirety of the island territory, though this agreement was later overturned. Subsequent agreements between China and the Solomon Islands have included the deployment of Chinese law enforcement and military personnel and a contract for Huawei to construct telecommunications towers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shifts in policy positions in partner countries may or may not be mandated by their MOUs with China; they can also result from political pressure to maintain positive relationships and avoid reprisal from China. For an example of how China responds when one of its partners takes political actions that run counter to its interests — such as violating the One-China Princple — see the discussion of Lithuania later in this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEBT TRAPS AND FINANCIAL LEVERAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2020, China had lent roughly $1.5 trillion in loans and grants to more than 150 countries — making it the world’s largest creditor, with claim to more than 5 percent of global GDP. As China’s BRI vision came to life, however, there were strings attached. Chinese loans not only often mandate the use of Chinese workers, result in ineligibility for multilateral financial management mechanisms, and demand political support for China, they have also sometimes pulled recipients into a “debt trap,” whereby the existence of the debt itself can be used as leverage for China to secure its own political or economic gains. The 15 BRI partner countries most in debt to China, as measured by the ratio of long-term debt owed (to China) to gross national income (GNI), are detailed in Figure 8.2. Angola, which has the second-highest debt to GNI ratio, also has the second-largest total debt owed to China — it owed $22 billion in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large debts to China leave countries vulnerable to manipulation. In 2021, due to the country’s large debt owed to China, Laos approved a 25-year concession agreement between Électricité du Laos and China Southern Power Grid Company that allows the latter, a majority Chinese-owned company, to control the Laotian national power grid, including electricity exports. Hydropower accounts for more than four-fifths of Laotian electricity generation, and the concession agreement may also impact the country’s dams and water resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most well-known example of this “debt-trap diplomacy” is that of Sri Lanka. After the government defaulted on Chinese loans for the development of the Hambantota port, the Sri Lankan government granted China a 99-year lease for control of the port and 15,000 acres of surrounding land in December 2017. In the years since, China’s leverage over Sri Lanka has only strengthened. With its debt crisis growing, Sri Lanka accepted a $3 billion loan from China in 2020 to manage its existing debts, opting for the easier path of Chinese support over International Monetary Fund debt restructuring or the austerity measures required by the Paris Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an ongoing debate among Western analysts over how intentionally malicious Chinese lending is and whether “debt trap” is a fair descriptor. Researchers have correctly pointed out that each case of lending is nuanced, with many partner nations seeking Chinese investment and multiple factors contributing to financial distress. Regardless of the level of premeditation, however, Chinese loans — including their uniquely opaque and restrictive terms — create political and economic leverage that China uses to shape the geopolitical environment to its advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DEBT RELIEF AND FORGIVENESS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing has historically limited debt relief options available to its partners, including explicitly forbidding participation in some international debt management efforts, such as the Paris Club, as one of the terms of its BRI contracts. When it does engage in debt relief or forgiveness, Beijing prefers to operate through bilateral arrangements to maintain control of all terms and conditions. Recently, economic stresses related to the Covid-19 pandemic increased both the demand for and frequency of approval for debt relief or forgiveness — agreements that can improve international perception of China and incentivize BRI partner countries to continue economic partnerships with China. Some analysts have assessed that these decisions may specifically aim to manage the “public relations nightmare” of claims of debt-trap diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his 2021 speech at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, Xi Jinping announced that “China will exempt African LDCs [least developed countries] from debt incurred in the form of interest-free Chinese government loans due by the end of 2021.” This forgiveness applied to 23 interest-free loans to 17 African countries. According to estimates from the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University, the total sum of the debt forgiven was likely between $45 million and $610 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the debt cancellation from the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, there are three other primary mechanisms for debt relief from China: the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), contributions to the International Monetary Fund’s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust, and ad hoc debt relief. Within each of these mechanisms, Beijing may opt to relieve debts through renewal and refinancing, reprofiling and rescheduling, restructuring, or either partial or full forgiveness. In September 2022, for example, China agreed to restructure Ecuador’s debt by extending the maturity of loans from the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China until 2027 and 2032, respectively, resulting in relief of $1.4 billion until 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;digital-silk-road&quot;&gt;DIGITAL SILK ROAD&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First introduced as part of the standard connectivity plan for the BRI in 2015, the Digital Silk Road (DSR) aims to spread and synthesize Chinese efforts related to telecommunications, e-commerce, hardware, software, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), the Internet of Things, and other digital infrastructure and norms. In his speech at the 2017 Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, Xi Jinping officially described the DSR as the technological component of the BRI, saying that China “should pursue innovation-driven development and intensify cooperation in frontier areas such as digital economy, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and quantum computing, and advance the development of big data, cloud computing and smart cities so as to turn them into a digital silk road of the 21st century.” Figure 8.3 provides details about the five main categories of DSR efforts as well as each category’s primary components and examples of Chinese companies that further Beijing’s goal of technological dominance and influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the primary BRI investments, DSR projects are driven by private companies. Nonetheless, these companies maintain close ties to the CCP, including with regard to both goals and objectives and, in many cases, the ability to access or exploit the access granted by the technologies they sell. Still, coordination and information sharing in this ecosystem remain inconsistent and decentralized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section examines China’s DSR-related goals and strategies as they apply to software, hardware, and digital infrastructure as well as global standards for emerging technology. Chinese efforts to shape public opinion and the information environment are explored in greater detail in the information and disinformation chapter (Chapter 5) of this report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, AND INFRASTRUCTURE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the DSR, Chinese companies have expanded their presence in the markets for software, hardware, and technological infrastructure. These different products give Beijing the ability to compete with U.S. and other Western companies in all levels of the internet technology stack, as seen in Figure 8.4. This means that Chinese companies not only provide software, applications, and services but also control the very systems that process, store, and transmit data. While user applications such as social media platforms, games, and shopping services spread influence and collect some data, control of hardware and infrastructure permits Beijing more complete access to data and surveillance as well as control over the continuation of services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risk of exploitation is greatest when Chinese technology companies control multiple — or all — layers of the internet technology stack. For example, after funding, designing, and helping to construct the African Union (AU) headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Beijing controlled the building’s networks, software, and hardware, including security camera systems. In 2018, the French newspaper &lt;em&gt;Le Monde&lt;/em&gt; broke allegations that China had used this access to regularly obtain confidential AU data and recordings. Beijing denied the accusation, and the AU maintained its relationship with Chinese companies to avoid damaging its relationship with Beijing. With little having changed, China was once again detected stealing data and camera footage from the AU headquarters in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLOBAL STANDARDS FOR EMERGING TECHNOLOGY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to seeking market dominance and control of information, Beijing’s DSR efforts also emphasize the importance of establishing and shaping global standards and norms for emerging technology that are in line with the CCP’s interests. Beijing has a broader agenda than simply ensuring that its companies are well positioned to compete in emerging markets. Standards carry with them norms and values, including in relation to issues of contention between the Chinese government and Western democracies, such as free speech, privacy, and surveillance. For example, Chinese companies working on AI and the Internet of Things have advanced facial recognition and surveillance technology, which the Chinese government routinely uses to monitor and suppress political dissidents and ethnic minorities. Chinese efforts to set standards to their preferences — in other words weighted toward authoritarian states’ ability to surveil populations and against personal freedoms — will allow greater freedom for Beijing to operate both at home and around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October 2021, the CCP released its “National Standardization Development Outline,” a white paper that laid out near- and long-term goals (to 2025 and 2035, respectively) for technological standardization. Colloquially known as “China Standards 2035,” the document called for the nation to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Strengthen standards research in key technical fields. Conduct standardized research in artificial intelligence, quantum information, biotechnology, and other fields. Utilizing the integration of informatization and industrialization for new generation information technology with broad potential for future applications such as big data, blockchain, healthcare, new energy, new materials, etc. China will simultaneously deploy technological research and development in coordination with research on and formulation of standards and their promotion in industry, to accelerate the pace of industrialization for new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In pursuit of these goals, China has both expanded its participation in international standards-setting processes and has sought to establish new avenues for standards development. For example, Chinese companies such as ZTE and Huawei have been heavily involved in the development processes for international standards related to 5G and the Internet of Things. Outside of the mainstream standardization community, China has also explored the notion of developing its own Belt and Road Standards Forum as a parallel alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Beijing prioritizes the expansion of initiatives such as the DSR, which aim to reshape global norms and standards, the best opportunity for the United States and its allies to counter Chinese strategy may be to establish a united democratic alternative. This is further complicated by differences in standards and inconsistent priorities between other leading nations, including the United States and EU members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economic-sanctions-and-punishment-in-political-disputes&quot;&gt;ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AND PUNISHMENT IN POLITICAL DISPUTES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China frequently employs coercive economic sanctions to punish nations for taking political or economic actions that contradict Beijing’s interests and to incentivize policies that are more in line with China’s goals. While it sometimes uses traditional sanctions in higher-impact cases, Beijing frequently relies on implicit sanctions, informal boycotts, and regulatory actions to compel states to adhere to its demands. Figure 8.5 highlights examples of Chinese use of economic punishments to attempt to coerce more favorable outcomes in political disputes since 2000. The types of activities that most frequently provoke this response from Beijing include economic restrictions impacting Chinese companies, political activities that threaten Chinese claims of sovereignty, and arms sales and security activity. This section provides brief examples of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESTRICTIONS ON CHINESE COMPANIES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other states’ restrictions on the activities of Chinese companies — particularly technology companies involved in the DSR, such as Huawei — have increasingly provoked economic punishment by China. After the Australian government banned Huawei and ZTE from providing technology for 5G networks in 2018, for example, Beijing responded with both formal and informal trade restrictions on imports such as barley, beef, coal, lobster, and wine. The Chinese-Australian relationship further soured in 2020 when Australia called for an international probe into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic. Ultimately, however, Chinese restrictions on Australia caused only modest and short-term economic impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some modest economic harms, this case demonstrates the mixed effects of this strategy, as China’s punishment campaign against Australia may have harmed Australian attitudes toward China. Researchers at the University of Adelaide estimated that Australia forwent $4.9 billion in export revenues due to Chinese restrictions between July 2020 and February 2021. Yet marked shifts in Australian public opinion of China also coincided with the economic dispute. Polling conducted by the Lowy Institute found that Australian public opinion toward China became increasingly negative as the China-Australia economic relationship deteriorated. In 2020, 41 percent of Australians polled perceived China as a security threat, and 55 percent saw China as an economic partner. This shifted against China in 2021, when 63 percent of participants saw China as a security threat and only 34 percent viewed China as an economic partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, this type of response also provides Beijing with the credibility to influence other states’ decisions simply by threatening to do the same to them if they act against Chinese companies. For example, in 2019, as Germany contemplated excluding Huawei from its next-generation 5G network, the Chinese ambassador to Germany warned that “there will be consequences. The Chinese government will not stand idly by” and threatened action against the German automotive industry, which relies heavily on Chinese markets. Germany relented and declined to prohibit Huawei, which by late 2022 accounted for 59 percent of German 5G radio access network equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHALLENGES TO SOVEREIGNTY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also used economic coercion against countries in response to actions that challenge perceptions of Chinese sovereignty, including issues of political legitimacy and territorial control. Examples include supporting the governments or people of Taiwan, Tibet, and Hong Kong; disregarding Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea; supporting political dissidents; and criticizing Beijing’s record of human rights violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, in July 2021, the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Taiwan would establish a “Taiwanese Representative Office” in Lithuania later that year. While the office does not have diplomatic accreditation, it functions as a de facto embassy — similar to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States. The decision to permit the office to use the name “Taiwan” rather than “Taipei” sparked fierce condemnation from Chinese authorities. In August 2021, Beijing recalled its ambassador to Lithuania and demanded that the Lithuanian ambassador be recalled as well, charging that the decision to support Taiwan “severely undermines China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” As Lithuania allowed the creation of the Taiwanese Representative Office to move forward, its economic and diplomatic relationship with China continued to deteriorate. China suspended Lithuanian visas and restricted trade between the two countries, including by delisting Lithuania as a country of origin and directly prohibiting imports of Lithuanian beef, dairy, and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China also introduced secondary sanctions against firms that purchase products from Lithuanian companies. This development provoked criticism from the Lithuanian tech industry, which was most heavily impacted. For example, Kristijonas Vizbaras, cofounder of the laser manufacturer the Brolis Group, complained that the laser industry had “been sacrificed for this ‘value-based’ policy,” and unless the situation changed, companies like his would no longer be able to operate in Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ARMS SALES AND SECURITY ACTIVITY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, China has enacted other coercive economic measures in response to defense and security activities that undermine Chinese goals or have the capacity to threaten Chinese territorial claims. Examples include arms sales, security cooperation negotiations or agreements, and military deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, Beijing has responded with targeted sanctions on arms manufacturers. For example, after the United States approved a $2.2 billion arms sale to Taiwan in 2019 — including 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, 250 Stinger missiles, and other equipment — China responded with sanctions against the U.S. manufacturing companies involved in the deal. Typically, however, these measures target other nations to compel them to decline security assistance from the United States and its allies or to otherwise de-escalate military activities that could potentially constrain Chinese interests. When South Korea — in partnership with the United States — deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense platform in 2016 to guard against North Korea, China lodged an official diplomatic complaint against South Korea, imposed restrictions on South Korean tourists, forced the closure of a company involved in securing the THAAD deployment site, cut subsidies, and generated additional regulatory hurdles for South Korean companies. China’s economic punishment against South Korea dragged into the following year, until South Korean president Moon Jae-in relented to Beijing’s pressure and publicly affirmed that his country would follow the “Three Nos” policy. President Moon Jae-in promised that South Korea would not deploy additional THAAD systems, would not participate in a missile defense network led by the United States, and would not enter into a trilateral military alliance with the United States and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-6&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic coercion is a viable means of political warfare. In addition to the direct geopolitical gains China secures through economic coercion — including leverage and the spread of influence — Beijing also uses these forms of outreach to create dependencies on China, particularly in the developing world. Examples include vying for relationships with U.S. partners. Despite India’s close security relationship with the United States, China has cultivated a strong economic relationship with India. Affordability is India’s primary concern with regard to emerging technologies, so the Indian government relies on Chinese companies for a large portion of its data and telecommunications equipment and infrastructure. As long as China remains able to offer cheap options to developing countries, these countries will depend on Chinese technologies and will be motivated to maintain positive relationships with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As China’s wide range of coercive economic activities demonstrate, economic competition likely will involve an integrated, whole-of-society approach, including policy and norms, information, finance and trade, infrastructure, and all layers of the technology stack. At the same time, China likely will continue to wield both investments and economic punishments such as sanctions to keep partner nations invested in the Chinese global economic project, dependent on Beijing’s support and infrastructure, and behaving in line with Chinese sovereign claims and geopolitical goals. Beijing is likely to continue to focus on economic tools useful for economic competition, particularly if some of its more overtly malicious pathways are challenged or restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;countering-china&quot;&gt;COUNTERING CHINA&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most comprehensive and serious challenge to U.S. national security is the PRC’s coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region and the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-us-national-defense-strategy-2022&quot;&gt;– U.S. National Defense Strategy (2022)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The PRC is the only competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it. Beijing has ambitions to create an enhanced sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and to become the world’s leading power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-us-national-security-strategy-2022&quot;&gt;– U.S. National Security Strategy (2022)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;China is engaged in extensive and aggressive political warfare across the globe, including in the U.S. homeland.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; These actions are perpetrated by such organizations as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), Ministry of State Security (MSS), Ministry of Public Security (MPS), Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, United Front Work Department, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A wide range of non-state or quasi-state actors, from hacktivists to private security companies, support the official acts of the state. The primary tools of Chinese political warfare include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; China’s intelligence services, such as the MSS and MPS, are engaged in extensive intelligence activity to expand Chinese power and influence. In examining over 100 Chinese espionage cases directed at the United States or U.S. entities, this report concludes that the United States has suffered substantial losses in terms of trade secrets, military technology, sensitive data on U.S. citizens, classified U.S. government information, and harassment of individuals — including members of the Chinese diaspora — residing in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Chinese organizations, including units within the PLA, are involved in an aggressive cyber campaign against corporations, universities, government agencies, media, think tanks, nongovernmental organizations, and other targets to advance China’s interests. On the economic front, these efforts are designed to help China leapfrog ahead of the West by skipping the extensive and time-consuming research and development phases for new technologies. Chinese cyber operations are also designed to enable influence campaigns on domestic and international audiences, collect information, assist with potential offensive military campaigns, and improve China’s artificial intelligence and big data analytics capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information and Disinformation Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; China is engaged in numerous activities overseas — including in the U.S. homeland — to influence decisionmaking and popular support to gain a competitive advantage. Beijing seeks to tightly control the image of China abroad, including by influencing companies, organizations, and individuals that criticize China, from the National Basketball Association to Hollywood studios. While there has been self-censorship in Hollywood to avoid antagonizing Beijing, the two most successful movies of all time in China both involve wars against the United States: &lt;em&gt;The Battle at Lake Changjin&lt;/em&gt; (2021) and &lt;em&gt;Wolf Warrior 2&lt;/em&gt; (2017).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United Front Work:&lt;/strong&gt; The CCP is involved in numerous efforts to extend its reach overseas through united front work, which involves activity to protect and bolster the image of China and the CCP. Led by the United Front Work Department, this activity has targeted U.S. universities, news media, ethnic Chinese abroad, and others inside of the United States and other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular Military Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; The PLA, PLA Navy, PLA Air Force, PLA Rocket Forces, People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia, and private security companies linked to China are involved in widespread efforts to expand Chinese influence. These organizations are involved in near-seas activities (which focus on securing Chinese interests in such areas as the South and East China Seas) and far-seas activities (which are global in scope). According to CSIS estimates, there are nearly two dozen Chinese private security companies operating overseas, including in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic Coercion:&lt;/strong&gt; China is increasingly engaged in the threat or imposition of economic sanctions or inducements to influence decisionmaking to gain a competitive advantage. There are a wide range of examples of Chinese economic coercion, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Digital Silk Road (DSR). The latter aims to create — and use as political leverage — Chinese global expansion in telecommunications, e-commerce, hardware, software, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning, the Internet of Things, and other digital infrastructure and norms across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has several strategic goals in conducting these activities. The most important include preserving the CCP, expanding Chinese power and influence, and weakening the United States as part of balance-of-power competition. China’s broader strategy aims to pursue modernization to expand its military might, economic power, and technological prowess; improve its governance; and revise the international order in support of Beijing’s system of governance and national interests. In addition, China also conducts political warfare — rather than armed conflict — in an attempt to avoid conventional war and limit security concerns from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter examines ways that the United States and its partners can compete with China below the threshold of conventional warfare. It asks: What options do the United States and its partners have to counter Chinese political warfare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the United States has been slow to identify the broad range of Chinese activities and has failed to develop a systematic strategy to oppose them, this chapter outlines several core components of a strategy to counter Chinese political warfare and compete more effectively. U.S. policy should include checking China’s global expansion by competing on a sustained basis; encouraging a progression toward a pluralistic political system in China that respects human rights; developing economically viable alternatives to Chinese influence over third countries, in particular in the global south; and engaging in diplomatic negotiations with China to keep communication channels open and reach agreements that protect and enhance U.S. interests where feasible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this chapter focuses on five steps that are critical to compete with China below the threshold of conventional warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;leverage-democratic-principles-as-an-alternative-to-ccp-authoritarianism&quot;&gt;LEVERAGE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CCP AUTHORITARIANISM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition today is to a great extent a balance-of-power struggle between rival political, economic, and military systems. China under Xi Jinping is one of the most authoritarian countries in the world, according to the nonpartisan organization Freedom House; eschews a free press; and has become more sophisticated and aggressive in using coercive tactics to shape media narratives and suppress reporting that is critical of China and the CCP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has blocked information by creating a “Great Firewall.” As one human rights report concluded in 2022, “China was the world’s worst environment for internet freedom for the eighth consecutive year.” China’s digital firewall has blocked or censored hundreds of thousands of websites, apps, and services that the government has assessed contain content unfavorable to China, including Google, YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, Wikipedia, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and numerous virtual private network providers. The country has detained and jailed journalists, human rights activists, religious leaders, and civilians for sharing online content critical of the Chinese government. It has also tightened control over China’s technology sector and enforced rules that require digital platforms to utilize their algorithms to promote CCP ideology. China has also increasingly attempted to expand its authoritarianism on digital networks across the globe, triggering what some have termed “digital authoritarianism.” As one declassified U.S. intelligence assessment concluded, “China and other authoritarian governments are using cyber espionage, attacks, and influence operations to extend the coercive reach of their ideological enforcement and political control efforts beyond their borders. In some cases, they are impinging on Western democracies’ sovereignty and interests to enhance their domestic stability.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its democratic partners have categorically different systems. Freedom — of the ballot box, the press, religion, and commerce — is at the core of Enlightenment values. As the English philosopher John Locke argued, reason “teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions.” The United States’ democratic principles are outlined in the preamble to the Constitution: “to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.” The United States and its partners should counter Chinese political warfare by supporting these democratic principles and combating authoritarianism across the globe and on all forums, from digital platforms and the internet to corporate boardrooms, educational institutions, and the halls of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are several pitfalls that U.S. policymakers need to avoid. First, they need to stay clear of the McCarthyism of the 1940s and 1950s, which involved false or unproven public accusations of subversion and treason. Countering China’s intelligence operations, information and disinformation operations, united front work, economic coercion, and other activities — including in the U.S. homeland — is critical. But it must be based on facts, judicial oversight, and democratic principles. Such evidence must also be transparently communicated to the American public, who are increasingly the target of China’s operations, particularly in the information and commercial spheres. Second, the United States needs to avoid taking actions overseas that are inconsistent with U.S. democratic principles and are bound to be counterproductive and ineffective. During the Cold War, for example, the United States was involved in overthrowing — or attempting to overthrow — several regimes (such as Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, and Chile in 1973) and orchestrating covert action programs (such as the 1983 mining of several Nicaraguan harbors) that ultimately undermined U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;understand-china&quot;&gt;UNDERSTAND CHINA&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is to better understand how China views competition with the United States. What are China’s objectives in utilizing political warfare? What are its main instruments? What vulnerabilities and weaknesses of China can be exploited?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this report highlights, a close analysis of Chinese activity indicates that Beijing has conducted a broad political warfare campaign against the United States and its partners across the globe. To conduct these actions, Beijing invests substantial resources in understanding the United States, including in translating documents and exploring the contours of U.S. culture and politics. The China International Communications Group, which is owned and operated by the CCP’s Central Propaganda Department, distributes the CCP line on numerous issues to overseas audiences, directs research on foreign media, and conducts language training programs. The English-language training market in China was approximately $75 billion in China in 2022. Some analysis estimates that the market for English-language training in China will increase by over $70 billion between 2021 and 2025. In contrast, the market size for all language instruction in the United States was only $1.5 billion in 2022. Even though China has a much larger population than the United States, Beijing still spends roughly 14 times more per capita on English language training than the United States does on all language training. More broadly, the U.S. government and private sector have failed to invest in the language skills and expertise to effectively compete with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. leaders during the Cold War would have been horrified at this discrepancy. The U.S. government invested significant resources in conducting information campaigns and translating Soviet documents into English. Among the most important organizations was the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, which monitored, translated, and disseminated massive amounts of news from the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries. Researchers, activists, journalists, policymakers, and the public relied on its invaluable translations. When the Cold War ended, however, the United States slashed the budgets for these types of organizations. In 2019, the U.S. government shut down all outside access to the Open Source Enterprise, the successor of the Foreign Broadcast Information Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still time to change. One step is to build a twenty-first century open-source information service. The United States should start by having the Open Source Enterprise, embedded in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)’s Directorate of Digital Innovation, make its translations of Chinese material publicly available, as the Foreign Broadcast Information Service did during the Cold War. In the absence of such efforts, the private sector has taken the lead in translating Chinese material, though China has made access to material more difficult by expanding its anti-espionage laws and restricting overseas access to China-based data sources. For national security issues, some of the best examples are CSIS’s &lt;em&gt;Interpret: China&lt;/em&gt;, the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University, and the Department of the Air Force’s China Aerospace Studies Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;strengthen-defense&quot;&gt;STRENGTHEN DEFENSE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important component of U.S. strategy needs to be conducting more effective defensive measures against Chinese political warfare. As used here, defense refers to efforts to deter, resist, blunt, and mitigate attacks from an adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is cyber. U.S. policymakers need to continue to develop a concerted effort to establish a cyber doctrine for the United States and consider how the United States’ capabilities stack up against China’s capabilities. An initial comparison reveals that China holds an advantage in one key area: the capability to hold critical infrastructure at risk. The obvious and urgent conclusion is that the United States must focus on bolstering its cyber defenses. It is currently too easy for an adversary such as China to hold at risk elements that make the U.S. economy and U.S. society function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unclassified assessment is unable to compare the most exquisite cyber tools in each nation’s arsenal, but the U.S. government should run classified simulations on how China might fight in the cyber domain and how the United States might defend itself, evaluating variables such as the availability of the Global Positioning System, internet connectivity around the United States, and redundancy of communications infrastructure in a time of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing cyber norms of behavior is also worthwhile, even if China refuses to accede. Norms should include a rejection of state-based internet protocol theft for financial gain, privacy protection for citizens, and a prohibition on targeting of critical infrastructure that supports civilian populations. Ideally, scientific exchanges would be protected across borders, with free flow of data. The 2015 agreement between U.S. president Barack Obama and Chinese leader Xi Jinping failed to create these norms, but global views have evolved. A group of like-minded nations might be willing to speak out against China’s approach and even impose costs on Beijing for undermining common-sense norms. As part of this norm-setting effort, the United States should prioritize blocking Beijing’s attempt to take control of standards-setting bodies such as the International Telecommunication Union, which is the UN agency for information and communications technologies. The last election for head of the International Telecommunication Union was a big win for democratic values, but China has been pursuing a strategy of bureaucratic takeovers for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China holds an additional advantage in its years-long pursuit of diverse datasets. It can use that data for training artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) systems or for learning how to manipulate U.S. public opinion. China’s even more comprehensive collection of data on its own population is also a ready-made roadmap to Chinese public sentiment. Targeting that internal tracking data for intelligence collection could provide a roadmap to public sentiment within China on topics from internal discontent to views on a conflict with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its partners should also work to pull even and surpass China in two critical technologies: AI/ML and quantum computing. The United States needs a revamped approach to acquiring and incorporating AI/ML capabilities in its military and intelligence planning and must establish rules for when AI/ML capabilities should be used in conflict scenarios. The faster the United States understands this technology and sets guardrails, the less likely China will be able to define the field and write the rules. In addition, the United States and its partners should undertake a sprint in quantum computing, which is a critical technology that could break current encryption and create stronger future encryption. The capability to read even encrypted data creates an incentive for massive theft of information today for readability tomorrow. Post-quantum encryption will be necessary to deter and counter such an effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another useful example is influence campaigns. In the United States, the creation and strengthening of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) made it possible to disclose details of several Chinese and other foreign information activities. While FARA is a useful tool for illuminating some behavior, it is by no means comprehensive. It is accompanied by separate reporting structures and databases for the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) and the Department of Education’s Section 117 disclosures, neither of which include detailed descriptions of the activities that were carried out at the behest of a foreign sponsor. Beijing has demonstrated its ability to navigate Western transparency and openness to its advantage. For example, this report documented how Beijing worked within the different confines of U.S., Australian, and UK law to advance its information interests. In the context of united front work, China generally adheres to the letter of the law, but has found ways to exploit gray areas or areas where the law is silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional challenge is developing countermeasures to combat China’s transnational repression of its citizens and diaspora communities. The tool kit for achieving these ends is limited. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Justice (DOJ) have demonstrated some resolve in expanding the number of cases they are willing to pursue, including indicting a Chinese student, Xiaolei Wu, in 2022 on charges that he stalked and threatened a democracy activist in Boston. However, there are limited incentives to report such activity or protections for those who do so, particularly for foreign students and visitors who intend to return to China or have close family living in China. Many of the prominent stories of China’s transnational harassment focus on a few vocal activists. Yet there is ample evidence that these high-profile examples account for a small amount of the intimidation and suppression of free speech and academic freedom that often goes unreported out of fear of consequences for oneself and one’s family. Moreover, Chinese diaspora populations — rather than Chinese government entities — are often heavily involved in harassing and threatening other members of the diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi Jinping and the CCP have repeatedly and clearly expressed a belief that their rules legitimately extend to Chinese citizens wherever they reside or travel. Identifying the right mechanisms to deter such behavior, through a combination of punishment, awareness, and policy, is a key challenge for Western democracies to uphold the tenets of freedom of expression and to protect their sovereignty from Chinese aggression and authoritarianism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective examples of a strong defense is the growing opposition to Confucius Institutes. By 2009, there were 90 Confucius Institutes housed at U.S. universities — including prestigious institutions such as Columbia, Stanford, and the University of Chicago — and a total of 440 across the globe. But the Confucius Institutes quickly became a lightning rod for controversy. At the University of Chicago, more than 100 professors signed a petition calling on the university to terminate its contract with Hanban. Bruce Lincoln, the Caroline E. Haskell distinguished service professor of the history of religions at the University of Chicago, helped lead the charge, arguing that the institute was a potentially dangerous “sort of arrangement where an entity outside the university . . . is in effect seriously influencing who’s teaching and what’s taught under our name and inside our curriculum.” By 2023, Confucius Institutes had largely disappeared on U.S. college and university campuses, with only a dozen remaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, China has shifted to other programs, such as the Thousand Talents Plan, to recruit experts in science and technology. Some academics, such as Charlie Lieber, chair of Harvard University’s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, were arrested and convicted in connection with lying to federal authorities about affiliation with the Thousand Talents Plan. Other countries, such as Canada, have also expressed alarm at China’s attempts to infiltrate universities and other institutions through the Thousand Talents Plan and other programs. As the Canadian Security Intelligence Service concluded: “Foreign talent recruitment programs are used to advance the economic and strategic objectives of foreign states at the expense of Canada’s national interests. The Thousand Talents Plan is an example of academic talent plans that are used to advance foreign states’ interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, the United States can take several steps to strengthen defense against Chinese political warfare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toughen Cyber Resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; The Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cyber Infrastructure and Security Agency, which sits within the Department of Homeland Security, have made tremendous strides building consensus around strengthening cyber defenses within the U.S. government and in the private sector. But more dramatic action will be necessary to incentivize — and perhaps regulate — better cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Federal Counterintelligence Resources:&lt;/strong&gt; Boost FBI, DOJ, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) resources to conduct Chinese counterintelligence operations against the MSS, MPS, PLA, United Front Work Department, and other organizations. The FBI is particularly swamped with Chinese counterintelligence cases, according to CSIS discussions with the FBI. The FBI should be given additional resources to hire more counterintelligence agents and intelligence analysts, including Mandarinproficient personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expand State and Local Counterintelligence Activities:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a growing need to supplement U.S. federal efforts by expanding state and local efforts. New Jersey, for example, has stepped up counterintelligence efforts under the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness. The Analysis Bureau in New Jersey has devoted greater resources to analyzing Chinese intelligence and disinformation activities, including through cooperation with the FBI. The Analysis Bureau has also added a critical infrastructure analysis section to analyze Chinese and other foreign threats and advocate for better operational security practices. New Jersey has also distributed its products to local law enforcement agencies and the general public to increase awareness. These efforts should be widespread across states.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Declassify Intelligence Analysis: There is an urgent need to increase public awareness of the Chinese threat to the U.S. homeland by declassifying more information and analysis from the U.S. intelligence community, FBI, DHS, Department of State, Department of Defense, and Department of Treasury. There have been some useful examples, such as the National Intelligence Council’s declassified “Cyber Operations Enabling Expansive Digital Authoritarianism.” But these cases are few and far between. In the 1980s, for instance, the CIA and FBI released a range of intelligence products on Soviet political warfare as part of congressional hearings. Along these lines, Congress can play an increasingly important role in raising public awareness through hearings, analytical products, and other activities — including through the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crack Down on Sensitive Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a growing urgency to mitigate the threat from China’s intelligence collection and information operations on technology platforms through a combination of executive, legislative, and judicial steps. For example, TikTok should be banned from all state and local devices — not just federal ones — because it allows China to access the devices, including information, microphones, and cameras. There is also a need to contextualize public education efforts with concrete examples of negative impacts or threats to the U.S. public. This is increasingly important because China’s irregular activities directly target citizens in the United States and other Western countries via popular online social media, gaming, and e-commerce platforms, many of which are accompanied by China’s own information campaigns that extol these platforms’ benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Private Sector Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; Intensify U.S. government interactions with corporations, educational institutions, think tanks, and other entities about China’s influence and coercive activity. Chinese influence campaigns have targeted a wide range of U.S. organizations and companies, including Hollywood movie studios and the National Basketball Association. Consequently, there is an urgent need for the FBI, DHS, and intelligence community to increase interactions with targeted institutions and to educate their personnel about evolving Chinese methods and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen FARA and Related Efforts:&lt;/strong&gt; There is a continuing need to further strengthen FARA and other efforts, including the Lobbying Disclosure Act and the Department of Education’s Section 117 disclosures, to counter Chinese and other foreign influence. Examples might include providing civil investigative demand authority to the Department of Justice, increasing penalties for non-compliance with registration requirements, and repealing or modifying FARA exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conduct-offensive-measures&quot;&gt;CONDUCT OFFENSIVE MEASURES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a letter to U.S. painter and Revolutionary War veteran John Trumbull, George Washington wrote that “offensive operations, often times, is the surest, if not the only . . . means of defence.” Political warfare with China should not only involve playing defense but also conducting offensive measures in such areas as information and cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As used here, offense refers to efforts to coerce or weaken an adversary. An offensive campaign should be based, in part, on leveraging U.S. democratic strengths and exploiting China’s weaknesses, including the vulnerabilities inherent to its attempt to suffocate political liberty, freedom of expression and the press, free-market capitalism, and freedom of religion. The fundamental goal of China’s leadership is to retain and solidify their absolute power and to eliminate any effective opposition to their authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. offensive policy toward China should focus on thwarting China’s expansionism, power, and influence as well as encouraging a more pluralistic political and economic system in China and its partners. One example of offense is in the cyber domain. The United States should have a consistently updated set of options for action and retaliation in the cyber domain. While escalation dynamics in and through the cyber domain are still up for debate, limiting activity to cyber could prove de-escalatory in a crisis. If cyber effects are predictable and damage is targeted, cyber tools can be an effective way to send a message. However, the United States and China also need to establish consistent crisis communications channels so that the two capitals can message intent effectively if a cyber operation meant to be limited and de-escalatory has unpredicted effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the United States and its partners should proactively highlight examples of China’s malign activity, human rights abuses, and corruption. Some of the best work may come from legislators, investigative journalists, academics, and corporate executives. Indeed, China has significant weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Examples include the BRI and DSR, which frequently aim to control information in ways that benefit China, burden foreign countries (including with debt), and rely on Chinese labor rather than local workers. China’s goal is generally to force governments and corporations to respect and defer to Chinese interests in current and future actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also engaged in significant human rights abuses. Examples include China’s involvement in the arrest, torture, and assassination of defectors, political opponents, and those investigating or prosecuting corruption and human rights abuses (such as journalists and lawyers). In addition, Chinese corruption and cheating scandals are pervasive. China has paid bribes to foreign officials to gain access to their country, and corruption is often critical for promotion in the CCP and military. China has also been embroiled in massive doping scandals with its athletes, including for the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the United States should consider several recommendations to strengthen the offense in light of Chinese political warfare:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weaken the Great Firewall:&lt;/strong&gt; The United States needs to increase resources and support to programs that provide technological and other assistance to individuals and organizations inside and outside China to break through the Great Firewall. These programs should include U.S. government agencies — such as the State Department, Defense Department, and intelligence community — as well as nongovernmental organizations and the private sector. Populations generally want access to other sources of news, not just information from state-controlled media.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a Multilateral Bloc to Counter Chinese Economic Coercion:&lt;/strong&gt; Combating and deterring Chinese economic coercion will likely require a collective effort by the United States, Australia, South Korea, Japan, and other countries — including in Europe. Participant countries should be prepared to sanction China in response to Chinese threats or actions that do not conform to World Trade Organization rules and are aimed at meeting Chinese political goals unrelated to trade. In addition, participant countries could create a collective compensation fund for losses and offer alternative export or import markets to divert trade in response to Chinese sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Private Sector Competitiveness in Emerging Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop a public-private partnership designed to compete more effectively with China in emerging technology in such areas as the Global South. As noted in this report, China has developed an aggressive strategy to spread Chinese technology through the DSR. The United States and allied and partner governments should develop a coordinated approach to support U.S. and allied companies that seek to compete in these same regions, such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish a U.S. Inter-Agency Body to Coordinate Offensive Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. government’s China policy is still stovepiped across such areas as diplomacy, defense, economics, and intelligence. The National Security Council should create a body that coordinates strategy and operations across U.S. government agencies designed to identify Chinese vulnerabilities and exploit them. The United States needs to proactively weaken Chinese power, influence, and relationships overseas. There are several models from the Cold War that are worth examining, such as the Active Measures Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actions will not be easy. China will respond aggressively and fiercely to any campaign designed to undermine its authoritarianism and exploit the vulnerabilities in its political and economic systems. Chinese leaders may threaten its critics, including by withholding money to — or conducting offensive cyberattacks and other actions against — corporations, educational institutions, think tanks, and other individuals and organizations. Chinese citizens and their families may be intimidated, imprisoned, tortured, or even killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offensive operations will also require leveraging defectors, émigrés, and dissidents from China — including intellectuals and scientists — for information campaigns. Soviet and Eastern European defectors and dissidents were an important tool in political warfare during the Cold War and a critical source of information. Their testimonies were helpful in constructing powerful, emotional, and truthful narratives that undermined the Soviet Union and its ideology. Defectors such as Stanislav Levchenko and Ladislav Bittman also provided critical insights into how active measures worked and how to fight back. The United States needs to find opportunities to effectively identify and exploit defectors and dissidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political warfare involves taking risks. In some cases, as with the CIA’s covert support to Poland’s Solidarity during the 1980s, codenamed QRHELPFUL, those risks paid off by weakening the Soviet Union and its partners. But in other cases, such as in Iran and Guatemala, the United States made significant mistakes that ran contrary to its democratic principles. Because of these risks, some U.S. officials will strongly resist engaging in offensive activities that attempt to exploit China’s weaknesses and vulnerabilities. While it is important to weigh the pros and cons of specific actions, the United States would never have succeeded in undermining Soviet power and influence without taking risks that exploited its adversary’s vulnerabilities. The same is true for China moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-multilateral-approach&quot;&gt;A MULTILATERAL APPROACH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effective strategy against Chinese political warfare requires the assistance of U.S. partners. For example, Australia blocked the purchase of Huawei 5G telecommunications gear for its national network and was an outspoken critic of China’s human rights abuses and anti-democratic practices. But the threat from China against U.S. partners is likely to be persistent. As a report by the UK’s Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament concluded, “China’s size, ambition and capability have enabled it to successfully penetrate every sector of the UK’s economy, and — until the Covid-19 pandemic — Chinese money was readily accepted by [His Majesty’s Government] with few questions asked.” In many cases, the United States will need to train, advise, and assist state and non-state actors across the globe to balance against China — and to work by, with, and through its partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States can build from existing arrangements, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (or Quad, which includes Japan, Australia, India, and the United States); treaty alliances with Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand; defense relationships with Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam, and other countries; and the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) partnership. Another example is the Minerals Security Partnership, which includes Australia, Canada, the European Union, Finland, France, Japan, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. This partnership aims to bolster and safeguard the supply of nickel, cobalt, lithium, copper, and rare-earth metals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Chinese economic coercion, the United States and its partners in the Indo-Pacific should also develop a new strategy of “collective resilience.” Key countries, such as Australia, Japan, the United States, and South Korea, should be prepared to cut off — and threaten to cut off — China’s access to vital goods when Beijing acts against any member. The goal should be to deter Chinese predatory activity and compel Beijing to stop if it does conduct economic coercion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more effective U.S. and partner strategy needs to begin with a recognition that competition with China is inescapable. The authoritarianism and illiberalism at the root of China’s political and economic system is antithetical to Western Enlightenment values. Competition is, to a great extent, a struggle over ideologies and systems. Much is at stake, including the shape, make-up, and power of political norms, the international trading system, multilateral security organizations, and international institutions. China is vulnerable to a strategy that exploits the weaknesses of its authoritarian government at home and abroad by encouraging democratic reforms, opening up financial markets, and undermining the state’s control of information. Such a strategy requires playing better defense and offense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that cooperation is impossible or even unpalatable. Competition and cooperation are not zero-sum. China will hopefully remain an important trading partner in the future and a critical market for U.S. and multinational companies. China’s economy is growing, its manufacturing sector is the largest in the world by a wide margin, its population of 1.4 billion is an attractive market for U.S. companies, and it boasts 400 million millennials — five times as many as the United States. China and the United States also share common interests in climate change, nonproliferation, global energy markets, counterterrorism, trade, and other areas. Not all competition is bad. Athletes, companies, spelling bee contestants, students, and even universities compete with each other. Healthy competition can benefit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and other democratic countries should ultimately take solace that democracy — with all its flaws and inconsistencies — is still an enviable form of government. As Winston Churchill remarked: “Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or allwise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.” Churchill’s words are a helpful reminder that the United States’ democratic principles are its strongest weapons against Chinese political warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uik8vCJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（1日）踏入審訊第96天。人民力量前主席陳志全今開始作供，就人力曾發文稱各方如望進行真正初選，應定出「共同政治行動綱領」及在議會制衡政府的「一致行動守則」，如能成事人力會樂意參與。陳解釋「共同政治行動綱領」一詞人力很早已使用，指人力以往不參與傳統民主派的選舉協調，甚至與之「對選」，原因就是「我哋根本同佢（民主派）冇共同政治行動綱領」；又指有人以為民主派取得36席「實贏」，但關鍵在於民主派當選後有否一致行動守則，盡責開會投票，惟陳指曾試過早上8時半準時開會，只有他一個面對十幾個建制派，批評過去民主派作為少數派，「竟然出席率係差過建制派」，亦「各自為政」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指他最終參與初選，非因滿意已定出上述綱領和守則，但不參與或會變成選民「不投」的對象。陳又強調，提到「共同政治行動綱領」時絕無綑綁無差別否決預算案之意，指過往任議員均會視乎提出的訴求、預算案內容及民意決定如何投票，「絕無可能係未見到份財政預算案就話或者要求人一齊去做呢樣嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳志全開始作供-稱曾兩任新東立會議員創辦大愛同盟&quot;&gt;陳志全開始作供 稱曾兩任新東立會議員、創辦大愛同盟&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍昨作供完畢，今由同參選新東的人民力量前主席、前立法會議員陳志全作供，陳身穿白裇衫和灰色西褲宣誓，接受大律師馬維騉主問。陳同意，他於香港出生、長大，於香港中文大學畢業後成為電台節目主持，曾與譚得志主持節目《馬路之友》。辯方指他因此節目取名「慢必」，陳則指在此前他與譚已取名「慢必」和「快必」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 人民力量前主席、前立法會議員 陳志全&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳同意，於2012年成為新界東立法會議員，其後出櫃，並加入了政制事務委員會的消除歧視性小眾諮詢小組，解釋是由政制及內地事務局負責，因該局其中一個職能就是促進香港人權狀況，包括性小眾權益，當時該局的副局長亦是該小組成員。陳亦確認是大愛同盟其中一個創辦者，該組織於2013年創立，目的是促進香港性小眾權益和教育，創辦人包括何韻詩、黃耀明、趙式芝及時任立法會議員何秀蘭。陳其後於2016年連任立會議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱有意連任-指做議員初心是推進性傾向歧視條例立法&quot;&gt;陳稱有意連任 指做議員「初心」是推進性傾向歧視條例立法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續問，曾聽過陳志全被讚為最勤力議員，甚至獲時任立法會主席讚賞，問陳認為該說法是否公允，陳說「其實我自己係受之有愧嘅，因為做一份工⋯⋯」，惟法官李運騰打斷，指屬傳聞證供，陳仲衡亦說區諾軒已說過相關證據，為何要證人本人再次確認，辯方續就下一議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問是否打算參與2020年立法會選舉，陳指他曾任兩屆議員，「我係一直都係諗住再最少做多一屆議員」，解釋政府承諾的性傾向歧視條例立法，「搞咗成十幾年，連一個公眾諮詢都冇」，「所以呢個都係我好主打嘅、或者參選做議員嘅其中一個初心」，「我都係諗住去連任，希望喺呢個重要議題上，喺我能力範圍內幫手有啲推進。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱獲區諾軒告知新東首會議-僅派助理出席因對初選籌備唔係好緊張&quot;&gt;陳稱獲區諾軒告知新東首會議 僅派助理出席因對初選籌備「唔係好緊張」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全續指，在2020年1、2月左右，聽到戴耀廷提議辦初選的消息，解釋他是立法會議員，亦是D100網台主持，會將新聞消息作為節目題材，故特別留意政情專欄、即政客八卦新聞，當時有提及有人構思搞初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳並指，其後從區諾軒正式知道有初選的籌備，解釋九東最先辦協調會議，而時任人力副主席譚得志在九東「做咗好多功夫」，大家也知他有興趣參選九東，故九東第一次會議前，區諾軒曾發 WhatsApp 訊息給陳，指「九龍東嗰班友想開會，想搵快必咁樣」，並指他曾發訊息予譚得志但無回覆，故問陳譚得志有否收到訊息。陳其後問譚，譚稱有收過區的訊息，「之後就佢哋自己聯絡。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 譚得志（左）、陳志全（右）（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，區當時沒有邀請他參與初選，亦沒提過其他區有協調會議，而他是於4月頭由區發訊息告知4月14日有首次新東協調會議。陳指當天是星期二，但他逢周二晚上7時半到8時半要在數碼港「D100」網台做節目。陳續笑說：「不過老實講，就算我得閒呢，我都未必會去嘅，因為我對於初選呢個籌備呢，其實唔係好緊張」，故最後也是派助理代表出席，叫他去「聽吓」，「有咩嘢就返嚟話畀我知啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱九東第二次會議後有傳人力反初選反得最犀利-曾發文澄清&quot;&gt;陳稱九東第二次會議後有傳人力「反初選反得最犀利」 曾發文澄清&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，但此前陳志全得悉譚得志在九東會議的討論內容嗎？陳說「其實呢到到而家我都唔係好搞得清楚，譚得志去過幾多次協調會，甚至佢有冇去過協調會，我問返啲人，個個嘅版本都唔同嘅」，但九東第二次會議曾發生了一些事，被政情專欄報導，陳其後有主動理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示第二次九東協調會議數日後，人民力量於3月22日的 Facebook 帖文〈人民力量贊成有共同政治行動綱領的初選〉。陳解釋第二次九東會議後，《蘋果日報》刊出一篇政壇八卦新聞，提及人民力量在會上「反對初選反對得最犀利」。陳指該次會議最終決定不辦初選，用選前民調的棄選機制，但該報導會令人覺得「係人民力量喺度搞破壞，搞到九東搞唔成初選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳認為是有份開會人士「放料」予記者，想誤導記者或公眾人民力量「唔支持初選，入去開會係搞局」，而因這些政壇八卦多人流傳討論，他為免以訛傳訛和日後可能有人以此消息攻擊人民力量，故與有份開會的人力成員劉嘉鴻指「不如出返篇文去講返事實出嚟」。陳並指以他所知，譚得志當日無去開會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱人力過往不參與協調甚至與民主派對選-甚至被稱民建聯b隊&quot;&gt;陳稱人力過往不參與協調甚至與民主派對選 甚至被稱「民建聯B隊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問「共同政治行動綱領」的意思，陳指「其實呢個詞語呢，人民力量好早期已經用㗎喇」，指人力的成立「都係對傳統民主派嘅不滿，所以先至有呢班人走埋一齊，去成立呢個組織」，過去也「比較少同民主派合作」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，民主派過去每逢有選舉，不論立法會或區議會也會想做協調，而人民力量「早期唔單止冇參與，甚至乎會主動同現有民主派議員係對選嘅，民主派仲會話我哋係『民建聯B隊』」。陳解釋若有民主派和建制派參選，而人力派第三人去選，自然會分薄民主派得票令其落選。陳補充，記得民主黨2012年「仲喺選舉論壇話我係『人民幣力量』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，當時不與民主派協調甚至「對選」，說法就是「我哋根本同佢冇共同政治行動綱領」，例如人力反對「小圈子選舉」，但當時民主黨就支持時任特首曾蔭權的政改方案，增加5席超級區議會。此時法官陳仲衡打斷，指辯方只是要求陳就「共同政治行動綱領」一詞解釋，又指法庭程序並非電台節目，雖然沒有時限，但也應集中在相關事項。馬維騉表示明白，「讓我叫停我當事人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指與民主派根本無共同政治行動綱領&quot;&gt;陳指與民主派根本無共同政治行動綱領&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，因此簡言之，人民力量與民主派並無「共同政治行動綱領」？陳說「係，我簡單用三句講埋佢啦⋯⋯即係當啲民主派攻擊我哋，話我哋又唔協調又唔同佢哋初選、甚至同佢哋對選，我哋嗰陣時嘅答覆就係話，我同你都冇共同行動綱領，咁我會唔會同民建聯工聯會初選吖？」，指這也是答覆民主派和公眾的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳同意於3月24日的《人民主場》節目，再重申人民力量支持有共同政治行動綱領的初選，解釋因兩日前的回應帖文無人看也無甚回應，記者亦無跟進。陳一度稱：「我哋 expect 咁起碼你《蘋果日報》寫嗰個記者都應該要出返篇文或者打個電話嚟問吓我哋」，但終卻「唔負責任，由佢自己發酵」。陳慶偉着陳仔細聆聽律師問題，盡可能用簡單的語言直接作答，又指用中文作供其中一個好處就是有更多時間可以思考。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指期許民主派有一致行動守則積極參與議會-惟批民主派出席率差過建制派&quot;&gt;陳指期許民主派有一致行動守則、積極參與議會 惟批民主派出席率差過建制派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後再問及「共同政治行動綱領」的意思，陳補充上述帖文提到「人民力量重申，如各方希望進行真正初選，應努力思考並定出共同政治綱領及在議會制衡政府的一致行動守則」，當中「一致行動守則」是指做議員「一啲好基本嘅紀律操守」，因「有啲人以為你攞到嗰個議席，譬如36席，咁你就實贏喇咁樣」，但陳認為這只是停留在理論層面，關鍵在於這班議員「有冇一致嘅行動守則」。陳又舉例有證人指不用36席，其實取得30、33席也足以予建制派或政府很大壓力，翻查資料，此說法來自何桂藍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，「呢度唔係講話要贊成或者否決某一條特別嘅法例或者撥款」，而是「究竟嗰個議員係咪盡責，佢係咪去開會、係咪會坐足個會、係咪投票會喺度、係咪會加入盡量多嘅委員會，呢個就係我一向所謂對民主派嘅一個期許」。陳續指：「我舉一個好簡單嘅例子，我做咗八年議員，當你試過朝早8點半開會返到去會議室嘅時候，得你一個民主派係準時，面對住十幾個建制派嘅時候⋯⋯建制派係多數派，蔣麗芸一個都入十幾個事務委員會，民主派嘅議員竟然可以入得嗰三四個委員會。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指有幾多議席是一回事是否積極開會和有紀律是另一回事&quot;&gt;陳指有幾多議席是一回事、是否積極開會和有紀律是另一回事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，立法會出席率是「最寬鬆」，三日的會議「你一坐落去點一個名就係出席咗」，但「民主派作為少數派，竟然出席率係差過建制派，最尾嗰十個出席率最低，有七個係民主派議員」，「所以你有幾多席係一回事，你係咪積極去開會、係咪有紀律係另一回事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，「投票係隨時會投㗎」，當一個人發言完畢、無第二個人起身發言就會投票，「如果你唔喺立法會或者你出咗去做第二啲嘢嘅時候，就算你係多個人或者少個人，你都係投唔到嗰一票」。陳仲衡問，故「行動守則」只是指出席率？陳指是「對議會嘅積極參與程度，出席率只不過係其中一個最低嘅反映」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又指，民主派過去各自為政，「我連要求四大版塊（即民主黨、公民黨、專業議政及議會陣線），每個版塊有一個人準時開會得唔得呀，都做唔到，咁講乜嘢抗爭」，又指有多少議席「係一個數」，「但係你係咪去每一日要同政府個角力，畀到壓力政府慢慢逐步逐步增加，都要靠你議會嘅參與，係咪嗰個積極先至能夠做到㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉問，故陳提及的責任、出席率等就是「共同政治行動綱領」？陳指那些是「一致行動守則」，亦指當然要建基於此守則，所謂共同政治綱領才會有意思。陳仲衡問，但初選最後有否就出席率達成協議？陳指沒有，指他根本無出席過協調會議，亦無在會上提出其要求，而他對民主派「比較勤力積極參與發言、提修正案、準時投票、唔好甩咁多轆」的要求，是一直以來都有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指對初選有好大期望-不代表不符期望就不參加-否則變成不投的對象&quot;&gt;陳指對初選有好大期望 不代表不符期望就不參加 否則變成「不投」的對象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉打斷陳發言，笑言明白他對政府、民主派和建制派有很多不滿，但認為陳最終要說的是初選要先定出共同政治行動綱領和一致行動守則，否則就沒有意義，指他明白這點。李運騰續問，帖文提到「如果能夠成事，人民力量非常樂意參與一個完全以陣營為先、派別為後作基調的初選基制」，而陳最終有參與初選，即是說他當時認為初選已做到該兩點，即有「共同政治行動綱領」和「一致行動守則」？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳答「並唔係」，並指「我對初選有一個好大嘅期望，但係唔代表佢符合唔到我期望，我就唔參加，有時好多嘢現實唔係話要符合到期望我先至去參與」，陳續舉例「你睇到我哋喺會（第二次九東協調會）裡面理性討論講利弊，話其實民調棄選（機制）已經OK達到個效果，已經畀人攻擊，如果我話『唉你冇共同綱領冇行動守則』就唔參加，咁我咪變咗不投（呼籲不要投票）嘅對象囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱絕不無差別否決預算案亦不會如此要求人-指過往均以3原則考慮投票&quot;&gt;陳稱絕不無差別否決預算案亦不會如此要求人 指過往均以3原則考慮投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續問，陳志全使用「共同政治行動綱領」等字眼時，是綑綁所有立法會議員不論預算案內容也無差別否決預算案嗎？陳以響亮聲線回答：「絕無此意，我自己唔會咁做，亦都唔會咁要求人」，並解釋過去任議員8年都是看到預算案後，再以3個原則判斷是支持還是反對，包括提出的訴求，如過去人力與社民連提出「全民退休保障」、人力提出「全民直接回水」；其次是要看到預算案條目內容再去研究；第三是看當時民意，「所以絕無可能係未見到份財政預算案就話或者要求人去一齊做呢樣嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yAfprsQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（1日）踏入審訊第96天。陳志全繼續作供，確認無出席新東協調會議，並認為「墨落無悔」聲明「冇乜問題」遂簽署，理解聲明無綑綁否決預算案，亦指否決財案是議員其中一項權力，當然可用來要求政府回應五大訴求。陳亦理解協調會議共識不涉否決財案，並認為「會」或「積極」否決分別不大，舉例政府無論說「會」或「會積極」考慮，「其實都係唔會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就宣傳片段提到如有35+便可令特首下台等，陳解釋片段重點是「35-」而非「35+」，坦言認為能取35席機會好微，若不停講就如予選民「empty promise（空頭支票）」；又指如有「35+」其實「大晒」、「使唔使我做都冇所謂」，但反而「35-」就需更多「有紀律」和「實幹型」的議員，故他在片中是「sell」業績。陳又指，縱35+機會微仍提可否決預算案等，是因當時社會瀰漫很大無力感，望對峙此無力感，鼓勵選民投票。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳確認無出席新東協調會議-由助理蘇浩出席匯報情況&quot;&gt;陳確認無出席新東協調會議 由助理蘇浩出席匯報情況&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全繼續作供，同意兩次新東會議均無親身出席，並派助理蘇浩出席。辯方大律師馬維騉展示人民力量執委會2020年5月13日的會議紀錄，出席者包括陳志全、譚得志和蘇浩，當中提到「有關各區的初選機制，新東原本用最嚴謹的方式，報名前已選定名單，但由於其他區用寬鬆的初選機制，新界東的初選機制可能有改變，包括由『會運用否決財政預算案』轉為『積極運用否決財政預算案』」。陳指是由蘇浩匯報兩次新東會議情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;人民力量會議紀錄稱新東最嚴謹其他區較寛鬆&quot;&gt;人民力量會議紀錄稱新東最嚴謹、其他區較寛鬆&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早前有證供指新東討論目標議席是「6」或「6+1」，被問如何理解「新東原本用最嚴謹的方式，報名前已選定名單」，陳指「因為新東其實喺9席裡面攞到6席已經係奇蹟嚟㗎喇」，故認為新東目標議席應是6席就「冇乜好拗嘅」，而其他區或有不同處理方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，所以對陳來說，「6+1」是幻想？陳志全提高了聲線：「真係簡直係痴線呀！因為6（席）已經係奇蹟嚟㗎喇，新界西呢係4（席）呀，建制派5（席）呀」，陳續加快語速：「即係我當時諗喂你唔好以為你識協調你識棄保，人哋建制派都識協調，人哋嗰個機器仲精密過你、個棄保仲精密過你，你點可能對6以外有任何痴心妄想，6都已經係唔穩陣㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問何謂「棄保」，是指棄選替補？陳指不是，解釋是當建制派發現取不到一定數量議席，就會放棄最後一個名單，「譬如佢琴日打嚟話要投鄧家彪，佢知道鄧家彪贏唔到喇，佢聽日就打嚟叫你唔好投鄧家彪，投容海恩啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳民主派新東取6席為奇蹟難保持其他區亦難複製&quot;&gt;陳：民主派新東取6席為「奇蹟」難保持、其他區亦難複製&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指對該句仍不太明白，陳同意，指「其實我睇返都係有啲唔係好明嘅，啲文字唔係寫得好清楚」，指新東最「嚴謹」可能指目標為6席並派6隊出選，而其他區較「寬鬆」可能指目標議席3席，但初選可選5隊。陳並指就「嚴謹」與「寬鬆」的形容，與該段後半談及「會運用」和「積極運用」權力否決預算案無關，屬「兩件事」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續同意，6席是「好難得先能夠得到嘅結果」，並確認2016至2020年新東民主派取得6席。李運騰指他不明白，即當時奇蹟已發生？陳用力點頭：「係。」陳慶偉說，故陳的意思是泛民要保持6席是非常困難？陳說：「保持又難，其他區想複製都好難。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱認為會或積極差別不大-以政府為例指都係唔會&quot;&gt;陳稱認為「會」或「積極」差別不大 以政府為例指「都係唔會」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問到紀錄上提到新東「會運用（權力）否決財政預算案」或轉為「積極運用」，陳指蘇浩匯報時稱會上有此討論，但無說「一定要去咁樣做嘅」，因陳也無授權過蘇在會上「應承任何嘢」。陳又指不太關注該討論，因認為兩者分別「唔係好大」，直至審訊才知當時會上原來有「所謂嘅劇烈嘅爭拗」，有人會理解「會積極運用」意思是「冇咁肯定」，「呢個係我喺法庭聽到先至諗呢樣嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又表示，庭上聽到「加咗個『積極』落去就好似冇咁肯定、程度會低咗啲」，但以他的認知，加「積極」反而表示「更加着緊去做呢件事」，舉例以往政府講「會積極考慮」時就像「行多咗一步仔咁」。不過陳補充以他的經驗，「無論政府話『會』、『會積極』或者『會考慮』呢，其實都係唔會嘅」，如反性傾向歧視條例立法。陳慶偉指這取決於情況，如政府說會為公務員加薪，相信公務員不會認為政府不會加他們薪，但表示理解陳的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰關注，會議紀錄意思是否指原本已決定「會運用」，之後可能改為「會積極運用」，陳指當時沒有考慮這部分，因不認為是初選機制問題，他只關注目標議席是否由6席變為6+1。陳志全亦不同意陳仲衡指這是關於「共同政治行動綱領」，因不是約束大家當選之後如何投票；並同意李運騰指文件有含糊之處，但他並無尋求澄清。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，記得與會者都應無出席九東第三次協調會議，而人民力量亦沒有派人去新界西參選和出席新西協調會議，但事後梁家聲「就話自己八卦去咗睇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指從何桂藍fb看到墨落聲明冇咩問題遂與譚得志簽署&quot;&gt;陳指從何桂藍FB看到「墨落」聲明、「冇咩問題」遂與譚得志簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」聲明，馬維騉問陳志全有否簽署，陳大聲肯定答：「有」，解釋6月10日晚「碌 Facebook」時看到何桂藍發布的「墨落」聲明，他看到兩點聲明後覺得「冇咩特別」、「冇咩大嘅問題」，遂問譚得志是否簽署，譚說簽，他遂將聲明複製至其 Facebook 發布，譚並稱找人民力量義工幫手製圖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬問及 Facebook 的操作，陳續解釋他們這些「政治人」多數有兩個 Facebook 專頁，一是個人 Facebook，一是 Facebook 專頁，個人帳戶會加朋友，但專頁帳戶是「follow 就睇到」。陳慶偉一度問：「By『專頁』，you mean professional（專業）？」有旁聽人士發笑，陳仲衡再問陳志全是否指「專業」，陳志全說：「唔係，一頁書一頁書嗰個『頁』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳指否決是議員權力-當然可運用叫政府回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;陳指否決是議員權力 當然可運用叫政府回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就聲明的「我認同『五大訴求，缺一不可』」，陳指相信當時絕大部分民主派支持者或政治人物都認同五大訴求；至於「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，陳指覺得大部分支持者都會認同，「當我係議員嘅時候，我當然要盡我嘅努力去令政府去回應五大訴求啦」，而由於否決財案是立法會議員其中一項權力，「咁當然我哋可以去運用呢個權力，去叫政府回應五大訴求啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於聲明第二點「我認同若支持度跌出預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」，陳指認為這點反而更加重要，因當時已有人質疑民主派「乜嘢都冇承諾過」，可能「初選輸咗但係都唔認數繼續參選」，惟陳認為此質疑對整個民主派並非一件好或健康的事，會導致選民猶豫「係咪真係出嚟投票」，而有人做此聯署，正可回應此問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳認為墨落無綑綁議員一致否決財案35目標是努力爭取回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;陳認為「墨落」無綑綁議員一致否決財案、35+目標是努力爭取回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於聲明提到「已取得共識的共同綱領」，陳指當時兩次協調會議均無出席，是按有出席的助理蘇浩匯報情況去理解，共識即是辦初選、議席數目、替補機制和辦論壇。馬維騉問有否綑綁議員一致否決預算案，陳指由於他被告知的兩次新東會議內並無這回事，故對該段文字亦無此理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於提名表格提到「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，陳指對該點理解同樣建基其助理的匯報，即會辦公民投票、新界東目標議席是6席、替補機制用靈童制、及辦論壇，至於「目標」就是「我哋如果當選咗議員，就要努力爭取要政府回應五大訴求囉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳認35機會微不停講為empty-promise-競選重點在35-非35&quot;&gt;陳認「35+」機會微、不停講為empty promise 競選重點在「35-」非「35+」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後播放人民力量的初選競選影片〈快慢對對話〉，片中陳志全與譚得志談及35+，陳提及：「35+當然係好啦，主席又係我哋，咩惡法都可以反對反對反對，大白象工程又反對反對反對，跟住反對埋財政預算案、解散立法會、特首都要下台」，馬維騉問陳為何這樣說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指影片是競選宣傳短片，片中譚得志提到大家對「35+」有期望，問陳「咁35-又點呢？」，他才有上述回答。陳並指雖然初選主軸是「35+」，但影片宗旨並不是想講「35+」，而是講「35-」，因他對「35+」能否實現有很大懷疑，「甚至坦白講我覺得能夠攞到35席嘅機會係好微」，故無論是宣傳街站或是拍短片，人力雖會提及「35+」，但重點不在「35+」，而是「35-」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳競選sell業績-因35-需實幹型議員&quot;&gt;陳：競選「sell業績」 因「35-」需實幹型議員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指將重點放在「35-」有兩個原因，首先他認為「35+」的可能性不算大，「你如果不停去講、或者講得太勁嘅嘅時候，你好似畀緊一個 empty promise（空頭支票）、一個唔能夠落實嘅願景俾啲選民。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其次他指很多人在初選「sell 嗰個願景，未來如果可以有35+可以點點點」，「但我 sell 嘅呢，係業績」，故影片主要講述自己過去做過什麼，「因為其實35+呢你大晒、你做乜都得，你開會又得唔開會又得，你話一聲到時否決咩，就好似好勁咁，所以如果35+呢，其實駛唔駛我做都冇所謂，你做、你做、佢做都得，最後就係投嗰一票」，陳邊說邊指向法官、律師度和被告席方向，續說：「反而35-呢，就需要更多有紀律同埋實幹型嘅議員。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳提35可否決財案乃鼓勵選民投票-對峙無力感&quot;&gt;陳：提35+可否決財案乃鼓勵選民投票 對峙無力感&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，雖認為35+可能性很微，但在宣傳片和街站仍提及，其中一個作用是要「打」這個主題出來，讓選民知道「如果你得到呢樣野，有乜嘢嘅力量可以做到」。陳續指2019至2020年，社會瀰漫一股很大的無力感，「好似做乜嘢都冇用」，「當我哋想鼓勵選民出嚟投票嘅時候，就要對峙佢呢一種無力感」，告訴選民如果有「35+」，「我哋有ABCD咁樣嘅選擇、或者有啲咁樣嘅能力」，希望選民會覺得「議會有用、投票有用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問到，那為何陳要提及否決財政預算案，解散立會及使特首下台。陳志全解釋這是向選民列舉「35+」可以做到的事情，「成個進展解釋一次畀大家去知道」，目的是鼓勵選民出來投票，「但係唔係話我會咁做」，整條片重心亦不在此。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vkfWnUg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（1日）踏入審訊第96天。陳志全繼續作供，就立法會選舉延期後，議員獲延任一年但他選擇不留任，陳解釋因只獲選民授權任4年議員，亦對民主派失望。陳指，當時去留爭議只從理論上指留任「有點好」，卻無民主派議員願出來承認「我哋以前做得唔夠好」，並承諾留任後會盡最大努力做好議員職責，陳自言當時「我真係有好大嘅無力感同埋無心戀戰」，故選擇不留任。陳又一度指「我嘅惡夢係，你哋話留任，我陪你留」，但到了早上8點半鐘開會，又「得我一個對住十幾個建制派」，陳指如萬一他也遲到，「真係冇經審議就可以過好多議案嘅撥款。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就何桂藍早前稱曾邀請陳志全出席抗爭派記者會但「食檸檬」，陳解釋當時理解是抗爭派「祝捷會」，因不覺與他們同一派系，故無想過出席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指現身何桂藍街站-陳解釋與黃耀明何韻詩打招呼&quot;&gt;官指現身何桂藍街站 陳解釋與黃耀明何韻詩打招呼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳志全繼續作供，就何桂藍上周播放初選投票首日於大圍街站的片段，法官陳慶偉一度指看到陳志全。陳今解釋，當日他也在大圍火車站另一邊開街站籲市民投票，看到該處有很多記者，得悉是何桂藍見記者，而「大愛同盟」的共同創辦人黃耀明和何韻詩亦在場。陳指當時心想，「佢哋見緊記者我就唔好過去騷擾佢哋，費事啲人話我係攝石人」，而後來以為已見完記者就走過去與二人打招呼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳稱認為抗爭派記者會是祝捷會-不認為屬同派系故無想過去&quot;&gt;陳稱認為抗爭派記者會是祝捷會 不認為屬同派系故無想過去&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於7月15日抗爭派記者會，何桂藍早前稱曾邀陳志全出席但「食檸檬」，陳今指何提及「我請佢食檸檬嗰時呢，其實我係印象好模糊，唔係好記得呢一幕」。陳續說「我就唔記得何桂藍有冇叫過我喇」，但記得朱凱廸曾問他是否出席該記者會，他當時亦拒絕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sQgtSVl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年7月15日 抗爭派記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡追問，陳是沒有空抑或不想去？陳說按其認知，「嗰個係抗爭派嘅祝捷會嚟嘅，因為佢哋喺初選度佢哋係覺得自己大勝啦」，有份出席的余慧明掩嘴發笑。陳續說：「咁我唔覺得我同佢哋係同一個派系，所以佢哋一個祝捷會，我就冇諗過會去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;人大宣布議員延任一年-陳不主張留任因對民主派議員失望&quot;&gt;人大宣布議員延任一年 陳：不主張留任因對民主派議員失望&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續確認，他7月27日收到選舉主任提問，翌日回覆後，政府便於7月31日宣布選舉延期，直至當時選舉主任仍未就其提名是否有效作出裁決。其後人大常委會於8月11日宣布現任立法會議員延任一年，但陳於同年9月28日通知立法會秘書處，9月30日任期屆滿之後不會延任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳解釋拒絕延任有兩個原因，其一是他覺得他參加2016年立法會選舉時，選民只授權他做一屆四年任期，如他在9月30日之後的時間延任「我係冇得到選民嘅授權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二個原因則與他今早提及對民主派的失望有關，陳指當時社會就議員應否留任有很多爭論，當中提到去或留的好處，主張留任的人指「如果立法會冇晒民主派，咁政府咪過乜嘢都得囉」，所以認為留任有價值，然而陳自言「我係極少數話我唔係『主留派』，我係傾向唔留任嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳指當時無很廣泛地與人說，只做了一兩個訪問表示：「你哋話留低有價值嘅議員，會唔會去承諾，喺延任嘅時候你會盡你最大嘅努力去做好議員嘅職責呢？」，即他今早提及「要勤力開會、準時、積極發言」。陳續指如果當時主張留任的議員「肯出嚟講，我哋以前做得唔夠好」，並願承諾在留任的日子，會準時開會、盡能力加入所有委員會、積極發言質詢及「投票唔好甩轆」，「可能我都會再考慮留唔留。但傾咗一大餐冇人講呢一啲問題，淨係講理論上留任有點好有點好」，陳苦笑搖頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;陳無人承諾準時開會等基本嘢-有很大無力感無心戀戰&quot;&gt;陳：無人承諾準時開會等「基本嘢」 有很大無力感、無心戀戰&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續說：「我嘅惡夢係，你哋話留任，我陪你留，跟住朝早8點半鐘開會，得我一個對住十幾個建制派。如果萬一我都遲到嘅話，真係冇經審議就可以過好多議案嘅撥款」，陳再說：「因為冇人可以應承到我呢啲咁基本嘅野，喺嗰個時刻，我真係有好大嘅無力感同埋無心戀戰，你可以話。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指反對派即使在議會是少數，其功能就如一塊石頭，「唔多唔少你都可以阻到一啲唔得市民支持嘅法例或者撥款嘅通過」，也可透過質詢和辯論，令更多市民知道內情。此時法官李運騰打斷，認為陳已回答了問題，不需要陳的詳細回答，馬維騉亦指明白無需要。陳志全終指：「我簡單一句總結，就係冇人畀到承諾話留任嘅時候會盡力去開會，所以我選擇唔留任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉最後問陳，直至他2020年被捕，有否講過、或意圖予人印象他會無差別否決財政預算案，陳表示沒有。馬再問陳會否無差別否決預算案，陳稱：「我唔會喺未見到個法案或者撥款之前就話我會否決佢。」陳亦指，沒有人在任何階段要求他否決財案或同意他們如此做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;馬維騉續指，基本上已問完打算問的問題，望保留主問的權利直至明早，才正式完結主問。鄒家成難以置信地笑望林卓廷，何桂藍亦發笑。案件明早續審。另歌手黃耀明下午亦有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/OgRoqn7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arctic today is playing an increasingly prevalent role in geopolitical competition between Russia, China and the West. This is particularly evident in two maritime sub-regions: the Barents Sea (North Atlantic) and the Bering Sea (North Pacific). In addition to strategic concerns associated with geopolitical competition, these Arctic maritime domains play host to a range of issues around access to maritime resources, most notably fisheries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues stand to evolve significantly as climate change contributes to warming oceanic temperatures, shifting fish distributions and changing demand for fisheries products. In the Arctic, surface air temperatures are rising 2–4 times faster than the global average, with warming waters causing some of the most significant shifts in fish stocks globally, and marine catch potential in the Arctic increasing as the anticipated ranges of some species extend poleward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is challenging established management regimes for transboundary resources, impacting both sustainable resource management at sea and wider security relations in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-north-atlantic-and-barents-sea&quot;&gt;The North Atlantic and Barents Sea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Located north of the Norwegian and Russian mainland and adjacent to the Arctic Ocean itself, the Barents Sea is the breeding ground of the largest cod stock in the world – a critical resource for citizens of both countries. Since the 1970s, cooperation between Norway and Russia on fisheries in the Barents Sea has developed pragmatically. Often hailed as a prime example of successful co-management of shared fish stocks, this regime has withstood both the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, tensions are mounting along two axes. First, there are fears that Russia could be utilising maritime space in the Barents Sea to challenge NATO – fears rooted in an assumption that any deliberate Russian action is likely to be hybrid in form, remaining below the threshold of direct warfare or direct conflict. Recent attention has focused on the role of Russian fishing vessels in the Barents Sea, with claims from the Norwegian naval academy that between 50 and 100 of those operating in Norwegian waters could be linked to intelligence gathering activities and pose a potential security threat. In parallel, there are mounting concerns over the vulnerability of critical infrastructure such as subsea cables (particularly in the context of climate change) and the way in which fishing vessels could be used in possible disruptive action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If fisheries cooperation between Norway and Russia were to break down and Norway were to deny Russian fishers access to its waters, the potential for unintentional escalation could increase&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, fears are rising around unintentional escalation in the maritime domain. The relatively high level of military exercise activity in the North Atlantic means that the danger of accidents involving fishers, both legitimate and illegal, is real. Another potential source of unintentional escalation could stem from the exercise of Norwegian maritime police authority towards Russian citizens. The Norwegian coast guard inspects and occasionally fines Russian fishers in the Norwegian exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or the Fish Protection Zone around Svalbard, with the potential for unintentional escalation should a case take on a state-state dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The linkages between fisheries and security concerns here are thus apparent. These issues are likely to worsen as Arctic waters continue to warm. In this context, if fisheries cooperation between Norway and Russia were to break down and Norway were to deny Russian fishers access to its waters, the potential for unintentional escalation in the course of interaction between the coast guard and Russian fishing vessels could increase. Svalbard’s waters beyond 12 nautical miles are a particularly sensitive matter: Russia does not recognise Norway’s jurisdiction to inspect and arrest vessels in this area. By claiming that these are international waters, Russia can also claim that an inspection and potential subsequent arrest exceeds Norway’s authority in the area, and in turn respond with a threat to use military force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-north-pacific-and-bering-sea&quot;&gt;The North Pacific and Bering Sea&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bering Sea comprises the maritime area south of the Bering Strait, where the US and Russia share a maritime border. It is home to a range of marine species of significant economic value, many of which are vulnerable to climate change. US-Russian relations in the Bering Sea, however, have been difficult both historically and in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, the expansion of overfishing in the area prompted negotiations between the former USSR and the US on both fisheries relations and maritime boundaries. Constituting the most lucrative fisheries in North America, the pollock stock subsequently collapsed in the early 1990s after a decade of overfishing in the “donut hole”, a marine area not covered by an EEZ. In 2013, the two countries issued a joint statement on strengthening US-Russian cooperation in the Bering Sea. However, in recent years, tensions have become more acute with Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent invasion of Ukraine in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although both countries have continued operating emergency services in the Bering Strait, and emergency cooperation here has continued, an increased Russian military presence and shifting stocks due to climate change have worried some US fishers. Further, Alaska’s lucrative snow crab harvest was cancelled this year for the first time ever due to stock collapse, which scientists warn will become increasingly common with climate change. As many species seek cooler, deeper waters, they are likely to migrate beyond historical boundaries, with Russia already exploiting new fishing locations within its EEZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Challenges emerge in the Arctic context around the unclear role of Russian fishing and research vessels, and the inherent difficulties of monitoring and control at sea&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also increasingly expressed an interest in the Arctic – despite not sharing a border with the region – which has manifested itself through bilateral cooperation with Russia. In September 2022, reports that the US Coast Guard had spotted Chinese and Russian naval vessels engaged in some form of military operations off the coast of the Alaskan Aleutian islands offered another signal of increased Sino-Russian Arctic cooperation, in the aftermath of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In April 2023, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Chinese and Russian coast guards was signed in the Arctic town of Murmansk. Increased cooperation between the two countries on Arctic and ocean affairs, including fisheries, is likely to play out in the Bering Sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shifting-strategic-relationships&quot;&gt;Shifting Strategic Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, it is highly likely that strategic Arctic fisheries relations will become more sensitive for two reasons. First, key species – depending on their mobility and habitat connection – are expected to respond to climate change by shifting their distributions poleward to cooler waters. Indeed, in the Arctic, warming waters are causing some of the most significant shifts in fish stocks globally, with this and declining sea-ice coverage affecting fisheries and fishing patterns in key locations. Second, the Barents Sea and Bering Sea will increasingly play a role in strategic posturing, with NATO countries, Russia and even China showcasing their Arctic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, fisheries disputes in the region are increasingly becoming entangled in wider domestic and international politics, with an impact on dynamics in the maritime domain. Rather than being a simple matter of defining rights and ownership, when a maritime dispute reaches the political agenda in this way, domestic actors may also seek to benefit by infusing it with symbolic dimensions, such as “national pride” or “being cheated out of what is ours”. Such politicisation has become still more relevant after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenges emerge in the Arctic context around the unclear role of Russian fishing and research vessels, and the inherent difficulties of monitoring and control at sea. Indeed, the conflict potential emanating from small-scale incidents related to both legitimate and illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fisheries in the Barents Sea is greater now than it has been at any time since the end of the Cold War. Meanwhile, in the Bering Sea, increased Russian military presence, as well as military cooperation between Russia and China, will increasingly have an impact on the politicisation of fishing activities and could muster a response from the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Arctic waters continue to warm, and as climate change catalyses a range of disruptive environmental shifts in the region, it will become increasingly critical to manage these relationships sensitively to ensure sustainable resource management, including the prevention of IUU fishing. This must be done in an environment in which the traditional separation between fisheries management and the high politics of security affairs, sanctions and military signalling is eroding. In this context, the security concerns and escalatory effects inherent in fisheries relations across a warming Arctic should prompt caution, calling for careful monitoring and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;climate-change-iuu-fishing-and-illicit-finance&quot;&gt;Climate Change, IUU Fishing and Illicit Finance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sm1Zq9s.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing drains billions of dollars in the form of illicit financial flows from countries around the world. Many of these countries are among the most impacted by climate change, with many also facing debt crises and struggling to provide basic services and social protections in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Globally, it has been estimated that IUU fishing generates $50 billion in estimated annual losses, making it the third most lucrative natural resource crime after timber and mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IUU fishing is also estimated to account for up to a fifth of the global seafood catch, playing a key role in the depletion of global fish stocks. Combined with the negative impacts that climate change is having on aquatic species themselves – with global fish biomass predicted to decline by 5% for every 1 degree of global warming – the prospects are bleak if we fail to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation predicts that the maximum catch within the world’s exclusive economic zones will decrease between 2.8% and 12.1% by 2050. This situation is putting at risk millions of people’s livelihoods, especially in poor coastal communities which are the most food insecure and dependent on artisanal fishing for protein. Notably, the effects of IUU fishing and associated illicit financial flows are felt particularly across the Global South, which also covers regions that are the most affected by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-stakes-are-too-high&quot;&gt;The Stakes are too High&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent report found that nearly half of identified commercial vessels involved in IUU fishing operate in Africa, leading to economic losses in the form of illicit financial flows of up to $11.49 billion every year. Madagascar, for example, loses an estimated $80 million every year – substantial losses in a country that suffers from chronic food security issues, among other social and economic challenges. Further afield, in Argentina, losses are estimated at around $2 billion per year; in Indonesia they are estimated at $4 billion – equivalent to the country’s annual net rubber exports. Yet, to date, the global response has been inconsistent with the gravity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among numerous bodies, the High-Level Panel for the Sustainable Ocean Economy (The Ocean Panel) has identified ownership and financial secrecy as a key driver of IUU fishing, allowing the individuals responsible to evade detection. Indeed, a range of organisations have documented the use by international fishing operations of complex company and ownership structures, both to cover up illegal operations and to conceal ultimate beneficial ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, the Ocean Panel identified ownership transparency as a key part of the solution for ending IUU fishing in Africa and globally. Yet, it has found that beneficial ownership information is “rarely, if ever, collected during the licensing or vessel registration process”. Meanwhile, limited progress has been made to date on other steps to strengthen beneficial ownership transparency in order to better tackle illicit financial flows stemming from IUU fishing. Despite the direct impact IUU fishing has on global fisheries resources and associated livelihoods, IUU fishing remains largely missing from wider debates around extractive industry transparency or the design of country-based public beneficial ownership registries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The effects of IUU fishing and associated illicit financial flows are felt particularly across the Global South, which also covers regions that are the most affected by climate change&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative was launched in 2002 to facilitate the voluntary disclosure by governments and firms of the beneficial owners of extractive companies. Sadly, the initiative only targets oil, gas and mineral resources, with IUU fishing having been ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Fisheries Transparency Initiative (FiTI) highlights efforts to increase transparency around beneficial ownership, covering the importance of beneficial ownership in its Standard, which defines the information national authorities should publish online about their fisheries sectors. A number of states have signed on to the FiTI Standard. As the first country to report on its commitments, in 2020 the Seychelles passed legislation (the Beneficial Ownership Act 2020) requiring the maintenance of up-to-date registers of beneficial owners, with a central register of beneficial owners in place by 2021. Yet initiatives such as FiTI face a range of issues, not least uptake by a limited number of countries to date and the fact that it only asks countries to report on their progress in implementing public beneficial ownership registries, rather than making it a requirement of adopting the Standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – the global financial crime watchdog – has also been slow. In 2020, FATF highlighted the ways in which widespread use of shell and front companies enables the import and export of endangered wildlife products. A year later, FATF expanded its focus from illegal wildlife trade (IWT) to money laundering risks linked to illegal logging, illegal mining and waste trafficking. But disappointingly, FATF has continued to ignore IUU fishing to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of attention paid by FATF to this issue, in 2022, the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) included a chapter in its typologies report on the illicit finance dimension of IUU fishing, providing case studies and analysis that underline the industrialised nature of the issue. Other FATF-style regional bodies, however, have yet to turn their focus to IUU fishing. They have failed to follow the APG’s example despite the clear demonstration that there is no need to wait for FATF itself – particularly when the impacts of an issue such as IUU fishing are of particular concern to members (often across the Global South).This lack of widespread action comes despite the fact that the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reference natural resource crimes including fisheries crime and tax abuse in the fishing industry as contributing factors to illicit financial flows, as included in SDG target 16.4.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, the G7 Climate and Environment Ministers’ Communiqué released in May 2021 welcomed “discussions by Finance Ministers on strengthening beneficial ownership transparency to better tackle the illicit financial flows stemming from IWT and other illicit threats to nature”. Yet, again, IUU fishing was not named specifically. This is despite the fact that G7 countries account for the majority of the global seafood market, with this omission reflecting the limited political will to tackle this crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, broader trends in relation to progress on transparency of beneficial ownership could have negative implications for the fisheries sector. Notably, in November 2022, the EU Court of Justice approved a ruling that stands to stall progress by invalidating provisions of the EU’s Anti-Money Laundering Directive that allowed public access to registries detailing beneficial owners. Although it has a much wider scope than beneficial ownership in the fisheries sector, this ruling is likely to undermine progress in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financial-transparency-must-be-prioritised&quot;&gt;Financial Transparency Must be Prioritised&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With climate change heightening geopolitical tensions around fisheries in certain regions and driving changes in patterns of convergence between IUU fishing and other crimes, this failure to act on the opacity and financial secrecy enabling IUU fishing must be addressed. This is particularly urgent given that IUU fishing relies heavily on the formal financial system, making it highly susceptible to concerted action by the anti-financial crime community. Given what is at stake and the need for effective deterrents, financial transparency should now be placed at the heart of efforts to tackle IUU fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FATF must pay the same level of attention to IUU fishing as it has to other natural resource crimes, compelling countries to improve their responses&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of cases show the potential results such prioritisation could yield. In October 2022, a report by the Financial Transparency Coalition found that the top 10 companies involved in IUU fishing for which there is beneficial ownership accounted for nearly one quarter of all reported vessels accused of IUU fishing. The Chinese-owned Pingtan Marine Enterprise Ltd was named as the main culprit. Using the available beneficial ownership data, the company – together with its beneficial owners – was sanctioned by the US government in December 2022 and delisted from the NASDAQ stock exchange. To deter IUU activity we need more action like this, but to enable it, key changes in terms of transparency of beneficial ownership must be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, public beneficial ownership registries must be instituted, whereby the fisheries sector is treated as a high-risk industry, with full disclosure of beneficial owners required when registering vessels. Meanwhile, FATF must pay the same level of attention to IUU fishing as it has to other natural resource crimes, compelling countries to improve their responses. In 2020, for example, FATF sought to galvanise action on IWT by recommending that countries assess their exposure to IWT-linked illicit finance; ensure legal powers exist to bring financial charges in relation to IWT offending; and undertake greater numbers of parallel financial investigations in IWT cases. The same galvanising action should be taken in relation to IUU fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have maximum impact, these measures must be accompanied by other transparency initiatives, with governments publishing up-to-date lists of IUU vessels and making fisheries agreements public. Together, these measures – which are not complex or overly costly to implement – will allow action to be taken against the hidden operators behind IUU activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the multifaceted global threat posed by IUU fishing set to evolve significantly in a warming world, the risk of failing to enact these changes is too great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/05YdEY4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of criminal activity in the fisheries sector has long been a matter of international concern. Today, with the Food and Agriculture Organization reporting record highs in global fisheries and aquaculture production, these concerns have grown ever-more pressing. Indeed, with international trade in fisheries and aquaculture products generating $151 billion in 2020, the scale of today’s global fisheries sector presents a range of critical vulnerabilities. Exploiting these are an array of actors, many potentially engaged in overlapping patterns of crime “convergence” in what has been described as a “perfect storm of illegal activities in the fishing sector”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of the complexity of these issues remains partial. Many relevant activities occur at sea, far from the eyes of those looking to expose them – and across supply chains spanning multiple jurisdictions. Even less well understood is how climate change is set to impact this “perfect storm”, with little research to date on the implications for existing patterns of crime convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet it is increasingly clear that criminality in the fisheries sector stands to evolve in a range of ways as the world warms. A number of these potential impacts were highlighted among the top 20 themes emerging from a recent RUSI horizon scan of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing trends in a warming world. These are collated for the first time and drawn out in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;climate-change-and-the-blue-shadow-economy&quot;&gt;Climate Change and the Blue Shadow Economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Criminal activity in the fisheries sector is categorised by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime across three broad areas. These include: crimes committed in the course of fishing operations (as a key component of IUU fishing); crimes associated with the fisheries sector (using fishing vessels or facilities, for example, but with no direct link to fishing operations); and crimes committed elsewhere in the fisheries value chain (such as fraud or corruption).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is increasingly clear that criminality in the fisheries sector stands to evolve in a range of ways as the world warms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the specific intersections across and within these categories are poorly understood, the potential for crime convergence is well recognised. In numerous cases, for example, IUU fishing has been linked to modern slavery and human trafficking. Corruption is well known as a critical enabler of this activity, as are fraud and associated money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range of changes to criminal activity in the fisheries sector can be expected as fish numbers and ranges shift with the warming of the world’s seas and oceans. Alongside damage caused by factors such as overfishing, there is evidence that oceanic warming will contribute to an ongoing decline in fish populations globally. In parallel, many species are expected to move poleward and to deeper waters as temperatures start to exceed tolerable thermal limits in a range of traditional fishing grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As fish populations respond, there are significant implications for those looking to catch them – both legally and illegally. Of specific interest here are the implications for those engaged in diverse illegal activities across the sector. Here, RUSI’s horizon scan identified a number of potential ways in which climate-induced shifts stand to alter criminal portfolios across the wider blue shadow economy, which can be grouped into three broad categories, as discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-shifting-use-of-fishing-vessels-in-drug-trafficking&quot;&gt;1. Shifting Use of Fishing Vessels in Drug Trafficking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of fishing vessels globally as a vector for drug trafficking operations is well known. Advantages include the cover offered by the established transport and distribution networks used in fishing operations, among others. A 2020 study found that the use of small fishing vessels to traffic drugs is on the rise globally (albeit without showing direct links to IUU fishing itself). Specifically, the use of fishing vessels in drug transhipment operations was found to have tripled in eight years, accounting for 15% of the global retail value of illegal drugs in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These crossovers originate at the local level and stand to evolve as key species move to cooler waters, out of reach of small-scale fishers. In key locations, collapsing stocks already risk driving artisanal fishers into drug trafficking, with the proceeds pumped back into fragile fisheries. There is also potential for these risks to be exacerbated by stricter conservation measures in key areas. The trajectory along which drugs travel across the oceans may thus increasingly begin with the story of failing fisheries and the ramifications for marginalised coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet warming conditions do not mean that the use of fishing vessels to traffic drugs will inevitably increase. As fish stocks adjust to a warming climate, corresponding shifts in the transport and distribution routes used in fishing operations could make fishing vessels less attractive to those looking to move drugs, where such routes no longer meet the needs of local traffickers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The use of fishing vessels globally as a vector for drug trafficking operations is well known&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of any of these scenarios, this evolving area of convergence must be met with stronger measures to protect livelihoods and enhance adaptive capacities among vulnerable fishing-dependent communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-role-of-iuu-fishing-in-fluid-criminal-portfolios&quot;&gt;2. Role of IUU Fishing in Fluid Criminal Portfolios&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where illegal activities converge in the fisheries sector, the makeup of the relevant criminal portfolios is dictated by risk, reward and opportunity. Where IUU fishing forms part of these portfolios, climate-driven changes in the scarcity and distribution of key resources could influence their profitability and attractiveness compared with other, non-fisheries commodities that may serve as complements or substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, as fish stocks decline, criminal actors’ calculations could shift and income streams could fluctuate as awareness grows of the profits to be made from increasingly rare high-value species. Such awareness has seen species such as the Chinese bahaba pushed to commercial extinction, with individual fish previously selling for over $450,000. In this context, an apparent prioritisation of trade in declining species is increasingly driving cycles of rapid illegal exploitation – a trend likely to continue in warmer conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such short-lived “booms” have seen dwindling fisheries exploited by roving bandits as high-value species decline. As stocks collapse, those responsible move on to the next relevant species. One example concerns illegal fishing for the endangered totoaba – rare fish prized in China for their swim bladders. Fishing for totoaba using illegal gillnets has simultaneously pushed the diminutive, critically endangered vaquita to near-extinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet as fish stocks collapse or become less accessible in key locations, this could also place pressure on the profitability of IUU fishing itself. Here, the cost of accessing dwindling, displaced fish stocks could rise to the point of making IUU fishing for key species less attractive than other activities. In this scenario, ever-more sophisticated organised criminal operations could be required to access shrinking fishing grounds, with the cost and risk involved potentially outweighing associated gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More detailed research is needed to assess the impact of these factors on the fluctuating income streams and risk–reward calculations of actors engaged in criminality in the fisheries sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-changing-patterns-of-human-exploitation&quot;&gt;3. Changing Patterns of Human Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change stands to impact crime in the fisheries sector further in relation to the use of human trafficking for forced labour. This connection is long established, with many examples of IUU fishing and labour exploitation occurring simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the points at which these phenomena intersect stand to be influenced by a range of factors in a warming world. Notably, as fishing operators seek to offset pressure on profitability where they are forced to pursue dwindling fish stocks, they may increasingly resort to other measures to remain viable, including a greater reliance on human trafficking for forced labour and other illegal labour practices. Investigation and prosecution of relevant cases in the fisheries sector has long been inadequate, creating little in the way of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As fishing operators seek to offset pressure on profitability where they are forced to pursue dwindling fish stocks, they may increasingly resort to other measures to remain viable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeding into these dynamics are not only the effects of climate change at sea, but also the impacts on land. Climate-induced pressure on profitability is increasingly felt in land-based sectors such as agriculture, with displaced members of fragile farming communities in some locations potentially vulnerable to recruitment into debt-bonded labour on fishing vessels. There are also concerns that the emergence of rising numbers of climate refugees could provide a growing labour pool for actors engaged in IUU fishing to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These complex interrelationships stand to evolve as climate stress on land affects criminal behaviour at sea and vice versa. There is thus an ongoing need to address climate-related drivers of IUU fishing and associated criminal activity in the wider context of alternative (land- and sea-based) livelihood options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responding-to-convergence&quot;&gt;Responding to Convergence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A focus on these shifting crossovers must be prioritised as the world’s waters continue to warm. Such patterns of activity can confound established approaches, with agencies responsible for fisheries management often inadequately trained to identify other crimes. Where the portfolios of perpetrators transcend conventional categories of crime, relevant enforcement agencies must adapt to a more complex operating context – one that will continue to evolve in a warming climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet such intricacies can also offer opportunities. With penalties for IUU fishing often lax, criminal convergence presents options to prosecute criminal actors under alternative legislation – such as that linked to economic crime or drug trafficking. This may offer more robust sentencing options and thus more significant deterrents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To exploit such options and to maximise disruptive impact, it is crucial that ongoing, context-specific analysis is conducted to identify and target common “nodes” between crimes. Forecasting the ways in which such nodes stand to shift as the world’s seas and oceans warm is a crucial part of this picture.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;何桂藍完成10天作供 指如黃定光「瞓咗冇睇」等3情況才屬無差別投票&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jCoDvjN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（31日）踏入審訊第95天。何桂藍繼續接受盤問，就控方指「墨落無悔」是就協調會議已達成的共識簽署，何不同意，指理解「墨落」出現正因有參與者不同意聲明內容。控方亦質疑，何無告知公眾她不會否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，惟何說：「我不嬲就係強調我一定會否決財政預算案吖嘛，就算五大訴求真係落實咗，我都可以否決㗎嘛」，法官亦提醒控方盤問有限度，證人沒說過不等於能反證其立場。控方亦指何桂藍與他人串謀無差別否決預算案，惟何指只有3種情況才屬無差別投票，包括議員不獲准辯論要直接表決、議員無傳召官員質詢，及如立法會前議員黃定光般「瞓咗無睇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何一度質疑控方提問「嘥時間」，法官着她冷靜，何指每次她問題不獲解答就被指不冷靜，但「我從來都冇激動過」。何今完成10天作供，料明將由陳志全作供。何作供完畢後面露興奮說「yes!」、「完——！」，又向身旁傳譯主任鞠躬說「辛苦晒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指王百羽等提我哋是代表何-何指理解不代表她發言&quot;&gt;控方指王百羽等提「我哋」是代表何 何指理解不代表她發言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍今第10天作供，繼續接受控方盤問。主控萬德豪續問及抗爭派記者會上其他人發言是否代表何，包括播片指何當時站在岑敖暉的右後方，而岑回答記者指「我哋」會堅定行使基本法權力否決預算案前，曾望向何桂藍的方向。林卓廷說「吓」，吳政亨亦發笑，法官陳慶偉即打斷：「Submission point, thank you.（留待陳詞，謝謝。）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續引王百羽提及「我哋嗰個最大公因數」是如五大訴求無落實，會堅決反對財政預算案，又稱是「我哋共同嘅諗法」。萬指王提及「我哋」是包括何桂藍，何說「佢可能係咁嘅意思啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬問那何會後有否告訴王，不應代表她說話？何續指「我理解佢冇代表我講嘢喎」，並指在記者會用「我哋」很常見，「如果每一次人哋用『我哋』嘅話都即刻跳出嚟話『喂等等先我哋冇傾喎』，咁個記者會開唔到」，又指岑敖暉和王百羽的講法本身與她的想法有否相同或相異之處，完全是另一問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3fi3yYs.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指控方提問浪費時間-官着何冷靜-何指從無激動過&quot;&gt;何指控方提問浪費時間 官着何冷靜 何指從無激動過&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續指，明白萬德豪打算在結案陳詞說的話，但認為那些真的只應留待陳詞（submission point），而何亦已回答問題。萬德豪續問何會後有否告訴岑敖暉、王百羽和梁晃維，他們看法不代表她。何靜默一會，李運騰指只需答是、否或者不記得，何說「我諗緊點解需要咁樣講啫」，後再稱「冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續追問，當日記者離開前，何有否向他們指上述人士說法不代表她，何說「我會唔會反對財政預算案同埋基於咩原因呢，我之前已經講咗半晝㗎喇」，而她理解控方是指記者會說法與她早前說法有出入，問她有否改變想法，何說「答案係冇嘅」，但「冇記者會坐喺度聽你講半晝嗰啲分別係咩分別」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指那不是控方問題，指控方只是問她有否告訴他人岑敖暉等說法不代表她，重申只需答是、否或不記得。何說「我而家就係話緊呢個問題好奇怪」，李指不論是否奇怪何也要回答，何說「我頭先咪答咗」，李問她的答案是？何說「第三次，NO」，並望向萬德豪：「你係咪問第四次喇？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉打斷稱：「這完全不好笑。（“This is not funny at all.”）」，何說「我都唔覺得好笑，我覺得好嘥時間」。陳慶偉說若是浪費他或法庭時間，他便會叫停，但不是由何決定。何即說：「你時間係時間，我時間唔係時間，OK！」李運騰續說「請冷靜，請冷靜，問題會否影響裁決是由法庭決定」，何續說：「每次我嘅問題不獲解答就話我唔冷靜要我 calm down 嘅，但我從來都冇激動過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續補充，民主派經常十幾廿個政黨一齊開記者會，「唔會話次次所有嘢都傾實都照答記者問題」，故她不明白剛才問題，因她不覺得記者會上有人提及無經討論的東西，「其他人會好自然咁覺得嗰啲係在場所有人嘅認知⋯⋯我唔認為喺法庭捉住一兩隻字就可以改變大家呢個認知。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指墨落無悔是就已達成的共識簽署-何不同意-指有無法同意的事項&quot;&gt;控方指「墨落無悔」是就已達成的共識簽署 何不同意 指有無法同意的事項&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦問及「墨落無悔」聲明，質疑聲明是協調會議達成的共識。萬德豪先逐段讀出，何說「可唔可以直接問問題」，萬續着她讀第二段，並在何看完後問她是否可讀中文（“You read Chinese?”），何即攤出左手反問：「咁都唔係一個嘥時間嘅問題？我識睇中文，睇咗30年」，旁聽席發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RNo7u0k.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何桂藍（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第二段：「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎。考慮到立場差異，此一綱領已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數。墨落理應無悔，否則等於失信於選民」，萬提到是指在協調會議已取得共識，尚欠簽名，發起人是邀請參選人就已達成的共識簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何不同意，指理解只是談及簽署「墨落無悔」聲明，又強調已取得的共識「都未形成一份大家都 agree 咗嘅文件」，故「冇簽過任何嘢」、「冇嘢可以簽」；她亦不同意「共同綱領」和「共識」是同一回事，指她理解「共同綱領」為一份大家同意的文件，但在新東「呢份嘢係冇出現過」，並非「簽咗定未簽」的問題，「係連份嘢都未 agree。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又指，她理解的共識是「幾時搞初選、係公民投票、有論壇」，形容「呢啲嘢係應該幾區都有嘅」，但亦理解至少像新東，其他區也有無法同意的事項。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指墨落無悔出現正因有參與協調者不願意簽&quot;&gt;何指「墨落無悔」出現正因有參與協調者不願意簽&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，發起人突然要求簽署一份新的、沒有達成共識的聲明，何不覺得荒謬（absurd）嗎？何指，「不如咁樣講，如果真係有一個共識係大家都同意呢兩點，咁點解最後戴耀廷唔要求大家簽，或者有人向戴耀廷表示佢唔想簽呢？」，並指無論基於什麼原因不願意公開表明立場，她理解「墨落」為何出現，「正正係因為喺參與協調會嘅人當中，有人唔願意或者唔同意呢啲嘢啊嘛。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，簽「墨落」是個人決定，她看到聲明兩點「我同意我咪簽囉」。萬再追問「墨落理應無悔」是指就共識簽署，何指理解「墨落」兩字「真係拎住筆喺張紙簽名，啲墨落咗喺啲紙上面」，是指「墨落無悔」聲明，而非指協調會議的討論或共識。何又指聲明開放予五個選區的人簽署，理解「區同區之間根本都冇任何討論」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指墨落內容有在會上討論但並非共識-官提醒控方知道面對的控制&quot;&gt;何指「墨落」內容有在會上討論但並非共識 官提醒控方知道面對的控制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，何有否告訴發起人參與者並無達成共識，何表示沒有，指這與個人是否認同聲明和是否簽署「冇乜關係」。萬再問，即是發起人要求他們簽署沒有跨區同意、新的東西？何指萬將「新」和無共識混淆，指這些東西當然在會上有討論，但有否共識是另一回事，「佢唔係新嘢，與此同時佢都唔係共識。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬再問，何是否知道發起人為何提及已取得共識，陳慶偉指是要求證人揣測。萬續提高聲線再問何：「你知道原因嗎？」惟陳慶偉再打斷指只是以不同方式問同一條問題。李運騰續說根據區諾軒，運用基本法權力的條款五區中至少有兩個版本（「會」及「會積極」），亦無證據顯示有跨選區的共識；又指控方除區諾軒外並無其他證人可證明該點，指法庭並非要下結論，「但你要知道你所面對的限制。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍不同意戴耀廷提聯合聲明指墨落無悔&quot;&gt;何桂藍不同意戴耀廷提「聯合聲明」指「墨落無悔」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪其後引戴耀廷6月12日予參與者的訊息，提到不用簽協議是他個人決定，又指「是否簽署聯合的聲明，確立之前的承諾，是大家自行的決定」。萬指「聯合的聲明」是指「墨落無悔」，何認為不能這樣揣測，亦覺得戴並非特定指明「墨落」，因其他區也有另外簽一些文件提交。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉亦指留意到戴提及「將來若出現紛爭，我會真誠地見證大家的協議是甚麼」，反問「那怎能是指『墨落無悔』？」，並指在此語境，認為戴是談及協調會議的協議。萬德豪欲追問何是否知道戴為何寫這則訊息，惟陳慶偉再打斷：「No, thank you.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;區諾軒指協調的協議實然存-何明顯非任何參選人理解&quot;&gt;區諾軒指「協調的協議實然存」 何：明顯非任何參選人理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引不同組織者說法，指協調共識包括否決財案。就區諾軒6月19日文章〈以正視聽——假如我有資格回應抗爭派立場聲明書發起人〉，提及：「就算沒有一份文件出台，但協調的協議實然存在⋯⋯沒有公開，不等於參與過的人沒有承諾遵守。諸如五大訴求、怎樣停止選舉工程、否決財政預算案，如果協議沒有約束力，那多次會議得來的共識，便毫無意義。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方指區提及否決預算案是協調會議共識，何說「區諾軒嘅意思可能係咁」，而她事後沒有問區為何說這是共識，是因「其實去到嗰個地步，organiser 再講啲咩其實都毫無意義，因為好明顯『協調的協議實然存在』唔係任何 candidate 嘅理解啦，如果唔係就一早簽咗（協議）啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷稱不會愚蠢到製造dq藉口-何質疑唔通簽協議唔係共識咩&quot;&gt;戴耀廷稱不會愚蠢到製造DQ藉口 何質疑：唔通簽協議唔係共識咩？&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後引戴耀廷於6月9日記者會提及在協調過程有共識，知道為何望爭取35+，但在《國安法》下，「我哋唔會愚蠢到自己去製造一個藉口畀呢個當權者嚟去DQ我哋參與呢個計劃嘅人」，指何會理解戴指的共識是否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EFAdk0g.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續說：「睇完我更加唔明喎，咁唔通簽協議唔係共識咩？咁點解可以單方面話呢個係愚蠢嘅共識跟住就話唔要呀？」，又指「我理解嘅共識係有份嘢會擺喺提名表喎，我第一次 realise 佢當日係咁樣講，唔係好明點解會變咗做愚蠢？」萬問何即是不同意？何說：「完全唔知道佢呢度講嘅共識係咩囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，在5月5日新東第二次會議至6月9日記者會期間，何是否完全沒有追問組織者何時舉行下次會議，何不同意，指應該有問區諾軒。萬說是何第一次告訴法庭，陳慶偉即打斷說：「Move on, move on please.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指支持迫使特首回應五大訴求但不認為否決財案可迫特首回應&quot;&gt;何指支持迫使特首回應五大訴求、但不認為否決財案可迫特首回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就「墨落無悔」第一點聲明：「我認同『五大訴求，缺一不可』。我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，何指支持迫使特首回應五大訴求，但「從來都冇人 define 過究竟五大訴求係咩」；又指因認為否決財案無辦法迫特首回應五大訴求，故就整句「冇話支持唔支持」，並確認無向其他人提過認為否決財案不能迫特首回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何亦同意無向發起人反映不同意將否決財案和五大訴求綑綁，因理解聲明是處理「避唔避DQ」的問題。何亦重申，沒有收過戴耀廷發出的新東最終協議文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指何無告知公眾不會否決財案-何我不嬲就係強調我一定會否決&quot;&gt;控方指何無告知公眾不會否決財案 何：我不嬲就係強調我一定會否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續指何沒有告訴過公眾，她不會否決預算案迫使政府回應五大訴求。何說：「唔係，我不嬲就係強調我一定會否決財政預算案吖嘛，就算五大訴求真係落實咗，我都可以否決㗎嘛」，林卓廷、陳志全等大笑。李運騰亦指證人已說過很多次。萬續指其問題不只是否決預算案，而是迫政府回應五大訴求，並再重複問題。何答：「我從來冇向公眾講過我唔會否決財政預算案，whatever the reason。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，認為控方循此方向盤問也有限度，指證人有權維持緘默，沒說過不等於能反證其立場。（“The fact that she didn’t say anything does not prove the contrary, there is a limit how far you can go.”）萬回應，會這樣問是因何桂藍有簽署「墨落無悔」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，何桂藍早前曾供稱，認為預算案存有「財政黑洞」、議員無法盡責審議，投反對票才是履行議員責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指何串謀無差別否決財案-何指僅3情況會無差別投票&quot;&gt;控方指何串謀無差別否決財案 何指僅3情況會無差別投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續向何指出控方案情，指她與他人串謀取得立法會主導權，以無差別否決預算案。何回應，她理解在立法會要無差別就議案投票有3種情況，第一種是被動，如立法會主席梁君彥有時會批准議員提修正案，但完全不予辯論時間，要求直接表決，令議員「無辦法做任何審議就要投票㗎喇」，亦是2018年區諾軒遇到的情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二種情況則是主動，如2021年初財委會試過在「冇 call 官員嚟質詢、冇任何辯論嘅情況下」通過了8個項目，共涉300億，何引時任財委會主席陳健波指議員可傳召官員，但要前一日通知，「但冇一個建制派議員記得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第三種情況，何說「就係好似黃定光咁直程喺議會瞓咗冇睇嘅」，旁聽席大笑，何即微微轉頭嚴肅說：「呢個唔係一個笑話 sorry。」何指除了上述三種情況，「我理解唔到點解喺立法會入面，會有任何議案係 indiscriminately 咁投票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mQRUka9.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指控方毋須再指出案情-指何已回答不見有何作用&quot;&gt;官指控方毋須再指出案情 指何已回答、不見有何作用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指，其問題只需答是或否，就是何有沒有與其他被告串謀。惟法官陳慶偉打斷指萬毋須問此問題，指明白控方在指出案情，但 Beel 已問過相關問題。萬指他有責任這樣做，惟李運騰指 Beel 已將控方指控向被告指出，她已回答，控方重複再做並非善用時間，亦不見任何作用；陳慶偉亦說何桂藍已就此回答，「她的答案是不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬終表示沒有其他問題，何桂藍即面露興奮握拳輕聲說「yes!」。代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 一度擬於明早進行覆問，惟何即不情願說：「唔好啦！」被告和旁聽人士大笑。Beel 續問及，何今早指理解王百羽不是代表她說話，那就岑敖暉和梁晃維的說法是否也有同樣理解，何答「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/horzHKU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍完成作供-明將由陳志全作供&quot;&gt;何桂藍完成作供 明將由陳志全作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指沒有其他問題，亦不會傳召其他證人，何桂藍案情完結。何興奮歎道：「呀！完——！」，並笑着靠後飲水，又一度微微站起身想要離開。法官續關注案件進度，問能否於8月尾前完結證供，萬德豪指對此感樂觀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑則指，相信鄒是餘下證供最長的證人，法官陳慶偉續說 Beel 早前也說何桂藍主問需時兩天，李運騰笑指那並不能相信。陳世傑指現時有不多於200條問題，但應不會太長，預計能於3至4天內完成主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉下令案件明續審，料明將由陳志全作供，新東尚餘不認罪被告包括陳志全、鄒家成、林卓廷、梁國雄及柯耀林。散庭時，何桂藍站起向身旁的法庭傳譯主任鞠躬道謝，數度說「辛苦晒」，又轉身望向旁聽席微笑和以手勢交流。另歌手黃耀明下午亦有到庭旁聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑何無提35不可能-何強調即使不可能仍要取相應票數&quot;&gt;控方質疑何無提35+不可能 何強調即使不可能仍要取相應票數&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方今亦問及何桂藍6月26日發布，與岑敖暉拍攝有關《國安法》的片段，引何片中提及國安法是中共為香港設下的局，國安會「無差別拘捕（indiscriminately）」。惟何指她提到的是「濫捕」而非「無差別」，「我 dispute（不贊同）緊你 indiscriminately 嗰個 translation」，萬說他只是從英文謄本讀出。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續引何片中提到香港人如何「破局」，就是民主派如在立會選舉「達成一個不可能嘅任務，攞到35席，攞到立法會過半嘅主導權，我哋就可以逼出一個北京冇可能接受到嘅局面，從而令到佢用更加瘋狂嘅方式去應對，要付出更加高昂嘅政治代價」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬質疑何是宣傳要取得35席，何不同意，因35+是不可能亦是北京無可能接受的局面，又指在DQ將發生下，她將「攞到過半」和「攞到過半所需嘅得票」兩者「撈埋咗」。萬質疑她沒有告訴觀眾35+是不可能，何說「因為如果咁樣講，佢哋連票都唔會投囉」，強調想傳遞的訊息從來都是「就算攞唔到（35+），都要投票，攞到相應嘅票數」，即使是不可能，「唔等於我哋唔需要投呢個局面出嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指逼北京瘋狂應對為攬炒-何北京如何應對非攬炒是單方面破壞香港&quot;&gt;控方指逼北京瘋狂應對為「攬炒」 何：北京如何應對非攬炒、是單方面破壞香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續指，何說要令北京以更瘋狂方式應對，是要加劇「攬炒」，何說「北京用咩方式去應對，嗰個就唔係『攬炒』，係佢單方面 destruct（破壞）香港喇」，重申「攬炒」的假定或預測，就是中共「好容易 overreact（過度反應）」，而此預測是來自過去多年中共表現的「慣性」：「就係每一次佢哋意識到佢哋喺個制度入面有可能輸或者被挑戰，佢哋會直接破壞個制度。」&lt;/p&gt;

For each category, the report examines how the size and composition of Russian weapons portfolios in Ukraine are changing under the twin influences of attrition and sanctions, while taking account of Russian efforts to increase defense production and otherwise replenish its forces. It concludes by assessing the impact of Russia’s declining weapons portfolios in Ukraine on its ability to carry out future operations against Kyiv, as well as in other regions of interest such as Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and the Caucasus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report finds that the magnitude of Russian equipment losses and ammunition usage in Ukraine is having a major negative effect on the Kremlin’s ability to prosecute the war. In each of the five categories, Russian defense production is struggling to keep pace with its growing losses on the battlefield due to sanctions and capacity limitations, although they have been offset to some extent by various stopgap measures. The resulting decline in the size and quality of Russian weapons portfolio in Ukraine are further undermining Russia’s ability to sustain operations. Growing signs of an impending ammunition shortage are particularly problematic since Russian forces in Ukraine rely so heavily on artillery to sustain operations. By contrast, the Ukrainian military has been able to rely on a steady influx of Western military equipment to replenish its forces and preserve its combat power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resulting shifts in the balance of forces are creating a window of opportunity for Ukraine to renew its counteroffensive and recover additional territory. It is not clear, however, whether conditions are ripe enough yet for Kyiv to make enough gains to decisively seize the initiative and escape the current cycle of attrition altogether. So far, equipment and ammunition shortages have tended to undermine Russia’s offensive capabilities more than they have its defensive capabilities. Moreover, the Kremlin is making a concerted effort to mobilize defense production. Given its enormous prewar equipment stockpiles, remaining defense production capabilities, and continuing support from countries still willing to do business with Russia, the Kremlin likely still retains the capacity to reverse recent declines in its weapons portfolio and replenish its forces in Ukraine at levels sufficient to continue the war effort, albeit with some limitations. However, the prolonged invasion coupled with heavy manpower and equipment losses will likely limit Moscow’s ability to engage in high-intensity conventional military operations in other areas, at least in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report, which was drafted in May 2023, is the second report in a series exploring Russia’s defense industry under the allied sanctions and export controls. The first report examined the impact of sanctions on the Kremlin’s ability to manufacture and sustain advanced weapons systems without direct access to higher-end Western components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s armed forces entered the war in Ukraine with formidable advantages in military equipment and technology over the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU). On paper at least, the Russian military was particularly well equipped for the task, with ample armor, artillery, and precision strike weapons, as well as an impressive array of combat support systems, including uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and electronic warfare (EW). During the initial invasion, however, Russian forces significantly underperformed while their ambitious multi-axis strategy intended to rapidly dislocate Ukrainian forces, seize major cities in the east, surround Kyiv, and install a pro-Kremlin regime quickly faltered, leaving Moscow embroiled in a long and brutal war of attrition centered primarily on southeastern Ukraine but encompassing missile strikes across the country. After more than a year of high-intensity combat, Russian forces in Ukraine have incurred enormous losses in troops and matériel and have been significantly attrited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin is urgently seeking to replace its equipment losses by mobilizing its defense base and ramping up production. Russian leaders are also pursuing a variety of stopgap measures, withdrawing Soviet-era equipment from storage, and purchasing matériel from Iran and North Korea. Thus far, however, such measures have fallen short of what is needed to replenish Russia’s equipment stocks. Consequently, Russian forces in Ukraine are now trapped in a cycle of attrition and are facing shortages of equipment and ammunition, at least over the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report assesses the extent to which Moscow’s growing equipment and ammunition shortages from sustained attrition are affecting its ability to prosecute the war in Ukraine, as well as conduct military operations in other areas. It starts by examining the extent to which Russian losses are changing the composition of its forces in Ukraine — and their weapons portfolios — while also taking account of Russian efforts to replace those losses. These findings are then used to assess how reductions in the size, quality, and composition of Russian equipment stocks are affecting the military’s ability to prosecute the war in Ukraine and conduct potential future operations in other regions of interest, including Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and the South Caucasus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than a year of war, the magnitude of Russia’s equipment losses in Ukraine is hurting its ability to prosecute the war. Growing artillery ammunition shortages, in particular, are casting doubt on coming operations. Defense production rates are failing to keep pace with losses on the battlefield. Moscow is attempting to boost production, but such efforts are being undermined by Western sanctions and enduring capacity constraints. Efforts at import substitution are facing difficulties as well due to the country’s enduring technological deficiencies and its lack of access to advanced machine tools. Stopgap measures (e.g., fielding legacy tanks taken from storage) are undermining the quality of Russian equipment in Ukraine. While Russian leaders continue to struggle with reconstituting their forces, military commanders on the ground are having to make do with a significantly degraded fighting force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting equipment and ammunition shortages are clearly undermining Russia’s ability to sustain operations in Ukraine. However, the impact is uneven, affecting some capabilities more than others. Thus far, they have tended to undermine Russia’s offensive capabilities more than they have its defensive capabilities. Unusually high tank losses have further reduced the military’s ability to maneuver. Russian artillery losses and growing ammunition shortages have the potential to be even more consequential, as this could substantially undercut Russia’s ability to sustain mass fires during coming operations. By contrast, Moscow has thus far been able to maintain a relatively high tempo of drone and EW operations despite substantial losses since it has been able to tap into external sources in the first case and to maintain adequate inventories in the second. Moscow has also been able to sustain its long-range precision strike campaign despite having drawn down its initial missile stocks by shifting to a lower-cost and more sustainable mix of missiles and one-way attack drones. It is important to remember, however, that each weapons category is to some extent dependent on the others, such that degrading capability in one area can also affect others. This is the case with Russian drone losses, which provide essential targeting data for Russian artillery. On the other hand, maintaining strength in one area can often help compensate for weaknesses in other areas. Russian advantages in artillery have been used to compensate for deficiencies in Russian maneuver units, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;It is important to remember, however, that each weapons category is to some extent dependent on the others, such that degrading capability in one area can also affect others.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, Russia’s growing losses in troops and matériel have left it increasingly vulnerable to a potential AFU counteroffensive. However, it is unclear how long this situation will endure. As the first report in this series noted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Available evidence indicates that the Kremlin will still be able to maintain its war efforts in Ukraine. Sanctions and export controls are not a silver bullet that will force Russia to bring the war to an end. Russia’s large prewar equipment stockpiles, its massive military industrial complex, and the prioritization of defense production . . . as part of Moscow’s wartime mobilization are likely to enable the Kremlin to continue to wage war in Ukraine, albeit with limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, therefore, Russian leaders are likely to find ways to reconstitute their forces, as discussed further below. In the meantime, despite heavy losses, the Russian military still has significant troops and equipment in Ukraine that it can call upon to defend its gains. Thus, it is not clear how long this window will remain open and whether conditions are ripe enough yet for Ukraine to break the cycle of its attrition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report will examine these issues in greater detail, focusing on the evolving state of Russian equipment inventories in five key weapons categories: main battle tanks (MBTs), artillery, UAVs, EW, and theater precision strike weapons. The report will commence by examining changes in inventory levels for each weapons category due to attrition and the resulting impact on the size, quality, and character of the force, taking account of Russian efforts at replenishment. These findings are then used to gauge the impact of resulting shortages on Russia’s ability to prosecute the war in Ukraine. Next, the report will examine the broader implications of Russian ammunition and equipment shortages on the military’s ability to conduct operations in other areas, including Central Asia (the case of Kazakhstan), the Middle East and North Africa (the case of Syria), and the Caucasus (the case of Georgia). The report concludes with a summary of its key findings, followed by recommendations for policymakers to help prioritize future equipment transfers for Ukraine and refine sanctions efforts in ways that will help shift the balance of forces more in Ukraine’s favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;main-battle-tanks&quot;&gt;Main Battle Tanks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHANGES IN FORCE POSTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maneuver warfare has long been a pillar of Russia’s way of war, with Russian tank groupings playing a central role in such operations. On paper at least, Russia’s tank and motorized infantry units are particularly well equipped for the mission with large numbers of tanks and other armored vehicles, as well as organic artillery. During the initial invasion, however, Russia’s attempts at armored maneuver warfare were largely unsuccessful, except in the south. Instead, Ukrainian forces were able to make effective use of an array of anti-tank and related weapons to exact a heavy toll on Russian tanks and armored vehicles, while helping blunt Russia’s offensive. Since then, Russian tank losses have continued to mount, leading military commanders to adjust their tactics and use tanks in different roles, but with mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia entered the war in Ukraine with a frontline force of around 2,927 main battle tanks according to the Military Balance 2022. This was comprised of a combination of Russian frontline tanks, including approximately 2,030 T-72s, 480 T-80s, and 417 T-90s of various kinds. Russian tanks in Ukraine are based on Soviet-era designs that have been incrementally upgraded over the last thirty years. The most advanced models employed by Russia during the initial invasion included the T-72B3M, T-90M, and T-80BVM; however, Russia’s invasion force also included many earlier versions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By February 2023, Russia had lost at least 1,900 MBTs according to Oryx (abandoned, captured, or destroyed) — around two-thirds of its original total. Since Oryx only reports on tank losses that it is able to verify, Russia’s actual tank losses likely exceed this amount by a significant margin. This means at a minimum Russia has been losing, on average, around 150 tanks per month. According to anecdotal evidence provided by Ukrainian colleagues from CACDS consulted for this report, the shortage of tanks and armored vehicles in some Russian ground force units is reaching upwards of 60–70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Russia’s actual tank production capacity is a matter of significant debate, thus far, Russian tank factories are falling well short of producing enough tanks to replace its losses in Ukraine. In recent years, Russian tank factories were able to produce on average around 250 new and modernized T-72B3, T-80BVM, and T-90M main battle tanks each year. In December 2022, Russian minister of defense Sergei Shoigu reported that the defense industry had achieved a 30 percent increase in production of basic weapons over the previous year. Assuming this also applies to main battle tanks, that would bring annual production up to 325 tanks per year. According to another recent report, Russia can likely restore another 600 old Soviet-era tanks taken from storage per year. Even when these two figures are added, the total still falls well short of the 1,900 tanks needed to replace its losses in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia’s tank industry is striving to increase production, it currently lacks the capacity to produce enough new or upgraded tanks to replace its losses. It will take months and in many cases years to add new plants and equipment, hire skilled workers, and establish supply chains. Moreover, expanding capacity is likely to be complicated to some extent by loss of access to high-end Western machine tools currently blocked by sanctions, even though Russia is finding ways to maintain access to some Western machinery in spite of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions are complicating Russian tank production in other ways, as well. As mentioned in the first report in this series, in some cases, Russian tanks are being delivered without some of their most advanced subsystems, such as the SOSNA-U targeting system, which relies on a French thermal imager. Imports of these components are now banned due to sanctions, leading Russia to install less capable legacy gun sights on replacement tanks. Sanctions are likely to further complicate Russian defense production given the continuing presence of Western components and electronics in Russian MBTs. Shifting to import substitution or finding workable replacements will be difficult and will likely drive up costs and/or lead to reductions in quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Although Russia’s tank industry is striving to increase production, it currently lacks the capacity to produce enough new or upgraded tanks to replace its losses. It will take time to add new plants and equipment, hire skilled workers, and establish supply chains.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of such production problems, starting in May 2022, Russia began pulling older Soviet-era tanks out of storage, refurbishing them, and sending them to Ukraine. These include various legacy models, such as the T-62, T-55, and T-54, the latter first introduced in the 1950s. Most of these tanks have subpar capabilities, which will reduce their effectiveness on the modern battlefield. Yet, as noted above, Russian forces are only projected to receive around 600 of these refurbished Soviet-era tanks per year. Moreover, sustaining even this total may prove challenging for Russia, since those tanks remaining in storage will likely require even more extensive refurbishment. Yet, even when combined with the 240–325 additional tanks currently produced each year by Uralvagonzavod, the monthly total of around 80–90 tanks per month still falls well short of the 150 tanks needed to replace its losses. It should be noted, however, that Moscow appears to be holding several hundred of its most advanced T-90 tanks in reserve, possibly to support a future NATO contingency, and could potentially draw upon these if needed in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Russian defense industry is likely to eventually find ways to increase tank production, including drawing upon thousands of older tanks in storage to sustain its forces, although the remaining tanks will likely require more extensive refurbishment. Yet, over the near term at least, Russian forces will continue to face shortages and will have to make do with a markedly diminished tank force, one with substantially fewer tanks and declining quality levels as the proportion of legacy tanks taken from storage increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPERATIONAL IMPACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the tactical level, the decline in the quality of Russian tanks used in Ukraine has reduced their effectiveness to some extent. Without the SOSNA-U targeting system, for example, Russian tanks are facing greater difficulties in detecting and targeting Ukrainian forces at long range, especially at night. As a result, these tanks have lost their first fire advantage, leaving them vulnerable to strikes by Ukrainian forces who spot them first. Likewise, Russia’s thin-skinned legacy tanks, such as the T-62, which the Russians have been fielding in Ukraine, have less than half the frontal armor protection of today’s main battle tanks and their turret roof armor is especially thin, leaving them even more susceptible to Ukrainian anti-tank weapons ranging from rocket-propelled grenades to artillery. Moreover, the legacy guns on older Russian tanks will be less able to penetrate thicker armor on the latest Western tanks used by Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the tactical-operational level, reductions in the size and quality of Russia’s tank forces in Ukraine are having a more pronounced effect on Russia’s ability to prosecute the war. For one, Russia’s ability to conduct armored maneuver warfare has been markedly diminished by the reductions (along with Russian troop losses, shortages of artillery ammunition, and other factors). That said, Russian forces have struggled with combined arms maneuver even when they had a full complement of their best frontline tanks, indicating more fundamental failings in operational planning, training, and leadership. At the outset of the campaign, Russian attempts to defeat Ukraine in a lightning campaign using concentrated armor were largely unsuccessful (except in the south). Although they made advances in some areas, they also incurred heavy tank losses from Ukrainian units supported by a dense network of artillery and anti-tank weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VXP2tP2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A Russian tank destroyed by Ukrainian forces in Luhansk Oblast on February 26, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the campaign progressed, and as tank and personnel losses mounted, Russian forces have had even less success with armored maneuver warfare, even on a smaller scale. For example, during the Donbas campaign in April–May 2022, Russian forces attempted to break through AFU lines around Izyum with the apparent objective of enveloping Ukrainian forces in the Donbas. Ultimately, they incurred heavy tank losses while making only limited gains. Once the campaign transitioned to a war of attrition, Russia’s ability to maneuver declined even further, though troop shortages, poor training, and tactical deficiencies have also played a role. Given the diminished size and quality of Russia’s tank force, persistent tactical deficiencies, and the heavy attrition incurred by the force as a whole, Russia’s ability to conduct armored maneuver is likely to remain limited until it can replenish its forces and improve combat proficiency, condemning Russia for now to an attrition strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Russian armor has retained the ability to operate effectively when used with infantry in an assault role. Russian ground forces enjoyed local tactical successes when using tanks in this manner, as demonstrated during the grinding, large-scale Russian offensives carried out in the Donbas in mid-2022 and more recently in Bakhmut. Under this approach, concentrated Russian infantry backed by tanks, armored vehicles, and massed artillery have had success at times in conducting sustained frontal assaults against entrenched Ukrainian forces. In some cases, tanks were used in combination with infantry to conduct armored assaults on AFU defensive positions, while in others they were used in a standoff role to provide mobile fire support. In several cases, Russian forces were able to make steady incremental gains over time by wearing down Ukrainian defenders, exploiting weak points within their front lines and compelling them to retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that for operations such as this, reductions in the quality of Russian tank forces are less important, so long as a sufficient number of tanks are available to support the operation. Moreover, even legacy Soviet-era tanks will generally suffice for such assaults since mobility, firepower, and protection are what matter most in such cases. Nevertheless, the Russian army has incurred serious tank losses during such operations, and they were not always successful. Given the continuing high attrition rates experienced during such operations, the ability and willingness of Russian commanders to undertake them is likely to diminish as well, at least over the near term. According to recent testimony by U.S. intelligence officials, Russian forces will be increasingly challenged to conduct even modest offensive operations absent further mobilization and additional ammunition supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;artillery-and-ammunition&quot;&gt;Artillery and Ammunition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHANGES IN FORCE POSTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery has traditionally held a central place in Russian military doctrine. Russian maneuver brigades and dedicated artillery and rocket brigades are particularly well equipped with towed and self-propelled artillery and multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS). Russian forces in Ukraine have relied heavily on their artillery and MLRS to support offensive and defensive operations and to degrade Ukrainian forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the war has progressed, however, Russian artillery losses have continued to mount while ammunition stockpiles have exhibited growing signs of depletion due to exceptionally high ammunition usage rates. Russia’s declining ammunition stockpiles are particularly problematic for Russian forces since the Kremlin’s strategy of attrition is critically dependent on artillery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian artillery and rocket forces had over 4,894 artillery platforms in active service in 2022 according to The Military Balance 2022. These included 2,118 self-propelled and towed howitzers, 1,056 MLRS, and 1,720 heavy mortars. Moreover, Russia also maintains thousands of artillery and MLRS platforms in storage. This was sufficient to provide Russia with an enormous advantage in firepower over Ukraine at the start of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Russian forces have lost a substantial number of artillery, including at least 486 artillery systems and 191 MLRS (captured, abandoned, or destroyed), as of February 2023. Even more importantly, they have expended enormous amounts of both tubed and rocket artillery ammunition during the war, on average using around 20,000 shells per day throughout last year, and as many as 40,000 shells per day during peak periods of the spring and summer offensives in 2022. Despite its large prewar ammunition stockpiles, such intensive rates of fire are proving unsustainable, even for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3oXDvsV.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ This photo, taken on December 7, 2022, shows collected remnants of shells and missiles used by Russian forces in their attack against the second-largest Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faced with such issues, Russia is pursuing a range of measures to sustain its artillery and rocket forces in Ukraine. Russian defense firms continue to deliver new and upgraded artillery systems for the front. Yet current production rates are insufficient to replace Russia’s losses in Ukraine. The defense industry is also taking measures to increase artillery production, working extra shifts, and rallying the artillery sector to improve efficiencies. Efforts to ramp up production have been hindered by sanctions, however, which are restricting Russia’s ability to obtain high-end Western machine tools and high-quality gun steel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia faces even greater challenges in maintaining ammunition supply for its artillery and rocket forces. Ammunition shortages are much more of a limiting factor for Russia than are its artillery losses, since Russia still has enough guns to bring mass firepower to bear when needed. At first glance, it appears that Russian defense firms continue to deliver substantial amounts of artillery and MLRS ammunition. According to the Russian defense conglomerate Rostec, ammunition production has now reached a new 10-year high. However, current production rates for 122-millimeter and 152-millimeter artillery shells — both Soviet-standard ammunition — appear wholly inadequate to replenish existing stockpiles given current expenditure levels. The same is true of production of rocket ammunition for Russian MLRS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the Kremlin has been turning to North Korea and Iran for additional artillery ammunition. Although not insignificant, the amounts involved so far are unlikely to materially improve Russia’s supply situation. Consequently, Russia continues to dig deeply into its existing munition stocks to sustain operations, amid growing signs of depletion. One U.S. official reported that Russia is now using 40-year-old artillery shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the foregoing factors, the Russian military is liable to face a serious shortage of artillery ammunition during the next phase of the war and will likely have to operate with a partially depleted artillery force. For much of the war, Russian artillery and rocket forces have been able to operate at a high tempo while maintaining fire superiority over Ukrainian forces. In December, however, U.S. officials reported that Russian artillery fires had declined by 75 percent, fueling speculation that Russia may be running dangerously low on artillery ammunition or attempting to conserve ammunition. In April 2023, the Russian private military company Wagner Group’s chief, Yevgeny Prighozin, admitted as much, threatening to withdraw his forces from the front due to ongoing ammunition shortages. Yet Russian forces have been able for the most part to sustain a high tempo of artillery fire during recent ground offensives in Bakhmut and Avdiyivka. Given Russia’s growing signs of shell hunger, however, its forces may soon find themselves forced to ration artillery usage even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPERATIONAL IMPACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s declining artillery and munition stocks are likely to have a major impact on Russian military operations in Ukraine, if not properly addressed. An inability to sustain artillery fires at previous levels would seriously undermine Russia’s ability to effectively prosecute the war. Russian forces continue to rely heavily on artillery to offset deficiencies in other areas, including infantry, armor, and close air support. Artillery also plays a central role in Russia’s attrition strategy, with mass artillery used to pound Ukrainian positions and urban population centers, both to degrade their forces and weaken their resolve. A shortage of artillery would erode these capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian artillery has played a crucial role in Russian defensive operations as well. Artillery was instrumental in helping stem the Kherson counteroffensive in late 2022. At the same time, defensive use of artillery has been able to inflict “frightful losses” on Ukrainian forces during recent counteroffensives in Kharkiv and Kherson. When used defensively, Russia’s approach is to bring mass firepower to bear to break up Ukrainian troop concentrations, disrupt attacks, interdict supply chains, and attrite their forces. However, defensive use of artillery consumes large amounts of ammunition. Acute ammunition shortages would thus weaken Russian defensive capabilities, opening up additional opportunities for Ukrainian counteroffensives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artillery has also been critically important for Russian offensive operations. Russia has been using mass fires, for example, to support the grinding, methodical advances taking place at Bakhmut. In this case, Russian forces are using artillery to keep Ukrainian forces in place, prevent them from concentrating, destroy strong points, and deliver suppressing fires during Russian ground assaults. In the Donbas, Russian artillery inflicted thousands of casualties, while at times creating a paralyzing effect on Ukrainian forces. In the process, however, Russian artillery units are using enormous amounts of ammunition. Growing ammunition shortages would thus further weaken Russia’s ability to conduct offensive operations as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Defensive use of artillery consumes large amounts of ammunition. Acute ammunition shortages would thus weaken Russian defensive capabilities, opening up additional opportunities for Ukrainian counteroffensives.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this problem, Russia is attempting to make greater use of precision artillery, which is far more efficient than unguided shells. Being properly supported with quality targeting data and reconnaissance strike complexes designed to link sensors with fires through battlespace networks would help Russia enormously to conserve artillery ammunition, while also reducing its logistical footprint. To date, however, Russian forces have faced challenges in scaling up the use of precision artillery due to poor training; limited intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities; and, most importantly, insufficient precision munition stocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;uncrewed-aerial-vehicles&quot;&gt;Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHANGES IN FORCE POSTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia was a latecomer in adopting UAVs, but over the last 15 years, it has made a concerted effort to catch up, developing a series of ISR and combat drones, and loitering munitions. According to the Kremlin, Russia entered the war with approximately 2,000 military drones of various kinds, distributed across the different services. These included hundreds of Orlan-10 ISR UAVs; Orion combat drones; Lancet-3 and KUB-BLA loitering munitions; and special purpose drones, such as the Leer-3, which is designed to hijack and disrupt cellular phone traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although exact numbers are hard to come by, since the war began, Russia has likely lost hundreds of UAVs to Ukrainian air defense, electronic attack, system failure, and pilot error. To replenish its stocks, Russia’s defense industry has promised to ramp up production of ISR drones, combat drones, and loitering munitions. To this end, Putin recently announced a new national import substitution program for the development of UAVs in Russia with up to 1 trillion rubles in new funding. However, the defense industry is grappling with supply chain issues due to shortages of navigation, radio communication, avionics, and information technology (IT) components, as well as capacity problems. Although there is evidence of some improvement, the industry is still having difficulty producing enough drones to meet demand. For example, production of Orion UAVs was recently estimated at a mere 45 units per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions are also contributing to Russia’s production problems. Russia’s Orlan-10 and Lancet UAVs rely on Western components — including cameras, engines, and electronics — some of which are placed on the sanctions list. Likewise, production of Russia’s Orion, which is comparable to Turkey’s Bayrakter, remains restricted due to sanctions and capacity limitations, while Moscow’s use of the Forpost-R combat drone in Ukraine has thus far been negligible. Russian officials recently announced a new program to shift over more fully to import substitution, but this is unlikely to lead to major increases in output over the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to such issues, Russian forces in Ukraine faced a serious drone shortage several months into the war. To compensate, Russia has been purchasing commercial UAVs made by Chinese companies, such as Da-Jiang Innovations (DJI), through online retailers and other channels. Chinese DJI quadcopters, designed for civilian use, have become particularly prevalent on the battlefield after repurposing for military use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Russian military is seeking to acquire a large number of “first-person view” (FPV) drones from China (or components to build them) for use as small, high-speed kamikaze drones. These are already being used by the AFU to good effect in Ukraine. Russia is also turning to Iran for UAVs, including the Mojaher-6 combat drone. Evidence also suggests that Moscow has been able to increase production for certain systems, such as the Lancet-3, based on a sharp increase in attacks in Ukraine since November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, Russian drone supplies have been sufficient to sustain a reasonably high tempo of drone operations despite persistent gaps in coverage due to the sheer size of the battlespace. Collectively, however, high UAV loss rates due to Ukrainian air defense and EW are driving Russia to import large numbers of foreign UAVs to replenish its stocks. Given domestic production limitations, Moscow remains highly dependent on Chinese civilian drones. According to Russian customs data, China has sold more than $12 million in drones and drone parts to Russia since the start of the war, although that likely understates actual volumes by a significant margin, given the prevalence of private drone purchases by Russian civilian volunteer groups. If Russia’s access to Chinese drones were to diminish due to sanctions, or if Russian drone losses significantly increased due to the AFU’s rising counter-UAV capabilities, growing shortages would start to erode the many advantages accruing for Russian forces from concentrated use of UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;If Russia’s access to Chinese drones were to diminish due to sanctions, or if Russian drone losses significantly increased due to the AFU’s rising counter-UAV capabilities, growing shortages would start to erode the many advantages accruing for Russian forces from concentrated use of UAVs.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPERATIONAL IMPACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveillance drones have been critical for Russia in maintaining battlespace awareness in Ukraine. ISR drones, such as Orlan-10, are serving effectively as forward-based artillery spotters, relaying data on Ukrainian positions to waiting Russian artillery batteries. When used effectively, ISR drones have reportedly helped to compress the time between target detection and strike to just three to five minutes. They have also helped artillery units conserve ammunition by reducing the need for blind shelling. Disruption of Russia’s ISR drone supply would therefore diminish a key component of Russia’s artillery kill chain, further undermining Russia’s ability to sustain effective artillery fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/iLZiA5d.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A critical power infrastructure burning after a Russian drone attack against Kyiv on December 19, 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of Russian surveillance drones linked to artillery has restricted the AFU’s freedom of action across the battlespace. When used in combination with Russian combat drones and loitering munitions, their pervasive presence has compelled AFU ground force commanders at times to disperse their forces and conceal weapons and troop movements in tactically limiting or unsound ways. A reduction in Russian drone supply would help loosen these strictures, allowing Ukrainian forces to concentrate their efforts more effectively while potentially restoring the element of surprise at selected points of attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s small fleet of combat drones and loitering munitions is also providing its forces with additional strike capability. Russian Lancet and KUB loitering munitions are able to hold Ukrainian targets at risk across the battlefront to a depth of up to 40 kilometers. They can effectively penetrate Ukrainian airspace and operate in AFU rear areas to conduct ground strikes and aerial interdiction while Russian combat aircraft remain largely sidelined due to Ukraine’s potent air defense network. A decline in Russian drone supplies would likewise hinder such operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian drone operations in Ukraine are also limited by deficiencies in UAV capabilities. For one, Chinese civilian drones suffer from limited range and durability. They remain vulnerable to jamming and spoofing as well, reducing their utility and survivability. Russian drone operations have also been hindered by persistent shortages of Russia’s Orion combat drone, which has sufficient range, payload capacity, and endurance to strike targets at operational depth. Having more of these platforms would help Russian forces further degrade Ukraine’s air defense networks, precision artillery, and logistics nodes in AFU rear areas — though these drones are themselves vulnerable to Ukrainian EW and air defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electronic-warfare&quot;&gt;Electronic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHANGES IN FORCE POSTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian military has invested heavily in electronic warfare in an effort to maximize its control of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) on the battlefield. Building upon its impressive Soviet legacy in “radio-electronic battle,” Russia has developed a wide array of sophisticated EW systems in recent years. These include jammers and spoofers, electronic intelligence, advanced radars, electro-optical and infrared sensors, direction finders, and electronic countermeasures of various kinds. Russia has used EW to good effect in Ukraine to disrupt navigation signals and cellular communications, down drones, jam radars, and disrupt AFU operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although data on current inventory levels of Russian EW platforms are difficult to obtain, Russia has been able to maintain a sufficient number of EW assets to pervasively impact the EMS across broad areas of the battlefront, albeit with some limitations. Russia has also been able, at times, to mass its EW assets with paralyzing effect to support offensive ground operations. In May 2022, after the campaign shifted to the Donbas, Russia reportedly deployed around 10 EW complexes for every 20 kilometers of frontage. Collectively, these assets were used to disrupt navigation along the entire front, geolocate Ukrainian artillery, and conduct effective electronic attacks against Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian forces in Ukraine have lost a significant number of EW platforms, however, including several dozen platforms dedicated to jamming and spoofing, electronic intelligence, aerial surveillance, target designation, direction finding, fire control, reconnaissance, and counter-unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). Faced with such losses, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu met with defense industry leaders recently to increase the production of EW equipment used in Ukraine. Russia’s Rostec also announced recently that it will begin mass production of a new generation of EW and counter-UAS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, however, such efforts are likely to be increasingly challenged by sanctions on Western advanced microchips used in Russian EW systems. According to a recent report from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), Russia’s Borisoglebsk-2, an advanced broadband jammer, relies on a range of chips produced by Western companies, which it uses to process signals over a wide frequency range. Analysts also found Western chips in a Russian Torn-MDM signals intelligence (SIGINT) radio direction finder and a Fara radar system recently captured in Ukraine. Russian EW platforms are particularly dependent on specialized Western microchips, for which there are fewer external sources, so this is an area where sanctions are likely to be more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are significant gaps in Russian EW coverage, due to low production rates of certain EW platforms. Thus, in some areas, Russia simply does not have enough EW systems to cover the entire battlefront in Ukraine. This has left gaps in coverage in Russia’s air defense network, which Ukrainian forces have exploited, using drones to strike Russian ground forces or to cue artillery strikes. EW fratricide has also been a persistent problem, with Russian EW systems often jamming their own sensors and networks, forcing them to be taken offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russian EW platforms are particularly dependent on specialized Western microchips, for which there are fewer external sources, so this is an area where sanctions are likely to be more effective.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, Russian EW platforms also suffer from limited reach since their effects are often restricted to their line of sight. At the same time, Russia does not have enough long-range drones (such as Orion) capable of hosting onboard EW systems to extend their reach. This, in turn, is curbing Russia’s ability to penetrate Ukrainian airspace at sufficient depth to jam air defense radars, collect intelligence, and disrupt communications networks at the tactical-operational level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPERATIONAL IMPACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these shortcomings, Russian forces have thus far been able to maintain sufficient EW platforms to create pervasive effects, at times, across broad areas of the battlefront. Russian forces are using EW to degrade Ukraine’s communications, navigation, and ISR capabilities and to repeatedly deny Ukrainian forces access to significant portions of the EMS. Moreover, despite sanctions, Russia’s EW capabilities have continued to advance, as its defense industry is finding new ways to achieve greater effects on the battlefield. For example, Russian EW systems were reportedly modified recently to take down Ukrainian DJI drones that were previously less susceptible to Russian electronic attack. Russia has also refined the use of its EW systems, allowing them to jam Ukrainian military communications without affecting its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Moscow’s growing supply chain problems and increasing losses on the battlefield, coupled with more effective Ukrainian countermeasures, are helping to perpetuate persistent EW shortages. Should this trend continue, this could materially erode Russia’s ability to maintain tactically significant EW effects, thereby leaving Russian forces more vulnerable to Ukrainian strikes. As this unfolds, it would create further gaps in coverage and new opportunities for Ukraine to deploy its drone force into Russian-controlled airspace and to expand precision strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, Russia has been using its EW and air defense systems to effectively counter Ukraine’s UAV fleet, thereby reducing its situational awareness and disrupting kill chains. Russian EW, when combined with air defense, has been highly effective at this mission, reportedly eliminating up to 90 percent of Ukrainian drones after just a few flights. Russia has also been using EW systems, such as Palantin, to jam Ukrainian drones and prevent them from transmitting the coordinates of Russian ground targets to Ukrainian artillery. Other EW assets are being used to dazzle UAV sensors and disrupt flight control transmissions from their remote operators. The lack of quality target data from ISR drones has, at times, effectively sidelined Ukrainian precision strike weapons. Dense EW and air defense networks have likewise been effective in countering Ukrainian combat drones and loitering munitions. Although targeting data provided by Western intelligence sources has likely helped offset such effects, suppression of Russian EW platforms would allow Ukrainian UAVs to operate more freely in what is currently denied airspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y82uI7h.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A Russian drone-detecting radar station spotted at the Russian military base in Syria in September 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian EW assets are also playing a key role in Russian air defense networks, effectively limiting the role of Ukrainian ground attack aircraft by helping deny them access to airspace over Russian-controlled territories. Russia’s radio-technical forces have successfully maintained dense air defense radar coverage over the entire battlefront to facilitate surface-to-air missile strikes. Russian radar operators have also used EW to counter Ukrainian efforts to suppress these radars. Russian EW systems are also used routinely to jam airborne radars on Ukrainian combat aircraft and to disrupt their navigation and communications signals, to some effect, at times disabling them. Likewise, systems such as Russia’s Krasukha-4 are being utilized in an attempt to jam Western airborne and satellite-based radar signals and to disrupt communications. Suppressing these Russian EW assets would contribute significantly to efforts in hampering Russia’s air defense networks, providing more opportunities for the Ukrainian air force to access airspace over Russian-occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;long-range-precision-strike&quot;&gt;Long-Range Precision Strike&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHANGES IN FORCE POSTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s long-range precision strike systems, especially its best frontline theater cruise and ballistic missiles (Kalibr, Kh-101, and Iskander), have played a major role since the 2022 invasion. These systems have been used extensively throughout the campaign to strike high-value civilian and military targets in Ukraine at operational and strategic depth. At the start of the campaign, Russia relied primarily on the Kalibr, Kh-101, and Iskander missiles, which were expressly designed for the theater land attack mission, though it later incorporated other missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the sizes of Russia’s initial and current missile stockpiles remain unknown, Russia has reportedly launched several hundred of their best frontline missiles since the war began, and more than 5,000 missiles in total, as of April 2023. Missiles are typically employed using mass salvo attacks to stress Ukraine’s air defense network and ensure that a larger percentage of them reach their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, the rates of fire associated with Russia’s best frontline precision missiles have declined significantly. Accordingly, the Russians have likely been using their Kalibr, Kh-101, and Iskander missiles at faster rates than they can produce them, and this has significantly depleted their stockpiles over time. Estimates vary, but according to Ukraine’s defense minister, by November 2022, Russia had used 24 percent of its high-precision missiles, including 37 percent of its Kalibrs and 50 percent of its Kh-101 missiles — though the research team has been unable to confirm these numbers. The growing effectiveness of Ukrainian air defense systems is also taking an increasing toll on Russia’s missile stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As its theater missile campaign has continued, Moscow has been integrating other missiles into its long-range strike packages. These include the Russian Oniks, S-300, Tornado-S, Kh-55, and Kh-32 missiles, among others. However, many of these missiles were designed for other missions and were essentially repurposed for the theater land attack mission. More recently, Russia has been purchasing Iranian Shahed-136 one-way attack (OWA) drones, which have also been integrated into its long-range strike packages. At a price of as little as $20,000 per system, the Shahed-136 provides Russia a low-cost option to bolster its theater strike capability. Russia is reportedly acquiring another 6,000 of these systems, potentially for licensed production. Most recently, Moscow has renewed use of the Kh-47 Kinzhal hypersonic missile, which had been used sparingly earlier in the war. In this case, however, the Kinzhal represents an upgrade in capability based on its hypersonic speeds and its superior ability to penetrate Ukrainian air defense systems. This system is not invulnerable, however, as demonstrated by the recent downing of a Kinzhal missile by the Ukrainian Air Force using a Patriot air defense system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parallel with this, the defense ministry has been making efforts to increase production, with Russia’s missile manufacturers working three shifts per day. In May 2022, Votkinsk — manufacturer of the Iskander missile — announced plans to hire 500 workers to increase production. It is unclear as of yet whether production volumes are increasing, but Russia has had some success in sustaining production in spite of sanctions. For example, a recent inspection of Kh-101 missiles recovered in Ukraine found that they contained Western microchips that were produced during the previous two months, indicating that the missiles themselves were also assembled within this two-month period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/p9hbRoe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, visited the Raduga missile manufacturer near Moscow on February 2, 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Efforts to boost production could increasingly be hindered by sanctions, however, given that production of these advanced missiles relies extensively on Western electronics. Sanctions are also liable to limit Russia’s ability to add capacity, which is dependent on advanced Western machine tools. Production of Kalibr missiles was reportedly halted temporarily due to a breakdown in Western manufacturing equipment used in its production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPERATIONAL IMPACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift to a broader mix of precision strike weaponry has significantly helped to sustain the Kremlin’s long-range precision strike campaign. However, the growing use of missiles built for other missions, such as the S-300 air defense missile, has reduced the campaign’s effectiveness. Such missiles are not designed for the land attack mission and are poorly suited for it. Many lack the accuracy needed to hit their designated targets, with some missing them by a wide margin. Although they cause damage to whatever they hit, they are inevitably less effective in destroying critical infrastructure targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fluctuations in operating tempo characterized by changes in the frequency and size of Russia’s strike packages have likewise impeded the theater missile campaign, resulting in a reduced operating tempo on occasion, giving Ukraine more time to recover. Moreover, the growing share of lower quality missiles in recent strike packages is also reducing their effectiveness, due to their limited reach and ability to circumvent Ukrainian air defense systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key goals of Russia’s theater precision strike campaign is to support Russia’s ground campaign by destroying critical infrastructure targets directly supporting Ukraine’s war effort. This includes command and control nodes, defense plants, military training centers, air force bases, logistics depots, and similar targets. Further reductions in the volume of Russian long-range missile strikes — due to sanctions or production problems — would limit Russia’s ability to carry out this mission. At the same time, using less accurate missiles against such targets is likely to lead to lower success rates and more civilian damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key goal of Russia’s theater strike campaign is to help degrade and eventually suppress Ukraine’s integrated air and missile defense systems. This is achieved both directly by striking Ukrainian air bases and air defense nodes and indirectly by compelling Ukraine to deplete its remaining inventory of surface-to-air missiles. Notably, the latter mission is far less dependent on Russia’s most capable precision strike missiles (e.g., Kh-101). If the goal is compelling Ukraine to expend its air defense missiles, virtually any missile with sufficient reach will suffice. The Iranian Shahed-136 UAVs have been used to good effect for this mission, causing Ukraine to expend its limited supply of expensive surface-to-air missiles to destroy drones purchased at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kremlin’s theater strike campaign is also designed to impose costs on the Ukrainian populace, disrupt the economy, and shape leadership decisionmaking by striking (or holding at risk) critical civilian infrastructure targets throughout the country. Russian missile strikes against Ukrainian energy plants, oil refineries, and other civilian infrastructure have been a key component of this effort, raising costs on the entire populace. This mission is intended to undermine the economy, as well as the will of the Ukrainian people, while sending a message to them that there are no sanctuaries in the country. Unfortunately, for this purpose, use of less accurate missiles, such as the S-300, can still be quite effective since an errant missile strike in a residential area nevertheless contributes to the objective. A sustained reduction in the volume of Russian missile strikes would further impair Russia’s ability to carry out this mission, reducing the threat to Ukraine’s economy while helping contain the effects of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Kremlin’s theater strike campaign is also designed to impose costs on the Ukrainian populace, disrupt the economy, and shape leadership decisionmaking by striking (or holding at risk) critical civilian infrastructure targets throughout the country.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, Ukraine’s air defense network has been surprisingly effective at intercepting Russian long-range missiles. It is important to recognize, however, that it will be difficult to fully mitigate this threat given Russia’s ability to produce or acquire additional systems. Russia’s best missiles can maneuver, use decoys, and take other measures to avoid interception. Inevitably, a certain number of missiles are likely to get through. By the same token, using expensive surface-to-air missiles to intercept Iranian drones acquired at a fraction of the price is not a cost-effective tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impact-of-equipment-shortages-on-russias-ability-to-operate-in-other-areas&quot;&gt;Impact of Equipment Shortages on Russia’s Ability to Operate in Other Areas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section of the report assesses the impact of Russia’s cumulative equipment and munition shortages on its ability to carry out operations in other areas, even if the war in Ukraine is ongoing. This assessment is obviously preliminary in nature and limited to three potential conflict scenarios, including a potential intervention in Central Asia to restore stability, an expeditionary operation in the Middle East and North Africa, and a conventional military operation in the Caucasus, all of which take place in the next few years. The section concludes with a preliminary discussion on the prospects and timing for Russia to reconstitute its forces. All such assessments are, out of necessity, highly speculative and highly contingent on the circumstances at the time. Thus, the outcome could be quite different depending on the timing, the context, the stakes involved, the geopolitical conditions, and many other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;stability-operations-in-central-asia&quot;&gt;Stability Operations in Central Asia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Russia is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a military alliance comprised of Russia and five former Soviet states: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. The CSTO is a true military alliance with mutual defense commitments. In January 2022, just prior to the Ukraine invasion, Kazakhstan’s president requested CSTO assistance after armed anti-government protesters took control of parts of Almaty, the country’s largest city. In response, a Russia-led force made up of 2,300 troops from Russia and other CSTO member states was quickly dispatched to Kazakhstan. This included over 1,000 Russian regulars and airborne troops, as well as several armored vehicles. Their mission was to provide security, guard key facilities, and free up Kazakh security forces, who were then able to quell the protests and restore order. The mission was completed within a week and Russian forces were then withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Russian military should have little difficulty in carrying out a similar operation in Central Asia in the next few years, its losses in Ukraine notwithstanding. Given the small size of the mission, its limited scope, and the permissive environment, Russia retains the ability to carry out such operations whether or not the war in Ukraine is ongoing. It also retains the military airlift capability to transport and sustain a force of this size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expeditionary-operations-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa&quot;&gt;Expeditionary Operations in the Middle East and North Africa&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In 2015, Russia dispatched an expeditionary force to Syria to support Syrian government forces facing a wide array of armed rebel groups which had been receiving substantial external support. The initial contingent of the Russian military in Syria reportedly comprised roughly 4,100 military personnel, including one to two squadrons of Russian combat aircraft, several ground force and artillery units, a naval contingent, and a military transport unit. Russian forces established a forward-operating base at Khmeimen in Syria and commenced air strikes. Russian specialists also provided advisory support and combat support services for the Syrian army. This mission was sustained for several years, during which the composition of the force changed considerably, but this assessment is restricted to the initial deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Despite recent losses in Ukraine, Russia’s armed forces likely still retain the capacity to carry out an expeditionary operation of similar scope and character in the Middle East and North Africa, so long as they have access to suitable basing and a port on the eastern Mediterranean. Russian operations in Syria were centered primarily on an air campaign and took place in a relatively permissive environment. Russian ground forces were assigned to protect Russian bases in Syria, though they also operated in the field to provide advisory support, as well as limited combat and combat support services, for the Syrian army. Despite recent losses in Ukraine, Russian ground forces likely still retain sufficient capacity to carry out such a mission given the limited requirements. Likewise, the Russian navy and aerospace forces also maintain the capacity to complete this kind of operation, since their losses in Ukraine remain limited relative to the ground forces. Russia also retains sufficient military airlift and naval transport capacity, which — together with access to commercial shipping — should be sufficient to sustain such an operation, provided Turkey reopens the Bosporus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conventional-military-operations-in-the-caucasus&quot;&gt;Conventional Military Operations in the Caucasus&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenario:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In 2008, the Russian military carried out a brief but successful high-intensity conventional military operation against Georgia during the Russo-Georgian War. Operations were initially centered in South Ossetia (or the Tskhinvali region, as commonly called in Georgia) and Abkhazia, two breakaway provinces under Russian protection. Operations commenced with clashes between Russian and Georgian troops in South Ossetia, with the Georgian government seeking to reincorporate the two provinces into Georgia proper. Russia effectively crushed the Georgian armed forces in a five-day campaign, bringing overwhelming power to bear. To carry out the mission, Russia reportedly assembled a force of 25,000 combat troops backed by over 1,000 tanks and armored vehicles, artillery, rocket forces, and airpower. Although Russia prevailed in the war, it incurred significant casualties and equipment losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessment:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Russian military would be challenged to carry out a similar operation in the Caucasus without a high degree of risk, while the war in Ukraine is ongoing, given their high loss rates in the current conflict. Once the war is over, it would likely take a year or so before Russia could comfortably mount such an operation due to the need to restore its forces in light of the heavy tank and artillery losses and ammunition expenditures in Ukraine. Prior to this, such shortages could make it challenging for Russia to quickly assemble a ground force component capable of offensive operations comparable to the one it used in the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. Assessments of this kind are highly contingent, however. Unlike Ukraine, a conflict in the Caucasus would be less demanding given the small size of the countries in the region and their lack of strategic depth. Local militaries are also smaller and less well equipped. Thus, if vital interests were at stake, the Kremlin could probably assemble such a force, provided it had sufficient time to mobilize equipment and personnel beforehand. It would have to rely extensively, however, on reserve ground combat equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uO3WYCX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reconstituting-the-force&quot;&gt;Reconstituting the Force&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond these limited contingencies, Russian forces would be hard-pressed to undertake another conventional military conflict on the scale of Ukraine over the next few years. Russian losses in Ukraine are simply too great for Russia to manage an operation of this scale until the Kremlin has made sufficient headway in restoring its losses. Russia will need time to reconstitute its forces, and most observers agree that it will take many years to rebuild its ground forces, especially if Western sanctions remain in effect. Much will depend on how effective Moscow is in mobilizing defense production and on what kind of force it decides to build. The degree to which it chooses to rely on its vast weapons stores will also affect the time it takes to restore capacity. If Russia decides to try to build a more advanced force than the one it fielded in Ukraine, this would extend the total time needed to reconstitute its forces. If sanctions take hold more effectively, then Russia may also need technical assistance from China and other countries still willing to do business with it. As long as Russia maintains sufficient energy revenues to fund such activities, it is likely to find partners willing to share weapons and technology. Otherwise, it will have to rely more fully on import substitution — a challenging proposition given the state of Russia’s technology base. Most observers agree, however, that Russia will eventually succeed in rebuilding its military, with estimates of 5–10 years according to recent testimony from U.S. intelligence officials. Russian production rates during the most recent state armament programs provide some guidance on the defense industry’s production potential. For example, according to the Swedish Defense Research Agency, Russia was able to modernize around 185 main battle tanks per year between 2011 and 2018 and, as noted above, manufacturing has reportedly increased to around 250 tanks per year. But these figures do not take account of recent Russian efforts to expand capacity and ramp up production, which may eventually result in higher production rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;key-findings-and-conclusions&quot;&gt;Key Findings and Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the United States and its allies have made a concerted effort to support Ukraine through the provision of military assistance and the imposition of sanctions on Russia. Military assistance is centered on the provision of military equipment and intelligence sharing on Russian force dispositions. It has had the most immediate and visible effect, affording Ukraine the means to rapidly upgrade its own military and to vigorously contest Russian forces, resulting in heavy attrition of Russian military capabilities and extraordinarily high equipment losses. Sanctions have also had an immediate impact on Russian defense production by abruptly severing supply linkages with Russia, though their direct effects are harder to discern. Yet, there are numerous indications that sanctions are placing Russia’s defense industry under duress and making it harder to overcome capacity limitations. Numerous Russian media reports cite the need to increase import substitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attrition of Russian forces has substantially depleted equipment inventories, which in turn has undermined Russia’s ability to prosecute the war in Ukraine. Resulting equipment and munition shortages are eroding Russian forces’ fire superiority, limiting their ability to maneuver, and undercutting capabilities in other areas. Collectively, this is creating a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces to renew their counteroffensive, though it is not yet clear how long the situation will last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia is responding on both fronts, seeking to limit further attrition and to circumvent sanctions. Where possible, Russian military leaders have been reducing the tempo of operations in Ukraine, pulling back to more defensible positions, adjusting their tactics, and limiting munition consumption. Likewise, Russian defense leaders are taking extraordinary measures to ramp up defense production and replenish their forces. Due to the sanctions, this includes drawing Soviet-era equipment out of storage and sourcing drones from China and Iran. In essence, there are two separate attrition battles underway, both bitterly waged between Russia on the one hand, and Ukraine and its Western allies on the other. They include the war of attrition on the ground in Ukraine to decisively attrite Russian forces, and the global sanctions campaign to suppress Russian budget revenues and defense production. The results of these two contests could well decide the war, but the outcome still very much hangs in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the restricted nature of the data in question, the assessments in this report have had to rely, at times, on circumstantial or incomplete evidence. Nonetheless, this report draws several conclusions about the impacts of attrition and sanctions on Russia’s ability to prosecute the war in Ukraine and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-to-date-us-and-allied-support-for-ukraine-aimed-at-increasing-attrition-rates-have-been-very-effective-resulting-in-substantial-reductions-in-the-quality-of-russian-forces&quot;&gt;1. To date, U.S. and allied support for Ukraine aimed at increasing attrition rates have been very effective, resulting in substantial reductions in the quality of Russian forces.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attrition has taken a heavy toll on Russian forces in Ukraine, undermining their capabilities across the board. The impact on Russia’s offensive capabilities has been greater, however, than it has on its defensive capabilities. Moreover, the effects of attrition have impacted some weapons categories more than others, since Russia has been more successful in some areas in finding ways to resupply its forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attrition has taken a heavy toll on Russia’s tank forces, which have lost two-thirds of their frontline MBTs. Replacing them with Soviet-era models pulled from storage has partially offset such losses, but it has also reduced the quality of the tank force and significantly limited Russia’s ability to maneuver. Yet Russia’s maneuvering problems are not solely a function of the size and quality of its tank force. They are linked, as well, to deficiencies in personnel, lack of training and morale, poor planning and execution, limited leadership, deficiencies in combined arms operations, and other factors. Over time, these issues can potentially be rectified. Moreover, Russia still has thousands of tanks in storage that it could draw upon, although most of the remaining systems will likely require more extensive refurbishment before they can be placed in service. Moreover, Russia also has the potential to increase production, so it should gradually be able to replenish its forces, although it will take several years to fully reconstitute its prewar tank fleet. Thus, Russia’s potential to restore its armored maneuver capabilities should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waging a high-intensity war of attrition has taken a toll on Russa’s artillery units amid growing signs of depletion of their ammunition stockpiles. The latter is emerging as a major problem for Russian forces in Ukraine, which rely heavily on mass firepower to sustain operations, offset their deficiencies, and contain Ukrainian counteroffensives. Russia is drawing deeply on its munition reserves while its leaders are scrambling to obtain munitions from other countries. But it is not yet clear whether these actions will be sufficient to avert a serious crisis. The defense industry is also pushing to expand production of artillery and MLRS munitions but is facing capacity limitations. Over time, however, Russia is likely to increase production sufficiently to maintain a reduced though more sustainable rate of fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Russia has been able to maintain a relatively high tempo of drone operations despite significant UAV losses during the war, yet shortages persist. It has managed to do so by boosting production rates for some frontline drones, such as the Orlan-10 and Lancet, and even more so by importing UAVs in large numbers from other countries. The purchase of small Chinese civilian drones, including DJI quadcopters, has been particularly important for sustaining drone operations, while Iranian drones are filling gaps in other areas. However, Russia’s growing dependency on foreign sources remains a vulnerability due to the threat of sanctions and, to a lesser extent, the potential for reduced access to Chinese civilian drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also managed to maintain a sufficient number of EW platforms to sustain operations, despite incurring significant losses in Ukraine. Data regarding their initial and remaining stockpiles and relevant production rates are harder to come by, limiting visibility in this area. Yet there are reasons to believe that EW may be an area of vulnerability for Russia, given their high dependence on specialized Western microchips. Moreover, maintaining and replenishing such a diverse array of EW platforms is likely to present logistical challenges. Given their importance for Russian operations in Ukraine, more research is needed in this area to target Russian EW systems more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus far, Moscow has demonstrated an ability to sustain its theater strike capabilities despite heavy expenditures of its best frontline missiles (Kalibr, Kh-101, and Iskander). This has led to a decline in the use of these particular systems, though the Kremlin may be holding some in reserve for other contingencies. By shifting to a more diversified mix of theater missiles, hypersonic weapons, and OWA drones, the Kremlin has been able to sustain operations in this area, but at a cost of reduced quality and performance. Russia will face challenges in increasing production of new missiles due to sanctions and capacity limitations. But over the near term at least, it is likely to maintain enough missiles to sustain operations, even if at decreased frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-attrition-could-be-even-more-effective-if-carefully-tailored-to-the-situation-though-there-are-limits-to-this-approach&quot;&gt;2. Attrition could be even more effective if carefully tailored to the situation, though there are limits to this approach.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of attrition on Russian weapons and munition stockpiles varies considerably across weapons categories. For instance, Russian tank losses significantly exceed artillery losses on an absolute basis. Likewise, Russia’s ability to replace its losses also varies across the various weapons categories. Although drone losses are high, Russia’s ability to obtain replacements has been good enough to sustain a relatively high tempo of operations. By the same token, the impact on Russian military operations in Ukraine depends on the extent of the resulting equipment and munition shortages. Thus, the effects of attrition on Russian weapons inventories — and hence, Russian operational capabilities — remain uneven, affecting some capabilities more than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, it is important to recognize that Russian operational capabilities in Ukraine — with some exception — require integrated use of all the various weapon categories covered in this report. For example, maintaining fire superiority over Ukraine relies on a combination of systems. It relies not only on substantial amounts of artillery and ammunition, but also on adequate UAV coverage to obtain targeting data. It also depends on having sufficient EW and air defense assets for counter-UAS operations to prevent Russian artillery platforms from being targeted by counterbattery fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, not every Russian weapons category is equally important in terms of sustaining the war effort. In the case of Ukraine, Russian artillery is paramount since it plays a central role in Russian operations. Since the conflict has devolved into a war of attrition, artillery has become the center of gravity for Russian forces in Ukraine. Thus, suppressing Russian artillery fires (even if only locally), is of central importance for Ukraine, both for escaping the cycle of attrition and for providing opportunities to maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policymakers can potentially use such information to refine their strategy by focusing military assistance and sanctions in areas where they are most likely to achieve operational and strategic effects. As an example, focusing on measures to degrade Russian artillery capabilities has the potential to significantly undermine Russia’s ability to use mass fires to blunt Ukrainian counter-offensives. This could be done by reducing Moscow’s ability to obtain battlefield surveillance drones for target acquisition, by curtailing artillery ammunition shipments from foreign suppliers, and by improving Ukraine’s counter-battery fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Since the conflict has devolved into a war of attrition, artillery has become the center of gravity for Russian forces in Ukraine. Thus, suppressing Russian artillery fires (even if only locally), is of central importance for Ukraine, both for escaping the cycle of attrition and for providing opportunities to maneuver.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

The heavy attrition of Russian forces has substantially depleted their capabilities, creating a window of opportunity for Ukraine to renew its counteroffensive. However, it is unclear how long the window will remain open before Russia is able to replenish its forces sufficiently to shore up its defenses.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustained large-scale Western military assistance has significantly strengthened the AFU’s capabilities. As a result, the balance of forces in the war has shifted over time in ways favorable to Ukraine. Most importantly, the AFU is rapidly approaching parity in terms of firepower, and it has acquired certain advantages over Russia in terms of maneuverability. This is creating openings for Ukraine to seize the initiative and go on the offensive during the next phase of the war. But it is unclear how long this window of opportunity will last before Russian efforts to resupply and reconstitute its forces start to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Prolonged war in Ukraine, coupled with heavy personnel and equipment losses, will likely limit the Kremlin’s ability to conduct high-intensity conventional military operations at scale in other areas, at least over the near term.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More specifically, significant MBT and artillery losses incurred by Russia in Ukraine, as well as growing ammunition shortages, would make it increasingly challenging for Moscow to promptly deploy a well-equipped and sizeable ground force component — comparable to the one it used in the 2008 Russo-Georgian War — in other parts of the world. However, the Kremlin still likely retains enough capacity to conduct certain stability and expeditionary operations of limited duration, scale, and scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are multiple factors shaping the conflict in Ukraine — many of which are outside the control of Western policymakers — this report concludes by proposing several ideas for Western policymakers to consider in calibrating Western military assistance and sanctions to contribute further to the attrition of Russian forces in Ukraine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue to resupply Ukrainian forces with tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, and precision munitions at rates required to secure and maintain maneuver and firepower superiority over Russia and to set conditions to bring the war to a favorable conclusion as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider granting Ukrainian manufacturers rights to use selected Western technologies for licensed production of selected weapons systems, component parts, and/or ammunition needed to wage the ground war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Focus Western military assistance on degrading Russian artillery to help break the cycle of attrition, including counterbattery radars, airborne ISR, and secure battlespace networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provide platforms to suppress Russian EW and air defense systems to help Ukrainian drones and loitering munitions maneuver more freely in Russian-controlled airspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boost Ukrainian counter-UAS capabilities with short-range air defense and EW to break Russia’s artillery kill chain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bolster Ukrainian air and missile defense networks to maintain area denial against Russian combat aircraft and to sustain high attrition rates on Russian long-range missiles and OWA drones, although this will take time and will require concerted effort to ramp up Western production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate sanctions loopholes allowing delivery of civilian drones to Russia for use in the Ukrainian conflict, particularly drones produced by China’s DJI, which Russia uses extensively, although this will admittedly be difficult given the multiple existing distribution channels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tighten export controls and enforcement activities to block transfers of high-end microchips used in Russian EW platforms, including through illicit channels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GF6fFcH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（28日）踏入審訊第94天。何桂藍開始接受控方盤問，就岑敖暉於抗爭派記者會指若「暴政當道」，相信不論內容也會否決預算案，何認同立法會議員有權基於政治訴求否決財案，但認為岑說法有「謬誤」、「程序上講唔通」，因政府若回應五大訴求必在預算案反映。何舉例若撤回暴動定性，相信律政司就「洗少好多錢」；若重啟政改，當局進行全港性諮詢亦涉大量金錢。何又表明認為五大訴求中最重要是「雙普選」，因有了雙普選後其他事情可慢慢解決，並認為政府就政改「需要同全香港人一齊傾」。控方又引述抗爭派記者會上，梁晃維和岑敖暉談及否決財案時稱「我哋」等，指包括何桂藍，何回應不肯定梁所指，又形容是岑所相信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就何稱「攬炒」於2020年5月底已開始，何指是大部分2019年運動參與者的理解，不過在她眼中「攬炒」不是目標，而是「唔怕付出代價嘅心態」，故在其角度「攬炒冇話完唔完」。何亦確認，組織者從無給出新東會議共識等文件，亦不同意「李伯盧」撰文引戴耀廷稱協調於5月已完成，重申新東當時「有嘢未解決」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方引李伯盧文章問協調是否已於5月完成-何不同意&quot;&gt;控方引李伯盧文章問協調是否已於5月完成 何不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍昨完成8天主問，今開始接受主控萬德豪盤問。萬展示2020年5月11日由《立場新聞》發布、署名「李伯盧」的文章〈【初選聯署】立會有初選啦！但有無約束力？睇你簽唔簽名〉，何指當時不知誰是「李伯盧」。控方指何現在知道他是吳政亨，何說：「我唔知我係咪好留心咁聽晒（證供），我都唔知李伯盧係咪只係一個人定係一堆人咁樣嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/p4n9Ray.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 吳政亨（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文章提及「戴耀廷教授剛於訪問中透露直選協調進展……好消息當然是五區協調成功！」，萬問5月11日時協調是否已完成。何先指理解協調是揀選候選人參與正式選舉，只有在初選完結後才能完成；不過若是指初選機制的協調，何指就新東而言，並不同意5月11日時協調已完成，因當時就出選名單是「6」或「6+1」未有共識，自言對該問題「比較擔心」。但何亦認為，就何時投票、票站情況、「入唔到頭6名就唔選」等機制有共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;李伯盧稱候選人同意簽會運用協議書-何我會問篇文嘅作者啲消息喺邊度嚟&quot;&gt;李伯盧稱候選人同意簽「會運用」協議書 何：我會問篇文嘅作者啲消息喺邊度嚟&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就文章提及「所有參與會議的五區候選人都同意簽署協議書『會（積極）運用』基本法賦予權力，包括否決財政預算案」，何曾供稱第二次會議上就「會」或「會運用」未達共識。萬德豪問文中陳述是否錯誤？何說「我會問呢篇文嘅作者啲消息喺邊度嚟囉」，她亦不同意此陳述。何亦指，無印象讀過這篇文章，《立場》也無人向她提起或問及這篇文章，但相信當時《立場》有人知道她有意參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續指出，與會者於第二次新東會議同意使用「會運用」字眼，何不同意。代表何的大律師 Trevor Beel 一度起身指，該說法與控方證人區諾軒的證供矛盾，惟陳慶偉指審訊經常出現不一致的情況，並非辯方站起反對的理由。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/EoVkeP3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;單張指受壓迫者須將政權迫向鎮壓或讓步抉擇-何指不認為港府有主導局勢的權力&quot;&gt;單張指受壓迫者須將政權迫向鎮壓或讓步抉擇 何指不認為港府有主導局勢的權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續就何桂藍選舉單張發問，問當中「極權」是否指中國和香港政府，何指「你可以咁理解」，惟萬指其理解不重要，重要的是何的理解，何續說「咁嚴格嚟講香港政府又未去到極權呢個程度嘅」。就「面對極權，受壓迫者必須用最大力量將政權迫向『鎮壓』抑或『讓步』的抉擇」，萬再問「政權」是否指中共和港府，何指「我唔認為香港政府有主導局勢嘅任何權力」，同意單張亦提到「中共控制嘅傀儡，港共政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何重申理解攬炒是心態非目標所以喺我嘅角度攬炒冇話完唔完&quot;&gt;何重申理解「攬炒」是心態非目標：所以喺我嘅角度，攬炒冇話完唔完&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何早前稱5月底《國安法》通過時「攬炒」已經發生，何今解釋是指大部分2019年運動參與者眼中的「攬炒」於5月已開始；但在何眼中，「攬炒唔係一個目標」，「係一種唔怕付出代價嘅心態，所以喺我嘅角度，攬炒冇話完唔完」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，何談及的「攬炒」似乎是「心態（state of mind）」多於「事態（state of affairs）」。何回應指她一直也說「攬炒」是一種精神，「就係認知到自己都要付好嚴厲嘅代價，都要向前嘅精神」，但2019年運動參與者提到的「攬炒」則屬於「事態」，而「攬炒」一詞自6月起也不太常用，何自己亦轉用「破局」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何不同意本地打壓或國際制裁會加劇攬炒知道不會有35故單張僅寫爭最多議席&quot;&gt;何不同意本地打壓或國際制裁會加劇「攬炒」、知道不會有35+故單張僅寫爭最多議席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問政權「鎮壓」會否加劇「攬炒」，何一度指將政權迫向鎮壓或讓步的抉擇，是討論八九十年代東歐民主化過程時常用的說法，至於在香港，若政權選擇不妥協，在立法會語境便是會進行「大規模DQ」，或選舉後再做傷害議會合法性的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指之所以說「攬炒」5月底已發生，除《國安法》外亦因美國取消香港特別待遇，形容已上升至「國際層面」，故認為香港本地「無論發生咩打壓，都好難同呢個層面嘅東西去比較㗎喇」，認為控方說法不太準確。萬續問，若有更多國際制裁，會否加劇「攬炒」，何認為不會，指相比取消特別待遇較「細囈」，「除非你玩到（港元與美元）脫鈎㗎啫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問「讓步」的意思，何指單張讀者是一些已關注香港政治超過一年的普通人，「我相信如果睇到『讓步』呢兩隻字，嗰啲人會好清楚我所指嘅係乜嘢」，像是「民主化」的訴求，而雙普選是其中一樣。至於單張提及「爭取立法會最多議席，力爭主導權」，何不同意是指立會過半，重申過半不等於取得主導權，而因她知道不會有35+，故沒有寫「35+」，只寫最多議席，但強調望選舉結果票數可令民主派在政治局勢取得主導權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱爭取重啟政改-政府需與全香港人一齊傾-而非爭取個人想要的制度&quot;&gt;何稱爭取重啟政改 政府需與全香港人一齊傾 而非爭取個人想要的制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，何昨日稱在單張仍列出政綱是不想讓人誤會她的主張。惟李運騰指何應是指不想人誤會立法會可實現該些訴求。法官陳慶偉遂下令休庭，讓控方翻查相關錄音，小休時法庭書記播放昨日錄音，控方團隊上前聆聽。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;午休後控方播出相關部分，何提及列出政綱可讓選民看到其本身主張，但也不會誤會她參選是承諾可幫他們爭取。萬續指，何所指迫政權做抉擇的方式，就是透過取得35+後否決預算案？陳慶偉打斷問，如這就是控方的問題，那剛才為何要翻聽錄音？林卓廷發笑，萬解釋因他剛才的說法完全不準確。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在法官追問下同意，認為現行立法會制度無法落實倡議，而她望能「破局」，破除政府設定的限制。陳慶偉追問，而其中一個破局的方法是否決預算案，迫政府談判或建立何同意的制度（acceptable to you）？何重申不認為否決財案可直接迫政府回應，而她要求政府回應，亦不是為一個她本人想要的制度，解釋爭取民主化時，「無論呢度47個人定係每一個參與運動嘅人」，對民主化甚至雙普選的想像也不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「所以唔係話爭取到雙普選、然後佢落實雙普選，就完咗喇件事」，強調重啟政改一定是一個全香港一同參與的討論過程，無論公眾諮詢或其他方式，「所以我哋唔係話直接爭取一個既定嘅普選嘅制度，而係爭取重啟政改呢件事。只要嗰個政改嘅過程係民主嘅話，個結局、真正嗰個普選制度係點樣，可能未必係我而家想要嘅，但我哋至少要啟動呢個全香港人一齊傾嘅過程。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬續問，否決預算案是迫使政府與何討論的方式？何說「同我傾係冇用嘅」，萬再問是與抗爭派傾？何回應：「立法會唔係講緊選35個人入中聯辦或者同林鄭傾，政府亦都冇可能喺成場運動幾百萬人入面搵啲領袖傾完，啲領袖就會返去說服啲支持者，唔係咁嘅一回事」，何強調，「佢要傾，佢需要同全香港人一齊傾」，而到時他們這些所謂民主派政治人物就會以香港人身分或政黨、政治組織的身分參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑何桂藍無於論壇提35不可能-何不同意&quot;&gt;控方質疑何桂藍無於論壇提35+不可能 何不同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何早前亦稱，曾於初選論壇提及35+是不可能。控方質疑其說法，並逐一展示何於論壇上的發言段落確認。何主動打斷：「其實你想問返我邊度講不可能呀嘛？」，並指其中一段提及「正如可能頭先 Ventus 所講喇，可能好多嘅朋友就喺度問緊，到底35+有冇成功嘅機會呢？」，指劉頴匡此前曾頗詳細講解為何35+不可能，她這句是表達同意，但沒有再闡釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0WLZ3zg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 劉頴匡（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬質疑該句是一個問題，何不同意，指如從片段看到其語氣，其意思會非常明顯，而她接續亦轉入35-的討論。萬再指，何從來沒有在論壇說過35+不可能，何答：「『35+是不可能的』呢9隻字就冇喇。」控方其後轉問其他議題，何主動問：「真係唔使睇返劉頴匡講嘅嘢咩？」萬指如何桂藍想便這樣做，也可留待覆問，何續說「OK，你繼續啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指梁晃維及岑敖暉抗爭派記者會提我哋包括何桂藍等出席者&quot;&gt;控方指梁晃維及岑敖暉抗爭派記者會提「我哋」包括何桂藍等出席者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問及抗爭派記者會，就梁晃維指一旦進入立法會，「無論我哋係對政府嘅提案定係財政預算案去投下反對票，呢一個都係我哋作為代議士嘅一個合法權利……我哋亦都繼續提倡議會攬炒嘅路線」，萬指梁用「我哋」並非談及個人看法，而是所有人，何指不肯定梁提及「我哋」是指什麼。萬再指，但一般人會認為梁是談及召開記者會的人的看法，而何桂藍也是這個「我哋」的一部分，何指「都可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於被問及抗爭派會否按承諾否決財案，岑敖暉稱「我相信呢一度全部（人）都係好堅定……如果我哋能進入議會嘅話，我哋係會好堅定行使基本法賦予畀代議士嘅權力，所以答案係『是嘅』」，控方指岑說「呢一度全部」也包括何桂藍，何稱「呢個係岑生相信嘅」。陳慶偉指岑也有提及「咁我哋呢度16人嘅立場」，何指岑是談及簽確認書和反對《國安法》的立場，「呢一個係我哋喺會前傾過嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑稱不論內容均否決財案-何指有謬誤-因政府若回應五大訴求會反映在財案&quot;&gt;岑稱不論內容均否決財案 何指有謬誤 因政府若回應五大訴求會反映在財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦引岑敖暉其後稱，如香港已落實五大訴求、有真普選，「我相信我哋係會有磋商嘅空間」，但如仍是暴政當道、魔警橫行，「我相信我哋係無論咩內容，都係會否決呢一個財政預算案嘅」，指岑同樣用了「我哋」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TxaaBAw.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 岑敖暉（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍先指認為岑的說法有「謬誤」，指「五大訴求必然會喺財政預算案度反映出嚟」。陳慶偉問像「撤回暴動定性」如何在財案反映，何說「首先，喺我坐喺度咁耐以嚟都冇人問我睇嘅五大訴求係咩，或者我同唔同意五大訴求嘅」，並指簡單而言，「我個人覺得其實其他嗰四個（訴求）都唔係最重要，最重要係有咗雙普選嗰樣嘢，因為有咗雙普選之後，其他嘅嘢都可以慢慢解決嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續引岑的說法，指如「魔警橫行」是「需要撥款買武器」，又指2020年時警方已比2019年前「買多咗好多武器」，過去數年每年都會增購武器。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又解釋五大訴求如何反映在預算案，就重啟政改，何指選舉事務處或政制及內地事務局必然要「攞出一大筆錢」，因「全港規模幾輪嘅公眾諮詢」需要非常多錢。何又指若撤回暴動定性，「我相信律政司就洗少好多錢㗎喇」，旁聽席發笑。何並指簡單來說，預算案內有一部分為「管制人員報告」，每個政策局提交預算時未必會列出全部支出，但會在該報告交代該年計劃。何續指，如政府要回應五大訴求，而相關政策局無在預算案寫出來，「咁你可以問佢係咪會走數喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指總括而言，「我認同香港嘅立法會議員係有權利基於一啲政治訴求否決財政預算案，但係話不論內容都會否決呢，喺呢個 context，程序上係講唔通嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱新東從無會議紀錄和共識文件理解參與初選為交表一刻&quot;&gt;何稱新東從無會議紀錄和共識文件、理解參與初選為交表一刻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何今早接受代表林卓廷的大律師沈士文盤問。就協調會議，何同意有3類人參選，包括可提供票站的人、有意參加初選的人、及沒有表明出選意願的人，而當時沒有討論與會者必須參加初選，及參加初選者必須出席協調會議。沈士文問，因此參與初選的決定性一刻（decisive moment），就是填寫提名表格並向民主動力提交？何答：「我作為一個參選人，我係咁理解嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續同意，就新東而言，組織者從沒有給出協調會議議程、會議紀錄、及會議共識的文件。至於林卓廷名單的黃凱盈、吳定霖、郭㙟豐，何指不認得，但應沒有出席協調會議，並記得會上有民主黨代表，但不肯定是哪次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱新東決定將會議共識附在提名表格惟最終無相關文件&quot;&gt;何稱新東決定將會議共識附在提名表格、惟最終無相關文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何重申出席首次會議前，認為會上達成的共識或協議都應公開，解釋只是擔心如2018年民主派初選一樣「啲權責唔清唔楚」。沈士文問她是希望參與者遵守達成的共識？何指更準確是萬一像2018年時出現爭拗，「公眾都有一個基礎去分辨發生緊咩事、誰是誰非。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續同意，首次會議有討論要否達成共同綱領，但不肯定是第一次或第二次會議決定將會議共識以書面形式附在提名表格，她亦有此期望。何理解因表格會公開，故公眾會知道達成了的共識，惟兩次會議後從無收過該份文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何同意，對其後6月9日記者會戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議感到驚訝，最終提名表格亦無附上共同綱領。何指當時注意到不同區有討論要自行附上共同綱領，但「具體有冇人真係做呢我就唔肯定喇」，但後來在法庭得悉九東等候選人有交。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱新東有嘢未解決-以為有第三次會議但沒有&quot;&gt;何稱新東「有嘢未解決」 以為有第三次會議但沒有&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何同意，新東第二次會議有事情未解決，而會上討論「會」或「會積極」運用基本法權力的條款時，「當時除咗兩個人之外，其他人都好明顯冇乜興趣再參與呢個討論」，亦因時間不夠而轉至下一議題。何又指，當時應無很具體討論、但以為會有第三次會議，因「有嘢未解決」，但最終沒有，組織者亦無告訴她原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」是否對戴耀廷稱毋須簽協議的回應，何表示「我唔認為係對組織者嘅回應嚟嘅」。至於「墨落」是否邀請同意該兩點聲明（即會運用立法會權力包括否決財案，及在支持度不足時表明停止選舉工程）的候選人簽署，何指「其實都冇乜 invitation 出現過，如果你見到（聲明），咁你有興趣就加入」，並指理解加名的人不是說是否同意該兩點，而是指他們「會唔會做呢兩件事情」，強調「呢兩個立場係我認為需要向選民交代嘅立場」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Sz9lIEK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱理解會上討論共同綱領是會公開&quot;&gt;何稱理解會上討論共同綱領是會公開&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問，會上有沒有人表達如有協議應該公開。何指不肯定，但她本人沒有，稱「如果唔打算公開咁簽嚟做咩呀」。何並指印象中當時討論要否有共同綱領時，「就係討論緊一份會公開嘅嘢」，未必用「公開」字眼，但會用「要向選民交代」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問何是否因2018年的事不希望參與者「反口」，何指有無人反口「我哋真係控制唔到」，指當時不知道政府會「出咩招」，猜不到會否有人改變立場。何並重申認為2018年問題未必在是否反口，而是當時民主派選擇改變初選方向時，民眾無法知道他們的理據。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉表示不明白，問假設政府採取一些措施，選民如何知道候選人是因此而改變政綱。何指認為無需假設，「我相信呢個就係《國安法》造成嘅情況」，指5月底《國安法》出現時，有呼聲指「唔好搞論壇、唔好簽嘢」，不過她個人不認為是反口。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指戴耀廷稱毋須簽文件不符期望惟可理解&quot;&gt;何指戴耀廷稱毋須簽文件不符期望惟可理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，因此何知道戴耀廷為何在記者會稱毋須簽文件？何指她不知戴基於什麼考慮，亦不知戴與其他候選人有什麼討論，但的確與她一直期望不符；又指她只是基於對局勢理解可理解戴為何這樣做。陳續指，2020年的事與2018年無關，是關乎《國安法》，何不同意，指兩次共通點都是「協調期間突然出咗啲好大嘅轉變」，2018年就是一個「大家以為非常安全嘅人，突然有風聲話DQ佢囉」。沈士文表示完成盤問後，沒有其他被告盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;何桂藍指難言誰發起抗爭派記者會 稱曾邀陳志全出席但「食檸檬」&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;何桂藍指《國安法》令《基本法》成condom、若法庭認同爭民主化為顛覆是「攬炒」普通法&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4l6FqbE.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（27日）踏入審訊第93天。何桂藍繼續作供，就初選後抗爭派於7月15日召記者會及發聲明，何指難說是誰發起，而她曾邀請陳志全出席但「食檸檬」，形容對方「唔願意同抗爭派企埋一齊」。何又指，當時流傳參選人確認書會加入支持《國安法》條款，惟她認為是「掩眼法」，令政府毋須回應初選61萬票數民意。何強調是否DQ從不取決於有否簽確認書，故記招望指出毋須拘泥此事，並望民主派不論是否簽署也團結一致。至於會上岑敖暉稱會否決預算案，何指事前無討論亦不知岑會這樣說，會上亦無發言人；而她本人無承諾過否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，因不認為可直接迫使，不想助長兩者聯繫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，就鄒家成曾於論壇提到每個代議士都應以任何手段癱瘓議會，何認為「癱瘓議會」一直是建制派說法，她不認同被人扭曲或批評時要跟別人語言去講，但如「癱瘓議會」是指「盡責審義」，「我認同每一個代議士都應該要咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指利用選舉為政權製造麻煩激發政治張力&quot;&gt;何指利用選舉為政權製造麻煩、激發政治張力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供，就她7月14日發布的初選出線感言，提及立會選舉的戰役不僅關乎立會過半，「而關乎我們如何利用選舉、利用議會，激發出更大的政治張力。」被問「政治張力」的意思，何指如果民主一方的力量對政權來說是用一些以前用的手法就可解決到，就很難促成任何改變，因此要想辦法「製造一啲佢未遇過、未解決到嘅麻煩出嚟」，並強調是對政權來說是「麻煩嘅嘢」，「但對我哋來講可能純粹係憑心咁（在立法會選舉）投一票咁解㗎啫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何指，選前尚有「DQ嗰條線」，而當時認為政權會評估民主派勝算來決定DQ多少人，「民主派呢一方嘅氣勢有幾強，對佢最後決定DQ幾多人係有好大嘅影響。」法官陳仲衡關注她提及「利用議會」是指進入議會後做的事，何指當時不知道多少人可進入議會，故無一個清晰計劃，但思路與她剛才說如何激發更大政治張力是類似。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指預測大規模dq-認有plan-b但認為入閘前指定無意義&quot;&gt;何指預測大規模DQ 認有Plan B但認為入閘前指定無意義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，即將抗爭精神帶入議會？何指視乎李運騰指什麼精神。李指法庭比較關注何當時的想法，何續解釋當時預測「絕大部分嘅『Plan A』都會被 DQ」，亦預期非常多的「Plan B」也會因為他們反對《國安法》的立場而被DQ，「咁究竟係乜嘢人代表民主派出選，係一個好大嘅疑問。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，相信不被DQ的人知名度亦不會太高，但若仍有正式選舉、新東投票率高達七成，最尾一席也需要逾8萬票才能當選；而這些知名度不高的人若得到被DQ者的支持，也可能會被DQ。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指她最終有「Plan B」，李運騰問她有否「Plan C」？何指當時情況很混亂，到後期已有很多人報名參選，故她當時心態已是：「睇吓到時有咩人入到閘再去決定，因為喺入閘前，我去所謂指定一個『Plan B』其實已經冇意義。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何想說服市民展示意志重要-即使立法會面目全非亦非選民責任&quot;&gt;何想說服市民展示意志重要 即使立法會面目全非亦非選民責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何帖文最後稱「仍有很多說服的工作要做」，她指是說服選民而非任何當權者，重申當時選民認為「最安全」或者「打壓會冇咁勁」的情況是「反抗嘅一方唔好展示咁多嘅實力」，很多人甚至擔心「我投你，係咪會令你畀人拉呢」，或認為「我投一啲立場上相對冇咁溫和嘅候選人，我係咪就會令個立法會反而少咗民主派呢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何強調想說服這些選民，「展示呢個意志仍然非常之重要，就算最後因為我哋展示咗呢個意志而令到立法會面目全非，呢個都唔係我哋嘅責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;鄒家成論壇提每個代議士應癱瘓議會-官稱或可用共謀者原則&quot;&gt;鄒家成論壇提每個代議士應「癱瘓議會」 官稱或可用「共謀者原則」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就7月4日將軍澳的地區論壇，鄒家成的片段節錄曾提及認為入議會「打交」不止是他、而是每個參選的代議士也應做的事，又指就算有無《國安法》，每個代議士都應有心理準備「用任何手段，癱瘓每一個議會嘅進行」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指對其說話無印象。Beel 問到當時有人如說出何桂藍不同意的事，她是否可以表達不同意，何指不肯定節錄是論壇哪個部分，不肯定當時有無辦法回應。李運騰認為若只有一段發言，難以脫離背景（out of context）下指證（implicate）其他人，又指鄒家成作供時或會就此回應，現時看不到這句如何能指證其他人，不過陳慶偉即笑說：「Haha, possible.（有可能）」，並指該發言是7月1日後發生，「共謀者原則」或適用，Beel 回應這也是他的關注。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指若癱瘓議會指盡責審議-認同每個代議士均應這樣做&quot;&gt;何指若「癱瘓議會」指盡責審議 認同每個代議士均應這樣做&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指看過相關片段，何桂藍當時對鄒家成的發言並沒有反應，並指可問下一個議題。惟何主動說：「但如果個問題係我認唔認同呢句說話，我可以答喎」，何續指「癱瘓議會」一直以來都是建制派、中聯辦或建制媒體的說法，她不清楚鄒家成引用時是否建制派媒體的意思，但何本人「就唔太認同因為人哋點樣扭曲或者批評我哋，我哋就跟住嗰個語言用法去講嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「但係如果鄒先生當時係指緊建制派媒體嘅用法，which 我理解其實就係盡責審議、把握每一個提出質詢嘅機會，咁我認同每一個代議士都應該要咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指曾邀陳志全出席抗爭派記者會惟被拒陳不願與抗爭派企埋一齊&quot;&gt;何指曾邀陳志全出席抗爭派記者會惟被拒、陳不願與抗爭派「企埋一齊」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就7月15日的抗爭派記者會，有16人包括何桂藍出席。被問記者會如何召開，何解釋初選結果公布後，基本上所有出線者電話「都畀記者炸爆㗎喇」，並指與其各自見記者，一些初選時已一起拉票的候選人就決定「走埋一齊」，「一次過見記者就大家都方便喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/bYEkUmt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2020年7月15日 抗爭派記者會（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡指，但記者會只是由抗爭派出席。何回應，抗爭派與傳統民主派之間界線從來都是模糊，而當時「係有一啲人我哋邀請過但佢哋選擇唔嚟嘅，咁就係陳志全議員喇，因為食檸檬嗰個係我，佢唔願意同抗爭派企埋一齊」，陳志全被點名時微微皺眉，聽到最後一句時微笑，何並指陳無說明為何不願意出席。陳慶偉其後一度指陳志全有現身何桂藍的街站，何否認，辯方指現場或有陳志全的橫額，惟陳慶偉再指陳志全或沒有發言，但他應在場，何續說她當時身後也有李梓敬的橫額。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又指，「好難話邊一個去發起（記者會）」，形容選後見記者是一定會發生，「爭在你搵到幾多人一齊見」；而邀請誰出席是「邀請嘅人自己決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/s0F31T6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指抗爭者記者會望調強確認書是掩眼法憂令政府毋須回應初選民意&quot;&gt;何指抗爭者記者會望調強確認書是「掩眼法」、憂令政府毋須回應初選民意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，就記者會一開始便讀出、同日各參與者於 Facebook 發布的「抗爭派立法會參選人立場聲明」，是於開記者會前大家「早咗少少到然後一齊𢭃出嚟嘅」，何亦有參與，故很難具體說是誰寫；而聲明包含他們想傳達的訊息，即他們希望輿論關注的事情、想影響輿論的方向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明提及簽署確認書與否成為爭議，但「取消資格與否從來並非取決於有否簽署文件」。何指「確認書」是指正式選舉報名表格附上的確認書，解釋初選結果於7月13日公布後，相信最具新聞價值就是61萬的投票數字，但當時建制媒體很快就傳出新風聲，指當屆確認書會加入支持《國安法》的條款，故輿論焦點很快又轉（spin）為關注個別參選人會否簽確認書和被DQ。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「咁至少我，仲有一啲其他人當時嘅 concern 就係，咁政府咪唔使回應呢61萬民意囉？」故她當時理解記者會重點就是強調這是「掩眼法」，「D唔DQ從來都唔取決於嗰個候選人有冇簽確認書。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱期望民主陣營能團結簽署確認書立場-惟傳統民主派終無會面或回應&quot;&gt;何稱期望民主陣營能團結簽署確認書立場 惟傳統民主派終無會面或回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問即達成了什麼共識，何引述聲明一段：&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;我們一眾抗爭派在此聲明，無論確認書最終會否加入與國安法有關內容，我們均義無反顧的反對國安法。就著未來有關文件簽署的取態，我們將會約見泛民初選人作磋商，期望整個民主陣營能團結一致，毋負選民期望。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何表示聲明首句提及會公開講明反對《國安法》，可形容為「共識」；而就是否簽署確認書，他們希望整個民主派達致一個一致的立場，「即係假設大家想簽就一齊簽，如果大家都OK唔簽就一齊唔好簽，佢真係要攞呢個藉口嚟DQ嘅話就DQ晒全部人。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就聲明提及「就著未來有關文件簽署的取態，我們將會約見泛民初選人作磋商，期望整個民主陣營能團結一致，毋負選民期望」，何解釋他們當時算是公開邀請傳統民主派「可唔可以坐低一齊傾」有關簽署確認書的決定，並期望民主陣營能團結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何笑言印象中最終沒有舉行任何會面、沒有收到傳統民主派的回應，確認書亦沒有包含支持《國安法》的條款。惟何指當時輿論仍很執着於此事，「基本上每日都會問一次你會唔會簽確認書」，強調當時記者會意思是大家無需拘泥在此事上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱無承諾過否決財案迫政府回應五大訴求-不想助長兩者聯繫&quot;&gt;何稱無承諾過否決財案迫政府回應五大訴求 不想助長兩者聯繫&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就會上記者問及是否會按之前承諾，否決財案迫政府回應五大訴求，岑敖暉回應「我相信我哋係無論咩內容，都係會否決財政預算案嘅」。Beel 問何當時有否承諾過會否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，何指「exactly 呢一句冇」，指她在很多場合有講述為何應否決預算案，但不認為可直接迫政府回應五大訴求，亦「唔想助長呢兩者之間嗰個聯繫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並解釋，印象中與會者事前無討論否決財案，甚至沒想過記者會問，而岑敖暉或任何記者會上的發言者均不是抗爭派的發言人（spokesman），當時是由最習慣面對傳媒的人坐第一排，「邊個想講就示意攞咪講」。法官陳慶偉問，因此岑的發言只代表自己，不代表何？何指岑發言前，「事前係冇同我哋討論過嘅，我當時亦都唔知道佢會咁樣講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5GwxmMY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;岑敖暉會上稱會否決財案-何指事前不知道記者會無發言人&quot;&gt;岑敖暉會上稱會否決財案 何指事前不知道、記者會無發言人&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰一度問，何曾任記者，在召記者會前有否向與會者指重要的是傳達訊息，而不是被傳媒帶風向。何說「做記者同畀記者訪問係兩回事嚟嘅」，指她不是「跑daily」，訪問人可能是約兩小時討論很詳細的問題，故不會說有很豐富應對記者的經驗，但「記者問咩我認同係要直接作答嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於岑敖暉其後會上稱，望有初選結果後，民主派的路線分歧可以完結。何解釋，初選白熱化時確有選民印象是所謂抗爭派和傳統泛民之間有很多互相攻擊，故理解岑意指該些攻擊屬「路線之爭」，「初選本身就係為咗大家可以傾一個好啲嘅路線而搞嘅」；但初選後選民已作出其選擇，「咁所有出線嘅人就應該要聯合埋一齊去行動喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/PpFSmcb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（27日）踏入審訊第93天。何桂藍繼續作供，就選舉主任以反對《國安法》為由指她不擁護《基本法》，並取消其參選資格，何強調「我自己嘅眼中，我係擁護（《基本法》）」，因當中有很多權力相互制衡的內容。何質疑選舉主任是主觀判斷，又指《國安法》不受司法監督、僭越立法會職能，並透過納入《基本法》附件三實施，感覺《基本法》被架空，「好難好文雅咁講，但係《國安法》嘅出現，令到《基本法》成為咗 condom 囉。」何又指被DQ後，曾認為「入立法會嗰個唔係我⋯我就以為因為呢單嘢而坐監嗰個就唔係我喇」，自言「天真」；又認為最後大規模DQ是對民主派最有利，可破除大家對跟制度行會有結果的迷信，亦反映不一定要妥協自保才有好結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後問何，是否同意控方指控她意圖以非法手段顛覆國家政權。何回應時指理解中國大陸的邏輯認為要求民主化是「顛覆」，「但係如果一個普通法嘅 court 要 endorse（認可）呢個諗法，我覺得係攬炒緊普通法。」何今完成8天主問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何自言擁護基本法-惟選舉主任決定是主觀判斷&quot;&gt;何自言擁護《基本法》 惟選舉主任決定是主觀判斷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍今繼續作供，她最終被DQ，理由是不真誠擁護《基本法》，大律師 Trevor Beel 問她有何回應。何先指對香港政府來說，「『擁護』呢兩隻字嘅意思係經常變」，她指正常人對「擁護」也有自己理解，但記得就香港民族黨陳浩天一案，「擁護」的定義包括「embrace（信奉）」和「promote（推廣）」，直言「呢樣嘢對正常人嚟講已經好難理解，即係我擁護你仲要幫手推廣埋你先至算嘅」。翻查資料，判詞指出擁護《基本法》不僅指遵守，還需支持、推廣及信奉《基本法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「我自己嘅眼中，我係擁護（《基本法》），因為《基本法》入面的確係有非常多權力相互制衡嘅內容嘅」，但何指到了選舉主任手上，「即係你點樣決定一個人 em- 唔 embrace、pro- 唔 promote，我覺得呢啲真係主觀判斷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何質疑國安法不受司法監督僭越立會職能-架空基本法&quot;&gt;何質疑《國安法》不受司法監督、僭越立會職能 架空《基本法》&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又補充，選舉主任理據是她反對《國安法》因此她不擁護《基本法》，「但係《國安法》入面明明係講緊如果兩個法相衝突就以《國安法》為準。」惟李運騰即指《國安法》沒有這樣說。何回應「咁可能係京官解釋嘅時候提出呢樣嘢」，李指「我不認為任何人有這樣說」，但指不重要，這是何的印象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指「呢個容後處理啦」，並指另有條款是「國安公署係唔受香港特別行政區管轄嘅」，李運騰反問「是嗎？」，何說好像是第60條，Beel 說是62條。李重申不認為該條款與何所說的完全一樣，不過這是何的印象。何再說，「然後又話國安公署簽署嘅文件喺香港係有法律效力嘅，我唔記得 exact wording 啦，但國安人員嘅做法係唔經司法覆核嘅」，李再次說不完全是條文的說法，並問何是想說什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後一度欲說明第62條內容，惟陳慶偉打斷，指法庭不關注，再問何想說什麼。何指「我嘅意思係，即係我唔識法律啦，但一個正常人睇完呢啲條款，個感覺就係成份《基本法》架空咗囉，又唔受司法監督、立法會嘅職能佢都可以僭越埋⋯⋯最重要佢係透過附件三擺入《基本法》，今日擺《國安法》、聽日擺《間諜法》、後日擺《對外關係法》咁，真係好難好文雅咁講，但係《國安法》嘅出現，令到《基本法》成為咗 condom 囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何質疑國安法時遭官打斷-官指毋須深究法庭有限度&quot;&gt;何質疑《國安法》時遭官打斷 官指毋須深究法庭有限度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何欲繼續解釋時，遭陳慶偉大聲打斷，說「我不認為我們要深究這些（“I don’t think we need to go into all this.”）」，Beel 一度說認為法庭容許何回答，陳再大聲說「不，我不准她回答」。李運騰續指這是何當時的理解和印象，但到底想說什麼，何指是「答緊我係咪擁護《基本法》個問題」，惟李指何已回答她認為自己擁護《基本法》，故不同意選舉主任的決定。何一度再欲回應，惟陳慶偉再打斷，指知道 Beel 有困難的工作，「但法庭也有限度。（“…there is also a limit for the court.”）」Beel 續就另一議題發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，《國安法》第60條指國安公署及其人員依《國安法》執行職務的行為，不受香港特區管轄，62條指香港特區本地法律規定與《國安法》不一致的，適用《國安法》規定。至於第14條則提及，維護國家安全委員會作出的決定不受司法覆核。至於第57條則列明，國安公署為採強制和偵查措施，及司法裁判而簽發的法律文書在港具有法律效力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何曾以為入不到立會繼續議會抗爭便不用因此坐監-自言天真&quot;&gt;何曾以為入不到立會繼續議會抗爭便不用因此坐監 自言「天真」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後展示何桂藍7月30日的帖文〈是你們每一個人的一票起了作用〉，提及「收到被DQ的消息，說實話，團隊固然有所失落，但也不無興奮的聲音」，何笑言同意「團隊失落，我好興奮」，解釋當時原初也有想過「係咪真係要入去（議會）」，「但其實最後反正都係DQ或者畀人拉嘅話，早啲完，或者都係一件好事」，何又指，「我當時嘅諗法，如果入立法會嗰個唔係我，但而家睇返我天真啦，我就以為因為呢單嘢而坐監嗰個就唔係我喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何補充，「簡單嚟講就係我當時以為入到立法會、繼續議會抗爭，先會因為初選呢件事而畀人拉，既然我行唔到嗰步，咁應該就唔會喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱大規模dq反而對民主派最有利不一定妥協自保才有好結果&quot;&gt;何稱大規模DQ反而對民主派最有利、不一定妥協自保才有好結果&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就帖文提及「對香港而言最壞的情況，就是選舉『如常』進行」，何重申如很少數人被DQ，大家雖會知道不公義，但焦點也會迅速轉移至剩下的人，「咁立法會選舉就仍然會有非常多人投票，但嗰個票數好可能就反而 endorse（認可）緊一個好唔公正嘅選舉」，故認為該情況對民主派更加不利。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「運動精神是甚麼？攬炒啊。反抗，是求生的唯一出路」，何指當時DQ規模「真係好大」，同一日包括她和公民黨等十多人被DQ，可見所有光譜無一倖免。何指當時的確有很多民眾仍會覺得「哇D到咁，好失望呀，或者輸晒冇得贏喇」，因此何想解釋為何這個「跨光譜大規模DQ」是對民主派有利、對政權反而有損害的結果，簡單而言「政權行呢一步佢哋付出嘅代價都非常之沉重」，亦呼應選民對「攬炒」的想像。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何重申，「反抗，是求生的唯一出路」，是因整場選舉不停討論避過DQ和表態會怎樣，但她個人一直採取反抗立場，並認為最終結果反而是對民主派最有利，「即係話唔一定要縮、唔一定要妥協自保，先可以得到一個好嘅結果。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱大規模dq可破除跟制度行會有結果的迷信&quot;&gt;何稱大規模DQ可破除跟制度行會有結果的迷信&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於帖文提到這次大規模DQ，「完全將選舉作為『以神聖一票選出民意代表』的機制無效化，也將鳥籠式選舉吸納、消弭政治運動能量的功能完全扼殺」，何重申「鳥籠式選舉」是令很多人相信「跟住制度內嘅規矩、喺制度內爭取係會有結果」，但大規模DQ反而可令更多市民看得非常清楚，「只要政權喺現行制度之下佢有輸或者被挑戰嘅可能，佢其實係會直接破壞個制度，都要迴避個挑戰。」何續指因此她相信，「咁樣就可以破除到大家對『跟住制度行就會有結果』嘅呢個迷信，因為制度本身都係按照政權嘅喜好浮動咁變化。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問是否意圖顛覆-何如普通法法庭認可此想法是攬炒緊普通法&quot;&gt;被問是否意圖顛覆 何：如普通法法庭認可此想法，是「攬炒緊普通法」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 午休後向何桂藍指出案情，問何有否聽過被告任何無差別否決預算案、癱瘓政府運作和解散立法會的協議，何一一否認。Beel 再問何有否聽過迫特首下台的協議，何思考數秒後說：「咁喺條街都聽過幾十萬人嗌林鄭下台嘅。」李運騰指不只是說口號，而是被告導致特首下台的協議，何續回應沒有。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，何是否同意控方指，她當選後會濫用《基本法》第73條的職權，何回應：「我會形容我係想還原返個職能」，故不同意控方指控，她亦不同意當選後會無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，何是否同意控方指控她意圖以非法手段顛覆國家政權，嚴重干擾、阻撓、破壞特區政權機關依法履行職能？何停頓一會表示：「我可以理解點解喺中國大陸嘅 logic，咁樣係顛覆嘅，I mean 要求民主化呢樣嘢。但係如果一個普通法嘅 court 要 endorse（認可）呢個諗法，我覺得係攬炒緊普通法。」李運騰指理解何即不同意，何說：「喺呢個 court，disagree。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍完成8天主問-林卓廷一方明將盤問&quot;&gt;何桂藍完成8天主問 林卓廷一方明將盤問&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 表示沒有其他問題，何桂藍完成8天主問。何下午作供期間，咪高峰一直傳來雜聲，法官關注是否有人觸碰到咪，何並說：「唔好意思，希望法官可以處理一下，因為我份人比較易嘔，我依家已經唔舒服。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;代表陳志全的大律師馬維騉其後指沒有盤問，但望申請於下周二才開始陳志全的案情，陳慶偉認為合理，但不認為屆時能完成何的盤問。代表林卓廷的大律師沈士文則指會有約30分鐘盤問，陳慶偉續提議由於何桂藍感不適，可押至明早處理。惟何即說：「如果聽朝返嚟個咪都係咁我都係唔舒服」，又澄清「我係驚我將會唔舒服」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文續指，明早有事情要辦，望能今天處理。陳慶偉問他明早需時多久，沈回應於10時半完成，陳慶偉續指明天不早於10時半續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍稱期望所有民主派參選人均認識到-於立選承諾爭取是空頭支票&quot;&gt;何桂藍稱期望所有民主派參選人均認識到 於立選承諾爭取是空頭支票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方今亦就何的選舉單張發問，顯示有何桂藍和岑敖暉的相片。何解釋於7月尾設計，原用作選舉通函，但「未定稿就被DQ咗」，呈堂的是接近完成的初稿。何並指除岑的部分，其餘內容都是她所寫。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/u6iuo7X.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ 資料圖片：岑敖暉（左）、何桂藍（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;單張上提及「如果香港立會還可以正常議事，我們會爭取」，並列出何的政綱，但上面以「The truth is」的藍色字覆蓋並劃去。何解釋如立法會正常，大家在選舉當然關注候選人的政綱，但她將政綱全劃去，並注明「承諾爭取咩係空頭支票嚟」，形容是她對所有民主派參選人應如何看待立法會選舉的期望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問何說「我們」時，是否指她和岑敖暉，何重申「我希望成個民主陣營都有呢個認識」，因選舉通函某程度上也是提出一個主張，望其他人接受。法官關注讀者是否會認為這是二人的共同政綱，何解釋岑將其部分發給她，但她的部分未給岑看，而「提名期一完第二日就DQ喇」，岑終無機會回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱若dq仍打算公開通函-讓新東選民知道本身可以選一個點樣嘅人&quot;&gt;何稱若DQ仍打算公開通函 讓新東選民知道「本身可以選一個點樣嘅人」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問她如認為自己會被DQ，為何仍製作通函，何解釋當時打算被DQ就自行公開通函，想傳達的訊息是「政府究竟DQ緊一個點樣嘅候選人，如果政府冇濫用佢DQ嘅權力嘅話，新界東選民本身可以選一個點樣嘅人」，故當時「亦都係用一種真係去選嘅心態去準備呢份通函」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡一度問，何是否認為自己會被DQ，但不想岑敖暉被DQ。何重申當時判斷「有開過聲反對過《國安法》嘅人都一定會被DQ㗎喇」，並強調「DQ真係唔係我哋想唔想，我哋唔想都冇得避免，除非我哋徹底咁改變立場，但係咁樣參選都冇意義喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指年輕候選人被批無倡議只想反政府-故列出政綱惟非承諾可爭取什麼&quot;&gt;何指年輕候選人被批無倡議只想反政府 故列出政綱、惟非承諾可爭取什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又解釋，當時無論建制派或選民也會批評，很多年輕候選人「根本冇任何嘅倡議，佢哋只係想反政府」，而何雖認為承諾爭取只是「開出空頭支票」，但認為「有必要擺埋出嚟，如果我可以爭取、我可以倡議嘅話，我嘅立場係啲乜嘢，咁選民就可以見到我本身係主張緊啲乜；但佢哋同時唔會有所誤會，我將呢啲政綱列出嚟，係向佢哋承諾緊，如果我入到立法會我就會爭取緊呢一啲嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，同時她亦是表達，當民主派決定將議會作為抗爭陣地時，「其實個立法會本身係可以、或者應該要做到啲乜嘢，但好可惜我哋而家喺現行制度下係冇辦法做到。」Beel 問，若何想讓選民看到，為何最終沒有發布。何一度反問「我有冇擺上 Facebook？」，Beel 說他不知道，多人發笑，何後指印象中有，但應無再作修改。&lt;/p&gt;

This paper seeks to explain what is driving changes to land forces’ command and control, the enterprise architecture that best supports the emerging requirements, and the implications for how command is practised.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The maturation of an ecosystem of data bearers and data management tools means battlefield hyperconnectivity is now realisable for militaries. Forces that can leverage these capabilities are likely to secure a competitive advantage over those that cannot. However, adopting these technologies requires a series of changes in how land forces conduct command and control (C2). To that end, this paper seeks to explain what is driving changes to land forces’ C2, the enterprise architecture that best supports the emerging requirements, and the implications for how command is practised. The foremost drivers of change are that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Armies that achieve greater situational awareness will have a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Situational awareness is achieved by moving relevant data between both units at echelon and sensors and effectors to enable forces to converge their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data relevance must either be determined by pre-agreed prioritisation or by analysis conducted at higher echelon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency in data transfer must be minimised for control of effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency may be high for command of the force, but the picture must constitute as complete a data set as can be reasonably assembled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low-latency, high-bandwidth communications impose an unacceptable draw on power for most tactical units, which must support low-latency, low-bandwidth communication to maintain situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concentration of analytical capacity at higher echelons exposes the formation to an unacceptable degree of risk from long-range fires unless these elements can be dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dispersion demands the automation of a significant proportion of headquarters tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automation demands a bearer-agnostic heterogeneous data ecosystem for the force, the remotely accessible nature of which also makes it vulnerable to cyber attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any future C2 architecture must degrade gracefully and in a predictable manner under constant disruption of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Envisaging a single architecture that can support all requirements in future military networks is a mistake. Instead, it is better to design future land forces’ communications on three network types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tactical networks aimed at enabling lateral situational awareness, demanding high assurance, low bandwidth and medium-latency traffic. These are best delivered through mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A fire control architecture able to move ISR collection beyond line of sight through a contested EMS. This is best delivered by a bearer-agnostic heterogeneous network governed by a prioritisation stack delivering low-latency, high-bandwidth communications, theorised as a kill web.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;An operational command network through which headquarters can distribute orders and supporting information, and gather situation reports from across the force that require moderate assurance of access, can function with high latency and offers medium bandwidth. This is best delivered through a combat cloud, accessed through satellite bearers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the tactical situation means that these networks should not be fully integrated, it is critical that appropriate data can pass between them. What distinguishes them is their bearers and how data is managed on the system. It is therefore important that common data standards are used to enable information egress between these three network architectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of such an architecture would have some implications for how command is exercised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it would be important for commanders to exercise greater command discipline because the architecture would give them sight of (and the ability to direct) sub-tactical activity. Used properly, this access would be invaluable in helping them to allocate and distribute their resources and reserves. However, it would also be disastrous if operational commanders were drawn into interfering with tactical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure would also change how headquarters function because dispersion and disaggregation, while necessary to ensure survivability, would isolate teams and make it difficult for a chief of staff to maintain a headquarters battle rhythm. It would therefore be crucial for different teams to actively strive to collaborate and to contribute where possible, rather than standing up and down in sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system would also depend heavily on AI to drive prioritisation and assist smaller staffs to plan and fuse information. Trust in these tools would be critical and training would be required to ensure their proper employment. Most of the time, it would not be viable to have a human in the loop or to have personnel understand how AI reached its decisions. For this reason, it would be necessary for AI tools to have clearly defined purposes so that confidence could be maintained by assessing them against their results. Human supervision would remain on the loop to provide assurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assurance of the architecture would also be critical to ensuring that personnel remained confident in it. This would require active cyber defence, as well as a shift in mindset from an expectation of absolute security to an appreciation of relative security. The expectation should not be that the communications architecture is sufficiently robust to always operate at peak efficiency but should instead be anticipated to be continually disrupted. Troops must therefore use its benefits as a force multiplier rather than relying on its outputs as a crutch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, such a C2 architecture would render the EMS a plane of manoeuvre and the force’s posture would need to shift from minimal emissions to one in which emissions were continuous, but ambiguous. Force protection would depend on active enemy kill chain disruption rather than passive concealment. A beareragnostic approach would also mean that assurance of access to communications would need to be fought for and resourced. Units would proactively plan to fight for connectivity levels, rather than simply being forced from primary to alternative, contingent and emergency communications protocols based on adversary activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four primary factors drive the evolution of land warfare: arms; logistics; societal capacity; and communications. Arms development drives an evolution in tactics to employ and mitigate their effects. Gunpowder, for instance, progressively inverted survivability from being gained through elevation to being premised on separation and excavation. The development of new logistical capabilities determines the force size that can be sustained, the reach at which it can be projected and the speed at which it can move. Thus, the combustion engine drastically increased the tempo of operations. Societal structure determines the scale at which wars can be fought and thus its character. A society only able to generate warbands is limited in the ground that it can control, creating conflict dynamics that are driven by violence as a tool of influence and raiding being a primary function. By contrast, an industrialised society that can conscript millions of troops pushes conflict towards absolute ends. Meanwhile, communications drive the agility and complexity with which military force can be employed. For instance, it was hard to conceive of the synchronisation of operational theatres until it was possible to communicate between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it has become popular to propose that advances in technology lead to “revolutions in military affairs”, it is important to note that the actual introduction of emerging technologies into military service often takes 30 years before they mature enough to significantly alter the character of war. The machine gun, for example, had been in service for three decades by the time of the Battle of the Somme. The pace of evolution is sometimes faster, especially when evolutions in two or more of the factors align. Nevertheless, rather than viewing the advancement of military activity as being driven by breakthrough technologies, it is more realistic to argue that militaries adapt as a technology’s implications become sufficiently clear and the capability itself matures enough to allow for general adoption. The force that transforms the battlefield tends not to be the first to employ a capability, but rather the first to work out how to employ it at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When considering the emergence of hyperconnectivity, it is reasonable to argue that we are approaching the 30-year horizon at which the implications of the internet and personal mobile telecommunications are sufficiently mature to drive an evolution in the character of war. As with previous technological developments, it is not that data has not played a significant role on recent battlefields. Nevertheless, its use within land forces to date has largely replicated structures that were originally designed in an analogue age, or else represent niche components attached to legacy orders of battle. The military may have swapped out analogue for software-defined radios, but the layout, staffing and functions of a modern military headquarters is recognisable when compared with its equivalent from the 1980s. It has bloated as more and more novel systems and capabilities have been added, but the fundamental underlying structure and logic remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuity in the military contrasts with the transformative impact of hyperconnectivity in some civilian organisations. While the implications of having ubiquitous access to data have driven a great deal of military theorising about future warfare, the practicalities of power generation in the field, signature management and communications security have all limited the adoption of many civilian methods. Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that the force that is best able to structure and equip itself to most efficiently and securely use available technology will have an advantage over its adversaries. As with previous moments, adopting modern technology at scale can be done more or less effectively. The French, for example, attempted to gain first-mover advantage when they invented smokeless powder and, as a consequence, ended up with the least ergonomic small arms of the major powers. Their early lead was shortlived. It is important to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the existing literature on data and the modern battlefield fits into two distinct categories. The first comprises highly technical studies of network architectures, often examining specific new technologies like encryption methods and bearer types, and revolving around programmes of record. The second emanates from military concepts like Multi-Domain Integration or Joint All-Domain Command and Control, and tends to describe an end state of perfect situational awareness with very limited engagement with the practical limitations or technologies. The former, while grounded in reality, fails to explore how a force may change how it operates as a result of evolutions in communications. Instead, it focuses on refining existing capabilities or accelerating established processes. The latter presupposes that the technology will catch up with the concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to straddle the divide between these bodies of literature, this paper takes the developments in the technology and considers how they may drive changes in the structure of how land forces are organised and how they conduct command and control (C2). It sets out a conceptual framework for thinking about the opportunities that modern communications currently present to land forces, how a force might be organised to seize them, and the communications architecture necessary to support that structure. This is not a survey of existing programmes aimed at modernising military communications. While cognisant of the trajectory of Morpheus, Mercury, Zodiac and Theia, among others, a heavy focus on these projects and programmes risks making the articulated requirement deterministic. Nor should this study be considered an attempt at systems architecture. Instead, it should be viewed as an effort to draw the enterprise architecture of C2 in the land domain to best seize the opportunities on a data-rich battlefield and mitigate emerging risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on land forces requires some explanation, since modern communications architectures aim at linking the joint force and depend heavily on both the space and cyber domains. First, land forces face some distinct challenges when managing large data volumes. These largely arise from the significantly greater number of points that must be connected in a land force, the limited power available to soldier-borne systems compared with more platform-centric domains, and the interference that complex terrain generates. The changes in communications architecture also have domain-specific effects on C2 for land forces. So, this paper should not be seen as excluding the other domains. Some of the networks discussed are implicitly or explicitly joint, but their effects on how a force fights are discussed as they apply to land forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be contended that this paper is not primarily about C2, but rather command, control, communications and computers (C4). This is correct, but C4 as an acronym is deeply unhelpful. Command and control are related but separate functions. The former concerns the conception and dissemination of purpose among bodies of troops, while the latter comprises the direction of the implementation of plans in pursuit of the defined purpose. Communications and computers, by contrast, are not functions but tools. Thus, this paper explains how the evolution of communication and computing tools realistically interact with and alter the exercise of C2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth clarifying why a distinction is made between communications and computers. Since many communications devices are computers, this acronym is also unsatisfactory. The distinction is clearer if it is understood as that between bearers/networks and services/applications. The former is how data is moved, while the latter is concerned with what is done to it on a device. It is perhaps useful to explain this in relation to an everyday tool: the smartphone. A smartphone may use 3G, 4G, 5G or WiFi networks, which are different bearers. However, the encryption, decryption, presentation and input of the information being transmitted might be managed by a range of different services, including WhatsApp or Signal, which are distinct applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is structured in three chapters. Chapter I outlines some of the opportunities and risks that modern communications pose and how these pressure the force to adapt from existing C2 practices if they are to be correspondingly realised or mitigated. Chapter II takes the drivers outlined in Chapter I and breaks down the architectures necessary to field the capabilities described. Chapter III seeks to map the non-structural implications for how the force would need to adapt if it were to effectively employ the systems outlined in Chapter II. The methodologies for this work are diverse, but at its core the paper is based on real-world experimentation with emerging communications systems and observation of exercises and operations on which various communication systems have been tested and employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-drivers-of-change&quot;&gt;I. Drivers of Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To grasp how the exercise of C2 over land forces can adapt to best employ emerging capabilities or to mitigate the risks they pose to a traditionally structured force, it is necessary to understand how these capabilities exert pressure on the existing C2 architecture. This chapter outlines several opportunities and risks that are assessed to be drivers of change that the force must acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;situational-awareness-as-a-combat-multiplier&quot;&gt;Situational Awareness as a Combat Multiplier&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The miniaturisation of computing means that today’s battlefield is saturated with high-fidelity sensors and detections that can be retained and transmitted. The proliferation of digital systems means that the modern battlefield is data rich; the question is whether the available data can be accessed and exploited. The combination of radar, electro-optical, acoustic, electromagnetic, thermal and positional sensor payloads on vehicles and personnel is remarkable in terms of the distances at which enemies can be detected. This effect is magnified exponentially when multiple sensors can be fused on a given platform and interrogated algorithmically with edge processing, and is amplified again if the picture from these sensors can be shared. Historically, humans carried out and logged target detection and classification across the battlefield. Voice was the only way to disseminate this in real time, and there was a limit to how much of this information could be shared. Nor could it be rapidly updated. However, the automated classification of objects by sensors – combined with humans logging their own observations as data – allows vastly more detections to be available to be fused if the data can be collated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this data can be accessed, the situational awareness of personnel across the force would radically improve. Situational awareness may be defined as the extent to which a soldier understands where they are in relation to friends and adversaries, and what those around them are trying to achieve. Having better situational awareness than the adversary gives a force a competitive edge. To use a single example, a force in which each friendly entity can accurately track its own position and communicate this will give each soldier the ability to access blue force tracking. The inability to access blue force tracking imposes a wide range of constraints on operations. First, there is the temporal impact of needing to confirm that detected movements are hostile before delivering or calling for effects to be delivered against them. Second, there are the constraints that the need to deconflict fields of fire and axes of advance impose on manoeuvre. This leads to the imposition of boundaries between units, which often creates seams (and therefore weaknesses) in formations that the enemy can exploit. Third, there is the psychological constraint imposed on soldiers by the uncertainty regarding their exposure and the extent of support once supporting or neighbouring troops are out of sight. Blue force tracking would: enable soldiers to engage enemy forces more rapidly while reducing the risk of blue-on-blue engagements; increase the freedom to manoeuvre by allowing a force to have dynamic unit boundaries; and offer a soldier psychological reassurance that they are supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basis on which situational awareness may be described as a combat multiplier is the transformative effect it has on mission command. As originally conceived, mission command was premised on the ability of a soldier to use their initiative to improve their position in a manner conforming to a broader intent in the absence of centralised instruction. Of course, the risk is that multiple commanders exercising this judgement reach contradictory or conflicting conclusions based on the limited information available to them. The greater the situational awareness of all troops, the more context they have to confidently exercise mission command. This might be termed convergence. If mission command is premised on a soldier’s ability to maintain a trajectory without supervision, with situational awareness, soldiers should be able to converge to dynamically cover gaps and exploit opportunities in a manner that deviates significantly from initial plans without dislocating the force. In short, situational awareness allows the trajectory to alter in flight. Setting the conditions for convergence also reduces the interventions necessary from command, allowing commanders to think ahead rather than become fixed in cohering disparate actions across a force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring about this situational awareness, it is necessary for data to move laterally across a force. It is not necessary, for example, for the corps commander to know that an infantry section is moving left around an obstacle rather than right. But if this movement brings the infantry section into the field of view of a friendly unit under a different commander, then this section’s identity is highly relevant to these personnel. This is not how most legacy military communications architectures function. Traditionally, military communications are structured to allow data to flow up and down echelons. Where there is communication within a group like the company net, the architecture is usually a hub-and-spoke model in which data is passed upwards and then downwards between sections rather than directly across the organisation. The challenge is that large lateral data movements are not viable on the same network as large vertical ones in systems where one speaker is prioritised at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lateral data movement and convergence also poses a challenge for commanders because the accumulation of the same data gives a granularity to senior officers that encourages them to take a view and correct their subordinates’ activities. In a context where subordinates are exercising mission command, but their movements are visible to senior commanders, the risk is that the commander begins to try and exercise control, slowing down and confusing activity rather than increasing the precision of execution. An organisation that gives a section commander the same picture of the tactical problem as the company commander creates opportunities but also expands the capacity for commanders to misuse the fidelity of the understanding they have access to. Maximising situational awareness will increase combat effectiveness but must drive a different architecture for communications and a new culture of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;saturation&quot;&gt;Saturation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although situational awareness can be enabled through the lateral movement of relevant data, the capacity to process and understand information for units at the tactical edge is finite and the effects available to units in contact to exploit information obtained is similarly limited. Furthermore, as more data is accumulated, it can both improve the judgement and effects deliverable at an echelon while increasing the capacity necessary to process and use the information. Data is not in and of itself a force multiplier; it is only one if it is relevant, and establishing what is relevant to a given user presents several challenges. Moreover, data’s relevance has a shelf life. If the process of ingesting, analysing and determining the relevance of information is longer than the period for which it was relevant to a user, then the data has proven a capacity-wasting burden rather than a force multiplier. Historically, echelons have not only been divided by the span of their control but also by the temporal span of their interest. Higher headquarters ought to think further ahead and have the capacity to do so. The problem today is that a force that can accumulate information rapidly in the right place can converge effects across or between echelons to achieve a decisive advantage. For example, a missile fired from the brigade echelon may have a greater chance of striking its target if the corps can deliver a cyber payload against an enemy air defence system defending the missile’s target, which it may need to deliver using an electronic warfare (EW) effector held at the division, while the detection of the air defence target may have been achieved using national technical means. Conversely, the range of fires means that echelons are often simultaneously engaged throughout their operational depth. If the battlefield is saturated with high-fidelity sensors, the force that can get the right information from the right sensor to the right user has a significant advantage over one that holds but cannot transmit, process and act on the information within it. This is what concepts like Joint All-Domain Command and Control promise, but they often do not address the consequent risk of saturation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of saturation risk: analytical saturation; and bearer network saturation. Avoiding analytical saturation requires the prioritisation of information based on relevance to the end user. A plans cell, for example, likely requires the greatest possible volume of information to be available to them. Given the volume of data generated on a modern battlefield, there is also a strong argument for such functions to be pulled up echelon or delivered through reach-back, so that there is capacity to store and interrogate large volumes of data with sufficient computing infrastructure and analytical personnel. A tactical commander, by contrast, is going to be unable to analyse the volume of data from most of the battlefield, much of which will be of limited relevance to them. There may be many data points that are relevant to them, but they cannot be the ones finding them. Thus, data must either be brought to higher echelons, processed, analysed and then disseminated, or there must be a sift for data that is known to be relevant to a particular tactical formation at the edge using edge processing so that this can be prioritised for transfer to the end user. The answer is not one or the other but depends on the latency requirements of the given data type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bearer network saturation is inevitable if all information is attempted to be assembled all the time. The volume of data on the battlefield is expanding faster than the bearer capacity to move it. Prioritisation reduces the volume of data that needs to be moved from one location to another and prevents this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latency is another means of reducing the requirements on the bearer network. If there is no requirement for low-latency transfer, information can be routed inefficiently to fill up slack capacity or underutilised links, or held back for transfer once higher-priority information has been moved. Conversely, higher-priority information can be moved rapidly via any available means, even if this means suppressing the movement of lower-priority information. A good example here might be to contrast track quality data on an enemy air or missile threat with a routine situation report from a screening unit. Clearly, the former takes precedence. When one maps the prioritisations likely in a modern force, this does not conform to the order of battle. Thus, information may, in certain contexts, need to jump echelons entirely, move rapidly laterally between units, or else a commander’s information requirements may in fact justify de-prioritisation. Seniority does not necessarily determine the latency requirements for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way that saturation can become a critical threat to the system, and thus a driver for its design, is power consumption. Soldiers can only carry so much power. Processing and analysing data consumes a great deal and must be centralised. Transmission of large-bandwidth data over distance also draws on considerable power. For tactical echelons wishing to maintain persistent situational awareness, moreover, power consumption is a constant, whereas the ability to move information at low latency is an intermittent but essential requirement for critical systems. If the intervening elements have run out of power and are unable to transmit this data, the system breaks down. Conversely, if low-latency or higher-echelon critical information requirements route traffic through tactical units on a routine basis, they risk running down the force’s available power and leading to blackouts or creating a massive logistical demand for batteries. The need to avoid saturation is thus a critical determinant of how future C2 architectures must be structured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;precision-fires-as-a-pervasive-threat&quot;&gt;Precision Fires as a Pervasive Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, situational awareness may be a force multiplier, but constructing a relevant picture of the battlespace from a huge volume of data requires analytical capacity and power, which drives centralisation into headquarters. This was certainly how these challenges were managed during the War on Terror, when brigade headquarters grew attachments until they were orders of magnitude larger than a viable warfighting formation even in the 1980s. This situation is only possible because of the low threat from enemy fires in these environments. At the same time, the capacity to find such concentrated entities on the modern battlefield has expanded drastically because of the saturation of the battlefield with stand-off sensors, especially in the joint environment. Furthermore, the proliferation of loitering munitions and cruise and ballistic missiles – offering precise, layered and long-range fires – means that such facilities can be held at threat at any relevant operational depth to land forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pervasive threat of detection and long-range precision fires drives several structural requirements for the C2 infrastructure that introduce friction into the characteristics outlined above. First, there is a need to either be highly mobile or make an element’s signature minimal or ambiguous. Second, on the assumption that the adversary might be lucky even against the most disciplined of forces, the headquarters should be dispersed to reduce its exposure to fires. This may even mean the dispersion of headquarters functions between states or continents. Here, there is a tension between the concentration driven by the demand for analytical capacity and power to process the available data, and the need to be survivable driving the disaggregation of headquarters elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest irony is that the direction of long-range precision fires likely creates one of the foremost demands on low-latency, high-bandwidth communication and rapid data fusion and analysis for the purposes of fire control. At the same time, it is precisely these fires that render the establishment of the infrastructure to support such a capability most precarious. Again, therefore, there is a compelling reason to strive to be able to ingest, interrogate and use the data on the modern battlefield. However, the side that is able to do it most efficiently – with a lower signature, greater dispersion and likely more effective prioritisation – will have a competitive advantage that should grow as Lanchester equations make fire exchanges more unequal over time. Lanchester equations highlight how attrition constrains force projection so that as one force suffers greater losses, its relative loss at each exchange expands. They have proven highly unsatisfactory in assessing engagements for much of the 20th century, but the advent of mass precision may make them more relevant to future exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dispersion is a sensible approach to expanding survivability, but it poses major challenges for assuring a capability’s delivery. Once key functions are geographically separated, communication not only becomes vital for the exercising of C2 but also in the internal functioning of the headquarters. A dispersed force therefore begins to build in single points of failure. Whereas a headquarters with co-located functions can physically connect parts of its internal infrastructure (and, failing that, physically co-locate staff as a reversionary means of overcoming connectivity issues), a dispersed force becomes entirely dependent on its network. This renders it vulnerable to another kind of precision effect which modern sensors and targeting processes can make effective at long range: EW. The ability to interrogate the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) combined with the use of software-defined EW systems means that it is becoming easier to assess a target network’s characteristics, build a payload to achieve the greatest possible disruption and deliver it at reach in combat-relevant timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;interrogation-by-machine&quot;&gt;Interrogation by Machine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical enabler of dynamic and precise electronic attack is the employment of AI to support the creation of effects. This is also arguably the most effective means of prioritising bandwidth. Use cases for AI are often framed around the analysis of vast data sets. However, since assembling such data sets is often prohibitively burdensome for a deployed network, AI can depend on machine learning (ML) used at the edge to fuse sensor data on the originating platform and package what is sent to higher echelons or laterally to key users. Again, such judgements become the basis for managing latency too. An F35, for example, generates far more data than it can relay, but much of that can be centrally ingested once it lands and is plugged into an autonomic logistics information system (ALIS) terminal. The question concerns what cannot wait and ensuring that what is off-boarded moves with sufficient metadata to be useable by another system with incomplete information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ML-enabled reconnaissance and AI-enabled bandwidth prioritisation is likely to give a force a decisive situational awareness advantage because of the efficiency gains it offers in sensor performance. At its most basic, humans interrogating a sensor feed tend to distinguish signal from noise through the size of deviation from the background environment. ML-driven data interrogation is different. ML systems define objects by reference to unique characteristics, and deviation from those are therefore counted irrespective of magnitude. This can create problems. An ML algorithm trained to look for humans may, for instance, fail to classify a person walking underneath a cardboard box as such because it deviates from the prescribed definition. A human would, by contrast, note the contrast with the background environment and deduce what was under the cardboard box. However, in terms of sensor data, the implication of this difference is that ML algorithms will make detections based on far smaller – and less distinct – returns than a human. Thus, if appropriately applied, ML will significantly increase the range and accuracy of detections, thereby improving the fidelity of the situational awareness available to be transmitted across the force. The point is that a force that fails to capitalise on such capabilities risks being uncompetitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI also offers a support tool to higher headquarters for data ingestion and analysis, as well as the creation of courses of action in planning. It may also contribute to another form of situational awareness relevant to those exercising command: the ability to anticipate adversary moves. A good example of this has been demonstrated in Ukraine, where 18 Airborne Corps, monitoring Russian activity from space, is able to use AI to anticipate whether Russia is about to conduct offensive action by recognising artillery fire patterns. The use of AI in headquarters is also the most likely means of enabling dispersion as it would reduce the necessary size of a given staff element. The aim would not be to replace the commander or the supporting headquarters functions. Instead, by using AI to rapidly assemble the labour-intensive products that must underpin an assessment of a course of action, it would reduce the headquarters’ footprint. A good analogy is the introduction of satellite navigation tools used by drivers in cars. Prior to the availability of applications like Google Maps, ubiquitous cellular connectivity, real-time traffic-density data and algorithms able to compare viable routes, dynamic navigation while driving required a second person to work with a map, or the driver to stop the vehicle to look at one. Today, a single driver can leave the navigation to their phone, reducing the number of people required to dynamically assess viable routes. Drawing up a scheme of manoeuvre based on terrain and an assessment of adversary troop strength is something that AI can do, even if a human wants to select from the options generated and potentially tweak the eventual scheme. It is in these more basic functions that AI is likely to best enable the force, not in complex decision support tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two requirements for such a system to reduce a headquarters’ size and enable dispersion. First, data must be bearer agnostic. That is to say that for a headquarters to assemble the relevant information at the speed of relevance, it will need to accumulate data from a range of units that, transmitting over various distances in the face of differing threats and interference, will be communicating on different bearers. Some will be using civilian comms, others will be using high-frequency radio or satellite communication. Inputs from these feeds have historically been separate and required human integration. If a headquarters’ headcount is to be reduced, these feeds will need to be fused with human supervision, but not through manual data transfer between systems. The data’s format and language must be compatible so that systems supporting a headquarters can properly ingest the information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-attack-as-a-persistent-threat&quot;&gt;Cyber Attack as a Persistent Threat&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need to ensure that data can be transferred through multiple bearers and ingested by systems from multiple feeds means that the future C2 architecture is significantly more accessible than its predecessors. But such a system is vulnerable to cyber attack and, if it is to be useable, cannot be proofed against this. So long as humans are involved, means of access and interference exist. The protocols and permissions inside the system may limit the impact or scale of possible interference, but it will occur. Furthermore, any system that is accessible beyond line of sight can be targeted not just by an opponent’s military but also by their non-military institutions, vastly increasing the resource available to attack it. Again, the battlefield advantages of such a system drive its adoption to retain competitiveness even as it creates vulnerability. Appreciating that such a system will be attacked and that attacks will succeed, its survivability becomes a question of how well its borders in cyberspace are patrolled. Vigilant cyber threat intelligence, systems monitoring and incident response can maintain a system’s survivability even against the most persistent and aggressive adversary. The banking sector provides evidence of this: while a highly diverse set of actors continuously attack it, and intrusions and data loss occur, this threat does not fundamentally prevent the system’s functioning. The sector does, however, invest heavily in active network defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike electronic attack or precision fires, the cyber threat does not diminish in peacetime. Hostile forces are continuously tasked with infiltrating payloads against digital systems outside of an armed conflict. Far from this being the nefarious and irresponsible practice of rogue actors, the time it takes to reconnoitre a hostile network, gain access, design and deliver a payload, and establish a trigger mechanism, means that this is an activity that must be practised continuously. If it is not, then such capabilities will not be available when they are required. The result is that headquarters must be on a permanent war footing when it comes to network assurance. Detecting and closing intrusions is an ongoing commitment. This requires expertise that does not traditionally exist within militaries and means that while one part of a headquarters may be exercising, its cyber defenders are very much on operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilience-by-design&quot;&gt;Resilience by Design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the advantages of the processes already described in this chapter, it follows that breaking down an adversary’s communications architecture and monitoring to inform targeting are key collection priorities for any force. However, there are some misconceptions about the dynamics likely to dominate the future battlefield in relation to the contestation of the EMS. First, the prospect of a denied EMS has been widely hypothesised. While possible over a limited area for a limited period, total denial of the EMS is not viable because the emitters necessary to deliver such an effect are themselves highly vulnerable to strike. Conversely, however, there is often a conflation of resilience and assurance that is deeply problematic. Designing a communications architecture that is highly resistant to jamming and interference is a worthy but impractical aspiration. As software-defined electronic attack systems are twinned with AI and ML, it will become increasingly possible to deliver bespoke payloads that optimally target communications systems. The likelihood is that while total denial will be impossible, continuous disruption to parts of the EMS and the uneven interruption of transmission will be a feature of the future battlefield. It is also important to note that forces will want to minimise their signature under many circumstances and may proactively withdraw from networks to do so. They may also wish to practice deception and mimic the communications patterns of other force elements. For parts of the force, this may be critical to their survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The considerations outlined above present some serious challenges for an effective C2 architecture. First, some nodes may voluntarily withdraw themselves from the network, thereby severing pathways for information flow. Second, the adversary may deny certain pathways for periods of time or reduce bandwidth and increase latency of transmission, rendering kill chains unpredictable. Between friendly and adversary actions in the EMS, therefore, the risk is that a force expecting to have strong situational awareness will act in the belief that they have an up-to-date picture of the operating environment while lacking critical information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some technical and tactical requirements emerge out of this. Technically, it is necessary for a network to be built with the presumption that parts of it will not work optimally. In other words, rather than trying to build a completely assured architecture, it is better to have one that accepts that degradation is inevitable and degrades gracefully. Another requirement is that the system’s components can verify the latency at which it is operating and adjust prioritisation, routing and assessment accordingly. Third, it is vital that users understand whether they are operating with a current or degraded picture of the operating environment. A part of the force severed from blue force tracking, for example, has lost an advantage and the commander may expend resources to regain access to it. But it is critical that the commander knows that the connection has been disrupted rather than being forced to work this out only when the tactical situation confronting them differs from its representation on their technical systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactically, resilience demands that control as to exposure and participation lies with the user. This may also mean that a commander decides to instruct part of a force to reduce its connectivity, either in terms of its lateral or vertical integration, to minimise its signature. Units may also make these decisions themselves, but the network structure must function for those that remain connected even as parts of the system withdraw from it. Here, it is necessary to conceptualise the EMS as a plane of manoeuvre and – like all manoeuvre – activity in this space must be proactively planned and reactively adapted to based on the tactical situation. A network structure that presumes a single configuration and linear degradation from it is likely to be overly centralised and too easy for adversaries to map and target. So, resilience should not be defined purely in terms of the difficulty of disrupting the network, but in the tactical options that the network architecture provides to commanders. A resilient system is one that can be configured based on mission requirements, rather than having system requirements constrain mission planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ii-a-straw-man-command-and-control-architecture&quot;&gt;II. A Straw-Man Command and Control Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveying the drivers outlined in the previous chapter, some basic propositions can be put forward that determine the contours of a future C2 architecture. These may be understood as the system’s requirements, but also its constraints. The challenge, in some instances, is to reconcile conflicting imperatives. In such cases, forces may vary in how they choose to reconcile these variables, but will need to mitigate the vulnerabilities they accept through tactics. This chapter considers the architecture supporting C2; the next chapter examines the practice of command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The propositions emerging from Chapter I may be outlined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Armies that achieve greater situational awareness will have a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Situational awareness is achieved by moving relevant data between both units at echelon and sensors and effectors to enable forces to converge their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data relevance must either be determined by pre-agreed prioritisation or by analysis conducted at higher echelon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency in data transfer must be minimised for control of effects.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Latency may be high for command of the force, but the picture must constitute as complete a data set as can be reasonably assembled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low-latency, high-bandwidth communications impose an unacceptable draw on power for most tactical units, which must support low-latency, low-bandwidth communications to maintain situational awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concentration of analytical capacity at higher echelons exposes the formation to an unacceptable degree of risk from long-range fires unless these elements can be dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dispersion demands the automation of a significant proportion of headquarters tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automation demands a bearer-agnostic heterogeneous data ecosystem for the force, the remotely accessible nature of which also makes it vulnerable to cyber attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any future C2 architecture must degrade gracefully and in a predictable manner under constant disruption of the EMS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These propositions suggest that there are three processes with very different characteristics in play: command; control; and convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UYgnX4w.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: Network Characteristics Against Functions.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observing the distinct requirements of an appropriate communications architecture supporting each of these functions, it is possible to outline mature and emerging technologies that might be leveraged to deliver appropriate systems for future forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enabling-convergence-through-mobile-ad-hoc-networks&quot;&gt;Enabling Convergence Through Mobile Ad Hoc Networks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immense tactical value of a company net in which all soldiers in a formation can listen to a defined frequency, and those with transmitters can speak over it, should not be underestimated. The ability to provide situational awareness through passive monitoring, to coordinate actions where sections are beyond verbal range, and the capacity for commanders to clarify their tactical picture, all allow for a unit to adapt to overcome challenges in contact. There are some serious limitations, however, to traditional company nets. The fact that only one person can speak at a time limits the complexity of what can be managed. The pattern of transmission and receipt on such a system also allows the formation’s structure to be tracked in the EMS, allowing for the identification of command posts and support weapons. Furthermore, an attachment joining the company or transiting its battlespace cannot simply tune in to the network but must swap encryption keys with the company and, in doing so, must stop communicating on other frequencies. Thus, attachments like joint terminal attack controllers, tasked with communicating with aircraft, will be on a different net and be readily identifiable in the EMS. While this system worked well for the transmission of verbal instructions, it is not well suited to the ingestion, integration and dissemination of combat-relevant data. Militaries have sought to overcome some of these limitations with hub-and-spoke data management approaches, essentially using key elements of the network as data routers, analogous to a WiFi hub. The challenge with this is that it is limited in its flexibility and has single points of failure, both in terms of survivability and in terms of a bottleneck on routing and bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are technical solutions that are suited to the requirements of modern tactical formations, not least the mobile ad hoc network (MANET). A MANET is a network in which every connected device is also a router. As such, data can be routed dynamically in small packets through any and all available pathways around the network. This has several advantages. When someone authenticates themselves to join the MANET, they become an additional link in the chain, which can wrap around terrain. Because all communications are routed via multiple paths, nothing really stands out in the EMS. The size of each transmission is also reduced, leading to a wide area being covered in an electromagnetic haze, rather than having single points that have a clear behavioural pattern. Moreover, because all nodes are transmitting and receiving, it becomes possible to maintain accurate blue force tracking and to push information rapidly across the network or pull critical data from one point to another. Another critical advantage of a MANET is that it allows for the integration of the battlefield “Internet of Things”, enabling concepts like human–machine teaming. If a force places a sensor in a position, or if a vehicle is autonomously using its sensors to detect and classify objects, these can be shared across a MANET with human operators in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/2SQucfD.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: A MANET Wraps Around Terrain, Integrating People and Crewed and Uncrewed Systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to MANETs. First, they place the responsibility for configuring and inputting the credentials to join the network on the end user, pushing a training burden to them. Second, MANETs rely on personnel being team players and passing data to others, which means that there is a continuous power draw on all active nodes, limiting endurance. Third, the routing protocols involved are complex and, as the network increases in size, there is a greater risk of it being corrupted or losing functionality. While MANETs may provide a good architecture to replace the company net, therefore, they do not offer a means to connect the whole force. MANETs should enable lateral data fusion within defined geographic boundaries, irrespective of the composition of the force joining the net, but they are a tactical system that is not suited to stitching echelons together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to rapidly fuse a common operating picture and transfer key information points from one point within a company and its attachments to another offers the kind of situational awareness called for in the previous chapter. If all troops are equipped with software-defined radios, this can be supported by a robust, frequency-hopping mesh against which adversary EW neither has critical identifiable nodes to focus precise effects on nor the agility to carry out blanket denial. Accessing the data available does present challenges. In those forces that have experimented and deployed these kinds of tools, the usual interface is a touch-screen tablet mounted on the chest. This must be robust. It can be difficult to use in high-glare environments, or in cold or CBRN environments where soldiers must keep gloves on. It also poses a risk from a light discipline point of view at night and requires a further draw on power. But these are surmountable problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the MANET allows lateral data transmission to provide the situational awareness necessary for convergence, the question arises as to how detections are to be offboarded to the relevant echelon. Although the two architectures for this method are described later, it is important to identify what should be offboarded. For those platforms with multiple mounted sensors and the ability to have the returns fused for ML interrogation, there should be the ability to disseminate an automatic identification onto the MANET, subject to a human operator’s confirmation of the detection. Thus, a symbol can be placed on a coordinate and this data disseminated via the MANET, either with a regularly updated live location if it remains under observation, or indicating a historical detection once contact is lost. Human operators who identify a target could have several options for generating a detection on the system. It would be possible to have a voice-activated command in some circumstances. Alternatively, it would be necessary to create an icon, identify the type of object and drop it on the relevant location, with the object automatically timestamped. This would be viable in a pre-contact situation. Once in contact, operators are likely to avoid focusing on a screen and would either need to use a voice command to the device or verbally announce the detection over the net, to be marked down by members of the company not in contact. The point is that the input at this point constitutes a tiny volume of data comprising the grid reference of the identification, the classification (Red, Green, Blue, White + Pax/IFV/MBT, etc.) and a timestamp for the detection. The same tiny data packet broadcast from each device at fixed intervals could provide live blue force tracking. Thus, offboarding target information does not need to be raw data but rather very small volumes. Some data that is required for key missions, such as radar detection of an air object, cannot function on a periodic basis. For this live track data – relevant only to key nodes such as those associated with air defence or with the ability to offboard data to higher echelons – must therefore be prioritised for transmission across the MANET, and this requires the protocol governing the network to have a built-in bandwidth prioritisation stack. The order of the priorities must reflect the structure of the force and where effectors are held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point about time stamping and the half-life of the relevance of detections is worth highlighting as a limitation of such a system. In practice, it would likely be wise to have two layers on the mapping application: one for current (within a defined period) and one for historic detections, with the ability to swipe back through time intervals. This may help to prevent multiple detections of the same unit over time creating the impression of a vast enemy force and other distortions, but there is no complete technological solution to this challenge. It is therefore crucial that operators of such a system are trained to interpret what they can access appropriately. The system may act as an invaluable guide but cannot be wholly trusted. This is especially true in a context where the network may be under EW attack and therefore not function consistently. The overall point is that while technology may enhance capabilities when appropriately exploited, operators must still retain tactical proficiency and use the technology as a force multiplier rather than a crutch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest concerns about a system like the one described above is what happens when a soldier is killed and their body overrun by the enemy or they are captured. First, there is a clear need to be able to rapidly disconnect from the MANET, requiring a re-entry of one’s credentials to reconnect. In the case of a dead soldier, it would be necessary for any member of the MANET to be able to eject others from the network. It is also possible that a soldier who is captured may divulge their credentials. We may assume that a soldier must have a radio with the right frequency settings and enter credentials to request to join the network. Thus, there is an immediate two-factor authentication. A third, however, must be used to guard against the case of a soldier captured with their equipment. Here, those already in the network being required to approve joining requests could suffice to secure the network’s integrity. This is especially critical because it is important that a user remain credentialled even when they stop receiving or transmitting data, or pause onward data transmission. There are tactical reasons as to why a force may switch to only receiving transmissions or go comms dark. It may be to conserve power, reduce their signature or simply be caused by a break in connection due to terrain. Re-credentialling must be managed on the basis of reconfirmation at intervals, rather than automatically if someone drops off the net, to prevent an unacceptably disruptive process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;exercising-control-through-the-kill-web&quot;&gt;Exercising Control Through the Kill Web&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latency between the detection and effect of targets, and the precision and accuracy of strikes, will largely determine lethality on the future battlefield. Moreover, strikes on key targets invariably require exquisite capabilities, whether to find or hit them, and these must be husbanded. So, this part of the force must be under tight, low-latency control. For this to occur, the relevant headquarters must have a detailed understanding of the environment and fuse the returns from stand-off detection directly under its command, wider collection from the force, and the provision of collection from national technical means to prioritise and coordinate effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two challenges: the structure of the fire control headquarters so that it is survivable within the projected threat environment, and the approach to getting the headquarters the relevant information while disseminating its instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With regard to the process of moving the data, the best framework for understanding how such a network must operate is arguably the kill web. This is an evolution of the kill chain concept: the links by which target information must travel to complete a strike. The kill chain is judged by its efficiency (the fewest possible links) and latency (how quickly it can be completed). The kill web adds agility and therefore resilience to the concept by hypothesising that the information should move via the fastest available route, taking into account that certain routes may be denied at any given time. A further vital feature of the kill web is that although specific jumps within the web may be within line of sight, the end-to-end process is almost always beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from the starting point of the previous section, where companies and their attachments’ own battlespace within which lateral communication of detections are transmitted over a MANET, the question becomes how to route the information picked up across the edge and held within these MANETs to the fire control headquarters. First, the fire control headquarters is not interested in all detections. They are interested in key targets, formations and feeds of track-quality actionable information. Defining what constitutes these priority information requirements must be coded into the mission data files that govern how the force’s network operates. If a detection marked as a priority in the mission data files, or data that is flagged as top priority at the edge, enters the system, it must be routed to the point in the MANET where it can be moved onto a different network for further transmission. It must be possible for data to pass between bearers, meaning the data management system should be bearer agnostic. So, the first requirement is that the kill web comprise a heterogeneous network: one that can pass data between operating systems and through different bearers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data can jump out of the MANET once it is at a point to be passed upwards. For example, suppose a British Army Wildcat helicopter entered a company’s operating area and applied to join the MANET. On doing so, it received a detection shared via the MANET of an enemy manoeuvre element preparing to apply pressure to the company’s flank. Here, the Wildcat took this information from the MANET and transferred it to Link-16, allowing the data to be relayed via blue aircraft to the Link-16 terminal in the fire control headquarters. The fire control headquarters could then either direct its own ISR to track the target to set up a fire mission or instruct the Wildcat to do so with its sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xRDOMxQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: The Kill Web.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incidental use of additional bearers is one means of strengthening the kill web. However, the company would also need organic means for transmitting data. Suppose that some vehicles in the company had free-space optical (FSO) transmitters and receivers and that the fire control headquarters maintained a relay UAV above the brigade rear to which FSO comms could be passed. Here, the same process would apply. A detection by the company would be automatically shared with the vehicles able to communicate via FSO as part of the lateral movement of information over the MANET. At this point, it would be transferred automatically to the FSO bearer and transmitter via the relay UAV to the fire control headquarters. Other members of the company might have high-frequency comms or SATCOM to relay back as a reversionary method, albeit with greater latency. Data could be channelled back through many potential pathways. Some detections, like aircraft tracks, need continuous updates and exceedingly low latency to be useful. Thus, there is a need for the prioritisation stack to account for these data requirements in the pathway prioritised when there are higher-and lower-latency paths available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also the case that while distributed sensors may provide non-track quality detections across the front, the fire control headquarters is also likely to have a range of standoff and stand-in sensors under its direct command. These would include capabilities like ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) and air defence radar, as well as longer-range penetrating UAVs. These units would likely have their own low-latency links to the fire control headquarters. Many of these sensors would be tasked to confirm high-priority targets. The fire control headquarters would also draw on data from higher echelons, including national technical means and space-based capabilities. The headquarters must be able to receive data from a wide range of sensor platforms and bearers, accumulating it from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reconnaissance reports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imagery and synthetic aperture radar (SAR).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;EW baselines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Radar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signals intelligence (SIGINT).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Common air picture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open source intelligence (OSINT)/metadata analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each case, the force would collect a very large volume of data that – if accumulated – could be plotted and mapped. AI, comparable to Project Maven, could sift each of these data sets separately, providing a classification, location and timestamp. With a team of operators monitoring each feed, these detections could then be fused with AI, cross-referencing the classification, location and timestamp to confirm detections and track them over time. For example, if SAR imagery from space confirmed the location of an air defence radar and a GMTI track then started from the location, it could be assessed that the GMTI track was the air defence radar in transit. Upon its going stationary, the system could verify the new position through SAR imagery interrogation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this process is achieved, it should be possible to maintain a map with several layers of detection, including live tracks, confirmed and previous detections, anomalies, and blue and green forces. The headquarters can run two fire control cells from this picture: one for reactive management of time-sensitive effects, including air defence and close-support fire missions, and a second responsible for planning proactive strikes. In total, therefore, assuming that each of the functions described requires processing power, work stations, and a team to liaise with the units supplying the data, assessing and verifying the AI’s conclusions, the fire control headquarters could fit into 10 vehicle-mounted ISO containers with seven additional vehicles: one carrying a generator and fuel, one with the headquarters’ real-life support, one signals vehicle carrying fibre optic cables to connect the headquarters elements, two transmitters and two receiver masts, able to be set up at a distance from the headquarters. Held at operational depth, the ability to conceal such an arrangement appears eminently feasible. Consider, for example, a group of lorries in a requisitioned supermarket depot or a group of shipping containers. Alternatively, the headquarters could be set up in subterranean working cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ibrau0o.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: HQ Laydown.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated. Imint = imagery intelligence; Elint = electronic intelligence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analytical structure’s survivability can be compromised if it emits on a wide range of frequencies. However, the architecture described above envisages the headquarters receiving information on a wide range of bearers but transmitting separately. Transmissions to shooters – completing the kill web – may be divided into lower- and higher-latency sequences. The former demand almost instantaneous direction. This is best achieved with a low probability of detection (LPD) transmission to a relay and down to the battery. Higher-latency activity, like setting up a complex long-range strike, could be distributed via masked satellite uplink. There are a range of options when it comes to the bearer. The point is that it is possible to offset transmissions from the headquarters via fibre optic cable to a transmitter displaced from the headquarters’ location, and then to make those transmissions exceedingly hard to detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in a capacity to draw detections from across the force rapidly via the kill web to a concealable and survivable headquarters, able to obscure its own emissions traffic, and thereby optimally control fires across the force. The use of AI to enable small teams to scrape vast quantities of data, and for these different sets of detections to be fused, should enable the fastest means of coordinating a wide range of both detections and effects. By understanding the range of kinetic and non-kinetic fires being applied, the fire control headquarters may also issue warnings or orders to units so that they can exploit the impact or take appropriate countermeasures, like bringing down UAVs above their battlespace for the window of time when friendly air is traversing it. In Ukraine, for example, the US XVIII Airborne Corps headquarters could determine whether Russian forces were about to conduct counterbattery or preparatory fires using space-based collection and route these warnings to Ukrainian tactical groups in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these considerations that make proactive and reactive fire control distinct functions, as individuals working out these elements of a strike will be working at a different tempo to an air defence coordination cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although what is described above is highly centralised, some responsibilities could be delegated. For example, if guns were assigned as close-support artillery to a battalion, it would be reasonable for the headquarters to auto-clear approvals for assigned fire missions between the supported and supporting element. Thus, if the battalion loaded a detection onto their MANET and called for fire against it, this request would be routed through the kill web directly to the guns. But this should not be the normal route. First, it denies the headquarters information about the battlefield. Second, tactical echelons are at a higher risk of false positives if they are sensing beyond line of sight, as they have fewer sensor layers to compare. Third, for more capable munitions, of which there are limited stocks, tactical echelons are unlikely to know what is not yet in contact but moving towards them. Nor will tactical echelons fully grasp the severity of their position as compared with others and will therefore expend valuable munitions sub-optimally if given fire control over them. Thus, while appropriate for guns in close support, a centralised fusion process will usually lead to the best results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enhancing-command-through-the-combat-cloud&quot;&gt;Enhancing Command Through the Combat Cloud&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The functions of command are very different from the tight and time-bound exercising of control described above, and it does not make sense for command processes to be integrated with control mechanisms. Command is primarily concerned with determining the objectives for units, planning their activity and leading subordinates so that they have the confidence to execute their assigned tasks. If fire control is driven by the need for tempo, command is much more intimately concerned with timing. For example, if a commander decides to send a unit from A to B, their transit will take a fixed amount of time irrespective of how quickly the commander can make decisions. The relevant question, therefore, is whether the decision to relocate the unit was made at the appropriate time, not how quickly it was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important distinction between the processes is that fire control often concerns complicated tasks with lots of precise elements, but the tasks themselves are discrete and readily understandable. Command largely concerns complex tasks, in which a commander must 1) devise a logic to defeat the enemy while the adversary is also in motion and 2) communicate this to subordinates so they can improvise their activities without impeding the overall scheme. This requires more information to be assessed than simply where the enemy is and that information sent to subordinates articulates intent and context rather than just providing a set of instructions. Finally, and in some respects most importantly, the commander holds reserves and supporting capabilities, and they must determine when these resources are expended against what effort. It is important that commanders do not get sucked into the continuous and high-pressure task of exercising control. When they do this, it usually removes them from the place where they can maintain sufficient contextual awareness and analytical detachment to exercise effective judgement. A commander sucked into controlling their force is liable to be led by the nose, or to commit resources against the problem that currently commands their attention, rather than anticipating the problem ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows that the communications architecture for command differs from the requirements for exercising control. It is worth considering what must be communicated. First, commanders will wish to distribute orders, summarising what they are asking their subordinates to do – when, where and against what anticipated opposition – and determining the resources available to the subordinate implementing the orders. Second, a commander will wish to provide intelligence support relevant to the operations. This may include schematics of target buildings, assessments of what the enemy is anticipated to be doing rather than just what they are doing now, and contextual information for the subordinate as to their surroundings. Working up these plans takes time. Commanders are not continuously transmitting orders. However, these packages may comprise quite large volumes of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commander also requires key information to conduct their planning. They must have a reasonable picture of the battlefield, including the status and position of friendly units and the known and assessed locations of enemy units and what they are trying to do. They need their own orders, require an accurate picture of their supply situation and must be able to feel their troops’ morale. This creates an interesting set of architectural challenges. Commanders must circulate the battlefield as leading requires face-to-face engagement. To exercise judgement, they not only need information to be accumulated; it must be presented to them in a comprehensible manner and they should have time to consider the issue. Their decision-making tempo is therefore likely to be inconsistent, and the location from which they may need to exercise judgement is also not fixed. Another interesting aspect is that those receiving the orders require time to understand them, and this interaction is not a constant activity but likely one dependent on their availability based on the tactical situation and conducted at intervals. The fact that a commander must be mobile, but their large, dispersed staff cannot accompany them, creates a requirement for information to be transmitted and received at irregular intervals, and ideally for the recipient to determine when they receive the information and the sender to determine when they send it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communications architecture that arguably best supports such a system is the combat cloud, the concept of a remotely accessible data repository. Access to that repository could be achieved through a range of means, but satellite communication would offer a high-bandwidth, medium-latency, dependable, maskable and resilient way of uploading information to a shared environment and downloading it. Access to information within the cloud would need to be compartmentalised according to the authorities and permissions of the individual accessing it, and the individual would need to prove their credentials to access the information within their compartment. Nevertheless, such a system would allow components of a staff to produce their annexes while working in separation, for this to be downloaded and cohered by the principal planning group, uploaded, and distributed to subordinate units. It would also be possible to push supporting data like relevant imagery, mapping or J2 assessments forwards with these orders packs. For the forces required to implement these orders, they could be downloaded when a unit commander has the opportunity to access the repository. Once the data is brought onto the commander’s computer, associated layers of mapping, arrows and times could be distributed over the MANET to be available on each soldier’s interface. Such a model allows different parts of the headquarters to be situated at any distance, including support functions in the home base. The robustness of this approach has been demonstrated in Ukraine through the use of Starlink terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, the personalisation of briefing annexes to orders would have been impossible for a staff because of the time required as compared to the staff available. However, most of the data for generating these kinds of personalised information packs is generated collaterally during planning. Converting that data into packs is a feasible task for AI, ensuring that a commander’s intent is translated into clear visual instructions at each echelon, with the supporting written orders available to understand the “what” and the “why”. The mechanisms for this are already visible with ChatGPT when it is used appropriately under supervision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flowing in the other direction, the higher latency with which the headquarters needs to accumulate data to inform planning as compared with the short timeframes necessary for effective control can also allow reports and raw material to be uploaded when there is slack capacity in the network to avoid saturating the net. Thus, the headquarters should be able to accumulate a continuous stream of information from the battlefield, albeit with some lag between collection and receipt that would differ depending on the intensity of activity at the tactical edge. It is also reasonable to assume that the headquarters would be passed information from the fire control headquarters’ fusion cell as and when there was slack capacity on the kill web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6ACW7wf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Integrating the Three Networks.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Author generated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a tangible example of how this system could work, consider a logistics unit of four trucks waiting in a hide. They check in to the combat cloud via a satellite link at an agreed interval and receive an order to move to a cache position and pick up four shipping containers containing combat loads for a forward element and fuel. The most direct route to the caches’ location is attached to the orders and automatically populates onto the tactical interface in the vehicles. The logistics packet closes the satellite link and leaves its hide, reaching the cache and scanning a QR code on the shipping containers as they are drawn onto the trucks. The commander then reconnects via satellite to upload the time and place with the shipping container’s serial number and begins their route to the handover point with the element they are supporting. A pair of reconnaissance vehicles that had been simultaneously tasked with moving to the front join the packet as it moves forwards, having similarly received instructions. On entering the battlespace owned by the unit they are tasked with resupplying, the logistics group would request to join the MANET, indicating its presence and connecting to coordinate a point to cache the material. Once this was indicated by the receiving unit, the logs group could proceed to the coordinates that the unit commander marked on their tactical interface and cache the pallets from their containers. Following this, the logistics element could scan the QR code on the container, picking up its location, status and timestamp, and attach an indication that the load was now empty, distributing this over the MANET to the unit commander so that they know the supplies are cached and ready to be retrieved. At the same time, the situation report (SITREP) would enter the priority stack in the MANET to be uploaded to the combat cloud when a connection and bandwidth became available, so that the operational headquarters would receive confirmation of mission success and an update on the unit’s supply status. This would also indicate that the logistics element was available for tasking again. Because the cache point would be distributed across the MANET, units would know that protecting this point was important. So, attached elements like counter-unmanned aircraft system operators could have the knowledge to converge their activities to keep the area out of enemy observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iii-the-changing-practice-of-command&quot;&gt;III. The Changing Practice of Command&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architectures in the previous chapter have continuities and differences when compared with the existing communications that land forces use. Because the differences directly connect parts of the force that would have previously been separate, command relationships that would have been manifestly inefficient before are created. The consequences can be positive or negative depending on how the culture of command interacts with these opportunities. This chapter, therefore, seeks to outline some of the changes in behaviour and mindset that are necessary to exploit the system’s potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command-discipline&quot;&gt;Command Discipline&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure outlined above effectively breaks down the echelon structure as regards C2, as it becomes possible for the operational headquarters to issue direct orders to any part of the force while the force can call for effects from the fire control headquarters. Whereas the current hierarchical communications architecture would require orders at division to be disseminated to commanders, staffs and subordinates in that order, the outlined architecture would enable the division to issue orders to any required level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is dangerous. Suppose, for example, that the divisional commander feels uncomfortable with a gap in collection in the battlespace. Under the old architecture, an instruction to prioritise collection against this area would lead the staff to assess what assets remained uncommitted. Then, they would either task them or instruct a subordinate commander responsible for the battlespace containing the gap to adapt their dispositions. It would be for the subordinate to balance their responsibilities, and if they felt that covering the gap would endanger their existing instructions, they could ask the divisional commander for more resource or clarification of intent as regards the balance of risk to be taken and the prioritisation of tasks. Meanwhile, none of these deliberations would be known to the reconnaissance units being discussed who could therefore continue to focus on their assigned tasks. By contrast, it would be entirely possible under the new system for the divisional commander to see the laydown of the reconnaissance troops, select a unit and issue it orders to shift focus. This would solve the commander’s problem – apparently improving efficiency – without the reconnaissance troops’ commanding officer being aware of what their subordinates are now doing or why. Moreover, having insight into the tactical fight risks higher headquarters becoming obsessed by and drawn into tactical issues, losing focus on the operational questions that should be their area of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ability to reach around echelons is necessary because a strictly hierarchical C2 architecture is vulnerable and would not facilitate efficient data movement. However, it risks being disruptive without appropriate discipline from commanders. Another aspect of this risk is that it is entirely possible for a senior commander to saturate the force’s capacity. The fidelity of modern sensing should mean that an operational commander can get almost any question they ask about the physical disposition of enemy forces answered. However, this will likely draw on a range of assets whose returns must now be prioritised by the network and which are likely unavailable to carry out other tasks. It would therefore be easy for a commander to demand collection against too many targets and, in doing so, saturate the network and exhaust the available assets. Again, the risk is that the higher staff begins to interfere with the planning and execution of these activities to optimise them and becomes drawn into tactical decision-making to answer tactical questions. The question of how good a spectator the commander is arises as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used properly, the architecture described above offers significant benefits. For example, suppose a commander, through higher echelon collection, observes that the enemy is planning on thrusting a wedge along the unit boundary between two subordinate formations. First, the higher headquarters can pass this information to the subordinates, giving them the situational awareness to account for the threat. Second, the commander now faces a decision point as to whether to deploy reserves to bolster the sector or commit other assets like attack aviation to blunt the threat, thereby directly supporting the subordinate formation. Most importantly, understanding the supply status and disposition of friendly and hostile forces, the commander can plan what to do after the immediate set of fights. Ensuring that the opportunities the command architecture presents are appropriately supported demands training and the development of a culture of command that distinguishes between and separates out command from control, so that officers do not feel the need to exercise control to be in command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;disaggregated-collaboration&quot;&gt;Disaggregated Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architecture described in the previous chapter is intended to make command, not control, agnostic of distance to ensure survivability. Within this, it is eminently feasible for information from the battlefield to be aggregated in the homeland, fused with national collection and made available to the operational headquarters’ J2 shop. The latter may be working across two or three concealed locations (like underground car parks) in the corps rear and used to form briefing packs addressing the allocated commander’s information requirements. These might then be uploaded from the J2 cell and downloaded by the J3/5 cell in another location before being attached as annexes to the courses of action presented to the commander and their principal planning group, who might be in a mobile command post of two or three vehicles, carrying out battlefield circulation. This is not an optimal way of working and creates several frictions. Getting everyone on the same video teleconference at regular intervals is also likely to be unviable under this architecture. While it may be possible at irregular intervals depending on the situation, it cannot be relied on. The driver for this disaggregation is survivability, not efficiency. Nevertheless, as was demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic, such an approach is feasible even if not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges in disaggregated working is that when a system has an uneven and potentially disrupted tempo, it is possible for parts of the structure to be bypassed or forgotten. Suppose, for example, that a commander has an incidental question about something in their briefing pack relating to the enemy’s assessed intent. If the headquarters was physically co-located, the J2 cell would likely field this question. However, if contacting the J2 cell requires submitting a question via technological means, and there is a lag in their receiving the request and answering, then in many instances the inclination will be for the command group to use their best judgement and move on without consulting them at all. Here, there is a risk for the J2 cell that the absence of questions suggests an absence of demand: if the team goes quiet under this assumption, they will receive fewer requests over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overcoming the risk of progressive isolation requires an entrepreneurial culture in staffs and across the force. This is very different to mission command, which concerns the ability to continue pursuing a commander’s stated intent despite an absence of supervision or control. Entrepreneurialism is a capacity to examine the situation and determine what is to be done in the absence of clear direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relevance here is that a part of the C2 architecture may have fulfilled its role in the process and delivered against intent. The question then becomes “what can this component do to further the work of others, to strengthen their situational awareness, bolster their capacity and remain connected?”. The post most likely to be disrupted by this process is the chief of staff, as they can no longer function as an orchestra conductor. Instead, they become more like a jazz band’s sound technician, balancing the levels to ensure that all components align.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trust-in-the-machine&quot;&gt;Trust in the Machine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of drawing one’s commands from the cloud, compiled by a disaggregated staff spread throughout operational depth, risks making it profoundly impersonal. Moreover, although staff at higher echelon may have a high-fidelity picture of the battlefield, they are separated from its texture. The risk is that subordinates come to distrust their superiors’ decisions, feeling a lack of connection and the absence of shared risk. Battlefield circulation may help, but ensuring the continuity of trust also requires that subordinates who feel they need clarification or additional engagement regarding instructions can reach for it. Knowing that this is possible in itself likely alleviates the need for its use, but commanders and staffs must be empathetic to the personal connection that underpins trust between those in harm’s way and those directing operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trust issue is even more important when it comes to AI. Trust in AI is eminently possible. How often, for instance, do people independently corroborate that Citymapper and other route planning services actually offer the optimal course of action? The AI uses described in this paper – including route planning and the generation of staff work, bandwidth and data prioritisation, and sensor data fusion – all offer a substantial increase in efficiency but only if users trust these systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are barriers to this trust in a military context, including the consequences of failure and the unreliability of connectivity (and thus the available data on which a system is basing judgements). Theorists have also put forward unrealistic expectations, such as the need to be able to understand how an AI is making judgements, or the idea of having a human in the loop. The former is not possible because of the training burden involved. The latter defeats the whole purpose of the efficiency gains achievable through AI. There are some processes where a human must exercise judgement, but there are many where they may observe and only interfere if they judge there to be something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of trust can be managed in two ways. First, there is a need for AI tools to have a very specific purpose and for the outcome to be something that the operator can judge the success of. They need not understand how a result was reached, but if the result is clear then its accuracy will build confidence and the ability to perceive inaccuracy will also reassure. For planning purposes, this does require effective training for users as to what problems a particular AI tool will be effective at and how it is to be used. To take ChatGPT as an example, it can be a very useful tool if used properly for certain tasks. It can also prove highly misleading when used inappropriately for other tasks or if it is assigned to the wrong one. Training staff on employing these tools is important if they are to avoid having their confidence in the system damaged. A second requirement is that AI tools degrade gracefully and transparently. That is to say that when dependencies are not available, the user must be made aware that the tool is now functioning in a degraded state and understand how this may alter its use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trust issue relating to the architecture described in this paper is that of assurance. Cyber attacks are a constant threat and, when combined with EW, are liable to suppress, disrupt and potentially compromise parts of any architecture. If the user comes to believe that their system is compromised or has been interfered with, their confidence in it will collapse, which could have a negative effect on the system’s functioning that is entirely disproportionate to the actual direct consequences of a compromise or penetration. An organisation therefore needs to be actively protected by cyber defence specialists. It is also important that staff understand the scale and persistence of attacks on the network so that they do not expect a perfectly secure system, but rather a sufficiently secure and robust one to be depended on even if there are occasional disruptions. This requires a shift in how security is understood from something absolute to something partial. Establishing unrealistic expectations risks a breakdown of trust in the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-ems-as-a-plane-of-manoeuvre&quot;&gt;The EMS as a Plane of Manoeuvre&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legacy approaches to C2 tend to view signals as a support function, to have a primary mode of communication and to revert to a series of less efficient but more assured methods depending on the level of enemy interference. Furthermore, the instinct has been to minimise transmission to maintain concealment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper has essentially argued that the level of sensor fidelity on the modern battlefield makes concealment a highly temporary state. The extent to which being detected exposes a force to risk depends on whether the enemy can manoeuvre the information to the relevant effector and the confidence of their identification of the detection. This can be combated with EW and constraining the relevance of the information through displacement. However, both of these actions have an associated signature, which perpetuates the enemy having sensor returns on the formation. The force best able to share its information will ultimately have a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further proposition in this paper has been that communications must be assured; not through a sequential PACE (Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency) stack, but through bearer-agnostic data transfer to evade interference. Frequency hopping for line-of-sight communications can achieve this at the tactical level. For the kill web, using a range of different bearer pathways can help to achieve this. For the combat cloud, survivability is achieved by removing the requirement for both parties to be connected at the same time, thereby temporally evading disruption. It is nevertheless likely that an adversary can disrupt elements of these networks for limited periods of time, albeit at a significant cost in resource. In this context, the EMS must be understood as a manoeuvre environment – one that is actively contested and through which each side tries to assure its own links while denying the enemy’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regards the culture of command, these dynamics require a commander to articulate when and where they wish to prioritise the resources of their signals troops and where they determine the balance in utility between assured communication and signature management. Perhaps most importantly, a commander should not assume that a force will function on EMCON black – without comms – until in contact or on primary communications until this channel is disrupted. The former risks the force being severed from situational awareness and therefore being outmanoeuvred. The latter risks the force being shaped and targeted as its comms plan degrades through a predictable series. Instead, the assumption should be that the force will communicate dynamically, manage active disruption and try to preserve ambiguity rather than concealment as to its dispositions. The concentration of EW effects or shifting to EMCON black may provide a period where the enemy loses understanding of the battlefield and therefore achieves a shaping effect that may offer advantage. Similarly, if the force is dominating the other, then it can likely increasingly shift to a steady state of communications comparable to primary comms. Within this context, it is important that signals troops are involved in developing the scheme of manoeuvre and can advise on the options available to a commander as to when certain effects can be applied and when risk must be taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final element in understanding the EMS as a plane of manoeuvre is in using the tools described in this paper as a force multiplier rather than a crutch. Situational awareness offers competitive advantage, but access to it will be disrupted. Troops can devote effort to improving access, but if they lack it, it is critical that they do not stop operating in anticipation of its return. Instead, they must revert to appropriate tactics in periods of limited connectivity. It is this skill that offers the force resilience. Resilience is not about having a perfect system that operates optimally all the time; rather, it reflects the capacity for operators to maximise a system’s utility when it is operating imperfectly. This increased signals literacy likely creates a force generation challenge. An increased number of signallers at tactical echelons, however, offers troops both situational awareness in the EMS, and the means to fight for connectivity. The move of signallers from a support function to a key part of the combined arms manoeuvre system also requires an adjustment to culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past 30 years, almost all military concepts have aspired to bring data to the battlefield. Concepts like network-centric operations and systems confrontation warfare have emphasised targeting enemy networks to secure advantage. At the same time, programmes like the US’s Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or Russia’s striving to build a unified digital fire control architecture through Akatsiya, are all premised on mass data fusion and dissemination around the force. But the lived experience of operations has been rather different. In Afghanistan, in the absence of a contested EMS, it took years to give troops full motion video from their supporting UAVs. Data fusion was achieved through the deployment of hundreds of analysts to combat theatres. Actually deployed in combat, meanwhile, Russia has found its operators unable to employ its modern communications systems proficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a significant gap between theory and practice. This is not to say that communications have not improved over this period, but rather that the fielding of new communications equipment has been laborious, uneven and often resulted in a like-for-like replacement of older systems, with the force slowly adapting to exploit its potential. For example, 3 UK Division headquarters has a Link-16 terminal, largely used by its air defenders. However, while data from this terminal could be an invaluable source of situational awareness from a range of air assets, it is rarely integrated into wider targeting and planning cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper did not aim to provide a technical evaluation of the range of ongoing attempts to modernise parts of military communications. Instead, it has posited a set of drivers and the architectural responses to seizing the available opportunities that modern technology offers while mitigating emerging risks. One clear conclusion is that there is not one architecture; instead, there are at least three, differentiated by how data enters, is prioritised and moved within the system. Furthermore, the function of command is distinct from the exercising of control and requires a different architecture. A third requirement is to maximise situational awareness laterally between tactical echelons so that subordinates exercising mission command can dynamically converge effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separating out the functions simplifies network requirements in a way that makes it possible to fulfil them using technologies that are already mature. The three architectures identified in this paper (MANETs supporting tactical formations, a heterogeneous kill web for control of the fires system, and a combat cloud for the command of the force) are all realisable. However, establishing such a system requires adjustment to training and culture in how command is exercised. Commanders must be more disciplined and avoid interfering where the system gives them access to tactical activity. Headquarters must become better at disaggregated collaboration and being entrepreneurial, not work to a rigid tempo. Trust must be established between the AI support tools required to make this system work and the personnel employing them. This means staff officers need to be trained in how to leverage these tools and understand how they can be misused. It also requires AI tools to be closely tied to achieving specified outputs that can be understood, even if the AI’s workings cannot. The force must also be able to trust the resilience and assurance of the network even as it is contested, through graceful degradation and appropriate training to operate without strong connectivity. This requires active cyber defence. It also demands a more manoeuvrist approach to understanding the EMS, appreciating that interference is likely continuous and an issue to be actively combated, rather than an imposition triggering predictable procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significantly reduced C2 footprint and increased survivability are possible if the architectures described in this paper are realised. Situational awareness would likely also significantly increase the ability of the force’s components to act as force multipliers to one another, even while operating in a dispersed posture. Finally, a force using such an architecture would be able to maximise the effectiveness of its fires and maintain a high-fidelity sensor picture of the battlefield, leveraging sensor density across modern militaries. What is described is eminently possible; the question is whether forces have the agility in their procurement processes to seize the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;何桂藍談議會無用仍參選：意義做咗都未必搵得到，但唔做就一定搵唔到&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/F332rkt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（26日）踏入審訊第92天。何桂藍繼續作供，就立法會既然無法審議和倡議，「到底選立法會嚟做咩」，何坦言答不到，直到看到61萬的初選投票數字。何指在法律場合或許每件事都「有原因有結果有過程有動機」，但政治行動不是跟從此邏輯，「簡單嚟講就係意義呢家嘢，做咗都未必搵得到，但唔做就一定搵唔到。」何亦曾於街站指港人抗爭開啟了歷史變革的可能，她解釋2019年運動後，港人明白追求民主「冇可能永遠都安全，係一定會有代價」、無法迴避香港已無可能維持現狀的事實，亦意識到不能單靠領袖要自己「落場」貢獻，何認為比起大國博弈或地緣政治，這些人心的改變「先至真正令到變革有可能發生」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何亦認為初選意義是不論勝算或會否DQ，仍投選最認同的路線，若政府大規模DQ便「無異於宣稱香港嘅選舉其實同伊朗都冇乜分別」。何又形容，中共要香港走入「鳥籠式民主」，透過選舉吸納民意和民間政治能量，將港人困在無出路亦無法改變的體制內。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指現時審核制度自殖民地起使用-2019運動要改革整個制度&quot;&gt;何指現時審核制度自殖民地起使用 2019運動要改革整個制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供，甫開庭主動表示，就法官李運騰昨問「審議又唔得、倡議又唔得，到底選立法會嚟做咩呢」的問題有補充和更正。李運騰昨曾問何桂藍，若認為議會無法正常議事、無法影響政府政策，那她期望議員入立法會做什麼，何當時回應可用非常僅餘權力指出政府法案的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何今先指昨日曾稱有些文件或資訊「係做立法會議員先攞得到」，說法並非錯誤，但只佔很少部分。何並補充，一直以來所討論很有問題的財政審核制度，「其實由1840年代用到而家㗎喇」，而議員提私人草案必須先經特首批准的做法，1997年前亦已存在，只是「特首」換成「總督」，簡單而言現時仍在用的制度設計，「本身係畀一個殖民地用嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，因此2019年運動「從來都唔係爭取入到立法會做啲咩，或者立法會做到啲咩，而係要改革成個制度」，並指不止改革立法會，如雙普選就是指行政和立法機關也要普選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指直至看到投票人數始知初選意義意義做咗未必搵到唔做一定搵唔到&quot;&gt;何指直至看到投票人數始知初選意義：意義做咗未必搵到、唔做一定搵唔到&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「講到立法會乜用都冇，但仍然去選立法會係為乜」，正正是很多2020年時覺得「投初選冇意思、唔肯投初選」的人的問題。何續說，「好老實講，我相信喺2020年冇一個民主派嘅人士可以圓滿咁樣答到呢個問題」，而「我自己最老實嘅答案，你問我2020年搞咗半年搞咁多嘢為乜，其實我係答唔到嘅，直到我見到61萬（初選投票人數）呢個數字，呢一個就係當時根本冇人想像得到會出現嘅局面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續表示：「可能喺法律嘅場合，就係每樣嘢都好清晰，有原因有結果有過程有動機，但係政治行動唔係跟呢啲 logic 行嘅」，她提高了聲線：「簡單嚟講就係意義呢家嘢，做咗都未必搵得到，但唔做就一定搵唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱2019開啟歷史變革-港人知追求民主有代價無法迴避不可維持現狀事實&quot;&gt;何稱2019開啟歷史變革 港人知追求民主有代價、無法迴避不可維持現狀事實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就何桂藍7月11日的大圍街站發問。謄本顯示何桂藍提到現時面對非常嚴峻的打壓，但「我哋嘅抗爭亦都開啟咗真正歷史性變革嘅可能性」，Beel 問是什麼變革。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋有三點，認為經過2019年後，「全香港嘅人會有一個意識係，追求民主冇可能永遠都安全，係一定會有代價嘅」，而且2019年後，「冇人可以再扮睇唔到香港嘅問題，就算佢唔參與運動，都無辦法迴避香港已經冇可能維持現狀嘅呢個事實。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又重申，2019年運動令很多人意識到，無法再靠一個領袖或者代表，「佢必須要自己落場，搵到自己嘅方式去貢獻場運動」。何指，比起大家常討論的大國博弈、歷史性機遇或地緣政治，「我個人認為，我頭先所講嘅嗰啲人心上嘅改變，先至真正令到變革有可能發生。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;庭上播何桂藍大圍街站片-稱參選不因相信制度而是相信港人不會棄與極權對抗&quot;&gt;庭上播何桂藍大圍街站片 稱參選不因相信制度而是相信港人不會棄與極權對抗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後問 Beel 片段有多長，控方稱有39分鐘。陳慶偉說「我想看」，並指因何有談及戴耀廷，何即挨後椅背雙手攤開呈無奈狀。辯方早休後播放片段，除何桂藍外，亦有岑敖暉、王宗堯、朱凱廸、鄺頌晴、周庭、何韻詩和黃耀明發言。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍提及，有選民指看到羅冠聰離港感心痛，猶豫應否投票，「擔心咁樣係咪送我哋去死」，惟何指《國安法》下，無論運動哪個崗位也面對一樣危險，但「我哋由2019年嘅6月，我哋就一齊決咗志，做咗一個決定，就係無論如何都要同所有香港人一齊行落去」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，今次初選有三個重要意義，包括讓國際社會看到香港仍有多少人無懼國安法出來投票；送盡量多進步派、抗爭派入議會帶來真正改變；及在白色恐怖年代以可見的政治行動互相支援同路人。何並指，投票率是世界上共通語言，雖然香港從無真正民主選舉，但投票率是最好指標讓國際社會看到香港人頑強反抗意志。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續提及，若最後勝出初選的仍是不斷與選民講有35+就可落實訴求、或議會仍可有議政空間的人，「其實係乜嘢都冇改變到」；又指中共一直為香港寫好的劇本，「就係要香港一步一步咁樣走入鳥籠式嘅民主」，但港人抗爭行動打破了中共設立的「死局」，她參選不是因仍相信制度，而是相信香港人，無論面對多大危難也不會放棄與極權對抗，「與其我哋接受一個毫無未來嘅死局，點解我哋唔博一個未知嘅未來。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何解釋初選意義-是不論勝算或dq仍投選最認同的路線&quot;&gt;何解釋初選意義 是不論勝算或DQ仍投選最認同的路線&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問及何提到「乜嘢都冇改變到」的意思，何指7月中的討論已去到如果支持的候選人有非常高的被DQ風險，「咁你仲投唔投佢好呢」，因一直以來大家在選舉的慣性，就是要投勝算高的候選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何認為，「我哋就係說服佢哋違背呢個慣性」，即使明知支持的候選人很有可能被DQ，「都要喺初選照投佢」，因初選「去到嗰個位已經唔淨止係選出最強隊伍參與9月選舉」；又解釋《國安法》宣布後很多人擔心會取消正式選舉，故初選意義就變成「喺大家仲有得投票嘅時候，唔好諗佢最後嘅勝算、或者佢仲有冇得選，但係都要投你最認同嘅路線，投你最支持嘅人」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，如在此前提下，仍是對35+有幻想的人勝出初選，即是代表香港人「選擇咗繼續停留喺佢哋以往對於立法會或者對於香港嘅幻想入面，咁就乜嘢都改變唔到㗎喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指制度透過選舉吸納民意及民間政治能量-使港人困在無法改變的體制內&quot;&gt;何指制度透過選舉吸納民意及民間政治能量 使港人困在無法改變的體制內&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問及「鳥籠式民主」的意思，何指很多人對民主理解是一人一票、有論壇、選完後可「同啲官有問有答」，但何認為真正的民主是談及「成套制度」，舉例澳門也有選舉，但不代表真的可令民意影響政府施政和決策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「香港人一直都有票投，但係我哋對於呢個城市嘅規劃、個發展，對於公共開支到底點樣洗，我地有冇 say 呢？好明顯就係冇嘅。即係話佢（政權）透過選舉去吸納民意、同吸納民間嘅政治能量，然後將佢（香港人）困咗喺一個根本冇出路亦都冇辦法帶來改變嘅 institution（體制）入面」，而何說「一步一步咁樣走入」，是因「過去好多年嚟我哋一直討論點樣擴大個民主成分⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭傳譯主任一度未能翻譯，何桂藍主動提議譯作「to improve how democratic the system is」，指相信 Beel 明白。法官陳慶偉亦指「我們全都明白」，認為何是說被困在現行制度的四面牆內，又指當然明白有方法改善現行民主制度。何欲繼續回答，並表示：「但係而家（回答）係斷咗章嘅，我完埋⋯⋯」惟陳慶偉打斷說「Thank you」，何提高聲量邊疊聲邊繼續：「但係擴大民主成分唔等於民主咗嘅，完喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於就何提及更多抗爭派入議會，「抗爭到底」，何指是「去到佢可以抗爭嘅最後一刻⋯⋯可能係畀人拉，或者畀人DQ、冇咗個議席」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何估計若大規模dq會完全改變選舉遊戲規則觸發憲政危機&quot;&gt;何估計若大規模DQ會完全改變選舉遊戲規則、觸發憲政危機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後展示何桂藍初選投票後，於7月14日的 Facebook 帖文〈從61萬到200萬的距離〉，配圖為「初選出線感言」，提及：「接下來，不論面對怎樣的打壓、有多少人被DQ、由何人延續，抗爭派最重要的任務，是繼續說服溫和派選民，為何要利用立法會選舉，觸發憲政危機。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋若仍有選舉，取得最大票數就是很明確反對《國安法》的民意，並指7至8月時，大家仍觀望DQ規模有多大，而她當時認為「其實只要有DQ，哪怕只要DQ一個，場選舉已經係唔公平嘅選舉喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指如只DQ很少數人，因過去數年選舉都是這樣，大家已習慣了，民眾很快就會將焦點轉回「繼續為餘下嘅民主派候選人爭取議席」上；惟如果民眾對抗爭派的支持非常大，何估計北京和港府便會選擇大規模DQ候選人，「咁呢樣嘢就係一個各方都未見過嘅東西，無論係本地嘅選民或者當時關注緊嘅傳媒都會認為係有相當嘅震撼性。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「政府如果選擇大規模DQ、大規模篩選嘅話，其實就無異於宣稱香港嘅選舉其實同伊朗都冇乜分別㗎喇」，會造成合法性危機，並指當時觀察有溫和派選民想避免這些事情發生，而何希望說服他們。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，何指的憲政危機是指DQ抑或建制的反應。何解釋如大規模DQ二十多三十人、甚至更多，「咁佢哋就好難宣稱呢個DQ純粹係因為唔同候選人個人嘅政治理念，而好明顯係針對香港民主派嘅打壓」，而她形容為「憲政危機」，是因「佢完全改變咗立法會選舉嘅遊戲規則㗎喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇提盡力試文攻武鬥-何用盡書面質詢權力被阻止仍堅持提出主張&quot;&gt;論壇提盡力試「文攻武鬥」 何：用盡書面質詢權力、被阻止仍堅持提出主張&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，辯方今亦就何桂藍7月9日 Facebook 發布的片段提問，何指是她7月初出席將軍澳居民統籌的新東地區論壇片段，她節錄部分問答發布。被問議會中的行動路線，何提及過往很多「文攻武鬥」，但民主派議員或未「做盡」，舉例除陳志全和區諾軒外，其他議員提修正案數量未如理想，並指議會內仍有空間嘗試「文攻武鬥」，「我會盡力嘗試。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問何即是會做什麼。何指以她理解，當時的確有民主派議員覺得「反正入咗 CSA（修正案）都畀（時任立法會主席）梁君彥 strike down 㗎喇，咁所以佢哋就覺得唔需要做呢啲嘢喇」，惟何認為至少提出問題是讓公眾知道的機會；而如公眾認為問題應該問，而梁君彥強行排除，「咁公眾都會覺得係梁君彥嘅問題。」何強調因此即使無法審核預算案，但只要仍有提出修正案或提出書面質詢的權力，「我哋都應該要盡用佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問「武鬥」是否指肢體抗爭，何指「文攻武鬥」是過去數年大家討論立法會時的術語，重申「如果我哋畀人熄咪而保安已經衝緊埋嚟，唔等於我哋就要放棄我哋當刻要講嘅嘢」，強調若她成為議員，不論是否有用，「我就有一個責任，即使畀人用一啲肢體上嘅方式阻止，我都應該要提出我當刻應該要提出嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在論壇亦提及，政府前一日就「光時」發聲明，像突然頒布新法律去定義，但她認為「呢個明明係我哋呢場運動非常核心嘅精神，佢只能夠係由人民去定義」。何在法官追問下，指《國安法》實施首日拘捕了將「光復香港 時代革命」旗幟插在電單車的人士，大家「唔知拉咩嘅」，而政府兩日後發布聲明宣布「光時」口號已犯《國安法》（翻查資料，政府於7月2日發聲明）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦一度問何為何選擇在論壇批評楊岳橋，以及指中共不允許反對派做不可控的行為是什麼意思，惟陳慶偉指「我不認為我們需要進入這些政治（“I don’t think we need to go into all these politics, do we?”）」。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;何桂藍指中共是極權為客觀描述 港人不希望活在政權嚴格控制下&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;何桂藍以博弈論討論「攬炒」 指抗爭一方具理性基礎 「抗爭唔係求死，係求生」&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（25日）踏入審訊第91天。何桂藍繼續作供，就初選論壇提「抗擊中共極權」，何指中共是「極權」為學界共識，指有「全面控制」之意。辯方一度問何的說法是帶貶義抑或事實陳述，法官陳慶偉認為兩者無分別，辯方解釋若形容美國為「極權」或帶貶義，因美國並非極權，又指極權是指獨裁、一黨專政。陳慶偉續問日本和俄羅斯是否「極權」，並一度指日本基本上也是一黨，何高聲說：「唔係啊，日本有共產黨㗎。」中何最後指，形容中共極權是「客觀描述」，與褒貶無關，而她想表達「總之香港人係唔希望活喺一個方方面面都受到政權嚴格控制嘅制度之下」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何亦表示《國安法》將實施時社會很大恐慌，港人認為「做乜嘢都係送頭」，惟何認為「有《國安法》就乜都做唔到」只是中共要求港人接受的說法，並非她所見的現實，認為香港人仍有抗衡方法。何又自言雖料某些審議行為或犯《國安法》，但「我冇估到、或者我從來都冇諗到，撳個反對掣就係犯法」，直言這對在港生活30年的她，簡直是「匪夷所思」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍解釋破局意思打破政權設立規則-按自己規則行事&quot;&gt;何桂藍解釋「破局」意思：打破政權設立規則 按自己規則行事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍今繼續作供。辯方大律師 Trevor Beel 問及何在初選論壇提及「死局」和「破局」的意思，何指說法是來自政治理論，簡單而言是政權會建立一些特定的結構（structure），既指體制（institution）亦關乎敘述（narrative）的東西，造成現實上會有很多限制、同時也會令民眾心理上覺得受到局限，「似乎佢哋必須要面對個現實，就係冇 alternative 嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何指，一旦民眾「見到官方嘅講法唔係唯一嘅講法、官方呈現嘅現實唔係唯一嘅現實嘅話，咁政權對民眾無論實際上或者心理上嘅控制就會失去」，「抗爭」在理論的說法就是建立「anti-structure（反結構）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，當政權訂立規矩限制人民行為，強制要求所有人跟從同一套遊戲規則，而若抗爭者可離開這些規則，按自己規則去行事和行動，「就相當於打破咗政權 set 出嚟嘅 structure」，就是「破局」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何有國安法就乜都做唔到只是中共要求港人接受的講法-但不是現實&quot;&gt;何：有《國安法》就「乜都做唔到」只是中共要求港人接受的講法 但不是現實&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，在2020年6月28日論壇發言時，當時眼中「死局」是《國安法》數日後會正式在港實施，當時社會有很大恐慌，「唔知可以點樣做落去，覺得做乜嘢都冇用、做乜嘢都係送頭。」法庭傳譯主任將「送頭」譯為「self-incriminating（自證其罪）」，何指「翻譯譯得非常之好」，並補充「送頭」亦有作「無謂犧牲」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，因此當時發言最關鍵目的就是嘗試說服港人，「有《國安法》就乜都做唔到只係中共要求香港人接受嘅一個講法，但並唔係我所見到嘅現實，我所見到嘅現實就係，即使喺呢個情況之下，香港人仍然有抗衡嘅方法嘅」，而透過立法會選舉取得最大的民意授權（mandate）和票數（turnout）就是其中一個方法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，當何說服人時，是說服他們做什麼？何指有三點，包括「唔好因為有《國安法》就覺得香港已經完全冇希望完全冇嘢做」、「唔好覺得有《國安法》就完全冇抗爭嘅餘地」，及在她身位而言「希望大家唔好因為咁而放棄即將來到嘅選舉」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何在港生活30年從無想過撳個反對掣就係犯法-直言匪夷所思&quot;&gt;何：在港生活30年從無想過「撳個反對掣就係犯法」 直言「匪夷所思」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，何認為即使《國安法》後，仍然有合法的事可以做？何即表示：「問題就係喺《國安法》之下，其實我哋無辦法判斷乜嘢係違法乜野係唔違法，所以啲人先咁驚。」李續着何回答前小心聽和小心想，並再問，何當時是否認為《國安法》後仍可以合法地表達意見。何說：「當然啦因為，我相信法官嘅意思唔係有《國安法》之後香港做乜嘢都係犯法啊嘛？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指他關注的是何當時的思想狀態（state of mind）。何回應，當時想法與一開始決定參選的想法相似，就是認為抗爭有很多形式，有些的確有風險，「但係選舉係最多人可以參與，正正係因為我當時嘅心態係，投張票無可能係違法嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問是指在選舉投票？何答「無論係選舉入面定係喺立法會入面」，她坦言在兩辦譴責郭榮鏗和《國安法》通過後，雖然未必認同，但她有擔心也已認定一些審議行為可能觸犯《國安法》，明白有此風險。惟何表明：「但係我冇估到、或者我從來都冇諗到，撳個反對掣就係犯法。我覺得作為一個喺香港生活咗三十年嘅人，呢樣嘢簡直係匪夷所思。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇提中共極權-何稱屬客觀描述香港人不想要這種制度&quot;&gt;論壇提「中共極權」 何稱屬客觀描述、香港人不想要這種制度&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就何提及「同全香港人一齊抗擊中共極權」，何表示，「簡單嚟講呢，形容中共係『極權』，我形容係而家學界嘅一個共識，爭在你形容佢係一個乜嘢形態嘅極權，即係 digital totalitarianism（數字極權主義），定係 neo totalitarianism（新極權主義）嗰啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「雖然『極權』佢聽落係一個批評，但係佢同時都係一個定義」，指英文「total」可理解為「total control（全面控制）」，意指「政權喺人民生活嘅方方面面，你做嘢又好、返到屋企又好、你搭咩車、搭咩飛機，所有嘢都係政權可以監控甚至控制嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，因此何提及「極權」時，不是用作貶義（derogatory），而是事實陳述？主控萬德豪指問題非常引導性，Beel 指只是想澄清何的說法。法官陳慶偉表示何剛才只是談及學術上對「極權」的理解，但無談及個人理解，無直接回答 Beel 的問題，又指嚴格來說確是引導性問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;討論何謂極權-辯方稱屬一黨專政-官指日本基本上都只有一個政黨&quot;&gt;討論何謂極權 辯方稱屬一黨專政 官指日本基本上都只有一個政黨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續回應，剛才的說法就是她理解「極權」的意思。陳慶偉續問，那何對「中共」的理解是怎樣？是極權還是什麼？何先說：「嗱我坐左監兩年半喇，我唔知而家最新嘅講法係點樣」，陳慶偉問那她論壇上是貶義抑或事實陳述，並主動指坦白說看不到兩者分別。Beel 續舉例，若形容美國是極權或是貶義，因為美國不是極權；但若按事實說出某個政權是極權，就不可能是貶義，因為那只是一個事實。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指這很困難，問如何定義極權？Beel 認為頗為簡單，就是獨裁、一黨專政（dictatorial one-party system）。陳慶偉問，日本是不是極權？何桂藍即說「咩呀」，Beel 回應不是，因為日本行議會制，可透過選舉投選不同政黨。陳慶偉問，那俄羅斯呢？Beel 指俄羅斯是極權。陳說「為什麼，俄羅斯也有國會」，Beel 即指「但它只有一個政黨」。陳說「日本也是，基本上也是一個政黨（“So as Japan, essentially one party.”）」，何桂藍驚訝說：「咩呀？」，又高聲說：「唔係啊，日本有共產黨㗎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，這就是當辯方問何是貶義抑或事實陳述時，「我們面對的困難」，又指他不是要辯論。李運騰則指，法庭並不關注學術定義，而是關注被告當時的想法，「不要被學術辯論分心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何最後回應，同意形容中共是「極權」是一個客觀描述，並指「褒義貶義呢啲無關係嘅，問題係香港人唔要呢一種制度」，這亦是她想表達的意思，何並舉例所謂「呢個制度」，就是「你返工要對住黨委、你拍拖要向黨委交代、你去維權佢會屈你有 COVID、你健康碼會變咗紅色⋯⋯總之香港人係唔希望活喺一個方方面面都受到政權嚴格控制嘅制度之下，我相信呢個係非常清楚嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，日本參眾兩院均有不同政黨擁有議席，包括執政聯盟的自民黨和公明黨、立憲民主黨及日本共產黨等，而自民黨自1955年成立後，除1993至1994年及2009至2012年外均維持執政地位。至於俄羅斯國會上下議院，除統執的統一俄羅斯黨外，俄羅斯共產黨及自由民主黨等也有議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何重申立法會失效-連討論政策功能也無法做到&quot;&gt;何重申立法會「失效」 連討論政策功能也無法做到&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 亦問何於論壇稱「立法會唔再係一個議事嘅殿堂，只係一個抗爭嘅陣地」的意思。何指當時很多人常說這句話，但她認為不是「叫人去行動」的口號，而是說明一個事實，即一直以為可以議事的立法會，「其實從來都唔係一個真正可以議到事嘅地方，所以佢係一個抗爭陣地。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，何是否認為立法會內不能有效（effectively）地議事？何回應，如果一個立法機關無辦法實際上制衡到行政機關，就是一個「失效」的立法機關，指如議員進入議會也只可發表意見、向官員發問，「其實你喺 Facebook 都做到呢樣嘢」，而現時立法會內，「可能連要求官員交一份文件出嚟畀議員睇嘅權力都未必有。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，因此若說純粹無辦法有效議事，她不太認同，強調很多時議員甚至連獲得充分資訊考慮政策再決定投票立場的空間也沒有，「財委會可能真係開會開到一半突然間掟四百頁畀你。」何認為，「如果行政機關對立法會議員係咁嘅態度嘅話，佢根本都唔認為佢需要聽立法會嘅意見，或者畀立法會足夠嘅資訊去考慮嘅話，我會話連最基本討論一個政策呢個功能佢都做唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指公民黨無承諾35-會做什麼-為抗爭意志成疑表現&quot;&gt;何指公民黨無承諾35-會做什麼 為「抗爭意志成疑」表現&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何桂藍在論壇向公民黨楊岳橋提問，是否只有「35+」才會否決預算案和政府法案時，曾表示「如果我哋要說服香港人，議會戰線對運動仍然有好強大嘅作用嘅話，我哋首先候選人就要展現出相應嘅抗爭意志」，Beel 問展現抗爭意思的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/qn3yndL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 楊岳橋（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何表示，當時觀察到公民黨在6月底仍在說「如果我哋能夠達成35+，我哋就否決呢樣否決嗰樣」，惟何認為當時在她或很多選民眼中，35+已無法達成，故認為公民黨是迴避問題，「做咗個承諾係佢自己唔需要實現嘅」，「只承諾攞到35+先做乜乜乜，但完全冇 address 過如果35-嘅話公民黨會點樣樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，認為公民黨無向選民交代35-會做什麼，就是「抗爭意志成疑嘅表現」。法官陳仲衡問，所以35-仍會否決預算案，就是展現抗爭意志？何指當時討論不是這樣，因預算案並非論壇甚至初選的關鍵議題，又重申公民黨過往曾就同一件事有不同投票立場、或就某些議題明知現行制度有問題仍投贊成票，故當時認為該黨透過強調35+而「掩蓋咗呢個問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何重申抗爭意志是承認立會非可幫選民落實訴求地方&quot;&gt;何重申抗爭意志是承認立會非可幫選民落實訴求地方&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在追問下，重申展現抗爭意志就是她早前就「抗爭派」的解釋，即不只是重大或公眾關注的議題才表現得強硬，「每一條法案、每一條議案幾細囈都要盡責審議」；承認立法會並非可以議事和幫選民落實訴求的地方，「唔好再話我當選、或者乜嘢數量嘅民主派當選就落實到乜嘢訴求」；而且「行動上唔以保住自己席位或者不被DQ為最優先考慮」。何又指就第一和三點或不太明顯，但就不給予假希望上「我覺得公民黨係有所欠缺嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 總結，即何認為候選人應盡量讓公眾知道其立場？何指「其實我大概明法庭問緊嘅嘢係乜嘢」，李運騰指這不是法庭而是辯方律師的問題。何指法官陳仲衡問及抗爭意志是否指否決財案，但當時論壇上的人，「最後係咪自己有得去投呢個議案我哋都唔肯定，所以我亦都唔認為應該喺嗰個時間點去講一啲其實唔會係自己做嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問若向選民提35不可能的效果-何稱相信亦希望更多人投票&quot;&gt;被問若向選民提「35+」不可能的效果 何稱相信亦希望更多人投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍其後表示，她認為35+的目標是「不可能（impossible）」，而不止是「不切實際（unrealistic）」。李運騰問何有否向公眾表明取得35+是不可能，何指她論壇上有這樣說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，何指望於初選取得最大票數，若她公開表示認為過半是不可能，對選民有何影響？何指若她說服到選民「投立法會仍然係有意義」，「我相信個投票嘅熱情唔會爭太遠」，亦相信當時選民「心中有數」，「唔會純粹覺得冇可能就唔投。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在法官追問下續指，她甚至希望「喺我哋咁樣講清楚之後，個 turnout（票數）會更加多添」，解釋因本身民眾對立法會可做的事不抱任何期望，「如果你仲同佢哋講投我入去，我幫你哋達成啲咩、有咩訴求」，她認為說法不吸引，反而予人很壞的印象，「香港已經咁樣，你仲掛住個議席。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何指，「如果你清清楚楚同選民交代，其實你都知道閘都未必入到，但係我哋投票，正正就唔係為咗喺立法會攞個議席可以做到啲乜嘢，而係喺當時就住中共嘅作為，表達一個香港人最清晰嘅立場，我相信或者我希望當時有更加多嘅人因為咁樣而投票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LeKfBsp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（25日）踏入審訊第91天。何桂藍繼續作供，就提到「攬炒」的帖文解釋。何指當時有關「攬炒」的輿論有「自毀」傾向、強調犧牲和死，惟何認為「抗爭唔係求死，係求生嘅」，指「中共炒到埋嚟嘅時候」，香港人的求生意志可以打開新的空間，犧牲和絕望等說法是抹殺2019年運動的創造性。何又曾以「博弈論」討論「攬炒」，強調抗爭一方有「好強嘅理性基礎」，雖未必可直接對中共造成損傷，但會將其推向鎮壓或回應民意的位置，而「攬炒」是建基於中共會過度反應的假設。何強調「冇人迫佢揀鎮壓呢條路，佢唔需要講到立《國安法》啊盛啊呢啲嘢好無辜咁」，指既然中共選擇破壞香港制度，便要承受該選擇的代價。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指抗爭唔係求死係求生-絕望等說法抹殺2019運動創造性&quot;&gt;何指「抗爭唔係求死，係求生」 「絕望」等說法抹殺2019運動創造性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍今繼續作供。辯方大律師 Trevor Beel 就何桂藍的 Facebook 帖文發問，其中6月29日的〈香港人，千其唔好睇少自己 — 攬炒的哲學〉，配圖為6月9日遊行，並有「奪回香港」橫額。何解釋想表達「如果香港人係願意咁多人行返出嚟嘅時候，個力量係好大嘅」，故盡量找一張多人的相。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問「攬炒的哲學」意思，何重申參選其中一個原因是想有身位演繹「攬炒」，因當時輿論談及「攬炒」時，有些東西她不同意。何舉例，無可否認2019年很多抗爭者有一種「自毀」的傾向，「佢哋會好強調犧牲、強調死，因為佢哋正正就係睇唔到喺咁大嘅壓迫之下，自己可以做乜，或者自己做嘅嘢可以有咩用。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何強調，「抗爭唔係求死，係求生嘅」，形容中共「炒到埋嚟」時，「可以打開新嘅空間，係香港人嘅求生意志」，因此像「犧牲」或區諾軒所說的「絕望」情緒，「我認為係抹殺咗2019嘅創造性」，她望有機會可說清楚香港人所做的事究竟有什麼效果，或者正在打開什麼空間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰一度關注帖文提及「狹路相逢勇者勝」，指昨日選舉單張岑敖暉的介紹也有提到，問何是否引用岑，何回應：「但係呢句野唔係岑敖暉作㗎嘛……梁振英都成日用嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/7OsOGHM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，區諾軒曾供稱主張否決預算案向北京施壓的攬炒一派，是「表達緊一種絕望」，因覺得長時間也無法實現心目中理想的香港，故要用盡抗爭手段爭取「破局」來「置諸死地而後生」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何以博弈論討論攬炒-解釋抗爭一方有好強理性基礎&quot;&gt;何以博弈論討論「攬炒」 解釋抗爭一方有「好強理性基礎」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍於帖文提及博弈論中的「Game of Chicken」，即若兩架車迎面駛向對方會車毁人亡，最理性做法應是剎車，但因兩個司機也認為對方會剎車，故兩邊也無停車。何文中形容「攬炒」與此遊戲相似，兩架車分別為香港和中國。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何今指，很多本地學者以博弈論討論「攬炒」，2019年7月已看到相關說法，但她當時這樣提出，是因「《國安法》下好多人覺得再做都係送頭，都係唔理性嘅，但係我想強調返，抗爭一方做嘅東西其實係有好強嘅理性基礎」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就帖文提到「我哋要做嘅，就係繼續抗爭」，何強調2019運動中，「大家選擇用乜嘢形式去抗爭，應該係基於自己嘅判斷，而唔應該係望住一啲知名人物叫你做咩就做咩嘅」，因此她一直以來亦「唔會去好直接咁話大家應該去做啲咩」，而是認為「大家繼續做可以做同自己認為做得到嘅嘢」，在她而言就是繼續說服更多人投票。法官陳仲衡一度問，文中「黨安法」是否指《國安法》，何同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何攬炒是建基中共一定會過度反應&quot;&gt;何：「攬炒」是建基中共一定會過度反應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於帖文最後提及「但係如果我哋唔退讓，即使佢（中共）架車要撞埋嚟，佢一樣要遍體鱗傷，焦頭爛額。攬炒必然對我方有成本，但我哋要佢哋輸得更加甘」，何解釋是指合法性危機，指如港人已非常明顯表達政治意志，中共仍不回應並採取壓制和操縱選舉的方式，「佢相當於係自己破壞咗香港成個制度嘅正當性」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並強調，香港人可做的事未必對中共直接構成任何損傷，「只係將佢推去一個選擇，一個佢必須要做抉擇，究竟係鎮壓定係回應民意呢一個位」，而「攬炒」的想法是建基於「中共一定會 overreact（過度反應）」的假設，即中共「會做一啲其實佢要解決個問題根本唔需要做到咁盡嘅嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何民主化是中港政府憲制責任中共破壞制度要承受代價&quot;&gt;何：民主化是中港政府憲制責任、中共破壞制度要承受代價&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並表示，香港人由頭到尾都是爭取「民主化」，所要的「其實就係《基本法》講咗嘅嘢咋嘛」，甚至香港人「完全唔爭取、完全唔做任何示威」，理論上香港民主化本身都是中港政府的憲制責任。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指「遍體鱗傷，焦頭爛額」的前提，「就係佢堅持要撞㗎車埋嚟」，即是說政權不單不履行本身的憲制責任，可以聆聽民意時亦「自己選擇唔去聽」。何續說，「我必須要強調，冇人迫佢揀鎮壓呢條路，佢唔需要講到立《國安法》啊盛啊呢啲嘢好無辜咁，既然佢選擇去破壞香港嘅制度，咁佢當然要承受返佢呢個選擇嘅代價啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何解釋曾被抹黑不會議會抗爭-故發文回應&quot;&gt;何解釋曾被「抹黑」不會議會抗爭 故發文回應&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何桂藍7月9日的帖文〈「唔抗爭，選你入去做咩？」〉，何解釋當時網絡誤傳她不會議會抗爭，認為是「抹黑」，故發文澄清。帖文配圖為內會衝突的情形，可見多名保安包圍朱凱廸等議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何不太同意李運騰指配圖是議會抗爭例子，指當時情況是一個立法會議員向主席表達意見，但被主席「熄咪」，而他嘗試走去主席台時，「就幾十個保安衝埋去，去阻止佢發言」，故配圖是顯示民主派議員在議事廳內受到限制，而且是「肢體上的限制」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在帖文提及「『武鬥』是議會抗爭的必備元素，我亦當然會與其他抗爭派議員齊上齊落」，又指「武鬥」要發揮效用有兩個條件，「1、需要盡可能多的抗爭派進入議會。2、需要議會內所有民主派互相協作，不陷入幾個人單打獨鬥的局面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱若建制派對民主派施暴-應阻止而非守住溫和形象不應屈服暴力&quot;&gt;何稱若建制派對民主派施暴 應阻止而非守住溫和形象、不應屈服暴力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋在她眼中「民主派唔一定需要武鬥嘅」，但如在立法會想履行議員職責時，「我哋都未舉手、我哋只係企咗起身，就已經有保安衝埋嚟阻止⋯⋯而另一邊廂，喺主席未作出任何裁決嘅時候，建制派嘅議員已經率先會用武力，夾硬將你拉離會議廳」，何指若到了這個地步，「究竟所謂履行議員責任係順從呢一啲暴力離開議會廳、或者放棄表達自己嘅意見；定係要用盡一切方式都需要履行返自己責任，去講返當刻嗰個會需要你講嘅東西呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「當議會入面其中一派嘅人係不停咁使用呢一啲暴力去阻止你去履行職責嘅時候，我個人嘅睇法，係唔應該屈服於呢一啲暴力，無論係立法會主席嘅武斷、制度上嘅暴力，定係保安同建制議員肢體上嘅暴力」，而應盡自己所能去做要做的事，不論提規程問題抑或是指出立法會主席越權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續解釋，即使她無法入議會、亦想像只有少數民主派能進入議會，但作為一個支持度不低的候選人，也想加入討論「萬一有人入到去，佢應該點」。而何認為無論誰入議會，「大家都應該一齊做（「武鬥」）」，舉例如有建制派將民主派議員「掟落地下拖行」時，「你應該要去阻止佢嘅，而唔係因為覺得要守住自己一個溫和嘅形象……由得好個別嘅議員自己面對呢啲暴力。」被告欄內的林卓廷一度與鄒家成等說話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱不會主動傷人-但無理由因暴力放棄履行議員責任&quot;&gt;何稱不會主動傷人 但無理由因暴力放棄履行議員責任&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，何桂藍是「以暴易暴」嗎？何指其準則很簡單，指這些事情「唔係無啦啦發生」，一定是她提出意見或指出程序問題被阻止時，她當下要想辦法「做返我本身應該做嘅嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 追問，那是否代表民主派被建制派暴力對待時，要在議事廳打架？何指首先是制止建制派行使暴力，如可以制止就毋須繼續；又指在該情況下，「保安係唔會幫你㗎嘛，保安只會打埋你一份啫」，旁聽席傳來笑聲。何續認真說：「Sorry 唔係一個笑話，佢哋係會帶戰術手套入 chamber 㗎嘛」，並表示：「我唔會主動傷害任何人，但係如果係阻止佢哋對其他人行使暴力、或者佢哋打我嘅時候，我當然要阻止佢哋啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，而另一個做法是離開議事廳，但何不視這為選項。何指「但與此同時個會仲開緊嗰喎」，強調「做返佢哋想阻止我做嘅嘢」、履行當時議員責任也很重要，「無理由因為佢哋行使暴力，我就放棄我作為議員應該做嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何重申議員無法阻政府濫權或落實倡議-選擇可能dq路線不等於浪費選票&quot;&gt;何重申議員無法阻政府濫權或落實倡議 選擇可能DQ路線不等於浪費選票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何帖文提到溫和泛民支持者認為「如果你入到去都係 DQ，咁我點解要投你啊？」，但「說服他們議會已經無法正常議事，是每一個抗爭派參選人的責任」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何今重申，有選民認為議員可阻止政府惡法或濫權行為，或可落實某些倡議；惟何強調這些事情是「做唔到」，是次選舉目的亦非「投一啲議員入去阻止啲乜嘢」，因此一個候選人選擇一個可能被DQ的路線，「唔等於佢係浪費緊選票。」何又舉例，《逃犯條例》「最原初咪就係因為民主派堅持咗幾個月都阻唔到，所以先至會有一切後續嘅事情，民主派最多就係拖幾個月」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何重申議員只能盡量曝光政府議案問題-惟認未能解決甚至被針對&quot;&gt;何重申議員只能盡量曝光政府議案問題 惟認未能解決甚至被針對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，若何認為議會無法正常議事，議員即使拖延也只是暫時、政府最終也能通過想通過的議案，而議會無充分的制衡，無法影響政府政策，那何期望議員進入立法會做什麼？何先指，李列舉的不是假設，「過去幾十年都係咁嘅」，並認為議員入立會後可用非常僅餘的權力，至少盡量指出政府法案的所有問題，如「邊啲位係做數、邊啲位係掩蓋咗一啲隱藏嘅開支」，又如政府派錢、減稅時隱藏了未經持份者同意就強行做的工程，何強調若非議員「你連嗰份野都攞唔到」。何說話時林卓廷和黃碧雲對話，陳志全亦微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「如果你將上述所有嘅問題都曝光之後，佢仍然唔通過嘅話，就全香港都會見到嗰個問題」，惟何亦強調過去二十多年，「你曝光咗啲問題之後，作為立法會議員你未必解決得到」，甚至當中共或香港政府發現這樣會造成認受性問題，然後「佢哋會針對你」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fOj122B.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第90天。何桂藍繼續作供，就參選宣言作出解釋，當中提及「或者最理性嘅選擇，係認命、放棄抵抗」，但「反抗，先可以改變到香港嘅宿命」。何解釋，很多港人幻想香港可維持現狀，但她認為在一國兩制下，當一國不斷變化，兩制無可能不變，「香港永遠都冇可能留喺『冇民主但都有自由』呢個幻想入面」，她亦不會因此接受一個「表面繁榮但係實際上不斷破壞緊香港」的現狀，形容這是所有參與2019年運動的人的選擇。何又指，當大陸情況不斷惡化，「香港憑咩覺得自己可以偏安一隅、維持住一個有法治有自由嘅地方呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並解釋，在「乜嘢都守唔住」下，「反抗先可改變香港宿命」就是明知會招致好大打壓，仍實踐相信的事和應得的權利，舉例初選便是民間透過實踐所相信的民主，去抗衡對民主的打壓，形容反抗和自我實現是一體兩面。而何望透過參選，說服民眾即使立法會無法履行憲制責任，議會仍能「助燃場運動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指戴耀廷首要考慮非應對中共打壓-而是盡所能包攬最多民主派參與&quot;&gt;何指戴耀廷首要考慮非應對中共打壓 而是盡所能包攬最多民主派參與&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供。上周談及取得35+的可能性時，何指認為35+無可能，但戴耀廷則稱民主派可達40+甚至46+議席，但不記得來自哪篇文章。辯方大律師 Trevor Beel 今展示戴耀廷5月發布的〈攬炒，to burn or not to burn?〉和〈請您做一個真正的建制派〉，戴提及民主派或出人意外地達到40+。何確認，並指戴另有文章提及「46+」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，無論戴提及多少議席，她認為分別是，當大家不斷想如何透過更「激進化」吸引更多人支持時，戴耀廷「從來都係一個方向」、其興趣從來都是重新檢視制度，「搵吓有咩空間可以畀更加多人參與」，「要包攬最多最多嘅香港人去參與」，笑言「佢係想連建制派都說服埋一齊35+嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，由戴於2017、2018年區議會「填白區」，到2020年辦初選，也是同一思路，並認為戴草擬的「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」一句，首要考慮（priority）並非應對中共打壓，而是「盡佢所能將盡量多嘅民主派系都包喺初選呢件事入面」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ei3ppZt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，但何上周說戴草擬該句是為避免DQ，現在又說不是他首要考慮？何指，與其說戴本人「真係好想避免DQ」，更準確說法是「佢 cater（迎合）緊溫和派對DQ嘅憂慮，同時佢亦都 cater 緊其他人對唔應該迴避呢個核心議題（否決預算案）嘅睇法」，故認為戴首要考慮是大家都能參與，同意法官指是迎合（accommodate）越多人越好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;戴耀廷稱足夠選民藍轉黃可能獲46席-官指不切實際&quot;&gt;戴耀廷稱足夠選民「藍轉黃」可能獲46席 官指不切實際&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方其後在控方提醒下，展示7月2日戴耀廷文章〈搶灘功能界別要「藍轉黃」〉，提及若有足夠數量選民「藍轉黃」，在功能組別「搶灘成功」，便可能獲46席，何稱相信有看過這篇。法官陳慶偉即說「藍轉黃」基乎是不可能，因參與初選首要資格是認同「五大訴求，缺一不可」，陳志全大笑。Beel 說法官是指戴是有些瘋狂，陳慶偉說不是瘋狂，Beel 補充是不切實際，陳慶偉同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱報名時無看過提名表格內容-理解所指共識為辦初選和論壇&quot;&gt;何稱報名時無看過提名表格內容 理解所指「共識」為辦初選和論壇&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就提名表格發問，問何如何理解「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，「共識」的意思。何先指「我必需要講我簽呢張嘢嘅時候，其實我冇睇到內容」，因她當時理解就是戴耀廷6月9日記者會宣布毋須簽協議，而她是在看到審訊文件夾時「先見到呢份嘢入面有呢幾隻字」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟法官陳仲衡指，何應至少有閱讀第一點，「我謹聲明我同意如上文第一部分第一節及第二節所述，獲提名為上述選舉候選人，*並同意提名名單上的各候選人排名的次序（如提名名單只由一名人士組成，請刪去此句）」，因相關部分被刪去。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，現在回想當時拿到表格時應已刪去該句，惟陳慶偉指組織者理應不會預先刪去，何指她不肯定，但「由頭到尾我都係話一個人選」。她亦不肯定如何獲得表格，但現時回看理解「共識」是指協調會達成的共識，包括會辦公民投票及其日期，及會辦論壇。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指大陸情況不斷惡化-港人不能幻想可偏安一隅維持無民主但有自由&quot;&gt;何指大陸情況不斷惡化 港人不能幻想可「偏安一隅」、維持「無民主但有自由」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問及何桂藍6月18日於 Facebook 發布的參選宣言，何解釋當天開始宣布參加初選和收集提名，並要取得100名新東選民的簽署，又憶述她當日於沙田火車站收取提名，「其實100個（提名）大概10分鐘至15分鐘就有㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問及首段內容：「國安法壓境，面對來勢洶洶嘅逼害同打壓，或者最理性嘅選擇，係認命、放棄抵抗；識時務者，會笑我哋螳臂擋車，作無謂嘅抵抗同犧牲。但佢哋永遠都唔會明白，我哋前仆後繼，係因為我哋知道，反抗，先可以改變到香港嘅宿命」，問「反抗，先可以改變到香港嘅宿命」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指區諾軒作供時曾指他們這派人是不希望對香港再存有幻想，法官曾問是什麼幻想，何續舉例，帖文提及最理性選擇或是認命、放棄抵抗，而她眼中，很多香港人的幻想就是香港仍然可以維持現狀、有維持現狀的選擇。但何認為在一國兩制之下，「當一國都不斷咁變化嘅時候，兩制係冇可能維持不變，我嘅理解就係香港永遠都冇可能留喺『冇民主但都有自由』呢個幻想入面。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續認為，「唔會因為想留住一啲本來就建立喺浮沙上面嘅 privilege（優勢）同自由」，「而去接受一個表面繁榮但係實際上不斷破壞緊香港嘅 status quo（現狀）」，並形容「呢一個就係所有參與2019年運動嘅人嘅選擇」。翻譯一度未能譯出，法官李運騰提出建議，何一度問「我可唔可以自己用英文講？」，李指何或要換個說法，Beel 亦提醒何要盡量簡單。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續舉例，所謂一國不斷變，就如中英談判或之後很長的時間，「至少國家主席個位都唔係終身制先啦係咪啊」，又指看到2012年後，「中國大陸嘅情況係不斷惡化，咁其實香港憑咩覺得自己可以偏安一隅、維持住一個有法治有自由嘅地方呢？」，因此她說無法假設香港可一直維持現狀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何港人乜嘢都守唔住反抗是明知招致打壓仍實踐想實踐的事&quot;&gt;何：港人「乜嘢都守唔住」、反抗是明知招致打壓仍實踐想實踐的事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 追問，那何說「反抗，先可以改變到香港嘅宿命」是什麼意思？何回應：「香港人成日都會話我哋守住某啲嘢，譬如當法治被破壞，我哋就嘗試守住個法治啦，咁當立法會嘅規章被破壞，我哋就嘗試守住個議會啦，但我認為呢一種心態都證實咗只會令情況越嚟越差，事實上就係乜嘢都守唔住。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續提及，早前法庭曾討論「抗爭」是否譯「resistance」，法官李運騰曾指「resistance」只有「抗」但無「爭」的意思，故她認為「contention」較準確，並指她一直提「抗爭」也是「contention」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GKU3tpU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何桂藍（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，如她早前所說，反抗的同時「必然係同時建立緊一啲嘢」，而她會形容「反抗同自我實現其實係一體兩面」，因此當她說反抗才可改變香港宿命時，是指「我哋要做我哋相信嘅嘢，我哋要尋求去實踐我哋認為我哋應得嘅權利，即使我哋明知咁樣係會招致好大嘅打壓，唔去褪，而係堅持做我哋本身已經做緊嘅野，先至可以改變香港嘅宿命」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，「contention」本身有「make claim（作出主張）」的意思，「喺打壓嘅人嘅眼中，我哋做嘅所有嘢都係反抗緊佢，但係喺我哋自己嘅角度，我哋從來都係實踐緊一啲我哋想實踐嘅東西。」李運騰問，那何是反抗什麼，和如何反抗？何指宣言提及「國安法」、「迫害」、「打壓」、「極權」，指在此語境下要反抗和抗衡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指初選是民間透過實踐相信的民主-抗衡對民主的打壓&quot;&gt;何指初選是民間透過實踐相信的民主 抗衡對民主的打壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 追問是以什麼方式反抗，何指是「實踐我哋本身追求緊嘅嘢」，舉例「佢哋唔畀我哋進行真正嘅民主選舉，透過DQ、透過《國安法》去恐嚇同埋嘗試去操縱個選舉，但我會形容初選就係一場由香港民間自己去做、符合民主原則嘅選舉，啫係話我哋透過實踐我哋相信嘅民主究竟係點樣樣，去抗衡佢哋對民主呢件事本身嘅打壓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，即透過舉辦初選爭取最多人投票，展示民眾反應，就是她反抗的方式？何回應這是其中之一，並指初選除了是抗衡不公正的選舉制度，亦是抗衡議會無法制衡行政機關的不公義體制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉打斷，指 Beel 是問何除了辦初選，還有沒有另外的反抗方式。何一度稱與其說透過初選抗衡，應該是說用怎樣的態度辦初選，惟陳再打斷並重複問題。何最後指，當時整個運動「非常之廣闊」，有很多反抗形式，但她當時身位就是推動初選。Beel 提醒她回答問題時盡量集中在她個人而非他人看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指抗衡極權時不獲任何制度保障要承受法外打壓&quot;&gt;何指抗衡極權時不獲任何制度保障、要承受「法外」打壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，宣言中「面對極權，我哋的確一無所有」是什麼意思。何解釋，當時認為選擇抗衡極權時，「香港畀我哋係冇任何嘅制度保障」，他們會承受一些「法外」的打壓，「但係我哋依然選擇咗咁樣做。」何指如此做時，本身以為有的法律和人權等保護，或當有事發生時「傳媒能唔能夠影得到同埋公諸於世⋯⋯」，惟陳慶偉打斷，問 Beel 原本的問題是什麼，並問是否需要知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指他會問下一條問題，並指因文章在控方案情內，要予何桂藍解釋的機會，陳同意，但指何撰文時讀者也是從字面理解，如她有深層的意思，法官作為普通讀者也不會知道。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指有市民認為議會拖抗爭後腿-望說服民眾議會有關鍵作用&quot;&gt;何指有市民認為議會「拖抗爭後腿」 望說服民眾議會有關鍵作用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問及何提到「多年以來，呢個不民主嘅議會，都係吸納、消弭街頭運動能量嘅地方」的意思。何解釋，立法會無法履行其憲制責任，不能監察政府亦不能落實任何倡議，「有啲咩惡法或者不公義嘅撥款佢都係守唔住」；惟每當有選舉，「大家嘅關注點都會去晒選舉嗰度，因為大家硬係覺得選多幾個位，件事就總會有啲變化。」何續指，因此每次大型社會運動最後都會轉化成選舉的資本，但議會又無法落實社會運動所爭取的訴求，相當於吸納了社會運動的政治能量後，「但係喺制度入面乜嘢都爭取唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，何帖文提及「喺今時今日嘅香港，議會要去助燃場運動」，但如立法會不能履行其功能，何又說重要的是在選舉引起公眾討論，那選舉後議員應該做什麼？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋，她當時是回應一個較主流想法，就是很多市民很清楚、甚至會說「立法會係廢嘅」，選的唯一作用是「攞十萬蚊人工嚟到幫抗爭者」，否則就是純粹將視線由運動轉移去議會，認為議會「拖抗爭後腿」。而何說「議會要去助燃場運動」，就是希望說服這些人，「議會或者唔會做到好多嘢」、只是「助燃」，但它仍有關鍵作用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何承認國安法下當選民主派議員非常少-無法想像可做什麼&quot;&gt;何承認《國安法》下當選民主派議員非常少 無法想像可做什麼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於初選後當選的議員如何走，何承認在6月中的時空，「我係想像唔到嘅」，因在《國安法》下，她當時推想即使有選舉，可以入閘、當選、成功宣誓的民主派「一定都非常少，甚至亦都唔係我本人」。惟即使如此，她認為入到議會的民主派仍要「用盡議會呢個空間」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問是什麼空間，何續指「如果喺一個人數非常少嘅狀態之下，盡責審議就更加重要，盡量去 expose（曝露）政府喺推唔同政策時嘅不義行為，令公眾唔會被蒙在鼓裡」，解釋因有些資訊的確只有議員才可獲得和可質詢官員，「但係呢一啲嘢好老實講，對當時嘅我嚟講係太過遙遠。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，故當何說議會要去助燃運動時，其實沒有具體的圖畫，因她想像不到會發生什麼事？何指自《國安法》5月底宣布後，其焦點已轉至選舉如何取得最大票數上，當時甚至連7月1日後會發生什麼事「我都想像唔到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何認為國安法下民主派亦不能退讓&quot;&gt;何認為《國安法》下民主派亦不能退讓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再問，何指若民主派只有少數會盡責審議，那與以往民主派所做的有何分別？何聽問題時掩口發笑，並指有兩點回應。Beel 提議可先小休，早休後問及何帖文稱《國安法》下「民主派唔可以再係咁退讓，否則就會被逐個擊破，我地只可以用盡一切方法同中共周旋到底」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何一併回應，理解《國安法》是嘗試將本來合法的行為變為非法（outlaw），將盡責審議行為也當成「嚴重干擾」，如立會主席做了不公正裁決，民主派據理力爭也可能犯法，惟何指這情況下，「我認為民主派都唔應該退讓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「逐個擊破」是指DQ問題，何重申認為反對《國安法》已會被DQ，亦觀察到很多參選人為避免DQ，「連一個立法會議員喺《基本法》框架下係有權否決財政預算案呢樣嘢都唔承認」，但何認為：「係咪真係做係一個問題，但你承唔承認立法會議員有呢個權力係另一個問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/FxvxqDe.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第90天。何桂藍繼續作供，表示明知民主派無法取得35席，仍認為「選舉要打落去」，因要透過投票展示港人有取得35席的實力和意志；而若北京以DQ等應對，便要面對「好大嘅合法性危機」，讓全世界得知北京透過操縱選舉掩蓋港人真正意願。法官陳慶偉一度形容初選是浪費時間和金錢，惟何不同意，指社運很少達到最初訴求，但過程會打開新的空間，又指大部分港人心知中共治下爭民主「從來都係一場妄想」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷，指這並非發表政治演說的場合，惟何指法官可作出定義和發問，但她不准回答是「好唔公平」。法官指其回答不相關，惟何質疑「其實你哋對立法會嘅理解咁少，你點樣分咩係 relevant 咩係唔 relevant？」，又表明「你呢個判斷係好有瑕疵嘅」，法官陳慶偉反駁其錯誤只是由上訴庭糾正。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍與岑敖暉拍片-指35無可能但選舉仍要打落去&quot;&gt;何桂藍與岑敖暉拍片 指35+無可能但選舉仍要「打落去」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供。辯方大律師 Trevor Beel 問及她6月26日，在 Facebook 發布與岑敖暉拍攝的片段，何指應是在發布前一兩天在其選舉辦公室錄製，為其競選宣傳一部分。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問及，何於片段提及「民主派如果可以喺呢一個立法會選舉達成一個不可能嘅任務，攞到35席，攞到立法會過半嘅主導權，我哋就可以逼出一個北京冇可能接受到嘅局面，從而令到佢用更加瘋狂嘅方式去應對，要付出更加高昂嘅政治代價」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋，當時主流討論是預期北京一定會用方法阻止民主派過半，有人認為「還掂全部都會DQ㗎喇，咁仲投嚟做咩呢」，而她和岑拍片就是想作出回應，清晰告知選民他們意識到取35席是無可能、亦意識到北京一定會用DQ等方式阻止，「但我仍然認為呢個選舉要打落去。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱港人行動逼政權不得不回應-但強調從來都冇人逼佢鎮壓&quot;&gt;何稱港人行動逼政權不得不回應 但強調「從來都冇人逼佢鎮壓」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，何是指選前抑或選後DQ，何指早前已曾回應，重申2、3月時認為民主派可能贏到35席，但當選後會被DQ；至4月底兩辦譴責郭榮鏗「癱瘓立法會」、將盡責審議行為說成是「政治攬炒」，何認為大大擴大了可DQ的範圍，要在選舉取得35席已是無可能，「唔會有任何一個民主派做過議員嘅人係安全㗎喇」；至5月底《國安法》宣布，何更認為「大規模DQ」是無可避免，除非香港當時民氣低落到令中共判斷，就算不DQ也未必選到35席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，因此認為選舉仍要「打落去」，就是明知無可能取得35席，仍要找方法展示香港人當時的政治意志，去證實香港人有「實力」去取得35席；而港人行動是逼政權「去做一個選擇」、「不得不回應」，「佢不得不喺鎮壓、或者妥協、回應民意之間選擇。」但何強調：「從來都冇人逼佢鎮壓嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問何有否告知戴耀廷初選浪費時間金錢-何非常之唔同意&quot;&gt;官問何有否告知戴耀廷初選浪費時間金錢 何：非常之唔同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉其後問，那何桂藍在第二次會議是否無提出對DQ的關注，何指「係唔需要提嘅，因為兩辦咁樣講之後，民主黨、公民黨都自己搵晒 Plan B 㗎喇即刻」。林卓廷和鄭達鴻說「吓」，黃碧雲揮手示意沒有。何續指這是她由政情專欄獲得的資訊，「我知道《明報》嘅政治記者有幾厲害」，但會上無討論「Plan B」身分。林卓廷再說「吓」，陳志全發笑，有被告低聲討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，那何當時有沒有告訴戴耀廷，初選是浪費時間和金錢？何重申，很少社會運動能真正達到原初聲稱的訴求，「但過程中佢會建立咗一啲嘢，打開咗一啲新嘅空間」，又指：「我非常之唔同意嘥時間嘥心機呢一個講法，我相信絕大部分嘅香港人心底裡都知道，喺中共治下爭取民主從來都係一場妄想。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官打斷指非發表政治演說場合-何質疑官對立法會理解少&quot;&gt;官打斷指非發表政治演說場合 何質疑官對立法會理解少&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰一度欲打斷，並着何冷靜，何指「我好 calm 喎咩事」，又疊聲指「我希望完埋頭先嗰句先，我唔希望被斷章取義」。李指不可以，「因這不是一個讓你發表政治演說的場合。（“You can’t, because it is not the occassion to make political speech.”）」何回應：「呢個係一個問題我必須要回答，你問完問題又唔畀人答我覺得好唔公平⋯⋯即係法官就可以定義呢一場嘢，然後將呢個問題 put to 我但我就唔可以回答。」李指視乎何答案的相關性，陳慶偉亦指「如果你的答案與案無關，我們就不會讓你說」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何提高聲量說：「其實你哋對立法會嘅理解咁少，你點樣分咩係 relevant 咩係唔 relevant？」李運騰指認為可由其大狀在陳詞交代，陳慶偉亦對何表示：「我已做了法官25年」，何插口說：「但係你唔知道咩係分組點票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉遂望着何說，「我可能不知道很多事情，但我知道什麼是相關，什麼是不相關」，何即說：「我就係要指出你呢個判斷係好有瑕疵嘅。」陳慶偉指着何回應：「那沒有問題，但我錯誤的決定不是由你來糾正，而是由上訴庭來判斷。（“That’s fine, but my mistaken decision is not going to be corrected by you, but by the Court of Appeal.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後着何聽清楚和集中回答問題，李運騰亦着她回到謄本的段落，何問：「咁我仲需唔需要答嘥唔嘥錢、嘥唔嘥時間呢個問題？」陳慶偉指認為她已回答，就是運動未必會得到期望的結果，但會打開一些空間，並問何所說的結果是否不一定是戴耀廷預期的結果。何說「我覺得你已經 mixed up 咗邊個結果打邊個結果，你可唔可以由頭講一次」。陳慶偉說他不會重複，若何不明白就算了，他會視何不想答他的問題，何語氣加重：「我根本都唔明你問乜！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;翻查資料，何上周五談及議會「冇乜嘢做到」、「議會絕非抗爭終點」時，陳慶偉曾問何桂藍有否將其說法告知戴耀廷和其他初選組織者，並總結何想法即是「35+計劃是浪費時間和金錢」，惟何當時已表明無表達過陳慶偉所指的看法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱如港人以投票展示取35席的實力意志-北京以dq應對會面對很大合法性危機&quot;&gt;何稱如港人以投票展示取35席的實力意志 北京以DQ應對會面對很大合法性危機&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍其後在主問下，同意她當時望鼓勵人於初選投票。李運騰續問，惟若何認為民主派會被DQ、不能達致35+，又如何能實現何稱北京不可能接受的局面？何回應，問題是若港人因此而決定「算喇咁我唔投票喇」，「咁北京嘅目的就達到喇」，因北京不需處理任何事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何指，如港人仍在初選和正式選舉投票，「畀香港、北京甚至世界清晰見到香港人本身係有攞到35+嘅實力同埋意志」，那無論北京是採取DQ或其他方式應對，「佢都要面對一個好大嘅合法性危機，因為全世界都會見到呢個根本唔係香港人嘅意願，北京係透過操縱選舉嚟掩蓋香港人真正嘅意願。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續補充，因此即使知道無法取得35席，也要在初選取得相應票數。李運騰質疑，初選只涉五個地方選區和兩個功能組別，並不能知道是否真能達到35+。何解釋士氣會有間接影響，指無初選的功能組別本身應屬很難爭取的界別，但若地區直選在初選的氣勢「搞起咗」，認為功能組別選民也會嘗試可否贏到議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問，何認為取得35+的目標基本上不可能，那她有否告訴戴耀廷？何指與戴在協調會以外無交流，但她選舉文宣一定有這樣公開表達；又指想起第二次協調會議討論運用基本法權力條款時，無提過是否一定要取得35+，其印象是當時「35+攞唔攞到已經唔係大家關注嘅事情」。林卓廷輕聲說「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/fA8G8PQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（24日）踏入審訊第90天。何桂藍繼續作供，同意對「立場姐姐」稱呼不太受落，解釋若在運動出名會成為資產、如「名聲嘅暴發戶」，但「立場姐姐」名字「非常之尷尬」，人們是因抗爭者「無臉孔」而改為關注直播抗爭者行動的她。何認為該稱呼「屬於成場運動」，其非常大的政治能量非因她本人而積聚，而是很多無名抗爭者行動帶給港人感受聚合而成的「icon」。何又認為就初選論壇，所謂「鬥黃」是很重要的路線辯論，直言新東論壇候選人除追求民主外，「基本上大家都係冇乜 common ground（共同之處）。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何亦指反修例運動於2020年5月進入中美角力，很多港人覺得香港只是一隻棋子，惟何直言2019年運動精神在於不可再有「靠人」的心態，認為港人應該「堅持自己嘅抗爭」，望以「破局」概念令港人突破規矩，致當權者無法再控制香港局面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍單張有與岑敖暉合照-稱排除法選岑其政見可接受&quot;&gt;何桂藍單張有與岑敖暉合照 稱「排除法」選岑、其政見「可接受」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供，辯方展示何3份選舉單張，分別提及「向世界展現 港人面對極權的頑強姿態」、「中共推『國安立法』 香港變『一國一制』」及「國安法打到嚟監控有冇得避？」，每份均有岑敖暉的相片，其中一份亦有何與岑的合照。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰關注為何會與岑一同宣傳，何解釋地區直選候選人常配合超區候選人宣傳，而參選超區包括鄺俊宇、涂謹申、王百羽、李予信，何以「排除法」選擇岑。法庭傳譯主任一度將暱稱「王伯」的王百羽譯為「Uncle Wong」，庭上傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/j742yIg.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
▲ 王百羽（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問何政見與岑相似？何說「不如唔好用『近似』，用『可接受』呀」，又指首兩份單張「全部都係我寫」，監控一份則由團隊成員準備，由她批准。岑的單張也會有她的相片。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指攬炒發生後望以破局延續運動令港人突破規矩致當權者無法控制&quot;&gt;何指「攬炒」發生後望以「破局」延續運動、令港人突破規矩致當權者無法控制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就單張提及「參與議會戰線，不是因爲仍相信制度，而是因為相信香港人，絕不會甘心向極權屈服，相信香港人，有不惜代價但求破局的決心」，何重申不覺得入議會可爭取到實際的東西，但相信即使制度不利港人也不會甘心屈服。何又指5月時中央宣布訂立《國安法》，美國亦作相應反應，很多人認為「攬炒已經發生咗㗎喇」，「攬炒」不再是目標；而運動繼續下去，何望以「破局」的概念來延續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋，「局」是指當權者會設立很多不公平的規矩，「然後威脅你一定要跟住佢呢啲規矩嚟玩，佢會令你覺得必須要接受呢一個係現實，冇 alternative 嘅」，惟何表示「只要香港人夠齊心嘅話，我哋係可以突破到呢啲規矩，令到當權者冇辦法再透過呢啲規矩黎控制香港嘅局面」，當權者要思考回應民意或以其他方法掌握局面。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何不同意港人自視為大國角力棋子2019精神在於不可再有靠人心態&quot;&gt;何不同意港人自視為大國角力「棋子」：2019精神在於不可再有靠人心態&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就單張提及「當香港正式進入『攬炒』年代，我們更加要讓世界看見，中美角力之間，香港人堅持抗爭的身影」，何重申5月底中國和美國均有「做嘢」，很多香港人認為「已經去到一個大國角力嘅 level 喇，咁香港仲有咩可以做呢」，甚至關注美國政治多於香港政治，「唔再問香港人本身可以點，淨係喺度諗美國可以點樣點樣去對付中共。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何不同意這種想法，直言只是將港人以往對政治明星的崇拜或依賴轉移至外國政府，但她認為2019年的精神，在於「我哋每個人都唔可以再有一個靠人嘅心態，要去諗自己可以做啲咩」。何指當時很多港人會覺得「香港好似只係一個棋子」，甚至覺得應主動迎合大國角力間「棋子」的角色，惟何認為，「香港人應該堅持返自己嘅抗爭，做返自己嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱香港運動從來非為破壞而是爭取更好香港-過程難免承受打壓&quot;&gt;何稱香港運動從來非為破壞而是爭取更好香港 過程難免承受打壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問及，「攬炒年代」是指一個持續一段時間的過程？何解釋無論《國安法》還是美國對港政策，影響都非常深遠。至於「堅持」，何解釋是「做返香港人由19年開始一直做緊，甚至由八十年代開始一直做緊嘅嘢」，明知有打壓仍「實踐我哋應該有嘅權力」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;單張另提及因「攬炒」而來的「陣痛」，何指認為香港的運動，「從來都唔係為咗要破壞香港，從來都係為咗爭取一個更加好嘅香港，但過程中我哋好難免要承受一啲打壓。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍單張從沒提及否決財案和五大訴求&quot;&gt;何桂藍：單張從沒提及否決財案和五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，《國安法》通過的消息傳出後，何曾否修改或停印單張。何指原本單張有一些關於監控和資訊安全的本地法律討論，但因《國安法》來到後「已經無意思」，故作出修改；原本單張亦較多提及初選意義和9月正式選舉的部署，但之後大部份也改成講述《國安法》的影響。何指呈堂單張均是5月底後準備，為已修改的版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，無論《國安法》實施前或後，所有她草擬的單張都沒有提及否決財政預算案和「五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何鬥黃是重要路線辯論新東論壇候選人基本上冇乜-common-ground&quot;&gt;何：「鬥黃」是重要路線辯論、新東論壇候選人「基本上冇乜 common ground」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 之後就初選論壇目的提問，何解釋初選論壇與過往其他選舉論壇很不同，是只有民主派參與的論壇，並提及6月底時有很多聲音希望民主派能夠「團結一致」取得「35+」，亦覺得有關「墨落無悔」聲明的爭拗「好煩」，惟何不同意，認為「所謂嘅『鬥黃』係好重要嘅一啲路線辯論嚟嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指過去在正式選舉論壇中，民主派候選人即使有分歧，也會集中火力質問建制派，反而沒有處理過自己陣營之間的分歧；但何指事實上出席新東初選論壇的候選人，「除咗大家都係追求民主之外，基本上大家都係冇乜 common ground（共同之處）嘅」，又提及她在論壇才第一次聽到林卓廷對否決財政預算案的立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「我自己都好唔同意話一個 agreement 或者點樣，就統合晒所有人嘅觀點一定要一齊跟咁喇」，而她首次協調會提及如要有共同綱領，便望透過公投交由選民決定；雖然最終無法讓選民決定，但論壇的辯論機會，讓選民可透過初選去選擇想要的路線。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱輿論將否決財案塑造成派系紛爭而非事件本質致未有形成很多討論&quot;&gt;何稱輿論將否決財案塑造成派系紛爭而非事件本質、致未有形成很多討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何其後重申，當時有人提出所有參加初選的人都要認同一個共同綱領，她認為如涉綑綁民主派入議會後行動的討論選民都應參與；又指「掟汽油彈嘅係黃，投民協投咗四十年嘅一位深水埗婆婆都係黃」，不認為「幾十個候選人坐埋一齊決定咗一個方向之後，就要數以百萬計嘅民主派選民都要一齊去跟從」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉追問選民如何能決定共同綱領，何舉例2014年佔領中環曾將數個普選方案交市民公投，終有80多萬選民投票。陳續問，但若何指候選人無共同之處，那選民又如何能同意任何事情？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/U93afjY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;
▲ 2013年6月9日「和平佔中」第一個商討日（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指選舉並非「投票嗰一下」，假如選民毋須就共同綱領投票，對相關討論就不會如此上心；但若他們有份投票決定，才會「睇晒」選前討論，並形成自己判斷，又指2019年以來很多議題也是這樣處理，如「連登討論區」的正評和負評可影響現場決定。何指無制度可充分反映所有參與者意願，但認為應盡量做到這點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，否決預算案未有在2020年「形成好多嘅討論」，因為輿論當時將議題塑造成抗爭派與其他黨派間的「二元紛爭」，只聚焦在派系爭論，而不是事件本質。她認為，若選民當時可討論民主派取得35+後入立法會可做什麼，那2020年的討論便會很不同。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問，候選人來自不同黨派，「共同綱領」是難以實現？如可以的話何希望會有什麼內容？何思考一會說：「好難而家咁樣兜返轉頭去睇喇」，法官陳慶偉發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何立場姐姐稱呼尷尬-因抗爭者無臉孔才獲關注&quot;&gt;何：「立場姐姐」稱呼尷尬 因抗爭者「無臉孔」才獲關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後引述何桂藍於論壇被介紹為「前記者，人稱『立場姐姐』」，何上身微嘆氣說「係」。Beel 指她似乎對這稱呼不太受落，何再托頭無奈說「係」。Beel 再問何於論壇稱「『立場姐姐』呢個名，唔淨係屬於我，亦都屬於成場運動」是什麼意思，何一度就「立場」笑指「呢個要問（時任《立場》總編輯）鍾沛權喎，唔係我決定㗎嘛」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續解釋，一般而言如在運動「出咗名」、有好高的知名度，「咁嗰樣嘢會成為咗你一樣好好嘅 asset（資產）啦」，尤其在選舉內「如果你真係想攞嗰個位嘅話」，「我會形容係名聲嘅暴發戶」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何續指，「『立場姐姐』呢個名係非常之尷尬嘅」，因為當時人們關注她是因她直播抗爭者行動，人們關注的是運動和抗爭者；但何指人們因抗爭者是「無臉孔」（faceless）而無法知道其身份，故關注「就去晒揸機嗰個人度喇」。何續指雖然積聚在「立場姐姐」的政治能量非常大，但其實這股能量並不是因為她本人而積聚起來，而是「好多無名抗爭者嘅行動，佢哋帶畀香港人嘅感受聚合而成嘅一個 icon」，因此認為該稱呼是屬於整場運動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱若取過半票數可奪局面主導權&quot;&gt;何稱若取過半票數可奪局面主導權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何提及入議會「唔係講緊再投議員入去議事咁簡單，而係要奪取主導權，將立法會變成人民嘅武器」，何重申議會是反映人民意願的場所，而《國安法》即將實施時，大家有很強烈「無嘢做到」或「唔知做咩好」的心態，而她認為若匯聚到百萬港人，「投一個足以喺立法會過半嘅票數出嚟」，便能奪取當時局面的主導權，政權便需作出回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第89天。何桂藍繼續作供，表示新東協調會議爭議重點並非應否否決預算案，而是為避免DQ要「褪到咩地步」，而當時與會者談及否決對民生的影響，她認為是擔心選民反應而非出於民生考慮，指民主派多年來均理解「民生從來都係政府不當地動用公帑嘅一個掩眼法」。何又指，當時提出若表明「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力」仍被DQ，溫和選民便會明白DQ是任意的政治決定，而非「乖唔乖」的問題，但會上就「會」或「會積極」無結論，她預期之後會有協議但最終也沒有。何並指，認為用「不民主」形容戴耀廷是「好唔公道」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就控方指何提及香港「法治無存」，何引終審法院非常任法官包致金就法治的基準，包括權力分立、人權保障等，指明顯香港「一啲都唔合格」，故「法治無存」是準確描述。何又指，對香港政府有非常多不滿但無怨恨，「因為香港政府唔值得任何人嘥精神去怨恨佢，連花時間去怨恨佢嘅價值都冇」；而對控方指她促使（foster）他人對政府怨恨，何指全港有很多人怨恨政府，「唔需要任何人去 foster」，並強調不可假設有怨恨情緒便是不理性或受人煽動。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何不認同黎敬輝指她說綱領更進取較好-指只係撳個反對掣啫&quot;&gt;何不認同黎敬輝指她說「綱領更進取較好」 指「只係撳個反對掣啫」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供，她昨談及新東第二次協調會議的情況，以及她對戴耀廷所擬運用《基本法》權力條款的理解，認為戴「寫咗一句根本乜都冇講過嘅嘢出嚟」。大律師 Trevor Beel 今展示民主動力總幹事黎敬輝就第二次會議的紀錄，提及何曾稱「如以基本法條文作出DQ，必引起大迴響，故綱領更進取較好」，問她有否說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/QYrF5eO.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指紀錄不太準確，並重申在民主制度下，而預算案「又冇乜問題」，「投反對票係講唔過去嘅，因為你好難向選民交代。」但何指，否決預算案本身的確是立法機關制衡行政機關的憲制武器之一，她理解當行政機關有非常嚴重的越權行為、發生一些事連選民都有非常強烈感受時，「立法機關係有權咁樣做嘅」，這亦是她對《基本法》第50至52條（否決財案後程序）的理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，昨討論戴耀廷草擬的「會積極運用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」一句，「我認為已經冇承諾到話一定會否決財政預算案㗎喇」，因「句嘢基本上跟住《基本法》抄出嚟咁滯㗎喇，如果咁都DQ，咁坊間嘅反應一定會好大」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何指「我唔認為呢一個取態係進取嘅」、亦「真係唔覺得我哋討論嘅嘢關進取唔進取事」，故不認同有說過「故綱領更進取較好」一句：「因為講到尾其實都只係撳個反對掣啫，當時在席嘅黨派基本上都做過呢件事喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱若條款提用基本法權力仍dq-溫和選民便會明白dq是任意政治決定不關乎乖唔乖&quot;&gt;何稱若條款提用基本法權力仍DQ 溫和選民便會明白DQ是任意政治決定不關乎「乖唔乖」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍昨稱，鄒家成會上提出「唔可以用積極，要用會（運用）」，她最後有支持。何重申，個人覺得「會」或「積極」分別不大，而她之所以就此爭議表態，「係因為我感覺到當時喺會入面，支持『積極』嘅一方係有一種想褪嘅感覺」，故她當時表示「呢句嘢已經冇問題到直程係《基本法》抄出嚟咁滯喇」，不認同還要用「積極」這些「跳嚟跳去」的字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在法官追問下再指，就「必引起大迴響」，她有表達類似意思，解釋她理解有些與會者想字眼「冇咁肯定」，是因溫和選民一直有種想法，認為DQ「係有據可依嘅，唔係 arbitrary（任意）嘅」，亦經常說「嗰啲人唔自己玩嘢就唔會被DQ」，並「不斷同候選人講你要醒少少，入到去先慢慢玩，唔好畀人DQ」，簡單而言「佢哋係認為無論政府條紅線畫得有幾過份，都應該迎合咗先」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，認為當時有些溫和派係是想附和這些選民的想法，但她「非常之唔同意」，而她如此提出，就是因認為「單純地重複《基本法》入面立法會議員嘅權力，我相信連啲溫和選民都冇可能覺得咁樣係玩緊嘢」，而「如果咁都DQ，咁佢哋就終於會明白，DQ 從來都係一個 arbitrary 嘅政治決定，唔係邊個乖邊個唔乖嘅問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱否決財案非爭議重點-而是為避dq可褪到什麼地步&quot;&gt;何稱否決財案非爭議重點 而是為避DQ可褪到什麼地步&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，法官昨引述區諾軒指爭議是應否否決預算案，但「我唔認同呢個係當時爭議嘅重點，我認為當時個會入面個氣氛，其實就係拗緊究竟為咗避DQ你要褪到咩地步」，但何重申，認為「運用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力」根本是句「tautology（同義反覆、贅述）」：「你做立法會議員，梗係會運用權力㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱會上無就會或積極投票-亦無結論&quot;&gt;何稱會上無就「會」或「積極」投票 亦無結論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就黎敬輝紀錄指戴耀廷提及「其他區都支持否決 budget」，何指無印象，至於黎指戴提到「形勢變化快 唔好寫死」，何指戴應有表達。至於黎的紀錄提到「『會運用』 - 投票通過」，何指「我只能夠話我冇記憶我有投過呢個票」，亦記得會議最終就「會」或「會積極」運用基本法權力並無結論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指與會者提民生影響僅擔心選民反應民生為政府不當用公帑掩眼法&quot;&gt;何指與會者提民生影響僅擔心選民反應、民生為政府不當用公帑掩眼法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問及，會議上有沒有人提到，如預算案有學校、醫院等項目就不能否決，李運騰亦指這是區諾軒證供（翻查資料，應為趙家賢說法）。何表示，「當時區諾軒咁講我已經覺得好奇怪啦」，並指當時應有討論，個別政黨以往「不嬲都有投反對票」，而他們反對的預算案也會有「民生嘢」，「咁但係點解（議席）冇半數嘅時候你就反對，反而有半數真係反對到嘅時候你又想唔投呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，理解當時有人提出「民生嘢」，是擔心選民反應、「講緊點樣同選民去解釋」，而不是談及發言者本身「會因為民生嘢、醫院學校而覺得唔應該否決（預算案）」。何並指，因當時政府和建制的攻擊是「總之你阻住政府攞錢你就係破壞民生」，但她認為不合理，舉例政府一方面會公屋減租，但另一方面「又 chur 你幾百億咁」，形容多年來所有光譜的民主派均共同理解：「民生從來都係政府不當地動用公帑嘅一個掩眼法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指明白何有她的看法，但法庭關注的是誰說了什麼。何續說，當時認為應不會有民主派「就咁話因為有一啲民生嘢」，而認為預算案不應反對，但「點樣應對建制派嘅歪曲同埋解釋畀市民聽」，就一直是問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又指，部分溫和民主派政黨有「前科」，就是於2004年民主派接近過半時，曾討論要否發出聯合政綱提到「絕不否決財政預算案同癱瘓政府」。何指否決預算案更多是向選民解釋和交代的問題，因當時民主動力召集人鄭宇碩曾提及，此做法是因為當時工商界和建制派攻擊，稱「民主派一旦過半，香港就冧㗎喇」。何欲再解釋時被陳慶偉打斷，指不認為需要再聽下去，Beel 亦說何的答案已足夠，何一度說：「畀我完埋呢句」，陳慶偉說「no」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何不肯定鄒家成有否說過推我哋入去立法會癱瘓政府&quot;&gt;何不肯定鄒家成有否說過「推我哋入去立法會癱瘓政府」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到會上有否提到不予區別否決預算案，何指「如果係『不予區別』呢4隻中文字係冇囉」。法官陳慶偉續問及，黎敬輝紀錄指鄒家成提及「如我們不決意，如何說服香港人於初選投票，推我哋入去立法會癱瘓政府」，何指理解鄒當時望字眼「講實啲」就是想展示一種意志，「否則香港人唔會喺初選投票」，故應有說過前兩句，但不肯定有否說過「推我哋入去立法會癱瘓政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱會後預期有協議惟終沒有-後因國安法宣布亦轉移焦點&quot;&gt;何稱會後預期有協議惟終沒有 後因《國安法》宣布亦轉移焦點&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黎敬輝的紀錄亦提到，戴耀廷指「功能組別的參選人也可邀請簽協議書，如有政黨背景，更加方便都可簽」。何指不肯定戴有否這樣說，但會上有討論初選提名表格會附上一份綱領或協議書的文件，「嗰啲咩『積極』或者『會』（運用基本法權力）全部都喺個附件入面」，是「一啲立場宣示」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，會議結束時理解「係會有份咁嘅嘢嘅」，即預期會有一份向公眾公開的協議，但因當時離初選還有一兩個月，第二次會議結束時「嗰份嘢未成形」，她以為接下來的一兩個月「我哋會搞掂佢」。Beel 問會上達成什麼協議，何舉例首次會議仍在討論是否及何時辦初選，但第二次會議就確認7月辦初選，不過就目標議席是6抑或6+1席就未有結論，她當時期望會在協議處理或解決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，會後沒有收過任何紀錄或文件，最終亦沒有任何協議，並指「好老實講，喺5月底《國安法》宣布咗之後，我會形容大家嘅關注焦點都已經唔再喺呢度喇」，包括她自己，故她「當時都冇去好 chur 住咁去跟進份嘢到底打成點」。陳仲衡問為何《國安法》後會有改變，何指因《國安法》對每人都是「好大嘅威脅」，當時會有很多考慮如是否繼續選、如繼續會否有何修正、「啲單張使唔使印到一半都 call 返返嚟呀，又要重新 draft 過」等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指用不民主形容戴耀廷是好唔公道&quot;&gt;何指用不民主形容戴耀廷是「好唔公道」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，基本上所有關於初選的新聞她都有關注，就其他區協調的情況可能與其他候選人私下交談會知道，但沒有正式的文件。Beel 續問，那何桂藍認為戴耀廷主持會議的方式是「不民主」嗎？何搖頭：「我認為用不民主嚟形容戴耀廷係一個好唔公道嘅講法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何引包致金標準指法治無存是客觀陳述&quot;&gt;何引包致金標準指「法治無存」是客觀陳述&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，控方開案陳詞指何桂藍提及「香港制度崩壞、法治無存」，對政權有怨恨，問何2020年時對香港政府有否怨恨？法庭傳譯將「resentment」譯作「不滿」，何主動稱應譯作「怨恨」，並指她當時對香港政府「有非常多嘅不滿，不過冇怨恨，因為香港政府唔值得任何人嘥精神去怨恨佢，連花時間去怨恨佢嘅價值都冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又指，認為該句引述是「客觀嘅陳述」，指「制度崩壞我哋都講過好多喇」，而一個地方有否法治其實有客觀基準，並引終審法院非常任法官包致金於2018年，討論一個不民主的地方法治是否可能時，提到4點，包括要有司法獨立和一份不是朝令夕改的憲法；權力之間要分立；人權要有合法國際基準的保障；不可聲稱有法治就暫停民主化步伐。惟何指：「好明顯呢四點香港一啲都唔合格，所以我認為『法治無存』係一個準確嘅描述。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指港府不值得任何人花精神怨恨不能假設港人怨恨是受人煽動&quot;&gt;何指港府不值得任何人花精神怨恨、不能假設港人怨恨是受人煽動&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並主動指，控方該句是指控她促使其他人對香港政府的怨恨（foster resentment），但何指「我對自己公開發言嘅要求係好嚴謹嘅，我只會講有理有據、說服到我自己嘅嘢，嗰啲係一啲事實，同埋一啲有理據嘅批評」，何又補充，「我同意全香港有好多人都好怨恨個政府，係唔需要任何人去 foster 㗎喇，亦都唔可以假設係因為有一個怨恨嘅情緒，佢背後就冇一個理性嘅基礎、或者一定需要人煽動，而唔係佢哋自己嘅判斷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早休時，何桂藍親友向她說：「我愛你呀！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SlUNJ3p.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第89天。何桂藍繼續作供，表示看到《國安法》後有兩個反應，首先是「要走就而家好走喇，如果唔係可能一世都走唔到」，其次是「佢哋終於搵到個可以DQ晒全世界嘅理據」。何指當時決定不離開香港，並公開表態反對《國安法》，解釋內地政治犯會以言入罪，而她已發表過很多「會瀨嘢」的言論，因此「避都冇用」。何指料反對《國安法》必定會被DQ，但作為追求民主的人，不反對是「自相矛盾」。惟何亦指，就《國安法》條文列明「干擾」政權機關履行職能，她從無想過「撳個反對掣都算係干預」，因對她而言投票「連議會抗爭都唔算」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，雖料無法入閘仍參與初選，是因選舉是社會運動的一部分，望透過候選人身位參與公共討論，影響更多人想法。何又指當時很多港人無法以遊行表達立場，故望初選「攞一個最大嘅票數」，讓港人透過選舉明確展示他們的政治意志，「就係唔接受《國安法》」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方問及何桂藍對國安法理解-何稱5月底已提針對癱瘓立法會行為&quot;&gt;辯方問及何桂藍對《國安法》理解 何稱5月底已提針對癱瘓立法會行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供。大律師 Trevor Beel 問何桂藍何時首次得知《國安法》，何指應是5月21或22日，全國人大常委會副委員長王晨在北京宣布，全國人大通過授權人大常委為香港訂立《國安法》，且當時已提及特別針對癱瘓立法會的行為。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至5月28日正式通過訂立《國安法》，何指當時已知道有四大罪名，即顛覆、恐怖活動、分裂國家和勾結外國勢力。何續指當時無詳細提及癱瘓立法會，但因4月中聯辦和港澳辦譴責郭榮鏗或民主派時均用相同字眼，故當時理解議員開會時做一些抗議行為「都有機會觸犯《國安法》喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，至6月30日晚《國安法》全文頒布並實施，當中四大罪名下的條款詳細了很多，亦無再用「癱瘓立法會」字眼，而改為用「seriously interfere（嚴重干擾）、undermine（破壞）和 disrupt（阻撓）」等字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱國安法實際條文涵蓋更闊-惟從無想過投反對都算干預&quot;&gt;何稱《國安法》實際條文涵蓋更闊 惟從無想過投反對都算「干預」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，何桂藍閱讀條文後，有確認她早前認為《國安法》立法是用以針對癱瘓政府的行為嗎？何更正是指「癱瘓立法會」，並指兩辦於4月已用「癱瘓」形容一些她認為符合議事規則的事，當時她只是有「憂慮」；但到了6月《國安法》條文使用「干預」或「阻撓」等字眼、亦沒有提「武力」，她理解「癱瘓」字面上明顯比「干擾（interfere）」更嚴重。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，理解大陸法律字眼可「亂咁詮釋」，並認為這意味一般她認為是履行議員責任、盡責審議的行為也會被視為「干預」、納入《國安法》罪行內，舉例若立會主席做了有問題的決定，要求終止辯論，而議員不同意其決定並要求繼續辯論，一般人也會理解為「干預」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何強調，在整個控罪期間，「我都真係冇諗過撳個反對掣都算係干預，因為對我嚟講，投票或者投反對票，真係連議會抗爭都唔算。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱看到國安法後決定不離開香港&quot;&gt;何稱看到《國安法》後決定不離開香港&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，《國安法》後何桂藍有否改變自己參選做法。何指「我哋講返5月尾先啦」，並指當時看到《國安法》消息時有兩個反應，「第一就係要走就而家好走喇，如果唔係可能一世都走唔到喇；第二就係，佢哋終於搵到個可以DQ晒全世界嘅理據。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋，因當時已宣布會透過直接納入《基本法》附件三的方式實行《國安法》，「咁好容易就話你一表態反對《國安法》，就係唔擁護《基本法》喇。」何續說，「咁我第一個決定就係唔走啦」，Beel 問何說「走」是什麼意思，何說是「離開香港」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指不知國安法有否追溯力-但已講咗好多會瀨嘢嘅嘢避都無用&quot;&gt;何指不知《國安法》有否追溯力 但已「講咗好多會瀨嘢嘅嘢」避都無用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，第二個決定是關於會否公開表態反對《國安法》。何指，因為以前記者的工作，「我對中國大陸嘅政治犯嘅情況都有啲理解」，並指雖然內地《國安法》2016年才訂立，但四大罪名在《刑法》存在已久，如劉曉波、許志永等案例，簡單而言是「以言入罪」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「喺中國大陸，你印一張『平反六四』嘅紙出嚟貼喺個巴士站上面，你都瀨嘢㗎喇」，故：「當時我真係完全冇辦法設想，究竟一條咁嘅法例，擺喺普通法嘅法制入面會發生咩事，我只能根據我對大陸嗰個實行嘅情況嘅了解去做判斷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「我 at that point in time（當時），我已經講咗好多會瀨嘢嘅嘢喇，咁所以，避都冇用喇。」陳仲衡指，但何不應回望過去，而是想將要發生的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何回應「呢個係一個普通法 logic（邏輯）嘅諗法，但係因為佢係納入附件三，所以當時冇人知佢會唔會 retrospective（追溯）咁去計一啲嘢」。何續說：「作為一個怕死嘅香港人，咁我唔會再講一啲我以前未講嘅、更加激進嘅嘢喇，但係以前已經講開嘅嘢，既然已經講咗，亦都冇辦法確保佢唔係 retrospective 嘅話呢，咁就繼續講喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱作為追求民主的人不反對國安法是自相矛盾&quot;&gt;何稱作為追求民主的人不反對《國安法》是自相矛盾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問她認為這會如何影響她參選的機會？何自言作為候選人本身有一個好強的優勢，就是她做記者時不可發表任何個人強烈的政見，故基本上《國安法》議題出現前，「我係白紙一張，好難去DQ嘅」，「但係如果我公開講我反對《國安法》，我當時嘅判斷係一定就DQ喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何停下思考一會再說，但她認為即使她不完全了解《國安法》條文，但看到四大罪名和公布時中國官員的用字，「我會認為作為一個追求民主嘅人，唔反對一條咁樣嘅法例係自相矛盾。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何表示，於5月21或22日得知通過訂立《國安法》後，當晚就在 Facebook 發文表態反對《國安法》以當時形式在香港實現，何直言「我講嗰個 moment，我就知一定DQ㗎喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱反對國安法一刻已料無法入閘做得一日得一日&quot;&gt;何稱反對《國安法》一刻已料無法入閘、「做得一日得一日」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後問，何既然明知DQ，為何仍參與初選。何重申，認為立法會選舉本身是運動的一部分，而取得過半並非立會戰線努力的唯一目的；尤其是5月底《國安法》公布後，已預視下一屆立法會將出現很大變化，能入閘的人會很少，甚至當時很多人已在猜《國安法》實施後，9月便不會有立法會選舉，「所以對我嚟講，基本上就係一個『做得一日得一日』嘅心態。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，即是做什麼？參與初選？何回應，參與初選「就係講緊其實你用一個候選人嘅身位，去參與個公共討論，去影響更加多人嘅想法」。陳慶偉問，故何的目的只是要影響他人？何說在當時時間點，「我嘅目的，係我希望可以喺無論最終選舉又好、如果冇最終選舉就係初選，攞一個最大嘅 turn out，攞一個最大嘅票數。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指明知dq仍參與初選是爭取最大票數-讓港人展示政治意志&quot;&gt;何指明知DQ仍參與初選是爭取最大票數 讓港人展示政治意志&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何解釋，因2020年5、6月時，警方已不可能再發「不反對通知書」，「係冇可能進行到公開嘅遊行咁滯，基本上你行出地鐵站，就會畀警察 cap 埋一齊、拉咗你先喇。」何指，因此「即使有好多嘅香港人想表達佢哋嘅一啲立場，佢哋係無辦法用行動去表達出嚟，個社會係唔會見得到究竟有幾多人係反對一啲嘢」。何續指，「當時選舉就係一個 alternative（替代），畀香港人明確展示佢哋當時嘅政治意志，就係唔接受《國安法》。」何說時法官呈思考狀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問何是談及初選抑或立法會選舉，何指如9月還有選舉就是指正式選舉，但當時廣泛憂慮是屆時不會有正式選舉，「咁如果無正式選舉，初選就好緊要。」何又補充，當她說要取得最大票數時，不是指自己的票數，而是指「成個初選越多人投票越好」，同意這可以展示他們對政府的不滿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/wTeXTTq.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（21日）踏入審訊第89天。何桂藍繼續作供，表示非常不認同戴耀廷毋須簽協議的決定，認為協議條款只是承認立會有否決權，無理由這樣也不敢確認；並指簽署「墨落無悔」就是明確表態，「至少我敢去公開要講呢句說話」，若終被DQ也是政府「使橫手」，不容承認立會有權以否決財案爭取訴求。對有人稱被「夾」而簽聲明，何指如有候選人感受到壓力，是來自選民；並指她就「墨落」看重的，是候選人是否因「不合理的DQ紅線」而「無底線褪後」立場、認為要清楚向選民交代。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又表明，認為否決預算案無法直接迫使特首回應五大訴求，最多只是施壓；而她認同聲明「議會絕非抗爭終點」一句，因不想給予民眾「假希望」立會可迫政府行事，認為其他形式抗爭也要繼續。何指這是香港民主運動慣性，雖明知議會「冇乜嘢做到」，但亦講到「好重要」，造成選民「一勞永逸、投咗票就OK」的感覺，故要誠實指出議會是無法爭取五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱事前不知有墨落無聚焦共同綱領但認會上就辦初選等有共識&quot;&gt;何稱事前不知有「墨落」、無聚焦「共同綱領」但認會上就辦初選等有共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍今繼續作供，辯方續就「墨落無悔」聲明書發問。何表示，她「碌Facebook」時看到其他候選人發布該聲明，指她從新聞得知戴耀廷於6月9日記者會表明不要求參選人簽任何協議，她留意到有不滿和不同意的聲音，但事前不知道會用聲明的形式去表達不滿。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，當時看到聲明後問其中一名參選人，獲告知想表態可加名。何指理解聲明是各區參選人「想簽就可以簽」，而「我睇完係有意向簽嘅」，遂複製帖文並加上自己名字發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對聲明提及「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎」，何指不清楚其他區的協議，但理解新東開兩次會後，雖就共同綱領具體內容和目標議席等打算「之後再講」，但就舉行公民投票和辦論壇有取得共識。何承認當時焦點無放在「共同綱領」，而是關注聲明內的兩點聲明，但理解協調會議「的確有一啲嘢取得咗大家共識」，亦是大家合作基礎，「唔係傾咁耐傾嚟做咩呢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指否決財案無法直接迫特首回應五大訴求最多只是施壓&quot;&gt;何指否決財案無法直接迫特首回應五大訴求、最多只是施壓&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就聲明提及「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，Beel 問除了否決預算案，何桂藍認為立法會還有什麼權力可迫使特首回應五大訴求？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何表示：「首先我唔認為否決財政預算案可以迫使特首直接回應五大訴求」，指因眾所周知，否決預算案後特首「可能」會解散立法會，然後又要再投票，再看是否否決多一次預算案，惟何指上述「每一步都係唔確定」，如第一步特首便可能不會解散立會，「所以我當時係好唔認同大家跳咗好多 steps 咁樣，將否決財政預算案同落實五大訴求痴埋一齊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，因此否決預算案「無辦法直接迫到特首去回應五大訴求」，「佢最多只係施壓，但之後政府會用咩去回應，係講唔埋嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指無需35盡責審議亦可施壓要齊人返工就是建制派地獄&quot;&gt;何指無需35+、盡責審議亦可施壓：要「齊人返工」就是建制派地獄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，立法會有很多不同施壓的權力，如「盡責審議」本身亦會構成壓力。她舉例，何啟明曾提到民主派過半就是建制派地獄，但她認為無需民主派過半，「因為對建制派嚟講，地獄唔係熄佢咪或者趕佢出去，而係要建制派齊人返工」，旁聽席大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何微微轉向旁聽席舉起手指說：「呢個唔係一個笑話」，並解釋如民主派議員人數很多，達32或33人，「建制派就要確保佢永遠都夠人，否則一旦表決或點人數，好容易政府嘅法案就會推唔到。」何並指，以她跟進多年立會新聞的理解，「政府淨係要確保啲建制派議員喺特定嘅時刻齊人喺立法會唔好曠工，已經要好多嘅人力」，又舉例民主派取得34席，在財委會基本上已可否決所有議案。惟何表示，當時沒有討論如何可令政府回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指簽聲明是明確表態立會有否決權若dq是政府使橫手&quot;&gt;何指簽聲明是明確表態立會有否決權、若DQ是政府「使橫手」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問何桂藍為何決定簽「墨落無悔」，何解釋戴耀廷宣布毋須簽協議時，「我係非常之驚訝」，解釋因一旦宣布參與初選便等於參與正式選舉，要計選舉開支，故當時認為是6月尾才處理。惟何指當時還未談得攏，亦無人通知過她會有記者會和有此決定，戴就公開說毋須簽協議，而當時何根本不知道其他候選人對很多事情的立場，新東亦有多名預料會勝選的候選人無去協調會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何表示，認為問題仍在於「太害怕DQ」，指戴原本草擬「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」的條款，甚至無要求斬釘截鐵說會否決財案，而是承認《基本法》下立法會有此權力。何續說：「有乜理由去參選立法會，但係連立法會有咁樣嘅權力，都唔敢去確認？咁樣同你話就算我入到去，我乜都唔會做，乜都唔會反對，有乜嘢分別？所以我非常之唔認同。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，當時理解「墨落」是讓她明確表態，「至少我敢去公開要講呢句說話」，並指如她最後被DQ亦不是她問題，而是「政府連承認立法會有權否決財政預算案去爭取一個訴求，咁樣佢都容納唔到，要使橫手去DQ，所以我簽名」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指問題是太害怕dq-看重候選人是否因不合理紅線無底線褪後&quot;&gt;何指問題是「太害怕DQ」 看重候選人是否因不合理紅線「無底線褪後」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續指，控方開案陳詞指何透過簽署「墨落無悔」，「顯示堅定不移的決心進行謀劃」（“…show her determination to maintain unwavering insurgence in carrying out the Scheme”），問她有何回應？何指以她理解，「應該係巴勒斯坦有埋火箭砲嗰啲先叫得上 insurgence（叛亂）」，無法理解「投一個反對票就係 insurgence」，指「香港應該未出現過配得上呢個字嘅反抗行動囉」。法官陳仲衡則指，理解該字眼是在談及「35+計劃」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續同意，簽署「墨落」前已知道會被DQ，但她認為紅線並非否決財案，若純粹因建制媒體或建制派不斷攻擊而「咁大陣仗要避咗佢」，「好老實講，如果喺選之前都已經係咁樣，選完之後、《國安法》立完之後，又點樣期望唔願意作出呢個宣示（會運用基本法權力，包括否決財政預算案）嘅人，係願意作出一啲明確反抗嘅行為呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰其後問，由於何當時認為自己隨時被DQ，所以認為自己無甚機會成為議員？何肯定說：「冇機會。」李再問，所以她會認為無甚機會讓她行使權力，對預算案投反對票？何答：「冇錯。」惟何指，無論最後她本人能否投票否決，就「墨落無悔」她看重的，就是民主派候選人「係咪因為一啲唔合理嘅DQ紅線，個公開立場就要無底線咁褪後，我認為有一啲基本嘅立場係一定要向選民交代清楚嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何認同議會絕非抗爭終點-因不想給予民眾假希望&quot;&gt;何認同「議會絕非抗爭終點」 因不想給予民眾假希望&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問何對聲明中「我們深明議會絕非抗爭終點」的看法，何指以其理解，當時有候選人會直接將35+和落實五大訴求掛勾，但她認為會給予選民一種錯誤印象，「好似攞咗35個位就真係迫到政府做嘢咁。」但何指當時很多人都很清楚「35+係無可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，她認同該句說話，「因為唔想畀民眾一個假嘅希望，令佢哋覺得立法會真係可以直接迫使到政府」，而她認為其他形式的抗爭都要繼續嘗試。何又指，這是一直以來香港民主運動的「慣性」，「就係雖然明知個議會冇乜嘢做到，但係都會講到個議會好重要，贏多幾席就真係會有啲嘢做到咁」，鄒家成聞言微笑和點頭。何續指，但這會造成選民「有種一勞永逸、投咗票就OK嘅感覺」，「所以我覺得要誠實，議會係冇辦法幫大家攞到五大訴求返嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指戴耀廷本身攬炒第八步才到國安法-惟第一步未開始已來臨&quot;&gt;何指戴耀廷本身「攬炒」第八步才到《國安法》 惟第一步未開始已來臨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，何提及的觀點，戴耀廷或其他初選組織者也抱持同樣看法嗎？何指，「我剛剛講嘅慣性嗰樣嘢其實就係『虛擬自由主義』，係好多年嚟對傳統民主派嘅批評」，林卓廷說「哇」，陳志全發笑，旁聽席亦傳來笑聲。陳慶偉重複問組織者是否抱持該看法，何問即什麼看法，陳指簡言之，即35+計劃是浪費時間和金錢，Beel 補充是立法會並不能達成任何事，包括五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指她並無表達過陳慶偉所指的看法，李運騰聞言皺眉掩臉，陳說那是他從何的答案所得出的結論。李指或可用何自己的說法，問戴耀廷等組織者是否也有「虛擬自由主義」的看法，何聽問題時忍不住發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，記得大規模DQ發生後，戴耀廷曾發文指35+已大功告成，大意是因為民主派未真的採取行動，「中共已經 overreact（過度反應）到咁嘅地步」，而《國安法》5月底宣布後，美國已即時取消香港特殊地位，何形容是很多人對「攬炒」的理解，故當時很多人說「中共已經率先炒晒全世界」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指35不可能在參與關注初選人中流傳甚廣&quot;&gt;何指「35+」不可能在參與關注初選人中流傳甚廣&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此時陳慶偉主動說，「我認為我們要休息」，指不認為何桂藍有回答問題，Beel 亦指「我需要休息」，指需時查看筆記。何在小休後，表明不想給予民眾假希望「係我由一開始參與初選以嚟嘅立場」，至於組織者是否抱持相同看法，何指戴耀廷的「攬炒十步」本身數到第八步才到《國安法》實施，「但係第一步都未開始，《國安法》就嚟咗喇」，而區諾軒6月亦曾撰文一方面熱切講初選，一方面亦提及多人被捕，不知自己明天會否被捕。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，當時大家一邊辦初選，但「其實對於聽日發生咩事係唔知道嘅」，並認為當時在參與初選或關注討論初選的人中，「35+不可能」是頗流傳甚廣的說法，舉例6月的初選論壇她不斷問公民黨若「35-」怎辦，超區王百羽亦稱「35+傾嚟做乜鬼吖」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指戴耀廷曾指民主派會取46我哋凡人無法理解&quot;&gt;何指戴耀廷曾指民主派會取「46+」：我哋凡人無法理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於戴耀廷是否認為「35+」不可能？此時何舉起左手食指望着 Beel：「嗱大家如果覺得以下呢樣嘢好痴線唔係我嘅責任，我只係覆述返我當時見到戴耀廷講嘅嘢啫」，並指如她沒記錯，「戴耀廷呢個時候（5、6月左右）係喺啲報紙上面計緊40+嘅」，「佢甚至（在文章或公開場合）係話46+添」，陳志全等發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 追問，所以戴認為35+不可能？何說：「我覺得我哋呢啲凡人係冇辦法理解戴耀廷係覺得乜嘢可能、乜嘢唔可能」，多人聞言發笑。何在追問下解釋，戴是以數據推算議席問題，如果只是看選民登記、看民主和建制相比，而不看政治現實，「我會理解到佢點解會覺得嗰啲嘢係可能。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何不同意墨落是抗爭派挑戰組織者夾傳統民主派-如感壓力是來自選民&quot;&gt;何不同意「墨落」是抗爭派挑戰組織者、「夾」傳統民主派 如感壓力是來自選民&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 最後問，何是否認為「墨落」是抗爭派試圖挑戰組織者，何不同意。Beel 問，那「墨落」是否抗爭派迫使傳統民主派採取相同立場？何指其他證人是用「夾」一字，並指當時如有其他政黨人士感受到壓力，該壓力並非直接來自抗爭派，因這是場選舉，最終都是看選民反應，而她理解當時選民「比較多都係唔認同一種無底線退讓嘅路線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，至於個別候選人想用自己理念說服這些選民其決定正確，抑或會受選民影響而採納「佢哋自己未必認同嘅立場」，是他們自己的「政治判斷」，「將呢樣嘢講成係其他人『夾』你或者逼你，我覺得就抽空咗選民意願嘅嗰一 part。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何最後指，這份聲明講到尾，就她個人理解，是讓候選人表達是否採納當中的兩點聲明立場，「至少我自己去簽嘅時候，我只係諗我自己要向選民交代一個乜嘢訊息，當時我腦入面冇諗到我要透過呢個行為去令到其他候選人點樣樣。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 表示就「墨落無悔」的部分完結，將就提名表格等發問。案件下周一續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，今午本案認罪保釋被告呂智恆前來聽審，於午休時與何桂藍打招呼，並以手勢交流。社民連陳皓桓、記協主席陳朗昇等也有來旁聽，何一度問陳：「點解你喺度嘅？」&lt;/p&gt;

In this article, Runar Spansvoll examines how Russia has made use of such aggressive and coercive sub-threshold activities in the political, information and military domains between 2014–23 in a campaign to compel Oslo to comply with its foreign and security policy objectives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s increasingly self-assertive and revisionist foreign and security policy may not have received sufficient attention in the West until the sudden and illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. Although the seizure sent geopolitical shockwaves into capitals around the world, the subsequent political response did not deter President Vladimir Putin from attempting to subjugate the whole of Ukraine in 2022. These two watershed events – the latter of which is still unfolding – have led to an almost complete collapse in relations with the West, including Norway, one of Russia’s immediate neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Norway’s perspective, the deterioration in bilateral relations since 2014 has been visible through the degradation of political dialogue, cases of espionage, cyber attacks and a substantial increase in coercive military activity, as described in the following sections. From the Russian perspective, its security concerns related to Norway seem primarily linked to Norway’s administration and use of Svalbard, the presence of NATO forces in Norway and in its adjoining seas, and the Norwegian sanctions policy. Historically, these matters have been insufficient cause for escalation as Russia has had an enduring interest in “preserving the Arctic as a territory of peace”, isolated from conflicts elsewhere. Nevertheless, Russia’s renewed invasion of Ukraine makes it evident that its risk perception and acceptance exceeds traditional parameters, making its foreign policy conduct and role as an actor in the international system unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article explores Moscow’s campaign to influence and coerce Oslo into complying with its foreign and security policy objectives in the timeframe between 2014 and early 2023. These efforts can be grouped into the political, information and military domains where activities have remained under the threshold for armed conflict. Although the primary focus of this article is on Norway, it is important to recognise that Russia’s actions are not isolated incidents. Indeed, several of the actions taken by Russia against Norway are reflective of its broader patterns of behaviour towards other NATO partners. Therefore, this article should be considered a case study in Russian coercive actions to influence political decision-making, highlighting the comprehensive nature of Moscow’s disruptive actions and contributing to increased awareness of the wider phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diplomacy-norway-is-a-member-of-nato-nato-is-not-a-friend-of-russia&quot;&gt;Diplomacy: Norway is a Member of NATO; NATO is not a Friend of Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 is considered a turning point in Russo-Norwegian relations. Shortly after the annexation, Norway implemented sanctions in line with those of the EU. In turn, Russia is believed to have orchestrated the subsequent refugee crisis at the Russo-Norwegian border crossing station in Storskog in the last quarter of 2015. According to former prime minister Erna Solberg, Russia did this by assisting or allowing more than 5,000 refugees from various conflict zones to seek asylum at the border. This represented a significant increase compared with the first half of 2015, when only 40 people applied for asylum at the border. The situation bears similarities to the 2021 migration crisis on the border between the EU and Belarus, where Alexander Lukashenko’s regime used illegal immigration as a political weapon in response to Western and EU sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another instance of political manoeuvring, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov used the 2020 centenary of the Svalbard Treaty to formally protest violations of the treaty on the grounds of discrimination against Russian economic activity in the archipelago, demanding bilateral negotiations. However, Oslo dismissed the demand on the grounds that “Norway does not negotiate with anyone over what is Norwegian”, causing outrage in the Russian media. Although the protest was based on allegations of economic discrimination against Russia’s symbolic Arktikugol coal mining company in Barentsburg, the underlying concern was likely related to the geostrategic location of Svalbard in relation to Russia’s strategic nuclear forces on the Kola Peninsula. That is also why the Svalbard satellite station (SvalSat) has been criticised by Russian officials who claim that the facility serves dual-use purposes. SvalSat is operated by the part government-owned Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) and the Norwegian Space Agency and is vital in communicating with satellites in low polar orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2021, the Russian Embassy in Oslo openly criticised Norway for alleged violations of its self-imposed 1949 basing policy, which includes restrictions on foreign military presence in Norway. Specifically, the Embassy stated that Norway had allowed US nuclear attack submarines and strategic bombers to use Norwegian ports and airports, which it argued violated the 1949 policy. The Embassy also criticised the 2021 US-Norwegian Supplementary Defense Cooperation Agreement (SDCA), which grants the US increased jurisdiction over its military personnel and infrastructure within defined areas in Norway, enables joint training and exercises, sharing of military infrastructure and technology, and cooperation on security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relations deteriorated further on 25 October 2021, when Lavrov met with his newly appointed Norwegian counterpart, Anniken Huitfeldt. In the subsequent statement to the press, he announced that “Norway is a member of NATO, and NATO is not a friend of Russia”. Lavrov’s statement represented continuity in de facto relations since 2014, however, his directness in challenging the cornerstone of Norwegian security policy signalled change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Russia’s attempted full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Norway implemented sanctions mirroring those of the EU, and continues to supply Ukraine with military hardware and funds. This resulted in Moscow listing Norway as a “nation unfriendly to Russia”. In addition, in July 2022 Russian politicians suggested invalidating the much-celebrated 2010 Russo-Norwegian maritime delimitation treaty – the result of four decades of negotiations – as an indirect, punitive response to Norwegian sanctions. The reaction from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has so far been that the treaty does not have a clause on termination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the entrenched political positions, the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS) assesses that Moscow considers its diplomatic means the most influential towards Oslo, followed by – or reinforced with – military power projection. Therefore, Russia’s diplomatic signalling must also be seen in conjunction with the other instruments of Russian power, such as its “information confrontations” and military force demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;information-and-disinformation-conflicting-narratives&quot;&gt;Information and Disinformation: Conflicting Narratives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of Russia’s whole-of-government approach to its foreign and security policy objectives, its diplomatic efforts are regularly supported by information and cyber operations to reinforce the Russian narrative, while sowing doubts about – or discrediting – the competing narrative. Such “weaponisation of information” is within the domain of “information confrontation”, a uniquely Russian term that includes information and cyber operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, all three Norwegian security services (the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS), the Police Security Service (PST), and the National Security Authority (NSM)) renewed their warnings of there being a high and persistent threat posed by Russian state and non-state actors in spreading disinformation and conducting cyber operations. According to the three services, Russian state or state-affiliated actors are the most severe threats to Norwegian domestic security interests and actively attempt to influence the government’s decision-making processes, limit strategic options and weaken Norwegian national security interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI), Norway is likely not among Russia’s most prioritised targets. However, there is a persistent effort by Russia’s GRU (foreign military intelligence) and SVR (foreign intelligence service) in Norway. Their general objectives are likely “to weaken Western democracies through increased polarization, weakening public confidence in the government, and undermining and manipulating the perception of reality to both its own and other countries’ populations”. It is also likely that their specific objectives towards Norway are to “influence attitudes in the Norwegian population and Norway’s position in international politics” due to its geostrategic location, in combination with it being a NATO member. Furthermore, the FFI report states that “Russian authorities and personnel at the Russian Embassy in Oslo are active, both through diplomacy, intelligence, lobbying, and editorial and social media activity”. Recently, on 13 April 2023, Norwegian authorities expelled 15 persons employed at the Russian Embassy in Oslo on the grounds that “their activities are a threat to Norwegian interests” according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Anniken Huitfeldt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian information operations are often based on official statements to the Russian and international media, at times reinforced by ambiguous or unattributable sources spreading disinformation via social media and other decentralised platforms. While Russian official statements may provide consistent – although alternative – narratives, other unattributable sources are to a greater degree used for spreading disinformation and conflicting narratives aimed at exploiting perceived vulnerabilities in democratic societies by attempting to exacerbate divisions, thereby seeking to degrade societal cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A consistent trend in Moscow’s official statements is that the Norwegian government is manipulating public opinion related to Russo-Norwegian bilateral relations. Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) spokesperson Maria Zakharova goes as far as claiming that “Norwegians are being misled [by] Oslo”. Also, Moscow has occasionally attempted to exploit perceived divisions in Norway through statements such as “Oslo is ignorant of the security of ‘northerners’” by allowing US submarines to enter its northern ports. Although Moscow is failing to gain traction in its information campaign, it clearly shows that Moscow pays attention to Norwegian politics to identify areas where it can inflame societal divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another case of “weaponisation of disinformation”, Russia has resorted to falsifying Automatic Identification System (AIS) location data. One such incident involved Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN) vessels operating in the Baltic Sea on 14 June 2020. According to publicly available Marine Traffic AIS data, the two RNoN corvettes operating in the region falsely appeared to have violated Russian territorial waters outside the Kaliningrad enclave as a consequence of AIS receiver stations being fed falsified location data by non-attributable cyber-actors. Although this incident did not involve actual ships emitting the false location data, other incidents did. According to information disclosed through the Norwegian Freedom of Information Act, the RNoN points to Russia as a likely source of such disinformation in at least one specific case in September 2020, where two Russian warships operating between Norway and Denmark emitted AIS signals identifying them as Norwegian and Danish frigates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norwegian Department of Defence spokespersons stated that an adversary may have multiple purposes for falsifying location data. The manipulation of location information is seen as a broadening of ongoing disinformation campaigns in social media and the press aimed at undermining the credibility and reliability of governments and institutions in the West. Furthermore, in case of a confrontation at sea, falsified information may be used to substantiate false claims or to support allegations of violations of sovereign states’ territorial waters, thereby adding to the Russian narrative that it is surrounded by aggressors. Another aspect is that the demonstration of such capacities and capabilities is likely to support Russia’s wider strategic deterrence signalling. In another noteworthy event, Putin signed the Russian Federation’s 2022 Maritime Doctrine on 31 July 2022. This doctrine places an increased emphasis on employing civilian vessels for military purposes, potentially further blurring the lines between combatants and non-combatants at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trend is Russia’s continuous effort to export its “memorial diplomacy” to Norway. In particular, this can be seen through the continued emphasis on constructing and maintaining public memorial sites in the north-eastern region of Finnmark, which was liberated from German occupation in 1944 by the Soviet Red Army. Commentators suggest that this is part of a broader strategy by Russia to cultivate a sense of gratitude and obligation from the Norwegian side. This approach may also seek to divert attention from negative publicity and reinforce a positive image of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall effects sought by Moscow in its information operations are likely two-fold. On the one hand, it aims to construct a narrative through official statements or Russian and Norwegian media that Oslo is ignoring Russia’s interests and misleading its population by offering its territory to NATO as a springboard from which to threaten Russia’s security interests. On the other hand, this feeds into a domestic narrative in Russia, where Norway and NATO are portrayed as aggressive and encroaching on Russian sovereignty. Taken together, Russia’s signalling could be considered an active information campaign and is likely aimed at undermining public trust in the Norwegian government and influencing government decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to NSM, cyber attacks causing serious consequences tripled from 2019 to 2021. Although most were of criminal character, some also targeted Norwegian national security interests. These attacks target academic or government institutions and companies possessing advanced manufacturing technologies. NSM claims that the attacks aim to gain insight into government policymaking and to access otherwise inaccessible technology. The majority of such attacks remain either unattributable or are otherwise ambiguous. This is further complicated by the fact that several attacks are attributed to third-party actors, thereby creating sufficient ambiguity to remain plausibly deniable by their suspected sponsor. It is also likely that some state or state-sponsored cyber attacks have remained undiscovered due to the increasingly sophisticated means and ways of such activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in late 2014, an advanced network of false GSM transceiver stations was discovered in the vicinity of the parliament and government administration buildings in Oslo and is assumed to have been monitoring government officials. The system’s sophistication indicated that foreign state actors were involved, but the incident was not publicly attributed. In 2020, the Norwegian parliament’s email system came under attack from what the PST and NSM attributed to the “Fancy Bear” (APT-28) cyber espionage group affiliated with GRU. In a historic move, the Norwegian MFA publicly attributed the incident to Russia, calling it an unacceptable attack on Norway’s democratic interests. In 2022, the University of Tromsø was subjected to a cyber attack in which the attackers targeted the email accounts of security policy researchers; a PST investigation later attributed the attack to Russia. Later the same year, a “Brazilian” researcher was arrested at Tromsø university and charged with espionage. According to the PST, the researcher’s real identity was that of a Russian national. Open-source investigator Christo Grozev at Bellingcat, however, claims that the person is a GRU colonel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor of note is Russia’s covert or overt attempts to gain access to advanced technology. While covert attempts are in the realm of industrial espionage, overt efforts involve attempted purchases of products or companies. According to the NIS and PST, there is a particular demand for Norwegian maritime and other advanced technology. This was exemplified by the Russian Trans Mash Holding’s attempt to buy the Rolls Royce Group subsidiary Bergen Engines in 2021. The Norwegian government prohibited the sale based on concerns that the company had strong ties to Russian authorities. It is believed that the acquisition of Bergen Engines, which specialises in manufacturing large ship engines for customers such as the Norwegian and US navies, would once again enable the construction of larger Russian naval vessels after losing access to such engines following its 2014 invasion of Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Russian activity in the information and cyber domains appears to be part of a comprehensive approach, which includes disinformation and espionage, aimed at influencing government decision-making, undermining democratic processes, and acquiring otherwise inaccessible information and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;military-combining-old-concepts-with-new-approaches&quot;&gt;Military: Combining Old Concepts with New Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Moscow’s stated ambition of keeping tensions low in the Arctic, there are several examples of ways in which the Russian military is being used to signal disagreements with Oslo, especially since the 2014 degradation of political relations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Russia’s deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin, made an unannounced visit to Longyearbyen in Svalbard despite being on Norway’s 2014 sanctions list of persons prohibited from entering the country. Furthermore, Chechen special forces affiliated with the Russian FSB’s Alpha group made a stopover in Longyearbyen in 2016, allegedly on their way to an exercise near the North Pole. Norwegian Svalbard policy clearly states that “all foreign military activity in Svalbard is prohibited and would entail a gross infringement of Norway’s sovereignty”. Such actions are highly problematic and pose severe challenges to the 1920 Svalbard Treaty by exploiting the grey zone in the treaty’s definition of “military activity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a Russian defence report on threats to its national interests identified Norway as a specific threat by what the report described as Norway’s “unilateral revision of international agreements”, likely in reference to the Svalbard Treaty, and its move “towards establishing absolute national jurisdiction over Spitsbergen [Svalbard] and the adjacent 200 nautical mile boundary around it”. Additionally, Russian state-affiliated media outlets openly questioned the legitimacy of Norway’s claim to the archipelago, clearly seeking to inflame a revisionist debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the treaty, Svalbard is not to be used for “war-like purposes”. Therefore, Norwegian military use of Svalbard is limited to essential and non-permanent activities (including Coast Guard visits and military aircraft conducting civil transportation and search-and-rescue operations). Since the mid-2000s, there has also been an annual visit by an RNoN frigate to the archipelago. This routinely draws criticism from Moscow; however, Russia’s 2021 MFA statement was particularly explicit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Oslo’s] next step in […] a series of consistent actions to include this territory in the sphere of national military construction […] which implies the use of the archipelago’s infrastructure in the military planning of Norway’s defence, including the reception of reinforcements from NATO allies. Coupled with the SvalSat satellite ground tracking station operating in the archipelago, technically equipped to perform dual-use tasks, the practice of using the [Longyearbyen] airport by Norwegian military transport aircraft, patrolling the Svalbard waters by Coast Guard ships – all these facts indicate an increase in the tendency of covert militarization of the archipelago by the Norwegian side’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the 2021 RNoN visit to Svalbard was followed by what appears to be a response by the Northern Fleet (NFLT). Although the NFLT has conducted annual “Arctic voyages” for the past decade, the 2021 voyage deviated from previous years when the destroyer Severomorsk and two support vessels set course for the waters around Svalbard. The NFLT stated that the ships were sent to carry out “a set of measures aimed at protecting the interests of the Russian Federation in the Arctic”. According to a Norwegian Joint Headquarters spokesperson, such behaviour had not been seen before. Although the NFLT’s land component has suffered severe losses in Ukraine, its air and maritime component continues to create a considerable regional asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian air force is also being used to relay Moscow’s dissatisfaction with Norwegian policy and has conducted several simulated strikes on Norwegian installations and vessels in recent years. In a 2018 speech, the former Chief of the NIS, Morten Haga Lunde, disclosed that Russia conducted three separate simulated airstrikes on Norwegian facilities and vessels in 2017. According to Lunde, the coercive air campaign began with nine aircraft conducting repeated simulated strikes on the NIS’s GLOBUS II radar in Vardø (Norway’s easternmost point). The incident was likely intended to signal Moscow’s discontent and frustration over the ongoing construction of the US-funded GLOBUS III radar on the site by 2022, suspecting that the radar would be part of a US early warning system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two months later, 12 Russian aircraft simulated a strike on a maritime group consisting of naval vessels from Norway and other NATO member states, while participating in the anti-submarine Exercise EASTLANT in the northern part of the Norwegian Sea. According to Lunde, the Russian force consisted of MiG-31 interceptors, SU-24 multi-role aircraft and Tu-22M long-range strategic bombers. Exercise EASTLANT was also countered by an NFLT naval response, as is customary when NATO forces operate in the northern Norwegian Sea or the Barents Sea. The week after, nine Russian aircraft simulated strikes on the Norwegian Air Force’s air station in Bodø. The simulated attack took place during the Arctic Challenge Exercise, which involved fighter aircraft from several allied countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russian air force activity is routinely intercepted by Norwegian fighter aircraft on NATO Quick Reaction Alert (QRA), the actions described by Lunde were of a character that required a sharp response from the Norwegian authorities, stating that such behaviour is contributing to “a decline in confidence, predictability, and stability in the North”. Nevertheless, in early 2018, 11 Su-24 aircraft repeated their simulated strikes on the GLOBUS II radar (see Figure 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2 Russian PNT Jamming During Trident Juncture 2018.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: The Norwegian Intelligence Service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another emerging trend is the NFLT’s excessive use of maritime danger areas, referred to in Russian as “PRIPs” (also commonly referred to as Notice to Airmen – NOTAMs). As these areas are used for anything from small-arms to submarine launched ballistic missile tests, they effectively become maritime exclusion zones. By the end of 2022, the Russian Western Arctic Sea Port Administration had issued 59 PRIPs, compared with 31 for 2021 and 11 in 2020. Military danger areas are usually intended to ensure the safety of the issuing authority and those who would otherwise have ventured into the given areas. However, there are indications that PRIPs are used both as a political signalling tool and as a military means for peacetime sea denial. As a political tool, PRIPs have been used to signal dissatisfaction with Norwegian and allied activity in the High North, such as during the NATO exercise Trident Juncture in 2018 and other exercises where Russia has announced disruptive PRIPs within the Alliance’s declared exercise areas. Russian PRIPs are also used as a military means in ways that serve its security strategy by creating temporary “geo-fences” to block or canalise military activity away from areas or activities considered to be sensitive to Russia, such as by obstructing access to the Barents Sea or to observe weapons tests. Since 2014, Russia has also announced numerous PRIPs inside Norway’s exclusive economic zone without apparent military necessity. This practice also parallels Russian conduct in the waters and airspace around occupied Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRIPs are also a source of economic loss for those who would otherwise use the sea for civil purposes, such as seasonal fisheries, commerce, air traffic to and from oil and gas platforms, and occasionally to the operation of the platforms themselves. While the practice adheres to international law and conforms to international notification requirements, it demonstrates a lack of regard for economic activities and regularly results in complaints from Norwegian fishery organisations claiming that the practice is violating Norway’s sovereign rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 19 February 2022, Russia activated the most comprehensive PRIPs since the Cold War, in conjunction with executing its delayed Grom (Thunder) strategic nuclear deterrence exercise. The PRIPs effectively closed off much of the ice-free parts of the Barents Sea, including large parts of Norway’s economic zone in the region. The PRIPs and the activity within them likely served several national security strategy ends. The exercise demonstrated the viability of Russia’s strategic nuclear deterrence assets, willingness to protect its national interests in the region by ensuring freedom of action and movement, and demonstrating Russian regional military hegemony. In relation to Norway, the exercise signalled a policy change by launching a nuclear-capable 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missile from inside Norway’s economic zone around Bjørnøya (Bear Island). But, more importantly, the exercise demonstrated resolve and the viability of its nuclear deterrence triad only days before its second invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other maritime incidents, Russian trawlers have been suspected of being involved in damaging vital seabed infrastructure. On 3 April 2021, the Lofoten Vesterålen (LoVe) underwater monitoring cable stopped working. The cable was a joint scientific venture between the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (Havforskningsinstituttet) and the FFI, intended to monitor maritime acoustic activity. Investigations showed that 4.3 km of cable had disappeared from a location 3 km outside of Norwegian territorial waters and was later recovered 11 km from its original position. The subsequent police investigation concluded that several Russian trawlers had been engaged in trawling at the location and time in question, however, the case was later dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another cable incident, one of the two communication cables between Svalbard and mainland Norway ceased to operate on 7 January 2022. The police investigation found that several of the same trawlers as in the previous incident were present in the area, but again, the case was dropped. Space Norway owns and operates the cable which serves as the primary communication line for the population on Svalbard and the Norwegian mainland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although neither of the two cable incidents could be attributed to Russian state involvement, they show the vulnerability of seabed infrastructure, even to relatively simple interference. According to a 2018 study by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Russia has the world’s most developed force for seabed warfare, organised around its Main Directorate for Deep-Sea Research, capable of a wide array of missions, including tapping or severing undersea cables. According to the study, the Directorate interfered with the 2015 completion of the SweLit undersea power cable in the Baltic Sea, proving its capability and willingness to influence undersea infrastructure. Considering Norway’s extensive reliance on undersea infrastructure, especially in the offshore oil and gas sector, such disruptive warfare may represent a severe challenge to Norwegian and European interests, as seen in the 2022 Nord Stream incident where unidentified actors sabotaged the pipelines, rendering them inoperable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Russia routinely disrupts Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers in northern Norway as a means of political and military signalling. Such actions occur regularly and represent a severe problem by degrading the accuracy of the country’s position, navigation and time (PNT) dependent sectors. Conducting electronic warfare (EW) in peacetime may have catastrophic effects on PNT-dependent platforms, such as aircraft or ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GNSS disruptions initially occurred most frequently from 2017 through the 2018 NATO exercise Trident Juncture and well into 2019. Despite voicing formal complaints to Russian authorities, the EW activity continued and compelled the Norwegian Department of Transportation to gather “undisputable evidence”, which concluded that the signal emitters were located on the Kola peninsula. Despite objections from the Norwegian MFA, Russia did not end the disruptive and coercive behaviour. Russia only ceased its GNSS disruption operations six months later, following further bilateral talks in June 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the incident report on the 2017–2019 GNSS disruptions, the Norwegian Justice Department concluded that the loss of GNSS signals would affect the overall ability to effectively manage civil crisis response preparedness in northern Norway. From a military perspective, such low-cost EW can also degrade the effectiveness of high-tech precision-guided munitions (PGM) depending on GPS signals, reducing the overall deterrence effect of the Norwegian or NATO PGM inventory. The incidents also show the impact and cost such strategic signalling has across several sectors of Norwegian society, as it demanded a coordinated response from the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 2022–2023, the EW activity resumed, increasing five-fold compared with 2017–2020, again causing problems for air traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia-a-challenge-to-norwegian-interests-and-options&quot;&gt;Russia: A Challenge to Norwegian Interests and Options?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, when considering Russia’s coercive campaign in the diplomatic, information and military domains in the timeframe 2014–2023, it is clear that Moscow’s security policy objectives are related to the Svalbard archipelago, US and NATO forces operating on or out of the Norwegian mainland, and opposition to the 2014 and 2022 sanctions policy. It is also clear that Russia seeks to gain access to otherwise inaccessible security policy related information and advanced technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described, these objectives are pursued through covert, ambiguous or openly coercive sub-threshold activities, and range from official statements, disinformation campaigns, and espionage, to hacking, cyber attacks and military force demonstrations, with the aim of gaining access to government or corporate information, influencing decision-making, and compelling Oslo to comply with its foreign and security policy objectives. However, these activities have been somewhat irregular in both time and intensity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s sub-threshold activities towards Norway may be viewed from two different perspectives. On the one hand, they could be seen as evidence of a confident Russia seeking to assert its influence and achieve its objectives by any means necessary. On the other hand, the activities may also be considered as acts of desperation, resulting from a failure to achieve its goals through cooperative and peaceful means. Regardless of the perspective taken, it is clear that Russia’s efforts have succeeded in degrading the relationship between the two nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not Moscow has achieved any of its desired outcomes, its increased risk acceptance and violations of the international rules-based order have created the impression that the Russian bear is wounded, which makes it more dangerous and unpredictable than ever before. ◼&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;官提醒小心用字 何桂藍指已非常小心：我答錯一隻字都可以坐十幾年&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;何桂藍指戴耀廷草擬條款無要求否決財案為「天才」：寫咗一句根本乜都冇講過嘅嘢出嚟&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e6PFt3c.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第88天。何桂藍繼續作供，續被問及對財政預算案的立場。何形容，預算案除基本工程儲備基金外，現時還有國安撥款，帳目有很多「唔清唔楚」的地方；並表明若她是立法會議員，會用盡每個質詢和提修正案的機會審核預算案，即使她滿意預算案所有項目，若審核程序有不公義之處，「我都必須要否決佢」。何強調向選民負責並非議員唯一責任，「選民利益之上仲有公眾利益」，而其預設立場是反對預算案「直到行政機關可以說服到我為止」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何亦提及，認為民主派即使立會過半仍是「在野」，法官李運騰追問時採用「opposition」一說，惟何認為不準確。李運騰着她小心用字，不要用「big words」後再更正，惟何否認，指「我係每一隻字都非常小心，因為我好清楚呢條罪係可以判終身，我答錯一隻字都可以坐十幾年」，又指是翻譯和法官採用不同說法才要澄清，望法庭勿認定她「為拗而拗」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱選民利益上還有公眾利益-若財案審核有不公義必須否決&quot;&gt;何稱選民利益上還有公眾利益 若財案審核有不公義必須否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍昨形容，財政預算案內不准議員討論的「基本工程儲備基金」是「公共財政黑洞」，並指作為議員若看到無法審核的東西，投反對票才是履行議員憲制責任。大律師 Trevor Beel 今總結，何昨指無法審核預算案和履行議員職責，是反對預算案的因素，何答「我會形容係底線」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，而何不需審視預算案的實數，只要看到有「基本工程儲備基金」就會反對？何重申這是其底線，但預算案審核機制是由3月到5月，「由書面嘅質詢，到口頭質詢，再到全體委員會階段提CSA（修正案）……假設我係一個立法會議員，我當然唔會話有『基本工程儲備基金』嘅存在，我就唔需要睇個財政預算案嘅內容啦。我一定會用盡每一個質詢嘅機會，每一個提修正案嘅機會，將嗰份財政預算案裡面所有魔鬼藏細節嘅地方⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟李運騰打斷，問何是假設會有魔鬼藏細節？何說「呢個 assume 嘅問法就係假設呢個世界有一份完美嘅財政預算案」。李再重覆問題，何說「可唔可以一陣間先處理呢個問題，我答咗 Johnny Chan Justice（陳仲衡法官）條問題先」，李運騰笑着望住何說：「不，我想先審視你的假設。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，不談香港，每個立法會議員都一定有自己認知的局限，如功能組別議員只看界別利益。何指「呢個世界冇完美嘅財政預算案」，但的確在其認知或選民利益上，「我可能係會見到一份預算案我係唔覺得有問題嘅」；但何強調，「向選民負責唔係立法會議員唯一嘅責任，喺選民利益之上仲有公眾利益」，而她一個人無法確保一定會看出預算案內所有問題，「所以我一定要確保個審核機制係所有議員都能夠盡責審議」。何總結，「即使我本人睇唔出份財政預算案有啲乜嘢需要修改，但係如果我知道呢份財案成個審核程序入面係有唔公義嘅地方，我都必須要否決佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱國安撥款不經立會帳目不清條數唔清唔楚都要投反對票&quot;&gt;何稱國安撥款不經立會、帳目不清：條數唔清唔楚都要投反對票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，就香港的情況，除了「基本工程儲備基金」和「未來基金」，現時還有國安撥款，她不會用「evil」來形容，但當中「肯定有好多帳目唔清唔楚嘅地方」。何強調，「我唔一定需要認為嗰樣嘢係可取或者唔可取，條數唔清唔楚嘅話都應該要投反對票」，又指現時《國安法》交代如何用撥款時無數字和比重，「淨係話我請咗人起咗啲樓，淨係有個項目嘅名稱。」陳仲衡打斷指不認為需聽取關於國安撥款的事，因案發時尚未出現。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何搖頭指不同意，指「當然兩年就洗咗80億係我哋之後先知道嘅」，但她於2020年6月30日晚已得知《國安法》撥款無需經立法會審核，「作為一個選緊立法會嘅人，我當時即刻理解嘅意思就係，無論佢攞幾多錢我都監察唔到。」李運騰問，所以6月30日晚何已決定一旦當選，她便會因有國安撥款的存在而否決預算案？何指認為是關乎昨日有關項目和機制的爭拗（即因項目抑或機制而反對預算案）。李問故何已下了決定？何說「我未講完」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再重覆問題，指只需要一個「yes」或「no」的答案，「想不想答由你。」何指但不審核便違反《基本法》73條的議員職責。李指知道何想履行《基本法》下的議員職責，指她昨天已談及，並板起面孔語氣稍重說：「你不需要重複你說過的話，所以你想不想答我的問題？」何說：「咁咪 abuse（濫用）個 power（權力）囉，如果我唔審核就通過。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱民主派35仍是在野-不同意翻譯為opposition&quot;&gt;何稱民主派35+仍是「在野」 不同意翻譯為「opposition」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡其後問，所以何看到預算案前，說不到她會否反對預算案？何先指，因無論如何「民主派入到立法會都一定係一個在野嘅身分」。惟李運騰打斷，指現時談及民主派35+的情況，何要解釋為何民主派過半後仍然是反對派（in opposition）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何重申如討論譚耀宗訪問時提到，即使民主派立會獲35+亦只有否決權，不能做任何政策倡議。李運騰說一直都是這樣，由「行政機關負責制訂政策」。何說：「啱呀，但人哋啲制度，行政機關嘅首長都係民選㗎嘛。所以我覺得 opposition（反對派）呢個字唔係好準確。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官提醒何小心用字-何稱自己用字非常小心我答錯一隻字都可以坐十幾年&quot;&gt;法官提醒何小心用字 何稱自己用字非常小心：我答錯一隻字都可以坐十幾年&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，何桂藍已非首次用了一個詞語後，發現不準確，並想作出更正，着何想清楚（think carefully），並用一個能準確表達她意思的字眼。何一度說「唔好意思，我必需要澄清」，李續發言時，何再疊聲以英文問李：「May I ask you to listen carefully?」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再說：「不要用 big words 再嘗試更正。」何語帶不滿說：「唔好意思喺繼續作供前必需要講一樣嘢，第一，我唔認為『在野』嘅英文 exactly 就係 opposition，我反對嘅係 opposition 呢個字」，何又指，她昨談及預算案時使用「實數（actual numbers）」一字，而法官用「figures」，她理解兩者意思有不同，後者包括百分比和比重等。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續加重語氣：「我唔係用緊 big words，我係每一隻字都非常小心。因為我好清楚呢條罪係可以判終身，我答錯一隻字都可以坐十幾年。所以如果『機制』唔係『item』佢就唔係『item』，我一定要指出。」李運騰重申，所以他建議何想清楚再用能準確反映她說法的字，以避免任何誤會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何再略帶激動說：「每一隻廣東話嘅字我都講得非常清楚，但係翻譯用一個講法之後法官又用另一個講法，我頭先已經舉咗兩個例子，都係李運騰法官改咗翻譯嘅意思」，何續指：「我唔係好明，我以為法庭係一個用字一定要非常嚴謹嘅地方，如果我認為一條問題裡面有字眼或者假設係 ambiguous 嘅話，我一定要問。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱憂慮法庭有偏見她為拗而拗-官三問講完未&quot;&gt;何稱憂慮法庭有偏見她「為拗而拗」 官三問「講完未」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問她「講完未」（“Have you finished?”），何說「因為我好憂慮而家係一個偏見，如果咁樣都係為拗而拗，我唔係好明呢個指控係咩囉」，李再問她「講完未」，何問「我想知 from now on 我應該點作供好」。李重申就是他所建議的，想清楚再使用避免引起誤會的字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何說：「但係我想知道我係咪要同時肯定翻譯要100%譯到我要講嘅嘢？」李指若她對翻譯有任何問題可提出，何再說：「我就係要指出我唔係每一次都可以分一半嘅腦袋出嚟去咁樣做呢件事，所以我嘅建議係當我選擇澄清嘅時候，我希望法官唔會有一個既定立場我就係為拗而拗。」李再望住她問「講完未」，何微微搖頭擺手。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱不關注結果關注程序-在野議員預設立場是否決直到行政機關說服為止&quot;&gt;何稱不關注結果關注程序 在野議員預設立場是否決、直到行政機關說服為止&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡其後重複問題，問何會否在未看過預算案內容的情況下反對預算案。何表示，「我理解在野嘅議員，佢嘅 default（預設）嘅立場本身就應該係否決，直到行政機關說服到呢啲議員呢條議案係可以投為止。」何指因此若選完後，「基於一啲我而家假設唔到嘅原因，立法會嘅審議機制有所改變，個投票嘅立場當然係會轉」，並解釋她提出機制的問題，正因如只談及項目（item），「個邏輯係好簡單嘅，我爭取到我就投贊成，我爭取唔到我就投反對。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰此時打斷，何說「答埋先啦好冇啊⋯⋯」，李指何之後可繼續，但現在想暫停以免忘記，何說「咁你有得 mark notes 啊嘛，但我冇嘛，我會 forget」。李續指何昨稱即使有五大訴求，但審核機制不改變仍會否決預算案，何指李的問題是相關，因她關注審核機制時並非關注結果，「我係關注個過程是否程序上公正。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱若港人認為審核機制不用改-會尊重決定但仍反對預算案&quot;&gt;何稱若港人認為審核機制不用改 會尊重決定但仍反對預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，五大訴求第五個訴求為雙普選，而她現時只想到在雙普選落實的情況下，港人才可改變議事規則和功能組別點票方法。何並指，如到時經過民主選舉，但香港人仍覺得毋須更改審核機制，她會尊重他們的決定，但仍會投反對票並繼續說服他們要更改，又指「如果喺一個民主制度下，民選嘅議員可以審核到財政預算案，仍然去否決，我覺得係講唔過去嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後總結，故何預設立場是否決，但經過審視（examination）後仍不滿意，就會反對預算案？何指記憶中《基本法》是用「審核（review）」一詞，並認為該審核權力不止「可以傾、可以表達意見、可以問官員」，而是有實質權力要求政府修改，例如「基本工程儲備基金」可設立機制將有問題的項目抽出來，再通過其他數千個無爭議工程，修正案亦不止可以減錢，可改變行政機關施政方向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱即使滿意預算案所有項目-若有不公仍須否決&quot;&gt;何稱即使滿意預算案所有項目 若有不公仍須否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並重申，其立場是看到預算案前，「我本身都係想要投反對票，直到行政機關可以說服到我為止」，但認為 Beel 的說法是假設性：「問題就係現行嘅立法會制度係連 examine（審視）都做唔到，更枉論去審核喇。」何又再次強調，「就算我本人滿意財政預算案嘅所有 items，如果個審核程序係有問題，有不公嘅地方，基於議員對公眾利益嘅責任，我都須要否決」，又指一直到投票一刻前，反對都是其預設立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 澄清他用「examine」一字也是談及審核財案的所有程序，並問何是指若經過所有程序仍不滿意，就會對預算案投反對票？何表示：「我認為嗰啲質詢同埋提修正案嘅機會非常之珍貴，正如頭先所講，一定係需要用嗰啲時間將財政預算案啲問題攞晒出嚟攤喺陽光之下，尤其是坊間通常都只會關注派唔派錢、減唔減租、稅務寬唔寬減，入面好多嘅細節公眾係唔會知道。假設我係議員，每一個質詢嘅機會，每一個提 CSA（修正案）嘅機會，都一定要掌握。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指認為何已非常清楚地說明，亦已得知其證供，Beel 續轉問及下一個議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/znhyAnW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（20日）踏入審訊第88天。何桂藍今繼續作供，談及對戴耀廷所擬協調文件字眼的理解。何表示，戴耀廷「genius」（天才）之處，是在文件寫上「運用《基本法》賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」一句。何指《基本法》賦予立會很多權力，而「包括……」一句只用來形容有什麼權力，理解只要有運用立會權力就足以兌現承諾，不一定要否決預算案，直言戴「寫咗一句根本乜都冇講過嘅嘢出嚟」，故前面使用「積極」或「會」亦不太重要。何又形容該句如「出奇蛋」，因既是避免DQ，亦滿足部分人包括她認為不應迴避提及否決財案的願望。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，協調會議上鄒家成曾提出要用「會」而非「積極」運用字眼，何指她習慣用「積極」這類選舉用語，本無為意有何問題，惟理解鄒作為普通人或抗爭者立場，會直觀覺得「如果要做嘅就講得 firm 啲」，不要用模棱兩可字眼「周遊大家」。何自言聽到鄒發言後「有啲慚愧」，故她終也有「幫口」支持用「會運用」字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍指兩辦譴責郭榮鏗致否決財案討論現風向轉變擔心聲言否決也被dq&quot;&gt;何桂藍指兩辦譴責郭榮鏗致否決財案討論現「風向轉變」、擔心聲言否決也被DQ&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供，談及協調會議的情況。就區諾軒早前稱初選參與者起初不關心否決預算案，直至2020年4月至5月才出現「風向轉變」，改為較關心該議題，何桂藍表示同意有風向改變，但不同意區諾軒的說法。何先指，否決預算案一事在2020年的前數年有爭議，但近年公民黨和民主黨也會投反對票。陳慶偉一度提醒何發言時減慢語速和簡短回答，又提醒法庭傳譯主任，即使何語速快不代表翻譯也要講得快。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，理解對預算案投反對票本身並非爭議性問題，但在4月底，即新東第一和第二次協調會議之間，主持內會主席選舉的時任內會副主席郭榮鏗，被中聯辦和港澳辦譴責，何形容部分參與協調者的態度因此有「極大轉變」。何指，認為郭榮鏗當時「完全依足議事規則」，惟兩辦譴責在民主派眼中，意味「就算你跟足議事規則，佢都會話你癱瘓立法會，有可能會喺在席嘅時候被DQ」，何笑指：「如果條DQ嘅線拉到咁低嘅話，基本上所有做過立法會議員嘅候選人都會被DQ㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SK6AI7u.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 郭榮鏗（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，同時建制媒體亦開始流傳，如果聲言否決財案就可能會被DQ，何認為因此才令原本「冇乜爭議」的否決財案問題，「上升為有一啲候選人好想避免嘅問題。」何續指，當時觀察到越來越多人擔心否決財案會造成DQ，並指「溫和派」一直覺得自己較安全，他們雖理性上知道DQ是任意，但現實上的確看到有站起身舉牌等行動才會被捕、涉主權的發言才會被DQ，「我相信喺郭榮鏗事件之前，冇一個人會諗過聲稱投一張反對票就會被DQ。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱dq無法避免故無需理會至5月宣布立國安法認為一定入唔到閘&quot;&gt;何稱DQ無法避免故無需理會、至5月宣布立《國安法》認為一定「入唔到閘」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指個人而言，認為郭榮鏗「冇問題」，「當時嘅解決辦法係李慧琼（尋求連任的內會主席）退選，就一天都光晒」，但兩辦仍作出譴責，她認為是為確保建制派的主導地位，「然後求其搵啲同議事規則相關嘅藉口去DQ人。」何指「我覺得咁樣嘅DQ係冇辦法避到嘅，無論我點樣修正我嘅行動或者說話」，加上當時兩辦多次發聲明，「連儂牆又話犯法、食黃店又話攬炒」，故其立場是「唔需要理會呢啲嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，何桂藍當時已認為自己會被DQ？何先補充，郭榮鏗事件令大家感受到的威脅不止是選完後，而是會「搵一啲大家過往嘅行為」，「連選都唔畀佢入閘」；而何起初無想過無法入閘，解釋2、3月看到駱惠寧和譚耀宗說法，印象是選到35席後也會DQ，後來4月出現郭榮鏗事件，便認為會出現大規模DQ，令取得35+也很困難。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟何指，認為郭榮鏗事件「對溫和派嘅殺傷力會比較大」，因他們以往在立會已做了很多兩辦譴責的事；對何則影響較細，因她無立法會往績。何並指，她是直至5月底宣布立《國安法》，才認為「我一定會被DQ」，即「入唔到閘」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱第二次會議無印象戴耀廷提及真攬炒十步&quot;&gt;何稱第二次會議無印象戴耀廷提及〈真攬炒十步〉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續問及新東5月5日第二次協調會議的情況。何桂藍指應獲區諾軒通知，會議歷時兩小時，與首次會議一樣有約20至30人出席。至於戴耀廷4月28日發布〈真攬炒十步〉一文，何無印象他在會議有提及或有人問及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，當時特別留意不同黨派派什麼人出席，一來因當時已發生郭榮鏗事件，二來因她知道2018年立會補選初選時，有黨派會派一些不能在黨內做決策的人做代表，這些人會在會上發表意見甚至負責簽名；但到了後期，黨內有決策能力的人又會不承認該些說法，中層又會在公共領域將責任推到他人身上，「將一啲共同決策嘅東西講成係部分人嘅責任。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱第二次會議仍未見各黨派候選人本人無法肯定各黨派想法&quot;&gt;何稱第二次會議仍未見各黨派候選人本人、無法肯定各黨派想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何直言，當時是第二次會議，「我都仍然見唔到啲黨派嘅候選人本人，我係覺得好奇怪嘅」，何續逐一數出：「成個協調過程入面，我冇見過林卓廷、我冇見過楊岳橋、冇見過陳志全亦都冇見過梁國雄，換言之成個過程入面，我只係同一啲我唔 sure 可以代表到佢哋嘅人去傾」，陳志全發笑，鄒家成亦望着身旁的林卓廷發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「我冇印象（社民連）陳寶瑩喺唔喺度」，但「吳文遠喺度，講咗非常多嘅嘢，我知道一定唔係長毛諗法……同埋我超級慶幸嗰日唔係黃浩銘喺度，唔係就開到（凌晨）3點喇個會」，旁聽席大笑。何續指在整個協調過程，「尤其是當我哋知道最後個 agreement，supposed 係啲候選人之間嘅 agreement，但我去到論壇先至第一次見到呢啲 candidates 囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱原以為新東有更多討論-惟終只有兩次會議&quot;&gt;何稱原以為新東有更多討論 惟終只有兩次會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍續指，觀察到「大黨」即民主黨和公民黨的代表，在會上「一句起兩句止，唔會講更多」，但數日後又會在政情專欄看到民主派消息人士「指名道姓」批評協調會內發言人士的說法。何指因此當時對該些黨派代表「喺協調會講過嘅嘢、或者佢哋冇反對或者冇評論嘅嘢、佢哋自己黨入面啲大佬係點樣諗，我完全冇辦法 certain」。法官陳仲衡問她當時有否提出，何指當時是5月頭，理解初選6月中才進入狀態，「我本來以為會有更多討論嘅機會」，故她無提出其顧慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在追問下，指當時認為即使「唔係坐埋一齊」，「都要有一個溝通係大家真係要 agree 啲乜嘢……啲黨派嘅立場究竟係點係需要清楚」，但最終新東只有兩次協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱就會或積極討論不算激烈亦無結論-鄒家成曾和李永成爭拗&quot;&gt;何稱就「會」或「積極」討論不算激烈亦無結論 鄒家成曾和李永成爭拗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍續表示，第二次會議「好幾個 topic 都係冇結論」，包括「會」和「會積極」運用權力的字眼，以及新東出選議席數目是「6」抑或「6+1」；又指即使首次會議似乎有共識的東西，亦有黨派改變主意（second thought），舉例5月28日通過《國安法》草案後，以她所知有黨派曾向戴耀廷指「不如唔好搞論壇」，但無人在首次會議對辦論壇有異議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就第二次會議中段討論「會」和「會積極」，何指鄒家成提出「唔可以用積極，要用會」，但討論「唔算係激烈」，「純粹係多咗人講嘢，因為其他 topic 就好少人講嘢」，又指「譬如PW2（趙家賢）好似話有人拍枱嗰啲，但我記得成程係冇人企過起身，完全冇呢啲激烈嘅行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，當時很多人表達立場，但只講了一或兩次，其後就「好似失去咗興趣咁」，最後是鄒家成和李永成「兩個人喺度拗咗10至15分鐘」，鄒一邊低頭抄寫一邊露齒笑。何笑說：「但係李永成唔係選㗎，我都唔知佢嚟做咩」，並憶述爭議的完結，就是「好 abrupt（突然）咁話：我哋冇乜時間喇，不如討論吓『6』定『6+1』先啦」，鄒家成聞言點頭。李運騰問，即會上就採用「會」或「會積極」無結論？何說：「啲人表達完佢哋嘅立場，跟住就唔講嘢囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「因為佢（李永成）同 Owen（鄒家成）真係拗咗勁耐，所以我對李永成比較有印象」，而她記得李自介為地區人士，但不記得是哪區。何又指李「有講佢係嚟睇吓」，林卓廷等發笑，何並指「所以我先咁奇怪點解佢要同 Owen 拗咁耐，佢都唔係選」。李運騰亦引述早前證供，趙家賢曾指李是民主黨代表，但辯方其後指出李當時已退黨。翻查資料，李當時任沙田區議員。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱積極為選舉用語畀人彈出彈入-坊間覺得會但實無作承諾&quot;&gt;何稱「積極」為選舉用語「畀人彈出彈入」 坊間覺得「會」但實無作承諾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問及何對於「會」和「會積極」有何分別的看法，何手指被告欄：「我一路坐喺度聽，我想答呢個問題好耐。」何續指，「『積極』係一個選舉嘅 jargon（術語）」，只有「跟開選舉」的人才知道，解釋因選舉開支是由宣布參選一刻開始計算，故大家「一定係壓到提名期最後一日先報名參選」；而這些人早幾個月開始宣傳時，無論他們自稱抑或新聞報導，均會形容為「積極考慮參選」，「積極」簡單而言「就係一個畀人彈出彈入嘅字眼」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，但因這麼多年也是這樣用，「坊間就會覺得你講得自己『積極』呢，你基本上就『會』選喇。」何並指她沒問過戴耀廷，但覺得用「積極」字眼的效果，就是坊間就會覺得「啊，就係㗎喇」，「但事實你乜都冇應承嘅。」何同意，即公眾會將「會積極運用」理解成「會運用」，但指過往的確亦有很多積極考慮參選的人最後無參選，因他們「試水溫」後發現效果不好。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱戴寫議員會用基本法權力是乜都冇講過-用積極或會亦不重要&quot;&gt;何稱戴寫「議員會用《基本法》權力」是「乜都冇講過」 用「積極」或「會」亦不重要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，根據證供，戴耀廷以「積極」一詞來迎合想和不想運用否決權的人。庭上早前證供亦指，戴於各區協調文件加入「會運用／會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」字句。何回應，「我覺得戴耀廷喺呢件事上，佢 genius（天才）嘅地方唔係喺呢兩個字（積極），而係跟住嗰兩句」，即「運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何形容，「包括否決財政預算案」是一個「從句」（subordinate clause），並指眾所周知《基本法》賦予立法會很多權力，她不是說認同戴的做法，但理解戴草擬時，正因「包括……」一句只是用來形容有什麼權力，因此「只要你運用過立法會嘅權力，你就達成呢個承諾嘅要求，但係個權力又唔一定要係（否決）財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指簡單而言，「佢寫咗一句根本乜都冇講過嘅嘢出嚟」，庭上傳出笑聲，何並指因為「議員會運用《基本法》賦予議員嘅權力」是一個「tautology（同義反覆、贅述）」，因此「有呢句之後，其實我覺得前面跟『積極』或者『會』根本唔太重要」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱戴耀廷寫法如出奇蛋-避dq亦滿足不欲迴避否決財案者願望&quot;&gt;何稱戴耀廷寫法如「出奇蛋」 「避DQ」亦滿足不欲迴避否決財案者願望&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續解釋，「我理解戴耀廷嘅動機係要避DQ」，並指「因為如果你咁樣寫，『我一定會用《基本法》賦予嘅權力畀我去做嘢』，咁我咪冇違反《基本法》囉」。陳慶偉問，若戴耀廷真的那麼聰明，為何又要提否決預算案，何回應因否決預算案是當時《文匯》和《大公報》「好 specifc 提到嘅DQ理由」，但「有好多人包括在下，係覺得唔應該咁樣避過嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，而戴耀廷「就用一句嘢包晒所有人嘅嘢，出奇蛋咁囉，滿足晒所有人嘅願望」，多人發笑。何又指無法記得很清楚，但戴當時應有表達過「咁樣寫法應該好難DQ得到嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱聽到鄒家成發言後感慚愧-遂支持用會運用字眼&quot;&gt;何稱聽到鄒家成發言後感慚愧 遂支持用「會運用」字眼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就鄒家成提出「唔可以用積極，要用會」，何續指鄒發言前，她無特別立場，但鄒提出後「我就有一個好大嘅感受」：「當時我雖然自己係一個素人，但因為做咗選舉新聞咁多年，我都好習慣用呢啲 jargon 嘅野，所以我完全唔為意呢個講法有咩問題，我覺得用『會』同埋用『積極』冇乜分別、冇乜所謂。但係鄒家成佢，我理解係嚟自一個普通人或者一個抗爭者嘅立場，我理解佢會好直觀咁覺得，如果要做嘅就講得 firm 啲，唔好用一啲 ambiguous（模棱兩可）嘅東西去周遊大家。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/krPlsGI.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，相信代表鄒家成的大律師陳世傑會就此盤問，陳世傑在座位笑言：「I will.」李指他較關注何的回應，何說「總之聽完鄒家成講嘢之後，我係有啲慚愧嘅」，鄒家成睛睜微微睜大，身體挨後微笑。何續說，「所以我係有幫口嘅，我都係有講用『會』嘅」，同意她當時支持鄒家成。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。散庭時，鄒家成對何桂藍飛吻一下。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the refresh of the UK’s Integrated Review in March 2023, Defence has released its (delayed) response. The 97-page document was trailed by one minister at RUSI’s Land Warfare Conference as intending to be dull, and for those put off by its length or lack of detail on the force structure, it may exceed his expectations. However, this would unfairly characterise the situation facing the drafters once the excitement of the commitment to 3% of GDP allocated to Defence under Liz Truss’s premiership was replaced by her successor’s looser commitment to 2.5% “as fiscal and economic circumstances allow”. Without new money beyond that of the Spring Budget, with the old money already under stress from rising costs, and with no time in the political cycle for substantive change, bold statements of new capability would have been meaningless, or worse. Understandably, therefore, the Command Paper Refresh focuses on areas that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and armed forces can act on quickly and, at this stage of planning at least, relatively cheaply. What this leaves, however, is a Command Paper that is more of a message about how Defence needs to get ready for the next Defence Review, probably taking place in 2025, when it will align with a comprehensive spending review. Important decisions about force structure, therefore, have been put off until then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Refresh of the Integrated Review, whose priorities were memorably described by Paul Cornish as being “everything, everywhere, all at once”, the Command Paper Refresh explicitly prioritises a “Global Response Force” configured for warfighting in the Euro-Atlantic area, but able to be used elsewhere, including in the Indo-Pacific and Africa. This accords with the Integrated Review Refresh’s view of the Indo-Pacific as more about diplomatic, information and economic levers of power, while the military should focus on Europe, for now. The Command Paper Refresh also promises a fresh honesty about the UK’s ability to meet its NATO commitments, although that honesty is likely to be reserved for classified documents. Given the lack of mass in both the Army and RAF in particular, the shortfalls in the UK’s NATO contribution within the Euro-Atlantic area can be guessed. But acknowledging the gaps is not enough; they need to be filled, something largely deferred for 2025’s Review. The same is true of a plan for the Reserves to provide the second or even third echelon forces for enhanced resilience, both in support of the regular force and in the UK. And in the latter case, this will require a broad approach involving all of government, industry and civil society, because – as Ukraine shows – domestic resilience is a national endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headmark force – the Global Defence Force – delivers the integrated force defined in the Integrated Operating Concept 2025, but appears to be rebranding, albeit within a new governance framework – the Global Operate Programme – rather than being a force with capabilities different to that described in the 2021 Defence Command Paper. There are no big new investment commitments, and nowhere in the document can someone wanting to explore the implications for a single Service find clarity about what that Service is building towards. Readers will have to read the 69 pages of the 2021 Defence Command Paper alongside the (longer) “Refresh” to get a clear picture of the planned force structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As with the earlier Command Paper, the Refresh is stronger at describing the issues and introducing new concepts than detailing how implementation will actually occur&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In endorsing the original Command Paper’s force structure, the Refresh inherits its flaws: a focus on modernisation and an over-reliance on technology at the expense of conventional mass, on the assumption that once modernised, there will be enough time to regrow the force. That assumption appears questionable given the war in Ukraine, so continuing a strictly sequential path of modernisation and then mass seems similarly flawed. Hence, if from an official’s perspective the refreshed Command Paper is a valiant attempt to make the best of the circumstances, it fails the test of being a credible plan for the armed forces the UK actually needs. If the threat is accelerating, Defence needs new spending, not just on stockpiles and the nuclear capability announced in the Spring Budget, but on conventional mass to avoid increasing the capability gap between the conventional and nuclear rungs on the escalation ladder. If the gap gets too big, it will leave those contemplating integrated deterrence and defence unable to bridge the two, to the detriment of both conventional and nuclear capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Paper’s four main themes for securing strategic advantage are matters over which it has some control – people, science and technology, industry and productivity – and make sense in the context of getting fit for the 2025 Review. And, as with the earlier Command Paper, the Refresh is stronger at describing the issues and introducing new concepts (Global Operate Programme, zig-zag careers, new partnerships with industry) than detailing how implementation will actually occur. On People, it accepts the Haythornthwaite Review in full, including the need for greater agility in career paths – although the path to implementation remains opaque. And in one of its few explicit commitments, the Refresh states that Defence will spend £400 million over two years on improving accommodation. The situation for the civil service is less positive, with a recruitment ban imposed separately – partly to help Defence afford the 2023 pay rise for military personnel, the money for which will come from the existing Defence budget and will have to be found from elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On science and technology, the Refresh doubles down on earlier commitments underpinned by a continued belief that technology – including semiconductors, AI, quantum and telecommunications – will provide the answers. It reiterates the 2021 Command Paper’s ambition to embrace a culture of innovation and experimentation, with Defence taking more risk on rapid initial entry into service and subsequent spiral development of capabilities through a technology-centric (rather than platform-centric) approach. This requires closer partnership with industry, hence the value of focusing on the relationship with industry to allow this to happen: Ukraine has shown the importance of the industrial base, and the current industrial base is one that Defence has created, so can recreate with the right incentives and behaviours. Acquisition reform – inevitably perhaps – is referenced, as is the need to engage industry in requirement-setting, but a cynic might have hoped for more by way of implementation given that the Defence and Security Industrial Strategy was released two years ago. So, while this is not new, the desire to act on it is restated and has been brought into sharper focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The realistic purpose of this refresh is to get Defence fit for the next Command Paper and focus activity in the short term, but it is not a response to the defence challenges the UK faces&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the paper majors on productivity through a “campaigning approach” that will extract greatest value from the Global Response Force. While understandable, and in many respects sensible where the aim is to make the forces more deployable, there are big tensions. Firstly, all organisations find transformation difficult, but this is exacerbated where capacity is consumed in other activity; in some respects, being less productive in the short term could be a quicker path to modernisation. This is not to argue that greater productivity is not needed, but the Paper lacks the detail to know how the balance between productivity and change will play out across the different elements of Defence. Secondly, there is the challenge of resources. Productivity is demanding in terms of running costs through increased consumables, allowances and so on, all of which have already been affected by high rates of inflation. This adds to the pre-existing affordability challenge, where most additional funding has gone into capital costs (CDEL) at the expense of resource ones (RDEL). When the pay settlement and extra costs for improving accommodation are added, RDEL will be under even greater pressure. The other resource challenge is that of the people needed to do the work to make more use of the force. The civilian recruitment ban and potential reductions of up to 3,000 civil servants would represent 5% of the Defence civil service workforce and are to be achieved through natural wastage; it is not targeted. Consequently, gaps could appear in critical areas needed to enable the enhanced productivity the Department is seeking. Finally, the Refresh makes clear that the Levene Model will be reviewed to make sure the governance systems will be in place to manage the Department, but realistically, this will have to inform the next major Defence Review rather than shaping the response to this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the authors have done well to find something meaningful to say – and perhaps more importantly, not to say things that were impossible – so this is an admirable attempt by the Department to satisfy the demand for a refresh to the Command Paper and get organisationally ready for the future. However, if it is worthy as a departmental paper, the constraints of time and money ultimately undermine its value as a national defence response to a more contested and volatile world. The priorities, while basically sound, arguably did not need a command paper at all – internal management of Defence is normally something that the taxpayer might expect Defence to do routinely, but having been announced, the bureaucratic process would have moved inexorably to deliver it, irrespective of the practical necessity for doing so. And even if the MoD can produce a new Defence Strategy and refresh its existing (internal) Defence Plan quickly – that is, before April 2024 – there is not enough time for a meaningful change of direction for the Defence supertanker, which turns slowly. The realistic purpose of this refresh of the Command Paper, therefore, is to get the organisation fit for the next one and focus activity in the short term, but it is not a response to the defence challenges the UK faces. It does, however, fire the starting gun for the next major defence and security review, in which Defence must hope that more time and money will allow it to build the forces the UK needs to deliver against a clear policy headmark of a force optimised for warfighting in the Euro-Atlantic area. We must hope that this expectation does not leave the armed forces waiting for Godot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（19日）踏入審訊第87天。何桂藍今繼續作供，就戴耀廷形容民主派立會過半為「大殺傷力憲制武器」，何指「憲制武器」概念常見，外國如彈劾和不信任票等可用作權力制衡，而在「幾百萬人反對中央」是對中央很大殺傷力前提下，她同意35+是「大殺傷力憲制武器」，亦可能引發憲政危機，但認為不必然負面，視乎當權者反應。何發言時多次被法官打斷，指對理論不感興趣，着她直接回答問題，法官形容辯方大律師就如醫生替何做手術，但何卻在手術台扭來扭去，何同意此比喻並說：「既然我係病人，即係而家係我條命 at stake（攸關）啦係咪呀！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何同意自視為「抗爭派」，指該派系因2020年立選而生，特點包括承認立會無法落實政策倡議，不會向選民表明可達成五大訴求；行動時不會以保住議席為首要考慮，「我哋認為嗰樣嘢係唔合理嘅話，即使DQ都要做。」何又指，認為戴耀廷「攬炒十步」文章與初選無關，指戴於初選僅為協調者，對入議會後行為「冇say」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍同意民主派取35為憲制武器可引發憲政危機-惟不必然負面&quot;&gt;何桂藍同意民主派取35+為憲制武器可引發憲政危機 惟不必然負面&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍今繼續作供。大律師 Trevor Beel 問何桂藍，是否認同戴耀廷稱民主派立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」。何指，很多政治和憲法相關著述經常看到「憲制武器」的說法，而權力之間本身有制衡關係，但若行政、立法或司法機關權力無法互相阻止或改變，便稱不上制衡。何並指按其他國家文獻，彈劾、不信任票或否決預算案均會稱為「憲制武器」，她理解有可能引發憲政危機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並強調，「危機（crisis）」字典意思是「turning point for better or worse」，即不必然是負面，就如中文所言，「危同機都係雌雄同體㗎啫」，如現有的範式（paradigm）無法容納一些新現象，就可以形容為出現危機。何續指，在香港情況而言，「民主派攞到35+係一個從來都冇人見過亦都冇處理過嘅情況」，直言「佢的確係一個憲制武器，但係佢會引發啲乜嘢，會引發危定係機，就睇當權者嘅反應」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱特首為北京欽點-若人民支持立會便現吊詭情況北京意志有幾百萬人唔同意&quot;&gt;何稱特首為北京欽點 若人民支持立會便現吊詭情況：北京意志有幾百萬人唔同意&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，在香港假如行政長官就像立法機關一樣是民選，「當呢兩個 body 發生矛盾就係香港人內部嘅矛盾，咁我哋咪自己喺香港拆掂佢囉係咪」，但何指，「行政長官喺香港並不是民選嘅，甚至可以話係北京欽點嘅，咁當人民係支持立法會嘅時候就會出現咗一個好吊詭嘅情況，簡單嚟講就係行政長官代表咗北京嘅意志，喺香港係有幾百萬人唔同意嘅，咪因為咁先至造成憲政危機，所以《基本法》點解可以有50至52條（否決預算案後解散立法會的程序）⋯⋯」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰打斷，指若 Beel 無法獲得想要的答案可以問下一題，Beel 亦指何可以先回答問題，再作出解釋。李運騰續指，坦白說法庭對任何看法沒有興趣，只對被告的心態有興趣，其他所有都是與案無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官以醫生施手術為喻着何配合律師-何既然我係病人而家係我條命-at-stake&quot;&gt;官以醫生施手術為喻着何配合律師 何：既然我係病人，而家係我條命 at stake&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，何是否同意「大殺傷力憲制武器」一說，何說「因為而家明顯我對大殺傷力嘅定義同法官對大殺傷力嘅定義係唔同嘅」。李運騰即嚴肅表示，法庭沒有對大殺傷力的意思表達任何看法，何再說：「咁只能夠話我喺知道法庭乜嘢意思之前，我唔可以輕言答我同意或者不同意」。李再說，問題是來自其律師，不是法庭，「你聽你律師的問題，可以回答就說，不可以回答就說，法庭對任何理論都沒有興趣，而且也不會給予考慮。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續表示，因法官陳慶偉之前提及「大殺傷力」時是提及伊拉克戰爭。李指何無需再解釋，並請她回答律師問題，指「他是來幫助你的」。陳仲衡亦向何說，「Mr. Beel 正在做一個很重要又困難的工作，請不要令他的工作更加困難」，又指 Beel 就如一個醫生正為作為病人的何在手術台進行重要的手術，但何只是「在手術台上扭來扭去」（“… what you are doing is like wriggling on the operation table.”）。何說：「我同意呢個比喻，既然我係病人，即係而家係我條命 at stake（攸關）啦係咪呀。」李運騰說「那請相信你的醫生，否則就想想其他的選項」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指真攬炒十步與初選無關-戴耀廷僅協調者對入議會後行為冇say&quot;&gt;何指〈真攬炒十步〉與初選無關 戴耀廷僅協調者對入議會後行為「冇say」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 最後再次問，何是否同意戴「大殺傷力憲制武器」的說法，何先說他不知戴耀廷說這句話時是什麼意思，並說「因為我覺得幾百萬人反對中央呢樣嘢，對中央係好大殺傷力，喺呢個前提之下，我同意民主派35+係大殺傷力憲制武器，但其他咩打仗呀嗰啲我就唔同意喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，認為戴〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉一文與初選沒有關係，「因為戴耀廷佢喺成個初選入面，我會形容佢係一個 facilitator（協調者），即係佢對於啲議員選完之後可以喺立法會入面做咩，佢係冇 say 嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何解釋抗爭派特點不會承諾可達五大訴求行動不會以保議席為首要考慮&quot;&gt;何解釋「抗爭派」特點：不會承諾可達五大訴求、行動不會以保議席為首要考慮&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續就「抗爭派」發問。何桂藍表示，約於2020年6月自視為「抗爭派」，但沒有一個很清晰的時間點，並指抗爭派至少5月後才出現。Beel 問她為何會自視為抗爭派，何未有正面回應，先稱「抗爭派」與「本土派」或「泛民主派」的性質有點不同，並指每次選舉都有一些因應情況而出現（contingent）的派系，如2017年有「原則派」。惟法官陳慶偉打斷，指法庭無興趣知道派系的分別，這亦非 Beel 問他的問題；李運騰亦說他們不想知道任何關於2017年的事，指律師是問她2020年5、6月時的心態。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，認為抗爭派是一個因應2020年立法會選舉而生的派系，「佢會唔會延續超過2020年立法會選舉我哋係唔知嘅」，至於抗爭派為何會於2020年選舉出現，何稱認為有數個重點，第一「我認為抗爭派嘅人係要承認，2020年香港嘅立法會，係冇辦法做到落實政策倡議呢一個功能，簡單嚟講，我認為抗爭派嘅人係唔會同選民講，你選我入去我可以幫你達成乜嘢，或者你達成某一個數目嘅議席就可以達成五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;第二，何認為抗爭派「考慮自己做咩行動嘅時候，係唔會以被DQ或者保住議席為自己首要嘅考慮，簡單嚟講就係無論政府話你會做啲乜嘢會被DQ，而我哋認為嗰樣野係唔合理嘅話，即使DQ都要做」。第三，何認為，抗爭派入議會後「唔可以只專注於大嘅議案或者政治議題，每一條法例，每一條草案，都要用盡基本法賦予嘅職能，去盡責去審議」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱抗爭派會盡責審議每個議案談判與否並非抗爭派特徵&quot;&gt;何稱抗爭派會盡責審議每個議案、談判與否並非抗爭派特徵&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運即問，這點有何特別，不是每個議員都應這樣做嗎？何指有人或會就政改、財政預算案或很受公眾關注的項目才認真審議，但其他較細或非自己區的項目「就輕輕放過」。惟何認為議員責任除了「幫市民去爭取一啲嘢之外，佢本身都要監察行政機關權力嘅運用」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何最後並指，「抗爭派同其他派系嘅分別，唔係話肯同政府傾或者唔肯同政府傾。」陳仲衡指，法官仍在等待何回答為何她會自視為抗爭派，而不是要她代表抗爭派發言。何回應因她認同以上數點，故自視為抗爭派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰追問最後一點，何稱因其他被告曾談及他們對談判的理解，但她不同意。李運騰指即可能會有談判？何稱談判有很多形式和層次，抗爭派內有人可能覺得要諮詢。李追問何是說談判與否並非抗爭派的特徵？何說「可以咁理解」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問誰是支持者-何稱曾被指激進派攻擊-但有獲中產及本土派選區支持&quot;&gt;被問誰是支持者 何稱曾被指激進派攻擊 但有獲中產及本土派選區支持&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，有被告曾形容參與初選投票的是最黃或激進的人，何同意嗎？何說「我唔會用『黃』呢隻字，因為可能好多人覺得，『黃』就係好激進」，李運騰指可以有不同的程度（shade），正如藍也可有不同程度。何續指，「一個住深水埗，由港同盟投到民協投咗40年嘅人，你都可以話係好黃，而佢可能係完全反對暴力」，民協何啟明發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，何會同意投票予她的人是年輕、黃和激進的人嗎？何指「我嘅理解係完全相反」，並解釋「首先因為呢單案基本上拉晒民主派所有光譜嘅人，每一個被告都活喺唔同嘅 echo chamber（同溫層）入面」，而就她所見，「2019嘅激進派係好唔鍾意初選嘅」。陳慶偉微笑說：「Ms Ho，我正失去耐性，我們對理論不感興趣」，重申問題是何認為誰是其支持者。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「我當時喺連登，我係畀人話係『OMDB 2.0』」，多人發笑。陳仲衡說「請教育我們（“Please educate us.”）」，何續說「OMDB」是指「Over my dead body，即係楊岳橋」，故相信當時至少在輿論上，別人認為她與楊岳橋相似，而她亦是激進派的其中一個攻擊對象，因也有人稱她為「小麗老母2.0」，即2016年參選九西的劉小麗。被告席再傳來笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱只能旁敲側擊誰是支持者-惟理解亦希望是認同其方向授權予她&quot;&gt;何稱只能旁敲側擊誰是支持者 惟理解亦希望是認同其方向授權予她&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，但網上有不同看法，何不能得出結論誰是她的支持者。何指選舉前除了觀察輿情是無法確定，但她記得初選後的分站數據，的確是第一城和馬鞍山等中產選民得票較多。李問，故何的支持者大部分不是激進派？何指雖然她在連登上被本土派「鬧得咁勁」，但她在一般認為是「本土派票倉」的將軍澳「票數係唔差」，直言票站數據亦非精準科學，「我冇辦法講到係邊兩萬六人去投我，只能咁樣旁敲側擊去估。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何最後指：「不如咁樣講，投我嘅人，我理解或者我希望，係佢有睇過我講嘅嘢，佢認同我嘅方向，佢授權畀我去做嗰樣嘢，咁佢就投我，除此以外我不能講更多。」陳慶偉邊聽邊點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（19日）踏入審訊第87天。何桂藍談及參選原因，表示2019年的社會運動很早已演化成一場民主運動，而如要為運動取得民意授權，立會選舉是必需走的路，政府亦需回應選舉結果。何自言，她是「single-issue candidate（單一議題參選人）」，參選是望立會選舉能推進運動，並將運動精神帶入選舉，不希望只靠運動來取得議席。法官問是什麼精神，何稱望有身位演繹「攬炒」，並將運動去中心化、每人要找最適當身位貢獻等精神帶入選舉。何又強調，宣布參選時清楚表明不是記者，不希望混淆兩者身分，又指對她而言2019年運動不是指其年份，「至少喺我身上，場運動仲未完。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何亦表示初選應是目的而非工具，指立會選舉是全香港人的事，就議會路線應如何走、抗爭做到何種程度，均應交由盡量多港人決定，亦是辦初選的原因，故她當時不接受公民投票以外的方案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍稱2019年底開始思考不做記者-翌年初考慮參選立會&quot;&gt;何桂藍稱2019年底開始思考不做記者 翌年初考慮參選立會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供，今早談及對戴耀廷稱立會過半是「大殺傷力憲制武器」及對「抗爭派」等看法。被問何時決定參與立法會選舉，何桂藍指她一開始不打算參選，但約於2019年12月「我就開始諗唔做記者，喺運動入面搵一個崗位去做」。何指她起初打算做被捕支援，但約於2020年1至2月便開始考慮參選立法會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱運動無面孔但獲大眾辨識2019年從無示威參選時表明非記者&quot;&gt;何稱運動無面孔但獲大眾辨識、2019年從無示威參選時表明非記者&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問參選立會的原因，何指2019年運動其中一個精神是「每個人都要搵自己最適合或者最擅長嘅嘢去做」，而當時運動是「無領袖」亦「無面孔（faceless）」，「譬如琴日講七一宣言究竟係邊個寫，到而家都唔知道，當時究竟係啲咩人咁把炮可以做到全球登報我哋都唔知道。」陳慶偉打斷着何可直接回答問題，並問何是否指運動沒有代表或象徵人物？何說：「但係好遺憾，大家辨識到我囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問及何當時的「名氣」，李運騰先問這是否會幫助辯方案情，又指法庭知道何當時是運動的知名人物（prominent figure）是否已足夠。何即指她必須澄清，就李運騰指她是運動的標誌人物（icon），「2019年我係冇示過威，冇做過示威者嘅」，「所以唔好話我係個 movement 嘅任何嘢」、「你就唔好話我係乜乜乜 of the movement」，李運騰指他沒有用「icon」一詞，又指現在已談及2019年後的事，問何會否認為她在2020年3至4月是民主派的重要人物，何表示不同意：「係一個顯著人物，但唔係泛民主派。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何其後主動澄清，「記者還記者，抗爭者還抗爭者，兩者混淆埋一齊係一個好嚴重嘅問題，亦都唔淨係影響到我」，故「當時我要推進呢個運動，我第一件事就係離開記者嘅行業」。何並指，2020年很遲才開設 Facebook 專頁，是因當時要以記者身分出席聯合國海牙的一個活動，且有稿未交；但何強調她宣布參選時「好清楚表明我已經唔係一個記者，希望大家唔好再混淆」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱反修例演化成民主運動-望立會選舉取民意授權推進運動-非靠運動取議席&quot;&gt;何稱反修例演化成民主運動 望立會選舉取民意授權推進運動 非靠運動取議席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問及何參選立會的原因，何解釋因投票成本最低、最多人可以參與，故「如果我哋要為個運動攞個 mandate（民意授權），立法會選舉係必需要行嘅路」。何又指政府必須回應立會選舉結果，雖當刻不知好壞，但2020年3至4月時運動很多其他路線亦開始「停滯不前」。李運騰問是指什麼運動，何指是2019年的運動，重申「反修例運動」一名只是因想不到其他名字才「用住先」，但運動「好早已經演化成一場民主運動」；其後又指她說2019年運動時，「我指嘅係運動，唔係個年份，至少喺我身上，場運動仲未完。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續說，每次立法會選舉，所有媒體和公眾焦點就變成立法會「跑馬仔」、「數議席」，惟何「個人好唔希望見到，件事變咗係議會路線 ride on（靠）2019年嘅運動攞多幾個位⋯⋯我係希望立法會選舉呢件事，可以推進場運動」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍續指，香港民主運動一直有個問題或恐懼，就是因大家將焦點放在立會，運動上就「冇咁多時間同心力去推進」，故「當時好多非常投入運動嘅人，都好唔鍾意初選或者立法會選舉，正正係憂慮佢轉移咗大家嘅注意力——到底而家係講緊議會係運動嘅一部分吖，定係話個運動嘅存在就只係為個議會可以攞多幾席？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續說，運動其中一個緣起就是「立法會解決唔到個問題，所以人民先要行出嚟」，她認為「我哋唔可以放棄立法會呢條線」，但認為立會只是運動一個「甚至我會話唔係一個非常大嘅部分」，故若說將運動「直接由街頭搬咗入 chamber（議事廳）」，「我認為係消解咗運動嘅能量，甚至係馴化咗2019年呢場運動。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱盡責審議於現行制度無法做到&quot;&gt;何稱盡責審議於現行制度無法做到&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍續指，當時理解議員角色是反映民意、監察政府和防止行政機關奪權，並且理論上「盡責去審議每一條交上嚟嘅法案」。李運騰問為何是「理論上」，何稱「因為呢樣嘢喺立法會現行嘅制度內係做唔到嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於區諾軒早前曾稱，認為何桂藍是「較為有左翼思想嘅人」，又指她「經濟上面追求社會公平」。何表示同意她「追求社會公義」，但「我冇足夠知識判斷我係咪一個社會主義者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何自言屬單一議題候選人-空降新東因該區最重視政治辯論&quot;&gt;何自言屬單一議題候選人 空降新東因該區最重視政治辯論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就初選協調，何表示記得2020年1至2月報紙政情版已提及戴耀廷正在辦協調，她亦有出席4月14日的新東首次協調會議。被問她是否認為有義務（obligation）參與協調會議，何稱「我係自己想去嘅，唔係一個 obligation」，指因她「做咗記者咁耐」，一直較關注的香港政治議題就是不同政治派系的紛爭，但做記者時「永遠只係聽人點樣講」，故「我本身好有興趣參與呢個協調嘅過程，去睇吓佢究竟係點」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，當時得知有興趣參與便可找戴耀廷或區諾軒，故找了區諾軒，並指「如果我唔主動講，冇人會知道我想選」。何其後獲告知會議詳情，但區沒向她提及參與便須認同五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問為何參選新東，何表示「好老實講我當時係空降嘅」，並直言認為自己當時難以被放在任何一個2019年前已存在的政治派系，會形容自己為一個「single-issue candidate（單一議題候選人）」，「我就係話要將個運動嘅精神帶入議會㗎啫」，而她會提但不會強調任何地區性議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，歷屆立法會的各個選區中，認為新界東選民最習慣和重視這類政治辯論，舉例她2020年7月出席將軍澳地區論壇時，將軍澳居民的問題無一關於地區，又指自2003年已有長毛梁國雄，惟法官打斷指無需給予例子。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍望將運動精神帶入選舉-包括想有身位演繹攬炒定義&quot;&gt;何桂藍望將運動精神帶入選舉 包括想有身位演繹攬炒定義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，故何說法是將運動精神帶進議會？何修正稱：「唔係帶入 chamber，應該係話帶入呢場立法會選舉，因為好早期嘅時間我就知道我入唔到呢個 chamber。」陳續問何是談及什麼精神，何說「場運動有好多唔同嘅精神」，但「我係想有一個身位去演繹『攬炒』呢件事嘅」，「put forward（提出）一個我嘅攬炒嘅定義」，又解釋當時社會上不同人正爭奪「攬炒」定義，如建制派會說「拉布」就是「政治攬炒」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問及運動有什麼其他精神，何指有「兄弟爬山」、「齊上齊落」、「一息尚存，抗爭到底」，法官追問她還想帶什麼精神入選舉，何指就是運動的「無領袖、去中心化」狀態。陳問何能否在數隻字內解釋完，何稱「唔可能」、要用「幾句」，陳着她簡單概括答案，就如文章的標題，惟何即坐直身子大聲說：「唔好意思我從來都冇做過內容農場，同埋我唔係一個標題黨，我認為將任何嘢 reduce（簡化）成一個標題本身係一個極不道德嘅做法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在法官追問下，稱除演繹攬炒定義和去中心化外，想帶入選舉的還包括「每個人都要搵最適合自己嘅身位去貢獻場運動」；以及當「兄弟爬山」和「齊上齊落／和勇不分」有矛盾「點樣融和（reconcile）呢個矛盾」。何同意，運動由反修例演變為追求民主化、爭取雙普選，Beel 問那解釋了她想將運動的精神帶入選舉？何回應民主化本身可以是目標，但民主運動內部的民主化正是指「去中心化」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱因2018年民主派初選情況-故很關注2020年初選有否需簽名的協議&quot;&gt;何稱因2018年民主派初選情況 故很關注2020年初選有否需簽名的協議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就新東協調情況，何指無印象看過和會上有傳閱「35+計劃」文件，她不曾與戴耀廷直接接觸，唯一聯繫只是互加 Facebook 好友，但無說過話。何並指首次會議前，應從區諾軒得悉會議會決定用民調或公民投票，而她赴會前曾重閱自己2018年撰寫有關民主派立會補選初選的報導作準備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，文章有幾點她警惕自己參與時要注意，首先是「DQ係真係 arbitrary（任意），所以有咩 Plan B 啊，靈童啊真係要傾清楚」，指2018年初選因無討論清楚 Plan B 造成極低票情況。李運騰問若DQ是任意，Plan B 有何用，何指2020年3至4月時大家有心理準備 Plan A 會DQ，但無想過 Plan B 和 C 也會被DQ，是郭榮鏗4月底被兩辦警告時才認真想DQ的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於第二點，何指2018年初選所有與會組織曾簽署備忘錄（memorandum），但無向公眾公開，故當爭議出現時，選民「係完全唔知民主派嘅政治人物究竟係拗緊乜嘢」。何並解釋，當時有候選人以非常高票當選，票數為第二位十倍以上，但有傳他會被DQ，不同派系均認為派第二位選一定會輸，故爭議是否應派一位有號召力的民主派元老去選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;但何指該些爭論非公開進行，選民只能從消息人士得知細節，而投票後出選正式選舉的人又似乎不由選民決定，形容為民主動力的「公信力崩潰」。何指因此到了2020年，「我好關注到底場會議會唔會有一啲需要簽名嘅協議」，並指她對應否簽協議無特定立場，但認為「呢一啲嘢必須要傾得清清楚楚」，包括會否有協議、誰簽署、簽署後有何責任義務，亦希望如有協議能盡早向公眾公開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指初選應是目的非工具2020年港人不接受泛民閉門商討後讓他們選擇&quot;&gt;何指初選應是目的非工具、2020年港人不接受泛民閉門商討後讓他們選擇&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何最後指，認為2018年的初選問題是民主派只將初選當成工具，「自己傾唔掂數就唉，選民揀啦」，但何強調，「初選本身應該要係目的，議會路線應該點樣行、議會抗爭做到咩程度，我認為應該係由選民去決定，所以選民應該要對最後有咩人出選係有一個發言權，甚至係決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，認為「由 Day 1 開始就應該要話搞初選，而唔係話傾唔埋欄先話搞」，因在2020年，「唔會再有香港人接受幾十個泛民閂埋門，然後決定一啲候選人比佢喺正式選舉做選擇」，強調不止是為了選候選人才搞初選，「而係立法會選舉係全香港人嘅事，究竟條路線點行，應該係盡量多嘅香港人一齊去決定，呢個先係我認為一定要搞初選嘅原因。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何同意，因此她希望能辦初選，而且結果要具約束力，強調她「唔接受公民投票以外嘅任何方案，同埋所有嘢都要公開、盡量公開」。被問會議是否對傳媒公開，何指「話就話閉門嘅」，但一定會有消息人士發放消息予各大報章政情專欄，「所以我有提醒自己講嘢一定要小心，唔預見街就唔講喇」，她亦無為意戴耀廷有否提到要保密。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6N7P3pU.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（19日）踏入審訊第87天。何桂藍繼續作供，表示自她任記者跟進立法會新聞時，已覺得應該否決財政預算案。何解釋即使在立會取得70席，但也不能為公共醫療系統「加一個鏰」，而政府亦會透過「基本工程儲備基金」將不受歡迎的工程與無爭議的工程綑綁，迫立法會通過，議員亦不准討論，形容是「公共財政黑洞」。何續指，無論有沒有35+，作為議員只要看到預算案內有「無辦法去審核嘅東西」，「我認為投反對票先係履行緊我作為議員嘅憲制責任」；又指即使五大訴求落實，但預算案仍存有「黑洞」、政府仍迴避議員監察，「有五大訴求我都照投反對票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍自記者生涯跟進立會新聞便覺得要否決財案&quot;&gt;何桂藍：自記者生涯跟進立會新聞便覺得要否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍今繼續作供。被問到對於否決預算案的看法，何表示「其實喺我跟立法會新聞嘅時候，我已經覺得財政預算案係應該要否決㗎喇」，並指預算案「年年都係差唔多」，問題不是款項實數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問何實際上哪一年開始有此想法，何指2011年印象很深刻，就算是建制派也否決政府臨時撥款議案（翻查資料，當時多名建制派議員缺席會議致議案無法獲逾半議員支持而否決）。李續問故何是說當時她已認為無論預算案款項數目（figures）如何，也應該否決？何說「呢個講法係好有問題」，李指他只是嘗試理解何的證供，何指「因為當你講 figure 嘅時候⋯法官就唔畀我講落去」，李即說「是你說 figures，不是我」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍即使議員坐擁大多數也只能否決不能增加撥款&quot;&gt;何桂藍：即使議員坐擁大多數也只能否決、不能增加撥款&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問為何自記者生涯便認為要否決預算案，何續解釋因在立法會，「就算你攞到70席，你都唔可以幫公共醫療系統加一個鏰」，又指每年預算案約5千至6千億，「我而家就可以話畀你聽下一年，又會有一千億喺基本工程儲備基金入面」，因預算案是有連續性的文件，「唔通你話畀我聽下年警務處唔會有撥款咩？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又指，即使2011年時坐擁立會大多數議席的建制派要求政府「派錢」，但時任財政司司長曾俊華堅持把錢投放在強積金上，建制派除了否決臨時撥款決議案施壓外「乜嘢都做唔到」，因立法會議員只可就細項提出削減撥款，不可提出更改或增加撥款，也不可改變政府的財政開支方向。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍指政府捆綁式迫立會議員通過預政預算-謂公共財政嘅黑洞&quot;&gt;何桂藍指政府捆綁式迫立會議員通過預政預算 謂「公共財政嘅黑洞」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，大概於2017年，她做橫洲事件的專題期間，才知道有佔財政預算案六分一款項的「基本工程儲備基金」，但立法會議員審議時卻不准就此基金討論。何指少於2千萬至3千萬元的工程均可使用這基金，而政府會將約一萬個工程項目綑綁在一起，並將一些「不受歡迎的工程」分拆成前期工程、渠務工程等多個項目，連同餘下9千多個不受爭議的工程項目，迫立法會一定要通過，「我形容呢一個係公共財政嘅黑洞。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍即使五大訴求落實-若政府迴避監察依然會反對財案&quot;&gt;何桂藍：即使五大訴求落實 若政府迴避監察依然會反對財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問何，是否可以說她自2017年起，便認為財政預算案應被否決，直至2020年想法都沒有改變。何指2020年時她的想法是，只要議員無法盡責地審議和審核財政預算案，便應該否決。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指整個立法會否決和議員個人投反對票有重大分別，問何桂藍談及「否決」時是指哪一樣。何桂藍指：「無論有35+或者冇35+，如果我係一個議員，只要我見到財政預算案入面有一啲我無辦法去審核嘅東西，我認為投反對票先係履行緊我作為議員嘅憲制責任」，又指「就算五大訴求落實，如果我頭先所講嘅呢啲黑洞嘅問題，政府透過程序去迴避議員監察嘅呢一啲問題，仍然存在嘅話，有五大訴求我都照投反對票」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉聞言指政府「將塵掃進地毯底」的做法沿用已久，何桂藍表示會形容為「化整為零」，例如人工島最初亦透過前期研究「塞入」基本工程儲備基金。陳續指故2020年政府若仍按慣常做法處理，何也會投反對票？何反問何謂慣常方式，又提高聲線對咪說已過去的事無法假設，但自2020年起陳茂波便已開始動用「未來基金」。何說話時與陳慶偉疊聲，陳一度指「不用大叫，那不會令你的說話更有說服力」，何則說「我冇嗌」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指因公共財政審核制度反對財案-批納稅人無法阻政府行為&quot;&gt;何指因公共財政審核制度反對財案 批納稅人無法阻政府行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並解釋，政府2016年成立「未來基金」時，本來規定該3千億元未來10年均不可動用、如要動用須經立會批准，但2020年開始陳茂波便不斷繞過立法會在基金內「攞錢」，「一開始係注資國泰，然後話搞北部都會區，而家話搞香港淡馬錫」。何表示，「我必須要指出嗰度每一份都係納稅人嘅錢，但係納稅人喺呢個制度之下，係完全阻止唔到佢做呢啲行為」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉笑着說「聽着，何小姐，其實我同意你某些觀點，但這裡不是一個辯論財政司司長對錯的論壇」，又指問題很簡單，只是如果政府於2020年仍沿用何桂藍提及的做法，何是否依然會否決預算案。何指理解如問題內有不符事實的內容她必須指出，指2020年就是無跟一般程序。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳再問，因此何會就預算案投反對票？何大聲說「當然啦」。李運騰問，故何反對預算案不是因為「35+」，而是因為反對當中的項目或計算方法？何回應「唔係一啲項目或者規則，係成個公共財政審核制度」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再問，而即使政府落實五大訴求，但何反對某些項目，何仍會反對預算案？何說「唔係 items」，李指他明白，指何是說若有任何可非議的做法，即使五大訴求得到回應也會反對，又着何「不要為拗而拗，我只是想幫你」，何說「大家咁話」。陳慶偉最後問，那何是否同意？何說：「既然係 objectionable，當然要反對啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天續審。歌手黃耀明今午有前來旁聽，何步入被告欄前向他笑說：「你下次唔好嚟，我好緊張！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱首次會議與劉頴匡斬釘截鐵說要初選-終決定辦初選&quot;&gt;何稱首次會議與劉頴匡斬釘截鐵說要初選 終決定辦初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，何下午亦談及首次新東協調會議的情況。何指本身以為只是有意參選人參與，但到達後看到很多不同地區組織和地區獨立民主派人士，共20至30人，對與會者感「出奇」。何不記得戴耀廷會上說過什麼，亦無為意趙家賢或其他民主動力職員是否在場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，首次會議歷時兩小時，「真係冇乜人出聲嘅」，因基本上大黨候選人亦沒有親身出席，他們的代表也「一句起兩句止」，大家「發言意欲係唔強」。何並指，會上戴耀廷先着各方自我介紹，再問想民調抑或公民投票，何形容當時氣氛「有啲奇怪」，「全世界都望住我同劉頴匡」，因當時輿論指「素人一定唔 buy 初選」，而她感覺其他人「就係睇吓我哋呢兩個特別受關注嘅素人係點睇喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，當時劉很斬釘截鐵說要初選，「然後我就補刀（和應）」；她不太記得其他人發言，當中有人擔心初選的資源問題，但無斬釘截鐵說要民調，只有她與劉「好斬釘截鐵話要初選」，最後「輪完一 round」戴耀廷就宣布決定辦初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱首次會議曾討論應否有共同綱領印象會附在提名表讓參選人簽署&quot;&gt;何稱首次會議曾討論應否有共同綱領、印象會附在提名表讓參選人簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又指，首次會議有談及票站問題，「我先至明點解咁多地區組織都喺度」；亦有談及 Plan B，結論應是「靈童制」，但應無甚爭議。至於簽署協議，何指應是在首次會議討論應否有共同綱領，而她所得印象是會議共識會放在一張紙上，並會附在初選提名表格內。何指，由於表格只有候選人會簽署，而放在提名表格內相信「一定會向公眾公開」，故對此安排感到可以。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示民主動力黎敬輝就該次會議的紀錄，提及何曾稱「必須要有約束力初選、進行投票，可以於7月票選綱領，9月進行參選人選舉」，何確認說過類似的話，即一定要有選民投票，並笑言「而家講起可能有啲傻豬咁啦」，指當時認為如要制訂有約束力的共同綱領、要求所有候選人簽署和確認執行，「我係話要攞出去畀選民公投嘅」，被告席的林卓廷說「吓」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，因初選並非比例代表制的選舉，如有共同綱領，「你就係要求新界東6個立法會議員去做同一件事」，並在法官追問下指她不是說一定要有共同綱領，但如有共同綱領就希望有選民投票，但現時回看當然「唔係好實際」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何反駁趙家賢證供-稱第二次會議始討論否決權從無講過中港破局&quot;&gt;何反駁趙家賢證供 稱第二次會議始討論否決權、從無講過「中港破局」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對區諾軒早前稱於第二次會議有否決權的爭論，趙家賢則稱是第一次；何今指是第二次會上討論，該次會議亦有討論「會」或「會積極」運用否決權，之後再討論議席數量。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於趙家賢指何桂藍在首次會議，曾稱要以立法會為抗爭陣地引致「中港關係破局」，及「將整個制度去到推到盡」，將一國兩制政治制度「打破」。何指她應於6月才開始講「破局」，但從無講過「中港破局」和「推到盡」，又指其用字是「建制內嘅臨界點」，但無於會議上說，是於 Facebook 上說。何又指，首次會議後無收過任何會議紀錄或筆記，亦無收過新東協調機制文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（18日）踏入審訊第86天，展開新東辯方案情。前《立場新聞》記者何桂藍開始作供，表示在北京清華大學修讀學士，當時身邊多數人均準備畢業後赴美，「呢個地方如果所有最叻嘅人都仆住要走，我覺得好 pathetic（可悲）囉。」何又指，在校曾修讀中國代史和「毛鄧三」理論，但「出貓」就可合格；而她對中國政治認識來自微博，時為中國公民發展最蓬勃之時，何她自言對中國無怨恨，但認知有很多不公義，形容是有理有據的批評及對仍抗爭的人的一種關懷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又供稱曾於《立場新聞》和BBC任職，並指2014年任職的《主場》結束時覺得香港與大陸差不多，「表面有嘅保障其實全部都係冇嘅，政權想捽死你，一下就捽死你。」她自言入行兩年已知記者在香港做不長，但2019年前從無想過轉行，因認為輿論尚有空間時，有人去梳理政治上爭拗是非常重要，稱「本身已經諗住做到坐（監）為止。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍開始作供-稱生於英屬香港-曾赴北京清華讀書&quot;&gt;何桂藍開始作供 稱生於英屬香港 曾赴北京清華讀書&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民協前主席施德來上周作供完畢，本周正式開展新東辯方案情，由前《立場新聞》記者何桂藍先作供。早上10時，紮馬尾、身穿粉紅色裇衫和深藍長褲的何桂藍在兩名懲教人員陪同下步出被告欄，她面帶微笑向旁聽席張望，坐下後與身旁的傳譯主任交談。何表現輕鬆，不時調整座位高度和轉凳，又轉身望向旁聽席以手勢與親友交流，並數度呼氣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何宣誓後接受大律師 Trevor Beel 的主問。她作供時背靠座位，雙手翹起，表示她生於1990年8月24日「英屬香港」，於北京清華大學修讀學士課程。被問是哪段時間在北京讀書，何說「2018（後更正為2008年），奧運嗰年，去到2012，即係反國教嗰年」。被問如何能赴京讀書，何笑着掩口說：「因為佢哋都好想一啲港澳台嘅學生可以上到清華去讀書，所以港澳收生佢哋係相應降低咗啲要求，同埋有獎學金。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰打斷問為何要知道這些資訊，指不關心她如何進入清華。Beel 指是關於何的背景，續問及她獎學金的事，惟李再打斷說沒有興趣知道，何聳肩。何續指，於清華修讀外國語言及文學系，並指當地有很多必修政治課程 ，如中國近代史和「毛鄧三」，即「毛澤東鄧小平同三個代表」的理論。Beel 說，所以何會對中國政治制度有些認識？何即說：「唔係嘅，因為嗰啲堂大家都係出貓就可以 pass 嘅」，被告席即爆出笑聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱對中國政治認識來自微博對人才仆住走感可悲-對中國無怨恨但認知很多不公義&quot;&gt;何稱對中國政治認識來自微博、對人才「仆住走」感可悲 對中國無怨恨但認知很多不公義&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰即嚴肅指，「出貓」是不誠實（dishonesty）的行為，Beel 是否想顯示當事人的不誠實。Beel 指他聽不到何的答案，李續着他最好小心。何續指，她對中國政治的認識是來自微博，「因為我喺北京嘅時間，正正就係中國嘅公民社會發展最蓬勃嘅時候。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/UjZggwa.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問她當時對中國有否任何怨恨（resentment），何說她當時生活的圈子為全中國最好的其中一間大學，但當時身邊有八九成人一入學就準備畢業後去美國修讀研究院，「咁呢個地方如果所有最叻嘅人都仆住要走，我覺得好 pathetic（可悲）囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，但另一方面她在微博或北京民間所看到的「完全係另一回事」，並指「我對中華人民共和國或者中國呢個地方係冇 resentment，但我都了解到上面有非常之多唔公義嘅情況」，「所以我會形容嗰啲係一啲有理有據嘅批評，同埋對一啲喺上面仍然堅持緊抗爭緊嘅人嘅一種關懷。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，她2018至2020年在丹麥與荷蘭修讀碩士課程，在荷蘭主要修讀政治傳播（political communication），而因疫情關係，她2020年3月返港，同年6月提交論文。何指，她在學時沒有與政府機構接觸，但有與國際特赦等民間組織接觸，「反而中國領事館就成日 friend 搭 friend 搵人食飯……我冇去嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱2019年前從無想過轉行本身已經諗住做到坐為止&quot;&gt;何稱2019年前從無想過轉行：本身已經諗住做到坐為止&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就何桂藍的工作，她指自己2011年於香港電台新聞部的 Video Team 任實習生，2012年畢業返港後於8月加入當時的《主場新聞》任「底層記者」，至2014年《主場》突結業，她遂於網媒《破折號》任職數個月，並在年底《主場》舊班底重組後加入《立場新聞》，其後於2017年離職，2017至2018年在 BBC World Service 任記者，至2018年起在歐洲讀書時，曾於烏克蘭和西班牙等為《立場》做 Freelance 報導。何指，她曾獲兩個人權新聞獎和亞洲出版業協會（SOPA）最佳特寫報導次等獎，當時是訪問陳健民教授對中國公民社會的貢獻，及為何陳「有咁深嘅羈絆」都要回來香港搞佔領中環。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，2020年前何有否想過從政，何說2014年《主場》結束時，「我就覺得香港其實都好似同大陸差唔多喎，表面有嘅保障其實全部都係冇嘅，政權想捽死你，一下就捽死你」，鄒家成微笑。何續指，「所以我入咗行兩年我就已經知記者喺香港係做唔長嘅，但係19年之前我從來都冇諗過轉行，因為喺公共輿論仲有空間嘅時候，我認為有人去梳理一啲政治上嘅爭拗係非常之重要，咁嗰時本身已經諗住做到坐為止啦，咁坐完監就之後再算啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/LkxyWrJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（18日）踏入審訊第86天，何桂藍繼續作供，對趙家賢指戴耀廷佔中後成為民主發展較前進概念人士的「帶領者」，何指情況正相反，指戴當時被激進派不斷攻擊甚至唾棄，常發表「創見」但對當時年青人並不吸引。何續解釋，「五大訴求」於6.12衝突後民陣發聲明、和太古廣場墮樓亡的梁凌杰提出4點訴求後有「雛形」，至7.1抗爭者於立法會內讀宣言提及「立即實行雙普選」為第五個訴求為「源起」；而政府其後雖撤回修例，示威者亦不想運動就此結束，自7月起「香港政制不公義」成了運動最核心訴求，雙普選是唯一不變的訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「攬炒」對不同人可有完全不同意思，而對她來說「攬炒」並非目的，而是一種精神，「就係明知自己會承受好大嘅代價，簡單嚟講就係會炒埋自己啦，都要堅持做自己認為應該做嘅嘢」，北京和香港政權則會失去對香港的控制。何又指在反抗同時，「必然都係同時建立緊一啲嘢」，最終會導致政權有所削弱，而過程「打開好多空間」，才是運動真正建樹。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍稱民主派一直有協調選舉-惟2016年協調失敗&quot;&gt;何桂藍稱民主派一直有協調選舉 惟2016年協調失敗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選新東的前《立場新聞》記者何桂藍今開始作供，今早供述其教育和工作背景。大律師 Trevor Beel 續問，2020年前何對香港初選有否任何理解。何表示，早前法官稱2018年前香港無辦過協調，但其實民主派一直都有協調，早至2004年功能組別已指要辦初選、2012年何俊仁選特首時已有初選，2016年立會選舉亦有協調，但因「破咗局」，故協調失敗。法官問她「破局」意思，何指有很多不同意思，指選舉很多時會撞區，而民主派協調通常由民主動力或民主派較中立人士進行，但2016年有選區嘗試協調惟「協調唔到」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，2018年初九龍西及新界東曾舉行立法會補選，因當時民主派於地區直選得票首次跌穿五成，屬非常大和有新聞價值的事，故當時她負責為《立場》做專題，探討民主派敗選原因，當時普遍認為初選是其中一個因素。何又解釋，該些專題會以數萬甚至數十萬字分數次刊出，「但我印象非常深刻個 hit rate（點擊率）勁低嘅，因為輸咗大家就冇興趣知道發生咩事。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱2018年立會補充初選-plan-b安排有合法性問題&quot;&gt;何稱2018年立會補充初選 「Plan B」安排有合法性問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，她的文章當時是否對民動辦初選有批判，何說「做報導當然係需要批判啦」，但作為一個記者「我當時冇所謂支持或者唔支持個初選嘅」。法官李運騰問及，當時是辦協調抑或初選，何指「協調」是指民主派有意出選者「閂埋門自己傾掂佢」，但初選則是有選民投票，「由選民去決定邊一個代表民主派去出選，民主派自己係控制唔到個結果嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「所有嘢都係由協調開始」，「覺得協調唔到喇，所以2018就有初選」，並指2018年時九西一席原屬青年新政，但因青政是2015年新成立的本土派政團，與民主派一直無甚合作基礎，有部分民主派不認為他們是民主派一部分，「睇唔到個議席要畀返青政」，故決定辦初選。何又舉例指當年香港眾志羅冠聰被DQ、參選的周庭再被DQ，再由區諾軒出選，該次便不需要初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，當年就初選結果的合法性有否任何問題，何指本來初選結果「非常之明顯」，惟勝出的姚松炎傳聞會被DQ。何並指，以其理解當時商討初選機制時無認真處理過「Plan B」的問題，故當時出現很大的合法性問題；加上辦初選前曾辦好幾次會議，與會者曾簽署一份無向公眾公開的備忘錄（memorandum），但因姚松炎很遲才決定參選，故根本無參與協調會議，「咁 Plan B 嘅問題邊個決定呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱2014年後戴耀廷被激進派不斷攻擊甚至唾棄-經常發表創見有啲真係好痴線&quot;&gt;何稱2014年後戴耀廷被激進派不斷攻擊甚至唾棄 經常發表創見「有啲真係好痴線」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問何桂藍認為2018年初選是公開抑或閉門，惟法官李運騰認為問題不是最準確，Beel 續轉問下一個話題，指趙家賢曾稱戴耀廷在佔領中環後成為民主發展「較前進概念」人士的「帶領者」，並引領了很多抗爭派政治素人出選，問何是否同意。何先說：「可唔可以請法官講嘢大聲啲，因為我聽唔到」，李運騰指他沒有發問，何說：「無論條問題係咪 direct to 我，我相信我都要聽到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續坐直身子，雙手放枱回答問題，表示：「我會形容個情況係正好相反」，因戴耀廷在2014年後，「就可以話係畀激進派不斷攻擊，甚至部分激進派係唾棄佢嘅，因為覺得佢份人太溫和」，並指會形容戴耀廷的支持者「基本上就係D100嘅聽眾」，鄒家成和陳志全等發笑。何續指，該些人是中年，「好驚暴力啦，但係喺社區係有好多投入嘅，佢哋係非常 buy 深耕細作、遍地開花呢啲心態嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，2014至2019年間，戴耀廷經常在 Facebook 發表不同「創見」，「有啲真係好痴線嘅」，李運騰問何為何會知道，何說「因為我有 follow 佢 Facebook 囉」，並舉例戴「2016年就話立法會要過半啦」，在社會氣氛非常低迷時「就豪言話要搵晒四百幾個人填滿每一個區議會嘅選區」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VxfGClm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指《立場》有就此做專題，她曾訪問2017至2018年參與戴耀廷計劃、想於2019年區選「填白區」的人，他們可能是剛畢業的環保人士、或追究圍標的居民團體人士，「呢啲我會認為一啲都唔激進嘅人」；並指以她所知戴當時找人填白區「係好困難」，因當時社會氣氛和主流政治討論，是說「要激進化」，故戴當時所倡導的「對當時嘅年青人嚟講係唔吸引嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何供述對五大訴求理解-稱612衝突及梁凌杰抗議後有雛形&quot;&gt;何供述對「五大訴求」理解 稱6.12衝突及梁凌杰抗議後有雛形&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問，2019年五大訴求如何出現。何表示，2019年6月12日，金鐘發生了示威想阻止《逃犯條例》通過，當日警察曾施放催淚彈和發射橡膠子彈，而當晚民陣發出聲明列出四個訴求，包括撤回《逃犯條例》、調查警察當日行動、釋放被捕人士，及由於當日政府已宣布示威是「暴動」，故民陣要求政府撤回此定義，何形容這是五大訴求的「雛形」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，到了6月15日林鄭宣布暫緩《逃犯條例》，當日梁凌杰將四個訴求寫在白布站在太古廣場天台，包括不要送中、釋放學生傷者、我們不是暴動和林鄭下台。何指兩個版本雖有不同，但均流傳得非常廣，尤其梁凌杰身穿黃雨衣，身旁有數個訴求的圖片在網上非常廣傳，故6月時大家均堅持（adhere to）該四個訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NGPbiR2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何解釋網絡對示威影響-指七一抗爭者立會內讀宣言為五大訴求源起&quot;&gt;何解釋網絡對示威影響 指七一抗爭者立會內讀宣言為「五大訴求」源起&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續稱，到了2019年7月1日，有示威者進入立法會，「當時在下都喺入面啦。」Beel 問她是示威者抑或記者，李運騰問 Beel 是否真的要問，Beel 說他想要澄清。何指「好重要㗎呢個問題」，並稱當時她正放暑假返港，知道《立場》「真係好唔夠人，咁我就幫吓佢哋啦」，並強調「2019年我係冇做過示威者嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何確認，她以記者身分進入立法會，而當時示威者衝入立會前，示威社群內部有很多反對聲音，認為他們破壞了當日日間的和平遊行，尤其是大家當時稱這是「反送中運動」，但7月2日立法會並無相關會議會召開，「咁當時好多所謂和理非就不斷罵啲示威者衝入去做咩呢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問何是指當時在大樓內發生的情況？何指理解到法官不用 Facebook，並向法官解釋自2019年6月起，在一個叫「Telegram」的即時通訊軟件上開設了無數個相關群組和頻道，亦有「連登討論區」。何並指，自2012年底開始，「一場社會運動就唔淨淨係指喺現場參與運動嘅人」，而當日無論是在立法會內的人、剛剛由銅鑼灣行到去金鐘的人、甚至在歐美等地看直播的人，「大家都係好踴躍咁喺我頭先提到嘅各個平台發表意見嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，她當時居於元朗，返夜更，「咁由元朗去金鐘塞車塞到傻啦」，她全程在車上望住網上對運動的爭拗。何解釋，「線上嘅爭拗係會影響到現場嘅發展嘅」，而當時網上很多人問「點解要衝入去」時，有人反駁指政府「暫緩咗隨時都可以拎返上嚟，而只要佢一拎返上立法會，其實民主派係無辦法阻止佢通過嘅，所以問題喺立法會嗰度」，而在爭論時網上出現了一份宣言，首次出現今天所說的「五大訴求」，基本上沿用民陣的四個，第五個訴求則是「立即實行雙普選」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，當時宣言內「冇提到暴唔暴力嗰啲嘢」，但有提到「抗爭者係出於對香港無窮無盡嘅愛」，加上當天早上有第三名參與運動的人士輕生，故宣言提到「唔想香港再為公義再添亡魂」，才有進入立法會的行動。何續指，當時在立法會議事廳內的抗爭者看到這篇宣言，就當着全世界媒體的面前宣讀，「我會話呢個就係我哋今日所講五大訴求嗰個源起」。被問宣讀時是否在場，何指不太記得，「因為我嗰時喺立法會入面周圍走。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱反修例變成較細訴求-自19年7月政制不公義為運動最核心訴求&quot;&gt;何稱反修例變成較細訴求 自19年7月政制不公義為運動最核心訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 指，政府於2019年10月撤回《逃犯條例》，至2020年是變回四個抑或維持五個訴求？何指，五大訴求此口號或綱領「其實唔係用咗好耐」，而政府撤回修例時的確出現了「五大訴求 缺一不可」，但她理解示威者意思是「想表達覺得場運動唔應該喺呢度完」。不過何指之後出現了很多新訴求，如重組警隊、解散警隊，「咁林鄭下台就不嬲都彈出彈入嘅，咁暴動、釋放都有好多唔同嘅 variation，唯一冇變過嘅就係雙普選嗰條。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何並指，「其實『反修例運動』呢個名，純粹係因為諗唔到第二個名先至一直用住先嘅」，但《逃犯條例》本身已變成無關痛癢或較細的訴求，因運動過程出現了更多令示威者覺得要反抗的事情，並指自2019年7月起，「香港政制嘅不公義」就是運動其中最核心的訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱攬炒是種精神-明知承受好大代價仍堅持做認為應做的事&quot;&gt;何稱「攬炒」是種精神 明知承受好大代價仍堅持做認為應做的事&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問對「攬炒」的理解，何指自一開始「攬炒」對不同人已可有完全不同的意思。她解釋這詞語最初在「連登討論區」出現，最原初意思是將香港政府或警察的不義行為傳達予國際社會知道，「從而令到中國唔可以維持香港一切正常嘅假象。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於何桂藍自己，她表示「我覺得攬炒唔係一個目的」，因若攬炒要指向一個特定目的，「就拗好耐都拗唔完嘅，大家都有唔同目的。」何並指「我會覺得攬炒係一種精神，就係明知自己會承受好大嘅代價，簡單嚟講就係會炒埋自己啦，都要堅持做自己認為應該做嘅嘢」，鄒家成微笑。何續說，「可能你會問，咁對家炒咗啲咩呢？佢失去咗對我哋嘅控制，亦都冇辦法再控制香港事態嘅發展」，並補充「佢哋」是指北京和香港政權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指：「而喺我哋去行動嘅時候，我哋喺反抗嘅同時，必然都係同時建立緊一啲嘢，而我哋透過反抗所建立嘅嘢，最終都係會導致佢嘅權力係有所削弱。至於我哋做嘅嘢係咩呢，就每一個人都唔同喇，所以我認為保持個開放性係比較好嘅。」何解釋，因大家覺得社運會有一個「好明確嘅訴求」，「達到就達到，達唔到就輸喇」，「但係喺唔同嘅時空，其實真係好少社會運動會達到佢哋原初講嗰個訴求，但係喺運動嘅過程入面你會打開好多空間，嗰啲先係個運動真正嘅建樹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;早休時，梁國雄微笑向何桂藍豎起拇指，鄒家成亦向她做打拳手勢，何發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ei1x69F.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（18日）踏入審訊第86天。何桂藍繼續作供，談及對民主派35+可能性的理解。就時任中聯辦主任駱惠寧稱民主派過半企圖「奪取管治權」，何指民主派過半只有否決權，但不能影響政府決策，奪權無可能出現；又對時任全國人大常委譚耀宗稱民主派控制立會下，「政府無法確保重要議案通過」便是「嚴重憲政危機」，直言「咁你個憲政真係好有問題」。何指，理解駱惠寧眼中「你有一個否決佢嘅權力，你就已經係搶咗佢嘅權力」，故當時認為「只要民主派掂到35+嗰條線，DQ又好釋法又好，北京呢個層面都會出手阻止」，不關乎民主派入議會後會做什麼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又表示，不同意戴耀廷〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉一文以「宿命」為標題，指香港宿命或變成澳門或大陸任何一個城市，但「唔係話中共壓落嚟，香港人就一定會反抗，反抗係香港人嘅選擇」。何又指以2019年的民氣，認為民主派有可能取得35+，但料中共必定會以新方法應對，「唯一一勞永逸嘅方法就係取消選舉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何桂藍稱中聯辦主任駱惠寧2月已指北京不容民主派立會過半&quot;&gt;何桂藍稱中聯辦主任駱惠寧2月已指北京不容民主派立會過半&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何桂藍繼續作供，被問何時知道「35+計劃」，何稱立法會要過半一事，「基本上你區選大勝第二日啲人已經講緊喇」，她亦留意到戴耀廷2019年12月已有撰文談及。法官李運騰問那她何時知道戴和區諾軒組織的35+計劃，何說「我覺得個困難係在於，從頭到尾件事對我同好多人嚟講，係『民主派初選』」，而民主派每次選舉都有協調，故當時認知他們「一定有傾開」，但對戴何時加入並不清楚。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;大律師 Trevor Beel 續展示《香港01》2020年3月25日的譚耀宗訪問〈【基本法30年】譚耀宗：倘泛民議會過半觸發憲政危機 中央勢出手〉，何稱當時有看過，指「呢篇文好爆㗎當時」，因是政府或建制派第一次表態，若民主派嘗試過半「佢就會DQ人喇」。何續指，此前時任中聯辦主任駱惠寧已於2月指「北京係唔會容許民主派立法會過半」，但「用咩手段令你過唔到半就冇講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱2020年1月至2月-基本上無印象有人提否決預算案&quot;&gt;何稱2020年1月至2月 基本上無印象有人提否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，基本上每次立會選舉民主派目標「永遠都係攞多啲位」，但2020年1到2月間基本上無印象有人提過否決財政預算案，因當時聲量較大的討論，是立會過半後應即開始有抗議行動，抑或等到2021年特首選舉視乎選委會能否過半。何並指當時未討論過半後採取什麼行動時，「駱惠寧已經衝咗出嚟話唔駛諗過半喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指但戴於2019年12月已撰文談及否決預算案。何重申，因戴並非「真係咁多人 follow 嘅意見領袖」，而當時沈旭暉提出應待2021年特首選舉後才考慮的討論，才是「比較主流」，因迎合到運動中有很多人想特首下台的想法。何強調，立會過半與否決預算案是兩個討論，並對訪問引子「民主派矢志奪取過半數議席，甚至揚言藉兩度否決《預算案》迫使特首下台」，指真的想不起當時有哪個民主派政治人物有這樣說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱民主派過半只有否決權不能奪取管治權-奪權根本不可能出現&quot;&gt;何稱民主派過半只有否決權不能奪取管治權 奪權根本不可能出現&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續引訪問提及時任中聯辦主任駱惠寧閉門見建制派時，指「民主派爭取議會過半是企圖『奪取管治權』。譚耀宗認同有關說法，質疑反對派一旦贏得議會控制權，會另搞一套，『不搞一國兩制，不按《基本法》辦事』，對特區政府管治造成嚴重衝擊」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指第一感覺是駱惠寧對立法會制度「唔係好熟悉」，亦對譚的說法「匪夷所思」。何指，「審到嚟呢度我相信大家都好熟悉，過半其實只係有否決呢個權力」，但如要提出議案或對公共財政要有審核，「過半係唔夠嘅」，故「淨係可以否決就話係奪取咗個管治權，唔係好解得通」；惟何指，她亦認識到在駱眼中，「你有一個否決佢嘅權力，你就已經係搶咗佢嘅權力喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又引譚訪問稱若立會在民主派掌控下通過違反《基本法》的議案，「中央擁有違憲審查權，人大常委會可發還審議」，惟何指若議案由政府提出便不會違憲，且在一般人認識中「奪權根本冇可能出現」，因「無論幾多席都好，中央都係可以發還你嘅」，故不知道譚是認同駱的什麼說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 問，所以民主派立會過半，並不能奪權？何指奪權是「好 figurative（形象）」的說法，但如果「你連你倡議嘅政策你都唔可以提出、唔可以辯論、唔可以去落實嘅話，咁真係算唔上一個管治嘅權力」，並指在《基本法》框架下，除非地區直選和功能組別均過半，否則制度上無法影響政府決策，「你最多淨係否決佢㗎啫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問民主派過半是否成事不足敗事有餘-何稱政府要敗事立法會都阻唔到&quot;&gt;官問民主派過半是否「成事不足敗事有餘」 何稱：政府要敗事立法會都阻唔到&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，故民主派過半是「成事不足，敗事有餘」？即或許不能達成什麼，但足以阻礙政府政策？何舉例觀塘音樂噴泉曾引起很大反對，連建制派亦不支持，故在財委會一度否決，但當時議員的權力只能提出意見，無法在制度上令政府將議案由「唔理想」變成「可接受」。何指政府其後「求其改咗少少嘢」再上財委會，但因已非最熱烈議題，故於財委會通過。而該音樂噴泉開幕後，數小時後就全壞掉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續提高聲量搖頭回答法官問題：「當政府要敗事嘅時候，立法會都阻佢唔到」，並指法官用「spoil（敗事）」一字的前提是「嗰樣嘢本身係可取嘅」。李運騰指那他改用「阻礙（obstruct）」，何即回應：「當政府倒行逆施或者做一啲民主派議員見到係唔合理嘅事情嘅時候，人民選出嚟嘅議員係應該要可以阻止到佢，呢樣嘢叫做『制衡』，亦都係立法機關嘅存在意義之一。」李運騰問，所以當民主派立會過半雖不能達到什麼，但能達致制衡？何指中文是制衡，但英文應是「hold something accountable」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱譚耀宗定義無法確保重要議案通過就是憲政危機咁你個憲政真係好有問題&quot;&gt;何稱譚耀宗定義「無法確保重要議案通過」就是憲政危機：咁你個憲政真係好有問題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 其後改問，民主派立會過半是否會令政府重新考慮其政策？何說：「理論上係嘅，但係香港政府我真係唔敢講喇。」何續主動引文章有關「憲政危機」的部分，指譚耀宗提及：「即使反對派成功藉否決預算案迫使特首下台，特首任命權始終在中央手上，但他承認若由民主派控制議會，將直接衝擊特區政府管治權，政府無法確保重要議案通過，行政主導無從談起，對香港而言是嚴重憲政危機。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何表示，理解譚指即使特首因否決財案而下台，但任命權仍在中央手上，故譚認為即使迫特首下台「冇問題」；而譚背負全國人大常委身分，將憲政危機定義為「政府無法確保重要議案通過」，何指此事只要民主派過半就可做到，「簡單嚟講，都唔需要投票否決咗你，只要有否決嘅可能，譚耀宗已經覺得係有一個嚴重嘅憲政危機喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，前提是立法會是反政府，惟何說「我唔係咁樣認為」，並指「重要議案」四字其實「講乜嘢都得」，例如對現屆政府來說「簡約公屋」一定是最重要的議案。何強調，譚的說法只談及可能性而非實際行為，「只要佢確保唔到佢想過嘅議案過到，對佢哋嚟講就係憲政危機，咁你個憲政真係好有問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱只要民主派碰到35的線-dq又好釋法又好北京都會出手阻止&quot;&gt;何稱只要民主派碰到35+的線 「DQ又好釋法又好」北京都會出手阻止&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續引訪問提及，譚耀宗看到2019年的區選「一些自決派或『暗獨』人士均獲准入閘」，「建制派對此十分不滿，擔心此風氣蔓延至立會選舉，政府有責任把好關。」此時法官陳慶偉打斷問為何要判斷譚的對錯，何稱「因為佢係一個國家領導人」，陳慶偉指他是問律師不是問何。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 回應，是想知道何讀文章後對於民主派能否取得35+的看法。李運騰指看不到文章如何有幫助，Beel 稱因譚訪問曾提及擔心過半會有憲政危機，鼓勵政府DQ，望發問時提供基礎。Beel 續問，何於3月看到文章時，認為民主派立會過半是可能的嗎？何重申，「個問題唔係民主派會做啲乜，而係喺『35』呢個數字度」，又指譚被問能否透過釋法處理時僅稱不可無依據下「作啲嘢」出來，「即係有依據就會釋（法）啦」，故其理解是「只要民主派掂到35+嗰條線，DQ又好、釋法又好，北京呢個層面都會出手阻止」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;譚訪問稱不滿暗獨人士獲准入閘-何北京眼中大家都係港獨派&quot;&gt;譚訪問稱不滿「暗獨」人士獲准入閘 何：北京眼中大家都係港獨派&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，譚是談及「自決派」。何回應譚亦有用「暗獨」，並指留意到「連許智峯同郭榮鏗都畀人話係宣揚港獨㗎嘛，即係喺北京眼中，其實大家都係港獨派，不用分那麼細」，陳志全、余慧明等發笑。何續指，指許和郭是港獨派，「對任何對民主派政治有認識嘅人嚟講，都係冇辦法理解得到嘅」，但中央經常如此說，故譚用「暗獨」這字實是「包羅萬有」，「指邊個民主派都可以。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再問，所以何當時相信民主派取得35+是否可能？何指，理解譚是說「如果DQ都D唔到你哋攞唔到35」，即是DQ後民主派仍取得35席或以上，「佢哋就會用釋法嘅手法令到民主派由35+變35-」，但「佢哋究竟作啲乜嘢根據出嚟（釋法），我就估唔到喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱不同意戴耀廷文章宿命說法-指反抗係香港人嘅選擇&quot;&gt;何稱不同意戴耀廷文章「宿命」說法 指「反抗係香港人嘅選擇」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續問及戴耀廷4月28日於《蘋果日報》刊出的〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉一文。何桂藍確認，文章剛發布時她有讀過，並主動表示「我諗喺進入啲 steps 之前不如進入咗個標題先，我唔同意呢個標題，因為佢用『宿命』呢個寫法係講緊呢件事係無論如何都會發生咁樣」。何續指，理解「宿命」指：「人係受一連串佢冇辦法控制嘅因果所左右，但人自己永遠都可以成為第一個原因，生又好死又好，有時難免要退，但唔可以避。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，「香港嘅宿命可能係變澳門或者大陸任何一個城市，因為呢個係專制政權嘅慣性，但係，反抗唔係必然。香港面對嘅歷史局限，唔單止係束縛，亦都係香港之所以成為香港嘅條件。唔係話中共壓落嚟，香港人就一定會反抗，反抗係香港人嘅選擇。所以我認為用宿命形容係唔啱嘅，呢個係一啲新嘅嘢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何指，簡單而言她不同意戴耀廷「個 tone 講到好似好宿命論咁啦」，並指之後的十步「其實每一點都唔一定要咁樣發生嘅，香港人嘅反應可能唔同」，雖專制政權有慣性，「但係加速要加到幾快，中共都有自己嘅能動性嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱攬炒十步自第二步後已覺不可能-惟終被現實打敗第八步提早來臨&quot;&gt;何稱「攬炒十步」自第二步後已覺不可能 惟終被現實打敗第八步提早來臨&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 續逐步問何是否同意，就第一步政府廣泛DQ民主派，由 Plan B 參選，何指當時兩辦已譴責郭榮鏗，故的確認為會出現廣泛DQ，但對 Plan B 為何不會同時被DQ有保留，因當時 Plan B 人選也是同一政黨或本身有知名度的人。就第二步因DQ刺激更多港人投票支持民主派，策略投票下成功取得35+，何指策略投票即使成功，要達到35+是「非常難，直情係奇蹟㗎喇，但唔係冇可能嘅」，但因或有DQ或釋法，「我唔認為35席可以維持到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，由第二步開始已認為不可能，故之後的也是推演。李運騰問，所以整體而言，何認為「攬炒十步」並非現實的期望？何稱雖然她這樣覺得，「但係我哋大家最後都被現實打敗啦，我覺得冇可能，但最後第八步可能喺呢篇文兩個禮拜之後就嚟咗喇。」根據該篇文章，戴於第八步指全國人大宣布香港進入緊急狀態，中央政府把《國安法》直接適用於香港，解散立法會、成立臨時立法會、下屆特首由協商產生，大舉拘押民主派領袖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱若中共不做基本法以外的事-認為民主派35是實際&quot;&gt;何稱若中共不做《基本法》以外的事 認為民主派35+是實際&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，何當時的心態是否認為「攬炒十步」不切實際？何未有正面回答，僅指譚耀宗訪問所談的符合大家本身判斷，並指若中共是容許香港人以民選選出35個或以上民主派議員，「就唔需要有功能組別，都唔需要有分組點票。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，那何當時認為35+是否不切實際的目標？何指以2019年的社會運動和「民氣」，「即使功能組別幾難選都好」、亦有比例代表制，仍認為民主派是有可能透過人民授權取得35+，「好可能係突破到本身立法會組成上嘅限制。」然而若中共看到以DQ和釋法亦不能成功令民主派變35-，「佢一定會有新方法」，但當時她「睇唔到係咩方法」。何續回答法官問題：「如果中共唔做一啲《基本法》以外嘅東西嘅話，我認為民主派攞35+係 realistic 嘅，所以我都唔識答你嘅問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何料中共必定會阻民主派達35-唯一一勞永逸嘅方法就係取消選舉&quot;&gt;何料中共必定會阻民主派達35+ 「唯一一勞永逸嘅方法就係取消選舉」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beel 再追問，那看過譚耀宗訪問和戴耀廷文章，何認為「攬炒十步」是否可能實現？李運騰亦說當時是否認為中央政府會出手阻止民主派取得過半？何指「駱惠寧都預告咗啦」，並指民主派如有取得34席的可能，「佢都一定會做嘢」，但在法官追問下指立會選舉「至少地區直選嗰邊真係普選嚟嘅，個結果係冇人能夠嚴格控制嘅，就算中共D（DQ）到 Plan B、Plan C，如果香港人仍然支持嘅話，民主派依然可能攞到35+，所以唯一一勞永逸嘅方法就係取消個選舉」。李運騰指這也是何4月時的估計？何指她會同時估計很多不同情況。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問 Beel 是否已得到他的答案，如未或要再次發問。Beel 最後再問，何稱選舉前和後也會有DQ，問她是否認為35+是不可能達成？何重申只要有選舉，「中共無論點樣DQ，佢都冇辦法完全取消35+嘅可能」，但中共一定不會由他控制不到的人當選立法會主席，故必然會在選出主席前解決。李運騰無奈問 Beel 是否已得到他的答案，陳慶偉問他會否想明早再問，Beel 笑言提早休庭符合他的想法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades of sweeping industrial policies have afforded Beijing a near-total monopoly over gallium, a critical mineral used to produce high-performance microchips that power some of Washington’s most advanced military technologies. Failing to address glaring vulnerabilities in the gallium supply chain could pose serious national security and economic challenges for the U.S. and its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China produces a staggering 98 percent of the world’s supply of raw gallium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e3SaLCp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Gallium is primarily extracted from smelting bauxite into aluminum, through which trace amounts of gallium can be recovered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RuR3ZRN.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ While bauxite is abundant, its mining is heavily concentrated in a handful of countries, and Chinese companies are responsible for nearly all gallium extracted from bauxite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/vwQx7mL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ The United States and other advanced economies purchase gallium from China and refine it further for use in commercial and military applications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Dc1cMjL.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Gallium-based semiconductors are vital to the U.S. defense industry, particularly in next-generation missile defense and radar systems, as well as electronic warfare and communications equipment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ltwjrub.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ China’s stranglehold on the supply of raw gallium is a critical vulnerability for the United States and its partners — one that Beijing is poised to exploit if Washington does not take steps to limit its exposure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;galliums-revolutionary-properties&quot;&gt;Gallium’s Revolutionary Properties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique chemical and physical properties of gallium make it well suited for use in high-performance applications, such as advanced military equipment. When combined with other materials, gallium is used to produce a special class of chips, known as “wide bandgap” semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These chips can handle higher temperatures, voltages, and frequencies than conventional silicon chips, enabling them to be faster and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium chips have long powered advances in military technology. In the 1970s, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) incubated a new generation of semiconductors made from gallium arsenide (GaAs). These semiconductors helped to power advances in the U.S. Global Positioning System, precision-guided weapons, and radar, and GaAs remains widely used in many modern electronics, including smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Artist’s rendering of GaN wurtzite crystal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the development of a more advanced compound called gallium nitride (GaN) — also nurtured by DARPA — is powering new technological breakthroughs. GaN is revolutionizing modern radar, allowing new radar modules to track smaller, faster, and more numerous threats from nearly double the distance. Many of these cutting-edge radar systems are powered by several thousand gallium-enabled chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and allied armed forces are swiftly incorporating GaN-enhanced radars into critical platforms, including F-35 stealth aircraft, missile defense systems such as the Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems, and dozens of advanced naval warships. These upgrades are poised to bring about a sea change in the ability of U.S. and allied forces to defend against emerging threats like hypersonic missiles and next-generation stealth aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gallium-based chips are also increasingly vital to the commercial sector. Their efficiency and durability make them well suited for the harsh conditions of 5G base towers, as well as key green technologies like solar cells and electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of gallium is expected to grow. As continued advances in chipmaking push the limits of Moore’s Law, industry experts see gallium-based chips as a potential way to move beyond silicon. These trends are expected to drive 25 percent annual growth in the global market for GaN chips through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defense applications are expected to account for roughly half of this increase, underscoring gallium’s strategic value to U.S. and allied military modernization efforts. A top executive at Raytheon, a leading producer of GaN radar systems, noted in 2023 that “GaN is foundational to nearly all the cutting-edge defense technology that we produce.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing demand for gallium in critical industries has raised the stakes for securing a steady supply of the mineral. A sudden gallium supply shock would have consequences for defense manufacturers and broader economic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2022 analysis by experts from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) found that a 30 percent supply disruption of gallium could have cascading effects that cause a roughly $600 billion decline in U.S. economic output, or 2.1 percent of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although defense manufacturers account for only a small portion of the global end use of gallium, shortages and disruptions in the supply of semiconductors and other key electronics can pose long-term challenges for defense firms. Many of the U.S. military’s major suppliers of GaN chips also rely on revenue from substantial sales to civilian customers. Interruptions to their commercial operations may complicate their ability to meet the growing needs of the defense industry for gallium-based systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Washington and its allies have been aware of these risks for years. The USGS has included gallium on each iteration of its critical minerals list since 2018, and its most recent review of critical minerals ranked gallium number one (out of fifty) in terms of supply risks. The European Union and Japan have likewise identified gallium as a strategic raw material important for national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4IPysJt.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heightened U.S.-China tensions have further upped the ante. In 2020, the Trump administration declared U.S. critical mineral dependencies a national emergency, and the Biden administration’s 2021 100-day supply chain review warned that U.S. reliance on China for gallium risks disruptions that would have “far-reaching impacts on semiconductor production.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet government policies on critical minerals in the United States and abroad have been heavily biased toward securing access to a select group of inputs needed for emerging green technologies, such as lithium and cobalt. The lack of similar attention paid to lesser-known minerals like gallium has left government and industry leaders unprepared for the consequences of possible disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rXMw9r7.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Average Commodity Price of Gallium.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government put this vulnerability on display in early July 2023 when it announced a slate of export restrictions on gallium metal and key gallium compounds (including GaN and GaAs) in response to recently implemented export controls on advanced chips and chipmaking equipment put in place by the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands. Within the first week of the announcement, gallium prices jumped 27 percent as global traders rushed to secure their supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How exactly China will apply the new restrictions is still unclear. The move served as a shot across the bow that demonstrates Beijing’s willingness to leverage its control over critical minerals as a tool in its intensifying technological competition with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chinas-path-to-gallium-dominance&quot;&gt;China’s Path to Gallium Dominance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s control over gallium supply chains came about indirectly. Gallium is largely derived as a byproduct of processing bauxite, the primary ore for aluminum. Its production is therefore closely tied to the dynamics of global aluminum markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country’s emergence as an industrial powerhouse has driven explosive growth in its aluminum industry. Assisted by extensive government subsidies and tax incentives, China experienced a tenfold increase in aluminum production (from 4.2 to 40.2 million tons) between 2000 and 2022. Today, China supplies approximately 59 percent of the world’s aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MKbqsmb.gif&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ A bauxite offloading site in Yantai, Shandong Province of China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leading position has allowed China to establish a dominant share of global gallium production. Deliberate government policies also played a role, with Beijing requiring its booming aluminum producers to install the capacity to extract gallium. From 2005 to 2015 alone, China’s production of low-purity gallium exploded from 22 metric tons to 444 metric tons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s rapid rise in the industry created oversupply in the global market, triggering severe fluctuations in gallium prices throughout much of the 2010s. Leading suppliers in the United Kingdom, Germany, Hungary, and Kazakhstan suffered as a result and were forced to shutter their production, leaving China as virtually the only supplier in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;climbing-the-value-chain&quot;&gt;Climbing the Value Chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While holding sway over raw gallium production affords China leverage over its competitors, the country’s leaders understand that long-term advantage is won at the cutting edge of innovation. To achieve this, Beijing is actively supporting its firms in overtaking the United States and its allies to become global leaders in gallium-based semiconductor production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 14th Five Year Plan, China’s top national economic blueprint released in 2021, identifies wide bandgap semiconductors — namely GaN and another compound called silicon carbide — as a key focus area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making headway in the development of gallium-based semiconductors could offer China unique opportunities to advance its drive for technological self-sufficiency. Compared to silicon-based chips, which have existed for more than half a century, GaN semiconductors are still maturing, and new markets are emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As the semiconductor industry shifts from silicon to gallium, China is preparing to take the lead position.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China can make breakthroughs in the initial phases of GaN semiconductor development, it can potentially lock in early-mover advantages in ways similar to its success at capturing the lead in producing advanced batteries for electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese experts specializing in third-generation semiconductors have signaled that Beijing’s efforts to develop gallium chips are aimed at technologically leapfrogging the United States, Europe, and Japan. A prominent researcher at a Chinese state key laboratory asserted that “as the semiconductor industry shifts from silicon to gallium, China is preparing to take the lead position.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of Chinese efforts to acquire foreign gallium-based semiconductor technology lays bare its ambitions. Over the past decade, Chinese individuals, firms, and entities have been engaged in a systematic campaign of corporate espionage and strategic acquisitions to target GaAs and GaN technologies from companies in the United States and other advanced economies.&lt;/p&gt;

CFIUS cited concerns that China sought the firm’s GaN technology for military purposes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;2018&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice indicts two individuals for stealing confidential technologies from Wolfspeed, a leading GaN manufacturer in the United States (and a major supplier for the U.S. military). The stolen technologies were being transferred to two of the PLA’s primary centers for radar development, AVIC 607 and CETC’s 14th Research Institute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Year:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Efficient Power Conversion Corp (EPC), a major U.S. GaN firm, files a complaint in U.S. courts against Innoscience, alleging that Innoscience recruited two EPC employees for executive roles shortly before introducing a suite of products visibly identical to EPC’s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These efforts have paid dividends for China’s military modernization and exemplify Beijing’s military-civil fusion strategy, a sweeping push to fuse together the country’s security and development goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top personnel at China’s leading military radar manufacturer, China Electronics Technologies Group Corporation (CETC), claimed in 2018 to have developed state-of-the-art GaN-based radar technologies “comparable in performance to those used by the [United States’] F-22 and F-35.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more recently, in 2021 CETC released a family of next-generation GaN-backed radar systems called “Lingdong” (灵动), which it claims can easily detect stealth aircraft and cruise missiles, and in 2023, Chinese academics published a paper outlining plans for an advanced naval radar system that will likely use GaN technology. The new system will reportedly be capable of detecting targets as far away from China as Australia or Guam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KI3uvVI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image16&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ YLC-8E Radar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing momentum in commercial applications of GaN, including 5G, is reshaping market dynamics. While many American, European, and Japanese firms maintain a technological edge, several Chinese companies, empowered by financial and political support from Beijing, have emerged as key players in the production of gallium-based chips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Innoscience, a leading Chinese manufacturer of gallium-based chips, operates two of the world’s largest GaN fabrication facilities and has expanded overseas with offices in the United States, Europe, and South Korea. It has benefited from capital and partnerships from major Korean and European firms, like SK Group and ASML, while also receiving investment from AVIC Trust, the venture capital arm of China’s military aerospace giant, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Chinese firms, like Suzhou Nanowin, HiWafer, and Sanan IC, are following closely. An executive from Suzhou Nanowin boasted recently that the company had aims to capture 30 percent of the global market share for GaN substrate production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-ahead&quot;&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losing ground to Chinese firms in the race for more capable and powerful compound semiconductors will put the United States on the back foot in developing next-generation technologies that will be crucial to military power and economic competitiveness. Beijing’s active role in creating a flourishing domestic ecosystem for gallium-based chips has already benefited China’s military development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if China continues to dominate the raw supply of gallium while also achieving the leading edge of gallium-based chip production, the country can largely insulate itself from global supply chain shocks in the field. China’s recent export restrictions on gallium suggest an increased level of confidence that Beijing can inflict pain on others while limiting blowback on Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the United States met with the other leading G7 economies in May 2023, the leaders jointly called for “de-risking” from economic competitors like China. De-risking gallium supply chains offers low-hanging fruit for U.S. and allied policymakers to address together as they reassess their economic relationships with Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No country can be fully self-reliant in natural resources, and China will remain a key player in critical minerals markets. Yet by making targeted investments at home and working strategically with allies, the United States can reduce its reliance on China and de-risk critical supply chains from disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government, alongside its allies and partners, should focus its response around five measures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in gallium extraction and refinement capabilities in the United States.&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. government should make targeted investments to provide the conditions for firms to establish and maintain gallium production facilities, supported by the Department of Defense through Defense Production Act authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate with allies and partners to scale up overseas gallium extraction and refinement capacity.&lt;/strong&gt; The United States should establish partnerships or build upon existing frameworks with Germany, a former major gallium producer, and Australia, a leading bauxite ore exporter, to create conditions for scaling up gallium production.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote gallium recycling.&lt;/strong&gt; Prioritizing gallium recycling can help alleviate short-term supply chain issues, and the United States and its partners should invest in expanding existing recycling capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a minimum one-year stockpile of gallium for the defense industry.&lt;/strong&gt; The Department of Defense’s Defense Logistics Agency — in consultation with Congress — should add gallium to the National Defense Stockpile, collaborating with private industry and foreign partners to ensure at least one year’s coverage of U.S. defense needs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance data collection and transparency in U.S. gallium production and consumption.&lt;/strong&gt; Improved access to official data on more steps in the gallium supply chain would help policymakers, defense officials, and private sector actors better assess the state of the market and U.S. vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（13日）踏入審訊第85天。民協前主席施德來今接受控方盤問，指「墨落無悔」目的是推動參選人表態，感覺受壓下簽署，同意法官指聲明「騎劫」其他參選人。而施論壇稱否決財案，但最終仍會考慮預算案內容投票，遭控方質疑向公眾「講大話」，施不同意，重申否決僅談判籌碼，又信港人理性看待財案。施又表示，「攬炒」一字非戴耀廷「獨家」，不肯定其定義與戴是否相同，但施理解「攬炒」是《基本法》列明的程序，「攬炒」雙方為民主派和林鄭：民主派在否決財案和解散立會後會失去議席，但若重選後仍否決預算案原案，特首便要辭職。法官李運騰一度指第二次否決不一定是原案，惟施稱《基本法》列明是預算案原案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施同意，初選落敗後發文稱停止選舉工程和全力支持勝出者，指初選由頭到尾只有「贏輸機制」一個承諾，而支持他人是「客氣說話」。法官李運騰關注其帖文促進35+，施指落敗不參選的確有助民主派立會過半，但發帖時無此想法。法官陳慶偉並關注，施《國安法》後的帖文和論壇言論或屬「共謀者原則」下推動串謀的言行。施德來今完成4天作供，下周一將由何桂藍作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來無告知何啟明及民協-收到九東協議文件及運用否決權內容&quot;&gt;施德來無告知何啟明及民協 收到九東協議文件及運用否決權內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民協前主席施德來昨天主問完畢，今開始接受盤問。昨原表示會盤問的何啟明一方今指沒有盤問，至於代表何桂藍的大律師 Trevor Beel 則問，施是否同意區諾軒稱不同人對「攬炒」的理解都不同，施同意。Beel 續指，施昨曾稱在2020年6月談「攬炒」時，大家都會明白是兩次否決預算案爭取五大訴求；惟法官李運騰指施只是談及他認為其他人會這樣理解，陳仲衡亦指施的看法不是代表所有人。Beel 續完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;其後由主控萬德豪盤問。施表示，就5月8日收到的九東協議文件最終版本，沒有告訴何啟明和民協，指「我冇諗起過，因為嗰份係九東嘅協調」，也沒問何有否從組織者收到同一份文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施同意，協議第二點提及「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」是重要事項，但他無向何啟明提及，亦不會說該點是共識。而施5月時無反對並默許該文件，至6月「我會話我同意埋呢個內容」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱墨落逼參選人明確表態同意簽署是承諾同意被約束&quot;&gt;施稱「墨落」逼參選人明確表態、同意簽署是承諾同意被約束&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」聲明書，法官李運騰問施是否同意聲明的原意是約束（bound）簽署者。施不同意，稱認為無論「會積極運用」或「會運用」否決權都「冇綑綁性或冇一定要用嘅意思」。陳仲衡問，施宣誓提到「會說出真相（will tell the truth）」，認為「會」是什麼意思？施稱：「呢度嘅宣誓，我會認為一定要真確無虛言。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰稱施或不理解其問題，再次問聲明目的是否要約束簽署者。施回應聲明目的「就係要推動參選人做一啲表態」，即包括會運用基本法權力及落敗要停止選舉工程，並稱就後者「佢逼緊我哋要好明確表示贏咗就選、輸咗就要停止選舉工程，我當時感覺呢一個壓力（比會運用基本法權力）更加大添」。李指，故透過簽署，施是向全世界承諾他同意被約束？施同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱墨落非共識同意騎劫其他參選人-重申會跟民協決定如何投票&quot;&gt;施稱「墨落」非共識、同意騎劫其他參選人 重申會跟民協決定如何投票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續不同意控方指，「墨落」是初選參與者所達成的共識。李運騰問，所以施當時感覺被施壓（pressurised）簽署聲明？施同意，並同意如無此聲明，他會寧願不如此明確表達（explicit）其立場。施續同意，「墨落」用「會運用」比九東協調文件的「會積極運用」意思更為肯定，李運騰問，那施會認為「墨落」當時是「騎劫」其他參選人嗎？施說「同意」。鄒家成微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施強調，雖簽署了「墨落」，但「我最終對於財政預算案嘅投票決定，其實我都只會跟返民協，按財政預算案內容去做決定」。李運騰指，因此即使「墨落」比協調會議上的協議更進一步，但施當時認為有需要簽？施點頭：「我有需要去簽。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱與何啟明就墨落字眼看法不同-控方質疑一個簽一個不簽民協形象更差&quot;&gt;施稱與何啟明就「墨落」字眼看法不同 控方質疑一個簽一個不簽民協形象更差&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就民協對「墨落」的討論，施指何啟明於民協黨團 WhatsApp 群組曾談及對聲明字眼看法，如「包括」不等於一定包含；而施的看法與何不同，但沒有指出，印象中他和何也無於群組表明會否簽署，亦無就是否簽署討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民協最終決定由參選人自行決定是否簽署。萬德豪指，施稱民協予人弱勢騎牆的感覺，若屆時一個簽、一個無簽，形象不是更差？李運騰亦指會造成奇怪（awkward）的情況。施指「會令人好困惑」，但「最終冇發生，亦都冇處理到」。李追問，施和何當時是冒着會有不同決定的風險？施稱「嗰刻冇特別諗呀」。施續指，他與何啟明均於6月10日晚至11日早上由民協同事幫忙聯絡聲明發起人簽署。根據聲明，施的名字在何之上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱論壇前無告知何啟明或民協發言內容&quot;&gt;施稱論壇前無告知何啟明或民協發言內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦質疑施德來的論壇發言。就施於6月26日初選論壇稱「今日嘅民協入到議會裏面，我哋一定會兩次否決《財政預算案》」，施稱事前有與助選團隊討論會提否決財案爭取五大訴求，但實際論壇上「用咩字眼或者點樣講法，係我臨場一啲決定」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡指，但施發言時是提及「我哋」，而民協除施以外唯一能進入議會的只有何啟明。施同意，指「嗰刻都係諗緊民協整體嘅印象」，故想一些進取言論改變民協，但他無告訴何或黨他會這樣說。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施否認當選後不無差別否決財案是講大話-強調否決為籌碼盡力向林鄭爭取&quot;&gt;施否認當選後不無差別否決財案是「講大話」 強調否決為籌碼、盡力向林鄭爭取&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續在6月29日於Facebook發布一段選舉論壇的片段，提及「希望大家睇完之後可以見到一個全新嘅民協」，施指發文前沒有與黨友討論，重申是刻意令民協形象顯得進取。李運騰問，看到帖文的人會認為民協比起以前很不同？施同意，重申民協以往予人怯懦、弱勢，「甚至唔係民主派嘅感覺。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪其後指，施德來不僅是想顯得「進取」（progressive），而是「激進」（aggressive），施稱「我會用『進取』呢個形容詞」。萬問否決預算案兩次不激進？施重申認為是「進取」。萬續指，施稱當選後不會無差別否決預算案，所以在論壇上是對公眾「講大話」。施說「唔係大話，爭取五大訴求係我嘅目標」，並指否決預算案兩次是談判策略和爭取的籌碼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，但施曾說會兩次否決預算案，若選民從其字面意思相信他會這樣做，就會被誤導（mistaken）？施回應，「我覺得香港人要嘅係爭取五大訴求，唔係要否決財政預算案」，強調否決財案是談判策略和籌碼；亦不同意當選後所做的會與他所說的相違，指他會約林鄭商討，「爭取五大訴求同民生政策我都會同佢傾。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱代表得民協參選均重視民生不用問何啟明也知他不會無差別否決&quot;&gt;施稱「代表得民協參選」均重視民生、不用問何啟明也知他不會無差別否決&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬質疑，若施沒有遵守論壇的承諾，對民協形象和何啟明會有壞影響，施同意「會有影響」，但「要具體睇吓點樣」，又重申「我一直講嘅承諾係爭取五大訴求」、「我會盡力同林鄭去傾去爭取」。陳慶偉問，若林鄭拒絕就五大訴求磋商，施會怎樣？施重申預算案出台後要視乎民協重視的民生需要，「睇返個會嘅宗旨去做投票決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施盤問下指，何啟明沒告訴他不會無差別否決預算案爭五大訴求，二人亦無就此討論，但「我相信代表得民協參選嘅都係重視民生，所以我唔使問佢我都知佢不會不予差別去否決財政預算案」。施亦同意，沒有向初選組織者、「墨落無悔」聲明發起者和簽署者、及公眾表示他不會運用否決權爭取五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑民協顯得進取會失原有支持者-施稱市民對政府不滿忠實支持者會理解&quot;&gt;官質疑民協顯得進取會失原有支持者 施稱市民對政府不滿、忠實支持者會理解&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就施在7月4日的地區論壇稱「我哋仲要有一個精神去攬炒呢個林鄭、攬炒呢個政府，特別係否決兩次財政預算案」，施稱事前亦無與民協討論，並同意民協是溫和的政黨。萬德豪追問，看到論壇的人會認為民協溫和的立場有改變？陳慶偉亦問選舉後民協是否便會回復原來溫和的光譜。施表示「民協嘅立場信念一直不變」，重申用選舉語言「係想畀公眾覺得進取咗啫」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指，施會爭取到較激進選民的選票，但同時也會失去原有支持者的選票。施回應最後也是選情和選舉策略的評估，陳問即是評估「賺多過蝕」？施稱是按當時民情和市民對政府的不滿。李運騰指若其評估正確，則民協當選後仍要繼續保持激進，以保留或吸引更多支持者。施回應支持者有兩種，一種是「一般嘅泛民主派支持者」，另一種是「民協嘅忠實支持者」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑當選後回復溫和會失進取支持者-施稱信港人理性財案對港重要&quot;&gt;官質疑當選後回復溫和會失進取支持者 施稱信港人理性、財案對港重要&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續問，那若忠實支持者看到施在論壇說的話，會認為民協溫和的立場不復存在？施指不會用「不復存在」，但是「顯得進取咗」，並指配合當時民情，若民協入議會後「當我哋按住民生需要嚟做決定（預算案投票）嗰一刻，民協嘅忠實支持者係會理解」。陳慶偉指忠實支持者當然理解，但民協2016年失去議席，若能再進入議會是靠較進取的支持者，但施這樣做便會失去該些支持者，所以施只是當選一屆議員便滿意？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施說「唔可以咁講，因為我相信香港人都會有一定嘅理性，財政預算案對香港整體都重要」。李運騰指，若他認為選民理性，為何又要於選舉用政治語言，施重申當時因選舉需要，在民主派顯得較進取所分到的「餅」會較大。陳慶偉問，施想分走人民力量的那塊餅？陳慶偉又說「你看譚得志很激進，他在選舉論壇講粗口，所以你想搶走他的選民？」，陳志全等發笑。施說「我攞唔到佢嗰啲票」，指民主黨胡志偉的票「會相近啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施重申攬炒指立會議員與林鄭攬炒解釋為基本法程序&quot;&gt;施重申「攬炒」指立會議員與林鄭「攬炒」、解釋為《基本法》程序&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方亦問及「攬炒」。施德來表示有讀過戴耀廷4月28日〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉一文，但其他有關「攬炒」的文章則無讀過。萬德豪引另外3篇文章，戴提及「攬炒」是否決預算案致立會解散和辭職，迫使政府回應五大訴求，問施提「攬炒」的意思是否與戴一樣。施答「不同」，萬即反問否決預算案兩次不是「攬炒」？施表示「否決財政預算案兩次係《基本法》第50到53條程序」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指施沒讀過戴其他文章，如何能說其理解與戴不同。施說「『攬炒』呢個字唔係戴耀廷獨家嘅」，但在法官澄清下更正他不知道其定義與戴是否一樣。陳慶偉續問施「攬炒」的定義，施解釋若民主派取得立法會過半，第一次否決預算案後，如林鄭決定解散立法會，「攬炒」一方的民主派議員就會失去立法會議席，所有議員需要重選，而中間有半年時間「無糧出、要請職員搞選舉，已經有好大損失喇」，因通常每一位參選人選舉要用過百萬。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施再指，另一方「攬炒」對象是林鄭月娥，若民主派在重選的立會能過半，而林鄭提出同一份預算案的原案再被否決，就要按《基本法》第52條辭職。李運騰說不一定是原案，可以是任何預算案，惟施答：「根據《基本法》第52條係寫明，係財政預算案嘅原案」，李說「Alright, I see.」，何桂藍發笑。陳慶偉說，「所以你是說你對『攬炒』的定義是由《基本法》所賦予（provided by Basic Law）？」施說：「我會講係50到53條嘅程序，個雙方係民主派議員同林鄭。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱無興趣知戴耀廷有否秘密議程我淨係為民協去諗&quot;&gt;施稱無興趣知戴耀廷有否秘密議程：我淨係為民協去諗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施在盤問下，稱無興趣知道戴耀廷就初選的政治意見，在讀〈真攬炒十步〉一文後亦沒有想知道更多關於戴對攬炒的看法和計劃。李運騰問，施不想知道戴有否任何秘密議程（secret agenda）？施答：「我唔會想知，我淨係為民協去諗㗎啫。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱初選只有贏輸機制一個承諾全力支持出選名單為客氣說話&quot;&gt;施稱初選只有「贏輸機制」一個承諾、全力支持出選名單為「客氣說話」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示施於初選投票日後、於7月13日發布的 Facebook 帖文，施感謝初選組織者和支持者，並恭喜其他參選人，又指「希望大眾能重新認識『進化』左嘅民協」。陳慶偉關注，施提及「我同民協都跟從初選協調及承諾，我會停止選舉工程」，是否「墨落」、協調文件和共同綱領的共識和承諾，施同意，並指他一直覺得所有協調會議的承諾「都係講緊贏就選，輸咗就唔好選」，指「由頭到尾都係得一個承諾，就係講贏輸機制」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，但施在該句後也有寫「並全力支持出選名單」，施指「呢一句係客氣說話，就算不同黨派輸咗有時都會恭賀其他贏嘅對手，當然佢哋都係民主派啦」，陳志全和法官陳慶偉等發笑。李問，故施無意支持其他勝出者？施說「如果我有時間我會協助民協多啲」，又指「我嗰刻冇特別諗法，亦都冇實際行為做過，佢哋都冇搵我，可能我低票得濟啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問帖文是否推動促進35-施同意有助增勝算惟發文時僅想好睇啲&quot;&gt;官問帖文是否推動促進35+ 施同意有助增勝算惟發文時僅想「好睇啲」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再追問施是否會支持這些「同路人」，施指帖文只是感謝文，「想顯得好睇」，而對其支持者會轉投其他人「我都相信呢個自然會發生嘅」。李指即使施沒有做其他事，但透過發文亦某程度上幫助了其他參選人，施說「可能有，雖然下面得234個 likes」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問，那施認為帖文是推動和促進35+計劃的目的嗎？施同意「輸咗我唔去選」是有助民主派過半的勝算增加，「即使我得九百幾票都好」；不過他發文時無此想法，「純粹睇吓我點樣寫得好睇啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施重申不認為有犯國安法風險如果有嘅話我停止咗喇&quot;&gt;施重申不認為有犯《國安法》風險：如果有嘅話，我停止咗喇&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李續關注，帖文引述施7月12日的《蘋果日報》訪問，施強調「初選並非一場為個別黨派、個別候選人的選戰，而是一場『香港人一齊打嘅仗』。他預計中共打壓無窮無盡，『（如）由參選到投票都隨時被人話係犯《國安法》』。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問，施昨稱當時相信戴耀廷和趙家賢指初選合法，認為自己不違法，但《國安法》後受訪卻提及犯法的風險，而且不止是施一人，而是「由參選到投票」的人都會。施解釋該句源於時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞的訪問，但認為《蘋果日報》不是引述得很準確，因即使曾國衞亦無說投票者犯法；又指其意思「唔係真係話有犯《國安法》風險」，而是「隨時畀人話犯《國安法》」，他有用選舉語言，製造「壓迫感」和「緊張感」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡即指，是施自己引述該段訪問內容，如果他不滿意報導內容就不會用，又問施為何要怪罪《蘋果日報》？還是他忘了自己發帖了？施表示「唔好意思」稱剛才「講得唔好」，承認「帖文是由我本人貼嘅」。李運騰追問，那施當時有懷疑他所做的事有風險嗎？施答：「沒有，如果有嘅話，我停止咗喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來完成4日作供-下周一將由何桂藍作供&quot;&gt;施德來完成4日作供 下周一將由何桂藍作供&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後指，施德來與其他被告串謀無差別否決預算案，迫使政府回應五大訴求，意圖顛覆國家政權，施一律不同意。控方表示完成盤問，辯方大律師黃廷光沒有覆問。法官陳慶偉向施德來指他可離開，施朝法官方向鞠躬並說：「好，感謝法官」，並拿着背包返回被告欄。原擬傳召另一名事實證人的黃廷光，休庭約20分鐘後稱不會傳召另一名證人，施德來案情完結。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;九東案情完結，將由參選新東的前《立場新聞》記者何桂藍作供。代表何的大律師 Trevor Beel 表示，雖之前說主問需時2天，但早前有被告主問超出2日，估計現時或需3天才能完成，並以左手持着一疊A4紙晃動，說：「有那麼多。（“It’s about that much.”）」李運騰問，這是供詞？Beel說是他要問的問題，李笑着提議4天。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/GolbRnb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明休庭一天，下周一續審，何桂藍將作供。現時16名不認罪被告中，8人已完成辯方案情，分別是發起「三投三不投」的吳政亨，以及來自香港島、九龍西及九龍東的參選人。現餘下新界東、超級區議會及衞生服務界的8人，當中7人早前表示擬作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官兩度稱施國安法後言論或可納入共謀者原則&quot;&gt;官兩度稱施《國安法》後言論或可納入「共謀者原則」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，法官陳慶偉今兩度提及「共謀者原則」，其中問及施德來7月4日論壇的發言「我哋仲要有一個精神去攬炒呢個林鄭、攬炒呢個政府，特別係否決兩次財政預算案」，陳指施是於《國安法》生效後發言，若達成引用「共謀者原則」的條件，其發言或可被視為推動串謀的言論，又指目前只是抛出問題，雙方或可以考慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就施7月13日的 Facebook 帖文，陳亦指在「共謀者原則」下也可能有比重，着各方謹記。法庭早前裁定，「共謀者原則」適用於《國安法》後的言行，意味共謀者的言行可用來指證所有被告。&lt;/p&gt;

The event is part of the Supervising and Monitoring Ukraine’s Reconstruction Funds (SMURF) Project, a CFCS-led initiative in partnership with BRDO in Ukraine. SMURF aims to empower Ukraine’s “second line of defence”, civil society, to gather the expertise and tools that will enable it to monitor the proper allocation of funds and discourage kleptocracy and corruption. The project was launched in November 2022 and is supported by the NED.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference gathered over 170 leading voices, in person and online. It included participants from the finance sector as well as representatives from civil society and high-profile Ukrainian, UK and EU policymakers. There were two main panel events, seven one-on-one discussions and two presentations. This report summarises the main findings of the discussions related to the integrity and resilience of Ukraine’s financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conference-overview&quot;&gt;Conference Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event aimed to address an issue that was absent from the wider Ukraine Recovery Conference agenda discussions related to reconstruction, namely the importance of integrity and resilience in Ukraine’s financial system to combat potential corruption-related money laundering connected with the flow of reconstruction funding. Addressing the specific weaknesses identified across public and private sectors at the national level, the event created an opportunity to demonstrate the progress, impact and effectiveness of the ongoing efforts in Ukraine by civil society, the banking system and government to ensure the integrity and resilience of the financial system in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first panel session, entitled “Promoting Financial Integrity and Resilience in Ukraine Reconstruction”, focused on the policy responses and the role of international donors and the Ukrainian public and private sectors. The debate addressed the issue of how the international community and Ukrainian policymakers see each other’s roles in implementing fundamental reforms for Ukraine’s recovery and further integration into the EU. There was a consensus among speakers on the important role of the global anti-financial crime watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and the FATF-style regional body to which Ukraine belongs, MONEYVAL, in supporting the integrity and resilience of the financial system in Ukraine in the face of financial abuse. It was noted that MONEYVAL’s report from 2017 needs to be urgently updated. However, most participants agreed that much work remains to be done inside Ukraine to ensure the financial system has the necessary integrity and resilience to effectively implement Ukraine’s recovery project. Among the challenges identified, both public and private sector representatives pointed to the restriction of access to state electronic registers and non-transparent spending of public and donor funds in Ukraine. As one of the solutions, digitalisation was named as an element that will play a critical role in promoting transparency and protecting public procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second panel of the conference, entitled “Perspectives from Civil Society”, included several insightful discussions on the role of the banking sector and civil society to make the recovery process transparent. The panellists agreed that the integrity of the financial system depends on the synergy of public, private and civil society sectors, and reforms must embrace all three of these groups. There was broad consensus on the need to actively involve civil society in financial risk assessments at the same level as other sectors and ensure a productive dialogue among these three groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one-on-one conversations with members of the UK and Ukrainian Parliaments, representatives of the National Bank of Ukraine, National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) and civil society organisations offered an opportunity to deep dive into specific topics related to: the particular challenges Russia poses to the integrity of the global financial system; open data and access to open electronic registers; international perspectives on Ukraine’s financial integrity and resilience; the FATF’s capacity to respond to the threats posed by its members to the integrity of the global financial system; the current state of Ukraine’s banking system; and engagement of civil society in the recovery process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, the conference also provided the occasion to demonstrate the latest developments in ensuring integrity in the management of reconstruction funds which have become possible thanks to the launch of the Digital Restoration Ecosystem for Accountable Management (DREAM) that was showcased to the audience. By using a single data exchange standard, the ecosystem aims to implement open interaction between all components. DREAM could become not only a control tool, mitigating corruption risks but will also help to improve the quality of projects by ensuring they consider inclusivity, energy efficiency and other important factors that embrace sustainability and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-identified&quot;&gt;Challenges Identified&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the challenges to the global financial system, there was strong consensus that Russia poses a key challenge to the integrity of the international financial system given the extent to which – as reiterated that very week by the FATF – it is engaging in terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation activities. Therefore, the discussion focused on available instruments to address these activities. Blacklisting Russia by the FATF was regarded as one such instrument. According to one of the participants, a consolidated position of the international community is necessary to confront Russia’s threat to the integrity of the global financial system and force it to abandon gross violations of international norms and FATF standards. The FATF has the mandate to impose penalties on Russia, namely by adding the country to its blacklist, which in itself can be seen as an incentive, rather than as a “punishment”, for the affected country to take the necessary measures to eliminate its shortcomings and formally alert the global community to the threats Russia poses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the challenges to Ukraine’s financial system, participants from both public and private sectors also voiced concerns over access to open data. First, under the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated 6 March 2022 No. 209, access to most registers crucial for economic activity, such as the business register, has been closed. This complicates the work of authorities, businesses and public organisations; endangers transparent and accountable reconstruction; and reduces the trust of international partners. Second, unified state registers are still not fully systemised, there is a lack of validation and interoperability of datasets, and there is no control over data quality to prevent the entry of unreliable information. Consolidated efforts of the government, parliament, the National Bank of Ukraine, the judicial system, civil society and business are needed to tackle this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most participants also acknowledged that the further exemption from the obligation to submit e-declarations on the income and property of persons authorised to perform the functions of the state or local self-government, introduced in March 2022, poses a serious challenge for further monitoring of the recovery process. The weakening of responsibility for non-submission or inauthenticity of e-declarations during the recovery process may become a serious obstacle in monitoring the allocation of funds aimed at Ukraine’s reconstruction. Both representatives of Ukrainian civil society and foreign experts expressed solidarity with the idea of restoring e-declarations submitted by public officials in Ukraine as well as reinforcing the powers of the NACP to control and verify these declarations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important issue in ensuring the integrity of Ukraine’s financial system is the institutional capacity of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office and other institutions to expose money laundering schemes and corrupt activities, in particular to ensure effective fulfilment and compliance with the 2022 anti-corruption requirements related to Ukraine’s EU candidacy status. Some participants also raised concerns about the effectiveness of the Bureau of Economic Security (BES) of Ukraine, established in 2021, and entrusted with the task of identifying and countering internal and external threats to economic security in Ukraine. The non-transparent appointment of the BES head, a former tax police officer prone to political influence, resulted in the selection of BES employees with multiple violations of procedure, understaffing and undertraining, and lack of will and skills to systematically address the largest economic crime schemes to make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A separate topic was the question of who should pay for Ukraine’s recovery. According to a representative of Ukraine’s public sector, the crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine should be paid for not by European or American taxpayers, but by Russia itself and its oligarchs. So far, only three countries – the US, Canada and Ukraine – have implemented a legal regime for seizure, forfeiture and transfer for the needs of Ukraine of assets held by a foreign state, individuals and entities that are sanctioned by these states in response to the Russian war against Ukraine. The Ukrainian speakers expressed concerns that the reluctance of other countries, including the UK, to follow the same example and introduce relevant legislation to make Russia pay for the damages in Ukraine, might impede not only Ukraine’s recovery but also the whole idea of the rule of law. The introduction of the relevant legal framework to enable the seizure of assets subject to sanctions would send a powerful signal to the aggressor and the international community about the inevitability of paying Ukraine compensation for the damage caused by the Russian invasion, as well as to other states that might contemplate such unprovoked aggression in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was less agreement among participants on whether it is feasible or appropriate to restore a lifetime status for politically exposed persons (PEPs) in Ukraine. According to the latest legislative amendments, adopted at the end of 2022, financial monitoring of PEPs is limited to a three-year period. While some speakers stressed that a robust PEP screening process is critical and necessary to be in place with no time limitation, others pointed out the practice common in many countries of the world, where the status of PEPs is not lifelong and the maximum period during which financial institutions are required to conduct controls is 7 or 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision adopted by Ukraine’s Parliament, first in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and then to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, to pause the requirement for parties to submit their financial reports to the NACP poses another challenge to the financial system of Ukraine as it undermines its transparency and proper oversight of the financial activities of elites. Restoration of political party finance reporting and oversight by the NACP was named by representatives of civil society as vitally important for ensuring financial and political integrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges give rise to major concerns for representatives from both public and private sectors, namely how to ensure transparency and accountability in the distribution and use of funds directed to Ukraine’s reconstruction. With these concerns in mind, participants coalesced around the following recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their commitment to overcome the identified challenges, participants put forth a series of recommendations that could become guiding points for all stakeholders involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure full and open access to data:&lt;/strong&gt; this is a critical element in guaranteeing transparency and accountability in the distribution and use of funds directed to Ukraine’s reconstruction. This will include not only opening access to as much public data as possible but also the systematisation of unified electronic registers, restoring the commitment to submit electronic declarations by public officials in Ukraine, and ensuring sharing of information among state authorities and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build illicit finance expertise and capacity:&lt;/strong&gt; there is a strong need for building the capacity of not only public institutions responsible for addressing illicit finance but also non-governmental organisations, media and independent experts. This community should be trained to conduct in-depth investigations, engage effectively with policymakers to propose legislative and policy enhancements, analyse thoroughly the economic feasibility of decisions made at the local and national level by public authorities, and oversee compliance both with the needs of communities at the local level and international standards and accepted best practice at the macro level. A more systematic and comprehensive approach in the work of investigative journalists and civil society addressing not only corruption but also other financial crimes, such as fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, market abuse and tax evasion, is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raise international awareness of Ukraine’s progress:&lt;/strong&gt; it is crucial to make sure that international financial institutions (IFIs), the foreign private sector and donor governments have an up-to-date understanding of all the progress and achievements made by Ukraine to ensure the integrity and resilience of its financial system. The decision whether to invest or not in Ukraine should not be made based on outdated assessments such as the 2017 MONEYVAL Mutual Evaluation Report on Ukraine. Such outdated information should be urgently refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure legislative predictability and stability:&lt;/strong&gt; there is great demand for predictability among foreign investors as constant changes in regulation and legislation do not encourage a business-friendly environment. Rather than only prioritising the introduction of changes, IFIs and Ukrainian authorities should focus more on fostering regulatory certainty and predictability, to enable the development and growth of private business in general and of international investment operations in particular. It is not only important to focus on the areas that need change but to also identify those that can offer more stability and, as a result, more reliable incremental gains on investments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, participants argued that to achieve greater transparency and accountability in the distribution and use of funds directed to Ukraine’s reconstruction, the Ukrainian government, domestic private sector, civil society as well as foreign investors and donors should work harder together, to strengthen the integrity of financial system oversight, supervision and enforcement. In turn, this should secure the financial commitments Ukraine needs for its recovery and reconstruction, and to ensure the long-term sustainability of Ukraine’s vibrant democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber operations will play a supporting rather than decisive role in major theater wars.&lt;/strong&gt; Great powers will continue to invest in cyber capabilities but see diminishing returns on these investments outside of intelligence and deception efforts once major conflict breaks out. &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War will still be a continuation of politics by other means and rely on the more tangible effects of violence than on the elusive effects of compromising information networks.&lt;/strong&gt; During the transition to warfighting, military commanders will prefer the certainty of lethal precision strikes against high-value targets to the uncertainty of generating effects in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The merits of cyber operations continue to be their utility as a tool of political warfare because they facilitate an engagement short of war that leverages covert action, propaganda, and surveillance but in a manner that poses a fundamental threat to human liberties.&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber operations will remain a limited tool of coercion. Due to their uncertain effects, military leaders will initiate fewer critical cyber operations against command and control and military targets than currently anticipated. They will also face fewer restrictions on waging information warfare to mobilize and shape discontent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How central are cyber operations to combined arms campaigns in the twenty-first century? Between the spring of 2021 and winter of 2022, Russian military forces began to mass combat troops along Ukraine’s eastern border. On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. It marked the fourth time Russia used military force against a neighbor since the end of the Cold War and the seventh time Russia used cyber operations as part of a larger campaign or independently as an instrument of coercion against a neighboring state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pundits and academics alike came out with grand predictions about a coming cyber war. Researchers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) even argued during the war that “Russian cyberattacks on government and military command and control centers, logistics, emergency services … were entirely consistent with a so-called thunder run strategy intended to stoke chaos, confusion, and uncertainty, and ultimately avoid a costly and protracted war in Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;This edition of the On Future War series uses an empirical analysis of attributed Russian cyber operations in Ukraine to extrapolate future scenarios for the use of cyber operations in major theater wars below the nuclear threshold. The best predictions about an uncertain future come from analysis of past attack patterns and trends as well as seminal cases — such as Ukraine — that are almost certain to change the character of war. Reference the Statistical Appendix for more information.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Into the war’s second year, Russia remains locked in a protracted conventional conflict that, in addition to pitched battles and missile strikes, has seen sabotage, forced displacement and kidnapping of children, systematic rape and torture, and threats to use nuclear weapons. Yet, Russia has not launched an all-out, costly cyberwar against Ukraine or its backers in the West. The so-called “thunder run” never materialized. Rather, a mix of Ukrainian determination, the characteristics of the cyber domain, and a Russian preference for waging a global campaign focused more on misinformation and undermining support for Kyiv appear to have taken its place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This installment of &lt;em&gt;On Future War&lt;/em&gt; analyzes Russian cyber operations linked to the war in Ukraine. This study uses the publicly attributed record of Russian cyber operations in Ukraine to extrapolate insights about the character of cyber operations as instruments of warfighting and coercion in the twenty-first century. The empirical evidence demonstrates that while there has been an uptick in cyberattacks during the conflict, these attacks did not demonstrate an increase in severity, a shift in targets, or a shift in methods. Despite proclamations of doom, gloom, and a revolution in warfare, Russia behaved in a manner contrary to most popular expectations during the conflict. While cyber-enabled targeting at the tactical level is almost certain to occur alongside signals intelligence — a practice first documented in Ukraine in 2016 — the prevailing trends suggest cyber operations have yet to make a material impact on the battlefield. Where Russian cyber operations have made a difference is in their support to information operations and propaganda in the Global South, where Moscow has successfully spread disinformation to undermine support to Ukraine. Similar to earlier academic treatments that find cyber operations play a key role in shaping intelligence, deception, and political warfare, the Ukrainian case illustrates that the digital domain plays a shaping rather than decisive role even during extensive and existential combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to casting doubt on the cyber thunder run, the empirical record, especially when compared to previous Russian cyber operations, offers a baseline prediction about the future and how states will integrate cyber operations into a spectrum of conflict ranging from crises to major wars. While the system could evolve and cyber operations might prove to be decisive instruments of war in the future, the record to date suggests alternatives for how this technology will be leveraged on the battlefield. Specifically, integrating the empirical record of cyber operations in Ukraine alongside well-established findings from the quantitative study of war suggests three scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Stalemate:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia struggles to integrate cyber and conventional effects on the battlefield and beyond due to the resilience of cyber defense as well as the power of public-private partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War Comes Home:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia regroups and launches a wave of cyberattacks against critical U.S. infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Lies:&lt;/strong&gt; Russian cyber-enabled influence operations and computational propaganda degrade support for the United States and the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking across these scenarios suggests key policy options — each consistent with active campaigning and integrated deterrence — the Biden administration could take over the next two years to shape what will likely be a long-term competition with Russia that extends deeper into the twenty-first century. Over time it has become clear that resilience and a focus on defensive operations can forestall the potential impact of offensive cyber operations. Defense in cyberspace requires expanding public-private partnerships and collaboration alongside pooled data to identify attack patterns and trends. Last, the United States and its partners will need to develop better ways and means for countering how malign actors such as Russia use cyberspace to distort global public opinion. For every failed network intrusion, there are thousands of successful social media posts skewing how the world looks at the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;making-sense-of-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;Making Sense of Cyber Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. joint doctrine defines cyberspace operations as the “employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in and through cyberspace.” Cyberspace is further defined as an “interdependent network of information technology (IT) infrastructures and resident data. It includes the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a military perspective, groups seek to defend their networks while infiltrating other networks through the different layers of cyberspace (i.e., physical, logical, and persona). As a result, network access is turned into an intelligence advantage or means of delivering effects, creating unique “use-lose” trade-offs in cyber operations. Disrupting or degrading adversary networks risks losing intelligence access. In addition, the dual effort to gain and exploit access does not take place on a battlefield but often in commercial systems and networks, creating unique dilemmas as patches and updates can dislodge or distort cyber payloads. Last, many cyber operations rely on similar tactics, techniques, and procedures, meaning that compromising one operation can result in a cascading effect compromising other operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cyber operations, by design, tend to be concealed, with cyber operators often masking their intrusions and identities by routing payloads through third-party servers, it is possible to analyze how state and non-state actors use cyberspace to advance their interests. Academics, governments, and threat intelligence firms have been cataloging cyber operations for over 20 years. This treatment follows academic research and employs a systematic coding standard as opposed to simple lists that avoid peer review and replication. The underlying assumption about external validity is that documented cyber incidents and associated campaigns are representative of the larger universe of cyber incidents that are unseen or unreported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, cyber operations are a method to enable a decisive advantage, creating an easy path to victory. As Josh Rovner, associate professor at the School of International Service at American University, notes, “For policymakers and planners, cyberspace operations suggest a low-cost route to quick and decisive victories.” This idea is developed most clearly in Jan Kallberg’s theory of decisive cyber operations. Kallberg, a former research scientist with the Army Cyber Institute at West Point, argues that “the decisive cyber outcome is either reached by removing military capacity through cyber attacks or destabilization of the targeted society.” The idea is to trigger a “dormant entropy embedded in a nation possessing weak institutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/3qx7zuz.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 1: Common Cyber Myths&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many visions of decisive cyber victory emerge from the idea that cyber warfare represents a revolution in war and military affairs. Amit Sharma, formerly of India’s Ministry of Defence, note, “Cyber warfare … is a warfare which is capable of compelling the enemy to your will by inducing strategic paralysis to achieve desired ends and this seizing of the enemy is done almost without any application of physical force.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Rattray, former director of cybersecurity for the White House, offered that “successful integration of information systems in a sophisticated conventional force capability proved decisive during the spectacular U.S. military successes in the Gulf War.” But he also further cautioned that challenges, including expertise for targeted attacks, the difficulty in assessing the political consequences for information disruption, and defensive coordination challenges, would hamper the ability of information warfare to be effective in generating effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applied to Ukraine, the vision of decisive cyber victory imagined Russian network intrusions extending beyond battlefield objectives to undermine confidence in Kyiv. Kallberg’s original theory focused on weak states where “cyber targeting can induce a sense of lack of control with citizens blaming the state for failing to safe-guard the societal structure.” In many ways, this was the vision Russia had of Ukraine, seeing a quick war as sufficient to destabilize the government and lead to a general collapse, leaving Moscow in control of the country. Keith Alexander, former director of the National Security Agency (NSA) and U.S. Cyber Command, noted “a cyber attack — which is relatively easy and comparatively cheap — is likely to top that list. As Russia showed during the 2008 Georgia conflict, hacking government systems as well as financial and energy sectors can cause chaos.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO analysts David Cattler and Daniel Black point to cyber operations as “Russia’s biggest military success to date in the war in Ukraine.” Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, goes so far as to argue that conventional operations would not even be needed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It is hard to see how rolling tanks across the border would serve Russia’s aims when far cheaper and more controllable options exist for inflicting damage on Ukraine. … Stand-off strikes using missiles, or potentially a destructive cyber onslaught, could target military command and control systems or civilian critical infrastructure and pressure Kyiv into concessions and its friends aboard into meeting Russia’s demands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic is reminiscent of airpower theorists in the interwar period who believed bombers would destroy cities, forcing citizens to pressure their governments into surrendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending the idea to Ukraine’s foreign backers, Jason Healey, a senior research scholar at Columbia University, notes that another SolarWinds-style attack on the United States would be a “psychological shock to the public and to decision-makers” and “might successfully coerce the United States into backing down.” Fear that Russia would escalate and expand the conflict to the United States through cyber means motivated the desire for many to remain neutral, or to at least have “shields up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars working at the intersection of international security and disruptive technology generally reject the idea of a decisive victory in cyberspace. Academics such as Nadiya Kostyuk and Erik Gartzke note that Russian cyber operations “have neither supplanted nor significantly supplemented conventional combat activities.” Others state, “We are less convinced of effective Russian or Ukrainian battlefield cyber action.” Earlier researchers noted that “despite increasingly sophisticated operations, between 2000 and 2016 cyberspace was a domain defined by political warfare and covert signaling to control escalation more than it was an arena of decisive action.” Instead, cyber operations generally represent covert or deception operations seeking to coerce or signal to the adversary. Often linked to intelligence, cyber operations act more like complementary activities in war than singularly decisive instruments. Like combined arms, cyber operations work best when integrated with other effects to create multiple dilemmas for an adversary. This logic implies that Russian cyber operations in Ukraine were likely restrained by the character of cyberspace and its strategic logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the possibility that cyber operations are more defensive rather than offensive. The majority of code, computer equipment, and network infrastructure in the world is owned and operated by private companies. These companies spend billions of dollars monitoring their networks. A mix of nonprofits and academics constantly search for bugs and update companies about deficiencies. This unique feature of cyber competition means that even the best laid plans are often undone by the ecosystem of firms and citizens seeking to secure cyberspace. In addition, the human capital and costs required to develop high-end cyber effects can constrain their use. Work by the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission highlighted this dynamic and encouraged building layers in national cyber strategy to deny easy access and change the costs adversaries expect to pay to attack U.S. interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russian-cyber-operations&quot;&gt;Russian Cyber Operations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-cases&quot;&gt;Historical Cases&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the history of Russian cyber operations, the Kremlin employs cyber means to engage in long-term competition with rivals. Before 2014, Moscow’s campaigns tended to focus on political warfare and espionage. Operations in Estonia and Georgia were the most prominent. Massive denial-of-service operations sought to punish Estonia in 2007 after the country moved the Russian monument known as the Bronze Soldier. During the Russo-Georgian conflict of 2008, Russia leveraged cyberattacks to enable information operations (IO) against Georgia. Russian’s IO operations aimed “to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision-making of adversaries and potential adversaries while protecting [their] own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a harbinger of its military campaign to destroy Ukrainian critical infrastructure, Moscow also used cyber operations to target Kyiv’s power supply. Following the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, advanced persistent threat (APT) groups such as Sandworm were implicated in the 2015 BlackEnergy campaign targeting Ukrainian power generation and distribution. While the attacks captured headlines, they produced limited effects. In 2017, Russian-linked groups launched the NotPetya campaign, which produced effects that spilled over from the intended targets, Ukrainian companies, to affect global logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also used cyber operations as a form of political warfare, using a mix of propaganda to polarize societies and influence political elections. Of note, these efforts included parallel disruption campaigns seeking to deface websites and portray supporters for Ukraine as Nazis. This campaign was followed by the even more audacious attempt to undermine confidence in U.S. democracy through the 2016 operations targeting the presidential election, where the effects are still debated. In 2018, U.S. Cyber Command used Russia’s past behavior as well as other indicators and warnings that Moscow was about to repeat its efforts as justification for launching a preemptive operation against the Internet Research Agency, a Russian propaganda and influence operation firm, designed to forestall attacks during the midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, Russian operations have combined a mix of sophisticated espionage and criminal malware campaigns. For most of 2020, the Russian hacking group APT29, or Cozy Bear, exploited a supply chain vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion program to exfiltrate data and digital tools from an extensive list of targets. The operation raised alarm bells since neither the NSA nor major firms such as Microsoft detected the intrusion and because it likely involved a combination of human intelligence and cyber operations to insert malicious code deep into servers. In 2021, criminal actors known as DarkSide, likely linked to the Russian state, were successful in deploying ransomware against Colonial Pipeline, the system that moves much of the fuel used across the United States’ East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;empirical-analysis&quot;&gt;Empirical Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These high-profile examples parallel the prevailing empirical pattern of Russian cyber operations between 2000 and 2020. The latest version of the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Campaign Data (DCID 2.0) extends the timeline of the dataset and adds new variables, including ransomware and information operations. The dataset codes cyber incidents indicative of larger campaigns and establishes a typology for strategic objectives, including disruption (causing low-cost, low-pain incidents), short-term espionage (gaining access for immediate effect), long-term espionage (leveraging information for future operations), and degrade (pursuing physical destruction and impairment). Severity is measured on an interval scale between 0 and 10. Where (0) is no cyber activity (1) and begins tracking the impact of cyber operations of passive operations to (4) widespread government, economic, military, or critical private sector network intrusion, multiple networks to (5) single/multiple critical network infiltration and physical attempted destruction, with (10) a potential outcome of massive deaths. This coding methodology follows practices established in political science to study crises, disputes, and conflicts since the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2000 and 2020, there were 30 recorded dyadic cyber incidents indicative of larger campaigns between Russia and Ukraine. Russia was frequently the initiator but rarely the target. Of the 30 recorded cyber events between Russia and Ukraine, 28 (or 93 percent) were initiated by Russia. Over this period, the majority of Moscow’s targets (57 percent) were private, non-state actors. Only 11 percent of documented Russian cyber operations targeted government military targets. This targeting profile suggests that Moscow struggles to compromise more defended Ukrainian networks. While crucial cases such as SolarWinds suggest the possibility of more, yet-to-be-detected instances of cyber campaigns supported by human intelligence operations that are hard to detect, available data suggests that cyber defenses are holding in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of Russia’s past cyber incidents and campaigns targeting Ukraine were launched for disruption or espionage purposes rather than to degrade critical government networks. Only 29 percent of the documented cyber incidents indicative of larger campaigns were degradations. The majority of Russian cyber operations were characterized by phishing attempts, distributed denial-of-service campaigns, propaganda or vandalism efforts, and single network intrusions — all of which tend to have a limited impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Altogether, none of the 28 recorded cyber incidents indicative of larger campaigns were so severe that they resulted in lasting physical damage. On a scale from 0 to 10, with “0” representing no cyber activity and “10” representing massive death as a direct result of a cyber incident, Russia’s attacks targeting Ukraine never surpassed a “5” — single or multiple critical network infiltrations and attempted physical destruction. Furthermore, none of Russia’s past cyber operations resulted in a concessionary change in the behavior of Ukraine. Moscow appears to view using cyber operations more as a means of harassing Ukraine and supporting information operations than as a war-winning weapon indicative of the thunder run strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern of behavior is largely consistent with Russia’s interactions with its other rivals. According to the DCID 2.0 dataset, of the 113 total cyber incidents and larger campaigns documented that Russia initiated against its rivals between 2000 and 2020, only one (0.088 percent) resulted in a tangible political concession. Cyber operations remain a weak coercive instrument for Moscow despite their frequent use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;analysis-of-russian-cyber-operations-in-2022&quot;&gt;Analysis of Russian Cyber Operations in 2022&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning from the DCID 2.0 dataset to the first year of the war in Ukraine, the CSIS research team identified 47 publicly attributed cyber incidents indicative of a campaign initiated by Russia between November 29, 2021, and May 9, 2022. This data is culled directly from Ukrainian government sources and Microsoft reports, avoiding the biases that might be introduced by many contemporary news accounts. Because of the covert nature of cyber operations, it is likely only a small but representative sample of the larger population intrusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the character of cyber operations aligns more with intelligence and shaping activities such as deception, one would expect to see this tendency in the early stages of the war in Ukraine. In other words, observations from datasets such as the DCID 2.0 should show, even if they are only a small sample of the larger population, that cyber operations increased in frequency but not severity in the initial stages of the 2022 conflict compared to prewar statistics. Since it is difficult to know exactly when a cyber campaign begins, the data should show a lag resulting in spikes around the beginning of major hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cyber operations remain a weak coercive instrument for Moscow despite their frequent use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This condition is exactly what emerged from reviewing the pattern of cyber intrusions captured by the DCID 2.0. There was a 75 percent increase in documented cyber intrusions — but a decline in the average severity of the attack. The severity level for the average fell after the full-scale invasion, indicating that although low-level disruption and espionage have continued, there has been a significant drop in degradation-type operations coming from Russia. The results are statistically significant and reported in the Statistical Appendix. What is unknown is whether this decline is a function of deliberate targeting or the resiliency of Ukrainian cyber defenses, issues addressed later in this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to speculation that Russian targets would shift to focus on supporting military operations, an analysis of the DCID shows no statistically significant change in targeting or the overall campaign type. There was no statistically significant difference in targeting before and after the invasion (see Statistical Appendix). This finding suggests that the utility of cyber operations rests in setting conditions and intelligence more than in direct application during large-scale combat operations. While cyber-enabled targeting supports combat, the data shows that larger cyber campaigns do not radically shift during wartime. What the findings cannot determine is whether or not this observation is a function of the character of cyberspace or the result of case-specific factors such as the resiliency of Ukraine’s cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the style of Russian attacks, the research team found that Russia’s cyber activity during the war has been more disruptive than degrading, consistent with its past behavior. As seen in Figure 2, when one looks at these cyber operations by type, Moscow’s preferred cyber objectives have remained disruptive shaping activities and cyber espionage campaigns. During the first few months of its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, disruption incidents comprised 57.4 percent of the total incidents, followed by espionage (21.3 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliance on disruptive operations stands in contrast to Russia’s prewar behavior, which accentuated espionage. That said, for both the prewar sample and the 2022 war sample, degradative cyber operations were never the majority. Just as Russia’s past cyber operations failed to result in any Ukrainian concessions, no concessions were made by Ukraine during the timeframe of this analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There was no statistically significant difference in targeting before and after the invasion … the utility of cyber operations rests in setting conditions and intelligence more than in direct application during large-scale combat operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/jZGKj5z.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Figure 2: Russian Cyber Objectives Targeting Ukraine, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During war, a state might alter its cyber targeting. Yet this analysis of Ukrainian cyber events fails to confirm this hypothesis. Looking at the targets of Russian cyber aggression in the 47 total incidents, most (59.6 percent) targeted private non-state actors, followed by attacks targeting state and local government actors (31.9 percent). Just four (or 8.5 percent) targeted government military actors. This target-type breakdown closely corresponds to Russia’s targets between 2000 and 2020: 57 percent of the targets were private non-state actors, 32 percent were government non-military actors, and 11 percent were government military actors. It is counterintuitive that military actors have not been targeted more frequently during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results cast doubt on the extent to which Russia has successfully integrated its conventional military operations with cyber effects. Coordination with conventional forces became an important talking point, with a large segment of the news media following some analysts in making the claim that there was significant coordination between cyber operations and conventional military forces. This analysis fails to substantiate these claims. Russian military operations appear to struggle with integrating combined effects, especially across domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seeming lack of coordination between cyber and conventional attacks is something likewise acknowledged by James Lewis, senior vice president at CSIS. To pull off a successful, coordinated attack requires both planning and intelligence support, and either because it chose not to do this or it was incapable of doing so, Russia’s cyber efforts have had a limited effect on Russia’s military efforts in Ukraine. This leads Lewis to candidly state, “Cyberattacks are overrated. While invaluable for espionage and crime, they are far from decisive in armed conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These results cast doubt on the extent to which Russia has successfully integrated its conventional military operations with cyber effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-sense-of-the-findings&quot;&gt;Making Sense of the Findings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a dramatic increase in cyber operations during the initial stage of the war. Yet paradoxically, there was no corresponding change in severity or style, nor shifts in Russia’s target preferences. While the rate of cyber conflict increased during the war, the rate of concessions or even severe cyber operations did not. This empirical baseline, albeit based on aggregating unclassified data, demands an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis offered above provides an insight into what is happening but not necessarily a clear explanation for why it is happening. Below, this study considers three different causal explanations. The first — which follows the logic of the data collected and assessed above, as well as minority reports — offers an explanation for why Russian cyber efforts have been ineffective. The second considers the opposite: why the world could still witness widespread cyber campaigns in Ukraine and beyond. The third considers an alternative logic of cyberspace focused on misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation, as well as larger propaganda campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;1-the-defense-is-dominant&quot;&gt;1. “The Defense Is Dominant”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is the possibility that a combination of private sector innovation, state coordination, and emerging doctrine have made the cyber domain defense dominant. While SpaceX and Starlink captured headlines from Ukraine, multiple firms raced to help the country retain the ability to access cyberspace. Microsoft reported that a mix of “cyber threat intelligence and end-point protection … helped Ukraine withstand a high percentage of destructive Russian cyberattacks.” Even where Russia coordinated wiper attacks and cruise missile strikes against data centers, Ukraine was able to “disburse its digital infrastructure into the public cloud” and survive the onslaught. In November 2022, Ukrainian deputy prime minister and minister for digital transformation, Mykhalio Fedorov, praised Amazon Web Services (AWS) for their role in helping Ukraine maintain continuity of government during the war. During the opening stages of the conflict, AWS sent in suitcase-sized computer drives to help Ukraine back up critical data. Cybersecurity firm Cloudflare extended its Project Galileo services — a full suite of protection for organizations in the arts, human rights, civil society, journalism, and democracy promotion — to key organizations across Ukraine. This effort paralleled Google’s Project Shield, which similarly seeks to help at-risk organizations defend against cyber intrusions. In all, the character of cyberspace, which relies on business networks and the public sector, means that a web of private actors have been enmeshed with the defense of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond new technology that increases the power of the defense, the last seven years have seen an unreported push to coordinate cybersecurity policies across states and involve the private sector. The architects of Ukrainian cyber strategy participated in multiple U.S. Department of State initiatives, including meeting with the research director for the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission a year before the conflict began. Multiple federal agencies have programs supporting Ukraine’s networks and digital infrastructure that predate the war, including cybersecurity reform initiatives from the U.S. Agency for International Development and initiatives in the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice for sharing threat information. These efforts paralleled similar EU initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of what constitutes defensive mechanisms in cyberspace has also evolved over the last 10 years. Early cyber strategies released by the U.S. Department of Defense tended to be criticized as being too defensive. Following the lead of the 2018 National Defense Strategy and parallel initiatives across the Department of Defense, U.S. Cyber Command also issued a new strategy in 2018 that called for taking “action in cyberspace during day-to-day competition to preserve U.S. military advantages and defend U.S. interests.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new concepts have been put into action as the United States and its allies deployed cyber forces to support partner defenses. In a speech at the 2022 Reagan National Defense Forum, General Paul Nakasone, commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the NSA, recounted growing his hunt-forward team by 300 percent in 2021. Similarly, the European Union activated its Cyber Rapid Response Team to help Ukraine fend off Russian cyberattacks. NATO went as far as to accept Ukraine as a contributing participant in its Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence. U.S. defend-forward efforts have gone beyond cyber defense to covertly remove Russian malware from computer networks around the world. What is unclear as of this writing is whether or not these defend-forward activities have also included spoiling attacks to disrupt Russian cyber capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;2-its-a-matter-of-time&quot;&gt;2. “It’s a Matter of Time”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia could be regrouping following the initial success of Ukraine’s foreign-backed cyber defense or could be biding its time. The absence of a significant critical infrastructure attack using malware to date does not preclude one in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there are indications that Russia has been working to disrupt command and control since the beginning of the war. Hours before the ground invasion began, Russia deployed malware that disrupted the Viasat satellite system and led to over 30,000 internet connections going down temporarily across Europe, including 5,000 wind turbines. SpaceX’s leadership claims that the company’s Starlink network has resisted multiple Russian cyberattacks since the capability was deployed to Ukraine. More recently, there are reports of Russian cyber operations trying to penetrate Delta, a unique Ukrainian military intelligence and targeting fusion software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, since the beginning of the war, there have been reports of malware discovered on critical infrastructure in countries supporting Ukraine with foreign military assistance. In the United States, Russian malware was discovered on critical infrastructure linked to generating and providing electricity early in the conflict, which, if not discovered, could have been used to cause blackouts and supply disruptions. The United Kingdom issued a public warning for critical infrastructure organizations about Moscow’s increased efforts to target critical infrastructure since the start of the war in Ukraine. Poland is a frequent target, with logistics suppliers commonly put at risk, primarily with ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also been implicated in efforts to develop even more sophisticated tool kits. These measures include new classes of industrial control malware designed to disrupt, degrade, or destroy critical infrastructure, similar to the effects seen historically in the Stuxnet attack on Iranian nuclear facilities first discovered in 2010 and the BlackEnergy attacks that disrupted Ukraine’s electrical grid in 2015. This activity parallels increased activity by Russian cybercriminal networks targeting critical infrastructure. There are also reports that Russia is developing a new capability combining electronic warfare, signals intelligence, and cyber capabilities focused on targeting critical infrastructure and “life support systems.” This focus on sabotaging critical infrastructure is a key component of Russian military theory and the concept of “strategic operation for the destruction of critically important targets,” also known as SODCIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet Russian efforts to use cyberspace to degrade Western support or Ukrainian military capabilities have largely failed to meet expectations to date. Three reasons stand out. First, it may be that the defense is dominant in cyberspace. Moscow finds itself up against not just Ukraine but a global network of public and private cybersecurity professionals, limiting the extent to which it can exploit cyberspace. Second, there might be a tendency toward threat inflation in cyber reporting that makes Russian efforts look more sophisticated and robust than they actually are. Even the Viasat attack did not have a significant impact in Ukraine, according to Viktor Zhora, deputy chairman and chief digital transformation officer at the State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection (SSSCIP) of Ukraine. Third, there might be an even more simple logic: critical infrastructure in Ukraine can be degraded using cruise missile strikes, allowing Russia to reserve exquisite malware in case the war escalates to involve direct combat with the West. In other words, there might be escalation dynamics in cyberspace that restrain states from launching an all-out cyberattack campaign on a rival great power even amid a proxy war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;3-its-a-different-war&quot;&gt;3. “It’s a Different War”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia might be waging a different kind of cyberwar focused less on taking down critical infrastructure and more on limiting the coalition supporting Ukraine. This information warfare strategy seeks to sow chaos and cause doubt and confusion in a manner consistent with legacy Soviet ideas about active measures and reflexive control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported Russian network intrusion efforts in over 100 organizations in over 40 countries beyond Ukraine. Many of these efforts involve “Advanced Persistent Manipulator (APM) teams” linked to the Kremlin who specialize in planting false narratives across social media in a manner “similar to the pre-positioning of malware.” Russian cyber operators continue to conduct low-level disruptions against targets in its near abroad, targeting Ukraine and states supporting Ukraine. A recent attack by the Sandworm group, attributed to the Russian GRU, targeted Ukinform, the national news agency of Ukraine. Politico notes that Russia has sought to terrorize the Ukrainian civilian population after failing to leverage cyber operations on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of Ukraine, Russian-linked actors have used low-level attacks to disrupt websites, consistent with a cyber approach to political warfare. Lithuania was targeted after placing restrictions on Russia cargo moving into Kaliningrad. Many Russian-aligned threat groups have joined the chaos, targeting Norway, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There might be escalation dynamics in cyberspace that restrains states from launching an all-out cyberattack campaign on a rival great power even amid a proxy war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globally, Russia uses cyberspace to wage what researchers at the Atlantic Council call “narrative warfare.” These operations focus on eroding global confidence in Ukraine. Unlike traditional cyber intrusions, the goal is either to cause chaos or to shape public attitudes toward the conflict using computational propaganda. These methods include creating fake social media accounts, using bots, and targeting content prompts to unique user groups to change public attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, consider Moscow’s cyber-enabled information operations across Africa that accelerated after the Russian invasion in 2022. As early as 2019, researchers identified a cluster of Facebook pages tied to the Wagner Group that were active in Libya, the Central African Republic, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, and Mozambique. The operation showed a high degree of sophistication, including using local subcontractors and native speakers, adapting messages to unique content forms such as short videos and contests, and using Google Forms to solicit feedback. These operations accelerated after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with new groups such as Russosphere promoting Kremlin-linked propaganda on social media calibrated to diverse audiences across Africa. These social media outreach efforts complement more traditional propaganda approaches linked to platforms such as RT, which has expanded its coverage across Africa since the start of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-strange-patterns-to-alternative-futures&quot;&gt;From Strange Patterns to Alternative Futures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When combined with the empirical trends of Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine, these three logics provide the foundation for imagining how the cyber war in Ukraine — if not beyond — could evolve over the next 12 to 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;cyber-stalemate-in-the-future-the-defense-remains-dominant-limiting-offensive-cyber-campaigns-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Cyber Stalemate: In the future, the defense remains dominant, limiting offensive cyber campaigns in Ukraine.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders in Russia find progress on the cyber front as stalled as the battlefield. While trench lines, rivers, and concrete-reinforced fighting positions make maneuvering difficult in the real world, a mix of private sector firms and governments thwart cyber offensives in cyberspace. Moreover, Russian efforts to expand the scope of cyberattacks beyond Ukraine yield few long-term results and make Russia an international pariah on par with North Korea. Russian criminal groups thrive, increasing ransomware campaigns and “crime-as-a-service” campaigns globally, but Moscow proves unable to align cyber operations with its political objectives of winning the war in Ukraine and establishing Russian hegemony in its near abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wave of foiled Russian cyber offenses leads to a new debate about the efficacy of cyber operations as an instrument of war. The debate pits the United States, where the military and intelligence community back expanding investments in cyber capabilities despite Russian setbacks, against partners in Europe, many of whom want to see broader prohibitions against cyber operations and to pool data on attacks and vulnerabilities to increase security. These efforts are complicated by stalled legislation and executive action in the United States seeking to incentivize the private sector to report on network intrusions. The net result is that the United States and its partners are increasingly at odds over cyberspace and that there is no unity of effort in cybersecurity efforts between the public and private sectors. State cyber is limited beyond espionage, but criminal activity rises, leading to a loss of confidence in the ability or interest of the U.S. federal government to defend cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China watches the debates and continues to invest in a mix of domestic surveillance and cyber support for firepower strike concepts. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) focuses more on intelligence collection and targeting and refining ways of integrating cyber, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence to avoid Moscow’s fate. More troubling, Russia’s failure to integrate cyber operations with its military campaign pushes Beijing to increase its investments in weaponizing space. PLA military leaders assess that a mix of kinetic and non-kinetic effects against U.S. and partner nation satellite constellations will prove more reliable than terrestrial network intrusions and hard-to-contain malware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;war-comes-home-in-the-future-russia-escalates-and-unleashes-a-wave-of-critical-infrastructure-attacks&quot;&gt;War Comes Home: In the future, Russia escalates and unleashes a wave of critical infrastructure attacks.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With battlefield progress stalling and Western aid continuing to flow to Kyiv, Moscow authorizes a new campaign to attack critical infrastructure in states backing Ukraine. After years of experimentation in the wild, Russian cyber operators craft tool kits that exploit industrial control systems linked to energy production and transmission, transportation systems, wastewater treatment, and a wide range of factory processes. Whereas the earlier Viasat campaign knocked out 5,000 wind turbines, the latest effort leaves millions with intermittent access to power and water across Europe and the United States for 10 days. The result is widespread panic that leaves hundreds dead in the depths of winter. The economic fallout is worse, with widespread stock market crashes and currency runs. Business leaders are angry with Western intelligence and military leaders after it is revealed that components of the Russian cyber campaign were based on malware developed by the U.S. intelligence community that Moscow repurposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing widespread public pressure, the U.S. president retaliates against Russia. U.S. cyber operations cripple critical infrastructure across Russia and create a widespread humanitarian disaster despite efforts to conduct precision targeting of facilities linked to political elites and the military. The spillover effects lead to widespread economic fallout and further stress already weak infrastructure across Russia, causing a temporary rally-around-the-flag effect. Russian citizens back retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the cyberattacks, Russia places its nuclear forces on alert and deploys additional delivery systems to Belarus. Russian submarines cut key fiber-optic cables, leading to the degradation of information exchange, such as global communication and key anti-submarine early warning systems. Through back channels, Moscow signals that it intends to use nonstrategic nuclear weapons in Ukraine and will respond if the United States or any NATO member intervenes. The United States is forced to increase its nuclear alert levels, pushing the world into the most dangerous strategic crisis since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Pundits dub the standoff the “Cyber Missile Crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;digital-lies-in-the-future-russian-cyber-efforts-create-a-backlash-against-the-united-states-image-abroad&quot;&gt;Digital Lies: In the future, Russian cyber efforts create a backlash against the United States’ image abroad.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite military setbacks in Ukraine and dissent at home, attitudes toward Russia across the Global South are increasingly positive. The use of troll farms, easy access to RT in Africa, and computational propaganda successfully create an image of Moscow as a victim of Western neo-imperialism. Putin is seen in these narratives as more of a twenty-first-century Che Guevara than an aging strongman. The barrage of global propaganda complicates U.S. development programs and leads to widespread protests outside U.S. embassies abroad. Chinese Communist Party intermediaries amplify these efforts and spread the discontent to Southeast and Central Asia as well as Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home, the global wave of propaganda finds inroads on both the left and right of the U.S. political spectrum. Propaganda tailored to right-wing audiences stresses Russia as a defender of Christianity and a bulwark stopping a “woke West” from triggering the collapse of civilization. On the left, the social media-tailored messages speak to nonintervention and a need to divest from military power in favor of social spending at home. These messages also seek to link the framing of Washington as a neo-imperial power to historic grievances inside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaigns are accelerated by widespread access to generative artificial intelligence (AI), leading to a wave of deepfakes and AI-written content online. Absent public or private sector policies to moderate content, the barrage of content overwhelms social media. Public trust in governing institutions continues its long-term decline and spreads to a larger sense of cynicism in U.S. society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;policy-implications&quot;&gt;Policy Implications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The empirical evidence combined with the scenarios suggests a need to expand public-private partnerships and other collective defense mechanisms in cyberspace while developing new approaches to counter-influence operations and competition in the information environment. These recommendations, though developed independently and prior to its publication, match priorities outlined in the 2023 National Cyberspace Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-1-increase-public-private-partnerships-supporting-cyber-defense&quot;&gt;Recommendation 1: Increase Public-Private Partnerships Supporting Cyber Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not enough to secure critical U.S. intelligence and military networks. Modern societies live through complex networks that cross the public and private sectors. The easier it is to create pooled data and common standards, the harder it will be for adversaries to compromise security. This is equivalent to the old military adage of “moving with the terrain.” If the terrain (i.e., cyberspace) is defined by scalable networks connecting diffuse groups, then making it easier for these groups to coordinate defense will make it harder for any one actor to conduct offensive action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, this logic means that the more incentives the U.S. government can offer for public-private sector collaboration, the more likely cyber defense will hold against future attacks. For example, what if the companies that moved to help countries and societies under siege such as Ukraine were given tax credits or at least allowed to factor the labor hours used as a tax write-off? What if the U.S. government created a new category of grants or contract vehicles, such as indefinite delivery, and indefinite quantity contracts (IDIQs), that allowed the private sector to rapidly surge for supporting key U.S. partners and allies during a crisis? The ends and ways are clear: bolster cyber defenses through increased public-private collaboration. What is less clear is the optimal means for doing so, which will likely require a creative mix of inducements and policy changes similar to those proposed by the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, increasing public-private partnership should leverage clear, transparent pooled data on cyber threats. While the U.S. government is making progress on sharing threat information, the process could go much further. Just as the private sector relies on economic and weather data collected by the U.S. government, the same should apply to cyberspace, with the U.S. government maintaining a pool of credible data continually updated by data scientists. This data pool should anonymize entity names (e.g., businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies), similar to established practices with the Federal Aviation Administration Aviation Safety Reporting Program, and use a common typology, as seen in the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK framework. Without this common reference data set, the U.S. government and the private sector are as blind as financial firms were before government reporting of inflation and employment statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pooled data is a public good that can help public-private sector collaboration. Understanding attack trends over time will help cybersecurity professionals determine when to update networks and the best mix of defenses to ensure continuity of operations. With this information, the U.S. government can then determine where and how best to defend forward, prioritizing more exquisite cyber operations against threats yet to be mitigated by increased public-private sector coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-2-increase-diplomatic-engagement-around-cyber-defense-and-shared-intelligence&quot;&gt;Recommendation 2: Increase Diplomatic Engagement around Cyber Defense and Shared Intelligence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to working with the private sector, the U.S. government should expand efforts to coordinate with partners and allies to secure cyberspace. Recommendations like this are easy to say but hard to implement, requiring coordination across multiple agencies by, with, and through multiple partners. While the Department of State will play the leading role, it must work with other departments, such as the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and multiple elements within the military and intelligence community, to coordinate partner outreach activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resiliency of Ukrainian networks has been in part related to actions taken prior to the conflict to support developing and implementing a national cyber strategy. Ukraine’s strength in cyber defense has illustrated the critical role played by not just the private sector but also foreign governments in helping Kyiv prepare for the increase in cyber intrusions during the opening stages of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two primary areas to focus on with diplomatic outreach in support of cybersecurity: information sharing and interoperability. With respect to information sharing, the U.S. government should accelerate efforts to share knowledge of vulnerabilities with its partners. Too often, governments withhold information out of a desire to protect sources and methods used to gain the insight or, more insidiously, because the vulnerability data is linked to exploits currently in use by said government. These limitations, while valid, tend to prevent sharing of timely information on cyber vulnerabilities with partners and allies. They also create bureaucratic barriers and a culture of “no” that limits trust among key partners, often leading to delayed collection and imbalanced understanding of the cyber operational environment that discourages collective defense and coordination. It is also worth pointing out that without a central data repository, there is no single, verified repository tracking cyberattacks using a common framework. Even if it exists on classified networks, which these authors doubt, the bureaucratic barriers to sharing limit timely access or updates, often leaving even the intelligence community dependent on third-party vendors, such as threat intelligence firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, diplomatic outreach should build interoperability with key partners and allies by increasing the number of crisis simulations and cyber games used to develop a common understanding of how best to respond to coordinate cyber defenses, including incident response and consequence mitigation. Organizations such as the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) have a proven track record of developing and running major cyber exercises for federal, state, and local agencies. These efforts should be expanded to include international programs facilitated by the Department of State. These games would explore critical infrastructure attacks occurring simultaneously in multiple countries and how best to coordinate cyber defenses and incident response. These games would respond to the most dangerous course of action: that a rogue state such as Russia successfully degrades critical infrastructure globally. Given the targeting data seen above, this campaign would likely target private sector systems and seek to hold a state hostage through the suffering of its people (i.e., deterrence by punishment) as part of an escalating crisis. Given recent revelations about China’s probing of critical infrastructure networks globally, this finding extends well beyond coordinating defense against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;recommendation-3-reassess-how-to-counter-cyber-enabled-information-operations&quot;&gt;Recommendation 3: Reassess How to Counter Cyber-Enabled Information Operations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observations of the first year of the war in Ukraine suggest that it is easier to defend against malware than lies. However, the U.S. government has yet to develop a credible, dynamic response to cyber-enabled information operations and computational propaganda. Efforts such as the Department of State’s Global Engagement Center are a step in the right direction but are underfunded and lack the authorities to counter misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation at machine speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges of countering global propaganda are so large that no single agency or approach is likely to address them. Therefore, the U.S. Congress should charter a new congressional commission to study how best to combat misinformation as it relates to the larger U.S. national security strategy and challenge of existing legislated authorities. Prior commissions such as the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission are an example of how to catalyze change as it relates to securing cyberspace and can serve as a model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of cyberspace to connect battle networks, support intelligence, and exchange information is here to stay. Of note, it took less time for the communication technology to become ubiquitous in war than it did for the printing press to give way to written military orders. Yet the shape of modern war is reinforcing previous academic work skeptical of the term “cyberwar” and the extent to which states have successfully integrated the use of malware, which may be better suited for espionage than battlefield tool kits. Combined arms warfare is hard. Cyber combined effects are even more difficult and prone to uneven results, opportunity costs, and the perennial fog and friction that hang over the use of violence in pursuit of political objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is dangerous to use any one case to generalize the character of war. Yet the scale and stakes of the war in Ukraine make it a crucial case for understanding the future of war. Because it is hard to imagine any future conflict where cyberspace does not play some supporting role across the levels of war, failing to analyze how great powers such as Russia apply cyber power risks missing key trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mix of empirical assessment and alternative futures reviewed here suggest that cyber operations will likely prove better suited for shaping strategic interactions — whether through espionage or propaganda campaigns — than determining tactical outcomes. As with electronic warfare and signals intelligence, even when cyber operations support the art of battle, it will be indirectly and through altering the balance of information between opposing forces. Even here, the decision to employ exquisite cyber capabilities will be subject to intelligence and technical gain/loss analysis as commanders at different levels in the chain of command seek to preserve capability and balance exploitation with access. Put simply, the rush to use cyber access for a battlefield effect risks losing operational and strategic access. There is a commitment problem hanging over cyber operations: fear of future loss limits current use. This makes the idea of “cyber call for fire” at the battalion and company level a prospect that will always be subject to restrictions based on rules of engagement, authorities, and gain/loss considerations in a manner that structurally limits its responsiveness. This logic adds to preference for substituting easier-to-measure physical effects such as artillery and missile strikes. Why hack what you can destroy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategic logic of cyberspace is harder to gauge. There still is the prospect that Moscow has held back significant cyber capabilities to hold Western critical infrastructure at risk as a strategic deterrent. Even if this is true, a cursory look at Ukraine shows that previous efforts to use cyber operations to degrade critical infrastructure have produced only limited, temporary results. The prospect is further questionable given the balance of offense and defense in cyberspace as multiple countries and firms race to search for intrusions. Last, even though cyberspace is critical to modern political warfare and propaganda campaigns, the extent to which the population continues to be captured by subtle lies and deepfakes is unknown. The future could prove that distracted citizens around the world prove as susceptible to cyber-enabled influence campaigns as they are to data-driven marketing. Alternatively, people will begin to adapt, making them more resilient to the flood of lies that accompanies all war, but also likely more cynical and prone to mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;statistical-appendix&quot;&gt;Statistical Appendix&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This appendix outlines a series of statistical tests based on the larger research effort describing how Russia approached using cyber operations during the first year of the war in Ukraine. The findings are all based on the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Dispute dataset, which has been peer-reviewed and used in multiple, prior academic studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;hypothesis-1-the-period-before-and-after-the-initiation-of-hostilities-should-see-an-increase-in-the-frequency-of-cyber-incidents-but-a-decrease-in-their-severity&quot;&gt;Hypothesis 1: The period before and after the initiation of hostilities should see an increase in the frequency of cyber incidents but a decrease in their severity.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, the research team divides the variables that measure cyber severity into two groups: the pre-February 2022 group and the post-February 2022 group, the latter of which includes likely shaping cyber operations weeks before the actual February 24 invasion. Table 1 shows crosstabulations with Pearson residuals (z-scores) and chi-squared score of the two groups. The expected value is that there is an increase in the number of observations but a statistically significant decrease in the severity score. The null hypothesis is that there is no change in the observation and severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5utFeOl.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 1: Crosstabulations with Pearson Residuals and Chi-Squared Results Comparing Cyber Severity of Pre- and Post-February 24 Cyber Operations Initiated by Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pearson chi-squared score is 12.27, which is significant at the 95 percent confidence level, and the log-likelihood chi-squared score is 16.13 and is significant at the 99 percent confidence level, indicating that there is a significant difference between severity scores of cyber operations launched by Russia during the two phases of the conflict under investigation. This also indicates that the difference between expected and actual counts on severity levels between the two groups is also significantly different. The raw counts of observed cyber incidents and larger campaigns show a larger increase in frequency. In other words, while the frequency of cyberattacks increased, the severity declined in the first year of the war in Ukraine. Looking at Table 1, the research team observes low-level probes and disruptions of Ukrainian networks (severity score 1) increased after the February 24 invasion. For severity level 5 operations, the research teams observes these operations reduced by half after the invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;hypothesis-2-the-period-before-and-after-the-initiation-of-hostilities-should-see-no-change-in-russian-cyber-targeting&quot;&gt;Hypothesis 2: The period before and after the initiation of hostilities should see no change in Russian cyber targeting.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, the research team compares targets of Russian cyber operations pre- and post-invasion using a logic similar to hypothesis one. The expected value is that there should be no change in Russian cyber targeting between the two periods. The null is that Russian targeting of military targets increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 2 shows evidence that allows us to reject the notion that Russia will move away from targeting civilian infrastructure in favor of military targets in order to coerce Ukraine into submission. However, there is no significant difference in the means of the two groups, and the chi-squared shows that the difference between the expected and observed counts of the variables in these two groups is negligible. Russia’s targets continue to be civilian-dominated. In other words, Russia has not altered its targeting preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 2: Crosstabulations with Pearson Residuals and Chi-Squared Results Comparing Target Type via Cyber Operations of Pre- and Post-February 24 Cyber Operations Initiated by Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, given that most Russia’s past cyber incidents are low-cost, low-payoff operations, the research team expects that its overall cyber strategy will continue to be comprised of mostly disruption and espionage efforts, rather than degradative efforts, leading to our third hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;hypothesis-3-russia-will-continue-to-leverage-disruptive-shaping-activities-and-espionage-to-alter-the-balance-of-risk-calculations-prior-to-and-during-the-conflict&quot;&gt;Hypothesis 3: Russia will continue to leverage disruptive shaping activities and espionage to alter the balance of risk calculations prior to and during the conflict.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 3 shows the results of the two phases of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine since 2014. The research team finds that the mean value of objective type goes down significantly, indicating the preference of utilizing disruptive techniques at the expense of espionage and degradations. As articulated above, as the conflict has shifted from a hybrid, lower-intensity conflict to a full-scale war, the role of cyber operations has also shifted. More severe, degrading cyber operations are being replaced by more conventional means of destruction on Ukrainian targets by the Russian military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Y1VR4rW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Table 3: Crosstabulations with Pearson Residuals and Chi-Squared Results Comparing Cyber Objectives of Pre- and Post-February 24 Cyber Operations Initiated by Russia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pearson chi-squared score of 8.08 and the likelihood ratio chi-squared score of 8.31 are significant at the 95 percent confidence level, which indicates there is a significant change in the cyber objective choice by Russia in the two groups. Furthermore, these scores indicate that that there is a significant difference between observed variable values and the expected ones. Russia has slowed its use of espionage or degradation cyber operations and have increased the low-cost, low pain disruptive techniques, which are often accompanied by information operations that contain propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That degradation has not been Russia’s primary focus during the first few months of the Russo-Ukrainian war, therefore, is perhaps not as surprising. Therefore, given that there has not been a shift in the cyber objective patterns implemented by Russia, the research team finds support for the third hypothesis of a continuation of disruptive operations but fewer espionage and degradation operations. It can be assumed that the lack of degrading incidents is being substituted with conventional weapons of destruction, as evidenced in Russia’s current onslaught of drones and missiles on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（12日）踏入審訊第84天。民協前主席施德來繼續作供，表示為改善民協形象，於選舉論壇有計劃地提否決預算案爭取五大訴求，以顯得更「進取」；惟他在論壇稱「要否決政府所有議案」並非原有計劃，是因聽到胡志偉和譚得志發言後，認為要表現得更進取，臨場壓力下才「爆肚」說出來。施亦於論壇稱與中共無談判餘地，遭官質疑背棄信念。施解釋當時基層溫和的民主派也對政府不滿，若他提「有得談判」如「政治自殺」，民協亦難以維持；又強調雖在論壇否認「又傾又砌」，但仍會進行談判磋商。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，施德來曾拍片提及加泰隆尼亞爭取獨立的情況，稱港人亦「慢慢趨向爭取獨立」，不想北京和中共管治香港。施強調他和民協也反對港獨、亦非攻擊中央政府，只是談及港人在高壓打壓下萌獨立想法、以誇張表達港人憂慮民主自由空間收窄；而他想守護一國兩制的初衷，不想由北京「一國一制」直接管治香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱論壇前曾準備熱門關鍵字如否決預算案攬炒-顯民協進取形象&quot;&gt;施稱論壇前曾準備熱門關鍵字如否決預算案、攬炒 顯民協進取形象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民協前主席施德來今繼續作供。他昨稱「墨落無悔」令初選轉向政治議題，影響其選舉部署，他簽署「墨落」並在初選論壇刻意營造進取形象。施德來今表示，論壇前曾分析對手特點再選擇向誰提問，亦因意識到初選集中在政治議題討論，故選擇就社會熱門政治議題表達看法，並預備了熱門的關鍵字如否決財政預算案、《國安法》、DQ和攬炒，因他想在論壇「增加自己嘅知名度、曝光率同改善民協嘅形象，讓我自己同民協顯得進取一啲」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，當施說變得更進取，是指比民協本身進取，還是比人們認為民協的形象進取？施稱兩者皆有，指民協在民主議題一向予人保守形象，甚至有嘉賓以「怯」來形容，故要在民協形象顯得進取。陳仲衡指，但該批評是指向民協的前主席，不是施。施同意，但指因他本身知名度低，故其包袱就是民協自身弱點，而當他要顯得進取便要從對手找一個對象，故當時向民主黨前主席胡志偉提問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱就又傾又砌會做但不會講認同民協談判手法&quot;&gt;施稱就「又傾又砌」會做但不會講、認同民協談判手法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，那民協立場有改變嗎？施稱「民協喺政治立場其實不變嘅」。至於爭取手法（approach），施稱「我純粹係選舉論壇變得進取」、「表現得好強硬」；又指即使在2019年社運，民協都是以合法和平的原則行事，而他和其他民協成員在運動「冇一個係被檢控拘捕」，「呢個已經同其他民主派政黨嘅分別」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指不一定要犯法才顯得進取，再追問民協爭取手法是否實際上變得更進取？施強調民協重視溝通、協商，故常被罵「又傾又砌」，他和何啟明在論壇亦常被以此攻擊，故當提到「又傾又砌」時「我哋會否認」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，當施否認時，意味民協在其領導下，爭取手法有實質改變嗎？施說：「我哋會做，但係唔會咁講」，亦指他在民協成長過程認識到民協的談判手法，「我係認同民協呢種談判手法，於是我一直留喺民協」，舉例2010年民協支持政改時他是任中委。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱因臨場壓力爆肚提要否決所有議案望比胡志偉譚得志更進取&quot;&gt;施稱因臨場壓力「爆肚」提要否決所有議案、望比胡志偉譚得志更進取&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續指，因6月時初選議題集中在政治，估計公眾和傳媒都不會關注民生議題，故在論壇「有計劃去講」否決財政預算案爭取五大訴求。辯方展示論壇謄本，施提及：「今日嘅中共，我哋冇討論嘅空間，冇談判嘅餘地，只有抗爭到底，入到議會裏面，我哋大家都要否決財政預算案，大家都要否決政府所有嘅議案，同呢個政府抗爭到底，攬炒呢個政府，因為真正攬炒香港嘅就係林鄭，就係呢一個中共，所以我哋香港人一定要抗爭到底。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施指，否決預算案爭取五大訴求「係我一路諗住講嘅說話」，但否決所有議案和撥款則「本身冇諗過講」、「自己睇返都覺得唔合理」，強調他也會爭取失業援助金和強積金修例，「我冇理由否決所有嘅嘢」。施並解釋，是因他在論壇聽了胡志偉和譚得志的說話，「我要即場諗如何進取一啲，然後爆肚咁諗出嚟」，形容「真係臨場一個壓力」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續引胡志偉提到「我哋係要用我哋否決權」，指雖胡無提預算案，「但我本身唔預佢會咁樣講嘅，因為佢本身唔簽墨落無悔」；譚得志則稱「兩次否決財政預算案、癱瘓個政府、林鄭柒婆落台，嚟到做 bargaining power，爭取五大訴求，缺一不可」，施認為譚發言更進取、更吸引公眾關注，故他即場再想如何表現得更進取。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑發言與信念矛盾-施稱若提可磋商以當時社會氣氛屬政治自殺&quot;&gt;官質疑發言與信念矛盾 施稱若提可磋商以當時社會氣氛屬「政治自殺」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問，譚得志談及「癱瘓政府」，施是想比譚更激進？施否認，指民協最接近票源為民主黨，故是集中在胡志偉發言的基礎再進取。李運騰質疑既然如此，施無需比譚得志更進一步，又指當時施已投身政壇10至12年，施指談判磋商一直是其信念、至2020年也無改變，為何突然又在論壇說沒有談判空間，不是與他過去多年的信念有矛盾嗎？李運騰又指「你背棄（betray）了過去十年的堅定信念」，問施能否解釋。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施稱，選舉論壇有選舉需要，「如果喺嗰個場合講我哋有得傾、有得談判、有得慢慢去磋商，以當刻嘅社會氣氛、民主派支持者對政府嘅不滿，如果咁講我唔單止係我自己嘅政治自殺，亦都難以令到民協繼續維持落去」，又指當時即使很溫和、很基層的民主派支持者也會對政府不滿，「我哋嘅表現都要接近民情。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，所以為了保護民協和他的形象，他說話時選擇不誠實（untruthful）？施點頭：「可以咁講，正確嘅」，同意當時「我相信咁樣先可以改善民協形象」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施認與馮檢基信念有相似處論壇發言為政治語言非真正想法&quot;&gt;施認與馮檢基信念有相似處、論壇發言為政治語言非真正想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續提及施論壇上被問到假如民協前主席馮檢基想參選，會向他說什麼，施稱「唔參加初選你肯定唔係35+嘅一員，肯定唔係同路人」，又指「今日嘅民協入到議會裏面，我哋一定會兩次否決財政預算案，入到議會裏面，今日係要抗爭，唔抗爭嘅就行開」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳問若馮檢基參選，與施一樣會協商，為何施叫馮不選，又指馮與施的差別只是無提「五大訴求」。施指「我相信無論民主民生上，其實我嘅信念同馮檢基都有相似嘅地方」，但當時想表達馮應參加初選。陳指，故上述兩段均是採取「政治語言」，不代表施真正的想法？施同意，指「都會用進取嘅諗法去諗所有嘅回答」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱論壇後認為成功營造進取感覺-法官追問下稱選民無從得知無意用否決權&quot;&gt;施稱論壇後認為成功營造進取感覺 法官追問下稱選民無從得知無意用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問施德來有否達到其選舉論壇的目的，施稱論壇後有看 Facebook 和網上討論區，「我覺得我要計劃顯得進取嘅一個感覺係做到嘅」，即讓人感覺他們會否決預算案爭取五大訴求，但「我哋唔會話呢個係談判籌碼、如果到時林鄭唔應承我哋都唔會否決，我哋唔可以咁講啦」，並再次強調否決所有撥款和議案並非他計劃的說話。陳慶偉追問，選民可以從何得知施其實無意運用否決權？施在追問下稱「冇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡則問，施當時腦海中是想着「更黃」抑或「更進取」的字眼？施稱若「黃」指重視民主訴求的選票，他在論壇是刻意希望該些選民留意到，「即使我冇勝算都好，我都想營造民協一個改善嘅感覺。」施亦承認其言論對何啟明會有影響，「甚至我有啲言論可能進取過何啟明𠻹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施錄片介紹加泰隆尼亞-稱與中央角力爭自治空間-為守護港人治港選舉語言&quot;&gt;施錄片介紹加泰隆尼亞 稱與中央角力爭自治空間 為守護港人治港選舉語言&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰昨臨散庭前，提及警方從施德來手機檢取關於加泰隆尼亞的片段，辯方今展示該片段，施介紹由學者方志恆主編的《香港革新論II》，並以西班牙加泰羅尼亞為例，談及自治區與中央主權的角力，在加強打壓下由爭取擴大自治到爭取獨立。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施表示，那是6月下旬為其 Facebook 節目「區政好書」錄製的片段，該節目於2020年1月開始，原意兩個月一次，為其他新當選區議員介紹有用的書，他曾介紹過公屋重建、城市規劃和區議員實務寫書信。施續指，6月時打算配合選舉論壇講「民主、自治、法治」，加上《國安法》亦將實施，故選取了《香港革新論II》一書，承認該次節目是為選舉而製。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就片段提及「嚟緊呢我哋會有呢一個目標，就係民主派望喺立會取得過半嘅議席，其實我哋就係透過制度裡面同中央角力，爭取我哋香港人最大嘅自治空間」，辯方問施當時對「一國兩制」的想法有否改變，施強調「一國兩制、高度自治係我一直嘅信念」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰關注施提及「我哋」，問施是否指他理解民主派過半的共同目標，就是與中央角力、爭取最大自治空間？施稱議會過半一定是民主派辦初選的目標，而與中央角力、爭最大自治空間，「我會形容係守護一國兩制、港人治港嘅選舉語言，用咗強烈嘅字眼，其實都係守護《基本法》下高度自治呢個原則」，並確認「制度裡面」是指「一國兩制」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提唔想中共管治香港-施稱不想一國一制直接管治否認攻擊中央政府&quot;&gt;提「唔想中共管治香港」 施稱不想一國一制直接管治、否認攻擊中央政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施片中亦提及：「但係香港人點解我哋會慢慢趨向爭取獨立呢，好明顯地我哋就唔想北京管治、唔想中共去管治香港，爭取我哋最大嘅一個自治空間。」施表明「我同民協都反對香港獨立」，而他提「我哋會慢慢趨向爭取獨立」，是談及「一啲高壓打壓令到有一啲香港人有獨立嘅諗法」，但強調他在發言的開首和結尾都是「講緊一國兩制、高度自治嘅『自治』，呢個先係我喺呢一段錄影嘅目的」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問「唔想北京管治、唔想中共去管治香港」，是否不想中共管治香港，施解釋是指「取消咗一國兩制、變成一國一制嘅直接管治，我唔想咁樣」，但「一國兩制、高度自治嘅管治係我想嘅」，「我係想守護一國兩制嘅初衷」。陳仲衡質疑，但施表達的方式會令人感覺煽動或挑起（stir up）對北京和中共的反對情緒，施回應當時《國安法》未實施、亦未知條文內容，「社會係有一個感覺，覺得民主自治嘅空間係被收窄」，他亦有用選舉語言和誇張手法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，施是否想透過攻擊中央政府增加他的知名度和改善民協形象，施否認指他無此想法，他亦不會說是「攻擊中央政府」，不過「中央政府用直接頒布《國安法》嘅形式，香港人係擔憂我哋嘅民主自由嘅空間收窄，我將嗰種憂慮用咗誇張嘅形容方法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/YsckeCk.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（12日）踏入審訊第84天。民協前主席施德來繼續作供，表示在論壇雖提否決預算案，但實際不會這樣做，解釋否決權屬爭取五大訴求的籌碼，而選民是望政府回應五大訴求，並非真的想否決預算案，他不會向時任特首林鄭月娥說出底牌。法官陳慶偉問以林鄭性格，施認為她會回應五大訴求嗎？施表示：「就算佢對於五大訴求冇一樣應承都好，我認為佢最少欠香港人一個道歉」。被問論壇的發言是否均事前準備，施稱很多題目無法預料，是臨場應對，而「喺呢一個論壇我最主要講一句說話，喺呢度講咗幾次嘅，無論開頭結尾中間我都有，就係我好鍾意香港」。施說「我好鍾意香港」時語帶哽咽、聲音微微顫抖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施並指，《國安法》生效當晚閱畢條文，審視後認為民協會章和初選言論均無牴觸法例，他亦相信戴耀廷稱初選和否決預算案不違法，亦看不到戴有顛覆國家意圖。施德來主問完結，明將開始接受盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱國安法當晚閱畢條文-不覺民協宗旨及初選言論違法&quot;&gt;施稱《國安法》當晚閱畢條文 不覺民協宗旨及初選言論違法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民協前主席施德來繼續作供，談及《國安法》實施後的情況。他表示《國安法》於6月30日晚頒布後，他「嗰晚即刻睇」，一小時內閱畢全部66條，並指《國安法》列出四大罪行，由於他作為民協主席，故要檢視民協會章和政綱與《國安法》有否牴觸，他亦有檢視初選言論和選舉工程，但不覺得有何牴觸之處。施又坦言當時是想着民協信念和宗旨多於初選，因無想過初選言論會與《國安法》有關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施並指，翌日有找民協區議員、任執業律師的廖成利，廖講解《國安法》內容。他同日晚上收到戴耀廷 WhatsApp 訊息，戴稱審視《國安法》後，認為否決預算案是《基本法》賦予立法會的憲制權力，不可能是顛覆國家政權罪下的「非法手段」，亦指否決後特區政權機關仍能依法履行職能，不能算是「干擾、阻撓」，認為否決預算案不會觸犯《國安法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續指，他相信並同意戴的說法，加上他對《基本法》的理解及昨日呈堂的數篇文章，「我當時相信《基本法》真係畀我呢個權力，亦都不會觸犯《國安法》22條第3款（顛覆國家政權罪）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱看不到戴耀廷有顛覆意圖-自己亦無此想法&quot;&gt;施稱看不到戴耀廷有顛覆意圖 自己亦無此想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟李運騰指，一個人是否意圖顛覆政府是主觀的，不同人有不同意圖，而戴耀廷不能代表其他人說他們在想什麼。施同意，但說「我睇唔到戴耀廷有顛覆國家意圖，呢個係我嘅理解」。李運騰問，而施德來當時不認為自己做的事是顛覆國家政權或香港政府？施搖頭：「我冇呢個諗法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施確認，他於7月4日出席由九東秘書處辦的另一個九東地區論壇，並指因理解否決預算案並非非法行為，故其策略「基本上冇改變」。辯方展示論壇謄本，施曾提及：「我哋都承諾議會過半，我哋會兩次否決財政預算案，攬炒林鄭，林鄭下台，迫使佢呢回應五大訴求」，施重申提兩次否決是要展示進取感覺，但強調實際上是談判的籌碼策略，望林鄭對五大訴求進一步回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇提兩次否決財案惟實無意這樣做-施解釋屬談判籌碼不會亮底牌&quot;&gt;論壇提兩次否決財案惟實無意這樣做 施解釋屬談判籌碼、不會亮底牌&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，即若施當選後政府不回應五大訴求，他會否決預算案兩次？施說：「呢度所寫係，但實際我唔係咁樣做。」李運騰續指，但施之後在論壇提到：「如果做到35+，我諗每個人就已經唔再係代表自己嘅政黨喇，因為我哋全部都係透過配票嘅方式，一個抗爭陣營嘅整體去攞到過半議席⋯⋯我諗我哋每一位決定35+嘅人都要一條心，一齊決議去攞一個共識⋯⋯我哋仲要有一個精神去攬炒呢個林鄭、攬炒呢個政府，特別係否決財政預算案。」&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 施德來（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李指施表示當選後不再代表黨、而是代表民主派，施同意，解釋因民協很多時予人感覺「好唔民主派」，故當時要表現得較像民主派同一陣線，並使用「抗爭陣營」、「同路人」等字眼。李指施發言亦無提要考慮預算案內容，施同意，但指其發言並非民協看法，重申他要在選舉顯得進取，「我自己諗出嚟去講嘅」，但如真的當選，「我當然係跟返民協嘅諗法同決定，因為我係代表民協。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，所以施當時說的和他會做的是完全相反？施表示：「談判策略、爭取籌碼唔會咁樣講出嚟嘅，因為講咗等於林鄭知道底牌，佢自然當民主派過到半都唔會回應五大訴求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱若盡力爭取五大訴求便非欺騙選民-指選民亦非真的想否決財案&quot;&gt;施稱若盡力爭取五大訴求便非欺騙選民 指選民亦非真的想否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，但現時施並非在談判桌，而是面對公眾、爭取他們支持，人們依賴其說話來決定會否在選舉支持他，那施是說他在欺騙選民嗎？施說「唔係欺騙，因為爭取五大訴求我係認為應該要做嘅，所以就算我唔否決財政預算案我都會想同林鄭去傾」，又指過去民協在立法會有議席，在預算案出台前政府會派代表與民協討論聽意見，他也有參與過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡說，欺騙的意思是施說會否決兩次，但現在卻說不會。施重申，否決預算案只是爭取的手法、講出來的談判籌碼，而他的目標是爭取回應五大訴求：「我都認為選民係希望對五大訴求有回應，唔係真係否決財政預算案。所以即使個情況係最終林鄭對五大訴求冇回應都好，選民見到我哋盡咗力去同林鄭磋商、爭取甚至乎有啲威迫都好，我覺得做咗嗰個努力就已經冇欺騙到選民喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問按林鄭性格會否回應五大訴求-施稱即使無應承亦最少欠港人道歉&quot;&gt;官問按林鄭性格會否回應五大訴求 施稱即使無應承亦最少欠港人道歉&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，假設在磋商的過程，林鄭月娥派高級的政務人員與他們談判，施也會向他說如不回應五大訴求，便會否決預算案嗎？施點頭：「有機會」，並指「可能有唔同階段嘅商討嘅，就算五大訴求佢嘅回應方式都有好多種」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉追問，以林鄭的性格，施認為她會回應五大訴求嗎？（“Given Carrie Lam’s character, do you think she will respond to the five demands?”）旁聽席傳來笑聲，陳志全和余慧明等也發笑。施說：「就算佢對於五大訴求冇一樣應承都好，我認為佢最少欠香港人一個道歉。」陳慶偉續說：「不用管道歉（“Never mind about apology.”）」，並指午飯後繼續。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱攬炒指否決財案憲制程序攬炒雙方為民主派議席和特首職位&quot;&gt;施稱「攬炒」指否決財案憲制程序、攬炒雙方為民主派議席和特首職位&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;午飯後，就施於上述論壇提「攬炒」，施稱是當時政治選舉用語，意指透過兩次否決預算案的憲制程序爭取五大訴求。法官陳仲衡問是哪兩邊攬炒，施指為「林鄭月娥」和「民主派」，因第一次否決財案致立會解散後，民主派就會失去所有議席，需重選才能返回議會，而若成功入議會再否決預算案，就到林鄭月娥因第52條程序下台，故「攬炒」是指民主派的立法會議席及林鄭的特首位置。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，但這會影響香港市民的生活？施承認「會有影響，因為始終對政府嘅運作會構成一啲妨礙」，故他一直強調否決預算案是談判策略和籌碼，「我唔會想真係咁做。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;提國際制裁-施稱僅分析推論政府大規模dq情況-無意籲制裁&quot;&gt;提國際制裁 施稱僅分析推論政府大規模DQ情況 無意籲制裁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰關注，施當時知道有勾結外國勢力的國安法控罪，但仍提「要令到國際社會撕破呢個中共嘅面具」、國際社會制裁中共。施解釋當時是分析推論政府大規模DQ會令國際社會制裁，但他本人「冇實際諗法同行為諗住去呼籲國際制裁」；他亦不相信政府會大規模DQ，「甚至乎我自己會畀人DQ嘅機會我都覺得係冇。」施又指，曾於不同場合稱「我唔怕DQ」，「其實都係我覺得我DQ機會微，而顯得我硬淨進取嘅一個形象。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問施提制裁是否受「攬炒十步」啟發，施稱無關，並補充問題是問候選人會否簽「加料」的確認書，施當時取態也「好進取」，認為所有人都不應該簽，提國際制裁亦是營造進取形象。李再追問，中共是否「攬炒」的一部分，施指他說「攬炒」時沒有這個想法，並指雖然該詞或源自戴耀廷文章，但在6月的語境，大家都明白「攬炒」是指透過兩次否決預算案爭取五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施語帶哽咽指論壇最主要想講我好鍾意香港&quot;&gt;施語帶哽咽指論壇最主要想講「我好鍾意香港」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續引施談及中共打壓，指很可能安排國家幹部走進學校和大公司，但籲港人不要被自我審查限制，舉例有人會將《願榮光歸香港》改成數字，他認為是不需要，因是將自己限制在「白色恐怖」下。施同意上述均為政治用語和修辭。黃廷光問，上述均是施德來事前準備的答案，抑或他即場想到便說出來？施表示，該論壇「好多題目我都估唔到」，故他是「臨場諗一啲進取嘅用語去應對」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施並指：「喺呢一個論壇我最主要講一句說話，喺呢度講咗幾次嘅，無論開頭結尾中間我都有，就係『我好鍾意香港』」，施說「我好鍾意香港」時語帶哽咽、聲音微微顫抖，說罷面頰和雙耳微紅，望向面前螢幕沒有說話。黃廷光問施是否需時休息，稱施看來有些情緒（emotional）。施輕抹面頰並點頭以左手舉OK手勢，輕聲說「OK」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施國安法後印抗極權單張-稱新法令人感覺收窄言論空間&quot;&gt;施《國安法》後印「抗極權」單張 稱新法令人感覺收窄言論空間&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示施德來7月7日下單製作、3日後印刷的選舉單張，寫有「重新認識支持民協 抗極權衛我城」，施身穿黑衣、面孔嚴肅，解釋民協予人怯懦弱勢的感覺，他要刻意顯得進取，「想大家認知民協進步咗、進取啲、似民主派嗰陣時嘅氣氛一啲。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續指，「抗極權」是指「面對中共極權打壓」，重申《國安法》令人感覺「收窄咗民主同言論嘅空間」，故將該感覺用此口號演譯出來。施稱「中共極權打壓」、「反抗」和「保皇黨」等有政治用語成分，但他也有提到失業援助金，指「呢個係民生（議題）亦都係真實嘅我」，重申他一方面想政府回應五大訴求，另一方面民生上亦「真係想爭取失業援助金」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱曾讀曾國衛訪問-相信戴耀廷及趙家賢稱初選合法&quot;&gt;施稱曾讀曾國衛訪問 相信戴耀廷及趙家賢稱初選合法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就初選合法性，施續指有看過戴耀廷7月6日記者會的報導，戴均如7月1日稱初選和否決財案不違《國安法》；而因此前是私人訊息，而記者會是公開，故「加強咗我嘅相信」，施亦有讀到戴翌日《蘋果日報》文章〈民主派35+初選會否觸犯國安法〉。陳仲衡指，但施只是從3個不同場合聽到同一個人的意見，會令到結論更加可信嗎？施指他也有諮詢民協區議員廖成利律師的意見。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續指，7月9日時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衛接受文匯報訪問，「我當然冇睇到《文匯報》啦本身。」李運騰問為何用「當然」，問不論他是否同意《文匯報》內容，他難道不是更應該看建制派有關《國安法》的說法？還是他只是想聽到他想聽的話？（“You just want to hear what you want to hear?”）施更正指他平時無看《文匯報》習慣，但就曾國衛訪問，他當晚有上文匯報網站閱讀。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施並指，戴耀廷同日下午舉行記者會並於 Facebook 發聲明回應曾國衛，他有看直播和讀帖文，並認為戴說法合理、接受戴稱初選和否決權不違法。會上趙家賢亦指從事選舉實務十多年，初選是合法公民權利，施稱對趙有認識，過去民協亦多次參與民主動力舉辦的初選，「我認識佢都係一個穩陣嘅人」，故加強了其相信。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱落敗後即停止選舉工程無意顛覆國家政權及癱瘓政府&quot;&gt;施稱落敗後即停止選舉工程、無意顛覆國家政權及癱瘓政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施最終於初選落敗，承認自己「落選亦都好低票」，亦立即停止選舉工程，也沒有再參與初選協調會議。施並指，無論初選前後或期間，他也「盡力去進行」區議員工作，初選只佔其工作很少一部分；加上他是區議會其中一個委員會主席，要負責審批政府項目，故仍與政府協作，及繼續爭取民生，如2020年9月曾寫信予黃大仙民政處交予政務司，望在新一輪抗疫基金設立失業援助。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃廷光最後問，施德來有否與其他人串謀無差別否決預算案，及若政府拒絕回應五大訴求會否決預算案，施均稱沒有，並指若當選會「做好立法會嘅角色」。黃再問，施有否意圖顛覆國家政權及癱瘓政府，施均稱沒有。黃廷光表示完成主問，代表何啟明的大律師阮偉明表示會有少量盤問，案件明早續。&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;施德來：視否決財案為談判籌碼、理解譚耀宗指重選立會為解決分歧機制&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/cUOVhbb.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第83天。民協前主席施德來繼續作供，談及對《基本法》賦予立法會否決權的理解。施引述時任全國人大常委譚耀宗的訪問，指譚是《基本法》草委委員，會明白條文起草原意，而譚稱否決財案致立會解散後，原意讓選民透過重選決定特首抑或議員合理。施理解指當立法會與特首出現嚴重分歧，其中一個解決憲政危機的方法，就是特首解散立法會重選：「香港人選民可以選擇邊一邊係合理」；又指根據戴耀廷的文章，基於不同原因否決預算案為《基本法》賦權，而即使立法會解散，特首仍可批准臨時撥款維持一般運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施又指，一直認為否決權只是爭取五大訴求的談判策略和籌碼，而他「默許」戴在無共識下將否決權條款加入文件，因認同爭取五大訴求、亦認為條款無綑綁一定要否決。施又認為戴耀廷「攬炒十步」的推論「好錯」，因不信中央和港府會大規模DQ議員和武力鎮壓。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官昨質疑須恰當原因方可否決財案-今稱本案關乎達致五大訴求手段非訴求合法性&quot;&gt;官昨質疑須恰當原因方可否決財案 今稱本案關乎達致五大訴求手段非訴求合法性&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民協前主席、前黃大仙區議員施德來昨供稱，認為否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求是《基本法》賦予的權力，法官質疑若否決原因不恰當便非恰當用權，施稱認為要求政府回應五大訴求是恰當原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施今稱，五大訴求包括撤回逃犯條例、成立獨立調查委員會、特赦抗爭者、撤回612暴動定性、重啟政改達致雙普選。辯方大律師黃廷光問，施認為迫使政府回應的五大訴求內有違法的部分嗎？惟法官陳仲衡指，本案非關乎五大訴求合法性，而是關於達致五大訴求的手段；法官李運騰亦指，就五大訴求是否不合法或無理也可以討論（open to debate）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱讀譚耀宗訪問理解基本法原意-否決財案機制可解決特首與立法會分歧&quot;&gt;施稱讀譚耀宗訪問理解《基本法》原意 否決財案機制可解決特首與立法會分歧&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;黃廷光續問及施德來對《基本法》立法原意的理解，陳慶偉問施怎會知道立法原意，黃說是想顯示他當時的思想狀態（state of mind）。辯方其後展示3篇文章顯示施對《基本法》賦予立法會權力的理解，第一篇為2020年3月《香港01》就時任全國人大常委譚耀宗的訪問〈譚耀宗：倘泛民議會過半觸發憲政危機 中央勢出手〉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡質疑，毋須用其他文章證明《基本法》賦權立法會否決財案，「重點是背後的原因和意圖」；又質疑譚耀宗沒有出席協調會議，對「35+計劃」的理解不會比施德來多。施同意，但指他主要集中在譚對《基本法》的了解，而由於譚是《基本法》起草委員會的委員，會明白條文起草原意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續引文中提及，據《基本法》第50及52條，立法會拒通過預算案後特首可解散立會，如重選的立法會仍拒通過特首須辭職，譚耀宗解釋起草原意時提到：「我們當年考慮到，會否是特首做得不好呢？或者是立法會多數派試圖留難特首？我們想取一個平衡，讓選民（透過重選）決定哪方合理。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施認為從文章理解到，當立法會與特首出現嚴重分歧，《基本法》第50到53條就是一個「解決機制」，其中一個方法是在第一次否決預算案後，「特首解散立法會重選，香港人選民可以選擇邊一邊係合理，從而解決呢個憲政危機。」陳仲衡一度問，那施有沒有讀過任何文章提及容許無差別否決預算案？施指理解是「至少都要提供個原因」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱3月到6月中完全無想過否決財案-其後想法改變&quot;&gt;施稱3月到6月中完全無想過否決財案 其後想法改變&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，施談及這篇文章，是否想說參與協調會議時，他已有意圖運用否決權迫使特首？施否認，解釋3月到6月中前他「完全冇」想過否決財政預算案，但到了6月中後開始有此想法，亦在不同場合和訪問使用否決預算案的字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰關注當時會議上是否已有運用否決權迫政府的討論，施稱在九東會議上沒有印象、其他區他則不知道，但「即使冇協調會，坊間都會認為民主派取得過半數就會有一個否決權，所以就會引申有否決財政預算案呢種諗法」，譚耀宗在訪問中亦有此理解。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，若然如此辯方為何要展示此文章，與施德來當時的思想狀態有何關係。施解釋因到了6月他曾表達否決預算案，而他當時相信是《基本法》賦予的權力，確認是想解釋6月的行為。李着辯方順時序發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱理解基本法50至53條為維持政府運作而設-即使否決仍可申臨時撥款&quot;&gt;施稱理解《基本法》50至53條為維持政府運作而設 即使否決仍可申臨時撥款&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示戴耀廷5月5日於《明報》的文章〈立會否決財政預算案的憲制設計〉，施解釋他5月8日收到戴草擬的九東協議最終版本，內有「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力」一句，便看不同文章去理解，包括這篇文章。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施引戴提及，憲制設計假設立法會有機會與特首和行政機關出現嚴重分歧，故「預先設計了解決的方法，就是把決定權交到選民手上」，並預設了否決、解散、重選、辭職的憲制安排。施認為戴作為《基本法》起草諮詢委員會委員和法律系副教授，與譚的理解相若，故相信戴的說法。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續引戴稱按《基本法》安排，即使預算案被否決，特首也不一定要解散立法會，可按第51條向立會申請臨時撥款，特首「仍可提出新的財政預算案，爭取立法會支持」；而若特首真的要解散立會，仍可在選出新的立會前，按上一財政年度開支標準批准臨時短期撥款，維持政府的一般運作。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施表示，理解《基本法》50至53條「係為政府能維持運作而設立」，即使運行條文的憲制程序，「政府仍然可以維持一定嘅運作。」李運騰指，但在本案，政府提出新的預算案並沒有幫助，因為否決不是基於預算案內容，而是「五大訴求」。施重申，因此解決危機其中一個方法是「由選民重選，由選民決定係特首啱、定係當時嘅泛民立法會議員啱，邊一邊比較合理」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱相信戴耀廷稱基於不同原因否決預算案屬基本法權力&quot;&gt;施稱相信戴耀廷稱基於不同原因否決預算案屬《基本法》權力&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示戴耀廷5月12日在《明報》的文章〈「支持否決」不能成為DQ理由——再論立會否決財政預算案的憲制設計〉，施引文中「基本法的條文並沒有規定立法會否決財政預算案只能單純因為財政預算案的內容」，而從基本法條文、起草討論和實際運作，「立法會議員有可能基於不同原因投票反對財政預算，是完全在基本法的條文之內，並不違背基本法的原意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施表示，他昨稱基於不同原因否決預算案都是《基本法》賦予的權力，是源於這篇文章，亦相信戴的看法。李運騰問，施當時意識到戴是定罪和正保釋候上訴的人嗎？施指當時無為意，以為戴已服完刑。施並指，因此據上述3篇文章，在之後提否決預算案時，他均認為是《基本法》賦予的權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施同意戴耀廷擅加否決權條款惟仍默許-因認同爭五大訴求亦認為無綑綁&quot;&gt;施同意戴耀廷擅加否決權條款惟仍默許 因認同爭五大訴求亦認為無綑綁&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，雖然否決權議題在協調會議無詳細討論，但戴仍放進了協調文件，作為會議最終的共識？施同意，並指之後「冇再開會亦都冇再更新過份文件」。李指若然如此，施認為戴擅自在協議上「僭建」，做法是遭人非議（objectionable）嗎？施指他在審訊聽取證供也有這種感覺，而案發時他則認為戴做法「可以有商榷」，但因他認同爭取五大訴求，亦認為該句無綑綁否決，故無提出反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰追問，施是否不只沒有反對，而是支持或默許該條款？施說：「5月份我係默許，6月份我仲進取咗𠻹」，解釋因6月份有「墨落無悔」出現，用詞比九東協議文件更「直接」，而他當時同意簽署「墨落」。李其後再次問，施感覺戴是將協調會議帶往某一個方向嗎？施稱看到文件提及否決權時「有呢個感覺」，而「我唔可以話跟隨佢（戴），不過我認同五大訴求要爭取」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱戴耀廷攬炒十步推論好錯認為否決財案僅談判籌碼&quot;&gt;施稱戴耀廷「攬炒十步」推論「好錯」、認為否決財案僅談判籌碼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施在李運騰詢問下，同意當時緊貼有關初選的報導，並有從九東群組收到戴耀廷兩篇文章的連結。施並在陳慶偉追問下指，有讀過戴4月28日的〈真攬炒十步 這是香港宿命〉，但戴3月的〈立會過半是大殺傷力憲制武器〉及4月的〈攬炒的定義和時間〉則沒看過，並認為〈真攬炒十步〉無指明與初選有關，他亦「唔係好相信」戴耀廷的推論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰遂問，九東協調文件加入了會上無詳細討論過的否決權條款，而施又讀過〈真攬炒十步〉，當時會認為已響起警號，戴意圖利用初選去實現自己的議程（agenda）、跟隨戴會帶來危險嗎？施重申，一直認為運用否決預算案的權力「只係一個談判策略同籌碼去爭取特首回應五大訴求，因為否決財政預算案本身不能達致五大訴求」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡追問，當施讀到〈真攬炒十步〉，不認為戴在轉變35+計劃的方向，他仍繼續參與其中不會擔心嗎？施重申認為戴文章推論「好錯」，特別就會大規模DQ和武力鎮壓的推論，「我都唔相信特區政府同中央政府會咁做，所以戴耀廷嘅政治文章我唔係太相信」，但他相信戴的法律文章，亦相信譚耀宗訪問。法官指，但譚是說民主派過半可癱瘓政府，引致憲政危機，施同意，但強調政府仍能運作，而譚亦沒有指否決預算案是違反《基本法》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱35願景包括爭取民生項目無想過真的用否決權&quot;&gt;施稱35+願景包括爭取民生項目、無想過真的用否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方再展示施德來5月設計的橫額，寫有「如果民主派在立法會議席過半，我們就有權力迫使政府立即推行失業援助金」，施確認就民主派過半和「迫使」等字眼有參考協議文件條款，不過用作「正面用途」，因當時認為民主派過半可做到有利民生事項，包括民協提倡多年的失業援助金。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施解釋他個人對35+的願景，指他期望民主派於立法會過半過半，令特首回應五大訴求，紓緩政府與市民間的矛盾；同時民生項目也「好重要」，「嗰刻我真係冇諗過否決財政預算案係真係會做嘅嘢，我一路都視為談判策略去演繹。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5U8EkdZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（11日）踏入審訊第83天。民協前主席施德來繼續作供，表示參選政綱以民生優先，但2020年6月「墨落無悔」出現令初選轉向政治的議題，他因而改變選舉部署，簽署「墨落」聲明並附在提名表格政綱，亦於初選論壇談及政治議題。施表示，當時有聲音指傳統民主派「輸打贏要」、初選落敗仍出選，加上民協常被批評左搖右擺和保守，故他刻意營造進取形象，望引起公眾關注和增加曝光。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟施強調，民協於初選期間的宗旨維持不變，他亦認為「墨落」無綑綁一定要否決。施亦同意，於提名表格附上額外簽署的「共同綱領」，指黃大仙區議員尤漢邦曾向他提及發布公開聲明，他同意並獲提供文件，後在民主動力黎敬輝要求下簽名提交。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱墨落無悔令初選轉向政治議題五大訴求早期並非計劃目標&quot;&gt;施稱「墨落無悔」令初選轉向政治議題、五大訴求早期並非計劃目標&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;民協前主席、前黃大仙區議員施德來繼續作供，指他4月開始選舉工程，民生為其議程，「不過6月份出現咗一啲變化影響咗我嘅選舉部署。」施解釋，戴耀廷和區諾軒於6月9日開記者會、之後出現「墨落無悔」聲明，「將初選嘅議題集中咗喺一啲政治嘅議題」；又指「墨落」出現前，公眾除贏輸機制外不知道協調會議有何共識，惟聲明出現後，聲明的兩點討論就「公眾層面化咗」、被公眾所知悉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰關注，但35+計劃一開始的重點就是政治而非民生，即爭取立會過半落實五大訴求。施回應，戴和區等人於3月25日召開的記者會「最重點係『6 6 4 4 3』」、即議會過半，「五大訴求唔係當刻嘅一個目標」；而九東作為首個開會的選區，首次會議第一項議題是討論參選資格，即「五大訴求」是界定誰可參選的界線，施認為早期時五大訴求並非初選計劃的「目標」。施同意民生從不是九東會議的重點，但仍是他個人對35+的願景。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱理解墨落雖較進取但非一定要否決因免被指輸打贏要而簽署&quot;&gt;施稱理解「墨落」雖較進取但非一定要否決、因免被指輸打贏要而簽署&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續表示，他6月10日晚獲民協同事告知有「墨落」聲明，於 Facebook 搜尋到其中一名發起人梁晃維的帖文，「有全篇睇晒。」施續指，聲明第一點「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，與他5月收到的九東協議文件相似，只是由「會積極運用」改為「會運用」，他理解是「相對進取啲」，「但係都冇一個叫一定要否決財政預算案，或者綑綁否決財政預算案嘅意思」。至於第二點指落敗便要停止選舉工程，「呢一點我都同意嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施重申，他當時「真係相信」否決財案是《基本法》賦予的憲制權力，亦視否決為爭取的策略，期望特首回應五大訴求解決社會矛盾；加上簽署前網上有說法是「傳統民主派會輸打贏要，輸咗初選都唔認數」，他認為會影響選舉工程、形象和選票，故推動他簽署。施並指，認為此原因甚至比起要求政府回應五大訴求更重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱即使墨落想綑綁仍會跟民協審議財案會與特首商五大訴求及民生議題&quot;&gt;施稱即使「墨落」想綑綁仍會跟民協審議財案、會與特首商五大訴求及民生議題&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來續指，如何啟明所說，事後在民協黨團的 WhatsApp 群組就聲明「有少少嘅討論」，並「交畀候選人去決定簽唔簽呢個聲明書」。陳仲衡問，即兩人中可一個簽、一個不簽？施承認如有此情況「可能唔係咁理想」，但當時交候選人決定，因簽署與否和初選的策略部署有關係，而聲明亦無綑綁一定要否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，施不覺得聲明是綑綁（bundle）候選人嗎？施指「即使佢想都好」，但民協有審議財政預算案的機制，他會跟民協決定，而當時預算案未發布，民協仍未有立場。李追問，但若否決目的是迫政府回應五大訴求，就不是取決於預算案內容做決定，那為何仍要待預算案發布？又指因為「無論預算案內容是什麼，你也會威脅否決預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施重申，因此他認為否決預算案的權力是一個「壓力」和談判籌碼，當民主派過半，「特首應該會睇到呢個民意有所回應」；從議員上任到財政預算案發布的半年間亦可進行磋商。李運騰指，但磋商也是關乎五大訴求，不是預算案，施指對他來說，「五大訴求同民生議題我都會同佢去傾。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方後展示施德來6月17日的街站相片，施稱當時籲選民提名他參與初選，提及政綱包括失業援助金等，而其橫額口號為「民生變革」，重申他以民生優先、望改善民生的目標沒有改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑簽聲明後帖文無提民生-施稱刻意談政治引公眾關注&quot;&gt;官質疑簽聲明後帖文無提民生 施稱刻意談政治引公眾關注&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續指，簽署前無向公眾解釋，但6月15日曾於 Facebook 發文提及，「承諾運用立法會權力，包括否決財政預算案的權力作抗爭，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，解釋因公眾較有反應，故刻意用政治議題引起公眾關注。李運騰屢質疑帖文無提民生，施同意，指當時公眾對「墨落」有興趣，故刻意談及政治題目，並強調他個人也認同爭取五大訴求，因可「解決政府同市民之間矛盾好重要嘅一個癥結」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方問，所以施當時真的想運用否決權迫政府回應五大訴求嗎？施重申否決權是籌碼，當然望特首有所回應，但他和民協都要「睇返財政預算案真實嘅內容，同埋對民生影響然後做最終決定」。法官陳慶偉澄清，即施德來「可能（may）」否決？施說：「我當時唔會，因為我未睇內容，要睇咗內容按民生需要、民協開會做決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來報名時刻意附墨落-為顯民主議題上進取形象&quot;&gt;施德來報名時刻意附「墨落」 為顯民主議題上進取形象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來於6月20日提交提名表格，並於政綱附上「墨落無悔」內容，及一幅寫有「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭 抗爭派立場聲明書」、「施德來 民協 何啟明」的圖片，施確認是直接借用何啟明轉發「墨落無悔」帖文時的配圖，事前沒有徵詢何；並指當初看到名字出現在何的配圖時不覺奇怪，因當時他和何亦同意簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施並解釋，於提名表格刻意附上「墨落」，是「想顯得我喺民主議題上嘅形象係進取一啲」，亦想強調初選落敗就不會參選。陳仲衡指，但該份聲明其他人都有簽署，展示內容不會令他比其他有簽的人更進取？施回應，故當時主要是處理民協形象，因常被指「左搖右擺」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱尤漢邦曾要求同意公開聲明後提供共同綱領惟候選人無就簽協議討論&quot;&gt;施稱尤漢邦曾要求同意公開聲明後提供「共同綱領」、惟候選人無就簽協議討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施在表格亦附上九龍東參選人簽署的「共同綱領」。施解釋，黃大仙素人區議員尤漢邦於6月14日致電他，表示要「整一份共同嘅公開聲明，要求我哋6位候選人同意」，他當時回答同意。尤續於6月19日將該份文件發給他，「我有睇晒佢嘅內容。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上早前透露，戴耀廷曾發訊息指九東由秘書處提出「共同綱領」，陳慶偉問所以文件是由該秘書處準備？施稱理解尤在秘書處工作，並指九東的 WhatsApp 群組在三次協調會議後便解散，其後時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻與並非參選的人士繼續推動九龍東初選，理解蔡領導該秘書處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ytBvkRZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 蔡澤鴻&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;庭上早前亦指，區諾軒曾於6月14日在組織者群組轉述蔡澤鴻訊息，稱九龍東開會後「認為有必要發布一份公開協議，說明至少五大訴求缺一不可之類承諾基本有」，並要由大會認可。被問有否討論應簽書面協議，施指「九龍東候選人冇呢個討論」，亦不知道該訊息的內容；但尤6月14日曾向他提及五大訴求、初選贏輸機制和要公開一份聲明，施則回應「你有個文字版本再畀我睇啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱民動黎敬輝要求下提交共同綱領同意綱領但非會上共識&quot;&gt;施稱民動黎敬輝要求下提交共同綱領、同意綱領但非會上共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來並指，於6月20日報名時沒有提交共同綱領，「我當時冇認為呢一份文件同初選嘅主辦單位民主動力相關」，惟他交表後翌日，即6月21日收到時任民動總幹事黎敬輝電話，「佢話要收埋呢份文件嘅簽名本」，他遂於手機手寫板簽署並發給黎。陳慶偉問，故施簽該份文件不是因為九東參與者達成的共識，而是因為黎敬輝的指示？施同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施在李運騰追問下，同意他收到共同綱領後有兩日時間閱讀，而他簽署是代表他同意。施並指，認為尤的共同綱領是參考了戴耀廷「35+九東final」的協議文件，因有用「會積極運用」否決權「迫使特首回應五大訴求」等字眼，亦有提初選的贏輸機制。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就提名表格上，「確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識」，施稱認為是三次九東協調會議上傾談的內容或認同的地方，而他當時沒想到是指九東協議文件最終版本，但亦不反對包括該文件。施亦認為，「共同綱領」提到會積極運用否決權並非會上共識，但有「彈性」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱因墨落帶起公眾關注否決權-遂於論壇刻意營造進取形象&quot;&gt;施稱因「墨落」帶起公眾關注否決權 遂於論壇刻意營造進取形象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來在主問下稱，由4月開始，有兩位民協會員許錦成和歐陽東、及兩位職員為他助選。辯方其後欲就施與團隊如何商討競選計劃發問，指想反映施的改變；惟李運騰認為只須知道改變的原因。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續同意，他於選舉論壇頗為進取（progressive），指「我有刻意營造嘅」，是「選舉策略」的表現，因預備論壇時要視乎當時選舉氣氛，而他與團隊開會都有留意當時「墨落無悔」帶起的社會討論，即運用否決權迫使特首回應五大訴求，在6月中成為公眾關注的議題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問其論壇發言是否黨的立場？施否認，稱是其選舉策略的部署。李運騰指施曾稱參選不為勝出而為宣傳，這樣如何有助宣傳？施回應，在九東「我個人本身就冇乜知名度，我需要做一啲嘢去引起公眾關注討論、增加曝光率」，而民協很多時予人保守感覺，到了6月中「政治浪潮」湧起，其定位難以獲民主派選民支持，故望「做啲嘢去改變民協嘅形象」，加上「我當時相信我講嘅言論真係《基本法》畀我嘅權力」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱與何啟明競選團隊無溝通論壇提政治為計劃內&quot;&gt;施稱與何啟明競選團隊無溝通、論壇提政治為計劃內&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，即若施當選，他無意實踐其宣言？施表示：「我唔係去否決財政預算案，但係我會同林鄭去傾就五大訴求應該要有所回應，因為呢個係我一路講解決市民同政府之間矛盾嘅癥結。」陳追問，那他想當選多於一屆嗎？施重申認為自己無勝算，但與民協一直積極參選，因認為對選民的承諾是爭取五大訴求，會積極向林鄭反映；但也指如能當選，當然希望能連任、亦望培育民協成員當選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，故他是準備好改變黨格取悅選民？施稱是按選舉氣氛而調整，指6、7月時「比較關係緊張，我哋就會表現得進取啲」，因面對「選舉需要」，並指初選期間，民協的目標和宗旨一直不變，而他與何啟明並無討論或溝通，指兩邊團隊獨立運作、兩邊選舉工程和地區特色各不同，會按選區特性制定策略。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續確認，就論壇開頭的自我介紹，他有計劃發言內容，目標是要展現一個進取的形象，「所以喺預定嘅時候，我唔係講民生嘢，而係講一啲政治議題，呢個都係我計劃裡面嘅。」辯方其後欲展示論壇發言謄本，惟因技術問題未能成功，案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）踏入審訊第82天。參與九龍東初選的民協前主席施德來開始作供，稱2005年起於民協工作，民協宗旨包括「擁護中國主權，落實一國兩制」，從創黨至2020年都沒有改變。施又指任區議員時一直與不同政府部門溝通協作，雖不滿時任特首林鄭月娥處理2019年社運的手法，但認為「民生好重要」，仍會與她聯絡反映民生意見；又指2016年民協失去所有立法會議席，他參選望為民協「贏得返一個議席」，令立法會內有重視民生的聲音。被問2020年時認為與政府的理性溝通是否仍可行和可取，施稱「我唔知道，盡力去做囉」。此外，法官今表示料所有辯方案情能於8月底完成，辯方提出預留9月最後兩星期進行結案陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官料8月底完成所有辯方案情-辯方擬留9月兩星期結案陳詞&quot;&gt;官料8月底完成所有辯方案情 辯方擬留9月兩星期結案陳詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;甫開庭，代表黃碧雲和林卓廷的大律師沈士文表示，現時7名被告已完成案情，尚餘9名被告，而9月25日法官李運騰將參與另一宗案件的審訊（黎智英《蘋果日報》案），望法庭能先預定結案陳詞的時間。沈並指按目前進度，預計8月底會完成所有辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指現時未能決定，會給予雙方時間準備結案陳詞，但對8月底前完成抱有希望（hopeful）；李運騰亦指會給予時間，雖另案於9月25日開審，但會以本案優先，完成本案所有案情和陳詞後，另一宗案件才開審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;沈士文提議預留9月最後兩個星期進行結案陳詞，李運騰指預料各方最少需要一個星期或以上，陳慶偉指5天是不切實際，現時亦不能作出承諾，但在日程安排上會盡量透明。他亦提醒除了不認罪被告，尚有認罪被告，有人尚未同意所有案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施德來開始作供-稱民協宗旨為擁護中國主權改善民生&quot;&gt;施德來開始作供 稱民協宗旨為「擁護中國主權」、「改善民生」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前民協主席、黃大仙區議員施德來其後開始作供，他身穿西裝，以基督教宣誓，接受大律師黃廷光主問。施於1982年出生於香港，2010年結婚，育有一名9歲兒子，並確認2005年於城市大學社工副學士畢業，2007年取得雪菲爾哈倫大學（Sheffield Hallam University）的社會科學學位，2018年於理工大學取得社工碩士，太太同為社工。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施稱2005年大學畢業後，首份全職工作是在民協為創會會員譚國僑任社區幹事，主要負責深水埗公屋重建計劃，與政府部門開會、與居民講解計劃；他2008年加入民協成為會員，2010年成為民協中央委員，2016年1月成為民協副主席，並於同年12月改選成為民協主席，2018年連任。施亦於2015年當選黃大仙東美區議員，2019年連任，而他2021年3月於本案獲法庭保釋後，為遵守保釋條件便請辭主席，仍保留會員身分，並於同年7月9日辭任區議員，一個月後開始任社工至今，負責九龍城區劏房家庭服務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Z3EJMfy.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 民協創會會員 譚國僑&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施解釋，當初選擇加入民協，因修讀社工時認識到很多基層和居民的需要，而他認知民協重視基層服務，2005年時有四成會員都是社工出身。而施參與民協過程認知到三點民協的宗旨和信念：一，擁護中國主權，落實一國兩制，為民協1986年成立目的；二，促進民主，改善民生，是民協30年來的宗旨信念；三，服務基層，透過社會資源再分配，改善基層生活，因此大部分民協區議員均於較多公屋或長者的地區服務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡指，但民協不是一個人，其宗旨取決於會員和管理者。施解釋，因此民協一直採用類似「師徒制」，會員跟從資深區議員工作，可在過程認知民協宗旨和工作手法。而民協於1986年成立，他有讀過民協的會章，要按會章做事，他2006年負責民協20周年特刊亦曾翻閱很多民協歷史。此時法官李運騰打斷，指「那些都已成過去，我們關注的是2020年的情況」，又指「我不知道他們1980年代的宗旨和目標到2020年是否還一樣」，着辯方加快主問速度。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱民協2016年失議席和支持仍接任主席-因認同民協重視民生價值&quot;&gt;施稱民協2016年失議席和支持仍接任主席 因認同民協重視民生價值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續在主問下指，2010年任民協中央委員時約有100位會員，惟法官陳慶偉打斷，問為何要知道案發前10年的事，李運騰亦指若想說證人有良好品格，相信已有足夠證據。施並談及接任民協主席經過，指2016年立法會選舉民協失去所有議席，傳媒不再關注、公眾支持度亦下跌，亦因失議席令支援減少，當時18名區議員中有三分一退出民協。而施當時仍接任主席，因他自2005年畢業起參與民協，認同民協重視民生、為基層服務，「我整個從政嘅經歷都係民協，所以我繼續留喺民協。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱任區議員憑實事做信念-曾寫信感謝警察及與林鄭溝通&quot;&gt;施稱任區議員憑實事做信念 曾寫信感謝警察及與林鄭溝通&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示施2019年參選區議會的政綱，參選感言提及民協實事為本，致力為基層及弱勢出力，監察政府施政；政綱亦很多與基層權益相關，如增建公屋、全民退休保障、重啟政改落實普選行政長官，施強調他「一直都憑住實事做信念，務實去為社區服務」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施並指，認為區議員是市民與政府間的橋樑，角色是與不同政府部門溝通協作、反映意見，若政府部門做得好會寫信嘉許，辯方呈上施2018年寫信感謝香港警務處，施解釋當時居民反映區內有毒品問題，他向警民關係科報告後，警方便採取行動，施並指在5年多任期內約寫了10封信予不同政府部門。施又指，任內最大成就是成功爭取黃大仙美東邨重建，辯方展示相片，可見2017年林鄭月娥上任10日到黃大仙區議會，施曾向她遞信反映，並稱之後一直保持溝通，「我認為溝通好重要。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續指，到了2020年初選期間，民協政治立場沒有改變，在民生上繼續為基層和弱勢發聲出力，他亦堅守民協重視民生服務的信念，繼續推動舊區公屋重建計劃、回購領展和全民退休保障。施亦於2020年4月就黃大仙美東邨重建戶的經濟補貼寫信予時任特首林鄭月娥和政務司司長張建宗，反映居民搬遷問題，亦獲政府回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再次質疑問題與案件的關係，指「我們為什麼要知道？這是他作為區議員應做的工作」。黃廷光指是反映施重視民生和與政府有良好關係，李運騰指已有相關證據，並指「不是所有你在審訊做的事都能協助你」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱不滿林鄭處理2019年社運手法雖政治爭拗但民生仍會溝通&quot;&gt;施稱不滿林鄭處理2019年社運手法、雖政治爭拗但民生仍會溝通&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問2020年對林鄭月娥的表現是否滿意，施德來稱「我認為特首係可以多啲聆聽民意，改善施政」，作為議員就盡力反映；至於對林鄭就2019年處理社會運動的手法，「我係不滿嘅，但係雖然政治會有爭拗，但民生好重要，我都仍然會同佢聯絡，反映民生意見。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來表示，2020年參選立法會初選，是望協助民協於立法會內「贏得返一個議席」，但承認「九龍東其實係好困難嘅」。李運騰指，但他沒有放棄希望？施說：「係啦，可以咁講啦，感謝法官閣下。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，那若他當選，他認為與政府保持溝通和工作關係也是重要的？施同意，重這是他一直參選和參與民協的信念，加上民協在民主派定位為「重視民生」，故望立法會內有重視民生的聲音。他亦指他和民協當時也願與政府就政治議題溝通，但因無立法會議席，故「基本上好難溝通得到」，但2019年社運未到衝突很劇烈前，民協有參與過一些聯署，「希望雙方都冷靜啲去處理事件。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，2020年時，施認為與政府的合理理性商討和溝通仍是可行和可取的嗎？施說：「我唔知道，盡力去做囉⋯⋯」，並在李追問下，確認民協擁護一國兩制及中國主權的立場，由創黨直至2020年均沒有改變。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱4月獲民協通過參選-提出以民生優先為參選方向&quot;&gt;施稱4月獲民協通過參選 提出以「民生優先」為參選方向&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來續講述參與初選經過，表示就2020年立法會選舉，民協先舉行會內提名程序，他於3月7日報名九東，何啟明則報名九西。民協其後於4月13日進行投票，通過二人參選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/c2sFntm.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何啟明&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方展示3月28日的民協黨團會議紀錄，報告事項提及有兩人積極考慮參選，即他和何啟明，並提及就參選方向「民協九東方向會以民生優先，並希望稍後重啟九東初選的討論」。施確認該方向是由他提出，因「我一直參與民協，都係重視民生，我希望立法會裡面有重視民生嘅聲音」，尤其當時疫情下多人失業，他也有提出不同相關政策。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官問他是否想九東重啟初選，施解釋因當時九東第二次會議決定用棄選機制，但未討論細節，會再多開一次會議商討，故他想將民生議題「擺落九龍東」；後確認民協一直支持民主派舉行初選，認為不論公民投票或民調棄選均能增加民主派勝算。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施於藍田派單張稱深入敵陣-解釋為工聯會票源望搶支持屬誇張用詞&quot;&gt;施於藍田派單張稱「深入敵陣」 解釋為工聯會票源望搶支持、屬誇張用詞&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來同意，選舉期間「民生」是他主要關注，而他於4月開始立法會選舉工程。控方展示一張單張，寫有「公益金及時抗疫基金 成功申請每戶可獲2千至1萬元」、「立即推行失業援助金，回水俾番我份強積金」，施確認單張由他設計，於4月至7月派發，但無提到初選或立法會選舉，因當時未知初選會否舉行。但施補充，單張在申請詳情除黃大仙外亦有列出觀塘地點，指是為初選而設。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示5月7日的帖文，顯示施德來於藍田站派發該份單張，提及爭取失業援助金和推廣培訓局課程，並有「#民主派初選」、「#民生變革」等 hashtag。施解釋，九東於5月4日第三次會議確定進行公民投票，故其後有就初選進行宣傳，「民生變革」是其選舉口號。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施又解釋，於藍田站派發是因他要參選九東初選，而民協在觀塘區並無區議員，故要刻意去當區開街站宣傳。陳仲衡關注他使用「#深入敵陣」的hashtag，施解釋當時藍田是工聯會紮根的選區，「工聯會係做基層、民生、勞工，我代表民協要搶支持，我就會去呢一啲區，因為個票源同民協相近。」陳慶偉指，即他視工聯會為「敵人」而非單單是競爭對手？施重申從選票角度，兩者在民生票是最相近，而選舉會用一些較形象化和誇張的形容詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官追問，但工聯會無參與初選，施在藍田想搶誰的選票？施解釋，藍田區並無民主派代表，「如果初選，佢哋係唔會出嚟投票嘅，或者叫做比較少人會走出嚟投票啦，所以喺選舉策略度我覺得我去藍田區係容易搵到支持嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱望35後可表達民生訴求&quot;&gt;施稱望35+後可表達民生訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續指示另一幅橫額，寫有「爭取設立失業援助金，回水俾番我份強積金，派發現金及消費券，落實全民退休保障」及「拉闊民主派光譜，同創35+奇跡」。施確認於4月28日製作了5張，4至7月份懸掛，解釋望民主派取得過半、且光譜雖闊但要有民生聲音，而上述4點是關於預算案或法例修改，望過半後能於議會內表達出來。施並確認，橫額於黃大仙展示，亦會帶去觀塘街站。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/KRw4423.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（10日）踏入審訊第82天。參選九龍東的民協前主席施德來作供，承認自己「冇乜勝算」、民協予人感覺「騎牆」，參選是望增民協知名度和改善形象；又指2020年6月初選議題較政治化，故自己「企得硬咗」，以選舉語言增曝光，惟與民協和自己一貫做法不符，同意是「鬥黃」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施又稱，無印象九東協調會議討論過否決權，而他確認收過協調文件，但不知否決權條款如何加入。就協議提「會積極運用」否決權迫特首回應五大訴求，施稱理解「積極」無綑綁一定要運用，又認為「基於不同原因」否決是《基本法》賦權。法官陳慶偉質疑，《基本法》無提可迫特首回應五大訴求，又指若否決的原因不恰當便非恰當地運用權力，正如法官不能隨意判人有罪無罪，並一度以議員受賄否決為例。惟施反駁，《基本法》無寫明議員須基於預算案內容才能否決，而要求特首回應五大訴求是恰當的原因否決財案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施認參選九東冇乜勝算-望宣傳自己及民協&quot;&gt;施認參選九東「冇乜勝算」 望宣傳自己及民協&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前民協主席、黃大仙區議員施德來繼續作供，被問參選原因，施解釋無論初選抑或正式選舉，他都會想代表民協出選九龍東，「因為參與選舉可以增加知名度同埋改善民協形象」，他亦想推動一些民生政策。施並解釋，由於他勝算本身不高，而相比正式大選一般有逾十個候選人，初選候選人較少，會較容易做到宣傳。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡指，但競選工程的目的是勝出立法會選舉，而不只是宣傳。施回應：「好現實咁講，喺九龍東呢，我係冇乜勝算嘅」，但指每次選舉都是「宣傳自己同埋自己所屬嘅政黨」的機會，亦可為下一屆選舉做部署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施續解釋，民主派在九東從來都不多議席，在5席一直只取兩席，他當時估計兩位現任議員譚文豪和胡志偉均會競逐連任，加上有前一屆高票落敗的譚得志、與黃之鋒參選，故估計自己勝算不高。陳仲衡即指，但黃之鋒被DQ，不獲准參選。施同意，故指在九東協調會議「一直最難處理嘅問題就係替補機制」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施認6月隨議題政治化鬥黃-指民協內涵不變但用選舉語言望增曝光率&quot;&gt;施認6月隨議題政治化「鬥黃」 指民協內涵不變但用「選舉語言」望增曝光率&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問，既然如此，施德來競選時並不需要採用選舉語言宣傳自己？施稱「部分正確」，補充選舉很多時是政黨形象塑造的機會，而民協有自身優點和缺點，「於是選舉上我哋都會有一啲形象技巧同埋選舉語言去配合當時嘅選舉處境。」李運騰追問，即是更新或改變民協形象？施指是「改善」，因民協予人感覺「騎牆」和「弱勢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問，但改善會涉及改變，那該新的形象到底只是一個「虛假的外表」（façade），抑或也包括改變黨的政治立場？施指政治立場「可以好長歷史」，但「每一屆選舉有佢嘅選舉氣氛同議題，我哋要就住個選舉氣氛同議題有一啲調整」；又指「內涵係不變嘅」，正如他一直參與民協是以服務社區和民生為重，但立法會有較闊的層面處理，「有啲形象工程要配合嗰個選舉需要。」施又稱，民協重視溝通和與政府協作爭取是「不變」，但初選6月份議題「比較政治化」，「我喺發言同選舉策略嘅部署都變得會企得硬咗嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/mWEtCpr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再追問，即該些語言與民協過往的做法不符？施同意「有唔吻合」，並補充「唔單止民協，亦同我自己一貫嘅做法都唔同嘅」。陳仲衡問，施當時是進入「鬥黃」的比賽？施同意，但補充指有「時間性」，指4至6月時「冇咁強烈呢種需要」。李再次問，若施德來參與初選只為宣傳而非勝出，那為何需使用選舉語言，不直接說出民協的理念和做法？施表示，最主要因當他無勝算時，「其實傳媒唔會報導，民協講民生議題，難以受到關注」，故他做了一些調整、使用選舉語言，望增加曝光率。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱獲民協撥款10萬僅用7萬-稱認知九東無勝算不會要求加資源&quot;&gt;施稱獲民協撥款10萬僅用7萬 稱認知九東無勝算不會要求加資源&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就參選資金，施指民協在4月通過派出自己和何啟明參與立法會選舉，當時何獲分配20萬元，施則獲分配10萬元。後來何的撥款增加，而施則在九東選區使用7萬元，直至選舉完結。被問為何有此分別，施表示「無論係我同民協都會認知，九龍西我哋係比較有勝算嘅。我都知道我喺九龍東基本上冇乜勝算，所以我都唔會要求增加資源」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;橫額稱迫政府推失業援助金-施選舉語言過半可增議價力惟最終決定仍在政府&quot;&gt;橫額稱迫政府推失業援助金 施：選舉語言、過半可增議價力惟最終決定仍在政府&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示施德來5月設計的一款橫額，寫有「如果民主派在立法會議席過半，我們就有權力迫使政府立即推行失業援助金」，施解釋民主派過半可做有利民生的事情，他望失業援助金加入預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問到為何用「迫使」，施指民主派在立法會一直是少數派，功能組別和建制派很多時會阻撓民生政策，如民主派過半便可連結其他民主派議員爭取落實，而當時用了一些強烈的字眼。至於橫額中「民生要反抗 奪回自主權」，施解釋指是民協改善民生的宗旨及在議會可有更多權力，但因「選舉需要」亦用了選舉語言，字眼較強烈。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰問，施如何迫使政府設立失業援助金？施表示議員無權推動涉財政撥款的項目，但認為民主派過半可增加議價能力，做惠及基層的事情，民協亦會與政府溝通協商，但最終決定權仍在政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問九東協調會議有沒有人對民生議題有興趣，施指他曾參與的3次協調會議均無討論過相關議題，他亦沒提出，因非協調會議的討論焦點；但民協過往一直有連同其他民主派政黨爭取失業援助金，包括社民連和民主黨。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱無印象協調會議討論否決權-不知運用否決權條款如何加入協議文件&quot;&gt;施稱無印象協調會議討論否決權 不知運用否決權條款如何加入協議文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來續指，就他出席的3次協調會議，他均無印象有討論否決預算案。至於相關文件，施指無印象首次會議有傳閱「35+計劃」文件，但事後看審訊文件夾，得悉會議上有按該份文件相若的內容作討論。而3月2日首次會議後，他曾收到時任觀塘區議會主席蔡澤鴻發出的協調文件初稿，但沒有運用否決權一點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施並於第三次會議後的5月8日，再收到蔡澤鴻發出名為「35+九東final」的「民主派九東協調機制協議」文件，他有打開並「睇晒裡面嘅內容」，但就第二點「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」，他不知道如何加入文件，因無印象第三次或之前的會議有討論。法官陳慶偉一度指，區諾軒稱戴耀廷首次會議已提及否決權，惟施德來指記得區諾軒是說戴不遲於第三次會議有討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱理解積極運用無綑綁意思非一定要運用&quot;&gt;施稱理解「積極運用」無綑綁意思、非一定要運用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施德來並指，就否決權條款，他理解「積極運用」的字眼沒有「綑綁」的意思，即「唔係一定要用，但係會考慮去迫政府回應五大訴求」；而他「冇反對」亦沒在群組出聲。施重申，認為「積極運用」無綑綁和一定要否決的意思，亦相信《基本法》真的賦予立法會相關權力，指根據第50至53條的立法原意和條文內容，「基於唔同原因否決財政預算案都係《基本法》賦予嘅權力。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;施又稱自己對《基本法》有一些認識，應考過有《基本法》部分的公務員招聘考試、知道區議員職能是源於《基本法》第97條、2019年參選區議會曾簽署確認書確認擁護《基本法》，就基本法賦予立法會的權力亦在一些文章看過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;施稱基本法無寫明基於財案內容方可否決-官質疑原因不恰當便非恰當用權&quot;&gt;施稱《基本法》無寫明基於財案內容方可否決 官質疑原因不恰當便非恰當用權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟法官陳慶偉指，《基本法》只談及否決預算案的程序和結果，沒有提及「迫使政府回應五大訴求」，又指施不是試圖游說（persuade）特首回應訴求，而是「迫使」（force）。施重申，他理解《基本法》賦予立法會的權力包括否決預算案迫特首回應五大訴求，又指雖《基本法》無提及「五大訴求」，但據第50至53條的立法原意、條文內容和否決預算案的原因，基於不同原因否決預算案均是源自上述條文的憲制權力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉追問，所以施認為議員可基於任何原因和動機否決預算案？施指理解「要有一個原因」，而該原因可以與財政預算案相關或不相關。陳追問，即使該原因是完全不恰當（totally improper）也可以？施回答：「我認為《基本法》冇寫明一定要基於財政預算案嘅內容而否決。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉着施回答其問題，施稱「可能要具體啲」。陳續說，假設他是一名腐敗的議員，他收取賄款而否決又可以嗎？惟施即指收賄款已違反了另一些法例。陳指他只是按施的回應提問，再問若原因不恰當是否可以否決？並指《基本法》也沒寫明不可收賄款。施回應「我分唔到邊啲叫恰當不恰當」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再問那收賄款是否「恰當」？施稱「嗰個我覺得唔關否決原因事…佢係其他嘅法例問題，犯咗其他法」。陳明言這只是一個很簡單的問題，「不要理會法律，只是用常識（“forget about law, just simply use common sense”）」，施續指「所以佢要有一個原因提出嚟囉，五大訴求呢個係一個原因嚟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉聞言指出，《基本法》賦予議員否決權，但該權力必須恰當及合法地運用，任何不恰當的原因都不能視作恰當地運用權力；正如一名法官有很多權力，但必須合法及恰當地運用，不能無差別或隨意地裁定被告有罪或無罪，「此情況都適用於立法會議員，不是嗎？」施回應：「所以我會認為，特首回應五大訴求係佢權力下恰當嘅原因嚟。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明天續審。&lt;/p&gt;

In the short term, AUKUS could improve interoperability among its partners in realms such as electronic warfare (EW) and command and control (C2). In the longer term, AUKUS could catalyze the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies among its partners and into defense and security applications — but only if these countries act now to harmonize their approaches and consult experts. To realize the full potential of Pillar Two, the United States should reassure its AUKUS partners by taking radical steps to overcome barriers to cooperation, improve information sharing, and reform export controls. Above all, the success of AUKUS Pillar Two will depend on turning the strong political ties between the three nations into a new collective mindset to treat the agreement as an opportunity to find marginal — or even transformative — gains in the strategic competition with China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“AUKUS, as you all know, involves two pillars. Pillar I – providing Australia with a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability … and Pillar II – trilaterally developing and providing joint advanced military capabilities. … is a generational opportunity for deeper collaboration with two of our closest allies. … [But] make no mistake – the success of AUKUS is not predetermined – it must be built.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;-jessica-lewis-us-assistant-secretary-of-state-for-political-military-affairs-testimony-to-the-house-foreign-affairs-committee-may-24-2023&quot;&gt;– Jessica Lewis, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, Testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, May 24, 2023&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 15, 2021, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States announced a landmark trilateral security agreement known as AUKUS. The centerpiece of AUKUS, known as “Pillar One,” is the delivery of a nuclear-powered attack submarine capability to Australia. This historic agreement — the first time the United States has shared its sensitive nuclear-propulsion technology with an ally since the 1958 Mutual Defense Agreement with the United Kingdom — was the focus of global media coverage following the announcement. Paris and Beijing both reacted acidly to the deal (albeit for different reasons). Progress on this pillar was seen in March 2023, when the leaders of the three AUKUS nations converged on Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego, California, to announce a pathway toward a trilaterally developed submarine, the SSN-AUKUS class. Less attention has been given to Pillar Two of the agreement, “the lesser-known – and poorly understood – part of AUKUS.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Pillar One was historic, then Pillar Two promises to be revolutionary. According to the bureaucratic language of the AUKUS announcement, the purpose of Pillar Two is to “enhance our joint capabilities and interoperability.” Yet the scope of the original agreement was massive, covering “cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea capabilities.” A few months later, four more areas were added to these “advanced capabilities:” hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities, EW, innovation, and information sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individually, each area of Pillar Two has game-winning potential in the strategic competition with China. Taken together, they could be game-changing, securing the future military and economic advantage of the AUKUS nations and recasting the nature of this competition for global influence. As an article by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) puts it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“There’s a growing realisation that emerging and critical technologies will be extraordinarily important for societies, economies and national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is making the race to master them a geopolitical issue. And nowhere is this race more contested than in the Indo-Pacific region, which incubates much of the world’s technological innovation and has become a hotbed of strategic technological competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pillar Two may have arrived just in time. In March 2023, ASPI released an ongoing assessment of global leadership in developing the technologies that will be critical to the strategic competition for economic and strategic influence. A June update to their assessment suggests China is ahead of the United States and its allies in 19 of the 23 technologies relevant to AUKUS Pillar Two. Driven by its goal to become the leading global technology and scientific superpower by 2050, “China has become a serious competitor in the foundational technologies of the 21st century: artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, quantum information science (QIS), semiconductors, biotechnology, and green energy.” Pillar Two holds the potential to focus Washington D.C., London, and Canberra on the problem of the technological competition with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the announcement in March of the Pillar One pathway toward the SSN-AUKUS submarine, Pillar Two may now become the main focus of AUKUS given its transformational potential. In fact, Pillar Two has already turned the political rhetoric of AUKUS into practical deliverables — as seen in May 2023, when the United Kingdom hosted the first AUKUS technology demonstration, which reportedly achieved several “world firsts” for swarming uncrewed “AI-enabled assets.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite the significance of Pillar Two — and in contrast to Pillar One — little information has been released to date on its content and progress beyond lists of topics and names of working groups. Pillar Two was not even mentioned during the AUKUS leaders’ announcement in March. This brief aims to fill some of this conversation gap through a closer examination of three aspects of Pillar Two. First, it examines the potential for short-term interoperability gains among the AUKUS nations in the EW and information-sharing focus areas. Second, it analyzes the potential — including challenges and opportunities — for AUKUS to pioneer the integration of AI into military operations. Finally, it sets out three key barriers to achieving the potential of Pillar Two and discusses what it will take to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;h4 id=&quot;key-advanced-capabilities-highlighted-in-aukus-pillar-two&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Key Advanced Capabilities Highlighted in AUKUS Pillar Two&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Undersea capabilities, particularly developing autonomous underwater vehicles through the AUKUS Undersea Robotics Autonomous Systems (AURAS) project, which aims to begin initial trials and experimentation in 2023.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Quantum technologies, with the partners aiming to deliver “generation-after-next quantum capabilities” through the AUKUS Quantum Arrangement (AQuA). Their initial focus is on positioning, navigation, and timing technology, which will be integrated in trials and experimentation over the next three years.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AI and autonomy, using these technologies to improve the speed and precision of decisionmaking processes and defend against AI-enabled threats. In this sphere, the initial focus is on adoption and resilience of autonomous and AI-enabled systems in contested environments.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Advanced cyber capabilities, particularly to protect critical communications and operations systems.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities, for which the partners are focused on accelerating development.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EW, with a primary focus on improving interoperability through a shared understanding of tools, techniques, and technology for operation in contested and degraded environments.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Innovation, which partners aim to achieve by accelerating defense innovation, learning from each other, and integrating commercial technology.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Information Sharing, particularly to enable other Pillar Two workstreams by expanding and accelerating the sharing of sensitive information.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-near-term-promise-of-pillar-two-enhancing-interoperability&quot;&gt;The Near-Term Promise of Pillar Two: Enhancing Interoperability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AUKUS Pillar Two can be used to deliver the quick wins necessary to ensure the immediate success of the agreement and increase member countries’ collective technological advantages. Specifically, this can be achieved in the areas of EW and C2, where enhanced interoperability among partners could yield quick wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;electronic-warfare&quot;&gt;Electronic Warfare&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant linkages already exist among the AUKUS parties regarding EW, but further advancements can be unlocked through AUKUS. Currently, the Australia, Canada, and United Kingdom Reprogramming Laboratory (ACURL) located at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, conducts agile EW reprogramming for F-35 aircraft from Australia and the United Kingdom. In concept, Canada will also use the lab once it purchases its own F-35s. Also located at Eglin and sharing connections with the ACURL is the U.S. Air Force’s 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing (SWW), whose mission is to “deliver adaptive and cutting-edge electromagnetic spectrum capabilities that provide the warfighter a tactical and strategic competitive advantage and freedom to attack, maneuver, and defend.” This includes EW reprogramming of all U.S. F-35 aircraft through the 513th Electronic Warfare Squadron (EWS). Being in the same location with the same mission would seem to indicate a level of cooperation and crossflow, yet due to existing regulations it is extremely difficult for engineers from the EWS and the ACURL to collaborate — if they are even able to at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the complex nature of competition and conflict in the electromagnetic spectrum, SWW was formed as a “first of its kind” wing to connect “pockets of excellence” in EW. While it has made great strides in reforming the EW reprogramming process within the United States, it remains unable to connect those pockets of excellence that exist between the closest of allies. AUKUS Pillar Two is crucial to breaking through these barriers to connect systems across the tripartite agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, as potential adversaries have been making large technological advancements within the electromagnetic spectrum, this connectivity will become even more important — even outside the realm of reprogramming. Developing concepts and technologies such as electromagnetic battle management (EMBM) and cognitive EW will be critical to future operations in a contested electromagnetic spectrum. EMBM is a comprehensive framework for dynamically monitoring, assessing, planning, and directing operations in the electromagnetic spectrum in support of the commander’s concept of operations. Cognitive EW is the use of AI and machine learning to speed up and enhance electromagnetic spectrum operations. The end result of both concepts is a distributed, networked, and adaptive electronic attack. Current operations are providing important intel and highlighting the need for such networked systems, which cannot be limited to one partner within the AUKUS. Pillar Two should be used to break down those barriers now to enable operational synergy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The partner nations can begin by taking two rather simple steps. The first is to overcome classification hurdles. While this is key to all aspects of AUKUS and is discussed at length below, it bears mention in relation to EW. EW systems are based on accurate and reliable intelligence and information sharing. If AUKUS partner nations are all working with different levels of information, their EW systems will never fully integrate. For example, much of U.S. EW technology and material is currently buried behind a Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals (NOFORN) classification, leading to two-tiered structures such as the F-35 reprogramming. To truly integrate and share EW techniques, the AUKUS nations need to establish an open classification caveat between the three nations in such realms of high technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the AUKUS nations should work together to establish standardized open system architecture (OSA) standards, which are increasingly important now that software updates are part of almost all military equipment. No longer can the three nations allow software to be “vendor locked” to the original hardware contractor, which drives a multitude of software-standard and integration problems across systems. This is an area where the United States has attempted to enact some reforms, but this has resulted in a proliferation of OSA standards. The U.S. Air Force, the service with perhaps the most advanced technology, has many different standards of its own. The U.S. Army has been focused on its Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C5ISR)/Electronic Warfare Modular Open Suite of Standards (CMOSS). Meanwhile, a civilian consortium has developed the Sensor Open Systems Architecture (SOSA), which has lately been taking hold in the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). To avoid having to navigate multiple standards, the three nations should determine together — and soon — which OSA to subscribe to for future acquisitions so they can ensure interoperability and technique sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command-and-control&quot;&gt;Command and Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much as with EW, networked operations and information sharing are also required for C2. The United States, United Kingdom, and Australia have been conducting combined allied operations since World War I. Even as the pace of operations has increased — as have the number of domains in which conflict can occur, including space and cyberspace — the three allies have remained linked in their C2 doctrine, training, and (in some cases) systems. This has allowed them to be extremely successful when they operate as a combined force. As the AUKUS countries move from traditional, domain-specific C2 constructs to a cross-domain model reliant on new concepts and technologies, these linkages need to remain for the allies to be successful. The same barriers that exist in the EW realm also threaten future integration of C2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding new concepts for C2, the United Kingdom and Australia should be included in U.S.-conducted training on all-domain C2 so that all AUKUS partners start with a common baseline. The current premier training program is the C2 Warrior Advanced Course (C2WAC). Thus far, this has been a U.S.-only offering, but the other AUKUS allies should be brought in under Pillar Two. Additionally, the AUKUS partners should be more fully integrated in the air domain as the U.S. Air Force implements its Agile Combat Employment (ACE) concept, which is meant to provide force survivability and operational C2 in a contested environment. Many of the details of the concept are rightly classified to retain operational surprise and flexibility, but AUKUS allies should be more integrated into the planning and execution of the concept so they can fully take advantage of it, especially in the Indo-Pacific. This should entail holding open discussions on capabilities and limitations, conducting combined training, and developing common pre-positioned kits of fuel, munitions, and support equipment usable by all allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia especially is a willing partner in this endeavor, but officials there have expressed some concern that ACE as it stands may not meet Australian needs for aircraft parking and maintenance equipment. In short, there may not be enough space available on Australian airfields for both U.S. and Australian aircraft — details that some feel have not been properly considered. As an extenuating factor, F-35 maintenance crews currently face the same collaboration restrictions as the engineers at the SWW. Australian crews cannot fix, refuel, or rearm U.S. F-35s, effectively doubling the amount of support personnel and equipment required to conduct ACE from any one base where both countries are present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, as new C2 technologies come online in the near term, AUKUS partners should ensure integration across the trilateral force. This is fortunately an area in which the partners have already made some great strides. The United States decided in April 2022 to purchase the E-7 Wedgetail, an airborne tactical C2 aircraft already in use in Australia and the United Kingdom, to replace the aging E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS). AUKUS partners further demonstrated advanced capabilities integration in May 2023 by using U.S., UK, and Australian AI to jointly detect and track military targets in a simulated operational C2 environment. This level of integration should be maintained. For example, the use of the E-7 should not become a two-tier common system like the F-35 currently has, with a U.S. version and a separate UK/Australian version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the United States pursues new operational C2 software such as Kessel Run for its Air Operations Centers, as well as tactical C2 such as the Advanced Battle Management System provided by the E-7, these systems cannot become U.S.-only, classified above the level of the other AUKUS partners. This is another area in which partner nation officials have privately expressed concern. Integration across these technologies, key to effective operations, can be achieved now through AUKUS Pillar Two. Doing so will set the partner nations up for success in both Pillar One and other technologies under Pillar Two, such as AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-long-term-promise-of-pillar-two-integrating-artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;The Long-Term Promise of Pillar Two: Integrating Artificial Intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful technological integration among AUKUS members in the near term will also enable further long-term integration of advanced technology. Pillar Two of AUKUS can be used to realize a force that is “integrated by design” to gain a competitive edge as new technologies are designed and fielded. This section considers the longstanding opportunities and challenges for one of Pillar Two’s most widely discussed advanced technologies, AI. If AUKUS members act now to set up Pillar Two’s AI focus area, they could ensure future success in leveraging the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI technologies are capable of being a force multiplier on and off the battlefield, from enhancing decisionmaking capabilities to improving predictive maintenance to augmenting unmanned weapons systems. While incorporating integration requirements from the outset is vital for successfully utilizing any technology, it is especially critical for AI technologies given their growing prevalence in the defense sector and their development and deployment hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting AI system integration wrong could cause technical bottlenecks that could slow development or deployment — or even cause outright system failure. As AUKUS members position themselves to be global leaders not only in AI capabilities but also in employing responsible AI — for instance, the United Kingdom announced in June 2023 it will host the first global summit on regulating AI later this year — it is especially important to ensure that the technology is deployed as safely and security as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside all the typical integration challenges, AI systems pose unique difficulties that require additional attention during the earlier stages of research and development to guarantee effective integration. The opacity of AI models makes it hard to identify the impetus for specific system behavior or the true extent of their capabilities and limitations, which can lead to unexpected failure modes. In both cases, obstacles in assessing system performance make pre-deployment stages of research, development, testing, and evaluation even more critical for anticipating and understanding AI system behavior. In linking AI systems to other technology (when combined performance can become even harder to monitor and track), it is particularly vital to clarify integration requirements for AI systems early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is therefore no surprise that AI systems integration is itself a quickly growing field of study. As such, it requires consideration beyond what is necessary for classical computing systems. AI technical integration requirements are broad and varied, including anything from codifying technical system-element attributes such as a shared semantic space to incorporating application programming interfaces (APIs). Beyond this, effective AI integration also includes operational considerations such as standardizing protocols and procedures, sharing information, developing operational best practices, and training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;achieving-effective-ai-integration-under-aukus-pillar-two&quot;&gt;Achieving Effective AI Integration under AUKUS Pillar Two&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, AUKUS Pillar Two has not devoted much consideration to effective integration strategies for the advanced technologies it seeks to deploy. Yet it is critical to begin this work as early as possible to develop consistent standards, from technical safety protocols to acquisition requirements to best practices and procedures. Early integration also enables innovation through common requirements and reduces the possibility of lock-in effects, which can hamper data sharing across platforms. To address the AI integration problem in AUKUS Pillar Two, AUKUS partners could ensure successful AI integration from the outset by harmonizing domestic AI implementation approaches as they are being developed and leveraging relevant military expertise in AI and systems integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, AUKUS members should synchronize their individual AI operationalization strategies now to enhance interoperability later. In 2022, the United Kingdom published its national Defence Artificial Intelligence Strategy, and the United States published its Responsible Intelligence Strategy and Implementation Pathway. However, their efforts to operationalize AI in their respective forces have been largely separate. AUKUS Pillar Two represents a timely opportunity to synchronize these efforts. This could be done through a distinct, trilateral Pillar Two working group for AI integration dedicated specifically to cutting across the original Pillar Two working groups focusing on individual technologies. Having a group whose primary focus is to consider integration between conventional and relevant advanced technologies will not only be useful in supporting the existing working groups as they consider their individual fields, but it will also allow for more rapid development and deployment of these technologies in concert with one another. Moreover, the ubiquitous nature of AI means that requirements for integrating it into other advanced technologies will need to be determined regardless; having a separate working group focusing on integration would therefore be particularly valuable for effective development and deployment of AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, AUKUS partners should leverage their existing sources of knowledge to better consider AI integration needs on the battlefield. Expert consultation could be ramped up quickly by reaching out to domestic military specialists working on similar AI integration efforts, such as Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) — which, though an emerging concept, is expected to be heavily reliant on AI and machine learning. This will require developing more formalized pathways for domestic military and industry experts to officially consult on AUKUS projects, but any costs associated with arranging this will be vastly outweighed by the benefits of a collective approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, AUKUS members do not need to wait for a more detailed Pillar Two strategy to be developed before executing either of these recommendations — they can both be undertaken quickly. Moreover, the earlier these and similar efforts are implemented, the better they will be able to improve AI performance through enhanced interoperability capabilities, thereby providing a significant competitive advantage to AUKUS partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delivering-the-promise-of-pillar-two-key-challenges&quot;&gt;Delivering the Promise of Pillar Two: Key Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlocking the huge potential of Pillar Two in the near and far term will require all three AUKUS nations to overcome serious challenges. Three stand out in particular: multinational cooperation, information sharing, and export and technology control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multinational-cooperation&quot;&gt;Multinational Cooperation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multinational cooperation agreements like AUKUS do not come easy in matters of national defense and security. Nations often hesitate to cooperate on these sovereign issues given fears about defection and relative gains. Moreover, the complexity of multinational development and acquisition projects means they fail more often than they succeed. As one CSIS study puts it, “While single-nation acquisition programs are hard, international joint acquisition is harder.” The AUKUS nations will have to work to overcome the friction and resistance generated by the political, economic, and military impediments to successful cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brief analysis of AUKUS in Table 1 against known success factors for multinational cooperation suggests Pillar Two has several strengths and weaknesses that will require exploiting or managing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NPIOOdf.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 1: An Analysis of the Strengths and Weaknesses of AUKUS Pillar Two against Known Success Factors for Multinational Cooperation.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Authors’ research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggests AUKUS is more promising than most multinational cooperation initiatives given the high levels of trust, solidarity, and shared strategic culture among these three leading Anglosphere nations. However, the need for the United States to reform its information-sharing and export-control practices, the vague goals for Pillar Two, and the defense-industrial asymmetry between the three partners will need careful management to prevent AUKUS becoming another failure of multinational defense cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;information-sharing&quot;&gt;Information Sharing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inadequate information sharing is perhaps the key impediment to achieving the full vision of AUKUS. While this is a concern for Pillar One, the Mutual Defense Agreement that has enabled nuclear-technology sharing between the United States and United Kingdom for several decades provides a reassuring precedent. One does not exist for Pillar Two, for which agreements will need to be created from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concern is based on the past experiences of the United States’ allies: accessing sensitive information is a perennial issue even for the closest of partners such as the United Kingdom and Australia. Intelligence ties between the United States and United Kingdom are the closest in the world, described as the “special relationship within the special relationship.” Yet their information and intelligence sharing is based on outdated processes and technology that have not kept up with the strategic environment. The same goes for the U.S.-Australia relationship, in which information-sharing practices “reflect a strategic and technological age that has long since passed us by. It’s a self-inflicted Achilles’ heel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason is overclassification within the U.S. system — described recently by General John Hyten, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as “unbelievably ridiculous.” One simple change could be to introduce a “Releasable to AUKUS Nations” (REL-AUKUS) protective marking. This could replace the NOFORN label often applied by default. An outdated mindset also prevails wherein information-sharing issues are accepted as a cost of doing business rather than an opportunity to find marginal — or even transformative — gains in the strategic competition with China. However, this mindset is shifting, helped along by AUKUS. The fact that AUKUS is a flagship policy of the Biden administration provides an imperative to make it work. Recent testimony to Congress by two senior Department of State and DOD officials sent a clear signal in May 2023 that the executive branch is taking this problem seriously. As Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Jessica Lewis put it, “Our top priority is to create new and open ways to share information and technology between the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possibility in the information-sharing realm is to encourage the free movement of skilled workers, thereby enabling the cross-pollination of expertise across the three partner nations. For example, if the United States needs additional expertise in an industry in which Australia or the United Kingdom had a pool of workers, it should make it easier for those workers to move between countries. Leveraging industry expertise could be accomplished by establishing a specialized AUKUS visa to ease collaboration and movement. This would also allow for the free exchange of ideas across industry workers, raising the level of expertise in many advanced-technology areas across the partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;export-and-technology-controls&quot;&gt;Export and Technology Controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar story exists on export and technology controls. When close U.S. allies — or their defense firms — wish to develop technology or acquire capability from the United States, they have to navigate a byzantine system of regulation. This costs time and money, undermines allies’ sovereignty, stifles innovation, and blunts the United States’ edge in the strategic competition with China. For instance, the United Kingdom spends at least half a billion dollars per year complying with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) — or nearly 1 percent of its defense budget, equivalent to a handful of F-35 fighter jets. ITAR and the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process also undermine the ability of U.S. allies to deploy their forces. For example, FMS compliance delayed a routine sonar upgrade on British Royal Navy submarines by several months, and the ITAR regime meant a separate submarine could not dock at sea for maintenance until the Department of State approved an ITAR-controlled component. Such examples call into question the operational sovereignty of U.S. allies, who are hostage to Department of State bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demands of ITAR and FMS compliance generate perverse incentives for U.S. companies to innovate abroad rather than at home. This has been seen in Boeing’s decision to develop its Ghost Bat drone in Australia and Anduril Australia’s ambition to develop hundreds of “ITAR-free” autonomous submarines — in other words, without involving U.S. companies. As Bill Greenwalt, a former deputy defense undersecretary for industrial policy, warns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“US commercial firms are wary of, if not downright hostile to, doing any research that might have a military application. They will do whatever it takes to commercialize their research first, by selling it in the global marketplace. For the same reason, foreign companies don’t want any US participation, even having a US engineer on a project. Through the mechanism of the State Department, the US military has closed itself off from the global innovation market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic problem is that the current system of U.S. regulation was designed during the Cold War, enacted through legislation such as the 1976 Arms Export Controls Act. It is based on the outdated assumption that the U.S. government leads in all fields of research and capability and that the best way to compete is to protect this advantage. Yet the commercial sector, not the government, is now the true wellspring of U.S. innovation and competitive edge. U.S. allies are another source of advantage — one not possessed by China — through their global leadership in key technologies, as demonstrated by the United Kingdom’s AI sector and Australia’s biotech industry. Greenwalt’s summary of the limits of ITAR applies to U.S. export and technology controls writ large: “Rather than protecting and advancing US technology interests, ITAR is now hindering development and providing our adversaries with a competitive advantage.” Just as with information sharing, a new mindset is required on U.S. export and technology controls. The question is not simply how to strengthen export controls, but how to leverage the United States’ unique advantages in innovation and allies to outcompete China. Both strengths would be diminished and smothered by more stringent controls that fail to keep up with changing economic and strategic realities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this sense, AUKUS Pillar Two has arrived just in time. It gives U.S. leaders a golden opportunity to deal with the perfect storm of three converging trends. First is China’s ascendancy in the global competition for preeminence in emerging technology. Second is how to regulate emerging technologies without stifling innovation. As Jim Lewis of CSIS points out, fundamental research on technologies such as AI and quantum “should be exempt from control as an open research system is more likely to maintain U.S. technological advantage.” Third, there is renewed focus on allies and partners as the center of gravity for U.S. defense and security strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is the U.S. government appears to be listening. U.S. officials readily admit that reforms to technology export laws are required to deliver Pillar Two. As one assessment puts it, “Behind the scenes, officials and politicians in all three nations are realizing that Pillar Two just won’t stand with ITAR as it’s currently enforced.” In May, the Biden administration announced plans to ask Congress to designate Australia as a “domestic source” under the Defense Production Act, while the House Committee on Foreign Affairs heard testimony from two senior DOD and Department of State officials on modernizing export controls for “a stronger AUKUS.” During her testimony, Jessica Lewis stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We will seek legislative change that would clear a path to new exemptions to licensing requirements for much of our defense trade with the UK and Australia. Under this legislative proposal, AUKUS partners will have many transfers pre-approved and not subject to case-by-case reviews.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this may have been music to the ears of many British and Australian officials, they will want to see clear evidence of progress before they celebrate too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We have reached a point in the global security environment and technology landscape where there is not only a benefit, but an imperative to expand our defense technology sharing practices. … AUKUS is the beginning of a path that will lead to a more integrated and open defense ecosystem that balances the threats of strategic competition by harnessing the strengths of our collective capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Karlin, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities, Testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, May 24, 2023&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States and its allies are in a strategic competition with China in which the race to develop and deploy emerging technologies will play a decisive role. In this context, Pillar Two of AUKUS holds the potential to supercharge progress in the short and long term. In the short term, AUKUS could improve interoperability among partners in the realms of EW and C2. In the longer term, AUKUS could catalyze the integration of AI technologies among partners and into defense and security applications — but only if they take steps now to harmonize their approaches and consult experts. Perhaps most importantly, to realize the potential of Pillar Two the United States needs to reassure its AUKUS partners by taking drastic steps to overcome barriers to cooperation, improve information sharing, and reform export controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, the success of AUKUS Pillar Two will depend on turning the strong political will the three partners have so far demonstrated into a new collective mindset. For Pillar Two to succeed, it should be treated as an opportunity to find marginal — or even transformative — gains in the strategic competition with China, rather than as a series of challenges to be overcome through piecemeal changes to, for example, information-sharing policies or more stringent export and technology controls. As Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Jessica Lewis has said, “The success of AUKUS is not predetermined. It must be built.” What happens next will determine whether AUKUS succeeds or “becomes an interesting footnote in the story of what could have been.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）踏入審訊第81天。大律師劉偉聰今繼續作供，就初選提名表格列明支持和認同戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，劉表示他只曾出席首次九西協調會議，故向助理查詢，獲悉共識包括目標議席數量、及會用電子和實體票等；並理解計劃目標只是策略性投票助民主派爭立會過半，但不綑綁當選後行為。法官質疑劉為何沒有再確認，劉強調他當時只是認為自己參與初選，最重要的是目標議席和參選名單數。就警方在劉辦公室搜出的初選論壇筆記，劉稱不知道由誰準備、他當時亦不知悉，而筆記提及「法治已死」的字眼，他亦表明「我從來不說『法治已死』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，劉表示《國安法》頒布後，他任國安法首被告唐英傑代表律師，亦曾研讀條文，惟檢視選舉材料後認為沒有違法，故無改變立場並繼續參選，惟他唯一沒考慮自己會干犯串謀：「因當時我只是認為自己參與初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰稱獲助理轉述九西4點共識-理解目標僅爭立會過半無綑綁當選後行為&quot;&gt;劉偉聰稱獲助理轉述九西4點「共識」 理解目標僅爭立會過半無綑綁當選後行為&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;參選九西的前深水埗區議員、大律師劉偉聰今繼續作供。就初選提名表格，他供稱是由其助理李先生提供，他簽署前有仔細閱讀。對表格上提及「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，劉表示因他只出席了首次九西會議，故當時曾問助理「共識」是指什麼，助理表示曾問民主動力，共識是指九西目標議席為4席、初選後才決定參與正式選舉的名單數目、會有電子及實體票，以及參選人要幫忙找地方設立票站。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 劉偉聰&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉表示他對這些答案感到滿意，只是對要參選人找票站感到有點奇怪，認為可能會有不中立的問題。他強調，「我當時認為我在參與初選」，即是民主陣營間就參選資格的競爭，「最重要的便是目標議席數目和合資格參與正式選舉的名單數目⋯⋯而我一直也不知道會綑綁初選與當選後在立法會的行為。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於「民主派35+公民投票計劃」，劉指他認為只是計劃的正式名字，而非任何文件，又指以往一直只以為叫「民主派初選」，當時才首次發現計劃有正式名字；至於「目標」，他認為是選取勝算最高的參選人參與正式選舉，以達致「策略性投票」並增加民主派立會過半的可能性。劉並指，他交表前沒有與組織者表示會參與初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑無再確認共識及目標-劉強調對助理答案感滿意僅參加初選&quot;&gt;官質疑無再確認共識及目標 劉強調對助理答案感滿意、僅參加初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉續問，戴耀廷在首次會議上已談及否決權，劉有查詢否決權的議題已被解決了嗎？劉指沒有，重申當時不認為有此關注，亦不知道初選是綑綁當選後行為。陳續指但其實除目標議席外，其餘3點均並非目標，只是一些流程（logistics）的問題，問經過那麼多區的那麼多次會議，唯一的共識只是取得4個議席，劉不覺得很奇怪嗎？劉說他不覺得，亦不知道其他區發生的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳再追問，劉曾加入香港皇家警察、獲政務官有條件取錄，均會做很多準備，現在首次參與立法會選舉應是很重要的事，但卻說對什麼都不感興趣，助理說目標是取得4席就已感滿意？又指參與初選亦要付1萬元按金，並非「免費午餐」，「如果我要付1萬元，我會看，我會問」，而訂金收據亦再表明「必須支持和認同」協調會議共識及計劃目標，如違反將不會獲發還按金。劉強調他當時已感滿意，因認為自己只是參與初選，他亦不知道有第二次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再問，劉在選舉論壇上有否問其他參選人有出席過多少次協調會議、或會上達成了什麼共識。劉說他沒有，因他當時根本沒為意有其他協調會議，亦就他對共識的理解感到滿意。陳追問，但其他參選人均是他的競爭對手和敵人，如果劉不認識他的敵人，如何能打敗他們？陳又指劉是一名大律師，一定會知道法庭最重要的規矩是：「認識你的法官！（Know your judge!）」劉回應，他有仔細閱讀其他參選人的政綱，知道他們的政治立場和光譜，但不視他們為「敵人」；又指了解其他參選人也與協調會議共識無關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉承認估計勝算微立場屬非常不黃&quot;&gt;劉承認估計勝算微、立場屬「非常不黃」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續問，是否因為劉認為自己勝算很微，所以不關注其他事？劉同意其勝算較微，當時估計張崑陽會是最高票者，其次為岑子杰、毛孟靜、何啟明。而劉估計自己或排在第5或第6名、最多亦只能排第4，最終他排名第6。劉並解釋，就「鬥黃」而言，他是「非常不黃（very not yellow）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉選舉單張無提否決預算案-提威權壓力指中央及特區政府無維護一國兩制&quot;&gt;劉選舉單張無提否決預算案 提「威權壓力」指中央及特區政府無維護一國兩制&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官續問及劉偉聰的選舉單張，劉確認沒提過否決預算案或議案，並指重點是希望改善或修訂法律，為警暴問責，及「民權重光」。劉解釋，原想沿用他參與區選的口號「Let the people see the sun」，惟因團隊認為會與張崑陽（Sunny Cheung）混淆，故最終僅用「民權重光」，希望仍保有「光」的意思。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續引政綱的英文版本，提及「目睹威權對香港司法制度持續不斷的壓力和攻擊（“witness the unceasing authoritarian pressure and tyrannical attacks on the Hong Kong legal system”）」，問劉「威權壓力（authoritarian pressure）」是指什麼？劉表示，是指特區政府和中央沒有維護（upheld）一國兩制。劉一度欲講述政治學的理論，惟陳慶偉打斷指對理論沒有興趣，笑言「我知道你閱讀很多，但我不，我只是對審訊這單案和處理案中的問題有興趣」。劉又解釋，用「壓力」一字，是因特區和中央政府並非每刻都在做壞事，但當他們沒有維護一國兩制，該壓力就變為威權。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱需正常運作立會方能通過修訂法案不會違反法治&quot;&gt;劉稱需正常運作立會方能通過修訂法案、不會違反法治&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉在法官追問下，同意該句主要指《逃犯條例》，亦不是指整個政權，而是指某些政策或政府的某個部分。政綱英文亦提及「我們會同樣勇猛捍衛普世權利和自由（“We will defend with equal ferocity our universal rights and freedom.”）」，陳問「同樣勇猛（equal ferocity）」指什麼措施？劉指修改法例。陳慶偉問：「不是否決預算案？」劉否認並指：「我需要政府、我需要正常運作的立法會才能通過修訂法案。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指，那或是他的想法，但其他參與者不是這樣想，而是想用盡一切方法。劉指他不肯定其他人是否如此絕望或願意犧牲所有，但就民主選舉而言，「如果我有人民的授權（mandate），我只會做我認為對的事、和我選民支持的事」，同意法官指他重視法治的價值，不會想做任何違反法治的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被搜得論壇筆記-劉偉聰稱不知由誰準備論壇無使用&quot;&gt;被搜得論壇筆記 劉偉聰稱不知由誰準備、論壇無使用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就選舉論壇，李運騰問及劉偉聰何時開始準備。劉表示，「我不想聽起來很自大，但我自大學起已是經驗豐富的辯論員，獲得很多獎項，如果說我要準備，那是說得輕了（understatement），我整個人生都準備好辯論，我沒有特別哪一刻為這個論壇作準備」，但補充他有花時間看別人的政綱。陳慶偉笑說：「你看，你令在場的律師都汗顏。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰續問及在劉偉聰辦公室搜得的「625 Debate 要點」，劉確認是從其辦公室搜得，但表明不是由他本人準備，是在收到控方文件夾才首次得知有此份文件，他在論壇上沒有使用、亦沒有獲任何人告知可以使用，也不認得文件上的字跡。被問辦公室由誰使用，劉指不是與他人共用，而他有招募選舉經理、5名核心義工和10名大學實習生，其助理李先生則負責區務。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問及筆記「黃碧雲：為何不簽署初選立場確認書？是否連否決財政算案，這樣制度內的抗爭都不願意承諾？」，指似乎顯示草擬者知道黃碧雲沒有簽署，那應知道劉的名字有出現在聲明上，問為何劉昨又說論壇前數日才得知？劉重申他完全不知道誰準備筆記，而且那人也完全不了解他：「我不會口頭攻擊一名女士，這完全是錯的！」陳慶偉問，即他的助理完全不了解他？劉重申他不知道誰撰寫，亦沒要求任何人撰寫，筆記上出現的很多話他也完全沒有說過。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;筆記提法治已死-劉稱他從不這樣說論壇提法治係唔會死&quot;&gt;筆記提「法治已死」 劉稱他從不這樣說、論壇提「法治係唔會死」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳追問，即有人無故（out of the blue）出於好心幫助劉？劉稱不能作出揣測，但後稱如一定要猜，一定是由一個很想幫忙但不了解他的人所寫。陳提及，但筆記提到的一些議題也有在劉的論壇發言或政綱出現，所以劉是說一切全屬巧合？劉解釋，他在辦公室會與職員和實習生傾談，讓他們了解他的取向和願景，亦當然可能有談及相同的話題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰主動指，劉偉聰論壇上曾說「法治係唔會死」，與筆記「被問的回應」下提及「法治已死」字眼有所不同。劉重申，因準備筆記的人不了解他，「我從來不說『法治已死』⋯我怎會說『法治已死』？（“I never say ‘法治已死’… How would I say ‘法治已死’?”）」，重申整份筆記也與他完全無關。陳慶偉指，也可以另一種方式解讀，即若劉當選後，法治就不會死，惟劉認為是過份解讀。劉續在陳仲衡追問下，同意「法治已死」僅屬回應問題的議題、而非回應的答案和立場，相關的答案是寫在「法治已死」之後。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉強調，不希望為一份不知是誰撰寫的文件負責，李運騰指理解其證供，但劉是否真的對筆記不知情，法庭會再決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇提啟明兄-劉稱為人老派喜叫人乜乜兄&quot;&gt;論壇提「啟明兄」 劉稱為人老派喜叫人「乜乜兄」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，筆記亦另提及「啟明兄，我知道你有簽署共同綱領，你點睇有些候選人冇簽署共同綱領呢？會唔會質疑他們的抗爭意志？」，何啟明早前稱簽署「墨落」時無意否決預算案，陳慶偉指，似乎筆記草擬者並沒有讀出何啟明這個意圖，劉同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡並問，筆記提及「啟明兄」，而劉在選舉論壇亦有稱何為「啟明兄」，劉同意，指二人是好友。陳慶偉笑問，所以準備筆記的人知道劉的想法（“… can read your mind”），兩人都很尊敬何？庭上傳出笑聲，何啟明則輕輕皺眉和「O嘴」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉說他不能代其他人說話，並指他在論壇上亦不止稱何為「兄」，亦稱馮達浚為「達浚兄」，並指「說我老派（old-school）吧，我喜歡叫人『乜乜兄』」。陳慶偉笑問那他怎樣稱呼女士？劉說視乎年紀，庭上多人大笑，陳指尊重應不取決於年紀，劉欲再解釋，惟陳說「算了（“Forget it.”）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱國安法後曾檢視選舉材料-認為無違法故無改變&quot;&gt;劉稱《國安法》後曾檢視選舉材料 認為無違法故無改變&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰續指，《國安法》生效後，他出於學術和知識上的興趣、加上是《國安法》首案被告唐英傑的代表律師，曾研讀《國安法》條文，惟由於當時未有任何案例或權威，故他以普通法的方法閱讀，特別是當中四大罪行及有關保釋的條文。劉續指，他當時檢視自己的立場和選舉材料，但認為沒有任何違反《國安法》之處，他亦沒有改變他的選舉材料和政治立場。劉指，他唯一沒考慮的就是「串謀」，「因當時我只是認為自己參與初選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續補充，當時除選舉論壇，亦有辦街站宣傳，他亦曾讀過《國安法》後有關戴耀廷等組織者對初選合法性看法的報導，但他沒有從組織者收過任何相關訊息。劉最後指，初選結束後因他只是排名第六，故即時停止選舉工程，並着助理發文表示尊重結果。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰主問完畢，續由控方盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hVlo16h.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（7日）踏入審訊第81天。劉偉聰今在盤問下表示，自己不使用 WhatsApp，主要由助理與初選組織者聯絡，遭法官質疑。劉解釋自己是私密的人，不喜歡使用社交媒體，惟法官質疑組織者於本案以 WhatsApp 傳送協調文件，劉的說法是「方便的開脫理由」。劉其後自願提供手機密碼讓控方查證，但終解鎖不果。劉最後於覆問表示，留意到法庭對他不用 WhatsApp 的關注，但他指自己家中沒有電視和電腦，只有書本、音樂和兩隻貓，「這是我選擇的生活方式」。劉完成兩天自辯，同參選九西的黃碧雲決定不作供，料下周一將由參選九東的前民協主席施德來作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，劉偉聰今指自己不看《蘋果日報》、無看過戴耀廷在該報的文章及 Facebook 帖文，指自己不看別人 Facebook，兩名法官聞言指自己亦不看別人 Facebook。劉又重申雖沒簽署「墨落無悔」，但無要求移除姓名是為免人誤以為他反對「五大訴求」，並引述何啟明早前稱當時「唔知咁大鑊」，主控周天行表示：「那你現在知道了。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰稱不用whatsapp無收組織者訊息-官質疑是方便的開脫理由&quot;&gt;劉偉聰稱不用WhatsApp、無收組織者訊息 官質疑是方便的開脫理由&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰今早完成主問，並接受主控周天行盤問。劉表示自己從沒有政治聯繫，不會自視為抗爭派，而其議員助理李大衛（音）當初只是告知他泛民有一個開放予所有有意參選立會者的會議，但他沒問李從何得知。控方問其助理有否與組織者聯絡，劉指他應與組織者有接觸，否則不會知道協調會議的資訊，但對他如何獲得資料不關注，直言「我有其他工作要做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉亦表示，自己從不用 WhatsApp，從沒從組織者收過任何文件或相關訊息。法官陳仲衡問那組織者如何與他聯絡，劉稱是通過助理。法官陳慶偉亦問他為何不用 WhatsApp，劉自言是一個私密的人（private person），「我不喜歡使用社交媒體也不喜歡 WhatsApp 的群組對話，不想參與群組討論」，只會打電話或以蘋果手機的 iMessage 與親友聯絡。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉多次追問劉沒用 WhatsApp 的原因，指若劉沒有電話，可理解他不用 WhatsApp，但如他有電話，「我不明白為何你完全不用WhatsApp？」劉指他沒有任何事要隱瞞，只是他不喜歡用那些軟件。惟陳再指，本案初選組織者正透過 WhatsApp 傳送協調文件，故要測試劉的邏輯，又認為「從來不用 WhatsApp」於本案是「方便的開脫理由（“a convenient way out in this particular case”）」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉自願提供電話密碼-惟未能成功解鎖&quot;&gt;劉自願提供電話密碼 惟未能成功解鎖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉表示，其電話被警方檢取，但如有需要可開啟，供法庭測試。李運騰稱如控方有相反說法，相信已提出證據。午休後，周天行問劉提供其手機密碼，劉表示不反對，但不肯定是否仍記得3年前密碼，彭卓棋面露驚訝張嘴。李運騰一度指劉沒有義務要協助控方，但認為無需提醒劉這一點，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉其後將密碼寫在紙上交予控方，陳慶偉並指他使用了蘋果手機多年，問會否有指紋或面部解鎖，惟劉指其電話沒有用到。下午小休後，控方表示劉只記得4位數密碼，但電話要6位數密碼才能解鎖，故未能成功解鎖。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰重申認為五大訴求可接受但不會參與不認同但亦不反對&quot;&gt;劉偉聰重申認為五大訴求可接受但不會參與、不認同但亦不反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問是否認識初選組織者，劉稱知道區諾軒名字、認得趙家賢的樣子，而就參與九西初選者，他認識何啟明，因何是其九西區議會同事，兩人辦事處距離近，何不時會來跟他談天；他亦認識岑子杰，指岑會邀請他參與同志活動。劉亦知道毛孟靜、黃碧雲、張崑陽的名字，但不認識馮達浚，並指張崑陽與他同樣曾參與港大辯論隊。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉並表示，不記得戴耀廷在首次會議有否提五大訴求，但有提也不出奇，因是當時流行（currency）的。周天行指，劉當時是反對（against）五大訴求，惟劉指那不準確，強調他是認為可接受（agreeable）但他不會參與（engage），指他不反對並尊重別人有這個立場。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方展示「35+計劃」文件，提及凡認同「五大訴求，缺一不可」才能參與初選協調，指似乎與劉的想法相違。惟法官李運騰指，劉是認為五大訴求可接受，只是他不會爭取，陳慶偉亦指劉不認同（subscribe to），但亦不反對。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱無讀過戴耀廷蘋果日報文章不看別人facebook&quot;&gt;劉稱無讀過戴耀廷《蘋果日報》文章、不看別人Facebook&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉在盤問下亦確認，辦初選期間不曾讀過戴耀廷在《蘋果日報》刊出的文章，重申除〈讓愛與和平佔領中環〉外沒讀過戴的中文文章，而他不看《蘋果日報》，只看董橋逢周日的專欄。周天行指他有使用 Facebook，惟劉指其 Facebook 只是用作區議會工作，由其議辦營運，他不看別人的 Facebook，並直至收到控方文件夾才讀到戴耀廷和區諾軒等人的 Facebook 帖文。此時李運騰主動表示，他也不看別人的 Facebook，陳慶偉說他也不看，指法官不准在 Facebook 發文，亦指他沒有 Instagram 帳戶。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱僅讀過69記者會報導無與何啟明討論協調會共識&quot;&gt;劉稱僅讀過6.9記者會報導、無與何啟明討論協調會共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於初選組織者曾辦過的記者會，劉稱對3月26日記者會不知情，而他曾讀過6月9日記者會的報導，但沒看過該記者會，對其他記者會亦不知情，亦無收過其他計劃的訊息，劉並於6月報名參選。劉盤問下表示有與何啟明談及初選，但主要關注最終誰會勝出，沒有談及協調會議達成的共識。他亦不同意交表時知道35+計劃共識是取得立會過半，以否決預算案爭取五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱無要求刪墨落簽署因唔知咁大鑊-控方你現在知道了&quot;&gt;劉稱無要求刪「墨落」簽署因「唔知咁大鑊」 控方：你現在知道了&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「墨落無悔」聲明，劉盤問下表示，當時沒有興趣找出聲明提及「已取得共識的共同綱領」是什麼，而他僅出席首次九西會議，當時沒達共識，事後亦無獲訊息初選有重大改變。劉亦認為聲明「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求」的字面意思，是指有一系列的權力可用，但沒有說明必須用哪種權力。周天行質疑字面並沒有說明該些權力是「可用可不用」，法官打斷指可留待陳詞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kfVHo5r.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 周天行&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉曾供稱不知道其名字為何出現在聲明，同意事件對他仍是「謎團（mystery）」。周天行今再問這至今對他仍是「謎團」？惟周發問時誤稱作「不幸（misery）」。劉反問「是 mystery 抑或 misery？」，並稱認為兩者皆是，「這對我來說既是謎團亦是不幸。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續重申，當時沒有要求移除其名字，因若要求移除，便會被理解成反對五大訴求，形同「選舉自殺」，故他做法是沉默應對，沒有表示支持聲明。周天行指，他不一定會被以為反對五大訴求、可以只顯示為不同意「墨落無悔」，惟劉認為文字很容易被人誤會和誇大，故選擇不要求移除名字，指屬風險管理。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉並指，事後回看，「我當然應該要求移除我的名字」，但引何啟明早前證供稱：「我哋都唔知咁大鑊㗎嘛。」何啟明發笑。周天行續望着劉偉聰說：「那你現在知道了。（“Now you know.”）」，被告席傳來低聲的「嘩」，亦有人發笑，陳慶偉說：「Thank you.」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ZPM3Rf0.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;
▲ 劉偉聰（左）、何啟明（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇問何啟明簽墨落-劉稱若被問會表明無簽初選非你死我活想對手發亮&quot;&gt;論壇問何啟明簽「墨落」 劉稱若被問會表明無簽、初選非「你死我活」想對手發亮&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，劉偉聰曾於選舉論壇表示：「啟明兄，喺深水埗呢，我就知你第一個走出嚟就簽我哋個參選嘅聲明，咁我想知，你點解咁勇呢？」劉主問時主動澄清當時說錯了，「我哋」應指「你哋」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方質疑若劉擔心會曝露他沒有簽署聲明，為何在論壇又主動提及；李運騰續指問題應是，若劉不想強調他沒有簽署聲明，為何主動提起？劉主問和盤問下均表示，望提供機會讓何啟明在論壇「發亮（shine）」，解釋因過往民協或予人守舊或過時的印象，但何願展示勇敢的、年輕的形象，故特別提及聲明讓何能表現自己。劉並表明，他自從發現名字出現在「墨落無悔」後，已準備好若有人問及，而他無法隱瞞其立場，「我就會表明我沒有簽署。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方問，若劉真的認為「墨落無悔」只是「陳述明顯的事實」，那為何要以「勇」形容何啟明？劉重申，因何簽署聲明，在他看來是與本土派有連繫，並展示勇敢、進步的形象。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰亦問，劉既然認為勝算不大，為何仍想競爭對手在論壇「發亮」？劉指雖然他不是完全無私，「但若有更多人進入立會，對香港來說不是壞事」，他亦認為初選不是「你死我活」，想人們展現最好的一面。李運騰問，所以劉當時認為何比起他是更適合、勝算更高的候選人？劉同意何有更多支持者、勝算更高，至於是否適合就由選民判斷。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱不知義工為九西群組成員亦無要求加入得悉其他參選人主張但忘具體內容&quot;&gt;劉稱不知義工為九西群組成員亦無要求加入、得悉其他參選人主張但忘具體內容&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰續在盤問下重申，《國安法》後有讀過戴耀廷回應初選合法性的報導，但無為意戴稱35+計劃目標是取得立會過半，否決預算案令政府問責。周天行問有沒有人告知他初選的合法性，劉說沒有，他亦沒有問，李運騰提醒控方「記住他的專業」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉盤問下並表示，他不知道九龍西於6月設立「35+計劃九龍西訊息發佈區」的 WhatsApp 群組，亦不知道其核心義工 Victoria Wong 是群組成員，也沒有要求她加入，是直至控方現時告知才得知。控方指 Victoria Wong 曾於群組發言數次，包括票站事宜，劉指曾獲她告知相關事宜，至於其他群組的訊息，劉指他不知情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後就其他九西參選人單張發問，其中何啟明單張在「點解香港人需要『民主35+』？」下，提及「取得全面否決權，包括否決財政預算案」；張崑陽單張提到民主派密鑼緊鼓辦初選協調爭立會過半，「以行使否決權，阻截政權予取予求」；岑子杰亦有提到否決權以爭五大訴求，問劉是否知悉。劉表示他曾閱讀其他參選人政綱，知道大概的立場，但不記得具體內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後指，劉與其他被告串謀無差別否決預算案，以迫使特首回應五大訴求，意圖顛覆國家政權，劉表示不同意，亦否認曾收過九西的協調文件初稿和最終版本。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱無用whatsapp是他選的生活方式&quot;&gt;劉稱無用WhatsApp是他選的生活方式&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方盤問完畢後進入覆問。劉表示，他不會說這是覆問，但因看到法庭關注他不使用WhatsApp，故希望說明：「我家中沒有電視、我家中沒有電腦，我只有書本、音樂和兩隻貓，這不是邏輯的問題，這是我選擇的生活方式，沒有其他補充，感謝法官閣下的耐性和忍耐。（“I do not have a TV set in my home, I do not have a computer in my home, I only have books, music and two cats, it’s not a matter of logic, it’s a chosen way of living. I have nothing to add. I’m most grateful to my lord, thank you for your lordship’s patience and tolerance.”）」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰完成2天盤問。代表黃碧雲的大律師沈士文續表示，黃決定不會作供，亦不會傳召證人。料下周一將由前民協主席施德來作供。&lt;/p&gt;

Responding to this challenge, the CSIS International Security Program undertook an assessment of Baltic security and Lithuanian security in particular. The study considered Russian threats, NATO responses, the requirements of effective deterrence, and progress toward the goals set at the Madrid NATO summit in 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study concluded that the Baltic countries are in a particularly dangerous situation. Decisions made at the 2022 Madrid summit and NATO’s new operating concept have set the alliance on the right course for dealing with the new threat. However, implementation of the Madrid commitments has been uneven. NATO leaders need to ensure the decisions taken in Madrid to reassure allies and   strengthen deterrence are on a clear path to implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;europes-changing-security-environment&quot;&gt;Europe’s Changing Security Environment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine has transformed the European security environment by dramatically reviving the possibility of cross-border invasion. The Baltic countries — Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia — are at the forefront of this security shift. Lithuania is particularly challenged because of the need to keep the Suwałki Gap open and due to Germany’s struggles in expanding its deterrence forces in Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO and Europe have responded strongly and with remarkable unity to the Russian aggression by providing massive aid to Ukraine, increasing defense budgets, deploying forces to Eastern Europe, and imposing unprecedented sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has shown a solid commitment to NATO and European security but must balance its efforts in Europe with countering a rising and belligerent China in the Indo-Pacific―what its National Defense Strategy calls the “pacing challenge.” As a result, Europe needs to take a major role in enhancing deterrence against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans need to keep in mind the stakes involved. The Baltic states vividly remember that, under Soviet rule, free elections ended, national culture was Russified, forced collectivization of agriculture impoverished farmers, religion was suppressed, and over 100,000 citizens were deported to Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;threats-to-baltic-security&quot;&gt;Threats to Baltic Security&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary threat to the Baltic states comes from Russia. Despite the hopes of the West and many of Russia’s people, postwar Russia is unlikely to become a liberal democracy at peace with its neighbors. Instead, Russia will likely be authoritarian, revanchist, suspicious of the West, and a major military power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Russia’s military has lost heavily during the war in Ukraine, it will rebuild when the war ends. Indeed, Russia is taking near-term steps to expand its forces permanently. Estimates vary widely on how long a full rebuilding will take. NATO should hope for the best but prepare for the worst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One outcome of the Russian attack on Ukraine is that the world can now see how Russia plans military operations. Future attacks will likely have five elements: shock and awe, decapitation of national leadership, missile strikes against fixed military targets, deep heliborne insertions, and deep attacks by armored columns. A Russian attack will be swift, violent, and aimed at rapid and complete victory. There will be little time for defending troops to prepare and get into position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-military-status-of-the-baltic-states&quot;&gt;The Military Status of the Baltic States&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic states are taking strong measures to defend themselves. All the Baltic states have increased their military budgets substantially as the threat from Russia has increased. Lithuania’s military budget has tripled since 2008. All Baltic countries exceed NATO’s 2 percent military spending goal, which only seven other NATO countries have accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the Baltic countries have reinstituted conscription, which only four other NATO countries currently have in place. As a percentage of the population in uniform, the Baltic countries are far ahead of most of the rest of NATO. Lithuania, for example, has 0.82 percent of its population in uniform, whereas the United States and Germany have only 0.41 and 0.22 percent, respectively. Since joining NATO in 2004, Lithuania has increased the number of personnel in uniform by 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;gaps-and-geostrategic-vulnerabilities-in-deterrence-and-defense&quot;&gt;Gaps and Geostrategic Vulnerabilities in Deterrence and Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic states have several major geostrategic vulnerabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They lack strategic depth as a result of their small size. Whereas Ukraine has been able to defend in depth and use that depth to buy time for strengthening its defenses, the Baltic countries have no such option. Their capitals lie only a short distance from a threat border. Vilnius, for example, lies only 18 miles (30 kilometers) from the Belarusian border. Russia penetrated 152 miles (244 kilometers) into Ukraine in its attempt to capture Kyiv.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NATO reinforcements must travel long distances to get to the new front line, as much as 10 times as far as during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Suwałki Gap, running between Russia’s Kaliningrad enclave to the north and Russia-friendly Belarus to the south, constitutes a major vulnerability. Russian missiles and artillery on both sides of the gap would create a gauntlet of fire in wartime for any NATO attempt to reinforce the Baltic states by land. Russia might even take the high-risk/high-payoff action of trying to close the gap with ground forces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inherent vulnerabilities and the small size of the Baltic countries and their militaries mean that, despite their extraordinary efforts, the Baltic states cannot defend the region without the help of the entire alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;made-in-madrid&quot;&gt;Made in Madrid&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NATO’S COMMITMENTS TO STRENGTHEN DEFENSE AND DETERRENCE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian’s 2014 aggression in Crimea and the Donbas indicated that the future might not be as peaceful as NATO had once hoped. Thus began the process of reenergizing the alliance as a mechanism for military security in Europe. NATO defense budgets (excluding the United States) have increased 32 percent since 2015. Forward-deployed multinational battle groups were established in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, putting more boots on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s invasion of Ukraine accelerated this process. A new NATO strategic concept and decisions at NATO’s 2022 Madrid summit took several important steps, including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;identifying Russia as “the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area”;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;inviting Sweden and Finland to join the alliance;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;setting a goal of expanding the battalion-sized battle groups (1,000–2,000 troops) to a full brigade (4,000–5,000 troops);&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;calling for “credible readily available reinforcements” and pre-positioned equipment in the Baltic region to speed reinforcements in a crisis; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;calling for establishing division-level structures (the larger forces envisioned in the new operating concept need a nearby division headquarters).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, implementation of the commitments NATO made at Madrid is lagging behind the rhetoric. Most members do not meet the 2 percent military spending goal. Progress on scaling up the existing Enhanced Forward Presence missions, strengthening regional plans, and generating reinforcement forces appears sluggish. One example is Germany’s ongoing struggle to deploy a full brigade in Lithuania despite having Europe’s largest economy and one of Europe’s largest militaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-madrid-to-vilnius&quot;&gt;From Madrid to Vilnius&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CLOSING NATO’S DETERRENCE GAP IN THE BALTICS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterring a war is far better than fighting one, and the strongest deterrence comes from credible, forward-deployed forces. Other strategies might be less expensive and easier to implement but entail a high level of risk in the current environment. “Tripwire” strategies, for example, can be attractive in theory but dangerous in practice. The threat of retaliation may not be credible, and in the case of the Baltic countries, retaking territory is much harder than defending in the first place. Strategies relying on reinforcement need time to work, but time may not be available in a crisis. “Deterrence by detection” failed in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By focusing on the ability to deny a Russian fait accompli, NATO’s new operating concept and the decisions from the Madrid summit set NATO on the right path for the future. The Baltic states describe this as “repel, don’t expel.” In other words, defeat a Russian invasion; don’t rely on a counteroffensive after an initial withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing the Madrid summit’s ambitious goals requires action in several areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Provide the needed resources.&lt;/em&gt; The Defense Investment Pledge made by allies at the Wales summit in 2014 was intended to be fulfilled “within a decade.” Allies will need to start the conversation at Vilnius about what comes next. NATO will need a more aggressive push toward the 2 percent of GDP goal if member states are to provide the resources needed by the new commitments and operating strategy. Many voices, including the Baltic countries, have advocated a higher goal — 2.5 percent or even 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Build “robust in-place combat-ready forces.”&lt;/em&gt; For the Baltic states, implementing the new policy of forward defense to deter Russian aggression is critical for national security and indeed national survival. This requires decisions on several unresolved issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The nature of the forward-deployed brigades:&lt;/strong&gt; Specifying “a brigade” is not enough. Decisions are needed regarding how large the brigades will be, which nations will provide the troops, how the brigade will absorb the existing battle group, and where the brigade will get support troops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The stationing of the brigades:&lt;/strong&gt; Although it is easier to keep the bulk of the brigades at their home stations, they need to be forward deployed in peacetime to be a credible deterrent and meet the demanding timelines of a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The type and location of pre-positioned equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-positioned equipment speeds force deployment but requires extensive peacetime preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The divisional command structure:&lt;/strong&gt; The lines of command are becoming unclear as Baltic states stand up their own division headquarters to replace NATO’s division headquarters. Building division headquarters capable of wartime operations requires equipment and trained personnel that the Baltic countries currently lack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced exercise plans:&lt;/strong&gt; New kinds of multinational capabilities need new kinds of NATO exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Suwałki gap:&lt;/strong&gt; NATO needs to develop concepts for keeping the gap open in wartime and then make the appropriate peacetime preparations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Refine and implement the new force model.&lt;/em&gt; At the Madrid summit, NATO committed to increasing its response force of high-readiness units from 40,000 to over 300,000 personnel through a new force model. While the ambition of the initiative is laudable, it got off to a bad start, with some allies taken by surprise at the scale of the plans. At the Vilnius summit, NATO will reveal the status of this new force model one year on from its conception. There are few signs NATO will generate the massive forces required to meet the one-year deadline set by NATO’s secretary general. Yet, highly-ready forces are needed for rapid reinforcement in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Establish timelines and periodic reporting.&lt;/em&gt; The commitments need a clear timeline with assigned organizational responsibilities and designated milestones so that NATO can track progress. All future NATO summits and defense minister meetings (held quarterly) should include a status report from the secretary general on these actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adapt the plan over time.&lt;/em&gt; Plans require continuous evaluation and adjustment. NATO therefore needs to periodically assess whether the new commitments are adequate in light of the evolving threat from an unpredictable Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Madrid summit put NATO on a new course.&lt;/em&gt; The 2023 Vilnius summit and subsequent summits have an opportunity to ensure that movement along that course continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;europes-changing-security-environment-1&quot;&gt;Europe’s Changing Security Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has become commonplace to note that Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine has transformed the European security environment. Yet any discussion of European security in general and Baltic security in particular must begin with this fundamental fact. Europe is no longer an “exporter of security” but now faces aggression and military conflict within its borders that go far beyond the conflicts of the 1990s in the Balkans. The Baltic countries are at the forefront of this security shift. What might be an environment of concern to more distant European states is, for them, a matter of national survival. Lithuania is particularly challenged because of the need to keep the Suwałki Gap open and due to Germany’s struggles in expanding its Lithuanian-based battle group to brigade size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian invasion of Ukraine has strengthened NATO by unifying its members and expanding its membership. The United States has shown a solid commitment to European security but is distracted by China and the Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;War in Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the war in Ukraine, the threat of territorial aggression in Europe has reemerged for the first time since the end of the Cold War. This represents a profound shift from the generally benign view of post–Cold War Europe. During that period, Europe faced few external threats beyond the spillover effects of internal conflict in the Balkans, and Russia was seen as a strategic partner. NATO’s European members took a peace dividend by deeply cutting their military forces and budgets. NATO’s membership expanded eastward as many states sought tighter integration with Western Europe. Indeed, NATO was seen more as a tool for European integration and the promotion of democracy than as a military alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Russia’s revanchist activities have changed this environment. This perception began shifting with Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008 and accelerated with the seizure of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent support to separatists in eastern Ukraine. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine removed any doubt about Russia’s aggressive intentions. As Dakota Wood, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and scholar at the Heritage Foundation, put it, “In a violent refutation of aphorisms such as ‘modern states don’t make war on each other,’ ‘major countries are too economically interdependent to risk going to war,’ and ‘the costs of becoming an international pariah state are too high,’ Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-nato-and-european-response&quot;&gt;The NATO and European Response&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO and Europe have responded strongly and with remarkable unity to Russian aggression. This response has fallen into six categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identification of Russia as a security threat: The 2022 NATO Madrid summit took this step for the first time since the end of the Cold War, overturning language in the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act that “NATO and Russia do not consider each other as adversaries.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Provision of military, economic, and humanitarian aid: The scale of such aid has been unprecedented. The United States has enacted $113 billion in aid through September 30, 2023, with $77.1 billion provided through February 24, 2023. Likewise, European countries have provided $74.5 billion. Without this aid, the Ukrainian resistance would have collapsed after a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Imposition of sanctions: Although sanctions have become a standard tool for statecraft, the restrictions put on Russia have been unprecedented in their breadth and global reach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enhanced forward defenses: NATO moved thousands of troops to its eastern borders to deter Russia from entering NATO territory. It also expanded the long-standing Air Policing function and its Air Shielding mission to monitor airspace and protect against air or missile attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increased military preparedness: Many European NATO countries have increased their defense budgets. NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said at the launch of his annual report for 2022 that many more NATO allies have “announced significant defence spending increases since Russia’s invasion” and that he expects allies to agree to “a more ambitious new defence investment pledge” in Vilnius this July.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Expansion of membership: In an event nearly unimaginable two years ago, Finland has joined NATO as a full member, and Sweden will likely join soon. Russia’s strategic situation has deteriorated, with the Baltic Sea becoming a NATO lake and the NATO-Russia frontier doubling in length.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;contributions-by-baltic-countries&quot;&gt;Contributions by Baltic Countries&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic countries have been particularly forthcoming in providing aid to Ukraine. As a percentage of GDP, their donations have been among the highest in NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/695PXo4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Aid to Ukraine from Baltic Countries and Illustrative Others (% of GDP).&lt;/strong&gt; Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/&quot;&gt;“Ukraine Support Tracker,” Kiel Institute for the World Economy, February 24, 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One downside of the support is the depletion of inventories. All countries have experienced these problems because stockpiles of weapons and munitions were not sized for protracted conflict. This has been a particular problem for the Baltic countries because of their small size. Lithuanian defense minister Arvydas Anusauskas noted, “Part of the support was taken out of our capabilities and now we want to compensate for these capabilities. Delays exist here, delays exist in Europe as well. … Certain capabilities cannot be replaced fast.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-united-states-committed-to-nato-but-distracted-by-china&quot;&gt;The United States: Committed to NATO but Distracted by China&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration has been emphatic that its commitment to NATO’s Article 5 is “sacrosanct.” As evidence of this, the United States rushed 24,000 troops to Eastern Europe to strengthen deterrence after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. These new forces augmented U.S. forces already in Eastern Europe, making a total of 100,000 permanently stationed and rotational personnel. This was consistent with the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), which describes Russia as an “acute threat,” specifically stating: “Contemptuous of its neighbors’ independence, Russia’s government seeks to use force to impose border changes and to reimpose an imperial sphere influence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A much-diminished U.S. force structure in Europe implemented these actions. The U.S. Army, for example, has only 2 permanently stationed combat brigades, down from a Cold War level of 14. Overall, the number of U.S. military personnel in Europe declined from 350,000 at the end of the Cold War to 66,000 in 2014. Beginning in 2014, the European Reassurance Initiative, now known as the European Deterrence Initiative, halted this decline, providing funds to maintain the level of U.S. forces in Europe and to rotate a heavy brigade from the United States into Eastern Europe. Defense of the Baltic countries benefited directly through facility construction and additional exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congress has paid particular attention to the security of the Baltic states. In FY 2021 and FY 2022, it appropriated a total of $349 million in U.S. Department of Defense security assistance funding through the Baltic Security Initiative. There are congressional proposals for this support to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Biden administration’s 2021 Global Posture Review made minor adjustments in Europe. For example, it rescinded the Trump administration’s cap on forces in Germany and announced small force increases in Europe for a U.S. Army multi-domain task force and a theater fires headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, responding to Russian aggression, President Biden announced much larger enhancements to U.S. forces in Europe, including&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;forward elements of a corps headquarters in Poland;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;additional U.S. Navy destroyers in Spain;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;a rotational brigade headquartered in Romania;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;additional rotational deployments in the Baltic states; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;two additional F-35 squadrons to the United Kingdom and additional air defense and other capabilities in Germany and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, global commitments mitigate the U.S. role in Europe. Although the war in Ukraine has redirected U.S. attention toward Europe, the NDS identifies China as the “pacing competition.” As the NDS notes, “the most comprehensive and serious challenge to U.S. national security is the PRC’s coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region in the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences.” That gives the Indo-Pacific theater priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;global-commitments-mitigating-us-role-in-europe&quot;&gt;Global Commitments Mitigating U.S. Role in Europe&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the NDS is clear that the United States can only fight one great power at a time: “To deter opportunistic aggression elsewhere, while the United States is involved in an all-domain conflict, the Department will employ a range of risk mitigation efforts rooted in integrated deterrence.” Translated from bland bureaucratic language, this means that if the United States is involved in a conflict with China (an “all domain conflict”), it will not have sufficient military forces to take on Russia at the same time. Instead, the United States will use unspecified “risk mitigation efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent with this focus on the Indo-Pacific, the NDS envisions U.S. posture in Europe as focusing on “command and control, fires, and key enablers that complement our NATO Allies’ capabilities and strengthen deterrence by increasing combat capability.” That means that the United States will not provide combat forces but will help Europeans bring their forces to bear more effectively. Thus, Europeans must play a major, even dominant role in Baltic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hovering over this Europe versus Asia tension is the uncertain future of the U.S. defense budget and strategy. Administration requests have remained flat after the Trump buildup from FY 2017 to FY 2019. For several years, defense hawks in Congress succeeded in adding money above the request to cover inflation and new investment. However, Republican deficit hawks have regained strength. The recent budget deal caps defense spending in FY 2024 and FY 2025 below the rate of inflation and, if continued beyond FY 2025, would return the national security budget to the days of sequestration. This will force trade-offs between Europe and Asia. Fortunately, funding to support Ukraine is not restricted by the caps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the budget debates, the progressive left and populist right have questioned the fundamental tenets of U.S. strategy. The progressive left has for many decades believed that defense spending could be better used domestically and that the United States has a malign influence in global affairs. The populist right, energized by former president Trump, believes that the United States should not be solving other countries’ problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a group of strategists would have the United States focus exclusively on China and the Pacific, disengaging from other regions, including Europe, regarding them as distractions. As Elbridge Colby, a prominent advocate for focusing on China, has argued: “Getting bogged down in Europe will impede the U.S.’s ability to compete with China in the Pacific. … Rather than increasing forces in Europe, the U.S. should be moving towards reductions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project’s working group thought these strategy and budget concerns would cause some stepping back from the current emphasis on Europe. However, the United States’ global focus and bureaucratic inertia would mean a continuing presence in Europe. There remains a strong bipartisan consensus in Congress for an internationally engaged foreign policy and the robust budgets needed to support it. The working group also noted that maintaining that consensus requires constant effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There remains a strong bipartisan consensus in Congress for an internationally engaged foreign policy and the robust budgets needed to support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;baltic-memories&quot;&gt;Baltic Memories&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One element that has not changed is the memory that Baltic citizens have of the Soviet occupations of 1940–1941 and 1944–1990 (Nazi Germany occupied the Baltic countries from 1941 to 1944). During these times, Lithuania ceased to exist as an independent country, although the United States and others did not recognize the legitimacy of this occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans need to recognize the profound difference in perspectives these occupations have produced. On this side of the Atlantic, defense of the Baltic states is an important national security interest, with the international balance of power and diplomatic reputations at stake. For citizens of the Baltic countries, it is a question of national survival and, in many cases, personal survival. They cannot afford to get it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under Soviet rule, free elections ended, forced collectivization of agriculture impoverished farmers, religion was suppressed, national culture was Russified, and over 100,000 citizens were deported to Siberia. In Lithuania, armed resistance to Soviet rule sprang up under the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters and continued through 1953 but was crushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;threats-to-baltic-security-1&quot;&gt;Threats to Baltic Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major threat to the Baltic states comes from Russia. Thus, thinking about the future of threats requires thinking about the future of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;postwar-russia-authoritarianism-revanchism-suspicion-of-the-west-and-military-power&quot;&gt;Postwar Russia: Authoritarianism, Revanchism, Suspicion of the West, and Military Power&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine will eventually end, and the future of the Russian threat depends heavily on how it ends. At one extreme, the Russian armed forces could collapse and take the Putin regime with it. At the other extreme, a ceasefire or frozen conflict would allow Putin to keep some conquered territory and assert a narrative of victory. Between these extremes, many intermediary possibilities exist. The outcome will drive the shape of Russia’s postwar politics and military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the war’s outcome, a few things are clear. Despite the hopes of the West and many of Russia’s people, postwar Russia is unlikely to become a liberal democracy at peace with its neighbors. As scholars Liana Fix and Michael Kimmage argue, “Even if Putin loses his grip on Russia, the country is unlikely to emerge as a pro-Western democracy. … Policymakers would not be wrong to hope for a better Russia and for a time when a post-war Russia could be genuinely integrated into Europe. … They would be foolish, however, not to prepare for darker possibilities.” Instead, Russia will likely be authoritarian, revanchist, suspicious of the West, and a major military power. The sections below summarize expert views on these themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Despite the hopes of the West and many of Russia’s people, postwar Russia is unlikely to become a liberal democracy at peace with its neighbors. ... Instead, Russia will most likely be authoritarian, revanchist, suspicious of the West, and a major military power.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authoritarianism:&lt;/strong&gt; Putin has used the war in Ukraine to strengthen the government’s grip over the country. Use of the internet has been restricted, dissent has been suppressed, and severe penalties have been imposed for opposing the government. This has been the rule rather than the exception throughout Russian history. Except for brief periods of quasi-democratic rule (1905–1918 and 1991–2004) Russia has been an authoritarian state.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revanchism:&lt;/strong&gt; Putin signaled his views early on by lamenting the breakup of the Soviet Union: “Above all, we should acknowledge that the collapse of the Soviet Union was a major geopolitical disaster of the century.” Nor has this perspective been the aberration of one man. Russia has been an empire since the days of Peter the Great and did not become post-imperial when it became post-Communist. When Putin seized Crimea in 2014, the Russian people responded enthusiastically. Thus, Russia will continue its efforts to reassert control over the territories its predecessors ruled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suspicion of the West:&lt;/strong&gt; According to Andrei Kolesnikov, Putin has made suspicion of the West a major element in his regime’s legitimacy, casting the war as “a civilizational battle between the forces of good, embodied by Russia, and the forces of evil, sometimes called ‘satanic,’ personified by the United States and its allies.” As with the other elements discussed here, this has a long history. Russians have long been suspicious that their European neighbors either look down on them or are preparing to invade them. The Kremlin has reinforced these ideas in the population through its control of the media.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Military power:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia has immense natural resources (e.g., oil, natural gas, metals, and agricultural lands), a large population (143 million), and a territory that spans 11 time zones. It has strong military traditions and the means to maintain a large military, including infrastructure and institutions, military stocks leftover from Soviet times, and a broadly capable defense industry. It also has nuclear weapons. All this will make Russia a major military power regardless of what happens politically in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that whatever regime follows Putin — whether that regime arrives soon because of the war or in the distant future as a result of Putin’s natural aging — it will likely share these views even if it does not have, at least initially, the political power that Putin has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Fix and Kimmage noted in the opening quotation of this section, NATO should hope for the best but plan for the worst. This approach served NATO well during the Cold War. From its very first strategic concept, NATO’s plans to deter a conflict with the Soviet Union — and fight one if necessary — assumed Moscow’s “maximum intentions and capabilities.” Prudence, combined with an unpredictable, risk-tolerant Kremlin committed to violent revisionism, requires NATO’s leaders and military planners to make the same assumption today. As an Estonian general put it recently: “The times aren’t going to be easier for us in the near future. … Russia’s threat is not getting smaller.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Russia has been an empire since the days of Peter the Great and did not become post-imperial when it became post-Communist.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;threat-environment-short-term-opportunity-and-long-term-dangers&quot;&gt;Threat Environment: Short-Term Opportunity and Long-Term Dangers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how the war in Ukraine turns out, Russia’s military capabilities for ground operations will be much reduced for many years. Its forces have been devastated, and its people are tired and disillusioned. Reconstitution will take time. The annual threat assessment of the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence makes this point: “Moscow’s military forces have suffered losses during the Ukraine conflict that will require years of rebuilding and leave them less capable of posing a conventional military threat to European security, and operating as assertively in Eurasia and on the global stage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this loss of capability, Table 1 shows the beginning levels and estimated losses for several categories of military power as of June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian capability losses have not been limited to forces and equipment. Lithuania reports that cyberattacks and infiltration by intelligence services have decreased, at least temporarily, as Russia’s resources and attention have focused on Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives the Europeans a window during which they can rebuild their forces. It is particularly an opportunity to invest in programs with longer timelines, such as facilities, supporting civilian infrastructure, and equipment modernization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With time, however, Russia will rebuild its military capability. How long will that take?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near term, Russia plans to increase the size of its armed forces from 900,000 personnel prewar to 1.1 million personnel today and 1.5 million in the future. Russia hopes to increase the number of contract soldiers (volunteers) from 450,000 to 650,000. In addition, Russia is adding two divisions — one army and one naval infantry — in the Western Military District.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates vary regarding the time required for a full rebuilding. Private discussions with officials from the Baltic region indicate that they believe this timeline is about five years once the war ends. Other estimates are as short as two months or as long as decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSIS analysis indicates that Russian defense industry may not be as badly damaged by the war and sanctions as originally thought. While these interactions have taken their toll, “the Kremlin still possesses a significant degree of adaptability to Western sanctions, taking advantage of its prewar stockpiles of older equipment, as well as countries willing to supply Moscow with restricted dual-use items and technology via a web of illicit supply chains.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The working group participants for this project judged that this reconstitution would take five to seven years, though they acknowledged the great uncertainty in making such an estimate. They pointed out that elements would be rebuilt at different rates, with ammunition and lower-tech items being ready earlier than high-tech items such as missiles. Some force elements, such as the Russian navy, have been relatively unaffected by the war and will be ready quickly. Other elements, such as the armored forces, may take many years to recover. Further, a rebuilt Russian military would likely look different from the prewar Russian military, having incorporated lessons learned from the Ukraine war. It might also be a battle-hardened military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is clear: whether sooner or later, the time will come when Russia will again be able to threaten its neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In making a judgment about Russian reconstitution, NATO needs to avoid mirror imaging. Putin has shown that he was willing to take risks that most NATO nations would regard as imprudent. He might strike with forces that NATO believes are inadequate. The fact that NATO nations might be correct in this judgment does not change Putin’s calculation. NATO needs to be ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Sooner or later, the time will come when Russia will again be able to threaten its neighbors. ... NATO needs to be ready.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-russia-strikes-&quot;&gt;If Russia Strikes …&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One useful outcome of the Russian attack on Ukraine is that the world can now see how Russia conducts military operations. The fact that the invasion failed to achieve a rapid victory is unlikely to change the fundamentals of Russia’s military planning because of their deep institutional and cultural roots. Instead, the Russian military will incorporate lessons learned from the Ukraine war in order to do better next time. Based on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, future attacks will likely have five key elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shock and awe:&lt;/strong&gt; Shock and awe refer to a campaign designed to strike so suddenly and violently that it causes panic and paralysis in an adversary and allows the early achievement of military goals. It fits with Russian doctrine about violent attack, and the concept structured the initial phases of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. To achieve mutually reinforcing effects, this campaign will likely consist of strikes in different geographical areas, across different domains, and across the entire geography of the target.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decapitation of national leadership:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia was reported to have sent assassination teams after President Volodymyr Zelensky when the war began. The assassination teams failed, likely because of Ukrainian precautions, both by having leaders move frequently and by rapidly setting up effective protection systems. This was not an unprecedented operation for the Russians; decapitation is part of Russia’s standard tool kit. It used the same tactic in its 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, when special forces teams landed at the presidential palace and killed the Afghan president.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missile strikes against fixed military targets:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia had considerable success in striking military targets at the beginning of the war. Its failing was that the Ukrainians had dispersed many assets and the Russian kill chain did not operate fast enough to respond. Russia will certainly try to execute a disabling initial strike in future operations but with faster kill chains to make dispersion less successful. In conducting such strikes, the Russians will likely inflict many civilian casualties and extensive collateral damage to civilian infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep heliborne insertions:&lt;/strong&gt; Russia tried to capture Hostomel airfield northwest of Kyiv at the outset of the war. The attack was a near-run thing, but Ukraine’s counterattack eventually dispersed the Russian forces. If the landing had succeeded, Russia could have airlifted forces directly into the battle for the capital rather than trying to push them down the long highway from Belarus that was clogged with vehicles and under fire. The high payoff for such risky operations makes them attractive to Russian military planners.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep attacks by armored columns:&lt;/strong&gt; Russian doctrine for such attacks dates to the Soviet era and was honed during the great offensives of World War II. They are part of Russia’s military DNA. Thus, Russian armored columns pushed south from Belarus and southwest from Russia proper to capture Kyiv. These columns initially made substantial progress but then bogged down in the face of Ukrainian resistance and poor Russian logistics. Russian columns attacking toward Kherson and Mariupol were more successful. The Russians are certainly looking at this experience and figuring out how next time they might build on the successes and overcome the weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These patterns of Russian attacks have profound implications for Baltic security preparations. A Russian attack will be swift, violent, and aimed at rapid and complete victory. There will be little time for troops to deploy and get into position. For this reason, commentators have expressed concerns about a Russian fait accompli — the rapid establishment of facts on the ground before NATO can react effectively. This would force NATO into the role of aggressor as it slowly builds forces and counterattacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-military-status-of-the-baltic-states-1&quot;&gt;The Military Status of the Baltic States&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Baltic states are taking strong measures to defend themselves, their exposed position, small size, and the scale of the Russian threat mean that they need help from other NATO countries. For example, as a percentage of GDP, the defense spending of all Baltic countries exceeds NATO’s 2 percent goal that was set at the Wales summit in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/4f3wRnM.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: NATO Defense Expenditures as a Share of Real GDP, 2022.&lt;/strong&gt; Note: Lithuania shown at the 2023 level of 2.52 percent.

&lt;p&gt;However, because the economies of Baltic states are so small, the resulting military budgets are modest, barely visible when compared to other NATO countries (see Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/by0XcBW.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic states have increased their military budgets substantially as the threat from Russia has increased. Figure 4 shows Lithuania’s military budgets from 2008, during the period before Crimea, when Europe was thought to be an exporter of security, to today. Lithuania’s military budget has nearly tripled over that time, rising faster than the defense budgets of other NATO countries and even faster than its fellow Baltic countries, Estonia and Latvia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To acquire the personnel needed to build a more robust defense, all the Baltic states have reinstituted conscription: Estonia in 1992, Lithuania in 2016, and Latvia in 2023. Only four other countries in NATO currently have conscription (Denmark, Finland, Greece, and Turkey). Lithuania has increased the number of personnel in uniform by 70 percent since joining NATO in 2004. The increase has mainly been in the army since a ground invasion is most threatening. Air and naval capabilities have remained small and relatively constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality does not seem to have suffered. Lithuanian forces regularly train with and against NATO troops. One article celebrated Lithuanian ambush skills against U.S. forces in a 2021 training exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oHQs4NB.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic countries are far ahead of most of the rest of NATO in terms of the percentage of the population in uniform. Table 3 shows the Baltic countries and an illustrative sample of other NATO countries. However, small population size limits what the Baltic states can do. For example, Lithuania has about four times as much of its population in uniform as Germany, yet Germany’s armed forces are eight times larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/dIRGLMG.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Baltic nations are already more committed than most countries to NATO and European security. Could they do more, such as increase spending to 3 percent of GDP? All three Baltic countries have proposed such a goal. A Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) study proposes this as a way to equip the Baltic forces with modern weapons, particularly anti-tank and air defense systems, and to build facilities for rapid reinforcement. However, such a proposal goes beyond the scope of this study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the Baltic states increased their already substantial efforts, their small size and lack of strategic resources mean any substantial enhancements to Baltic security will need to be a whole-of-NATO effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gaps-and-geostrategic-vulnerabilities-in-deterrence-and-defense-1&quot;&gt;Gaps and Geostrategic Vulnerabilities in Deterrence and Defense&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to a hostile Russia, the location, small sizes, and limited resources of the Baltic states creates several vulnerabilities, including a lack of strategic depth, a time and distance challenge for reinforcements, and constricted access through the Suwałki Gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-geostrategic-problem-lack-of-strategic-depth&quot;&gt;The Geostrategic Problem: Lack of Strategic Depth&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of their small size, the Baltic countries have a major geostrategic problem: their lack of strategic depth. Whereas Ukraine has been able to defend in depth and use that depth to buy time for strengthening its forces, the Baltic countries have no such option. Their capitals lie only a short distance from a threat border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hNBjeji.png&quot; alt=&quot;image08&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 4: Distance of Capital City from Nearest Threat Border.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Google Maps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom row of Table 4 compares distances to capital cities from the closest threat border with the deepest Russian advance toward Kyiv in March 2022. Even though the Russians were unable to capture Kyiv, such an advance would have been sufficient to threaten any of the Baltic country capitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2016 RAND study explored the problem of a sudden Russian invasion in the case of Estonia and Latvia. The study concluded that “the outcome was, bluntly, a disaster for NATO. Russian forces … were at the gates of or actually entering Riga, Tallinn, or both between 36 and 60 hours after the start of hostilities.” The study further concluded that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;rapid initial defeat would leave NATO with unattractive options: a bloody counteroffensive, escalation, or temporary acceptance;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the light forces of the Baltic states and the rapidly deployable forces of NATO would be inadequate in the face of Russian heavy forces; and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;airpower could slow attackers but alone could not stop the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study recommended a large, permanently stationed force of seven brigades, including three armor brigades, to buy enough time for reinforcements to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RAND wargame is not without its detractors, who argue it was unrealistic on several fronts, ranging from the strategic rationale of a Russian invasion (although in hindsight, perhaps that is not implausible) to the provocation that further forward deployments would constitute to the Russians, given the vulnerability of their position in the Baltic. The success of infantry anti-tank weapons during the early stages of the war in Ukraine might reduce the number of heavy units required if the analysis were updated. Regardless of the political considerations, the study’s pessimistic military analysis has been widely accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discussions about threat borders might seem irrelevant to Lithuania since, unlike the other Baltic countries, it does not border the main territory of Russia but instead borders Belarus to the east. Belarus’s military forces are small (45,000) and designed to maintain territorial integrity. About 40 percent are conscripts with limited training and deployability. Belarus might be viewed as a buffer between Lithuania and Russia. In fact, Belarus acts as an extension of Russian territory for military planning purposes. It allowed Russian troops to use its territory for the invasion of Ukraine pursuant to a 1997 treaty. Belarus continues to provide Russia with training areas and logistical bases. Further, it has authorized the movement of Russian nuclear weapons onto its territory, and the first weapons may have already arrived as of June 2023. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that Belarus will allow Russia to use its territory in future conflicts even if Belarus does not participate itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuania also borders the Russian outpost of Kaliningrad to the southwest. Although Russia is unlikely to conduct a major ground attack from Kaliningrad — many of the local ground forces were rotated to Ukraine and suffered heavy losses — it could harass Lithuanian forces and launch air and missile strikes from the enclave. Indeed, Kaliningrad can establish a strong defensive bubble, often called an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capability, with anti-ship missile units and medium-range Iskander missiles. Kaliningrad’s air defenses are exceptionally strong — six S-400 battalions and two S-300 battalions — allowing it to threaten NATO air movement and likely prevent airlift to Lithuania during a conflict because of the particularly high vulnerability of large cargo aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 5 shows the range of Russian air defense systems based in Kaliningrad. As is evident, the systems can cover the entire country of Lithuania and most of Latvia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/RdgmqnZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image09&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;natos-time-and-distance-problem&quot;&gt;NATO’s Time and Distance Problem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of strategic depth might be manageable if NATO could reinforce quickly. That was NATO’s plan during the Cold War, where West Germany had very little territory to trade and was, in any case, unwilling to cede territory for political reasons. However, the short distance from peacetime garrisons to wartime positions meant that NATO forces could get into position quickly, increasing the chances that they would be ready when conflict began. Table 5 shows the deployment distances for an illustrative group of Cold War combat units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/i3sqDMF.png&quot; alt=&quot;image10&quot; /&gt;

Coordinates from Google Maps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation in the Baltic countries today is entirely different. Baltic forces can get to the front lines quickly, as can the NATO forward-deployed battle groups. However, as Table 6 shows using the Lithuanian battle group as an illustration, reinforcing NATO forces and any battle group units still in their home countries have much longer distances to travel, up to 10 times as far as during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uHpYJ3Y.png&quot; alt=&quot;image11&quot; /&gt;

Source: Google Maps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent assessment by two researchers at the Brookings Institution confirms this problem. As they conclude:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Through comparing the relative combat power of NATO’s forces in the Baltics with Russia’s forces in its Western Military District and Kaliningrad oblast, we confirmed that the NATO capability gaps identified in previous studies remain large. We also found that potential NATO high readiness reinforcements would be incapable of closing the gaps for at least a month in a crisis scenario. These capability shortcomings clearly hinder the United States’ and NATO’s ongoing efforts to conventionally deter Russian aggression in the Baltics or to decisively respond in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distance is not the only challenge. During the Cold War, military planners were deeply concerned about whether there would be enough time after strategic warning for NATO to come to a decision about mobilization and then execute the required tactical movements. Those concerns are much greater today because the threat is more distant and the number of NATO countries has doubled since the Cold War, meaning reaching a decision to respond to Russian attacks may take longer. Admiral James Stavridis, former supreme commander of NATO, likened NATO decisionmaking to having, at that time, “28 pairs of hands on the steering wheel.” This is a particular challenge today, as some states have developed different views about the Russian threat and where to draw the line between prudent precautions and unnecessary provocations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Because the threat is more distant and the number of NATO countries has doubled since the Cold War ... reaching a decision to respond to Russian attacks may take longer.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;challenges-to-moving-forces-to-the-baltic-region&quot;&gt;Challenges to Moving Forces to the Baltic Region&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physically moving military forces within Europe is difficult. The existing road and rail infrastructure is superb for moving masses of people and civilian goods. However, it is not well designed for moving heavy military equipment. There are legal and bureaucratic impediments to moving military equipment with respect to diplomatic clearance, transportation safety regulations, and differing ammunition transport standards between countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2017 study from the U.S. Army concluded that the “reality is that it is extremely difficult to provide sustainment to exercises and forces deployed into Eastern Europe and the Baltic regions due to cumbersome and time-consuming requirements to gain diplomatic and security clearances for convoys. The long lead time (normally 30 days), specificity required, and inability to change requests make the process a great hindrance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is seeking to reduce these barriers through its Permanent Structured Cooperation Organization (PESCO), which has a project on “simplifying and standardizing cross-border military transport procedures.” The project needs to come to an agreement on ways to expedite movement and then implement it. The Baltic countries will not have time to wait for bureaucratic procedures in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-suwałki-gap-problem&quot;&gt;The Suwałki Gap Problem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Cold War, the Fulda Gap — an area of open ground among the hills near Frankfurt that provided the shortest route from East Germany to the river Rhine — gained almost mythical status as the most likely invasion route for Warsaw Pact forces into West Germany, a NATO ally. This strategic pinch point became the focus of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces stationed in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s equivalent is the Suwałki Gap, also known as the “Kaliningrad Corridor.” As the map shows, this is the 40-mile (65-kilometer) gap between Kaliningrad and Belarus where Lithuania borders Poland. Russian artillery stationed on both sides, in Kaliningrad and Belarus, could cover the entire corridor. A complete closure of the corridor is probably beyond the capabilities of the Russian forces available. Nevertheless, the Lithuanians also worry that the Russians might attempt the high risk/high reward operation of using ground forces to seal the gap, even if temporarily. In any case, the Russians would try to slow NATO reinforcements, either by interdicting networks or by forcing a time-consuming operation to suppress the artillery. Thus, NATO forces moving by ground might have to run a gauntlet of fire. In peacetime, the corridor constitutes a flashpoint similar to the Berlin corridors during the Cold War. Incidents might easily arise during the transit of Russian equipment and personnel through NATO territory to Kaliningrad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/HuoYuK3.png&quot; alt=&quot;image12&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 6: Map of the Suwałki Gap.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Suwałki Gap is a major problem for NATO military planners as it is vital for the defense of the Baltic countries but is far from NATO centers of power. Solving the Suwałki Gap problem is a matter for every NATO member, but it has particular implications for both Lithuania and Poland, which border the area. They are best placed to host the forward-deployed forces required to keep the gap open in a no-notice or short-notice invasion scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;made-in-madrid-1&quot;&gt;Made in Madrid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NATO’s Commitments to Strengthen Defense and Deterrence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian aggression in Crimea and Ukraine has reenergized the NATO alliance. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine ended NATO’s post–Cold War strategy of engagement with Russia. Over the last two decades, NATO allies have collectively realized they must strengthen their own defenses to deter an aggressive Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This realization was captured in NATO’s new strategic concept and in a series of commitments made at the leaders’ summit in Madrid to turn the strategic concept into reality by strengthening defense and deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter offers a brief assessment of the current status of those commitments. It concludes that NATO will struggle to implement them ahead of the Vilnius summit next month, as the secretary general initially promised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-new-nato-strategic-concept&quot;&gt;The New NATO Strategic Concept&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Madrid summit in June 2022, NATO approved a new strategic concept, the eighth since the alliance began. In addition to European military security, the concept covers a broad set of topics such as Chinese assertiveness, terrorism, climate change, the role of women, and arms control. The key change for European security is highlighting Russia as an immediate threat: “The Russian Federation’s war of aggression against Ukraine has shattered peace and greatly altered our security environment. … The Russian Federation is the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.” The concept reiterates the alliance’s defensive purpose and three core tasks: deterrence and defense, crisis prevention and management, and collective security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;At the Madrid summit in June 2022, NATO approved a new strategic concept, the eighth since the alliance began. The key change for European security is highlighting Russia as an immediate threat.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several items are particularly relevant to Baltic security:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, this concept rejects the previous “deterrence by reinforcement” approach and instead states, “we will deter and defend forward with robust in-place, multi-domain, combat-ready forces.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building on this theme, the concept states the intention “to defend every inch of Alliance territory, preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all allies and prevail against any aggressor.” That rules out a strategy of withdrawal and counterattack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concept emphasizes readiness: “We will continue to enhance the collective readiness, responsiveness, deployability, integration and interoperability of our forces.” High readiness is necessary to implement a forward defense strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The concept endorses nuclear modernization, recognizing the need to offset Russia’s modernized nuclear forces. Further, the concept recognizes the need to develop mechanisms for countering Russian nuclear saber rattling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, the concept highlights the importance of resources, without which concepts will remain just words and lack real-world impact: “We will ensure our nations meet the commitments under the Defense Investment Pledge, in its entirety, to provide the full range of required capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;establishment-of-forward-deployed-forces&quot;&gt;Establishment of Forward-Deployed Forces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, NATO established four battle groups of reinforced battalion size in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. These missions — known as Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) — host multinational forces under the leadership of the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and the United States, respectively. In 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, NATO established four additional EFP battle groups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, led by Italy, Hungary, France, and Czechia, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four northeast battle groups currently fall under NATO’s Multinational Corps Northeast located in Szczecin, Poland. For coordination of training and preparation activities, the Lithuanian battle group comes under the Multinational Division Northeast in Elbląg, Poland. Troops in Latvia and Estonia come under Multinational Division North in Ādaži, Latvia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the battle groups is their small, “proportionate” size, intended to emphasize their defensive purpose. The battlegroup in Lithuania, one of the largest, had about 1,200 personnel prewar and has about 1,600 personnel today, thanks to Germany reinforcing its forces after the war began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/xsu5eSH.png&quot; alt=&quot;image13&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a statement of support for the Baltic countries and an enhancement to deterrence, these battle groups are an important addition to NATO’s efforts in Eastern Europe. Over half of NATO member countries participate in the four battle groups involved with Baltic security, and all NATO members participate in the eight battle groups. Putting troops on the ground is a powerful statement about political support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As warfighting organizations, however, the battle groups have serious weaknesses arising fromthe constant rotations and the diverse national elements, leading some critics to refer to them as “Christmas tree units.” The fact that the battle groups have been operating for several years helps, but the history of multinational warfighting organizations is not a happy one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s forward deployments are not limited to land forces. NATO’s Air Policing mission was established during the Cold War in 1961 and has been operational for over 60 years. While NATO has been protecting the Baltic skies since 2004, the Air Policing mission was strengthened in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 when a persistent presence based in Ämari Air Base in Estonia was added in addition to the existing presence at Šiauliai Air Base in Lithuania. This was further enhanced in 2022 by additional aircraft in Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania. These forces regularly intercept Russian aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, NATO’s Air Shielding mission was added in 2022 to “provide a near-seamless shield from the Baltic to the Black Sea, ensuring NATO allies are better able to safeguard and protect alliance territory, populations, and forces.” The Air Shielding mission comprises ground-based air defense systems deployed across Eastern Europe, including a Spanish NASAMs unit in Lithuania, alongside fighter aircraft operating in air defense roles through the Air Policing mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO has increased maritime readiness and forward deployments as well. In 2022, NATO’s Standing Naval Forces came under the command of NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) for the first time as part of the NATO Response Force. These forces comprise four groups: two Standing NATO Maritime Groups and two Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Groups. They are informally supported by the maritime forces organized under the Joint Expeditionary Force, a group of 10 northern European militaries led by the United Kingdom. The addition of Finland, and potentially Sweden, to the NATO alliance also opens new possibilities for strengthening the security of the Baltic Sea through NATO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nato-reinforcement-plans-and-capabilities&quot;&gt;NATO Reinforcement Plans and Capabilities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increased budget resources have allowed NATO to expand its capabilities. For example, the 2018 NATO Readiness Initiative set a goal of “four 30s”: 30 infantry battalions, 30 air squadrons, and 30 naval ships, all available in 30 days. This builds on previous initiatives for a NATO response force and a 5,000-service member “spearhead force.” In the summer of 2022, NATO announced an even more ambitious goal under its new NATO force model, a high readiness force of 300,000 troops. However, the scope of this announcement appeared to take some allies by surprise. Generating realistic plans to meet this ambitious goal will be a focus of the Vilnius summit and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an illustration of these reinforcement capabilities, NATO rushed troops to the east when Russia invaded Ukraine. Over 40,000 troops, plus air and naval assets, were placed under the direct command of SACEUR. The United States bolstered its presence in Europe by over 20,000 troops. Four new EFP battlegroups were added in Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2022, NATO announced an even more ambitious goal under its new NATO force model, a high readiness force of 300,000 troops. However, the scope of this announcement appeared to take some allies by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom sent forces to Estonia and Poland, the French and Belgians sent forces to Romania, and the Germans sent a reinforced company to Lithuania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant change in NATO force readiness in Eastern Europe is Poland’s emergence as a military power. It is the hub of support going to Ukraine and has expanded its military capabilities. As Polish ambassador Marek Magieroswki noted at a CSIS conference, “Poland has been perceived until recently as a net recipient of security. Now we are trying to transition to a new role of net provider of security.” This bodes well for a NATO response to a future crisis in the Baltic region since reinforcing forces must flow through Poland, and Poland needs to take a major role in keeping the Suwałki Gap open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;madrid-summit-commitments-and-their-current-status&quot;&gt;Madrid Summit Commitments and Their Current Status&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO held its annual summit in Madrid on June 23–29, 2022. Making this summit unique, however, was the upfront statement that “war has returned to the European continent.” The summit’s main focus was therefore the war in Ukraine. The summit condemned Russia’s “war of aggression,” committed to “democracy, individual liberty, human rights, and the rule of law,” and pledged “unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Madrid summit, NATO allies made several commitments to implement the defense and deterrence measures in NATO’s new strategic concept. Shown below are the commitments most relevant to Baltic security and an assessment of their status as of June 2023. The assessments are summarized below in Table 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. “We will build on our newly enhanced posture, and significantly strengthen our deterrence and defence for the long term to ensure the security and defence of all Allies.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO’s long-term commitment to strengthening deterrence is underpinned by the defense spending of allies. As the Madrid declaration also stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We reaffirm our commitment to the Defence Investment Pledge in its entirety. We will build on that pledge and decide next year on subsequent commitments beyond 2024. We will ensure that our political decisions are adequately resourced. We will build on the progress made to ensure that increased national defence expenditures and NATO common funding will be commensurate with the challenges of a more contested security order. Investing in our defence and key capabilities is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, NATO military budgets increased 32 percent from 2015 to 2020 (see Figure 7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/TWROJvX.png&quot; alt=&quot;image14&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 7: NATO Europe and Canada Total Defense Expenditures, Annual Percentage Change.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Derived from NATO annual expenditure chart. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2022/6/pdf/220627-def-exp-2022-en.pdf&quot;&gt;NATO, “Defense Expenditure of NATO Countries (2013–2020),” Press release, June 27, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Reported as percentages based on 2015 prices and exchange rates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 2014 Wales summit, NATO members set a target of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. As Figure 2 showed, the number of nations meeting the 2 percent spending target increased to 10 in 2022. Member states on NATO’s eastern flank in particular have taken steps to meet and, in some cases, exceed the goal. This includes Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. The United States, United Kingdom, Croatia, and Greece also meet the goal. Secretary General Stoltenberg has expressed confidence in continued improvement: “Nineteen allies have clear plans to reach it by 2024, and an additional five have concrete commitments to meet it thereafter.” Still, 21 states do not now meet the goal. Indeed, even though the total wealth of the United States and European NATO countries is roughly the same, Europe has typically decided to spend around half what the United States does on defense, hence the saying: “Americans are from Mars, Europeans from Venus.” There is much room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Germany remains the key outlier. Since 2014, it has increased its defense budget by 32 percent in constant dollars, but the country’s defense budget still constitutes only 1.5 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, even this modest GDP percentage produces Europe’s second-largest military budget, so German policy matters a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the invasion, Germany announced a dramatic change in its national security policy, proposing to increase military spending to 2 percent of GDP, including the creation of a €100 billion ($112 billion) investment fund. Although the FY 2023 budget does not show much growth, the FY 2024 budget will reportedly include a €10 billion increase, a 20 percent jump if implemented. However, Germany is finding out how hard it is to fulfill a dramatic announcement and to break with half a century of Ostpolitik — Germany’s long-standing effort to reach out to the east, originally to the Soviet-bloc countries and, later, Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does Europe spend less, but the fragmented nature of its military and industrial base means it produces much less “bang” for its euro than the United States does for its “buck.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has exacerbated Europe’s “defense dilemma” — while defense spending has risen, defense cooperation has fallen. This leads to serious inefficiencies in European defense. As a result, some have advocated for a stronger European pillar in NATO, enshrined within NATO’s defense planning targets. Part of the solution will also be encouraging more cooperation between European allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. “Allies have committed to deploy additional robust in-place combat-ready forces on our eastern flank, to be scaled up from the existing battle groups to brigade-size units where and when required. …”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The centerpiece of the Madrid commitments to strengthen defense and deterrence was the pledge to increase the size of the combat forces deployed under the eight EFP missions across NATO’s eastern flank. This may be the most demanding commitment, given the costs and infrastructure required to generate combat ready, in-place forces that need to be housed, trained, exercised, supplied, and enabled through command and control structures. However, NATO has no choice: its “new” strategy of forward defense is not credible without them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO has taken several steps toward this goal in the 12 months since the Madrid summit. In the Baltic region, two EFP missions have demonstrated their ability to rapidly scale up to brigade level through multinational exercises: the U.S.-led battle group in Poland and the UK-led battle group in Estonia. Germany, the framework nation for the battle group in Lithuania, has doubled its forces in Lithuania to 1,000 since the beginning of the war in Ukraine in 2022, including deployment of a 100-strong brigade headquarters. Canada and Latvia signed an agreement in Madrid to augment the Canadian-led battlegroup to “work with Latvia and NATO Allies to generate and stage forces in order to surge to a combat capable brigade.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite these positive and necessary steps, none of the Baltic region battle groups have yet been upgraded to brigades. As various commentators and analyses point out, NATO’s forward defense strategy remains a “work in progress.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is the German-led battlegroup in Lithuania. Lithuania’s EFP mission has high visibility because of Lithuania’s vital importance to NATO’s forward defense and deterrence due to its proximity to Belarus and Kaliningrad, as well as the vulnerable Suwałki Gap. Also, Lithuania is hosting the next NATO leaders’ summit in July, which will inevitably highlight the state of NATO’s support to Lithuania’s requirements for defense and deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governments of Germany and Lithuania are in active discussions about how to implement the goal of stationing a full brigade and have reached an agreement in principle. A 2022 joint communiqué states, “Germany is ready to lead a robust and combat-ready brigade in Lithuania dedicated to deter and defend against Russian aggression. Initially, led by a permanently deployed brigade forward command element in Lithuania, this brigade will consist of German combat forces specifically designated for this purpose, potentially augmented by possible multinational contributions.” A joint working group will develop implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same 2022 joint communiqué, Lithuania pledged to provide the required infrastructure, which is quite substantial. For example, a contract for over €110 million ($120 million) was signed in February 2023 to build facilities in Pabradė to accommodate up to 3,000 troops for use “by the NATO Forward Presence troops, US battalions and troops from other allied countries coming to Lithuania.” In addition, three new battalion-size facilities are also under construction in Šilalė, Šiauliai, and Vilnius District. To support garrison and training facilities for a full brigade, Lithuania has stated a multiyear (2023–2027) commitment of €430 million ($470 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda reiterated these points in an April 2023 visit to Germany. He told Lithuanian media that he and German chancellor Olaf Scholz had agreed on the gradual deployment of the German brigade, depending on what progress is made in developing the necessary military infrastructure in Lithuania. He stated that the infrastructure would be ready in 2026. The Germans did not respond directly. Although Lithuania wants a German-led brigade deployed permanently there, German defense minister Boris Pistorius has said it will be “up to NATO.” In May, President Nausėda hosted German president Frank Walter-Steinmeier and again reiterated that “We need your boots on the ground!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the high-level discussions, visits, and communiqués, it remains unclear what the composition of the brigade will be and when it would be fully established in Lithuania after an initial period when the majority would be based in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding composition, the Lithuanians have asked that the brigade be either medium or heavy. Light brigades, they believe, are not credible to the heavily armored Russians. RAND analyses, previously cited, also recommend heavy brigades. However, army units are far too expensive for any Baltic state to field. The annual operations costs for the United States of an armored brigade combat team is $690 million. With support, that rises to $1.8 billion. Lithuania’s entire annual defense budget is $1.6 billion. The Germans seem leaning toward a heavy brigade, which would meet the Lithuanian request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding stationing, the Baltic states have strong opinions. As Artis Pabriks, a former Latvian defense minister, stated, “They should not be in Germany — they should be in Lithuania, at least 70 to 80 percent of the brigade strength.” Lithuania’s concern is that the brigade never develops from its current status of being mostly in Germany to being fully or mostly on the ground in Lithuania. This concern also reflects those of Lithuania’s Baltic and Eastern European neighbors. Just as Germany has stated its preferred solution is to reinforce Lithuania from Germany, the same approach has been advocated by the United Kingdom in Estonia, Canada in Latvia, and France in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that pre-assigning NATO forces is not the same as deploying them. As the saying goes, “virtual presence is actual absence.” If this tension between the Madrid commitments, the needs of the Baltic and Eastern European nations, and the solutions proposed so far by the EFP lead nations is not resolved at the Vilnius summit, this issue may become a litmus test of NATO’s credibility and cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. “… underpinned by credible rapidly available reinforcements, pre-positioned equipment, and enhanced command and control … [including] establishing division-level structures.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-positioned equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-positioned equipment refers to the staging of equipment in the threatened region. It has long been an element of U.S. military preparations, with equipment sets in Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific. The advantage is that personnel are much easier to move than equipment. Thus, combat capability can be established more quickly than by moving an entire unit. Nevertheless, there is some delay in fielding units in a crisis since the troops must physically deploy, then get the equipment out of storage, move to the front lines, and become absorbed in the existing command structure (a process the military calls “reception, staging, onward movement, and integration”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing a set of pre-positioned equipment is complex and expensive, requiring the acquisition of real estate, the building of warehouses, the procurement of extra sets of equipment, and the provision of maintenance support to keep equipment ready during peacetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States has opened a facility in Poland for pre-positioned equipment, though it will take some additional time for the facility to become fully operational. Even getting this far has taken six years. Lithuania is building 30 warehouses and plans to build 70 more. NATO launched the Multinational Ammunition Warehousing Initiative (MAWI) in 2021, which now features 20 members and opened its first facility in Estonia during 2022. The MAWI Eastern Arc “is intended to provide a fully coordinated and integrated multinational approach for enhancing the munition storage infrastructure within the host nations for NATO’s multinational battlegroups.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command and control:&lt;/strong&gt; Planned wartime reinforcements and the upgrade of battle groups to full brigades would bring the number of units to a level requiring a division headquarters on location in peacetime. Estonia has stood up an initial division headquarters, and there are plans for establishing national division headquarters in Latvia. Lithuania just authorized the establishment of a national division headquarters, with full operating capacity set to be reached in 2030. Although Baltic national divisions would have operational functions when augmented in wartime, the “divisions” lack many of the support capabilities (e.g., fires, communications, engineers, and logistics) needed to operate at this level of command and may, therefore, also depend on augmentation by NATO allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unclear is whether the Baltic states have the capability of developing such headquarters individually or whether, as a CSBA report recommends, that capability should be developed regionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of multinational NATO command and control structures, Exercise Griffin Lightning in March proved the readiness of NATO’s newest division level command, Multinational Division North, headquartered in Ādaži, Latvia. It included troop contributions from 13 allies, including the German 1st Armored and Polish 12th Mechanized Divisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. “We welcome the initial offers by Allies to NATO’s new force model, which will strengthen and modernise the NATO Force Structure and will resource our new generation of military plans.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One notable commitment made by NATO in Madrid was to increase its response force of high readiness units from 40,000 to over 300,000 personnel through a new force model. According to NATO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The NATO Force Model will deliver an Allied response at much greater scale and at higher readiness than the current NATO Response Force, which it will replace. It will provide a larger pool of high readiness forces across domains, land, sea, air and cyber, which will be pre-assigned to specific plans for the defence of Allies. It will improve NATO’s ability to respond at very short notice for any contingency and enable Allies to make more forces available to NATO on an assured basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the ambition of the initiative is laudable, it got off to a bad start, with some allies taken by surprise at the scale of the plans announced by Secretary General Stoltenberg. Furthermore, there are few signs the ambition is on track to meet its goal of being completed this year. For example, according to one analysis by a German think tank, the scale of forces required by Germany will be difficult to generate, given that “since 2014, Germany has been unable to provide NATO with a single brigade … providing two more brigades in the brief period remaining will require a superhuman effort.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOI, the Swedish Defence Research Agency, studied the readiness of NATO forces and found severe problems in many areas, especially with Germany, whose capability to “marshal and deploy heavy … formations of brigade size [is] low.” Movement for the German high-readiness Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) brigade from Münster, Germany, to Żagań, Poland, takes approximately 10 days. This is followed by the Initial Follow-on Forces Group, within 30 to 45 days, and the NRF Follow-on Forces Group, which FOI estimates could take months to deploy. The severe readiness shortfalls of German military forces have led some experts to conclude that Germany has a military designed for mobilization rather than for current operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The viability of NATO’s new force model is hard to judge, as implementation detail is very sparse. What is clear is the scale of the commitment. Even the first 300,000 troops at 30 days’ notice — or about 15 to 20 divisions — is far beyond the previous “four 30s” target of 30 battalions. This is an increase of scale of around 10 times. Moreover, this is happening when Europe’s biggest defense spender, the United Kingdom, may struggle to generate one warfighting division by 2025 and Germany cannot generate a brigade. And this is just land forces — serious gaps exist across European navies, air enablers, air defense, and high-end capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. “We will enhance our collective defense exercises to be prepared for high intensity and multi-domain operations and ensure reinforcement of any ally on short notice.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO already has an extensive annual series of exercises, many of which aim to enhance the defense of Eastern Europe and the Baltic states. For example, nine major exercises focused on the region in 2021. In the past few months NATO has held several significant exercises to fulfill its commitment to strengthening deterrence. These include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In March 2023, over 14,000 NATO troops from 11 allies participated in exercise Spring Storm, the largest exercise in Estonia. This included reinforcing the UK-led EFP battle group to brigade size through deploying 1,500 troops and 140 vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In May, Griffin Shock demonstrated the rapid expansion of the U.S.-led EFP battlegroup to brigade level in Poland, with over 3,000 troops from multiple nations, including the U.S. Army’s 2nd Cavalry Regiment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In June 2023, BALTOPS (Baltic Operations), a large annual exercise in the Baltic Sea, saw 50 ships, more than 45 aircraft, and 6,000 personnel from 20 allies conduct large-scale exercises in the Baltic Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also in June 2023, NATO held its largest ever air exercise, Air Defender, with 250 aircraft and 10,000 personnel from 25 allied countries taking part. The exercise was hosted and led by Germany, with training missions over the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and Southern Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also in June, the Lithuanian EFP battlegroup demonstrated its integration into the Lithuanian “Iron Wolf” brigade.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This robust series of multinational exercises demonstrates a strong willingness across the alliance to meet the Madrid commitment to collective defense exercises to reassure allies and deter Moscow. However, only two of the eight EFP missions have been scaled up to brigade size for exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One specific challenge for the Baltic countries when it comes to exercising is the limited room and training facilities to hold large-scale, multinational combined arms exercises on Baltic territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below summarizes the above assessment of the current status of NATO’s Madrid commitments to forward defense and deterrence. When NATO made these commitments, Secretary General Stoltenberg recognized that “the biggest overhaul [of] our collective defence since the end of the Cold War” will not happen straightaway — “We’ll take the decision now and then we’ll start implementation and then they will be available and ready next year.” Thus, the fact that implementation is incomplete is not evidence of failure. Nevertheless, given the immediacy of the threat, continuous progress is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Table 8: Status of Madrid Summit Decisions about Forward Defense and Deterrence.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: CSIS research and analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the “back to the future” strategy of forward defense NATO allies agreed on in Madrid is the right one for the alliance, given the unpredictability and danger of the current Russian regime. However, the reality of implementing the commitments NATO made to strengthening its defense and deterrence in Madrid appears to be lagging behind the rhetoric. While allied defense spending continues to rise and NATO has implemented a robust exercise program to reassure allies and deter Moscow, progress on scaling up the eight EFP missions, strengthening regional plans, and generating forces for the new NATO force model appear sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Closing NATO’s Deterrence Gap in the Baltics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All eyes will be on Lithuania next month when it hosts the next NATO leaders’ summit in Vilnius. One year on from its historic Madrid summit, NATO should use the summit to demonstrate progress on the commitments it made in Madrid to strengthening defense and deterrence. This situation affects the Baltic nations more than others because of their strategic vulnerability to attack from Russia and the challenges of reinforcing the region. Each Baltic state has its particular vulnerabilities. Lithuania is highly vulnerable because of its proximity to Russian forces based in Belarus and Kaliningrad, as well as the exposed Suwałki Gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final chapter builds on the assessment of the current status of NATO’s Madrid commitments above to recommend what NATO needs to do in Vilnius to meet its own commitments to strengthen defense and deterrence in the Baltic states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;an-ounce-of-prevention-&quot;&gt;An Ounce of Prevention …&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major lesson from the conflict in Ukraine is that it is far better to prevent a conflict than to fight one. A conflict in the Baltic region might be short, but it might also degenerate into a stalemate that lasts months or years, inflicting military and civilian casualties, crippling economies, destroying equipment, and laying waste to the surrounding territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aid to Ukraine provides a perspective. Prewar, the United States provided about $300 million per year, for a total of $1.9 billion between 2016 and 2021. For the first year of the war, the United States committed $77.1 billion of aid (including military, economic, and humanitarian) and the Europeans committed another $74.5 billion. Looking back, it would have been far preferable to have provided more aid up front and deterred the conflict than to help Ukraine fight the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;no-substitute-for-forward-deployments-and-forward-defense&quot;&gt;No Substitute for Forward Deployments and Forward Defense&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the new strategic concept agreed in Madrid sets out a “back to the future” strategy for NATO of a return to deterrence by denial through forward defense, it is worth briefly recapping the logic behind this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Defense defines deterrence as “the prevention of action by the existence of a credible threat of unacceptable counteraction and/or belief that the cost of action outweighs the perceived benefits.” In discussing deterrence, scholars make distinctions between deterrence by punishment (threatening retaliatory action), deterrence by reinforcement (taking action when a crisis comes), and deterrence by denial (physically preventing an adversary from achieving objectives). All these approaches can work in the right circumstances, but current circumstances in the Baltic region push NATO toward deterrence by denial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spectacular failure of “deterrence by detection” in preventing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should eliminate that concept from future consideration. Detection and publication of Russia’s intentions did not stop the invasion. The lesson is that early detection of adversary intentions is valuable in taking counteractions but is highly risky as the basis for national survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence by punishment in the case of a Russian invasion of the Baltic countries would require massive strikes, conventional or nuclear, against the Russian homeland. This is a “tripwire” strategy whereby a small force is put in harm’s way. This forces the aggressor to take military action and inflict casualties, which would presumably induce the defender to respond. The strategy received attention during the Cold War, when scholars suggested this as a way to offset weaknesses in conventional forces by leveraging nuclear capabilities. The tripwire would cause a nuclear response. It became U.S. strategy in the 1950s (“Massive Retaliation”). U.S. nuclear superiority during this period made the threat plausible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tripwire strategies are attractive because of their low cost but are risky and have a questionable track record. Scholars Paul Poast and Dan Reiter concluded from a study of forces: “Militarily inconsequential forces are surprisingly ineffective at deterring aggression. … Potential attackers will still strike if they believe they can achieve their territorial goals swiftly, winning a fait accompli before larger reinforcements can arrive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the concepts were viable when the United States had nuclear superiority in the 1950s or conventional superiority in the 1990s, they do not apply to the Baltic region today, where the United States lacks nuclear superiority or regional conventional superiority. Further, many NATO nations would be unwilling to risk nuclear war by striking the Russian homeland, even with conventional weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence by reinforcement is viable if there is time. However, as shown in the previous chapters, NATO may not have much time to react to a Russian invasion. Further, the readiness shortfalls of many allies undermine the credibility of a strategy based on reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement also implies the need for at least some counteroffensive efforts since reinforcing forces are unlikely to arrive in sufficient strength to completely repel an attack. Retaking lost territory through counterattacks is feasible and has been done throughout military history. The problem is that it is difficult and expensive. Defense has many advantages, including the ability to employ barriers, the ability to fight from entrenchments, and a simpler command and control environment. Counterattack to gain lost territory requires a massive buildup of forces to achieve the needed superiority. Military literature often cites a requirement for a 3:1 superiority in the attack. Although there is a lively debate about the precise ratio required and how to measure it, there’s no question that the attacker needs superiority to overcome the advantages of the defense. For example, the Iraqis overran Kuwait in 48 hours in 1990. To eject them, the coalition took five months to build up its forces, eventually totaling 540,000 service members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counterattack strategies also relinquish territory to Russian occupation, even if temporarily. As seen with the atrocities in Bucha, Ukraine, even short Russian occupations can inflict massive suffering on the civilian population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deterrence by denial has the advantage of physically preventing, or threatening to prevent, an adversary from succeeding. Typically, this is accomplished by having strong forces on the ground continuously, which presents tangible evidence of commitment and warfighting capability. It also reduces or avoids entirely the need for a costly counterattack and protects civilians from a harsh military occupation. Thus, many Baltic country officials use the phrase “repel, don’t expel” in advocating this strategic approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Deterrence by denial has the advantage of physically preventing, or threatening to prevent, an adversary from succeeding. It also reduces or avoids entirely the need for a costly counterattack and protects civilians from a harsh military occupation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, having forces already on the ground reduces the burden on senior officials by not requiring an early decision on deployment during a crisis. Decisionmakers can let a situation evolve and not worry about defensive measures being seen as provocative or mistaken for preparations to attack. This reduces the risk of escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;forward-deployed-in-the-baltics-enhancements-have-value&quot;&gt;Forward Deployed in the Baltics: Enhancements Have Value&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a strong argument that there is no substitute for troops on the ground. As General Sir Patrick Sanders, UK chief of the general staff, has summarized: “In Ukraine we’ve seen the limitations of deterrence by punishment. It has reinforced the importance of deterrence through denial — we must stop Russia seizing territory — rather than expecting to respond to a land grab with a delayed counteroffensive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet a total “deterrence by denial” approach may not be possible because of the large forces required. Defense of the Baltic countries will therefore need to be a combination of denial and reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the shortcomings of a “tripwire” strategy, the challenges to building a robust denial strategy might lead some commentators to conclude that any reinforcement is futile. Better to save resources than to implement a partial solution that will fail. There are three problems with this reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that the added units have warfighting value. Larger NATO deployments mean that even if Russia were eventually able to defeat NATO forces, success would take time and come at a high cost. That introduces uncertainty and risk into Russian military planning. The Russians will be conscious for many years about how the war in Ukraine devolved into an attritional stalemate and will hesitate to get into a similar situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second value is preventing a coup de main. Russia’s aim would certainly be the same as it intended in Ukraine: achieve victory quickly before the victims and NATO can react effectively. Strong forward-deployed forces would delay a Russian advance long enough for additional NATO troops to arrive. Further, the additional time that a determined defense provided would allow building a global coalition and a diplomatic pushback through sanctions. This is what the Ukrainians were able to do in the first month of the Russian invasion. Delays to the Russian advance caused by the initial Ukrainian defenses allowed Ukrainian forces to mobilize fully and deploy to the threatened areas. Further, the delay allowed NATO equipment to arrive, especially critical anti-air and anti-tank weapons. Time has value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final value is political. Even a successful Russian offensive would cause thousands of NATO casualties, thus involving many NATO countries in a way that a lightning strike would not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Berlin garrison during the Cold War illustrates these three functions. At that time, Berlin was divided, with the Western allies holding half the city and East Germany and the Soviet Union holding the other half. Berlin was deep inside territory of the Warsaw Pact and highly exposed. To protect West Berlin, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France each stationed a brigade and stockpiled supplies for a siege. It was long known that West Berlin would have had a difficult time holding out indefinitely against a Warsaw Pact attack. However, this was more than a tripwire force. It ensured that a coup de main was not possible. Capturing the city would take an all-out attack and an extended campaign. The Soviet Union was never willing to do that. Thus, West Berlin stayed secure during the entire Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;expectations-for-natos-vilnius-summit&quot;&gt;Expectations for NATO’s Vilnius Summit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next NATO leaders’ summit will take place on July 11 and 12, 2023, in Vilnius, Lithuania. The summit provides an important opportunity for NATO allies to take the next step in implementing the key commitments they made at the 2022 Madrid summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO leaders have two major tasks for the Vilnius summit. The first and main task is ensuring that the Madrid summit’s ambitious goals are implemented. The second task is to review whether the level of ambition set in Madrid is appropriate to deter Russia’s “maximum intentions and capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;implementing-the-madrid-commitments&quot;&gt;Implementing the Madrid Commitments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the stronger forward defenses endorsed at the Madrid summit, “NATO’s new posture will look to some like a slightly thicker tripwire.” Indeed, Eastern European NATO countries are reported to be nervous: “Some Eastern European allies fear that NATO forces deployed near Russia’s borders aren’t being expanded quickly enough or backed by adequate defense spending commitments from their allies further west.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources for defense:&lt;/strong&gt; As military lore holds, plans without resources are hallucinations. NATO leaders at Vilnius need to ensure that the member states allocate the resources needed to implement their plans. The 2022 Madrid summit reiterated the importance of defense investment. The 2 percent of GDP goal has been helpful, but most NATO members do not meet it. In this regard, three key questions must be addressed at Vilnius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Plans without resources are hallucinations. NATO leaders at Vilnius need to ensure that the member states allocate the resources needed to implement their plans.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is how to get nations to meet the target. Only 10 allies, including the three Baltic countries, currently meet the 2 percent target. Progress has been better on the target of spending 20 percent of allies’ defense budgets on major equipment spending, which 24 allies now meet, compared to only seven in 2014 when the target was set. Getting more countries to meet the spending targets can be done through a combination of incentives, such as using common funding to encourage spending or coordination with EU defense investment programs that provide tax and fiscal incentives to member states, and disincentives, such as naming and shaming allies who do not step up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second is what to spend collective resources on — and how to do so more efficiently to produce more “bang” for allies’ “buck” (or euro). Part of this equation is how to encourage more cooperation between European allies who are facing a “defense dilemma” — while spending has risen over the past decade, cooperation among them has declined. This leads to serious inefficiencies in European defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third is what the next target should be. NATO may need to push member states harder. The Defense Investment Pledge made by allies at the Wales summit in 2014 expires next year. Allies will need to start the conversation at Vilnius about what comes next. A consensus appears to have already been reached that the 2 percent of GDP target must become “a floor not a ceiling.” Many allies, including the Baltic states and Poland, have already committed to spending 3 percent of their GDP on defense, as have other allies, such as the United Kingdom, even if only briefly. However, 3 percent is unlikely to be accepted across the alliance, given the other demands on government spending combined with slow post-pandemic growth. A target of 2.5 percent seems like a logical next step but also seems somewhat arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building “robust in-place combat-ready forces”:&lt;/strong&gt; For the Baltic States, implementing the new policy of forward defense to deter Russian aggression is critical for national security and indeed national survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, implementing the commitment for “robust in-place combat-ready forces” requires decisions on several unresolved issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The nature of the forward-deployed brigades:&lt;/strong&gt; The term “brigade” needs definition. It could be a unit of anywhere from 2,000 to 5,000 personnel, depending on the structure and the amount of support attached. U.S. brigade combat teams, for example, number 4,000 to 5,000 personnel because they include supporting artillery, engineers, reconnaissance, and service support. If the Baltic brigades do not include these support troops, then where will they come from? Such support is needed to make the brigade fully combat capable. Further, the current language implies that the brigades will absorb the existing battle groups. The relationship between the two needs clarification. Will the brigades be as multinational as the battle groups, or will one nation predominate? The former spreads the burden, but the latter has more warfighting coherence.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The stationing of the brigades:&lt;/strong&gt; This study has made a strong argument for why brigades need to be deployed forward in peacetime. This could be through “heel-to-toe” rotation or permanent stationing. There are advantages and disadvantages to each that go beyond the scope of the study. However, the notion of establishing a small forward element that would be reinforced from the rear in a crisis is not viable given the likely short timelines involved. In the case of Lithuania, Germany seems particularly unable to meet these reinforcement timelines because of its past underinvestment in defense and lack of unit readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The nature and location of pre-positioned equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; As described earlier, pre-positioning can be a powerful tool for creating warfighting capabilities and would be preferred to moving whole units in a crisis. However, it requires extensive peacetime preparations — acquiring real estate, building warehouses, and stocking the warehouses with equipment. NATO has begun this process, but the size and complexity of such an undertaking requires detailed planning and long-term commitments. The relationship between pre-positioned equipment, the existing battle groups, and forward-deployed brigades also needs clarification. Ideally, the brigades will be fully staffed forward in peacetime, but that might not be possible. Prepositioning could fill the gaps, but which gaps?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The divisional command structure:&lt;/strong&gt; The Baltic states need a divisional structure between the brigades/battle groups and the NATO corps headquarters in Poland. For this reason, NATO created the two multinational divisions, northeast and north. Currently, the three Baltic countries are seeking to establish national divisions. A key question is whether these national divisions will conduct wartime operations or be limited to peacetime coordination and planning. If intended for wartime operations, then these new divisional structures face three challenges: experience (the Baltic states have no recent experience with this level of operations), command and control capabilities (which requires extensive communications equipment and network operations), and supporting units (of which divisions need many beyond the subordinate brigades).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Further, there is little clarity on how the several U.S. and NATO headquarters in Poland will interact with these national divisions in peacetime and wartime. The CSBA describes the situation as “wildly confused command structures/headquarters.” Therefore, first, there needs to be clear plans for providing the personnel, training, doctrine, and equipment for effective division command, and second, there needs to be clarification of command responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solving the Suwałki Gap problem:&lt;/strong&gt; While meeting the Madrid commitment to deploy brigades to the Baltic states should be the priority for Vilnius, serious thought should also be given to handling the wartime challenge of the Suwałki Gap. NATO needs unimpeded movement through the gap in wartime to sustain a credible defense of the Baltics. This might be accomplished by developing new force packages or by augmenting the EFP missions in Poland and Lithuania. One template is the defense network of guided rockets, artillery, mortars, and missiles (known as G-RAMM) advocated by a CSBA study that looked at the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New force model:&lt;/strong&gt; At the Vilnius summit, NATO will reveal the status of its new force model one year on from its conception. There are few signs that NATO will generate the massive, highly ready forces required to meet the one-year deadline set by the secretary general. The scale of forces required is an order of magnitude larger than any previous NATO commitment to high-readiness forces, at a time when the state of investment and readiness of European forces remains in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet despite the uncertainty that surrounds it, NATO’s new force model is an important development. As one analysis suggests: “Overall, the decision to set up a new NATO Force Model might be much more important for the future NATO deterrence and defence posture, but only next year will more details on it be known.” NATO’s force model is important because it is linked to the other Madrid defense and deterrence commitments. Without rapid reinforcement, the small size of the EFPs, even if upgraded to brigade size, will not be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that NATO leaders will be able to announce in Vilnius that they have met the force and readiness targets required by their new force model. Instead, they will need to demonstrate credible plans to gradually transition from the previous NATO Response Force (NRF) to the new force model. They should concentrate on the “Tier One” forces, for which the force model set a target of 100,000 forces in 10 days. The centerpiece of the Vilnius update might therefore be the announcement of a Tier One exercise in 2024 or 2025 where NATO would demonstrate the deployment of up to 100,000 troops, including land, air, and maritime force elements, to Eastern Europe within 10 days. Given that the NRF already planned for a force of 40,000 in 15 days, many of which were deployed in short order after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this could be achievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced exercise program:&lt;/strong&gt; As assessed above, NATO has a robust exercise schedule. The Baltic countries have participated extensively by hosting and leading multinational exercises at various levels of command and investing significantly in new facilities to house troop surges for exercise purposes. However, the full implementation of the Madrid commitments will heighten the demand, increasing the frequency and scale of NATO exercises. These include the operation of new division structures; coordination of battle groups, forward-deployed brigades, and reinforcing forces; and the employment of pre-positioned equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because NATO’s exercise planning extends many years into the future (five years for concepts, two years for detailed specifications), events that include these new capabilities should be planned now. Yet the current exercise program for the year ahead released by SHAPE looks threadbare, with only two maritime exercises planned, in Turkey and Portugal. This exercise program should build on the multiple exercises held in the Baltic and Eastern European region in March through June 2023. NATO’s exercise program in the region should be spread out across the year to avoid both bottlenecks and long gaps and to prolong the reassurance and deterrence effect of having multinational NATO forces surge into the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, NATO’s forward exercise program should include surging brigade-level forces into the remaining six EFP missions that have not yet demonstrated this (all except the U.S.-led mission in Poland and the UK-led mission in Estonia). Among these, Baltic region EFP missions should be prioritized — the Canadian-led mission in Latvia and the German-led mission in Lithuania — because of the more immediate threat to these areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timelines and status reports:&lt;/strong&gt; Making these changes takes time, so the fact that they are not yet in place does not imply failure or a lack of commitment. However, the policies need a timeline with assigned organizational responsibilities and designated milestones so that NATO can track progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All future NATO summits and defense minister meetings (which are held quarterly) should include a status report from the secretary general on these actions that shows progress to date, what remains to be accomplished, and whether plans are on track. In this way, NATO can discuss in a timely and open way whether changes or interventions are needed. Doing so will contribute to both reassuring allies and deterring the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;dealing-with-russias-maximum-intentions&quot;&gt;Dealing with Russia’s “Maximum Intentions”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second task for NATO leaders at Vilnius is assessing whether the new commitments are adequate. Plans will need continuous evaluation in light of the evolving threat from an unpredictable Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allies need to answer the question: Will NATO’s new level of commitment deter a more aggressive and unpredictable Russia — even if it has less capable land forces in the short term? It may be that the Russians can reconstitute more quickly or more robustly than currently envisioned or, conversely, that this reconstitution takes longer or is less immediate, thus allowing some adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Allies need to answer the question: Will NATO’s new level of commitment deter a more aggressive and unpredictable Russia — even if it has less capable land forces in the short term?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By agreeing to “new guidance for NATO’s defence planning” at February’s meeting of defense ministers, NATO leaders and military planners have now enshrined the Madrid level of ambition in the first step of the alliance’s four-year-long defense planning process. They need to be sure their guidance — and the force posture and capability targets that result — is sufficient to deal with the Kremlin’s maximum intentions. To answer this question, every NATO summit should include an assessment — made behind closed doors but explained to the public — of whether the Madrid commitments are still appropriate and, if not, what changes are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Madrid summit was a historic event for NATO, adapting the alliance to the new European security environment. However, it is a work in progress, unfinished until its ambitious commitments are fully implemented. The Vilnius summit can take an important step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent months, tensions between General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan’s Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – a militia-turned-paramilitary group led by Mohamed Hamdan “Hemmeti” Dagalo – finally spilled over into open warfare. Greater in scale and intensity than many predicted, analogies have already been drawn to the “chaotic free-for-all” in Libya or the systemic collapse of Somalia. At once a regional crisis and humanitarian tragedy, the violence reflects – as Alex de Waal argues – a “revolution no one wanted”: the convulsions of a rapacious, kleptocratic logic coming full circle. At the same time, it exposes chronic failures among international donors, from poor assumptions to inadequate capacity and a lack of strategic vision. As efforts continue to find a ceasefire that sticks, it is therefore essential to understand the genesis of the conflict and why the diplomatic community got it so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;collective-failures&quot;&gt;Collective Failures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The immediate trigger stems from negotiations over a civilian transition after more than two years of coup governance. Having subscribed to the UN-backed Framework Agreement in December 2022, the RSF, military and Forces of Freedom and Change Central Council (FFC-CC) – an umbrella for around 40 civil society groups – launched “Phase II” a month later, focusing on regime accountability and security sector reform (SSR). From the outset, analysts raised concerns over a truncated process primarily designed for foreign consumption. Keen to stave off complete economic collapse, donors, international organisations and Sudanese politicians pushed a suite of proposals lacking popular buy-in or support from neighbourhood resistance-committees. Crucially, they also neglected internal politics within SAF itself, opting to recognise the RSF as a “regular entity affiliated with the armed forces but under the direct command of a civilian head of state, rather than the army chief”. Benefitting Hemmeti – who could conceivably retain an independent powerbase – the arrangement was criticised by Sudan’s top brass as a vehicle for extending paramilitary influence, likely at the expense of the country’s regular forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final straw may have involved pathways and timeframes for integration – Hemmeti demanded 10 years to Al-Burhan’s two, and the dismissal of 800 SAF officers – but both parties were already conducting large-scale recruitment drives across Darfur. Reports of army officials dispensing cash to Rizeigat and Al-Ta’aisha – core RSF constituencies – were accompanied by leaks from Military Intelligence accusing the group of importing armed drones via Turkey. Rumours spread of provincial bosses and Border Guard militia receiving salaries, promotions and the promise of plum jobs abroad. Hemmeti in turn cast Al-Burhan as a “radical Islamist”, re-emphasising claims that the October coup was a “mistake” and “gateway for the return of the former regime [fronted by the National Congress Party, NCP]”. With Al-Burhan already “backtracking on previous statements” over the terms of transition, these narratives chimed with many in the FFC-CC who saw SAF as a redoubt for NCP loyalism. In response, military spokesmen and media outlets maintained they could not “make an agreement…[with] two armies in the country”. As tensions ratcheted up, talks broke down: neither outfit attended the final workshop on SSR and – beneath a professed commitment to peaceful mediation – both reinforced their positions across the capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who fired first is unclear but on 13 April, RSF troops surrounded an airbase housing Egyptian MiG-29M/M2 Fulcrum fighter-jets in the northern town of Merowe. Two days later, clashes broke out across major cities, with “tanks driving through the streets of central Khartoum” and heavy gunfire reported outside the state broadcaster, Republican Palace, Ministry of Defence, and international airport. Susceptible to aerial strafing and rocket fire, militiamen occupied hospitals and residential neighbourhoods, converting apartments into make-shift strongholds and taking the families of army personnel hostage. In response, Special Forces raided large RSF camp-complexes in Soba and Tiba as infantry and Central Reserve Police (CRP) attempted to reclaim bridges, highways and strategic districts such as Al-Bagair industrial zone. Even when combined with air-support, these efforts nonetheless found little traction. By early June, the RSF held much of Bahri, downtown Khartoum, and pockets of Omdurman. Having overrun multiple SAF bases, including the sprawling Yarmouk weapons factory, the group was able to encircle further hold-outs – the Shajara Armoured Corps and Corps of Engineers – until they were eventually forced back by a short-lived counteroffensive. Although the frontlines remain fluid, the army is now “heavily outnumbered” across the capital, with Sudan War Monitor reporting the loss of CRP’s local headquarters alongside “dozens of Shareef-2 armoured vehicles, huge amounts of ammunition, and more than 100 pickup trucks”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further afield, fighting may be primarily concentrated in Darfur, but incidents continue across White Nile, Blue Nile, and North Kordofan, together with rising tensions in Gedaref and eastern border-towns. Over 3,000 civilians have been killed, with others running low on basic necessities while stuck in “40-degree Celsius heat without electricity or […] water”. Many describe shortages of food and medical supplies as looters and shelling push neglected infrastructure to the point of collapse: at least a third of Sudan’s health facilities are no longer functioning. Resistance committees appear to be “repurpos[ing] themselves as emergency networks for community information [and] protection”, but as the only source of “civic governance” available they are over-stretched, under-resourced and dangerously exposed. Humanitarian offices have likewise been plundered and markets burned, cutting off displaced populations in Darfur as up to 90,000 people – mostly women and children – flee across the border. UN Refugee Agency officials anticipate a further 270,000 refugees may try to reach Chad and South Sudan. In the north, more than 110,000 have already arrived in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successive ceasefires have yielded little, with a 72-hour truce negotiated by the US and Saudi Arabia on 24 April only offering a brief window to evacuate foreign nationals and doing little to alleviate the suffering of Sudanese themselves. Over nine subsequent deals have since folded, including a 10-day agreement brokered at Jeddah which suffered repeated violations and collapsed in the lead up to a new SAF offensive in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Western diplomats recall being “blind-sided” by the violence, admissions congruent with helicopters taking off from the US embassy and confused instructions relayed by the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Ten days prior to the conflict, officials were allegedly expressing “cautious optimism” about the transition process. Even Volker Perthes, UN special representative to Sudan, claimed “we did not have any early warning”, despite attending iftar at the home of Lieutenant-General Shams Al-Kabashi, the army’s deputy commander, hours before gunfire broke out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The violence exposes chronic failures among international donors, from poor assumptions to inadequate capacity and a lack of strategic vision&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, however, such narratives overlook well-known realities of the country’s history and political economy: conditions reproducing and institutionalising violence, and fixing the likes of Hemmeti and Al-Burhan – two kingpins of “kleptocratic cartels” – in a long-running rivalry. The signs were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-faces-old-problems&quot;&gt;New Faces, Old Problems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these dynamics trace back to the colonial anatomy of the Sudanese state. As Joshua Craze summarises: “postcolonial strife followed the lineaments of colonial rule, with a riparian elite in Khartoum and its satellite cities, dominated by a few families, fighting against the multi-ethnic peripheries of the country, which they exploited for labour and resources”. The same recipe has been recycled by every government since independence, turning “rural surpluses into foreign exchange that pays for the basic food and energy needs of urban consumers” across Sudan’s metropolitan core, the so-called Hamdi Triangle. Reliant on local strongmen to maintain control, these processes militarised countryside production and “pastoral livelihoods”, reducing outlying regions like Darfur to “conflict gig econom[ies], with armed units up for hire on a case-by-case basis”. Although pre-dating his regime, former President Omar Al-Bashir expanded this model to cover the import of wheat, petroleum and luxury goods, outsourcing state functions and deputising militias as a “key technique for rural governance and resource extraction”. Dubbed “counter-insurgency on the cheap”, his policies licensed a raft of surrogates including the Janjaweed – a mix of Abbala herdsmen, Chadian exiles, and the sundry remnants of Muammar Qadhafi’s Islamic Legion – to attack civilians and rebels alike, sequencing cluster bombings by the Sudanese Air Force with mass killings and ethnic cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the approach proved destabilising over time. Militia recruitment grew tenfold between 2003 and 2013, saturating the market with new start-ups. As land, loot and largesse ran dry, local commanders increasingly turned on both the government and one another, a problem exacerbated by the discovery of gold seams in Darfur. Musa Hilal, head of the Border Intelligence Brigade, for instance, was able to carve out a personal fiefdom across Jebel Amer, converting a 400-strong network of mines into a “gigantic ATM” worth around $54 million per year. Low on cash after losing South Sudan’s oilfields and needing to regain some grip over the rural economy, Bashir overruled his army chief of staff in 2013, regularising Fut-8 Battalion – a Mahariya outfit led by Hilal’s rival Hemmeti – as a “super-paramilitary” under the authority of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), and later himself. Repackaged and expanded as the “Rapid Support Forces”, the group seized checkpoints and contraband routes across the interior, enforcing a series of disarmament campaigns to arrest Hilal and capture much of the country’s gold trade. At the same time, the 2017 budget insulated RSF funding from SAF, preserving a discrete chain of command and positioning Hemmeti as a counterweight to the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short of liquidity, Bashir’s “transactional machine” became steadily dependent on this security-centric oligopoly, with the RSF and army exploiting new sources of (post-oil) political finance: minerals, crops, land and mercenaries. While outwardly “collusive”, competition between the two – baked into the system from the start – became increasingly tense. Much of SAF’s rank and file grumbled over disparities in pay and equipment. Their commanders – the product of ethnic stacking from Sudan’s northern clans – not only saw Hemmeti’s men as a “bunch of jumped-up yahoos from the sticks” but a direct threat to riverain rule. With control over “import companies, flour mills, and transportation hubs”, high-value commodity chains, and “vertically integrated monopolies”, the RSF’s commercial networks gradually resembled an “enclave economy”. In Darfur, RSF goods stocked shelves as militiamen assumed “social provision and insurance functions”, supervising harvests and organising healthcare. Through Al Gunade, the family conglomerate, Hemmeti’s relatives also ran a complex web of businesses stretching from construction to tourism and car rentals. Despite trying to dilute the RSF’s Darfuri Arab complexion and embed over 500 army officers across its leadership, there was little Khartoum’s elite could do to stop the Dagalos from building up their own “state within a state”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, any collaboration between these securocrats remained circumstantial. Temporary alignment against the president in 2019 was driven by a shared desire to preserve the pathology, structure and cronyism of the regime – “Bashirism without Bashir” – from the upheaval of popular revolution. Expedited by personal ties between Al-Burhan and Hemmeti after deployments in Yemen, the RSF and SAF likewise undermined civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, boxing out his Anti-Corruption Committee and inventing bureaucratic vehicles – the Council of Transitional Partners and the Joint Defence and Security Council – to diminish his clout. The coup in October 2021 was much the same story, with “Potemkin protests” offering a pretext for Sudanese security services to seize power and protect their financial empires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tensions were never far from the surface, however. Both continually competed for leverage, cannibalising Bashir’s corporate assets alongside those of rump agencies such as the NISS (re-labelled the General Intelligence Service). Sporadic shootouts between RSF and local army units raised concerns of possible escalation, and in May 2020, Hemmeti blamed unknown forces for attempting to “draw the RSF into a civil war through a collusion with the military”. Five months later, his involvement in the Juba Peace Agreement – a payroll peace with rebel groups across Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile – exacerbated fears of a rural coalition taking over in Khartoum. Having flatly rejected any plan to turn his militia into a subsidiary of SAF, Hemmeti poached army officers with promotions and higher wages. Crucially, he also attempted to drum up support at home and abroad: “doling out” resources to farmers; launching a “charm offensive” in the Sahel; and leading a bilateral delegation to Russia. In turn, Al-Burhan lumbered his deputy with the Higher Committee for Economic Emergencies – a thankless task given Sudan’s rampant inflation – and leant on Bashir’s old Islamist circles to offset the lack of any “real social base” or private cash-flow. Subscribing to a socially conservative (and ethnicised) brand of authoritarian politics, these NCP functionaries not only sought to limit civilian oversight but block the RSF from becoming an “alternative power centre”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a coup unable to “serve two masters” in the absence of a higher-level broker (Bashir) or shared threat (Hamdok), the generals were trading insults, packing ministries and currying foreign favour months after seizing power. Parallel tracks of shuttle diplomacy saw separate delegations visiting the same capitals days apart, and the RSF mimicking SAF’s humanitarian efforts following February’s earthquake in Turkey. While economic malaise eventually compelled Al-Burhan and Hemmeti to approve the Framework Agreement in the hope of accessing international development funds, “rival camps of soldiers” were already starting to amass across Khartoum. As negotiations over Phase II deteriorated, personal relations between the Sudanese strongmen broke down completely, with Hemmeti “stand[ing] outside, literally banging on the door” to gain admission to the presidential palace, and the air force quietly scoping out potential targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The systems of kleptocracy, elitism and exploitation long defining Sudan’s political economy have become self-defeating&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, the conflict’s intensity – when it finally erupted – was almost inevitable. Hemmeti has staked his “first and only shot at rule” on the outcome, turning the fight into one of survival, a zero-sum logic reflected in the promise his former boss would either be brought to justice or “die like a dog”, and corroborated by gunmen storming Al-Burhan’s residence “deep within army headquarters” during the first hours of fighting. Several prominent Islamists have since been arrested such as Bashir’s former Vice-President Al-Haj Adam Youssef and NCP leader Anas Omar, alongside numerous military personnel including the Inspector-General of the Army. With SAF in turn branding the RSF a “rebellious group”, freezing its bank accounts, and firing Hemmeti as vice-chair of the Sovereign Council, there is little room left for de-escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sadly-predictable&quot;&gt;“Sadly Predictable”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this context, why were so many of the warning signs missed? Part of the issue stems from a chronic lack of resourcing and capacity among international donors. For all the US’s political heft, for instance, reports describe a “deeply flawed…policy process”, involving an over-stretched embassy “out of its depth” and bereft of funding, manpower and institutional memory. Washington had no ambassadorial presence for three years after Bashir’s fall, with deliberations confined to a handful of officials displaying little understanding of, or access to, the Sudanese “street”. The UK, meanwhile, faced successive aid cuts (a 97.5% reduction in 2022–23 alone) and ministerial turnover, sapping its ability to forward-plan and coordinate with multilateral partners. Despite repeated calls from specialists, the embassy also lacked “expertise, resourcing and training” around mass atrocity prevention, with no alarm system, risk assessment process or central guidance “on how to prepare for increasingly likely scenarios that could lead to violence”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor was there necessarily a coherent strategic vision, with foreign diplomats criticised for recycling tropes about “elections, rule of law, and financial reform” without explaining how these aspirations could actually be delivered. Technical fixes became a presumed precondition for democratic change, imposing a linearity that rarely accounted for the messy realities of local agency, patrimonial pathologies, or state capture of the political economy. Legitimacy and popularity were likewise difficult to reconcile with pre-packaged neo-liberal prescriptions, leading to discrepancies between external expectations and public demand. Although officials expressed concern from the beginning, effecting genuine change across the donor system – even on the back of evidence-based research – was compared to redirecting a “supertanker”: lumbering and unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, a concurrent and somewhat contradictory preoccupation with “stability” continued to shape international policymaking. Analysts reveal how conservative sensibilities not only tempered donor appetite for collaboration with resistance committees but re-cast Sudan’s security services as necessary partners in transition. As one stakeholder recalled to the New York Times: “American diplomats ‘made the mistake of coddling the generals, accepting their irrational demands and treating them as natural political actors […] this fed their lust for power and illusions of legitimacy.’” Flaws in such logic were repeatedly exposed, notably after Al-Burhan assured Jeffrey Feltman (US Special Envoy to the Horn) of his commitment to democratisation hours before launching the October coup. Similarly, at least one memo from the State Department’s Bureau of African Affairs mapped the possibility of conflict between the RSF and SAF in early 2022, though the draft was apparently “heavily edited, watered down” and shelved. Instead, analogous assumptions shaped negotiations over the Framework Agreement, with (nominal) buy-in from Hemmeti and the army prioritised above the empowerment of civilian leaders. With pro-democracy activists gradually cut out of the process, Western proponents were left pushing a political agreement that was not only “never going to hold” but had itself become a “pressure cooker” – the deleterious product of “diplomats [in Sudan] and headquarters think[ing] one dimensionally”. As Feltman concluded: “we reflexively appeased and accommodated the two warlords. We considered ourselves pragmatic. Hindsight suggests wishful thinking to be a more accurate description”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;full-circle&quot;&gt;Full Circle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the crisis is far more than a turf war between rival generals. Referring to the perennial prioritisation of Greater Khartoum by those in power back in 2015, de Waal wrote: “throughout the twists and turns of political financing, repression and liberalisation, austerity and boom, there has been sufficient cohesion and agreement on political rules…[so] that government – in the broadest sense – has survived”. Eight years on, these conventions have all but collapsed. Violence previously exported to far-flung peripheries now engulfs the capital, upending – as Craze puts it – the “geographically inflected class relations associated with Bashir”. As a result, the systems of kleptocracy, elitism and exploitation long defining Sudan’s political economy have become self-defeating, encapsulated by rural militia – the so-called “creatures of the deposed” – (literally) besieging their former master in the streets of Omdurman. Having failed to anticipate this “revolution”, the international community cannot afford to make the same mistakes again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of Ukraine–NATO relations is once again the number-one topic on the agenda for Alliance members in the lead-up to the forthcoming Vilnius Summit. The issue was just as acute 15 years ago when, at the Bucharest Summit, prospects of a Ukrainian Membership Action Plan (MAP) were discussed. The 2008 decision not to grant Ukraine a MAP is now regarded by many as a prologue to the events of 2014 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that decisions related to Ukraine–NATO relations at the Vilnius Summit and beyond will have a decisive impact on Euro-Atlantic security for decades to come. The task is daunting: how to break the cycle of Russian aggression, as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg rightly framed it after an informal meeting in Oslo dedicated mostly to Ukraine–NATO relations. Proper relations between Kyiv and the Alliance are a crucial part of the solution to the problem of Russian revisionism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changed-perceptions&quot;&gt;Changed Perceptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragedy of 24 February 2022 has become a verdict for one of the core elements of European security architecture established after the Cold War – namely, that Ukraine was confined to a “grey zone”, sandwiched between an enlarged but increasingly risk-averse NATO and a resurgent Russia. This made Kyiv vulnerable to Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major documents such as the Charter on a Distinctive Partnership Between NATO and Ukraine (July 1997) or revamped US-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership (November 2021) proceeded from the assumption that the security of Ukraine is an indispensable element of a secure Europe. Alas, those statements have been more declaratory rather than a guide to specific actions. After 24 February 2022, it has become starkly evident that without guarantees of Ukraine’s long-term security there cannot be a secure and peaceful Europe. There is now a consensus among NATO members that Ukrainian security needs to be strengthened by concrete actions. Such consensus, among other things, has been fostered by the UK, in both the private and public sphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to changed perceptions at the political level, the events after 24 February 2022 disproved some military arguments that were used to make a case against Ukraine’s immediate accession to NATO. First and foremost, Ukraine made clear that if it is provided with enough weaponry, it can implement air and sea denial strategies and conduct effective defensive and offensive operations on land. In other words, there is no need to immediately place substantial NATO forces on Ukrainian territory to ensure the credibility of Article 5, despite claims made before the full-scale invasion. In the future, Ukraine – as a NATO member – could hypothetically implement a deterrence-by-denial strategy to win enough time for a NATO interservice grouping of forces to come and reclaim temporarily lost territories. There is therefore no need to station a permanent major NATO grouping of forces in Ukraine from Day 1 of the country’s membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;President Biden has made clear that, in his opinion, Ukraine has to move through the same stages of accession as other countries have done and meet all the criteria&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the credibility of Russia’s threats of conventional escalation made before 24 February 2022 – aimed at dissuading NATO from bringing Ukraine on board – decreased given its level of losses and sheer incompetence on the battlefield. Russian threats of unconventional escalation made after 24 February 2022 do not find support even among Russia-leaning countries such as India and China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-us-position&quot;&gt;The US Position&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Joe Biden administration is increasingly ready to call Russia’s bluff on its threats to use unconventional forces in response to Alliance members’ shipments of sophisticated weaponry to Ukraine, it is still guided by considerations of escalation management. President Biden was plain with his subordinates that his major goal is not to see a Third World War – in this context, Ukraine’s inclusion in NATO under current conditions increases the chances of such a development from the Biden administration’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the White House prefers the so-called Israeli model – that is, the porcupine strategy – for Ukraine. In practice, some framework political agreements are planned to be signed. These agreements will codify instruments of aid used by NATO countries to strengthen Ukrainian defensive capabilities since the 2022 invasion – hardware and ammunition, intelligence data, training, planning and wargaming instruments. Although it might be treated as a step forward, in essence these agreements are just a continuation of a cautious approach when most of the risks related to direct confrontation with Russia are passed to Ukraine, decreasing to an acceptable level the chances of a direct clash between the US/NATO and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, Biden made clear that, in his opinion, Ukraine has to move through the same stages of accession as other countries have done and meet all the criteria. In other words, the idea to dispense with MAP in the case of Ukraine has not found traction with the US president despite being hotly debated behind closed doors and given Finland’s recent precedent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-ukrainian-perspective&quot;&gt;The Ukrainian Perspective&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian officials accept the fact that while high-intensity warfare is ongoing, NATO members will not be ready to admit Ukraine into the Alliance. That is why Ukrainian ambitions for the upcoming Vilnius Summit are reduced to a clear agreed timetable for when the country will be accepted into the Alliance. Understanding the high stakes of the next Alliance summit, Volodymyr Zelenskyy raised the option of not attending if NATO decisions do not meet Ukrainian expectations – at least partially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, both Ukrainian officials and experts have tried to provide an interpretation of Article 5 that, in their opinion, will make NATO more ready to admit Ukraine as a full-fledged member. Namely, that mutual defence does not imply the need to fight for Ukraine – aid within Article 5 might be confined to hardware and ammunition, intelligence data, training, planning and wargaming instruments. In other words, there are no new additional risks for NATO members – just a continuation of mechanisms already applied since Russia’s full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Before 2022, it was said that the price of Ukrainian membership of NATO would outweigh any benefits. The events that followed proved that the price of inaction tends to be higher than the price of action&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three major issues with such an attempt. First, although Article 5 allows quite broad interpretation of collective defence, it was always assumed that it is about readiness to fight a high-intensity war. Second, attempts to dilute the essence of Article 5 will not be welcomed by Central and Eastern European countries which rely on it now. Last but not least, broadening the interpretation of Article 5 means that, for Ukraine, it will be more difficult to resist framework agreements suggested by NATO countries given that that they provide similar guarantees – albeit the credibility of such support is higher within Article 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the idea of framework agreements is treated with justified scepticism in Ukraine in three important respects. First, this is quite natural given the 1994 Budapest Memorandum has not provided the protection that Kyiv expected. Second, framework agreements do not shield Ukraine from domestic changes that may occur in the states that have signed them –changes which might affect readiness to implement general pledges. And finally, the idea of framework agreements is treated as a kind of trick – if Ukraine accepts it then appeals for full-fledged membership will lose urgency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-way-forward&quot;&gt;The Way Forward&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of Ukraine’s rapid accession to NATO is likely to be most difficult for all sides to navigate. Kyiv will continue to face the challenge of how to change the US’s perceptions and calculations. From the Biden administration’s standpoint, the current situation is acceptable – Ukraine has decimated Russian forces, undermining Moscow’s great power status without substantially increasing the risk of a direct clash between nuclear powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Ukrainian perspective, such an approach is not only morally wrong but unsustainable in the medium to long term. Ukraine wants to see both the risks and the price of Russian revisionism shouldered more evenly. For Kyiv, it will be very difficult to engage private entities in reconstruction efforts without a proper level of hard security. The same is true for the approximately 8 million Ukrainians who moved abroad after the Russian full-scale invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, the case of Ukrainian membership of NATO continues to be an example of where the price and risks of action are more evident, discussed and affect decision-making, while the price and risks of inaction tend to be more ambiguous, unspoken and do not affect policymaking in the way that might be warranted. Before the 2022 invasion, it was said that the price of Ukrainian membership of NATO would outweigh any benefits. The events that followed proved that the price of inaction tends to be higher than the price of action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the success of a bold strategic decision to bring Ukraine into the Alliance as soon as the intensity of fighting ebbs will be assessed on the basis of sustainability and against the risks and costs of inaction. A viable Ukraine in NATO will be the best proof of the strategic defeat of Russia, whose leader wanted to destroy Ukraine and prevent the country’s accession to NATO – and therefore the Alliance’s enlargement. Russia, which is deprived of space to project its imperial delusions, would finally have no other option than to start a post-imperial transition. Without this step, the current chapter of Ukraine–Russia confrontation might not be the last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡追問即沒有讀《國安法》條文？何答「我自己就冇詳細睇」，追問下確認沒有讀過。陳仲衡即嚴厲說：「不要嘗試令答案變得模棱兩可！（“Don’t try to be ambiguous in your answer!”）」法官李運騰亦表示，明白廣東話的說話方式有時是含糊，但法庭基於何的口供作出裁決，故很重要的是他說話時要越準確越好，又指何作為一個受過教育的人，應理解有讀過和只是瞥一眼的分別。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明續補充，他無正式看《國安法》官方文件，但看的評論內有《國安法》內容。李運騰問，何當時是否意識到《國安法》的刑事範圍很闊（casts criminal net very wide），問他有否做任何事確保他當時是符合《國安法》？何表示「我盡可能小心我嘅用字」。李續問，那他受訪前有否做任何事收回他的言論？陳仲衡舉例即「打倒共產黨」。何先重申他說「打倒共產黨」並無意「打倒」，而他無收回言論或澄清，「因為我嘅理解係7月1號（《國安法》生效）之前係唔會追究」，但他有嘗試去說一些話作「更新」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑何以民主為先-何啟明無民主就無民生不代表民主先於民生&quot;&gt;控方質疑何以民主為先 何啟明：「無民主就無民生」不代表民主先於民生&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪續讀出訪問內容，被問《國安法》後市民的反應變化，何回應「呢次香港人最大嘅反應是，其實佢哋覺得香港變咗大陸」，又指大家知道「大陸就係一個黑暗、恐怖，甚至封閉嘅地方」，新聞看到很多「冤枉錯判、屈得就屈」的事，「佢哋明白內地就係一個人治嘅社會，一個極權嘅國度。」何確認是他的理解。何續於訪問稱：「而家立埋《國安法》，香港變大陸，其實呢種情緒就係令大家點解走出嚟反抗，甚至係越來越認同要對付呢個極權呢，反抗係唯一嘅出路。」控方指何仍認為反抗是唯一出路，他根本沒有改變，何否認，指他在有在訪問解釋何謂「反抗」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何於訪問續被問及民協相比其他泛民和本土派，定位是怎樣，何表示望藉此機會「大家能夠重新認識民協」，指以往很多人認為民協「淨係做民生」，「但係其實我哋越嚟越見到就係，無民主就無民生。」萬德豪指這就是何昨日所說，民主比民生優先。惟何不同意：「我話冇民主就冇民生，唔代表民主個 priority 就高過民生」，又指他在訪問有解釋民生受政治制度影響，故「要個制度變得民主，政府先至會聆聽民意、回應民生」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱抗爭目標非推翻政權-而是令香港變更公平公義社會&quot;&gt;何稱抗爭目標非推翻政權 而是令香港變更公平公義社會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引何於訪問稱，「極權」不會理會市民生死、不會處理民生問題，「所以點解我哋要出嚟爭取民主自由，因為其實好多香港人走出嚟抗爭，都係希望香港變成一個更公平、更公義嘅社會，都係香港變成一個更適合人居住的地方⋯大家走出嚟抗爭，因為大家真係好撚鍾意香港啊嘛，所以其實我哋都係因為咁而走出嚟反抗極權。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬指，故最重要的仍是「抗爭」？何指他是說抗爭的目標，就是希望香港成為更公平、更公義的社會，變成更適合人住的地方「而不是推翻政府」。陳仲衡問，但要達到那樣的「烏托邦社會」，就要先取得民主？何同意，並指：「但攞到民主都唔代表要推翻政府，我哋希望嗰個制度係更加能夠回應到人民嘅聲音」，強調他提「反抗極權」並非要「推翻政權」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問否決財案致立會解散是否推翻政府-何啟明指武裝革命方為推翻門檻&quot;&gt;官問否決財案致立會解散是否推翻政府 何啟明指武裝革命方為推翻門檻&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指，但何昨提到「極權」是指香港政府，何同意，指「因為當政府唔聽人民聲音嘅時候，佢就會變成極權」。李問，故何在2020年時已認為港府是極權？何同意，重申因香港政府無聆聽市民聲音，故「極權政府」是對其批評。李運騰續問何說的「反抗」是指什麼，何指訪問中也提到可融入日常生活，「例如支持黃店、例如喺自己嘅工作崗位度堅守價值，但我冇講過話要肢體衝突，更加冇提過話要推翻政府。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問，何認為什麼會推翻政府？何指「嗰陣時我真係聽過有人話要武裝革命」，故他認為「武裝革命就係推翻政府」。陳仲衡問，所以何認為兩次否決預算案導致立法會解散，並不是推翻政府的行為？此時何桂藍和余慧明發笑。何啟明回應：「如果按我頭先武裝革命嘅定義，咁嗰樣嘢都未算係。」陳仲衡再追問，迫特首下台也不代表推翻政府？何再說：「唔好意思啊法官閣下，因為我真係唔認同呢樣嘢，你問緊我唔認同嘅嘢⋯⋯」陳最後問，武裝革命是推翻政府的例子或門檻，何說：「誒我會話係門檻。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;訪問提重新認識民協-官問是否表現得比實際上黃-何我哋係做返自己&quot;&gt;訪問提「重新認識民協」 官問是否表現得比實際上黃 何：我哋係做返自己&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，何提及「重新認識民協」，其黨立場是否由溫和變激進。何否認，指「以往啲人淨係覺得我哋做民生、甚至覺得我哋唔係民主派，所以我重新認識嘅意思就係民協既關注民生亦關注民主」。陳慶偉指不認為有人覺得民協是建制派，何續解釋，「民協畀人鬧咗三十年，真係有人話過我哋係建制派」。萬質疑何昨日說被罵「騎牆派」，今日又說是「建制派」，何回應兩者無衝突，指民協被罵「騎牆」甚至「鬼」，「佢哋就界定我哋唔係民主派就係建制派喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，那2020年時，何啟明是在嘗試令公眾清楚知道他們不是建制派嗎？何同意，指「我哋每一次嘅公開言論都係希望話畀公眾聽我哋係民主派」。李運騰問，那何當時是想表現得比他實際上黃嗎（“portray an image that you were in fact yellower than you actually were”）？抑或只是做自己？並叫何想清楚再回答。何表示：「我哋係做返自己，所以我哋好清楚解釋我哋重視民主同民生嘅路線。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;法官提醒控方法庭不是決定政治議題對錯-僅關注被告意圖&quot;&gt;法官提醒控方法庭不是決定政治議題對錯 僅關注被告意圖&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續打斷說：「Thank you，這是一個法庭，我們對政治沒興趣，move on。」萬德豪續指民協過去立場是「又傾又砌」，但何捨棄了其立場，惟陳慶偉再打斷，着控方留待陳詞。陳慶偉續表示：「記住我們是來決定法律的問題，不是來決定政治議題和對錯，我當然明白案件涉及政治元素，但不代表要深入政治。」李運騰續指，法庭關注的是被告案發時的意圖，以及該意圖是否落入控罪範圍。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再提高聲線：「我當然沒有深入政治！」在被告席的何桂藍笑出聲並掩口。陳續說，他並沒有反駁（refute）被告說的每句話，舉例當何啟明說政府不聽人民聲音就是極權，「那不可能是對的，對嗎？」，並以美國槍械管制為例，指民主黨傾向收緊，共和黨則反對，「但你可以說美國是極權嗎？當然不！永遠都有不同的看法。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳又舉例英國脫歐，最後只是以很小的差距通過，「你會說英國是極權嗎？當然不！但我也沒有反駁他說的每句話。」陳又再指，「我也對新疆沒興趣，全視乎你問誰和看什麼。」李運騰再重申，他們只是關注被告案發的意圖及該意圖是否落入控罪範圍，並不會考慮政見。萬德豪續指會嘗試問相關的問題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明認視香港政府為敵人稱不會與共產黨打交道但會與港府傾&quot;&gt;何啟明認視香港政府為敵人、稱不會與共產黨打交道但會與港府「傾」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續引何啟明於訪問稱：「其實根本就唔需要同共產黨打交道，咪就係繼續反抗，繼續嚟到抗擊呢個極權」，問是否即從來不打算商討。何否認，指他只是不與共產黨打交道，但當選後會與特區政府「傾」，因為「港人治港」，又指他昨日亦稱「共產黨係唔會有渠道同我哋傾嘅，個對口單位係特區政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引何啟明7月11日的帖文，提及前一日「港共政權漏夜走去搞香港民意研究中心，就係想嚇怕我哋，但係我哋唔驚，所謂敵人反對的我哋就要堅決擁護，用盡一切方法想打壓我哋嘅初選，我哋就要用盡一切方法話畀全世界知香港人係唔會投降」。萬德豪問何是否當香港政府是敵人，何表示「個敵人咪就係用盡一切方法想打壓初選嘅人」，追問下表示：「你可以咁理解。」李運騰追問，不僅是理解，而是何啟明撰文時也意指香港政府是敵人？何答「係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱共產黨和特區政府是兩樣嘢但兩者做事方式相似&quot;&gt;何稱共產黨和特區政府是「兩樣嘢」、但兩者做事方式相似&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，何啟明提及「港共政權」，即認為港府是共產黨的代理人（agent）；但他一邊說願與香港政府「傾」，另一邊又說不會與共產黨打交道？何指據他對《基本法》理解，「特區政府同共產黨係兩樣嘢嚟嘅，喺『港人治港』下，我哋傾嘅對口單位依然係特區政府」；又指「港共政權」是對政府的批評，「因為我理解嘅共產黨呢有好多對人嘅打壓，我就話緊特區政府就係做緊呢啲嘢喇」，但他並非將兩者等同，只是認為做事方式上「真係好似」。李運騰追問，即何啟明再次不是說字面的意思？何否認，重申港府和共產黨是「兩樣嘢」，只是「我哋見到真係有時候特區政府做咗好多唔好嘅事都好似共產黨咁」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;參選帖文提和勇一體-何啟明稱僅指大選配票&quot;&gt;參選帖文提「和勇一體」 何啟明稱僅指大選配票&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引何啟明7月22日宣布參加正式選舉的帖文，何確認於《國安法》後、發文前幾天準備。帖文提及九龍西「現有4席為賣港惡勢力所盤踞。我們要逆轉形勢，光復九龍西，前路定非坦途。然而過去一年，香港人『和勇一體』，團結守望」。萬德豪問何啟明是否同意「和勇不分」，何指這是其參選宣言，意指大選時配票要「和勇一體」。萬德豪質疑何是談及街頭上的「勇」、包括使用暴力，何否認，強調是指「勇」的人投票要一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問及帖文「在香港重光後回望，也不過是敵人滅亡前的瘋狂」一句，何笑說「如果咁樣逐個逐個字眼呢⋯⋯簡單講，呢份係我選舉宣言，係有選舉語言成分嘅」，並在追問下同意是誇張法。何其後再主動補充，就「敵人」一說，「我係視佢為對手，希望贏佢，就係咁簡單」，又指「贏係有誇張成分嘅，但係就唔係你死我亡嘅狀態」。被問指誰為敵人，何啟明說既指建制派對手亦指香港政府，「要贏呢個敵人，就要贏呢場選舉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示施德來的提名表格，附上共同綱領，何啟明表示「我係喺佢交咗之後先至知呢件事」，而他有去的會議也沒有討論該份文件。控方最後指，何啟明與其他被告串謀無差別否決預算案，以迫使政府回應五大訴求，意圖顛覆國家政權，何啟明一一否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方表示盤問完結，何啟明覆問下再確認無從戴耀廷收過九西會議的訊息。何作供完畢，說「唔該晒咁多位」，後拿着水杯返回座位並笑着呼氣，續由另一名被告劉偉聰作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/I4S7NT5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（6日）踏入審訊第80天。大律師劉偉聰今開始作供，供述參與初選的經過。他表示2016年旺角衝突被告盧建民上訴失敗後決定參選立法會，因認為《公安條例》的暴動和非法集結罪頗嚴苛，望能進入議會修訂法例；而他曾因認為初選不民主、自己取態溫和勝算不大而不打算參加，惟因避免被視為「鬼」故終決定參與。劉並指自己只曾出席首次九西協調會議，肯定戴耀廷會上無提要綑綁當選後行為，會上亦無達成共識。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對名字出現在「墨落無悔」聲明書，劉指他無簽署亦無授權人簽署，至今仍不知原因。劉亦指他不完全同意亦從沒有主張五大訴求，認為要求撤銷控罪是邀請行政干預司法，對此抱有懷疑；就要求問責警暴亦認為不能一方面要求特赦示威者、一方面要求追究警暴。惟劉指他最終沒有公開澄清，因不想人知道他不同意五大訴求，否則形同「選舉自殺」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉偉聰以英語作供-稱曾加入香港皇家警察修博士研憲制修訂&quot;&gt;劉偉聰以英語作供 稱曾加入香港皇家警察、修博士研憲制修訂&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明今完成4天的作供，後由同參選九龍西、自辯的劉偉聰作供，身穿深藍間條西裝的劉以英語宣誓和作供。劉先表示，他承認參與九龍西初選，但否認控罪，因他沒有與其他人串謀否決預算案，亦無意顛覆國家政權或嚴重干擾特區政權機關履行職能。劉並指其證供分為三部分，一為自我介紹，二為他為何參與初選及參選時做了什麼，三為他案發時沒做過的事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉先講述個人背景，指他55歲，於香港出生，1993年畢業於香港大學法律系後加入香港皇家警察任見習督察，4個月後因獲政務官（AO）有條件取錄而辭職。他形容政務官是他的理想工作（dream job），不過他終因三級榮譽畢業，未達要求不獲聘。劉偉聰數個月後任自由黨創黨主席李鵬飛的寫手，並於1994年修讀法學專業證書（PCLL），翌年正式成為執業大律師。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉於2000年赴英國倫敦政治及經濟學院（LSE）修讀哲學碩士，修讀博士期間研究範圍主要為英美自由主義、憲制設計等，其論文題目為〈Rationality of constitutional ammedment（憲制修訂的合理性）〉，以中國和美國憲法為例子，研究由一代人設計的憲制約束下一代人是否合理，他對1954年後中國憲法的修訂尤感興趣。惟劉研究4年後，因與老師意見不合而沒有完成學位。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱約於2016年起參與社會事件案件引著作談擁護法治價值&quot;&gt;劉稱約於2016年起參與社會事件案件、引著作談擁護法治價值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰供稱返港後，於2010年至2012年先後任暫委特委裁判官及暫委裁判官，其後繼續執業，並於2016至2017年左右因社會環境改變，而主要參與社會事件的案件如非法集結及暴動。劉並於2017至2021年於港大法律系任客座副教授，2012至2020年為《信報》及《明報》寫專欄，主要談及書本、電影和文化活動，很間中才談及時事。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉指，他個人的價值和操守均被法律的價值和精神所形塑，並引用他曾合着的《Professional Conduct and Risk Management in Hong Kong》一書中，他撰寫有關「何謂法律專業操守（legal professional ethics）」的段落，提及法律專業人士不僅對其客人負責、亦要對法庭和公義負責，又指法律專業是構成法治的一部分，超出商業利益或個人成就。劉指這是他任大律師以來一直持守的價值。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱對反修例運動感同情2019年當選區議員&quot;&gt;劉稱對反修例運動感同情、2019年當選區議員&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰其後供述為何參與初選。劉於2019年當選深水埗又一村區議員，他表示此前從未想過參選，稱1997年前渴望加入英殖政府，但回歸後只有特首可組成政府，而他認為參政應是指加入政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟劉指在2019年的反修例運動，他對運動有極大同情，亦對草案感不滿（displeased），同意許多人擔心會令兩制的界線變得模糊；更重要是他認為條例大幅增加特首要求移交逃犯的權力，卻無相應增加法庭權力，「無可避免令法庭捲入政治風波，侵蝕法治」。法官陳慶偉說他完全不同意劉的看法，不過那不重要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉表示雖然如此，他當時並無參與許多示威，因認為他以律師身分幫助被捕者更有用；但後來有朋友打算參與區議會選舉但未能成功，邀請他代為參選，他遂選擇他居住、原屬親政府議員的又一村選區出選，最終以99票之差勝出，並坦言不會因當選只有諮詢性質的崗位而感到高興。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續展示他參選時的橫額，印有一隻貓及「從投開始 由您出發」、「Let the people see the sun」。劉解釋是來自英國詩人奧登（W.H. Auden）於1939年的詩〈Law, like love〉，並於庭上讀出第一段：「Law, say the gardeners, is the sun,/ Law is the one/ All gardeners obey/ To-morrow, yesterday, to-day.」，指他望當選後推動基層的法治教育。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱九西首次協調會戴耀廷提可用否決權但無與初選綑綁無達共識&quot;&gt;劉稱九西首次協調會戴耀廷提可用否決權但無與初選綑綁、無達共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰續指，當選後原沒打算參選立會，但在2020年2月有朋友、支持者和媒體查詢甚至鼓勵他參選。劉指他開始考慮但未有決定，因擔心其能力和憂影響執業，他並於3月獲助理告知九龍西有公開會議（open meeting）供有意參選者參加，他遂出席3月24日的首次九西協調會議。劉指他就會議無收到任何特定邀請，而會上除他和助理外，記得戴耀廷、區諾軒、趙家賢、何啟明和巴裔商人簡浩名亦在場，共有約10多20人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續指，雖然區諾軒供稱會上傳閱「35+計劃」文件，但他沒有印象；並指會上主要由戴耀廷發言，戴指民主派於區選取得勝利，但投票率沒有大幅增加，故需「策略性投票（strategic voting）」才能勝出立會選舉。劉認為其說法有道理，因區選是單議席單票席，立會是比例代表制。他並指不記得戴有否說「35+」，但有提及取得大多數。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉指，戴亦有提及民主派過半能做到很多事，因有許多憲制權力如否決預算案，但不記得戴有否提及「積極」運用和「可以用可以唔用」，戴並建議可進行公民投票或選前民調，並指九西目標議席為4席。惟劉強調，非常肯定戴當時沒有提及要將初選與議員當選後行為綑綁。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉憂初選不民主及令政綱激化惟不獲理會不知悉有第二次會議&quot;&gt;劉憂初選不民主及令政綱激化惟不獲理會、不知悉有第二次會議&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰指，他會上亦提出初選可能會不民主，因會剝奪選民的選擇，而他當時沒說出口的是，初選會令政綱變得激進（radicalization），趕走立場溫和者。惟劉指，當時無人對此話題感興趣，而他因已了解民主派的協調安排故選擇離開。劉指會議歷時約一小時，參與者「來來去去」，他離開時亦看不到任何共識或協議達成，認為會議更像是簡介（briefing）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉並指，他會後沒有與人交換聯絡，解釋是律師的習慣，其他人只能透過助理聯絡他，他只會留個人電話給朋友與親人；而他當時未確定要參選，亦認為初選不適合他（not a thing for me），故沒有出席第二次會議，他亦不知道有第二次會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱盧建民上訴失敗後決定參選-望入立會修訂暴動法例&quot;&gt;劉稱盧建民上訴失敗後決定參選 望入立會修訂暴動法例&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續解釋後來決定參選立法會的原因，指他當時是2016年旺角衝突罪成被告盧建民上訴案的律師代表，其上訴於2020年4月29日被高等法院駁回。劉指這影響了他的想法，因他認為《公安條例》下非法集結及暴動的罪行均頗為嚴苛（quite draconian）。陳慶偉聞言即指法例因英殖年代的1967暴動而定下，劉同意，但認為法例應與時並進。陳慶偉指他在這一點上同意劉，說「事實上很多香港的法例都要修訂和更新」，舉例《藥劑業及毒藥條例》是複製自英國1933年的法例，直至2023年仍在使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續指，認為3人便構成暴動的罪行範圍太廣闊（sweeping），舉例英國已修例將非法集結人數門檻定為12人，故當時希望能作出改變，並指現時回看，上訴失敗是重要的因素令他決定參選，同意法官指他想進入議會修訂法例。劉又解釋，望修改相關法例，因認為民主運動要有更知情（better-informed）的公民社會，可有辯論的空間。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱僅讀戴耀廷英文文章無讀過真攬炒十步對倡大殺傷力武器感驚訝&quot;&gt;劉稱僅讀戴耀廷英文文章無讀過〈真攬炒十步〉、對倡大殺傷力武器感驚訝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續提及，戴耀廷4月28日發出〈真攬炒十步 這是香港人宿命〉一文，劉偉聰表示他沒有讀過，他直至收到控方文件夾才知道有該篇文章。劉指他讀大學時由戴耀廷任教法律寫作和研究，但其後二人無聯絡，只是在2019至2020年則在兩三個場合被邀請就法治演講，如曾同被邀出席醫管局員工陣線舉辦的《芝加哥七人案：驚世審判》電影放映會及法治對談，此時余慧明向旁聽席微笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續指，數年前曾讀戴寫的〈讓愛與和平佔領中環〉，但認為其中文冗長（convoluted）和沉悶，故之後沒有讀他寫的中文文章，但有讀其英文學術文章，並指2020年上半年曾讀戴有份寫的〈Pursuing Democracy in an Authoritarian State: Protest and the Rule of Law in Hong Kong（在極權下追求民主：香港的示威與法治）〉一文，戴提及面對香港法治挑戰，真正戰場是「文化」，要在社會培養更強的法律文化；又提倡民主派政黨和公民社會要宣傳策略投票以取得更多議席。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/DpKojr8.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
▲ 戴耀廷&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉表示，他被戴於文章倡議的策略性投票和文化改變吸引，而他當時沒讀過戴寫的中文文章，亦不知道「巨大殺傷力憲制武器」的概念。劉形容，戴寫英文文章時猶如另一個人，故他聽到戴提倡此概念時感到驚訝。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱兩同事離開團隊憂被視為鬼遂再考慮參與初選&quot;&gt;劉稱兩同事離開團隊、憂被視為「鬼」遂再考慮參與初選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰續表示，盧健民上訴被駁回後，他更確定參選立會，但當時仍未打算參與初選，因認為性質不民主並認為其溫和取態難以取勝。而當時有兩名同區的議員同事常為他提供建議，又鼓勵他參選立法會和初選，指若不參與別人便會認為他是「鬼」或不忠誠（undevoted）。劉指與兩人意見不合，二人遂於5月告知不能再與他合作，轉為支持其他潛在參選人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉指二人雖沒明言，但其離開應與他不參與初選有關，亦考慮到他在大選的勝算。劉指這令他重新考慮是否參與初選，亦認為他們所言有理，因屆時正式選舉他會與比他更有認受性（legitimacy）的初選勝出者競爭，他可能會被視為「鬼」，未開始競選便背負「原罪」。劉續在法官陳仲衡詢問下，指當時未聽過「三投三不投」，指是初選前數日看到相關橫額才得悉。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱無簽墨落無悔-至今仍不知名字出現在聲明的原因&quot;&gt;劉稱無簽「墨落無悔」 至今仍不知名字出現在聲明的原因&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉偉聰續指，其助理於6月告知他會有初選，而他不知道6月9日的初選記者會。至於6月10日發布的「墨落無悔」聲明，劉指他是於九西選舉論壇前數日，才由助理和義工告知其名字出現在聲明上。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉表示他沒有簽署聲明，亦沒有授權任何人為他簽署，而他的社交媒體和所有選舉材料也沒有提及該聲明，因為他並不同意該聲明。李運騰問，那他的名字為何會出現在其他人轉發的帖文上？劉指他當時有詢問所有競選團隊成員有否代簽，但無人有頭緒，事件至今對他仍是謎團（mystery），而他當時亦尚未正式宣布會參與初選。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱墨落語法上解偶然非刻意共同綱領僅指政協共同綱領&quot;&gt;劉稱「墨落」語法上解偶然非刻意、「共同綱領」僅指政協共同綱領&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續指，發現「被簽署」聲明後便閱讀聲明內容，第一反應是失笑。劉解釋他對中文頗為敏感，認為想強調刻意做某些事時，便會將動詞放在賓語前，故中文有說法「落子無悔」，但「墨落」則只代表墨水是偶然或意外落下，林卓廷微笑。此時有份發起聲明的鄒家成翹起雙手靠牆、頭微微向上，陳慶偉指「鄒家成在疑惑（wondering）」；李運騰亦指這不是批評文法的場合，「可能是中文文法、可能是日文文法，我們不知道」，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉指他不是批評任何人，只是談及當初的理解，並指聲明亦提及「共同綱領」，但認為簽署的本土派或不熟悉，中文上「共同綱領」只能指《中華人民政治協商會議共同綱領》。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱墨落僅陳述明顯事實本土派比平時溫和或想回復理性形象&quot;&gt;劉稱「墨落」僅陳述明顯事實、本土派比平時溫和或想回復理性形象&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續指，認為聲明只是陳述明顯的事實（state the obvious），包括談及當選後會運用憲制權力，及票數不足便不會參選。劉並認為，稱會運用權力也不代表一定要用，舉例若仍有死刑，他作為高等法院法官會表示運用所有憲制權力包括死刑執行法例，但不代表他會對所有犯人判處死刑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，劉指當時看到聲明有本土派簽署，認為他們立場應較進步（progressive），疑惑他們為何只寫如此溫和（mild）的聲明。他續認為本土派可能望透過聲明重塑正常、理性、合法的形象，才表明只會運用《基本法》賦予的權力，以爭取更廣闊光譜的支持，並解釋因有本土派倡制裁中國官員等，而該些倡議並非《基本法》賦予的權力。陳慶偉指，即劉偉聰認為聲明並沒有任何不尋常的地方，故他也沒有問題？劉指唯一不尋常，就是本土派使用了如此溫和及體面的字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱不同意五大訴求-指要求撤控是行政干預司法&quot;&gt;劉稱不同意五大訴求 指要求撤控是行政干預司法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;聲明提及會運用《基本法》權力迫使特首回應五大訴求，即「撤銷所有抗爭者控罪，令相關人士為警暴問責，並重啟政改達致雙普選」，劉指他所有競選材料都無提過「五大訴求」。陳慶偉問，他不同意（subscribe to）五大訴求？劉說簡單而言「是」，並解釋人生中有些事是他認為可以接受（agreeable）但不會參與（engage），就如就同性戀，他尊重人們的性向，但他本人沒有選擇成為同志。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，即劉認為「五大訴求」是好的，但他不會爭取？劉同意，並逐一解釋為何他不會提倡五大訴求。就撤回《逃犯條例》，劉稱當時政府已撤回。而就特首下台，他指對誰任特首不關心，重要的是制度，但《基本法》列明特首同時要對中央政府和特區負責，他認為那不是經常都可能，是一個左右為難的局面（catch-22 situation）。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉續指，就特赦抗爭者或撤銷所有控罪，他現在仍對此感到懷疑（skeptical），認為即邀請行政部門干預司法事務，有些案件亦已進入司法程序。至於要求相關人士為警暴問責，劉亦指對一方面要求撤銷示威者控罪、一方面卻追究警暴感到「不舒服」，認為應效法南非處理種族隔離問題的「真相與和解委員會」，讓雙方說出真相，但不會作出檢控追究。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉最後指他不反對雙普選，但認為頗為「遙遠（remote）」，因要重啟政改，特首要寫報告和獲全國人大通過等，故其政綱也沒提到普選。劉解釋時法官李運騰三度打斷，指不認為劉要解釋其政治立場，重申法庭只關注被告案發時的意圖，並非參與任何政治的辯論，又指明白劉表示他不支持五大訴求，着他談及下一話題。劉指表示其價值觀與其意圖相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;劉稱無澄清無簽墨落-因形同選舉自殺&quot;&gt;劉稱無澄清無簽「墨落」 因形同「選舉自殺」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡最後問，劉最後有否要求將名字從「墨落無悔」移除？劉指沒有，並指是刻意為之，解釋他曾想過在社交媒體澄清，但這樣會曝露他不同意五大訴求。陳慶偉問那有什麼問題，劉不是有原則和誠信的人嗎（a man with principle and integrity）？劉解釋因那等同「選舉自殺（election suicide）」，又指他仍是有原則和誠信，競選期間也從沒有提倡五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;劉最後指，他不同意「墨落無悔」第一點，但同意就支持度不足須停止選舉工程，因那是參與初選的意義。至於最後「以上聲明，僅為確保抗爭陣營參選人，有最基本的抗爭意志。我們的抗爭決心，絕不應因極權打壓而讓步」等部分，劉指他當時沒留意，但不同意當中的修辭以及該修辭所代表的概念。&lt;/p&gt;

Da’esh of course, saw the Taliban’s takeover as a threat and could not use it to advance its cause in Europe. AQ, on the other hand, decided not to exploit the opportunity, because it felt unsecure in its relationship with the Taliban and because of reservations on the ideologically spurious character of the regime. This report reviews propaganda and social media activities of jihadists and right-wing extremist (RWE) groups and assesses the impact of the fall of Kabul on their narratives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report reviews propaganda and social media activities of jihadists and right-wing extremist (RWE) groups and assesses the impact of the fall of Kabul on their narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right-wing extremist (RWE) groups showed an initial interest in the Taliban takeover for two opposing reasons. Some groups, focused on xenophobia and Islamophobia, thought the expected massive wave of Afghan asylum seekers would offer them the opportunity to mobilise anti-immigrant sentiment and were positioning themselves for that purpose. Since this wave of immigrants has not yet materialised, these groups have turned their attention elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other range of RWE groups had a less conventional reaction to the fall of Kabul, seeing the Taliban as an example of the “triumph of the will” that could inspire other RWE groups drifting towards forms of violent mobilisation. The propaganda techniques of the global jihadists, while already familiar to RWEs, enjoyed a fresh surge in popularity. The absorption of jihadist techniques appears to be a long-term trend for the RWE spectrum. Even the inspirational value of the Taliban was still being discussed one year after the takeover, suggesting some lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, there is little space for targeted strategic communications, Afghanistan per se not being much of an issue. If anything, the situation in Afghanistan could offer new opportunities for narratives that normalise and take the shine off jihadism as a political-military movement with internal rivalries, hatred, civil wars even – much like any other political or military movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, the fall of Kabul could end up benefiting the RWE side more in the long term. The negative impact in terms of Western failure in Kabul can fade over time, but this cannot really be eradicated, even if the Emirate were to implode in the future. What RWE groups have learned in terms of propaganda techniques cannot be unlearned. Addressing these issues might already be beyond the scope of counter narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fall of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on 15 August 2021, the way it happened (with the country’s elite fleeing and de facto handing the capital over to the more radical wing of the Taliban, the Haqqani network) and the poorly planned withdrawal of foreign states and troops all contributed to project an image of Western failure and underperformance. At the same time, the reaction in the media, but also Western policymakers, viewed the Taliban takeover as a victory of jihadism as a whole. Fears of Afghanistan turning once again into a safe haven for global jihadist groups bent on exporting violent jihad worldwide, were displayed by both the media and policymakers alike. Moreover, there was a strong expectation of a massive wave of Afghan refugees making their way for Europe, via Iran and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, it is not surprising that there might have been strong expectations of an impact from the Taliban takeover as far as Europe. The new wave of refugees, already estimated in 2021 to amount to 500,000, would have been twice the size of the previous largest wave from Afghanistan that hit Europe in 2015. Right-wing and xenophobic groups could only be expected to seize the opportunity to stir trouble and reinvigorate narratives of “great replacements” by Muslim immigrants. Jihadist groups were expected to use the victory of the Taliban in Afghanistan as a propaganda opportunity for relaunching global jihad, whose image had been tarnished by the destruction of the Caliphate in Iraq and Syria and by the AQ-Da’esh rivalry. Jihadist sympathisers and disaffected Muslims in Europe were feared to be potentially galvanised into action by the combination of a display of weakness, ineffectiveness, and lack of determination by Western powers and of resolution, determination, and readiness to sacrifice by the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a year later, these fears have turned out to be mostly unwarranted, even if they cannot be entirely ruled out for the future. Although large numbers of Afghans did leave the country, few had made it to Europe by the summer of 2022. Since far-right propaganda tends to be based on the manipulation of facts, one of the main reasons for right-wing actors to get excited had not materialised yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No major propaganda campaign of jihadist groups, aimed at exploiting the Taliban’s success, materialised in the months following the fall of Kabul and seem unlikely to ever happen. Does this mean that there has been no impact whatsoever?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report reviews the propaganda and social media activities of jihadists and right-wing extremist (RWE) groups and assesses the direct impact of the fall of Kabul on their narratives, which (as hinted above) was very modest, as well as the indirect impact, which neither media nor policy makers had anticipated. This indirect impact is much harder to assess, especially with such a short-term perspective, so the findings of this report in that regard can only be tentative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is set out in four sections. The first is dedicated to briefly setting out the post-fall of Kabul context in Afghanistan, as well as describing the general narratives emerging from the fall of Kabul, regardless of any reference to Europe. The second section focuses instead on narratives specifically aimed at audiences within the European Union, trying also to evaluate their impact so far (to summer 2022). The third section looks at potential P/CVE interventions; given the limited exploitation of Afghanistan in the narratives of extremist groups, this section focuses on specific aspects, such as the evolution of the propaganda from RWE groups and actors. The last section discusses indirect interventions and the implications that different diplomatic and aid strategies could have on the extremists’ narratives and on their potential impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;METHODOLOGY&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This report is based on information available in the public domain (social media, media, reports) and on a series of interviews and contacts with policy makers, researchers, and journalists. In total nine researchers and academics, four staff of social media monitoring organisations, seven officials of EU member states and two journalists have been consulted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media accounts linked to both jihadist and right-wing groups are of course easily accessible; some comments which appeared in not easily accessible chats have been obtained via the BBC Monitoring service. An effort was made to contact several researchers and journalists, but the response rate was relatively low. Some images have been extracted from social media and websites, while others have been contributed by interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of social media activities is such that they are difficult to cover without a systematic effort, which was beyond the scope of this paper. Organisations monitoring social media on a commercial basis were understandably reluctant to share more than a general summary of their findings. As a result, this report does not incorporate any statistics or data and summarises instead the opinion, views, and shared findings of the different interviewees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-1-jihadist--right-wing-narratives-on-the-taliban-takeover&quot;&gt;SECTION 1: JIHADIST &amp;amp; RIGHT-WING NARRATIVES ON THE TALIBAN TAKEOVER&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;11-the-afghan-context&quot;&gt;1.1. THE AFGHAN CONTEXT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the Taliban and Al Qa’ida (AQ) have maintained close relations was clear even before al-Zawahiri was killed in a drone strike in Kabul in July 2022. However, evidence dating back to the 2002-2011 period shows that there were tensions and long-standing issues between them. As of August 2021, AQ considered that it only had sub-components of Taliban it could trust, first and foremost the Haqqani network. AQ sources acknowledged that the majority of the Taliban was opposed to its plans to align the Emirate with global jihadist aims and that this was a source of tension. AQ and other foreign jihadists, mainly Central Asians, tried to resist the demands of the Emirate that they would be subjected to a complete and detailed census and that the Emirate should determine the areas where they would be expected to reside. As of July 2022, the matter was still the object of a tug of war between the Taliban and foreign jihadists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts mention two possible explanations concerning the muted reaction of AQ to the Taliban takeover. One is that due to the friction mentioned above and fearing a drift of the Emirate along a route similar to that taken by Al-Nusra Front / Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in Syria, AQ might want to keep some distance in case friction intensifies. One should note that the organisational relationship of Al-Nusra and AQ was once much closer than the Taliban and AQ have ever been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other explanation provided is that AQ, wary of creating trouble for the Emirate in its delicate phase of consolidation, opted to mute its propaganda campaign in order not to embarrass the Taliban and facilitate its establishment of diplomatic relations with other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources within the Taliban, AQ and affiliated groups such as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan all support the first explanation. They described a split in the Taliban movement, wherein the primary intent was on bringing under control Qaidists and other foreign fighters, while aligning them to the foreign policy interest of the Emirate. This included further cementing good relations with Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Russia, and China, and using foreign jihadists as a tool of pressure towards Pakistan and Tajikistan to try to obtain diplomatic or political concessions from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who monitored Taliban social media noted the effort to position themselves as moderates, facilitated by the attacks of the Islamic State’s propaganda, portraying the Taliban as traitors to the cause of global jihad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;12-global-jihadist-narratives&quot;&gt;1.2. GLOBAL JIHADIST NARRATIVES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the immediate aftermath of 15 August 2021, there was an expectation among many external observers that such a “monumental” development would “electrify” the global jihadist movement. Instead, as a result of the Afghan context discussed above, the propaganda campaign of AQ and its affiliates, centring around the return to power of the Emirate, has been very modest and largely limited to the first couple of months after the regime change in Kabul. AQ central released a celebratory message on 31 August, 16 days after the fall of Kabul and the date of the completion of the US withdrawal, as if AQ had doubts that congratulating the Taliban earlier entailed some risks. It is worth noting in this regard that “prominent al-Qaeda supporter Warith al-Qassam” cryptically criticised on social media “those who had doubted that al-Qaeda leadership figures would publicly comment on the return of the Taliban to power.” Clearly, there had been some tension over the delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the following days, AQ’s main branches followed suit. Apart from the official statement, there was semi-official or unofficial chatter related to events in Afghanistan, but it was not much, and this was mostly limited to August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message from AQ central hoped for the forthcoming liberation of a number of “Muslim lands”, but only mentioned Europe when wishing that its people (and those of East Asia) break free from the “shackles of American hegemony”. After that, however, AQ central kept silent and did not release any other propaganda or even statements. Remarkably, then leader Ayman al-Zawahiri did not comment at all on the Taliban takeover in any of his videos. Al-Zawahiri was not releasing much in terms of videos in those months, but the magnitude of this event should have justified his intervention. There were rumours that he might be dead (we now know these were not true) or critically ill (which he might have been). When towards the end of 2021 however, he resumed a more proactive propaganda effort, he still did not comment at all on the victory of the Taliban. Instead, he released a video criticising the United Nations (UN). The video was widely seen as an obvious criticism of the agreement the Emirate had reached that allowed the UN to take over salary payments for staff in health and education. Al-Zawahiri’s video was echoed by more explicit criticism of the Emirate’s decision from Qaidist intellectuals, such as Al Maqdisi (on Twitter on 20.12.2021).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the rare commentary on the Emirate during its first year in power came from Qaidist sympathisers / influencers such as Al Maqdisi himself. In general, these commentators defended the Emirate against the criticism directed against it by Da’esh, while at the same time criticising it on some specific points, mainly to do with the Taliban’s efforts to appease Western powers. Already in the immediate aftermath of regime change in Kabul, Qaidist commentators advised those colleagues, known to harbour reservations about the Taliban, to hold their tongue for the time being. A prominent Qaidist commentator, Shibl Osama, asked his colleagues to provide constructive criticism to the Taliban, advising them and pointing out mistakes “when they occur”, and acknowledged that the Taliban were “not a yardstick for Tawhid” (monotheism), that is not examples of virtue to be followed by Qaidists. Still, a debate on these issues started up on Telegram immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from relations with the UN, other points of criticism that started being mentioned in August 2021 and which reappeared over the following 12 months included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Emirate’s relations with Russia, China, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talks with India;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Talks with the US;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The belief that the Taliban might not fully implement Islamic Law, as understood by Salafis;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Their ban on carrying out attacks abroad from Afghanistan;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Praise for Turkish president Erdogan;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Efforts by some of its leaders to appease the West on women’s rights.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro-AQ groups have been active on servers such as Rocket.chat, where both official and semi-official releases appear (there are a number of media houses associated with AQ). The peak in Afghanistan-related propaganda on servers was between July and September 2021. Even then, there was very little from official AQ channels. The effort was almost entirely borne by the semi-official media houses, which were mostly redistributing selected material from the Taliban’s own propaganda output. This was, in fact, largely Haqqani network material and in particular Badri 313 videos (the Haqqanis’ special unit, under the Ministry of the Interior). After September, even this redistribution of Taliban propaganda started declining fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, Da’esh denounced the Taliban as “agents of the US”, even if some pro-Da’esh commentators saw the positive side of having the opportunity to face the Taliban while they were busy taking over the country and were vulnerable to challenges. Da’esh supporters also commented that the Taliban’s example could undermine the jihadist cause, encouraging negotiation. Pro-Da’esh social media accounts, such as Taliban Exposed, reinforced these accusations in the wake of the killing of al-Zawahiri in Kabul (31 July 2022), pointing at the Taliban themselves revealing details of the secret annexes of the 2020 Doha Agreement, that foresaw the US-Taliban intelligence cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources also noted that Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-K) output increased greatly and that the number of subscribers rose steeply on Rocket.chat. It appears that the Taliban takeover granted the Da’esh media house Al Azain an international profile that it previously did not have. Those monitoring Rocket.chat activity say that “everybody asks about Al Azain”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;13-right-wing-narratives&quot;&gt;1.3. RIGHT-WING NARRATIVES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the limited extent that the Taliban discussed western liberalism, their views tended (at least superficially) to echo those of RWEs, facilitating the extension of sympathy from the latter often seen in tropes and imagery mixing jihadist and far-right narratives and styles. Most report that convergence between RWE and jihadism comes from the United States of America (US), where the success of the Taliban in defeating the US “deep state” was sometimes noted with satisfaction and as a source of inspiration for their own ideological aims. If the “underdog” Taliban could win against a force as mighty as the US military, then so could violent right-wing extremist (VRWE) groups. However, European users also appear on these predominantly US sites. Both US and European RWE narratives celebrated the “chaotic Western withdrawal” from the “forever war in Afghanistan” and the “David-versus-Goliath humiliating defeat” of the most powerful military forces in the world, including the American, European, wider-Western states, and NATO in general. Such RWE celebrations and common enemy narratives highlight, once again, the ideological similarities between jihadist and right-wing extremist factions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RWEs used the Taliban victory to reinforce shared beliefs including anti-West, anti-globalism and anti-liberalism, anti-Semitism, anti-LGBTQ and anti-feminism, hard-line conservative, and religious values, and more. The tagline “one struggle” was also adopted by the far-right to highlight their commonalities and shared fight against the liberal democratic world order. The tagline appeared on platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord, and at times included images (Image 1). This was more prominently seen with American RWE members who compared the Taliban to the Founding Fathers and Confederate State (Image 2), and the Kabul siege to the Capitol Hill siege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/IQOCYl5.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Image 2: Post Comparing Taliban to the Confederate State (US)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Afghan takeover, Taliban online propaganda occasionally took aim at Western audiences. One image shared by the Taliban media wing was of Taliban fighters mimicking the 1945 American flag raising from Iwo Jima – intending to mock the image and the US military (Image 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative convergence was also profoundly visible in the use of typical far-/alt-right language and content style on social media. Far-right audiences embraced and propelled to fame a pro-Taliban Twitter user, Khostay, who used his account to disseminate propaganda in the western language of memes. The account had 35,000+ followers, constant engagement from Western audiences, gained a devoted far-right Twitter audience, and was praised in forums like 4Chan, 8Chan, and other “chans”, BitChut, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/MBn33qY.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Image 3: Post by Taliban’s Media-Wing Imitating the Iwo Jima Us Military’s Image&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the spectrum, the RWE online sphere crafted their own narratives and language on the Taliban in much the same way – converging the two extremist sides. Far-right users gave Taliban meme stars the nickname “akh-right” – the Islamist version of alt-right – bringing discourse that has been primarily confined to fringe platforms and “Chan Cultures” into mainstream spaces and social media platforms. In embracing the Taliban, far-right users across platforms coined new jargon like “Chadliban” or “Talichad”, “Talibased”, and “Taliban Pill”, and infused the Taliban into their memetic aesthetic, including StoneToss comics and characters like Pepe the Frog, Wojak, Yes Chad, Trollface, Soyjack, and others. The strategy aimed to give RWE and Taliban ideologies and narratives a greater viral reach and audience-base, as well as helping to normalise hate speech and violent rhetoric by shrouding it in ironic humour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Base”, a US-born but globally recruiting neo-Nazi group, is the English translation of “Al Qa’ida” and described their own mission using the term “white jihad”. The white jihad trend has been spotted again since the Afghan takeover, where a common theme is RWE actors praising the readiness of the Taliban to die for their ideas. This trend does not have a well-defined core ideology and is largely an American trend. It is a sort of cultural movement, so far only identified online. A common theme is anti-Western and anti-deep state propaganda, with anti-Semitic dimensions at times. Another theme has been lauding the Taliban for having defeated an invincible enemy, showing that all you need is the will. There is also the adoption of jihadist iconography for the purposes of RWE ideas; for example, the calendars of martyrs used by the jihadist is turned into a calendar of supremacist attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expected Afghan refugee influx is also used to reinforce the right-wing “great replacement” theory and the idea that globalisation is a plot to perpetrate “white genocide”. Extreme right “news channels”, both mainstream and fringe, gave voice to great replacement ideas during the Afghan takeover, helping to fuel ultra-nationalist anti-immigration narratives that act as foundational ideas for VRWE actors and groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-2-assessing-the-overall-impact-of-jihadist--right-wing-narratives-on-eu-audiences&quot;&gt;SECTION 2: ASSESSING THE OVERALL IMPACT OF JIHADIST &amp;amp; RIGHT-WING NARRATIVES ON EU AUDIENCES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;21-europe-relevant-jihadist-narratives&quot;&gt;2.1. EUROPE-RELEVANT JIHADIST NARRATIVES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the commercial monitoring firms appear to have a complete picture of violent extremist communications in Europe. Monitoring WhatsApp exchanges has become increasingly rare due to legal changes introduced by Meta, which have made entering chats with scraper software potentially illegal. Some of the companies monitoring WhatsApp have now dropped the app from their lists. Telegram, by contrast, remains easier to monitor, but it has been heavily targeted in police crackdowns since 2019, driving many users with extremist inclinations away towards Rocket.chat and other alternative platforms. There was nonetheless a return to Telegram in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the gaps in monitoring discussed above should be considered, EUROPOL, in its 14.07.22 report on terrorism, did not note any particular impact of regime change in Afghanistan on the European security landscape. A source within EUROPOL later confirmed that there was no AQ attempt to mobilise groups or individuals in Europe, with the Taliban’s victory as an example. This is largely echoed by the police forces of EU member states, which were contacted for this study. After regime change in Afghanistan, there were expectations of a direct impact, which were not met. There were some communication intercepts that drew attention of law enforcement, however the flow decreased rapidly. This included communications between a mix of Afghan and other detainees who expressed support for the Taliban takeover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct Taliban propaganda efforts aimed at Europe never materialised, and any known impact that Taliban material has had in Europe was through AQ distribution channels, which are not EU-specific. Within the political Islam stream, specific groups have reacted, mostly by welcoming the Taliban’s victory even in the absence of a “big wave of euphory”: Hizb-i-Islami and the non-Afghan branches of the Muslim Brothers, Hizb ut-Tahrir. The one significant exception is of course Da’esh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of what is seen on WhatsApp and Telegram channels is not strictly jihadist in content but could be described as contributing to creating an extremist, anti-authoritarian milieu in which the jihadist “fish” could easily swim. It features themes such as the justification of jihad in religious terms, relishing in the humiliation of the “imperialists”, etc. There is also sympathy and justification of the Taliban’s jihad without any reference to global jihad, but simply taking the Taliban’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that while in general Da’esh-AQ rivalry remains strong, it appeared to be decreasing, at least up to al-Zawahiri’s killing in July 2022. The two core constituencies (the first generation of global jihadists, loyal to AQ, and the new generation mainly pro-Da’esh) remain well distinct. However, especially in Europe loose sympathisers of the two groups did not appear very interested in intra-global jihadist diatribes – some Da’esh supporters were clearly sharing happiness about the Taliban takeover with AQ supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;22-the-impact-of-the-taliban-takeover-among-audiences-in-europe&quot;&gt;2.2. THE IMPACT OF THE TALIBAN TAKEOVER AMONG AUDIENCES IN EUROPE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afghan communities in Europe have, in recent years, had comparatively low levels of involvement in any type of political violence, whether planned or carried out. In Italy, for example, jihadist activities are mostly detected within the Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian communities, with Afghans barely appearing. This was true of the pre-regime change landscape and remains true today. Over the past 10 years, there have been just 4 cases of Afghans being involved in any kind of violence (including planned violence) across Europe. The main recent event involved two Afghans arrested in Sweden on terror related charges who were detained in April 2021, i.e. before the takeover. EU Member States (EUMS) subsequently intensified checks on arrivals from Afghanistan, fearing infiltration by terrorist organisations, however they did not identify any threats nor any sign of anti-Taliban dissidents being threatened by the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to sources in the Dutch Ministry of the Interior, no concern was proactively raised regarding jihadists narratives aimed at the diaspora, while consultations with representatives of Afghan diaspora communities on different topics have taken place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Italy, the police have not detected security-relevant commentary on the Taliban takeover in WhatsApp chats, Telegram, or TikTok. No evidence of fundraising linked to Afghanistan has been detected in Italy either. In Belgium, Salafi and Islamist circles have expressed satisfaction for the change of regime, however the police are still assessing what this might mean in terms of potentially violent jihadist activities in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common view within European police forces is that Da’esh does not appear to have an organised presence in Europe, contrary to AQ, including in diaspora communities. Both organisations face a structural crisis in Europe. In terms of future risks, some communities are seen at greater potential risk. In Italy, for example, there are some fears concerning the Pakistani and Indian communities, however so far, no evidence of risk has emerged. The Pakistani community in Italy has indeed been figuring prominently in counter-terrorism activities, even after 15 August 2021. 14 Pakistanis were arrested in one of the largest CT raids ever in June 2022. Neither this, nor other episodes, are seen as related to events in Afghanistan. One very minor exception is that of a Pakistani citizen detained for having praised the TTP, Bin Laden, Taliban and for having held jihadist material, praising martyrdom. This was deemed to be a case of self-radicalisation. Despite the very limited links of jihadist activities to the Taliban takeover, the Pakistani community is also seen as potentially at risk for two separate reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The widespread narrative of “victory” in Afghanistan within the community, which crosses over party and sectarian divides. Pakistan’s support for the Taliban is seen as having been key to defeating western powers, especially the US, and this is a matter of pride. In 2020, the Pakistani man who carried out an attack against the old office of Charlie Hebdo did not have a jihadist background and appears to have acted out of hurt national pride, as at that time, there was a lot of anger in Pakistan against France.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The pre-existing presence of activists and networks of Pakistani Islamist, Salafi and possibly Deobandi organisations in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as future risk goes, there is speculation that the Indian Muslim community in Italy (and presumably the rest of Europe too) might also be vulnerable as the context of Afghanistan evolves. It has been at the centre of considerable propaganda efforts by jihadist groups, due to recent religious tension in India. The Bangladeshi community in Italy is a special case and is not seen at high risk. Vice versa, Arab communities are not seen as likely to be influenced by events in Afghanistan. The large Syrian communities are described as very Syro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite much speculation by some analysts that Afghanistan could become a host of European foreign fighters again, episodes of European citizens travelling to Afghanistan for political reasons have been very few after 15 August and they have been limited to one or two cases in France, as far as data shows. The most prominent case has been that of Omar Omsen (Omar Diaby), leader of a small French jihadist group known as Firqat ul Gharaba, linked to AQ, which was among the first groups to congratulate the Taliban for their takeover, at a time when the group was actively involved in recruiting volunteers for armed jihad on French ground. In the summer of 2022, a live event on Telegram featured Diaby after he was released by HTS in Idlib (Syria), where he stated that he wanted to travel to Afghanistan, but not immediately, because the country was “not ready”. He stated his intention to move to a country where Muslims are not “discriminated against”, although he also mentioned Indonesia as a possible alternative destination, alongside Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expectation is in fact that the more remote the takeover becomes, the less likely an impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some observers argue that it is not currently a priority for Da’esh to carry out attacks in Europe, as it does not make sense tactically. Instead, Da’esh might prefer to focus on fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the dearth of developments directly related to security, the main measurable impact of regime change in Afghanistan have been the reactions by Muslim non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and Muslim community associations in Europe. The most notorious case has been that of Barakat City, the organisation of Idris Sandi, which has a relatively large following in France. The organisation was banned after congratulating the Taliban on their takeover, however that only made it more popular. It stopped short of supporting the idea of a jihad in Europe but used arguments such as “God is on the Taliban’s side”, stating ideological sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chairman of the Muslim Brothers-linked “Deutsche Muslimische Gemeinschaft e.V.” (DMG), Khallad Swaid, commented positively on Twitter on the international troop withdrawal, which he assessed as an opportunity for “peace, justice and prosperity”. While he stayed away from endorsing violence or jihadism as a principle, he also put the massive restrictions on women’s rights into perspective by comparing the right to full-face veils with the secular principle in France. In Spain, the spokesperson for the Muslims against Islamophobia association, Ibrahim Miguel Ángel Pérez, expressed happiness about the Taliban takeover and described it as the liberation of Afghanistan from American imperialism. He argued, however, that the Emirate was going to be a moderate regime and ready to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual sympathisers of jihadist groups, such as German convert @FalkBernhard (622 followers on Twitter), rejoiced at the Taliban’s victory and continued to tweet in support, mainly presenting the Taliban as a sort of defeat of the imperialist West. In the case of associations, they stayed away from endorsing violence or jihadism, although they usually avoid discussing the links between the Emirate and AQ. The most popular Europe-based sympathisers of the Emirate on social media, have occasionally criticised the Emirate, for example on girls’ education: @awsanzar (10,100 followers on Twitter); @Emran_Feroz (37,800 followers on Twitter); @Paktyaw4l (12,600 followers on Twitter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this (Muslim Associations and individual sympathisers) amounts to anything resembling a direct security threat, but it is still relevant because it seems to indicate how extremist or ultra-conservative views are being expressed in public more easily following the Taliban takeover. This might signal the further undermining of EU values within sections of Muslim communities in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that WhatsApp chats are mostly not monitored due to reasons cited in section 2.1 on Europe-relevant jihadist narratives above, any picture of what is going on in this platform can only be partial. Evidence indicates that WhatsApp is used by extremists, including jihadists. Social media channels are used to cast the recruitment net wider among the public, and the responsive individuals are then contacted for proselytising. At the same time, many communities also deemed to be fertile recruitment ground by the jihadists are targeted by recruiters for infiltration. Networks of sympathisers use WhatsApp chats and similar to remain in contact and circulate material deemed to be just above the illegality threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, the fall of Kabul prompted a massive increase in IS-K propaganda aimed at countering the Taliban’s and AQ’s narrative of success. As many as thirty new outlets have been involved in this effort, in a decentralised effort that differs substantially from Da’esh efforts elsewhere, for example in Africa (which are instead completely centralised). For the first time, a significant portion of this propaganda was released in English. There might be multiple reasons for this, not all related to Europe. One possible reason that is, however, relevant for European security is the intent to stimulate recruitment in Europe, perhaps in order to replace the loss of many Da’esh media operators due to the police crackdown in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of fundraising, current knowledge is that over the last 1-2 years, the police have seen grassroots efforts outwardly claiming to be in favour of Da’esh prisoners in Syrian camps and for detainees held on terrorism charges (online). Fundraising takes place through non-Da’esh specific Facebook and Twitter accounts, which have no violent content to avoid being shut down. There is even evidence of fundraising for IS-K in Europe now, at least online, confirmed by Taliban sources as well as the detention of an IS-K operative in Afghanistan, who had raised thousands of euros in Germany and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;23-right-wing-narratives-in-europe&quot;&gt;2.3. RIGHT-WING NARRATIVES IN EUROPE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the Belgian authorities say of Belgium seems to apply across the EU: two streams of RWE reactions to regime change in Afghanistan have been detected. One centred around Islamophobia (all Muslims are ultimately like the Taliban and are therefore dangerous) and one centred around the inspiration that the Taliban’s victory provides for anybody opposing liberal democracy and aspiring to violently overthrow it. The latter had a more lasting impact than the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in section 1.3 about right-wing narratives above, the expected Afghan refugee influx was used to reinforce the RWE “great replacement” theory and idea that globalisation is a plot to perpetrate a “white genocide”. Extreme right “news channels”, both mainstream and fringe, gave voice to great replacement ideas during the Afghan takeover, helping to fuel ultra-nationalist anti-immigration narratives that act as foundational ideas for RWE and VRWE actors and groups. In France for instance, Breizh-Info, a far-right “news site” known for relaying propaganda and mis/disinformation, published “Immigration. Afghanistan to Afghans, Europe to Europeans!”, in which great replacement ideas were grossly espoused:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Not a single Afghan should cross the European border. Those who are here waiting for asylum must be expelled, like all the people who are on our territory and who have nothing to do with it; We no longer have time to feel sorry for the fate of others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in France, Generation Identity, a French turned pan-European RWE (and deemed VRWE by the French government) movement, was famous throughout 2018-2021 for organising hostile anti-migrant policing groups across European borders. The group was banned in France in March 2021.Former members, however, remain prominent in the French far-right, for instance within the Zouaves group, which was responsible for violence against pro-migrant and Afghan refugee activists during a rally for far-right presidential candidate, Éric Zemmour. They continue to promote great replacement and anti-migrant rhetoric using crises like Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany in particular, following positive statements by some politicians ready to welcome the expected wave of arrivals, right wing extremists were particularly vocal, even raising the spectrum of “civil war conditions” in Germany. In practice, due also to the failure of the “wave” to materialise, no RWE/VRWE attacks against the Afghan diaspora were identified in Germany in the year following the Taliban takeover. After a few months, the “Afghan wave” ceased to be a topic of commentary among the ranks of German far-right audiences and RWE individuals and groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the Occident (PEGIDA), a pan-European anti-Islam far-right movement from Germany, used the crisis to re-state their rejection of migrants and refugees in Germany and disdain towards the EU and Western politicians like Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, while praising the wits of the Taliban and former-US President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expected mass influx of Afghan refugees during the first year post-regime change have not met expectations (or fears) raised by headline-grabbing news reporting. In Italy, about 6,000 Afghans entered the country legally over 11 months. Thousands have also entered, or attempted to enter, as unregulated migrants. The exact figured of this flow cannot be known, given the unofficial method of migration, but the bulk of the 500,000 or so refugees that were, or are still, said to be on the move are stuck between Iran and Turkey. The type of commentary discussed above therefore started petering out once it became clear that no massive wave of refugees was entering Europe, at least so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, as already mentioned, the stream of RWE reactions sympathising with the Taliban and with jihadism in general had a longer-term impact. Across the European spectrum, a number of ultra-nationalist, RWE, and neo-Nazi groups posted announcements following the Taliban’s victory. There are echoes of White Jihadism in Europe, as there is a lot of sharing across continents, including for example praise for the Taliban from France because they used rudimentary weapons to defeat the US. The Nordic Resistance Front (NRF), a pan-Nordic neo-Nazi movement spanning Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, and Denmark, not only released a 2.5 hour podcast on the Taliban’s victory, they also reshared the official statement of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (the Taliban) after the takeover of Kabul with the title “Nationalist Socialist Taliban”. The latter press release is captioned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It took the Taliban less than two weeks to take back their country, after Globohomo just spent 20 years and trillions of dollars to make it into a gay democracy, complete with soyfeed and OnlyFans. Unless this is yet another GayOp to be unveiled, this should be seen as a major white pill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In France, the Vilains Fachos, a small neo-Nazi group which operates a racist, anti-LGBT and antisemitic Telegram channel with 10,000 subscribers before being banned in September 2022 and 1,800 after its relaunch, announced it was proud of recognising the Emirate and called the Taliban brothers and comrades (Image 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Zemq2ts.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Image 4: Post from the Vilains Fachos on Telegram&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Alianza Nacional (NA), a far-right neo-Nazi party in Spain, announced that the “newly formed Government of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has begun to rectify the measures of the Puppet Government imposed by the United States”, suggesting that the Taliban reversing, or in their words “rectifying”, Afghan governance was good. NA also stated that the EU “has become the ‘paradise’ – Hell would be more appropriate – of weak thinking; goodism, multiculturalism, gender ideology, pacifism, hedonism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some RWE actors not only celebrated the Taliban victory, but claimed it was inspiring and that they needed to learn from/emulate the Taliban example. For instance, NA stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The Afghans have taught us a lesson in love for the homeland, freedom and Religion. Twenty years of unrelenting struggle against the Occupying Armies of the United States and its British, Spanish and other Puppet States. In the end, with God’s help, Victory awaits you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentiments of inspiration and encouragement were also seen on other platforms linked to known RWE activists and groups. An RWE activist from the “Identitarian Movement” in Austria tweeted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The victory of the Taliban in Afghanistan means a crushing defeat for globalism. Drag queens, homoparades and human rights ideology have a break there. It’s time that Europe liberated itself from its status as an American colony!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On some neo-Nazi Telegram channels, users shared posts and images celebrating the Taliban and the need to take inspiration from their actions: “They were just some friends with a crazy dream of autonomy and freedom for their people. Freedom from the jew, and the autonomy to forge their own destiny. Hail the Guerilla Fighters. Hail Revolutionaries of Every Stripe.” Such narratives were found on NRM Telegram channels, where members of the neo-Nazi group wrote in support of the Taliban:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Sleep tight knowing that the Taliban will restore order in Afghanistan. Soon paedophiles will be raining from the rooftops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany, an ex-Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) member, Dubravko Mandic, posted a meme on Instagram celebrating the Taliban and their shared aim to “revolt against the modern world” (Image 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uJGfwb6.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ Image 5: Post from Dubravko Mandic’s Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview in January 2022 with Simon Lindberg, the Swedish leader of NRM, he stated that the Taliban, and other radical Islamist extremist groups, share a common denominator with RWE/VRWEs: their opposition to Jews/Jewish interests. Lindberg states that “like me, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban and others work to varying degrees against the Jewish power structure that controls most of the world today.” These narratives were prevalent in RWE propaganda after the Taliban takeover, and if nothing else, highlights growing convergence of ideas and enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it was the Taliban takeover of 2021 that inspired a renewed attention towards jihadism within the ranks of RWE, the most persistent impact was made by the propaganda techniques displayed by AQ and Da’esh, as previously discussed in section 1.3 with regard to the US. The Taliban’s propaganda, focused on their claim to statehood (even before August 2021) and never offered a suitable template to RWEs. Even their reliance on websites and Twitter did not suit far-right admirers. This attraction to the propaganda style of AQ and Da’esh has been more than a short-term infatuation. One year after the fall of Kabul, there was still no sign of RWEs growing tired of the new propaganda techniques – quite the contrary. Intercepted RWE communications were still explicitly discussing sharing common enemies with jihadists and of the need to imitate AQ and Da’esh, and forming an army of influencers and learning how to “instil fear” in the enemy (Image 6). The tagline “one struggle”, discussed in section 1.3 about the wider global right-wing narratives, was among others accompanied by European attempts to illustrate it graphically – for instance a Christian and Muslim standing side-by-side facing their “liberal enemy” (Image 7), and a German poster of a Nazi-Muslim alliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/0bPwbSp.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;em&gt;▲ Image 7: Archived Figure Shared by RWE Sympathizers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some RWE organisations find the AQ propaganda style more congenial – more intellectual, with extensive distribution of ideological content. Others, especially the more extreme ones, prefer the Da’esh style, focused on graphical information about operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the activities and propaganda traceable to organised RWE groups, there was some talk, at least in English, French and Italian among RWE individuals, praising the Taliban and the example that they set of what a small group of highly motivated men can accomplish and for their conservatism and resilience. Some groups even mentioned a partial overlap in ideology: hostility to feminism and women’s rights, prioritisation of the defence of the fatherland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expressions of sympathy for the Taliban from the ranks of RWE activists and groups were eventually wiped out by the start of the war in Ukraine in February 2022 as it monopolised more attention. Nonetheless, internal debates within RWE movements over propaganda techniques inspired by jihadism and the value of following the jihadists’ strategy have continued to be detected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, this convergence of RWE and jihadists is not particularly new or restricted to the Taliban; it was noticed before the fall of Kabul. RWE actors were already looking with interest to radical Islam in the 1980s, after the Iranian revolution. Neo-Nazi groups have increasingly taken pages out of jihadist groups’ playbook over the last decade. Feuerkrieg Division (FKD), a European neo-Nazi branch of Atomwaffen Division (AWD), posted a re-stylized screengrab from a famous Da’esh “how-to” video on homemade explosives in 2019 (Image 8). AWD members produced and promoted jihadist-inspired images, including some of Osama bin Laden. In a 2019 post titled “The Islamic Example”, AWD explained that the “culture of martyrdom and insurgency within groups like the Taliban and ISIS is something to admire and reproduce in the neo-Nazi terror movement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;24-the-impact-of-right-wing-narratives-among-audiences-in-europe&quot;&gt;2.4. THE IMPACT OF RIGHT-WING NARRATIVES AMONG AUDIENCES IN EUROPE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the year since the Taliban takeover, the observable impact is primarily to do with anti-Islam events and anti-migrant instances. It should be mentioned though that these events are not directly linked to, or a result of, the Taliban’s takeover but rather influenced by radical right narratives generally and those correlating with the above-mentioned Afghan crisis. Although not a new trend, a growing number of “border patrol” civilian, militia, and state-led, anti-migrant vigilante far-right, RWE, and VRWE groups have emerged as a result of the Afghan crisis. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Germany:&lt;/strong&gt; Late October 2021, Der III. Weg, an RWE neo-Nazi party, rallied civilian vigilante groups to the German-Polish border to forcibly prevent the crossing of refugees – the background to this was the mass Afghan migration fears.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;a. Other RWE groups such as the Free Saxons, also joined the Der III. Weg border patrol efforts, as well as created their own border patrol groups.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bulgaria:&lt;/strong&gt; Fuelled by great replacement conspiracy theories, RWE/VRWE vigilante and paramilitary groups have increased along Bulgaria’s border with Turkey – including the Vasil Levski Military Union and Shipka Bulgarian National Movement, which have grown in numbers by exploiting fears of a new Afghan migrant crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hungary:&lt;/strong&gt; The Hungarian government announced in late June 2022, new border hunter units with 2,200 staff, with a plan to add another 4,000 staff, to stop refugees crossing into Europe. This comes roughly 4 weeks after a violent incident along the Hungarian-Serbian border that left 3 dead and a dozen injured (though not at the hands of state forces, rather due to actions of the human-smuggler driving the car).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;a. Two-time Olympic champion, Attila Vári, also announced assisting efforts to recruit and train border hunters; further normalizing anti-migrant narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demonstrations and riots have also taken place in a number of European countries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greece:&lt;/strong&gt; In the month after the fall of Kabul, the rhetoric of the VRWE neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, largely disbanded in 2019, came into the limelight once more during a surge of anti-migrant and anti-Islam narratives. This was in large part due to the expected mass influx of Afghan refugees to Europe – this included RWE group riots with Nazi salutes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Netherlands &amp;amp; Belgium:&lt;/strong&gt; Voorpost, an ultra-nationalist right-wing group in Flanders, Holland, and South Africa, regularly posts statements with anti-immigration, anti-Islam, and great replacement ideas, including after the Taliban takeover. The group organised rallies in September 2021 to protest the housing of Afghan asylum seekers in Wassenaar, South Holland, and Europe more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweden (&amp;amp; Denmark):&lt;/strong&gt; In mid-April 2022, right-wing actors and groups announced their plans of burning the Qur’an at public rallies during the month of Ramadan in multiple Swedish cities. The event was planned by Rasmus Paludan, leader of the Danish right-wing party Stram Kurs, as part of his anti-Islam and immigration campaign across Nordic countries. This quickly escalated into violent riots including RWE/VRWE members setting police cars on fire and throwing Molotov cocktails, as well as other hard objects. The riots lasted more than 4 days and resulted in 20 destroyed police cars and more than 40 injured police and civilians. Such violent anti-Islam riots were not a new incident solely sparked by the increased fears of Afghan refugees; similar riots and Qur’an incendiary incidents occurred in 2020 in Sweden and were also planned in other EUMS including Belgium and Denmark. These types of riots continue to gain traction among a growing number of civilians as Paludan and other RWE and VRWE actors continue to exploit crises like Afghanistan to spread xenophobic and racist rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the level of impact was modest and short lived, for the reasons discussed above. One should, of course, consider that there are still large numbers of Afghans trapped in Iran and Turkey and that a migratory flow cannot be ruled out in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;25-far-left-narratives&quot;&gt;2.5. FAR-LEFT NARRATIVES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison to the RWE spectrum, the reactions to the Taliban takeover have been very muted on the far left of the spectrum. In Italy, within the anarco-insurrectionist left, there has been some celebration of “the great enemy” being defeated in Afghanistan. Overall, the impact on the far left has been negligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;31-redirection-and-disruption-vs-recruitment&quot;&gt;3.1. REDIRECTION AND DISRUPTION VS. RECRUITMENT&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in section 2, there has not been a significant direct impact from the Taliban takeover in Kabul on Europe’s jihadism. The Taliban have no interest in Europe and AQ has also made no effort to exploit the Taliban takeover narrative for its European activities – as far as it has been possible to verify. There is, of course, a wide area of jihadist activity – private chats on WhatsApp, Telegram, and other apps, which are hard to monitor. Community chats are vulnerable to jihadist infiltration and jihadist networks and sympathisers stay in touch via their own chats. Whether any specific impact from the Taliban takeover is visible there is not clear. As noted in section 2.2, non-violent extremists and ultra-conservatives within the various Muslim communities in Europe seem to feel emboldened when stating their views in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The know-how to infiltrate, disrupt and redirect jihadist recruitment efforts on social media and private chats exists, but due to the high-level of monitoring of social media activities in Europe, jihadist groups are especially careful. The November 2019 crackdown on Telegram accounts linked to jihadism and particularly to Da’esh had a short-to medium-term impact, but their members readapted and started using other communication channels. Due to a new regulation on the dissemination of terrorist content online, which entered into application on 7 June 2022, EU Member States can now send removal orders to hosting service providers on terrorist content they have identified. Hosting service providers are obliged to remove the content within one hour after the reception of the removal order. At the same time the Regulation has strong safeguards in place to protect fundamental freedoms, including through the requirement for robust complaint mechanisms, right to redress and obligations on transparency reporting on removals and specific measures. In addition, the Regulation exempts journalistic or educational content. Nonetheless, there are still some grey areas, as Meta’s terms of use for WhatsApp and Facebook, which discourage automated extraction of content by monitoring organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RWE’s fascination with the Taliban as such was short-lived, however the latter’s takeover has had at least one long-term impact: the tendency of RWE and VRWE groups to adopt the propaganda style and imagery of the jihadists, which had started even before the fall of Kabul, has been reinforced. The jihadists provided a ready template. RWE and VRWE’s see the style of the jihadists as well tailored to appeal to the angry youth it is targeting. An apt counter-narrative will have to take this into account and offer the angry youth something that fulfils their need for respect and empowerment. Appealing to moderation, rationality, open-mindedness, tolerance, and liberal values is not going to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of any future development, Taliban, AQ or Da’esh, RWE and VRWE groups have already learned useful lessons and have incorporated new techniques in their arsenal of propaganda resources. At least for groups that seem intent on moving towards actual terrorist activities, the next target is to create an “influencers’ army” large enough to enable spreading the message faster and wider through private channels, relatively protected from scrutiny. Rather than strategic communications specifically dealing with the Taliban takeover, what will be needed is intensified monitoring of online activity and a more attractive alternative narrative, capable of influencing the typical recruitment targets of RWEs. EUROPOL has already received extended powers to shut down channels used by extremists, but vis-à-vis RWE its activities are hampered by the reluctance of the authorities of member states to prescribe RWE groups (a precondition for targeting them online). A typical example is the group known as The Base, which is banned in the USA, but not in Europe. It is probably also wise to consider the possibility that counter-narratives are already “too little, too late” and have a track record of failure and that more substantial action might have to be undertaken, such as social programmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current relatively quietist approach to Europe by jihadist groups (that is the low level of terrorist violence and lack of direct efforts to generate it) might well be due to a focus on fundraising, or on recruitment for mainly non-combat roles. It is worth bearing in mind that there have been convictions in the UK of people sending money to imprisoned Da’esh members. Fundraising is a common feature of private social media channels, such as those organised around local mosques, and infiltration by extremists is possible, even if such infiltration is not (well) documented yet there is enough loose evidence to back such speculations. Some observers point to an increase in fundraising in the wake of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent to which this fundraising is successful is not clear, but it is worth considering whether a campaign addressing the hijacking of causes by crypto-Da’esh groups would yield sufficient benefits. A campaign of this type could potentially be run via community organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;32-face-to-face-training-mentoring-and-community-work&quot;&gt;3.2. FACE-TO-FACE TRAINING, MENTORING, AND COMMUNITY WORK&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the European context, a community-based approach appears more promising than one focused on counter-narratives, even if the obstacles should not be underestimated. There are now numerous consolidated Salafi communities around Europe, which appear keen to keep state influence away from their neighbourhoods. This potentially represents the first layer of a milieu community where jihadist groups could find it easier to shelter from scrutiny. Communities and groups influenced by the Muslim Brothers can also represent milieus of this type, hard to penetrate and / or collaborate with for the European states. In a sense, the attitude of some Muslim associations in the wake of the fall of Kabul is an indicator of this trend and of how the Taliban takeover reinforced it, further legitimising regimes and movements which are at odds with the values heralded by the EU. Friction between EUMS authorities and some of the Muslim community associations (specifically those linked to political Islam and to Salafism) over the latter’s support for social ultra-conservatism in regimes like the Taliban’s, makes collaboration between the two sides against violent jihadism even harder. The age-old question asked many times over, remains unanswered: is there a political and social space for collaborating against violence with non-violent ultra-conservatives and even non-violent extremists?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is therefore unclear what type of mentoring or community work could have a positive impact in these communities, research and investigation are going to be needed for identifying avenues of intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same strategy of routing strategic communications through communities is not really applicable when the target is the RWE spectrum. However, as hinted in section 3.1 directly above, social programmes aimed at “at-risk individuals” might be more appropriate, keeping in mind their likely profiles. Here too, specific programmes would have to be developed ad hoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;section-4-the-potential-for-indirect-pcve-impact-through-foreign--aid-policies&quot;&gt;SECTION 4: THE POTENTIAL FOR INDIRECT P/CVE IMPACT THROUGH FOREIGN &amp;amp; AID POLICIES&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effective strategic communications approach, aimed at mitigating the impact of the Taliban’s takeover, should be based on an understanding of what would look like success in the eyes of disgruntled audiences in Europe. What type of outcome in Afghanistan would have the strongest radicalising impact?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;41-a-vulnerable-narrative-of-exceptionalism&quot;&gt;4.1. A VULNERABLE NARRATIVE OF EXCEPTIONALISM&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there has so far been little direct impact from the fall of Kabul in terms of changes to the narratives of jihadist groups, strategic communications would be better framed in preventive terms. It would help normalise the rhetoric around the Emirate as a struggling new regime among many and take away any auras of exceptionalism since their takeover of Kabul. It should also be considered that the Taliban takeover might not be the last jihadist success that Europe will witness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of the Taliban takeover was not as dramatic as many purported it to be, partially because the Taliban are more interested in seeking legitimacy in Afghanistan than in furthering the cause of global jihad. Also because of a strong alternative narrative deployed by Da’esh, and in part because AQ itself has serious doubts about the Taliban’s intent and wants to minimise the damage deriving from a likely future spat. AQ supporters have already criticised the Taliban’s drive for legitimacy and regional integration, while the Taliban’s Deobandi-style internal policies are seen as rather old fashioned by the AQ intelligentsia, which leans towards the more extreme tendencies of the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU member policies aimed at encouraging the Taliban’s pursuit of international legitimacy have hit hurdles, in particular the inability of the Taliban to reach a consensus on girls’ education, and in general, their ultraconservative internal policies. However, if ultimately successful, it might well be the best way to undermine any appeal Afghanistan might have among jihadists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As regime change in Afghanistan loses its immediate resonance and fades into history, any risk of the Emirate becoming a model for extremist groups is likely to be linked to a possible radicalisation of the Emirate as a result of internal power struggles, for example. A radicalised Emirate, more appealing to Salafism, might find wider audiences even in Europe. AQ appears to have been betting on this, however they have been facing an uphill struggle. As mentioned above, AQ media houses have already shown a preference for propaganda from the Haqqani network, which highlights where their preferences lay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible, however, to conceive strategic communications policies that would undermine the Emirate as a model to follow, effectively normalising it as yet another post-conflict country facing massive social and economic problems. There is already awareness of the difficult conditions in Afghanistan within jihadist circles and so far, there has been little enthusiasm for moving there. Paradoxically, the media, by focusing on the exceptional features of the Emirate (women’s rights, vice and virtue police…) could make it more appealing to radicalised individuals, whose instinct is to identify with outliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The isolation of the Emirate is seen by jihadist sympathisers as one of its virtues, not as a weakness. A puritan, pure, self-righteous state is the evolutionary line of the Emirate that they would prefer. To the extent that international engagement takes place, it is mostly hidden from public view. This plays into the narrative of isolationism and independence that some AQ-linked commentators keep pushing. An effective strategic communications intervention would be to highlight how keen the Emirate is to engage and integrate into the global world order, and how small but steady progress is being made on that front. Stressing the dependency of the Emirate on humanitarian aid would also serve the strategic purpose of demythologising it, turning it into a “normal” post-conflict country. Whilst a strong overarching narrative could be deployed via mainstream media, for the desired strategic effect of preventing radicalisation, useful interventions could also be worked out with Muslim community representatives in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RWE and VRWE scenes have already long moved on from the fall of Kabul as such. They were never seriously bound to the Taliban’s success and their attitude towards it was opportunistic: one more episode to exploit for propaganda purposes. The genuine interest of the RWE and VRWE scenes lie in the propaganda techniques of AQ and Da’esh – the Taliban have little to teach to RWE and VRWE groups in this regard. This interest predates the fall of Kabul but has been strengthening after this date. The point is therefore not the narrative, but the style and technique. For this reason, a response is harder to fathom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;42-infighting-among-jihadist-groups&quot;&gt;4.2. INFIGHTING AMONG JIHADIST GROUPS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the divisions and the differences within the Emirate and among Emirate and foreign jihadists could be another useful strategic communications approach, undermining the myth of a unified “jihadist movement”. Criticism of the Emirate, as discussed above, is not unheard of even while scanning the best-known outlets of pro-AQ propaganda, so it would be relatively easy to drive this message home. The narrative that dominates in the Western media, which presents a black and white image of the Emirate as a coherent “evil state” aligned with AQ, actually plays into the hands of AQ propagandists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media also downplays fighting between the Emirate and IS-K, tending to focus on IS-K’s attacks against civilians and minorities in isolation from its campaign against the Emirate. A counter-narrative highlighting the intensity of hatred and infighting among jihadist groups of different doctrinal and ideological orientation is likely to impact negatively on the image of jihadism as a whole. It is worth noting that AQ has always tried to avoid advertising its rivalry with Da’esh and in general, any dissent or friction with other jihadist groups, even at the price some of concessions to Da’esh, for example. Clearly, AQ’s leaders were of the view that intra-jihadist infighting was bad publicity and harmed the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, while jihadist infighting might weaken the appeal of jihadism as a whole, highlighting the Emirate’s efforts to seek international legitimacy risks playing into the hands of Da’esh narratives. Exposing how Da’esh’s primary effort in Afghanistan is fighting a rival jihadist organisation would therefore nicely complement a strategy such as the one discussed in section 4.1 above. Undermining Da’esh’s claim to representing the only defender of Salafi communities could also help undermine its fundraising efforts in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion--policy-recommendations&quot;&gt;CONCLUSION &amp;amp; POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very limited direct impact from the fall of Kabul on the narratives of jihadists and RWE and VRWE groups is clear, but it is also obvious that there has been an indirect impact that is worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RWE and VRWE’s concern with Afghanistan and the Taliban per se has been very short lived, but the lessons that they have drawn are not. The RWE and VRWE scene has been reconfirmed in its assessment that it has much to learn from the propaganda techniques of global jihadists, even if the link between the Taliban’s victory and the global jihadist is rather tenuous. Some RWE and VRWE groups appear to have concluded that “who dares, wins” and that being bold will intimidate their enemies, enabling an impact out of all proportion to their actual strength, especially when dealing with what they now perceive even more strongly to be weak and irresolute European governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no-one among the jihadists has really tried to exploit the Taliban’s victory for re-launching jihadism in Europe, the Khorasan branch of Da’esh has intensified its propaganda operations, including in English. This appears to be in reaction to its fear of Taliban rivals gaining the upper hand but might impact Europe as well, as it tries to boost its propaganda army among the various Muslim diasporas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is too early to say whether ultra-conservative Muslims and passive sympathisers of jihadism in Europe will feel encouraged to express their views more openly in the medium and long term as a result of the Taliban take-over. It seems unclear whether this will depend on how events evolve in Afghanistan and the fate of the Emirate: internal strife, Taliban infighting, friction between Taliban and AQ are all going to detract from the prestige of the regime, which never inspired high levels of open support. Should the Emirate consolidate, its very persistence to exist might encourage a more assertive posturing by ultra-conservative groups, even if there are already many models of ultra-conservative, illiberal states for Muslims to admire in the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no need for a P/CVE counter-narrative for audiences vulnerable to the call of jihadism, specifically targeted at filling the gap opened by the fall of Kabul, because the gap was small and might already be in the process of self-healing. This is especially likely to be the case if foreign and aid policies are expertly mixed to prevent the image of the Emirate from ever becoming a rallying point for Islamic radicals. Continued monitoring of jihadist propaganda on social media is required however, and any gaps in coverage, such as the one identified above concerning WhatsApp, should be filled. It should be kept in mind that, although for very specific reasons the fall of Kabul had a limited impact, there may well be other instances of jihadist movements coming to power in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emirate’s ultra-conservative policies will add little to the practices of countries such as Saudi Arabia – where it differs, it attracts little support – even sympathisers in Europe are critical of the closure of high schools for girls, for example. The more extreme elements are not likely to see the Emirate as a model attractive to them, because within the European context such elements are mostly Salafis or Salafi-leaning and / or attracted by the Islamic State. This could change only in the event of a radicalisation of the Emirate, with a more confrontational approach towards foreign governments and a closer cooperation with global jihadist groups. At the moment, the typical (mostly mild) admirers of the Emirate are socially conservative and tendentially illiberal Muslim, typically leaning towards the Muslim Brotherhood and sometimes towards Erdogan. This highlights the need to resolve the long-standing debate in Europe on the approach to be taken towards non-violent extremists – seek their cooperation or isolate them? While the issue has proven to be deeply divisive in the past, it needs to be addressed one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing P/CVE communication strategies should consider whether infighting and friction between Taliban and various jihadist groups should be used to show individuals at risk of radicalisation that jihadist movements do not lead to some kind of millenarian outcome, but merely to another change in elite in an unstable country. The very propaganda campaign of Da’esh vs. the Taliban lends itself to this argument: if even the Taliban, who fought for so long and sacrificed so many lives, are accused of trying to sell out… In this sense the fall of Kabul might end up offering more opportunities than risks, especially if the Taliban were to accelerate down the road of accommodation with other countries. Strategic communications highlighting the Taliban’s requests for assistance and intra-jihadist violence and power struggles (not only in Afghanistan, but also in Syria, Nigeria, etc.) could easily be developed and deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since even RWE audiences were only temporarily attracted towards the clamour produced by the Afghan debacle, an ad-hoc counter-narrative makes little sense here too. RWE and VRWE propaganda has absorbed themes and techniques from jihadism and increasingly so during the year that followed the fall of Kabul, so what emerges is the issue of matching their propaganda techniques with increasingly effective counter-narrative techniques (as opposed to new, Afghan-specific content). Responding to their new techniques is in fact harder to do than in the case of jihadism. Having been appropriated by the RWE spectrum, they will remain in use even if the Taliban and other jihadists were to no longer be seen as some kind of “models”. Preventing RWE and VRWE individuals and groups from deploying their propaganda far and wide will require speedier procedures for listing extremist organisations and greater capacity for countering day by day operations. Undermining the appeal of RWE and VRWE narratives and groups will likely require much more than strategic communications, such as social programmes based on the analysis of the root causes of their success in recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;

It provides a detailed analysis of the war’s potential strategic impacts in three different ways.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;First, how the fighting between Russia and the Ukraine might proceed or end, and the potential real-world outcomes of any settlement. Second, the war’s lasting impact on the confrontation between Russia, NATO, and the West. And finally, its global impact, including its impact on Russian and Chinese relations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-strategic-impact-of-the-probable-outcomes-of-the-war-on-the-ukraine-and-russia&quot;&gt;The Strategic Impact of the Probable Outcomes of the War on the Ukraine and Russia&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In broad terms, it concludes that the attempt of Yevgeny Prigozhin to use his Wagner forces to move on Moscow provides yet another warning that the course of the war can suddenly change in unpredictable ways because of the decisions of a single individual, a given military offensive, or shifts in the level of outside support by other nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there is a significant possibility that the fighting in Ukraine will go on for years, that it will unleash broader forces that will make any settlement or “peace” highly unstable, and that the war will lead to a new and lasting form of Cold War between the West and Russia, as well as have broader global impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It already seems all too likely that any form of conflict termination, and an apparent end to the fighting, will create an enduring level of political confrontation and arms race between Ukraine and Russia in a war that will last as long as anyone like Putin is in power and as Ukraine has strong independent leadership. Any formal end to the fighting may also end in the kind of settlement that leads to recurrent violent incidents and an ongoing political and economic struggle as Ukraine seeks to rebuild and establish ties to NATO, while Russia and Ukraine remain hostile in every way short of ongoing fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-strategic-impact-on-the-broader-confrontation-between-russia-and-the-west&quot;&gt;The Strategic Impact on the Broader Confrontation between Russia and the West&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems equally likely that any form of conflict termination between Ukraine and Russia will leave NATO and the West engaged in a broader form of a new Cold War and engaged in a broader and enduring regional arms race that has major political and economic dimensions. It is already clear that it is likely to involve a nuclear as well as conventional arms race and that one changes the current nature of nuclear deterrence and how any actual use of nuclear weapons is likely to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s future internal stability may depend heavily on the degree to which Putin can at least claim some kind of victory and on whether Russia can develop more unified and effective military and security forces and eliminate rivals like its Wagner mercenaries. In practice, this means holding on to all the territory it seized in 2014 and probably a significant part of the territory Russia has been able to seize in Eastern Ukraine. Moreover, Russia will need to substantially rebuild, modernize, and expand its military capabilities to recover its prewar status as a major power, although it also has the option of shifting to a greater reliance on nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, much of the future stability of Europe and the success of extended deterrence in the West will depend on how well the different members of NATO are able to create and maintain more effective forms of deterrence and warfighting capability. So far, most NATO countries have pledged to spend more and make major improvements in modernization and readiness. It is not yet clear, however, that all of these plans will be implemented or how well NATO can achieve more effective levels of interoperability and integrated force planning and tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NATO leaders have also talked about making Ukraine part of NATO, but it is unclear how much support Ukraine will actually receive from the United States and European states in actually establishing stronger ties to NATO and the European Union. The same is true of the levels of aid Ukraine will receive in the future. Both Slovakia and Hungary have only shown limited support of Ukraine since the start of the war, and Turkey has drifted towards closer relations with Russia for other reasons. The polls that show a lack of support for the added NATO military spending also show a decline in support for aid to Ukraine, and many NATO countries, including the United States and key countries like Germany, have growing “right-wing” political elements that do not support aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-global-strategic-impact&quot;&gt;The Global Strategic Impact&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tensions and power struggles will affect the rest of the world as well. Putin has repeatedly stated that Russia will seek to decouple its economy from its dependence on Europe, the West, and its “rules-based” system. He has indicated that Russia will seek to create new economic and strategic ties to China and other non-Western states and try to expand its influence outside Europe and in the rest of the world to increase Russian influence relative to the United States and its strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of Putin’s goals are almost certainly unrealistic, but they do make it likely that the confrontation between Russia and the West will continue to grow at a global level even if some kind of ceasefire or settlement is reached between Ukraine and Russia. This will be particularly apparent in the case of China. The new Cold War and arms race between Russia and the West will increasingly be linked to the political tensions, economic confrontation, and arms race between China and the United States and its strategic allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quantifying-current-trends&quot;&gt;Quantifying Current Trends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way to predict the exact forms that each of these three ongoing levels of struggle will take. There are too many major uncertainties in each case, and much of the data that can be used to assess the forces that may shape events are conflicting or uncertain. This analysis does, however, highlight many of the quantitative trends shaping these outcomes. It examines more probable ways the fighting between Ukraine and Russia might develop, how it might impact the broader regional confrontation between Russia and the West, and how it might impact broader global struggles between Russia, China, and the rest of the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It explores the key data and trends that are available on each of these three levels of competition and potential conflict and provides quantitative analyses of the trends where possible. It also describes key uncertainties, how the war in Ukraine is influencing the broader trends in Western and Russian conventional and nuclear forces, and the level of global economic and military competition between the major powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-fighting-between-russia-and-ukraine-predicting-the-unpredictable&quot;&gt;The Fighting between Russia and Ukraine: Predicting the Unpredictable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There currently is no way to predict the outcome of the current fighting in Ukraine, or its broader impact on European security and global competition with Russia and China for even a year, much less a decade or more. As the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in June 2023 has shown, there can be sudden surprises in the ongoing conflict within Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one predicted that near record rains and mud would delay a possible Ukrainian spring offensive earlier in 2023. No one predicted that Russia’s Wagner forces would advance on Moscow in June 2023 and then suddenly halt. As of the summer of 2023, there is no way to know how the fighting will play out during the rest of the year. There also is no historical basis for predicting how long the fighting will last, and whether or when some form of conflict termination will occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the war in Ukraine has become a war of attrition where neither side seems to have a decisive advantage, and where both sides have the resources and strong political and strategic reasons to keep fighting. They have established strong forward defenses including networks of trenches, hard points, and minefields, and defenses in depth backed by artillery, armor, drones, missiles, airpower, and air and missile defenses. The result could be a war that lasts for several more years unless major shifts take place in Russia’s leadership or the West ceases to provide the aid Ukraine needs to continue fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, military history warns that many wars of attrition have suddenly ended with the catalytic collapse of one side in ways that few, if any, predicted in advance. World War I and the Afghan War are just a few examples of the fact that such fighting can suddenly end because of the near exhaustion of one side. In both cases, this sudden end to a war of attrition was not widely predicted, although its possibility was clearly increasing, and any study of military history should have warned both sides that the probability of the sudden collapse of a given side was increasing with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;peace-is-the-preface-to-new-wars&quot;&gt;Peace Is the Preface to New Wars&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, history warns that conflict termination and peace agreements often do not mean an end to war. The Vietnam and Afghan wars are all too recent examples of the fact that a focus on winning battles and having some kind of peace negotiations or conflict termination agreement do not define either a victory or a real peace in grand strategic terms. One of the most serious and continuing failures in both political and military strategy is to focus on defeating the enemy or the immediate process of conflict termination without considering how to achieve lasting peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many wars have not ended even though the formal fighting ceased or some kind of ceasefire or peace agreement led to a pause in the fighting. Many supposed peace agreements have triggered much broader and lasting patterns of regional and global conflict. The rise of the Spanish, Swedish, British, and Franc empires each led to series of interconnect wars, rather than peace. In retrospect, the democratic upheavals in France that overthrew the monarchy had much the same result as the Arab spring. They led to a series of Napoleonic Wars that began in 1808 and ended in June 1815.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Battle of Waterloos then led to an apparent lasting peace in Europe that actually involved a host of smaller conflicts that proved to be the preface to another period of “peace” that ended with the Franco-German war of 1870, and another peace that then became the preface to World War I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wars can also escalate in unpredictable ways. No one planned for an assassination in Sarajevo to escalate into a World War, or for the German defeat of Russia in 1917, and a seemingly successful German offensive in the West in 1918, to exhaust and defeat Germany that same year. The seeming end to World War I, peace of Versailles, and creation of the League of Nations became the preface to years of tension and then to World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allied victory in World War II then led to a Cold War between the West and Soviet Union that began before World War II even ended. The Cold War then suddenly and unexpectedly ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact in 1991. However, something close to the same power struggle reemerged when Russian invaded of the Crimea in 2014 and reached region-wide intensity when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 14, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arab-Israeli conflicts led to four major wars (1948, 1956, 1967, and 1973), and the peace efforts after each war have still failed to create peace between Israel and the Palestinians after more than 70 years of conflict. The Congo, Somalia, and Sudan have all been the scene of repeated wars in Africa. North and South Korea fought from 1950-1953, still only have ceasefires punctuated by low-level clashes, and are involved in both a conventional arms race and nuclear proliferation. The Paris Accords in Vietnam were the preface to U.S. withdrawal but scarcely ended the fighting and turned the South’s supposed “victory” into a total and lasting defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iran and Iraq fought a massive war from 1980-1988 that only ended in a ceasefire and has led to repeated low level Iranian military interventions in Iraq ever since 2003. The First Gulf War to liberate Kuwait in 1990-1991 was the preface to a full-scale U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and then two more wars for control of Iraq and fighting that still continues in Eastern Syria. Afghanistan was first the scene of civil war, then a Russia invasion, a civil war for control of Kabul, a new war between the Taliban and the Afghan Northern Alliance, and a major war involving a U.S. led coalition from 2001 to 2021. It is now the scene of clashed between the Taliban and its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The independence of Taiwan after the end of a Chinese civil war that began in the early 1930s has led to a continuing arms race and a new conflict between China and Taiwan ever since 1949 — a period three quarters of a century long. Peace in Vietnam was the preface to a new major conflict, and so was the apparent U.S. victory over the Taliban in 2001-2002. If one includes the history of civil conflicts over the last two centuries, and in post-colonial states since 1945, it is all too clear that “conflict termination,” and peace agreements are s almost as likely to lead to some form continuing arms race and new outbreaks of renewed fighting and violence as they are to lasting peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-lasting-impact-of-fighting-between-russia-and-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Lasting Impact of Fighting between Russia and Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern of conflict termination without real peace, and the equivalent of a whole series of a “peace to end all peace,” seems all too likely to be repeated in the case of Ukraine. In fact, the war evolved into an unexpectedly long conflict during the first weeks of the fighting. Russia originally estimated that it could build-up its forces in Russia near Ukraine and in Belarus, in ways that would allow them to win decisive battles before Ukraine and outside states could react effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia estimated that it could repeat its successes in the Crimea in 2014, rapidly seize Ukraine without a major conflict, and take control of the country in a week to ten days. massively miscalculated the capability of its own forces, the ability of Britain and the United States to provide strategic warning, Ukraine’s will and ability to resist, and the reaction of other NATO states, and the rest of the world. Russia’s war plan and efforts to execute it proved to be massive grand strategic failures in virtually every respect and conflict termination never became an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-days-of-sudden-victory-to-years-of-a-war-of-attrition&quot;&gt;From Days of Sudden Victory to Years of a War of Attrition?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, the war led to a successful Ukrainian defense of most of its territory within days of a massive Russian attack, then led to successful if limited Ukrainian counterattacks, and created the current war of attrition. Ukraine halted the Russian attack and then carried out successful counterattacks from August to December 2022, inflicting major losses on Russia’s Special Forces and other elite troops. By the winter of 2022, the war became a largely static ground war fought for urban areas in the Eastern Ukraine and along key water barriers and routes of communication by June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case with most wars, tactics and technology quickly evolved in unpredictable ways. The most striking changes in the battlefield were the increasing use of the full spectrum of precision guided weapons, missiles, and UCAVs or drones; the deployment of advanced air and missile defense systems, the creation of major chains of military supply and training support of Ukraine, followed by the creation of a network of fixed defenses like shelters and trenches, other fixed defenses, and use of natural barriers — including water barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By May 2023, Satellite photos showed something approaching a World War I set of trenches along the entire line of battle, although both sides were fighting with modern conventional weapons, mobile armor and combat engineering equipment, and advanced battle management, combat air and air defense, and intelligence systems. It had become a war where artillery and light precision guided weapons dominate ground combat, and where missiles and drones target military forces, political and population centers, and infrastructure targets in the rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine did begin a new series of offensives in June 2023, but it is far from clear at this writing that these can achieve major strategic results. If anything, their lack of major progress at the timing this analysis is written raises the possibility that both sides will continue to improve their military capability, that new longer-rage weapons and strikes will be employed, and the results will be a war of attrition that did not lead to any clear outcome and continued for at least another year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, it is the political stability and economic resources of each side that may determine the outcome. The sudden advance of Wagner forces under the leadership of Yevgeny Prigozhin in June 2023 has raised serious questions about Putin’s level of control and future in Russia, and the quality and competence of Russia’s regular military leadership. He also has challenged the very need for the war: Prigozhin’s statement ending his advance on Moscow came weeks after he called Russia’s senior military leaders “traitors,” and urged Putin to declare that the goals of what Moscow calls its “special military operation in Ukraine” had been achieved and to stop the fighting, and stated that “many of those who yesterday supported the special operation, today either have doubts or are categorically opposed to what is happening.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it is dangerous to rush to any view of these events that indicates such upheavals will threaten Putin’s position. Such events are more the rule in authoritarian regimes than the exception. Hitler carried out a massive purge his security forces called the night of “long knives.” He had their leader, Ernst Rohm killed and dissolved the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Nazis’ paramilitary organization, or “Brownshirts” in 1934. He then survived a major assassination attempt by his own senior military on July 20, 1944.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalin conducted a long series of purges of his military in the 1930s, and the great purge of 1937. He too survived, but his continuing distrust of his military and senior officials led him to ignore some 80 warnings before Germany invaded Russia in June 1941 — including warnings from Winston Churchill, his own military and intelligence circles, and a “red orchestra with contacts within the Nazi military planning staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;russia-and-ukraine-a-peace-that-will-end-in-pieces&quot;&gt;Russia and Ukraine: A Peace That Will End in Pieces?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has imposed serious strains and casualties on both Russia and Ukraine. So far, however, there have been no clear signs that either Russia or Ukraine is willing to negotiate on terms acceptable to the other. Both President Putin of Russia, and President Zelensky of Ukraine, have failed to suggest terms for ending the fighting that the other side seems willing to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;putins-view-of-a-russian-settlement-with-ukraine&quot;&gt;Putin’s View of a Russian Settlement with Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent that there has been expert speculation about a Russian willingness to accept some form of compromise, it has focused on Putin’s need to claim some kind of victory in keeping portions of the territory in Ukraine it has already captured. Such a settlement would mean Putin would be able to retain most of Russia’s gains in the Eastern Ukraine at the time of any settlement, and all the territory in the Crimea that it seized in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, however, President Putin has taken the position that Ukraine is not a legitimate state, has a government with a Nazi character, and occupies territory that is legitimately Russian. Putin provided the following justification for the war, and for the de facto annexation of Ukraine, in his state of the union speech on February 21, 2022, although he did touch upon the fact that Russia had already annexed two provinces in ways that might provide an opening for a settlement based upon a more limited set of Russian gains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those who embarked on the path of violence, bloodshed, lawlessness did not recognize and do not recognize any other solution to the Donbass issue, except for the military one. In this regard, I consider it necessary to take a long overdue decision to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic. I ask the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation to support this decision, and then to ratify the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with individual republics. These two documents will be prepared and signed in the very near future. And from those who seized and hold power in Kyiv, we demand an immediate cessation of hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… Otherwise, all responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine. Announcing the decisions taken today, I am confident in the support of the citizens of Russia. Of all the patriotic forces of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… Modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia, more precisely, Bolshevik, communist Russia. This process began immediately after the revolution of 1917… As a result of Bolshevik policy, Soviet Ukraine arose, which even today can with good reason be called “Vladimir Ilyich Lenin’s Ukraine”. He is its author and architect. This is fully confirmed by archive documents… And now grateful descendants have demolished monuments to Lenin in Ukraine. This is what they call decommunization. Do you want decommunization? Well, that suits us just fine. But it is unnecessary, as they say, to stop halfway. We are ready to show you what real decommunization means for Ukraine…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ukraine never had a tradition of genuine statehood… Russia assumed obligations to repay the entire Soviet debt in return for the newly independent states giving up part of their foreign assets. In 1994, such agreements were reached with Ukraine, but they were not ratified by Ukraine…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… (Ukraine) preferred to act in such a way that in relations with Russia they had all the rights and advantages but did not bear any obligations… “From the very first steps they began to build their statehood on the denial of everything that unites us. They tried to distort the consciousness, the historical memory of millions of people, entire generations living in Ukraine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin was equally uncompromising in his state of the Union speech in February 2023, a year later, although he did limit his specific calls for annexation to the Donbass:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One year ago, to protect the people in our historical lands, to ensure the security of our country and to eliminate the threat coming from the neo-Nazi regime that had taken hold in Ukraine after the 2014 coup, it was decided to begin the special military operation. Step by step, carefully and consistently we will deal with the tasks we have at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since 2014, Donbass has been fighting for the right to live in their land and to speak their native tongue. It fought and never gave up amid the blockade, constant shelling, and the Kiev regime’s overt hatred. It hoped and waited that Russia would come to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, as you know well, we were doing everything in our power to solve this problem by peaceful means, and patiently conducted talks on a peaceful solution to this devastating conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Behind our backs, a very different plan was being hatched. As we can see now, the promises of Western leaders, their assurances that they were striving for peace in Donbass turned out to be a sham and outright lies. They were simply marking time, engaged in political chicanery, turning a blind eye to the Kiev regime’s political assassinations and reprisals against undesirable people, their mistreatment of believers. They increasingly incited the Ukrainian neo-Nazis to stage terrorist attacks in Donbass. The officers of nationalist battalions trained at Western academies and schools. Weapons were also supplied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would like to emphasize that, prior to the special military operation, Kiev held negotiations with the West about the delivery of air-defense systems, war planes and other heavy equipment to Ukraine. We also recall the Kiev regime’s vain attempts to obtain nuclear weapons; they discussed this issue publicly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The United States and NATO quickly deployed their army bases and secret biological laboratories near Russian borders. They mastered the future theatre of war during war games, and they prepared the Kiev regime which they controlled and Ukraine which they had enslaved for a large-scale war…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were open and sincerely ready for a constructive dialogue with the West; we said and insisted that both Europe and the whole world needed an indivisible security system equal for all countries, and for many years we suggested that our partners discuss this idea together and work on its implementation. But in response, we received either an indistinct or hypocritical reaction, as far as words were concerned. But there were also actions: NATO’s expansion to our borders, the creation of new deployment areas for missile defence in Europe and Asia — they decided to take cover from us under an “umbrella” — deployment of military contingents, and not just near Russia’s borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would like to recall that, in the 1930s, the West had virtually paved the way to power for the Nazis in Germany. In our time, they started turning Ukraine into an “anti-Russia.” Actually, this project is not new. People who are knowledgeable about history at least to some extent realize that this project dates back to the 19th century. The Austro-Hungarian Empire and Poland had conceived it for one purpose, that is, to deprive Russia of these historical territories that are now called Ukraine. This is their goal. There is nothing new here; they are repeating everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The West expedited the implementation of this project today by supporting the 2014 coup. That was a bloody, anti-state and unconstitutional coup. They pretended that nothing happened, and that this is how things should be. They even said how much money they had spent on it. Russophobia and extremely aggressive nationalism formed its ideological foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… I am proud, and I think we are all proud that our multi-ethnic nation, the absolute majority of our citizens, have taken a principled stance on the special military operation. They understand the basic idea of what we are doing and support our actions on the defence of Donbass. This support primarily revealed their true patriotism — a feeling that is historically inherent in our nation. It is stunning in its dignity and deep understanding by everyone — I will stress, everyone — of the inseparable link between one’s own destiny and the destiny of the Fatherland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of rhetoric does not mean that Putin will not eventually be willing to compromise in settling with Ukraine if he feels that this is necessary to end a war of attrition that has come to threaten his internal political support and Russia’s stability, or that such a settlement will limit NATO and the West’s effort to rebuild a Ukraine that has effective warfighting capabilities, that can truly achieve a convincing level of conventional and nuclear “extended deterrence.” As the following analyses show, Putin must also realize that he faces massive limits on his to decouple Russia’s economy from the West and its “rules-based order.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Yevgeny Prigozhin use of his Wagner forces in his attempt to advance on Moscow in June 2023 has shown, the strains imposed by the fighting already affect Russia as well as Ukraine. The apparent stability of regimes that engage in wars of attrition often only last until it doesn’t — although the following analysis shows that Ukraine is under great stress as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scarcely means, however, that he or any similar successor would fully accept Ukraine’s independence, return the lost territory in the Crimea or Donbass, or fail to insist on annexing the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic. It also does not mean that Russia would not persist in building up its military forces around Ukraine, conducting political or economic warfare, or accepting any form of compromise as a lasting form of conflict resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;zelenskys-ten-point-peace-plan&quot;&gt;Zelensky’s Ten Point Peace Plan&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Zelensky has been more precise in setting peace terms, although his public statements may be more of a political act and initial basis for negotiation than firm demands. He presented a ten-point peace plan on of November 15, 2022, that called for major changes in the way Russia approaches its national security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first is radiation and nuclear safety…&lt;/strong&gt; Radiation safety must be restored. The IAEA has already provided respective recommendations, confirming all the risks that we have repeatedly raised. Therefore, Russia must immediately withdraw all its militants from the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The station must be immediately transferred to the control of the IAEA and the Ukrainian personnel. The normal connection of the station to the power grid must be restored immediately so that nothing threatens the stability of the reactors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We proposed that IAEA missions are sent to all Ukrainian nuclear plants — four of them, 15 nuclear units in total. Plus the Chornobyl plant, which has been shut down and is under conservation. Such missions can verify that any hostile activity against Ukrainian nuclear facilities has indeed ceased… How long does it take to implement it? Russia can begin the demilitarization of the Zaporizhzhia NPP as early as tomorrow if it is really ready to restore the radioactive safety it violated… The same goes for the crazy threats of nuclear weapons that Russian officials resort to. There are and cannot be any excuses for nuclear blackmail. And I thank you, dear G-19, for making this clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second challenge is food security…&lt;/strong&gt; The right to food is a fundamental right of every person in the world… I also… on all countries — and in particular your countries, dear G-19 leaders — to join our initiative to help the poorest with food… We have already launched the initiative — “Grain From Ukraine”. And the first vessel — Nord Vind — leaves for Ethiopia with 27 thousand tons of wheat on board… What do we propose exactly? Each country can join with a specific contribution and become a co-creator of the victory over hunger and the food crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The third is energy security…&lt;/strong&gt; All of you can witness what the Russian terror is aimed at now. This is an attempt to turn the cold into a weapon. A weapon against millions of people. About 40% of our energy infrastructure were destroyed by the strikes of Russian missiles and Iranian drones used by the occupiers. Every week, Russia blows up our power plants, transformers, and electricity supply lines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… We have already proposed that a mission of UN experts is sent to the objects of critical energy infrastructure of Ukraine to assess the scope of damage and the needs for restoration, as well as to prevent their further destruction. We need to speed up the dispatch of this mission! This will be a specific contribution of the international community to the stabilization of the energy situation in Ukraine and Europe, and therefore in the global energy market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, regardless of the decisions of the world, any day Russia on its own can simply abandon strikes on Ukrainian energy generation and water and heat supply facilities. Let Russia prove by its rejection of terror that it is really interested in the restoration of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We must also take a fundamental step so that energy resources are no longer used as weapons. Price restrictions on Russian energy resources should be introduced… If Russia is trying to deprive Ukraine, Europe and all energy consumers in the world of predictability and price stability, the answer to this should be a forced limitation of export prices for Russia. So that the export price was not higher than the production cost. That’s fair. If you take something away, the world has the right to take from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fourth challenge is the release of all prisoners and deportees…&lt;/strong&gt; Thousands of our people — military and civilians — are in the Russian captivity. They are subjected to brutal torture — this is mass abuse!… We cannot wait… Therefore, we must unite for the sake of the only realistic model of the release of prisoners — “all for all”… And also for the release of all children and adults who were deported to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fifth — implementation of the UN Charter and restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the world order…&lt;/strong&gt; Therefore, we must restore the validity of international law — and without any compromises with the aggressor. Because the UN Charter cannot be applied partially, selectively or “at will”… Russia must reaffirm the territorial integrity of Ukraine within the framework of the relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly and the applicable international legally binding documents… It is not up to negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sixth challenge is withdrawal of Russian troops and cessation of hostilities…&lt;/strong&gt; Russia must withdraw all its troops and armed formations from the territory of Ukraine. Ukraine’s control over all sections of our state border with Russia must be restored… This will result in a real and complete cessation of hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The seventh — justice…&lt;/strong&gt; Everywhere, when we liberate our land, we see one thing — Russia leaves behind torture chambers and mass burials of murdered people… That is why the world should endorse establishment of the Special Tribunal regarding the crime of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and the creation of an international mechanism to compensate for all the damages caused by this war. Compensation at the expense of Russian assets, because it is the aggressor who must do everything to restore the justice violated by it… We have already proposed a resolution of the UN General Assembly regarding an international compensation mechanism for damages caused by the Russian war. It is endorsed. We ask you to implement it… We are also preparing the second resolution — on the Special Tribunal. Please join and support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The eighth challenge is ecocide, the need for immediate protection of environment.&lt;/strong&gt; Millions of hectares of forest were burned by shelling… It is impossible to accurately calculate the amount of atmospheric pollution from burnt oil depots and other fires… 6 million domestic animals died. 6 million! These are official numbers. At least 50,000 dolphins were killed in the Black Sea. Thousands of hectares of soil are contaminated with harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;During the last week’s Climate Summit in Egypt, I proposed a platform to assess the environmental damage of war. We have to implement it… We must also find common responses to all environmental threats created by the war. Without this, there will be no return to a normal, stable life, and the reverberations of the war will remain for a long time — in the explosions of mines that will take the lives of children and adults, in the pollution of water, soil and atmosphere… Funds and technologies are also needed for the restoration of water treatment facilities… This is not just a Ukrainian problem. This is a challenge for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The next — the ninth — is the prevention of escalation…&lt;/strong&gt; A risk that still exists and will remain until our security is properly ensured… Ukraine is not a member of any of the alliances. And Russia was able to start this war precisely because Ukraine remained in the grey zone — between the Euro-Atlantic world and the Russian imperialism. Now we do not have any security assurances either. We need effective security assurances… That is why we prepared a draft agreement — the Kyiv Security Compact and have already presented it to partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the tenth — confirmation of the end of the war…&lt;/strong&gt; When all the antiwar measures are implemented, when security and justice begin to be restored, a document confirming the end of the war should be signed by the parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would like to emphasize that none of the steps above can take long. A month for one step at the most. For some steps, a couple of days are enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is striking that many of these ten demands are global in their impact, as well as ways of meeting Ukraine’s security needs.8 At the same time, they clearly call for a peace settlement that requires Russia to return all of the territory that it has seized since the present war began, for the return all of the territory in Ukraine that Russia seized in the Crimea in 2014, for the trial of Russians who committed war crimes, and for Russia to pay reparations for the full reconstruction of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelensky must realize that these demands are not negotiable even if Ukraine wins back all of the territory it has lost in the current fighting. They indicate that a vast gap exists currently between his views and those of Putin. This may explain why there are indications that the United States may have informally proposed to Zelensky that he should compromise to the extent of accepting some kind of settlement that would return all the territory that Russia has seized since the beginning of the current war, and without return of the Crimea and other areas it seized in 2014. It is doubtful that the United States believes Russia with pay reparations or accept war crimes trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-uncertain-prospects-for-a-stable-end-to-the-fighting-between-russia-and-ukraine&quot;&gt;The Uncertain Prospects for a Stable End to the Fighting Between Russia and Ukraine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much will depend on the course of the fighting in 2023, and during any months and years that follow. Both sides have already suffered high military casualties, suffered serious losses of military equipment, and face problems in upgrading their weapons and getting adequate stocks of munitions and supplies. Both face political and economic challenges. Russia because of the military, economic and internal political costs. Ukraine because of the same costs, and its growing dependence on outside aid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, both sides have improved their forces and warfighting capabilities. Russia has mobilized and retrained its forces and shown that it can fight effectively on the defensive. It continues to build-up its land defenses — with a network of trenches, mines, artillery, and drones. It also regularly launches missile and air attacks on the nearby population and infrastructure. The partial loss of Wagner forces may offset some of these gains in experience and warfighting capability, but it is also important to note that the main impact of the Wagner forces to win a strategically point fighting overt the virtually destroyed minor Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, and that regular Russian military forces were already fighting most of the Russian side of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia has also shown that it can target Ukraine’s economy and conduct a campaign of drone and missile strikes designed to exhaust its civil population and destroy its morale. It seems to have destroyed the Nova Kakhovka Dam on June 6, 2023. It has sporadically attacked the port of Odessa, has taken measures that could allow it to limit Ukraine’s grain exports, and continues to both attack in other ways that limit Ukraine’s ability to export grain and other agricultural products, that limit its industrial output, and limit its ability to provide electric power and safe water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Ukraine, it began limited new offensives in June 2023, and has conducted continuing covert and not-so-covert raids on Russian territory. It has steadily modernized every aspect of its military, including air, long range missiles and drones, artillery, tactical precision guided weapons, armor, C3I/battle management systems, logistics, and training. It has suffered from attrition, and foreign aid and supply have been somewhat slow and erratic in some areas like armor, modern air power, and long-range strike capability, but it still has far more capable forces than it did at the time when Russia invaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;everything-is-predictable-until-it-is-not&quot;&gt;Everything Is Predictable until It Is Not&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting mix of barriers and defense in depth, advances in weaponry, more experienced combat personnel on each side, has made the conflict steadily less predictable. The sudden destruction of the Kakhovka dam is only most dramatic example of the dangers in assuming that each side’s behavior is predictable, and months of Ukraine’s preparation for new offensives preparation may indicate the direction that combat will take. Like the earlier attack on the twin bridges bridge between the Taman Peninsula of Krasnodar Krai and the Kerch Peninsula of Crimea in October 2022, and the failure of Russian forces to act effectively to seize the Hostomel Airfield in preparing to attack Kyiv in the first morning of the war, the destruction of the dam everything is predictable until it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much will depend on how well each side does in combat in the coming months, as well as its economic strength and the flow of aid to Ukraine. In broad terms, however, Russia has rebuilt its forces and defenses to the point where it is unclear that they will be a vulnerable and as prone to serious retreats as they were in 2022. At the same time, Russia scarcely has shown that it is a well led and effective as a modern army. As for Ukraine, it is modernizing and building up its armor and modern combat aircraft, but relatively slowly and it faces constant attacks on its economy and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the classic measures of the military balance, the progress in both side’s forces to date indicates that Ukraine might well score gains in 2023, but Russia would have to be badly led and organized and/or the victim of surprise, to suffer major losses. This makes it is all too possible that the fighting will remain a war of attrition through the summer and fall, and that both sides will be become able to sustain something close to its present positions into the winter of 2023/2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this happens, both sides are likely to continue to build-up their static forward defenses, while seeking to expand their deep strike capabilities, and their use of economic and political warfare. This could produce a stalemate that extended beyond 2024, although casualties seem likely to remain high on both sides, and the political and information wars to become more bitter and intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-flow-of-aid-to-ukraine-and-the-state-of-the-russian-economy-are-critical-variables&quot;&gt;The Flow of Aid to Ukraine and the State of the Russian Economy Are Critical Variables&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has so far had higher morale and better military leadership and unity of effort. At the same time, Ukraine has suffered far more in civil and economic terms than Russia, and Ukraine may have less internal unity and economic capacity to ride out a longer war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, much will depend on Russia’s ability to limit the impact of Western and other economic sanctions, and on the continued flow and scale of aid to Ukraine. Russia currently seems to be able to survive the pressure of sanctions, other economic pressures, and Western political and information warfare. As the analysis in the following section shows, however, Russia is anything but an economic or industrial superpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative casualty levels are unclear, as is their impact on morale. What is clear is that Ukraine is steadily more dependent on the flow on Allied aid. Cumulative combat and civil damage to Ukraine has been far greater and Russia has suffered only limited civil damage. Ukraine’s overall economy is also far more fragile, and like the rise in military and civilian casualties, his will have a cumulative impact on morale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank warned in June 2023 that, “Ukraine’s GDP declined by 29.2 percent in 2022. Inflation stood at 26.6 percent at end-2022. Poverty increased from 5.5 percent to 24.2 percent in 2022, pushing 7.1 million more people into poverty and retracting 15 years of progress. Despite a localization of active combat, Ukraine’s economic outlook remains highly uncertain and is dependent on the duration of the war. GDP is expected to grow by only 0.5 percent in 2023.” This is a grim warning as to how much the situation can deteriorate in a year, and these date pre-date the major rise in Russian missile and attacks on civilian and infrastructure targets in the first half of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources like the CIA Factbook do not state any overall economic data for Ukraine’s economy after 2021, but the Factbook did warn in June 2023 that, “The invasion has also created Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II. As of 23 May 2023, approximately 21.92 million people had fled Ukraine, and 5.35 million people were internally displaced as of January 2023. More than 23,600 civilian casualties had been reported, as of 7 May 2023. The invasion of Ukraine remains one of the two largest displacement crises worldwide (the other is the conflict in Syria).” This means that more than half of the total population of 43.3 million had fled or been displaced as of January 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CIA also warned that, “planting of 2023 winter crops was completed by mid-November 2022 and crops are currently in winter dormancy phase; the area sown with wheat amounts to about 3.8 million hectares, well below the 6.5 million hectares planted in 2021; overall, the area sown with the 2023 winter cereal crops is estimated to be 40 percent below the average level…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will make Ukraine steadily more dependent on foreign aid, and the amounts of aid involved are already producing some political opposition with Europe and the United States. To put these levels of aid in perspective, an analysis issued by the Council on foreign relations in May 2023 indicated that the United States had sent $76.8 billion in aid to Ukraine as of January 24, 2023: $3.9 (5 percent) billion in humanitarian add, $26.4 (34 percent) billion in financial aid, $18.3 billion (24 percent) in security assistance aid, $23.5 (31 percent) billion in weapons and equipment aid, and $4.7 billion (6 percent) in grants and loans for weapons and equipment. If one totals the amount of aid the U.S. Congress had given and pledged, it totaled $113 billion as early as January 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other major donors had committed over $34 billion. The European Union had sent $35.3 billion, the UK over $9.3 billion, Germany some $7.4 billion, Japan $6.2 billion, the Netherlands close to $4.0 billion, Canada $3.8 billion, Poland $3.5 billion, Norway $2.4 billion, France over $1.7 billion, Sweden $1.4 billion, Italy over $1.0 billion, and Denmark closes to $1.0 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sums are scarcely crippling sums in terms of the overall government expenditures of each donor country or as a portion of their relative GDPs, but they are high levels of aid by international standards. At least two NATO countries — Hungary and Slovakia — have never fully supported aid or NATO support to Ukraine, and polls do show a drop in public support for such aid in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, many donor countries have already pledged future aid. NATO has held conferences that indicate that most of its members will support continued aid. Major donors like Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States pledged major new aid in June 2023, and Britain and the European Union have announced that they are investigating legal options to shift frozen Russian assets to Ukraine. These public and private Russian assets are estimated to be worth more than $300 billion, which could pay for a substantial part of Ukraine’s reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s increasing dependence does not mean that Ukraine will lose, or Russia will win. Quite aside from the Wagner debacle, Russia has made serious mistakes in organizing its military forces and in conducting major battles ever since the war began, and while it has suffered little combat damage to its population or economy, it has suffered serious casualties and sanctions, and other economic and political measures have affected its economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a guess — and predicting the outcome of this war is guesswork — both sides currently seem likely to be able to find the resources to fight on through at least 2023 and possibly 2024 and beyond. As yet, there are no clear signs that Russia or Ukraine will suffer from economic and political exhaustion unless it one suffers major military losses by making major mistakes in the way it uses its forces and intaking key strategic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longer the war of attrition lasts, however, the more the war will exhaust the military forces on both sides and do so in ways that increasingly put pressure on the leaders of both Russia and Ukraine to find some form of compromise. It also could well mean that that the fighting will become locked into a relatively static form of attrition warfare by the spring or summer of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;any-ceasefire-and-armistice-may-not-be-a-real-peace&quot;&gt;Any Ceasefire and Armistice May Not be a Real Peace&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strains imposed by the war could also mean that the both Ukraine and Russia will eventually be willing to settle for some form of armistice and ceasefire line that reflects the state of the war at the time — giving Russia a kind of limited territorial victory that would include a land bridge to the Crimea and be based on some set of rivers to enhance its stability, but where Russia formally recognizes some kind of official boundary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem would be that there may be little depth for a demilitarized zone, and any such settlement is unlikely to provide any basis for mutual trust. The resulting agreement might end the fighting but not even be a convincing image of peace. As the Armistice Agreement signed in the Korean War in July 1953 — and UN Security Council Resolution 598 that ended the fighting between Iran and Iraq — demonstrate, a ceasefire agreement can allow both sides to avoid negotiating lasting solutions, to make continued informal claims, to carry out minor clashes and armed encounters, and continue a military build-up and arms race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negotiating such an agreement also raises questions about security guarantees, the need for a peacekeeping force, and the issue of whether Ukraine could join NATO. This might be finessed by some compromise or U.S. and European security guarantees. Any such compromise would, however, leave the threat of future clashes open. The result could easily combine the best and worst aspects of conflict termination into one lasting mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for war crimes trials, the issue seems unlikely to become serious unless Russia suffers a massive defeat in the future or acquires radically different leadership. The legal case for crimes trials is almost certainly real, but the probability of actually prosecuting individuals seems doubtful, and would have to be somewhat arbitrary in two critical ways. First, if the war is a crime, the chief criminal is Putin. Trying to prosecute this particular war criminal seems a remarkably unlikely path toward conflict resolution. Second, short of creating some formal investigating and judicial bodies to fully investigate the actions of both sides — which seems equally unlikely — the result would probably be to prosecute a few easily provable cases and create “worst case” scapegoats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the war in Ukraine is also a warning about the future of the “laws of war.” Tragic as this new reality may be, targeting fixed civilian targets with precision guided conventional weapons is a growing fact of current military force development. It is becoming progressively easier, and much easier than striking mobile and defended military targets. Like other violations of the “laws of war,” there seems little probability of any meaningful enforcement unless the winner has a victory so decisive that such an outcome can be forced on the loser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of reparations is equally unlikely to be a real-world part of a peace settlement or ceasefire. Russia has clearly fought the war in Ukraine by deliberately attacking civilian targets, and this serves as an important warning that future wars are likely to have similar targeting patterns and strike at populated areas, infrastructure, and key economic targets. Using legal means to seize its sanctioned assets may provide a source of funding, but it also is certain to increase the lasting level of tension between Russia and Ukraine and the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rebuilding-ukraine-may-extend-the-civil-side-of-the-war-for-a-decade&quot;&gt;Rebuilding Ukraine May Extend the Civil Side of the War for a Decade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding Ukraine also involved far more than finding a source of funds. The Ukrainian GDP shrank by over 29 percent to some $140 billion in 2022 and the Ukrainian government estimated in June 2023 that it would need at least $18 billion in added civil aid just to its government to get through the year. This illustrates the fact that the war has already done critical damage to Ukraine’s economy, and that form of end to the fighting will raise the issue of how Ukraine can make a full economic recovery, and how it can repatriate the people who have been forced to flee, taken prisoner, or been caught up in the Russian occupation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much would depend on the exact nature of any peace agreement, armistice, or ceasefire line, but it seems most likely that Ukraine will not recover the Crimea, may not recover all of the Eastern Ukraine, and will face on going tension in terms of any trading across its border with Russia and Belarus. It also will not receive any meaningful reparations from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises serious questions about whether Ukraine will suffer the equivalent of a major economic defeat even if the war ends with a stalemate that involves no loss — or a limited additional loss of territory. In the case of European and Atlantic security, Ukraine has had major support from the United States, European states, and Canada but it is still far from clear how well they will cooperate in rebuilding NATO and in continuing to support Ukraine if the war lasts for several more years and then in helping Ukraine to rebuild if the actual fighting has some kind of end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no credible way at this point to even guess at the cost of making Ukraine an economically viable state once the fighting ends. The World Bank estimated in September 2022 that the cost could be $349 billion, but stated that, “This figure is expected to grow in the coming months as the war continues.” It stressed that these were only the cost of losses from February 24, to June 1, 2022, and did not include an analysis of the need to restructure the Ukrainian economy to reflect any kind of peace settlement and new trade and development needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank then raised the cost to $411 billion over the next ten years in March 2023. It stated that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Integrated into these needs are critical steps toward becoming a modern, low-carbon, disaster- and climate-resilient country that has aligned with European Union policies and standards in view of being ready to join the European Union, and where the population’s vulnerabilities are addressed, and people live in prosperity. While the financing envelope is overwhelming, experience from other countries shows that a phased approach to reconstruction is critical., but stressed that the figures in this report, “should be considered as minimums as needs will continue to rise as long as the war continues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A RAND study, issued in 2023, went further and looked at historical examples. It estimated that a longer war but one of only moderate intensity, and the probable timeframe for recovery, and estimates a total cost of $750 billion for the period from 2023 to 2032. These costs included $250-300 billion in partner grants, $200-300 billion in partner debt and equity, and more than $250 billion in private investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these data, the probability that Russia will never pay reparations, and the growing intensity of the fighting; every year the war goes on will sharply increase both the cost of Ukraine’s recovery and its need for continuing aid once the fighting ends. This will include sustaining and repatriating the population as well as development. There is no credible way to estimate how much but the post-fighting cost of foreign aid from the West, and recovery spending by Ukraine, could easily reach $1 trillion by the time the war is over, and full implementation of repatriation and recover could take a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-ukraine-a-formal-or-de-facto-part-of-nato-and-the-european-union&quot;&gt;Making Ukraine a Formal or De Facto Part of NATO and the European Union&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much may also depend on the progress made in making Ukraine a full or associated member of NATO and the European Union. Russia is almost certain to strongly resist such efforts as part of any ceasefire or peace settlement but tying Ukraine formally to NATO — either as a member of its some form of associated status — during the war, or as part of settlement — would provide a strong deterrent to anu renewal of the fighting and potentially commit NATO to coming formally to Ukraine’s defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true of create formal likes between Ukraine and the European Union — against either as a fully member or in some special status. This would imply a new level of European commitment to both Ukraine’s security and its recovery and help reinforce the proposes for a lasting peace in ways which did not involve a military build-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, leaving a post-conflict Ukraine outside of the Wests main strategic alliance, and Europe’s most important economic alliance, would leave Ukraine more exposed and caught between the two sides. There are good reasons why several NATO countries senior NATO officials have called for making Ukraine part of NATO as soon as possible, but Ukraine does need to show it qualifies as a viable member and the chance that quick action would further discourage some viable form of Russian peace settlement must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-lasting-confrontation-in-terms-of-european-and-atlantic-security-and-a-new-cold-war-between-the-west-and-russia&quot;&gt;The Lasting Confrontation in Terms of European and Atlantic Security, and a New “Cold War” between the West and Russia&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current fighting between Ukraine and Russia is only part of the reason the war will not end. Like many local wars, the war in Ukraine has had broader grand strategic impacts. There is no way to know exactly what Putin’s goals were in launching Russia’s second invasion of Ukraine, but his speeches and the possible strategic benefits make it clear a primary goal was to reassert Russia’s power relative to Europe and the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear from Putin’s speeches that the war in Ukraine is the result of his perception that Russia has suffered unacceptable losses because of the break-up of the former Soviet Union, and that the pre-war expansion of NATO posed an unacceptable threat. He sees Russia’s lack of economic progress and its decline as a great power as the fault of the West, and almost regardless of the outcome of the war in Ukraine, its impact will increase the confrontation between Russia, most of Europe, the United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-versus-the-west-the-war-in-ukraine-has-grand-strategic-impacts&quot;&gt;Russia versus the West: The War in Ukraine Has Grand Strategic Impacts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 1 provides a map of Ukraine’s strategic position in Europe. It shows how the break-up of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) altered Russia’s strategic position from one where it dominated Eastern Europe, had strategic depth, and could easily threaten both NATO’s flanks and its central region, to a position where Germany was unified as a member of NATO and the European Union, where most of the former Eastern European states in the Central Region joined NATO — Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovak, Hungary, and Romania — and where NATO forces were positioned directly on Russia’s borders. The only highly vulnerable countries in NATO were the small Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania — but these could also become serious threats from NATO to Leningrad and the core of Russia’s industry if reinforced by other NATO countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map also shows that if Russia had been successful, the sudden seizure of all Ukraine would have given Russia a major buffer zone and increase in strategic depth. It would have given Russia potential control of the Black Sea, major strategic leverage over Turkey, the ability to ensure its dominance of Belarus and Moldova, and added access to the Mediterranean, Balkans, Bulgaria, Iran and Iraq, and the smaller spin-offs from the FSU like Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Equally important, a sudden seizure of Ukraine would have given Russia control over a critical part of the world’s grain and other agricultural exports, potentially given it more economic leverage in using its oil and gas exports, and control over Ukraine’s industrial base which was an important part of the FSU’s military-industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, these same strategic issues helped shape the behavior of most European and NATO states in supporting Ukraine the moment that Russia invaded, and to both continue that support and build-up their own forces in ways that have so far virtually the opposite impact on Russia’s strategic position. The invasion of Ukraine triggered the equivalent of a much broader proxy war between NATO and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within weeks of Russia’s invasion, the war became one where almost every country in NATO — as well as Sweden, Finland, did more than support Ukraine with military funds, weapons, military training, and economic and humanitarian aid. The United States and most of its European partners made it clear that the saw Russia’s invasion as part of a much broader threat to the West and announced plans to expand their own military forces and modernize them, and NATO began to develop a new strategy and plans to improve its forward defense, interoperability, and deterrent capability to fight actual wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;this-time-the-peace-dividends-are-really-over&quot;&gt;This Time the Peace Dividends Are Really Over&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the war in Ukraine has led to a broader economic and technological struggle at the civil and economic level. The United States, most European nations, and many other strategic partners and neutral states; joined in sanctioning Russia, and Russia faced a steadily growing range of sanctions, and efforts to use economic and diplomatic pressure to force Russia to end the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very different response than the West’s response to Russia’s invasion of the Crimea. Russia’s rapid and successful seizure of the Crimea in 2014, had only produced a largely cosmetic set of NATO military spending goals based on spending 2 percent of a member country’s GDP on defense. Most NATO countries failed to make serious changes in their strategy, readiness, interoperability forward defense capabilities, and rates of progress in modernization after Russia invaded the Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only seven members of NATO planned to reach this 2 percent of GDP goal in 2022 before the new Russian invasion and only one of these countries — Poland — focused on meaningful increases in warfighting capabilities against Russia. (The other powers included Greece which focused on Turkey, the United States which focused on China and the Pacific, the United Kingdom which focused on naval power projection outside NTO, and small powers like Lithuania, and Latvia whose added spending had a negligible regional military impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Russia invaded Ukraine, most NATO European countries — as well as Finland and Sweden — rapidly announced serious plans to increase their defense spending and to rebuild and modernize their forces as a deterrent to Russia. While the United States continued to focus on China as its primary emerging threat, it rapidly pledged massive military and civil aid to Ukraine and began to restructure its force planning to provide major improvements in the readiness of its forces in Europe and capability to project power to Europe from the United States. And NATO revitalized its force planning activities and adopted a new strategy that called for forces that would be capable of active defense against serious Russia military action against NATO countries and capable of fighting a major war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, in turn, responded in ways that helped trigger a region-wide arms race in Europe and the Atlantic. and the beginning of a new form of Cold War. Russia expanded its operations to launch drone, missile, and air strikes against Ukraine in ways that made the potential Russian military threat to other European countries far clearer. It increasingly struck urban and infrastructure targets deep inside the country. It used its control of the Baltic to threaten Ukrainian grain exports and launched a political and information campaign that sought to both exhaust the Ukrainian people and deprive Ukraine of foreign support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also mobilized and expanded its military forces, began to reactivate its military industrial base, imported arms form sources as diverse as Iran. It found economic alternatives to trading with Europe, found new markets for its oil and gas exports, explored ways to speed the modernization of its military forces, and threatened the use of theater nuclear weapons and deploying such weapons to Belarus. It found many ways to bypass Western sanctions and tried to find ways to strengthen its partnership with China and with other major petroleum exporters like Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ualWkky.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;▲ &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Ukraine’s Strategic Position in Europe.&lt;/strong&gt; Source: Screenshot of NATO map, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nato.int/nato-on-the-map/#lat=51.72673918960763&amp;amp;lon=4.84911701440904&amp;amp;zoom=0&amp;amp;layer-1&quot;&gt;“NATO on the Map”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the fighting triggered a regional mix of economic warfare and military efforts that have taken on the character of active political-economic warfare between Russia and the West. Any halt to the fighting between Ukraine and Russia is extremely unlikely to end the economic struggle, arms race, and renewed emphasis on nuclear warfighting capabilities between Russia and the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is that the war in Ukraine has already to an ongoing military confrontation and regonal arms race in Europe. This confrontation may or may not lead to a major conflict, but it has already led to a new form of the Cold War that existed from the end of World War II to the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the break-up of the Warsaw Pact. It is equally clear that it is adding fuel to the ongoing strategic competition and arms race between the United States and its strategic partners on the one side; and Russia, and that it may spread to included China and nations like North Korea and Iran and become truly global in character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new “Cold War” will now be shaped by both the course and outcome of the war between Russia and Ukraine. If Russia should somehow succeed in winning a decisive victory over Ukraine, the grand strategic impact will be to redefine the boundary of the broader confrontation between the West and Russia on the basis of Russian gains. If NATO is to create an effective level of deterrence, it will have to greatly intensify the effort to build-up it forces and ensure strategic and theater level nuclear deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Ukrainian victory would have almost exactly the reverse effect. Unless such an outcome removed Putin and leaders like Putin, it would put even more pressure on Russia to find strategic counters to NATO, the United States, and key border states like the Baltic. It would probably push it to increase its reliance on nuclear weapons and dual capable forces. Russia would also even more to try to divide NATO, to increase its influence and military ties to nations on the periphery of NATO, and to conduct spoiler operations that would affect the United States and European powers with strategic interests and a military presence outside Europe. This could include a wide range of gray area operations and the difference between confrontation and conflict could be minimal and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the strategic impact of the war in Ukraine may turn out be more lasting and important in terms of its regional and global effects than the outcome of the fighting in Ukraine. Any stalemate, ceasefire, or credible peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia will still make Ukraine a part of the broader confrontation developing between the West and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-need-to-limit-natos-efforts-to-create-a-valid-level-of-extended-deterrence-and-fight-a-new-cold-war&quot;&gt;Russia’s Need to Limit NATO’s Efforts to Create a Valid Level of Extended Deterrence and Fight a New “Cold War”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put this broader aspect of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in context, the war has triggered a far broader U.S. and European focus on the need to rebuild NATO’s deterrent and warfighting capabilities. The war is reshaping the patterns of NATO country military spending and force planning for years to come, leading to a new focus on concepts like joint all domain warfare, and raising questions about the future role of theater nuclear weapons and of new precision strike systems that affect every aspect of European and Atlantic security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, NATO adopted a new Strategic Concept, and new versions of its Concept for the Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area and the NATO Warfighting Capstone Concept. The annual report of NATO’s Secretary General issued in 2023 calls for a new “NATO Force Model” that would substantially increase NATO’s forward defense capabilities, ability to rapidly deploy forces, readiness, training, and large-scale exercises. For example, NATO has now conducted its first major international air exercises in projecting air power to defend its border with Russia in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this effort is to be successful, it must last for years to come even if Russia and Ukraine do agree on some form of conflict termination, although it is far less clear whether most NATO countries will live up to their early pledges of increased military spending, modernization, and real-world deterrent and warfighting capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, it is important to note that the Secretary General’s report also notes that just improving the readiness and deployment of current forces will fall far short of NATO’s needs if it is to establish and maintain an effective future level of deterrence, and this means the require effort may well take over a decade to actually implement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the 2022 Strategic Concept, Allies confirmed the importance of missile defence capabilities for deterrence and defence, alongside conventional and nuclear capabilities, and pledged to strengthen NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2022, NATO had to adapt to the new security environment created by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, which includes heavy use of air and missile capabilities. NATO and Allies increased the readiness and responsiveness of their air and missile defence forces, including by forward deploying aircraft and surface-based air and missile defence units. Furthermore, a significant number of Allied aircraft have been put under the Supreme Allied Commander Europe’s command, in support of enhanced Air Policing activities and enhanced vigilance activities, including air patrol missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… At the same time, NATO must also address the growing challenge posed by the development of offensive air and missile assets by state and non-state actors, many of which can reach NATO territory or place NATO forces at risk. These challenges range from simple uncrewed systems to sophisticated hypersonic missiles. In 2022, NATO continued to enhance its Integrated Air and Missile Defence mission, including through increased readiness, exercises, and the acquisition by Allies of additional capabilities, with the aim of having the right capabilities at the right time and at the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Secretary General’s report stresses the need for major improvement in missile defense, deterrence and defense in space, cyber defense, and presents maps showing a wide range of other areas where added cooperation and investment are needed. It stresses, “countering unmanned aircraft systems; protecting harbors and other critical infrastructure; defending against terrorist use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear substances; electronic warfare for aircraft survivability; use and sharing of biometric data; technical exploitation;… countering improvised explosive devices, (and) ongoing efforts to enhance the use of emerging and disruptive technologies…” It also adds a long section on “ensuring safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale, funding, and interoperability of national longer-term efforts, however, is unclear, as is the willingness of given states to act. So far, defense ministers have tended to talk the talk and fail to walk the walk. They have placed far more emphasis on meeting a pointless spending goal than taking tangible action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Country force plans and defense budgets do not yet reflect anything like a cohesive effort to create an effective overall level of deterrence, particularly for joint all-domain operations, missile forces and missile defense, and creating options to deter a Russian build-up of theater nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-sheer-pointlessness-of-the-2-percent-solution&quot;&gt;The Sheer Pointlessness of the 2 Percent Solution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many countries still have little more than token forces or marginal capability to deploy forces and sustain such forces in combat, and/or are paying to sustain dated major weapons systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the one area where many claim that the broadest improvement in NATO’s effort that has so far taken place is in the area where it has least meaning. It is the extent to which member countries have raised their levels of defense spending to two percent or more of GDP, or pledged to do so. Unclassified NATO reporting does not attempt to project such efforts for the future, and currently only provides estimates for 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent there is any good news in such reporting, the United States does report a significant new emphasis on European defense in its FY 2024 budget request despite its focus on China, and the defense ministers of key powers like Germany, Poland, and the U.K. have at least outline potential meaningful increases in force capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the positive data NATO issues on the increases in member country military spending as a percent of GDP are more misleading than real. NATO does report that countries have raised their military spending significantly as a percent of GDP in constant U.S. dollars since 2014. Only seven countries have so far reached the 2 percent level set as a long-term goal in 2014, however, and three of the seven are the small Baltic powers that can only afford to create token forces and are dependent on outside power projection as key elements of their level of deterrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far too much emphasis is still being placed on raising defense spending to 2 percent of GDP. It may have been marginally acceptable in 2014. It today’s world, it is a remarkably stupid and irrelevant goal that does set any priorities for modernizing the forces of some 30 countries, making them more interoperable, and dealing with the need for integrated approaches to rapid forward deployment, a mutual capability for new forms of joint all domain warfare, addressing the growing threat to their economies and infrastructure, the uncertainties driven by Russia’s new emphasis on nuclear weapons, and the problems the current crisis has already revealed in war reserves and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting a 2 percent of GDP spending goal may have made political sense when the real purpose of the goal was to ensure that members maintained at least the shell of core of warfighting capability during a period when the confrontation between Russia and the West seemed to have largely ended. But even a briefing skim of the country-by-country force data in the IISS military balance, or the country military summaries issued by Jane’s, from 2014 onwards made it clear that spending 2 percent would not allow most countries to modernize their forces and make them properly interoperable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for setting a goal of 20 percent of defense spending on equipment, even an equally brief review of the very different ways countries defines such spending shows it is militarily irrelevant and often means reinforcing the lack of effective modernization and interoperability. Even by modern political standards, it can only be described as the kind of political rhetoric that needs to be following by an unflattering expletive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, there is no clear way to predict the actual future, although one can almost certainly count on at least an annual flow of reassuring political rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;putins-forever-war&quot;&gt;Putin’s Forever War&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s region-wide reactions to Ukraine War have been the polar opposite of NATO’s. President Putin has accused the West of starting the war in Ukraine by helping it to prepare for an attack on the areas Russian had seized in 2014. He has threatened the use of nuclear weapons, and state that defending against the West is a vital strategic objective, “For us, this is not a geopolitical task, but a task of the survival of Russian statehood, creating conditions for the future development of the country and our children.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war has led Putin to openly call for new patterns of global confrontation that also seem nearly certain to continue as long as Putin control Russia — even if Russia and Ukraine do find some way to end the fighting. U.S. strategy and that of several of its senior partners focused on broad global challenges from Russia and China before the war began, but war in Ukraine has push Russia closer to China and affecting the growing global competition between them and the world’s developed democracies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin made these views about an enduring military challenge from the West all too clear in the annual state of the nation speech he gave on February 21, 2022. He justified the Russian attack on Ukraine as a response to both Ukraine’s supposed preparations for any attack on Russia, and as part of a far broader Western effort to use military forces to threaten Russia’s security and dominate it in military terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… “If the Ukraine was to join NATO it would serve as a direct threat to the security of Russia… Many European allies of the United States already perfectly understood all the risks of such a prospect, but were forced to come to terms with the will of their senior partner. The Americans simply used them to carry out a pronounced anti-Russian policy. A number of member states of the alliance are still very skeptical about the appearance of Ukraine in NATO. At the same time, we are receiving a signal from some European capitals, saying what are you worried about, this will not happen literally tomorrow. Yes, in fact, our American partners are also talking about this. Well, we answer, if not tomorrow, so the day after tomorrow. What does this change in a historical perspective? Basically, nothing. Moreover, we know the position and words of the U.S. leadership that active hostilities in eastern Ukraine do not exclude the possibility of this country joining NATO if it can meet the criteria of the North Atlantic alliance and defeat corruption. At the same time, they try to convince us over and over again that NATO is a peace-loving and purely defensive alliance, saying that there are no threats to Russia. Again, they propose that we take them at their word. But we know the real value of such words.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We clearly understand that under such a scenario, the level of military threats to Russia will dramatically increase many times over. I pay special attention to the fact that the danger of a sudden strike against our country will increase many times over. Let me explain that U.S. strategic planning documents contain the possibility of a so-called preemptive strike against enemy missile systems. And who is the main enemy for the U.S. and NATO? We know that too. It’s Russia. In NATO documents, our country is officially and directly declared the main threat to North Atlantic security. And Ukraine will serve as a forward springboard for the strike. If our ancestors had heard about it, they probably would simply not have believed it. And today we don’t want to believe it, but it’s true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“They are trying to blackmail us again. They are threatening us again with sanctions, which, by the way, I think they will introduce anyway as Russia’s sovereignty strengthens and the power of our armed forces grows. And a pretext for another sanctions attack will always be found or fabricated. Regardless of the situation in Ukraine. There is only one goal — to restrain the development of Russia. And they will do it, as they did before. Even without any formal pretext at all. Just because we exist, and we will never compromise our sovereignty, national interests and our values. I want to say clearly and directly that in the current situation, when our proposals for an equal dialogue on fundamental issues have actually remained unanswered by the United States and NATO, when the level of threats to our country is increasing significantly, Russia has every right to take retaliatory measures to ensure its own security. That is exactly what we will do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;putin-on-confrontation-with-the-west-in-2023-year-after-the-start-of-the-war-in-ukraine&quot;&gt;Putin On Confrontation with the West in 2023: Year after the Start of the War in Ukraine&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin expanded upon these themes in more depth in his Presidential Address on February 21, 2023, roughly a year after the war in Ukraine began. Media reports on this speech necessarily summarized its key points, and his speech must be read in full to understate just how extreme Putin really became. The portions that call for anear-total decoupling the Russian economy from the West, are discussed in the next section on the global impacts of the war, but other key excerpts made it clear that his view of the threat from the West goes far beyond Ukraine and show all too clearly that his views have become progressively more extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin addressed Russia’s confrontation with the West, and the U.S. role in recent wars, as if Russia had gone to war to fight the equivalent of Nazi Germany as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are defending human lives and our common home, while the West seeks unlimited power. It has already spent over $150 billion on helping and arming the Kiev regime. To give you an idea, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the G7 countries earmarked about $60 billion in 2020–2021 to help the world’s poorest countries. Is this clear? They spent $150 billion on the war, while giving $60 billion to the poorest countries, despite pretending to care about them all the time, and also conditioning this support on obedience on behalf of the beneficiary countries. What about all this talk of fighting poverty, sustainable development and protection of the environment? Where did it all go? Has it all vanished? Meanwhile, they keep channeling more money into the war effort. They eagerly invest in sowing unrest and encouraging government coups in other countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The recent Munich Conference turned into an endless stream of accusations against Russia. One gets the impression that this was done so that everyone would forget what the so-called West has been doing over the past decades. They were the ones who let the genie out of the bottle, plunging entire regions into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to US experts, almost 900,000 people were killed during wars unleashed by the United States after 2001, and over 38 million became refugees. Please note, we did not invent these statistics; it is the Americans who are providing them. They are now simply trying to erase all this from the memory of humankind, and they are pretending that all this never happened. However, no one in the world has forgotten this or will ever forget it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;None of them cares about human casualties and tragedies because many trillions of dollars are at stake, of course. They can also continue to rob everyone under the guise of democracy and freedoms, to impose neoliberal and essentially totalitarian values, to brand entire countries and nations, to publicly insult their leaders, to suppress dissent in their own countries and to divert attention from corruption scandals by creating an enemy image. We continue to see all this on television, which highlights greater domestic economic, social and inter-ethnic problems, contradictions and disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… In fact, the anti-Russia project is part of the revanchist policy towards our country to create flashpoints of instability and conflicts next to our borders. Back then, in the 1930s, and now the design remains the same and it is to direct aggression to the East, to spark a war in Europe, and to eliminate competitors by using a proxy force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin described U.S. and European aid to Ukraine as the result of Western efforts to exploit Ukraine as a weapon in a global war against Russia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are not at war with the people of Ukraine. I have made that clear many times. The people of Ukraine have become hostages of the Kiev regime and its Western handlers, who have in fact occupied that country in the political, military, and economic sense and have been destroying Ukrainian industry for decades now as they plundered its natural resources. This led to social degradation and an immeasurable increase in poverty and inequality. Recruiting resources for military operations in these circumstances was easy. Nobody was thinking about people, who were conditioned for slaughter and eventually became expendables. It is a sad and dreadful thing to say, but it is a fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… The West is using Ukraine as a battering ram against Russia and as a testing range. I am not going to discuss in detail the West’s attempts to turn the war around, or their plans to ramp up military supplies, since everyone is well aware of that. However, there is one circumstance that everyone should be clear about: the longer the range of the Western systems that will be supplied to Ukraine, the further we will have to move the threat away from our borders. This is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Western elite make no secret of their goal, which is, I quote, “Russia’s strategic defeat.” What does this mean to us? This means they plan to finish us once and for all. In other words, they plan to grow a local conflict into a global confrontation. This is how we understand it and we will respond accordingly, because this represents an existential threat to our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, they too realize it is impossible to defeat Russia on the battlefield and are conducting increasingly aggressive information attacks against us targeting primarily the younger generation. They never stop lying and distorting historical facts as they attack our culture, the Russian Orthodox Church and other traditional religious organizations in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He summarized the sanctions on Russia’s economy and military-related imports as part of a broader and failed political and economic war as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… As I have already said, the West has opened not only military and informational warfare against us, but is also seeking to fight us on the economic front. However, they have not succeeded on any of these fronts, and never will. Moreover, those who initiated the sanctions are punishing themselves: they sent prices soaring in their own countries, destroyed jobs, forced companies to close, and caused an energy crisis, while telling their people that the Russians were to blame for all of this. We hear that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What means did they use against us in their efforts to attack us with sanctions? They tried disrupting economic ties with Russian companies and depriving the financial system of its communication channels to shutter our economy, isolate us from export markets and thus undermine our revenues. They also stole our foreign exchange reserves, to call a spade a spade, tried to depreciate the ruble and drive inflation to destructive heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let me reiterate that the sanctions against Russia are merely a means, while the aim as declared by the Western leaders, to quote them, is to make us suffer. “Make them suffer” — what a humane attitude. They want to make our people suffer, which is designed to destabilize our society from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is discussed in the last section of this analysis, Putin went on to describe the need for the equivalent of global economic warfare to meet the threat from the West in detail, and often in anecdotal ways. He claimed that Russia had so far countered every effort to put Western pressure upon it. He coupled Russia military to economic goals and described the Western threat in cultural terms as well as military and economic ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;putins-call-for-a-major-russian-military-build-up&quot;&gt;Putin’s Call for a Major Russian Military Build-Up&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin warned in his February 2023 State of the Union speech that the West’s military aid to Ukraine will force Russian to pressure on NATO and Europe, and force Russia to carry out a massive new military build-up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… The West is using Ukraine as a battering ram against Russia and as a testing range. I am not going to discuss in detail the West’s attempts to turn the war around, or their plans to ramp up military supplies, since everyone is well aware of that. However, there is one circumstance that everyone should be clear about: the longer the range of the Western systems that will be supplied to Ukraine, the further we will have to move the threat away from our borders. This is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Western elite make no secret of their goal, which is, I quote, “Russia’s strategic defeat.” What does this mean to us? This means they plan to finish us once and for all. In other words, they plan to grow a local conflict into a global confrontation. This is how we understand it and we will respond accordingly, because this represents an existential threat to our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, they too realize it is impossible to defeat Russia on the battlefield and are conducting increasingly aggressive information attacks against us targeting primarily the younger generation. They never stop lying and distorting historical facts as they attack our culture, the Russian Orthodox Church and other traditional religious organizations in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… We will widely introduce the latest technology to ensure high-quality standards in the Army and Navy. We have corresponding pilot projects and samples of weapons and equipment in each area. Many of them are significantly superior to their foreign counterparts. Our goal is to start mass production. This work is underway and is picking up pace. Importantly, this relies on domestic research and the industrial base and involves small- and medium-sized high-tech businesses in implementation of the state defence order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, our plants, design bureaus and research teams employ experienced specialists and increasing numbers of talented and highly skilled young people who are oriented towards breakthrough achievements while remaining true to the tradition of Russian gunsmiths, which is to spare no effort to ensure victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also formally denounced the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which has limited Russia military build-up in Europe on May 29, 2023, with no explanation other than,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Federal Law denounces the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), signed in Paris on November 19, 1990, and entered into force on November 9, 1992. The Treaty ensured a balance of forces of member states of the two military-political alliances — the Warsaw Treaty Organisation and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) — and limited the number of conventional arms and equipment (combat tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery, attack helicopters and combat planes) in the armed forces of these states. The Treaty was designed to establish a safe and stable balance of conventional armed forces in Europe and to eliminate the capability for launching a surprise attack or initiating large-scale offensive action in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Russian Federation suspended its participation in the Treaty by Presidential Executive Order No. 872 of July 13, 2007, &lt;em&gt;On the Suspension by the Russian Federation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and Related International Treaties&lt;/em&gt; and Federal Law No. 276-FZ of November 29, 2007, &lt;em&gt;On the Suspension by the Russian Federation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe&lt;/em&gt;. The Treaty has lost its relevance and does not meet Russia’s interests, therefore the Russian Federation decided to withdraw from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-limited-resources-for-military-spending&quot;&gt;Russia’s Limited Resources for Military Spending&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Putin’s rhetoric sharply exaggerates Russia’s potential capability to compete with the West and NATO in a major military build-up if they actually respond by making with an effective regional build-up that provides a true level of “extended deterrence.” As is discussed in depth in the next section of this analysis, Russia’s economy cannot compete in terms of total military spending, if NATO nations act on their declared intentions to rebuild their military forces. NATO Europe — and particularly key countries like Britain and Germany — may have taken excessive peace dividends, but the 2023 edition of the IISS Military Balance Estimates that Russia had a total official defense budget in 2022 of $87.8 billion, and a high estimate of $192 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such estimates of military spending are uncertain, since authoritarian states like Russia and China can manipulate their budgets and official financial data in ways other powers cannot, but the United States alone had a defense budget $766.6 billion by the IISS definition, or close to nine times the official Russian figure and four times the high estimate for Russia. If one looks at Europe, the three largest powers in the central region — Britain ($70.0billion), France ($54.4 billion) and Germany ($53.4) had a total of $178 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one uses the official Russian figure for military spending, the IISS estimates that Russia spent 4.4 percent of the world total. The United States spent 38.2 percent, Great Britain spent 3.5 percent, France spent 2.7 percent, Germany spent 2.7 percent, and the rest of NATO spent 7.8 percent — less Finland and Sweden. All of NATO spent 54.6 percent of the world total, or more than 12 times the percentage for Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers in the data issued by the Stockholm International ease Research Institute (SIPRI) are different, but similar in terms of their portrayal of relative effort. Figure 2 uses SIPRI data for the top 25 military spenders in the world, showing the patterns for 2013–2025. SIPRI uses its own estimate of real Russian and Chinese spending versus their official figures, but Russia still lags badly behind the United States and Russia, and major Western power and America’s other strategic partners far outspend Russia whose only strategic partner — Belarus — is a minor power that does not even rank among the top 50 spenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to SIPRI, even if one uses a higher “real world” figure for Russian spending, U.S. military spending was 39 percent of the world total in 2022, China was second at 13 percent, and Russia was only 3.9 percent. India was 3.6 percent and Saudi Arabia was 3.3 percent. If one looks at major strategic partners of the United States, the United Kingdom alone was close to Russia at 3.1 percent, Germany was 2.5 percent, France was 2.4 percent, Japan and South Korea were each 2.1 percent, Ukraine was 2.0 percent, Italy was 1.5 percent, Australia was 1.4 percent Canada was 1.2 percent and the rest of the world was 19 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be stressed that there is no way to compare the efficiency of Russian and Western spending, its effectiveness in creating operational levels of deterrence and warfighting, or relative economies of scale, but nothing about Russia’s performance in Ukraine to date indicates it has advantages in these areas over the United States and other well-equipped Western and other partner forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;linking-ukraine-war-to-ending-efforts-at-nuclear-arms-control&quot;&gt;Linking Ukraine War to Ending Efforts at Nuclear Arms Control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin does, however, have a wide range of affordable ways to expand his options for strategic and theater nuclear warfighting. He has long made speeches announcing new strategic and dual-capable long-range delivery systems and he has made new threats since the war began that Russia might use theater nuclear weapons in response to any Western support of Ukraine that that lead to major attacks on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the speeches Putin gave on Russian nuclear modernization years before Russia invaded Ukraine, this is a warning that Russia may seek to exploit its one remaining claim to be a true military superpower. As the war in Ukraine has made clear, Russia does not have anything like the conventional military forces that the former Soviet Union possessed, and a weak and militarily ineffective Belarus is its only strategic partner, but Russia has inherited the massive nuclear assets of the Former Soviet Union, and can easily transfer strategic warheads to new delivery systems, and take massive numbers of tactical and theater nuclear weapons out of storage and adapt them for use on Russia’s new conventionally-armed strike systems. This not only threatens the United States with a new level of mutual assured destruction but gives Russia the potential ability to deploy the equivalent of a massive new strategic nuclear threat to Europe and other neighboring states — since most theater and tactical nuclear weapons would be destructive enough to destroy European cities and critical infrastructure and economic targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may help explain why Russia has effectively withdrawn, or ceased to properly comply with, virtually of it conventional and nuclear arms reduction agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first major steps in this process occurred long before the war in Ukraine and affected nuclear forces in Europe. The United States and Russia had signed an Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in June 1987 and had stated that they had fully dismantled their longer-range theater forces in compliance with treaty deadline of on May 28,1991, some five months before the collapse of the FSU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2013, however, it had begun to deploy nuclear-capable SSC-8 or 9M729 ground-launched, intermediate-range cruise missiles with ranges that sharply exceeded the treaty’s 500-kilometer range limit, and that may have reached 2,500 kilometers. As Figure 3 shows, the United States and NATO made some 30 attempts to persuade Russia to comply with the treaty, and after these failed, the United States withdraw from the treaty on August 2, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same day, the U.S. Secretary of Defense issued the following statement, warning that Russia’s actions had triggered a possible new long-range theater nuclear arms race in Europe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The facts are clear. The Russian Federation is producing and fielding an offensive capability that was prohibited by the INF Treaty. Russia’s material breach erodes the foundation of effective arms control and the security of the United States and our allies and partners. As stated by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg today, NATO’s position is united and clear: Russia is in violation of the INF Treaty. The United States is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In light of Russia’s noncompliance, the Department of Defense commenced Treaty-compliant research and development activities beginning in 2017. The department’s initial research and development efforts focused on mobile, conventional, ground-launched cruise and ballistic missile systems. Because the United States scrupulously complied with its obligations to the INF Treaty, these programs are in the early stages. Now that we have withdrawn, the Department of Defense will fully pursue the development of these ground-launched conventional missiles as a prudent response to Russia’s actions and as part of the Joint Force’s broader portfolio of conventional strike options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The United States will not remain a party to a treaty while Russia is in deliberate violation. The Department of Defense will work closely with our allies as we move forward in implementing the National Defense Strategy, protecting our national defense and building partner capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year after the war in Ukraine began, Putin used his part of his February 2023 State of the Union speech to accuse the United States and NATO of using nuclear arms control as a weapon to spy on Russia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We know that the West is directly involved in the Kiev regime’s attempts to strike at our strategic aviation bases. The drones used for this purpose were equipped and updated with the assistance of NATO specialists. And now they also want to inspect our defence facilities? In the current conditions of confrontation, it simply sounds insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would like to draw your attention specifically to the fact that they are not letting us conduct full-scale inspections under this treaty. Our repeated applications to inspect different facilities remain unanswered or are rejected under formal pretexts, and we cannot verify anything on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would like to stress that the United States and NATO are openly saying that their goal is to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia. And what, after such statements they are supposed to tour our defence facilities, including the latest ones, as if nothing happened? A week ago, I signed an executive order putting new land-based strategic systems on combat duty. Are they going to poke their nose there as well? Do they think we will let them go there just because?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Having made this collective statement, NATO actually claimed to be a participant in the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms. We agree with this, please go ahead. Moreover, we believe this framing of the issue is long overdue. Let me recall that the US is not the only nuclear power in NATO. Britain and France also have nuclear arsenals. They are developing and upgrading them, and these arsenals are also directed against us — they are also directed against Russia. The latest statements by their leaders merely confirm it — listen for yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We cannot just ignore this and have no right to do so especially now. Nor can we forget that the Soviet Union and the United States initially signed the first Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms in 1991 in a completely different situation — in conditions of abating tensions and growing mutual trust. Subsequently, our relations reached a level that allowed Russia and the US to say they no longer considered each other enemies. Wonderful, everything was going very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Treaty of 2010 that is in force contains critically important provisions about indivisible security and the direct link between strategic offensive and defensive arms. All of that has long been forgotten. The United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty. It is now a thing of the past. Importantly, our relations have degraded which can be credited entirely to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After the Soviet Union broke up, they began to revise the outcomes of World War II and to build an American-style world ruled by one master. To do this, they began to rudely destroy the foundations of the international order laid down after WWII in order to cross out the legacy of the Yalta and Potsdam conferences. Step by step, they proceeded to revise the existing international order, to dismantle security and arms control systems, and plotted and carried out a series of wars around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To reiterate, all of that was done for the sole purpose of dismantling the post-WWII architecture of international relations. This is not a figure of speech. This is how it all unfolded in reality. After the Soviet Union collapsed, they sought to perpetuate their global dominance regardless of the interests of modern Russia or other countries for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the international situation changed after 1945. New centers of growth and influence have been formed and are rapidly expanding. This is a natural and objective process that cannot be ignored. But the United States trying to refashion the international order to suit exclusively its own needs and selfish interests is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now, they are using NATO to give us signals, which, in fact, is an ultimatum whereby Russia should, no questions asked, implement everything that it agreed to, including the New START Treaty, whereas they will do as they please. As if there is no connection between strategic offensive weapons and, say, the conflict in Ukraine or other hostile Western actions against our country. As if there are no vociferous claims about them seeking to inflict a strategic defeat on us. This is either the height of hypocrisy and cynicism, or the height of stupidity, but they are not idiots. They are not stupid after all. They want to inflict a strategic defeat on us and also to get to our nuclear sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this regard, I am compelled to announce today that Russia is suspending its membership in the New START Treaty. To reiterate, we are not withdrawing from the Treaty, but rather suspending our participation. Before we come back to discussing this issue, we must have a clear idea of what NATO countries such as France or Great Britain have at stake, and how we will account for their strategic arsenals, that is, the Alliance’s combined offensive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Their statement comes, in fact, as a request to join this process. Well, come onboard, we do not mind. Just try not to lie to everyone this time and present yourselves as champions of peace and detente. We know the truth. We are aware of the fact that certain types of US nuclear weapons are reaching the end of their service life. In this regard, we know for certain that some politicians in Washington are already pondering live nuclear tests, especially since the United States is developing innovative nuclear weapons. There is information to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Given these circumstances, the Defence Ministry and Rosatom must make everything ready for Russia to conduct nuclear tests. We will not be the first to proceed with these tests, but if the United States goes ahead with them, we will as well. No one should harbor dangerous illusions that global strategic parity can be disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same day, Russia announced it was suspending its compliance with the New START Treaty and its efforts to further reduce U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons. The Treaty was a follow-on to the earlier SALT agreements and called for major further reductions in each side’s stockpiles of nuclear weapons over the coming seven years. It limited the total number of ICBM, SSBN, and strategic nuclear bombers to 700 (Deployed and non-deployed systems were limited to 800), and their total holdings of nuclear bombs and warheads to 1550. It also allowed each side to make 18 inspections a year of the other nation’s nuclear holding — an area where Russia had halted full compliance before suspending the treaty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. State Department, the Treaty shaped the nuclear balance shown in Figure 4 as of September 1, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;raising-the-specter-of-nuclear-war-when-nuclear-weapons-are-the-only-remaining-area-where-russia-is-still-a-superpower&quot;&gt;Raising the Specter of Nuclear War when Nuclear Weapons Are the Only Remaining Area Where Russia Is Still a Superpower&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has made it increasingly clear since the start of the war in Ukraine that that Russian nuclear modernization is directed against the United States and the West. He stated that he would redeploy theater nuclear weapons to Belarus in July 2023, and may actually have done so in June 2023. As noted earlier, this threat is a broad warning that Russia is likely to do its best to exploit the only area where it remains an actual superpower in its competition with the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin does state in several of his speeches that Russia would never be the first to use nuclear weapons, but he has also made a repeated point of publicizing Russia’s new weapons systems, stressed their superiority and ability to overcome defenses, while he has accused the United States and the West of making the aggressive use of nuclear deployments in ways that approach being a parody of the threat that Russia presents to the West,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;About the threat of nuclear war… such a threat is growing, that it is a sin to hide here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Regarding the fact that Russia under no circumstances will apply the first. But if he does not use the first one under any circumstances, then the second one will not be used either, because the possibilities of using it in the event of a nuclear strike on our territory are very limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, our strategy for the use of means of defense, namely, as a defense, we consider weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons, it is all tuned around the so-called retaliatory strike, that is, when we are struck, we strike back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is also what everyone is now discussing, the so-called tactical nuclear weapons. It, American nuclear weapons, is located in large numbers on European territory. We have not, and are not, transferring our nuclear weapons to anyone, but, of course, we will protect our allies with all the means at our disposal, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But what’s the point here? The fact is that, just as in the previous case, when they talked about Russophobia, no one notices and does not want to notice and see what is being done and said in neighboring countries, in Western countries. I have already said: we do not maintain our own nuclear weapons, including tactical ones, on the territory of other countries, we do not have them, but the Americans have them both in Turkey and in a number of other European states. They are training on the possibility of using the carriers of these countries for the use of American nuclear weapons. We haven’t done any of this yet. This is the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Third. Did we talk about the possibility of application? No. Here’s the former Prime Minister of Great Britain, don’t forget tonight, she said publicly that she was ready to do it. In response to this, I had to emphasize some things too. Immediately, no one noticed her statement, and what we say immediately sticks out, and with these statements the whole world begins to frighten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, we have not gone mad, we are fully aware of what nuclear weapons are. We have these means, and they are in a more advanced and more modern form than any other nuclear country. This is obvious, today it is an obvious fact. But we’re not going to run around the world brandishing this weapon like a razor. But, of course, we proceed from the fact that it is. This is a natural deterrent, not provoking to the expansion of conflicts, but a deterrent. And I hope everyone understands this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia does face some economic limits on its most advanced and expensive nuclear modernization efforts. It is uncertain that Russia can really afford to develop and deploy all of the nuclear modernization programs that Putin has announced over the past few years, both for technical reasons and because of the burden of supporting the war in Ukraine. At the same time, Russia already has massive nuclear resources and is making clear progress in many of its new nuclear weapons and delivery system developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Figures show the trends and forces involved. Figure 5 shows an unclassified estimate of Russia’s current major nuclear weapons development programs. If anything, it sharply understates the Russia effort, since it does not include a wide range of dual-capable missile systems that Russia also has under development and that could be rapidly armed with nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 6 provides an unclassified summary of Russia’s current nuclear weapons holdings relative to the holding of all other nuclear powers made by several of the world’s top experts. It shows that current estimates of Russia nuclear capabilities give it a total of 5,889 nuclear weapons versus 5,244 for the United States Even if New Start remains viable, it will still have some 1,674 active strategic nuclear and deployed non-strategic warheads versus 1,670 for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also has 1,400 weapons in storage versus 1,536 for the United States Some may be deployable and the fissile material in most can be used in other weapons. More significantly. Russia has 2,815 non-deployed weapons in reserve it could use for tactical, theater, and strategic purposes versus only 1,938 for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether a return to the active deployment of tactical and theater nuclear forces, and the relative modernization of strategic forces, would give either side an advantage over the other, but it means that if both side return to major tactical and theater nuclear force deployments, Russia would have more weapons and that its potential total of active nuclear weapons could rise back to 4,215 versus 3,008 for the United States. These totals also compare with far smaller totals of 410 weapons for China, 290 for France, and 225 for the United Kingdom. (Pakistan is estimated to have 170, India 164, Israel 90, and North Korea 30.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers not only show that Russia is a true nuclear superpower, but just how rapidly it can increase the theater and tactical nuclear forces it deploys. Its leverage is severely limited by the U.S. ability to provide extended deterrence, and British and French capacity to carry strikes on Russian cities and key economic targets that would be equivalent to mutual assured destruction (MAD). At the same time, the risk to all Western states is so great that none can easily take the risk of challenging Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the mutual dangers in rejecting decades of progress in arms control and in trying to exploit any set of options that call for a return to a less safe margin of mutually assured destruction, are all too obvious. This is particularly true when advances in missile and long-range strike options mean that dual-capable conventional and nuclear armed systems can alter the escalation ladder and involve a steadily wider range of dual-capable weapons and missiles.&lt;/p&gt;

The “military stockpile” includes active and inactive warheads that are in the custody of the military and earmarked for use by commissioned delivery vehicles. The “total inventory” includes warheads in the military stockpile as well as retired, but still intact, warheads in the queue for dismantlement. The totals also differ in some respects from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2022-New-START-Implementation-Report.pdf&quot;&gt;State Department Report to Congress on Implementation of the New Start Treaty in January 2023&lt;/a&gt;, shown in Figure 4.

&lt;h4 id=&quot;nato-and-russias-strategic-posture-half-a-decade-from-now-complexity-theory-or-chaos-theory&quot;&gt;NATO and Russia’s Strategic Posture Half a Decade from Now: Complexity Theory or Chaos Theory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if one ignores the broader global uncertainties shaping the world as the war either reaches some end or drags on, there is no way to predict how all of these factors will reshape the broader posture of the West and Russia even half a decade from now. There is no way to know what kind of conflict termination will take place, if any, and what the force postures will then be on each side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way to know how the West, and given countries within it, will reshape their forces, how NATO will evolve, and what the impact of new tactics and technologies will be — and efforts to create truly interoperable forms of joint all domain warfare will reshape given national and NATO capabilities even in the comparatively short period of the next half decade. About all that is predictable is that no current NATO or national military plan will survive engagement with reality without major changes, and that the longer the fight last and the more expensive Ukraine’s recovery becomes, the more the West may divide over how much to spend on national security and how to react to any major shift in Russia’s force posture to go back to a reliance on theater nuclear forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also far from clear how many nations back the West’s support of Ukraine overtime. Early in the war, some 141 nations backed a UN resolution calling for unconditional Russian withdrawal from Ukraine and only four rejected the resolution: Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, and Syria. Even then, however, 47 other countries abstained or missed the vote, including China, India, Pakistan, Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Morocco, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Uganda, Bangladesh, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and Laos. Over time, Iran came to blame the United States for the war, and Brazil, Turkey, and the UAE distanced themselves from blaming Russia for the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other nations have increased their trade with Russia despite sanctions. China, Belarus, Armenia, Bolivia, Colombia, Georgia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Serbia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan have made significant increases in exports. Powers as diverse as Costa Rica and Switzerland have made smaller increases, and India has increased it imports of Russian oil. Iran has also exported drones to Russia, North Korea has exported artillery shells, and number of other countries are suspected of exporting military supplies and key components needed by Russia’s military industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Russia has largely made up the major drop in imports that suddenly took place in February 2022. While the Russian economy has not grown at the levels sometimes claimed by Putin, the IMF has reported that Russia has resumed some growth and the IMF raised its estimate for 2023 from only 0.3 percent to 2.3 percent in June 2023. Russia has scarcely escaped the effects of sanctions and other measures, but the effectiveness of measures to put pressure upon it may well continue to drop with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Russia faces major uncertainties as the costs of the war and Russian casualties rise. There is no way to calculate what level of train or political instability will occur, but these risks became all too clear on June 23, 2023, when the Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the head of Russia Wagner mercenaries, mobilized his forces against the higher command structure of the regular Russian military, and led Putin to mobilize the regular military against him. Nothing could do a better job of exposing the level of uncertainty that can and new complexities that can suddenly emerge on each side — and the fact that trying to predict longer term trends is more an exercise in chaos theory than in complexity theory — than the fact that Putin would suddenly find himself giving the following speech on the uncertainty within his own county on June 23, 2023:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today Russia is waging a hard fight for its future, repelling the aggression of neo-Nazis and their masters. Virtually the entire military, economic and information machine of the West is directed against us. We are fighting for the life and safety of our people, for our sovereignty and independence. For the right to be and remain Russia — a state with a thousand-year history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This battle, when the fate of our people is being decided, requires the unification of all forces, unity, consolidation and responsibility. When everything that weakens us must be thrown aside, any strife that our external enemies can and use to undermine us from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And therefore, actions that split our unity — are, in essence, defection from your people, from your comrades who are now fighting at the front. It’s a stab in the back of our country and our people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of blow that was dealt to Russia in 1917, when the country was fighting the First World War. But her victory was stolen. Intrigues, quarrels, politicking behind the back of the army and the people turned into the greatest upheaval, the destruction of the army and the collapse of the state, the loss of vast territories. In the end was the tragedy of the civil war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russians killed Russians, brothers—brothers, and the greedy profit was extracted by various political adventurers and foreign forces, which divided the country, tore it to pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will not let this happen again. We will protect both our people and our statehood from any threats. Including — from internal betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What we are facing is precisely betrayal. Exorbitant ambitions and personal interests have led to treason. To treason against their country, their people, and the cause for which, side by side with our other units and subdivisions, the fighters and commanders of the Wagner Group fought and died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Heroes who liberated Soledar and Artemovsk, cities and settlements of Donbass, fought and gave their lives for Novorossiya, for the unity of the Russian world. Their name and glory were also betrayed by those who are trying to organize a rebellion, pushing the country towards anarchy and fratricide. Towards defeat, ultimately, and capitulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I repeat, any internal turmoil is a deadly threat to our statehood, to us as a nation. This is a blow to Russia, to our people. And our actions to protect the Motherland from such a threat will be harsh. Everyone who deliberately embarked on the path of betrayal, who prepared an armed rebellion, embarked on a path of blackmail and terrorist methods, will suffer the inevitable punishment, they will answer both before the law and before our people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Armed Forces and other state bodies have received the necessary orders, additional anti-terrorist measures are now being introduced in Moscow, the Moscow region, and a number of other regions. Decisive actions will also be taken to stabilize the situation in Rostov-on-Don. It remains complicated, the work of civil and military administration is practically blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As the President of Russia and the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, as a citizen of Russia, I will do everything to defend the country, protect the constitutional order, the lives, safety, and freedom of citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those who organized and prepared the military rebellion, who took up arms against their comrades — betrayed Russia. And they will answer for it. And those who are being drawn into this crime, I urge not to make a fatal and tragic, irrevocable mistake, to make the only correct choice — to stop participating in criminal actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe that we will preserve and defend what is dear and sacred to us, and together with our Motherland we will overcome any trials, become even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-impact-on-global-competition-decoupling-from-the-west-and-turning-toward-china&quot;&gt;The Impact on Global Competition: Decoupling from the West and Turning toward China?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has also affected Russia’s global economic and military position in ways that go far beyond Ukraine and Europe. Putin has made it clear that he now seeks to find an alternative to Russia’s participation in the “rules-based order” established by the United States other of Western states, and their strategic partners. At the same time, Russia is seeking to create new strategic partners like China outside Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine did not trigger this growing global grand strategic confrontation between Russia and the West. Putin claimed the United States was deliberately creating wars in the developed world for its own interests for years before Russia invaded Ukraine. His statements have become far stronger since the war began, however, and regardless of how the fighting proceeds or end, it will now leave a lasting legacy of at least political and economic conflict as long as Putin or any leader like him remains in power and are at best more of a call for conformation rather than competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;decoupling-russia-from-the-west-and-a-rules-based-order&quot;&gt;Decoupling Russia from the West and a “Rules Based Order”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, Putin’s February 21, 2023, state of the nation speech went far beyond the war in Ukraine, and European security. Although the portions of the speech rejecting economic ties to the West and its “rules-based order” received only comparatively limited media attention, they made up nearly half his speech and were at least as hostile to the West as his remarks on the Nazi-like character of Western security efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last century has provided consistent warnings about the dangers of not taking extreme authoritarian rhetoric seriously, and Putin’s February 21st speech needs to be read in full to see just how extreme it really is; how Putin tied the war in Ukraine it to Russia’s need to reject reliance on the United States, Western Europe, and their strategic partners in Asia; and how he called for order. It is also important to note that much of the speech was a more aggressive version of the arguments he had made for years. Putin address may of the same themes in his speech to the Munich security conference in February 2007 — long before Russia seized the Crimea and some sixteen years before it invaded Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the portions of his speech that focus most directly on the links between the war and Russia broader grand strategic and economic resources show just how far Putin went in calling for Russia to reject most of its political and economic ties to the West and to seek out a new global political and economic system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we can see now, the promises of Western leaders, their assurances that they were striving for peace in Donbass turned out to be a sham and outright lies. They were simply marking time, engaged in political chicanery, turning a blind eye to the Kiev regime’s political assassinations and reprisals against undesirable people, their mistreatment of believers. They increasingly incited the Ukrainian neo-Nazis to stage terrorist attacks in Donbass. The officers of nationalist battalions trained at Western academies and schools. Weapons were also supplied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over the long centuries of colonialism, diktat and hegemony, they got used to being allowed everything, got used to spitting on the whole world. It turned out that they treat people living in their own countries with the same disdain, like a master. After all, they cynically deceived them too, tricked them with tall stories about the search for peace, about adherence to the UN Security Council resolutions on Donbass. Indeed, the Western elites have become a symbol of total, unprincipled lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We firmly defend our interests as well as our belief that in today’s world there should be no division into so-called civilized countries and all the rest and that there is a need for an honest partnership that rejects any exclusivity, especially an aggressive one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were open and sincerely ready for a constructive dialogue with the West; we said and insisted that both Europe and the whole world needed an indivisible security system equal for all countries, and for many years we suggested that our partners discuss this idea together and work on its implementation. But in response, we received either an indistinct or hypocritical reaction, as far as words were concerned. But there were also actions: NATO’s expansion to our borders, the creation of new deployment areas for missile defence in Europe and Asia — they decided to take cover from us under an “umbrella” — deployment of military contingents, and not just near Russia’s border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… The Western elite make no secret of their goal, which is, I quote, “Russia’s strategic defeat.” What does this mean to us? This means they plan to finish us once and for all. In other words, they plan to grow a local conflict into a global confrontation. This is how we understand it and we will respond accordingly, because this represents an existential threat to our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, they too realize it is impossible to defeat Russia on the battlefield and are conducting increasingly aggressive information attacks against us targeting primarily the younger generation. They never stop lying and distorting historical facts as they attack our culture, the Russian Orthodox Church, and other traditional religious organizations in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Look what they are doing to their own people. It is all about the destruction of the family, of cultural and national identity, perversion, and abuse of children, including pedophilia, all of which are declared normal in their life. They are forcing the priests to bless same-sex marriages. Bless their hearts, let them do as they please. Here is what I would like to say in this regard. Adult people can do as they please. We in Russia have always seen it that way and always will: no one is going to intrude into other people’s private lives, and we are not going to do it, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But here is what I would like to tell them: look at the holy scripture and the main books of other world religions. They say it all, including that family is the union of a man and a woman, but these sacred texts are now being questioned. Reportedly, the Anglican Church is planning, just planning, to explore the idea of a gender-neutral god. What is there to say? Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Millions of people in the West realize that they are being led to a spiritual disaster. Frankly, the elite appear to have gone crazy, and it looks like there is no cure for that. But like I said, these are their problems, while we must protect our children, which we will do. We will protect our children from degradation and degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Clearly, the West will try to undermine and divide our society and to bet on the fifth columnists who, throughout history, and I want to emphasize this, have been using the same poison of contempt for their own Fatherland and the desire to make money by selling this poison to anyone who is willing to pay for it. It has always been that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Those who have embarked on the road of outright betrayal, committing terrorist and other crimes against the security of our society and the country’s territorial integrity, will be held accountable for this under law. But we will never behave like the Kiev regime and the Western elite, which have been and still are involved in witch hunts. We will not settle scores with those who take a step aside and turn their back on their Motherland. Let this be on their conscience, let them live with this — they will have to live with it. The main point is that our people, the citizens of Russia, have given them a moral assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… As I have already said, the West has opened not only military and informational warfare against us, but is also seeking to fight us on the economic front. However, they have not succeeded on any of these fronts, and never will. Moreover, those who initiated the sanctions are punishing themselves: they sent prices soaring in their own countries, destroyed jobs, forced companies to close, and caused an energy crisis, while telling their people that the Russians were to blame for all of this. We hear that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What means did they use against us in their efforts to attack us with sanctions? They tried disrupting economic ties with Russian companies and depriving the financial system of its communication channels to shutter our economy, isolate us from export markets and thus undermine our revenues. They also stole our foreign exchange reserves, to call a spade a spade, tried to depreciate the ruble and drive inflation to destructive heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let me reiterate that the sanctions against Russia are merely a means, while the aim as declared by the Western leaders, to quote them, is to make us suffer. “Make them suffer” — what a humane attitude. They want to make our people suffer, which is designed to destabilize our society from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;However, their gamble failed to pay off. The Russian economy, as well as its governance model proved to be much more resilient than the West thought. The Government, parliament, the Bank of Russia, the regions and of course the business community and their employees all worked together to ensure that the economic situation remained stable, offered people protection and preserved jobs, prevented shortages, including of essential goods, and supported the financial system and business owners who invest in their enterprises, which also means investing in national development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As early as in March 2022, we launched a dedicated assistance package for businesses and the economy worth about a trillion rubles. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this has nothing to do with printing money. Not at all. Everything we do is solidly rooted in market principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2022, there was a decline in the gross domestic product. Mr. Mishustin called me to say, “I would like to ask you to mention this.” I think that these data were released yesterday, right on schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You may remember that some predicted that the economy would shrink by 20 to 25 percent, or maybe 10 percent. Only recently, we spoke about a 2.9 percent decline, and I was the one who announced this figure. Later it came down to 2.5 percent. However, in 2022, the GDP declined by 2.1 percent, according to the latest data. And we must be mindful of the fact that back in February and March of last year some predicted that the economy would be in free fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russian businesses have restructured their logistics and have strengthened their ties with responsible, predictable partners — there are many of them, they are the majority in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would like to note that the share of the Russian ruble in our international settlements has doubled as compared to December 2021, reaching one third of the total, and including the currencies of the friendly countries, it exceeds half of all transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will continue working with our partners to create a sustainable, safe system of international settlements, which will be independent of the dollar and other Western reserve currencies that are bound to lose their universal appeal with this policy of the Western elite, the Western rulers. They are doing all this to themselves with their own hands. We are not the ones reducing transactions in dollars or other so-called universal currencies — they are doing everything with their own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You know, there is a maxim, cannons versus butter. Of course, national defence is the top priority, but in resolving strategic tasks in this area, we should not repeat the mistakes of the past and should not destroy our own economy. We have everything we need to both ensure our security and create conditions for confident progress in our country. We are acting in line with this logic and we intend to continue doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thus, many basic, I will stress, civilian industries in the national economy are far from being in decline, they have increased their production last year by a considerable amount. The scale of housing put into service exceeded 100 million square meters for the first time in our modern history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As for agricultural production, it recorded two-digit growth rates last year. Thank you very much. We are most grateful to our agricultural producers. Russian agrarians harvested a record amount — over 150 million tonnes of grain, including over 100 million tons of wheat. By the end of the agricultural season, that is, June 30, 2023, we will bring our grain exports to 55–60 million tons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just 10 or 15 years ago, this seemed like a fairy tale, an absolutely unfeasible plan. If you remember, and I am sure some people do remember this — the former Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Agriculture are here — just recently, agrarians took in 60 million tons overall in a year, whereas now 55–60 million is their export potential alone. I am convinced we have every opportunity for a similar breakthrough in other areas as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We prevented the labor market from collapsing. On the contrary, we were able to reduce unemployment in the current environment. Today, considering the major challenges coming at us from all sides, the labor market is even better than it used to be. You may remember that the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent before the pandemic, and now, I believe, it is 3.7 percent. What is the figure, Mr. Mishustin? 3.7 percent? This is an all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let me reiterate that the Russian economy has prevailed over the risks it faced — it has prevailed. Of course, it was impossible to anticipate many of them, and we had to respond literally on the fly, dealing with issues as they emerged. Both the state and businesses had to move quickly. I will note that private actors, SMEs, played an essential role in these efforts, and we must remember this. We avoided having to apply excessive regulation or distorting the economy by giving the state a more prominent role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What else there is to say? The recession was limited to the second quarter of 2022, while the economy grew in the third and fourth quarters. In fact, the Russian economy has embarked on a new growth cycle. Experts believe that it will rely on a fundamentally new model and structure. New, promising global markets, including the Asia-Pacific, are taking precedence, as is the domestic market, with its research, technology and workforce no longer geared toward exporting commodities but manufacturing goods with high added value. This will help Russia unleash its immense potential in all spheres and sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We expect to see a solid increase in domestic demand as early as this year. I am convinced that companies will use this opportunity to expand their manufacturing, make new products that are in high demand, and to take over the market niches vacated or about to be vacated by Western companies as they withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, we clearly see what is going on and understand the structural issues we have to address in logistics, technology, finance, and human resources. Over the past years, we have been talking a lot and at length about the need to restructure our economy. Now these changes are a vital necessity, a game changer, and all for the better. We know what needs to be done to enable Russia to make steady progress and to develop independently regardless of any outside pressure or threats, while guaranteeing our national security and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would like to point out and to emphasize that the essence of our task is not to adapt to circumstances. Our strategic task is to take the economy to a new horizon. Everything is changing now and changing extremely fast. This is not only a time of challenges but also a time of opportunities. This is really so today. And our future depends on the way we realize these opportunities. We must put an end — and I want to emphasize this — to all interagency conflicts, red tape, grievances, doublespeak, or any other nonsense. Everything we do must contribute to achieving our goals and delivering results. This is what we must strive to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Enabling Russian companies and small family-run businesses to successfully tap the market is a victory in itself. Building cutting-edge factories and kilometers of new roads is a victory. Every new school, every new kindergarten we build is a victory. Scientific discoveries and new technologies — these are also victories, of course. What matters is that all of us contribute to our shared success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What areas should we focus the partnership of the state, the regions and domestic business on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First, we will expand promising foreign economic ties and build new logistics corridors. A decision has already been made to extend the Moscow-Kazan expressway to Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk and Tyumen, and eventually to Irkutsk and Vladivostok with branches to Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China. This will, in part, allows us to considerably expand our ties with Southeast Asian markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… Second, we will need to significantly expand our economy’s production capabilities and to increase domestic industrial capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;An industrial mortgage tool has been created, and an easy-term loan can now be taken out not only to purchase production facilities, but also to build or upgrade them. The size of such a loan was discussed many times and there were plans to increase it. It is a decent amount for a first step: up to 500 million rubles. It is available at a rate of 3 or 5 percent for up to seven years. It sounds like a very good program and should be put to good use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;New terms for industrial clusters took effect this year, including a lower fiscal and administrative burden on resident companies, and long-term state orders and subsidies to support demand for their innovative products, which are just entering the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to estimates, these measures will generate high-demand projects worth over 10 trillion rubles by 2030. Investment is expected to reach about 2 trillion this year alone. Please note that these are not forecasts, but existing benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, I would like the Government to expedite the launch of these projects, give a hand to businesses and come up with systemic support measures, including tax incentives. I am aware that the financial bloc does not like to provide incentives, and I partly share this approach: the taxation system must be consistent and without niches or exemptions, but this particular case calls for a creative approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… It is important to create additional conditions to encourage people to invest and earn at home, in the country. At the same time, it is necessary to guarantee the safety of people’s investment in voluntary retirement savings. We should create a mechanism here similar to the one used for insuring bank deposits. I would like to remind you that such savings, worth up to 1.4 million rubles, are insured by the state guarantee on deposits. I propose doubling the sum to 2.8 million rubles for voluntary retirement savings. Likewise, we must protect people’s investment in other long-term investment instruments, including against the possible bankruptcy of financial brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Separate decisions must be taken to attract funds to rapidly growing and high-tech businesses. We will approve support for the placement of their shares on the domestic stock market, including tax benefits for both the companies and the buyers of their stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Freedom of enterprise is a vital element of economic sovereignty. I will repeat: against the backdrop of external attempts to contain Russia, private businesses have proven their ability to quickly adapt to the changing environment and ensure economic growth in difficult conditions. So, every business initiative aimed at benefiting the country should receive support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I believe it is necessary to return, in this context, to the revision of a number of norms of criminal law as regards the economic elements of crime. Of course, the state must control what is happening in this area. We should not allow an anything-goes attitude here but we should not go too far, either. It is necessary to move faster towards the decriminalization I mentioned. I hope the Government will consistently and seriously conduct this work together with Parliament, the law-enforcement bodies and business associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I would like to ask the Government to suggest, in close cooperation with Parliament, additional measures for speeding up the de-offshorization of the economy. Businesses, primarily those operating in key sectors and industries should operate in Russian jurisdiction — this is a fundamental principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Colleagues, in this context I would like to make a small philosophical digression. This is what I would like to single out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We remember what problems and imbalances the Soviet economy faced in its later stages. This is why after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its planned system, in the chaos of the 1990s, the country began to create its economy along the lines of market relations and private ownership. Overall, this was the right thing to do. The Western countries were largely an example to follow in this respect. As you know, their advisers were a dime a dozen, and it seemed enough to simply copy their models. True, I remember they still argued with each other — the Europeans argued with the Americans on how the Russian economy should develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And what happened as a result? Our national economy was largely oriented to the West and for the most part as a source of raw materials. Naturally, there were different nuances, but overall, we were seen as a source of raw materials. The reasons for this are also clear — naturally, the new Russian businesses that were taking shape were primarily oriented toward generating profit, quick and easy profit in the first place. What could provide this? Of course, the sale of resources — oil, gas, metals, and timber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Few people thought about other alternatives or, probably, they did not have the opportunity to invest long-term. This is the reason other, more complex industries did not make much headway. It took us years — other governments saw this clearly — to break this negative trend. We had to adjust our tax system and make large-scale public investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have achieved real and visible change. Indeed, the results are there, but, again, we should keep in mind the circumstances in which our major businesses developed. Technologies were coming from the West, cheaper sources of financing and lucrative markets were in the West, and capital started flowing to the West as well. Unfortunately, instead of expanding production and buying equipment and technology to create new jobs in Russia, they spent their money on foreign mansions, yachts, and luxury real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They began to invest in the economy later, but initially the money flowed rapidly to the West for consumption purposes. And since their money was there, that is where their children were educated, where their life was, their future. It was very difficult and almost impossible for the state to track and prevent these developments, because we lived in a free market paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Recent events have clearly shown that the image of the West as a safe haven for capital was a mirage. Those who failed to understand this in time, who saw Russia only as a source of income and planned to live mostly abroad, have lost a lot. They just got robbed there and saw even their legitimate money taken away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At some point I made a joke — many may still remember it — I told Russian businesspeople that they will make themselves sick running from courtroom to courtroom and from office to office in the West trying to save their money. That is exactly how it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You know, I will say something that is quite simple, but truly important. Trust me, not a single ordinary citizen in our country felt sorry for those who lost their assets in foreign banks, lost their yachts or palaces abroad, and so on. In their conversations around the kitchen table, people have all recalled the privatization of the 1990s, when enterprises that had been built by our entire nation were sold for next to nothing and the so-called new elites flaunted their lavish lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are other key aspects. During the years that followed the breakup of the Soviet Union, the West never stopped trying to set the post-Soviet states on fire and, most importantly, finish off Russia as the largest surviving portion of the historical reaches of our state. They encouraged international terrorists to assault us, provoked regional conflicts along the perimeter of our borders, ignored our interests and tried to contain and suppress our economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am saying this because big business in Russia controls strategic enterprises with thousands of workers that determine the socioeconomic well-being of many regions and, hence, the overall state of affairs. So, whenever leaders or owners of such businesses become dependent on governments that adopt policies that are unfriendly to Russia, this poses a great threat to us, a danger to our country. This is an untenable situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, everyone has a choice. Some may choose to live in a seized mansion with a blocked account, trying to find a place for themselves in a seemingly attractive Western capital, a resort or some other comfortable place abroad. Anyone has the right to do that, and we will never infringe on it. But it is time to see that in the West these people have always been and will always remain second class strangers who can be treated any way, and their money, connections and the acquired titles of counts, peers or mayors will not help at all. They must understand that they are second class people there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is another option: to stay with your Motherland, to work for your compatriots, not only to open new businesses but also to change life around you in cities, towns and throughout your country. We have quite a few businesspeople like this, real fighters in our business community, and we associate the future of our business with them. Everyone must know that the sources of their prosperity and their future can only be here, in their native country Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If they do, we will create a very strong and self-sufficient economy that will not remain aloof in the world but will make use of all its competitive advantages. Russian capital, the money earned here, must be put to work for the country, for our national development. Today, we see huge potential in the development of infrastructure, the manufacturing sector, in domestic tourism and many other industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would like those who have come up against the predatory mores of the West to hear what I have to say: running around with cap in hand, begging for your own money makes no sense, and most importantly, it accomplishes nothing, especially now that you realize who you are dealing with. Stop clinging to the past, resorting to the courts to get at least something back. Change your lives and your jobs, because you are strong people — I am addressing our businesspeople now, many of whom I have known for years, who know what is what in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Launch new projects, earn money, work hard for Russia, invest in enterprises and jobs, and help schools and universities, science and healthcare, culture, and sports. In this way, you will increase your wealth and will also win the respect and gratitude of the people for a generation ahead. The state and society will certainly support you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let us consider this as a message for our business: get moving in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… We will develop cooperation with friends, with all those who are ready to work with us. We will adopt the best practices but will primarily rely on our own potential, on the creative energy of Russian society, on our traditions and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here I would like to mention the character of our people who have always been distinguished by their generosity, magnanimity, mercy and compassion, and Russia, as a country, fully reflects these traits. We know how to be good friends, how to stand by one’s word. We will never let anyone down and will always support those in a difficult situation without hesitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone remembers that during the pandemic we were actually the first to support some European countries, including Italy and other states when they were going through the most difficult weeks of the COVID outbreak, and let’s not forget how we are helping Syria and Turkiye after a devastating earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is the people of Russia that are the foundation of our national sovereignty and our source of power. The rights and freedoms of our citizens are immutable — they are guaranteed by the Constitution, and we will not depart from this despite the external challenges and threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… I would like to emphasize in this context that elections to local and regional government bodies next September and the presidential elections in 2024 will take place in strict accordance with the law and observance of all democratic, constitutional provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Elections always reveal different approaches to resolving social and economic goals. That said, the leading political forces are consolidated and united in the main idea — the security and wellbeing of the people; our sovereignty and our national interests override everything else for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you for this responsible, firm position and recall the words of Pyotr Stolypin, a patriot, and a proponent of a strong Russian state. He said this in the State Duma over a hundred years ago, but it is still consonant with our times. He said: “In the cause of defending Russia, all of us must unite and coordinate our efforts, our commitments and our rights for supporting one historical supreme right — the right of Russia to be strong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Volunteers at the frontline include deputies of the State Duma and regional parliaments, representatives from different levels of executive government bodies, municipalities, cities, districts, and rural areas. All parliamentary parties and leading public associations are taking part in collecting humanitarian aid to help at the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… The task is clear: in the next five years we need to train about a million specialists of working professions for the electronics industry, the robotics industry, mechanical engineering, metallurgy, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and the defence industry, construction, transport, nuclear and other industries that are key to ensuring the security, sovereignty, and competitiveness of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Finally, a very important question is about our higher education. Significant changes are also overdue here, considering the new requirements for specialists in the economy, social sectors, and in all spheres of life in our country. What we need here is a synthesis of all the best that was in the Soviet system of education and the experience of recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… Russia will meet any challenges because we are all one country, a big and united nation. We are confident in ourselves and confident in our strength. The truth is on our side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last century has provided consistent warnings about the dangers of not taking extreme authoritarian rhetoric seriously, and it is important to note that much of Putin’s speech was a more aggressive version of arguments he had made for years. For example, Putin advanced many of the same themes in his speech to the Munich security conference in February 2007 — long before Russia seized the Crimea in 2014, and some sixteen years before Russia invaded Ukraine for the second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time part of Putin’s speech is probably bluster and propaganda, and it is interesting to note that Putin gave a more positive view of Russia’s options for working with the present global economy when he spoke to an international audience in the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 16, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to realize that China and many states outside the developed world share some of Putin’s reservations about the impact of a “rules-based system” dominated by the West and other developed Asia powers, by their need to rely on the dollar as a reserve currency, by their vulnerability to economic sanctions ,and by the extent to which the current global economic system constrains their development, economies, and political influence. They too want to alter a “rules-based” economic system that was shaped by the strength of the United States and Western Europe during the decades following the end of World War II in ways that reflect the emergence of major new economic powers — and the fact the world’s population is now dominated by states outside this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In balance, the present international system will probably not evolve in anything like the way Putin calls for in his February 21 speech, but it may change radically over the next decade, and could evolve in ways that would sharply increase Russia’s dependence on China, the rest of Asia, the Middle East, and the rest of the world. It also seems likely that the economic war between the West and Russia that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will continue and become a serious factor in the evolution of the global economy, development. and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-is-barely-a-mid-level-economic-power-in-global-terms&quot;&gt;Russia Is Barely a Mid-Level Economic Power in Global Terms&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key problem for Russia in influencing this process will be that its global economic influence has become so limited. As is the case with military spending, the break-up of the former Soviet Union and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact left Russia a far smaller power in terms of its overall economic strength, its role in world trade (especially in trade other than food and petroleum exports), total manufacturing output, and total research and development effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The World Bank’s estimates of the trends in Russian, Western, Chinese, and other key gross national products are shown in Figure 7. Russia has clearly made far less progress than most developed states, and lagged grossly behind the United States, China, and European Union. These World Bank estimates end with 2021, and do not reflect the impact of sanctions on Russia. They do, however, indicate that Russia’s relative economic strength has consistently weaker relative to that of other major powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The estimates of the total Russian Federation’s GDP in 2021 is only $1,778 billion. The estimate for the United States is $23,315 billion: thirteen times as much. The estimate for the European Union is $17.177 billion, or nearly ten times as much. The estimate for United Kingdom alone is $3,131 billion, France is $2,958 billion, and Germany is $4,260 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be stressed that the data involved in calculating the overall size of different economies differ from metric to metric and source to source. They are often uncertain and/or politicized, and experts often disagree as to sources, definition, and the importance of given metrics. Most experts would agree, however, that the trends just quoted — and those shown in Figure 5 — are at least broadly correct in showing how small Russia’s GNP has remained relative to the United States, China, and the European Union since 1990, and that it is only marginally higher — or sometimes lower — than that of European states and key strategic partners in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure 11 provide further indications of Russia’s limited economic strength. They show that Russia ranks low in manufacturing output, total research development efforts, and in its volume of key aspects of world trade like manufacturing exports. The numbers and methods involved in generating the data used in these figures draw on more controversial methods and sources than the GDP data in Figure 7, but they again seem to reflect the same broad trends as do most other source on such trends, and Russia’s performance in poor in each area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;but-russia-does-have-some-core-national-security-strengths-in-competing-with-the-west&quot;&gt;But, Russia Does Have Some Core National Security Strengths in Competing with the West&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Putin can draw on some core strengths in funding Russia’s wars, its competition with the West, and its other national security efforts. Russia has had decades in which to reshape and rebuild its forces since the end of the Cold War. Its performance in the war in Ukraine have led to substantial casualties and losses of weapons and equipment and have raised serious question about its current force levels, their training and readiness, and their modernization. Nevertheless, Russia never took the some “peace dividends in reducing its forces that most NATO countries did and had total holdings at the start of the war in Ukraine close to the ones shown in Figure 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no reliable estimates of Russia’s military casualties (killed and wounded), or weapons and equipment losses. Expert Western sources warn that their estimates are more guesstimates than analyses, and Russia does not report anything approaching reliable figures. There also are no reliable data on Russia’s ability to replace its equipment losses and expenditures of ammunition and military supplies. So far, however, Russia has not exhibited any critical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is discussed in more depth shortly, Russia still has a large military industrial base and one support by major arms sales, and carried out a significant modernization effort before the war began. The United States has not issued an update of its official report on Russian military power for some years, but the Japanese Ministry of Defense reports that Russia claimed before the war that its State Armaments Program (GPV: Gosudarstvennaya Programma Vooruzheniya) was moving ahead with moving ahead with the development, procurement, and deployment of new equipment, such as the Su-35 and “Su-57”, which was under development as a “fifth-generation fighter, ”the “T-14 Armata” tank, and heavy unmanned combat aerial vehicles like; the “Okhotnik.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reported that the Russian Navy planned to increase the rate of modernization of its equipment to 70 percent by 2027, that its replacement of surface vessels for coastal waters was being completed, and that it would now focus on building surface vessels for the open sea. Russia undertook the construction of two of its first amphibious assault ships Russia undertook the construction of two of its first amphibious assault ships in July 2020, with an expected delivery in 2027. And, that Russia was making new developments in satellites anti-satellite missiles, and electronic warfare, improving the scale and complexity of its exercises, and creating major new facilities in the artic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of Russia’s claims to progress in building up and modernizing its forces, are suspect, but it almost certainly is spending more than it officially reports. A state-controlled economy can price national security efforts and allocate state resources with far more freedom than a market economy, can also report the total military and national security spending numbers it wants to report with only limited challenge, and report what it wants to report on the portion of its industrial base and research and development activity allocated to national security. This gives Putin’s government the ability to allocate a much larger percent of Russia’s national income and military forces and national security than is the case with representative governments or one where there is some form of reliable public accounting for government spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-military-industrial-base&quot;&gt;Russia’s Military-Industrial Base&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putin has made claims about the strength of Russia’s military technical and industrial base since the war in Ukraine began. One example is the claims Putin made about the ability of Russia’s military industrial base to help Russia win the war against Ukraine in a speech he gave on January 28, 2023:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In terms of achieving the end result and the victory that is inevitable, there are several things… It is the unity and cohesion of the Russian and multinational Russian people, the courage and heroism of our fighters… and of course the work of the military-industrial complex and factories like yours and people like you… Victory is assured, I have no doubt about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One needs to be cautious, however, in taking such statements at the face value, and accepting broad estimates of the total size of Russia military industrial base like those reported by Wikipedia: “Russia’s defense industry employs 2.5 to 3 million people and accounts for 20% of all manufacturing jobs in Russia… The combined revenue of the industry’s 20 largest companies in 2009 was $12.25 billion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no reliable database on the size of Russia military industrial base or military R&amp;amp;D effort. On the one hand the West has underestimated Russia’s capabilities in the past. The United States found after the break-up of the Former Soviet Union (FUS) that Russian actual military spending was nearly twice what the U.S. intelligence community had estimated before the FSU’s collapse, and that the same was true of its military industrial base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, estimates of Russia’s annual military spending and levels of total military manufacturing and research and development capacity by outside experts are so low that it seems unlikely that Russia’s current military-industrial base is large enough to qualify as a that of a true superpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however, some good general analyses of the trends and capabilities of Russia’s military industrial base, including work from the U.S. Congressional Research Service (CRS). A CRS study issued in 2021 discusses upon the initial impact of the war in Ukraine, lists key transfers of modern weapons, and summarizes the current state of Russia’s military industrial base in ways that do indicate it is stronger than Russia’s overall economic problems might indicate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia’s defense industry remains a domestically important sector, employing several million workers and supporting foreign arms sales… The government controls almost all of the defense industry, either directly or through equity share. In 2011, Russia launched a 10-year armament program, known as GPV-2020, with a goal to modernize the military’s weaponry. According to external analysis, the program funding allowed the sector to recapitalize many of its stagnant sectors, import precision tools, recruit a high-quality workforce, increase production, and resume development of R&amp;amp;D programs that had been on hold since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to Russian officials, the defense industry has largely achieved the goals of GPV-2020 and developed capabilities to produce systems across all major weapons categories. Russia asserts it has increased its ability to serially produce upgraded systems, increase production volumes, and innovate new designs (such as hypersonic and cruise missiles, electronic warfare, and air defense systems). Analysts generally consider such new systems to be formidable, increasing Russia’s military capability and competitiveness in foreign arms sales. Many of Russia’s newest systems have been under development since the 1990s and only recently entered state trials and serial production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… The Russian government views the defense industry as a key driver of technological growth and innovation. In 2015, Putin said the defense industry should “set the bar for technological and industrial development and continue to remain one of the main locomotives for innovation.” Government efforts to direct the defense industry to increase the production share of civilian and dual-use goods have met with questionable success… Despite positive official statements, most analysts point to significant challenges in Russia’s conversion effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… The Russian government and senior government officials have directed an extensive import substitution program to shift the defense industry toward a reliance on domestically produced components. Import substitution could reduce the defense industry’s exposure to foreign sanctions, improve the purchasing power of domestic military expenditure, and increase profit from foreign arms sales. This policy has become more important now that European and U.S. sanctions have limited Russian access from key suppliers and Ukraine has severed access to its defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russia’s import substitution program has been somewhat successful in replacing Western components and developing domestic manufacturing and production expertise; before 2014, Russia relied on Western producers for dual-use goods, especially high-end technology. The sanctions levied following Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine led Russia to experience a loss of access to Western expertise and equipment; analysts assert that this loss remains. Many analysts Russian Arms Sales and Defense Industry contend that such expertise and equipment are crucial to the development and production of new and advanced systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In comparison, Russia’s defense industry has been increasingly successful in reducing its reliance on systems and components produced in Ukraine before 2014… Russia’s defense industry faces other structural limitations and deficiencies. Despite some improvements and investments, most plants and equipment are older or outdated, which constrains production output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a key area for further analysis, an improved intelligence effort, and cooperative net assessment by by both government and experts in the West’s military industries and R&amp;amp;D efforts. It is not only important in understand how the war in Ukraine might evolve, and how its affect the development of the military balance between Russia and the West, but in assessing Russia’s leverage in global military competition and the leverage provide by its global arms sales in help Russia decoupled from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-arms-exports-as-source-of-decoupled-funds-and-economies-of-scale-in-military-industry-and-research-and-development&quot;&gt;Russia’s Arms Exports as Source of Decoupled Funds and Economies of Scale in Military Industry and Research and Development&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unclassified data on the value of Russia’s arms exports, and the nature and volume of its sales to given countries are as uncertain as the data on its arms exports. Once again, however, they are a Russian military strength in that they are almost certainly large enough to be one of Russia’s military strengths. They allow Russia to sustain much larger military efforts than the total size of its economy might indicate. Like its oil and gas exports, they also provide high levels of export income directly to the Russian regime in ways the government can use to allocate substantial funds to meeting military needs which have limited public transparency and political impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be stressed, however, that there also major problems in finding any source of reliable unclassified data. The U.S. State Department ceased to issue its report on World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT) in 2022, and the United States has not provided any estimates beyond 2019. This State Department database was the only official unclassified estimate of such spending and was once the only major source for reliable data on the actual scale and value of such sales, although the State Department effort had become increasingly uncertain several years before the report was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other sources on the economics and arms sales present significant problems. The United Nations Register of Conventional Arms does make an attempt to collect data on major weapons exports by type and category, but the UN effort is sharply limited by the fact it must rely on member countries for such reporting. Countries only report numbers of weapons transferred by major category of weapon, often report highly politicized and partial data, and their participation is often erratic. As for national official and unofficial reporting, there are some good official data for individual countries like the United States, and some good commercial reporting on individual countries, but none on Russia that seem reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the key comparative annual estimate of world arms transfers by year and country is now one made by the Stockholm International Pease Research Institute (SIPRI). This is an important source, but it is critical to note that the data do not compare that actual market value of exports and that much of media reporting on these SIPRI data totally the definition of the data that SIPRI reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SIPRI database does collect and distribute some individual national and contractor reports on the commercial value of arms transfers, although SIPRI does not attempt to estimate their accuracy or cover cases where there are no reports. The SIPRI database on the size of arms transfers is not, however, based on the market value of military contracts, or on the total market value of a given country’s transfers or the total income it receives. Its s reporting on contracts also does not include many efforts to sustain and support such sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data in SIPRI’s computerized database are SIPRI’S attempt to create a truly comparable estimate of the value of major weapons transfers using standardized prices, regardless of their actual sales price, and it estimates the overall volume of military exports and services, by measuring the volume of international transfers of major conventional weapons using a common unit, the trend-indicator value (TIV).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a useful way of trying to correct the gross differences in the quality and integrity of most of international arms sales data. The SIPRI estimates are summarized for the decade between 2013 and 2022 in Figure 13, and they are certainly valid in showing that Russia’s arms exports are some of the largest in the world, and potentially give Russia strategic leverage in a number of key countries like China. They do not, however, show how much actual income Russia receives from arms transfers or total market price that importer paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that Russia does not normally provide the same level of maintenance, training, and other support for its weapons transfers that the United States does as part of its Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs. This tends to exaggerate the dollar value of Russia’s sales relative to the United States and other countries that do provide such services and affects the value of Russian transfers to many — if not most importing states — where ongoing in-country support by the seller can be critical to sustainability, updating, and repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the SIPRI data in Figure 13 almost certainly do provide useful data for comparing the total volume of weapons sales, and SIPRI Yearbook for 2023 estimates that Russia is the second largest exporter of arms in the world, and that it exported 22 percent of all global sales in 2013–2017, and 16 percent in 2018–22. Russia has certainly benefited from economies of scale and from foreign arms sales income in ways that are not reflected in its public military budgets or the overall data it releases on its economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case with most previous metrics, however, the SIPRI data report that Russia arms exports are much smaller than those of the United States and its major strategic partners and provide far smaller advantages in terms of revenue and increased economies of scale. The data also show that Russia has lost market share to the United States over the last decade, and the West has a far higher market share relative to Russia than the Unites Staes alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also clearly failed to build-up massive war reserves before it invaded Ukraine and had to become an arms importer early in the war. It may since have improved its output of key items like artillery shells and drones, but the data available are too limited to fully understand the strengths and limits of its current military industrial base and capability to sustain its exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is also clear from the CRS report and virtually all other major sources is that Russia’s more developed customers — including China and India — are seeking to create their own military industries, and are concerned that Russia’s tensions with the West, and sanctions because of the Ukraine War, may make it less advanced, more expensive, and less reliable supplier. In short, Russia’s arms exports are declining both in terms of the income and scale they provide to Russia military industries and R&amp;amp;D efforts, and any ability to decouple its entire economy from Europe and the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data on Russia’s total commercial exports again reflect Russia’s decline relative to the former Soviet Union, and limited capability to compete with other major developed states and economic blocs. There are, however, two categories of exports — energy products and food products — that are exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, they too show that they too give Russia leverage in reducing its dependence on the West, countering sanctions, and in exerting political and economic influence. They also are subject to high levels of state control and are large enough to the Russian government substantial ability to use the resulting export income to funding military efforts without publicizing the full size of the effort and creating major domestic political opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s wheat sales, food oil, and other food exports are both a major source of income. and one where sanctions are difficult to apply — given the humanitarian needs of many poor and developing countries. This also is an area where World Trade Organization estimates that Russia may have gained economic benefits from the war in Ukraine. Even though some customers shifted to other suppliers, the WTO estimates that the value of Ukraine’s food exports dropped by 30 percent from March to November of 2021, while the value of Russian exports — which did not face a serious Ukrainian military threat — gained by 15.6 percent This rise was driven largely by the export of oilseeds, fats, and oils whose value rose by 30.4 percent to $7,810, million. In contrast, Russian cereal exports dropped by $14.9 percent to $5,405 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One source, the OEC, or Observatory of Economic Complexity, provides an exceptional amount of detailed data on Russia’s commercial exports which it says is drawn from a wide range on reporting by individual importing countries. The reliability of such data is uncertain, but the OEC provides an exceptionally detailed breakout of national sources and summarizes Russia’s total exports as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The top exports of Russia are Crude Petroleum ($113B), Refined Petroleum ($81.8B), Petroleum Gas ($37.7B), Coal Briquettes ($19.1B), and Gold ($19.1B), exporting mostly to China ($70.9B), Netherlands ($39B), United States ($27.4B), United Kingdom ($24.7B), and Italy ($22.2B). In 2021, Russia was the world’s biggest exporter of Semi-Finished Iron ($9.84B), Wheat ($8.92B), Non-fillet Frozen Fish ($2.72B), Pig Iron ($2.04B), and Ammonia ($1.79B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 14 provides an OEC graph of the trends in Russia exports by country from January 2019 to April 2023. It indicates that Russia succeeded in rapidly shifting the direction of its exports to markets outside the West, despite major cuts in the volume of trade with the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russias-energy-exports&quot;&gt;Russia’s Energy Exports&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s energy exports include oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear fuel, and they offer Russia a potential way to shift a key portion of its economy to markets outside of Europe and the West, and possibly to build a stronger partnership with China. So far, the data on the impact of the war and sanction are preliminary, and subject to major future changes, but they indicate that — as the case with food exports — Russia has already had major success in shifting its exports, although it has scarcely done so in ways which distance it from dependence on a global economy driven by Western and other outside economic growth and the current “rule-based” system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the OEC, the IEA is only one of many conflicting sources, but it has been accurate in the past. Figure 14 shows that the IEA indicates that Russia was able to shift its oil exports to the West away from Europe relatively rapidly after it invaded Ukraine and sanctions began to be applied. At the same time, the constant swings in global oil and gas prices mean that such data always vary sharply for other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the war, oil revenues constituted 30–35 percent of the total Russian budget. In early 2023, oil revenues had fallen to just 23 percent of the Russian budget. This decline in revenue has occurred despite Russia’s exporting roughly 5 to 10 percent more crude oil in April 2023 compared to March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Figure 15 shows more mixed trends for natural gas exports, and the IEA analyzed the trends in gas exports as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The European Union’s commitment in the March 2022 Versailles Declaration to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports “as soon as possible” is set to transform the continent’s energy and gas markets in the years to come, with implications for global trade and market dynamics.… The EU’s reliance on Russian gas has grown steadily over the past decade. The bloc’s gas consumption declined only marginally over this period, but production has fallen by two-thirds since 2010 and the gap has been filled by rising imports. As a result, Russia’s share of total EU gas demand increased from 26% in 2010 to an average of over 40% through 2018-2021. The IEA was among the first to raise concerns about this rising dependence.… Russia more than halved its pipeline gas supplies to the EU in the past year. But the European gas market proved to be resilient as nations were able to fill their storage sites to above 95% capacity by ramping up non-Russian supplies and rapidly reducing consumption. Consequently, Russia’s share of European gas demand fell from 23% in 2022 to below 10% in January 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These data are important because the IEA estimates that Russia competes with Saudi Arabia and the United States for the title of the World’s largest exporter of oil and gas, and that its exports of crude and condensate reached 10.5 million barrels a day in 2021, or 14 percent the world’s supply. It also estimates that such energy exports funded 45 percent of the government’s federal budget. Russia is the second-largest producer of natural gas, after the United States, and has the world’s largest gas reserves and the world’s largest gas exports. It produced 762 bcm of natural gas in 2021 and exported approximately 210 bcm via pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia also had begun to increasingly cooperate with OPEC and key exporters like Saudi Arabia before it invaded Ukraine in any effort to control their volume of exports in ways that would increase their net petroleum export income. The end results have been erratic from month, but Russia does seem to be successful in shifting its oil and gas exports from Europe to the other parts of the world like China, while the war in Ukraine has steadily reduced Ukraine’s ability to export grain and food oil in ways that have forces importing nations to rely more on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is far from clear, that this is — or will — produce enough income to help Russia successfully decouple its economy from the West unless Russia can somehow reach lasting agreements with major importers at high oil and gas prices as part of some strategic agreement with major importers as distinguished from relying on global market forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is discussed in depth at the end of this analysis, the only way Russia seems likely to be able to do this is by reaching such an agreement in ways that shift it’s a large portion of its energy exports to a major power like China. As is discussed later, there have been some shifts in Russia’s exports that could have this effect. The IEA indicates that Russia’s pipelines and energy shipping capabilities reach large parts of Europe and Asia, and increasingly export to Asia. Before the war, Russia’s 5,500 km Druzhba pipeline system transported 750,000 bpd of crude directly to refiners in east and central Europe, and Russia supplied some 20 percent of European refinery crude. Russia also exported a large amount of product, including 750,000 bpd of diesel to Europe, or 10 percent of demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Russia launched the 4,740 km 1.6 million bpd ESPO pipeline to export crude directly to Asian markets like China and Japan. The IEA reports that this was part of “a strategy focused on shifting export dependence away from Europe.” Russia also has increased its shipment by ship and rail, and that Russia se the northern route of shipping in the Artic as another way of increasing its exports to Asia. The artic is the site of 80 percent of Russia gas production and 20 percent of its crude production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As for transporting natural gas, the IEA reports that Russia’s current gas export pipeline network now transits through Belarus, the Ukraine, and directly into Europe. A new Nord Stream II pipeline was not opened in 2021 because of the Ukraine War and was then sabotaged Russia natural gas accounted for 45% of imports and almost 40% of European Union gas demand in before the war. In late 2019, Russia activated a new 3,000 km-long Power of Siberia pipeline, to send gas from to China which will gradually ramp up from 10 bcm to 38 bcm.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;As is discussed in more detail in the following section of this analysis, Russia is seeking to develop a Power of Siberia-2 pipeline, with a capacity of 50 bcm/y, to supply China from the West Siberian gas fields although no final investment decision have been made. Russia also is expanding its liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity, to compete with growing LNG exports from the United States, Australia, and Qatar. Russia exported 40 bcm of LNG in 2021, making it the world’s 4th largest LNG exporter and accounting for approximately 8% of global LNG supply. In 2021, Russa also released a long-term LNG development plan, setting goals of 110-190 bcm/year LNG exports by 2025.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;china-as-a-possible-focus-of-a-major-russian-decoupling-from-the-west&quot;&gt;China as A Possible Focus of a Major Russian Decoupling from the West&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this background, Russia’s one current major option for decoupling from the from the West, and the current rules-based system of most developed powers, seems to be a far stronger strategic partnership with China. As the previous Figures and data have shown, China has emerged as a major economic superpower, and China is rapidly becoming a modern conventional military and nuclear superpower as well. China’s growing tension with the United States, European, and the major developed Asia states have also made it a major military and civil competitor with the West and its strategic partners and give it reasons to become a strategic partner with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Russia and China already claim to have such strategic partnership. They signed a &lt;em&gt;Joint Statement of the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation on Deepening the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Coordination for the New Era&lt;/em&gt; in Moscow on March 21, 2023. While the agreement called for dialogue to create a peaceful settlement to the war, the section that addressed to war in Ukraine made it tacitly clear that China backed Russia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the Ukraine issue, the two sides believe that the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter must be observed and international law must be respected. The Russian side speaks positively of China’s objective and impartial position on the Ukraine issue. The two sides oppose the practice by any country or group of countries to seek advantages in the military, political and other areas to the detriment of the legitimate security interests of other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Russian side reaffirms its commitment to the resumption of peace talks as soon as possible, which China appreciates. The Russian side welcomes China’s willingness to play a positive role for the political and diplomatic settlement of the Ukraine crisis and welcomes the constructive proposals set forth in &lt;em&gt;China’s Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The two sides point out that to settle the Ukraine crisis, the legitimate security concerns of all countries must be respected, bloc confrontation should be prevented and fanning the flames avoided. The two sides stress that responsible dialogue is the best way for appropriate solutions. To this end, the international community should provide support to the relevant constructive efforts. The two sides call for stopping all moves that lead to tensions and the protraction of fighting to prevent the crisis from getting worse or even out of control. The two sides oppose any unilateral sanctions unauthorized by the UN Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s exports and strategic position also make it a natural partner China in three critical respects. First, it is harder for the United States and its strategic partners to challenge both Russia and China than to challenge or deter a single rival. Second, Russia oil and gas exports can provide a less vulnerable source of fossil fuels than shipment out the Persian Gulf or across the pacific. Third, China is still modernizing its military forces in ways which can benefit from Russian arms exports, its remaining military R&amp;amp;D and technology base, and military cooperation in dealing with Japan in any confrontation with the United States in the Northwestern Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-prospects-for-a-closer-russo-chinese-strategic-partnership&quot;&gt;The Prospects for a Closer Russo-Chinese Strategic Partnership&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a major difference, however, between cooperation and a true alliance, as well as any Russian ability to decouple from the West. Russia and China have come closer together over the last few decades as both have increased their respective challenges to the West and its strategic partners. and as both have made efforts to increase their influence the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China have also expanded their economic and military ties. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stresses this in the history of Russo-Chinese cooperation it places on its official website, although it does not address the fact that Russia and China have moved separately in competing with the United States, Europe, and their strategic partners, and in confronting with other states. Moreover, China has focus on expanding its economic power and global efforts like its “belt and road” program. Russia has focused on military cooperation and arms sales, and only Russia has moved to open war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are serious potential limits to how strong a real-world partnership between Russia and China is likely to become, and the prospects for creating such a partnership also seem to be largely independent of the course and outcome of the war in Ukraine. Even if one ignores the major past shifts from Russo-Chinese cooperation to hostility and back to cooperation since the end of World War II, both countries may again become competitors in the future in areas like Central Asia. Moreover, China has so far been so successful in competing with the West with only a limited partnership with Russia that the prospects for change currently seem limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is again important to pay close attention to what national leaders and countries actually say at the official level, and China has so far been careful to limit its rhetoric about coordination with Russia, and any competition with the West. The text of a Chinese statement about Russo-Chinese cooperation that was issued under President Xi’s name by the Russian Foreign Ministry before the meeting of Xi and Putin in March 2023 clearly emphasizes China’s development and limited cooperation with Russia over any full alliance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the invitation of President Vladimir Putin, I will soon pay a state visit to the Russian Federation. Russia was the first country I visited after I was elected President ten years ago. Over the past decade, I have made eight visits to Russia. I came each time with high expectations and returned with fruitful results, opening a new chapter for China-Russia relations together with President Putin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China and Russia are each other’s biggest neighbor and comprehensive strategic partner of coordination. We are both major countries in the world and permanent members of the UN Security Council. Both countries uphold an independent foreign policy and see our relationship as a high priority in our diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a clear historical logic and strong internal driving force for the growth of China-Russia relations. Over the past ten years, we have come a long way in our wide-ranging cooperation and made significant strides into the new era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;High-level interactions have played a key strategic role in leading China-Russia relations.&lt;/strong&gt; We have established a whole set of mechanisms for high-level interactions and multi-faceted cooperation which provide important systemic and institutional safeguards for the growth of the bilateral ties. Over the years, I have maintained a close working relationship with President Putin. We have met 40 times on bilateral and international occasions. Together we have drawn the blueprint for the bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields, and have had timely communication on major international and regional issues of mutual interest, providing firm stewardship for the sustained, sound and stable growth of China-Russia relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Our two sides have cemented political mutual trust and fostered a new model of major-country relations.&lt;/strong&gt; Guided by a vision of lasting friendship and win-win cooperation, China and Russia are committed to no-alliance, no-confrontation and not targeting any third party in developing our ties. We firmly support each other in following a development path suited to our respective national realities and support each other’s development and rejuvenation. The bilateral relationship has grown more mature and resilient. It is brimming with new dynamism and vitality, setting a fine example for developing a new model of major-country relations featuring mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Our two sides have put in place an all-round and multi-tiered cooperation framework.&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to the joint efforts of both sides, China-Russia trade exceeded US$190 billion last year, up by 116 percent from ten years ago. China has been Russia’s largest trading partner for 13 years running. We have seen steady increase in our two-way investment. Our cooperation on major projects in such fields as energy, aviation, space and connectivity is moving forward steadily. Our collaboration in scientific and technological innovation, cross-border e-commerce and other emerging areas is showing a strong momentum. Our cooperation at the sub-national level is also booming. All this has brought tangible benefits to both the Chinese and the Russian peoples and provided unceasing driving force for our respective development and rejuvenation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Our two sides have acted on the vision of lasting friendship and steadily strengthened our traditional friendship.&lt;/strong&gt; On the occasion of commemorating the 20th anniversary of the &lt;em&gt;China-Russia Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation&lt;/em&gt;, President Putin and I announced the extension of the Treaty and added new dimensions to it. Our two sides have held eight “theme years” at the national level and continued to write new chapters for China-Russia friendship and cooperation. Our two peoples have stood by and rooted for each other in the fight against COVID, which once again proves that “a friend in need is a friend indeed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;— &lt;strong&gt;Our two sides have had close coordination on the international stage and fulfilled our responsibilities as major countries.&lt;/strong&gt; China and Russia are firmly committed to safeguarding the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. We have stayed in close communication and coordination in the UN, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS, the G20 and other multilateral mechanisms, and worked together for a multi-polar world and greater democracy in international relations. We have been active in practicing true multilateralism, promoting the common values of humanity, and championing the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Looking back on the extraordinary journey of China-Russia relations over the past 70 years and more, we feel strongly that our relationship has not reached easily where it is today, and that our friendship is growing steadily and must be cherished by us all. China and Russia have found a right path of state-to-state interactions. This is essential for the relationship to stand the test of changing international circumstances, a lesson borne out by both history and reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My upcoming visit to Russia will be a journey of friendship, cooperation and peace. I look forward to working with President Putin to jointly adopt a new vision, a new blueprint and new measures for the growth of China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To this end, our two sides need to enhance coordination and planning. As we focus on our respective cause of development and rejuvenation, we should get creative in our thinking, create new opportunities and inject new impetus. It is important that we increase mutual trust and bring out the potential of bilateral cooperation to keep China-Russia relations at a high level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our two sides need to raise both the quality and quantity of investment and economic cooperation and step up policy coordination to create favorable conditions for the high-quality development of our investment cooperation. We need to boost two-way trade, foster more convergence of interests and areas of cooperation, and promote the complementary and synchronized development of traditional trade and emerging areas of cooperation. We need to make sustained efforts to synergize the Belt and Road Initiative and the Eurasian Economic Union, so as to provide more institutional support for bilateral and regional cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our two sides need to step up people-to-people and cultural exchanges and ensure the success of China-Russia Years of Sports Exchange. We should make good use of the sub-national cooperation mechanisms to facilitate more interactions between sister provinces/states and cities. We should encourage personnel exchanges and push for the resumption of tourism cooperation. We should make available better summer camps, jointly run schools and other programs to steadily enhance the mutual understanding and friendship between our peoples, especially between the youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The world today is going through profound changes unseen in a century. The historical trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation is unstoppable. The prevailing trends of world multi-polarity, economic globalization and greater democracy in international relations are irreversible. On the other hand, our world is confronted with complex and intertwined traditional and non-traditional security challenges, damaging acts of hegemony, domination, and bullying, and long and tortuous global economic recovery. Countries around the world are deeply concerned and eager to find a cooperative way out of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In March 2013, when speaking at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, I observed that countries are linked with and dependent on one another at a level never seen before, and that mankind, living in the same global village, have increasingly emerged as a community with a shared future in which everyone’s interests are closely entwined. Since then, I have proposed the Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative on different occasions. All these have enriched our vision for a community with a shared future for mankind and provided practical pathways toward it. They are part of China’s response to the changes of the world, of our times, and of the historic trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Through these ten years, the common values of humanity — peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom — have taken deeper roots in the heart of the people. An open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world with lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity has become the shared aspiration of more and more countries. The international community has recognized that no country is superior to others, no model of governance is universal, and no single country should dictate the international order. The common interest of all humankind is in a world that is united and peaceful, rather than divided and volatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since last year, there has been an all-round escalation of the Ukraine crisis. China has all along upheld an objective and impartial position based on the merits of the issue, and actively promoted peace talks. I have put forth several proposals, i.e., observing the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, respect of the legitimate security concerns of all countries, supporting all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis, and ensuring the stability of global industrial and supply chains. They have become China’s fundamental principles for addressing the Ukraine crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not long ago, we released &lt;em&gt;China’s Position on the Political Settlement of the Ukraine Crisis&lt;/em&gt;, which takes into account the legitimate concerns of all parties and reflects the broadest common understanding of the international community on the crisis. It has been constructive in mitigating the spillovers of the crisis and facilitating its political settlement. There is no simple solution to a complex issue. We believe that as long as all parties embrace the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and pursue equal-footed, rational and results-oriented dialogue and consultation, they will find a reasonable way to resolve the crisis as well as a broad path toward a world of lasting peace and common security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To run the world’s affairs well, one must first and foremost run its own affairs well. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, are striving in unity to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through the Chinese path to modernization. Chinese modernization is characterized by the following features: it is the modernization of a huge population, the modernization of common prosperity for all, the modernization of material and cultural-ethical advancement, the modernization of harmony between humanity and nature, and the modernization of peaceful development. These distinctive Chinese features are the crystallization of our practices and explorations over the years, and reflect our profound understanding of international experience. Going forward, we will steadfastly advance the cause of Chinese modernization, strive to realize high-quality development, and expand high-standard opening up. I believe that this will bring new development opportunities to Russia and all countries in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just as every new year starts with spring, every success starts with actions. We have every reason to expect that China and Russia, as fellow travelers on the journey of development and rejuvenation, will make new and greater contributions to human advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;russia-and-the-chinese-peace-plan&quot;&gt;Russia and the Chinese Peace “Plan”&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China have not cooperated directly in the war in Ukraine, and China has carefully kept an official distance from openly supporting Russia, and from openly providing arms and other military support. It also important to note that China has presented its own 12-point peace plan and taken visible diplomatic steps to publicize and negotiate it. Once again, it is important to study what governments actually say, and the rhetoric they use, rather than rely on outside summaries and comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China’s peace plan for the war in Ukraine is also radically different from Putin’s hardline public rhetoric. The official text of the Chinese Foreign Ministry report on first meeting between Xi and Putin in three years, and more than a year after the beginning of the Ukraine War, presents both the following peace plan and the following call for international cooperation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respecting the sovereignty of all countries.&lt;/strong&gt; Universally recognized international law, including the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, must be strictly observed. The sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries must be effectively upheld. All countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal members of the international community. All parties should jointly uphold the basic norms governing international relations and defend international fairness and justice. Equal and uniform application of international law should be promoted, while double standards must be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abandoning the Cold War mentality.&lt;/strong&gt; The security of a country should not be pursued at the expense of others. The security of a region should not be achieved by strengthening or expanding military blocs. The legitimate security interests and concerns of all countries must be taken seriously and addressed properly. There is no simple solution to a complex issue. All parties should, following the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and bearing in mind the long-term peace and stability of the world, help forge a balanced, effective and sustainable European security architecture. All parties should oppose the pursuit of one’s own security at the cost of others’ security, prevent bloc confrontation, and work together for peace and stability on the Eurasian Continent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ceasing hostilities.&lt;/strong&gt; Conflict and war benefit no one. All parties must stay rational and exercise restraint, avoid fanning the flames and aggravating tensions, and prevent the crisis from deteriorating further or even spiraling out of control. All parties should support Russia and Ukraine in working in the same direction and resuming direct dialogue as quickly as possible, so as to gradually deescalate the situation and ultimately reach a comprehensive ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resuming peace talks.&lt;/strong&gt; Dialogue and negotiation are the only viable solution to the Ukraine crisis. All efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis must be encouraged and supported. The international community should stay committed to the right approach of promoting talks for peace, help parties to the conflict open the door to a political settlement as soon as possible, and create conditions and platforms for the resumption of negotiation. China will continue to play a constructive role in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolving the humanitarian crisis.&lt;/strong&gt; All measures conducive to easing the humanitarian crisis must be encouraged and supported. Humanitarian operations should follow the principles of neutrality and impartiality, and humanitarian issues should not be politicized. The safety of civilians must be effectively protected, and humanitarian corridors should be set up for the evacuation of civilians from conflict zones. Efforts are needed to increase humanitarian assistance to relevant areas, improve humanitarian conditions, and provide rapid, safe and unimpeded humanitarian access, with a view to preventing a humanitarian crisis on a larger scale. The UN should be supported in playing a coordinating role in channeling humanitarian aid to conflict zones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting civilians and prisoners of war (POWs).&lt;/strong&gt; Parties to the conflict should strictly abide by international humanitarian law, avoid attacking civilians or civilian facilities, protect women, children and other victims of the conflict, and respect the basic rights of POWs. China supports the exchange of POWs between Russia and Ukraine, and calls on all parties to create more favorable conditions for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping nuclear power plants safe.&lt;/strong&gt; China opposes armed attacks against nuclear power plants or other peaceful nuclear facilities, and calls on all parties to comply with international law including the Convention on Nuclear Safety (CNS) and resolutely avoid man-made nuclear accidents. China supports the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in playing a constructive role in promoting the safety and security of peaceful nuclear facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing strategic risks.&lt;/strong&gt; Nuclear weapons must not be used and nuclear wars must not be fought. The threat or use of nuclear weapons should be opposed. Nuclear proliferation must be prevented and nuclear crisis avoided. China opposes the research, development, and use of chemical and biological weapons by any country under any circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facilitating grain exports.&lt;/strong&gt; All parties need to implement the Black Sea Grain Initiative signed by Russia, Türkiye, Ukraine, and the UN fully and effectively in a balanced manner, and support the UN in playing an important role in this regard. The cooperation initiative on global food security proposed by China provides a feasible solution to the global food crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stopping unilateral sanctions.&lt;/strong&gt; Unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure cannot solve the issue; they only create new problems. China opposes unilateral sanctions unauthorized by the UN Security Council. Relevant countries should stop abusing unilateral sanctions and “long-arm jurisdiction” against other countries, so as to do their share in deescalating the Ukraine crisis and create conditions for developing countries to grow their economies and better the lives of their people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping industrial and supply chains stable.&lt;/strong&gt; All parties should earnestly maintain the existing world economic system and oppose using the world economy as a tool or weapon for political purposes. Joint efforts are needed to mitigate the spillovers of the crisis and prevent it from disrupting international cooperation in energy, finance, food trade and transportation and undermining the global economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promoting post-conflict reconstruction.&lt;/strong&gt; The international community needs to take measures to support post-conflict reconstruction in conflict zones. China stands ready to provide assistance and play a constructive role in this endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Chinese peace plan is carefully supportive of many of the same goals advanced by the West and other members of the international community. It should be noted, however, that the first two points are a more polite and diplomatic version of some of Putin’s critiques of the West and U.S. support of democratic protests and revolutions, as well as its policies in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did make it clear in its reporting on the meeting between Xi and Putin that the war in Ukraine had not halted China’s movement toward closer cooperation with Russia in some areas. It also stated that both countries agreed to create a new strategic plan for cooperation in 2024:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;President Xi noted that he was pleased to pay another state visit to Russia at the invitation of President Putin. Russia was the first country he visited after he was elected President ten years ago. Memories from that visit remain fresh today. Over the past ten years, he and President Putin stayed in close touch. President Xi expressed his appreciation to President Putin for immediately sending him congratulatory messages on his reelection as General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee by the 20th CPC National Congress and on his reelection not long ago as Chinese President. He noted that Russia will hold the presidential election next year, and under President Putin’s strong leadership, Russia has made good progress in development and rejuvenation. President Xi said he is confident that the Russian people will continue to give firm support to President Putin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;President Xi stressed that there is a profound historical logic for China-Russia relationship to reach where it is today. China and Russia are each other’s biggest neighbor and comprehensive strategic partner of coordination. Both countries see their relationship as a high priority in their overall diplomacy and policy on external affairs. China always upholds an independent foreign policy. To consolidate and develop well China-Russia relations is a strategic choice China has made on the basis of its own fundamental interests and the prevailing trends of the world. China is firm in keeping to the general direction of strengthening strategic coordination with Russia. Both China and Russia are committed to realizing national development and rejuvenation, support world multi-polarity and work for greater democracy in international relations. The two countries should further deepen practical cooperation in various fields and strengthen coordination and collaboration on multilateral platforms such as the UN to boost their respective national development and rejuvenation, and be a bulwark for world peace and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;President Putin extended a warm welcome to President Xi for his state visit to Russia and once again warmly congratulated him on his reelection as Chinese President. President Putin said that in the past ten years China made impressive and great achievements in all areas of development. This is attributable to the outstanding leadership of President Xi and proves the strength of China’s national political system and governance system. He was confident that under President Xi’s strong leadership, China will definitely continue to develop and prosper and successfully realize all the great goals that have been set. With concerted efforts by both sides, Russia-China relations in recent years have delivered fruitful results in various areas. Russia stands ready to continue to deepen bilateral practical cooperation, step up communication and collaboration in international affairs, and promote world multi-polarity and greater democracy in international relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The two sides had an in-depth exchange of views on the Ukraine issue. President Xi stressed that, on the Ukraine issue, voices for peace and rationality are building. Most countries support easing tensions, stand for peace talks, and are against adding fuel to the fire. A review of history shows that conflicts in the end have to be settled through dialogue and negotiation. China released a document on its position on the Ukraine crisis, advocating the political settlement of the crisis and rejecting the Cold War mentality and unilateral sanctions. China believes that the more difficulties there are, the greater the need to keep space for peace. The more acute the problem is, the more important it is not to give up efforts for dialogue. China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting the political settlement of the Ukraine issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;President Putin said that Russia appreciates China for consistently upholding an impartial, objective, and balanced position and standing for fairness and justice on major international issues. Russia has carefully studied China’s position paper on the political settlement of the Ukraine issue and is open to talks for peace. Russia welcomes China to play a constructive role in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The two Presidents said that they look forward to formal talks on the next day to draw up a new blueprint for China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a separate document describing new movements toward Russian and Chinese economic cooperation, and highlighting an increase in the volume of trade after the beginning of the war in Ukraine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… he and President Putin held candid, friendly and fruitful talks. They had an in-depth exchange of views on the bilateral ties and major regional and international issues of mutual interest, and reached new, important common understandings in many fields. They signed and issued a &lt;em&gt;Joint Statement of the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation on Deepening the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Coordination for the New Era&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;Joint Statement of the President of the People’s Republic of China and the President of the Russian Federation on Pre-2030 Development Plan on Priorities in China-Russia Economic Cooperation&lt;/em&gt;, making plans and arrangements for the growth of the bilateral relations and wide-ranging cooperation between the two countries going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;President Xi stressed that he and President Putin reviewed the achievements of the growing bilateral relationship over the last ten years. They shared the view that this relationship has gone far beyond the bilateral scope and acquired critical importance for the global landscape and the future of humanity. China and Russia have followed the principles of good-neighborliness, friendship and win-win cooperation in advancing exchanges and cooperation in various areas. Under the new historical circumstances, the two sides will view and handle China-Russia relations with a broad vision and a long-term perspective, in a bid to make greater contribution to human progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;President Xi pointed out that since last year, the all-round practical cooperation between China and Russia has yielded fruitful outcomes, and continued to manifest its strengths of solid fundamentals, high complementarity and strong resilience. Two-way trade has grown by 116 percent over the last ten years. This has not only consolidated the material foundation for the bilateral relations, but also given an important boost to economic and social development in both countries. This is not an easy achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He and President Putin agreed that the two sides need to strengthen overall design and top-level planning, boost trade in energy, resources, and electromechanical products, enhance the resilience of their industrial and supply chains, expand cooperation in such areas as information technology, the digital economy, agriculture and trade in services, promote greater complementarity and joint development of traditional trade and emerging areas of cooperation, and further facilitate cross-border logistics and transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They shared the view that the two sides should continue to cement the cornerstone of people-to-people exchanges. To be specific, efforts should be made to encourage more interactions between sister provinces/states and between sister cities, ensure the success of the Years of Sports Exchange, and facilitate the personnel movement between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The two sides noted that as permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and Russia will continue to work with the international community to firmly uphold the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. China and Russia will work more closely within multilateral frameworks including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, BRICS and the G20, practice true multilateralism, and promote post-COVID economic recovery. The two sides will boost the constructive force for building a multi-polar world and improving the global governance system, contribute more to maintaining global food and energy security and keeping industrial and supply chains stable, and work together for a community with a shared future for mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cooperation-between-a-true-great-power-and-major-economy-and-a-fading-state&quot;&gt;Cooperation between a True Great Power and Major Economy and a Fading State&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical problem with these Chinese statements about partnership — and their Russian equivalent in statements about China — is that both countries now have radically different levels of power, and trends in military and economic development. As Figures 7 though Figure 11, and Figures 14 and 15, have shown Russia is now a small economic power relative to China, and both nations only had limited trade in manufactured goods and modern areas of economic development before the war in Ukraine began. This makes any partnership that calls for a decoupling of the Russian and Chinese economies from the West far less credible, both because China has a far stronger interest in its global economic ties and far fewer practical options in replacing its economic links to the West.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, the data involved differ by source. However, the World Bank estimates in Figure 16 indicate the size of China’s major trading partners before the beginning of the war in Ukraine, and Russia is only a fraction of the total. The United States and other Western powers have since added some additional sanctions and restrictions on their trade and sharing of technology with China, but their impact has not altered the fact that China’s trade, economy, and development remains critically dependent on civil trade with the West and other developed states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that continued Chinese economic growth and development are overwhelmingly dependent on trading partners other than Russia. In fact, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported a significant increase in U.S. trade with China in 2022 — trends that provide an important caution as to how easy it is to decouple the trade between the two states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2022, both U.S. exports to China and imports from China continued to grow for a third year in a row. U.S. exports totaled $153.8 billion, an increase of 1.6% ($2.4 billion) from 2021; U.S. imports from China totaled $536.8 billion, an increase of 6.3% ($31.8 billion); and the trade deficit with China was $382.9 billion, an increase of 8.3% of ($29.4 billion). In 2022, 7.5% of total U.S. exports of $2.1 trillion to the World were exported to China, 16.5% of total U.S. imports of $3.2 trillion were imported from China, and 32.4% of total U.S. trade deficit was with China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is certainly a growing level of tension between China and the United States, and between many of China’s oher trading partners over China’s economic economics policies, efforts to dominate key markets and technologies, and desire to compete on its own terms. This makes it possible that a combination of Russia’s desire to decouple from the West, and the growing level of confrontation between key developed states like United States, European Union, Japan, and South Korea could drive Russia and China closer together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is discussed shortly, the sanctions on Russian gas exports to Europe have moved in this direction. Yet Russia and China have economies so radically different in structure, size, and levels of growth that Russia cannot provide a basis for some of decoupling. China’s need for a massive volume of trade in advanced manufactured goods still makes it unlikely that China will fail to find some form of compromise with other highly developed states and chose to create the kind of partnership with Russia that would both limit its growth and development and require China to subsidize Russia’s economy to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chinese-strategic-dependence-on-fossil-fuels&quot;&gt;Chinese Strategic Dependence on Fossil Fuels&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one looks in detail at the structure of Chinese economic relations and trade with Russia, there few areas other than arms where China seems to have a need for special economic ties to Russia. Some experts have suggested may be China’s need for fossil fuels might be such a case. China is now heavily dependent on imports of oil and gas, most of which come by sea and from the Persian Gulf states rather than the United States and its strategic partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports the trends in oil imports from Russia shown in Figure 17. It shows that Chinese General Administration of Customs reports that China’s crude oil imports were 508.28 Mt (10.17 mb/d) in 2022 and 513 Mt in 2021. These same data also show that the growth in Russia’s exports to China lagged behind the growth of supplies from other countries before the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of China’s other suppliers did reduce their oil exports to China once the war began, while China increased its petroleum imports from Malaysia and Russia. At the same time, most of these cuts in supply were driven by price rather than China’s tensions with other power or the invasion of Ukraine, and the increase in imports that came from Malaysia was nearly twice that from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EIA describes these trends as follows,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the second quarter of 2022, China processed the least crude oil since the first quarter of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic had the strongest effect on China’s economic activity. The resurgence of COVID-19 cases since March 2022 and China’s policy of localized mobility restrictions explain China’s reduced demand for petroleum products, and as a result, reduced refinery activity, in the second quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In addition to decreased domestic demand, lower export quotas for finished petroleum products, beginning around the second half of 2021, have contributed to reduced demand for crude oil processing in China. Because China has been processing less crude oil, it has also been importing less crude oil for processing. China’s crude oil imports peaked in late 2020 and early 2021 before decreasing as a result of lower domestic demand and higher global crude oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s crude oil imports were particularly low in June and July 2022. In June, China’s crude oil imports decreased to 8.8 million barrels per day (b/d), the least since July 2018. Imports remained at 8.8 million b/d in July, down 2.0 million b/d from May of this year but increased to 9.5 million b/d in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Despite China’s total crude oil imports decreasing in recent months, China’s crude oil imports from Russia have increased from 8% (slightly less than 400,000 b/d) of total crude oil imports in 2011 to about 16% (1.6 million b/d) in 2021, and to as much as 21% (2.0 million b/d) in August 2022. Russia’s share of China’s crude oil imports was 20% in June and 19% in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Western economic sanctions have reduced consumption of Russia’s crude oil in many countries. Europe, for example, has been looking for alternative sources, driving up prices for Brent crude oil and leaving crude oil prices in Russia at a discount. Likely in response to these dynamics, China has shifted its imports away from more expensive western sources to imports from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for natural gas, the EIA reports that,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China’s natural gas consumption more than tripled from 10.4 Bcf/d in 2010 to 35.1 Bcf/d in 2022. The industrial sector led this growth and increased by, increasing by 10.3 Bcf/d, followed by the residential and commercial sector at 6.5 Bcf/d and the electric power sector at 3.4 Bcf/d.” It also reports that Strong economic growth, urbanization, and environmental policies supporting coal-to-natural gas switching in an effort to reduce air pollution and meet emissions targets all contributed to rapid growth in China’s natural gas consumption over the last decade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After becoming the world’s largest LNG importer in 2021, China’s LNG imports fell by 20% (2.0 Bcf/d) in 2022, mainly because of reduced demand and relatively high LNG spot prices. China’s LNG imports averaged 8.3 Bcf/d in 2022 — the least since 2019, according to data from China’s General Administration of Customs. In 2022, imports by pipeline offset some of the declines in LNG imports, increasing by 8% (0.4 Bcf/d) compared with 2021, mainly because of increased flows from Russia via the Power of Siberia pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has also turned to other nations for its long-range supplies of gas as well as than Russia. For example, China signed a 27-year agreement with Qatar on June 20, 2023, to supply China with a total of four million tons of liquified natural gas a year, and the China National Petroleum Corporation took a five percent stake in the expansion of Qatar’s North Field East gas production train — equaling a capacity of 8 million tons a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If China has any reason to secure its oil and gas supplies in any ways that create lasting dependence on Russia, they will grow out of China’s growing confrontation with the United States over Taiwan and other states rather than the war in Ukraine. China is vulnerable to attacks or interdiction by the United States and other regional powers, and to maritime interdiction to such imports through the Strait of Malacca — which is the second most serious chokepoint in the flow of oil and gas exports after the Strait of Hormuz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does give China an incentive to import oil and gas directly by pipeline from Russia, and by sea from the northern route through the Arctic. This helps explain why China might cooperate with Russia to fund a major new set of pipelines from Siberia to replace the pipelines that shipped gas to Europe and that would guarantee part of Russia’s export income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note that the U.S. Department of Defense’s annual unclassified report to Congress on China’s military power addressed this issue in some detail, although it noted that China already has other ways to bypass the Pacific:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China relies on maritime routes that transit the South China Sea and Strait of Malacca for most of its hydrocarbon deliveries. Approximately 76 percent of China’s oil imports and 23 percent of its total natural gas imports transit the South China Sea and Strait of Malacca. Despite China’s efforts to diversify energy suppliers, the sheer volume of oil and natural gas imported from Africa and the Middle East will make securing strategic maritime routes a priority for Beijing for at least the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Crude oil pipelines from Russia and Kazakhstan to China demonstrate China’s interest in increasing overland fuel supply. In 2021, China imported about 600,000 barrels per day of Russian crude oil via the East Siberia–Pacific Ocean pipeline, which has a total designed capacity of 1.6 million barrels per day. China also imports crude oil from Middle Eastern — primarily Saudi — and African suppliers via a crude oil pipeline across Burma. This 440,000-barrels-per-day pipeline bypasses the Strait of Malacca by transporting crude oil from Kyaukpyu, Burma, to Yunnan Province, China, and reduces shipping time by more than a third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2021, approximately 20 percent of China’s natural gas imports came from Turkmenistan via a pipeline that runs through Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This pipeline can transport 55 billion cubic meters per year; Turkmenistan and China are planning to expand it to 80 billion cubic meters per year. A natural gas pipeline connecting China to Burma can deliver 12 billion cubic meters per year, but only 4.1 billion cubic meters of gas was shipped in 2021. In early December 2020, the middle section of the China-Russia East natural gas pipeline — which is connected to the Power of Siberia pipeline — began operations, which will increase gas supply to 27 million cubic meters per day. The pipeline is projected to reach an annual capacity of 38 billion cubic meters per year by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As noted earlier, Russia already has pipelines to China, and creating a major new gas pipeline called the Power of Siberia 2 to export Russian natural gas from the Yamal Peninsula in Western Siberia to China was a one of the subjects discussed during President Xi’s meeting with President Putin in March 2023. Such a project was not approved, however, and studies of the pipeline’s cost and the revenues it would provide Russia have raised serious question about the benefits Russia would actually receive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, China faces other challenges that could lead it to avoid dependence on Russia. One is to reduce the cost of fossil fuel imports, and some reports indicate that China is now planning major investments in new coal-fired power plants using domestic coal. At the same time, China faces the same need to reduce carbon emissions as other developed states and may wish to avoid a long-term commitment to a Russian pipeline that would import some three times more gas that the Power of Siberia 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, China’s current dependence on oil and gas imports does not mean that China needs special trade relations, and pipelines and shipping routes, that make it dependent on Russia. Barring some massive new level of confrontation with other powers, or a war over Taiwan, it is likely to continue to tie the sources of its imports to the sources that provide the lowest market prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, the arguments for a major Chinese commitment to Russian energy supplies currently seem to be no more certain in the case of fossil fuels than in the other aspects of civil trade and investment. Moreover, even if major increases do take place in Russian energy exports to China, it seems unlikely that they will be on terms that would give Russia anything approaching the of income that would allow it to seriously decouple from the West, or lead China to integrate key aspects of the Chinese and Russian economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-impact-of-trends-in-the-russian-united-states-and-chinese-military-balance&quot;&gt;The Impact of Trends in the Russian, United States, and Chinese Military Balance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’ ability to create new forms of strategic and military ties to China are another possible way in which the war in Ukraine might increase Russia’s ties to China, make Russia less dependent on the current global economic system, and give Russia broader global military influence. Here again, however, China has different needs from Russia and reasons to place significant limits on any real-world strategic partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the previous data on military spending show, China’s growth in military spending, and in manufacturing and research and development capabilities, are rapidly making it modern global superpower. China is now competing with the United States and its strategic partners in military as well as in economic terms, and in finding ways to expand its global influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 6 has shown that China is now a much smaller nuclear power, but China does not need massive strategic forces to threaten U.S. cities with high levels of mutual assured destruction in a countervalue strike. Moreover, China is already deploying new ICBM fields and modern nuclear delivery systems. It seems to be on path that goes from deploying some 250 nuclear weapons to deploying 1,500 weapons — and possibly 2,000 including new theater nuclear warheads. China clearly has no current plans to have any kind of nuclear dependence on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent U.S. Department of Defense report on China’s military power summarizes China’s new nuclear efforts as follows, and they are clearly designed to give China a much higher level of nuclear capability and one that is not dependent on Russia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Over the next decade, the PRC aims to modernize, diversify, and expand its nuclear forces. Compared to the PLA’s nuclear modernization efforts a decade ago, current efforts exceed previous modernization attempts in both scale and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PRC is investing in and expanding the number of its land-, sea-, and air-based nuclear delivery platforms and constructing the infrastructure necessary to support this major expansion of its nuclear forces. The PRC is also supporting this expansion by increasing its capacity to produce and separate plutonium by constructing fast breeder reactors and reprocessing facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In 2021, Beijing probably accelerated its nuclear expansion. The Department of Defense estimates that the PRC’s operational nuclear warheads stockpile has surpassed 400.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The PLA plans to “basically complete modernization” of its national defense and armed forces by 2035. If China continues the pace of its nuclear expansion, it will likely field a stockpile of about 1500 warheads by its 2035 timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same seems true of China’s effort to increase the strength, readiness, and modernization of its conventional forces. Figure 18 shows that China was a much larger military power than Russia in conventional terms even before the Ukraine War began and Russia suffered major equipment losses. As the pervious analyses show, China also is the only power that has the economic strength to compete with the West in military spending, and in most measures of total economic strength, and it is making massive investments in military research and development, industries, facilities, and infrastructure that Russia cannot afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtually every assessment of Chinese conventional forces shown that China is making serious progress in virtually every area of military capability. China’s official statements indicate that China feels it will reach key levels of modernization as early as 2027 and is focused on a longer-term effort to match potential threats like the United States by a date like 2035 or 2040. These goals are described as realistic ones in the same unclassified report issued by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2022. It cites 2027 as the goal “to develop the capabilities to be a more credible military tool for the CCP to wield as it pursues Taiwan unification,” and 2035 as the goal to complete modernization of its national defense goals and armed forces” when “it could likely field a stockpile of about 1,500 weapons…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summary of this 2022 report also indicates that China is pursuing broader military goals, none of which make China dependent on Russia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Expanding PRC National Power to Transform International System&lt;/em&gt;: The PRC increasingly views the United States as deploying a whole-of-government effort meant to contain the PRC’s rise, which presents obstacles to its national strategy. The PRC’s strategy aims to achieve “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” by 2049 in a determined pursuit to amass its national power to transform an international system more favorable to the PRC’s political governance system and national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Increasing PRC Military Coercion&lt;/em&gt;: Over the course of 2021, and as seen in 2022, the CCP has increasingly turned to the PLA as an instrument of statecraft in support of its national strategy and global ambitions. The report highlights that the PLA has adopted more dangerous, coercive, and aggressive actions in the Indo-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strengthening PLA Nuclear, Space, and Counterspace Capabilities&lt;/em&gt;: The PRC has clearly stated its ambition to strengthen its “strategic deterrent,” and has continued to accelerate the modernization, diversification, and expansion of its nuclear forces, as well as the development of its space and counterspace capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intensifying Diplomatic, Economic, Political, and Military Pressure against Taiwan&lt;/em&gt;: The PLA will likely continue to increase military pressure — in concert with diplomatic, information, and economic pressure — in an attempt to compel Taiwan toward unification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no reliable unclassified data that provide a convincing picture of how far China has come in achieving parity or superiority in military manufacturing and R&amp;amp;D. China has clearly made major advances in many areas, but it might well still benefit from access to Russian military technology and weapons for at least the next decade. Here again, however, the report on Chinese military power helps put these trends in perspective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China is continuing to reorganize its defense, science, and commercial industries to ensure PLA access to the resources, technologies, and expertise required to militarily surpass the United States and develop capabilities for complex future military contingencies. China’s efforts include developing and incorporating military-AI and other emerging disruptive technologies (EDT) to build an “Intelligentized” force sufficiently equipped with high-tech weapons and advanced communications and information technologies to wage and win dynamic wars. While China’s Military-Civil Fusion (MCF) strategy supports acquisition of foreign materiel, technology, and expertise through overt and illicit means, China is also accelerating efforts to build domestic capacity in these areas and reduce its vulnerabilities to foreign supply chokepoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… China seeks to be an innovation superpower that is largely non-reliant on foreign technology and that serves as a global center for high-tech industries. The goal of attaining self-sufficiency in key S&amp;amp;T sectors — a theme of Chinese state plans going back decades — was recently reiterated in the 14 th Five-Year Plan. As part of this self-sufficiency drive, Beijing has mobilized its bureaucracies to rapidly develop the country’s capacity for domestic innovation. Published in 2006, the National Medium-and-Long-Term Plan for the Development of Science and Technology (2006-2020), was a landmark policy that formalized China’s push for domestic innovation while also calling for the assimilation and “re-innovation” of advanced foreign technologies. In 2015, with the Made In China 2025 plan, Beijing sharpened its emphasis on technological independence by establishing import substitution quotas across a range of core technologies. The plan also called for the reform of state-owned enterprises, the establishment of regional innovation centers, and the leveraging of private sector capabilities in order to leapfrog foreign technological competitors and create a superior innovation ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;China is particularly focused on dominating a range of emerging, dual-use technologies that promise to be both disruptive and foundational for future economies; these technologies include AI, autonomous systems, smart city platforms, quantum technologies, biotechnology, and advanced materials and manufacturing. Beijing has a clear understanding of its S&amp;amp;T deficiencies, particularly China’s vulnerability and reliance on western companies for enabling technologies such as semiconductors, new materials, and in some cases basic research. In addition, Beijing aims to address the challenges present in growing its science and technology talent pool. As a result of these vulnerabilities, the PRC has focused their industrial policies and the country’s massive tech transfer apparatus in an effort to reduce these dependencies, ensure their resilience, and to become a market leader in emerging technologies. China also sustains high levels of R&amp;amp;D funding and offers significant subsidies to domestic companies working on frontier technologies, and has developed a focused effort to improve their domestic education, attract overseas Chinese talent, and attract foreign talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 13 has shown that China is still importing significant — if dropping — levels of Russian arms. It is important to note, however, that Russia increasingly lags in many of the technologies and manufacturing capabilities that China is now pursuing — something that has become clearer as Russia has had to import key components to replenish its weapons and military needs during the war in Ukraine. Like gas and oil imports, China might still welcome some new cooperative arrangements that it felt benefit China but does not seem dependent on such arrangement or in need of any strategic arrangement that would make or leave it dependent on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sharing-strategic-partners&quot;&gt;Sharing Strategic Partners?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for mutual strategic partners, China has not shown any open support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or made any arrangements that would commit China to actively providing military support to Russia in a conflict in Europe or outside Asia. China also has emphasized increasing economic and political influence over military influence in many of its relations with Russia — again emphasizing economic power over military power where its territorial claims are not directly involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A case in point is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which was founded in 2001, and is based in Beijing. Both China and Russia are members, and they have worked together to create the Shanghai Five group, and to create a Treaty on Deepening Military Trust in Border Regions that was signed by the heads of states of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan in Shanghai on April 26, 1996.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, the SCO includes eight members: China, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. There are four Observer States interested in acceding to full membership (Afghanistan, Belarus, Iran, and Mongolia) and six “Dialogue Partners” (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Turkey). In 2021, Iran started the accession process to become a full member, and Egypt, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia became dialogue partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the SCO have conducted joint military exercises, but they have focused on political, economic, and internal security issues, rather than on becoming a military alliance, and the SCO’s membership and observers have increased steadily with time and in ways that limit the possibility of making it into an integrated military force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also clear the Russia and China have to some extent become competitors for influence in Central Asia, and for dealing with associated powers. Russia also Russia continues to be India’s major source and arms and China and India have repeated border clashes and have built-up their military forces in the border area. They compete at some level for influence in Iran and while they do not necessarily compete in many other areas, Russia focuses on military presence, the use of military paramilitary efforts and mercenaries like the Wagner forces, and spoiler operations that affect U.S. and Western military interests, while China gives priority to economic cooperation, military access, and political and economic influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-probable-limits-to-russian-and-chinese-strategic-cooperation-and-military-ties&quot;&gt;The Probable Limits to Russian and Chinese Strategic Cooperation and Military Ties&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one looks at each country’s military needs, both Russia and China have strong incentives not to deploy conventional military forces in the other nation’s wars or major military confrontations that are far from their own main areas of strategic interest, and for reasons that only meet the interest of the other partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have even less reason to risk escalation to nuclear warfare, given the risk of escalation to truly massive destruction, and the fact that any nuclear war that involved the United States could be so destructive that China or Russia would gain far more from staying out of the war and becoming the surviving superpower than by participating in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This in no way means, however, that China and Russia cannot cooperate strategically in many ways on a global basis in area like grey area wars, use of bases and facilities, and limited theater conflicts. They have already done so in a number of ways. They have conducted an increasing number of joint military exercises since 2005, many in the Northwestern Pacific and areas near Japan, before the war began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detailed chronology of these exercises in Figure 19, which is taken from work for CSIS by Richard Weitz, predates the war in Ukraine, but it shows that such an exercise in Russia’s Eastern Military District in September 2018 did reach comparatively high force levels: Russia deployed some 300,000 personnel, 1,000 aircraft, and 36,000 tanks and armored vehicles; China contributed 3,200 personnel, 900 tanks and armored vehicles, and 30 aircraft and helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most other large Russian and Chinese exercises, however, involved a range of countries other than China and had only limited Chinese participation. One in September 2019 in Russia’s central military district had some 130,000 Russian troops but only 1,600 Chinese troops and participants from six other countries including India. One in September 2020 in Russia’s military district near the Caspian and Black Seas involved 80,000 Russian troops, but no Chinese troops except for a joint director’s department, joint campaign command post, synthetic battle group, command and support team, aftermarket support team, and health and anti-epidemic team. It had nine other countries participating or observing, including Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China have continued such exercises in 2022 and 2023 and seem likely to do so in the future. A Tas announcement of a June 2023 exercise described the exercise plan as follows, although it conspicuously noted that the Chinese Defense Ministry had no comment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Russian military plans to participate in the North. Interaction-2023 exercises organized by China, the Chinese Defense Ministry said on Friday.… General Liu Zhenli, chief of staff of the Joint Staff Department of the Central Military Commission, spoke by phone with Army General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, the Chinese ministry said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The sides exchanged views on the implementation of the consensus that had been reached by the heads of the two states and the deepening of cooperation between the military of the two countries,” the statement said. “The sides jointly reaffirmed that Russia, responding to an invitation, will take part in the North. Interaction-2023 exercises organized by China.”… The Chinese ministry didn’t elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Chinese Defense Ministry on Tuesday said that Russian Aerospace Forces and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Air Force conducted their sixth joint air patrol over the Sea of Japan and the East China Sea. Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu said at the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference in Singapore on June 4th that the China would continue to deepen bilateral and multilateral exchanges as part of international military cooperation and participate in joint military exercises with Russia and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia and China have also played a joint role in exercises in areas as distant as South Africa and Iran since the war in Ukraine began. Here again, the U.S. Department of Defense report on China’s military power provides a unique official U.S. estimate of the strategic impact of Russo-Chinese military cooperation. It indicates that none of it focuses on the West. It indicates such activity focuses on the Artic and energy, exercises in northeast Asia, and cooperation in military technology, but at levels that fall far sort of any integration, mutual security guarantees, or cooperation related to the war in Ukraine. It is also only a small portion of the report’s analysis of China’s military relations with other states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The PRC’s expanding Arctic engagement has created new opportunities for engagement between the PRC and Russia. Russian Foreign Minister referred to the PRC as Russia’s “priority partner” in the Arctic. In April 2019, China and Russia established the Sino-Russian Arctic Research Center. PRC and Russia plans to use this center to conduct a joint expedition to research optimal routes of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and climate change were probably limited due to a continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In mid-2021, during a virtual summit between PRC President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the PRC and Russia agreed to deepen cooperation in the Arctic and strengthen collaboration on the use of the NSR. The PRC and Russia support further cooperation on commercial issues, energy development, and infrastructure projects such as the Yamal LNG project in north-central Siberia and LNG 2, a notional second natural gas plant which Russia and the PRC signed agreements for in 2018. In 2019, Russia and China also agreed to found a joint Arctic research center, furthering their academic cooperation alongside economic measures. As of late 2021, PRC banks agreed to provide 2.5 billion rubles, although the PRC continued to raise the issues of Yamal LNG dividend taxation. However, some limitations and potential bilateral friction points remain. In 2019 and in 2022, Russia proposed regulations governing the passage along the Northern Sea Route, which would have required foreign warships to give Moscow 45 days’ notice of their intention to transit and to have a Russian pilot on board, and would have reserved Moscow the right to refuse passage. Additionally, Russian experts have noted private Russian objections to China’s “Polar Silk Road” concept, saying it undermines a Russian-led Northern Sea Route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The PRC is also increasing its presence in the Antarctic through scientific projects, commercial ventures, and infrastructure and capability investments, likely intended to strengthen its position for future claims to natural resources and maritime access. The PRC’s strategy for Antarctica includes the use of dual-use technologies, facilities, and scientific research, which are likely intended, at least in part, to improve PLA capabilities. Beijing’s 2015 National Security Law identifies polar regions, along with deep sea and outer space, as areas for development and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China-Russia Relations.&lt;/strong&gt; Throughout 2021, Russia and the PRC continued to broaden their strategic diplomatic, informational, military and economic cooperation, primarily aimed countering the United States. PRC leaders, including PRC President Xi Jinping, have reiterated on multiple occasions the strength and commitment toward sustaining Sino-Russian relations. In August 2021, more than 13,000 Russian and Chinese military personnel reportedly conducted joint land and air operations within Chinese territory as part of Western Joint 2021. China and Russia probably used their participation in WESTERN JOINT/ZAPAD INTERACTION 2021 to signal the strength of Sino-Russian cooperation rather than to improve interoperability. Separately, both navies conducted joint operations in the Sea of Japan in October 2021 as part of Joint Sea 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The PRC and Russia likely perceive further cooperation between the two militaries, including joint defense technology development, exercises, and other military modernization initiatives, as advantageous to their respective interests. Ahead of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on February 4, 2022, PRC President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin released a joint statement underscoring China and Russia’s commitment to “deepening strategic coordination of mutual support.” The PRC has maintained rhetorical and diplomatic alignment with Russia before, following, and during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Despite on-going military cooperation, the PRC and Russia continue to stop short of characterizing its partnership as a formal alliance with mutual security guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan also provides a useful official description of the Russian build-up near Japan as follows in detail in its 2022 Defense White Paper. And, describes a growing level of Russo-Chinese cooperation in the region, but one that again is comparatively limited in scope:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In recent years, Russia and China have been increasing cooperation in the military sector. In the past, there was tension between the Soviet Union and China, including militarily, with the two countries experiencing, among other incidents, the Sino-Soviet border conflict in 1969. Since the 1980s, the two countries have been gradually improving relations. As a catalyst event for the normalization of relations in May 1989, in what had been a pending issue in the relations between the two countries, the work of demarcating borders was resumed (demarcated conclusively in 2008). In parallel with such work, efforts including the reduction of forces in border regions in accordance with agreements have been implemented to establish the foundation of proximity between the countries that can be seen today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 2003 Russia and China conducted their first joint counter-terrorism military exercise “Cooperation 2003” of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which was established with the framework for border demarcation, with Russia incorporating countries of the former Soviet Union, Central Asian countries, and China as the parent body. In 2005 the two countries renamed the exercise “Peace Mission” and have been implementing the joint counter-terrorism military exercise. The two countries have also been conducting “Joint Sea” joint naval exercises since 2012. From the outset, there have been years where “Peace Mission” exercises were implemented together with Central Asian countries, and years where the exercises were implemented by only China and Russia. In recent years, India and Pakistan, which have become new SCO member countries, have also been participating, therefore it can be considered that a focus of the exercises is the enhancement of military capabilities of Central Asian countries, keeping in mind the strengthening of military ties between Eurasian countries, centering on Russia and China, and the situation in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While Joint Sea activities have been identified as “inward-facing” to allow Russia and China to ascertain the other’s naval capabilities, the activities may also be considered “outward facing,” demonstrating the cooperation and interests of each to third countries in waters where their respective interests are significant, with the exercises conducted not only in the Sea of Japan, East China Sea, Yellow Sea and other waters of major activity for both the Russian Pacific Fleet and People’s Liberation Army Navy, the main participating units in the exercises, but also in the Mediterranean Sea in 2015, South China Sea in 2016, and Baltic Sea in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In recent years, cooperation between Russia China on the military front has become more conspicuous, as if to promote it as “strategic coordination” movements. For example, between 2018 and 2020, the People’s Liberation Army participated in Russia’s internal yearly strategic command and staff exercise, and in August 2021, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation participated in ZAPAD/INTERACTION-2021 bilateral strategic exercise within China for the first time. In addition, since 2019, Russia and China have conducted joint bomber flights in airspace over the Sea of Japan, East China Sea, and Pacific Ocean. In October 2021, the two countries implemented joint navigations for the first time by 10 naval vessels, mainly those vessels participating in the aforementioned “Joint Sea” exercises, which involved orbiting Japan. In November of the same year, joint flights were conducted with bombers from Russia and China, with Russian planes passing through Chinese airspace and Chinese planes passing though Russian airspace, each for the first time. The bombers advanced directly toward the Sea of Japan, and from the Sea of Japan to the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Appearing to substantiate the view that these actions are a strengthening of “strategic coordination,” in an online conference between the defense ministers of Russia and China in November 2021, the Russian side asserted that the increased frequency of activity by U.S. strategic bombers in the airspace adjacent to Russia’s is a threat not only for Russia but also for China. Alongside this, it was announced that the militaries of the two countries have agreed to strengthen their partnership relating to a “Joint Patrol,” which is believed to refer to bilateral strategic exercises, as well as the aforementioned joint flights and joint navigation. Furthermore, in January 2022 Russia and China announced that they had conducted joint naval training including Iran in the Arabian Sea. In May, three months into Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, the fourth joint flight with bombers from Russia and China was conducted in the skies over the Sea of Japan, the East China Sea, and the Pacific on the day of the Japan–US–Australia–India leaders’ summit in Tokyo. These moves show that the joint military activity between Russia and China is gradually expanding and shifting its focus from initial bilateral confidence-building in inner Eurasia to widely appealing their bilateral cooperation to the international community, including Japan, the United States, and Europe as “strategic coordination” in the waters on the periphery of Eurasia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the field of military technology, as well, it appears to be shifting from an emphasis on commercial interests seen in the 1990s with the export of Russian finished products to China to a deeper partnership on a strategic level, where a certain degree of trust is assumed, such as, as an example from recent years, support for the construction of a ballistic missile early warning system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In joint statements by Russia and China in February 2022, the two confirmed their mutually supportive stances regarding each other’s “core interests,” with China, following Russia, declaring its opposition to NATO’s further expansion, and Russia expressing respect for the “One China” policy and opposition to any form of Taiwanese independence. As evidenced throughout the statements, both Russia and China seem to remain ever mindful of the United States as a common competitor while advancing their cooperative relationship. On February 24, Russia launched an aggression against Ukraine, and while China has taken the stance that it is not concerned with Russia’s plans for aggression, it insists that Russia’s actions are caused by the “Cold War mentality” of the United States and other NATO countries without being critical of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;President Putin and General Secretary Xi Jinping at the Russia-China summit meeting held in Beijing on February 2, 2022, expressed the opinion that it understands Russia’s reasonable concerns in respect of security issues. As made clear by Russia’s actions this time, the mutual support of each other’s “core interests” indicated by Russia and China in their Comprehensive Strategic Partnership can be said to lead to a relationship in which one country condones the other’s aggression against other countries, that is, changing the status quo by force unilaterally, despite the fact that Russia and China are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, an organization that takes prime responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. From the standpoint of the security of Japan, this is not something that can be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While only one aspect of the bilateral relationship, Russia and China’s military cooperation is linked with the current international military situation, including the resurgence of the China-India border dispute and Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, which has led to the promotion of cooperation between Western countries. Therefore, it is considered to have various impacts on many fronts beyond the security environment of East Asia, the major area of focus of Russia and China’s military cooperation, such as relations between Russia and India, Europe’s recognition of China, and similar, and these developments need to be continually monitored with concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of “softer” Russo-Chinese cooperation may well grow in the future because of the broader confrontations between Russia and the West, and between China and the United States, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. There are many aspects of trade, military R&amp;amp;D and production, influence operations, and grey area competition, confrontation, and even low-level conflict where Russia can benefit, and often benefit from some form of cooperation with China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not, however, indicate that Russia can use China to find some way to decouple from the West, that China or Russia will take serious strategic risks for the other power, or that there is any clear link to new levels of close Chinese and Russian cooperation that will come out of fighting or end of the war in Ukraine. It is the uncertainties surrounding each power’s economic and military confrontation with the United States, other Western powers and their strategic partners, and their neighbor that might trigger some kind of unpredictable change.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;何啟明指戴耀廷倡「攬炒」不信對否決權解釋、無公開指施德來說法不代表黨因「冇諗過咁大鑊」&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;論壇提「打倒共產黨」 何啟明稱屬「憤慨之言」、信鄧小平說「共產黨是罵不倒」&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rx7eO5b.png&quot; alt=&quot;image01&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（5日）踏入審訊第79天。何啟明今繼續接受控方盤問，表示沒有收過戴耀廷發出的協調機制文件，亦不同意文件表明「會積極運用」否決權。法官質疑何也簽署了寫有「會運用」權力的「墨落無悔」聲明，為何不同意協調文件內容，何解釋理解「會積極運用」比「會運用」更積極，而雖然戴曾於協調會解釋「會積極運用」為「可用可不用」，但認為戴「本身就諗住（實踐）『攬炒十步曲』，所以我唔相信佢嘅解釋」，同意法官指戴解釋時是不誠實、無說出動機。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問民協曾否討論否決預算案迫政府回應五大訴求，何表示民協重視民生，不會無差別否決，或因「老奉」而「冇認真討論都唔出奇」。至於黨友施德來於論壇提「攬炒政府」和兩次否決預算案，何表示不同意，但沒公開表示其說法不代表民協，解釋當時「真係冇諗過會咁大鑊」，亦知道支持者「心水清」會分得清二人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;帖文提公帑不能再落入警隊-何啟明解釋僅反對追加撥款&quot;&gt;帖文提公帑不能再落入警隊 何啟明解釋僅反對追加撥款&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前民協副主席何啟明今繼續接受盤問。他昨稱無收過戴耀廷於首次九西會議後兩日發出的「35+九西」文件，主控萬德豪今展示該份「民主派九西協調機制（初稿）」，何重申無收過。被問會上有否討論初稿內容，何指就第一點凡認同「五大訴求、缺一不可」及35+均可參與協調機制，「呢個唔駛討論㗎」，指會議無討論過但他同意；至於第二點「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，何指他不同意否決財案迫特首回應五大訴求，而會上有提過但無詳細討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續引何啟明初選後發布的帖文，提及「警暴橫行欺壓市民，公帑絕不能有一分一毫再落入惡貫滿盈的警隊手上；否決對犯罪組織的任何撥款，從來都不是策略問題，而是立場問題」，問何是否不會同意任何有警隊撥款的財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何同意「有咁寫過」，解釋他當時強調要追究警暴問題，而在追究之前「我唔同意撥款警隊」。李追問即只要預算案有警察撥款，他就會反對？何說「呢個要分清楚」，指警隊一直都有「恆常出糧」，但「我係反對佢再加任何撥款畀警察」，帖文「一分一毫」亦是指額外撥款，「例如要再買水炮車嘅話，咁我真係唔會喇」，強調仍是要看清預算案內容才決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指，何的用字似乎不是那麼明顯（explicit）。何同意「如果你淨係睇呢一篇，其實就或者未必睇到」，認為是「用字問題」，但重申他是上述理解。何其後又補充，即使否決預算案，政府仍可有臨時撥款繼續營運、警隊仍能繼續運作，「所以我唔能夠透過否決財政預算案令到警察冇糧出或者一蚊都攞唔到。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/ujLqeNr.png&quot; alt=&quot;image02&quot; /&gt;
▲ 何啟明&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑何啟明若簽墨落-為何不同意協調文件提會積極運用否決權&quot;&gt;官質疑何啟明若簽「墨落」 為何不同意協調文件提「會積極運用」否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於初稿其他內容有否討論，何啟明指兩次會議均沒討論會進行選前民調，也沒提過香港民意研究所或鍾庭耀；目標議席數目亦無決定取4席，是選完後再決定。陳慶偉問，那所有項目在九西協調會議結束後，是否都已解決（resolve）？何指不知最後定稿，因沒收過文件，並指會議有討論用靈童制抑或遞補機制，但沒有結論、初稿亦無提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何亦表示，就第二點「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，「真係唔係個個認同」。法官李運騰指該點與「墨落無悔」相似，只是初稿提「會積極運用」、「墨落無悔」是「會運用」，有些人甚至認為「會積極」較溫和，問何同意該點的內容嗎？何說「我不同意」。陳仲衡續指，但初稿與「墨落」同樣使用「包括否決預算案」字眼、何亦談及過對此的理解（即可用一系列權力，不限於否決財案），何啟明回應他當時不知道字眼的運用，是後來看文件才得悉有「會積極」和「會」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續指，但該點甚至比「墨落無悔」溫和，若何願意簽署「墨落」，為何會不同意該點？辯方大律師阮偉明一度站起，指這是假設何啟明知道兩個字眼的分別。惟陳慶偉指「會」或「會積極」不重要，重要的是何曾供稱「包括否決預算案」其實指「不包括否決預算案」，若他願簽「墨落無悔」，那：「你一定會同意初稿的第二點！」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱理解會積極比會更積極指戴耀廷想攬炒十步不信其就字眼解釋&quot;&gt;何稱理解「會積極」比「會」更積極、指戴耀廷想攬炒十步不信其就字眼解釋&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明回應：「因為我理解『會積極』係更加積極，比起『會』，即係更加積極去 veto 個 budget。」被告欄內的梁國雄邊聽邊點頭。陳慶偉續指，但何昨同意在第二次會議上岑子杰反對否決權後，戴曾提議用「會積極」字眼，即「可用可不用」。何同意，指當時戴提及「攬炒十步曲」而岑子杰反對，其他人也沒太大反應，「咁然後戴耀廷就『轉軚』啦，話其實都係可以用可以唔用嘅，但係我真係唔信佢。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，「我讀過區諾軒的證供很多次」，指區稱戴在首次會議已曾提過「會積極」運用否決權。何同意戴在首兩次會議均有解釋「會積極運用」的意思，李運騰問既然如此，他同意初稿第二點嗎？何說：「我都係唔認同，因為係戴耀廷講嘅，因為佢本身就諗住攬炒十步曲，所以我唔相信佢嘅解釋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰笑着問，所以何認為戴耀廷一直都想實踐「攬炒十步」，故他解釋「會積極」為「可用可不用」時，他是不誠實（dishonest）、沒有說出他真正的動機？何答「你可以咁講」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何同意協議與墨落無悔用字接近-官稱墨提撤銷控罪比協議提特赦更進一步&quot;&gt;何同意協議與「墨落無悔」用字接近 官稱「墨」提撤銷控罪比協議提特赦更進一步&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明續在盤問下，表示無從戴耀廷收過有關第二次會議時間地點的訊息，他是從區諾軒收到。至於戴第二次會議兩日後發出「35+九西final」文件，並表示「這是最終的協調文件」，何也沒收過。控方其後展示該份「民主派九龍西協調機制協議」，問參與者是否就協議內容達成共識，何指會上無就使用靈童制達成共識，亦無討論民調。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官再比較初稿和協議有關否決權的段落，其中初稿提及：「會積極運用立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首特赦抗爭者、令相關人士為警暴問責、及重啟政改」，協議則為：「會積極運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求，特赦抗爭者、叫相關人士為警暴問責、及重啟政改以達雙普選。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何同意後者加上迫使特首回應「五大訴求」及達雙普選，用字與「墨落無悔」更接近。陳慶偉續指出，而「墨落」提到「撤銷所有抗爭者控罪」而非「特赦抗爭者」，是「更進一步（one step further）」，即在抗爭者定罪前或被控前便要撤銷控罪，而非定罪後再赦。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱4項共識簡單-無文件訊息提及不奇怪&quot;&gt;何稱4項共識簡單 無文件訊息提及不奇怪&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方和法官其後追問，何啟明在協調會議沒收過有關初選計劃或討論事項的文件、亦沒收過任何訊息或文件提及達成了的共識，不覺得奇怪嗎？何說「唔奇怪」，「因為大家討論真係唔使文件」，而且「4樣嘢（共識）好簡單咋嘛，兩個（辦初選和論壇）係『有冇』嘅問題」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再追問，會上有否傳閱「35+計劃」文件，李運騰亦指區諾軒曾供稱首次會議有傳閱，何搖頭答：「可能我遲到我 miss 咗喎，我真係冇印象有呢樣嘢」，並同意他參與的是「無紙會議（paperless meeting）」。控方續指出，何實收到了所有相關文件，何不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱民協不同意否決財案迫特首回應五大訴求會視否財案內容決定&quot;&gt;何稱民協不同意否決財案迫特首回應五大訴求、會視否財案內容決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就民協的立場，何啟明指民協對「墨落無悔」聲明「冇立場」，至於就否決預算案，「民協就係會睇返財政預算案嘅內容再作決定。」李運騰問，即民協不同意「墨落無悔」？何指是不同意否決預算案迫特首回應五大訴求，而他於群組曾講及自己對「墨落無悔」的理解，黨「冇乜反對意見」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪追問，民協有就否決預算案迫使政府回應五大訴求討論嗎？何指「就咁呢個 statement 我就唔記得有喇」，萬追問即有沒有，何手指向萬說：「嗱，呢句你話有討論過咩先？」萬重申是否決預算案迫使回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續說：「呢句句子我真係唔記得有冇，亦都唔肯定」，重申每次都會據預算案內容討論。萬遂提高聲量問，無差別否決預算案會影響香港居民生活，若有討論會是很大的事（very very big issue）？何同意是大事，並反問他向民協成員講述對「墨落無悔」的理解，而他們「冇乜反應」，「咁樣算唔算一個討論？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問黨曾否討論否決財案-何稱民協重視民生或老奉冇討論唔出奇&quot;&gt;被問黨曾否討論否決財案 何稱民協重視民生或「老奉」、「冇討論唔出奇」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪和法官李運騰追問，那在2020年3月至7月期間，還有其他場合討論過嗎？何指他在九西第二次協調會議後，曾簡單匯報會上有提過用否決權，「但大家都係話咁再討論啦。」控方質疑，何沒有將會上積極運用否決權的議題帶回民協討論，何邊攤出左手邊答：「或者咁樣講，其實民協一路都係咁重視民生，我覺得有啲嘢可能真係老奉咗，佢哋唔需要討論喎——『唔會』囉！所以我哋每次就住財政預算案嘅立場，咪就係睇返財政預算案嘅內容囉！所以可能真係咁冇認真討論都唔出奇喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬兩度追問，那何印象中有無討論過？何重申：「我之前都講過我同民協嘅立場係唔會咁做嘅，咁呢啲冇討論真係唔出奇喎！」，又說「我真係唔肯定，我只能夠話畀你聽我嘅立場同民協嘅立場」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪欲再追問，惟陳慶偉打斷說：「Thank you, move on.」李運騰改問何有否與團隊討論，指否決預算案似乎當時是熱門話題（hot topic），何指有，形容與助理對話很簡單，就是因為重視民生，故民協「係唔會隨便咁否決一個財政預算案」，反對無差別以否決權迫特首回應五大訴求。陳仲衡問他有沒有想過這是民協在選舉中的賣點或弱點，何指當時認為「兩個都有可能」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱施德來論壇發言前無通知-認會感驚訝&quot;&gt;何稱施德來論壇發言前無通知 認會感驚訝&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明昨表示，就施德來論壇稱民協入議會會兩次否決預算案，是其個人看法，不代表他和民協立場。何今在盤問下表示，沒有與施討論過他不會否決預算案，施亦沒向他提過對「墨落無悔」的理解及會否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引施在論壇的發言：「我哋冇討論嘅空間，冇談判嘅餘地，只有抗爭到底。入到議會裏面，我哋大家都要否決財政預算案，大家都要否決政府所有議案，同呢個政府抗爭到底，攬炒呢個政府」、「今日嘅民協入到議會裏面，我哋一定會兩次否決《財政預算案》，入到議會裏面，今日係要抗爭，唔抗爭嘅就行開」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rWDtrCw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;
▲ 施德來（資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何表示，施發言前沒有通知他，其說法亦非民協立場。萬德豪問，那何對施的說法感到驚訝嗎？何笑着問：「你問緊我心情啊？」，旁聽席傳來笑聲。李運騰重申問題，指何已認識施一段時間，他對施的說法感到驚訝嗎？何答「都會嘅」，並確認他不同意施稱兩次否決預算案和攬炒政府。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;被問民協支持者是否左右為難-何知道九西選民心水清會分得清&quot;&gt;被問民協支持者是否左右為難 何：知道九西選民心水清會分得清&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，有趣的是，如何啟明和施德來同時當選，兩人就否決預算案的投票就會不同。何說：「如果真係根據字面咁，係真係會出現呢個情況。」萬德豪再指，何和施是民協唯二候選人，何稱不會否決預算案，但施就說會？何答：「所以我唔知點解佢咁講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉說，那民協支持者就會左右為難（torn between two lovers）了，何回應：「因為我哋分開九西同九東選嘅，而我知道九龍西嘅選民都係啲心水清嘅選民，會分得清我同阿來。」李運騰問，所以他們是何的支持者，而不是施的支持者？何答：「係㗎，因為好多票都係一啲關係票嚟㗎。」陳仲衡指若然如此則無需參加初選了，何答：「咁我哋係民主派啊嘛，同埋事前真係唔知施德來會咁樣講。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱對施德來發言無興趣當時真係冇諗過會咁大鑊&quot;&gt;何稱對施德來發言無興趣：當時真係冇諗過會咁大鑊&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何在盤問下表示，他沒有告訴公眾施德來的說法不代表民協，而他不知道施為何這樣說、事後也沒有問。萬德豪追問他不會有興趣知道施為何說出與黨立場相違的話嗎？何笑說「我當時真係冇乜興趣」，指當時已完成論壇、亦有很多選舉工作，「我又清楚知道民協嘅支持者會分得出我同阿來，同埋當時真係冇諗過會咁大鑊㗎嘛，所以冇真係公開地話佢講嘅野唔符合黨囉」，鄒家成、陳志全等發笑。萬最後指，何沒有問施的原因，是因為這也是何的立場，何答：「呢個非常不同意。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡追問，《國安法》實施後，何啟明不會擔心施德來會說出類似的話令他或黨有麻煩嗎？何指「我當時冇咁諗」，因越來越近初選「都係專注返自己嘅選舉工作」。至於初選之後，何表示「咁阿來都輸咗，所以我就冇再講」，控方追問但施說的仍代表黨立場？何說：「冇理到啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件下午續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e5Mukg1.png&quot; alt=&quot;image05&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（5日）踏入審訊第79天。何啟明繼續接受盤問，就初選論壇的發言作出解釋。對於論壇提及「打倒共產黨」，何啟明指是批評中共無兌現《基本法》承諾的「憤慨之言」，又指社會很多人講「打倒共產黨」講了數十年，當時《國安法》亦未實施，他相信鄧小平稱「共產黨是罵不倒的」。何又強調「攬炒嘅係中共」，指《國安法》令股市跌、令市民有恐懼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;對於論壇表示民協「唔會同呢個極權有咩嘢好傾」，何指「極權」是指港府而非中央，直言「中央政府唔會同我哋傾」；又解釋要展示堅定形象，但認為政治本質仍避不了「傾」。法官問即虛偽是關鍵？何稱由選民決定。何亦曾提及要令立會成為政府及保皇黨「地獄」，他解釋以往民主派是少數，即使議案有建設性亦被「熄咪、趕出會議廳」，望「建制派經歷返民主派經歷過嘅嘢」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇表示與極權冇咩好傾-何稱指香港政府中央政府唔會同我哋傾&quot;&gt;論壇表示與極權「冇咩好傾」 何稱指香港政府：中央政府唔會同我哋傾&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;主控萬德豪下午就何啟明於2020年6月九西選舉論壇的發言提問。其中何啟明被馮達浚問民協以往「又傾又砌」，今時今日是否摒棄此主張，何答：「唔係，呢個好清楚㗎喇，我哋面對呢個極權呢，佢就係不斷嚟到打壓我哋，所以反抗係我哋唯一嘅出路，我哋唔會同呢個極權有咩嘢好傾㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問「極權」是指香港政府？何答「係」。萬問也指中國政府？何說：「我記得呢一句嗰陣時係講緊⋯應該係講緊特區政府㗎啫，因為中央政府唔會同我哋傾」，鄒家成和林卓廷等發笑，何再說：「我哋傾嘅對象⋯⋯中央政府都唔會睬我哋啦。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱論壇上要展示堅定形象政治本質避不了傾-虛偽與否由選民決定&quot;&gt;何稱論壇上要展示堅定形象、政治本質避不了「傾」 虛偽與否由選民決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡續指，何啟明「唔會同呢個極權有咩好傾㗎啦」一句，與施德來論壇稱「冇討論嘅空間，冇談判嘅餘地」很相似。何不同意，指他是回應馮達浚的問題，指「民協畀人鬧咗三十年『又傾又砌』，啫係話我哋搖擺不定、話我哋騎牆」，而他要短時間回應馮達浚，「就要喺最短嘅時間展示返民協係一個堅定嘅民主派，所以話『冇嘢好傾』」，但何強調，「呢個係一個形象上嘅展示，我哋要明白政治嘅本質就係有『傾』呢個過程。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，所以當何說「冇嘢好傾」時，並沒有這個意思？何說：「呢個係政治嘅本質，你避免唔到『傾』呢樣嘢。」李指現時不是發表演說的時候，只是想理解何當時的想法，並問即何內心深處是認為仍要「傾」？何同意。控方質疑他沒說出來，何重申「我要回應佢嗰個形象嘅攻擊嘛」，因此要表明是堅定民主派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再問，即何不是說他真心相信的話？何答「唔係」，重申「呢個政治本質係咁，你形象要堅定，但你要明白個操作真係避免唔到『傾』」。李再問，即虛偽就是關鍵？（“Hypocrisy is the key?”）何說：「我覺得我係希望⋯⋯將民協嘅形象定位喺一個堅定嘅民主派啦，至於係咪虛偽呢，咁選民就自行決定喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪說，但何可以直接回應他不是騎牆派。何語速稍快說：「有好多個選擇嘅如果要答嘅話，咁我當時時間短，佢問我係咪『又傾又砌』，我就答佢『冇嘢好傾』，唔係更加中 point 咩，我覺得係喎。」鄒家成和李予信等發笑。萬德豪指，何說的話實與施德來的立場一致，何不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;稱令立會成保皇黨地獄-何稱民主派曾被熄咪等-要建制派有同樣經歷&quot;&gt;稱令立會成保皇黨地獄 何稱民主派曾被熄咪等 要建制派有同樣經歷&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引何啟明於論壇提及達到35+「我哋要令到立法會成為呢個政府同埋保皇黨嘅地獄」。何解釋，「咁以往民主派係少數，我哋畀人熄咪、我哋畀人趕出會議廳，咁35+我哋係多數，咪我哋熄返佢咪，我哋趕返佢哋出去囉。」多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問即癱瘓政府？何說「冇呢個意思」，解釋「以往呢民主派少數呢，無論我哋嘅提議幾咁有建設性、幾咁有意義呀，我哋都唔會得到重視，結果就係畀人熄咪、畀人趕出會議廳，甚有啲唔合法嘅程序都可以繼續落去㗎，所以其實對我哋嚟趕係真係好憤怒」，並確認「我哋」是指「民主派」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，故何認為以往民主派遭受不公義（injustice），他們就要做同樣的事？何指「趕佢哋出去、熄佢哋咪」是過半後可以做的事情的例子，「但係我冇話我哋會變成佢哋一樣咁唔公義」，「我諗係要建制派經歷返民主派經歷過嘅嘢囉，但唔一定會變得不公義。」被問民協議員曾否被熄咪、趕走，何說不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱攬炒嘅係中共-指國安法令股市跌令市民生恐懼&quot;&gt;何稱「攬炒嘅係中共」 指《國安法》令股市跌、令市民生恐懼&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續引何啟明於論壇被主持問到，民協簽署「攬炒」的「墨落無悔」聲明，但攬炒受傷最大的是基層，若深水埗居民有天要求民協放棄抗爭，否則就放棄民協，「你會選擇背棄堅定抗爭聲明，定係背棄深水埗嘅支持者？」何當時表示深水埗居民眼睛很雪亮：「而家攬炒係邊個，攬炒係中共呀嘛，有《國安法》，股市先跌喎⋯⋯有《國安法》，真係會有個中國特務走嚟搶你啲魚、搶你啲菜，話係國家安全，佢做乜都得噶喎，所以真正令到香港經濟差、真正令到基層市民生活苦，嗰個係共產黨，係呢個極權社會，係呢個極權政府」，並指街坊都明白，「我哋真係要出嚟抗爭，我哋真係要出嚟反抗喎。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪質疑，何啟明一直表示關注深水埗基層，不認為當時是黃金機會告知公眾他無意否決預算案嗎？何表示：「我覺得呢個係黃金機會講『我唔同意攬炒』，因為主持問題係『攬炒』」，又指當時主持稱簽「墨落無悔」就是攬炒，但「我唔認同『攬炒』，我亦唔認同嗰份抗爭聲明係攬炒，因為我覺得攬炒嘅係中共」。李運騰問，問題是如果抗爭和民生之間有兩難，他會如何取捨？何表示若抗爭派與民生如此對立，便會視乎預算案內容與民協商討再決定，重申主持刻意將攬炒與民生對立，故他就表明「真正攬炒嘅係呢個中共」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指「一隻手掌拍唔響（“It takes two to tango.”）」，何再重申是「中共攬炒導致到民生差」，指「因為有《國安法》，股市跌」。李問何真的如此相信？何指當時記得「吹風出嚟話會有《國安法》，股市真係跌，跟住『國家隊（內地資金）』進場先升返」，多人大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再問，那何提及中國特務搶魚和菜，也是真的有發生嗎？再引來哄堂大笑。何解釋是「同街坊傾偈得出嚟嘅結論」，指當時說法是《國安法》凌駕一切香港法例，「大家就會有一個恐懼，當恐懼去到極致嘅時候，大家就會諗咗呢啲嘢出嚟。」李問所以這是想像，多於其個人經驗？何同意「字面上咁我真係冇經歷過呢啲」，但他是在說街坊的憂慮。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱無民主就無民生-政府人民所選才會回應訴求&quot;&gt;何稱無民主就無民生 政府人民所選才會回應訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李再問，故在抗爭與民生只能選一樣，何啟明會怎樣選擇？李又問何稱會以民生為先，在其發言何處看到？何表示：「因為我相信沒有民主，就沒有民生」，惟陳慶偉打斷着他回答問題。何續解釋，他發言時表示明白街坊生活困苦，而要改變就要告訴他們，令大家生活困苦的是極權政府，並要出來反抗。他又提到「墨落無悔」亦提及爭取雙普選，「有民主就有民生喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉質疑，何事實上是着重抗爭多於民生，萬德豪亦問，何認為民主比民生更重要？何否認，表示：「我係話有民主先會有民生，因為個政府要係人民選出嚟，佢先會回應人民嘅訴求。」萬指，即何啟明優先爭取民主？何答：「因為喺而家嘅處境冇民主，所以要爭取民主囉。」萬再追問，是以民生為代價（at the expense of livelihood）？何答：「唔係，冇講過。」萬最後指，何意圖否決預算案爭取民主，何不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;論壇說打倒共產黨-何稱無意打倒信鄧小平說共產黨是罵不倒的&quot;&gt;論壇說「打倒共產黨」 何稱無意打倒、信鄧小平說「共產黨是罵不倒的」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續指，何啟明表示中國政府是極權政府，何表示「我係話⋯⋯共產黨」，惹來哄堂大笑。萬指中共是中國執政黨，故何啟明是反對政權？何回應是指「不輕易順從」。李運騰指，但何在論壇亦曾提及「一定就係出嚟打倒共產黨」，並不只是不順從。何回應是「憤慨之言」、「對共產黨嘅批評」，解釋因中共「由『8.31條例（人大8.31決定）』去到《國安法》」，均「冇兌現返佢喺基本法嘅承諾」，「同埋我相信鄧小平話『共產黨是罵不倒』的」，多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，何無意打倒共產黨，實可以只說「一定要出嚟批評共產黨」，但何卻選擇了用「打倒」一字，何同意「我係揀咗呢個字」。李運騰指那不是何唯一提及「打倒共產黨」之處，控方續引何被問如何運用議會資源結合街頭抗爭，亦曾回答可「請手足」來「生生不息對抗極權」，「打倒共產黨」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪問何是否與「手足」一起打倒共產黨，何否認，解釋在選舉論壇「要短時間內 appeal to（吸引）群眾，係會運用選舉語言」，同意法官指是「誇張法（hyperbole）」，又指「當時嘅社會有好多人講咗『打倒共產黨』講咗幾十年」，且當時《國安法》未正式實施故這樣說。何強調，「我用『打倒』呢真係唔係諗住打倒，係真係一個批評嘅意思，情形就好似你真係憤慨嘅時候你講粗口，你都唔係真係嗰個意思咁樣」，林卓廷哈哈大笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;萬德豪續問，《國安法》後，何有否告訴公眾他無意打倒共產黨？何表示「我諗住過咗去就算，就冇解釋喇」，又指「因為我記得好似話7月1號之前嘅嘢就唔會追究」。萬最後指，何有意打倒共產黨，《國安法》前後均意圖透過否決預算案推翻政府，何不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第78天。前民協副主席何啟明今繼續作供，就昨稱簽「墨落無悔」但無意否決預算案，法官質疑選民不會知道他對聲明的理解，又問為何不另發不提否決權的聲明。何指理解民協支持者都不會支持無差別否決預算案，「我有我嘅理解，我又明白民協嘅支持者會明白我嘅理解，所以我唔覺得有需要再澄清，而事後我真係贏到初選。」法官陳慶偉質疑，何最終勝出或因簽署了「墨落無悔」，選民因聲明表面意思投票給他，何說：「我只能夠話呢個係你嘅分析，因為選民投票可以基於好多原因。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;而就提名表格提及支持「民主派35+公民投票計劃」及其目標，何今表示理解計劃「目標」只是民主派立會過半，不包括五大訴求，指五大訴求是取得35+之後才爭取。控方質疑，立會過半後民主派議員要用相同的「大殺傷力憲制武器」（否決權）才能迫政府回應五大訴求，何稱「唔一定」，認為過半後政府需與民主派商討，議員又可提問和修訂議案等，政府要回應訴求。他亦不同意「墨落無悔」的「共同綱領」指無差別否決預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;昨稱不會否決財案-何啟明今補充若當選會據財案內容與黨商討再決定&quot;&gt;昨稱不會否決財案 何啟明今補充若當選會據財案內容與黨商討再決定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明昨就「墨落無悔」作供，表示自己支持聲明內容並簽署，並理解「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」一句指可運用「一系列權力」，簽署者可選擇是否運用，而他本人不會否決財政預算案。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明今主動補充，昨日意思是在「墨落無悔」的語境下不會運用否決權，「我唔會用呢個權力（否決權）去迫使特首回應五大訴求」；但即使如此，「我哋都要面對一個現實，無論政府回唔回應五大訴求，我哋都要就住財政預算案作出表態」，故他若當選立法會議員，「我就會根據返財政預算案嘅內容，同民協商討再作決定。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何昨稱簽署「墨落無悔」前，曾在有施德來在內的民協中央黨團群組討論，他今指群組不多於10人。法官陳仲衡及李運騰問，何有沒有將他對「墨落無悔」的理解告知黨友？何表示有，但「詳細內容係咪好似琴日（庭上）咁討論呢，我就真係唔記得喇」，他亦記得大家「其實冇乜反應」，因此之後民協亦沒有立場，由參選人自行決定是否簽署。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;官質疑選民不會理解何立場 何稱理解民協支持者不會支持無差別否決&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳慶偉問，那何啟明有告訴其選民嗎？並指若他是其選民，怎會理解到何的「隱藏議程」，即聲明內的「包括否決財政預算案」，其實意指「不包括否決財政預算案」。何表示：「或者我對民協嘅支持者理解就唔係咁樣喇，民協嘅支持者都係一啲基層嘅市民⋯⋯我理解民協嘅支持者都係唔會支持無差別咁否決財政預算案。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，即何認為支持者會明白簽署「墨落無悔」的他是不會否決預算案？何答：「係，所以我哋喺初選入面，深水埗仍然有好高嘅支持」。李運騰指深水埗不是九龍西唯一選區，問何只是想獲得深水埗區的支持嗎？何指理解初選是「每個候選人 call 返自己嘅支持者出嚟支持佢」，而民協根據地在深水埗，故支持者集中在該處。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官指勝出初選或因簽墨落無悔-何只能夠話呢個係你嘅分析&quot;&gt;官指勝出初選或因簽「墨落無悔」 何：只能夠話呢個係你嘅分析&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡亦指，若何啟明稱不會否決預算案，則應簽署一份表明所用權力「不包括否決財案」的聲明，何答「但現實冇呢份聲明」，故他沒有簽。陳仲衡指他可以自己發布，陳慶偉亦指可以說「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，審視財政預算案」，因何的選民是深水埗草根市民。李運騰也指，若何啟明無意否決預算案，聲明根本不應出現「否決」預算案一詞，問有什麼阻礙他發布一份代表他立場的聲明？&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明邊擺動左手邊說：「我有我嘅理解，我又明白民協嘅支持者會明白我嘅理解，所以我唔覺得有需要再澄清，而事後我真係贏到初選」，被告席傳出笑聲，鄒家成亦邊聽邊笑着點頭。陳慶偉續說，何贏得初選可能是因為他簽了「墨落無悔」，選民基於聲明表面上的意思（face value）而投票給他，何說「我只能夠話呢個係你嘅分析，因為選民投票可以基於好多原因」，林卓廷露齒笑，鄒家成亦笑着點頭。李運騰續指，法官尚未有任何立場，只是就證據提出疑問，讓何解釋。何最後在李追問下表示，「冇嘢阻礙」他發布自己的聲明，但當時認為沒有需要。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮偉明最後問，「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案」，何啟明理解是「不包括」否決權，抑或是「不限於」否決權？何指是「不限於」，即可在一系列權力作選擇，而他自己沒有意圖使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱只知35目標為立會過半五大訴求是達成35後再爭取&quot;&gt;何稱只知35+目標為立會過半、五大訴求是達成35+後再爭取&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明確認，於6月20日提交初選提名表格。就表格上「我確認支持和認同由戴耀廷及區諾軒主導之協調會議共識，包括「『民主派35+公民投票計劃』及其目標」，何指「共識」就是辦初選、辦選舉論壇、以靈童制為替補機制、及各區議席數目的4點共識；至於「目標」，他理解是「民主派喺立法會議席過半」，解釋協調會議內戴耀廷和區諾軒有提及，他理解所有參與者都同意。何亦指沒有收過任何有關「民主派35+公民投票計劃」的文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，該「目標」的英語是眾數「goals」，問立會過半是唯一的目標嗎？何答「我淨係知道立會過半啫」，李追問那「五大訴求，缺一不可」呢？何指「我收到嘅訊息係35+之後去爭取嘅」，理解爭取五大訴求並非「35+計劃」目標。陳慶偉續提到區諾軒早前供稱，九西首次會議曾討論政治聯繫較「尷尬」的人，如新思維狄志遠可否參與初選，戴耀廷回答只要認同「五大訴求」就可參選。陳問據戴耀廷說法，「五大訴求」不就是計劃的目標嗎？何稱「咁就唔係喎」，指「嗰個『五大訴求』係一個立場，我哋呢個初選係希望做到35+，35+到先至更有力去爭取『五大訴求』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問立會過半是否只是手段（means），用來爭取五大訴求這個目標（goal），何答就陳提到的例子，他們是認同以「五大訴求」的立場來界定參選人資格，但初選計劃是希望達致35+，重申爭取五大訴求是「之後嘅事」。何又說，「或者可能真係大家又係理解唔同」，強調「嗰個目標我就好簡單諗，就係要攞35+，而事實上參選得嘅，都冇人會話佢唔認同『五大訴求』」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何同意想達成五大訴求-達致制衡&quot;&gt;何同意想達成五大訴求 達致制衡&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，那何啟明自己呢？他想達成五大訴求嗎？何答「想」。李問故他當選後，會用任何權力來爭取？何指他不會用「任何」來形容，解釋要實現五大訴求有很多種模式，而他當時認為取得35+，就可在議會對政府有「制衡（checks and balances）」的功用，政府就需與民主派商討，商討過程就可爭取實現五大訴求。陳仲衡問他在論壇有沒有這樣說，何說他已忘記論壇內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方稱要用相同武器才能迫政府回應五大訴求-何啟明唔一定&quot;&gt;控方稱要用相同武器才能迫政府回應五大訴求 何啟明：唔一定&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明上午完成主問。他下午在主控萬德豪盤問下同意，簽署「墨落無悔」的人同意迫特首回應五大訴求，而除非民主派立會過半後團結否則無法做到。萬德豪續指，他們實要用相同武器（same weapon）才能迫政府回應五大訴求？何啟明一度問何謂相同武器，萬指若有人修訂、有人問問題、有人否決就是不同的武器。李運騰再指，控方意思是為達致五大訴求，取得過半的民主派就武器的選取應一致，採取同樣的方式迫使政府回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何回應「唔一定」，指因民主派過半，政府一定要找民主派商討。李運騰指但沒有人可代表所有民主派，何續回應：「咁所以其實政府係要回應五大訴求囉，因為呢個係民主派嗰個共同願望囉」，又指：「有人負責調議程，有人負責問問題，有人負責做修訂，係可以同時進行，所以我話唔一定要共同武器。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問何當時是否知道「大殺傷力憲制武器」？李運騰指他一定知道，因為他聽過「攬炒十步」，何同意有此印象。萬德豪續指，這就是他提到35+後議員可使用的「武器」，惟何攤手說：「問問題、修訂咋喎？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續問，但到了投票的時候，民主派若要達到共同目的，就要有一致的投票意向？何重申可以有人不斷問問題和修訂，亦有人可與政府商討，「一路都唔做表決住」，「呢個情況都可以出現㗎喎。」李再追問，但投票時意向要一致才能達到目的？何靜默數秒後表示：「因為我真係諗唔到嗰個狀況。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明不同意墨落共同綱領指無差別否決財案一度稱聲明有語病&quot;&gt;何啟明不同意「墨落」共同綱領指無差別否決財案、一度稱聲明「有語病」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方亦就「墨落無悔」聲明進行盤問。就聲明提及「我們認為，在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領，乃一眾參選人之合作基礎。考慮到立場差異，此一綱領已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數」，何啟明同意認為「已取得共識的共同綱領」是指區諾軒提到辦初選等4點共識。萬德豪續指，但「墨落無悔」提及認同五大訴求和會運用否決權等，與何稱的4點共識無關？何答「唔係喎」，李運騰即指何啟明卻指五大訴求並非共識之一。何續指，「嗱，其實呢句嘢係有語病㗎所以」，鄒家成和林卓廷等即大笑，何並解釋若該4點共識是共同綱領，「咁點解下一句就即刻話有立場差異呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官李運騰指不認為有邏輯問題，稱有些參選人或推本土派議程、有些人不，有人擁護一國兩制、有人不會，與4點共識不相違。李並着控方直接問問題，萬德豪指認為問題已頗清晰，李說：「那就令它更清晰」；陳慶偉亦說他昨日已問過同樣問題，何啟明亦已答了不同意，不認為重複有什麼意義。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方最後指出，聲明中的「共同綱領」是指無差別否決預算案的協議，何不同意。李運騰問，施德來有出席黨會議，有否提到九東候選人會簽署和提交共同綱領？何說「冇印象有呢份文件嘅討論」，他亦不知道有該份文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明稱簽署墨落時不知誰發起-官問會否擔心是陷阱&quot;&gt;何啟明稱簽署「墨落」時不知誰發起 官問會否擔心是陷阱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就何啟明昨稱，他對「墨落」的理解或與其他人不同，他在盤問下指當時沒有向發起人澄清內容，而他簽署時亦不知道誰是發起人，因同事展示帖文時「冇人名，淨係得內容」、並稱陸續有不同人簽署，何看到內容覺得可接受就簽署，沒有嘗試找出誰是發起人。李運騰問，他不擔心這是陷阱？何說「嗰時冇諗到係陷阱喎，嗰時覺得係有人想有一個立場上嘅展示」，鄒家成笑着與吳政亨討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官陳仲衡問，何不會想知道發起人是來自傳統抑或激進陣營嗎？何解釋選舉期工作忙亂，重申純粹看到聲明覺得內容可接受就簽署，對控方質疑可找黨友或施德來查詢，何笑言其團隊「唔係好多人」，他亦沒有問施德來。何續指他於簽署後約一星期內，看到其他候選人帖文「頭嗰幾個名都係一樣」，理解應該「嗰幾個」是發起人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明稱黨友對墨落無悔無強烈反對&quot;&gt;何啟明稱黨友對「墨落無悔」無強烈反對&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明亦供稱，曾於黨團群組討論「墨落無悔」，但當時包括施德來也「冇乜反應」。李運騰問故何是自說自話？何解釋是無強烈的反對，可能「覆啲 emoji」，陳慶偉發笑。控方質疑他談「墨落」，黨友卻只覆表情符號？何解釋因大家「冇好大嘅意見」，他不記得如何回覆，「可能真係手指公、OK咁樣」。陳慶偉問為何是手指公不是「滴汗」，何指群組內不是每人熱衷討論，重申不記得詳情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何亦確認，沒有向施德來查詢，聲明中「包括否決預算案」其實是指「不包括否決預算案」。萬德豪續指，何並沒有將他的理解告知選民，惟陳慶偉指何已答過、稱選民會理解，何表示他亦有回覆選舉主任。萬再質疑，但何沒有與選民討論他否決財案的意向？何指選舉期間時間太少，他沒有這樣做。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（4日）踏入審訊第78天。前民協副主席何啟明今繼續作供，解釋選舉單張的意思。就單張提到「反暴政」，何表明當時政府「唔理會人民嘅聲音」，一意孤行實施《逃犯條例》，甚至由警察施放催淚彈、用水炮車，是「對人民的暴政」，港人要「Full counter」反擊；至於單張提「凡推倒政府的執政模式，都可謂之革命」，何稱無意推翻政府，而是「推翻林鄭月娥嗰種嘅執政模式」，直言政府疫情紓困措施不足，故意「撳低香港人嘅生活，要香港人靠政府先可以過活」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明又表示，初選論壇前無與參選九東的黨友施德來討論，指兩個選舉隊伍「各自運作」；而就施於論壇提到民協入議會會兩次否決預算案，何認為是施的個人看法，不代表他和民協立場。何盤問下，亦表示無收過戴耀廷發出的協調文件。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何解釋單張提暴政政府不理人民聲音由警用催淚彈水炮車&quot;&gt;何解釋單張提「暴政」：政府不理人民聲音、由警用催淚彈水炮車&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明今繼續作供，辯方展示何啟明報名時附上的選舉單張，寫有「反暴政 衛我城 FULL COUNTER」。被問「暴政」指什麼，何答：「我指當時嘅政府，佢唔理會人民嘅聲音，一意孤行嚟到實施《逃犯條例》。」陳仲衡說但當時政府已撤回草案，何指當時政府說法是「暫緩」，後來才「撤回」，又指「暴政除咗呢樣野仲有其他嘅」，鄒家成和林卓廷對視而笑。何續解釋，政府不理會人民聲音，「好多民生嘅事政府都冇回應，甚至由得警察嚟到去施放催淚彈、用水炮車，所以我哋覺得呢個政府就係對人民嘅暴政」，鄒家成點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/VIaTYKc.png&quot; alt=&quot;image06&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再問何謂「Full counter（全面反擊）」，何指是足球術語，「指弱隊面對強隊嘅時候，無論前鋒中場後衛都一齊反擊，所以就引申落去香港人即使面對強權，都要一齊嚟到反擊」，又指是「跨階層，跨世代」。至於「衞我城」，何確認是指香港。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;單張提全面否決權包括否決財案-何稱僅解釋35情況無意運用&quot;&gt;單張提「全面否決權」包括否決財案 何稱僅解釋35+情況無意運用&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方欲就下一議題發問，但李運騰指何啟明還有其他單張，問辯方會否想就此提問。辯方其後展示另一單張，寫有「團結爭四席 初選你話事」，而在「乜嘢係民主派初選？」、「點解…香港人需要『民主35+』？」下，寫有「取得全面否決權，包括否決財政預算案」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就「全面否決權」，何解釋以往民主派是少數，只有就重大議案的「關鍵否決權」；但民主派過半則可有「全面否決權」，所有政府議案都要得到民主派同意才可通過，解釋單張是「事實的陳述」。李運騰指所以「包括」一詞在這裡不是指「不包括」？何答：「哦係啊，全面否決權係包括呢啲（否決預算案）。」陳仲衡續問，單張提到「不同戰線」，是指「Full counter」？陳慶偉問還是指「攬炒十步」？何指應是「Full counter」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何其後再主動補充，「包括否決財政預算案」是形容「全面否決權有啲乜嘢嘢」，解釋民主派立會過半後可取全面否決權、制衡暴政、實現五大訴求，但與「墨落無悔」一樣，「我冇話過用呢一樣嘢嚟到迫使特首回應五大訴求。」李運騰問若何無意運用否決權，為何要提及，何解釋希望用字較「一致」，指簽署的「墨落無悔」有提，故想單張亦提及，因不一致又會被發現和要花時間回應。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉問，所以單張不是用來宣傳何自己，而是宣傳「35+計劃」整體？何指其他部分有介紹民協。李運騰再問，所以何是在單張提及他認為計劃的重點（salient features）？何同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;單張提推倒政府執政模式-何稱非推翻政府指林鄭故意撳低港人生活&quot;&gt;單張提「推倒政府執政模式」 何稱非推翻政府、指林鄭故意撳低港人生活&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於另一份單張寫有「議會過半 民生革命」，何啟明解釋「民生革命」是「我哋唔要林鄭月娥嗰個領導嘅模式喇」。何並確認，單張上提到的利瀚庭是他參與正式選舉的拍檔，但因民協資源有限，「一份單張用到尾」，故在初選和正選都有使用。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/h8mCqyn.png&quot; alt=&quot;image07&quot; /&gt;
▲ （資料圖片）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就單張提及「林鄭用呢一種7.21執政模式」、「香港人不可以容忍林鄭這方面的政策」、「凡推倒政府的執政模式，都可謂之革命」，何指「政府執政模式」與「政府」兩者有分別，解釋「單張意思唔係要推翻政府，而係推翻林鄭月娥嗰種嘅執政模式」。李運騰問及單張首句「林鄭政府是香港民生的敵人」，何解釋因林鄭政府「冇去理會到香港人嘅生活」，疫情的紓解民困措施不足夠，而「我睇到佢係好特登咁做，因為佢就係要撳低香港人嘅生活，要香港人靠政府先可以過活」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰問，所以何想表達的訊息，是林鄭月娥「刻意地對香港人做邪惡的事（deliberately doing evil against the Hong Kong people）」？何指在2020年初，看到政府把關不力致疫情擴散，民協曾去政總請願要求封關，但政府無理會。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再次問，而何是認為政府不止是漠視市民需要，更是刻意做邪惡的事情？何指單張是寫「政府刻意地令到嗰個香港變得更差」，「差」意思是疫情擴至整個社會。李運騰問他是談及2020年初？何指當時疫情已很嚴重，李指不認為如2022年嚴重，何說：「咁的確係一波比一波嚴重。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明稱初選論壇前無與施德來討論-因屬兩團隊-自己無提否決權&quot;&gt;何啟明稱初選論壇前無與施德來討論 因屬兩團隊 自己無提否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明確認，他於6月24日出席九龍西的初選論壇，而事前沒有與黨討論應該或不應該在論壇說什麼。李運騰指論壇有固定環節如限時的自我介紹和問答，何確認獲初選組織者通知相關程序，而他有為相關問答等準備，「但唔係寫稿咁」，亦確認預期會就黨立場被發問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問既然如此，何會與參選九龍東的黨友施德來討論當被問及民協立場時會說什麼？何指「我冇同佢討論」，因兩個選舉隊伍「各自運作」。李運騰再指，但假若何在論壇說了一些會引起人攻擊施德來的話，他們有想過為此準備共同的反駁（common defence）嗎？何說「我哋真係冇咁諗過」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明續確認，他於論壇上沒提過運用否決權。阮偉明指就論壇發問完畢，李運騰問辯方會否想就何啟明一些發言發問，並主動提到是哪幾段發言，阮偉明一度坐下閱讀，後表示該些發言沒提及運用否決權，不認為與控罪相關。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明指黨友施德來九東論壇發言是個人看法-不代表民協立場&quot;&gt;何啟明指黨友施德來九東論壇發言是個人看法 不代表民協立場&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於就施德來在之後九龍東初選論壇，提及「今日嘅民協入到議會裏面，我哋一定會兩次否決《財政預算案》，入到議會裏面，今日係要抗爭，唔抗爭嘅就行開」，何啟明稱是論壇後約一兩日由同事告知大意，而他認為這只是施德來個人看法，不代表其立場和民協立場，他亦不同意施稱會兩次否決預算案，「佢喺論壇講嘅野就唔代表我。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，他沒有向施表達不同意，因九西論壇後他已忙於進行街站和競選工作，「加上我明白九龍西民協嘅支持者，係會清楚分到我同施德來」，解釋「佢哋理解民協過去嘅往績，知道民協本身係一個乜嘢嘅政黨，佢唔會話因為一個人一句半句說話，就會話呢個人呢個黨就係咁喇」，加上他出選九西，「我知道民協嘅支持者都會支持我嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡問，故何啟明的看法是民協的正統（orthodox）看法？何指「好難判斷到底邊一個較為傳統」，但認為民協支持者會明白和支持他的立場。何續確認，他於初選勝出，7月22日報名參與正式立法會選舉，後被選舉主任就「墨落無悔」等作提問，他有作回覆。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱無意圖顛覆國家政權和無差別否決預算案&quot;&gt;何稱無意圖顛覆國家政權和無差別否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方最後問，何參與初選時同意顛覆國家政權和無差別否決預算案嗎？何答「不同意」。辯方再問，何入議會唯一願景是否迫使政府回應五大訴求？何否認。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱無興趣戴耀廷攬炒文章協調會僅岑子杰反對否決權&quot;&gt;何稱無興趣戴耀廷「攬炒」文章、協調會僅岑子杰反對否決權&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明今早完成主問。他下午在主控萬德豪盤問下確認，自2018年風雲計劃認識戴耀廷，知道他是35+計劃的主要推手，亦有發布很多文章，惟他2019年尾至2020年7月沒有讀過戴的文章和 Facebook 帖文。萬德豪問，何稱第二次協調會議上戴耀廷曾應張崑陽要求介紹「真攬炒十步」文章，提及運用否決權，何會後沒有再看那篇文章？何同意，指「一嚟冇興趣，二嚟佢都講咗啦」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，戴提及否決權後，只有岑子杰反對，戴回應可用或不用，之後「好快轉咗 topic 去（協調）機制度喇」，他亦沒有提出反對。萬德豪指那不是他首次聽到戴耀廷提「會積極運用」否決權的說法，指戴首次會議上已提及。何指戴有提否決權，但不記得確實字眼。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明稱無收過戴耀廷發出協調文件&quot;&gt;何啟明稱無收過戴耀廷發出協調文件&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示戴耀廷與趙家賢的 WhatsApp 訊息，其中3月18日提及首次九西協調會的時間地點，何確認從區諾軒收到該訊息內容，但不記得戴耀廷有否發該訊息給他。控方指他實是從戴耀廷收到，惟何說：「吓，我到而家個記憶都仲係區諾軒。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續展示首次會議兩日後、即3月26日的訊息，戴提及「這是我草擬的文件，作下次會議討論的基礎」，並附上「35+九西」文件，何指他均沒有收到。法官和萬德豪問，會議上有沒有人想要排除民協參與討論？何說「我唔明佢點樣想撇除我哋」、「我冇聽過咁嘅訊息」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱協調會無需文件可討論亦無會議紀錄&quot;&gt;何稱協調會無需文件可討論、亦無會議紀錄&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指訊息顯示戴為下次會議準備了討論文件，問何出席第二次會議時有收過文件嗎？何表示沒有，他「冇嘢揸手」。陳仲衡問會上有否其他人用他沒有的文件討論，何重申兩次會議集中討論初選機制，「唔會有文件嗰啲嘢。」李運騰問，會議有很多人出席，戴耀廷作為主持，發言時沒有草稿？何說：「唔使㗎佢！」，多人發笑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李問那何是否需要，何稱「都唔使」。李問即所有人自由說話？何重申，初選機制就是討論有否初選和論壇等，「唔使文件都討論到」；至於計劃的目標，「咪就係佢一開始簡介佢啲文章提及嗰啲嘢，咁講完大家就『哦』，就落返去個機制」，鄒家成、彭卓棋等發笑，陳慶偉亦笑出聲。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續敲了枱上文件數下，指民協開會有紀錄，辯方亦呈上相關文件，何說「咁我哋黨運作係有紀錄啊嘛」，陳指但據何所說，35+計劃就沒有準備文件，李運騰亦說，就同意的事項也沒有書面紀錄，所有人就發生什麼事或同意了哪些事項都是憑記憶，何同意，並指辦初選等4點機制「唔使文件就講到」。陳慶偉再問，那何如何獲悉下一次會議日期，何指是有人 WhatsApp 通知，同意他收訊息沒有困難。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, a large part of the territory of Ukraine – and thus millions of Ukrainian citizens – came under the control of Russian troops. The participation of the residents of the occupied territories in the resistance movement, their interaction with the Defence Forces of Ukraine (all of the defence, security and intelligence institutions involved in the defence of Ukraine) and their contribution to the success of Ukrainian operations are extremely significant. At the same time – as the experience of Ukraine has shown – in the conditions of modern war, the nature and tasks of a resistance movement differ from those of a traditional one. The study of the Ukrainian resistance movement therefore deserves special attention, as it can help in adapting existing doctrines and training programmes for resistance movement specialists to the realities that they will have to face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, it should be noted that in the conditions of a major conventional confrontation between Ukraine and Russia, where Ukraine also has the means of long-range fire damage, the main function of the resistance movement in the occupied territories is the collection and transmission of intelligence information – particularly on the location of the most important Russian military objects – as well as carrying out fire adjustments on such targets. Since the population of the occupied territories of Ukraine is extremely hostile to Russia and wants to liberate its settlements as soon as possible, it was not difficult for the Defence Forces of Ukraine to identify people who were ready to participate in the resistance. Tens of thousands of people are involved in the networks that operate in the occupied territories, the vast majority of whom are involved in the collection of intelligence information necessary for the effective operations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Ukrainian law, the formation and management of the resistance movement is the prerogative of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine; however, Ukrainian intelligence and law enforcement agencies have also created their own networks in the occupied territories. This is natural given that the intelligence agencies, as well as the operational units of law enforcement agencies, have more practical human intelligence experience and a significantly larger number of specialists who are able to ensure the selection and recruitment of resistance members as well as the direction and organisation of their activities, taking into account the need to maintain a high level of tradecraft. In addition, the intelligence agencies are able to more effectively direct the intelligence-gathering activities of the resistance movement, as they have the ability to assess the intelligence situation and analyse any changes that occur. Another important element of the intelligence agencies’ success in this regard is the presence of a pre-prepared apparatus of agents who have already undergone basic training and acquired the practical skills necessary for effective operation in the occupied territories. This is especially important for agent penetration of the occupation administrations and other structures formed by the Russians in the occupied territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that acts of sabotage and direct actions account for a smaller percentage of resistance movement operations compared to the collection of intelligence information, they also deserve attention. In the case of sabotage, considering the traditional high dependence of Russian military logistics on railway transport, actions to disable railway infrastructure – especially those causing damage to rolling stock (disabling locomotives) – can be particularly fruitful. Such sabotage is significantly more effective compared to ordinary damage to the railway track, as it takes much longer for the enemy to restore functioning. Carrying out such actions requires agents to be stationed at enterprises that ensure the functioning of railway transport, including among the employees of railway depots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Tens of thousands of people are involved in the networks that operate in the occupied territories, the vast majority of whom are involved in the collection of intelligence information&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of direct actions in the occupied territories is relatively low, and the actions themselves are mainly carried out by the Special Operations Forces and special units of the intelligence agencies, occasionally with some support from members of the resistance movement. With the presence of artillery and missile weapons capable of targeting the enemy’s entire operational depth, as well as strike UAVs capable of hitting targets at a distance of more than 1,000 km, the need for direct actions has significantly decreased, and is reduced to extremely niche tasks and objectives. The involvement of members of the resistance movement in direct actions is not appropriate, since it requires additional combat and tradecraft training, the deployment of additional infrastructure – which increases the risk of exposing networks – as well as the scaling of the actions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of members of the resistance movement in distributing propaganda among the population of the occupied territories as well as among the Russian armed forces is also of a limited nature. A much more effective and safer way of influencing such audiences is the use of social networks and digital media, as well as sending messages to smartphones – which, despite all prohibitions, are actively used by Russian military personnel. Under such conditions, the participation of the resistance movement in propaganda activities is reduced to painting anti-Russian graffiti in public places, which is aimed at demonstrating the presence of the resistance, as well as supporting the morale of the population in the occupied territories and encouraging them to engage in civil disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resistance movement’s involvement in the organisation of non-violent protests against the Russian occupation – which were widespread at the beginning of the invasion – had become negligible by the end of 2022. The harsh occupation regime established by Russia, accompanied by the large-scale kidnapping, imprisonment, torture and murder of pro-Ukrainian activists, made open forms of protest practically impossible. Russian repression also forced a significant part of the active population to leave the occupied territories, which greatly simplified the task of the Russian-installed police and counterintelligence regimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are prerequisites for the deployment of the resistance movement with the involvement of Russian citizens in Russia itself, Ukraine is not conducting such operations. Special operations on Russian territory are limited to raid operations by the Ukrainian Special Operations Forces and special units of the intelligence agencies, during which the operators carry out sabotage actions on transport and military infrastructure. Informational and psychological influence on the Russian population in the vast majority of cases is carried out through social networks and involves refuting the narratives of Russian propaganda, by conveying true information about the course of the war, the losses incurred by the Russian armed forces, and so on. Measures to form a non-violent anti-war movement within Russia, as well as among Russian citizens in other countries – despite their obvious necessity – are not being carried out. To a large extent, the reason for the lack of tangible efforts in this direction is that the need to prepare for a long-term total confrontation with Russia was neglected prior to the outbreak of war, a fact characteristic of both the leadership of Ukraine and its Western partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The resistance movement remains an effective tool for carrying out sabotage of critical infrastructure, particularly objects relating to railway transport&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarising the experience of the Ukrainian resistance movement, the following elements stand out. First of all, for the effective formation and application of a resistance movement, it is necessary to involve experienced human intelligence specialists. This is due to the high level of tradecraft required for handling agent networks, as well as the fact that the main product of a resistance movement in the conditions of a peer-to-peer confrontation is the intelligence information collected by its members. This necessitates a review of the role of intelligence agencies in the organisation of the resistance movement, as well as a significant increase in the capabilities of the Special Operations Forces in the field of conducting human intelligence operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the involvement of members of the resistance movement in direct actions in the conditions of a modern military conflict is limited due to the high threat of network disclosure, as well as the possibility of using artillery and missile systems to destroy targets in the occupied territories, together with UAVs, which are significantly more effective compared to ambushes and raids by small groups. At the same time, the resistance movement remains an effective tool for carrying out sabotage of critical infrastructure, particularly objects relating to railway transport. In this regard, more attention should be paid to identifying objects that may be important to disable, as well as to the development of appropriate methods for carrying out sabotage actions when training members of the resistance movement. It is also evident that special forces operators – who have spent a significant part of their careers developing individual combat skills – often lack the knowledge and skills necessary to create and administer underground networks whose main tasks are intelligence gathering and sabotage. Moreover, even the training of members of the resistance movement involved in direct action usually requires qualities other than the high level of individual combat skills possessed by special forces fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, especially in conditions where the theatre of conventional military operations is mostly limited to the territory of Ukraine, the deployment of the resistance movement (as a movement of citizens against the regime) on Russian territory is a necessary and practically unavoidable step. The creation of such a resistance movement would make it possible to organise both an underground anti-war network – capable, among other things, of carrying out sabotage actions against the enterprises of the Russian defence industry – and an open anti-war movement, which could significantly reduce the level of support for the aggression against Ukraine among Russian citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（3日）踏入審訊第77天。前民協區議員何啟明開始作供，表示因關注基層民生加入民協，任區議員時與政府有良好合作關係，2020年3月初有意參選立法會。庭上展示民協會議紀錄，法官李運騰指有建議口號是「立會過半、光復香港」，何承認「呢個口號係我諗嘅」，解釋民協曾在深水埗區議會過半，認為有效實踐民生理念，「我哋好早已經明白到議會過半嘅功用」，故望將區議會經驗在立會實踐；又指「光復香港」是2019年社運口號，意思是「希望回復返香港以往嘅價值：自由、法治」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何又指，「參與初選就係要願賭服輸」，落敗就不會參與正式選舉。法官陳慶偉追問他是否支持「三投三不投」，何稱當時不知道亦無支持過；法官再問若知道會否支持，何表示：「我答唔到喎，呢個假設性問題。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明稱民協為溫和民主民生派-任區議員時與政府關係良好&quot;&gt;何啟明稱民協為溫和民主民生派 任區議員時與政府關係良好&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭卓棋上周作供完畢，今由前民協副主席、參選九龍西初選的前深水埗區議員何啟明作供。身穿深藍色襯衫和卡其褲的何啟明以基督教形式宣誓，他在辯方大律師阮偉明主問下，表示自己於1988年出生，於城大完成社會科學學士，現於民協任社區幹事，及於中國神學研究院修讀基督教研究碩士。何指，於2013年加入民協成為職員，2015年成為黨員，解釋「因為想參與多啲地區服務，同埋關注多啲基層民生嘅工作」。&lt;/p&gt;

▲ 何啟明&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，他2015年當選深水埗區議員，2019年連任，並於2016年成為民協副主席直至2021年3月。何指，任區議員時不時需與政府溝通，雙方合作關係良好，舉例西九龍法院外的地盤亦是溝通的成果，「我哋成功爭取拆咗長沙灣屠房，將佢改成3幢嘅公屋，依家仲起緊。」何又形容，民協是「溫和民主嘅民生派政黨」，同意其立場與黨立場一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱2月從民協黨團會議得知辦初選-但不記得誰提及&quot;&gt;何稱2月從民協黨團會議得知辦初選 但不記得誰提及&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問何時知道民主派有舉行初選的討論，何稱約是2020年2月，從民協黨團會議得知。法官李運騰問是否獲施德來告知，何僅表示「喺個會議入面係有個同事講係有初選」，陳仲衡追問是誰，何指不記得。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示2020年2月29日的民協中央黨團會議紀錄，何確認出席者包括他和施德來，但無法說出由哪位同事告知會有初選，亦不肯定是否施德來告知他。他又指紀錄寫由十八區正副主席匯報，而楊彧是深水埗區議會主席，「有機會係佢收到消息講都唔出奇」，但重申不能肯定是誰提及初選消息，亦不肯定是由一人或多人提及。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何確認，會上決定由施德來出席3月2日的九東協調會議，但之後沒有再討論初選。李運騰關注會議紀錄提及「反對通過預算案」，何確認是指2020年的預算案，與「35+」無關，而民協當時反對，是因預算案「冇回應到我哋一啲民生嘅訴求」，如失業援助金甚至全民退休保障。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何指民協持續關注綜援等議題-官關注會議紀錄提武漢肺炎&quot;&gt;何指民協持續關注綜援等議題 官關注會議紀錄提「武漢肺炎」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續主動提起，留意到紀錄上以「武漢肺炎」稱呼「新冠肺炎」，問是否刻意選擇。何否認，解釋「當時係疫情開始嘅時候，咁仍然有好多人都係用『武漢肺炎』呢個字」。李追問，故該字不是用作「貶義（derogatory）」？何答「唔係」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉亦指，會議紀錄提及「民主動力參與協調會議或立法會選舉的籌備」，問民主動力當時是否已有份籌備？何指他只是當天聽同事匯報民主動力有參與籌備，而梁有方為民協於民主動力的代表。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何亦確認，會議紀錄提到民協參與社會事務，包括「要求釋放桂民海請願行動」，民協亦持續關注綜援和低收入的議題，而民協與民主黨、社民連和街工均有參與「關注綜緩低收入聯盟」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何認構思口號立會過半光復香港望回復香港以往自由法治價值&quot;&gt;何認構思口號「立會過半、光復香港」：望回復香港以往自由法治價值&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就參選經過，何啟明表示於2020年3月初，有意參與當年的立法會選舉，而民協中央黨團3月7日的會議紀錄亦顯示他開始參與選舉工作。法官李運騰留意到，會議紀錄提議的口號為「立會過半」、「光復香港」，問何當時已有爭取立會過半的願景？何答「係」，解釋民協曾於2003年在深水埗區議會獲過半議席，「我哋嗰時明白到議會過半時，係更有效地實踐我哋嘅民生理念，所以我哋好早已經明白到議會過半嘅功用。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰指但這裡是談及立法會過半，彭同意是指民主派立會過半，並解釋是根據他們經驗「都好希望將呢個區議會嘅經驗喺立法會都實踐得到」。李再問，施德來當時已曾出席一次九東協調會，他對這個口號有任何貢獻嗎？何說：「呢個口號係我諗嘅，而我係好似頭先想講，根據過往嘅經驗，希望將呢個願景擺落立法會度」，並指他當時知道立會過半也是「35+計劃」的主題。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/nnjJKzJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;image03&quot; /&gt;
▲ 施德來（右）&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉追問，為何提「光復香港」？何稱「因為當時19年嘅運動係有呢一個嘅口號」。李運騰問，所以立會過半與光復香港是有關係的？何認為光復香港是2019年運動的延續？何思索約5秒說：「會係。」陳仲衡問，當談及光復香港，是光復什麼？何說：「我係希望回復返香港以往嘅價值：自由、法治。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱與九東選舉團隊獨立運作-民協望取九東第4席&quot;&gt;何稱與九東選舉團隊「獨立運作」 民協望取九東第4席&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;辯方續展示民協3月14日的會議紀錄，提及九龍西和九龍東選舉工程策略，何啟明確認是有關正式選舉而非初選，而分開討論是因屬兩個團隊，望獨立運作，「唔好大家互相 chur 散咗啲資源。」何同意民協會競逐九東及九西，而當時「得我一個有意去選九龍西」，但黨未有最後決定，而他當時未知九東要否競爭，但事後回看亦是無競爭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續指，會議紀錄提及民協望取得九東第4席，李運騰問這與「35+」的「6 6 4 4 3」目標有關嗎？何否認，指「35+」九龍東目標是3席。陳慶偉問既然如此，為何紀錄提及「視乎初選安排或結果」，何解釋民協如能入圍，望在九東取得民主派第4席，但當時就是否舉辦初選，他理解九東仍未有最終決定。李運騰問，所以九東的選舉工程策略會否是指初選的策略？何稱「我代表唔到佢哋答」，亦不肯定有否在會上討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱施德來有匯報九東進展-惟詳細內容唔記得&quot;&gt;何稱施德來有匯報九東進展 惟「詳細內容唔記得」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法官其後提及，庭上證供早前提到，民協黃大仙區議會主席許錦成於4月18日在九東群組發訊息，指有人認為九東應要有初選，後譚文豪、胡志偉、施德來和黃之鋒也贊成。何同意因此3月時九東未確定是否辦初選，至於該選舉工程策略是初選抑或正選用，「其實真係未知之數。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明其後在法官詢問下亦表示，當時他將出席九龍西協調會議，施德來則出席九東會議，施有向黨團匯報會議進展。被問施有否談及「35+計劃」的目標，何稱「詳細內容唔記得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明稱參與初選要願賭服輸-落敗不會參與正選&quot;&gt;何啟明稱參與初選要「願賭服輸」 落敗不會參與正選&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續引會議紀錄提到30萬元作選舉前期工作，問是為初選抑或正選準備？何表示「我哋係一定會參與9月嘅選舉嘅其實」，而當時未決定是否辦初選，故該30萬「點都會用嚟做（選舉）宣傳」。陳追問，即民協無論有無初選都會參與正式選舉？何說：「起碼我喺九龍西都係咁諗嘅，喺當時。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續主動提到，「墨落無悔」在之後才出現，但其實民協無意受聲明約束？何答「唔係」。陳指似乎有矛盾，指何剛才說無論如何都會參與正式選舉。何解釋，民協很早時已決定參與9月選舉，而當時「未傾好有冇初選，所以當時嘅想法係點都會去選」，但何指「後尾傾得成係有初選，所以我哋參與初選，而參與初選就係要願賭服輸，所以當參與咗初選嘅時候，咁你如果輸咗初選就唔會去選㗎喇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱無支持過三投三不投-官問會否支持無參與初選者-何無正面回答&quot;&gt;何稱無支持過「三投三不投」 官問會否支持無參與初選者 何無正面回答&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指，所以何是支持（subscribe to）「墨落無悔」？何答：「我係支持墨落無悔嗰兩點聲明嘅。」陳問何亦支持「三投三不投」？何答「我冇支持過三投三不投」，他亦是至7月才知道該運動。陳續問，但若何當時知道「三投三不投」，他也會支持？何思索約5秒說：「我答唔到喎，呢個假設性問題。」陳再指，只是要求何回想他會否支持，何回應：「我只能夠答你，我參與初選，就係願賭服輸，唔夠票就唔會去選喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳追問，那何啟明會支持那些沒參與初選、直接參與正式選舉的人嗎？何會同意他們的行為嗎？何指當時是辦民主派初選，而他們過去一直支持民主派候選人，「如果佢係民主派嘅候選人，咁我咪會支持佢囉。」陳問即他會支持這些人？何答：「唔好意思呢樣嘢冇發生過啊，我真係唔能夠答到你啊。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳續指，何啟明已參與審訊77天，聽到很多證據，他只是問一個認為何有能力答的問題，不是叫他揣測。何重申民協過往也會支持民主派候選人，按此紀錄他也會支持民主派。陳指何似乎不想回答他的問題，因他不是問及歷屆選舉，而以往選舉也沒有初選或協調機制，何表示以往立法會補選有協調機制，陳指他知道，但是談及過往選舉的大圖畫。辯方其後再次重覆法官的問題，問若初選落敗者參與正選何啟明會否支持，惟陳慶偉指不認為何能回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/aJE6uKK.png&quot; alt=&quot;image04&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（3日）踏入審訊第77天。前民協副主席何啟明繼續作供，表示支持「墨落無悔」聲明的內容並簽署，認為聲明提及「我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力」是指「一系列權力」，除否決財案亦包括調動議程、修訂議案等，簽署者有空間選擇是否運用，而他本人不會否決財政預算案。何又指，各參選人在當時社會氣氛下的「最大公因數」是會運用權力迫特首回應五大訴求，只是就否決財案與否有立場差異，認為聲明旨在「求同存異」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明在法官詢問下，表示不界定自己為抗爭派。法官質疑其帖文為何提「抗爭派」而非「溫和派」聲明，何指聲明望求同存異，故沿用聲明標題，又指「我覺得溫和係做出嚟嘅，唔係自己講，民協係溫和係有往續可尋」，而他亦不會介意「嗰一個半個字」的不同而不參與。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何啟明稱無收過任何協調文件-戴耀廷介紹否決權後無討論&quot;&gt;何啟明稱無收過任何協調文件 戴耀廷介紹否決權後無討論&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;前民協副主席何啟明繼續作供，今早供稱2020年3月初有意參選立會。辯方大律師阮偉明展示民協黨團3月21日的會議紀錄，何指當時未確認其候選人身分，但決定由他出席3月24日的九西協調會議。至於3月28日會議紀錄提及民協傾向參與初選，何同意這也是他個人的傾向，亦同意當時黨團建議他撰寫支持初選的文章，他應有撰寫和發布。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續表示，有出席九西3月24日的首次會議，並確認如區諾軒所述，會議開始時戴耀廷介紹運用否決權否決預算案，其後沒有進一步討論，會上主要討論初選機制。何在法官追問下，指從沒收過該次會議的紀錄，開會期間也無傳閱過任何文件，包括「35+計劃」。至於4月29日的第二次會議，何亦確認張崑陽曾要求戴耀廷介紹其「攬炒十步」文章，戴介紹後無進一步討論。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指，有證據顯示戴耀廷於第二次會議後，曾以廣播訊息發出九西協議文件，問何有否收到？何稱沒有，並在辯方追問下，指就區諾軒提及的3份文件，即「35+ 計劃」、「民主派九龍西協調機制（初稿）」及「民主派九龍西協調機制協議」，他均沒收到，案發時亦不知道該些文件存在。被問如何與組織者溝通，何稱是收到通知就開會，而他與戴耀廷和區諾軒本身認識，於初選前已互相交換電話。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何認支持墨落無悔看過才簽署-共同綱領指辦初選等4共識&quot;&gt;何認支持「墨落無悔」、看過才簽署 「共同綱領」指辦初選等4共識&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就何啟明有簽署的「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭 抗爭派立場聲明書」，他指於6月10日下午獲同事楊繼昌以電話向他展示，楊稱當時流傳此聲明。何指簽署前有看過聲明，亦在民協中央黨團、有施德來的 WhatsApp 群組討論，當時黨沒有意見，交由參選人自行決定。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何今早已表明「我係支持墨落無悔嗰兩點聲明嘅」，即「我認同『五大訴求，缺一不可』。我會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力，包括否決財政預算案，迫使特首回應五大訴求，撤銷所有抗爭者控罪，令相關人士為警暴問責，並重啟政改達致雙普選」，及「我認同若支持度跌出預計可得議席範圍，須表明停止選舉工程」兩點。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何續指，理解聲明提及「在初選協調會議上已取得共識的共同綱領」，就是區諾軒早前稱協調會議的4點共識，即辦初選、辦選舉論壇、以靈童制為替補機制、及各區議席數目。至於聲明提及「考慮到立場差異，此一綱領已達致抗爭陣營光譜的最大公因數」，何認為「立場差異」是就否決財政預算案的立場，「有人會選擇否決，有人選擇唔否決」；而達致「最大公因數」則是「求同存異」，鄒家成邊聽邊點頭。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;法庭傳譯主任一度未能翻譯「求同存異」，何啟明稱是「to strive for common ground despite the differences」，李運勝則提議為「to strive for consensus and tolerate the differences」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱可用一系列權力-不限於否決財案&quot;&gt;何稱可用「一系列權力」 不限於否決財案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阮偉明追問，是求什麼「同」？何指是聲明提及的「會運用基本法賦予立法會的權力」；至於「異」，則是有空間選擇運用什麼權力，「不限於否決財政預算案」。何又解釋，「基本法賦予立法會的權力」是「一系列嘅權力」，「我哋係有選擇嘅空間，有啲可以用，有啲可以唔用」，否決預算案只是「呢幾個權力嘅其中一樣」。李運騰指那或是他的理解，但他立場是會運用否決權嗎？何答「我不會用」，又指其立場與他理解一致。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;被問其他權力是什麼，何指若民主派立會過半，可調動議程讓議員不斷問問題或修訂所有議案，包括財政預算案。李運騰問即拉布？何指是兩回事，指同時可有一些「有建設性」、「有用」的修訂。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何亦指，議員可以不開會，透過點人數製造流會。李運騰問即癱瘓會議？何否認，並解釋當民主派過半，政府議案需民主派同意才可通過，過程需雙方商討。李追問上述做法如何迫使政府回應五大訴求，何指是令政府通過議案時需民主派同意，而在過程中民主派會要求特首回應五大訴求。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱九東無討論會或會積極運用無想過否決預算案&quot;&gt;何稱九東無討論「會」或「會積極運用」、無想過否決預算案&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;至於庭上早前提及「會運用」和「會積極運用」否決權的討論，何啟明指他直至被捕前亦不知道相關討論，九西協調會上亦無談及兩者的分別；而他對聲明「會運用」的理解從自己而來：「我係就咁睇完個文本，然後按我自己嘅理解囉。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再追問他說不會運用否決權的意思，何解釋「會運用」是在「一系列嘅權力入面去揀」，而他不會否決預算案。陳慶偉問，即他會否決不支持的議案和撥款，但即使不支持預算案也不會否決？何重申，「一系列權力」有選擇空間，「聲明入面冇講到你揀啲乜嘢嘢（權力），或者我都冇應承過會揀啲乜嘢嘢，但係當刻呢我真係冇諗過會否決財政預算案。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑何理解與他人不同-何稱最大公因數為迫特首回應五大訴求&quot;&gt;官質疑何理解與他人不同 何稱「最大公因數」為迫特首回應五大訴求&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉指，這只是何的理解，但其理解可以與其他參與者完全不同，何說「呢個有機會」。陳追問，故聲明是無效（futile）的，因聲明內容如「一中各表」，可各自表述？陳志全等發笑。何指「咁我睇到嘅理解就係 state the obvious（顯而易見）⋯其實好多嘢都係咁淺白」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉指，若真如何所說的明顯，「墨落無悔」上列明的就應是何提及的4點共識。何回應，「我諗個最大公因數係大家都會運用《基本法》賦予立法會嘅權力，去迫使行政長官回應五大訴求。」陳再質疑何說法與其他人理解不同，並非「最大公因數」，何強調：「喺當時嘅社會氣氛裡面呢，所有參選人都係要迫使政府回應五大訴求。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰再指他不明白，指「墨落無悔」列明會運用《基本法》權力，「包括」否決預算案，但何的立場卻是「不包括」否決預算案，與聲明不符。何表示：「咁我嘅理解真係同法官閣下唔同喇」，重申他「會運用」的一系列權力是包括否決預算案，而他有空間選擇是否運用這些權力。何在李追問下，指他整個初選、甚至初選完結後均抱有同一立場，他在選舉主任查詢時「我都答佢話我唔會咁做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何稱簽聲明可免指責集中精力宣傳-不知其他簽署者想法&quot;&gt;何稱簽聲明可免指責、集中精力宣傳 不知其他簽署者想法&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明續重申，理解「墨落無悔」的目標是「用嚟求同存異，搵最大公因數」，法官陳仲衡質疑他不一定要簽，何同意「係有選擇嘅空間」，但如果不簽，「一定會畀人問、甚至指責」，他要花時間精神回應；但若簽署就可省卻該些時間「集中精力資源去宣傳返民協同埋自己」。陳慶偉問即是政治上的便利？何答「咁本身都要認同先至可以簽嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉笑着問，所以何啟明是同意抑或不同意，抑或是按他的理解？何稱「係會有呢個成分嘅」。陳仲衡續問，何當時是否知道有其他簽聲明者無論如何都會否決預算案，李運騰舉例如「張崑陽」。何指「我唔知其他簽署人嘅想法」，而同事向他展示的聲明無其他署名，他表示「OK」後就交由同事處理帖文，「我冇去細心睇其他簽咗嘅人」；又稱「我只係覺得佢係一個好簡單嘅要求」，故無理會其他人。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉再問，那何是否支持聲明最後兩段的內容：「我們深明議會絕非抗爭終點，以上聲明，僅為確保抗爭陣營參選人，有最基本的抗爭意志。我們的抗爭決心，絕不應因極權打壓而讓步。我們呼籲各位香港人，拒絕支持抗爭意志飄忽不定的參選人。」何湊前看電腦閱讀一會後表示「都係嘅」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑何提抗爭派-何稱沿用聲明標題溫和派係做唔係講&quot;&gt;官質疑何提「抗爭派」 何稱沿用聲明標題、溫和派係做唔係講&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;何啟明在法官陳慶偉詢問下，指不會形容自己為抗爭派。陳續問，那為何他發布「墨落無悔」帖文時，附上寫有「墨落無悔 堅定抗爭 抗爭派立場聲明書」、「何啟明 民協 施德來」的圖片。何指抗爭派望聲明求同存異，取得最大公因數，故理解是形容整個光譜的民主派。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉打斷問，何會指民主派全屬抗爭派？何否認，指理解法官提及的「抗爭派」指「嗰啲本土素人」，「咁我就唔會界定自己係抗爭派喇，最起碼係初選之後嘅抗爭派記招，我係冇被邀請嘅。」陳指，但何啟明寫明是「抗爭派」，何回應「當時其實抗爭派真係有好多個說法」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續問，那為何他不說是「民主派溫和派聲明」？何重申「墨落無悔」是望求同存異，「佢（標題）用『抗爭派』，所以我用返佢嘅字，而我覺得溫和係做出嚟嘅，唔係自己講，民協係溫和係有往續可尋。」陳再質疑何稱否決權不一定要使用，則溫和派也可簽署聲明，但何仍選擇用「抗爭派」一詞，何搖頭道「或者呢個真係做法上嘅不同」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;何否認標籤抗爭派為爭選票-稱為求同存異不介意用字不同&quot;&gt;何否認標籤「抗爭派」為爭選票 稱為求同存異不介意用字不同&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡續問，何標籤自己為「抗爭派」，是為了爭取更多選票？何否認，強調民協本身都是一個「重視民生、溫和嘅民主派政黨」，而他們眼見聲明望求同存異，「我覺得既然係搵最大公因數嘅時候，我哋都可以參與，我唔會介意嗰一個半個字嘅不同，就唔參與。」何在陳仲衡追問下，指聽過「鬥黃」。陳問標籤自己為「抗爭派」也是表現自己為「黃」？何答「唔係，我哋冇咁做」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;案件明早續審。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;excerpt /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at RUSI convened a roundtable in Madrid in late May 2023, to discuss the state of the implementation of sanctions in Spain. The event is part of the series of in-country engagements through the European Sanctions and Illicit Finance Monitoring and Analysis Network (Euro SIFMANet). The roundtable, held under the Chatham House Rule, gathered Spanish representatives from major financial institutions and relevant authorities including the Spanish Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Defence. This report summarises the main findings of the discussion related to Spain’s experience of sanctions on Russia since February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sanctions-implementation-in-spain&quot;&gt;Sanctions Implementation in Spain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roundtable opened with a description of Spain’s progress on implementing sanctions at a national level. Participants started by pointing to the positive assessment of Spain’s anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2014. The FATF rated highly both Spain’s AML/CFT controls and the understanding of the private sector in enforcing them. Participants argued that a robust AML/CFT regime can facilitate more effective implementation of sanctions, given the importance of transaction and client monitoring systems of financial institutions for monitoring sanctions breaches and ensuring sanctions compliance of their clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants did acknowledge that the FATF highlighted some deficiencies regarding Spain’s capabilities to implement sanctions. These weaknesses were related to significant delays in transposing new designated entities into national sanctions lists, the lack of clear channels or procedures for directly receiving foreign requests to take freezing actions, and not having proposed or made any designations. The FATF found these deficiencies to persist in its follow-up assessment in 2019. With this in mind, one representative from the public sector agreed that Spain does not have a framework that is as well-developed to implement financial sanctions as it could have, notably for identifying where a designated individual has control over an entity and for establishing ultimate beneficial ownership of companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this framework, responsibilities for sanctions implementation are distributed among various national competent authorities. Notwithstanding their varying individual responsibilities, public authorities at the roundtable acknowledged that they all also rely on the private sector to provide information on the ownership and control of entities by designated individuals. Furthermore, Spain has not adopted a leadership role among member states in the negotiation of sanctions against Russia and has proposed only a few designations, usually in conjunction with other countries. Since February 2022, in contrast to other EU member states, Spain has not passed any new legislation to facilitate the implementation of sanctions at the national level, except for an amendment to allow the freezing of unregistered assets. Some participants felt this absence leaves gaps that need addressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these shortcomings, discussants pointed to several factors that contribute to Spain’s compliance with sanctions. First, a representative from the Spanish FIU emphasised that Spain has a good track record in implementing financial sanctions, mainly due to the experience with sanctions imposed against Iran since 2010. Second, in contrast to many other European banks, Spanish financial institutions have a record free of major scandals or fines for breaching sanctions, which participants attributed, in part, to their limited exposure to the Middle East compared with other international banks, but also to strong internal policies. Third, Spain has voluntarily chosen to comply with both EU and US sanctions for a number of years. In this regard, representatives from financial institutions at the roundtable added that while they noted Ukraine’s domestic sanctions list, to avoid overcompliance and de-risking, they restricted their sanctions actions to those entities designated by the US and the EU – all of which are also on Ukraine’s list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has significantly impacted financial institutions. While many required sanctions controls are already in place, the cross-border ownership structure of large Spanish banks has required them to maintain wide-ranging oversight. Representatives from these institutions explained that they have reinforced their sanctions compliance programmes, and some have developed tools to facilitate the implementation of sanctions. An example of this is an internal website that provides staff with updates on regulatory guidance and relevant articles on sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spanish private sector demonstrates great understanding and commitment to effectively implement sanctions. However, there was a consensus among participants regarding the unique challenges posed by the sanctions regime against Russia, in contrast to those the EU has previously implemented, which will be discussed in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenges-in-spain&quot;&gt;Challenges in Spain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having addressed the context of Spain’s capacity to implement sanctions, the discussion turned to the challenges the public and private sectors face when implementing the sanctions regime against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As identified by participants, a particular challenge posed by the sanctions regime against Russia is the complexity of trade sanctions. A significant aspect of this challenge is the division between financial and commercial flows. While the latter relies on Customs for enforcement, financial institutions also play an important role as they contribute by sharing intelligence on the involved actors, jurisdictions and other relevant elements such as payments related to restricted goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of the Russian invasion has further complicated the task of enforcing sanctions, escalating from dealing with a limited number of cases to thousands of hits and increased exposure. This has heightened the risk of unintended supply chain disruption, for example in relation to food supplies. To mitigate this risk, participants welcomed the introduction of “firewalls”. The European Commission recently issued guidelines regarding firewalls that allow entities trading in agricultural and food products controlled by a designated individual to continue operating under supervision while their assets are frozen. This facilitates sanctions implementation and reduces the risk of business closures and the subsequent consequences to supply chains, business viability and staff employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lack of harmonisation and alignment among member states was also identified as an issue. For example, if a bank in one member state identifies an entity connected to a sanctioned individual, a different interpretation in another member state could allow transactions to be structured to take advantage of this difference in interpretation. In such instances, participants observed that the private sector often unfairly bears the blame and may become subject to litigation. The lack of centralised mapping of entities owned or controlled by sanctioned individuals at the EU level was noted as a particular shortcoming. Currently, the private sector in each jurisdiction undertakes this mapping endeavour, and authorities rely on it, but there was a consensus on the need for centralisation within the EU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One result of this divergence and lack of common criteria is that some member states have individually introduced their own sanctions lists. A representative from the public sector added that the lack of harmonisation in sanctioning entities also reflects commercial competition among member states. To this end, implementing sanctions in a harmonised manner would be instrumental to effectively enforce sanctions and participants recommended that the existing voluntary nature of the European Commission’s guidance and the lack of enforcement by many member states need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to this issue is the complexity of the “control” criteria and determining ownership. Participants noted that the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control follows an easier and more straightforward system in this regard, as it does not have the EU’s concept of control and relies on simple percentage rules and provides clear guidance. On the other hand, the EU frequently changes its criteria on this term and has modified its FAQs, making it challenging to implement the criteria in a consistent manner. For this reason, participants agreed that some of the sanctions and guidance put forth by the European Commission should be revisited to assess the usefulness and impact. On a similar note, representatives from the banking sector pointed to the €100,000 limit on deposits as a measure worth reconsidering, as it can be easily evaded and overcomplicates payment processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges give rise to major concerns for representatives from both public and private sectors, namely overcompliance and de-risking. The aim of the sanctions regime is not to refuse all transactions related to Russia beyond what is mandated, but to limit the financing and resourcing of the war through targeting specific sectors and individuals. Participants have experienced a substantial increase in their sanctions workload, and many banks lack the resources to monitor all Russia-related transactions, leading them to opt for broad actions such as ending their Russia-related activities and thus overcomplying with sanctions. Financial institutions are concerned about false hits and the difficulty in achieving a high level of efficiency, often resulting in a failure to focus on the real designated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sum, participants argued that to achieve greater effectiveness, governments need to work harder to support the implementation work of the private sector, which led to the following concluding recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spain’s stakeholders in charge of implementation of sanctions voiced confidence in their understanding and experience. While Spain has not been a vocal player in the field of sanctions, the country will take over the Presidency of the Council of the EU in July 2023, placing a spotlight on the country’s sanctions capabilities and leadership. In their commitment to achieve an effective sanctions regime and overcome the identified challenges, participants put forth a series of recommendations that could inform the Presidency’s upcoming agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralised mapping of entities under the ownership or control of designated individuals, with EU-wide guidance and harmonisation.&lt;/strong&gt; The mapping efforts are currently the responsibility of the private sector and there is a need for an EU-level approach to list the entities under the control of designated individuals and a comprehensive European-wide guidance that ensures the information reaches the key operators implementing sanctions across the EU and is implemented in a uniform manner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote the introduction of “firewalls”.&lt;/strong&gt; Allowing a company to operate under supervision despite being controlled by a sanctioned individual would make sanctions more sustainable. This approach would prevent the complete devaluation of a company’s assets, which is not beneficial for either the state or the owner. An added benefit would be the shifting of responsibility from banks to the company itself to adhere to agreed controls. Currently, banks are obliged to request licences on behalf of the company. The introduction of general licences and firewalls would facilitate more agile sanctions that do not harm sectors such as fertilisers and food supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criminalisation of sanctions violations.&lt;/strong&gt; While trade sanctions evasion can be considered contraband, financial sanctions evasion has not yet been criminalised in Spain and the European directive mandating it has not yet entered into force. Given that many countries lack the capacity to conduct investigations into sanctions breaches with the same tools as with criminal offences, criminalising sanctions evasion has become a necessary and overdue step.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen the information-sharing loop.&lt;/strong&gt; The private sector is a key provider of financial intelligence but continues to lack sufficient feedback on the usefulness and outcomes of the information reported to the authorities. Guidance is being provided but enhancing this feedback loop would help prevent evasion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarity on the extraterritoriality of sanctions.&lt;/strong&gt; Although the EU holds that there will be no extraterritorial application of sanctions, indications in FAQs and upcoming packages suggest otherwise. This creates uncertainty as to the exact application of the mandate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanctions should not be viewed separately from anti-money laundering efforts.&lt;/strong&gt; Even if the ultimate beneficial ownership of an entity by a sanctioned individual is only 25%, there may still be concerns about working with such entities. The focus should be on beneficial ownership transparency, and adequate resources should be allocated to mitigate the challenges the private sector faces in obtaining this information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reassess the sanctions imposed.&lt;/strong&gt; The effectiveness and utility of certain sanctions have not been thoroughly assessed and should be revisited. The complications brought by the lack of clarity regarding the control criteria and rules such as the restriction on deposits over €100,000 were a recurring theme at the roundtable. In consequence, many businesses seek to achieve compliance through de-risking and overcompliance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;【獨媒報導】47人涉組織及參與民主派初選，被控「串謀顛覆國家政權」罪，16人不認罪，今（29日）踏入審訊第76天。彭卓棋繼續接受盤問，表示不知道初選組織者於《國安法》生效後舉辦記者會的內容，亦沒看過戴耀廷談初選合法性的文章，解釋當時已撕毀政綱和通知民主動力移除政綱，已「做盡咗」，雖不知《國安法》具體法律含意，但「我放棄政綱，我真係萬估不到，都係會出事」。控方質疑，彭要求移除政綱不等於撤回政治主張；法官亦質疑，彭只於 IG 發布手持爛單張的相片，無法顯示他放棄政綱，彭回應：「其實 po 一張爛嘢⋯⋯明眼人都知我哋縮咗㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;此外，控方今引述彭於論壇提「昂首拒默沉，吶喊聲響透」，指是《願榮光歸香港》歌詞，法官李運騰聞言稱「我從來沒聽過那首歌」。彭又自言，初選後「成績實在太難睇」、「市民唔鍾意我哋」，並否認意圖顛覆國家政權：「初選期間我都繼續搞大灣區嘅商標，咁樣係矛盾嘅。」彭今完成4天作供。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭卓棋稱直至被捕後始逐字細睇墨落無悔聲明-理解否決權是可用可不用&quot;&gt;彭卓棋稱直至被捕後始「逐字細睇」墨落無悔聲明 理解否決權是「可用可不用」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭卓棋今繼續接受主控周天行盤問。就「墨落無悔」聲明書，彭稱其同事應於2020年6月10日得知並告訴他，他於同日簽署。法官陳仲衡問彭與競選團隊有否 WhatsApp 群組，彭答有，陳問可否看群組內容，惟法官陳慶偉即着休庭5分鐘。再開庭後陳仲衡改問彭是以 WhatsApp 或是口頭與同事溝通，彭指就此聲明不記得，同事只是問他「簽唔簽」，而他只是有「䁽過第一點」和見到有「梁晃維」的名字，他直至被捕後「先至逐字細睇」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行問「墨落無悔」聲明內容是否初選協調會議的內容，彭重申「當時冇細睇」，但他「䁽過第一點」，即會運用否決權迫使行政長官回應五大訴求，理解是「可用可不用」。彭續指，港島區並沒有任何「共同綱領」，而他得知梁晃維是港島的潛在參選人，因梁也有出席協調會議。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方播梁晃維論壇談墨落片段-彭不同意當時已知聲明內容來自港島協調會&quot;&gt;控方播梁晃維論壇談「墨落」片段 彭不同意當時已知聲明內容來自港島協調會&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續播放梁晃維在論壇的片段，被問及為何發起「墨落無悔」，彭指：「因為我哋就係知道，我哋有啲人可能即使今日喺個初選嗰度協調咗，初選會嘅內容係冇人知道，淨係得戴耀廷教授同所有參與呢次初選會嘅人先知道，咁其實任何人如果佢背叛佢嘅承諾，根本係冇人能夠保證⋯⋯我就覺得既然大家都認同呢啲概念，咁點解唔能夠真係做一個公開承諾呢？」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行指，梁提及「墨落無悔」是初選協調會議的內容，彭稱「依個係佢嘅講法」。周又指梁稱所有參與協調的人都知道，惟陳慶偉着問下一條問題。李運騰並指，認為控方就另一人的發言要求證人評論並非妥當的盤問方式，即使梁真的這樣說過而彭沒有提出反對，也不能幫助辯方案情。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行指重點是彭卓棋在場，想顯示他當時已知道「墨落無悔」的內容。陳慶偉不耐煩問有何需要問，指他們都知道彭卓棋和梁晃維也在場，李運騰亦指彭當時有權保持沉默，不一定要提出反駁。周改為向彭指出，初選論壇時彭一定已知道「墨落無悔」是來自港島協調會議的內容，李運騰並補充控方意思是雖然彭簽署時沒細看，但因論壇上有討論「墨落無悔」，故彭會知道聲明的內容。彭不同意，亦指論壇前沒有看聲明作準備。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方指彭卓棋論壇提願榮光歌詞-官稱無聽過質疑與案無關&quot;&gt;控方指彭卓棋論壇提《願榮光》歌詞 官稱無聽過、質疑與案無關&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行其後再引彭卓棋的開場白，提及「昂首拒默沉，吶喊聲響透，盼自由歸於這裏」，指是《願榮光歸香港》的歌詞。李運騰質疑相關性，又指他沒為意這是《願榮光》歌詞，「我從來沒聽過那首歌」。周解釋是與反修例示威相關，陳慶偉指他們並非審理該示威是否合法。周再解釋是以顯示當時背景，惟陳慶偉指對背景沒興趣。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭稱無深究何謂肢體抗爭-認說出自己也不明白的話&quot;&gt;彭稱無深究何謂「肢體抗爭」 認說出自己也不明白的話&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續關注，彭該段發言提到「我哋入到議會不惜以肢體抗爭」，但昨又稱會在法律框架下實踐志向，他如何沒有暴力地進行肢體抗爭？彭重申「當時我冇深究呢個字具體係點樣做」，又指是「當時都幾流行嘅說法」，是「選舉語言」。李笑問，所以彭是說自己也不明白的東西？（“You are speaking things without knowing what you are saying?”），彭稱「呢個當時係唔啱，但真係我當時嘅情況，因為而家我睇返，以肢體抗爭係不能夠癱瘓到政府」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭其後再指，上述發言除了「大家好我係港島區彭卓棋團隊」外，均屬「選舉語言」。陳仲衡指若然如此，該段發言不會讓其潛在參選人更了解他？彭答「當時我哋以為係有用囉」，認為可助他取得議席。控方指，該段發言是彭打算當選後做的事，彭不同意。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭稱無關注戴耀廷初選後發言-指已放棄政綱真係萬估不到都係會出事&quot;&gt;彭稱無關注戴耀廷初選後發言 指已放棄政綱「真係萬估不到都係會出事」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後就《國安法》實施後初選記者會和戴耀廷帖文發問。彭表示，知悉7月6日初選組織者召記者會，但沒看過亦沒有嘗試了解，「我認為應該關注返自己個選舉。」李運騰指，但彭因關注初選合法性才撕毀選舉單張，為何不嘗試了解戴在會上的發言？彭指因他撕毀單張和通知民主動力移除政綱後，「雖然我明白未必做得最好，我係做盡咗之後，我放咗心」，「當時我真係有信心係冇事嘅。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳仲衡指但彭說過不了解《國安法》條文，而戴是法律系教授，彭回應：「我係唔知道《國安法》嘅具體法律含意當然，我放棄政綱，我真係萬估不到，都係會出事。」彭亦指，沒看過戴翌日於《蘋果日報》的〈民主派35+初選會否觸犯國安法〉一文，重申：「我做晒所有防範措施，我嘅警戒心經已係完全係好放心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;彭稱無開啟戴耀廷帖文無興趣曾國衞發言-稱專注拉票冇認為需要睇&quot;&gt;彭稱無開啟戴耀廷帖文、無興趣曾國衞發言 稱專注拉票「冇認為需要睇」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭卓棋續確認，7月9日於港島區群組收到戴耀廷發出一條連結，但「我冇撳入去睇」，不知道是戴對時任政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞稱初選或違法的回應之 Facebook 帖文。彭在追問下，指不知道曾國衞當天的發言，但從新聞知道葉劉淑儀稱初選不犯法的言論是回應曾國衞。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李追問他對葉劉淑儀的話有興趣，卻非曾國衞的話？彭指「我當時冇認為需要去睇」，「嗰陣時我專注係做返我嘅拉票囉」，又指「就算佢（葉劉）唔講，我都主觀地以為自己冇事」，因他於7月9日前已做盡所有措施，「葉劉淑儀又令我更加放心。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;戴耀廷於7月9日召初選記者會，多名初選候選人均有出席。彭稱知道有該記者會，其團隊的李永財和張嘉莉亦有出席，但他與何志宏決定不去。彭指他不知道會上內容，亦沒有問，因沒興趣，只是在二人出席前「我千叮萬囑佢哋，唔好亂講嘢」，李永財着他「放心」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑刪政綱不等於撤回主張-彭冇政綱即係放棄政綱&quot;&gt;控方質疑刪政綱不等於撤回主張 彭：冇政綱，即係放棄政綱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方續問及彭卓棋應對《國安法》的做法，質疑公眾不會得知他放棄政綱。就彭卓棋要求民動於投票系統移除政綱，周天行指移除政綱並不等於撤回政治主張，只是系統上看不到政綱。彭不同意，指「冇政綱，即係放棄政綱，唔係掩藏任何嘢」。周天行再指若選民不打開投票系統，便不會知道彭移除了政綱，彭不同意，重申他在街上也有派發撕爛的政綱，但同意法官指若沒看過其原有單張，不會知道被撕走的內容。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰一度關注，彭派發單張時有否提及放棄了政綱。彭稱雖然不能逐字覆述，但當時「我心態係放棄政綱，因此變成空白」，其後確認他有向查詢者表示已放棄政綱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑彭受訪無提擔心違國安法仍保留墨落無悔無要求刪論壇片&quot;&gt;控方質疑彭受訪無提擔心違《國安法》、仍保留「墨落無悔」無要求刪論壇片&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭昨亦指曾接受BBC訪問，稱不想犯《國安法》故放棄政綱，報導提及彭卓棋「由於《國安法》含糊不清，不知道當局會怎樣利用《國安法》或其他理由去取消民主派人士的參選資格，他自己也在文宣物品上有所改動。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行質疑彭無提及擔心違反《國安法》。彭稱「有提及，係不清楚、含糊囉」，並指「佢冇寫出嚟」，但他有告訴記者。周問他在訪問刊出後有否向記者查詢？彭稱沒有，亦「唔知道個記者點解咁樣報」。周再指，若人們沒有看到這篇文章，不會知道彭政綱有變？彭同意，但重申「我相信唔係唯一一個方法知道我嘅情況」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續質疑，彭稱已盡力讓公眾知道他放棄政綱，但卻沒有在 Facebook 公布，又指彭發布的「墨落無悔」聲明於6月30日後仍保留，至初選前亦沒有要求組織者移除選舉論壇的片段，彭均同意。彭亦同意，於7月6日後派發名為「請柬」的單張，但單張上無提放棄政綱。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;相片見手持爛單張-官質疑彭卓棋ig若為私人-如何助告知公眾已放棄政綱&quot;&gt;相片見手持爛單張 官質疑彭卓棋IG若為私人 如何助告知公眾已放棄政綱&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就派發撕爛的單張，辯方早前展示彭卓棋 Instagram 的相片，顯示彭與競選團隊李永財和何致宏同手持撕毀的選舉單張，嚴肅面對鏡頭緊握拳頭。控方問該帳戶是公開抑或私人，彭稱「現在係 private，當時係 public」，但頓了頓改稱「抱歉，當時係咪 public 唔記得」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰即質疑，彭曾稱嘗試以該相片顯示他已放棄政綱，若帳戶是私人的，如何能幫助他告知公眾？彭稱「我私人嘅意思係朋友之間嘅分享」，惟李再問：「若只是限於朋友分享，如何能告知公眾？」彭望住螢幕約10秒後稱，「或者咁講，我搣完（單張）同埋通知咗民動之後，我就認為夠喇。」李追問，即彭不打算透過該相片告知公眾？彭答「都唔係，因為擺得上 IG，就預咗係公開」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;李運騰續指需要彭的幫助，指「我們不用 Instagram，我們屬於老一代人，我們甚至不用 Facebook，我們不用社交媒體」，問彭若不是其朋友能否看到相片。彭指他可翻查自己呈交的審訊文件夾，看看宣傳時有否提及其帳戶，並即場翻閱文件。李運騰指可留待覆問處理，彭並確認該相片有出現於其公開的 Facebook。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官質疑相片不能傳達放棄政綱意思-彭明眼人都知我哋縮咗&quot;&gt;官質疑相片不能傳達放棄政綱意思 彭：明眼人都知我哋縮咗&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續主動提到，該相片只有3名男子手持撕爛的單張、沒有任何解釋，可有不同解讀，例如代表彭已透過撕爛政綱，「擺脫了女性成員」，變成「全男班（macho team）」；又指若他不認識彭，可能完全不知道相片的意思，而他若認識彭，或會理解彭的團隊減至3人，港島區初選名單限制亦正正是3人。陳續指問題是，單單發布該相片，並不能傳達彭放棄政綱或擔心違反《國安法》的訊息。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭思考一會後指拍照時，其團隊的張嘉莉沒出席。陳慶偉指那不是他的問題，李運騰亦指問題是該照片可有不同解讀，公眾或不知道彭想說什麼。彭再說「我諗依張相都⋯⋯我當時認為可能⋯⋯應該咁講，sorry」，陳慶偉問是否認為已足夠表達訊息，彭同意，並補充：「其實 po 一張爛嘢，po 呢張相出嚟，明眼人都知我哋縮咗㗎喇。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;惟陳慶偉質疑是視乎讀者理解，直言「我看不到你退縮。有些東西是撕爛了，但實際上無人知道你『縮』了什麼」。彭答「抱歉答唔到」，重申「我以為足夠喇」。陳再說，尤其是彭在相片握緊拳頭，「你在縮什麼？不縮什麼？無人會知道！」彭僅表示：「當時攝影師話擺啲有型啲嘅甫士。」周天行終指，彭有時間發布帖文和準備新單張，卻沒時間公布已放棄政綱？陳慶偉指彭已回答他已盡力。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;控方質疑彭有意實踐初選承諾-彭稱國安法後已放棄初選成績太難睇&quot;&gt;控方質疑彭有意實踐初選承諾 彭稱《國安法》後已放棄、初選成績「太難睇」&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;控方其後展示彭卓棋2020年10月至2021年8月的區議會工作報告，顯示報告兩個項目時有「兌現選舉承諾，promise made, promise kept」的蓋章。周天行問，彭立志入立會服務港人，並於區議會努力工作裝備自己，而彭參與初選試水溫，因知道落敗就不能參與立法會選舉？彭回答時提到，他的夢想是推動青年創業，「立法會只不過係一個平台」，而他初選落敗後未必會再參選：「因為我當時初選之後，個成績實在太難睇，得3%都唔夠，就要承擔責任，市民唔鍾意我哋。」&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭在李運騰追問下同意，作為區議員，認為兌現選舉承諾是重要，因此在工作報告提及自己的成績，以向選民展示他有兌現承諾。周天行問，因此彭在初選作出的承諾，不只是政治語言？彭重申，政綱中「香港本位經濟」、「教育自主化」等四點「係我深信嘅」，而「從一而終的抗爭派」和「重組警隊」兩點則為「選舉語言」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;周天行續向彭指出，他有意實踐初選作出的承諾。彭答：「七一（《國安法》生效）之後放棄咗，連同選舉語言。但係講青年創業到今日都冇變過。」周終指，彭於案發期間，與其他被告同意取得立會過半後無差別否決預算案，迫使政府回應五大訴求，彭不同意。周再指彭意圖顛覆國家政權，彭表示不同意，指「初選期間，我都繼續搞大灣區嘅商標，咁樣係矛盾嘅」。控方表示完成盤問。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;辯方展示2021年帖文-官質疑無法證案發時帳戶為公開-反問為何要相信彭&quot;&gt;辯方展示2021年帖文 官質疑無法證案發時帳戶為公開 反問為何要相信彭&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;就彭卓棋2020年7月的 Instagram 帳戶是否公開，大律師盧敏儀於覆問時展示2021年2月19日「赤石號」專頁提及彭工作旳帖文，當中寫有彭的 Instagram 帳號。彭指該帖文於他被起訴前發布，而他2021年3月獲法庭保釋後，擔心可能違反保釋條件故關掉 Facebook 專頁，並將 Instagram 轉為私人，故肯定2020年7月時其帳戶是公開。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉多次質疑，以該2021年的帖文如何能推斷2020年的情況，「告訴我你的邏輯」，盧敏儀亦問有否客觀證據顯示帳戶於2020年7月公開。彭答「我記得係啦」，強調其 Instagram「一路以嚟都係 public」，直至被正式控告。陳慶偉指，彭今早才告知法庭不肯定當時是公開或私人，正因為他的答案，才引來這一連串問題。彭說：「我⋯而家係肯定嘅。」陳慶偉問：「為何我現在要相信你？（“Why should I believe you now?”）」，並指似乎彭只是從個人記憶回答。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;官問為何初選落敗仍保留連儂牆-彭稱無特別意思&quot;&gt;官問為何初選落敗仍保留「連儂牆」 彭稱無特別意思&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;陳慶偉續指，彭稱於初選成績「太難睇」，即他即使用了政治語言，對其選民也沒有效果，彭同意。陳續指，而初選後他就無需使用該些政治語言，可以回復「真我」（“… return to your true self?”），彭答「都係」。陳續要求展示彭2021年1月6日被捕當天的辦公室照片，問既然彭於初選落敗、又無需再使用政治語言，為何仍保留「連儂牆」？彭答「我冇特別意思係點解唔拎走」。盧敏儀追問，牆上沒有違反《國安法》的東西？彭答「唔會有」。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;彭完成3天作供，案件明不開庭，下周一（7月3日）續審，料由何啟明作供。&lt;/p&gt;

However, the dominance of U.S. regulatory practices in global tech sector has given way due to the ascendancy of the European Commission.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;excerpt&gt;&lt;/excerpt&gt; &lt;em&gt;Brussels’s growing global regulatory influence marks a tectonic shift: European regulators are increasingly succeeding in demanding changes in the business methods of U.S. tech companies as the price of doing business in Europe, and Europe’s influence is spreading beyond the continent as a result.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although elements of European tech regulation in the pursuit of digital sovereignty threaten the success of U.S. businesses in global markets, U.S. officials have hesitated to insist on fair treatment in Europe. A case in point is the latest Trade and Technology Council meeting and declaration. Meanwhile, the administration under U.S. president Joseph Biden is bending the language of regulations under the Inflation Reduction Act beyond what Congress intended to accommodate Europe’s objection to discriminatory aspects of the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large internet platforms — mostly U.S.-based tech businesses — have led the way in global tech innovation from Web 2.0 to artificial intelligence, despite Europe having a roughly comparable gross domestic product (GDP), population, and talent pool of educated workers. Most game-changing large language models have been developed by U.S. digital services firms competing with one another, not European firms. Even with the success of the light-touch U.S. regulatory environment, Europe believes, to the contrary, that more heavy-handed regulation will nurture the growth of aspirational European tech champions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regulatory-costs-for-us-companies&quot;&gt;Regulatory Costs for U.S. Companies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU Data Act makes clear that if Europe intends to impose regulations that slow down U.S.-based tech companies through targeted “gatekeeper” designations and asymmetric data sharing requirements and limitations so that European firms have space to catch up, it will do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law, implemented in 2018, is shaping data protection laws beyond Europe in countries such as India, Indonesia, and Colombia, which are emulating Europe as the first mover in regulation. The GDPR has caused an 8.1 percent decline in business profits and a 2.2 percent drop in sales, according to a new estimate by researchers at the Oxford Martin School, which is consistent with estimates made before the implementation of the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In implementing the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA), Europe is putting in place discriminatory provisions aimed directly at large U.S. platforms. For example, the DSA initially designated 19 entities as Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) or Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs), 16 of which are U.S.-based private entities, 2 of which are Chinese, and only 1 of which is based in the European Union. Recently, CSIS published a study estimating the significant economic costs of the DMA, DSA, and other new tech regulations that U.S. and EU companies will bear. For U.S. service providers, the estimated cost of compliance is in the range of $22–$50 billion. CSIS analysis also shows that U.S. global services exports could decrease by 2 percent. Going forward, weighing the steep costs for innovation and productivity against the aspirational benefits of these laws should be a more transparent part of EU deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Europe has declined to fix discriminatory provisions in the DMA and DSA, several impactful pieces of legislation still in the drafting stage may be written more in line with international trade obligations of nondiscrimination and national treatment that do not favor domestic businesses to the detriment of foreign firms. Such acts include the Data Act, the European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services, and the Artificial Intelligence Act. All of these proposed laws deserve attention because of the significant changes they would require in routine U.S. business practices and the attendant impact on U.S exports and jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-data-act&quot;&gt;The Data Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;intent&quot;&gt;Intent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall intent of the proposed Data Act is to achieve more competition in the European cloud services market; give users of connected devices such as cars, refrigerators, and smart phones control over their data, guarding against vendor lock-in (forcing consumers to buy products or services from particular vendors); and enable governments to access data controlled and generated by private companies in emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU concern over the lack of European-based data processing service providers, as articulated by EU political leaders, has been clear for some time. U.S.-based companies supply over 70 percent of cloud services in Europe, a figure EU politicians and regulators seek to reduce. According to Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the European Commission, “One of the main reasons that U.S. tech companies are popular in Europe is that their products are good. . . . Market forces are more than welcome, but we do not leave it to market forces to have the final say.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union adopted its overall European strategy for data in 2020, which recognizes that data are an essential resource for innovation and economic growth. The document envisions enhancing European competitiveness and data sovereignty by establishing a “single European data space.” The goal of this space is ensuring that more data are available in Europe “while keeping the companies and individuals who generate the data in control.” Director general for data at the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect) Yvo Volman has said, “Europe should be able to benefit from the value of its industrial data, and we need to act now to make it happen,” which would be transformational for production and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stretching credulity, the European Commission estimates the new data rules will create €270 billion in additional GDP by 2028. European industrial policy will combine policy, legal actions, and financing mechanisms under an overarching plan to coordinate different elements of the strategy. The Data Act stipulates who must relinquish data — a novel government power as seen from the U.S. side of the Atlantic — as well as who can access data, how data can be used to create value in the European Union, and for what purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Data Act aims to ratchet up the value of data in the European Union controlled by Europeans, specifically to reduce EU reliance on U.S. companies for data. The regulation targets U.S. tech firms operating in the European Union by forcing the sharing of proprietary data and intellectual property with their European and Chinese competitors. Under Articles 4(3) and 5(8), trade secrets must be disclosed to users and third parties so long as “all specific necessary measures pursuant to Directive (EU) 2016/943 are taken in advance to preserve their confidentiality.” In a world where U.S. trade secrets are regularly lost to theft, enforcing this requirement, particularly on third parties, will prove extremely difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Data Act stipulates who must relinquish data — a novel government power as seen from the U.S. side of the Atlantic — as well as who can access data, how data can be used to create value in the European Union, and for what purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry stakeholders stress that further clarification in these requirements should come out of the trilogue discussions so that data holders have solid guidance on when disclosure of data is mandatory and how to demonstrate when they are likely to suffer damage from the disclosure of trade secrets. Joining this debate, a recent joint statement by Digital Europe and the European Business Roundtable for Industry raised alarm bells regarding what they view as the fundamental interests of holders and creators of industrial data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Capitalizing on the value of data will be crucial for Europe’s competitiveness over the next decades. But as it stands, the Data Act will force European heavyweights that have invested heavily in automation and digitalisation in sectors like manufacturing, green tech and health to give away their data, leading to a new wave of de-industrialisation and putting our cybersecurity at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scope&quot;&gt;Scope&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of the Data Act covers both nonpersonal and personal data. The act defines data as “any digital representation of acts, facts or information and any compilation of such acts, facts or information, including in the form of sound, visual or audio-visual recording.” Because the Data Act covers all data, not just personal data, it must be read in tandem with the European Union’s GDPR, which deals with personal data only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main obligations of the Data Act is greater accessibility of data generated by product-related services linked to connected devices, such as smartphones and refrigerators. The regulation outlines requirements for business-to-consumer and business-to-business data sharing. Users have the right to request their data and share it with a third party, such as an independent repair service, free of charge and without delay. Furthermore, data holders must make data available to data recipients in a “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” as well as “transparent” manner. The regulation enforces users’ right to switch between providers of data processing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The draft rules also compel cloud providers to take measures to shield customer data from foreign extra-territorial government data access laws that may (or may not) conflict with EU or national laws on privacy or other EU fundamental rights; intellectual property, including trade secrets; and “the fundamental interests of a Member State related to national security or defence.” To quote Commissioner Breton, “We have also adapted our regulatory framework through the Data Governance Act and the Data Act by inserting anti-Cloud Act clauses, because it is not acceptable that the data of Europeans can be accessed in an unjustified manner.” In some ways these rules are similar to the so-called Standard Contractual Clauses under the GDPR, where the responsibility of sorting out alleged or substantiated conflicts of laws falls exclusively on companies. This recently led the Irish Data Protection Commission to conclude that “any internet platform” subject to the conflicting law, in this case FISA 702, “may equally fall foul” of the data transfer requirements of the GDPR. Similar rules would result in high compliance costs for U.S. tech companies operating in the European Union and push U.S. companies to store more of their data in Europe, further limiting data flows to the United States. The regulation also instructs providers to put safeguards in place to protect international transfers of nonpersonal data. With few exceptions, it broadens the GDPR stance on cross-border transfers of personal data to cross-border transfers of business data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a challenge for U.S. companies that rely on cross-border data transfers of industrial data and could result in the same levels of disruption and cost that the GDPR caused to U.S. and EU businesses when it was passed in 2018. For example, it seems Tesla would be barred from transferring safety data collected in Europe to analysts at auto manufacturing sites in the United States. In addition, beyond issues of data flows, Article 27 could be used to ban U.S. firms from doing business in some sectoral markets, even if the data is stored in Europe. The article leaves room for interpretations that would lead to the development of “immunity requirements” against non-EU cloud providers — in other words, implementing discriminatory rules against cloud providers subject to foreign laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Article 27 could be used to ban U.S. firms from doing business in some sectoral markets, even if the data is stored in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contractual-freedom&quot;&gt;Contractual Freedom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intruding into freedom of contracts for data transfers, the regulation also aims to ensure unfair contracts are not imposed on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through a gray list and a forbidden list of contractual practices. The regulation outlines the requirements for interoperability of data sharing and processing, specifically in a section on the use of smart contracts for data sharing. The European Commission plans to outline models for contractual terms to allow for negotiation of fair contracts, as defined by regulators. While U.S. companies will not be obligated to use these templates, they will face pressure to do so to avoid friction and extra scrutiny from EU authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, relevant parties must make data available to public sector bodies in case of exceptional need. This would be relevant in times of public emergency when certain data are necessary to fulfill a specific task. In these cases, the Data Act might allow sharing of mobility and location information on connected devices for public health and humanitarian reasons. However, U.S. companies may fear handing over proprietary information to their competitors and government agencies. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce commented, “We support frameworks that encourage data sharing when it is in market participants’ mutual interests, but data sharing mandates such as what is envisaged in the Data Act will dissuade companies from investing in R&amp;amp;D or other critical activities in Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enforcement of the Data Act will fall to competent member state authorities. There could be fines or financial penalties for infringements of the law, though the European Commission has not yet established revenue-based remedies as under the GDPR. Furthermore, the regulation foresees a dispute settlement mechanism to resolve data-related disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the act’s financial toll on U.S. digital services providers, a rise in digital services costs would pose a high burden for European firms. In a 2022 CSIS survey, over 60 percent of micro and small European firms stated a 5 percent increase in technology costs would be worse or much worse than inflation, slowing demand, or supply chain backlogs. A 2020 EU survey showed how 40 percent of European businesses have a very low level of digital intensity — much lower than their U.S. counterparts. European regulators should recognize that additional digital costs will have an adverse impact on EU economic growth by increasing regulatory compliance costs. Given that European firms are already underinvesting in new technologies and are hampered by higher operating costs than U.S. or Asian firms, increases in the overall cost of digital services in Europe will put European firms at an even greater disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Data Act, as proposed, also may hinder emergence of competitive European platforms by encouraging dependence on easy access to regulated data. While alternative platforms may emerge in the EU market, they would rely inherently on the regulated right to receive ported data. The resulting business models, built around regulation rather than innovation, would make for a less dynamic digital services landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, the Data Act perpetuates the objectionable classification of gatekeepers designated under the DMA and states that these firms would not be able to use the new portability right established by the Data Act to transfer data to other designated gatekeepers, which discriminates against U.S.-based cloud providers. Thus, U.S. digital platforms, while required to divulge large amounts of data to their competitors upon request, are excluded from receiving the data other firms generate. On the flip side, preventing European users from migrating their data from one large U.S. provider to another, just because they are large and designated as gatekeepers, runs counter to European consumer interests, including the freedom to benefit from the greater privacy, security, quality, and performance standards U.S. firms often employ. It also runs counter to the principle of interoperability that has characterized the professed goals of earlier EU digital regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s attempts to create opportunities for EU companies by preventing gatekeepers from benefiting from the portability right may backfire. For instance, while a given payments company could transfer data from Amazon Web Services to another cloud services company, the recipient could not be another gatekeeper, such as Microsoft. However, the next best option would be transferring the data not to European providers but rather to Chinese firms more efficient than their EU counterparts. Aside from nullifying the goal of the act, this result raises a host of economic security issues. Chinese data providers have a spotty track record when it comes to information sharing. For one, they have in the past blocked some offshore users from accessing business data. Two, they have improperly shared user data with the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stakeholder-input-on-the-data-act&quot;&gt;Stakeholder Input on the Data Act&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ambitious as the Data Act is with its aggressive forays into regulating the new economy, a thorough process for considering stakeholder concerns is important. Stakeholders have had several opposition views. BusinessEurope requested Europe preserve contractual freedom in data sharing. Similarly, the Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) maintains that business-to-business data sharing should remain voluntary and authorized on a contract-by-contract basis. In a letter to European officials, German software maker SAP and Siemens offered objections, stating the Data Act “risks undermining European competitiveness by mandating data sharing — including core know-how and design data — with not only the user, but also third parties.” By contrast, the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) enthusiastically advocates a data portability right for customers that extends beyond personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 1, 2023, a total of 30 trade associations released a joint statement stating, “As the policymaking process accelerates on this pivotal proposal, industry warns against possible unintended economic consequences across data value chains.” They also cautioned, “Before opening Pandora’s box, the Data Act’s rules need to be tried and tested in real-world market conditions to make sure that they work for European businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exceptional circumstances clause of the Data Act has stimulated further debate. BusinessEurope has expressed concerns about the relatively broad nature of the provision, and the European Data Protection Board and the European Data Protection Supervisor have also questioned the necessity and proportionality of making data available to public sector bodies and EU institutions in these cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;outlook&quot;&gt;Outlook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislative process for the Data Act is about halfway complete, and there is not a clear picture of how it will look in final form. On March 14, 2023, the European Parliament adopted the act, including several amendments, by a vote of 500–23, with 110 abstentions. The final text will be decided through trilogue negotiations involving the European Commission, European Parliament, and Council of the European Union, where many of these issues will be debated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, member states have supported the Data Act proposal. Finland’s minister of transport and communications expressed that the Data Act was a crucial step in EU efforts to “share knowledge, pool our research and development resources, and ensure that human rights and democratic values are entrenched in all global standards and protocols.” However, the new Swedish president has pointed to challenges in finding agreement on exemptions for SMEs, business-to-government data sharing, and trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global influence of European regulators continues to grow despite the better record of the lighter-touch U.S. regulatory model in producing innovation, competition, and growth in technology firms. EU regulations have been directly discriminating against large U.S. digital service providers. The DSA, for instance, designates 16 U.S.-based entities out of the 19 regulated VLOPs or VLOSEs. The Data Act, for its part, is just one element of the European Union’s march to digital sovereignty, a multifaceted industrial policy that poses systemic challenges to the future success of U.S. businesses in Europe and global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, however, it does not appear Europe is very interested in decelerating its legislative schedule or taking on board policy concerns and questions by U.S. parties with respect to how the Data Act will operate in practice. From the outside looking in, it seems that U.S. officials, so far, have been reluctant to engage with Europe to improve the discriminatory aspects of the Data Act proposal aimed solely at U.S. employers and workers. Now is the time for U.S. digital trade negotiators to vigorously raise questions and concerns with their EU counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
